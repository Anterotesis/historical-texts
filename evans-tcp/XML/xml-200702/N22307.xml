<HEAD>DEDICATION. TO MRS. BINGHAM.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM not ignorant that the style of dedications in general, is that of panegyric, where the au∣thor endeavours to elevate the
<PB N="viii" REF="029439_0008_0FE2A05449A82330"/>
character of their patron or pat∣roness, above that of every other human being. But I am sensi∣ble were I to address a person of your understanding, in the lan∣guage of adulation, I should on∣ly excite your contempt. Nor is it necessary for me, to set forth, the many amiable traits, in a cha∣racter so well known, so univer∣sally esteemed and respected as Mrs. Bingham's.</P>
<P>I sincerely wish Madam, that this work was a more perfect per∣formance,
<PB N="ix" REF="029439_0009_0FE29F0A6E68FB40"/>
that it might be more worthy your acceptance, and the honour you have done me, in permitting me to dedicate it to you. Such as it is, it may perhaps innocently amuse a lei∣sure hour; and under the pro∣tecting sanction of your name, I do not fear its meeting a fa∣vourable reception from the public in general. For however trifling its own merits, your pa∣tronage will stamp a value on it, and raise it into that conse∣quence,
<PB N="x" REF="029439_0010_0FE29F0C5E2550D0"/>
it otherwise could ne∣ver attain.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I have the honour to be, Madam, your much obliged And very humble servant, SUSANNA ROWSON.</SIGNED> <DATELINE><HI>Philadelphia,</HI> <DATE><HI>April</HI> 13<HI>th,</HI> 1795.</DATE></DATELINE></CLOSER>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS a person of sensibility, whom bu∣siness or necessity, forces into the house of an entire stranger, (especially if that stranger is his superior in genius, education or rank,) experiences a sensa∣tion undescribably painful, in being ne∣cessiated to announce himself, and ex∣plain the intent of his visit: so I feel myself inexpressibly embarrassed and timid, whilst performing the unavoid∣able task of writing a Preface. It is ad∣dressing myself to, and calling up the attention of a multiplicity of strangers; it is introducing not myself indeed, but what is nearly the same thing, the off∣spring of my imagination, to their no∣tice, and conscious as I am, that it will
<PB N="xii" REF="029439_0012_0FE29F106EBAF788"/>
be perused by those, who are infinitely my superiors, this awkward timidity encreases, to an almost unconquerable degree.</P>
<P>"The works of fiction," says Dr. Johnson, <Q>with which the present ge∣neration seems more particularly de∣lighted; are such as exhibit life in its true state, diversified only by ac∣cidents that daily happen in the world, and influenced by passions and qualities, which are really to be found in conversing with mankind. In narratives, where historical vera∣city has no place, I cannot discover why there should not be exhibited a most perfect idea of virtue, not an∣gelical, nor above probability; for what we cannot credit, we shall ne∣ver imitate; but the highest and pur∣est that humanity can reach, which exercised in such trials as the various revolutions of things shall bring up∣on it, may, by conquering some ca∣lamities, and enduring others, teach us what we may hope, and what we can perform.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="xiii" REF="029439_0013_0FE29FEAC851E5E8"/>
Upon this plan I have endeavoured to form the "Trials of the Human Heart." My Heroine, though not wholly free from error, (for where shall we find the human being that is so?) I trust is not altogether unworthy imitation. Through various trying situations, as daughter, wife, and mo∣ther; I have strove to conduct her with propriety, tempering the weakness of humanity with the patience and forti∣tude of a Christian, and that dignified pride, which will ever arise from a just sense of the moral virtues.</P>
<P>It is with reluctance I find myself obliged to remark, that the literary world is infested with a kind of loath∣some reptile, of the class of non-descripts, for it cannot be ranked with proprie∣ty amongst either authors or critics, not possessing the qualifications necessary to form either, and being in itself re∣markable for nothing but its noxious qualities: its only aim is to prevent the success of any work of genius; and swelling with envy, should the smallest part of public favour, be conferred on
<PB N="xiv" REF="029439_0014_0FE29FF03383D208"/>
another, spits out its malignant poison, in scurrility and detraction. One of these noisome reptiles, has lately crawl∣ed over the volumes, which I have had the temerity to submit to the public eye. I say <HI>crawled over</HI> them, because I am certain it has never penetrated beyond the title-page of any.</P>
<P>Perhaps it would be as well, did I suffer this circumstance to pass unno∣ticed; the arguments used, I must con∣fess, are unanswerable, being in some parts incomprehensible, and in others of such a nature, that no woman can glance her eye over them, without feel∣ing the blush of offended delicacy crim∣son her cheek. Yet, as I have been accused of writing in an improper style in my Novel of the "Fille de Chambre," and of expressing sentiments foreign to my heart, in my Comedy of "Slaves in Algiers," I think it necessary to assure the candid and impartial public, that both these assertions are equally false and scandalous.</P>
<P><PB N="xv" REF="029439_0015_0FE29FF565396370"/>
Though many a leisure hour has been amused, and many a sorrowful one be∣guiled, whilst giving Fancy the reins, I have applied myself to my pen, it has ever been my pride, that I never yet wrote a line that might tend to mislead the untutored judgment, or corrupt the inexperienced heart; and heaven for∣bid I should suffer ought to escape my pen, that might call a blush to the cheek of innocence, or deserve a glance of displeasure from the eye of the most rigid moralist.</P>
<P>As to my opinion of the political concerns of America, or my wishes in regard to her welfare, I cannot better explain them, than by giving a slight sketch of my private history, with which, I rather imagine, the <HI>creature</HI> alluded to, is entirely unacquainted.</P>
<P>It was my fate, at a period when memory can scarcely retain the small∣est trace of the occurrence, to accompa∣ny my father, (Mr. William Haswell, who is a lieutenant in the British navy) to Boston in New England, where he
<PB N="xvi" REF="029439_0016_0FE29FF70E469E08"/>
had married a second wife, my mother having lost her life in giving me exist∣ence. Blest with a genteel competen∣cy, and placed by his rank and educa∣tion in that sphere of life, where the polite and friendly attentions of the most respectable characters courted our acceptance, and enjoying a constant intercourse with the families of the of∣ficers of the British army and navy, then stationary there, eight years of my life glided almost imperceptibly away.</P>
<P>At that time the dissentions between England and America encreased to an alarming degree: my father bore the king's commission, he had taken the oath of allegiance; certain I am that no one who considers the nature of an oath, voluntarily taken, no one who re∣flects, that previous to this period, he had served thirty years under the Bri∣tish government, will blame him for a strict adherence to principles which were interwoven as it were with his ex∣istance. He did adhere to them, the attendant consequence may readily
<PB N="xvii" REF="029439_0017_0FE29FF88FC41260"/>
be supposed; his person was confined, his property confiscated.</P>
<P>Then it was that the benevolence and philanthropy, which so eminently dis∣tinguish the sons and daughters of Co∣lumbia made an indeliable impression on my heart, an impression which nei∣ther time or chance can obliterate, for while their political principles obliged them to afflict, the humanity, the Chris∣tian like benevolence of their souls, in∣cited them to wipe the tears of sor∣row from the eyes of my parents, to mitigate their sufferings, and render those afflictions in some measure sup∣portable. Would to Heaven it was in my power to render their memories as immortal, as my gratitude is unbound∣ed.</P>
<P>Having been detained as a prisoner two years and an half, part of which was spent in <HI>Hingham,</HI> and part in <HI>Ab∣ington;</HI> an exchange of prisoners tak∣ing place between the British and Ame∣ricans, my father and his family were sent by cartel to Halifax, from whence
<PB N="xviii" REF="029439_0018_0FE2A00085D996D0"/>
we embarked for England. I will not pretend to describe the sorrow I experi∣enced, in being thus separated from the companions of my early years: every wish of my heart was for the welfare and prosperity of a country, which con∣tained such dear, such valuable friends, and the only comfort of which my mind was capable, was indulging in the delightful hope, of being at some future period permitted again to revisit a land so beloved, companions so regretted.</P>
<P>Too young at that time, to have form∣ed any political principles of my own, I may naturally be supposed to have adopted those of my father, but the truth is, that equally attached to either country, the unhappy dissentions af∣fected me in the same manner as a person may be imagined to feel, who having a tender lover, and an affection∣ate brother who are equally dear to her heart, and by whom she is equally be∣loved, sees them engaged in a quarrel with, and fighting against each other, when, let whichsoever party conquer,
<PB N="xix" REF="029439_0019_0FE2A00219568AB0"/>
she cannot be supposed insensible to the fate of the vanquished.</P>
<P>During a period of twelve years a variety of painful circumstances unne∣cessary here to recount, contributed to deprive me of a decent independence inherited from my paternal grandfather, and at length to bring me back to America, in a very different situation, I must confess, from that in which I left it; but with a heart, still glowing with the same affectionate sensations, and exulting in its evident improve∣ment: the arts are encouraged, manu∣factures increase, and this happy land bids fair to be in the course of a few years the most flourishing nation in the universe.</P>
<P>Is it then wonderful, that accustomed from the days of childhood, to think of America and its inhabitants with af∣fection, linked to them by many near connections, and sincerely attached to them, from principles of gratitude, that I should offer the most ardent prayers for a continuation of their prosperity,
<PB N="xx" REF="029439_0020_0FE2A003A4640E28"/>
or that feeling the benign influence of the blessings of peace and liberty, here so eminently enjoyed, I should wish that influence extended throughout eve∣ry nation under heaven.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I beg leave to say a few words more, concerning my pre∣sent publication. I am willing to flat∣ter myself, that in offering this novel to the public, I am not preparing for my future life, either shame or repentance. That it is throughout the whole, hap∣pily imagined or highly polished, I have not sufficient confidence in my own abili∣ties to warrant; but whatever may be my final sentence from the world in general, I have at least endeavoured to deserve their kindness, nor shall I envy the ho∣nours which wit and learning obtain in any other cause, if I may be so happy as to awaken in the bosoms of my youth∣ful readers, a thorough detestation of vice, and a spririted emulation, to em∣brace and follow the precepts of Piety, Truth and Virtue.</P>

<P>WILL you believe me, Celia, when I tell you, I wish I was at Bologne again; that I am dissatisfied and unhappy. You are surprised. It is nevertheless certain∣ly true. We formed erroneous opinions of the world; we thought it a paradise compar∣ed to the solemnity and gloom of our con∣vent. Trust me, my dear, I have as yet found nothing, in this gay, busy world, half so
<PB N="2" REF="029439_0022_0FE2A00D88152338"/>
pleasing, as that sweet retirement. But I forget that this is my first letter, and that you naturally wish to know every incident which has happened since our separation. This innocent curiosity shall be gratified, and to begin:</P>
<P>During our journey, Mr. Verdome inform∣ed me that the reason of my being sent for home so suddenly, was to attend Mrs. Mir∣van, my godmother, who had been for a long time ill, and was supposed to be in a deep decline. "She went to Bristol," con∣tinued he, "a few days before I left England; your mother accompanied her, your father and Mrs. Talbot were to follow the ensuing week; we shall, therefore, on our arrival in England, set forward immediately for that place.</P>
<P>"Who is Mrs. Talbot?" said I.</P>
<P>"She is," replied Mr. Verdome, "a wi∣dow lady, who, being left in rather indigent circumstances, and being a distant relation of the family, has accepted an asylum in your father's house."</P>
<P>"If she is an amiable woman," said I, "my mother must be happy in having such a com∣panion."</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="029439_0023_0FE2A00F236B8528"/>
"She is sensible, well bred, and good an∣tured," he replied—and here the conversa∣tion dropped.</P>
<P>I was, as you may easily imagine, too much taken up with the disagreeable sensa∣tion of sea-sickness, to be able to reflect much, while crossing the channel: but no sooner was I in the chaise, proceeding toward Bris∣tol, than I began to form a thousand differ∣ent ideas about meeting my parents, not hav∣ing seen either of them since I could remem∣ber. I pictured them to myself, as very amiable old people—and, in fancy, felt their embraces and kissed off the tears of joy I saw falling from their eyes. Celia, we children of simplicity form strange enthusiastic no∣tions. In thinking of my dear Mrs. Mir∣van, I felt more lively sensations; because I was certain if she lived, when I arrived, I should be received by her with heart-felt sa∣tisfaction, and should I find her no more, my own heart would experience the most acute anguish. You must remember how much I am indebted to her tenderness and affection, and how very happy I was whenever she vi∣sited our convent.</P>
<P>At length we arrived at the end of our journey. I trembled so, that I could scarce∣ly support myself. Expectation, hope, fear,
<PB N="4" REF="029439_0024_0FE2A010A5E9A870"/>
by turns were predominant in my bosom. When we stopped, a handsome man, in ap∣pearance about five and thirty or forty years of age, handed me from the chaise, and sa∣luting me, said to Mr. Verdome, "faith she is a very fine girl." I saw Mr. Verdome frown; but had not time to make any fur∣ther remarks, before I found myself in the chamber of my godmother. Oh Celia! how that dear woman was altered; her face pale, eyes sunk and so reduced that she could not rise to meet me. She faintly smiled when I entered the room, I could not speak. I saw nothing, thought of nothing, but her; and running to her threw my arms round her neck and burst into tears. "Dear creature," said Mrs. Mirvan (embracing me) "we have surprised her. She was not prepared to see me thus, but come, my love, dry your tears; here is another lady, who indeed should have been the first object of your attention." I turned round and beheld the most beautiful woman, you can conceive, bending over me, her eyes full of tears. "My child, my belov∣ed Meriel," said she, taking me in her arms; "have you no recollection of your mother?" Whilst I was folded in her maternal embrace the door opened, and my mother continued, "come Mr. Howard welcome your daugh∣ter." I raised my head from my dear mo∣ther's bosom, and was surprised to see the
<PB N="5" REF="029439_0025_0FE2A0125EBB0508"/>
same gentleman, who had handed me from the chaise. "Your father, Meriel," said my mother. I bent one knee to the ground and kissed his hand. But shall I confess that whilst in that action, which should have ex∣pressed filial respect and love, I felt more of terror than either.</P>
<P>"Rise girl, rise," said he, "I have no taste for these fine romantic scenes. You knelt, because you were told it would be expected, not from any genuine impulse of the heart." My poor mother looked distressed. "I hope," said I, in a faultering voice, "I hope, sir, my conduct will henceforth convince my dear parents, that I am wanting in neither duty nor affection." "We shall see," said he, carelessly. "You women in general talk well, but as to your obedience and submis∣sion, when you are put to the trial you al∣ways fall far short of your professions." I saw the tears stand in my mother's eyes. Oh! cried the unfeeling man, if you are for a whimpering party, I shall leave you to yourselves, and go and finish my game at piquet with Mrs. Talbot.</P>
<P>When he was gone, I felt myself relieved, and entered into conversation with my mo∣ther and Mrs. Mirvan: though I could not but observe the hard struggle my dear pa∣rent
<PB N="6" REF="029439_0026_0FE2A01A530D9810"/>
had to repress her tears; I dared not notice her distress, least by so doing, I should increase it: besides I judged, that however palpable my father's errors might be, it would be an ungrateful subject to her, espe∣cially from the lips of a child.</P>
<P>For the first few days after my arrival, we flattered ourselves, that Mrs. Mirvan was much better; but this enchanting illusion soon vanished. We had been one morning chatting on her evident amendment, and she told me, when able to support the fatigue of a journey, she would go to the south of France, and I should accompany her. She wished my mother to go; but that dear good woman, says she, can never leave your fa∣ther for so long a time, (and his fortune be∣ing but small will not allow the whole fami∣ly to take such a journey.) At dinner time, she eat the wing of a chicken, and seemed to eat with an appetite; after which she drank a glass of Madeira; and in a short time com∣plaining of drowsiness, laid down on the so∣pha: my mother retired to her own room, and I took up a volume of Pope's Homer, to amuse myself. For some time, her sleep seemed composed, but she soon grew restless, breathed quick, and frequently started, eve∣ry now and then fetching a deep sigh, which terminated in a kind of convulsive groan. I
<PB N="7" REF="029439_0027_0FE2A01BE6D6AC38"/>
was alarmed and rang the bell, but before any one answered it, I perceived my belov∣ed godmother was in strong convulsions; my shrieks brought the whole family to the room; a physician was sent for, but alas! nothing could be done. She was immedi∣ately put to bed; but never recovered her senses until a few moments before the final scene closed. In that short interval, she bec∣koned my mother towards her, and putting my hand in hers, thus addressed me, though with difficulty. "Meriel, you are the only comfort that dear suffering saint possesses; let mutual friendship cement the bonds of natu∣ral affection; my child never forsake your mother, so shall the father of mercies never forsake you." I clasped my arms round my weeping parent, and articulated a vow to heaven, never to let her know a grief or pain, it was in my power to remove. My fortune, my peace of mind, my reputation, my life, every thing but integrity of heart, should be sacrificed to insure her felicity. "Enough, my child," faintly cried Mrs. Mirvan, "the Creator of the universe has heard, and accepts your vow.

thyself; 'tis that alone can support"—She could articulate no more, but her lips still moved. She clasped her hands earnestly; raised her eyes toward those blissful regions to which her pure soul aspired, and with a placid smile sunk to eternal rest.</P>
<P>"Oh!" said I, as I dropped on my knees by her bed side, "let me live a life of puri∣ty, that my death may be like hers." Amen, amen, cried my mother, as she raised me from the ground. We retired to her apart∣ment, where clasped in each others arms, we pour'd forth that tribute of affliction, the merits of our lost friend demanded.</P>

<P>I was so oppressed by the melancholy sub∣ject, that I could not for some time resume it. Pardon me, Celia, I do not mean to tri∣fle with your friendly anxiety, I shall, there∣fore, pursue my narrative.</P>
<P>When we had attended all that remained of the amiable Mrs. Mirvan to the grave; our family returned to Woodbine Cot. I do not speak of the conduct of my father dur∣ing this melancholy period, because it could neither excite my veneration or your esteem.
<PB N="9" REF="029439_0029_0FE2A02041B10B60"/>
Mrs. Talbot conducted herself with great propriety, exerted herself to comfort and cheer my mother, tho' I cannot tell why that dear woman did not receive her atten∣tions with that grateful sweetness, which she ever manifested to others. I think Mrs. Talbot a most engaging woman. She is not so handsome as my mother, but has a great deal more vivacity. She is tall, well made, and has a very expressive countenance, is affable, conciliating and extremely sensible; she is so kind as to assist and direct my stu∣dies. You know I am very fond of natu∣ral history. She frequently reads to me, and afterwards we saunter thro' the gar∣den, fields and meadows in search of sub∣jects to illustrate what we have read. In these rambles my mother accompanies us, but it grieves me to see such a settled me∣lancholy impressed upon her countenance. My brother Richard yesterday came from school for a few days. I can percieve he is my father's favourite, indeed my mother is extremely partial to him, tho' it is with pain. I remark many unamiable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> appear evi∣dent in his disposition, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as yet he has seen but thirteen years, being three years younger than myself. His behaviour to me was very ungracious, when we were first in∣troduced to each other. Tho' I had never seen him, yet as children of the same parents
<PB N="10" REF="029439_0030_0FE2A0268CAB9F30"/>
I felt my heart drawn toward him by an ir∣resistable impulse. I therefore on hearing of his arrival, ran down stairs and was going to welcome him with a cordial embrace, but the frigid coldness that his countenance dis∣played repressed my ardour. He advanced, just touched my cheek and bowing profound∣ly, wished me joy of my fortune. "Joy,! brother said I, indeed I have not thought of any thing but regret, for the sad occasion of my becoming mistress of this fortune; would to heaven! dear Mrs. Mirvan were still alive to enjoy those few thousands, the acquisition of which cannot compensate to me for the loss of her valuable society." "She was to be sure a good old woman," said he, careless∣ly, "but you know sister, she was very infirm, so I think she is much happier out of the world than in it." "Come, come Richard," said my mother with a look, half smiling, half frowning, "I must not hear you speak lightly of an event, which has so highly dis∣tressed us all." Master Richard smiled con∣temptuously, turned on his heel, hummed a tune and walked out of the room. How happens it, Celia, that the child of a woman possessed of such an excellent heart, and such exquisite sensibility should be so very unfeeling; perhaps you will say he cannot resemble both parents; true, too true, it is a just remark; but oh how superlatively.
<PB N="11" REF="029439_0031_0FE2A029818D5AA8"/>
happy would be my lot if both those parents resembled each other.</P>
<P>We live very retired, my father's income will not suffer him to associate with the high∣er class of inhabitants of the village, and his pride keeps him from those in the middling or lower walks of life. We are, therefore, visited by very few, nor among those few have I seen one, with whom my heart would claim acquaintance. Surely, Celia, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> must be women in the world, and young women too, who are different from any I have seen here. There are two families whom my mother is permitted to visit, and there are daughters in each family: but whenever we meet, which indeed is but seldom; they have so much to tell me concerning their lovers, their dresses and their petty differ∣ences with each other, that we have not a moment for rational conversation.</P>
<P>By this account you will naturally sup∣pose my time cannot pass in the most agree∣able manner. I devote great part of my mornings to reading, drawing, music, and needle work, and had I but my Celia here I could be tolerably easy; though I can ne∣ver be happy, while I see my mother op∣pressed with sorrow, which I can neither participate nor relieve. I have had little or
<PB N="12" REF="029439_0032_0FE2A02B0960E100"/>
no conversation with my father; as he still continues the same indifference towards me which I experienced at our first meeting. I shall continue to write to you my friend, tho' I can foresee my letters will contain but little variety: however it will be the means of keeping alive that friendship, which is to me so valuable, and a time may come when I shall be again happy in your society. Till then believe me in sincerity yours.</P>

<P>MERIEL is returned from the continent, where she has been from a state of in∣fancy immured in a gloomy convent. Mrs. Howard did not think her own family a pro∣per place for the tuition of a girl. She was right: her husband is by no means a brilli∣ant example, and I think, it would be a for∣tunate circumstance for young Howard was any thing to happen that might seperate him from his father. Meriel is not what is ge∣nerally termed a fine girl; she is rather be∣low the middle size, and inclined to <HI>on bon point;</HI> her face is not regularly pretty, but she has a lovely pair of hazel eyes, through which you may read every emotion of her soul. She is fair, a fine glow of health ani∣mates her face, and a smile of good humour plays about her mouth; a luxuriant quanti∣ty of chesnut hair hangs in ringlets down

her neck and shades a forehead that is orna∣mented with the most beautiful eye-brows I ever beheld. Yet she is not striking at first sight, indeed, you would rather be tempted to say she was plain, but the moment she speaks you must be charmed. I have heard women sing who have fine voices; but I would ra∣ther hear Meriel read a pathetic tale than listen to the finest singers in England. The melody of her voice, is so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oft that she makes the meanest subject interesting; her coun∣tenance intelligent, her mind fraught with every gentle, generous virtue, but withall she is the pure child of nature. I could not have believed it possible for a girl of sixteen to be so artless and innocent. An entire stranger to deception, she seeks not to dis∣guise one emotion of her heart. She loves neither her father nor her brother. I can∣not blame her, their souls are not congeni∣al with her own. Yet does she strive by re∣spect and attention to attone for the defici∣ency. I am so charmed with this dear girl, who is a brilliant model of her mother's vir∣tues; with this difference, Mrs. Howard's are passive virtues: Meriel's will prove active ones. I am so captivated with her gentle innocence that I find I can no longer remain in the family: Lucetta aid me to fly from infamy, from shame, from a black train of evils that I see ready to encompass me.

<P>CELIA, if you value your own happiness never desire to quit the convent. When I was there, I imagined my father a worthy character. Had I never left it, I had never been undeceived: indeed, it is a sad, sad thing to reflect on, but this man, whom nature, religion, every sacred tie obliges me to respect and love: this very man is a libertine, and an infidel. He came
<PB N="16" REF="029439_0036_0FE2A0396DEFC400"/>
one Sunday morning into the library, where I was reading. "Well my pretty rose-bud," said he, for he generally calls me by some such unaccountable name; "What are your studies?" "Rowe's letters," I replied. "What do you read such stuff as that for?" cried he, pulling the book out of my hand, "'Tis time enough for you to read such se∣rious nonsense some forty or fifty years hence, and here is that stupid fellow Harvey too," continued he, taking up a book that lay up∣on the table. "Why child, these ridiculous books are enough to turn your head; they might have done well enough in a convent, but surely you may find something more amusing in this collection." "I read these serious authors by choice, sir," said I. "You have a strange taste for a girl of your age then," he replied, "but I don't believe you speak as you think. Come tell me honestly, Meriel," continued he sitting, down beside me, "did you never get any novels or ro∣mances in the convent?" You may suppose I stared at him, for you know we never saw a book of the kind, during the whole time we were together; of this I assured him: to which he replied; "then that easily ac∣counted for my taste." He then began to speak of religion, and the sacred writings in a manner that made me tremble. At first, I thought he meant only to try me; but
<PB N="17" REF="029439_0037_0FE2A03AF04ADAA0"/>
finding the more I opposed his sentiments, the stronger were the arguments he advanced to confute, as he said, "my foolish bigotry, to a subject which was not worthy the at∣tention of any but old women and children." I rose from my seat and bursting into tears, cried, "oh! sir, if these are indeed your sen∣timents they shock me to the soul." "Come girl, come don't cry," said he, pulling me toward him; "you must try to get the better of these superstitious notions, and learn to think and act for yourself, unbiased by the prejudices of others." I could not answer for my tears. He took me in his arms and kissed me; but my soul shrunk back from his embrace. My mother just then passing the window, he left me and went in∣to the garden to join her. I do not like this Mrs. Talbot, so well as I did at first; I saw my father take a liberty with her yester∣day when they thought they were unobserv∣ed. There was an impropriety in it, which made me shudder; and a thought darted across my mind which almost stunned my faculties: surely they cannot be so very abandoned. Oh my poor mother! I fear, this too well explains the cause of your tears and dejection.</P>

<P>It is as I suspected, Mrs. Talbot is an un∣worthy woman. This morning, I arose ear∣lier than common, intending, the weather being sine, to walk into the meadows, before breakfast, passing my mother's chamber door I saw it was partly open; and, looking in, I percieved my dear mother raised upon her elbow in the bed, the tears streaming down her face, and sobbing, as tho' her heart would break. Unable to restrain myself, I rushed into the room and ardently requested to know the cause of her grief. She hastily en∣deavoured to dry her tears and compose her countenance, assured me that nothing parti∣cular was the matter, but that she often was seized with those involuntary fits of weep∣ing, for which she could assign no cause. "Oh! my dear mother," said I, "you cannot thus deceive a child, who loves you as I do. Long have I noticed the anxiety that weighs heavy at your heart, and preys upon your spirits. Can you, do you think your daugh∣ter unworthy to be trusted with your sorrows. Believe me I will treasure them in my bo∣som as a sacred deposit, and having eased your labouring breast of the painful burthen will pour into it the balm of consolation." "My dear girl, my only comforter, said my mother; seek not to know what will only"
<PB N="19" REF="029439_0039_0FE2A046902813F0"/>
make you unhappy, I cannot be more so than I am already, said I, for how is it possible I can be at peace when you are the victim of concealed anguish? "Oh! my child, said she, I cannot explain to you the nature of my sorrows, without acusing one, whom it is your duty to respect, I must not make my child dispise her father;" "I will not de∣spise him, I replied. If he can injure good∣ness like your's I will pity and pardon him, and pray to heaven to turn his heart." But where is my father. He has been out all night said my mother. While you were at Mr. Rowley's yesterday, he went out and has not returned since. Just then I heard a chaise drive up to the door and looking out saw my father alight and hand out Mrs Talbot; the mystery is unravelled said I; "go, said my mother, dry your eyes and appear at breakfast as composed as you can; do not let them have the triumph of seeing how much they distress us. I did as I was desired, but when I entered the breakfast parlour, I felt a glow of indignation flush my cheek, and I could hardly give them the compliments of the morning with any steadiness of accent. Mrs. Talbot fixed her penetrating black eyes up∣on my face; I darted at her a look of anger, she immediately cast them down, turned pale and seemed much agitated; but whether it was with anger or sensibility I cannot determine.</P>

<P>This Mrs. Talbot is a wonderful woman: her conduct is an inexplicable riddle; her cha∣racter undefinable. With some of the finest sentiments that can elevate human nature, and with the power to act up to those senti∣ments', she has sunk herself upon a level the meanest of her sex. I at one and the same moment admire, love, pity and dis∣pise her: but I will inform you of the cause of these contradictory sentiments. Yesterday afternoon as my mother, Mrs. Talbot and myself were at tea, my fa∣ther came in from a walk and throwing a folded paper into Mrs. Talbot's lap, told her he had met with a travelling pedlar and had brought her a present. She unfolded the paper, and seeing a piece of fine chintz, enquired if there was enough for two gowns. "No," said my father, "I bought but one." "Then certainly, Sir, you did not mean it for me; only your politeness leads you to offer it; permit me to resign it to the pro∣per owner," laying it on my mother's knee. "Then, you refuse my present, Kate," said my father sternly. "I do indeed," says she, with firmness, "and am resolved on no ac∣count whatever to accept another obligation at your hands. I have too long forgot what was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to this respectable family, to your honour, and to myself. It is time to amend
<PB N="21" REF="029439_0041_0FE2A04B043D8A70"/>
and fly from errors, which originated in du∣plicity on one side, and weakness on the other. I have wrote to my sister, that I shall leave Woodbine Cot to-morrow, and nothing shall prevent my putting my de∣sign in execution." During the time Mrs. Talbot was speaking, my father stood like one petrefied; my mother's colour went and came alternately red and pale. Indeed I was afraid she would have fainted. At length she assumed sufficient courage to ask with tolerable composure, how long she had formed this resolution, which appeared as sudden as it was unexpected. "Oh! my dear madam," said she, "it is not a sudden resolution, I have long had it in my mind, but always wanted fortitude to execute my resolves; it is much easier to rush into guilt, than to recede from it, and I have long learnt to de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est my own vices without mak∣ing one attempt to eradicate them. This dear young lady has compleated a reforma∣tion, which your gentleness and virtue had begun. Believe me, madam, had I sooner known, how very amiable you were, I should never have injured you; but I was a stran∣ger to your goodness till it was too late to recall my error. When Miss Howard re∣turned from France, it was impossible to be an inmate in the house with her and not love her. From loving virtue in others we
<PB N="22" REF="029439_0042_0FE29F020F30F250"/>
by degrees wish to possess it ourselves; be∣cause we are conscious that without it we cannot be respected or esteemed by the wor∣thy part of mankind. I wished to obtain Miss Howard's friendship; but I knew I was unworthy of the blessing. From that mo∣ment I determined, if I could not merit her esteem, I would at least avoid her displeasure and contempt; but alas!" continued she; "I am too late; she already despises me; and I feel I have not even a claim to her pity."</P>
<P>"For heaven's sake! what does all this mean," said my father, "who dares treat you with contempt, or insult you with their pity?"</P>
<P>"No one, Mr. Howard," she replied calmly; "I only say it is what I have a right to expect; if you remember I told you a few days since that I was determined no longer to lead a life of infamy; you thought me then in jest; perhaps you may think so still; believe me, 'tis of little consequence to me, what opinion you may form of my conduct; I am anxious only to obtain the pardon of these ladies, of whose merits I could wish you to be sensible, before you have inevita∣bly destroyed both their happiness and your own." She then rose from her seat, and
<PB N="23" REF="029439_0043_0FE2A055E52D6CF0"/>
taking one of my mother's hands, and one of mine, pressed them alternately to her lips, and bursting into a fresh flood of tears, left the room. My father followed her, and I heard them speak very high in the adjoining apartment, but could distinguish nothing that past excepting the words, "never whilst I have life," which were pronounced by Mrs. Talbot, as she went up stairs, where she locked herself into her own room. My fa∣ther went immediately out, nor was he re∣turned while I sat up with my mother, who seemed more melancholy than ever, and not inclined for conversation. This morning when we met at breakfast a heavy cloud hung on my father's brow. Mrs. Talbot was not come down. I went up to call her. The door was open. I went into the room; but found, by a letter which lay on the table, that she had left the house at four o'clock in the morning. The cloaths and other pre∣sents, which she had received from my fa∣ther, were packed up in a small trunk and directed for me. In her letter to my mo∣ther, she takes a long adieu, and says there is not the least probability of our ever meet∣ing again, as she should leave England almost immediately. It is impossible to describe the rage of my father, when he found she was really gone. He swore we had treated her ill, or she never would have taken such a re∣solution.
<PB N="24" REF="029439_0044_0FE2A0579634C0E0"/>
In vain we protested our innocence. He vented his rage in the most ungentle∣man-like terms, on my dear patient mo∣ther, who could return nothing but tears. He is now taking his usual walk. I hope, when he returns, he will be calmer. I am weary, my dear Celia, and can write no more. Farewell. May good angels guard you.</P>

<P>I FOUND myself at the conclusion of my last letter, my dear sister, totally unable to continue the subject, which I just hinted to you. I wished you to conceive the whole without descending to particulars, yet how it that possible. At this moment you think me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="25" REF="029439_0045_0FE2A059E081EE10"/>
virtuous, but unfortunate woman; you also think Mr. Howard the most benevolent, most disintersted of men: ah! my dear sis∣ter, how have you been deceived. But to make you understand more perfectly, I must go back to the time when I lost Mr. Talbot.</P>
<P>A stranger in London, alone unconnected with the world, deprived of the means of support by my husband's death. I was re∣volving in my mind what plan to pursue in future; when chance introduced me to Mr. Howard. My dress declared me a widow. He paid me innumerable little attentions, whenever we met at the house of an attorney, with whose lady I was intimate, and at length from having frequently called with my friend, who was employed to settle my late husband's affairs, he assumed the privilege of visiting by himself. To you, who know him so well, I need not describe either the graces of his person, or his insinuating ad∣dress. Perfect master of the art of deception: he conceals under the mask of integrity and honour every vice which can disgrace human nature: with that versatality of temper which makes him appear every thing to every bo∣dy; with the religious he is grave and so∣lemn; with the gay cheerful and affable, with the splenetic he can rail at the vices and
<PB N="26" REF="029439_0046_0FE2A0615C3ACE80"/>
follies of mankind, and with the libertine practice those vices himself: tho' where it is his interest he can appear devout, yet no man ever concieved a more contemptuous opinion of religion, or strove with more diabolical earnestness to corrupt the young and inex∣perienced heart. When first I was introduc∣ed to him, I was told he was a married man. What was my wonder, then, when after a few visits he professed a passion for me. I combated his sophistical arguments as well as my weak reasoning would permit; but alas! I lost ground in every argument. At length he told me as a secret, which nothing but the most violent passion could have extorted from him, that he never did, nor ever could love his wife; that he had married her solely to oblige his father, who was since dead, and that she was a cold, inanimate woman, fit on∣ly for the frigid rules, and solemn rites of a convent. Then with the most solemn asse∣verations, he called heaven to witness that I was the only woman he ever loved; and called down the most heavy maledictions on his head, if he should ever forsake me.</P>
<P>Lucetta, I was infatuated; I thought him the tenderest, best of men, and mourn'd a fate which had united him to a woman he could not love. Poverty and distress sur∣rounded me. Mr. Howard offered a settle∣ment
<PB N="27" REF="029439_0047_0FE2A063544D3078"/>
of fifty pounds a year and to take me into his family, as a relation of his own. My sister, do you now concieve the depth of my shame. I accepted his offer, and a letter was dispatched, to let Mrs. Howard know, he had met with a relation, whose circum∣stances were rather embarrassed and whom he had invited home, as he thought she would prove an agreeable addition to their fa∣mily. The return of post brought such an answer as might be expected from a woman, whose chief study was to please and render her husband happy. When I arrived at Woodbine Cot, Mrs. Howard recieved me with a mixture of politeness and affection. Never shall I forget the sensations, which pervaded my bosom, when entering a neat parlour, she rose to welcome me. Astonish∣ment riveted me to the spot; unable to speak or move, I sunk into the nearest chair, and had nearly fainted. Figure to yourself, my sister, a woman, scarcely thirty years old, ele∣gantly formed, with a countenance animated and prepossessing; her fine blue eyes beam∣ing tenderness on the cruel betrayer of her peace. Think you hear her in accents soft as the music of the spheres, by turns cheer∣ing and comforting the very woman who had robbed her of her husband's affections. And surely then, you will not wonder, if un∣able to stifle my emotions, I gave way to a
<PB N="28" REF="029439_0048_0FE2A064D67F6258"/>
flood of tears. "You are too much affect∣ed, my dear madam," said Mrs. Howard, taking my hand. "Do not I beseech you give way to immoderate grief: when mis∣fortunes are irremidiable it is our duty to submit without repining: but I flatter my∣self, the united attentions of my dear Mr. Howard, and myself, will by degrees restore your tranquility. In the mean time, I hope you will consider yourself at home, and be assured, we shall think ourselves happy in being able in the least to contribute to your case or felicity." She then led me to an ap∣partment, which had been prepared for me, and left me, to that repose which conscious guilt rendered me incapable of enjoying.</P>
<P>The more I knew of this amiable woman, the greater cause I found for admiration and respect. She being naturally of an open disposition, I was in the course of our inti∣macy, made acquainted with the most mate∣rial circumstances of her life: and from her I learnt that she had brought a very hand∣some fortune to Mr. Howard; and that they had married contrary to the advice of their friends on both sides, as they had formed different views for them: but, said she, with a sigh, "We thought love for each other would compensate for the privation of the society of our other friends."</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="029439_0049_0FE2A06658B9A6A0"/>
I had not been long in this family, before I discovered, that I was not the only woman, who shared Mr. Howard's attention. He was neither careful to avoid suspicion, nor deli∣cate in the choice of his companions, as al∣most every female servant in the family, who was not proof against flattering vows and presents of finery, had at some time or other attracted her master's notice. The amiable suffering wife bore all with angelic patience, nor ever once breathed a murmur. I had the satisfaction to find that my remon∣strances had some effect, and he became more circumspect in his behaviour. I could also at any time restrain him from the pur∣suit of any new amour by threatning to leave him, and I flattered myself, that this in some measure attoned to Mrs. Howard for the in∣juries I did her. In this manner I continued in the family near three years, when I found an evident alteration in the conduct of my hostess. Her manner was cold and distant; she often avoided my society and retired to her apartment, where I have surprized her weeping. Conscious guilt would not per∣mit me to enquire the cause of her uneasi∣ness, as I naturally imagined she had disco∣vered my improper intimacy with her hus∣band: but one day while we were at Bristol, I overheard a conversation between them which determined me to quit a life, at once
<PB N="30" REF="029439_0050_0FE110E1FB019358"/>
so repugnant to honour, humanity and re∣ligion. It was one morning, as I was pre∣paring to enter the breakfast room, the door of which was not quite shut, when I heard Mr. Howard in a high key reproaching his wife for not behaving so kindly as formerly to me. I wished to know in what manner Mrs. Howard spoke of me, and therefore de∣scended to the meanness of listening. "My dear, Mr. Howard," said she, "how is it possi∣ble for me to behave with cordiality to a wo∣man who I am well convinced has usurped my place in your affections; and tho' I am wil∣ling acknowledge the many amiable traits in her character, I cannot be blind to that one error, which embitters every hour of my life; nor am I mistress of sufficient dissimu∣lation, to wear the face of friendship where my heart feels only dislike, nay almost dis∣gust. I will not scruple to confess, I once did esteem her: but pardon the expression, if I say, the heart that loves virtue for its own sake, can never form acquaintance with vice. We may pity, but we must despise."</P>

the husband of my affections, I have promised to love, to honour, and obey you, and heaven is my witness, I never have failed in one of those points: to cease to love you is impossible; to obey you is the pleasure of my life: but, pardon me, if your own con∣duct has forced me unwillingly to own, I can no longer honour you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> peace has been broken by your ill humour, my fortune dissipated by your extravagance, nay lavished on the most disolute of my sex, until your family is reduced to the most mortifying cir∣cumstances: my child, my beloved Meriel obliged to be educated far from me; because her father's morals were too vitiated to be a proper object for the contemplation of a young and innocent mind."</P>
<P>Here she wept, and Mr. Howard not being able to make a just defence, flew into a vio∣lent passion, as was his usual custom, swore she was a most unaccountable woman, and wondered at his own patience in bearing with her so long. This undeserved reproach awakened her stifled passion, and she answered with intrepidity.</P>
<P>"No, sir, it is my patience is to be wonder∣ed at, but do not irritate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> beyond the possi∣bility of submitting any longer, I fear I have been wrong in so long bearing my injuries in

silence; perhaps, you think, because I ap∣peared blind to your immoral conduct, I countenanced it. Let me undeceive you. Mrs. Talbot should not so long have remain∣ed under the same roof with me, had I not feared, that by depriving her of an asylum, I should injure her reputation and drive her into an inhuman world, where one false step is never forgiven, and she might have sunk into the lowest abyss of vice and infamy. I flattered myself my gentleness might have reclaimed her. I knew, alas! too well, the inconstancy of your nature, and had deter∣mined that when forsaken by you, she should not want a friend to snatch her from ever∣lasting ruin."</P>
<P>I was so overcome by this generous decla∣ration, that I was forced to catch hold of the ballustrade of the stairs, to prevent fall∣ing. A sudden sickness came over me, and I could not distinctly hear the remainder of their conversation; but, thank heaven, I profited so much from what I had heard, that I resolved no longer, by my presence, to wound a heart so replete with benevolence toward me. I did not enter the par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our; but returned to my own apartment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and, sending an apology for not appearing at breakfast, revolved in my own mind a varie∣ty of schemes, for my future subsistence; but
<PB N="33" REF="029439_0053_0FE110F095E76C00"/>
could think on nothing that appeared in the least probable of success. That afternoon Miss Howard arrived from France. Had my mind been ever so depraved it must have returned to virtue after an acquaintance with this dear girl; I therefore became more firm in my resolves; and having formed an acquaintance with an elderly lady, of whose sense and goodness of heart I had a very high opinion; I determined to disclose eve∣ry particular of my situation to her, and ask her advice in what manner I should proceed. She heard me with attention, and was friend∣ly enough not to attempt to paliate my er∣rors. She placed my conduct in a proper light and encouraged the remorse which was already awakened in my bosom. She then opened a scene of comfort to my distressed imagination, and having advised me to re∣turn with the family to Woodbine Cot, to prevent any ill natured remarks among our acquaintance, and afterwards to pursue the plan which she had laid down. Yet, will you believe it, when I returned to this place I felt my resolution slacken, and found I was relapsing into my former errors; but this morning the dear amiable Meriel has awak∣ened my sleeping conscience, and I am de∣termined to leave the family immediately. I went into the garden after breakfast and found her weeping in a little arbour. "In
<PB N="34" REF="029439_0054_0FE110F472C67578"/>
tears, my dear little girl," said I. "Have I not cause for tears," she replied, "is not my beloved mother unhappy?"</P>
<P>"Unhappy!" said I, with an accent of surprise, willing to try if she was acquainted with the cause.</P>
<P>She fixed her expressive eyes on my face, and replied emphatically; "surely I need not tell you, Mrs. Talbot, that she is very unhappy; for you profess yourself her friend, and friendship is quick sighted in discerning the sorrows of the person esteemed: true friendship is also eagerly anxious to remove the cause of grief from the bosom of those they love, though by so doing, they plant a thorn in their own."</P>
<P>I could not answer her; I did not even attempt it; but pressing her hand in silence retired to another part of the garden.</P>
<P>On Tuesday morning, at four o'clock, I shall expect you will send a man and horse for me. I shall come but poorly provided with cash, as I am resolved to leave my set∣tlement behind me, as likewise every present of value, which I have received. I will not impoverish the family which I have already irreparably injured. But do not think I shall
<PB N="35" REF="029439_0055_0FE110FBA087D1E0"/>
come to throw myself on you for support. No, my sister, I have the abilities necessary to earn my subsistence, and they shall be exert∣ed. I shall stay only one night with you, and then proceed to my kind friend at Bristol. As to the remainder of my plan, if I succeed to my wish, you shall again hear from me; if not, I shall sink at once into total oblivion. Farewell, my sister, forget my errors; re∣member only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> penitence, and let me share your prayers, that it may be sincere and lasting.</P>

<P>MY father is more composed, than I could imagine possible in the absence of Mrs. Talbot; but he is still gloomy and unsocial with my mother; however, I cannot but flatter myself that time, and her unweari∣ed assiduities, will regain his affections; and was that to be the happy result of her pati∣ence and forbearance, how great would be our felicity.</P>
<P>Miss Dolly Pringle has just called to soli∣cit my mother's leave for my drinking tea with her. It is but seldom I am permitted to go without the boundaries of our garden, except to accompany my father or mother in a retired walk; but for a wonder, I am this afternoon to be trusted unaccompanied by either. I cannot think what my father is afraid of, that he should be so averse in
<PB N="37" REF="029439_0057_0FE11104189C6E28"/>
my taking any kind of innocent recreation. I am sure, if I know my own heart, I have no improper wishes lurking there; yet he is always saying such strange things about love and lovers that it seems he would be angry if a man was only to speak civil to me. Dolly knew this odd way of his, and so did not tell him that her brother was expected to come from London for a few days, and most likely would arrive this afternoon. "I am sure," said she to me, "you will like Harry vastly, and if he is not smitten, I shall be surprised. Pray Miss," continued she, "were you never in love?"</P>
<P>"In love," said I; "really I don't right∣ly comprehend what you mean by the word."</P>
<P>"La! that is vastly odd; but never mind my dear; half an hour's conversation with my brother will explain it better than I could in a whole day."</P>
<P>"But why Miss Pringle, must your bro∣ther talk to me of love; I should suppose there were many more interesting subjects."</P>
<P>"La! Miss," she replied something tart∣ly, "you talk like a child I think; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> what should a gallant young man say to a
<PB N="38" REF="029439_0058_0FE1110978CE4450"/>
beautiful young lady, but that he adored her; or when did you ever read of a young gentleman being left to entertain a lady, for half an hour, but he fell at her feet, called her a divinity, and vowed to love her while the vital fluid warmed his heart."</P>
<P>"Bless me!" said I, "I declare I never read such a thing in my life."</P>
<P>"Surely then," she replied with a look of surprise; "you never read the divine history of lady Frances and lady Caroline, or the loves of Edward and Harriet?" "No, in∣deed," said I, "I have never even heard of them."</P>
<P>"Oh! my dear girl, then," cried she, in a sort of extasy; "you have a pleasure to come, of which at present you can form no idea: I will lend you the books; but you must not let your father see them."</P>
<P>And that you may believe me Celia, I shall not; for he is always ready enough to abridge me of any thing that can afford me pleasure. As to my dear mother, I am sure she will gratify every laudable wish of my heart; and sure if Miss Pringle has reciev∣ed so much pleasure in the perusal of them, they cannot be improper books; at any rate,
<PB N="39" REF="029439_0059_0FE1110ECD066D48"/>
when one hears a great deal about a thing, one naturally longs to see it. But after all it appears to me very odd that a man and▪ woman cannot converse together without making love: I think it is a very foolish <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and in my opinion a very fallacious one; for now I remember, Mr. Verdome travelled all the way from Bologne with me, and ne∣ver said a syllable about love or adoration. To be sure Mr. Verdome is almost fifty years old; but I should not suppose that would make any great difference.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 8<HI>th.</HI></P>
<P>Well, to be sure I do begin to be a little better pleased with the society of our neigh∣bours than I was at first; indeed I feel my heart much lighter since Mrs. Talbot left us, for I see my dear mother looks happier; and if she is happy I shall be so too. I spent a very agreeable evening at Mrs. Pringle's, whose son arrived, just as we had sat down to tea; I thought him a very pleasing young man. He is an ensign in the army, and has a military, manly countenance. I know not how it was, but whether from what Dolly had said in the morning, or whe∣ther from my not being accustomed to the society of men; yet I felt myself awkward and embarressed; however, as Mr. Pringle
<PB N="40" REF="029439_0060_0FE1111142BD89C0"/>
did not say any thing particular, I soon re∣covered myself, tho' when Mrs. Pringle and her daughter left the room for a few mo∣ments, I was frightened to death lest he should make love to me, and you know, if he had I should not have known what to say to him. This fear, I am sure, made me look like a fool; for I felt my face glow like scarlet. I dare say he thought me an idiot; well, it is of little consequence to me what he thought: only you know one don't like strangers to form an unjust opinion of our mental faculties.</P>
<P>Miss Pringle lent me the books which she promised: I did not dare to read any be∣fore I went to bed, as my father often walks round the house to see if all the lights are out; and if he had caught me reading, he would have immediately taken the books from me, for he has lately taken it into his head that I read too much, and that I shall be good for nothing, if I am suffered to pore so much over a parcel of musty old au∣thors. So, I locked up my new acquisitions in my closet, and arose two hours earlier this morning to peruse it. Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly, Celia, these young ladies who write so much, and so prettily to each other, must be very amiable and lovely, for you must know the whole book is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> letters, it is indeed a charming
<PB N="41" REF="029439_0061_0FE11116FB6D2280"/>
history; you cannot think how much I cried whilst I was reading. Surely, said I, at one time, it must be a sad thing to be in love; and yet unhappy as it makes many, every body seems to be affected with this strange passion; it appears to be their whole business. But my father is gone to walk and my mother retired to her apartment, which she does almost every afternoon; so, I may now snatch an hour or two to read a little more.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 9<HI>th.</HI></P>
<P>Well, Celia, would you believe it, after having cried myself almost blind about the the distresses of the dear ladies, whose histo∣ry I have been reading, I was agreeably sur∣prised to find, in the end, all parties were made happy. I declare I was very much de∣lighted, and cannot say but I should like to go into more company, and see a little more of life; for then perhaps I should meet with some such charming women as lady Frances and lady Caroline. Celia, I might also be admired by some fine gentleman, as they were; for I find country girls are as much engaged with love and lovers as the great ladies. I wish I could convey these books to you; or that you could get some just like them. Perhaps these were the kind my fa∣ther
<PB N="42" REF="029439_0062_0FE1111A72D559F8"/>
meant, when he talked about romances and novels; but yet that cannot be, as this is a real history, the characters drawn from life. Miss Pringle has promised to lend me some more of the same sort, and some plays; so I think I shall pass my time much more agreeably than before; tho' do not think I mean to neglect those authors our dear sister Constance so strenuously recom∣mended to my notice. No, no, my friend, I will not neglect the useful studies of history, geography, and far more neces∣sary duty of public and private devotion; and now I am on the subject of devotion, I must just mention something in my father's cha∣racter, which is to me unaccountable. Tho' he talked to me in the profane stile I have related in a former letter, yet to my mother and the families who visit us, he pretends to have a high veneration for religion and reli∣gious subjects, and as we live a considerable distance from the church, he makes a prac∣tice of reading the morning service to the fa∣mily; tho' perhaps the moment he has closed the prayer book, should the most trifling thing happen to ruffle his temper, he will burst in∣to fits of ungovernable rage, and swear in such a horrible manner, that I shudder to hear him. There is a little boy, whom he has taken into the family, and whom he takes great pains to teach his catechism, &amp;c.
<PB N="43" REF="029439_0063_0FE1112057F16500"/>
I have seen him whip the poor lad unmerci∣fully for innocently humming a song tune on a Sunday morning, when he himself lives in the constant breach of almost every duty the christian religion lays days down for our ob∣servation and direction. Are not these in∣consistencies, Celia? Surely the father of children, the master of a family, should set a good example, or he can never expect others to attend to duties he so evidently appears to disregard.</P>
<P>My dear old nurse, Deborah, arrived yes∣terday, from a visit she has been paying her friends ever since our return from the con∣tinent. She enquired when I had heard from you; desires you will not forget her. Of this I assured her, she need not be afraid. Her return is another source of comfort to me, as my mother says she shall continue in the family as long as she pleases, and you know the affection I have contracted for her, from her attendance on me the whole time I was abroad, indeed I consider her almost in a maternal light, her fidelity and attach∣ment to our family has been ever unshaken.</P>
<P>Miss Pringle called this afternoon, and we walked in the garden together near an hour, during which time she told me her brother was greatly struck with my person,
<PB N="44" REF="029439_0064_0FE1112501845610"/>
and that he had told his mother, if he thought I would return his passion, he should immediately relinquish the idea he had formed of marrying a woman, to whom the whole family had the greatest dislike, as she was ignorant, low born and without for∣tune. "How happy shall I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my dear Miss Howard," said she, "to call you sister."</P>
<P>"Bless me," said I, "how can you talk so, you know I must not think of listening to a lover without my father's permission."</P>
<P>"Your father indeed," cried she laughing, "I wonder what your dear little simple head will fancy next: why child, he would forbid me the house if he only suspected such a thing; and you know my dear Meriel," (she continned in a soft soothing accent) "you know, we are bosom friends and sworn sisters and it would be very hard, you know, to be separated, perhaps forever."</P>
<P>"Indeed Miss Pringle," said I, "my heart feels grateful for the friendship you profess for me, and I should be very sorry to be deprived of your society."</P>
<P>"Well, then my dear," said she, "take this letter and don't let either your father or your mother see it." I would have refused
<PB N="45" REF="029439_0065_0FE1112A6F3EE8E0"/>
the letter, as I feared it would be improper to take it; but my father just then entering the garden, I dreaded his anger which is awakened at the most insignificant trifles, and is always impetuous: so I hastily put it in my pocket.</P>
<P>When we returned to the house and Miss Pringle was gone, he cried pettishly to my another; "what does that girl do so often here? I shall have Meriel spoiled by her nonsensical chatter; besides I will lay a gui∣nea there is an intrigue of some sort contriving between them; I never knew two girls al∣lowed to be so much together but they hatched mischief." "If you do not like Dolly Pringle," replied my mother, "we will try to drop her acquaintance, but you must consider, Mr. Howard, Meriel must have some society." "Why, pray what so∣ciety would she have," said he, "are not you always with her, and has she not plenty of needle work to do? let her stick close to that, and she won't want to be gadding and gossiping: she is at present a stranger to the world, and the less she knows of it the bet∣ter." This unkindness does not grieve me as it would if I loved him; but it gives me pain to see how much it affects my mother. I sat down to supper in silence, and when it was finished, retired as usual to my own
<PB N="46" REF="029439_0066_0FE1112E0E30B890"/>
room, where I haistily broke the seal of my letter, and found it wrote in such a charm∣ing style, so tender, so lively, I read it over half a dozen times, but could not determine whether to answer it or not. Good night Celia, it is eleven o'clock, and I dare not write a moment longer.</P>

<P>I HAVE been very unhappy, Celia, since I wrote last; indeed I did not know whe∣ther I should be permitted to write to you again: nor could I now enjoy that satisfac∣tion if good Deborah had not procured <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pens, ink, and some paper; which she <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on conditions of seeing all I wrote; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="47" REF="029439_0067_0FE1113365303F98"/>
have left my bed at the early hour of four, to pour forth my complaints to my dear Celia. In my last I told you I had reciev∣ed a letter from Mr. Pringle, declaring him∣self my lover: I will own I was very much pleased with it. Tho' at first I hesitated to answer it, yet, when I read a few more books, which Miss Dolly Pringle sent me by means of our dairy maid, and I found that none of the young ladies mentioned in them ever hesitated at answering their lover's letters; I ventured to write a few lines in reply to one which he sent me requesting me to meet him one night after the family were in bed, and in which he told me, Lettice the maid would come and let me know, when all was quiet in the house, and that she would go with me to the place he had appointed for our meeting. Indeed, Celia, I did not think any harm; so I wrote and told him if his sis∣ter would come with him, I would meet him, for I wished very much to see Dolly, and I knew I should not have another opportunity very soon.</P>
<P>When we met, his manner was so tender, his language so pathetic, and the tender at∣tentions of his sister so like what I had read, that I could not help confessing that I pitied him, and that if it would in the least alleviate his suffering, I would meet him there again.
<PB N="48" REF="029439_0068_0FE11135EE6067F0"/>
We went on thus for some time, when over∣powered one evening by his entreaties, I con∣sented to go with him to London, where he promised to marry me. Dear, dear, Celia, I tremble even now, when I think of what fol∣lowed. The next day we had just done break∣fast, when an elderly gentleman who has a great regard for my father and mother called, and telling the latter he had something very particular to say to her, they walked to∣gether into the garden. When they returned, I saw my dear mother, oh! I shall never for∣get it, I saw her look extremely angry, her eyes darted at me such indignant glances, that my very soul felt humbled within me, I could have fallen at her feet and intreated to know the cause of her anger: for indeed, Celia, I did not think, if she had even dis∣covered my correspondence with young Prin∣gle, that she would have been so very much offended, especially as I could appeal for a precedent, to the conduct of so many amiable young ladies of even rank and fortune. But the moment Mr. Sutten was gone, she asked me in a tone that rent my very heart, how I dared either to receive or write letters with∣out her knowledge. Her anger overpowered me; something rose in my throat and pre∣vented my speaking, I thought I should have died with sorrow, when she thus continued, "Unkind, ungenerous Meriel, thus to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="49" REF="029439_0069_0FE1113BAFA78DF0"/>
the confidence your mother had placed in you. How, degenerate girl, have you dared to violate the laws of female delicacy, by openly avowing a passion for a man to whom you are almost a stranger, and even to make yourself ridiculous by writing such letters to him as renders you the jest of the whole village." "Oh! my dear mother," said I in a voice almost choaked with sobs; "indeed I did not think any harm." "Perhaps, Meri∣el," said she, "had you stopped here, I might have forgiven you: but know, false disem∣bling girl, I have discovered all your illicit plans, you have left your father's house at hours, when modesty would have shrunk to venture out, without a proper protector: and, to compleat your imprudence, this very night you had designed to quit a mother, whom you have pretended to love and re∣spect, and to throw yourself intirely into the power of a wretch, who regards you only as a vehicle, thro' which he may come at the possession of your fortune."</P>
<P>I fell at her feet and would have taken her hand; but she snatched it from me, and and rising from her seat left me weeping on the ground.</P>
<P>"Unworthy girl," said she, as she left the room, "go hide yourself from my sight, for
<PB N="50" REF="029439_0070_0FE1113E9E6AE168"/>
you are become odious to me. Never, never, child, can you regain the confidence you have lost. I had flattered myself with find∣ing in you a comforter and tender filial friend; but you have added another wound to a heart already lacerated by many sor∣rows."</P>
<P>When my mother was gone, I laid my head upon a chair and continued weeping. In this position my father found me. "So, Miss," said he, sternly, "I find you were for providing a husband for yourself; you were resolved to lose no time; but pray what will you say when I tell you this fine lover of your's is already married and has been so these two years."</P>
<P>"Married, sir" cried I, raising my head.</P>
<P>"Yes child, married, though his friends were unacquainted with it, but this morning I hear his wife is arrived from London, with one child, to solicit that support which he has inhumanly refused her." I made no answer, but returning my head to its reclin∣ing posture, continued weeping without in∣termission. "Ah! my poor little Meriel," said he, in a tone of voice more soft than usual, "I am afraid this naughty man has made great havock with your heart; but,
<PB N="51" REF="029439_0071_0FE111444171A100"/>
come, come, you shall not wear the willow long, we will find another lover for you soon."</P>
<P>"Indeed, sir, you mistake the cause of my tears," said I. "It is not the loss of all the lovers in the world would grieve me half so much as the fear of having forever for∣feited my dear mother's affection."</P>
<P>"Well, well," he replied, "don't let that vex you; if she is unkind, I will endea∣vour to attone for it. To be sure, she is ve∣ry rigid in her notions, but I dare say, when she sees you heartily repent your fault, she will overlook it and love you as well as ever."</P>
<P>He then left me, and I retired to my apartment, where Deborah told me my mo∣ther had been, and had carried all my pens, ink and paper away with her. Ever since she has been cold, distant, nay almost un∣kind. Oh! my dear friend, what shall I do to regain her affection, and convince her my repentance is sincere. Indeed, she is to me the dearest object upon earth, and her hap∣piness shall henceforth be my only study.</P>
<P>My father, when my mother is present, treats me with equal rigour; but, when we
<PB N="52" REF="029439_0072_0FE11146A9C33538"/>
are alone, he is more gentle. Once or twice he has come to my apartment when she was out, and even brought me some books; among which were some French novels. Even my brother has heard of my impru∣dence, and has wrote to my mother, enquir∣ing the truth of the report; but he does not write as if he wished it false. I do not think he loves me; he had expected a legacy from Mrs. Mirvan, but the whole of her fortune being left to me, has created envy and jea∣lousy in a bosom, which I had once flattered myself I should find warm with friendly and fraternal love: and yet, Celia, if he did but know my heart, he would see he had no cause to envy me, except he should envy those delightful sensations which I shall feel when I come to the possession of my fortune, in saying, brother, it is equally your's, com∣mand it to its utmost extent.</P>
<P>Deborah has promised me to get this let∣ter conveyed to the nearest post town. When you write, direct under cover to Mrs. Debo∣rah Ellis, to remain at the office till called for, I dare not let my mother know I corres∣pond with any one, least she should discover by what means I got the materials for writ∣ing, and poor Deborah would suffer for her affectionate indulgence.

<SALUTE>DEAR MISS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HOPE, you will pardon this freedom in a poor old woman, who is almost bro∣ken hearted, at an accident which has dis∣tracted the whole family. I hardly know how to tell you, because I know you loved and valued my dear young lady; and so indeed must every one who knew her merits, tho' since she has returned from France, I have heard her ridiculed for virtues which
<PB N="54" REF="029439_0074_0FE1114EE53AF1E0"/>
few, if any, endeavoured to imitate; and have seen her drawn into errors, by those who, envying the superior qualities of her heart, endeavoured to bring her more on a level with themselves. She shewed me the last letter she wrote to you; for it was only on condition of seeing all she wrote, that I supplied her with the means of following her favourite amusement. The sternness of her mother still continued; and the poor young lady was abridged of the pleasure of even walking beyond the limits of her fa∣ther's garden. Mr. Howard's conduct, towards the dear girl, was altogether un∣accountable, sometimes harsh, unfeelingly reproaching her for her intended error; a method, in my poor humble opinion, by no means calculated to lead her to renounce the attachment, which hurried her to so impro∣per a step. At other times, he turned the whole affair into ridicule, and conversed with his daughter in a gay familiar manner; but tho' she trembled at his anger, she never ex∣pressed any satisfaction in his company when good humoured; but rather wished to in∣dulge in solitude and study. About ten days since my mistress was sent for, into Essex, to a relation, who was extremely ill. Mr. Howard did not accompany her: she set off in the afternoon, and he having procured a chaise took Miss Meriel out for a ride, an
<PB N="55" REF="029439_0075_0FE1115480D6A920"/>
indulgence she had never experienced since her residence at this place. When she re∣turned she seemed very melancholy, and said her spirits were much oppressed, and her mind harrassed with terrors, for which she could by no means account. She supped with her father and retired at her usual hour. Mr. Howard sat up much later than common, and to my great surprise, when I carried in his candle, he seemed intoxicated, tho' he had been alone and seldom gave way to excessive drinking, unless he had been led into it by company. I heard him go in∣to his apartment, and then went to bed my∣self, where the fatigue of the day soon made me fall asleep. About two o'clock I was awakened by Miss Howard, who in a shiver∣ing voice asked me if I had not heard a noise in her chamber, said, she was greatly frightened, and would, if I pleased, stay the remainder of the night with me. I helped her into bed; she was cold as death, trem∣bled excessivly, and soonfell into a convulsive hysteric fit. Greatly alarmed, I called up one of my fellow servants, and by repeated applications of hartshorn, vinegar, &amp;c. brought her to herself; she would give no account of the cause of her fright; but seem∣ed to mourn some heavy misfortune, and re∣peatedly wished herself with you in the con∣vent again. She rested but little all night,
<PB N="56" REF="029439_0076_0FE1115801BFC4E8"/>
and the next morning was so indisposed as to be unable to rise, and was confined to her room for several succeeding days. One day after she had ventured down stairs; I asked leave to go a few miles, on some par∣ticular business, where I was detained all night, by reason of a violent storm. Rising early in the morning, and walking home be∣fore any of the family but the house maids was stirring, I went up immediately to see how my dear Miss Meriel was, for I had been very uneasy about her all night, know∣ing she was terrified at thunder, and would not dare to express her fears to her father, who would only have ridiculed them. On entering the room I was alarmed to find the bed in great disorder; many of her cloaths laying about the floor, the window open, and my beloved Miss Howard gone. Ob∣serving the sheets fastened to the bed-post, I naturally imagined she must have slid by them into the garden, and looking out at the window I saw one of her shoes lay on the ground. Convinced now, of what be∣fore I had only conjectured, I gave a scream of terror which alarmed my master, who came half dressed, pale and trembling into the room, exclaiming, "for God's sake what is the noise about." "My young lady, sir," said I, pointing to the window. "Elop∣ed," said he, "with that villain, Pringle; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="57" REF="029439_0077_0FE1115D1F8AEF98"/>
here I sware never again to suffer"—"Oh, sir!" cried I eagerly, "do not sware to re∣nounce her; I'd venture my life upon her innocence; I am sure some vile means have been used to draw her thus from her duty."</P>
<P>"She is a little hypocrite, nurse," said he, "and will make herself friends wherever she goes, till she is found out. I suppose she will trump up some fine story about ill usage, or some devilish thing or other. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to my soul she had never left the convent; this will go near to break her mother's heart."</P>
<P>About noon Mrs. Howard returned. It is impossible to describe her anguish when in∣formed of her daughter's absence (I will not say elopement) because I am sure, if the truth was known, it would not deserve so harsh an appellation. She sent immediately to Mrs. Pringle's, where she heard that the young gentleman went away, as he said, to join his regiment the afternoon before. Thus does this unlucky circumstance tend to make it universally believed, that Miss Howard and Mr. Pringle are together; but, indeed Miss, I do not think that is the case; for, certain I am, that a purer heart never inhabited a hu∣man bosom, and that she never would have thought of eloping with a married man: be∣sides, I am convinced she was not greatly at∣tached to him. He was the first man who had
<PB N="58" REF="029439_0078_0FE111611A553DD0"/>
ever addressed her; she is the pure child of un∣disguised nature, and being pleased with his attentions which had the charm of novelty to recommend them; she fancied herself in love; but after her conduct had been placed in a proper light, by her mother, she seemed perfectly convinced of her error, and often used to say, she wondered how she could imagine she loved a man, of whom she knew so little. "I should think, nurse," said she one day, "that this unfortunate affair in the end would be greatly beneficial to me, as it will make me, in future, distrust the emotions of my heart, and be upon my guard against its deceptions; but I fear it has irreparably in∣jured me in the opinion of my mother; but I must endeavour, by my future conduct, to regain her confidence, and in the mean time, submit with patience to that displeasure I am certain I have in a great measure deserved." Such sentiments as these, madam, do not ar∣gue a depravity of heart. Oh! no, my sweet Meriel is at this moment as free from guilt as an angel. Three days are now elapsed since her departure, during which time no tidings can be gained concerning her. Oh! Miss, I fear we shall never see the dear creature again: some dreadful mystery is certainly concealed by her thus abruptly leaving her father's house. Would to hea∣ven I had the means of clearing it up, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="59" REF="029439_0079_0FE111669C8869B0"/>
at the same time removing the cloud which at present obscures the reputation of the most innocent young lady that ever existed. I will not finish this letter till to-morrow. If we hear no tidings then, I shall give her up as lost forever.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 25<HI>th.</HI></P>
<P>I just snatch up my pen to inform you, dear Miss, that Miss Howard is found, and is at present in her father's house; but in such a situation that we have little hope of her ever recovering her senses sufficient to give any regular account of the cause of her flight, of this we are certain, she was not with Mr. Pringle.</P>
<P><HI>July</HI> 28<HI>th.</HI></P>
<P>I am now sitting by my poor young lady's bed side, who is just fallen into a sweet re∣freshing sleep, and shall seize this opportu∣nity to inform you, in what manner she was discovered and conducted home. A farmer who lives about five miles from hence, at the skirt of a wood, having occasion for his horse to be brought from pasture early in the morning, ordered a lad who lived as a ser∣vant with him, to go by four o'clock and fetch it: the lad's way lay thro' the wood, and when he returned he declared he had been
<PB N="60" REF="029439_0080_0FE1116BB880F358"/>
frightened almost to death by an apparition of a woman, dressed all in white, whom he saw sitting at the foot of a tree as he went; that he heard her sigh and groan, and said he supposed it was the spirit of Fanny Summers, who hung herself there last autumn, and he was the more positive of this, as at his return, he saw her walking too and fro with a child in her arms and heard her talk to it. The farmer laughed at the lad's tale, and rode away without paying any farther attention to it, but a young gentleman who has a lodg∣ings at the farmers, on account of an ill state of health, having over heard the boy's story, determined to rise immediately and go to the wood to investigate the matter farther, as he supposed it might be some unfortunate human creature, rather than a supernatural being; and determined, if in his power, to rescue her from misery, and, what ap∣peared more than probable, a horrid and un∣timely end. He had not penetrated far into the wood before he discovered, at the foot of an old oak, a female form stretched on the ground, and by her side a little spaniel, whose head lay on the woman's arm, and who at frequent intervals seemed to make most pi∣tious moans. He approached and found the unfortunate female was in a fit, he gently raised her from the ground, supporting her in his arms whilst he chaffed her temples with
<PB N="61" REF="029439_0081_0FE1117163BAFCE8"/>
volatiles, which, on account of his own weak constitution, he always carried in his pocket. While he was thus employed, the dog fawn∣ed upon him licked his hand and shewed every token of gratitude in his power; at length the lady began to move, and her pre∣server hearing the voices of labourers passing through the wood, hallowed to the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> for as∣sistance. When they came near, the dog flew from his mistress to one of them, leaping, bounding and howling for joy. What Lu∣bin, said the clown, how come you here, then drawing nearer to help support the lady; he started back and cried, body o'me, 'tis Miss Meriel, poor dear soul, how could she get here, as sure as any thing she has been robbed and murdered. Almost smiling at the fellow's stupidity, the young gentleman bid him cease his wonder and as∣sist in bearing her to the farm which was the nearest house. The dear creaure never spoke during the whole time, indeed she seemed totally incapable of uttering a word, when they got her to the house she drank a few spoonfulls of milk, which somewhat revived her, but her voice was still so weak they were unable to distinguish what she said, and her eyes too plainly indicated that her mind was disturbed, the good woman of the house had her put immediately to bed, and Isaac the labourer came home to let his master and
<PB N="62" REF="029439_0082_0FE11175A9989AF8"/>
mistress know were their daughter was. When he told the melancholy tale, Mrs. Howard clasped her hands and cried, my child deprived of her senses! she had not time for more, for Mr. Howard had fallen on the floor in a fit. I cannot account for this violent emotion in a man, who had ne∣ver shewn any great degree of tenderness towards his child, but I think I never saw the fondest parent more affected.</P>
<P>When the family became tolerably com∣posed, it was proposed that I should take a chaise and proceed to the farm, when if Miss Howard was able to bear the motion of the carriage, I was to conduct her home; if not, to remain with her; and her mother would come to her in the morning. When I arrived at the farm, and was shewn into the room where my dear young lady was; my agitation was so great I thought I should have died; she had on being first put to bed fallen into a little doze, but soon started and awoke in great terror, and finding herself undressed, screamed out, "oh heavens! I am betrayed, I am lost, he is here; I know he is here, and I will not stay another mo∣ment." She then insisted on being dressed. The neighbouring apothecary had been pre∣viously sent for; he felt her pulse and de∣clared that the disorder lay entirely on her
<PB N="63" REF="029439_0083_0FE1117B04187640"/>
spirits; that every nerve seemed convulsed, and she also appeared to be greatly weaken∣ed for want of proper sustenance. She was prevailed on to eat a bit of bread, and drink a little weak wine and water; after which she became a little more composed, and had sunk into a profound sleep on the side of the bed. In this situation I found her; the faithful Lubin laying on a chair that stood by the bed side, his head stretched out to the pillow of his mistress, whom he had not quitted for a moment since her entrance into the house. This dog had been missing ever since Miss Howard's absence, but our minds had been occupied by thoughts of so much more distressing a nature that Lubin was hardly remembered; he was greatly at∣tached to her from her first return, and she remarkably fond of him. I sat down silent∣ly on the side of the bed, and looked at her dear countenance which so lately wore the bloom of youth and the smile of innocent chearfulness: alas! how changed, deadly pale where her cheeks and lips, and only that I percieved she breathed, I should have thought she was no longer an inhabitant of this world; my tears flowed plentifully. Her sleep, tho' apparantly sound, was not of long continuance; she shrieked, awoke, and immediately started off the bed; I caught her hand, she turned hastily round. "Oh! it is
<PB N="64" REF="029439_0084_0FE1117DCB43A2F0"/>
you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is it, well now we will go. If you will accompany me, say so at once, if not I must go without you; for I cannot stay here another moment. But where is he now," looking wildly round her, "Who are you talking of my dear," said I, tender∣ly. "Ah! there is the thing now, I thought you would want to know his name, but I cannot tell you nurse, so do not ask me; I have made a vow, a solemn sacred vow, ne∣ver to wound the peace of my dear, adored, mother." "But my dear creature you have almost broken her heart by thus flying from her protection and your father." "Father," said she, "have I a father? Oh! that I had never been born." She then began to rave in a most incoherent manner, and de∣clared she would not stay another moment in the house. I took this opportunity with the permission of the apothecary to convey her home: when the chaise stopped at the door she looked out, and clapping her hand to her forehead, cried "yes I see how it is, well, well, it will not be long before I am released, and till then, I must be patient." I assisted her in alighting, she leaned on my arm and walked slowly into the house; Mrs. Howard was so overcome she was unable to rise from her seat. Meriel looked for a moment at her attentively, then shaking her head in a most sorrowful manner, she
<PB N="65" REF="029439_0085_0FE11183E33EEB30"/>
cried, "oh! I see I have afflicted you, but, alas! my own heart is overwhelmed with sorrow; and then when I think for a moment, there are some remembrances which must be ever buried in my heart, that torture me so, my brain seems on fire." Mrs. Howard attempt∣ed to speak, but unequal to the task, she clasped her hands in an agony, and sobbed aloud: Meriel sunk on her knees before her, took both her hands, put them first to her head and then to her heart; and breath∣ing a deep sigh, fell lifeless on the floor. We had her immediately conveyed to bed, where she soon recovered; but a violent fever come on, and she continued raving all night. Mr. Howard has not yet seen her, he says if the girl's spirits are in such perturbation, the sight of him, whom she must be conscious she has offended, would only irritate them more, when she is better I will see her, said he, and forgive her, that will calm and com∣fort her.</P>
<P>A physician was sent for; he said quiet and tenderness from those about her are the chief things requisite to restore her. In the mean time, my dear madam, said he, I will send her a composing draught; if when she recovers the use of her reason, you can pre∣vail with her to unburthen her mind, which, I am certain labours with some painful se∣cret,
<PB N="66" REF="029439_0086_0FE1118657508568"/>
it would greatly assist and hasten her recovery.</P>
<P>Thus far, my dear Miss, have I given you an account of this mysterious affair. What to think of her sudden departure, and being found in such a shocking situation, we are all totally at a loss. It appears she has been terrified and extremely ill used by somebody; but even in the most violent paroxisms of her delirium, she has never mentioned his name. I have one thought that haunts me continually; but that is so horrible I dare not commit it to paper. Indeed, it is too dreadful, too shocking to human nature, to wear even the face of probability.</P>
<P>The medicines prescribed have taken the desired effect, and she has been in a composed sleep above three hours. I will not conclude till I can inform you how she appears on awaking, as I know your affection for her will make you extremely anxious.</P>
<P>She awoke tolerably calm, instantly recol∣lected where she was, but did not seem to retain any idea of the late unhappy events. "It is late, nurse," said she, addressing her∣self to me "is it not time to get up," then pausing a moment, "I have had such a hor∣rid dream. Oh! I would not pass such an∣other
<PB N="67" REF="029439_0087_0FE1118C1006B8E0"/>
night:" she then attempted to rise; but finding herself extremely weak, she con∣tinued, "what is the matter; have I been ill?" "Yes, my love," said I, "you have been very ill, and are far from well now." "Then perhaps it was not a dream," said she, putting her hand to her forehead, as if try∣ing to recollect; she was silent for a few mo∣ments, then caught hold my hand, and bursting into tears, she cried, "alas! it was all a reality."</P>
<P>I did not attempt to stop her tears, as I thought they would relieve her. She asked for her mother; seemed pleased to see her, but was too weak to talk much. The physician has just seen her, and declares her in a fair way to do well. I hope, Miss, you will excuse all errors in this long letter, as I thought you would be anxious to know all the particulars, I have dwelt on the sub∣ject more than perhaps was necessary, but will now no longer intrude.</P>

<P>ONCE more, my beloved Celia, I am permitted to address you; but I will not address you in the voice of complaint, because I might have been far more wretch∣ed than I am. Much gratitude is therefore due to that benignant power, who has pro∣tected me through many dangers, and saved me from an evil which I could hardly have endured and lived. My senses too are re∣stored, my life preserved by almost a mira∣cle; and shall I, surrounded by these marvel∣ous blessings, dare to repine because I do not enjoy that tranquility of heart which young women of my age and fortune in general pos∣sess. I do not repine; I submit to the chas∣tening hand of heaven, I hope with that pa∣tience, which is the Christian's duty. I do not even presume to enquire, why these things are permitted; but yet my heart bleeds with my recent afflictions, and would fain
<PB N="69" REF="029439_0089_0FE11194F621E518"/>
seek ease by pouring forth its sorrows to that dear friendly girl, who will pity and sooth them. You must, long ere this, have re∣ceived Deborah's letter, which has no doubt filled you with amazement. It is my sad task to explain to you the mystery that inve∣lopes my conduct. To no other person breathing will I unfold my labouring heart: no, not even to kind hearted Deborah, or my my dear suffering mother: but to you, Celia, to you whose thoughts are detached from the world, to you who will consider this con∣fidence as sacred: to you I will venture to disclose a scene, the remembrance of which, even at this moment, chills the vital tide that nourishes my heart. But you, my gentle friend, well I know, tho' struck with horror at the tale I shall unfold, will join with me in offering to the throne of grace, fervent prayers for the author of my sorrows. "Oh thou Father, creator of the universe, look down upon him, pardon his manifold of∣fences, touch his heart that he may see his errors, and oh! of thy infinite mercy, blot this last transgression from the book of life." This is my daily prayer—but to proceed in my sad task:</P>
<P>The day my mother went into Essex I felt my spirits unusually oppressed, I rode out in the afternoon with my father, he
<PB N="70" REF="029439_0090_0FE111990ABE9470"/>
was extremely gay in his conversation, in∣deed, I thought too much so, as he treated some subjects with a levity which greatly shocked me, and some expressions escaped him which wounded my delicacy, but this did not so much surprise me as he had fre∣quently indulged himself in very improper conversation, not only before me, but other young women, who visited at the house, for which my mother always reproved him, but he in general turned it off with a laugh. However, as I had no person with me in the chaise, his manner was extremely embaras∣sing, nay even distressing, for he saluted me several times, told me he was afraid of shew∣ing much affection to me before my mother, who in her heart hates me; but, that if I was a good girl, he would not care for my mother, but shew me every kindness in his power; that I should go where I pleased, and do whatever my inclinations led me to. As∣tonished at this conversation, I hardly knew what to answer, and was extremely glad when we got home. I would have retired immediately to my appartment, but he in∣sisted on my staying to sup with him, saying he had ordered a chicken on purpose for me. I reluctantly complied. During supper he drank very freely and would have had me drink several glasses of wine; which as I was unaccustomed to I resolutely refused. When
<PB N="71" REF="029439_0091_0FE1119E8C2F2400"/>
I had supped he would have me play him a tune, after which he sung a song more adapt∣ed to the taste of a libertine than the chaste ears of a daughter. At ten o'clock I retired, and, tho' greatly surprized at my father's con∣duct, yet having nothing particularly heavy on my mind, I soon fell asleep, I never had been used to lock my door, and you may imagine my terror when being awoke by a noise in the room, I felt a man's hand take hold of mine; I gave a faint scream, fright deprived me of much power, but how were my fears increased, when I heard my father say, "hush! don't make a noise, it is only me." "You, sir," I replied, starting up, "and what can be the cause of your coming here." I cannot remember his answer, Celia, but I know he caught me in his arms. I sprang from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with a violent effort, and quitting the bed, the darkness of the night befriended me and I rushed out of the room into Deborah's chamber. After this I kept my apartment for several days, nor did I intend to have left it again till my mother's return, pretending indisposition; but he wrote me a letter, in which he asserted that he had mistaken my chamber for the house∣maid's, with whom he confessed he had an intrigue. Oh Celia! what a humaliating con∣fession from a father to a child, sure none but an unprincipled rake could have brought
<PB N="72" REF="029439_0092_0FE111A2C5CE30D8"/>
himself to make it. He begged I would not mention the circumstance to my mother, and promised amendment in future. Alas! I was deceived by this letter and again ven∣tured down to my meals. The day Deborah had leave to go out I spent the chief part be∣low, he was remarkably reserved in his be∣haviour, and seemed even indifferent and inattentive to me, scarcely speaking the whole day. At supper I drank as usual one glass of wine and then retired; I felt an unaccount∣able drowsiness come over me; but it had been a storm all the evening, and the almost incessant flashes of lightning, with distant rumbling thunder, prevented my indulging it. I had partly undressed myself and was sitting on the side of the bed endeavouring to compose myself, (for I am greatly terri∣fied at lightning,) when the door opened, and my father entered; he immediately shut the door and turned the key. To describe my horror is impossible, or to give you the most distant idea of the scene that ensued; but never to the latest hour I have to breathe, will it be erased from my memory. My re∣peated screams were of no avail. Deborah was from home, and the other maids slept too far off to hear me. Oh! how often did I wish that the vivid lightning, which every moment illumined the room, would strike me dead. At length a most tremendous clap
<PB N="73" REF="029439_0093_0FE111A8EC711340"/>
of thunder burst as it were directly over us. It ennerved, even the arm of hardened guilt, but it encouraged me. I seized the oppor∣tunity to fling open the window and declare, if he did not instantly quit my chamber, I would throw myself out, and seeing a pen∣knife lay on the window seat, I snatched it up: "come not near me, sir," said I, "for the moment you lay your hand upon me, this shall put an end to your existence." my fury which had wrought me almost to a state of frenzy, intimidated him. "Be pati∣ent, Meriel," said he, "shut the window and get into bed, you will catch your death with cold." "Better be dead," said I, "than live with dishonour." "I swear," he replied, "by all that is sacred, if you will go quietly to bed I will quit the room immediately."</P>
<P>"You shall quit it instantly," said I, in a menacing accent; "am I not your child, and do you dare invade the virtue it is your duty to protect?" Celia, I felt at that moment as tho' I could have encountered almost any thing; that I could have bared my bosom to the stroke of death, and even met the blow with thankfulness; he saw my increasing frenzy, and trembling unlocked the door and left the room. The moment he was gone I locked myself in, and over∣come with horror and distress, fell almost life∣less
<PB N="74" REF="029439_0094_0FE111ADE0521BE0"/>
on the bed: how long I continued in this state of torpor I cannot tell; but the first use I made of my returning senses was to think of escaping from the house, and in this I was resolutely determined, when I heard him again at the door demanding ad∣mission: the candle was now gone out, and the window still open; the thought was mo∣mentary: I formed no plan for support, nor even thought of a place where to seek an asylum; but, starting up, I pulled the sheets off the bed, and, undressed as I was, slipped by them into the garden. How I es∣caped, unhurt, heaven alone can tell: the moment I felt myself on the ground I thank∣ed God for my deliverance, and going out of the back garden gate, ran as fast as my strength would permit, as I imagined, to∣ward a neighbouring villages but as the day began to dawn, I found I had taken a wrong road, and was at the entrance of a large wood; I was afraid to return, lest I should meet my father; therefore, forcing my way into the thickest part, I found a little hovel, which had been made by some unfortunate wanderer, of branches and dry leaves: into this poor shelter I crept, and here first discovered that my faithful Lubin was with me. The little affectionate animal crept close up to me, licking my hands and face, as tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wished to comfort me; in
<PB N="75" REF="029439_0095_0FE111B329540078"/>
this situation, my cloaths wet, my spirits harrassed, and nature overcome, I sunk into a slumber. But here I must drop my pen, for memory no longer bears any traces of the ensuing scenes, till I awoke in my own bed and saw Deborah weeping by my side. Farewell, I will write again soon.</P>

<P>MY lot is hard, Celia, very hard; but I endeavour to keep up my spirits, as well as I am able, and conduct myself in such a manner as my own heart may acquit me.</P>
<P>When I was quite recovered from my ill∣ness, my mother called me one day into her
<PB N="76" REF="029439_0096_0FE111B774C2F158"/>
dressing-room and assured me, she would par∣don my elopement, on condition I would in∣form her of the cause, and by what means I came in the shocking situation already de∣scribed. You may be certain I felt myself greatly agitated, as I knew I could not give this dear parent the satisfaction she required, without planting a dagger in her heart. In∣deed, my friend, I cannot but feel thankful, that in my frenzy I did not discover the whole horrid secret, as it would have only involv∣ed us all in much greater distress than we experience at present.</P>
<P>I remained silent to my mother's question, but could not restrain my tears. She repeat∣ed it; conjuring me, in the most solemn manner, not to trifle with her, but to tell her what urged me to desert my home and friends.</P>
<P>"Oh! my dear mother," said I, "do not ask, indeed I cannot tell you. Suffer me to be silent on this subject; and, in every fu∣ture action of my life, I will implicitly obey you." "I fear, Meriel," said my mother, "you have some unworthy reasons for this concealment: tell me, then, who advised you to this imprudent step, and who accompanied you in your flight?" "No one," said I, "the resolution was hastily formed, and as ha∣stily
<PB N="77" REF="029439_0097_0FE111BCC1BDADC0"/>
executed; but I had no adviser, no com∣panion, nor do I think I ever went farther than the wood, where I was discovered."</P>
<P>"Meriel! Meriel!" said my mother, "I cannot believe you. It appears altogether improbable, that a young woman, without any apparent cause, should form a hasty re∣solution of running away; that she should chuse a tempestuous night to make her escape, without a companion, and hide herself in a wood with a design to starve herself to death. Tell me, child, and tell me sincere∣ly, did you not once love Pringle?" "I thought I did, but it was a mistake of the heart."</P>
<P>"I fear, Meriel, that mistake has led to your ruin: he certainly accompanied you in your flight, and my child is lost to honour and to virtue. Is not this the cause of your obstinate silence: do you not fear that the villain, whom in your heart you still love, should be brought to answer for his inhu∣man desertion of you."</P>
<P>"Oh! no my dear mother," said I, re∣doubling my tears, "indeed you wrong me, I never entertained a thought that I should blush to own, and if it was my last moment, I could, with safety to my conscience, de∣clare
<PB N="78" REF="029439_0098_0FE111BF6A42C578"/>
that neither Mr. Pringle, nor any of his family knew of my going away."</P>
<P>"Strange infatuation," said she, angrily, "to assert such falsehoods. Oh Meriel! I had hoped better from you; but I am sorry to say, in this instance, I can place no confi∣dence in your veracity." Here my father entered the room, and would you believe it possible, Celia, he repeated to me every ques∣tion which my mother had asked before. Asto∣nishment riveted my tongue. I could not answer. My silence was accounted obstina∣cy, and my dear mother left me with these cruel words: "Dissembling, obstinate girl, I can never love you as I once did, though I will strive to forgive you."</P>
<P>My father scarcely now ever speaks to me, and seems in his heart to hate me, as he takes every opportunity in his power of mortifying me; construes my most innocent actions into faults, and is continually com∣plaining to my mother of my indolence, and sulkiness, as he inhumanely terms that want of vivacity, for which he so well knows how to account. This ill humour I could bear patiently, but my mother's unkindness is worse than a dagger to my heart. I live in greater solitude than ever; I never go out, and when any company comes to the family,
<PB N="79" REF="029439_0099_0FE111C5607A7FB8"/>
I in general retire to my own room; for my feelings are often hurt by the ignorant, I had almost said inhuman questions, that are asked me by people who have no other inte∣rest in my fate, than as it serves to gratify their curiosity. Next week I expect my bro∣ther home from school; he does not return again, but is to be articled apprentice to a merchant in London. I shall not be sorry when he is gone, for I expect to suffer great∣ly from his unfeeling taunts. Oh! Celia, heaven and you know how little I deserve them; and that thought shall be my comfort and support. Adieu my friend.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER X. MERIEL to CELIA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>London,</HI> <DATE><HI>December</HI> 19<HI>th,</HI> 1775.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU are, no doubt surprized to see from whence this letter is dated, and you will be much more so, when I inform you of the great change that has taken place in our circumstances, some little time after I last wrote to you, as I was sitting in my own room, indulging the most painful ideas, I heard a great confusion below, and, among the rest, my mother's voice repeatedly screaming for help. I ran down stairs into the parlour, from whence the noise proceed∣ed, and on entering saw two ill looking men, one of which had seized my father by the collar, and the other was assisting to drag him away. "What is the matter," said I, to the men, "what are you doing with my father?" "Oh! we will do him no harm," said one of them: "he must only come away with us to my house, at Litchfield, till he has
<PB N="81" REF="029439_0101_0FE111D7A527C7A0"/>
paid five hundred pounds." "Five hun∣dred pounds," said I, "why, dear madam," turning to my mother, "to whom does my father owe so much money." "Oh child!" said he, "your mother knows nothing about the affair, I not only owe that, but three times the sum; we are inevitably ru∣ined, and all by my own folly. I have been bound for a friend of mine, a young man, at Litchfield, who is gone off, and I shall have all his debts to discharge." My poor mother sat weeping; and, on hearing this account, lifted up her eyes in speechless agony. I could not bear to see her distress. "It is a large sum to be sure gentlemen," said I, "but it shall be paid, so let my father remain, and do you go away for to night; to-morrow we will send you the money." Alas! Celia, how very little I knew of the world. The inhuman men laughed at me, and asked me, "when I ever heard of bailiffs letting go their prisoner on the bare word of a girl." "If you will not take my word," said I, "leave my fahter and take me, for it will break my dear mother's heart to have him carried to prison; but, as to me, it matters not what becomes of me." "That won't do neither, Miss," said they, "we must either have the money or take the gentle∣man away." Alas!" said I, turning to my mother, "what can I do? they will not re∣lease
<PB N="82" REF="029439_0102_0FE111DA9A666470"/>
him." No my child," said my mother, with more affection in her voice than I had heard for some time, "we must submit as patiently as we can till to-morrow, and then see what can be done. My father went away cursing his evil genius. Why will peo∣ple, Celia, when they bring misfortune on their own heads, rail at fate; yet you will find it always the case, and the more egre∣grious have been their errors, the more ve∣hement their compalints.</P>
<P>When they were gone, I exerted myself to console my mother, but her only answer was, "Ah Meriel! what will become of us, I see ruin approaching; I know of no way to avoide it, and my poor boy, what will he do." "Let me intreat you my dear mo∣ther," said I, "not to let this accident thus distress you: can you suppose, that while I have the means of living in ease and comfort, I would suffer my parent or my brother to feel any embarrassment, which it is in my pow∣er to remove. Did I not solemnly promise the dear departed saint, who made me thus independant, never to forsake you?"</P>
<P>"But alas! Meriel, have you not already broke that vow?" "Dear, dear madam, for∣give, forget, that involuntary transgression; and believe me, there never was a heart that
<PB N="83" REF="029439_0103_0FE111E072E86110"/>
glowed with more filial love, or greatful ten∣derness, than mine does towards you. My fortune is your's, I will share it with you and my brother to the last shilling; nay to con∣vince you of my sincerity, I would freely re∣nounce it all, and depend on my labour for support." My mother was affected, but it was only for a moment, she again assumed a look of coldness, and told <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> she feared I often suffered the warmth of my imagina∣tion to hurry me into expressions and pro∣mises, the nature of which I did not duly consider. She then bid me good night and left me.</P>
<P>Grieved to be thought so very unwor∣thy, by the person on earth I most loved, most wished to see happy, I could take no rest all night. As soon as day-light appear∣ed I arose, and dressing myself as plain as possible, borrowing a black bonnet of De∣borah, I determined to set out for Litchfield on foot; but, fearing my mother might be alarmed at my absence, I left a note inform∣ing her, in a few words, that I was gone to endeavour to prove myself worthy of her love. During my walk I revolved in my mind what steps to pursue. Mr. Sutten was joint guardian with my father: I had no doubt he had been sent for on account of the arrest, and hoped to prevail on him to
<PB N="84" REF="029439_0104_0FE111E431DCBD70"/>
advance sufficient money to make my poor mother easy in her mind. I therefore deter∣mined to go immediately to the house of the bailiff, and learn at whose suit my father had been arrested. From thence I would go to the creditor and endeavour to prevail with him to take half the money now, and the rest when I became my own mistress, which, according to Mrs. Mirvan's will, was to be at eighteen years old. Here busy reflection arose, and told me how very unworthy of my attention my father was, but he is my father still, said I, and tho' he has forgotten his duty towards me, it does not follow that I am to neglect mine to him: besides, reli∣gion teaches us to reward evil with good; and surely, if there is any way of awakening the person who injures us, to a sense of their guilt, it is by shewing them an example of christian charity, and good will; besides, my mother and brother have not injured me, and why should they suffer for the vices of my father? Occupied by these reflections, I entered Litchfield, and went directly to the bailiff's house. My father was not up; in∣deed I did not wish to see him if he had, so I only made the necessary enquiries, learnt who the creditor was, and proceeded direct∣ly to the street where he lived. Mr. Leeson is a man, who, for many years, served a no∣bleman in London, as I have been told, tho'
<PB N="85" REF="029439_0105_0FE111E9930120A8"/>
in what capacity, I never heard. In his ser∣vice, he accumulated a considerable fortune, and married a lady, a particular <HI>friend</HI> of his lordship's. Soon after he procured a pen∣sion, with which he came down to Litchfield, the place of his lady's birth, where he is now reckoned a very great man. This was the person who had occasioned my father's impri∣sonment. On knocking at the door a servant appeared yawning, and examining my dress with a scrutinizing eye, asked what I wanted. "I wish too see Mr. Leeson," said I, "on particular business." "Humph," said the fellow, standing with his back against the wall, his hands in his breeches pockets, "you must wait a good while before you can see him, for he is not up yet." "Pray friend," said I, "give me leave to go in and sit down till your master does get up." "You may go down stairs," said he, "if you will, and when master is stirring, I will let you know."</P>
<P>Humiliating, as it was, I went down stairs, sat down by the kitchen fire and dried my feet, which were wet, some rain having fal∣len in the night; my petticoat was also plashed with dirt. About nine o'clock, a spruce young woman, in a long white bed∣gown, came into the kitchen, and looking at me with a sort of contemptuous sneer,
<PB N="86" REF="029439_0106_0FE111ED0C7D9608"/>
cries, "servant ma'am, pray who may you want?" Imagining, from her appearance, and the manner in which she put the ques∣tion, that she might be some relation of the family, I rose from my seat, and an∣swered I had business of much importance with Mr. Leeson. "Aye Mrs. Bridget," cried a footman, who was cleaning some sil∣ver candlesticks, at the dresser; "when my lady's bell rings, you must let master know, this here young body has been waiting here ever since eight o'clock." A young lass, in appearance a menial servant, now appeared, and spreading a fine napkin on the table, brought the breakfast things, toasted some oat cakes, and Mrs. Bridget and Mr. James sat very comfortably down to breakfast; but during their repast, neither asked me if I would partake, tho' they endeavoured to gratify their curiosity, by asking, how far I had walked, if I had been long in the country, and many other questions, equally imperti∣nent and insignificant; to all which I an∣swered in little more than monosyllables. At length the bell rang, and Mrs. Bridget making a hasty finish of her breakfast, ran up stairs: soon after, the footman having equip'd himself as a valet, went out of the kitchen. I was now once more lest to my∣self, but had not indulged reflection long, before the girl, who had prepared the break∣fast,
<PB N="87" REF="029439_0107_0FE111F2F5BFE340"/>
came and sat down, in order to eat her own. She pour'd out two cups of tea, got up and held the oat cake (which was almost cold) to the sire, then casting a look, first at me, then at the table, in a mild accent, as tho' fearful of giving offence, said, "I am afraid you have not breakfasted ma'am; pray eat a bit, and take this cup of tea," hoiding the plate and tea towards me. "Mrs. Bridget is very proud ma'am, and Mr. James does nothing but what he thinks she will like; but I thinks your London folks are all proud; they serves only to make places uncomfortable. Do ma'am take it; I wish it was hotter and better." "It is very good," said I, taking a bit; for the poor girl's goodness of heart was so conspi∣cuous that I could not mortify her by a re∣fusal. She smiled, began drinking her own tea, and continued: "Mr. James was quite a different sort of a body, I assures you ma'am before he went to London last summer with my mistress; dear heart, he and I were so comfortable and happy, but when they came home my lady brought Mrs. Bridget with her, and ever since"—She paused; I saw her eyes glisten. Poor girl, thought I, James is false hearted, he has forsaken thee for Bridget; and yet, if he had but discern∣ment to perceive the difference between the two hearts, how gladly would he return to
<PB N="88" REF="029439_0108_0FE111F728656670"/>
one so gentle and tender. Here I was in∣terrupted by Mr. James himself, who told me his master desired me to walk up. I bade the kind hearted girl good morning, and followed James into the presence of his master.</P>
<P>"Well, young woman," said Mr. Lee∣son, who was standing with his back to the fire, and his hands behind him. (Celia I must here digress to give you some small idea of his person and manner.) A person rather above the middle size, a face, the fea∣tures of which, might have been termed regular, and even pleasing, had benevolence, good humour or politeness been any way discernable in it, instead of which there was an insolent pertness, a supercilious, self-ap∣proving smile, that to my idea portrayed nothing but ignorance, pride and conceit.</P>
<P>"Well, young woman," said he, "what may be your commands with me."</P>
<P>"You are sir, I understand, the person who has caused Mr. Howard to be arrested." He answered in the affirmative.</P>
<P>"I waited on you, sir, to make some pro∣posal concerning this affair, in hopes of be∣ing the means of his obtaining his liberty."</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="029439_0109_0FE111FC97594F68"/>
"What, do you belong to Mrs. Bel∣mour?"</P>
<P>"Belong to who sir?" in an accent of surprize.</P>
<P>"To Mrs. Belmour; the woman for whom Howard has thus involved him∣self."</P>
<P>"I understood, sir, that he was bound for a friend."</P>
<P>"Well child, she was his friend, my friend, any body's friend: why sure you know her."</P>
<P>"Indeed, sir, I never heard of her be∣fore: I am Mr. Howards daughter."</P>
<P>"Bless my soul! Mr. Howard's daugh∣ter, are you; well I have often heard of you, tho' I never had the pleasure of seeing you before. I remember hearing of that strange affair of your running away after En∣sign Pringle, and when he refused to have any thing to say to you, being afraid to go home again, you hid yourself in a wood, and went out of your senses."</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="029439_0110_0FE112BB861870A8"/>
Celia, can you for a moment suppose what, at that instant, were my feelings; un∣able any longer to support myself I sunk in∣to the nearest chair, (for I had been kept standing) and burst into tears.</P>
<P>"'Pon honour, Miss," said he, "I beg pardon, I did not mean to make you uneasy; but when one hears such strange stories, one likes, you know, to come at the truth: 'pon my soul I wish I had been in Pringles place, I should not have driven such a pretty little kind soul to dispair."</P>
<P>During this speech he had drawn nearer to me and had taken one of my hands, which I drew from him with disdain. "Sir," said I, with as much composure as I could assume, "you have been totally misinformed about that unhappy affair; and, pardon me, if I say, that it can be no business of your's, to enquire, what were the motives of a conduct, which, I find, has cast a fatal shade upon my reputation; I do not think myself accounta∣ble for my actions, to you or any other in∣different person: it is sufficient that heaven and my own heart acquits me of evil. I came here, Mr. Leeson, to consult about the liberation of my father; let me know on what terms that can be obtained, and I am ready to comply with them.</P>

<P>"I find, sir," said I, rising from my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> "that I am totally unfit to talk on these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, being but little acquainted with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> world, or what is daily acting in it; I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> therefore take my leave, for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and return in about two hours with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sutten, my guardian, who will better un∣derstand how to settle the affair."</P>
<P>I now returned to the bailiff's house where I learnt Mr. Sutten was with my fa∣ther. I desired that he might be informed I was there, and wished to speak with him; but

Ah! my dear girl, times are strangely altered, but, I thank heaven, I have health and more spirits than could be well expected after the painful scenes I have gone through; but no doubt I may have many more trials yet to endure. Pray for me, my friend, that I may have strength of mind to bear them as I ought, so as not to disgrace the religion of which I am a professor; and be assured, that every kind wish of my heart is daily offered up for your felicity; and that the remembrance of the happy, happy hours we have spent together, is ever present to the mind of your</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XI. MERIEL to CELIA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>London,</HI> <DATE><HI>January</HI> 3<HI>d,</HI> 1776.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE not had a moment to devote to my dear Celia since I dispatched the last, but as I know your friendly heart shares all the sufferings of your Meriel, I will now con∣tinue my narrative.</P>
<P>When Mr. Sutten appeared, he was great∣ly surprised to see me at Litchfield, and when I told him of my visit to Mr. Leeson, he ap∣peared very angry and said, "with his good will, I should not pay a farthing, and at any rate I should not have the money, till I was of age; for I might, if I attempted to extri∣cate my father from his present difficulites, soon be reduced to beggary, and leave my∣self without the power of assisting my mo∣ther; who was far more deserving my af∣fection and duty."</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="029439_0114_0FE112090C230670"/>
"It is on her account, sir," said I, "that I am thus anxious. Her happiness is bound up with my father's, and while he is under confinement she will be miserable; besides, Mr. Sutten, she does not think I love her, does not think me capable of doing a wor∣thy action. Oh! sir, give me the power to convince her, that my own interest and hap∣piness is of little value when put in compe∣tition with her's."</P>
<P>"My dear miss Howard," said he, "you must confess appearances have been strange∣ly against you. I will acknowledge I myself have had my doubts concerning the recti∣tude of your heart."</P>
<P>"Oh! I know," said I, "there is a fatal mystery involves my conduct, a mystery which I never can reveal."</P>
<P>"Nor will I desire it," replied the humane Mr. Sutten, "I see at this moment such traits of genuine goodness, such proofs of a mind, impressed with a just sense of its du∣ty, that I shall always think you had some ve∣ry just cause for your past conduct, nor will I believe it possible for a heart capable of con∣ceiving such noble, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, to harbour inclinations derogatory <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the honour and dignity of a virtuous woman."</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="029439_0115_0FE1120E32EFEAC0"/>
I thanked him for his good opinion, and he proceeded: "You must consider, Miss Howard, that you are young, very young; you know but little of the world, of conse∣quence can form no just value of that inde∣pendence, which, believe me, can alone secure you friends. Beauty and merit, my dear girl, are oftener a prejudice than a benefit to the posessors; it is an object of envy to your own sex; and, sorry I am to add, in general excites no other ideas in the bosom of ours, than to lead them to endeavour to vitiate those principles they pretend to adore; let me in∣treat you, therefore, to set a just value on that independence, with which it has pleased heaven to bless you; assist your parents as far as you can, without hurting yourself, and remember, that to secure the friendship of others you must not need their assistance."</P>
<P>This, my dear Celia, was arguing like a cold philosopher, and a man of the world; but it was not speaking with the spirit of christianity, or with the enthusiasm of a heart that glows with benevolence to all its fellow creatures. The dear lessons which I imbibed at Bologne taught me to regard my∣self but in a secondary light, when any thing praise-worthy was to be performed, and to remember only the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> us to do as we would be done by
<PB N="96" REF="029439_0116_0FE11213570207A8"/>
and, like the good Samaritan to pour oil and wine into the wounds of our suffering fel∣low creatures; but to proceed:</P>
<P>Mr. Sutten refused to advance a shilling, and I was forced to return to my mother, disappointed, dejected, and weary.</P>
<P>Two days after, an execution was sent to Woodbine Cot; my poor mother and my∣self were obliged to remove to Litchfield, where we took a small lodging near the house where my father was, where we remained till the estate was sold and all paid away to the last farthing, nor was even that enough to answer all the demands that were continually pouring in from all quarters; besides, when the estate came to be sold, it was found so en∣cumbered with mortgages, &amp;c. that it would not sell for above half its value. When all was settled, and my father at liberty, it was de∣termined that we should set forward to Lon∣don, where my father insisted we could live much cheaper than in the country, where we were so well known. There was still the interest of my four thousand pounds, which as it was at my own disposal, I deter∣mined to devote to the support of the family. All our servants were discharged, poor De∣borah too; you cannot think, Celia, what I suffered on being separated from this faith∣ful
<PB N="97" REF="029439_0117_0FE11218AEE13498"/>
woman. She offered to stay with us without being paid; but my mother would not consent to reeicve an obligation from an inferior. I thought the resolution savoured of pride; but we all have our failings, and perhaps pride in some degree, is laudable.</P>
<P>On our arrival in town, we took a small lodging and hired a young woman to do the most laborious part of our domestic business; the rest' it is my province to perform; and, believe me, I do it chearfully. It employs my mind, prevents my taking melancholy retrospects, and I think contributes to im∣prove both my health and spirits. We have paid a visit to my father's eldest sister. She is married to a counsellor, who has made a genteel independence by his profession. My aunt is a woman whose character I do not well know how to develope. She is in ge∣neral affable, condescending, and chearful; and in conversation, gives evident proofs of a genteel education, and a brilliant under∣standing; but, with all is so tinctured with va∣nity, and tho' upwards of forty, still posses∣ses that spirit of coquetry, that in a great mea∣sure obscures her good qualities. Her daugh∣ters, Hester and Susan, have had, what is termed a fashionable education, that is, they can daub a fan mount, jumble the keys of the harpsichord, and jabber an unintelligible
<PB N="98" REF="029439_0118_0FE1121CBB87E610"/>
jargon, which they call French. They are realy lovely girls. Hester, in particular, seems calculated to inspire love and respect, wherever she appears. Susan is more vola∣tile, but, with all can make herself extremely agreeable. They are both spoilt by the mo∣ther, who, having taken it into her head, that their beauty will certainly recommend them to men of rank and fortune, is conti∣nually filling the poor girls' minds with that kind of vanity, and eager desire of con∣quest, that in general fails of the desired effect, and repels the admiration, which it is designed to attract. Their naturally good dispositions are by these means totally pre∣verted, and instead of being the engaging, innoecnt, unaffected girls, which nature form'd them, they appear, in a mixed com∣pany, a combination of pride, vanity, and self-conceit.</P>
<P>Mr. Mosop, their father, is haughty, dis∣tant, and forbidding in his manner, posesses a great deal, of what is called family pride: has little feeling and less good nature, yet on the whole is deemed a respectable cha∣racter. He is strictly honest in his princi∣ples, pays every one their due to the utmost farthing, but will not bestow the least trifle in charity, because he considers constantly paying the poor rate to be a sufficient dis∣charge
<PB N="99" REF="029439_0119_0FE112221A2F4EE0"/>
of that duty. The query with me, is, whether he would pay that sum yearly if not obliged to it; if not, where is the merit of paying it now. Oh! Celia, how do I hate those luke-warm hearts. You may remember I always shewed a dislike to the cool doctrines of philosophy. I could never have a good opinion of a person who regards every surrounding object with the stoical eye of apathy. I am sure they must possess hearts, rendered impenetrable by na∣ture to those fine feelings, which, tho' at some moments they may distress, in general ele∣vate and expand the soul. For my own part, Celia, I am as weak as an infant, whenever a scene of distress or happiness meets my eye, I have a tear of sympathy for the one, and a smile of gratulation for the other; and the smile and the tear, mingle so sweetly with each other, that every faculty is harmonized by the union, and I am at a loss to tell which sensation is the most exquisitely delightful. Then let the unfeeling boast the philosophic calmness of their tempers. I will not scru∣ple to aver, that tho' they may escape many an acute pang, that wrings the heart of sensi∣bility, they know not what true pleasure is. But I am strangely digressing from my sub∣ject. You will wonder perhaps, how I so soon comprehended the character of my un∣cle's family: believe me, Celia, it was not

by my own penetration that I discovered them. From my own observations, I should have supposed Mr. Mossop an agreeable man, his wife a charming, amiable woman, and the two young ladies the sweetest, most en∣gaging girls in the world; nay, at this very moment, I feel so inclined to love the whole family, that I think the disagreeable traits in their characters have been exaggerated. It was to a Mr. Rainsforth, that I was indebted for this minute delineation of them. This Mr. Rainsforth is an agreeable young man, whom I have frequently seen at my uncle's, and at first thought he was partial to my cousin Hester, but I find I was mistaken in this supposition, as his intimacy in the family proceeds from his having been school-fellow with young Mossop, whom I have as yet seen but little of.</P>
<P>Rainsforth is the son of a merchant, in Plymouth. His mother died when he was an infant, and his father has, within these few years, married a woman many years younger than himself, by whom he has a young family. Frederic has a small fortune independent of his father, and is besides a lieutenant in the navy. My father seems very partial to him; that, you will say, is no great recommendation; but I flatter my∣self, Celia, this unhappy father begins to see
<PB N="101" REF="029439_0121_0FE1122BF0328040"/>
his errors, and will, in future atone for them. I think, tho' our income is circumscribed, and our situation greatly altered, my dear mother is much happier than I ever saw her. I cannot boast of much happiness myself; re∣membrance, painful rembrance, damps every little pleasure or amusement that is offered to my notice; yet, when I look round me, and behold many who are perhaps my supe∣riors in worth and virtue, perishing for want of the common necessaries of life; oppressed with sickness; surrounded with children, who look up to them for that support, which they have not to bestow: when I see these things, my friend, I lift up my heart in hum∣ble gratitude to that Providence, who has, thro' life, given a portion into my hand, the over plus of which may, in some little degree, serve to cheer the sons and daughters of mi∣sery. You smile to hear me talk of having any to spare from my little income. Oh! my dear girl, had I but a shilling in my poc∣ket, I could not call it my own, if I saw a fellow creature whose heart would be in the least lightened by sharing it with me.</P>
<P>My aunt has promised to take me to a play. I am fond reading dramatic works, and form great expectations of amusement from seeing a performance. I will certainly give you

<P>I NEVER shall get used to the ways of London, and I am always bringing my∣self into difficulties, and foolish embarras∣ments, through my ignorance; then my mother is angry, and what in reality pro∣ceeds from simplicity of my nature, is con∣strued into art or levity.</P>
<P>I have been fretting these two hours about a circumstance that has highly of∣fended
<PB N="103" REF="029439_0123_0FE11236CDA02CA8"/>
my dear mother; and, I am sure, Celia, I did it without a thought of harm. I had been out a little way yesterday, and was returning in the close of the evening, when I heard a very genteel looking elderly gentleman enquiring the way to a street which lay in my way home; the person whom he addressed could not direct him, and I, unconscious of any impropriety, step∣ped forward and told him, as it lay in my way, I would shew him the place he enquir∣ed for: he seemed much obliged to me, and said, "as we were going the same way I might as well take hold of his arm;" but this, as he was quite a stranger, I refused to do; however, I could not help answering some civil questions, which he asked, and when we arrived at the street he had men∣tioned, he insisted on seeing me safe home: this I remonstrated against, saying, be∣sides giving him unnecessary trouble, it would make my mother very angry with me. At this he declared he knew my mo∣ther very well, and he was not at all afraid of her anger, as he was certain it lay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his power to appease it. I was surprised, you may imagine, and indeed very uneasy all the rest of the way, as I knew how offended my mother would be, at seeing a stranger come home with me. When the servant opened the door he walked in without any
<PB N="104" REF="029439_0124_0FE111CE791BEF20"/>
ceremony, and going into the parlour which was occupied by the gentlewoman who keeps the house, he thus addressed her, "Servant, my good madam, your lovely daughter here, having kindly given me an invitation home, I flatter myself we shall spend a chearful evening, and you and I, my good mother, shall not disagree, I war∣rant." Mrs. Fermor stared, and I felt rea∣dy to fink into the earth.</P>
<P>"You are under a mistake, sir," said I, "pray leave me." "What, leave you, my little dove, when you have been so very kind, no, no! hardly such a fool as that; come mother, what shall I order in for sup∣per, and what wine will you drink?" "Miss Howard," said Mrs. Fermor, "I am over∣whelmed with astonishment; how have you dared to bring this gentleman here to in∣sult me?" "Indeed madam," I replied, ter∣rified beyond measure, "I am innocent of any intention to offend you; this gentle∣man"—"Why, I can tell the tale as well as you my pretty one," said he, interrupt∣ing me: "you must know, madam, I was coming into Westminster, and did not right∣ly know my way, so, this pretty, kind heart∣ed damsel was so good as to shew me, that is all, ma'am and so in return, I am only grateful, and would willingly treat you with
<PB N="105" REF="029439_0125_0FE1124093E4D5A0"/>
good supper, and as far as ten guineas would go."</P>
<P>At this moment my father came in, and seeing me stand trembling in the parlour, a fresh scene of confusion insued, which ended in the whole family believing I had invited the old gentleman home with me, merely out of levity, and as Mrs. Fermor called it, an indiscreet frolic. You may suppose how rigorous my mother was, how angry my fa∣ther; for tho' in his heart, he has not the least regard for real virtue he always pre∣tends great attention to my conduct, and this evening declared he would rather follow me to the grave than see me lost to honour.</P>
<P>Oh! Celia, how my soul detests his hy∣pocrisy. It gives me great uneasiness to find just as my mother began to have a better opinion of me, I have again lost her confi∣dence; am again abridged of my walks, and at home see only the frown of displeasure, sit on that face which once beamed on me the smile of maternal tenderness.</P>
<P>My brother is at length settled in an emi∣nent merchants counting-house; I have en∣gaged myself to pay the necessary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> when I am put in possession of my fortune, and, to tell you the truth, Celia I am resolved to
<PB N="106" REF="029439_0126_0FE112464EDE3A88"/>
stay in my father's family no longer than that time; but, by some genteel employment' endeavour to earn subsistence for myself as I am determined not to deprive my mo∣ther of support, by taking the money into my own hands.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 5<HI>th.</HI></P>
<P>My aunt has just called, and after a great deal of persuasion, has prevailed with my mother to let me go to the play to-morrow evening; I am to go out this afternoon with my cousins, to purchase some few articles of dress necessary to my appearing at a public place, as my aunt always takes my cousins to the most conspicuous part of the theatre. Well, it will be of little consequence to me, where we sit; I go to see and not to be seen, I wish to be amused myself, but have not the least ambition to be the amusement of others, either from my person, dress or manner.</P>
<P>Well, Celia, had I ever been vain of my person, I should now be perfectly cured of so ridiculous a vanity; but it is happy for me, that I never thought my face more than passable; and as to my shape, I knew it had not the smallest pretentions to either grace or elegance; and, by having this humble opinion, I have escaped a severe mortifica∣tion;
<PB N="107" REF="029439_0127_0FE1124BC11FB840"/>
for you know, my Celia, the severest reflections loose their force, when we can listen to them with good humour, and re∣turn an answer with a smile.</P>
<P>I accompanied my aunt and cousins to a milliner's; Mr. Rainsforth and young Mos∣sop were of the party. I am astonished how young men can suffer themselves to be dragged as it were to such places, and have the patience to listen to a tedious deserta∣tion on gauzes, ribbons, lace and a hundred other trifles, almost below the notice of a ra∣tional being. But, if I was surprised at that, how much more was I to see a parcel of powdered effeminate animals, for I will not call them men, stuck up behind a counter, measuring a peny-worth of tape or a smaller quantity perhaps; telling you with the gra∣vity of a philosopher, that such a ribond become your delicate complexion; such a cap set off your features to advantage, &amp;c. And, will you believe it possible, that one morning being in a perfumer's shop, I saw an officer in the army, purchasing chicken gloves, violet powder and cold cream, aye, and for his own use too, for the master in∣formed me he had neither wife nor sister, to whom such things might have been of use.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="029439_0128_0FE1124F0F6CA390"/>
Well, to the milliner's we went, where Hester and Susan having chosen their caps. I was pleased with the choice of the fomer, and said I would have one like it. "Lord, my dear," said my aunt, "how can you think of such a thing, pretty women you know may wear any thing, but those that are plain should study what will most be∣come them." "Aye," cried young Mos∣sop, "my cousin to be sure should not wear any thing that atrtacts general notice." "Here," said Susan, "here Meriel, is a ve∣ry pretty cap, I think it will become you vastly." It was etremely plain, having no ornament but a knott of white sattin ribbon.</P>
<P>"You are quite right, cousin," said I, "this cap will certainly suit me best. I never love to be fine, and what will be becoming on you, will only appear an af∣fectation of finery on me." I said this with a smile, as I tried on the cap. Mr. Rains∣forth told my aunt he thought true beauty required few ornaments. "Come, come, you rally," said she, "you can't think Me∣riel handsome." He made no answer, but smiling, sung the following stanza, which, as it contained a delicate compliment, you will pardon me if I here repeat it.</P>
<PB N="109" REF="029439_0129_0FE1125571C4DC28"/>
<L>She is not fair, but yet I swear,</L>
<L>To me she has ev'ry grace,</L>
<L>Her lovely mind I always find,</L>
<L>Depicted in her face.</L>
<P>But, my Celia will say my letters begin to be very insipid, when I can find no other theme than the repetition of my own praise. Forgive me, dear girl, this time, I will be careful how I offend again.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 7<HI>th.</HI></P>
<P>My entertainment last night, exceeded my most sanguine expectations; the house, the lights, the brilliant and numerous audi∣ence, on my first entrance, filled me with silent astonishment; but my cousins declare they never will go to the play with me again, for at the pathetic and interesting parts, I could not conceal my emotion. It was Jane Shore. Long did I struggle to suppress my tears; the effort was vain, and when in the last scene, they drag the just reconciled husband from the arms of his dying wife, the half smothered sobs burst forth, and I fell back in an hysteric. You cannot think, how I was laughed at, and my cousins declare they were so shocked at my behaviour, that they shall be ashamed to shew their faces at the play∣house again this season. "One would think
<PB N="110" REF="029439_0130_0FE1125A5EB57B10"/>
child," said my aunt, in a peevish tone, as I began to recover, "you never had seen a play in your life before." "Well, you know I never did," said I, aloud. This compleat∣ed my disgrace, and my aunt turning toward the stage, noticed me no more the whole evening.</P>
<P>I think if I were to go again, I should like to sit in some unnoticed corner, where I could give sensibility the reins, and whilst I wept the woes of those whose sorrows now rest in the silent grave, I would so mould my heart, as it should be ever ready to par∣take and alleviate the afflictions of those who still move on the busy stage of life.</P>
<P>One thing, my cousins informed me of, which considerably damped my pleasure during the evening. They said, that many of the beautiful, elegant women, whom I saw in the boxes, were the slaves of vice, and purchased the gaudy trappings, by which they were adorned, by the wages of guilt; and that (but I can hardly think it possible) some of them are so lost to every sense of vir∣tue, that they come to those public places with no other view than to attract new lovers; and what is still worse, that in a few years; nay, perhaps even in a few months, I may see those lovely blooming women walking the streets,
<PB N="111" REF="029439_0131_0FE1125FF12D66B8"/>
subject to the insults of every brutal passenger, and sinking into an untimely grave, under the complicated evils of poverty, sickness and disgrace. I felt my eyes fill as Hester con∣cluded; and do you not pity them, said I: "La! cousin," said she, "you are the strang∣est girl; you make one laugh to see you now, with that long dismal face, talking about pity for such wretches." "Perhaps," said I, "they had no friend to teach them better, and surely, tho' we may shudder with detestation at their vices, humanity still leads us to pity their sufferings." "You are as old fashioned in your notions, Meriel," said my aunt, who had overheard as, "as you are in your dress and manner. You will know better child when you have seen a lit∣tle more of the world." I must now quit my pen to assist in some necessary domestic business. Believe me, Celia, there is no pleasure so agreeable as writing to you.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>London,</HI> <DATE><HI>March</HI> 30<HI>th,</HI> 1776.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>LAST night, having spent the evening with my father and mother, at my un∣cle's; when we were coming home Mr. Rains∣forth put a letter into my hand as he handed me into the coach: I could not well return it or I would, so was obliged to put it in my pocket; however, I resolved not to open it till I had first shewn it to my mother. When we got home, it was late, and all immediate∣ly retired to bed. I will confess it cost me no little trouble to stiflle the curiosity that prompted me to open the letter. I put it in a drawer and turned the key; but, just then recollecting that I wanted something that was in that identical drawer, I unlocked it again, took up the letter, read the address, looked attentively if the wafer was dry; and after viewing it on every side near a dozen times,
<PB N="113" REF="029439_0133_0FE1126AE997D3C0"/>
resolution at length repelled curiosity, I re∣turned it to the drawer and locked it again, without once recollecting why I had opened it the second time.</P>
<P>In the morning I waited till we had done breakfast, and then putting the letter into my mother's hand, said, "I hope, my dear ma∣dam, this will convince you I would not wil∣lingly be guilty of an impropriety, or have a concealment of this nature from my best friend." She took it with a cold look of sus∣picion, and having read it, said "I suppose you know the contents." "Indeed I do not," was the reply. "You can guess, I imagine," said she; "no gentleman would have had the temerity to put a letter into a young la∣dy's hand in such a clandestine manner, had he not been pretty certain that it would not be refused." "Good heavens!" said I, bursting into tears, "shall I never regain your confidence? Must every action, howe∣ver innocent, be misconstrued or liable to suspicion." "Why Meriel," said she, "will you endeavour to persuade me, Mr. Rains∣forth has never entertained you on the sub∣ject of love." "If I may be believed ma∣dam," said I, with a firm voice, "he never uttered a syllable to me that could be con∣strued into more than common politeness." "Well, child, read the letter then, and tell
<PB N="114" REF="029439_0134_0FE1126F063EC910"/>
me your opinion of the contents." I fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my face glow as I cast my eye over the letter, which contained a profession of ardent affec∣tion and an offer of his hand, if my father approved the union.</P>
<P>"You ask my opinion, dear mother," said I, "and I will candidly give it; I think Mr. Rainsforth a very amiable young man, from what little I have seen, but it is impos∣sible that I can form any just idea of his cha∣racter, from so short an acquaintance; If when upon a greater intimacy, I should find him in reality possessed of those valuable qualifications, honour and benevolence, and my father and yourself have no objection, I will not hesitate to confess, I could give him my hand, not only without reluctance, but with pleasure."</P>
<P>"But suppose, Meriel, your father should object." "If you, madam, should also dis∣approve, I hope I know my duty too well to complain; since your knowledge of man∣kind in general, must make you a much better judge of what will be really conducive to my happiness, than I can possibly be myself; however, madam, if such objections should arise, I hope you will inform me soon, that I may early begin to teach my heart a lesson which, some little time hence, I may find a
<PB N="115" REF="029439_0135_0FE112749E321658"/>
difficulty in making it obey." My mother made no answer, and soon after I left the room; in the afternoon Mr. Rainsforth cal∣led; I felt the colour flush to my face: when he entered he glanced his eyes toward me; but I believe they brought him no intelli∣gence concerning the reception his letter had met with. He had not been seated above ten minutes before my mother made some excuse to send me out of the room; I understood her perfectly, and was not in haste to return; in about an hour I was sent for to make tea, but it was the most unsocial meal I had ever partaken of, when Rains∣forth was present: he was silent; I was embarrassed, and my father and mother, as is in general the case, spoke to each other but little. When tea was over he took his leave, when my father acquainted me I had his permission to recieve his addresses; said he believed him a man of honour, and, if his friends raised no objection to the union, he thought the sooner it was compleated the better. Does not this eagerness to dispose of me, shew how painful my presence is to him? Indeed I do not wonder at it, we sel∣dom like to be much in company with those persons whom we are conscious of having injured.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="029439_0136_0FE11278702FC120"/>
And now, my dear Celia, you will per∣haps wonder at my so readily listening to an offer of marriage from a man with whom I have so small an acquaintance, but indeed my situation at home is far from being agree∣able. My mother's affections seem totally alienated from me, and lavished with redoub∣led tenderness on my brother, who, I am sorry to say, repays it with ingratitude and disre∣spect. He is continually teizing her for money, and tho' he is conscious there is no source from whence that money can pro∣ceed, except from me, yet he is continually tormenting me by some ill natured trick or other. If we are in a mixed company, every word I utter is turned into ridicule. If I sit silent, then sister is studying something cle∣ver to say; if I deliver my sentiments on any subject that excites my sensibility or venera∣tion, then sister is going to turn a sentimen∣tal actress, or a methodist preacher; even the respect I pay to my religious duties is an object of ridicule, in which my pretty cousins always join. If I express my dislike of cards, gadding, and its attendant scandal, and my love of retirement, study and domestic em∣ployment, then he wonders what Mrs. Mir∣van could mean by leaving me a fortune, who could be so well content with
<Q><PB N="117" REF="029439_0137_0FE1127E12D34278"/>
<L>— pounds three-score,</L>
<L>For meat and books, nor ask for more.</L></Q>
To which my aunt often replies, aye, Meriel would make an excellent poor man's wife; and these expressions often escape them be∣fore people, who think it degrading to be able to perform, for themselves, any of the necessary offices of life; and would blush to death were they supposed to know how to make or mend their own linen; for my own part, I cannot help thinking, if those fine ladies had a little more useful employ∣ment on their hands, they would not have so much time to investigate and expose the actions of their neighbours.</P>
<P>You must imagine, my dear girl, that I lead but an uncomfortable kind of life; and Mr. Rainsforth always shews that attention to me, and takes my part, with such delicacy as must unavoidably awaken my gratitude, if not my affection; and believe me I now begin to feel the difference between a real attachment and the illusive wanderings of the heart. I know how to value the virtues of my lover, at the same time I feel a much stronger inclination to act in all things with that propriety as may render me respected. I feel now the true value of reputation, ho∣nour and virtue, because I entertain a hope of
<PB N="118" REF="029439_0138_0FE11281642AB290"/>
being one day united to a man, whose charac∣ter would be injured by my want of either: and, oh! my Celia, what a blush of confusion often spreads my cheeks, when I reflect on the letters I wrote to Pringle; how do I shudder at the bare possibility of those letters one day coming to the eye of Mr. Rainsforth. Wrote, as they were, at a time when my imagination was so strongly tinctured with the style of the books I had been reading, that I almost involuntarily wrote the very sentiments which I had just embibed, with all the enthusiasm of romantic affection. Ah! Celia, those books drew very deceitful pictures of human life, their false colouring had raised my expectations and exalted my ideas, of love and friendship, far above any thing I can find in the little circle ac∣quaintance I have formed. Perhaps those elevated sentiments and actions may be con∣fined to people of an elevated sphere of life, for I never remember meeting with any hero or heroine of a story, but either were at first, or afterwards proved to be persons of rank and fortune: but those are people so far above me, I can never hope to form any acquaintance with them. I see them daily pass me in their carriages, surrounded with af∣fluence, attended with respect; yet surely if I know my own heart, I do not envy them, except, when I think of the power they pos∣sess
<PB N="119" REF="029439_0139_0FE112876B5AADB8"/>
to cheer the poor wretch humbled by affliction, and to cause the broken heart to rejoice. Envy, did I say, oh! no, it is not envy, it is a sentiment I cannot find a name for, it is a wish to enjoy those transporting feelings myself, without taking from their felicity; it is an earnest desire to promote, not decrease, the happiness of every human being.</P>
<P>You, my Celia, secluded from the world, in devout retirement, can form but a faint idea of the many miseries with which this variegated world abounds. Yes, my friend, and there are pleasures too, but they are not in general suited to my taste. I hate a crowd; it may for a moment dazzle the senses, but it leaves no impression on the heart. In my opinion, we cannot experience real pleasure, if we are devoid of happiness; and of this I am certain, happiness can seldom be drawn from external objects, but is sure to dwell in the heart, conscious of performing its duty. That such happiness, may ever be your's and mine, prays your</P>

<P>SINCE my last, few incidents have hap∣pened, worthy the notice of my Celia, except that Mr. Rainsforth, being my de∣clared lover, has astonished all my uncle's family. My mother says she is sure Hester and Susan are ready to burst with envy; I cannot think it. That dear woman has met with so many painful incidents, in her way thro' life, that her naturally amiable temper, is soured, and she views every thing with a jaundiced eye. My cousins seem highly delighted with the idea of an approaching wedding, and declare they will be my bride maids. They are mistaken in thinking the wedding will be so soon, Mr. Rainsforth be∣ing obliged to join his ship, which belongs to the grand sleet at Spithead, and I rather wish to remain single till this summer's cruise

is past. If he returns safe, I need not tell you with what joy I shall fulfill my engagements: if not; if it be his fate to fall in the defence of his country, I will come to you my be∣loved Celia, and become a pensioner in the convent for life. My religion will not per∣mit me to take the veil; but my vow of celibacy will be as sincere, breathed from my own heart to the great Judge of all our actions, as tho' I made at the foot of the al∣tar, surrounded by all the pomp of monkish superstition. Pardon me, my beloved friend, I mean no reflection on the religion you pro∣fess. I think that it is not the form but the heart that is an acceptable sacrifice: and the soul that humbles itself before its Maker, and cries "pardon my numerous transgressions, I am but a worm before thee, the creature of thy infinite power: if thou shouldest for∣sake me, who will dare to be my friend; dis∣pose of me as in thy wisdom thou shalt think fit; I will not complain, but will take the lot appointed, with submission." That soul, my Celia, let its form of worship be what it may, will one day shine resplendent in the mansion of its Creator. Oh! with what rapture can we approach the throne of mercy, when with a heart overflowing with gratitude, we can say, in the words of our admired Pope:

<L>That mercy I to others show,</L>
<L>That mercy shew to me.</L></Q>
But I know my Celia is as void of bigotry as she is of every other error.</P>
<P>As Mr. Rainsforth is now, I will not deny, the first object of my esteem, I must inform you of the reasons which have by degrees conspired to raise him thus in my opinion. The day after that mentioned in my last let∣ter, I received one from him, a copy of which I have enclosed for your perusal, also my an∣swer, and his second letter. After you have read them, I think you will not blame my partiality.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XV. MR. RAINSFORTH to MISS HOWARD, (Enclosed in the foregoing.)</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FROM a conversation I had lately with Mr. Howard, I find you have made your parents the confidants of a passion, which I hardly dared venture to disclose, even to the dear object who had excited it; and pardon me, if I say some peculiarities in the manner of both Mr. and Mrs. Howard, has been the cause of my not applying to them for leave to address their lovely daughter; nor in∣deed, did I think it quite consonant with the idea of female delicacy, to apply for the pa∣rents approbation, before I could flatter my∣self that approbation would be entirely agree∣able to the person, whose good will I am most solicitous to obtain.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="029439_0144_0FE1129A5D26F3A0"/>
I thank you a thousand times, dear, ami∣able young lady, for the sweet hope you have authorised your father to give me; your conduct has, if possible, raised you in my esteem; and I look forward with a cer∣tainty of felicity to the moment that shall unite us by indissoluble ties; for sure a wo∣man who has so high a sense of filial duty, must ever retain a proper idea of the equally incumbent duties which will arise from the married state; her husband's honour will be safe in her hands; her children will look up to her as their friend, and blessings will at∣tend her footsteps wherever she appears. Oh! beloved Miss Howard, my heart, that perfectly understands your virtues, exults in paying them the homage due. The simplici∣ty of your manner first charmed me, and par∣don me if I say, I saw not the charms of your person, till I had learnt to adore the good∣ness of your heart; to guard that heart from every approaching evil, shall henceforth be my study: if you will favour me with a few lines from your own hand, to say you do not refuse me so charming a guardianship, and to confirm me in the hope of being not quite indifferent to you, it will be acknowledged as the highest obligation, by your faithful</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVI. MISS HOWARD to MR. RAINSFORTH.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>GRATITUDE will not suffer me long to remain silent or inattentive, to a letter, the contents of which, seem to breath only the spirit of sincerity; nor will I hesi∣tate to confess, that the liberty my parents have granted is perfectly consonant with the feelings of my own heart. Every one who is honoured with the acquaintance of Mr. Rainsforth, must be sensible of his worth, and to find oneself the object of the tender∣est esteem, to a truely worthy man, must cer∣tainly awaken a degree of laudable pride, in a bosom not devoid of sensibility. Accept my sincerest thanks for the many obliging sentiments you have expressed in my favour, and give me leave to mention a few circum∣stances with which you may be unacquainted,
<PB N="126" REF="029439_0146_0FE112A4A239B030"/>
but which, I think it highly proper, you should be informed of.</P>
<P>It is in general reported that I have four thousand pounds for my fortune. This re∣port is false. I have only a fourth part of the sum. My godmother, Mrs. Mirvan, made the will in my favour, but with these restrictions; that I should never suffer my fa∣mily to feel the necessities of life. At that time, Mr. Rainsforth, there was no prospect of their ever being reduced from a state of competency, to a dependence on their child; but such is the fluctuating state of human affairs, that this is exactly now the case. This state of depedence is extremely painful to me, and I am sure must be so to them. It is, therefore, my fixed determination, when I am of age, to settle the moiety of my for∣tune on my mother. I am under engage∣ments for my father at present to the amount of five hundred pounds, and the other five hundred must be appropriated to the use of my brother, during his clerkship, and to help him forward a little when that is ex∣pired.</P>
<P>This disposition of my little fortune, may make a material difference in your plans of life for the future, and I thought it but right to inform you, that no interest of my
<PB N="127" REF="029439_0147_0FE112A89D5FCE50"/>
own, shall ever induce me to alter my reso∣lution. If you think me still worthy of your attentions, I am your's. Do not smile at my frankness, I have not yet learnt to disguise the feelings of my heart. Do not hesitate to give a candid answer. If the union is not equally eligible with one, as it would have been with four thousand pounds, seek not to excuse yourself for withdrawing your addresses, I will not even require an apology for a conduct, to which I am certain, no∣thing but the most powerful reasons, could have forced you.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVII. MR. RAINSFORTH to MISS HOWARD.</HEAD>
<P>SHALL I not chide you, my dear Miss Howard; shall I not tell you what I felt at the reception of your dear unkind let∣ter. Dear it will ever be to my fond bosom, because in the sincerity of your language, I could read the affection of your heart. "Smile at your frankness;" how could you think of such a thing. No, I adore you for it, and surely the man who could despise a heart for its sincerity, deserves not to pos∣sess so invaluable a blessing. May Miss How∣ard never learn to disguise feelings which, chastened as they are, by honour and femi∣nine delicacy, become an honour to the heart; but still I must chide. What could you think, when you say, "if the union is not equally eligible with one, as it would have been with four thousand pounds." Unkind Meriel, do you suppose millions could increase my love, or could they make
<PB N="129" REF="029439_0149_0FE112B3C5FD5340"/>
you more valuable. No, they could not; therefore, dispose of your fortune in any manner you shall think fit, give me only yourself, and I shall think I possess a jewel, which worlds could not purchase.</P>
<P>I am every day expecting orders to join the fleet. Will you, my dear Miss Howard, par∣don my impatience, if I wish to call you mine before these orders arrive. I shall have a thousand doubts and fears if I leave you be∣fore we are irrevocably united. Perhaps some one more worthy; Oh! forgive my suspicions, but who can love and not fear to lose the object of their fondest hopes. Me∣thinks could I once call you mine, the thought would inspire me with courage. Should I be called into action against the ene∣my of my country, honour, ambition, thirst of fame should all give way to love. For you alone would I fight, for your sake alone wish to conquer, and your love should be the reward of all my toils.</P>
<P>I will spend an hour with you to-morrow evening. Oh! my sweet friend, let your mild eyes tell me, at meeting, you cannot re∣fuse the ardent prayer of your ever faithful</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVIII. MERIEL to CELIA, (in continuation.)</HEAD>
<P>BUT I did refuse him, Celia, tho' my little rebellious heart would have fain played the traitor. Be still little fool, said I, Meriel will learn to be thy mistress: think not, by thy flutterings and throbings, to counteract resolutions which reason tells me are right and laudable. So, my dear girl, I persevered in the determination of not giv∣ing Rainsforth my hand, till the summer's cruise was over, and he was obliged to sub∣mit with as good a grace as he could, tho' I assure you, he looked quite blank upon it. And now, my dear girl, I will give you my reasons for thus obstinately opposing the pro∣posed union. You know I shall be eighteen in September, when being mistress of my for∣tune, I may dispose of it as I have already designed, without being answerable to any one. Now, if I marry first, I certainly make my husband master, not only of myself, but
<PB N="131" REF="029439_0151_0FE112C64812F0B8"/>
of all I possess; and how do I know what ob∣jections may arise on his part in the course of a few months. I do not mean, that I doubt Rainsforth's generosity; but a change of circumstances produces a change of ideas, and I think it is best not to trust too much to the firmness of our own hearts.</P>
<P>My aunt laughed the other day, and said she questioned if I should ever be married, for absence and salt water are in general a cure for love. It may prove so with some, but I do not much fear the constancy of a man who braves even the shaft of ridicule, by openly avowing me the woman of his choice; for I can see many a sneering smile, glance from my aunt to her son, whenever they are witness to his attention to your Meriel. My father and mother seem totally regard∣less, whether I am married now, or when he returns; and I believe, if the truth was known, and very little concerned about my future welfare. But yet, Celia, my bosom cannot forget its natural affections, or divest itself of those strong sensations of duty, love and veneration, which ever have warmed it, since my infant tongue first lisp'd the tender name of mother. As to my father, I cannot say I feel any emotions in his favour, nor can it be expected I should, after the scenes which I have imparted to you, the horrors
<PB N="132" REF="029439_0152_0FE112CCCFE15E60"/>
of which will never be removed from my mind. Alas! they often recur to my ima∣gination and cast a gloom over every rising pleasure. Yet, as a man whose happiness is nearly connected with my mother's; as the man whom nature requires me to regard, I will pay him every necessary respect, and as sar as the narrow limits of my power will permit, will promote his interest and felicity.</P>
<P><HI>May</HI> 19<HI>th.</HI></P>
<P>Celia, he is gone; I have this moment bade him farewell. I feel there are moments when all the fortitude, we boast, sinks into nothing opposed to the struggles of nature; would you believe it, at the moment when I saw him step into the chaise, I would have given worlds, had I possessed them, to have been his wife, that I might have gone with him, beheld him to the very last moment of embarkation, and even then have stood on the shore to catch a last look at the expand∣ed sails which bore him from me, till by de∣grees they lessened to my view, and at length were lost in the vast horizon.</P>
<P>My aunt and cousins where with us drinking tea; Rainsforth came in, when I instantly saw something was the matter. The order is at length arrived, said I, men∣tally,
<PB N="133" REF="029439_0153_0FE112D0A93F2888"/>
and he comes to bid me adieu; I hand∣ed him a cup of tea, he put it to his lips but did not taste it. "I am come Miss Howard," said he, "to take my leave; the fleet sails in a few days." "Do you go this evening," said my mother. "In a few moments, ma∣dam," said he, "I just recieved the letter, and accidently met with two brother officers, who were going in a chaise, and gladly ac∣cepted me as a third; we mean to take two stages to night, and shall be in Portsmouth by to-morrow noon." At that moment the chaise stopped at the door. Rainsforth rose, bowed to my aunt and cousins, thanked them for all civilities, wished my father and mother health, and then turned toward me. My heart was full, so was his; we nei∣ther of us spoke; he pressed my hands to his lips, bowed low to hide his emotions, and was in the chaise in an instant. I knew sensibility would be deemed weakness by those who were witness to our parting; I therefore struggled to suppress my rising tears, offered up a silent prayer for his safe return, and endeavoured at a look of com∣posure, that was very foreign to my heart.</P>
<P>What may be his fate, heaven alone can tell; yet sure if worth is its peculiar care, he will not only be protected in this, but in every other danger. But alas! Celia, how
<PB N="134" REF="029439_0154_0FE112D6C6C206B8"/>
often do we see merit cut off in its full prime, whilst the unworthy are spared.</P>
<P>Surely, when the brave and good fall in their country's cause, it must be that their virtues merit such rewards as only heaven can give. They are suffered to appear on the vast theatre of life, to act a little while bright shining parts, and then are called home to receive the glorious mead of hea∣venly and unceasing joys. My mind dwell∣ing on this subject the other evening, (you know I am fond of indulging in little effu∣sions of poetry,) and painting to myself the situation of a soldier's wife, who has follow∣ed her husband to the very scene of battle, and in the morn, sending him forth to brave the hostile foe, at night sees him covered with wounds and in the agonies of death; I for a moment fancied myself in her situation, and wrote the following trifle. I send it to my Celia without an apology, because tri∣fles become valuable when they proceed from the friend we love.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>London,</HI> <DATE><HI>July</HI> 20<HI>th,</HI> 1776.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THIS brother of mine is a sad lad. He will not be content to remain where he has been placed, but has taken it into his wise head that he must go to sea; no∣thing else will suit him, he cannot, he says, be confined to the drudgery of a counting∣house, where a person may toil all their lives and rise to nothing above mediocrity. He will go to sea, where, with one bold push, it often happens that a man gains both honour and fortune. The lad seems to be possessed of the spirit of ambition, yet not that lauda∣ble ambition which acts as a stimulus to actions great and praise worthy. It is pow∣er and wealth he aims at, and be the steps ever so dirty, by which he must arrive at the desired eminence, I much fear he would not hesitate to wade thro' thick and thin.
<PB N="138" REF="029439_0158_0FE112E85CDE8C78"/>
However, as that is his fixed determination, I must e'en be content with the loss of the apprentice fee, tho' here is a fresh source of expense in fitting him out as a midshipman, for in that situation I find he can be ad∣mitted on board the ship where Rainsforth is lieutenant. I wish to my soul an intimate acquaintance with this worthy man, may be of service to him, for we often insensibly imbibe the sentiments of those with whom we associate.</P>
<P>My father, I fear, is running into his old errors; he has formed an acquaintance with a Mr. Dell, which in my opinion bodes no good. Dell appears much of the gentleman in his manner, but young Mossop says he is a professed gambler, and I am rather inclin∣ed to believe this assertion, as my father is frequently out with him till three or four in the morning, and has drained us so of mo∣ney, that we have not a single guinea for house expences; this will occasion our get∣ting into debt, and I am afraid my father has already borrowed money on the strength of my promise, in regard to my fortune; if so all my endeavours to preserve my mother from want will be ineffectual. This Dell has a wife, whom he once brought to spend an afternoon with us; I do not like her; there was something in her dress and man∣ner,
<PB N="139" REF="029439_0159_0FE112EDE7167458"/>
bold, forward and disgusting; she has been pretty, and is vain enough to think she is so now. My mother does not admire her any more than myself, and only that she thinks it would highly disoblige my father, she would by no means either recieve or re∣turn her visits.</P>
<P>Another source of unhappiness to this dear suffering woman is my father's giving way to a habit of drinking, for he is almost continually intoxicated, and so extremely captious and ill natured that it is next to im∣possible to say or do any thing to please him. Poor dear mother how my heart bleeds for your afflictions; how many years have you past wherein you can scarcely say, you have seen one happy hour; and could I, but lead you to repose your sorrows on the bosom of your child! but no, you think that child unworthy of your love, unworthy your con∣fidence; and she dares not clear herself, lest by endeavouring to remove one sorrow from your heart, she should throw another on it that would crush you with its weight.</P>
<P>I have heard from Rainsforth but once since the fleet sailed. Oh! Celia, should he one day afflict my heart, by harshness, cru∣elty or infidelity; ah! my friend, if the thought thus wrings my bosom, what would
<PB N="140" REF="029439_0160_0FE112F35AE4B078"/>
the reality do; and yet, I would endeavour to bear it with the meekness of a wife, and the fortitude of a christian; but me thinks I would wish to sink at once under the dread∣ful certainty; doubt and suspicion would torture me to the very utmost of my strength to bear, but to be convinced I had out lived his affection, must, I am convinced, be in∣stant death or madness.</P>
<P>My letters have now nothing interesting in them; Indeed, Celia, I begin to think every thing insipid and tiresome, that is not concerning Rainsforth; even reading no more amuses. If I read of a worthy charac∣ter, such a one I cry is my Frederic; then I drop the book to muse upon his virtues, and if I take up my pen I can write but an invocation to heaven for his safety. The on∣ly relief I find is in constant employment, and therefore, I seldom pass an idle hour, my needle, my pencil, and my domestic con∣cerns, pleasingly variegate the scene, and prevent my complaining of lassitude. I go out but little, and see but few visitors, my cousins indeed frequently call, but as I do not mix in the same gay circles they do, I can join but little in their conversation; they tell me many lively anecdotes that amuse me; I listen to their account of a ball, a concert, or any other fashionable amusement

<P>WILL my dear Meriel believe that it is with pain I take up my pen to ad∣dress her; that I am at loss for words, yet ardently long to pour out my soul before her. I have braved the perils of the sea, my love, I am safe arrived at my destined port, but not within sight of happiness. Alas! that golden dream which has buoyed me up, and cheer∣ed me whilst absent from all my soul held dear, is vanished. The lovely prize which I thought would have rewarded all my hard∣ships, is wrested from me. Oh! beloved Meriel, I am lost, forlorn, and wretched. You never can be mine, Meriel: never!

<P>My father is a bankrupt, nor has he saved enough from the wreck of his fortune to sup∣port even for a few months, his wife and three small children: and shall not I, who receiv∣ed from him life, education, every valuable gift: shall not I prefer his happiness to my own?

<P>"ADIEU, forever," did you say: no, Rainsforth, no! we shall yet meet many times, our souls are congenial; they
<PB N="146" REF="029439_0166_0FE1130F0EBA1C70"/>
were animated the by same spark of intel∣lectual fire, and tho' we cannot claim a near∣er tie, we shall be friends to the latest hour of our existence.</P>
<P>My generous, noble friend, I do not blush to say my esteem, (nay call it love, if you will) is increased by this proof of your mag∣nanimity; call it not a resignation, I am your's I will never be another's; unless I can find one your superior in every virtue, that can exalt and dignify human nature, and in saying that, I think I am irrevocably bound to you. There may be men who possess equal goodness of heart, but there can be none who can boast a superiority.</P>
<P>I am sensibly affected at your father's mis∣fortunes; would to heaven it was in my power to remove every affliction far from him. Not so much from the idea that his troubles have interrupted my happiness; but that I am certain your feeling heart suf∣fers those misfortunes doubly, in seeing them inflicted on one so deservedly dear to you. But let us look forward my friend; the prospect is not so dark, but that the sun of prosperity may yet brake forth to enliven it; you may yet live to see your father reinstat∣ed in the afluence, from which he is at pre∣sent removed by an all-wise Providence, on∣ly
<PB N="147" REF="029439_0167_0FE11312A4CC0B40"/>
to teach him the value of past blessings. We never know rightly, how to prize a be∣nefit, till we have known what it is to lose it; I write feelingly Rainsforth, for, I knew not half your worth till the very moment that I saw an insuperable barrier placed between us, and now I wish I had listened to your solicita∣tions, for then at this moment I might have administered comfort to your drooping spi∣rits, and assisted in the delightful task of soothing the sorrows of your parents. But why should I be so selfish, the pleasure would have been all my own; for sure I knew your generous heart too well, to suppose it would not have suffered from the idea of my sharing in afflictions, which could not have been prevented, and hardly admit of any aleviation. To say I felt nothing when I read your pathetic letter, would be to pro∣nounce myself insensible. Believe me, I felt all; nay, perhaps more than you could have wished; however, of this be assured, that nothing but a total change in you can occa∣tion any alteration in my sentiments. If it will be more conducive to your happiness; here let the correspondence cease, and should you hereafter meet a woman, whose merits and fortune render her worthy your attach∣ment; may you be as happy in the union

The money I presented to my mother, when I took possession of my fortune, is all mould∣ered away, and even the little capital I had reserved for myfelf, broke in upon. I know you will say I am pursuing my notions of filial duty now to imprudence; I fear I am, and yet, my dear Celia, were you situ∣ated as I am, I so well know your heart, that I am certain you would have conducted yourself exactly in the same manner.</P>
<P>About three days since, a gentleman cal∣led and presented a bill for payment, drawn by my brother, who had given my mother notice of his design; but she, fearful of mentioning it, as she had no means of an∣swering the demand, had kept it to herself. It was for an hundred pounds. Ungenerous lad! when he knew how narrow our circum∣stances were, and how much his inconsistent conduct had embarrassed us. When the man brought the bill, my poor mother turn∣ed pale as ashes. "What is the matter, madam," said I. She called me into the next room, and putting the bill into my hand, (for it was some days after sight) she said, "what must I do." "Indeed my dear madam," I replied, "I cannot tell. It is not in my power to do any more, the bill must be protested, and I hope it will teach him frugality in future. I am sure he must
<PB N="150" REF="029439_0170_0FE1132145AC8F78"/>
have been very extravagant, or he never could have wanted money so soon, consider∣ing the sum he took with him." She made me no answer, but bursting into tears cried, "then all is over, my poor Richard." I ne∣ver can see my mother in affliction, but my heart yearns spontaniously to fly to her re∣lief. How then could I behold her tears unmoved, how hold back that comfort she required, when she thus continued to address me. "I know, Meriel, we have almost re∣duced you to beggary, I am fully sensible how much we owe to your generosity." "Dear, dear mother, talk not so," said I, throwing my arms about her, "I have done nothing but my duty, and I think it still my duty to preserve the remainder of my for∣tune, to comfort you in your declining age." "But think of your brother, Meriel," cried she eagerly, "think my dear girl, what straits he may reduced to in a foreign land. If this bill is not paid, my poor boy will be thrown into prison, and be lost for want of a friend to comfort him. Oh! Meriel, re∣fuse not your mother this one request." And ah! my Celia, may I never meet such ano∣ther trial. The dear woman knelt; yes, my mother knelt to me before I had the time or power to prevent her. "Good heavens!" said I, "this is too much, take me, dear mother, do with me and mine as
<PB N="151" REF="029439_0171_0FE113253B19A380"/>
you think proper, only I beseech you do not let me be thus humiliated. 'Tis I should have knelt to you, oh! rise, and do not thus distress me. I will pay the bill."</P>
<P>The next day I took up money sufficient for that purpose, and also to discharge some few debts in the neighbourhood, so that our income is now so reduced that I must be obliged to turn my thoughts towards some genteel employment, however repugnant it is to my father and mother's inclinations. In my opinion, the person who has talents, health and spirits to earn a subsistence, is in all respects independent, and there is no∣thing to me would be more painful, than to eat the bread of indolence. Pride may teach another lesson, but then it is not the pride which elevates the human heart. It shall be ever my pride to keep free from ob∣ligation. It is always a painful sense, but more especially when we have no power to return it. Let my habitation be ever so humble, and my fare ever so coarse, if they are the fruits of my own industry, they will be sweeter, more comfortable by far, than the greatest luxuries purchased by the cringe of servility.</P>

<P>MY ever loved, my constant Meriel will, I am certain, rejoice to hear that my father is again restored to affluence. A distant relation, lately dead, has bequeathed the whole of his wealth, which is very conside∣rable, to our family. To me he has given five thousand pounds. Then let me hasten to bid my beloved Meriel be prepared to see me; for this day week, I will come to de∣mand her long promised hand, and seal my∣self before the altar, her's eternally.</P>

<P>And shall I now ever dare to complain of past trials, my Celia? has not this proof of his love and constancy endeared him more than ever to my heart? Oh my friend, my spirits are so agitated, I cannot write or speak with any coherence, I must throw aside my pen and endeavour to compose my thoughts.</P>

<P>Two days more and I shall see him; think me not weak, if I tell you I shall count the hours with impatience. After a seperation of near two years, how pleasing to meet a friend whom we know to be so worthy, and whom we had given up as lost. Farewell, my dear Celia, your pleasures are all of the calm un∣russled kind, like the smooth stream that glides beneath a lofty bank, by which it is defended from the rude blasts of wind.

<P>I HAVE expected morning after morning with hope, and each day as it arrived brought with it only disappointment. I will decieve myself no longer, nothing but death, or extreme illness could have kept him from me, tho' I have been told that he meant from the first to decieve me, and that my easy fondness has been a theme for ridcule for him and his gay companions. But I cannot believe it, Celia, if he is false, where shall we find a man worthy to be esteemed. No, Rainsforth, there certainly must be some very urgent cause for this absence, this, I had almost said, cruel silence; but I will not give up the opinion I have formed of your integrity.</P>

<P>Celia, I am ill, very ill, my heart has re∣cieved a shock it will never recover; Rains∣forth
<PB N="155" REF="029439_0175_0FE113385FC5ED28"/>
is married! married to another, and within a fortnight after the day appointed to unite him to me.</P>
<P>My cousin Hester called on me yesterday to take a walk; we called on a lady of her acquaintance who has a sister married at Plymouth, for Hester suggested that through her means we might gain some intelligence concerning Rainsforth. After the usual ce∣remonies, when we were seated, Hester en∣quired when she had heard from her sister, "I had a letter yesterday," she replied, "Kitty has been very gay, I assure you, they have had great doings at Plymouth, Miss Kingly, the great heiress, was married last Monday, and Kitty was at the wedding." "And pray who is she married to?" said Hester. "A young officer in the navy," she replied, "whom she has been fond of for some time; I really forget his name, but there is the letter, you may read the whole account."</P>
<P>I do not know how I supported my∣self, while I cast my eye over the letter, as my cousin held it in her hand, but I caught the name of Rainsforth; my head grew giddy, I turned cold and faint; but by the exertion of my resolution avoided making myself ridiculous. "Upon my word," cou∣sin,
<PB N="156" REF="029439_0176_0FE1133DFB0A70E0"/>
said Hester without any regard to my feelings, in exposing me to a stranger, "up∣on my word, this is very unaccountable." "Why pray," said the lady, "is it the Mr. Rainsforth I have seen so often with you Miss Mossop?" "The very same, and will you believe it, he was under a promise of marriage to my cousin here; do you not think it very scandalous behaviour?" "Scan∣dalous indeed: if I was in Miss Howard's place I would sue him for half his wife's for∣tune."</P>
<P>"I shall not give either myself or him that trouble, madam, (I replied with as much composure as I could assume,) I think since he has proved himself of so fickle a nature, he has done me a favour rather than an injury, as it would have been much more painful to me to lose the affection of a husband than a lover. Pride my dear ma∣dam added I with a forced smile) keeps up our spirits on these occasions."</P>
<P>I returned home from this visit with a heavy heart, but still flattered myself there might be some mistake; but the receipt of the letter I inclose for your perusal has re∣moved every doubt.</P>

<HEAD>MERIEL to CELIA, (in continuation.)</HEAD>
<P>WITH this letter, my dear Celia, came a parcel containing all the letters I had ever wrote a Rainsforth; and believe me, the unfeeling tenor of his father's letter did not hurt me half so much, as the idea of his cruelty, in suffering his father first to peruse, and then return them; my pride was alarm∣ed, my sensibility shocked! a man in whom I placed such implicit confidence; one whom I thought endowed with every virtue. Celia, I feel a painful void in my heart; I feel that I shall never again place a confidence in any man. My cousin Hester has frequently told me, that Rainsforth was decietful, that he
<PB N="5" REF="029439_0180_0FE1134C0AB06F58"/>
saw my partiality and played upon it, mere∣ly for his own diversion; but I always doubt∣ed; nay, to such a height was my enthu∣siasm raised, I could not have believed it possible for one who wore so fair a semblance of virtue, to be so very false, so unaccounta∣bly wanton in his cruelty towards an inof∣fensive girl, whose whole soul was absorbed in one affectionate wish for his felicity: why, when I had taught my heart to resign him without a murmur; why, when the first hard trial was past, and every hope was ex∣tinguished, did he seek to awaken a passion, which, tho' reason had in some measure re∣pelled its violence, was still tender, still ar∣dent in my bosom. Oh! my friend, had he without renewing the correspondence which we had mutually agreed to drop, given his hand to Miss Kingly, I should not have com∣plained; no, my Celia, so pure was my love, that I should have exulted in his felici∣ty, and whilst I thought him worthy of every blessing, have rejoiced to see them placed within his reach. But alas! he is not wor∣thy, and perhaps this poor gentle affection∣ate girl, for such I am told she is, may soon experience a change in his sentiments, when she has neither the power to leave him, nor liberty to complain of his conduct.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="029439_0181_0FE113511AE9D8C8"/>
<HI>May</HI> 20<HI>th.</HI></P>
<P>I begin to be more composed; I am re∣solved to despise the whole sex; they may wear a semblance of virtue, but the reality of it is foreign to their hearts. Every oc∣currence of life will be now equally indiffer∣ent to me; I have vowed to devote myself to my mother while she lives, and whenever heaven pleases to call her away, my inces∣sant prayer shall be soon to follow; I do not wish to go before her, because, I see her only hope of support must proceed from me; and unboundedly grateful will be my heart, if by any means whatever I can preserve her from misery.</P>

<P>It was certainly a wise dispensation of Pro∣vidence, that prevented my union with Rainsforth; had I been separated from my dear mother, where now would she have found a comforter. My father is in prison Celia; my whole fortune is expended; but thank heaven, I have still health and strength to work. I live in a miserable apartment in the Fleet prison, I sit lost as it were to every thing but misery; but yet, my dear Celia, I can look up to heaven with grati∣tude; I am not a wife, I am not a mother, I feel not the strong chords of maternal af∣fection

twining round my heart, and wring∣ing it with unutterable anguish; I might have been more wretched than I am: and whilst I can say that, let me express only gratitude towards the great Ruler of the uni∣verse, who has not tried me beyond my strength to support. Can you think, my friend, that in this miserable situation I have yet one ray of comfort breaks on my benight∣ed soul; yes, Celia, I have: my dear mother is at length convinced, that my love, my duti∣ful attentions, are the result of the feelings of my heart. On me alone she now rests; to me alone looks for comfort; her eyes once more beam on me with affection; her heart again is lift up to heaven for my felicity; and who my dear friend, who that knows the just value of maternal love, would not gladly resign wealth, nay almost every con∣sideration, to enjoy so inestimable a blessing.</P>
<P>I cannot at this time give you particu∣lars; indeed, I know not why I should write to you at all, for sure my letters convey no pleasure to your friendly bosom, but I cannot give up the greatest pleasure of my life, unless you expressly desire it. To you I can unfold my thoughts; to you, toll the sorrows of my heart; and as I write, fond fancy represents you as feeling for my afflictions: I see the tear of sympathy tremble in your eye; I hear the

<P>I HAVE now sat down, to give you the particulars of a scene, which, when I last wrote, I could not command sufficient com∣posure to deleniate. I had been out one af∣ternoon on particular business; indeed to look after some employment, whereby I might conduce to the support of the family. On my return I found my mother weeping
<PB N="9" REF="029439_0184_0FE1135DA7043090"/>
over a bit of paper, which she held in her hand. I enquired the cause. She gave me the paper, and I read on it, "Barwell, She∣riff's officer, Carey-street." "Your father is arrested, Meriel," said she. "Gracious heaven!" said I, "then we are all ruined: but what is the sum; at whose suit is he arrested." "At the suit of that villain Dell," she replied, "for fifty pounds, which he has lent him; no doubt at the gaming table; he also threatens him with a prose∣cution for a criminal correspondence with his wife. Oh heavens!" continued she, re∣doubling her tears, "when shall I die and be at peace." It was in vain to offer con∣solation. I did not even attempt it, but re∣solved, if possible, to see if any thing could be done, either to ward off the impending blow, or to extricate us from the difficulties attending it. I went immediately to an at∣torney, made him acquainted with the case, and requested his advice. He told me there was no redress, that the money must be paid, and in case of the prosecution, it was most likely he would be cast with damages. This intelligence was an additional weight upon my spirits. However, I proceeded to Carey∣street, where I found this thoughtless father surrounded by unfortunate men of the low∣est class, with a bowl of punch before him, and in the very act of singing a drinking
<PB N="10" REF="029439_0185_0FE113636A7D6160"/>
song. When he saw me, he looked abashed. I asked if I coud speak to him in another room, for my soul shrunk from the society of those unhappy beings, with whom he seemed so pleased. When we were accom∣modated with another apartment, I asked him, how this debt was contracted, and by what means he meant to discharge it. I can∣not repeat to you the answer he made; it was so replete with contradiction, that I had scarcely patience to hear him out. When he had finished, I enquired, if that debt was paid, were there no others of the same sort. "Consider sir," said I, "it will not be long I shall have it in my power to answer these demands, and when my money is entirely expended, where is my dear mother to find support." "Ah Meriel," said he, "you are always more anxious about her than me, you don't care what becomes of your father." "I should think, sir," said I with some warmth, "that I had given sufficient proof of my attention to the happiness of both. I am sorry to use any language to a father, which may be deemed improper; but I must say, had you paid as much attention to your own happiness as was undoubtedly your duty, many of the afflictions, if not all which have fallen upon our family, might have been avoided. I will pay this money sir, and I hope you will not think I take too
<PB N="11" REF="029439_0186_0FE11366737E82A8"/>
great a liberty if I advise you, hereafter to shun such unworthy acquaintance as Dell, and strive rather to obtain some genteel em∣ployment, by which these kind of scenes may in future be avoided.</P>
<P>"You talk like a very unfeeling girl, Meriel," said he. "Do you imagine then it is so easy for a man, born and brought up a gentleman, to submit to the drudgery of ser∣vitude: no Miss; if your ideas are so mean, mine are not, I will starve first, and would rather see you starve than have my family disgraced by your following any servile, mean employment." Believe me, Celia, when he uttered these sentiments, I felt so irritated by his foolish pride, that had not the idea of my suffering mother at that moment obtruded on my mind, I should have left him to his fate. However, I stifled my rising an∣ger, and having given him a draught on my banker to discharge the arrest, returned to console my mother. When I entered, I was surprised to see her grief more violent than ever. She was wringing her hands and weep∣ing with great bitterness. After many fruit∣less enquiries concerning this fresh torrent of sorrow, I learnt that Mr. Lesage, the ban∣ker, with whom I had placed the trifling rem∣nant of my fortune, was declared a bankrupt. To describe my feelings is impossible. How∣ever
<PB N="12" REF="029439_0187_0FE1136BAEABE040"/>
I saw my mother wanted comfort, and I exerted my utmost power to stifle emotions, which if indulged, would only serve to in∣crease her anguish.</P>
<P>"We must go to prison," said she, "we must all go to prison, and who is to support us there?" "Providence, my dear mother," said I, "We will place our hopes on that be∣nign power, who never forsakes those, who, in full confidence of support, exert their utmost abilities and rely on him only for success. Come, come, chear up, thank God, I am healthy and able to work." She gaz∣ed on me for a moment; then throwing her arms round me, she cried, "oh! my child, I will doubt your virtue no longer; your heart must be pure, or you could not thus rely on heaven for support; but oh! my dear Meriel, it will wound my heart se∣verely to see you obliged to labour for sub∣sistence." "Do not think of it," said I; "let me see you but tolerably happy and I shall not regret any hardship, however se∣vere: I will never leave you, my beloved mother; only let me be once more called the child of your affection, and I shall think myself completely rewarded for every suffer∣ing it may please heaven to inflict." A few days after this, my father was removed to this miserable place: we sold the best part
<PB N="13" REF="029439_0188_0FE11371444093C8"/>
of our furniture and cloaths to discharge the debts owing among our trades people. My mother then came to my father: I do not sleep in the prison, but come here every morning; I perform all their domestic of∣fices, go out for their provision, &amp;c. but as yet, have not been able to procure any work. Indeed, I had hope of being em∣ployed by an embroiderer, but on being asked to give security, for the safety of what∣ever work I might be entrusted with; I un∣fortunately happened to mention, being re∣lated to Mr. Mossop's family; of course, the master of the shop applied to my aunt for my character. Celia, this aunt denied any knowledge of me, said she had no relation who was in circumstances to want employ∣ment of that kind, that she had some know∣ledge of a young woman of the name of Howard, she believed, I might be very ho∣nest but I was certainly no relation of her's.</P>
<P>Thus my dear girl, was my laudable de∣sign frustrated; for the man naturally enough observed if I could be guilty of tell∣ing a lie; I might be capable of worse ac∣tions. I hope, however, in a short time to procure something to do; for our little stock of money diminishes very fast.</P>

<HI>August</HI> 15<HI>th,</HI> 1778.</P>
<P>Of all the scenes through which we are doomed to pass, sure none is so truly pain∣ful, as that of being witness to the death of those whom nature has placed in a near re∣lation to us; whom, spite of all their errors, we cannot wholly divest our hearts of ten∣derness for; and to see them approach the awful confines of eternity in a frame of mind, that renders all offered comfort ineffectual, to calm their doubts and fears, when the retrospect of their past lives fills them only with horror; and the idea of futurity brings nothing but despair. Such a scene I have lately past; my father is no more: he is I hope at peace; to think otherwise would be an agony too great to bear: poor man, to the very last he was addicted to the fatal errors that had undone him. Few were the hours he spent in the apartment with my mother, being chiefly at a place, which they call the tap, where he could drown his care, as he vainly imagined, and where he was frequently drawn in to play cards, tho' some∣times for the last six-pence he had in his pocket.</P>
<P>One evening, at this place he quarrelled with his antagonist, and high words ensued; from words they went to blows, and my fa∣ther
<PB N="15" REF="029439_0190_0FE1137A7B2E6400"/>
recieved a stroke on his temple, which leveled him with the ground. He fell with the back of his head against an iron fender which cut him severely and fractured the skull; all assistance was vain; he languished four days, in all the complicated agonies of pain of body and distress of mind; tho' I flatter myself he had some internal comfort in his last moments, as he seemed more composed for about two hours before his death. He earnestly requested forgiveness of both my mother and myself, for the manifold injuries he had done us; but to my great comfort, mentioned no particulars: he also made a declaration before witnesses that the man who struck the unfortunate blow, was en∣tirely guiltless of intentional malice, as he had been the first aggressor himself; and the fall was entirely accidental. He express∣ed a wish to see his sister; in compliance with his earnest desire I went to her, told her of the melancholy accident, and earnest∣ly requested she would visit my dying father.</P>
<P>"Upon my word Meriel," said she, "I am extremely sorry for this shocking affair; but you know child my seeing him will be of no use; it will only be hurting my own feelings, with out being of the least service to your father. I never can bear scenes of this kind; my sensibility is so exquisite, that, was I to see my poor brother in this situa∣tion,
<PB N="16" REF="029439_0191_0FE11380465DAB50"/>
I should not recover it for a month. Ah! poor man, he was always getting into some mischief or other; he never prospered in any thing after his marriage with your mother."</P>
<P>"You cannot suppose, madam, that the want of prosperity was to be attributed to that union."</P>
<P>"Why, I don't know, Meriel, my bro∣ther never loved your mother, but was art∣fully drawn in." "By whom, madam?" "By your grand mother, Miss, who wished to get a good settlement for her daugh∣ter. Your mother too, pretended such a violent affection for him, that he could not refuse some little return of kindness, and they never ceased their arts till they had noosed him fast."</P>
<P>"You talk in riddles, madam, my mother brought my father a genteel fortune."</P>
<P>"It was nothing, Miss, to the fortune he might have expected, if he had not of∣fended his father; I always said no good would come of the match." "It is much to be wished, indeed, madam," said I, "that such a union never had taken place; it would have spared my dear mother many
<PB N="17" REF="029439_0192_0FE11385F416A7E0"/>
years of severe anguish, and my unfortunate self would never have seen the light." As I said this my heart was so oppressed I could not refrain my tears. "Bless me! my dear," said Mrs. Mossop, in an affected accent of kindness; "I did not mean to vex you, you are not to be blamed for your parents faults."</P>
<P>"If they have faults, madam," said I, "be assured I wish not to hear of them, it would be a painful topic at any time, but pardon me, if I say, at this particular season, it is a cruel one. I come to intreat you to visit a brother, who is poor and dying in prison. I should think, had he millions of faults, at this moment they would be all for∣gotten; that you would remember only his afflictions, and that he was your brother." I spoke this with some warmth; my aunt hesitated for an answer; at length she told me she would come the next morning. "It will be too late, madam," said I, "it is thought he cannot live the night out." "Dear, dear," she replied, "it is so un∣fortunate that I have a large party coming this afternoon, but if they leave me in any tolerable season"—I would hear no more, but turning from her with a mixture of con∣tempt and pity, I returned to the habitation of mourning and death. When I entered
<PB N="18" REF="029439_0193_0FE1138B9FEB3FD8"/>
the room, my father enquired eagerly if she would come; I thought it would be wrong to disturb his last moments, with an account of her unfeeling conduct, I therefore only told him, she was not able to come that evening, but would be there early in the morning. "It will be too late then," said he, "I must write to her." It was in vain we remonstrated; he would be raised in the bed, with a design to write; but his head would not permit him to trace even a single letter: he was seized with faintings and when he recovered seemed to have forgot his design. He spoke but little afterwards, was wholly taken up in prayer: tho' he frequently cried out in agony, "'tis all in vain, I cannot be forgiven." A worthy well disposed clergyman prayed besided him, and said a great deal to compose him, and calm his doubts. It had in some measure the desired effect: and about four o'clock in the morning, he resigned his soul into the hand of Him who gave it.</P>
<P>My mother's sorrow is not to be describ∣ed. All thought of our dreadful, desolate situation was entirely absorbed in this heavy affliction. I did not attempt to interrupt her grief, as I thought, if suffered to take its natural course, time would meliorate a sorrow, which, any attempt at present to
<PB N="19" REF="029439_0194_0FE11390546EB680"/>
soften, would but increase. In the course of the next day, we expected my aunt to make the promised visit; but as the day pas∣sed without seeing her, in the evening my mother desired me to go to her again, and inform him of our loss. I went, but was suffered to wait near an hour, before she ap∣peared; nor did my cousins come near me, tho' I heard them laughing and talking in the next room. Ah! said I, mentally, the afflicted are never admitted chearfully; they are left to indulge their own sad thoughts in solitude. Cruel Hester and Susan, had you been in affliction, would not I have abridged my own pleasures to comfort and console you. When my aunt entered the room she began; "realy Meriel I have not been able to visit my brother before; but now I have half an hour to spare, I will send for a coach, and we will go together." "Your visit will no doubt be acceptable to my mother, dear madam," said I, "but my father is no long∣er in a situation."—</P>
<P>"He is dead then," cried she eagerly.</P>
<P>I bowed my head in silence.</P>
<P>"Well," continued she, "I rather ex∣pected it, and I am much obliged to you for calling, to let me know, as I should have
<PB N="20" REF="029439_0195_0FE11395E2E384C0"/>
been greatly shocked to have found him dead, when I had called, as I certainly should, either this evening or to-morow morning."</P>
<P>"My mother bid me ask your advice con∣cerning the funeral madam, and not only your advice, but your assistance."</P>
<P>"Assistance, for what child?"</P>
<P>"Could you advance us a little money?"</P>
<P>"Money, Miss Howard! You astonish me; it is impossible you can be in want of money, when you came to possession of so handsome a fortune within these two years."</P>
<P>"I am very sorry madam, that you can suppose me capable of suffering my parents to languish in prison for fifty pounds, if I could have commanded such a sum."</P>
<P>"Why as to that Meriel, I thought you were acting like a prudent girl, and meant to take care of yourself; for I know you paid a great deal of money for your father, and might have continued so doing till you had ruined yourself."</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="029439_0196_0FE11398A19BFD18"/>
"I should certainly have paid this last debt, madam, had not the failure of Mr. Lesage put it entirely out of my power."</P>
<P>"Oh I remember hearing, that you lost six hundred pounds by his failure, but you surely had a larger sum by you than that."</P>
<P>"Indeed aunt, that six hundred pounds was all the dependence I had in the world."</P>
<P>"Upon my word Meriel, I never was more astonished in my life. How have you contrived to run thro' all that money. Your mother and yourself must have been very ex∣travagant, and when that is the case, nothing will save people from ruin. I am very sorry child, very sorry; but it is not in my pow∣er to help you; I have a large family, and the education of my daughters is expensive. As to my poor brother, why, my advice is, that you have him buried as privately, and with as little expense as possible. You will remember me to your mother; tell her I am réally concerned at her trouble; but it is entirely out my power to help her, nor indeed, do I think it would be of any use; for was she releived from these difficulties, she would soon be involved by her impru∣dence, in others of the same sort."</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="029439_0197_0FE113A389A79A78"/>
When I repeated this conversation to my mother, she said, "it is no more than I ex∣pected, my dear child; but I let you go to make trial of her heart, that you might be convinced, how little depedence is to be placed on professions of friendship, made to us in our prosperity; and how little assist∣ance is to be hoped from relations. We will sell every valuable of our cloaths and plate, to lay your father decently in the ground, and to pay the debt for which I now am become liable. It will, I am cer∣tain, leave us almost destitute; but when we have our liberty, we can perhaps gain employment of some kind or other, I will not mind how abject; for I would rather hardly earn, or indeed beg my bread from strangers, than be subject to the unkind∣ness of haughty, unfeeling relations."</P>
<P>This resolution was immediately execut∣ed, and when all expences were discharg∣ed, we found ourselves possessed of five guineas, some trifling household furniture, and the meanest of our cloaths. With these we left that abode of misery, the Fleet pri∣son, and have taken a cheap lodging, on the Surry side of Black friars bridge. I have endeavoured to get some work, but as yet without effect; and what adds to my un∣easiness, is, that my dear mother's health
<PB N="23" REF="029439_0198_0FE1139EB0911B00"/>
daily declines. As I have no other amuse∣ment, I spend a good deal of time at my pen. I have wrote several little poems, which I intend to correct and offer to some bookseller. Perhaps by that means, I may obtain something towards our subsistance. I feel a transient ray of hope dawn upon my mind. My mother smiling, tells me, I am too sanguine; but my dear Celia, I always was inclined to take the brightest side of the prospect, to hope for the best, and when disappointment arrives, to submit with as much patience as I can. I am what is ge∣nerally termed a castle builder; it is a weak∣ness (if it deserves the appellation) from which I derive amusement at least, and tho' I know at the very moment I am indulging those sanguine ideas, that my hopes have no more foundation, than the bubble blown from the pipe of a playful boy; yet I can∣not help being pleased with the airy fabric of my own creating, and as soon as one va∣nishes, (to continue the allusion) I puff out another, and so prevent myself from be∣coming a prey to despair. And, believe me Celia, I consider this disposition, as one of the choicest gifts of heaven. Adieu my friend; may you be happier than </P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXVII. MERIEL to CELIA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>London,</HI> <DATE><HI>December</HI> 5<HI>th,</HI> 1778.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>IT is now some months since I have taken up my pen to address my dear Celia. Several times lately I have essayed to do it, but unable to bear a retrospect of my late heavy affliction, have from time to time, de∣ferred the painful recital, till I begin to fear my dear friend will think I am either num∣bered with the dead, or become forgetful of her friendship. I have a long tale to tell my dear girl, a tale, which I fear, will steal many a tear from your eyes as you peruse it. In my last I informed you of my mother's ill health, and how unable we were to procure any pro∣per advice or assistance. From that time her malady daily increased. I finished my little collection of poems and presented them to a bookseller; but he told me, I had mistaken my talents, and that the whole collection was
<PB N="25" REF="029439_0200_0FE113ACD3053B70"/>
not worth a guinea. Disheartened and dispiri∣ted I returned to my mother, and now gave up my whole time to watching and attend∣ing her. Her disorder increased with such rapidity, that in the course of a few weeks she was confined to her bed. What a pros∣pect had I now before me, a beloved parent sinking by slow degrees into the grave; when I had no method of procuring the comforts, and even the necessaries of life were denied. I had parted with all our apparel, except a change of linen, and had now past one whole day without food. My mother made no complaints; but her pale wan countenance, was to me a thousand times more affecting than unavailing exclamations. Our credit had been long lost in the neighbourhood, and I knew that in a few days we must in∣evitably perish for want. In this situation, I took a resolution to go out in the close of the evening and solicit the charity of the benevo∣lent. I told my tale of sorrow to many of my own sex. They either heard me not, or disbelieved my assertions, and after saunter∣ing through the streets near three hours, one cold wet night in October, I at length col∣lected about six-pence, and with it having procured some trifling nourishment for my almost famished parent, I returned, allowing myself only a halfpenny roll. When I car∣ried my little morsel to her bedside, she
<PB N="26" REF="029439_0201_0FE113B207072608"/>
anxiously enquired how I had procured it. "Some charitable disposed person," said I, "gave me the means; take it my mother, eat and be comforted."</P>
<P>Sinking nature required support; she eat the offered morsel, but seasoned it with tears of heartfelt anguish.</P>
<P>The next day I determined again to try my new employment, and for that purpose wandered out towards the park. It was Sun∣day, the day was fine, I went in and seating myself on a bench, looked at the gay throng that crowded the mall, compared their situa∣tions with my own, and began to think my∣self the most unfortunate of human beings. I knew I had never deviated from the path of virtue; I had never committed any ac∣tion deserving such abject misery, and I saw many women who had forfeited all claim to honour and respect, enjoying all the luxuries of life. At that moment reason, religion, in∣tegrity forsook me; and I wished myself in the same situation with those victims to vice, if by so doing, I could procure sustenance for my mother.</P>
<P>You will, perhaps ask, my dear Celia, if we had no friends whatever, to whom we could apply for relief; alas! my dear girl, you
<PB N="27" REF="029439_0202_0FE113B6344F1148"/>
know nothing of the world; those who have drank deep of the cup of affliction can tell, that poverty and friendship are utter stran∣gers to each other. While I was indulging these painful reflections, an elderly gentle∣woman, seated herself beside me, and view∣ing my person and dress with a scrutinizing eye, began some trifling discourse, and at length asked me, if I was born in London. From chatting at first on indifferent subjects, we began to remark the different appear∣ances of the passing multitude. The old lady's remarks were just and pertinent; her dis∣course breathed the true spirit of philanthro∣py. I imagined I had found a friend, and without reserve unbosomed myself to her; related my story of past and present distress; she heard me with attention, and, me thought, I saw a gleam of compassion pass across her features. I seized the propitious moment, and in the humblest accent peti∣tioned relief.</P>
<P>"Poor child," said she, "I believe your story to be true; innocence and simplicity, are indeliably marked upon your counte∣nance; what is in my power I will do for you, tho' the means are but small." She then drew forth her purse, and presented me with half a crown: it is only for those who have been in similar circumstances to
<PB N="28" REF="029439_0203_0FE113BBA991FBA8"/>
concieve the tide of joy that rushed upon my heart at the possession of this little piece of silver; I eagerly kissed the hand that conveyed it to me, and would have spoke, but tears were the only thanks I could re∣turn; they were the sincerest, for they came warm from the heart.</P>
<P>I left my seat with precipitation, and was preparing to return home; but my bene∣factress stopped me. "Miss Howard," said she, "I believe I have it my power to serve you; meet me here again to-morrow." I promised to meet her and returned to my mother with a heart lightened of half its sorrows. No doubt, said I, this lady will endeavour to extricate us from our present distress, and put us in some way of earning future subsistance.</P>
<P>Elated with these hopes, I repaired next day to the appointed place; but after hav∣ing waited two hours was obliged to return without seeing my benefactress. Something has detained her unexpectedly, said I, she will undoubtedly come to-morrow: but to∣morrow passed as yesterday had done, and I was again disappointed.</P>
<P>The third morning, tho' I had used the most rigid economy, I found myself again penny∣less.
<PB N="29" REF="029439_0204_0FE1083C210D3268"/>
However, spiritless and miserable as I was, I determined once more to repair to the park. My pace was slow, my looks dejected and my eyes streaming with tears. I had hardly proceeded half the length of the mall, when I heard myself called, and turning round perceived my benefactress.</P>
<P>"My good girl," said she, "I almost feared I should not meet you, I have been obliged to go into the country since I saw you, but I had not forgot you; come dry your eyes, I have met with a gentleman who will be your friend, if you mind how you behave yourself. He has sent you half a guinea; and if you will come this evening and sup at my house, in Soho square, I will introduce you to him."</P>
<P>"Alas! madam," said I, "my appear∣ance at your house will only disgrace you; nor can I suppose any gentleman will greatly interest himself in behalf of a poor unfortu∣nate girl, without requiring a return which virtue and religion will not suffer me to make."</P>
<P>"Don't be foolish, child," said the old lady, "virtue and religion are very pretty words; but pray tell me, will they keep your mother from starving."</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="029439_0205_0FE113C61FE377A8"/>
"Oh! madam," I replied, "will it not be worse than death to brand her name with in∣famy? Alas! I never could bear the scorn of the world, and the reproofs of my own conscience, oppressed with guilt and shame. Tempt me not, dear madam, to forsake the path of rectitude; let me retain my inno∣cence, and come what may, I shall die in peace."</P>
<P>"This is fine talking, Miss Howard, but let me tell you, it is a very selfish way of ar∣guing. You acknowledge, that the loss of virtue would make you unhappy. Are you not already unhappy in a superlative degree; and does that unhappiness in the least con∣tribute to relieve your own or your mother's wants. No, does not the sight of your mi∣sery rather increase hers? Come, then, my dear girl, act the heroine, take this load of sorrow upon yourself, and save a parent, whom you tenderly love, from perishing with famine."</P>
<P>This was a strange way of arguing, Celia, yet it had the desired effect, I thought it was possible to hide my infamy from my mother, and confine my misery to my own bosom. When the old woman found my resolution began to waver, she plied me with sophisti∣cal arguments, described in glowing colours
<PB N="31" REF="029439_0206_0FE113CA77F9A2B8"/>
the gaiety and splendor in which many wo∣men of loose characters lived, and contrast∣ed it strongly with my poor miserable apart∣ment, where my sure attendants were pinch∣ing cold and hunger, and my only companion a beloved parent sinking under the compli∣cated evils of sickness and famine.</P>
<P>"Oh! save me! save me!" cried I ea∣gerly, "from the dreadful thought, teach me how to snatch her from impending de∣struction, to administer support to her wast∣ing frame, and comfort her declining hours. Do with me as you will; save, protect my dear mother, and let me be the only sacri∣fice."</P>
<P>Having brought me to this horrible reso∣lution, and recieved my promise of coming to her house in the evening; she left me, and I repaired home; by the way procuring a bottle of wine and some other necessaries for my mother. She had been anxious at my long stay, and when I produced the re∣freshments, again enquired how I had pur∣chased them. A lie, (the first I had ever told her) now suggested itself; I said I had performed a little work for a lady in the neighbourhood, and she had liberally re∣warded me; but when I mentioned going out again in the evening, the pathetic man∣ner
<PB N="32" REF="029439_0207_0FE113D01A5CEE90"/>
in which she intreated me to guard my honour, as my only treasure, and as I wish∣ed to preserve her heart from breaking, almost staggered my resolution: but having given her some refreshment, I saw her spi∣rits revive, and that by degrees she sunk in∣to a sweet refreshing slumber. I determined to sacrifice every other consideration rather than see her reduced again to the extremity of misery she had so lately experienced.</P>
<P>Oh! ye rigidly virtuous of my own sex, turn not from me with horror and contempt, consider my agonizing distress, glance with an eye of compassion over the dreadful reso∣lution, and let a tear of pity blot the offence from your memories.</P>
<P>Great and painful were the struggles of my soul, while gazing on my sleeping pa∣rent. I knelt by the bedside, and would have prayed, but, alas! that consolation was denied me. How could I address a Being of infinite purity, when I was going to offer myself a sacrifice at the shrine of guilt and pollution. I thought I should have sunk un∣der the agonies I endured; once I wished for death, but then the thought of what my poor mother would suffer, immediately re∣pelled the impious desire; at length, I clasp∣ed my hands and raising my eyes to hea∣ven,
<PB N="33" REF="029439_0208_0FE113D359E34DD8"/>
cried, "Father of mercy direct me, oh! give me fortitude to bear thy dispensations as I ought, or pardon the weakness of an afflicted mortal." I then kissed my sleeping mother, and with a heart almost broken re∣paired to Soho.</P>
<P>The old woman received me cordially, but reproved my pensive countenance and swolen eyes; she made me drink some tea, and then taking me up stair<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, insisted on my dressing myself in a brown lutestring night∣gown, with a cap and linen suitable. We then went into an elegant parlour, and in a few moments Mr. Welldon was announced: he was a man upwards of thirty, of a come∣ly person, polite address, and insinuating manner; he regarded me with visible atten∣tion, and when he spoke to me, it was with a mixture of respect and polite freedom. My feelings during supper were beyond de∣scription, poignant: I could scarcely restrain my tears, but the reproving looks of the old woman told me how much they would offend her: I therefore endeavoured to stifle my emotions; but when the cloth was re∣moved and she arose to quit the room, I in∣voluntarily caught her hand, and with a look which pleaded strongly for compassion burst into tears.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="029439_0209_0FE113D9C1817B98"/>
"Why, what does the girl cry for?" said she sneeringly, "was it not by your own de∣sire you came here? come, Mr. Welldon, you must get the better of these pretty airs, tho' perhaps, indeed you may think her the more agreeable for them." Then disengaging her hand from my grasp, she left the room.</P>
<P>"Then I am inevitably lost," cried I, clasping my hands in a wild agony, and re∣doubling my tears. "My sweet girl," said Mr. Welldon, "this distress, which is too acute, to be construed into affectation, great∣ly suprises me. Was it not by your own free will that you came here to meet me?"</P>
<P>"It was, it was," said I, "but oh! sir, if you only knew the anguish it has cost me, to form the horrid design, you would pity me, indeed you would commiserate my suf∣ferings."</P>
<P>"Dear creature," said he, drawing his chair close to mine, "you know not how greatly your sorrow interests me; tell me, is there any thing within the compass of my fortune, can restore peace to your agitated bosom; say how can I serve you, how ren∣der you happy?"</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="029439_0210_0FE113DCE4ED8978"/>
"Oh! there is one way, and only one way," said I, "by which you can promote my happiness," and I dropped on my knees before him. "Rise, rise, my dear girl," said he, "and do not hesitate to point out this only way, by which I can prove myself your friend."</P>
<P>"This humliating posture best suits me," I replied, "here will I remain till I move your heart to compassion: indeed I am not that vile creature you may perhaps think me. I always avoided the inticements of vice till this fatal night; but the miseries of a beloved parent, sinking to the grave, op∣pressed by sickness and poverty drove me to sacrifice my honour, to procure the means of prolonging her invaluable exist∣ence: if you are sincere in your professions of friendship, relieve my dear mother, and oh! I besceeh you, spare the virtue of her wretched daughter."</P>
<P>"Rise, then, my afflicted girl," said he, "you shall be convinced of my sincerity; I will obey the dictates of humanity; we will instantly go to your mother." He then left me for a few moments, when returning, he led me to a coach, and taking my direction, ordered the coachman to drive to our poor habitation. I hesitated at going away in the
<PB N="36" REF="029439_0211_0FE113E36BE4A608"/>
cloaths the old woman had made me put on, but my deliverer told me he had paid for them.</P>
<P>When we arrived at our lodging, a mix∣ed sensation of pain and pleasure dwelt upon my mind, and as I ran up stairs my limbs trembled so, they would scarce support me; Mr. Welldon followed me up: I opened the door of the apartment, and rushing to the bedside, cried "see my dear mother, the friend which heaven hath sent us." My poor mother raised herself feebly in the bed, looked first at me, then at Mr. Welldon, then pointing to my altered dress and crying "these are the wages of infamy, all but this I could have born patiently." She fell back in a fit.</P>
<P>I thought she was gone forever; frantic with despair, I tore off the dress which had so much alarmed her, and throwing myself on the bed beside her, vowed never more to rise, but that my life should expiate my intend∣ed offence. Mr. Welldon had ran away for medical assistance, and entered the room with an apothecary, just as my mother gave some signs of returning life. Proper reme∣dies were immediately applied and Mr. Well∣don soon convinced my reviving parent, that I had not entailed infamy on her latter days, or hastened the period of her existence by guilt or shame.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="029439_0212_0FE113E66277A390"/>
Our generous benefactor, now supplied me with money, not only to procure every necessary, but every comfort of life; and engaged the apothecary to attend my mo∣ther every day: but his care was all in vain; her disorder daily gained ground, and I saw her end rapidly approaching. One day, when Mr. Welldon called to see us, my mother beckoned him to the bedside. "Sir," said she, "if the prayers of a poor dying mortal are heard in heaven, you will un∣doubtedly be rewarded for your benevo∣lence, towards a helpless widow and orphan. To your generosity I owe the honour of my child: oh! may she never again be tempt∣ed to doubt the care of a watchful provi∣dence; and to avoid a temporary evil, rush into lasting misery. To your care Mr. Well∣don I commit her, poor and defenceless as she is; I do not fear your integrity; for the man, who in the gay hour of uncontrouled passion could save an innocent creature from destruction, will never lay a deliberate plan for her seduction. Meriel, you must be humble and industrious, and trust heaven for support." Mr. Welldon promised he would be my guardian and protector from every evil. "I place an implicit confidence in your word," said my mother, "and shall die in peace."</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="029439_0213_0FE113EC7B718F50"/>
"Oh! my dear Meriel," continued she, faintly grasping my hand, "mayst thou be virtuous and happy, and may the Omnipo∣tent preserve thee thro' life."</P>
<P>Celia, I feel I am unable to proceed, the moment that severed me from my dear mo∣ther will be always remembered as the most painful of my life. Adieu till I am more composed.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>December</HI> 25<HI>th,</HI> 1778.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AGAIN sit down to proceed in my me∣lancholy narrative; a month from the time of my dear mother's death must be pass∣ed over in silence; my affliction was poig∣nant, but time and the efforts of reason by degrees softened it. Mr. Welldon suffered that time to elapse before he ventu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to see me; he had placed me with a friend of his, who is a milliner, and tho' he sent every day to enquire after my health, he avoided visiting me, fearing the censure of the world might injure my reputation. My grief being in a great measure abated, Mrs. Lacour took an opportunity of speaking to me concerning my future prospects in life: "Mr. Welldon," said she, "intends, if you approve the plan, that you shall remain with me till you have attained a competent know∣ledge
<PB N="40" REF="029439_0215_0FE113F63B5433B0"/>
of the millinery business, to be able to support yourself without being any longer troublesome to your benefactor. I know, Miss Howard," continued she, "that Mr. Welldon, does not think you an incum∣brance, and that you are in no danger of any improper attempts from him; as I have heard him say the innate goodness of your heart has raised you so in his esteem, that he regards you in the light of a sister; and as such will serve and protect you: but my dear young lady, you are possessed of strong sensibility and to such a heart as your's de∣pendance must be a heavy burthen. As another motive for your endeavouring to render yourself independent, I must inform you that Mr. Welldon will in a few weeks be married, and however innocent your mind, believe me the world will readily cast illiberal censures on a young woman who lived in a state of dependance on a married man; and should it reach his lady's ears might be the source of great uneasiness, if not the cause of an irreparable breach be∣tween them."</P>
<P>I was convinced of the propriety of these arguments, and chearfully acquiesced, while my heart overflowed with gratitude towards my generous benefactor, and I breathed a silent prayer to heaven, that his felicity in
<PB N="41" REF="029439_0216_0FE113FAE1AE15E8"/>
the married state might be equal to his de∣serts.</P>
<P>A few days after this, Mr. Welldon call∣ed. I could not refrain my tears at sight of this worthy man. Past scenes of sorrow rushed upon my mind, which joined to the recollection of my then forlorn, dependant situation almost overcame me. He suffered me to ease my full heart, and then gently enquiring after my health, and how I liked Mrs. Lacour's family, hinted at my remain∣ing with her, till I had attained a competent knowledge of her business.</P>
<P>"I know, my dear Miss Howard," said he, "that your education and accomplish∣ments fit you to be placed in a more elevated sphere. But my good girl must consider that those accomplishments in her present circumstances will be of no use. Nay, if they are suffered to appear will only excite the envy and ill nature of those with whom she is at present obliged to associate. I would by no means have you neglect those brilliant talents, with which nature has endowed you. It is not to be doubted, but you will find lei∣sure hours when the pen or the pencil will be a happy relief to your mind, and prevent your dwelling too intently on past melan∣choly events. But let those hours of relax∣ation
<PB N="42" REF="029439_0217_0FE114004C2511E0"/>
be but few, above all things, be care∣ful not to let your companions discover the superiority you certainly possess over them. Educated, as you have been, perhaps you may think, that with great propriety you might undertake the education of children in some family of distinction, or become com∣panion to some lady. I acknowledge, my fair friend, these are the situations for which you seem most adapted, but here an insur∣mountable obstacle arises; you have no fe∣male friend who can recommend you; and the recommendation of a man, in these cases, in general injures the person they mean to serve. You must, therefore, apply yourself attentively to your new profession, and place a firm reliance on Providence to reward your industry with success."</P>
<P>I had never attempted to interrupt Mr. Welldon, during this friendly harrangue, but finding he now continued silent, I endea∣voured, as well as my tears would permit, to convince him of my gratitude, by promising to do every thing which he had enjoined.</P>
<P>Mrs. Lacour was now desired to come in, when all terms having been previously agreed on, he paid my apprentice fee, and it was determined I should remain with her twelve
<PB N="43" REF="029439_0218_0FE114045E81FB78"/>
months. Mr. Welldon then told me he had provided me an apartment to myself, and begged my acceptance of the furniture it contained. "This day three weeks, Miss Howard," said he, "will make me the hap∣piest of men in a union with a young lady of great merit, on whom I have deservedly placed my affections. We shall set off im∣mediately on a visit to the continent to see some relations, who reside constantly in the south of France, so that it may be a long time before I see you again. In this little pocket-book you will find a trifle to answer your immediate expences, and a direction to a gentleman, in the city, where in case of any future exigencies, you may apply, and he will give you both assistance and advice. God bless you, my dear girl; you have my best wishes, and may rest assured of my un∣alterable friendship." He then saluted me with the affection of a brother, and took his leave.</P>
<P>Soon after he was gone, Mrs. Lacour, by way of diverting my mind from the gloom our parting had cast over it, asked me if I had no curiosity to see the apartment Mr. Welldon had furnished for me. I followed her up two pair of stairs, into a neat back room, where was a tent bed, of striped Man∣chester, with every necessary apurtenance,
<PB N="44" REF="029439_0219_0FE11409865BEE00"/>
a case of drawers, a neat dressing case, and a small trunk, the key of which Mrs. La∣cour gave me, and bidding me with a smile examine my treasures, went down stairs.</P>
<P>On opening the trunk I found it contained a piece of grey lutestring, two pieces of dark chintz, each enough for a gown, about ten yards of muslin, and a piece of fine linen. Removing these, I discovered at the bottom, a neat edition of the English poets, together with a bible and common prayer book; here also, I found a roll of drawing paper, which led me to imagine I was supplied with other materials for this elegant amusement, and on opening the drawers, I found I had not been deceived in my conjectures; for there I found a box of crayons, pencils and colours, and a leather writing case, in which was a letter of truely brotherly advice. On open∣ing a light closet that adjoined my bed cham∣ber, I discovered another mark of the friend∣ly attention of my benefactor; for there was a small piano forte, with a collection of music by the best masters. My little pocket-book contained a bank note for fifty pounds.</P>
<P>Oppressed by a sense of these numerous obligations, my heart almost bursting with grateful emotions, I sunk on my knees by the bed side, and poured forth my thanks
<PB N="45" REF="029439_0220_0FE1140C6DB5DFB0"/>
to the great Disposer of all things, entreat∣ed that the choicest of his blessings might be showered on my benefactor, and prayed his mercy ever to protect and direct me, nor suffer me again, impiously to doubt his power and watchful care.</P>
<P>The next morning, I entered on my new employment with alacrity. It is an employ∣ment that keeps the mind continually amus∣ed. Mrs. Lacour is an amiable, chearful woman, and some of her young people, sen∣sible, well informed girls. I do not like Mr. Lacour: he appears to me a pert, illite∣rate coxcomb. But this does not give me any great uneasiness, as I am not much in his company, except at meal times. When the business of the day is finished, I retire to my own apartment, where writing, reading or music, sweetly relaxes and chears my mind: the time never hangs heavy; I feel a charming serenity pervade my heart, and Hope, that bright celestial guest, again has taken up her residence in my bosom. On a Sundy evening, I never fail visiting the dear spot, that contains all that was earthly of my beloved mother. I cannot describe my sensations when I approach the place. They are far from painful Celia, for the remembrance of her piety and virtue is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alm to my heart; and while my eye i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="46" REF="029439_0221_0FE1141292B33B40"/>
fixed on the grave where she lies, my mental faculties behold her blessed spirit beatifi∣ed, and enjoying the fullness of heavenly bliss in that mansion, where, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, I shall one day again embrace her. When I re∣turn from these contemplations, my soul is so attuned to harmony, that I sing the hymns or anthems suited to the day, with a plea∣sure undescribable. I have wrote a few lines, which you will find fully expressive of the frame of my mind. I cannot help regreting, my dearest friend, the happy days I spent with you in the convent, tho' all-chearing Hope bids me look forward; and while I take my present lot with grati∣tude, humbly aspire to a blessed hereafter. Enclosed are the lines I mention; I sing it to that sweet plaintive air, we were both so fond of. I shall sometimes please myself with the thought, that we may perhaps after you have received this, both sing it at the same moment. God bless you my dear Celia.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>London,</HI> <DATE><HI>January</HI> 10<HI>th,</HI> 1779.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THERE is in this family a Mademoiselle Bagatelle, who is Mrs. Lacour's fore∣woman; I do not like her, Celia, she dresses in the extremity of the fashion, takes snuff▪ rouges high, and is high in the good graces of Monsieur Lacour. I can perceive they perfectly understand each other, tho' the prudent wife either does not, or will not, see the intimacy that subsists between them.</P>
<P>It has often been a subject of wonder to me, how people, whose tempers and disposi∣tions are the very reverse of each other, could voluntarily put on the hymeneal yoke together; and yet we daily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee instances of sense and folly; virtue and vice; under∣standing and ignorance; politeness and vul∣garity; youth and age; beauty and defor∣mity,
<PB N="49" REF="029439_0224_0FE1141F9115DEF0"/>
being linked in the same chain: nay, what is more surprising that both parties eagerly put it on. How are we to account for these inconsistencies in human nature, nothing can be more opposite than the dis∣positions of Monsleur and Mrs. Lacour, and yet I have been told that it was a marriage of inclination and on the lady's side, entirely against the approbation of her friends; hence we must suppose, that either love throws a mist over the discerning optics of its votaries, or that their is a fate in marri∣age, which it is impossible to counteract.</P>
<P>You will, perhaps, wonder, my dear Ce∣lia, that among the many long epistles I have lately wrote to you, the name of Rains∣forth has never escaped me: indeed, I have had afflictions of so much heavier a nature, than merely the loss of a lover, that some months passed in which I hardly remembered there was such a person in being: however in my present situation, being more easy in my mind, thought has frequently recurred to the period when I expected to have been united to him by indissoluble ties. When I think of him, I am feelingly convinced that my heart is still attached; I almost doubt the intelligence of his infidelity, tho' con∣veyed to me by the hand of his father: I feel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> restless curiosity to be informed of his
<PB N="50" REF="029439_0225_0FE114251F452C38"/>
happiness; I fancy, sometimes that he might have heard reports to my disadvantage; he might have been informed of my unfortu∣nate elopement, of my thoughtless corre∣spondence with Pringle: every circumstance may have been exaggerated; and he may not be so culpable as I at first thought him. These ideas often crowd my imagination. But he is married, Celia, and let his virtues be ever so briliant, he can be nothing to me.</P>
<P>I have heard by mere accident that my brother is in a fair way of making his for∣tune in India; I have wrote to him several times, but recieved no answer; not even a line has arrived from him, since the bill, which I mentioned in a former letter, was paid. Mr. Mossop's family are I find removed into the country, and as to any of those who called themselves my friends in the day of prosperity, if I meet them now they stare me confidently in the face, but do not in the least recollect me. Mrs. Lacour, tells me, that when fortune removes friends to any considerable distance from each other, the party who is the favourite of the fickle god∣dess almost immediately becomes near-sight∣ed, and is afflicted with a short memory.</P>

<P>I was yesterday sent to wait on a lady with some caps, &amp;c. in St. James's square. When having waited about half an hour in a cold empty parlour, I thought I heard a voice that was familiar to my ears, but could not recollect whose it was. I was striving to call it to my memory in vain, when the door opened, and who should I behold but Miss Pringle, and another young lady. "Come into this room young woman," said she, "here is a fire, and we will look over your trumpery." I went in my heart sinking as I moved; for I knew enough of this once affectionate friend to suppose she would not readily acknowledge an acquaintance with a milliner's apprentice. I saw, the moment she cast her eyes on me, she recollected me; but as I did not wish to shew an incli∣nation to renew our acquaintance, I cast down my eyes and remained silent, think∣ing that if she did not choose to take notice of me, she might settle it within herself that I did not know her. But the lady's curiosity was more predominent than her pride. She looked at me several times and at length cried "if I did not think it almost impossi∣ble I should say your name was Howard." "My name is Howard, ma'am," said I cold∣ly. "Why, sure as I am alive, it is Meriel
<PB N="52" REF="029439_0227_0FE1142D73272B48"/>
Howard." "The very same, Miss Pringle." "La! my dear girl, why how came you in this situation, such a fortune as you had left you." "We are all subject to vicissitudes of fortune," said I smiling, "but I am ex∣tremely happy in my present situation."</P>
<P>"Happy!" said she, lifting up her eyes in surprize. "I am astonished to hear you say so, for my part I should be the most misera∣ble creature on earth, was I reduced to car∣ry a band-box." "Happiness and misery, Miss," said I, "are in general the result of our own ideas: if I am content in my hum∣ble station, I am in my own mind as happy, nay, perhaps happier than the woman, who riding in a chariot and pair, envies one whose superior fortune can command four or six horses."</P>
<P>She did not seem to comprehend me, but turning to the other lady, said, "well I vow sister it is very astonishing; but this young woman, only four years ago, had a fortune of four thousand pounds, her father liv∣ed in the neighbourhood of our country-house. My brother was very fond of her once, and I believe she did not altogether dislike him, did you Meriel? I fancy your little heart never regained its liberty."</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="029439_0228_0FE11432152C78A0"/>
"I rather suppose, Miss Pringle, that it never was a captive. If at one time I was foolish enough to fancy myself in love with your brother, it was before I had the power of distinguishing a real from an ideal passion, or before I was a competent judge of what would be most conducive to my own happi∣ness."</P>
<P>"Aye," said she, "you can talk of it with a great deal of composure now, but you cer∣tainly was very fond of him once or you would not have resolved to run away with him; nay, can you deny that you were out of your senses about him, when you heard he was married."</P>
<P>This cruel reflection on my unfortunate malady, which was occasioned by the sever∣est affliction that ever child <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, was more than my spirits could support, I turned my face from her to to hide the tear▪ that tric∣kled fast from my eyes; but could not com∣mand my voice to give her an answer, when she continued: "Well, but where are Mr. and Mrs. Howard, and master Richard?" "My brother is in India—I have no parents."</P>
<P>"Poor, dear girl," said the other young lady, now speaking for the first time, "that is a dreadful thing. I know what it is to
<PB N="54" REF="029439_0229_0FE1143763347380"/>
have no parents." She took my hand, and I saw her mild eyes glisten with compassion.</P>
<P>I wished to put an end to this painful conversation, and therefore desired to know if they would keep any of the caps. "Oh, yes, I shall have several, but stop Meriel, I must let my mother know you are here. Dear, how she will be surprized; and you shall go down to Baker, she will pay you, and do have a glass of wine before you go, and a bit of bride cake: you don't know I am married."</P>
<P>"I wish you much happiness madam," said I, coldly; "but I cannot stay to take any refreshment: I have been here much longer than I ought to have staid." You must know, my dear Celia, that my pride was hurt at the idea of standing first to be catechised by the mother, and then be dis∣missed to the house-keeper for wine and cake; and this treatment from a girl, who once called herself my friend, and thought herself honoured by the title. However, I could not escape; the mother was called, and the bell rang for Mrs. Baker. I an∣swered Mrs. Pringle's questions in as short a manner as possible; but obstinately re∣fused going down with the house-keeper. "Ah! poor girl," said Mrs. Pringle, in an
<PB N="55" REF="029439_0230_0FE1143C09143FD0"/>
affected whisper to her daughter; "let the wine be brought up, my dear; you see she cannot as yet submit to the alteration in her situation."</P>
<P>"You are mistaken madam," said I, "I do not feel the least embarassment from the reflection that I owe my support to in∣dustry: it is what many, more worthy than myself are obliged to do, it is by no means hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>liating. True dignity is seated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the soul, nor can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> situation make me forget the respect eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> due to myself. I cannot but reflect ladies, that I am the same Miss Howard, whom some few years ago, you were so extremely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ond of, and eagerly striving which could shew her the most re∣spect. Tho' I am now bereaved of that for∣tune, which I percieve was the magnet which attracted your attentions. I can make proper distinctions; as a trades person, I can easily submit to be turned over to your house-keeper for payment, but remember∣ing I have once been your companion, am still your equal, I cannot submit to be placed on a level with your servants."</P>
<P>They could not answer. Shame and astonishment tied their tongues. I curtsied slightly and followed Mrs. Baker out of the room. While she was paying me, the lo∣quacious
<PB N="56" REF="029439_0231_0FE114417585ACE8"/>
house-keeper informed me that her master had been married about three weeks; that he never saw Miss Pringle till within a month of their union; that he danced with her at a ball, and was struck with her pleas∣ing person, and insinuating manner; "but I can see," continued she, "it will not be a very happy union; and Miss Sally, poor girl, will be more unhappy than ever. It was a sad thing, sir John left her depend∣ant on her brother." "What then," said I, "your master is a baronet?" "No," said she, "his father was a knight, but the title died with him. He was a wealthy citizen, and was knignted for carrying an address to the king on some particular occa∣sion." I had now received my money, and not wishing to pry into the secrets of a fami∣ly, with whom I desired not to form any connection, I wished Mrs. Baker a good morning, and left the house. In the hall I met Miss Sally. "You will have a long walk Miss Howard," said she; "had I any command here, you should not carry that heavy box."</P>
<P>"It is not heavy, Miss," said I.</P>
<P>"But it is cumbersome," she replied, "and you are not accustomed to such employment." She then opened the door
<PB N="57" REF="029439_0232_0FE1144468EBB540"/>
herself, and smiling, with a sweet look of benevolence, wished me a good morning. I pitied the dear girl, for sure I am, if she is dependant on her brother, her new sister will not contribute to make her life very comfortable.</P>
<P>As I walked home, I could not avoid re∣flecting on this rencounter with Miss Prin∣gle; nor did my heart entirely approve my own conduct: there was too much pride in the manner in which I spoke to her: in∣deed, since I have been poor, Celia, I have discovered that I am very proud, much more so than is becoming; I will endeavour to correct this error, and in future adapt my sentiments to the station in which it has pleased Providence to place me.</P>
<P>I have met with many civilities from some of Mrs. Lacour's customers; especially a Mrs. Moreton, who is a woman of very gen∣teel fortune, at least, if I am to conjecture from the manner in which she lives: she is very fond of poetry, and has advised me to endeavour to raise a subscription for the pub∣lication of those poems I formerly mention∣ed to you. Mrs. Lacour does not disap∣prove the plan, and I am by this indulging woman, allowed more time to pursue my favourite study, than I should have met with
<PB N="58" REF="029439_0233_0FE1144E16CAD2D8"/>
in any other place. I have obtained several very respectable names to my subscription; and have some cards of proposals printed which I keep in the shop to present to the ladies who constantly frequent it. I cannot say, Celia, but it would be much more pleas∣ing to me, could I obtain a living by the ex∣ertion of any of my natural talents, than by following the straight forward path of the plodding woman of business; besides I was never designed for a milliner, I cannot flat∣ter, I cannot tell a woman whom age, and other natural defects, have rendered ex∣tremely plain, that a full dress cap with ar∣tificial flowers small handkerchief, and all the gay trappings that belong to the smiling season of eighteen, will become her face and figure: and yet this is a very necessary in∣gredient in the composition of a milliner. I wish to my heart some other plan could be struck out, where I should not be obliged to say and attest things so directly contrary to my own opinion. I am not so happy in this family as I at first thought I should be, Mr. Lacour pays me too much attention lately; I hate the forward concieted fellow, tho' were it only to mortify Mademoiselle I could take a pleasure in listening to his non∣sense; but when I reflect that by so doing I may wound the peace of a deserving woman, who treats me with tenderness, and favours
<PB N="59" REF="029439_0234_0FE1144A464E8C38"/>
me with her esteem, I feel such a mixture of horror end detestation rise in my heart, that I frequently answer his passionate sallies with an acrimony, that makes him bite his lips with vexation. I shall be glad when my time is expired, tho' I have as yet thought of no elligible plan to pursue in future. Adieu, my friend, believe in every change of fortune I am </P>

<P>AGAIN, my beloved Celia, am I cast upon the world without a friend to guide me; scarcely yet have I seen twenty years, and what vicissitudes of fortune have I experienced. In my last I mentioned my design of publishing some poems by subscrip∣tion; but in that design I am disappointed, as well as in every other from which I have ever hoped to extract either pleasure or comfort.</P>
<P>About a month since I recieved the fol∣lowing letter, from the gentleman to whom Mr. Welldon gave me a direction; I trans∣cribe it for your perusal, that you may see how unfortunate I am in having the most innocent actions of my life wrested in such a manner as to be made to appear to my dis∣advantage.</P>

<SALUTE>MISS HOWARD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN your friend, Mr. Welldon, left England he did not propose staying above six weeks or two months at most; but un∣fortunately for him he has been detained on the continent by a continued series of ill health, and he is now at Aix-la-Chappelle in a very dangerous state. When last I saw him he gave me a very particular account of your first acquaintance with him, an account which I must confess raised you both in my opinion, as it proved the goodness of your hearts: he also informed me in what manner he had placed you with Mrs. Lacour, and desired I would frequently call and enquire how you went on, and whether you were satisfied with the treatment you reciev∣ed. Family uneasiness, and various vexa∣tions have prevented my fulfilling my pro∣mise, till last Thursday, when I called at Mrs. Lacour's, and the result of that visit leads me to trouble you with this letter; for as I must naturally feel interested in the welfare of every one dear to Mr. Welldon, I think it my duty to give you a little advice, and to let you know in what light you are consi∣dered
<PB N="62" REF="029439_0237_0FE1145D566C8E08"/>
by the major part of the family where you reside. At the time I made my visit you were out, waiting on some ladies: Mrs. Lacour spoke of you in the tenderest man∣ner, but said you were by no means calcu∣lated for the business Mr. Welldon had placed you in; her sensibility is very great sir, said she, and her notions so very refined and delicate, she is totally unable to bear the rude and often insulting manners of many of our customers: besides, sir, she loves stu∣dy too well ever to make any great profici∣ent at her needle. Mrs. Lacour being cal∣led away, a pert, forward French woman un∣dertook to finish your character: she threw out the most malignant aspersions on your conduct in general, said you had made your∣self the laughing stock of the whole family, that many of the ladies who frequented the shop, distinguished you by the appellation of little scribbler: that you were thoughtless, extravagant, proud, vain, and indolent: and that you had by your artful conduct alienated the affection of monsieur Lacour from his wife, and in all these assertions she wss joined by her companions, who seemed to consider you only as a fit object of ridicule.</P>
<P>Tho' I could not avoid seeing the motive that instigated these women was envy, yet the reviewers call it sad trash, and my lady
<PB N="63" REF="029439_0238_0FE1146206E71AE8"/>
I must think you have not conducted your∣self altogether in the prudent manner I should have expected from the character Mr. Welldon gave of you. Consider Miss How∣ard, industry is the only hope you can have of future support: let me conjure you there∣fore, as a friend, to throw aside the pen, and apply to your needle, and let your in∣ventive fancy be exerted to decorate the persons of your fair country women. Be∣lieve me, the hill of Parnassus is too high for you to climb, unless you had the hand of independance to help you up; the finest turned poem will be entirely overlooked by the world when ushered into it by an ob∣scure author; while a raphsody of nonsense will be universally read and applauded when the author is publicly known to be favoured with the smiles of fortune. We will suppose, my dear, that you had finished a pleasing elegant poem, essay, novel, or what not; and that some bookseller should for a trifling consideration engage to introduce it to pub∣lic notice; a new publication no sooner makes it appearance than the people of fashion enquire, who the author is. "Have you read the new poem my lady?" says sir Timothy Trifle. "No not I, is it good for any thing?" "'Pon honour I don't know, Pedegree told me it was wrote by a little milliner, who lived at Lacour's,"</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="029439_0239_0FE1146759495F98"/>
"Prithee, dear sir Timothy, no more, I am quite sick already; what can a milliner's girl know of litirature?" Thus my dear, you will find people of fashion will not give your book a perusal: and tho' there are some few who may read it with pleasure, and give it the encomiums its merit deserves, they will be ashamed to avow an opinion contrary to that of their superiors; while the generality of the world satisfied with the sentence already passed, will not be at the trouble of reading and judging for them∣selves: the consequence will be you will not sell enough to pay the expence of printing and paper, and you will have the mortifica∣tion to see your poems used as waste pa∣per, to wrap up parcels, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I flatter myself, your natural good sense will lead you to consider this letter in the friendly light it was intended, that you will do your utmost to eradicate from the minds of your companions every idea they may have formed to your disadvantage, that you will drop all thought of shining in the literary world, and apply yourself chearfully to that employment by which you may hope to pass through life with comfort and respectability.</P>

<P><PB N="65" REF="029439_0240_0FE1146A1F974F90"/>
The reception of this letter made me very uneasy, especially the part which mentioned the illness of my kind hearted benefactor: I was grieved also to find what a bubble I had been to Mademoiselle and all the ap∣prentices, as they had all pretended to be greatly pleased with my writings, and had often said it was a thousand pities, so bright a genius shonld be buried in oblivion: how∣ever it opened my eyes to their deceit and flattery; and I determined to be more up∣on my guard in future. I felt extremely grateful to Mr. Friendly for the trouble he had taken in writing to me, answered his letter immediately, promised to profit by his advice, and reqnested to be again favoured with a few lines whenever he should hear from Mr. Welldon.</P>
<P>From this time I applied myself with great assiduity to my employment; tho' I could not help noticing a visible alteration in Mrs. Lacour's behaviour: she because cold and distant, frequently spoke to me in a tone of displeasure, and seemed carefully to avoid my conversation, except what was absolutely necessary in the business. The apprentices treated me with disrespect, and Mademoiselle aimed at me the most pointed sarcasms. Things were in this situation, when one day as I was sitting pensive in a
<PB N="66" REF="029439_0241_0FE114700035BDD0"/>
little back parlour, where we usually break∣fasted, I was surprised by the sudden en∣trance of Monsieur Lacour, who began in the usual strain to profess his admiration, and audaciously solicited return of his illicit passion.</P>
<P>"Your insolence sir," said I, "is insuf∣ferable, I can no longer submit to it, and if ever again you shock my ears with such infa∣mous solicitations I will inform your much injured wife of your intimacy with Made∣moiselle." I then would have left the room but he threw himself between me and the door, and seizing my hand, impudently swore, my threat proceeded only from jea∣lousy. "But come my sweet creature," said he "do not let that make you uneasy, I will promise never to speak to Bagatelle again." He then fell on his knees with a look of lu∣dicrous grimace, which at another time would only have made me laugh: but at that time I felt far different sensations. Unable to free myself from his grasp, and hurt at the mean opinion he entertained of me, all my forti∣tude forsook me, and I burst into tears. At that moment the door opened, and in rush∣ed Mrs. Lacour, Mademoiselle and Mr. Friendly.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="029439_0242_0FE11472B88DD438"/>
"Oh Meriel!" cried Mrs. Lacour; "I could not have believed"—She would have fallen to the ground, had I not sprang for∣ward to catch her as she fainted.</P>
<P>"You see sir," said Mademoiselle to Mr. Friendly, as we were supporting Mrs. La∣cour to a chair. "You see sir, I told you only the truth." Monsieur, in the general confusion walked unobserved away. My distress was very great to see Mrs. Lacour in this situation. I feared it might be of dangerous consequence, as she was far ad∣vanced in her pregnancy. I supported her in my arms, chafed her temples with Hun∣gary water, and on the first return of life, begged her not to think me so guilty as I appeared. She shook her head, pushed me from her, and leaning on Mademoiselle's arm, went out of the room.</P>
<P>I then addressed Mr. Friendly as a strang∣er; for I did not at that time personally know him; and entreated he would endea∣vour to heal this breach between Mrs. La∣cour and myself: "indeed sir," said I, "she is the only friend I have; I would sooner die than injure her." I then related briefly every thing that had past, and fully explain∣ed the cause of the tears he saw me shed.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="029439_0243_0FE114788F979F78"/>
"Appearances are undoubtedly against you Miss Howard," said he, "but I am wil∣ling to believe you innocent. I am extreme∣ly sorry there is any dissention between you and Mrs. Lacour, she being as you have just remarked, your only friend. I yester∣day received a letter from Mrs. Welldon, informing me that her husband died about a fortnight since. She mentions you as a person of whom Mr. Welldon spoke in his last moments, and desires me to give you fifty pounds, to buy mourning; at the same time she bids me inform you it is the last you will recieve from her."</P>
<P>I was so overcome, indeed I may say stu∣pified with grief, I was totally unable to an∣swer. He saw and I believe pitied my distress▪ and thus continued. "I have added to this little present fifty pounds more; and would advise you to leave this family immediately, and in some genteel neigbourhood open a lit∣tle shop, endeavour to gain employment; be prudent and industrious, and I have no doubt of your success; but prithee, good my girl, burn your pens and paper, and believe me, a woman makes as awkward a figure engaged in literary pursuits, as a counsellor would do seated at a tambour frame or busied in assort∣ing colours for embroidery." I promised to
<PB N="69" REF="029439_0244_0FE1147BA5FDC0F8"/>
remember his friendly advice, he paid me the money and took his leave.</P>
<P>I was now anxious to see Mrs. Lacour but all attempts to that purpose were fruitless. I wrote a letter protesting my innocence and received a verbal answer by one of the apren∣tices that the thing was too plain to admit of any doubt, that she wished me well but had no desire ever to see me again. I retired to my apartment with a heart overcharged with sorrow. At any other time, the death of my benevolent friend Mr. Welldon would have been in itself a sufficient affliction: but now I had the additional one of knowing I had tho, unintionally, injured the health of a woman, I sincerely esteemed, incurred the censures of the world, and cast an indeliable blemish on my reputation, which it had ever been my study to preserve unsullied. In these melancholy reflections I past the day; in the evening the servant brought me up a candle and some supper: but I was too much agi∣tated to eat, and went early to bed, tho' I was fully convinced that to sleep would be impossible.</P>
<P>About twelve o'clock I heard a great bus∣tle below, and fearing for Mrs. Lacour I jumped out of bed and opening my chamber door to listen, plainly heard one of the young
<PB N="70" REF="029439_0245_0FE11481749691F8"/>
women say, "she cannot live, the doctor says it is impossible." Terrified beyond mea∣sure I put on a few cloaths and ran hastily down stairs, determined at all events to see this dear sufferer, and by convincing her of my innocence restore her mind to peace. The danger she was in had thrown the family into such confusion, that I found no opposi∣tion made to my entering the appartment. The curtains were close drawn round the bed, and there was little light in the room, so that she did not perceive me when I en∣tered, I found the agitation of her mind had thrown her into a premature labour, and that the surgeon imagined her life to be in iminent danger. Every other thought was now absorbed in my anxiety for her. I beck∣oned her sister who was setting by the bed∣side. She came to me, I told her the distress of my mind and begged her to believe me not guilty. "Dear Meriel," said she, "I never thought you so, nor would my poor sister have ever entertained an idea to your prejudice, had it not been for the insinua∣tions of Bagatelle, who has now plainly dis∣covered the motive which led her so malici∣ously to asperse your character: however no one can now have a doubt of your inno∣cence. Mademoiselle went out about eight this evening, which greatly surprised us, as my sister was so ill. As the evening ad∣vanced,
<PB N="71" REF="029439_0246_0FE114845A7D7E80"/>
her abscence became more astonish∣ing, and about an hour since a person called who had seen Bagatelle and the ungrateful Lacour get into a chaise at an inn door and drive off for Dover."</P>
<P>Tho' my heart bled for Mrs. Lacour, I could not but rejoice that this proceeding of theirs was a convicing proof of my inno∣cence. I inquired, if this unfortunate wo∣man had been informed of their perfidy, and being answered in the affirmative, and told that the intelligence had precipitated her illness, I asked, if I might be permited to speak to her. When she was informed that I was in the room, she called me to her with a faint voice, and taking hold of my hand, said, "Meriel, forgive me, I have injured you; but I was myself decieved." She could not say more, her pains became excruciating, and after continuing many hours in a state of exquisite torture, she re∣signed her breath, having given birth to a female infant who survived her mother but a few moments.</P>
<P>Lacour's flight, and his wife's death was soon spread abroad; and it was discovered that he had not only collected all the debts, previous to his departure, but had also strip∣ped the house of every thing valuable, so
<PB N="72" REF="029439_0247_0FE1148A105A0130"/>
that when the creditors brought in their ac∣counts, there was not sufficient property to pay five shillings in the pound. Every thing was immediately seized, and the hap∣less Mrs. Lacour would have been obliged to the parish for a decent funeral, had not her sister, tho' but in indifferent circumstan∣ces and myself borne the expence between us. When I had paid every necessary re∣spect to the memory of this unfortunate wo∣man, I began to think of my own affairs. You may remember my mentioning a Mrs. Moreton, from whom I had recieved many civilities. She lived at a small village a few miles out of town. To her I applied for ad∣vice, in my present embarrassing situation. She received me with politeness, told me she would exert herself to the utmost to serve me and faid she thought I might make my business answer very well in Kensington, where she had many friends to whom she could recommend me. To a heart formed for all the endearing and social ties of life, how every little kindness is received with grati∣tude, and how does it feel the attentions even of common civility. I feel myself grow∣ing attached to this Mrs. Moreton, her man∣ner is the most preposessing, her form elle∣gant and and she posesses the polite accom∣plishments in an imminent degree. She is the wife of an officer now in India, by whom
<PB N="73" REF="029439_0248_0FE1148F0534AFF8"/>
she has two lovely children, her mansion is a little terrestial paradise. Every thing about it is neat, compact, and charming.</P>
<P>I have not as yet met with an apartment to suit me, tho' I have seen several, however it is determined I shall not have a shop but carry on my business as a chamber milliner.</P>
<P>My heart almost sinks at the idea of a young, unprotected creature like myself, venturing upon such a plan, but what can I do, convinced as I am of the impossibilty of ever doing any thing in the literary way, I shall never more renew my attempts.</P>
<P>I must remember the last words of my dear mother, "be humble, patient and in∣dustrious, and rely on heaven for support." Let me have your prayers, my beloved Celia. But I need not ask them, I am sure my sweet benevolent friend looks round the whole universe with an eye of heavenly complacen∣cy, and wishes every bosom as tranquil as her own; and that your happiness may ne∣ver be diminished, is the fervant prayer of</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Kensington,</HI> <DATE><HI>August</HI> 23<HI>d,</HI> 1780.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now settled in a very neat apart∣ment, within about a half a mile of Mrs. Moreton's house; the people with whom I lodge appear obliging and friendly, and from the specimen I have already had, I think I shall obtain a very genteel living, as I have much more work than I can perform myself, and am obliged to employ several young women. My Sundays I always spend with Mrs. Moreton, accompanying her to church in the morning, she dines so late, it is impossible to go in the afternoon. She has introduced me to the family of a Mr. Belger, a man of great genius, and independent fortune: Mrs. Belger is the most exquisitely beautiful woman I ever beheld; but she has no accomplishments, nor can I think she has been even decently educated; indeed, I
<PB N="75" REF="029439_0250_0FE11497B48A0708"/>
have heard it whispered that she is not his wife; however, she goes by his name, does the honours of his table, and has by him a sweet little girl, the very image of her beau∣tiful mother: this child has more firmly knit the bonds that holds her faithful to its father; but tho' every look, word and action, speaks the ardency and purity of her attachment: he treats her with a co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> respect, which I am sure must cut her to the soul: he is civil, polite, but distant. In this fami∣ly I spend many agreeable hours; I think Mr. Belger the most sensible man I ever conversed with, indeed, the more I converse with him the more I am convinced of my own ignorance; he kindly endeavours to instruct me, directs my taste in the choice of authors, corrects my judgment, and takes great pleasure in improving me in both mu∣sic and drawing. To confess the truth, I have but little time to spare for these per∣suits; but I sometimes steal a few hours from rest to perform my necessary employ∣ments, that I may the next day have a little time to attend to Mr. Belger's instructions. We cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> agree about religious mat∣ters, but I dispute with him, nor have I any doubt of making a convert of him; for at present, my dear Celia, this agreeable man either is or pretends to be an infidel; I ra∣ther think it is the latter, for he said the
<PB N="76" REF="029439_0251_0FE1149D2CE13E18"/>
other evening he loved to hear my senti∣ments delivered with such charming enthu∣siasm, tho' they were in direct opposition to his own. I have had some doubt about the propriety of continuing my intimacy in this family, as Mrs. Belger is supposed to be on∣ly his mistress; but her whole conduct is such as may call a blush upon the cheek of many an insolent woman, who looking with merciless disdain on her poor fallen sisters, smiles contemptously and thanks hea∣ven she is virtuous. Mrs. Belger is a ten∣der, exemplary mother, a kind mistress to her servants, a good christian, and a meek, obedient, faithful, I had almost said wife; but the mystic words have not passed that can render her character respectable in every eye: you will therefore say, my dear Celia, she is an improper companion for a girl whose reputation has once been doubted, and can∣not be regained by associating with a woman, whose character is suspicious: True, my dear girl, but I feel myself so attached to the family so grateful for the attentions shewn me, and am so conscious of my own solitary friendless situation, that my heart deprived of every affection, every fond hope on which it once rested, naturally clings to those whose kind∣ness sooths its anxieties to rest.</P>

<P>I have been so frightened, my dear Celia, that I believe it will be sometime before I re∣cover myself; and I cannot but consider it a great mercy that I am alive and able to re∣late the cause of my terror. In the apart∣ment adjoining the room where I sleep, the maid of the house sleeps with two of the younger children, for they have a large fa∣mily. About four o'clock this morning, I was awoke by a sense of suffocation, and starting up, perceived my chamber to be full of smoak, I jumped out of bed and looking round to see that there was no appearance of fire in the room, ventured to open one of the windows a little way to disperse it. I then opened the door, which led to the chil∣drens room, here the smoak was more thick, and I found the smell of fire grow stronger; but what were my sensations, on going into their apartment to see a basket of cloaths which stood on a chair by the bedside all on fire, and the curtains of the bed which were fortunately of woolen just beginning to burn. I had not an instant for consideration, Provi∣dence directed me; for I am conscious that reason was for a few moments intirely sus∣pended, I ran back to my own bed; drag∣ged of a blanket and immediately threw it over the burning basket, at the same time
<PB N="78" REF="029439_0253_0FE114A6ACB16FD0"/>
pouring on it a large pan of water, which stood in the room, and had been placed there for the purpose of washing the chil∣dren. I then awoke the servant, and took the dear little innocents out of the bed; they had been so nearly suffocated it was with difficulty I awoke them, and when brought into the air blood gushed from their noses: when I had a little recovered them and laid them in my bed, I returned to the other chamber, sent the maid down for more water, and having entirely extinguished every appearance of fire, began to have the use of reflection: my own almost miracu∣lous escape from so horrible a death, the safety of the children, nay, the preservation of the lives and property of the whole fami∣ly, impressed my mind with such awful gra∣titude towards the Power, who had in such unexpected danger inspired and directed me, that I threw myself on my knees and burst into tears of unfeigned thankfulness. Had I not discovered it at the time I did, we must all have inevitably perished; for the rest of the family lay in apartments built distinctly from this part of the house: the apart∣ments I occupied were over the shop, and this room really belonged to me, but as I had no use for it I gave it up to the servant and children. The master, mistress, three more children and two apprentices, slept on
<PB N="79" REF="029439_0254_0FE114A9FAFD3A10"/>
the ground floor behind the shop, so that the whole front of the house might have been in flames, before they would have dis∣covered it. I asked the girl how she ima∣gined the accident had happened; she said she often was obliged to sit up very late for her master, that she had been up that night, till near two o'clock, and being obliged to work very hard in the day time, she was very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leepy and weary; that she imagines she must have left the candle burning on the floor, and that it had caught some of the linen that hung from the basket. You may easily suppose I was not inclined to go to bed again, I therefore dressed myself, and waited the rising of the family. When I heard Mrs. Newtram up, I took the two young children in my hand and went down. "You are up early, Miss Howard," said she, "I hope the children have not been making a noise to disturb you." "I was up much earlier than you can imagine," I re∣plied, "but believe me these little dears have been very quiet and good, but I was sadly alarmed this morning at four o'clock."</P>
<P>"Alarmed, my dear ma'am, at what?" "At an accident which had like to prove fatal to us all." "Good God!" said she, "what can have been the matter?" "Come, come, my good Mrs. Newtram," said I, seeing her turn pale, "there is no occasion for terror
<PB N="80" REF="029439_0255_0FE114AFDB4BBF48"/>
now, the danger is past, you see your chil∣dren are safe, but we have been all on fire up stairs to night." "Merciful heaven!" said she, "that careless Betty." "Do not blame the girl Mrs. Newtram, fatigued as she is in the day time, she cannot be suppos∣ed capable of sitting up till two or three o'clock in the morning, especially when we recollect she in general rises at six, to per∣form her daily avocations; and I will just beg leave to mention that it is my earnest wish she may be forgiven: she has suffered enough already from her fright, do not, therefore, reproach her, and I will be an∣swerable such an accident never happens again in any place where she is." I then took Mrs. Newtram up stairs, and shewed her the things that had been on fire. When she saw the imminent danger to which her children had been exposed, she caught them in her arms and with all the enthusiasm of maternal affection, blest heaven for their preservation. "Oh! Miss Howard," said she, "how can we ever be grateful enough for your quick recollection in such an alarm∣ing situation; we are bound to consider you as our guardian angel."</P>
<P>I stopped the good woman in the midst of her acknowledgments, to renew my entre∣ties for Betty's pardon, and that she might
<PB N="81" REF="029439_0256_0FE114B4210ED078"/>
be continued in her place. "I can deny you nothing," said she; "but I am afraid Mr. Newtram will be inveterate against her." "That will be cruel indeed," said I, "for he was himself undoubtedly the prior cause of the accident, by keeping such very late hours." She then went down stairs, and I went to breakfast; which before I had half finished was interrupted by the entrance of Mr. Newtram. He repeated every acknow∣ledgment before made by his wife, sealed Betty's pardon, and declared he wished for nothing more, than for some opportunity to convince me of his gratitude, and that he would almost lay down his life to serve me. Thus you see, my dear Celia, this accident will in the end terminate for my good, as it seems to have secured the af∣fection and friendship of those, in whose house I reside; and in case of future trouble I make no doubt, but I shall find in these worthy people, a kindness nearly maternal. Farewell my friend; your's ever.</P>

<P>MR. BELGER has frequently private concerts at his house. I always am one of the party. Sometimes I perform on the piano forte; sometimes sing, and al∣ways meet with such applause, as almost makes me vain; indeed the praises of Mr. Belger only, are sufficient for that pur∣pose. He is the only man I could ever think perfectly agreeable, since the conduct of Rainsforth gave me so very despicable an opinion of the whole sex. But of one thing I am convinced; it is dangerous to enter into arguments with persons who have an improper opinion of religious mat∣ters. I have had frequent conversations with Mr. Belger on this topic, and instead of being able to convince him of his errors. (You will tremble whem I tell you) I have only imbibed his principles, and find doubt arising in my mind concerning the most sa∣cred
<PB N="83" REF="029439_0258_0FE114BBD2D4A208"/>
parts of the holy writings. Oh! my dear Celia, pray for your weak friend, that she may not be lost by listening to this in∣sinuating man. I have indeed made fre∣quent resolutions to avoid his company, and as frequently broke them. I take my heart severely to task. Surely Celia, after it has suffered so much from the perfidy of the sex, it cannot be so weak, nay so wicked, as to feel an attachment for a man who is ano∣ther's right. Do not fear for me, my belov∣ed friend; if I cannot command my feelings I can my actions. Should I at some future period discover that Rainsforth is not the capricious character, he at present appears, I will never have the mortification to re∣flect, I have rendered myself unworthy of his esteem: if otherwise, it shall never be in the power of any man to boast, that he has triumphed over the virtue of Meriel Howard. No Celia, I may be unfortunate, but I never will be guilty.</P>
<P>Business does not answer so well as I ex∣pected. Many, I believe, employed me at first from motives of curiosity, and that being gratified, they return to those they formerly dealt with; and I have now scarce∣ly enough to employ myself, and one young woman, whom Mrs. Moreton has recom∣mended to me. However, I keep up my

<P>WHAT a world this is, my friend, and of what a medly of strange in∣consistent characters is it composed. Were it not impious, I could wish I had never en∣tered it. Some few years since, I believed every heart glowed with humanity, friendship and sincerity toward each other. Yes, Ce∣lia, at the time I left the convent these were
<PB N="85" REF="029439_0260_0FE114C63AA45C10"/>
my ideas of the world. Nay it is but very lately I began to perceive how erroneous my opinion was; but believe me, the more we know of mankind the less we find to admire or esteem. The heart grows hardened by repeated disappointments, and from having an unbounded confidence in our fellow-crea∣tures, we begin to suspect every one of hy∣pocrisy.</P>
<P>My dear friend, I am still the sport of ca∣pricious fortune. Deceived, betrayed by those I most loved and trusted, I have no comfort left but my dependance on heaven, (which thank God, I have regained) and the conscious integrity of my own heart.</P>
<P>Some little time after my last letter, Mrs. Moreton called on me one morning, in her way to town, and asked if I would take a ride with her. She was in Mr. Belger's carriage. I had nothing to prevent me and immedi∣ately complied. We proceeded to town, and stopped at a silk mercer's. Mrs. More∣ton ordered some silks to be put up, but when she <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame to pay for them, discovered she had left her purse behind her. I had money suf∣ficient about me, and therefore offered to pay the amount of the bill. "Do so, my dear," said she, "it will be all the same. I can pay you again when we get home." It came to
<PB N="86" REF="029439_0261_0FE114CB732FAEF8"/>
upwards of ten pounds, as she purchased a piece of silk for a lady whom she expected out of the country. When we returned the ex∣pected lady was arrived. She approved the silk, and after dinner took a walk to my apart∣ments, where she ordered some very elegant linen to be made: the lace she chose it to be trimed with, was two guineas per yard. You can get this done by Saturday afternoon, said Mrs. Moreton, for we are obliged to pay a visit to very particular people, and this lady would wish to have it to wear. As soon as they were gone, I wrote to a laceman in town, to send me more of the lace; for the handker∣chief, apron, and ruffles were all to be full trimed. As I had dealt with him before, he did not hesitate. The muslin I had by me; and on Saturday afternoon, according to their desire, I took the whole suit home, which, when finished, came to near fifty pounds. They were much pleased with it, and desired I would bring my bill on Monday morning, about twelve o'clock. I had a small gold watch by my side, which was given me by Mr. Welldon. It was of no great value, but for the sake of the doner, it was highly prized by me. "Meriel, my love," said Mrs. Moreton, "I have sent my watch to be cleaned; I shall be at a loss to know how time goes: do lend me your's for this even∣ing."</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="029439_0262_0FE114CFB7522F88"/>
"I set great store by it, madam," said I, "it was the gift of a deceased friend; but I think you will be careful of it." "As I would of my own," she replied, as she took it. "Stay, madam," said I, "there is a little trinket to it which I have vowed never to part with." (It was a small locket which con∣tained a lock of my dear mother's hair). She suffered me to take it off, and Mr. Bel∣ger's coach coming to the door to attend the ladies, they set me down at my own lodging, and proceeded to town.</P>
<P>The next day, being Sunday, I dined at Mr. Belger's, where I was surprised to hear that the ladies had sent home the carriage, without returning themselves, and that Mrs. Moreton's children were in town with her. However I felt no uneasiness or suspicion, and on Monday morning repaired to Mrs. Moreton's with my bill: but to my utter astonishment found the house entirely shut up, and was informed by a neighbour, that it was a ready furnished house, which she had occupied near a twelve-month, and that she had discharged her servant on Saturday morning; that they had every reason to sup∣pose she did not intend to come back again, for she had not paid the house rent, and was besides in debt to every body in the neigh∣bourhood, who would trust her; and that
<PB N="88" REF="029439_0263_0FE114D4DA8A72E8"/>
on going into the house, which the landlord had done early this morning, they found nothing in it that had ever belonged to her; but missed a considerable quantity of linen, which had been lent her when she took the house.</P>
<P>I was now fatally convinced that my con∣fidence in Mrs. Moreton had been ill pla∣ced; the linen I had made, the money I had lent, had, altogether, greatly contributed to reduce my finances, and I began to see the difficulties, in which this ungenerous con∣duct would involve me. At first, it struck me, that Mr. Belger had been accessary to her departure; but in this I was deceived, for on calling there, I found they were as greatly surprized as I had been, and that her specious appearance had so far imposed on him, that he had lent her twenty guineas only a few days before. Overwhelm'd with this new affliction, I returned to my lodg∣ing; but judge if you possibly can, of my increased anguish, when, on entering my bed-chamber, I saw my bureau had been forced open, all my cash gone, and with it a quantity of edging to a large amount. Almost ready to sink with the terror that seized my mind, I rang the bell violently, and nobody immediately answering, I ran down to Mrs. Newtram's apartments and
<PB N="89" REF="029439_0264_0FE114D92E662898"/>
enquired after Kitty. "Bless me, Miss How∣ard," said Mrs. Newtram, "did you not discharge her before you went out this morning." "No, indeed I had not the most distant thought of such a thing."</P>
<P>"Well, that's strange now; for you had not been out above five minutes, before she came down crying, and begged one of the apprentices to go for a coach, said you had discharged her at a moment's warning, but she would go directly home to her mother. When the coach came, we helped her in with her boxes, and she drove away, order∣ing the man to stop at the White Horse Cellar, Piccadilly."</P>
<P>"I'm undone," said I, "what will be∣come of me;" and sunk almost fainting, into a chair. Mrs. Newtram got me some hartshorn and water, after which I began to shed tears, which in some measure reliev∣ed me. "Dear Miss," cried Mrs. New∣tram, "what can have happened: have you lost any of your friends?" "Oh!" said I, "I have no friends; I am the most unfortunate creature breathing, nor do I know how to extricate myself from the difficulties that surround me."</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="029439_0265_0FE114DE68D02A78"/>
I then gave her an account of Mrs. More∣ton's departure, of the money, &amp;c. I had trusted her with, and concluded with the discovery I had just made of Kitty's dis∣honesty.</P>
<P>"Why to be sure Miss Howard," said she, "it is a sad loss; but you should have been upon your guard against Mrs. More∣ton; you certainly knew she was a woman of dubious character; and to tell you the truth, Mr. Newtram and I have often said it was a great pity, so sweet a young lady should be so intimate, with a woman of that kind: then there is Mrs. Belger, why all the world knows she is no better than she should be; and you can't think what ill natured things have been said in the neigh∣bourhood, about your being so much with them."</P>
<P>"As to Mrs. Moreton," said I, "be∣lieve me, I had not the least idea, but that she was a woman of respectable character; and tho' I have heard some things, not quite so much to Mrs. Belger's advantage, I never saw a woman in my life whose whole con∣duct demanded more respect and esteem." "Upon my word Miss," said she, "I am surprized to hear you talk so, when you know (drawing up her head) Mr. Belger

is not her husband; but that I have a very good opinion of you, I should think you was as bad as she."</P>
<P>"I think, Mrs. Newtram," said I, "as you seem to know Mrs. Moreton's character so well it would have been but friendly to have given me a little warning."</P>
<P>"Why, la! Miss, you know it was no business of mine, and you told me yourself you knew her before you came to settle here: but, how do you mean to do? I sup∣pose you have some friends to whom you can apply; if you have any letter, or any thing to send to town one of our young men shall take it."</P>
<P>"I tell you again Mrs. Newtram, I have not a friend in the world; I am a poor soli∣tary being, unconnected with the world, or any one in it; and were I this moment to leave it, not one tear of affection or regret would be shed upon my grave."</P>
<P>"Dear now that's very odd, most peo∣ple have some friend or other, but I suppose you have offended all your's." "They are dead," said I, "and unless you favour me with your advice and assistance, I know not to whom else to apply." "To be sure, I'll
<PB N="92" REF="029439_0267_0FE114E6B6C22C58"/>
give you the best advice in my power, but had you not better apply to Mr. Belger?"</P>
<P>"Oh no, I would wish to hide my dis∣tress from him in particular." "You are in debt? I suppose," asked Mrs. Newtram, in a quick accent.</P>
<P>"Yes, I owe above forty guineas." "Well, and there is a quarter's rent of the lodging due, that's eight more, then there's the laundress and the baker." "True," said I, in an humble tone, "but I suppose my furniture will sell for as much as will pay them." "And is that all your depen∣dance? then I shall take care that we loose nothing: here, Newtram," continued she, opening a door that looked into the shop, "here, step here:" when he came in, she told him my situation and concluded, "then you know, as that is the case, we had better take care of ourselves, and be the first to take the furniture."</P>
<P>"That's true dame," said he, "so d'ye see, Miss, we'll send for a man to 'praise the goods to-morrow."</P>
<P>Astonishment almost suspended my facul∣ties: "just heaven!" said I, "is this friendship?"</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="029439_0268_0FE114E9AABB06A0"/>
"Friendship," said she, tartly, "I have a large family Miss, and all my friendship must be exerted for my children: if I was inclined to give you the eight guineas you owe me I cannot do it in justice to these little innocents."</P>
<P>Celia, she pointed to the two children I had saved from the fire: I fixed my eyes on the unoffending infants, a fresh flood of tears burst from them, I folded my hands upon my bosom and remained silent.</P>
<P>It was now one o'clock and the servant brought in their dinner; they sat down to table, but did not ask me to partake, I should not have noticed the impropriety of my re∣maining in their apartment, had I not been roused from my stupefaction by the young∣est girl, who getting from her seat brought her plate of victuals and laid it in my lap, and taking up a bit put it towards my mouth crying, "there Missy eat some dinnee." I kissed the dear child, and apologizing for my intrusion went up to my apartment; where I vented my full heart, in an unre∣strained flood of tears.</P>
<P>Toward evening Betty came into my room; she said her mistress was gone out, and she had stolen up unknown to her master
<PB N="94" REF="029439_0269_0FE1157066D8D6E8"/>
to see if she could do any thing for me. "You have had no dinner," said the kind girl, "pray let me get you some tea." She then made up the sire, and presently provided this repast, which however dis∣inclined, I forced myself to take, to ease poor Betty's anxiety. When she had re∣moved the tea things and lighted a candle, she went down stairs again, and I sat pensive and solitary, retracing the past events of my life. Alas! said I, how very hard is my fate. Possessed as I am of a heart moulded to com∣passion, glowing with universal affection to∣wards my fellow creatures, I am constantly thrown among people, whose every feel∣ing is a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>bed in self. Yet sure huma∣nity is the child of nature; it is a heavenly spark of intellectual fire, implanted in our souls by the hand divine. Every heart is endowed with it more or less; but an inter∣course with the world contributes to blunt those keen sensations, till by degrees they are entirely deadened, and we can look on a scene of misery without the least emotion, if it interferes not with our own interest or hap∣piness. Yet I cannot think that I shall ever arrive at that happy state of torpidity, for sure, while I can feel my own sorrows, I shall never be insensible to the woes of others; for never yet did I see a person in affliction, but I made their case my own, and my heart would in∣stantly
<PB N="95" REF="029439_0270_0FE114EF52A57BB8"/>
overflow with pity. But alas! no heart melts with pity for me. Even Mrs. Newtram seems to have forgot that she has daughters, or she would surely compassionate my sufferings, by reflecting that those darl∣ings of her heart may perhaps one day be in the same situation. I was still pursuing this melancholy train of thought, when I was startled by a gentle tap at the door. I arose and opened it, but was surprised to see Mr. Bel∣ger enter the room. "Dear Miss Howard," said he, "forgive this liberty. I have been informed of your distress by your officious landlady, whom I have left chattering to to Mrs. Belger, while I slipped away to offer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny assistance in my power to my charming little friend." I bowed my head, but could not answer. I motioned towards a chair. He seated himself and continued: "My dear Meriel, I have long feared what is now re∣alized; I knew from the first moment I saw you, that you were never designed for the station, in which you have lately moved. The elegance of your manner, the delicacy of your sentiments convince me you are far su∣perior to those women with whom it has been your misfortune to be obliged to associate." "Indeed, Mr. Belger," said I, "I am con∣scious of that superioty in nothing but mise∣ry. I look round me with a desponding eye,
<PB N="96" REF="029439_0271_0FE114F3FA16A6B8"/>
and think the world does not contain so friendless, so wretched a creature as myself."</P>
<P>"From my soul do I pity you," said he, taking my hand, "and wish it was in my power effectually to serve you without offer∣ing any thing that might alarm your sensibi∣lity; but that is impossible. I know of but one method, by which you can be extricated from your present difficulties." "Alas, sir," I replied, "I have not the least hope of be∣ing extricated. All my furniture will be seized to-morrow, and I shall be turned from this habitation without knowing how to pro∣vide another."</P>
<P>"Not so, beloved girl," said he. "You cannot think I will suffer it. Long have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> adored your merits. You must have seen my ardent affection, which has so often burst thro' the thin veil, prudence obliged me to throw over it; and if vanity has not misled me, I flatter myself I am not altogether indifferent to you; if so, my dear creature, what remains, but that we this night bid adieu to all these vexations? Let us defy the malignant censures of the world, and happy in each other's affections, rise superior to the narrow bounds imposed by priest-craft and superstition; dare to think and act for ourselves, and seek that
<PB N="97" REF="029439_0272_0FE114FA02FD6D38"/>
felicity on the continent, which a concur∣rence of untoward circumstances prevents our enjoying in England."</P>
<P>Amazement had taken entire possession of me during this speech; I was almost de∣deprived of the power of utterance. At length I exclaimed "good God! how have I deserved this insult? Ungenerous man, have you forgot Mrs. Belger."</P>
<P>"Dear Meriel," said he, "do not raise imaginary obstacles. You as well as all the rest of the world know I am not married to that woman."</P>
<P>"But you are bound to her, sir, by every tie of honour and gratitude."</P>
<P>"Miss Howard," said he, gravely, "can you lay your hand upon your heart, and say you do not regard me with a sentiment more lively than friendship."</P>
<P>"If I know that heart, Mr. Belger, it will never love whom it cannot esteem. And whatever may be its feeling I have learnt to conquer." I could not finish what I intended to say, my tears flowed so fast they almost choaked me.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="029439_0273_0FE114FD80D0D8D8"/>
"Dearest, gentlest girl," said he, "I see the tenderness you vainly strive to hide, then come let us fly to France and insure at once both your own happiness and mine."</P>
<P>"What will become of your Emma," said I, "Can you resolve to forsake your child?"</P>
<P>"Thank you, my sweet girl, for the re∣membrance, she shall be the companion of our flight."</P>
<P>"And so drive her poor mother to dis∣traction. No, Mr. Belger, never shall it be said of Meriel Howard, that she had by her perfidy placed a dagger in the heart of an innocent woman; nor shall you forget this confiding, affectionate woman. Has she not sacrificed every consideration to you, friends, reputation, all that can render life desirea∣ble. If she is not your wife, she ought to have been so long since. And tho' you were dearer to me than the vital tide that nourishes my heart, that heart should break rather than injure her. In the midst of po∣verty and distress, if I can preserve my in∣tegrity unshaken, I shall still have one com∣fort, of which no earthly power can deprive me." Leave me Mr. Belger, I wish to be alone.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="029439_0274_0FE11502FAF08BF8"/>
"Unkind girl to treat me thus, when it was my intention to extricate you from these impending difficulties and placed you in af∣fluence." "You would have degraded me to infamy, I thank your generosity."</P>
<P>"By heavens! Miss Howard I will marry you." "No, Mr. Belger, that would be only using the sacred ceremony as a cloak to perfidy and deceit. Leave me, sir, my resolution is fixed, and not the cruelest tortures poverty and its attendant evils can inflict shall tempt me to alter it." I then broke from him, and going into an inner apartment fastened the door, and waited till I was certain he had left the house.</P>
<P>Tho' I now found myself plunged in the most miserable situation, I felt a secret satis∣faction in reflecting I had acted with propri∣ety in regard to Mr. Belger, as reason plainly pointed out how little hope there could be of felicity with a man, who could, guided merely by the caprice of passion, forsake a woman so faithful, and so tender as Mrs. Belger. Religion also told me, how little I should deserve, should I be so selfish as to fix the basis of my own prosperity, on the misery of a fellow creature, "Almighty Father," said I, "assist me with thy grace that I may be enabled to perform my duty
<PB N="100" REF="029439_0275_0FE11507F4067B40"/>
in every state of life, and allot me what tri∣als thy infinite wisdom shall think proper." I breathed this short prayer as I retired to bed, a sweet serenity came over my mind, and I enjoyed a profound sleep till near eight the next morning. I will now con∣clude this long letter; be assured you shall not long wait for the sequel of my melan∣choly tale. Your's ever</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIV. MERIEL to CELIA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>London,</HI> <DATE><HI>March</HI> 2<HI>d,</HI> 1781.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I JUDGE of my dear Celia's impatience, by what I should feel where she in the si∣tuation in which I was, when I concluded my last: I will not trifle with you, but pro∣ceed in my narrative. The next morning I arose and went down stairs to Mr. Newtram, told him I was ready to admit the persons he had mentioned into the apartment to va∣lue the furniture, and hoped there would be more than sufficient to pay all I owed: I was continuing to speak to him, when turn∣ing my head I saw the laceman enter the shop. He pretended not to know my situa∣tion, tho' I am certain he had been sent for by Newtram, and told me a long story, to which I paid but little attention, about hav∣ing a large sum to make up, &amp;c. I desired him to wait a little while, and I made no
<PB N="102" REF="029439_0277_0FE11510D6599E60"/>
doubt but I should have sufficient to discharge his bill. Alas! my Celia, I did not at that time think of the vast difference between sell∣ing and buying. I knew the little furniture I possessed, together with what Mr. Welldon had given me, had cost more than sixty pounds and were at present nearly as good as new. But when the man had looked them over, and taken an inventory, he offered me only thirty five guineas for the whole, in which was included my piano forte. I urged how much more they had cost me, and how little they had been used. He answered that was nothing to him; he could afford to give no more; there were some things would be of no use to him; they would lay a dead stock upon his hands, and if I did not choose to take that, it was all very well, he had rather leave them than have them.</P>
<P>What could I do? I found I must either sell them or go to prison, and tho' I knew not by what means to support life, liberty had still some charms for me. I took the money, and turning toward my creditors, for by this time they were all assembled, laid the money on the table, and desired Mr. Newtram to pay them all as far as it would go; but they were not to be satisfied with this. "You have good cloaths, Miss Howard," said New∣tram, "you cannot expect poor people will
<PB N="103" REF="029439_0278_0FE1151650089D40"/>
set down quietly with their loss, and suffer you to go off with a trunk full of finery." "Alas! sir," said I, "the cloaths you men∣tion are so few and composed of such indif∣ferent materials, I did not think they would be of any value but to the owner. There are some few pices of edging, sir," continued I, turning to the laceman, "which I must beg of you to take again." My trunks were now brought down stairs. Mrs. Newtram chose out the best of my gowns, linen, &amp;c. which were set down at less than half their value: the edgings were produced, when to my ut∣ter astonishment, the laceman declared he would not take them without an allowance of one third of what I had paid him for them only a few months before.</P>
<P>At length all demands were discharged, my furniture taken away, and myself left so∣litary in the empty rooms: I went down stairs and delivered up the keys. I had done no∣thing but weep all day, and had taken no kind of nourishment since my breakfast, and it was now four o'clock in the afternoon. Mrs. Newtram did not ask me to sit down; but when I left the parlour I felt myself so sick and faint that I was obliged to sit down on the foot of the stairs, where my feelings became so poignant that I thought I should have been suffocated. Poor Betty came to
<PB N="104" REF="029439_0279_0FE1151A9E3D1AA8"/>
me, and endeavoured to comfort me, but her own sobs were so audible as to prevent my understanding what she said: In a few moments Mrs. Newtram came out of the parlour. "Dear me, Miss Howard," said she, "you will make yourself quite ill with fretting, and then, what is to become of you; come, come, cheer up, all will be well again, by and by; one of our young men will call you a coach, you don't consider how soon it is dark this time of the year." "I don't want a coach," said I, "there is nothing very heavy to carry; I will tye up a few things in a handkerchief and leave the rest till I have some settled place of abode, when I will send for them." "But it's a wet evening, child," said she, "and a long walk to town." "No matter, I will not have a coach." "Perhaps, Miss Howard, you will be affronted, but if you cannot pay for one, accept these five shillings."</P>
<P>Celia, this vile ostentation, this shew of generosity, after she had stripped me of al∣most every thing, awakened my resentment. "No, Mrs. Newtram," said I, "if I am obliged to borrow money, I have a few more cloaths left, on which I imagine I can raise it; but at present I have a few shillings, which is sufficient for this evening, to-mor∣row I will send for my cloaths." She flung
<PB N="105" REF="029439_0280_0FE1151FB43E3CB0"/>
into the parlour, muttering something about ingratitude, pride and poverty. It was a cold rainy evening, the latter end of October, when with a small bundle in my hand, and a load of grief at my heart, I set forward on foot from Kensington; I had not proceeded far before I heard a quick step behind me, and presently was accosted by Mr. Belger.</P>
<P>"Where are you going my dear crea∣ture, this cold, wet night?" "I am going to town, sir, and am in haste." "Where shall you lodge in town?" "Indeed, I do not know." "My dear Miss Howard, you are I fear more distressed than you are will∣ing to confess, believe me I am your friend, confide in me, I will not suffer you to want any assistance in my power to give; but we cannot conveniently consult what is best to be done, thus in the open street; step into this house, (we were just opposite an house of entertainment,) I have ordered my car∣riage here to take me up, and when we have had a cup of tea we will proceed to town together."</P>
<P>"No, sir," said I, "it is to no purpose to solicit me, I am determined to go on to town immediately." "Than let me call a coach, my dear girl, you must not be thus exposed to the inclemency of the weather."</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="029439_0281_0FE1152284ECA2A8"/>
"Mr. Belger, if you wish me to believe you my friend, leave me, nor thus increase my almost insupportable load of anguish, by making offers which I neither can nor will accept." "Then let me have the pleasure of supplying you with cash till it is in your power to repay me." This too I obstinate∣ly refused, and the rain just then increasing, he ceased his solicitations after saying I should always find a friend in him, he left me to pursue my uncomfortable walk. It was near seven o'clock, when I arrived in town, with only a few shillings in my pocket no friend to apply to and entirely at a loss how to dispose of myself that night, as the people in London are fearful of taking stran∣gers into their houses, without a proper re∣commendation; not having sufficient reso∣lution to apply to any house for a lodging I kept walking on till I came to the strand, where, just as I was passing a large haberdash∣er's shop, a carriage overturned, the horses took fright, and I ran with many others into the shop, for safety; I had not been there above five minutes, before I heard a female voice exclaim, good God! can it be? yes, I am certain it is Miss Howard; the lady had now come close up to me, and on raising my eyes, I beheld Amelia Sidney a young lady whom I had once or twice seen at my aunts.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="029439_0282_0FE11528070C4E58"/>
Shall I confess, that shame at being seen in so draggled a condition was the first sen∣sation I felt, however, Amelia soon made me forget that, when kindly taking my hand in the soft voice of affection, she said, "my dear Miss Howard, where have you hid yourself all this time;" then observing my wet cloak and bonnet, she continued: "You have been walking in the rain my love, I have a coach waiting, give me leave to set you down wherever you wish to go." The soothing voice of tenderness as soon wrings tears from the afflicted heart, as does the churlish voice of chiding, but then the one drops gently, while the softest sen∣sations pervade the soul, the other is the source of such real anguish, that memory will retain the pain they occasion for years afterwards.</P>
<P>I could not answer the kind miss Sidney, but followed her in silence to the coach, when we were seated she again renewed her question, "where will you be set down?" The anguish of my heart now burst out, and I cried, I have no home: all places are alike to me, "then you shall go home with me," said Amelia. "Oh Miss Sid∣ney," said I, "do not think by thus accpt∣ing your kind offer of stepping into the coach I mean to throw myself on your be∣nevolence,
<PB N="108" REF="029439_0283_0FE1152C85423100"/>
my only motive was to have an opportunity of enquiring whether you could recommend me to any place, where I might lodge for a little time, till I could consider how to dispose of myself in future. Favour me with your advice, dear lady, for indeed I have no friends in the world, who interests themselves the least in my welfare." She pressed my hand and after softly saying, "be comfored, my dear," remained silent, till the coach stopped, she then assisted me to alight, and leading me up stairs left me a few moments in the drawing room; but soon returned with her mother. Mrs. Sidney received me with the chearful smile of an old friend, and Amelia brought a change of cloaths which she insisted on my putting on. Supper soon came in. The manner which Mrs. Sidney and her daughter observed towards me, was delicate and attentive in the extreme. Not a word scaped them that had the least appearance of curiosity; they seemed to treat me as tho' I had been paying an expected visit, and to consider my com∣pany as an obligation; when the cloath was removed, I told my amiable hostess, I thought it but right she should know by what means I became reduced to so distrest a condi∣tion, but Amelia stopped me. "Dear Miss Howard," said she, "if it is in our power to serve you, do not hesitate to point out
<PB N="109" REF="029439_0284_0FE11531E8CFAD78"/>
the way, and you will not find us backward in performing it; but I insist that you do not enter into explanations which may be painful to you. You have no doubt been unfortunate, as such and knowing the ex∣cellence of your heart, you have a claim upon my friendship, I am ready to prove myself your sincere well wisher, but I have no right to enter into a minute investigation of your past conduct." "But, my dear lady," said I, "it is absolutely necessary, you should be acquainted with many past in∣cidents of my life, that you may better con∣cieve my present situation and be enabled to favour me with your advice, for my future conduct. "Well, my dear," said Mrs. Sid∣ney, "whatever you think proper," "I thank heaven madam," said I, "tho' I shall shall acquaint you with many errors, some of which I tremble but to think on, (for at that moment, Celia, I remembered my impious despondency, and the divine interposition of providence which delivered me at the very moment, when to avoid temporal misery I was rushing into guilt.) Yet I have done nothing to make me ashamed, and tho' my reputation has been sullied. "We have all our errors, Miss Howard," said Amelia, "and we all hope to have those errors forgiven, then should we not be always rea∣dy to forgive the errors of our fellow crea∣tures.
<PB N="110" REF="029439_0285_0FE1153658128190"/>
Come my dear girl let me persuade you to drop the subject, whatever have been your errors I am sure you now renounce them, and whatever are your misfortunes we will strive to aleviate, if we cannot entirely remove them." "You are very good, Miss Sidney, but give me leave to proceed, I will not detain you long." I then in as few words as possible comprised the whole of my sufferings, not even endeavouring to veil my errors, from the time of my father's im∣prisonment, till the present day; she listened with attention, and taking my hand said, "Conviction sits on your countenance, I will not doubt your relation, my dear Meriel, because it has been delivered with such in∣genious frankness that to hear is to believe; but you have been strangely misrepresented, by those whose duty it was to defend rather than asperse your character." She then in∣formed me that the Mossops had propogated the most malignant censures against me, and from at first pointing me out as an ob∣ject of ridicule to entertain their friends, at length represented me as fit only for their contempt. In short, folly, ignorance, hypo∣crisy, and profligacy, had been set forward, as the most striking traits in my character, and at the very moment when Amelia met me, she supposed me sunk into infamy and shame. "But," said she, "I saw you was
<PB N="111" REF="029439_0286_0FE1153B6D5BD8D0"/>
unhappy, and I know it is our duty not to remember the faults, when an opportunity offers, wherein we may be of service to a person in distress, I am now more than ever convinced of the propriety of such a mode of conduct, for had I not acted thus, I should never have known how much Miss Howard had been injured, and how little her unworthy friends deserved such a rela∣tive, but I beg," continued she, "you will consider yourself at home. Believe me, you are as welcome as a sister, and whenever you hear of a situation which you think will suit you, my mother and I will give you every necessary recommendation, but do not be in a hurry to leave us, we shall not soon be tired of your company."</P>
<P>She then shewed me to a neat bed-chamber adjoining her own, and wishing me a good nights repose, left me. And who is this bene∣volent girl? methinks I hear you say. She is, my dear Celia, the daughter of a man, who by industry in a respectable line of business, brought up a numerous family in a reputable manner. He lived to see his sons well settled in the world, and had saved enough to leave at his death, Mrs. Sidney and this, his only daughter a comfortable independence. Ame∣lia had a genteel, but yet useful education, she was equally qualified to shine in public or
<PB N="112" REF="029439_0287_0FE1154047F3DF98"/>
private life, she preferred the latter. Her mother's happiness constituted her own, she read to her, worked with her, considered her peace as the main spring for all her acti∣ons, and loved her with a tender respect bordering on devotion. Yet with a pleasing graceful person, a lively disposition, and a large share of good sense, has this amiable girl reached her twety-fifth year, without one offer of marriage, she has had many lovers, but she declares they all deserted their colours, when they understood, she would have no fortune till the death of her mother. "So you see, my dear," said she, one day smiling "I am destined to wear the willow as long as I live." More shame for the male world if she is, Celia, for I think I could venture to pronounce him a happy man, who should be so fortunate as to obtain such a wife.</P>
<P>I have been in this kind family, now near a month, but have not as yet heard of any thing, that I think will suit, tho' I am deter∣mined to take almost any situation rather than remain a burthen upon the benevolence of Amelia and her mother; who, tho' they have sufficient for all the comforts and some of the elegancies of life, I am sure, cannot afford to have me constantly with them. I sent for the rest of my cloaths the day after I left Kensington, but received no message
<PB N="113" REF="029439_0288_0FE1154562F40B38"/>
from thence, nor have I heard a syllable of Mr. Belger, I hope you will grant me the credit of not wishing it. I even gave the per∣son who went for my things a strict charge, not to mention in what part of the town I resided.</P>
<P><HI>March</HI> 3<HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>A lady called this evening at Mrs. Sid∣ney's, who said she had heard of a place which she thought would suit me: it is to be companion to an elderly lady in the country, to read to her, walk with her help entertain her company and attend a little to the do∣mestic concerns of the family. The salary, I find, is but small, that shall be no objection, I never was extravagant in dress, and I think I shall hardly begin now. I am to go to-mor∣row morning at ten o'clock to speak to a lady, who is a distant relation of Mrs. Rooks∣by, and who has been desired by her to look out for the kind of person she wants. I wish I may be so lucky as to succeed in this ap∣plication, as I trust I could render myself agreeable to the old lady, and I would like∣wise exert myself to be useful. The mail goes to-morrow, before I shall have time to write again, but my Celia, may depend on my seizing the first opportunity, to let her know my success. Adieu, my beloved friend, tho' I can never love you less, you must be hence∣forth

up my pen, I meant not to complain, indeed I did not, I am fully sensible if my blessings were measured only according to my de∣merits, I should be poor indeed, but our heavenly father, portions out our comforts according to the measure of his love. Alas! if our deserts were only considered, who would dare abide the decision; friendship is his choicest best gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, and have I not found that pure and un-alloyed in the breasts of Celia and Amleia.

<Q><L>It is an empty sound,</L>
<L>The haughty fair one's jest</L>
<L>On earth unseen or only found</L>
<L>To warm the turtles nest.</L></Q></P>
<P>Oh yes there is love on earth; sincere, tender, affectionate, faithful, ardent hearts, but they were not formed for me, Celia; and I must learn submission without repining, you wonder what all this means, I cannot tell you just now; when I am more composed I will resume my pen. How strange does it appear that I should be an object of malice or envy to others, who never harboured a wish to the prejudice, or envied the good fortune of any one.</P>
<P>The morning after I sent off my last, my dear Celia, I dressed myself neat but very
<PB N="116" REF="029439_0291_0FE115547219C670"/>
plain, and at ten o'clock found myself at the door of Mr. Kingly, in Golden square, the servant, who opened it, told me his lady was not come down: he begged I would wait in a parlour, where there was a fire, and brought me a newspaper to amuse me. In about twenty minutes, he returned and de∣sired me to walk up stairs. I followed him into a back drawing room, where an elegant woman sat preparing to make tea, and a nurse was in the room with a very young child. The lady arose and received me with every mark of politeness; but I was scarcely seated before a voice struck my ears, which vibrated to my throbbing heart, I felt my face glow, but had not a moment for thought, before the door opened, and Rainsforth en∣tered the room holding a boy about twelve months old in his arms. Surprise threw me entirely off my guard, I gave a sudden shriek and fainted.</P>
<P>What passed during my indisposition I cannot tell, but when I recovered, I found the lady sitting beside me on the sopha, applying volatiles to my nose and temples, while a maid servant stood by with water, but neither Rainsforth or the children were in the room. "Are you subject to these ill turns, my dear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>?" said the lady. "No madam," said I, "but sudden surprise will
<PB N="117" REF="029439_0292_0FE11559B06FBC08"/>
sometimes serve me thus." "Do you know Mr. Kingly? Was it his presence that caused such violent emotions?" "Only that you call him Kingly, madam, I should say the gentleman who came in just now was a Mr. Rainsforth, of Plymouth." "Is your name Howard?" said the lady visibly agitated. I answered in the affirmative. "Then," said she, "I can account for the exclamation with which he left the room. You are right in your conjectures Miss Howard, Rains∣forth and Kingly are one and the same per∣son. He took my name on our union, of which I suppose you were unacquainted. "I was indeed, a stranger to it, madam, or I should not have presumed to have intruded here; pardon the involuntary confusion I have occasioned, and permit me to retire." "You are not as yet sufficiently recovered," said she, "to venture out. Pray, stop, and compose yourself, and if it will not occasion a return of your disorder, we will send for Mr. Kingly to take his breakfast." I was beginning to apologize for the disagreeable interruption I had given, but she stopped me. "I shall not listen to a syllable of excuse. I am sure it was unintentional, but I will not forgive it on any other terms than its never being mentioned in future."</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="029439_0293_0FE1155E500ED700"/>
Kingly, as I must henceforth call him, was now summoned to breakfast, I endea∣voured to command my countenance; but I fear to little effect; I attempted to rise, when he entered the room, but my limbs re∣fused their office. He bowed and took his seat in silence, a cup of tea was handed him: his hand trembled so he could not raise it to his mouth. I did not dare lift my eyes, least I should encounter his, I felt my face alterna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ely red and pale; and it was with difficulty I could restrain my tears. We were all silent for near five minutes. Mrs. Kingly seemed the least embarrassed of the three, and at length ventured to say, "my dear Kingly you forget your politeness to day, pray help Miss Howard to some muffin." "I believe," said he, "it is by some other name we must address this lady now." Surprise at what he uttered tempted me to raise my eyes with a kind of inquisitive look." "My name is still Howard," said I, "nor have the least intention of altering it." "Were you not on the point of being married about two years since?" I was more astonished than ever at this question. I knew not what to answer: to have menti∣oned any thing of my intended union with Kingly before his wife, would perhaps have only served to make her unhappy. At length I answered, I was, it is true, near being mar∣ried
<PB N="119" REF="029439_0294_0FE115648C197920"/>
about that time, but I had every reason to suppose you, as well as the rest of my ac∣quaintance, knew the cause of the match being broke off. I have never had a thought since of altering my condition. "It is very strange," said he, and the conversation drop∣ped. I then began to recollect the reason which had brought me to the house of a man whom I wished, of all others, most to avoid, and turning to Mrs. Kingly made the necessary enquiries concerning the place I wanted to engage for. Having received an∣swers greatly to my satisfaction, I arose to take my leave, referring her to Mrs. Sidney for my character. "I dare say there will be no necessity to make those enquiries," said she, "but if you will mention any day when you will favour me with your company to dinner, I will introduce you to my aunt, who is fortunately now in town."</P>
<P>I told her if she would favour me so far, as to give me a line to Mrs. Rooksby, I would wait on that lady at any time she would please to appoint, but must beg leave to decline the proposed honour of dining with her, as I feared it would not be possible to disengage myself from the kind friends with whom I at present resided, till an absolute settlement obliged me to leave them. Indeed, my dear Celia, I felt there would be a great impropri∣ety
<PB N="120" REF="029439_0295_0FE1156A7AE92958"/>
in endeavouring to cultivate an intimacy with Mrs. Kingly, for should she not have been acquainted with the connection that formerly subsisted between her husband and myself, and should by any means hereafter hear of it, she might naturally suppose I cul∣tivated her acquaintance, that I might the more easily enjoy her husband's society; and if, as I suspect, she already knows how near we were being united by the tenderest ties, she would certainly approve a conduct, which would shew how much her happiness was preferred to my own gratification. I will confess I wished for nothing more than a conversation with Kingly, for I plainly per∣ceived some mystery couched beneath the few sentences that passed, while we were at breakfast: But this wish I was sensible would be both improper and imprudent to seek to gratify. Mrs. Kingly having therefore nam∣ed a day, when she thought it would be con∣venient for her aunt to see me, and menti∣oned an hour when she would call and take me to her, I took my leave. I slightly re∣garded Kingly's countenance, as I wished him good morning, and discovered in it strong traits <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> and impatience.</P>

<PB N="121" REF="029439_0296_0FE10841ECD80E88"/>
any concealments from such worthy friends, I therefore briefly related all that concerned Rainsforth, and my unfortunate rencounter with him that morning. "Upon my word, Meriel," said she, "every word you utter excites fresh wonder. I remember hearing of the affair you mention, but it was always spoken of in such a ludicrous strain, that I have myself frequently joined in the laugh against you, considering you as a poor, fond girl, who fancied every man who but spoke a civil word was in love with you, and re∣turned this imaginary passion with all the en∣thusiastic ardor of romantic affection." I made Miss Sidney no answer, but going to my trunk, returned with all the letters which had passed between Rainsforth and myself. "This proof of your fortitude and magna∣nimity," said she, when she had perused them, "was only wanting to complete my esteem for your character; for, it is from these letters only, that I have learnt in what manner you disposed of your fortune. Ge∣nerous, noble spirited girl, it is only for such hearts as yours to be tried in the ordeal of af∣fliction; but surely heaven has some future reward in store, that will amply compensate the sufferings you are ordained to endure."</P>
<P>"Oh! my dear Amelia," said I, "have I not already an ample compensation in your
<PB N="122" REF="029439_0297_0FE115781CDE6568"/>
friendship and affection. Praises from your lips are balm to my wounded heart: may I never forfeit your esteem." "That I am sure you never will. I only blush to think how long I remained a stranger to your me∣rits; but the real diamond is always enve∣loped in a crust, thro' which it is only on near inspection, we can discover its intrinsic value." "Ah! flatterer," said I, smiling, while the tear of grateful affection stole from my eye. Oh! Celia, when I forget the friendship of Amelia Sidney, the benefits re∣ceived from her hands, the misery from which she snatched me, may I be forgot by that Providence to whom we can only look for support. Bless her, all-bounteous hea∣ven; make her felicity as boundless as the benevolence of her heart; let her comforts be many, and her afflictions few: and when this transitory scene is past, soft and gentle be her passage to the grave.

I told her I would by no means wish to see him, and requested the servant might be permitted to deny me in case any gentleman should call. Our measures were but just settled when a knock at the door announced a visitor, and by list∣ening at the top of the stair-case, I plainly heard Kingly's voice. He seemed much dis∣appointed at not finding me at home, and left word he would call at twelve o'clock the next day: accordingly I wrote the follow∣ing note to be delivered when he came.</P>

<P>MISS HOWARD's compliments to Mr. Kingly; requests as a particular favour, he will not give himself the trouble to call any more, as Mr. Kingly cannot be ignorant, that there are many forcible reasons existing, which renders it totally improper for Miss H. to recieve his visits. She desires no expla∣nation of past incidents; sincerely wishes Mr. K. every felicity; but is certain any intercourse between them, will not tend to promote it. It is that reason only, which urges Miss H. to avoid an intimacy with

<P>I AM convinced I have been decieved; an explanation is absolutely necessary to my repose. I find you are the same charming, delicate girl, I once adored; nay, which even at this moment I find dearer to my heart, than aught the world contains beside. Then, think not, I will sit tamely down, while you suppose me an unfeeling, capri∣cious monster. There is one way, by which I can clear myself; there is one, who can plead my cause, and you not refuse to listen.

<P>The next morning Mrs. Kingly called as she had appointed, and took me with her in the chariot to Mrs. Rooksby. This old
<PB N="126" REF="029439_0301_0FE1159122D77AB8"/>
lady is extremely pleasing in her manner. Her person, tho' advanced in years, retains many traces of grace and elegance. She expressed her approbation of me, in the po∣litest terms, and said, she should consider herself extremely fortunate in the acquisition of such a companion. Her terms were much more liberal than I had been led to expect; and as we were soon agreed, she requested me to appoint an early day for my removal to her house. "Business of a very particular nature," said she, "required my presence in London, which I have not visit∣ed before for upwards of twenty years, nor shall I now remain in it long; but while I do stay, I shall wish to enter into a few of its amusements, and I am certain I shall re∣ceive double satisfaction from them all, when I am favoured with your company." It was then determined, that day week should be the time of my removal, and we took our leave. When I was again in the carriage with Mrs. Kingly, she said, "it gives me great pleasure to find my aunt is likely to make so agreeable an addition to her family; nor have I the least doubt, but you will be satisfied with your situation, as she is a wo∣man of an easy, chearful disposition. And now my dear Miss Howard, as we have set∣tled this important business, you must give me leave to execute a commission, I yester∣day

undertook. I have a letter for you," continued she, smiling. "You may perhaps guess from whom. Come, no drawing back, I can assure you there will not be the least impropriety in your recieving it, and I flat∣ter myself I have interest sufficient to ob∣tain an answer." She then put the letter into my hand. You may judge my confu∣sion. It was impossible to speak, for I was utterly at a loss what to say. I believe, I never looked more like a fool. Mrs. King∣ly saw my embarrassment, and kindly, did not seem to expect me to speak, but began a conversation on things quite foreign to the subject. When we arrived at Mrs. Sidney's door, she refused to alight; but wishing me a good day, said, she should expect to hear from me soon.</P>
<P>I ran up stairs to Amelia, and putting the letter into her hand, cried, open it, read it for me, for indeed I have not resolution to read it myself. Enclosed my dear Celia, is a copy of the letter; also of one from Mrs. Kingly, in which it was enclosed; when you have perused them, I am sure you will la∣ment with your poor friend, that such merit as Rainsforth's, (for still I love that name,) should be severed from her, by the malice of those, who could really reap no advantage from her disappointment. Whatever were

the motives, that instigated the Mossops to practice such an imposition on us both, they are undoubtedly disappointed; for from the time of Rainsforth's marriage with Miss Kingly he carefully avoided all intercourse with the family; the reasons for which you will find in his letter.

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>March</HI>
9<HI>th,</HI> 1781.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I FEEL, my dear Miss Howard, that I am under an indispensible necessity of writ∣ing to you, to request you will attend to the explanation so ardently desired by Mr. King∣ly; and from which your rigid sense of propriety, urges you to recede: but in what manner shall I address you, dear, amiable young lady, when I am sensible I have, tho' unknowingly, stepped between you and hap∣piness. Often have I heard your name, oft listened to your commendations, from lips which never spoke, but they conveyed plea∣sure to my heart.</P>
<P>My father's family lived in terms of the greatest intimacy with that of Mr. Rains∣forth's; Frederic and myself were nearly of the same age, were frequently together, we
<PB N="130" REF="029439_0305_0FE115A6D45AE830"/>
learnt to dance at the same school, and at our annual ball I was always selected for his partner. Our infantine attachment was no∣ticed by both our parents, and Frederic was often smilingly called my little husband. As we increased in years, this attachment grew weaker on the part of Frederic, but in my bosom it gathered new strength; the many good qualities so conspicuous in the boy, became dignified virtues in the bosom of the man. I always wept when duty called him from his native place, and rejoiced un∣feignedly at his return. When my uncle made me his heiress, my parents began to shew some disapprobation of my visible par∣tiality; and when I repeatedly refused the most splendid offers, treated my passion with a rigour, which served only to make its im∣pression on my heart more indeliable. Just before old Mr. Rainsforth met with the mis∣fortune, which was, I understand, the first cause of your separation from his son. I lost both my parents within a very short pe∣riod of each other, and became my own mis∣tress: I know not how to proceed, I am at a loss for words, in which I can acknow∣ledge a weakness, which I fear you will con∣demn; but anxious to restore peace to the bosom of Rainsforth and prosperity to his family; and perfectly unacquainted with his engagements to the amiable Miss Howard,
<PB N="131" REF="029439_0306_0FE115AC6FBCCF58"/>
I so far overstepped the bounds prescribed our sex, as to write to him making a tender of myself and fortune: instead of writing an answer to this letter, he came himself, thank∣ed me in the tenderest manner for what he termed my generous designs in his favour; but declared his heart was under a prior engagement. He then expiated largely on the virtues of Miss Howard, and declared, tho' for the present, fortune had placed in∣superable barriers to obstruct your union, he should ever hold himself as bound to you, and while you remained single, consider himself not at liberty to marry any other wo∣man. He requested that tho' unable to ac∣cept the offered honour of my hand, he might not be deprived of my friendship, and declared he should always think on me with gratitude and affection.</P>
<P>From this time I sedulously endeavoured to conquer a passion, which I found preyed upon my peace of mind, and when I heard of the fortune left his family flattered my∣self I had succeeded: I sincerely rejoiced in the prospect of his felicity in an union with you, which he told me would now soon be completed: but one morning he came to me in visible agitation, and taking my hand, cried, "dear Margaret, I am disappointed in my tenderest hopes, Meriel Howard is mar∣ried."
<PB N="132" REF="029439_0307_0FE115B14C5735D0"/>
I tried to persuade him he had been misinformed; but he said there was no room for doubt, as it had been confirmed by your own hand. He now visited me every day, and I will confess to you, I exerted myself to divert his melancholy; I in some measure succeeded; and one day as we were chatt∣ing together on indifferent subjects, he sud∣denly caught my hand and cried, "if my lovely friend would accept the offer of a heart that was once devoted to another, happiness might yet be my portion; but I dare not indulge so sweet a hope." I will not repeat to you, Miss Howard, the many conversa∣tions we had on this subject; suffice it to say we were soon united. From that happy moment, his tenderness, his assiduity, has every day increased: I saw his heart still beat true to its first attachment; but I also saw his struggles to suppress its emotions. He never indulged himself in talking of you, carefully avoiding every place where he might chance to hear your name mentioned. The violent agitation, which you was thrown into by his entering the room the other morn∣ing, and an exclamation which broke from him, as he caught you, when you were falling to the ground, made me readily conceive who it was I had the honour to entertain. I felt for you both, more than I can express: I had long been acquainted with your virtues, though a
<PB N="133" REF="029439_0308_0FE115B746F3BD48"/>
stranger to your person, and I wished ear∣nestly for power to alleviate sufferings, of which I considered myself the cause.</P>
<P>I easily understood your generous motive for declining visiting at my house. I esteem, I venerate you for it, tho' I am certain no ill consequence could ensue from an intimacy between two hearts so chaste, so much under the guidance of religion and honour, as your's and Mr. Kingly's. The day after I first had the pleasure of seeing you, I per∣ceived Mr. Kingly to be melancholy and ab∣sent. I pressed to know the cause. He was at first embarrassed; at length he candidly told me he wished much for a conversation with you, to clear up some mysteries which at present tormented him beyond measure; that he had called on you twice, but you ab∣solutely refused to see him. He then shew∣ed me your note, and asked, if he were to write a few lines, whether I would prevail with you to read them, and grant him an an∣swer. I readily promised him to comply with this request, and I hope, my dear Miss Howard, you will by an answer, restore peace to his bosom; for I am well convinced, he will never be happy while he imagines you
<PB N="134" REF="029439_0309_0FE115BCD3F41BC8"/>
think him unworthy your regard. I am, dear young lady, with every sentiment of es∣teem, and every kind wish for your happi∣ness,</P>

<P>THAT you are still unmarried, my dear Meriel, is to me the cause of great asto∣nishment; that you are depressed in your circumstances, and obliged to seek by servi∣tude the necessary means to support life, gives the accutest pangs to a heart, that ever wished and would have rejoiced in your hap∣piness.
<PB N="135" REF="029439_0310_0FE115C39219D9A0"/>
I fear we have both been deceived; but why that deceit has been practised against us, I am at a loss to think. I know you ne∣ver were a favourite with the Mossop's. They envied virtues they had not spirit to imitate; but why they should thus labour to render two unoffending beings so com∣pletely miserable, is altogether unaccounta∣ble. I have, my dear friend, (the blush of shame crimsons my cheek while I write it) but I have doubted your virtues. I have thought you false, capricious, light and un∣deserving: and much I fear, you have been taught to think me the vilest of my sex. But let me hasten to exculpate myself from so black a charge. Let me trace back to the time that even at this moment my soul shud∣ders to think upon. Let me lead your ideas back to the letter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Vol. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 152.</NOTE> I wrote informing you of the happy change in my father's fortune. I was hastily preparing to come to London, from which place unavoidable business had detained me much longer than my impati∣ence could well brook; when one morning I met young Mossop, who at that time be∣longed to a ship lying at Plymouth. After the usual salutations, he asked me if I had that morning any letters from London. I replied, I had been from home all the morn∣ing.
<PB N="136" REF="029439_0311_0FE115C91702FDC0"/>
You will, no doubt, on your return, find letters, said he; for I have just heard from Hester, who mentions having seen her cousin, and that she was employed in writing to you. My heart sunk, my dear Meriel, at this intelligence; for, as in my letter I had mentioned the time I should leave Ply∣mouth, I did not expect an answer, and na∣turally thought, it must have been some∣thing particular had occasioned your writing. I left Mossop and instantly returned home; where I found a letter, the contents of which had nearly fired my brain. It is indeliably imprinted on my memory; it can never be forgotten. These were the words:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE receipt of your last favour, occasi∣oned a mixture of both pain and pleasure in my bosom. I was extremely happy to hear of your increase of fortune; but pained to find you still retained your partiality for me. Absence, my good sir, and a variety of in∣cidents, has entirely obliterated from my heart, every trace, of what I once called love. But I find I was deceived, in suppos∣ing myself actuated by that passion. I shall ever remember Mr. Rainsforth with the most grateful esteem; but my heart, and
<PB N="137" REF="029439_0312_0FE115CF1EC8B108"/>
all its tenderest affections, are devoted to another object; to whom, to-morrow morn∣ing I mean to plight my faith, in the most solemn manner. I imagined a knowledge of this event, would prevent your intended journey to the metropolis. I should be greatly obliged, if you would seal up all my letters and give them to my cousin Mossop, who will send them to town in a parcel to his sister. At the same time, please to in∣form me whether you would wish yours to be returned, or whether I have your per∣mission to consign them to eternal oblivion.</P>

<P>I cannot give you the least idea of the poignancy o my feelings, or the madness of my actions, at this cruel, insulting letter. I was absolutely frantic: my father endeavour∣ed to sooth me. He had always expressed a dislike at my proposed union with you, tho' for what reason I never could learn. He told me I ought to rejoice at having disco∣vered your light, changeable disposition, before it was in your power to injure my honour. I listned to him with reverence;
<PB N="138" REF="029439_0313_0FE115D447B4AFD0"/>
I knew he never yet had expressed a wish, which did not ultimately tend to my good: I endeavour to calm my transports, and strove to persuade myself I should soon hate you. I wrote you a long letter, wherein I gave vent to the anguish of my heart. I then sealed up all the dear pledges of your affection, and which till that moment had been preserved as the choicest treasures I possessed, and went to seek Mossop.</P>
<P>"You did not tell me," said I, "your cousin Meriel was married." "Dear Rains∣forth," said he, "I had not courage to in∣form you of her perfidy, as I knew you lov∣ed the unworthy girl." "She has desir∣ed," said I, "to have her letters returned; here they are: you are to send them to your sister. Oh! Mossop, I could not have be∣lieved Meriel Howard"—"I am sorry," said he, interrupting me, "I had not be∣fore warned you of her disposition. She always was of a sickle temper, I could have told you of many instances of her levity of heart, which she so effectually hides under an affectation of sentiment and reserve; but you were so bigoted to her, you would not have believed my assertions." He then told me, you were once attached to a married man, one Pringle, whom he was intimate with in London; that you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>loped from your fa∣ther's

house, and it was to be feared you had reason to repent your rashness. "Con∣summate hypoerite," said I. "But from this moment I erase her from my heart; I will never suffer myself to mention her name; I will be happy, spite of her cruel arts to undermine my peace."</P>
<P>From that time I carefully avoided, even the society of Mossop, least I should hear your name, and be tempted to break my resolves; and in a very short time I yeilded to the entreaties of my friends, and gave my hand to the lovely, amiable woman, whom you have seen, and whom I am sure you love; for her soul is congenial with your own. Meriel, I will not pretend to say I had forgot you; but the engaging qualities of my wife, the innocent beauties of my children had in a great measure, filled that void in my heart, which the loss of you had occasioned. Indeed, I had began to fancy myself happy, when your presence and sud∣den illness, the other morning, awakened my long stifled tenderness, convinced me I had been deceived, and that we both were destined to be miserable.</P>
<P>My wife, the best, the kindest of her sex, see's my sufferings, and generously <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them. Ah! my dear friend, how are those

sufferings augmented, when I reflect that the anguish which oppresses me, is conveyed to her gentle bosom, and she pines in secret at the want of that ardent affection, which would constitute the whole happiness of her life.</P>
<P>She has promised me, to deliver this to your hands; matchless tenderness! let her soft pleadings prevail my dear Miss Howard; write to me, if it is but one line, to say you do not quite despise me. Tell me also, whether you wrote that cruel letter; and if you did, what were your reasons for it. But, ah! it is impossible, you are the same charming, amiable woman, I once adored beyond life, and whose image only the pang that disolves every tie of nature, can erase from my heart.</P>
<P>Oh! Margret, thou much esteemed wo∣man, pardon these involuntary wanderings of my pen, I would die rather than injure you: this once forgive my wayward heart, and henceforth my every hour of life shall be devoted to thee.

<HEAD>MERIEL to CELIA, (in continuation.)</HEAD>
<P>CAN you concieve, my dear Celia, the poignancy of my feelings when I had read this horrid detail of the imposition that had been practised, thus to ruin the peace of Kingly and myself. Hester Mossop was the person, my suspicions rested on, yet why she should endeavour to undermine my hap∣piness, when it would by no means conduce either to her interest or felicity remains still an inexplicable riddle. I cannot tell you how often I read the dear letter which un∣decieved me, in regard to Kingly's conduct; how often I pressed it to my heart, and bath∣ed it in my tears: amiable youth, charming engaging woman, cried I, as I alternately read the letters of Frederic and his Marga∣ret; may your happiness be as complete as you are deserving: never will Meriel abuse the confidence you have placed in her. My resolution in what manner to conduct myself was soon formed. I determined to answer Kingly's letter, and to commit it unsealed to the care of his amiable wife; I laid my pro∣jected plan before the friendly Amelia, and finding it met her approbation, immedi∣ately sat down to put it in execution; the following is a copy of my letter to King∣ly.</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="142" REF="029439_0317_0FE115EA9A5D2928"/>
<HEAD>MISS HOWARD to MR. KINGLY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAD not the letter I have just perused been written in your hand, and delivered to me by Mrs. Kingly, I should be tempted to think some whining school boy had tried the extent of his genius in its composition. In the name of common sense, my good friend, to what do these piteous complaints tend, or from whence do they proceed? are you not the husband of a woman, every way calcu∣lated to make the connubial state a state of bliss? have you not two lovely children, the pledges of her tenderest affections; and has not Providence bountifully showered its fa∣vours on you? have you not health, ease and plenty? and yet simple mortal, that you are, do you complain and sigh, because you were not permitted to unite your fate with one, who, if you knew her half so well as I do, you would find entirely destitute of many of those amiable qualities which so eminently distinguish Mrs. Kingly. For shame Kingly, for shame, you almost tempt me to laugh; your present conduct is like that of a spoilt child, who having in his possession every valuable elegant toy his indulgent pa∣rents can procure him, by chance discovers
<PB N="143" REF="029439_0318_0FE115F0A3F0D228"/>
an insignificant trifle, which at some past pe∣riod had amused his fancy; but being now out of his reach, he raves, blubbers and roars, throws from him with wild impetuosity, those already in his possession, and with the right, wayward spirit of contradiction re∣fuses to be pacified. You are mistaken in supposing young Mossop decieved you in re∣gard to my character; nature formed me thoughtless, volatile and capricious: It is true, while you remained with me, I restrain∣ed my natural levity; but no sooner were you absent than I relapsed into my former folly, and innumerable are the giddy incon∣sistent actions I have committed; among which, no doubt you will reckon my writ∣ing such an unaccountable letter, merely to try the strength of your passion; to be sure, I did not think you would have resented it so highly; but when I found that my folly was the means of promoting your interest, I heartily rejoiced in your felicity, nor once wished to recall the transaction.</P>
<P>You are in another error in supposing me unhappy. I am one of those thoughtless, inconsiderate beings, who seldom lay any thing long to heart. My fortune is gone, it is true; but, it was disposed of in such a way, as I can never repent. My health and spirits are still unimpaired; then consider,
<PB N="144" REF="029439_0319_0FE115F630F11550"/>
my good friend, how little I have to regret, how much to be thankful for. It has struck me, since our interview in Golden-Square, that you might, perhaps, imagine my illness was occasioned by your sudden appearance. Do not encourage that idea; it is a false one. I am sometimes subject to those kind of fits; and they generally seize me without a mo∣ment's warning.</P>
<P>I flatter myself you will now be satisfied. Be assured, there is nothing can give me greater pleasure, than to see you and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> woman to whom your fate is united, enjoy uninterrupted solicity; for volatile an giddy as I am, I have yet a heart that exults in the prosperity of every surrounding ob∣ject. Believe me, Kingly, true felicity is placed within your reach, take the proffered blessing, and enjoy it with gratitude, nor let your own discontented fancies dash with gall the cup which Providence presents, over∣flowing with joy and peace. From the te∣nor of your letter, I should think you a hero of romance, lamenting in pathetic strains the disappointment of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> love. Pr'ythee, my good friend, shake off the boy, assume the man of sense, and learn to estimate true happiness, not by the inconsistent wishes of
<PB N="145" REF="029439_0320_0FE115FBF4D91938"/>
your wayward heart, but by its own intrinsic value. Adieu, and believe me your sincere well wisher.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>I will not pretend to tell you, what pain it cost me, my dear Celia, to write a letter so foreign to my feelings: to be obliged, as it were, to accuse myself of folly and inconsist∣ency; that would render me contemptible in the eyes of the only man, to whom I wish∣ed to appear amiable. But there was no other way to restore his peace, there was no other way to preserve the happiness of a wo∣man, who not only loved him with the most enthusiastic passion, but had placed an un∣bounded confidence in me, and shewn a friendship for me, which I should have ceased to deserve, could I once have been so mean as to envy her the possession of the man, who constituted the whole of her earthly felicity.</P>
<P>But tho' I wished Kingly to remain in his error, I could not bear to be thought mean∣ly of by this dear woman; I therefore took an opportunity, when I thought it most like∣ly he would not be at home, and waited on Mrs. Kingly. I gave her the letter, but at the same time told her, tho' I wished her husband to think my assertions true, I hoped
<PB N="146" REF="029439_0321_0FE11601B38600A0"/>
she would kindly believe I was not indeed the very inconsistent character I had repre∣sented myself, I then presented to her a pa∣per, briefly containing every circumstance which had passed between Kingly and my∣self, and enclosing the letter I had received, as I imagined, from his father. She read them with attention, and then declared it was not old Mr. Rainsforth's writing; said she knew his hand perfectly well, and also, that he was a man incapable of writing so inhuman a letter. "That there has been a strange deception practised, is very evident, my dear madam," said I, "but I make no doubt you will join me in thinking, it will be much better to conceal it from Mr. Kingly, as he would undoubtedly think as an officer and as a man of honour, he was under a ne∣cessity of resenting the ungenerous conduct of Mr. Mossop." "Dear, considerate girl," said she, taking my hand, "how do you contrive to rise every moment higher in my es∣teem. It appears a degree of cruelty to suf∣fer Mr. Kingly to retain such an erroneous opinion of your conduct." "But I must insist, my dear madam," said I, "on your keeping my secret. Remember it was on the promise of inviolable silence alone that I en∣trusted you." "But," cried she, tenderly, "I fear you are unhappy." "Indeed, I am not," I replied. "Sin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e those occurrences I
<PB N="147" REF="029439_0322_0FE1160752FA5660"/>
have just related to you, I have had so many trials, so many heavy afflictions, that I had seldom thought on Mr. Rainsforth within these last two years, except it was to rejoice, that by not being united to me, he had es∣caped a large share of sorrow, as he would unavoidably have taken a part in all my af∣flictions." "Ah! deceiver," said she, smil∣ing, "you cannot persuade me, that the heart once tenderly attached to such a man as Kingly, can so easily regain its tranquili∣ty. "But you do not reflect, my dear ma∣dam, that I thought him a false hearted swain, and strove with a laudable pride to ba∣nish him from my remembrance." "True," she replied, "but you are now undeceived." "Well, but believe me, it was too late to awaken the long stifled passion. My heart is just in the situation it was before I saw him. Nay, I really think it is easier; for I am now convinced that he is not altogether unwor∣thy the happiness that awaits him." I then purposely changed the conversation, enquir∣ed when she had seen her aunt, and how long that lady thought of remaining in town. "I long to go into the country," said I, "for there never was a woman so passion∣ately fond of still <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I am; I doat on a gloomy grotto; and a moonlight night, with a nightingale under my window, and a streamlet just near enough for its murmurs
<PB N="148" REF="029439_0323_0FE1160BF7F23460"/>
to be agreeable, fills me with delight." "You are of a melancholy turn then," said she.</P>
<P>"By no means," I replied, "I am the chearfulest creature breathing when free from noise and bustle; but if you wish to see me completely stupid, usher me into a crowd∣ed drawing-room, my faculties immediately take their flight, and I appear what I am in reality, a mere cypher to fill up the number of the company."</P>
<P>"I wish," said she, "our house in Devon∣shire was near my aunt's, I should, I am ve∣ry certain, pass many a happy hour in your society."</P>
<P>"You are at a great distance from her then?" "So far, that we seldom meet a∣bove once in a year." This information pleased me, you may be sure, my dear Celia, for I wish not to be often in company with Kingly. However, I did not express my satis∣faction, and Mrs. Kingly continued. "Even when I do visit Mrs. Rooksby, I take an op∣portunity when Mr. Kingly is from home: for he has such an in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cible aversion to her son, that he will never, if he can possibly
<PB N="149" REF="029439_0324_0FE116120540E110"/>
avoid it, spend an hour in his company." "Does Mr. Rooksby live with his mother?" said I.</P>
<P>"Not in general, but in the summer season he frequently makes her a visit of some months continuance, especially if his finances run short. Clement," continued she, "is not a bad hearted lad, but he is thoughtless and extravagant; and what offends Mr. Kingly so highly is, he has an intrigue with a woman supposed to be married. Her in∣fluence over him is astonishing, and her ex∣travagance knows no bounds; the connecti∣on, I believe, has been of long duration; but he has not publicly avowed it till within these two months. Business for his mother took him to the continent, and when he re∣turned she accompanied him." "It is a great pity," said I. But at that moment hearing Kingly's voice in the hall, I arose to take my leave; and as he entered the room I left it.</P>
<P>To-morrow, my dear Celia, I take leave of the amiable, friendly Amelia, and her worthy mother, and enter into Mrs. Rooks∣by's family. I am happy to find her son is not much at home, as I have met with so many vexations from the unmeaning assidu∣ities of the men, that I wish to avoid as much
<PB N="150" REF="029439_0325_0FE1161839DF5E60"/>
as possible all intercourse with the sex: for except Kingly, I can hardly believe there is a good one in the world. There was another, Celia, but he is now no more. Dear shade of the benevolent, disinterested Welldon, if from thy blissful abode thou couldst, now look down, and behold the heart thy virtue snatched from ruin, thou wouldst see it over∣flowing with such grateful remembrance, such veneration and affection, as nothing but the hand of death can extinguish. Adieu! my dear Celia, I will write again when I can tell you how I like my situation.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIX. MERIEL to CELIA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>London,</HI> <DATE><HI>April</HI> 20<HI>th,</HI> 1781.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE now been in this family nearly a month, and feel myself as happy as you can imagine, by contrasting my present with my late friendless and desolate condition. Mrs. Rooksby has seen a good deal of com∣pany since I have been with her, and goes frequently into public. I find, my dear Ce∣lia, that sensibility is not always an object of ridicule; for Mrs. Rooksby and Mrs. Kingly can shed tears at a tragedy without endea∣vouring to conceal, or blush for their weak∣ness. I have received several very genteel presents from the last mentioned lady, and whenever her aunt spends a day with her in Golden-Square, I take that opportunity to visit Miss Sidney, and so avoid a meeting which I am sensible cannot be very desirable to any of the parties.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="029439_0327_0FE11621C9288F08"/>
I have not as yet seen Mr. Rooksby, but this evening his mother has a rout previous to her leaving town, and she informs me he will certainly be their. The good old lady pathetically laments her sons unfortunate attachment, says, she is certain, from good information, that he is the dupe of an artful designing woman. "She has caught him in her deep laid snare," said she, "and he holds himself bound to her by gratitude and honour; for I am convinced real affection had little or no share in first forming the connection. He first became acquainted with her at Oxford, where she passed for the wife of an old counsellor. Her form, I am told, is very lovely, and it could not be sup∣posed that a lad of nineteen, should repulse, or fly the advances of a beautiful accomplish∣ed woman. When he came to town she left her husband and two lovely children, and followed him, when a lodging was taking for her a few miles from London. When he went to the continent she met him at Dover, and insisted on going with him, and during their journey, the infatuated boy consented to her returning and living pub∣licly with him in a house he has taken for the purpose."</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="029439_0328_0FE116282DA2F7D8"/>
"He has been acquainted with her some years, then," said I. "It is above three years," she replied, "since he first saw her."</P>
<P>It is really a sad thing, my dear Celia, that an abandoned woman should prey upon the fortune and destroy the peace of this young man: yet if the tears and intreaties of a fond mother cannot break the fatal charm that holds him, sure every other ef∣fort will be ineffectual. But now my friend, I must throw aside my pen, and be fine lady enough to declare it is for the purpose of dressing, I begin to wish we were in the country, I am already sick of parade, shew and farce; for really a fashionable life is nothing better. How tiresome to be plagued with the civil howdye's of fifty women, who are immensely happy to hear you are well, and would say, with the same <HI>sang-froid,</HI> they were immensely sorry if they were told you were dead. Oh what a miserable figure I should make in the <HI>beau monde.</HI></P>
<P>21<HI>st.</HI></P>
<P>Really this Mr. Rooksby is a very tolera∣ble being, and if I did not begin to fear he may be the cause of future vexation to me I should like to pass an hour or two in his company, now and then well enough. This morning at breakfast Mrs. Rooksby said
<PB N="154" REF="029439_0329_0FE1162DA3CC94D0"/>
"how happy my dear Miss Howard, should I be, if your charms and engaging qualities were to draw Clement from his unhappy en∣gagement; I have indulged the most pleasing hopes from some expressions of admiration and surprise, which broke from him on be∣ing introduced to you last night." "They were merely words of course, madam," said I, smiling, "when he knew I was honoured with your approbation, he could not be so wanting in politeness as to express any dislike." "But what will you say my dear," she replied, "when I tell you he has absolutely engaged himself to dine with me to day, a favour he has not vouchsafed above twice since I came to town." "We will hope, madam, he is returning to a proper sense of his duty."</P>
<P>"Ah! Meriel, I wish he may entertain a proper sense of your merit; how happy should I be in such a daughter; how certain would he be of happiness, if blessed with such a wife." "Dear madam, you over power me; you over rate my merits, and indeed I feel it is impossible I should ever love any man sufficient to become his wife." "Come," said she, "be candid, you can∣not forget Kingly." "Indeed, madam, if I know my own heart, it never yet harboured an improper wish; I esteem both Mr. and
<PB N="155" REF="029439_0330_0FE11632659AE848"/>
Mrs. Kingly, but I should be extremely sor∣ry to see any misfortune dissolve their union, but let us drop the subject, I wish to remain single; let me only enjoy your friendship my dear madam, and I shall be the happiest creature on earth."</P>
<P>At dinner time Mr. Rooksby arrived. I endeavoured to be unembarrassed in my manner, but after what had passed in the morning it was impossible. He was atten∣tively polite; but I saw his dear mother watch every look, and smile approbation, whenever any thing escaped him that could be construed into tenderness. She pressed me to play and sing: some little drawings too, which she has honoured by hanging in the drawing-room, were submitted to his inspection. "They are vastly well execut∣ed," said he. "Clara draws very prettily." "I hope," said his mother, "you do not make comparisons." "Assuredly I do," he replied hastily, "but every comparison must only convince me of Miss Howard's evident superiority, not only in every virtue, but in every accomplishment." I hope, my dear Celia, this young man will not take it into his head to fancy himself in love with me. I never can like him; besides, I am deter∣mined never to marry. Adieu, my dear

<P>THIS is a charming romantic place, my dear Celia. There is room for solitude and deep reflection. Oak-hall is situated in a very retired part of the country, and has been the family mansion of the Rooksby's from time immemorial. The house is an∣tique, and inspires one's mind with the true spirit of the days of chivalry. You cannot think, how often I amuse myself with sur∣veying
<PB N="4" REF="029439_0334_0FE11641F73E9018"/>
its antique battlements, the massy gates, and deep moat, that surround it; and while I gaze with a kind of reverential awe, I fancy, I am perhaps retracing the steps of many a gallant knight and beauteous dame who formerly have been inhabitants of this ancient dwelling. I am a great ad∣mirer of every thing, that wears the face of antiquity not that I would, were I possessed of ever so large a fortune, lay out my money in purchasing a heap of trumpery, that are really of no intrinsic value, only as the fancy of the virtuoso stamps them with the appel∣lation of excellence, because they were made some hundred years before we were born. I cannot deny, that I like to examine any little piece of antiquity, which tends to shew us the progress of the arts or manufactures, and when I enjoy the benefit of any thing useful or convenient I feel a kind of vene∣ration for the genius, who first invented it, let it be ever so mean or trifling.</P>
<P><HI>May,</HI> 20<HI>th.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Rooksby arrived yesterday and has this morning, not to my surprize, but to my infinite regret, made me an offer of his hand and fortune. It is not, my dear Celia, that I am stoic enough to pretend, I have an aversion to being raised from a state of de∣pendence
<PB N="5" REF="029439_0335_0FE1164723B0B800"/>
to be mistress of seven thousand pounds a year: but I feel, I shall never re∣gard Mr. Rooksby with the affection, which, in my opinion, is absolutely necessary, to make the married state comfortable, though Mrs. Rooksby tells me, that in this I am mistaken, as she was perfectly happy while her husband lived; and yet she declares she acceded to the union merely in compliance with the desires of her parents. It may be so, Celia, but I am certain I should never be happy with a man, whom I regard with indifference. But I will give you an account of a conversation, I had this morning with this invader of my peace (I must call him so, for had it not been for him I should have felt myself quite happy in my present situa∣tion.) We had just finished breakfast, when a servant informed Mrs. Rooksby a poor woman desired to speak with her. The good old lady is benevolent and humane to all her poor neighbours, and the honest industrious when oppressed by misfortune are always sure of meeting a friend in her.</P>
<P>I had not been alone with Mr. Rooksby before, since my residence in the family and to tell you the truth, I would gladly have walked ten miles to have avoided it now. But there was no flying; politeness obliged me to sit still; besides I thought it would
<PB N="6" REF="029439_0336_0FE1164B0546F7A8"/>
look so like being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the man, so childish to run away as soon as his mother left the room—that I sat very composedly and took up my work, which opportunely was in the room.—We were silent near ten minutes, when at length he spoke.</P>
<P>"May I venture to enquire how Miss Howard likes the situation of my mother's house?"</P>
<P>"I think it extremely pleasant, sir. It suits the turn of my mind; I am fond of solitude and should be quite happy were I certain of never wandering from this de∣lightful spot, to the gay regions of fashion, folly, and what is in general termed pleasure."</P>
<P>"How blind are you to your own merits, my dear Miss, if you wish thus to hide in obscurity, beauty and virtue, that would do honour to a court."</P>
<P>"You make me smile, Mr. Rooksby, how would your gay companions ridicule you could they hear you thus lavishly compli∣menting an humble dependant of your mo∣ther's."</P>
<P>"And let them laugh, my dear Miss. Howard, for did they know as I do the true
<PB N="7" REF="029439_0337_0FE116512BC86F60"/>
value of your worth, they would like me, adore it."</P>
<P>"This, my dear Celia, was not to be an∣swered: so I was obliged to be content with remaining silent and looking like an idiot." While he continued, "I am fully sensible of my own unworthiness of presuming to be∣come a candidate for Miss Howard's favour. I know how full of error my short career of life has been; but I trust your benevolent spirit will pardon my past follies; and could I presume to hope you would condescend to accept my hand and fortune, I am certain by a constant contemplation of the good∣ness it would strive to immitate, my heart would soon be an offering worthy of your acceptance."</P>
<P>Dear Celia, how extremely embarrassing was my situation? I felt my face glow. I dared not look up: at length I summoned sufficient courage to speak.</P>
<P>"I hardly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sir, in what manner to reply. If the offer you have just made be seriously meant."</P>
<P>"If it be serious, Miss Howard, can you suppose I would trifle on so important a subject, with any woman, much more with
<PB N="8" REF="029439_0338_0FE116561EAD8BD0"/>
one so truly amiable as yourself. Believe me, my charming girl, there is no event could render me so happy, or convey such unmixed felicity to the bosom of my mother, as to see you become a part of a family which may derive honour from, but can confer none by the alliance."</P>
<P>"Your polite and generous proposal, sir, demands a candid answer. I feel myself in∣finitely obliged by the regard with which you are pleased to honour me; at the same time I am under the necessity of declining your offer. I hope you will believe I am not ungrateful for the esteem and friendship I have fortunately met with in your mother's family, and permit me to add, I shall always regard her as an affectionate parent and you as a brother: but as to any nearer tie, it never can take place between us."</P>
<P>"Never, Miss Howard. Do not say ne∣ver—Time and constant assiduity will I hope influence your heart in my favour: for without that sweet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> must be misera∣ble."</P>
<P>"Indeed, Mr. Rooksby I cannot flatter you. It is at present my fixed determina∣tion, never to alter my condition: but were that not the case"—</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="029439_0339_0FE1165C0AE696A0"/>
"Your choice would not fall on me. I am satisfied—Some more happy man."</P>
<P>"Pardon me, you are in an error. I am indifferent to all the sex."</P>
<P>"Then why not allow me to strive to awaken the sensibility of your heart. Be∣lieve me your happiness should be the whole study of my life."</P>
<P>"Mr. Rooksby, I will be explicit. Were I ever so partial to your virtues, I could not overlook one glaring error in your conduct, an error which not only tarnishes your own reputation, but preys upon your mother's peace of mind."</P>
<P>"You mean my connection with Clara."</P>
<P>"I do."</P>
<P>"Will you permit me, Miss Howard, to enter into a little detail of my conduct through the whole of this unhappy connec∣tion. Unhappy! I must always call it, not only from the reasons you have just alledged, but because I foresee my want of fortitude has involved an amiable woman in infamy and ruin; for had I repulsed the first over∣tures of the unhappy Clara's passion, affront∣ed
<PB N="10" REF="029439_0340_0FE116615F2FDF18"/>
pride would have assisted in combating her attachment, and she might at this mo∣ment have been happy in the esteem and love of her husband and family. I have often wished to explain this affair to my mother and engage her friendship in behalf of Clara, but whenever I attempt to speak, she brands the poor girl with the epithets of artful, vile, enticing siren. Alas, Miss Howard, the un∣fortunate Clara's greatest error is, a too tender attachment to me."</P>
<P>Ah man! man! said I mentally, how easily does thy vanity, dupe thy reason,—Mr. Rooksby continued—</P>
<P>"It may appear old, that I should wish to enter upon this subject to you, but I am certain you will judge with candour and represent Clara to my mother in such a light as may lead her to befriend a woman, who has sacrificed fame, happiness, and honour to me. You will ask, perhaps, why I do not marry her, as her husband is lately dead, I would answer, that she is not a woman calculated to make me happy. Her temper is impetuous, and though her form is lovely and she has received a polished education, she possesses not that true feminine softness and delicacy which in my opinion alone can render a woman really amiable. My ac∣quaintance
<PB N="11" REF="029439_0341_0FE11666DA6BBF88"/>
with her commenced about four years since, while I was completing my stu∣dies at Oxford. At that time her husband Mr. Millar was a counsellor residing at that city. He invited me frequently to his house. I saw Mrs. Millar, and admired her as a lovely accomplished woman; nay more, I pitied her, for I saw she was not happy. Her sister, Miss Ramsay, who resided in the house wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h her, to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> me, their father had been a lieutenant in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> navy: but age and infirmities obliging him to retire upon his half pay, they found their circumstances greatly straitened. At this time, Mr. Mil∣lar paid their father a visit. He was struck with the beauty and innocence of Clara, and though at that time near fifty years old, he had the vanity to think he could render himself agreeable to a girl of seventeen."</P>
<P>"Perhaps," said I, "it was a benevolent wish to lighten the expences of his friend and place the young lady in a state of in∣dependence which urged him to make the offer of his hand."</P>
<P>It might be so, she replied, but what∣ever his motives might be, gratitude and filial love incited Clara to accept the offer, and sacrifice herself to the man she disliked; to secure ease and affluence to her father
<PB N="12" REF="029439_0342_0FE1166C7A2D6EC0"/>
and sister: but he lived not long to enjoy the fruits of her kindness. A slow decline carried him off about a year after his daugh∣ter's marriage. At this time I was intro∣duced into Mr. Millar's family. Clara was just become a mother; her husband seemed to idolize her; she could not breathe a wish which was not instantly gratified. Yet she was far from happy, and I often saw her turn aside to conceal tears, which seemed to flow from an oppressed heart. One afternoon, Mr. Millar was from home, her sister sitting at the other end of the room reading. Clara rose from her seat on pretence of reaching something from the chimney piece, and stooping, picked up a paper which she pre∣sented to me, saying, you drop your letters about very carelessly. I took the paper and perceived it was a sealed letter. I will not shock your delicacy, Miss Howard, by re∣peating the contents of this letter. I can perceive by your countenance, that you think it a sufficient error for a married wo∣man to entertain an inclination for any other man than her husband without daring to avow her passion. I am sensible, Clara acted with imprudence; but who can answer for the emotions of a heart, under the influence of its first tender attachment? And however culpable, she might be, I think myself more so. I should have never more entered Mr.
<PB N="13" REF="029439_0343_0FE116722B6AB348"/>
Millar's house, when I found how detrimen∣tal my presence was, both to his honour and happiness. I should have avoided the so∣ciety of the fair seducer, and confined my∣self more than ever to my studies. I am conscious this should have been my conduct; but, alas! it was quite the reverse. I sought every opportunity of being in her company. I encouraged her growing tenderness. Pri∣vate enterviews ensued, and honour, grati∣tude, and friendship were all forgotten. Though our entercourse continued, during the whole time I remained at Oxford, Mr. Millar never suspected his injuries. The sister was in our confidence, and she always contrived our meetings in such a manner, that they appeared the effect of chance. Just before I left Oxford, Clara was con∣fined with her second child. This prevent∣ed my taking a personal leave. I wrote, in∣forming her of the necessity of my removal, assured her of my grateful affection and that I would take frequent opportunities of visit∣ing her in future. This I said, merely to quiet her anxiety; for reason had began to operate; the mist of passion was dissipated and I was determined to put an end to a con∣nection, at once so dishonourable and unjust. I chose to take the opportunity of her con∣finement for my departure, as I knew how ill I could support taking a personal leave,
<PB N="14" REF="029439_0344_0FE1167646A35F10"/>
where tears, faintings, and hysterics would effectually unbend my best resolutions. I therefore entrusted my letter to the sister, without informing her of the contents, and set forward immediately for London. I had not been in town above a fortnight, when one morning, as I sat at breakfast, I heard a chaise stop at the door, and in a moment Clara rushed into the parlour where I was sitting.</P>
<P>Good God," said I, "Mrs. Millar what has brought you to town."—"What," she replied, "what but your cruel desertion of me. Unkind, ungenerous Rooksby, did you think I would live separated from you."—"My dear Clara,," said I, "consider how your reputation will suffer when this rash step is known"—" What is reputation to me," cried she, "if I am deprived of your love I lose all that can make life valuable."—"Where are your children, Clara,"—"I left them too, for your sake, Rooksby; and is this cold, unkind reception all the return I am likely to meet."—"You call me cold, and unkind; but believe me, you wrong me, I feel all, nay much more than I ought for you, but I am very sorry to find you have so little regard for yourself as thus to incur the censure of the world by follow∣ing a man who has it not in his power to
<PB N="15" REF="029439_0345_0FE1167C32114E78"/>
offer you an honorable protection."—" You throw me from you, then. You will not receive me" (cried she, starting up, and wildly clasping her hands,) Oh Rooksby this is more than I can bear—I am bursting—My heart is swollen so large; it choaks me.—" Be calm, I beseech you, my dear Clara, I do not refuse to receive you; no, my poor girl, I feel myself bound to protect you; for I know it was I first drew you from your duty; but I am sensible, how little recom∣pence it is in my power to make for the many comforts and blessings I have robbed you of." "Oh Rooksby," said she, "let me enjoy your society, and be blessed with your love, and I shall not regret any sacrifice I have made."</P>
<P>What could I do, Miss Howard, conti∣nued Mr. Rooksby.—There was but one way. I offered to take her a house a little way out of town and visit her occasionally. She acceded to the proposal and changed her name. Soon after her sister came to town, and with her brought the two children, whom she said Mr. Millar had in his resentment turned out of doors.—I now considered my∣self as bound to provide for these unfortunate children; but I had no idea of making my∣self a resident in the same house with their mother. But when I went over to France
<PB N="16" REF="029439_0346_0FE116815E4B7288"/>
this last autumn, she followed me, and with such earnestness declared she would sooner die than be separated from me for one week, that I was unable to refuse the request she made to accompany me abroad. While we were on the continent we heard from her sister, that Mr. Millar was dead.—From that time, Clara earnestly pressed me to marry her; but I told her not to form any such vain expectation, as that was an event, which never could take place; however I promised always to be her friend, and in consideration of her then evident pregnancy, consented that on our return to England, I would take a house in London and reside with her.—Alas! my dear young lady, I knew not what inconveniencies I was bringing upon myself:—Her expences far outran the annual sum I had allotted her; she is never happy but when I am with her, and even when I devote almost my whole time to her, she is peevish, dissatisfied and constantly complaining of my altered carriage towards her. Alas, I know I am changed; but I am also certain I never failed in tender solicitude, and attention to her welfare. I never did love her. Vanity, gra∣titude, and the wild impulses of youth have been mistaken for that passion. I am now con∣vinced of my error. My heart now vibrates with a true and ardent affection. I will never suffer Clara to know want; but the future
<PB N="17" REF="029439_0347_0FE11686B43E5FD8"/>
happiness or misery of my life must depend entirely upon Miss Howard.</P>
<P>I had listened attentively, during this re∣cital. I found much to blame in Clara. In∣deed, they had both been guilty of errors of such magnitude, that in my opinion they deserved the appellation of crimes: but it was not for me to condemn. I knew from fatal experience, how imprudent were the dictates of a youthful heart. And though I felt a secret horror at the recital of Rooks∣by's cruel perfidy, to his kind, unsuspecting friend Mr. Millar, yet he appeared innocent in comparison with Clara. Her husband loved her almost to adoration; he had raised her from poverty to affluence; he had chear∣ed the last hours of her father, and offered an assylum to her orphan sister. He was the father of her children, Celia. Yet could she ungratefully betray the honour he had confided to her care; forsake this kind, in∣dulgent husband, desert her innocent chil∣dren, in that helpless state, when they require all a mother's fond solicitude and anxious maternal care.—And for this inhuman con∣duct she pleads love. Celia! real love ne∣ver yet incited its votaries to base or disho∣nourable actions. I am certain, I never could like Clara. She appears to me an artful designing woman, and from Rooks∣by's
<PB N="18" REF="029439_0348_0FE1168C0C2413F8"/>
account, I think, interest has been the main spring of her actions. Indeed, that alone urged her to follow him; for had she regarded him with real affection, she would have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from the idea of becoming a burthen to him: and do not, my dear Celia, think I am turning rigidly censorious, if I say, I suspect she was not really the wife of Mr. Millar; though that takes but little from her guilt, as she certainly had received many tokens of affection from him, and had been received and respected as his wife by all the families who lived in their neighbourhood. All these reflections had passed rapidly thro' my mind, while Mr. Rooksby was speaking. When he paused, I found myself necessitated to answer.</P>
<P>"You say, sir, your heart is very deceit∣ful: it has once betrayed you into actions and connections you now heartily repent. May it not do so again. Trust not to its impulse: call in the aid of reason and re∣flection, and you will find your present in∣clination will prove as great a delusion as the former."</P>
<P>"Impossible!" he replied, vehemently, "impossible, I can never alter my opinion in regard to Miss Howard."</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="029439_0349_0FE11691729F2EC8"/>
"And believe me, sir," said I, gravely, "it is equally impossible I can ever alter mine in regard to you."</P>
<P>I then attempted to leave the room; but he caught my hand. "Stay, my dear girl, only one moment; let me intreat you, only to recall that cruel word never. Give me but the most distant ray of hope and I will endeavor to be satisfied."—" Well, Sir," said I smiling, "if you remain of the same opinion you are now, forty years hence, I will talk with you further on the subject." He released my hand and turned from me in sullen silence. I embraced the opportu∣nity, and immediately quitted the apart∣ment. But here was a fresh scene of perse∣cution to encounter. Mrs. Rooksby met me, as I went across the hall, and taking hold of my arm, we walked into the garden. "I see, my dear Meriel," said she, "you are not pleased; poor Clement has little to hope: but come tell me, have you given him a positive refusal?"—My dear Madam, you already know my sentiments on that subject, I have no inclination for matrimony, I wish to remain single; for I am certain I should never have patience sufficient to submit to all the whims and caprices of those lords of the creation. "I am afraid Meriel, you deceive yourself, and that under the idea of
<PB N="20" REF="029439_0350_0FE116970608F3D0"/>
a disinclination for marriage, you nourish a hopeless and destructive passion. I know my dear girl how nobly you have conducted yourself in regard to Mr. Kingly. My niece has informed me of the whole: but my good girl, while you are thus studiously promoting the happiness of others, why neglect your own, why sacrifice the bloom and spring of life to a passion, which however well placed, is now no longer innocent."</P>
<P>"Oh! Madam," I replied, "do not sus∣pect me of cherishing so improper a desire; can I not be suffered to pass quietly through the remainder of my life, without forming any other connection than friendship? Why must I be obliged to undertake duties I am so very unable to perform? Or why do you wish a heart long since dead to pleasure, from whom every tender tie is now severed, to have its sensibility again awakened, to have new affections; to make it again fond of life, only perhaps to experience again the acute pangs of losing the beloved objects that had called those affections forth?"—" My dear Meriel, you must not argue thus; we are all born to encounter trouble."—" Alas! Madam, my share has already been almost beyond my weak power to support; for from the day in which I left the Convent till the present, I have not experienced one so
<PB N="21" REF="029439_0351_0FE1169C6B5AFBD8"/>
happy that I could wish it to return, yet heaven knows I do not complain; but I wish not to engage in new scenes."</P>
<P>"You must consider, Miss Howard, it is not for us to mark out the path we wish to tread, and cry I will not deviate from it. We are not sent into the world to pass thro' it in indolence. Remember my love that life which is not in some measure serviceable to our fellow-creatures, is not acceptable to our Creator. You in particular are sent in∣to the world, endowed with abilities to shine in the respective characters of Wife, Mother, and the mistress of a family, and will you be the unprofitable servant and hide those talents intrusted to your care, for the com∣fort of your friends and the benefit of man∣kind in general"—</P>
<P>"But Clara, madam, I hope you will allow that is an obstacle?"—" It is only so in your opinion: To me it is the great mo∣tive of my earnest wish to see Clement unit∣ed to you—Clara shall be amply provided for"—</P>
<P>"And her child?"—" We will take it home, should it be born alive, and I will see it shall be properly educated and a handsome provision made for its future support. Now
<PB N="22" REF="029439_0352_0FE116A09D791EC8"/>
my dear Meriel, I think all your objections are removed." "You must, dear madam, give me time for consideration, before I can determine on so important a subject."</P>
<P>"You shall not be hurried, my love, on∣ly let me have your leave to bid Clement hope."</P>
<P>"Oh! do not I beseech you, raise falla∣cious hopes. It may not be in my power to realize them."—" Well then," said she, "I will remain silent, till I have your leave to speak." She then turned into another walk and I returned to the house.—" And, now my dear Celia, how would you advise me to act. I fear, turn which way I will, I am still in an error. Ah! my sweet friend, I cannot teach this stubborn heart indiffer∣ence toward Kingly, and sure I am, whilst I remain single, my partiality will be ever the same. Should I marry, other ties and the important duties of my station will call my mind from this dangerous object: But then to give my hand and vow obedience to a man, whom my heart refuses to love, is certainly an error; and what is worse, the irrevocable words, once past, there will be no flying from my fate, however repug∣nant it may be to my feelings. I will write to my dear Amelia on the subject; alio to
<PB N="23" REF="029439_0353_0FE116A6B2DA0D18"/>
to Mrs. Kingly. Their opinions shall de∣cide my fate. Yet, my dear Celia, believe me, my soul shrinks from an union with Rooksby. I know not why, but whenever I think of it, a cold chill runs through my veins, and my heart sinks within me: but I am grown strangely fanciful of late. I am greatly altered since we-parted. Me∣thinks, I am but the shadow of my former self, the serenity of temper I once boasted to enjoy is entirely lost, and I am like a frow∣ard child. Adieu, I am changed in every thing but friendship to you.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Plymouth,</HI> <DATE><HI>June</HI> 4<HI>th,</HI> 1781.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU tell me, my dear Miss Howard, that my cousin has, to your surprize, declared a passion for you: it is your diffi∣dence alone occasions that surprize, as I foresaw it was a circumstance that would certainly follow your residing in the fami∣ly: but, though my lovely friend, I should greatly rejoice to rank you in the number of my relations, I would by no means de∣sire that gratification, if it is to be purchased at the expence of your peace of mind.—Clement has, it is true, an independent for∣tune; but his mind is not formed for the approbation of one so delicate as yours. I should be pleased to see you raised to a sta∣tion you was formed to adorn; but I can∣not avoid the remembrance of your gentle∣ness of spirit which seeks not in grandeur for content. Oh! my dear Meriel, I know there never was but one man worthy of
<PB N="26" REF="029439_0356_0FE116B2FAB943A0"/>
your affection, and I have stepped between you and happiness.</P>
<P>I informed Mr. Kingly, as you desired, of my cousin's offer. "Her mind," said he, "must be strangely altered, if she can find the least congenial particle in his; but she is altogether an inexplicable riddle." Vexed to hear him speak so slightingly, I was al∣most tempted to betray my trust and tell him how vilely you had slandered yourself, but shall I confess the truth, self-love pre∣vailed. I could not bear to think he might perhaps be angry at my long concealment; and much as I esteem and venerate my dear Miss Howard, I could not consent he should love even her, better than me. I will not give my opinion concerning your future conduct; though you condescend to ask it. Of this I am satisfied, whatever your own good sense shall resolve upon, that will un∣doubtedly be right. Accept my best wishes for your happiness and prosperity, and be∣live you have not a sincerer friend than</P>

<P>AND so my little sentimental Meriel is really and seriously deliberating, whe∣ther she shall accept a man with seven thou∣sand a year, shine forth in all the magnifi∣cence of bridal finery, or remaining a chaste vestal, breathing pure vows to the consecra∣ted flame of her first love, continue in a state of dependence to the end of her life. I charge you, Miss Howard, deliberate no longer. Make haste and send us some wed∣ding favours, and next winter, let me have the pleasure of pointing out your elegant equipage, as it passes my window, to some of my inquisitive acquaintance, and saying, "that is my friend Mrs. Rooksby's carriage. Then how shall I exult to receive a curtesy from a side box when you are as fine as hands can make you, and poor humble me as plain as possible, sit almost opposite you

in the pit. In the pit you say, bless me Amelia, I should blush to death to be thought to know any one in the pit. Pardon me, dear Meriel, I know your good little heart so well, I am certain the friend you esteem∣ed would always be recognized while she continued deserving of your notice, though poverty and distress were strongly marked by her appearance. And now to be serious concerning your letter, Mr. Rooksby ap∣pears to me a weak young man; but there seems great goodness of heart in him and I think it would be a charitable action to snatch him from ruin.—for inevetable ruin must follow his connection with Clara. I am informed her stile of living is the most extravagant immaginable, and such splen∣did preparations are making for her <HI>accouch∣ment,</HI> that you would think her a dutchess of the first rank. And now I am speaking of charitable actions, let me represent to my friend the many aching hearts it will be in her power to relieve when she is mistress of such an ample fortune, as Mr. Rooksby of∣fers to her acceptance. And again, my love, consider what a relief it will be to the generous Mrs. Kingly to see you so well set∣tled. Even Kingly himself will be happier when you are married, for trust me while you remain single he will nourish the idea that your partiality for him is the occasion
<PB N="29" REF="029439_0359_0FE116C1A56CCF80"/>
of your preferring a state of celibacy.—That you will be happier in yourself, I am well convinced. New scenes will open to your imagination, past sorrows will be for∣gotten and the afflictions of the daughter shall be amply repaid by the felicity of the mother. Ah! my dear Meriel, you must marry, if it be only to experience the su∣perlative happiness of having a daughter, whose soul shall be the exact model of your own. Methinks too, my friend, you will feel your bosom dilate with pleasure, when you can call Mrs. Rooksby by the endearing name of mother. A heart like yours, so formed for all the endearing ties of life when deprived of its natural relation, seeks some one on whom to rest its affection. Accept then my dear girl, the offered good that awaits you, let your heart expand to receive all those delightful sensations which result from a felicitous matrimonial union, and while you are alternately addressed by the endearing titles of mother and daughter; while the man whom you shall bless with your hand, reveres, admires, adores you, the disappointments of your youth shall be no more remembered, except it is with a kind of smiling wonder at their ever having made you uneasy. My mother bids me tell you she wishes you may be as truly happy

<HEAD>MERIEL to CELIA. IN CONTINUATION.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I had read these letters, my mind still wavering and irresolute, I repaired to Mrs. Rooksby's dressing room. I found her weeping. "Meriel," said she, as I entered, "you are come in good time to comfort me. Clement has just been with me. He leaves us to-morrow."</P>
<P>"To-morrow, Madam, that is much sooner than he at first intended."</P>
<P>"Yes, Meriel, and he leaves us with an intention that almost deprives me of reason."</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="029439_0361_0FE116CC58A2E668"/>
"You surprize me, what intention can he have formed, that gives you so much anxiety."</P>
<P>"He is determined to marry Clara im∣mediately on his arrival in London, that his child may be legetimated."</P>
<P>"Marry Clara," said I, with an emotion of astonishment.</P>
<P>"It is even so my dear; he just now told me he found it was in vain to hope any thing from you, and being deprived of the hope of your affection he knew love could have no part in any other union, he was determined that the claims of honour should be attended to, and his innocent child have not future cause to curse the au∣thor of its being, since that being would, if he did not marry Clara, inherit infamy as its birth-right."</P>
<P>"I cannot think," I replied, "that ho∣nour by any means obliges him to marry that woman. She certainly forfeited all claim to an honourable protector, when she fled from Mr. Millar. I wish she was well pro∣vided for, and far from Mr. Rooksby, for I am cartain that inevitable misery and ruin must ensue from a continuation of his pre∣sent
<PB N="32" REF="029439_0362_0FE116D01A11A908"/>
connection with her. What then would bethe consequence of an indissoluble union? I tremble to think of it."</P>
<P>"You will see him, Miss Howard, before he leaves Oak-hall. Let me beg of you, my dear girl, to exert all your eloquence, to persuade him from so fatal a step. Give some hope, even if it should be but falla∣cious, and I make no doubt, but we shall retain him with us a little time longer, and who knows what time may do."</P>
<P>"I cannot deceive any person, my dear madam. If I am tempted to hold out hope to draw your son from this destructive resolu∣tion, be assured, I shall one day mean to realize them."—" Blessings on you my sweet Meriel, you will then relent; I shall have the happiness of seeing my son preserved from ruin, and obtain a daughter who must be admired and esteemed by all, who are so happy as to know her."</P>
<P>"I did not absolutely say so, madam. I will see Mr. Rooksby previous to his intend∣ed departure. I will use every argument in my power to prevail with him to give up his design in regard to Clara; if I find every other argument ineffectual, I will promise some future day to give him my hand. But
<PB N="33" REF="029439_0363_0FE116D553E8E0C8"/>
let me request my dear friendly Mrs. Rooksby to attribute this resolution to its proper cause. I will not deceive your son with professions of affection which I do not feel. I have re∣ceived many favours from you and your amiable niece Mrs. Kingly, and I think it will be to your mutual satisfaction, to see me married. I am sensible, it is a duty also which I owe myself, as, whilst I continue single, I shall always be suspected of nou∣rishing an improper affection for Mr. Kingly, and as it is my earnest wish to preserve my own reputation unsullied and to promote as much as possible the happiness of others, I will unite myself to Mr. Rooksby, but alas, I have nothing to offer in return for his ge∣nerous affection but esteem and friendship."</P>
<P>"Enough my love," cried Mrs. Rooksby embracing me, "I have no doubt of Cle∣ment's happiness, when blest with the es∣teem of so amiable a companion."</P>
<P>At dinner we all met as usual. Mr. Rooks∣by was in his travelling dress. "Are you for riding this afternoon, sir," said I—" I think of setting forward for London, Miss Howard, I have an affair of infinite consequence to transact there, and I fear delays may be dan∣gerous."—" You must not leave us to-night, however, Clement," said his mother smiling.
<PB N="34" REF="029439_0364_0FE116D94A7C0178"/>
—" I did not understand you intended leav∣ing Oak-hall till to-morrow," said I.—" I would willingly stay here forever," he replied, "but I am sensible my presence is detrimen∣tal to the tranquility of one whose happiness I would promote at the hazard of my life."—This was a compliment, my dear Celia, which I could not take entirely to myself, as he might have meant Clara's happiness was disturbed by his remaining at Oak-hall, I therefore remained silent, and little more was said, till the cloth was removed. I then arose to leave the room with Mrs. Rooksby, who generally retires to her dressing room after dinner, and as is often the case with elderly people, indulges herself with a nap. As I arose Mr. Rooksby took my hand. "Permit me, Miss Howard, before I take my leave to request the honour of a few minutes conversation." I curtefied assent and re∣assumed my seat; he continued.</P>
<P>"It is with infinite regret, my dear young lady, that I leave this place, as by so doing I relinquish every hope, which I had fondly cherished of obtaining an interest in your bosom. I see my presence is painful to you, it encroaches on that tranquillity you would otherwise enjoy, in a place so agree∣able to your disposition. I hope you will believe, your happiness is an object of far
<PB N="35" REF="029439_0365_0FE116DF27D2EE58"/>
greater moment to me than my own. I go from hence with a fixed resolution to repair the injuries I have done Clara; but to con∣vince you how near your interest is and ever will be to my heart, I must beg you will consider yourself from this moment indepen∣dent. In this (presenting me a small box) you will find a writing, which conveys to you and yours for ever an estate worth two hundred pounds a year, situated in Glamorganshire. I will not be either inter∣rupted or contradicted (seeing I was about to speak.) You must accept this as from a brother, who though his own future days will have scarce a dawn of pleasure to en∣liven them, will always have the comfort of reflecting the most amiable woman in the world will be no more reduced to situa∣tions at once so unworthy her merits, and painful to her feelings."</P>
<P>Overcome by this generous conduct I was unable to speak. Tears involuntarily burst from my eyes and seeing him about to leave the room, almost unknowing what I did, I caught his hand to detain him.—</P>
<P>"Do not distress me, my dear Miss How∣ard, said he, those tears are too precious to be shed on such a trivial occasion."</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="029439_0366_0FE116E300EF0768"/>
"Trivial," said I, "Oh! Mr. Rooksby, I cannot accept this noble donation. It op∣presses me beyond measure. I have no way of discharging the vast debt of gratitude."</P>
<P>"My sweet girl," said he, kissing my hand. "Remember me ever with a friend∣ly affection and I shall think myself a thou∣sand times repaid."</P>
<P>"I cannot take it, sir, indeed I cannot. But let me prefer one request to you. Do not leave us this afternoon, remain a few days longer to oblige me."—</P>
<P>No, my dear Meriel, I see the generous drift of your design. You pity me, you wish to make me happy and to oblige my mother would sacrifice your own felicity; but, my dear friend, if I have nothing to hope from affection, I will not be indebted to gratitude or compassion.</P>
<P>"But, dear Mr. Rooksby, consider how you will distress your mother by thus pre∣cipitately giving your hand to Mrs. Millar; You must pardon me, sir, but indeed I do not think her altogether worthy such an honour."</P>
<P>"Such a severe expression from miss Howard is something extraordinary; but
<PB N="37" REF="029439_0367_0FE116E86DF332E8"/>
women (added he smiling) are not always the most candid judges of each other. You my dear Miss behold in Clara only a frail woman, who forgetful of the rigid dictates of honour and virtue sacrificed reputation, friends, every valuable consideration to an unhappy passion. I behold her as a lovely unfortunate creature, who has made those sacrifices for me. I also consider that, per∣haps, had it been her fate to be united to the man of her heart, she would at this moment have been a respectable member of society; and if I reflect, that I only am the cause, that she is not so, can I do otherwise than repair as much, as is in my power, the inju∣ries her reputation has suffered on my ac∣count."</P>
<P>"I think, Mr. Rooksby, you argue per∣fectly right, nor should I have entered on this subject, had it not been at the earnest request of your mother. She shudders at the idea of your introducing into the family a woman of light fame. She has been in∣formed that Mrs. Millar is a very faulty wo∣man in more respects than one. She wishes to have her amply provided for, but cannot endure to think she must be the wife of her darling son."</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="029439_0368_0FE116EC172BB3A0"/>
"I saw, Miss Howard, from the first that it was at my mother's desire you so chearful∣ly assented to this conversation. She knew the generosity of your disposition. She na∣turally supposed you would exert yourself to prevail with me to relinquish my design. She foresaw the generous concessions you would make in my favour: but she knows not the heart of her son, if she imagines affection like his could be satisfied with any thing less than affection in return."</P>
<P>"I am sorry, I shall be able to give no bet∣ter account of my undertaking; but, how∣ever, Mr. Rooksby, permit me to decline, this obligation (returning the writings). I am perfectly satisfied with my situation in your mother's family, and must insist on your receiving this again."</P>
<P>He refused to take it. I laid it on the table and hastily left the room.</P>
<P>So you see, my dear Celia, while I was consulting my friends whether I should ac∣cept or reject this man, he has hastily form∣ed the resolution of leaving me to wear the willow and bestowing himself on another. Seriously my friend I feel myself greatly obliged by the delicate manner in which he declined accepting a hand when he was cer∣tain
<PB N="39" REF="029439_0369_0FE116F1E2C82CC0"/>
the heart would not immediately follow, and were it not that I fear he will be ex∣tremely unhappy in an union with Clara, I should rejoice in being released from his im∣portunities. Mrs. Rooksby is in great af∣fliction. I try all I can to comfort her; but I really believe she will feel as much, when she sees her son mount his horse to leave the Hall, as she would were she attending him to the silent receptacle of his ancestors. When this dreaded wedding is over she will, I make no doubt, feel easier, and the birth of her grandchild will naturally awaken some degree of affection towards its mo∣ther.</P>
<P>You will, perhaps, my dear Celia, blame, me for so obstinately refusing Mr. Rooksby's generous present; but my dear girl I am the worst in the world to receive an obligation. It oppresses me; it sinks me to the earth, especially when I have no power to return it. While I have my health, I have no doubt of always finding a situation, where I may render myself in some measure useful, in return for my subsistence, and should sickness, age or any infirmity, to which mor∣tality is subject, overtake me, whilst I re∣main in what is generally termed an unpro∣tected state, I have still the same beneficent
<PB N="40" REF="029439_0370_0FE116F678396EC0"/>
Providence to rely on, who never yet suf∣fered me to sink under affliction.</P>

<P>WE have had fine bustling and con∣fusion I assure you, my dear Celia, since I wrote you last; and if you knew all, you would say, we are likely to have much more,—but not to go on with my intelli∣gence too fast.</P>
<P>The morning after I concluded my last, Mr. Rooksby set off for London. His mo∣ther
<PB N="41" REF="029439_0371_0FE116FC16E315C8"/>
would not take leave of him at his de∣parture, and I was obliged to consent that a correspondence should be commenced be∣tween us; for she had absolutely declared all intercourse with her must cease, from the moment he married Clara. Accordingly on the fourth day after his departure I re∣ceived a letter, informing me he had arrived too late for his purpose: for Clara had been in bed two days, and little master was as fine a boy as ever was seen, and in perfect health. Mrs. Rooksby greatly rejoiced, that any thing had happened to postpone the wedding, and flattered herself the con∣nection would by some means or other be broke off. It was near six weeks before we had any farther tidings of him, though I had answered his letter immediately. It was at the close of evening; Mrs. Rooksby was re∣clined on a sopha; for the weather was ex∣tremely hot, and I was playing on the harp∣sichord which I accompanied with my voice. The evening was remarkably still, the moon with silver crescent faintly illumined <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he sky, encreasing the beauty of the night by her presence, without eclipsing by too much radience the lesser glories of the stars. I had just begun that charming song from Milton's Penseroso.</P>
<P>"Sweet bird that shun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st the noise of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lly,"
<PB N="42" REF="029439_0372_0FE117009B539B00"/>
When we were interrupted by the sound of horses coming up the avenue, and in a few minutes Mr. Rooksby rushed into the room, pale and to all appearance worn out with fatigue. He spoke not at entering, but throwing himself into his mother's arms, burst into tears.</P>
<P>"Clement," said she, "my dear Clement what is the matter. Good God! you weep, your hands are hot. You are very ill."—"Oh! mother," he replied, "forgive me. I know it is unlike a man, but the shock I have received."—" Is Clara dead then," said she.—" Clara, did you say, Oh the si∣ren, name her not, I cannot trust myself to speak of her, she is—but come we will not talk about her."</P>
<P>"You come upon us rather unexpected," said I, advancing towards him.</P>
<P>"I came," said he, "as fast as a repeat∣ed change of horses would bring me, for I knew there was no other place, where I could find comfort. You, my dear Miss Howard will comfort me, and you will pre∣vail with my mother, to receive under her protecting roof some poor little orphans who will arrive to-morrow to claim her care."</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="029439_0373_0FE11705EBDD3F80"/>
"You are sensible, Clement, that every child of affliction is welcome to me. I will protect and serve them to the utmost of my power. How much greater then will be their claim on my humanity, when they come recommended by you."</P>
<P>"And when one of them is my child," cried he vehemently,—" my dear mother, that woman, whom I had intended to make my wife—but no matter, she is gone. She has forsaken her poor little innocents; but I will not suffer them to know want."</P>
<P>"You are not married then?"—"No"—"Thank heaven, my dear Clement, thank heaven, your honour will not suffer by this cruel desertion, and let the vile mother go, we will protect the unoffending children."</P>
<P>After supper, Mr. Rooksby was more composed. He told us, that on his arrival in London he hastened to Clara and found her as he had informed us, the mother of a fine boy and likely to do well. He told her with what intention he had hurried to town, and said, if she desired it, a special licence should be procured and the ceremony per∣formed in her own chamber. This she for∣tunately refused alledging, that, as her dis∣grace had been public, she desired the repa∣ration
<PB N="44" REF="029439_0374_0FE117095A9A4D80"/>
might be public also. To this he as∣sented and preparations were making for the public performance of the ceremony. He had presented her with a magnificent set of jewels, and with money to the amount of three thousand pounds. A day was appoint∣ed for the union: the articles, settlements, &amp;c. were all ready for signing: When the evening preceding the appointed morning he called at her house and was informed she was gone to a private ball some few miles out of town. He thought it somewhat strange, but knowing the volatility of her disposition and how extremely fond of every thing that wore the semblance of pleasure, it did not so much surprize him. The next morning he repaired to her at the time ap∣pointed, a new equipage, servants in new liveries with white and silver favours arrived at the door. The guests began to appear when enquiries were made for the bride.—Mr. Rooksby went up to hasten her. She was not in her dressing-room. He called for her woman: she was not to be found. At length a groom ventured, trembling into the presence of the disappointed, enraged bridegroom and delivered him a sealed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> He broke the seal with precipitation: it contained these words:</P>

<HEAD>TO MR. ROOKSBY.</HEAD>
<P>You thought to have deceived me, but you are mistaken. I have been informed of all your late dishonourable conduct. Would your mother's humble companion have ac∣cepted your hand, it would never have been offered to me: but though you have been a dupe to me I will not become one to you. I know, you will, at the reception of this, rave and curse your evil genius which has induced you to make yourself the laughing stock of your acquaintance. I am far be∣yond the reach of your revenge, and enjoy in idea, the ridiculous figure you will, at the moment you are reading this appear, sur∣rounded by your friends decked in the trap∣pings of nuptial finery and deserted by the intended bride. I have left the brats.—They would have been troublesome on the long journey I mean to take; you may either provide for them or send them to the work-house; either way will be equally a∣greeable to me. I have accepted the pro∣tection of a noble lover, and mean to make with him the tour of Europe. You must now offer yourself again to Miss Howard, and I wish she may serve you as I have done.</P>

It is easy to conceive the passion this in∣famous scrawl created in the bosom of Rooksby. He was in the first paroxysins of rage for putting an immediate period to his existence. Shame, vexation, and disap∣pointment drove him to the verge of dis∣traction. At length he recollected the child of whom he is extremely fond. He called for it, declared that the mother's guilt should never be revenged on her innocent offspring, and in caressing the little cherub, in some measure composed the perturbation of his spirits. The company dispersed, he sent away his chariot, and returned to his lodging in a hackney-coach, where he undressed and ordering post horses, set forward immedi∣ately for Oak-hall, leaving his own man to follow with the nurse and children. The eldest, who is a girl, I am told is at school in a village near Oxford, where Mr. Rooksky has every reason to be satisfied with the care taken of her education and morals. He means, he says, that she shall have a useful education, and will settle on her a thousand pounds, the interest of which is to be appropriated to her support. The two boys, he will bring up together and by a liberal education fit them for one of the genteel professions, the choice of which shall remain with themselves. To them also he will give a thousand pounds each; but
<PB N="47" REF="029439_0377_0FE1171873E51478"/>
they are both to be called by the name of Millar. This is certainly a noble spirited young man. It is a pity he has not more firmness of temper; but he is as weak as an infant and as easily persuaded by persons who rightly understand his disposition. Awa∣ken his gratitude or make a claim upon his honour, and you may lead him as you please. This is far from the kind of tem∣per that I like. Were I ever so much at∣tached to Mr. Rooksby, I should be afraid of professing it, least it should be supposed I meant to take an undue advantage of his easy nature, and I should, if married to such a man, avoid shewing a thousand little kind∣nesses, least I should seem to demand more than similar attentions from him. There is another trait in his character, which I have lately discovered. He is vain and rather addicted to jealousy; and I can perceive there is no part of Clara's conduct hurts him more severely, than finding her so totally in∣different—and when he imagined her strong∣ly attached to himself, to know her capable of eloping with another.</P>
<P>And yet, my dear Celia, this very man with all his errors, they have some how or other among them drawn me into a sort of promise to marry. Mrs. Kingly wrote and my dear Amelia wrote too.—Mrs.
<PB N="48" REF="029439_0378_0FE1171D39FEFC20"/>
Rooksby pleaded, and Clement himself, looked such eloquent things, that what with the grateful remembrance of his generosity, toward me, which I forgot to tell you his mother insisted on my accepting, and a sort of pity for his late disappointment, I expe∣rienced a kind of sentiment which I know not how to distinguish. It is more lively than esteem, and yet I am sure it is not love. However, be it what it may, the die is cast, and I believe Rooksby will be the man with whom I am destined to pass my life. The settlements, &amp;c. prepared for Clara, his mother declares shall remain for me, as blanks had been left for the names. I do not agree to this point; as I think the settlement by far too large. I think it very necessary a proper provision should be made in case of a large family, but as I have no fortune, it would be unjust as well as unge∣rous to accept a settlement of seven hundred a year. This I am resolved to over rule.—Three hundred will be more than sufficient. On this condition alone, will I give him my hand, for it shall never be said the poor Meriel Howard aggrandized herself at the expence of the Rooksby family. For here are ill natured people in all families and no doubt many of Mr. Rooksby's relations will think themselves degraded by this alliance.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="029439_0379_0FE11722AEFA0810"/>
In about a month from this time, my dear friend, my fate will be decided. Contrary to my inclination, the old lady will have a public wedding, and all the family to the third and fourth generation are to be invited. The old mansion is put into such a commo∣tion: here is such fitting up and pulling down, with such wise and busy faces, popping about from one apartment to another, while I, who am the cause of all the confu∣sion, am as calm and composed as possible. At least, my countenance and demeanor say so; but I have many serious thoughts, and many a tear and many a sigh is given to the memory of the time when I looked forward to the nuptial hour with different sensations; but that must be forgotten.

<P>IT is past, my friend—and I am now the wife of Mr. Rooksby. It is just a week, since at the altar, I pledged my faith to love and honour him to the latest period of his existence. Well Celia, I will keep this vow most religiously; at least I will esteem him and love no other, and whilst his con∣duct is such as demands honour, I will ho∣nour him. Should he ever fail in any of the grand moral duties, I will bear it with meekness, pity him and endeavour to re∣claim him. I will be a faithful wife in every sense of the word.</P>
<P>The day on which I gave him my hand, was indeed to me a tremendous one.—Kingly was present, nay he even gave me to his cousin. I trembled when he took my hand, a faint sickish sensation come over
<PB N="51" REF="029439_0381_0FE1172B72949008"/>
me: but I rallied my spirits and went through the ceremony tolerably well. My dear Ame∣lia, whom you might suppose would be pre∣sent on this important occasion, kept up my spirits during the rest of the day. Mrs. Kingly looked happy, but it was a kind of satisfaction tempered with fear.—"I hope" said she," pressing my hand, "I hope the aera of your felicity may be dated from this propitious day."—"Most certainly it will," cried Amelia, "for who ever heard of mi∣sery in a coach and six."—"Oh!" replied Mrs. Kingly, with great energy, "there is much greater misery in them than those who lack the goods of fortune will readily ima∣gine, aye, my dear Miss Sidney, and the worst kind of misery too, such as wealth cannot relieve or grandeur alleviate."</P>
<P>"Well," said Amelia, laughing, "I declare we have chosen a brilliant topic for a wedding day, but pray let us change it. I was al∣ways more inclined to become a disciple of the laughing, rather than the weeping phi∣losopher."</P>
<P>When it drew near dinner time and I found I must descend into the drawing room, I trembled from the idea of being presented to about half a hundred strangers, who would compliment, and criticise at a
<PB N="52" REF="029439_0382_0FE1172FA8CB1998"/>
most unmerciful rate; the one to my face, the other behind my back, and believe me I would sooner listen to the latter than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> former: for compliments have in general little or no meaning and of course are mere insipid trifles. Now in listening to the cri∣ticisms of our friendly neighbours, who perhaps did not intend we should over hear them, we discover our faults, and may learn how to amend them; but the misfortune is, few will take the trouble to point out our errors to us, while every one is ready to flatter our self love, by commending us for qualifications to which we have little or no pretensions, and, if they think, we believe their assertions, the moment we quit them they will laugh at our credulity. Well! my dear Celia, I never could bring myself to make compliments, or fine speeches to people, whom I did not think deserved them. But to return to my subject—</P>
<P>I got through the day tolerably well, and now our guests begin to think of returning to their respective homes. It is proposed, that we stay at Oak-hall till the latter end of November. Mrs. Rooksby has prevailed on Mrs. Sidney to remain with her, during the winter, while Amelia accompanies me to town. I am vastly pleased with the ar∣rangement, as the society of that dear girl
<PB N="53" REF="029439_0383_0FE1173459137EA0"/>
will be a great comfort to me. I find Rooks∣by has given orders for a house to be fitted up in a stile of the utmost elegance, as he intends we shall always pass the winters in town and the summers with his mother at the Hall. He talks of much grandeur and gaity. I am sorry for it, I think his taste very expensive; but it is not my place to speak. I am determined to regulate my own expences, by the strict rule of economy, void of parsimony. Even was the wealth my own, I have no right to squander it away in unnecessary trifles, and as it is not, I must be still more careful. My allowance for pocket money, cards, &amp;c. is extremely li∣beral, and I hope always to order it in such a manner as to have a sufficient sum by me, to assist depressed merit, or rescue suffering innocence from oppression. I hope, my dear Celia, elevated as my present situation is, I shall never forget the useful lessons taught me in the school of adversity; and surely, whilst the remembrance of my own sufferings are retained, my heart will never be rendered callous to the sufferings of others. Oh! My beloved friend, dearly indeed should I pur∣chase the smiles of fortune, if I am to lose my humanity. Benificent Ruler of the Universe, teach me to value the blessings bountifully showered upon me, by con∣stantly remembering my own deserts; and
<PB N="54" REF="029439_0384_0FE117395D473188"/>
whenever I meet an afflicted fellow-creature, let my heart shew its gratitude to Thee, by dropping the tear of sympathy, and granting the tribute of relief."—I am certain, Celia, they who have never known adver∣sity, cannot truly enjoy prosperity. I forgot to tell you, that Kingly left us the day after we were married. Mrs. Kingly stays, till we all go to London. When we are settled there, I will write you again; but you must not expect any great variety in my letters; I must, I suppose, at first enter into the gai∣ties of the metropolis, but I am determined not to be so infatuated as to give up my whole time to them. I will have my hours of peace and retirement: for in my opinion the life that is spent in a continued round of insipid pleasures, is not only entirely useless to society, but in some measure guilty, as we can have no time for the performance of those duties, which are incumbent on every professor of Christianity; nor do I think as many do, that people of a certain rank in life may pass their time in any way most agreeable to themselves, and that they are not accountable for it to any one. We certainly are answerable to one, who will demand an account of our stewardship at a time, when no evasion whatever will serve our turn: and the more elevated our sta∣tion, the more careful we should be to
<PB N="55" REF="029439_0385_0FE1173E9BE0B030"/>
set examples worthy the imitation of our inferiors. Examples that may inspire all, who know us with a love of virtue, be an honour to ourselves, and a benefit to socie∣ty in general.</P>
<P>Mr. Rooksby asked me, to whom I was writing. To the friend of my early days, I replied. We were educated in the same convent. Miss Shelburne chose to take the veil—I was of a different religion, and have been called into the busy scenes of life, but the affections of our youth are always re∣membered with peculiar pleasure; especial∣ly, when reason approves the election our hearts had made in the days of childhood. I am certain, my dear Meriel, said he, she must be amiable, or she would not be ho∣noured with your esteem.</P>
<P>You are a flatterer, said, I smiling, but if you knew Celia half so well as I do, you would know she was worthy of the love of every good heart. I will not repeat his re∣ply, my friend, as it would favour too much of vanity, if he is as gallant and ten∣der twelve months hence, I may perhaps, stand a good chance for claiming the <HI>flitch of bacon.</HI> He bids me present his best wish∣es to you. Amelia also requests to be re∣membered; but it is impossible that either

<P>I HAVE been in town above a week; but could not command an hour to devote to friendship and Celia. Indeed, I have been so taken up with mantua-makers, mil∣liners and toymen, I hardly know what ac∣count to give of the last seven days; then what with here and there a particular friend, who requested to be admitted, before my appearance at court gave the signal for the whole town to come and pass their opinion on my house-furniture, &amp;c. I have been wearied to death with a constant succession of impertinant visitors, who are thus over polite, for no other reason than the eager de∣sire they have to report the discoveries they make in regard to my person, dress and
<PB N="57" REF="029439_0387_0FE1174721B4A598"/>
manner, to the whole circle of their acquain∣tance; but in this they have been sadly dis∣appointed, for I have received them all in a small back drawing-room, and have never yet varied my dress from a neat dishabille.</P>
<P>I am now summoned to the drawing room: some new set of inquisitives, I sup∣pose, well, I must attend; for people of fashion live not for themselves, but others. They are afraid to perform any action, if unfashionable, though ever so right, least they should be laughed at: and for the very same cause dare not refuse to do any thing to which fashion gives a sanction, though rea∣son tells them it is wrong, and should be avoided.</P>
<P>I must leave you Celia.</P>
<P>And who do you imagine my visitors were? Now would I venture to lay a considerable wager, your mind would glance over the whole circle of my acquaintance, without being able to guess the right. So to save you the trouble of conjecture, I will at once inform you. They were no other than my kind aunt Mossop and her two amiable daugh∣ters. I do declare, Celia, when I saw them in the drawing room I absolutely blushed for
<PB N="58" REF="029439_0388_0FE1174BB5EEF608"/>
them. However, they did not seem to ex∣perience any embarrassment; but paid their compliments with the same easy air, as if nothing had ever interrupted our intimacy; only with this difference, their language and manner was more respectful.</P>
<P>"You have been very fly, my dear," said my aunt, "never to let us know where you were all this time, and then to blaze upon us all at once a splendid bride."</P>
<P>"I thought, madam, after the death of my father, you would feel but little inte∣rested about the fate of his daughter, for whom you never appeared to have any great degree of partiality."</P>
<P>"Bless me, Mrs. Rooksby, you are vast∣ly mistaken. I was always extremely partial to you, and I am sure Hester and Susan have talked of you many times, since last we had the pleasure of seeing you. We wondered what had become of you."</P>
<P>"I have seen a variety of scenes," said I, "nor would it have been in the least probable should meet with so advantageous a settle∣ment as I have, had it not been for the friendship of a young lady, whom I have once or twice seen at your house, and who
<PB N="59" REF="029439_0389_0FE11750D7691A60"/>
at present does me the honour to make one of my family." I then rang the bell, and desired the servant to inform Miss Sidney we requested the favour of her company. I saw my cousins look at each other when Amelia's name was mentioned, Mrs. Mossop changed countenance. "Bless me," said Hes∣ter, "I was thinking of Miss Sidney, the other day: but we have been in town so very lit∣tle while, we have seen nobody—this is posi∣tively the first visit we have made." When Amelia entered the room, I saw she was astonished: I also saw the constraint and confusion which my visitors vainly endea∣voured to hide under the mask of extreme pleasure at the accidental meeting. How∣ever, as I imagined, my cousins courted my notice merely in the hope of sometimes be∣ing of my parties, and throwing them∣selves in the way of men of rank and for∣tune, I gave them a general invitation to my house, and I sincerely wish the event may answer their sanguine expectations, as it would give me great satisfaction to see them married to worthy men, possessed of fortunes capable of supporting them in the manner to which they have been accustomed, and which I fear they could not continue, was their father to die before they are set∣tled; as he could not leave them a large fortune, having in general lived up to the
<PB N="60" REF="029439_0390_0FE117544B7AEF30"/>
extent of his income. Young Mossop is, I find, in the West Indies.—Is it not strange, my dear Celia, that I have heard nothing of my brother these two years past. However he has forgot me. I often think of him; I pray for his health and prosperity, and should rejoice to see him return with an indepen∣dence sufficient to place him in a respecta∣ble situation.—Oh Celia, this continual round of visitors, by no means suits the taste of your friend. I am called away again.</P>

<P>MY little Clementina, is grown the finest girl you can imagine; and I assure you, grandmamma is not a little proud of her darling. I wished the dear little charmer to have been called Frederica, but I dared not say so, least it should be thought improper. Last night, my dear Amelia arrived: her spirits are greatly de∣pressed by the death of her excellent mother, but as she will be happy in the friendship and protection of Mrs. Rooksby, I hope soon to see her chearfulness restored. I have got such a habit of seizing every leisure moment to scribble to my Celia, that I often
<PB N="62" REF="029439_0392_0FE1175F0397E430"/>
take up my pen, when I have really nothing to say. You rejoice, you tell me to find my happiness increase. Indeed, my dear friend I experience a much larger share than some years since, I could have imagined would have ever fallen to my lot. Mr. Rooksby is still the kind, the attentive husband, and the birth of my little girl seems more strong∣ly to cement our union.</P>
<P>You cannot think, how surprised I was a few days before we left town. Mr. Rooks∣by had been out in the morning, and on his return told me he had met with an old friend whom he had invited home to din∣ner." He is a man," said he, "with whom I formed an acquaintance when we were both boys at the same school together, I have not seen him for some time, but I al∣ways thought him a worthy fellow, and am now happy in the renewal of our intimacy." He did not mention the name of his friend. You may judge therefore what was my astonishment, when just before dinner a servant announced Mr. Belger. I know not why it was, but I felt myself stange∣ly embarrassed while he was paying his com∣pliments. Mr. Belger too was surprised, and looked abashed at the unexpected ren∣counter, for I had not seen him since the cold wet night when we parted at the
<PB N="63" REF="029439_0393_0FE117644DE0CF88"/>
end of Kensington. However, I imme∣diately accosted him by name and turning to Mr. Rooksby endeavoured at a smile, while I said, "This is an old acquaintance of mine too, though I dare say Mr. Belger had not the most distant idea of seeing me here." I then enquired after Mrs. Belger and Emma.</P>
<P>"Emma is abroad in a convent, madam," he replied—"and, her mother"—He hesi∣tated, and I at that moment perceiving he was dressed in second mourning, instantly understood his meaning. I felt my eyes fill. I remembered her gentleness and affection, and I also remembered how ill that affection had been requited.</P>
<P>"And pray, my dear," said Mr. Rooksby, "where were you acquainted with my friend Belger?"—At Kensington," I replied.—</P>
<P>"At Kensington!" said he with visible emo∣tion "Did you know many persons there."</P>
<P>"Very few, indeed; for at that time I was not in a situation to receive many visitants."</P>
<P>I did not choose, my dear Celia, to men∣tion having known Mrs. Moreton; as she was undoubtedly a woman of light character,
<PB N="64" REF="029439_0394_0FE1176723826C70"/>
the being supposed, an intimate of such a woman, would by no means contribute to raise me in Mr. Rooksby's opinion, I there∣fore endeavoured to give the conversation a different turn, and dinner being soon after announced, it assisted my design, and we spoke afterwards only on indifferent subjects.—I am by no means pleased with Belger's being on an intimate footing in our family, he is not a proper companion for Rooksby, I am certain he is of libertine principles, fond of gaming and dissipated in his manners, yet greatly as I dislike him, I dare not mention it to Mr. Rooksby, as he seems extremely fond of him and places the most implicit confidence in his honour, and has actually invited him to pass some weeks this summer with us here, I am mortified and vexed, Amelia laughs at me, when I mention my anxiety and says, he will now be fearful of insulting me by any mention of his love. While I was unprotected he could treat me with disrespect, without fear of being called to an account, now it is quite a different affair.—Indeed, Celia, this is not what I dread, but I think if Mr. Rooksby should by any means hear how intimate we once were, he would be displeased, and it might be the cause of great uneasiness between us, I shall take particular care to avoid all op∣portunities of being entertained alone by this
<PB N="65" REF="029439_0395_0FE1176CAD9C6440"/>
man, and feel happy in the reflection that while I am in the country I shall have Amelia constantly with me.</P>
<P>22<HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>Since I began my letter I have been so agitated and distressed I found myself totally unequal to the task of finishing it. Now I have sat down for that purpose, I hardly know how to arrange the extraordinary events that have happened within these last twelve days, not am I certain that you, my dear Celia, will entirely approve of my con∣duct; yet sure you will not greatly condemn me: for your gentle heart is benevolence itself. On the evening of the day on which I began my letter, I could not but observe that Mr. Rooksby was extremely thoughtful and grave, a thing with him very uncommon, as his usual demeanor is chearful, and his conversation lively.—Once or twice, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thought (for I observed him narrowly,) I saw the tears start in his eyes, he sighed deeply and often. His mother remarked his want of spirits and inquired if he was well. His answer was, "yes madam, very well, but rather out of spirits, I shall be better to-mor∣row, do not pay any attention to it."—I thought it was best not to speak, least urgent inquiries might encrea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> rather than relieve
<PB N="66" REF="029439_0396_0FE117709FF69E00"/>
his evident depression; and in case any family affair had occasioned his uneasiness I was sensible he would not choose to mention it before his mother and Amelia.—I therefore determined to let it rest, if he thought it right that I should be informed of the cause, he would the first convenient opportunity communicate it; if not, it would I naturally supposed only increase his vexation to be teized with impertinent inquiries. When we retired he spoke but little, seemed buried in thought, and I am certain, slept little all night. This was too much—I felt my heart partake of his uneasiness, though I was ignorant of its origin. I longed to lighten his anxiety by participation;—Yet, feared to be troublesome.—After breakfast perceiving his dejection rather in∣crease than diminish, I followed him into the shrubbery, and finding him sitting in a melancholy, musing posture, seated myself beside him, and laying my hand on his arm, said with a voice, that evidently spoke my tender solicitude—</P>
<P>"Rooksby you are not happy."</P>
<P>"I am not, indeed, my dear Meriel, I am very far from it; but do not let it interrupt your tranquillity. The cause of my present dejection will soon be removed, and then I
<PB N="67" REF="029439_0397_0FE117769D5E6EC0"/>
shall again enjoy with pleasure the society of the best of wives; but at present, my love, I must request you to leave me, as I am unfit for conversation."</P>
<P>"And can you, Rooksby, think me wor∣thy of the flattering appelation you just now gave me, and yet suppose me capa∣ble of preserving my tranquillity while I see you unhappy."</P>
<P>"You know, my sweet girl, I think you all, that is good and amiable in woman, and it is for your peace of mind I would endeavour to hide my unhappiness."</P>
<P>"But as you connot hide it from the eye of affection, then refuse me not the plea∣sure, my dear Rooksby of at least participa∣ting. If I cannot alleviate your anxiety, surely you cannot fear to place a confidence in the chosen friend of your heart."</P>
<P>"Oh no! but I know it will give you no pleasure to be informed, nay, I fear it would rather make you unhappy in an emi∣nent degree."</P>
<P>"Then it is something of great conse∣quence either to your honour or interest, or perhaps to both: if so, I must one day
<PB N="68" REF="029439_0398_0FE1177B403B0178"/>
know it, and sure the tidings will not give me so much pain from you, as from the lips of another."</P>
<P>"Oh! my gentle love, do not press me, you have no idea of what my heart at this moment suffers, while I refuse to gratify your laudable curiosity. Yes, my dear Me∣riel—I know the only incentive to be thus pressing, is a generous wish to relieve my anxiety; but believe me, you cannot form the remotest idea of the cause. If you could, you would look on me with a mix∣ture of horror and disgust."</P>
<P>"Say not so, Rooksby; do not think so meanly of your wife as to suppose her capa∣pable of thinking of you a moment with∣out affection, without an ardent wish to see you as perfectly happy, as it is possible for mortal to be."</P>
<P>"Can, my dearest life, think of no inci∣dent that might happen, that would wea∣ken her affection towards me."</P>
<P>"None.—Were it possible, (but I know it not) that forgetful of your vows, you could prove false to your Meriel she could never forget that you had raised her from
<PB N="69" REF="029439_0399_0FE117806111F528"/>
indigence! that you were her husband! and the father of her child!"</P>
<P>"Dearest, best of womankind—false to thee! No—rather should my heart cease to beat. I see your heroic spirit is adequate to any trial; no longer will I keep you in suspense. I have seen Clara."—</P>
<P>"And, is that all!—fye! Rooksby, fye! could you think that would give me a mo∣ments pain. Believe me were it in my pow∣er to be of the least service to Mrs. Millar, I would instantly fly to do it.</P>
<P>"Angelic goodness! but could you in∣deed forgive her."</P>
<P>"I have no right to call her too account, my dear Rooksby, for her errors: but tell me, is she in distress. If so, I know she is my fellow creature, and it is my duty to relieve her."</P>
<P>"Meriel," (said he catching me in his arms) while tears of exultation burst from his eyes, "you surpass even the elevated idea I had formed of your prudence and virtue, Clara is in distress, I met her yesterday, with scarce∣ly cloaths to shield her from the inclemency of the weather. She told me she had past
<PB N="70" REF="029439_0400_0FE11784DE954110"/>
the two last nights in th e open air, exposed to nocturnal damps; that lovely form that once was shielded by a tender husband from even the most trifling inconvenience, had nought to rest upon but the cold earth, no canopy but heaven,—and two days had past since she had tasted food."—</P>
<P>"Merciful heaven, said I, (while my eyes overflowed,) why have I been kept thus long in ignorance, were is she, let us go, my dear Rooksby, shall I quietly enjoy the luxuries of life while poor Clara is in want of even the necessaries."</P>
<P>"I relieved her at the time, my love. Do not feel so acutely, I even promised again to see her; but my heart smote me, I thought should it reach your ears, you would think me the basest of mankind."</P>
<P>I should think you so, indeed, were you capable of beholding unmoved the miseries of a woman, with whom you once lived on terms of the greatest familiarity: but we are losing time. Let us hasten to the poor sufferer. Who knows, but we may lead her back to the paths of virtue? But hold! You shall go alone, Rooksby. She may consider my presence as an insult."</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="029439_0401_0FE1178A0B5A4BB8"/>
"She must, if she reflects at all, my dear Meriel, think it the highest condescention; and if you will be so generous as to visit and promise her your protection, I will write her a note to prepare her for the in∣terview, and you shall see her in the after∣noon."</P>
<P>"You will accompany me then?"</P>
<P>"No, dear girl, I will not. After what has past, it is impossible to doubt either your delicacy or generosity. You shall act entirely as your own heart directs. I am sure by leaving you to its dictates, Clara will have no reason to complain: but let me intreat you not to mention this affair, either to my mother or Miss Sidney. I am sure they would blame the generous ardour with which you espouse the cause of the un∣fortunate Clara."</P>
<P>"I promised silence, and we returned to the house, Rooksby all life, spirit and ten∣derness; and I planing fifty different schemes for Clara's future support. At dinner Mrs. Rooksby was quite happy to see Clement's chearfulness returned; and Miss Sidney was too delicate and conside∣rate to ask any questions concerning his late dejection and absence of mind.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="029439_0402_0FE1178CC7134B68"/>
About five o'clock the chariot came to the, door, and Rooksby handed me in, telling me the coachman knew where to drive, I can∣not say but during my little ride, I under∣went great agitation of spirits, I am certainly doing right, thought I, in offering my protec∣tion to the unfortunate Clara, and did not hu∣manity point out my duty, self-interest would urge me to a performance of it, for should I not prove a friend to Clara, Rooksby undoubted∣ly would; and sensible, as I was, of the undue influence she once had over him, I could not but fear, that influence might again be ex∣erted to his ruin: Besides, said I, who knows but Clara, had she been blest with friends to direct her, and counsel her aright might at this moment have been a shining member of society. Alas, it might have been my fate to wander forlorn and unprotected thro' the world, had it not been for the interposition of providence, who so wonderfully inclined the heart of the friendly Mr. Welldon to grant me succour and relief; and shall I who have experienced such blessings and support from an All Governing power, refuse my feeble assistance to raise from sorrow and infamy, a poor fallen sister. Oh no! That same be∣nignant Power has pointed out my duty in the clearest manner, and I trust will not suf∣fer me to be backward in the performance
<PB N="73" REF="029439_0403_0FE117924A174468"/>
of it.—Fully occupied by these and similar reflections, I hardly perceived what route the carriage had taken, till it stopped at the door of a small neat cottage. A wholesome looking young woman presented herself. I enquired for Mrs. Millar and was shewn into a parlour and informed she would wait on me immediately. I was scarcely seated when the door opened, and (judge if possible my surprize,) Mrs. Moreton entered.—An exclamation of wonder escaped me. Oh! Madam, said she, and unable to articulate more, sunk on the nearest chair, covered her face with her hands and burst into tears.</P>
<P>"Be not alarmed," said I, in the gentlest accent I could assume, "you have nothing to fear from me. But tell me do you live in this house, and are you any ways connected with the unfortunate Mrs. Millar."</P>
<P>"Oh! dear lady," said she, (sinking on her knees and raising her streaming eyes to my face) "I am that unhappy wretch, I am that ungrateful monster who have injured (though Heaven knows involuntarily,) the very wo∣man, who now generously comes to save me from despair."</P>
<P>I was greatly affected, my dear Celia, I raised the afflicted penitent, and bade her be comforted.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="029439_0404_0FE1179769C78E80"/>
"Comfort!" exclaimed she vehemently, "Alas! where can a wretch, whose crimes are so multiplied as mine, find it?"</P>
<P>"It is never denied to the truly penitent: and I hope you will experience its benign influence."</P>
<P>"I shall! I begin to feel it already dawn on my benighted soul. It comes adminis∣tered by an angel's hand."</P>
<P>I then made some enquiries concerning her present situation, and requested to be informed, in what manner I could render her service which would be most acceptable.</P>
<P>"You cannot, my dear Madam," said she, "judge how far I am worthy your com∣passion, unless you will permit me to acquaint you with the chief incidents of my past life. I know at this moment, I appear to you an unworthy unprincipled wretch. When I think of the situation, in which I left you at Kensington, I cannot but reflect how lit∣tle I should expect from your hands. Nay that my very life is in your power, but when I shall inform how much I suffered for the unintentional injury I did you, I flatter my∣self you will pity and forgive me."</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="029439_0405_0FE1179CA882E920"/>
"But I must insist," said I, "that you do not enter upon this detail till your situa∣tion is rendered more comfortable than it is at present."</P>
<P>"Permit me," said she, interrupting me, "to remain at this cottage a few days. In that time, I will endeavour to commit to your perusal a written account of my mise∣rable life, from the earliest period of recol∣lection till now. I am sensible you will find much to blame—but, alas! you will find much more to awaken your compassion.—My crimes, though many, have not been my own: but my afflictions are I have neither friend or relation to console, com∣fort, or alleviate my anguish."</P>
<P>The agony her countenance expressed, as she uttered this, is not to be described. I felt her solitary, forlorn situation, and while the tear of sympathy trembled in my eye, I breathed forth the accents of consolation.—When she grew more composed, I arose to take my leave;—but was sadly at a loss how to offer the assistance I was sensible she wanted, without hurting her feelings. At length I ventured to draw forth my purse. She laid her hand on my arm—"That is entirely needless." said she, "Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by has been very liberal. Let me not be
<PB N="76" REF="029439_0406_0FE117A012B5E6D8"/>
thus oppressed with obligation, till some way is pointed out for me in some measure to show my gratitude."—"Call it not an ob∣ligation," said I, "It is only a debt due from the happy to the unfortunate." "I have one request to make dear madam," said she "suffer me then to decline this offered favour in hopes you will grant me the one nearer my heart."—"Name it," said I.—"It is," she replied, "that you will forbear men∣tioning the circumstances that past at Ken∣sington to Mr. Rooksby, till you have re∣ceived my letter. After that you will think of me with more clemency than you do at present."</P>
<P>I bade her be quite easy in that respect, and leaving the purse on the table returned to the Hall, where I found Mrs. Rooksby and Amelia wonderfully curious to know where I had been. "To keep a particular appointment I assure you," said Clement, "and as I am the only confident, that is trusted in the affair, I beg you will not be inquisitive concerning it; for I have promis∣ed secrecy."</P>
<P>He did not make any enquiry of what had passed at our interview, but pointedly avoided the subject. The next morning he presented me with two hundred pounds, say∣ing,
<PB N="77" REF="029439_0407_0FE117A59E02FFA8"/>
"My dear Meriel's expences may at this time be greater than usual. Make use of this my love, and should you require more, you know where to apply." This sum I shall look upon as the property of Clara, and when we have settled some plan for her future support, it shall be appropria∣ted entirely to her use. I was very impatient for the promised letter, as I imagined it almost impossible for her to extenuate a conduct so unjust and cruel as hers had been toward me; but resolved at all events to judge as candidly as possible, and extend toward her a friend∣ship, which may awaken in her mind a just sense of her past errors, and lead her im∣perceptibly to the love and practice of virtue. At length the long expected packet arri∣ved. I send a copy for my dear Celia's pe∣rusal. Oh! my friend, when you have perused it, you will like me, shed tears of sympathy over poor Clara's sufferings, till her offences are blotted from your remem∣brance.—Farewell, my Celia.

<HEAD>LETTER XLVI. CLARA to MRS. ROOKSBY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>June</HI> 20<HI>th,</HI> 1783.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I have taken up my pen to ad∣dress the most benevolent woman on earth, I shudder to think in what a despicable light I shall appear.—Oh! Madam, the heart not entirely rendered callous by guilt, shrinks from the scrutinizing eye of superior virtue, yet painful as the task is, I feel it is a duty I owe, to you, to myself, and to my dear for∣saken children.—I am not, madam, as my sister-in-law represented to Mr. Rooksby, the daughter of a decayed officer; Alas! my friendship with this cruel sister, has been the chief cause of all my guilt and misery. My father was a gentleman of genteel fortune, and unsullied reputation. I was his only child, and at the age of thirteen having lost my mother was placed at a boarding school near Oxford, where I received a genteel edu∣cation; and to my utter regret formed an acquaintance with Eleanor Ramsay, she was
<PB N="79" REF="029439_0409_0FE117AF1FAFD100"/>
five years older than myself and was a teacher in this school, she had an expensive taste for dress, and was passionately fond of gaiety and pleasure. My father made me a liberal al∣lowance for my pocket expenses. Eleanor was not so amply supplied, she told me that her father had been dead for some years and her mother's income was extremely confined tho' she strained it to the utmost in order that herself and brother might have the benefit of a liberal education.—Young Ram∣say was a genteel engaging youth, and at that time employed in the study of the law. He frequently came to visit his sister, and sometimes took her to places of public enter∣tainment, in which excursions I was impru∣dently allowed to accompany them. Ramsay pretended to be struck with my person; but I have since been convinced the fortune my father possessed and of which I was supposed heiress, was the chief incentive to the passion he so ardently professed. Eleanor was plain in her person, but artful and insinuating in her manner. She constantly contrived par∣ties of pleasure, in which I was included: and in return I supplied her with money to pur∣chase any article of finery which her own narrow allowance would not afford.—</P>
<P>In this manner we proceeded till I reached my sixteenth year, when on receiving a sum∣mons
<PB N="80" REF="029439_0410_0FE117B403A07B68"/>
from my father to prepare to quit school entirely, Ramsay and his sister shewed such marks of affliction at our approaching sepa∣ration, the former declaring his existence depended on my constancy and affection; that giddy, thoughtless, and easily persuaded, I consented to an elopement and accom∣panied these false friends to Scotland, where I sealed myself the most wretched of wo∣mankind, by uniting myself to an unprinci∣pled wretch, in whose whole family there was not one atom of honour or generosity.—On our return we hastened to my father and humbly requested his pardon and blessing.—Alas! I had forfeited all claim to both. He spurned me from him, and declared he would never see my face again. Over∣whelmed with affliction, I had now no course to take, but to repair with my husband to Lon∣don to his mother and sister, who, I thought, received me very coldly, considering how ea∣gerly they had strove to promote the union. Even Ramsay himself was much altered in his manner and I began to perceive, that they con∣sidered me as a burthen. I wrote a most pe∣netential letter to my father, requesting to be received, and offering to quit a man, whom I found my heart was by no means attached to; but the answer I received was, that as I had voluntarily quitted his protection for that of a husband, and taken the liberty to
<PB N="81" REF="029439_0411_0FE117B913B51AE0"/>
choose for myself, without consulting him on the propriety of my choice, I must take the consequence of my precipitancy: but, he feared, if I paid as little regard to the duties of a wife, as I had done to those of a daughter, my husband would soon have rea∣son to repent our union. He enclosed me a note for two hundred pounds, declaring it was all I must ever expect, as he had made his will in favour of a sister's son then abroad in the navy. This money proved a season∣able relief, as Mrs. Ramsay's affairs were greatly deranged; but it was soon expend∣ed, and I was again reduced to bear the ill∣nature of all the family; for Ramsay never entertained a thought of giving me even an apartment to myself, nor indeed was it in his power, as he had no employment by which we could hope to be supported. We had been married about a twelve-month, when he received an offer of accompanying a young gentleman abroad. This he eager∣ly accepted, and I was left with Mrs. Ram∣say. My situation was as uncomfortable as you can possibly imagine, I had not money even for necessary expences, and I could not help perceiving, that even my food was grudged by my mother-in-law. I thought once more of making a personal application to my father, but to my great affliction he at that time died suddenly, and all hi∣property
<PB N="82" REF="029439_0412_0FE117BBEB7A8610"/>
devolved to the relation I have al∣ready mentioned. Though Mrs. Ramsay's finances were very confined, she lived in an expensive manner, kept a good deal of com∣pany and went frequently into public. One night being with her at the play, we were accosted by an elderly gentleman, who sat in the box with us, shewed us many civilities during the evening, and when the entertain∣ment was ended, insisted on setting us down at our own door in his carriage, I thought there was an impropriety in accepting these civilities from a perfect stranger; but as my mother and sister acquiesced, I knew it would only be deemed prudery in me to resist.—I, therefore, followed their example, and step∣ed into the carriage. When we arrived at home, the gentleman asked permission to enquire after our health the ensuing morning, which was granted. On our entering the house I began to rally Eleanor on the con∣quest she had made, as I naturally imagined these civilities were intended for her, but Mrs. Ramsay cried with more good humour than I had heard her speak for some time.—"No, no! my dear, Eleanor has no right to the glory of the conquest, I fancy it is you, my pretty Clara, who have attracted the old gentleman's notice; Eleanor's person is not adapted for making conquests.—"I hope you are mistaken, madam," I replied;
<PB N="83" REF="029439_0413_0FE117C1DA087590"/>
"for I should greatly rejoice in any good fortune which may happen to my sister. For my own part, my lot is cast."</P>
<P>The next morning, Mr. Millar (for it was he, who had accosted us the night before) called, and after chatting some time on in∣different subjects, offered to take us that evening to Ranelagh. From this time an in∣timacy commenced, and I soon really un∣derstood, that my unfortunate person had been the object of his pursuit. It was in vain I remonstrated on the impropriety of a married woman listening to overtures of love. Mrs. Ramsay treated the remonstrance as folly and romance. What shall I say, my dear madam, ill treated at home, distressed in my circumstances no friend near to whom I could apply for advice or assistance. I in∣sensibly gave way to the delusions of splendor and affluence, and one evening at a masque∣rade consented to my ruin.—A few days af∣ter this fatal night, I went with Mr. Millar to Oxford, which was the place of his resi∣dence. Eleanor accompanied me and I as∣sumed the name of Millar. As I had not received a line from my husband since his departure from England, I imagined he had totally forgot me and would be as happy to be released from the burthen of maintaining
<PB N="84" REF="029439_0414_0FE117C539BBD0D0"/>
me, as he once pretended he should be in obtaining my hand.</P>
<P>Mr. Millar was extremely fond of me, I endeavoured as much as was in my power to return this affection with gratitude; but alas! madam, I was far from happy. Con∣scious guilt had fixed her fangs in my bosom and knowing myself unworthy the attentions I daily received from the virtuous part of my sex. I began to envy a superiority, the consciousness of which had given me so much pain; but though I was far from hap∣py I had not yet tasted the misery of loving one object, while I felt myself bound to another. That superlative excess of anguish was reserved for me, 'till accident introdu∣ced Mr. Millar to Mr. Rooksby. I will not repeat the steps I took, (tears of contrition bathe my cheeks while I write it) to deceive the worthy Mr. Millar, and indulge my ten∣derness for Rooksby. Suffice it to say I gave a loose to love, and experienced its effects with more violence, as it was the first time my heart had ever been sensible of the passion; and certain it is, when we have taken one step in guilt we never pause at a se∣cond or a third, when either interest or plea∣sure urges our pursuit. You have no doubt been informed of my leaving Mr. Millar and following Mr. Rooksby to town; I
<PB N="85" REF="029439_0415_0FE117CAC86F1A78"/>
shall therefore pass over every circumstance that ensued until my acquaintance with you, (then Miss Howard) at Mrs. La Cours, and your subsequent removal to Kensington. At that time I had relinquished the name of Millar; but as I had an invincible aversion to that of Ramsay, and Mr. Rooksby refu∣sed me his, I assumed my own maiden name of Moreton. While I resided at Kensing∣ton, I received Mr. Rooksby's visits very privately, as he was anxious for me to pre∣serve my character, and I wished to appear to you in the light of an amiable woman. I saw you regarded me with esteem, and I knew your heart too well to suppose that esteem would be continued, if you knew I was a slave to guilty passion.—Believe me, dearest, best of womankind, I never enter∣tained an idea to your disadvantage. I wish∣ed from my soul to promote your welfare, and have taught my heart to rejoice in your prosperity, though that prosperity has torn from my agonized heart every earthly good: but to proceed—The day before I called on you and bespoke the linen for my sister Elea∣nor, I had received a note from Mrs. Ram∣say informing me that a particular relation was come to town, and as they were unac∣quainted with my connection with Mr. Mil∣lar, &amp;c. and still regarded me as the wife of her son, she wished me to come to town
<PB N="86" REF="029439_0416_0FE117CDF0EAD7A8"/>
and make them a visit, taking the eldest child with me. On the morning preceding the day on which this visit was to be paid, Elea∣nor let my watch fall, and without acquaint∣ing me with the circumstance sent it to have the damage repaired. You know what followed. I went to town; but, alas! on my arrival at my mother's, who should I meet but my unworthy husband. I now too late discovered that my sister had been in the plot to betray me. He instantly claimed me, as his lawful wife, and insisted on my accompanying him abroad, from whence, he said, he had only returned to fetch me; as he had through the interest of his friend, obtained a very respectable place under the French government. It was in vain to remonstrate. I was was obliged to comply, and early the next morning we set off for Dover, leaving the children with Mrs. Ramsay. On our arrival in that place, it was too late to think of crossing the chan∣nel that night. We therefore bespoke a passage on board a packet, and as it was to sail by five o'clock the next morning, we retired early to bed. But judge, dear ma∣dam, if possible, my anguish and surprize, when awaking about seven o'clock, I found my husband and sister had left me, and ta∣ken with them my trunks containing all my clothes, jewels, money, &amp;c. leaving me
<PB N="87" REF="029439_0417_0FE117D3D51458D8"/>
nothing but about six guineas which I had in my pocket.</P>
<P>I arose with a heavy heart, and ordered some breakfast. While I was taking my solitary meal, I thought I heard a voice that was familiar to my ears, and inquiring of the maid who attended what company was then in the house, I learnt that Mr. Rookysby was there on his way to France, and that the packet he had taken for himself and ser∣vants did not sail till the next tide. I then remembered his informing me at his last visit, that he should be obliged to visit the continent before he could see me again, and overjoyed to find him in the same house with me, considered the treatment I had suffered from my husband as a fortunate cir∣cumstance, as it would probably procure me the pleasure of accompanying my adored Rooksby abroad. Pardon, madam, these involuntary expressions of affection, I will strive to restrain my pen: but when the heart has once been strongly attached, it is hard to break it of its usual effusions of tenderness. I bid the servant shew me to the room where he was, and rushing into it, overcome with the various emotions, which agitated my bosom, I fainted in his arms. It will be needless to repeat our conversa∣tion. I must only remark, that as I had
<PB N="88" REF="029439_0418_0FE117D8410903C0"/>
never informed him of my unfortunate mar∣riage with Ramsay, and, as he had al∣ways supposed me the wife of Mr. Millar, I did not dare explain to him the real cause of my abrupt appearance at Dover. He at∣tributed it solely to my affection to himself, and I blest the chance which had led me to him.</P>
<P>On our return from the continent, I made many enquiries concerning my dear Miss Howard, for whom I had suffered many an anxious hour; but could not by any means learn where you had taken refuge after the inhuman treatment you had experien∣ced at Kensington. I make no doubt, ma∣dam, but you are acquainted with every circumstance, preceding the time in which I had hoped to be united to Mr. Rooksby. I had previously wrote to Mrs. Ramsay, re∣questing, she would use her interest with her son to relinquish all claim to me as his wife, and indeed, I had been informed I could refute that claim by pleading infancy at the time of my imprudent elopement. To these letters I received the most satisfactory an∣swers, signed by both Ramsay and his mo∣ther, declaring they were heartily weary of the connection and would gladly renounce it, on condition of my paying a stipulated sum of money, to which I readily agreed, and began
<PB N="89" REF="029439_0419_0FE117DD8532CF80"/>
to look forward with hope to days of future happiness, and let me add innocence, for I felt my heart so firmly attached to the generous Rooksby, as to render it impossible for me ever to injure him even in thought. But, ah! my dear madam, how soon were these bright prospects overclouded, how quickly was this charming hope snatched from me, and, my bosom left a chearless and desolate chaos, which peace or joy can never more enliven. When I endeavour to retrace this most heart rending period of my life: such agonizing feelings overpower me, that my tears flow in scalding torrents down my cheeks; and sighs of acute anguish rend my bosom. I cannot at present proceed in my recital.—Oh! hea∣vens, that one who knows so well the just value of virtue, should be irresistibly im∣pelled to actions from which her soul shrinks with horror. The innocent may pity, but they cannot have the remotest idea of my sufferings.</P>

<P>My heart is more at ease, tears are a sweet relief to the unfortunate, and when I remem∣bered the words of consolation which I had
<PB N="90" REF="029439_0420_0FE117E0659692E8"/>
listened to from the lips of angelic purity, when the benevolent Mrs. Rooksby cheared me with her presence, a soothing reflection, something like hope, pervaded my bosom, and though tears still continued to fall, they fell without pain. I will now proceed in my narrative.</P>
<P>On the evening preceding the day on which I flattered myself with becoming the happiest of my sex, I expected Mrs. Ramsay to receive the money which I had promised to pay her, and therefore, desired the servants to deny me, even to the chosen master of my affections. Unfortunate hour, of what scenes of misery wert thou the harbinger, but I will not complain, I acknowledge I deserved it all, for had I not deceived the best the worhiest of mankind, by daring to accept his honour∣able offers, when I knew myself already sacrificed (I will not say united) to a villain. But what will not a woman do, who loves, who doats to madness and fears to be separa∣ted forever from the object of her adoration, what errors will not the heart involuntarily commit when under the influence of hood∣winked passion?—</P>
<P>It was about nine o'clock as I was sitting in the nursery, with my two dear boys, that a servant informed me the person whom I
<PB N="91" REF="029439_0421_0FE117E5EBFDF680"/>
expected was below, I kissed my sweet cherubs bade them good night and repaired to the parlour, which I had appointed to receive Mrs. Ramsay in; but now great was my astonishment on entering the room to see my inexorable tormenter and his sister Eleanor, with their mother. I gave a shriek and sunk trembling on the nearest chair. Ramsay approached me with feigned tenderness—"why these alarms, my dear Clara," said he "why should you start thus to behold the man who adores you, and who though you have cruelly deserted and injured, is ready again to receive you to his arms, and willing to forget all that is past."—"would to hea∣ven" said I, "that every past action of my life could be buried in eternal oblivion, particu∣larly that to which I was artfully led by you and your insinuating sister, of giving you my hand, when a moment's reflection would have convinced me you had no share in my heart."—</P>
<P>"It is well, madam," said he, "you have made a frank confession but know it is amply in my power to revenge the repeated insults and injuries I have received from you.—You flatter yourself it is in your power to annul a marriage contracted in your minority, but it is not; and unless you consent to make me master of all the money and jewels at present
<PB N="92" REF="029439_0422_0FE117E9E45B1930"/>
in your possession, and leaving this house ac∣company me wherever I choose to go, I will to-morrow follow you to the Church and in the face of the whole congregation expose your infamous conduct, and claim my prior right not only to your person, but to all the wealth your infatuated lover has heap∣ed upon you."—What were my sufferings at this horrid moment. Turn either way, infamy stared me in the face. I was unable to determine what plan to pursue. To re∣main in London was impossible, after what had past as I should undoubtedly have been the jest even of my own servants. At length I concluded, whatever might be my fate, the generous Rooksby should not be involved in the shame that would consequently ensue on a public exposure of my guilt, I therefore told Ramsay I was ready to accompany him wherever he pleased; but as to the presents I had received from Mr. Rooksby, I did not conceive I had any right to take them with me.—</P>
<P>This was not what the wretch wanted. Horrible menaces and threats were used to prevail on me to give him my cash and jewels, I was intirely in the power of these three wretches, nor did I dare even to call for the assistance of my servants, as they all declared my life should pay the forfeit of such an
<PB N="93" REF="029439_0423_0FE117EF0F3F9850"/>
attempt: and when they had gained their point, and I attempted to go up stairs to fetch the jewels, both Mrs. Ramsay and Eleanor accompanied me. On returning to the par∣lour, they desired me to send for a Hackney Coach.—Then it was, dear madam that my innocent infants darted across my memory. "I must have my children," said I.—"In∣deed, said the unfeeling Ramsay, but you will not. The brats are none of mine; leave them then to him who has a right to main∣tain them."</P>
<P>To describe my anguish at this cruel speech is impossible.—You, madam, are a mother, and it is only a mother can conceive my suf∣ferings. I knelt, I bathed his feet with tears, and embraced his knees, but in vain. Too much under the dominion of fear to exert myself to insist on their being taken with me, I suffered myself to be led more dead than alive to the coach; and that very night we all ser out for Cornwall. What arts they made use of to deceive my servant, I know not; but before our departure from Lon∣don my trunks were brought to Mrs. Ram∣say's, and one small one containing every necessary for travelling was opened that I might dress myself in a proper manner for so long a journey. I never could learn how they had contrived this, but am rather led
<PB N="94" REF="029439_0424_0FE117F1E7AFDDC8"/>
to imagine they had bribed my own woman to their interest.—During my comfortless journey, all my thoughts were occupied by my beloved children, who were left entirely to the humanity of a man, whom I had de∣ceived and injured in the grossest manner, and who might avenge the mother's crimes by deserting her offspring. I was sensible Rooksby possessed a benevolent heart, but when I remembered the provocations I had given him—I trembled for the fate of my poor infants, whose only birth-rights were poverty, shame, and the contempt of the world. It is impossible for any one, who has not been in the same situation to judge of my distress. The anxiety of my mind affected my health, and before we arrived at our journey's end I was in a high fever. We stopped at a village near Saltash, where my disorder increased to such a degree that it was dangerous to think of removing me. A delirium ensued and I raved (as I have been since informed) incessantly for Rooksby and my children. At length, youth and a good constitution combated the strength of my disorder; and after a profound sleep of ma∣ny hours, I awoke to perfect reason; but Gracious Heaven! what were my feelings, to learn when I enquired for Ramsay and Eleanor, that they were gone, and with them all my property. The clergyman of the pa∣rish
<PB N="95" REF="029439_0425_0FE117F7B86750D8"/>
a humane sensible man had frequently visited me, during my illness, and now en∣tered the room with an intent to see if I yet lived. It was to him I had been indebted for all the attentions that had been shewn me: and when he found me capable of read∣ing, he put into my hands a letter which he said my brother had left for me. At the word brother I expressed some astonishment: but my curiosity and impatience to read the letter would not then permit an explanation. This was the letter</P>

<P>In your attempts to dupe others you have been effectually duped yourself. Vain, fool∣ish woman, who thought your boasted beauty would insure you admirers in all who beheld you. Ramsay is not your husband. He was mine long before he saw you. From the first moment he beheld you, I saw you had supplanted me in his affections, and therefore determined on revenge. I have (thank my kind genius) amply effected it, and reduced you to the lowest abyss of in∣famy and shame.

You have no right to the name of Ram∣say, nor indeed, to any but that of More∣ton, which you have shamefully disgraced. Ramsay, was my maiden name, and as my marriage was a private one, my husband when visiting me always chose to assume that, and pass for my brother. I enclose you ten pounds, if you live it will be of some service to you, if not, whoever opens this may make use of it for past expences. I sincerely, and from my soul, wish your re∣covery, as my triumph will not be com∣plete, unless I know you have felt the mise∣ry, in which I glory to have involved you.</P>

<P>Before I had finished this inhuman letter, I fell into strong convulsions, which occa∣sioned a relapse of my disorder, and I was again reduced to insanity.</P>
<P>The humane clergyman had me removed to his own house, and by the kind atten∣tions of himself and a daughter, I was in time restored to health and a keen sense of my deplorable situation.</P>
<P>As my strength returned, my afflictions recurred to my mind with greater force—My dear deserted infants perishing for want,

or exposed to the harsh usage experienced by children left to the parish, were con∣stantly before my eyes, and I resolved at all events to return to London and learn their fate. Ill as my benevolent host could afford it, he lent me three guineas to help me on my journey, and gave me a letter to a poor woman, a late parishioner of his, who was married and settled in London, re∣questing her to render me every service in her power. With this slender sum, I sat forward and after a wearisome journey some∣times riding, sometimes walking, I arrived sate in town, and took up my abode with the person just mentioned. From the en∣quires I made (for I had the temerity to venture to Mr. Rooksby's house) I learnt his happy marriage with the amiable Miss Howard, and inwardly rejoiced to think that in such a union, his future happiness must be secure. I also learnt, that my chil∣dren were in Devonshire. The maternal heart will yearn to pour forth its affection. I had determined to walk to the environs of Oak-hall and endeavour to gain a sight of my beloved little ones, when a most un∣toward accident prevented my putting my designs in execution. This was my kind landlady falling ill, and as she kept a shop, her husband earnestly entreated me to re∣main with them till her recovery; to which
<PB N="98" REF="029439_0428_0FE1180559D56B28"/>
as I was under many obligations to them, I could not but assent. Her illness was pain∣ful and lingering, and in the end terminated her life. Soon after her decease, I propo∣sed removing from the house, when the very man, who had so earnestly entreated my stay, now demanded payment for my board and lodging. I had neither money nor friends. What could I do? I thought once of applying to Mr. Rooksby; but the fear of giving you pain prevented me. I sub∣mitted to my hard fate in silence and was conveyed to prison. Three months did I linger in this wretched place, huddled among the most abject and miserable of the human race; and barely existing on the scanty pittance allowed me, and the charity of the benevolent. At length, I was one day re∣cognized by a tradesman, with whom I had dealt in my days of affluence. He com∣miserated my condition, generously paid the sum for which I had been confined, and gave me two guineas in my pocket. No sooner was I at liberty, than I resumed my wish of going to my children. I set forward and almost begged my way to this place; but alas! when here, what could I do for support, what door would open to receive a poor wretch like me? I wandered every day round the environs of the hall, and once had the extatic pleasure of catching a
<PB N="99" REF="029439_0429_0FE1180A71D28058"/>
glance of my children: but I dared not speak to them, though I longed to fold them to my maternal heart. My little stock of money was soon exhausted, though I lived almost upon bread and water, and at night, rested my weary limbs on the damp ground. But conscience told me it was all right, and only a just punishment for my errors; so I bore it without complaint, and watered my cold pillow with tears of un∣feigned repentance. One afternoon, as I was wandering in the adjacent fields, over∣come by hunger and distress, I sat down beside a brook that ran along the woodside and after reflecting a few moments on the horrors of my situation, I conceived the im∣pious idea of putting a period to my exist∣ence. I arose from my seat to put my de∣sign in execution, when hearing a rustling on the other side the hedge, I started; and in a moment saw Mr. Rooksby come across a stile into the field where I was. I gave a faint scream and sunk to the ground oppres∣sed by undescribable emotions. Urged by humanity, he approached and raised me from the earth. I opened my eyes; but dared not look at him.</P>
<P>"Poor soul," said he, in the accent of benevolence, "you seem ill. Where shall I lead you, or what can I do to serve you."
<PB N="100" REF="029439_0430_0FE1187BB68E04C8"/>
"Leave me," I replied, with a look and voice of destraction—"Leave me Rooksby to the fate I merit."—"Gracious heaven!" said he, "is it possible, or do my senses de∣ceive me?"—"Oh!" said I, clasping my hands, "pity the wretched Clara, and leave her to die in peace."</P>
<P>"Clara," cried he, slackening the arm that had supported me, "poor infatuated wo∣man, how came you thus reduced?"—</P>
<P>I need not repeat what answer I made—suffice it to say, I saw the tear of compassion sparkle in his eye, and heard him declare, I should be permitted to see my children.—He gave me relief with a liberal hand, and at parting, desired I would let him know where to find me, that I might not be again reduced to such misery.</P>
<P>Thus, madam, have I retraced a life of complicated guilt and sorrow. I am fully sensible of the benevolence and candor of your heart, and I trust my unfeigned peni∣tence joined to my sufferings will expunge from your memory my faults. Teach me, dear madam, how to convince you of my gratitude for your great condescension in interesting yourself in the fate of so worthless a being as I am, and whatever plan your

<P>I WAS obliged to send away my last in such a hurry, I had no time to make the least remark on Clara's letter. I will confess the story it contained did not strike me as altogether consistent or probable; but I made great allowances for that self love, which urges us ever to extenuate as much as possi∣ble our errors; and endeavour to set our con∣duct

in the fairest point of view. I also re∣membered, that whatever had been her er∣rors, she was now penitent and in distress; and must, unless some friend stepped forward to save her, sink into an untimely grave. I did not hesitate in resolving to become that friend, though I determined to keep the whole affair concealed from Mrs. Rooksby and Miss Sidney, and, indeed, I inwardly wished that Rooksby might not desire to see Clara's confession, as by reading it he must discover that I had known her before, which would immediately bring on an explanation of her cruel behavior to me, which he would not be very ready to overlook or pardon.—Fortunately he never even expressed the slightest desire to know what she had said. I told him, she should never want a friend, while I had power to assist her; and he seem∣ed perfectly satisfied of the sincerity of my as∣sertion. Accordingly I wrote to her, inform∣ing her if she would mention any place where she would like to reside, I would undertake to pay her board and besides allow something handsome for other necessary expences; but recommended to her to fix her residence in the country, where there would be fewer allurements to draw her from the laudable resolutions she had formed of amendment. I received for answer, that the fondness of a mother impelled her to wish her residence

<P>You will be surprized, my dear Celia, when I tell you, I am become the lady Boun∣tiful of all our poor tenants and their families. I walk round every morning or evening; that the weather permits, and administer to the deseases of both body and mind. In the first I am assisted by a worthy apothecary, who having a large share of merit, Fortune thought he had sufficient, and was therefore extremely sparing of her favours; so that the poor man with a great deal of knowledge in his head, much benevolence in his heart, and a large family in his house, had but very

little money in his purse. I heard of him by accident, and not being extremely well, sent for him, though his unpowdered wig and thread-bare coat would not have been a recommendation, had I consulted his appear∣ance only; but I chatted with him half an hour several mornings successively, and found his company more efficacious than his me∣dicines; for I was always better after his visits, the reason of which was, I thought the doctor himself seemed happier. So one after∣noon, Amelia and I took a stroll across the park, and spent an hour or two with his wife and her six chubby, rosy cheeked chil∣dren, and at parting, contrived it so that at the next visit the doctor came neither in an unpowdered wig or thread-bare coat; since which time he has constantly been our escorte in our visits to the sick. I find money and he finds physic, and I do assure you we are both very well pleased with our several de∣partments. Besides you cannot think how the doctor is rising in reputation, since his appearance is so mended. He is now often seen coming out of the doors of the wealthy, which I hope presages he will one day become wealthy himself.</P>

<P>I am extremely flurried and vexed, indeed I think my evil genius prevailed, when Rooksby first formed an acquaintance with Belger. The man is an unprincipled liber∣tine, and Amelia was greatly mistaken, when she imagined any tie however sacred, would be restriction upon his licentious pas∣sion.—</P>
<P>Rooksby had rode out last evening, Amelia was reading to Mrs. Rooksby, and I imagin∣ing Belger was with my husband, took a book in my hand and strolled out to indulge a contemplative mood, which at that time prevailed over my mind. I rambled far∣ther than I at first intended, and before I was aware of it, the shades of night came on.—The evening was remarkably fine, the moon arose veiled in a fleecy cloud, which served only to increase the glory it could not hide; a gentle zephyr whispered through the trees, and I felt a sensation of gratitude, wonder and delight pervade my soul; whilst admiring, I beheld the beauty of the surrounding scene, at the top of a walk at no great distance from the house, but on a little eminence, there is a summer∣house greatly admired by all the family for
<PB N="107" REF="029439_0437_0FE1182A2ADF43F8"/>
the charming view it commands of an exten∣sive well cultivated country. In this place I had been working in the morning, and in passing it, recollected I had left my work∣bag there, in which was something I wanted. I therefore stepped in with a design of bring∣ing it away. The moon shone through the windows full upon an organ which was pla∣ced there for me to entertain myself with, and as I am fond of solemn music, the still∣ness of the evening and the serenity of every surrounding object inspired me with a wish to touch the instrument. I therefore sat down, and following the impulse of my soul, began the following Hymn to Gratitude:</P>
<LG>

<P>I had sung it over once, and was just re∣peating the last stanza with all the real fer∣vour which at that moment warmed my soul, when hearing a footstep, I turned round and saw Mr. Belger enter the summer house.</P>
<P>"So you are returned," said I, rising from my seat; "but pray where is Rooksby."</P>
<P>"I have not been with him," replied Belger, "nor do I think he is returned. I have been enjoying a far greater pleasure, than any he can meet with abroad. I have been listening to your charming voice, which with such enthusiastic fervour, has been pour∣ing forth the grateful emotions of your soul."</P>
<P>"I have been here some time," said I carelessly, "and I believe it is getting late.
<PB N="109" REF="029439_0439_0FE118346EF19FB8"/>
Pray do not let me interrupt your intended ramble; but I am afraid of taking cold should I remain here any longer."</P>
<P>"You must not go, dearest, loveliest of women, I cannot lose this only opportunity which I have had of speaking to you without observation. Hear me, pity me! From the first moment, that I beheld you, my heart has known neither joy nor peace. In every place, in every hour, sleeping or waking, your image still pursues me. I love, I doat to madness and yet have only the hope of exciting your compassion."</P>
<P>"My contempt sir, you certainly excite, by this unparalled effrontery. I thought Mr. Belger had received my answer on this sub∣ject some years since, and am surprized how∣ever, he then dared to insult an unprotected girl, that he should suppose he might with impunity now repeat those insults to the wife of his friend."</P>
<P>He listened not to what I was saying, but placing himself between me and the door, forcibly seized my hands, and was proceed∣ing to the most romantic professions of plato∣nic love, when I saw Mr. Rooksby coming up the walk. Agitated and distressed beyond measure, I cried "cruel, persecuting Belger,
<PB N="110" REF="029439_0440_0FE1183986F39250"/>
you have exeposed me to the suspicions of my husband, who must suppose a guilty assignation has been the cause of our being alone here at this late hour." I had no time to say more. Mr. Rooksby entered. "why, my dear Meriel" said he, "do you stay out thus late exposing yourself to the dews of the evening," then perceiving Belger, he added, "but you have company with you and, perhaps, I intrude on an agreeable <HI>tete-a-tete."</HI> I endeavoured to compose my agitated spirits, and answer him in a style of raillery; but it was impossible. I discovered by the manner in which he spoke, that the unhappy jealousy of his temper was awaken∣ed, and that it would not be an easy matter to convince him, his suspicions were without foundation, I trembled, as I took hold of his arm; and we proceeded in silence to the house. When we entered, my mother ten∣derly expressed her anxiety and fears of my having taken cold, Amelia too gently chid me for playing truant as she called it. I do not know how I looked, but I am sure I felt very disagreeably. Indeed, the raillery of Amelia, the cold reserve of Rooksby, and the humi∣liating glances of Belger so powerfully affect∣ed my feelings; that I pleaded indisposition and retired to my apartment, where I have given vent to my tears, and in some measure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my heart, by relating the cause of my
<PB N="111" REF="029439_0441_0FE1183E6291CEC8"/>
uneasiness to my friendly Celia. I fear, it will be long before Rooksby will again look on me with tenderness; and when I recollect, the manner of my leaving Mrs. Rooksby and Amelia, the length of time I was absent, and my being found at so late an hour in the summer house with Belger, who no doubt had also been rambling about for some time, though we had but that mo∣ment met. All these circumstances must tend to make me appear guilty of impropri∣ety, if not imprudence. Again and again I repeat it. Belger seems doomed to be the bane of my happiness.</P>
<P>Amelia has just been with me. I informed her of the cause I had for uneasiness. She blamed me for retiring so early, saying it gave me an appearance of conscious guilt, though she was fully sensible that every thought of my heart was purity itself; she bade me assume an air of cheerfulness, as she was afraid that the timid embarrassment that modesty and real innocence ever discovers, when glanced on by the eye of suspicion, would only tend to encrease the doubts Rooksby already harboured. But I hear him coming. I must quit my pen and retire to bed, though greatly I fear, not to rest.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="029439_0442_0FE11843B08A7F98"/>
14<HI>th</HI></P>
<P>When Rooksby entered the apartment, a mixture of sorrow, anger and distress sat on his countenance.—"I thought, madam," said he, "you were indisposed, as you retired so early; but I see you are not in bed yet; but agreeable meditation is certainly more pleasing, than the company of those we dis∣like. Pray do not let me disturb your reve∣rie."—"You speak in riddles, Mr. Rooksby. Whose company did you suppose I fled from, when I left the parlour. Solitude, indeed, was more agreeable than to be in company, and witness the frown of displeasure that sat on your countenance. It was not the head∣ach impelled me to retire; it was a pain more acute."—I could not proceed, but laying my hand on my bosom, the involun∣tary tear choaked my utterance.</P>
<P>"My beloved Meriel, "said he, sitting down by me, and speaking in a softened accent, "do not weep. Those precious tears would melt a heart of adamant: think then, how much they must distress one who glows with unutterable tenderness toward you."</P>
<P>"Ah Rooksby, why, if you really ex∣perience such tender emotions in my favour,
<PB N="113" REF="029439_0443_0FE118470B2A90F8"/>
why have you wounded my heart, by utter∣ing such unkind, I may say, cruel suspicions."</P>
<P>"Meriel", said he, looking at me intent∣ly, "did you not confess you knew Belger some time since at Kensington."</P>
<P>"Most assuredly, I did."</P>
<P>"And during the time of your acquaint∣ance there, did he never express his admi∣ration—his esteem—his love to you."</P>
<P>"How can you ask such a question? He was at that time"—</P>
<P>"Married, you would say," cried he, in∣terrupting me, "but I know he was not, and I remember hearing him once speak of a beautiful creature, he knew at that place, who had more power over his heart than all the rest of the sex put together."</P>
<P>"And therefore, it follows," said I, "that I must be the person he meant (attempting a smile.) My dear Rooksby, if you have such an opinion of your Meriel's attractions, she has a far more humble one of herself."</P>
<P>"But you had certainly been indulging him, this evening, with a long <HI>tete-a-tee."</HI></P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="029439_0444_0FE1184C9AB1E0A8"/>
"You are mistaken, He had not been in the summer house above three minutes before you joined us."</P>
<P>"There is such an ingenuous frankness in your manner, dear girl, that it would be almost a crime to doubt of your sincerity. Yet when I reflect"—</P>
<P>In saying this, he started up and striking his forehead with his hand, he cried, "these doubts will unsettle my reason"—I was ter∣rified, and rising from my seat endeavoured to sooth him. He took my hand and pres∣sing it to his lips, said, "I cannot credit aught to your disadvantage. Your counte∣nance is so expressive of innocence, that it is impossible to believe you otherwise. For∣give my ungenerous conduct. It is the fault of my nature. Forget it, and I will be care∣ful how I offend again." You may be sure, I was not backward in promising a total for∣getfulness of this painful event: but I am sensible, my dear Celia, it is impossible to keep my promise, for though we all met this morning in the same social manner as usual I felt such a restraint upon myself whenever Belger addressed me, and answered the most trifling questions with such evident imbarass∣ment, that to even an indifferent spectator I must have appeared strangely agitated.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="029439_0445_0FE1185042A12C08"/>
Indeed, my friend, I began to wish I had not concealed from Mr. Rooksby any thing, that passed during my residence at Kensing∣ton. If I had informed him of Belger's un∣principled behaviour to me at that place he might not have renewed his intimacy, but I always have an objection to relating any tale whereof I am myself the heroine, and in this point I avoided it, fearing to incur the imputation of vanity, and in so doing, I have incurred that of guilt.—To mention these circumstances now would be impossible, as it would only tend to confirm Rooksby's suspicions, perhaps engage him in a quarrel with Belger and by making it a public affair, cast a blemish on my reputation, which no future conduct will ever wipe off. But I think through the whole course of my life I have been particularly unfortunate in having my most innocent actions misconstrued, and though my own bosom conceals not a wish which does not tend to the universal happiness of mankind in general. I have never want∣ed enemies, who are ever ready to catch at the errors, to which frail mortality is liable; and magnify them into crimes.—I have however a sweet consolation Celia. My heart is conscious of its own integrity and relies on that Power, who knows its innocence to sup∣port it through every trial, which in His wis∣dom He may see proper to lay upon it. This
<PB N="116" REF="029439_0446_0FE118561A2B2C48"/>
is a consolation of which no afflicton, how∣ever severe, can rob me.</P>
<P>Mrs. Rooksby is I fear, in a declining state of health. Age and its attendant in∣firmities bend her frame to the earth; but her mind is still in full vigour. She is the same pious, resigned chearful christian, as ever: and her company is equally sought by the young as well as by those more nearly of her own years. A journey to the south of France is judged necessary for her the ensuing winter. Mr. Rooksby does not wish to leave England; so I have not hinted my desire of accompanying her. Indeed, my present situation would render travelling dan∣gerous, Amelia goes with her, and I mean to invite Susan Mossop to spend the winter with me in town, not that I expect to reap much pleasure from her society; but I think a residence in my family may be of service to her; and should any proper match offer, the want of a fortune shall not be an obstacle, Adieu my friend, your's ever.</P>

<P>SURELY, surely, my friend, I was born to be the sport of fortune; for truly can I say with the Poet,
<Q><L>That e'er the cup of joy could reach my lips,</L>
<L>'Twas dash'd with gall.—</L></Q></P>
<P>I had but just began to taste the supreme fe∣licity of domestic happiness, had began to look forward to rising years of peace and comfort, when this Belger, like a demon of cruelty appears, and all my pleasing pros∣pects vanish—
<Q><L>Like some poor traveller, whom Merlin leads</L>
<L>Thro' fragrant bowers and delicious meads;</L>
<L>And while his feet the magic paths pursue,</L>
<L>And while he thinks the fair illusion true—</L>
<L>The baseless vision melts in fluid air,</L>
<L>And woods and wilds and thorny ways appear.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="029439_0448_0FE1185F4B17A150"/>
Yes, my beloved friend, the sweet enchant∣ing scenes of happiness now fade upon my sight, and like the delusive vision of a disor∣dered imagination, serves only to make the surrounding desolate prospect, the more dark and gloomy.</P>
<P>From the time of my last letter, Mrs. Rooksby's health has evidently become worse and worse every day; so that we were obliged to hasten her departure for the con∣tinent, as the physicians feared the cold au∣tumnal blasts would be too much for her enervated frame to bear. We were busy in preparing for her departure, when one even∣ing just as the sun was set, a little girl came and informed me a poor tenant of our's was taken suddenly ill, and wished very much to see me.—As Amelia was busy in her own apartment, I would not in∣terrupt her to request her company; but taking some cordials with me and bidding Thomas follow, I took hold of the little girl and bid her lead me to the cottage. When I arrived the poor woman told me she had been seized with a sudden fit, and imagining herself dying—she had sent for me to re∣commend her children to my care; but as she now found herself much better, she hum∣bly hoped I would pardon the trouble she had given me. As I had walked very quick, I
<PB N="119" REF="029439_0449_0FE1186261369428"/>
found myself somewhat fatigued and sat down for a few moments to rest. Whilst I sat, I busied myself in making enquiries concerning the poor woman's family, and learnt that she had seven children and a very bad husband.—"I have been in a deal of trouble, madam," said she, "Robin has been very idle this summer and had gotten himself in debt; but we were relieved from our necessities by a gentleman, who is I be∣lieve, at the Hall; for the children say they have seen him there. Oh! madam, he has been the preserver of me and mine, and I am bound to pray for his prosperity." She was eagerly proceeding, when casting my eye toward the window, I saw Belger open the wicket, which served for a gate, and come in.—"Here is your benefactor coming good woman" said I, and slipping two gui∣neas into her hand, went toward the door, but was not quick enough to escape, before Belger entered.—"Bless me my fair host∣ess," said he, in an accent of surprise; "who could have thought of seeing you here; not that it is surprising to see Mrs. Rooksby in the cottage of poverty sweetly alleviating its attendant evils, but the lateness of the hour and to see her without Miss Sidney."</P>
<P>"Amelia was engaged," said I endeavour∣ing to pass him, "and indeed, I did not observe how late it was."—</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="029439_0450_0FE118682D419240"/>
"You will permit me to see you home?'</P>
<P>"By no means Mr. Belger. I have my servant with me."</P>
<P>"Do not, dearest madam, deny me the felicity of walking by your side and enjoying a few moments uninterrupted conversation, a blessing I cannot obtain at the hall."</P>
<P>"Nor can I think, sir, you have any thing to say to me, to which the whole world might not be a witness, I desire you will suffer me to go home alone. I have particular reasons."</P>
<P>"I know your reasons, most lovely, most injured of women. Rooksby is jealous, weary of the possession of the most inestima∣ble treasure, he seeks by accusing your spot∣less purity to excuse his own errors."—</P>
<P>"Stop, Belger, I will listen no longer, Rooksby is too just to suspect the integrity of a heart, with whose very emotion he is acquainted. As to errors I neither suspect him capable of any; derogatory to his own honour or prejudicial to our mutual happi∣ness; and know, sir, the person who would endeavour to awaken suspicion in my bosom, will be ever held as an object of contempt and detestation."</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="029439_0451_0FE1186BA4CF2C08"/>
I then darted at him a look expressive of my honest indignation, and endeavoured to quit the house: but he threw himself on his knees before me, and forcibly taking my hand earnestly requested to be heard for only one moment. From the instant Belger first entered, the woman had from a motive of respect left the room, and my servant was without side the gate, waiting for my coming out.</P>
<P>I was hesitating for an answer, by which I might hope to make him relinquish his de∣sign; when I heard my husband's voice en∣quiring of the servant, "whom he was waiting for?"</P>
<P>"My mistress, sir," replied the man.</P>
<P>"Your mistress is here then—and who is with her?"</P>
<P>"Mr. Belger went in a few moments since."</P>
<P>"Damnation!" exclaimed he, and push∣ing by the man with violence instantly rushed into the house. How I looked, or what I said, I cannot pretend to determine, but of this I am certain my feelings were unde∣scribable.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="029439_0452_0FE118714CDD3680"/>
"It is well, madam," said he, "I have at length discovered the true cause of your frequent rambles toward this cottage, and by heavens."—Rage choaked him, I summoned all my resolution and endeavoured to calm his agitated spirits.</P>
<P>"Frequent rambles, Mr. Rooksby, I do not understand you; I never was at this cot∣tage before, nor should have come now had I not been sent for."</P>
<P>"I know you were sent for. That is the very thing that drives me to madness. Oh! Meriel, to think on the very last evening be∣fore my mother and Miss Sidney leaves Eng∣land, you could quit them and taking advan∣tage of my absence fly on the wings of love to meet your abandoned seducer. But, this is no time for argument; tell me, thou vile reptile, who under the mask of friendship hast dishonoured me, what reparation can you make for the peace you have destroyed, for the purity you have sullied?—</P>
<P>"Dear Rooksby," (said Belger in a tone of dissembling gentleness,) "you are carried away by a wild ungovernable passion, I give you my honour I had not been in the house ten minutes when you entered; nor had I the most distant idea of meeting Mrs. Rooks∣by
<PB N="123" REF="029439_0453_0FE1187607CEBFB0"/>
here, you injure her by these unjust suspi∣cions, and what ought to be at this time a material consideration, you agitate her spirits, impair her health and endanger her valuable life."—</P>
<P>"Belger" said my husband, with a voice that made me tremble, "you are both a cow∣ard and a villain."</P>
<P>"You cannot mean what you say."</P>
<P>"I do," reiterated Rooksby, fiercely.</P>
<P>"Then, sir, to-morrow between five and six o'clock, I shall expect to see you in a proper place to settle this difference. But remember Rooksby, I warn you of the re∣morse that will seize you, when you discover how injuriously you have treated both your wife and friend.</P>
<P>"Belger," said I exerting all the firmness I was mistress of, and laying my hand on his arm, as I spoke.—"If you are not cal∣lous to the voice of humanity, explain this horrid mystery, for I am certain the accidents of this night have been concerted to ruin me in the opinion of my husband. You call yourself his friend. How well you deserve that title your own conscience can best inform
<PB N="124" REF="029439_0454_0FE1084A842ECD00"/>
you, that and the all-seeing eye of a just pro∣vidence knows my innocence, and I trust, it will hereafter, be made appear clear as the noon day sun. In the mean time, dare not as you value your eternal welfare, to lift your impious hand against the life of Rooks∣by; or, by throwing yourself in the way of danger, run the hazard of rushing unprepar∣ed into the presence of your offended Maker, for let honour give it what false gloss it will, the man, who wantonly throws away his life is as much guilty of suicide, as the wretch who ends his existence with a loaded pistol. And in the case of duelling vanquish or be vanquished, you are equally a murderer. Go, leave us, would to heaven, I could say to that peace which was uninterrupted, till your arrival here.—Return to London, or go any where, so as I may not have the weight of bloodshed to drag my almost broken spirit to the earth.</P>
<P>Rooksby started up with fury and snatch∣ing my hand from off Belger's arm, cried—"by heavens you tremble only for him. So as he is safe you care not what becomes of me. But come, madam, let us return, it is almost dark." As he said this, he pulled me rudely from my seat. I attempted to walk; but terror had unnerved my limbs. I sunk down again on the chair, and had
<PB N="125" REF="029439_0455_0FE1188194248E20"/>
not a flood of tears relieved me, I must have fainted. He was alarmed and called the woman to bring some water, and saying he would send the carriage to fetch me as I was unable to walk,—he went out, followed by Belger in sullen silence. When he was gone, my agitation became so great, it threw me almost into hysterics. I was not suffici∣ently mistress of my recollection to ask the woman any questions, but gave vent to my overcharged heart in a torrent of unrestrain∣ed affliction, and when the carriage arrived, threw myself into it almast distracted with the violence of my emotions, where, to my great comfort, I found my kind soothing friend Amelia. I related to her what had just happened; she comforted me all that lay in her power, and told me Belger had retired to his apartment immediately on entering the house, and that Rooksby went to the library, where he was busy writing. She said she would endeavour to see the for∣mer before she went to rest, and persuade him to set off for London, entreated me to hide my uneasiness from Mrs. Rooksby, as her weak state of health would but ill sup∣port the shock of such intelligence, when she supposed us the happiest of the hymenial votaries, and lamented her being obliged to leave me in so disagreeable a situation.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="029439_0456_0FE1188717FBB1B8"/>
I thanked the dear friendly girl; but en∣treated her not to be uneasy; said she could not perform to me a more acceptable service than by attending to the welfare of my mo∣ther, promised to be guided by her advice and bear my afflictions with patience.</P>
<P>And so I will, my dear Celia; for have I not conscious innocence for my support, and is it not my duty to submit without repining, to the will of Him, who never lays on his creatures the rod of affliction but for some wise purpose. He can humble the frail body to the dust the more to exalt the soul. He can cause the bones that he has broken to rejoice, and heal the broken heart. I feel his mercies at this moment abound in the comforts of an approving conscience. I ac∣knowledge his judgments just, and pray only for meekness and resignation to bear his dis∣pensations as I ought.</P>
<P>Celia, I must break off, I am ill; when able I will again continue my narrative. heaven bless you.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XLIX. MERIEL to CELIA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>London,</HI> <DATE><HI>Nov.</HI> 29<HI>th,</HI> 1783.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE been extremely ill since I last ad∣dressed my dear Celia, occasioned by the violent agitation my spirits had undergone. The morning after the disagreeable rencoun∣ter mentioned in my last, I found myself much indisposed; but as it was the day intended for Mrs. Rooksby's departure, I arose at the usual time and endeavoured to appear as chearful as possible, that the dear old lady might not perceive the distress of my mind. Rooksby seemed inspired with the same wish and though he had not spoken to me during the whole night, yet at breakfast assumed his usual tenderness of manner. It was with infinite pleasure I learnt that Belger had set out for town long before any of the family were stirring, leaving only a card to my mother pleading urgent business as his excuse for so precipitate a departure, and wishing her intended journey might have the desired
<PB N="128" REF="029439_0458_0FE1188FE26C4180"/>
effect and restore her to perfect health. At twelve o'clock the chariot drew up to the door—I felt my spirits sink. I looked first at my dear Amelia, then at my mother, and taking a hand from each, pressed them to my heart and burst into tears. It was in vain any longer to hide my sorrows—I saw these invaluable friends departing from me at the very moment when I most wanted their soothing attentions. I looked on my gene∣rous benefactress, perhaps, for the last time. Her wan cheek and emaciated frame, too plainly announced her approaching dissolu∣tion.</P>
<P>I threw my arms round her—I endea∣voured to articulate an adieu—but words were denied me.—"God bless you my dear child," said she. "Clement, be tender of her—comfort her—study her felicity—and may Heaven shower its choicest blessings on you both." She then took up my little Clementina, and letting fall a tear as she pressed the smiling Cherub to her bosom, cried emphatically, "Oh thou sweet angel! Heaven grant that you may live to be an honour to your father and a blessing to your mother—mayest thou be endowed with all her virtues without any of his faults." She then once more embraced me and went to the carriage. Amelia stayed behind a mo∣ment
<PB N="129" REF="029439_0459_0FE118948385FE28"/>
to comfort and re-assure me. She bid me keep up my spirits and trust in that Pow∣er for support, who never yet forsook the innocent.</P>
<P>Rooksby accompanied them some miles on horse back. I followed the chariot with my eyes as long as I could, and then retir∣ing to my chamber, threw myself on the bed, and gave a loose to unutterable sorrow. However the spirit may be afflicted, nature exhausted by various conflicts will insensibly sink under the balmy influence of sleep.—This was my case: I slept about two hours, but awoke unrefreshed, and in acute pain. My head ached, my tongue was parched, and I had every symptom of an approaching fever. However I endeavoured to rise and dress, to be ready to receive Rooksby, as he proposed returning to dinner: but to this task I was unequal. My head was giddy and my limbs trembled. Hester, my woman, was alarmed. She rang for the house-maid, who just came in time to help to support me; for in attempting to go from my bed∣chamber to the dressing-room, I had fainted. On recovering, I found much worse conse∣quences were to be apprehended, than I had at first imagined. I sent immediately for me∣dical assistance and about four o'clock the next morning, I was delivered of a dead
<PB N="130" REF="029439_0460_0FE11899F69C1658"/>
child. For some hours I was totally insen∣ble, and for more than a week my life was despaired of. Rooksby was frequent in his enquiries after my health; but I could plain∣ly perceive, he thought more of the loss of his son than my evidently dangerous situa∣tion. However it pleased Heaven to restore me, though by slow degrees, and the mo∣ment the physicians pronounced me able to bear the fatigue of travelling, I set off for London, vainly hoping that variety of scenes, company and public amusements would re∣store in some measure my lost chearfulness; at least I thought it would banish those cor∣roding reflections which gnawed and goaded my poor lacerated heart. Oh! my beloved Celia, Rooksby no longer retains the small∣est degree of affection for me. In company he is polite, but distant; when by ourselves (which is indeed but seldom) he is cold, un∣kind, and my Celia will hardly believe it, he once on my gently remonstrating on this painful change, struck me, nay cursed me, and called me by a name, my soul shudders to think on. That he hates and despises the woman he once doated on is now become too evident to be doubted; for he has never returned to my apartment since my illness, but occupies one in another part of the house. Susan Mossop is with me. She is possessed of more tenderness and goodness of heart
<PB N="131" REF="029439_0461_0FE1189F0D092498"/>
than I at first suspected. She labours inces∣antly to amuse me, and though I cannot partake of her chearfulness, I am grateful for her attention. Hester is married to a man of genteel fortune, but from what I can judge of the character of both, I think they will pass that kind of insipid life so well de∣scribed by Prior in his epitaph on sauntering Jack and idle Joan.</P>
<L>Nor wished, nor cared, nor laughed nor cried,</L>
<L>And so they lived, and so they died.</L>
<P>I am just returned from an airing in Hyde Park, and have been greatly astonished to see Clara there, whom I left in Devonshire. She was on horse-back, elegantly mounted and attended by a servant in livery. A con∣fused idea ran through my mind, when I first saw her, yet surely she can never add ingratitude to infamy, by seducing the af∣fections of the husband, when she has been rescued from want and misery by the wife, yet, what can have brought her to town, or how is it possible she can afford to appear in the manner just described.—</P>
<P>I am satisfied Rooksby must still hold some intercourse with Clara. We have just had a <HI>tete-a-tete</HI> in which he accused me of de∣ceiving him, of giving him my hand when
<PB N="132" REF="029439_0462_0FE118A428491C40"/>
my heart was devoted to another; and of having been long acquainted with Belger, with whom it was well known, I had an illicit intercourse. Dearest Celia, imagine the agonizing feelings of my heart on being subject to such unjust, such cruel suspicions. It was in vain I attempted to assert my inno∣cence; he was well informed, he said, of every incident that had passed during my residence at Kensington; that I had been the intimate acquaintance of women of light characters; that my own conduct in regard to Belger was notoriously infamous, and that I was in reality the exact reverse of what I had spe∣ciously appeared to his mother, or she never would so strenuously have pressed our union. Oh! my friend, would to heaven, I had trust∣ed to the dictates of my own judgment, had been guided by the impulse of my heart which strongly urged me to reject this man; but compassion, gratitude, and the combined wishes of those whom I most loved and re∣spected, operated so powerfully on my feel∣ings, that I was unable to withstand their solicitations; and Heaven be my witness, I have not in one instance since I have been united to Rooksby infringed the smallest duty incumbent on the sacred character of wife. A letter—it is from Amelia, Heaven grant no ill news.—Read it Celia, I inclose it for your perusal, and wonder not that

<P>IT is with infinite regret, I take up my pen to inform my dear friend, that the flat∣tering appearance of Mrs. Rooksby's re∣turning health, which had so elated my spi∣rits are entirely vanished, and an encreasing debility of frame, baffles all the skill of the physicians and alarms us to an imminent de∣gree. My mind is in such a state of painful anxiety, that I hardly know what I write. When I am present with the dear invalid, I endeavour to command my feelings and ap∣pear

chearful, but the effort is vain, and when I contemplate her pale, yet placid countenance, the tears will involuntarily burst from my eyes. She, this morning, ob∣serving my emotions, called me to the bedside, (from which she is now scarcely able to rise, even while it is making) and ta∣king my hand, "my dear Miss Sidney," said she, "do not let my approaching dissolution give you pain.—I see it draw near with no other apprehension than what frail mortality must feel, when called from a temporal to an eternal state, into the immediate presence of the Creator of the Universe!—I have had my span lengthened out far beyond what I had ever expected.—I feel no regret at leaving this transitory life;—for my only care was centered in the happiness of my son, and him I shall leave happy in the affection of the best, the worthiest of her sex. I know my be∣loved Meriel will feel my loss: But time will mitigate her affliction and she will bear it with the fortitude of a christian. I have one thing to mention, which nearly con∣cerns your happiness. I have a nephew here whom you have seen—Captain Onslow is a man every way worthy the esteem of a woman of sense. He is not insensible to the merit of Miss Sidney, and has requested me to plead his cause. I flatter myself you will not refuse his suit."—She paused. I was
<PB N="135" REF="029439_0465_0FE118B3A08053E8"/>
silent. I had frequently seen and admired Captain Onslow: he is in the East-India service; for though a man of fortune, he prefers a life of activity to one of supine in∣dolence. An indifferent state of health, brought him to Aix-la-Chapelle; but being now perfectly recovered, he proposed rejoin∣ing his regiment, which it is expected will be ordered to Bengal the ensuing season. I should not be thus particular, but know∣ing from some disagreement between Mr. Rooksby and the Captain, you were totally ignorant that you had such a relation, and therefore might wish some information. I had without vanity reason to suspect the Captain's partiality; nor can I with truth assert, that my bosom felt that indifference toward him, which it had ever maintained toward the rest of his sex. Yet Mrs. Rooks∣by taking me at a moment so unprepared, I hesitated, and knew not what to answer. She saw my confusion and then continued, "I have in my will left you a small token of my regard, which if you listen to Onslow's suit, I shall insist on seeing settled on your∣self, if it is not painful, my dear Amelia, I could wish to hear your candid senti∣ments on this subject, and it would give me infinite satisfaction of see you united to so worthy a man before I breathe my last; as the welfare of every one dear to my charming
<PB N="136" REF="029439_0466_0FE118B8F7E2CEF8"/>
daughter-in-law must ever interest my fondest solicitude," I thanked the generous woman in terms of heartfelt gratitude, assured her I was perfectly happy in my present situation, but that if it was my fate to change, I knew of no person I should prefer to Captain On∣slow. My only objection would be the difference subsisting between him and Mr. Rooksby, as I feared it would prevent that social intercourse that I must ever wish to continue uninterrupted between Mrs. Rooks∣by and myself. "I will obviate that objection my dear," said she, "for it shall be my last request to Clement that all animosity be laid aside, as he values my blessing. And now," continued she, with a faint smile, "there remains nothing to be done but for you to take your pen and bid my son and his amiable wife to your nuptials. The jaunt will be of service to Meriel after her late illness, and she will have the double plea∣sure of seeing her beloved friend enter into an honourable and happy marriage, and me into a state of everlasting bliss; and tell her from me she should celebrate the two events as equally joyful." "Oh! my dear madam, said I," in an agony of grief, "do not talk thus, I hope you will recover."—</P>
<P>"Impossible," said she, waving her hand with a solemn yet benignant look, "I have
<PB N="137" REF="029439_0467_0FE118BDDB3C36B8"/>
enquired of the physicians how long they suppose I can remain. They informed me, yesterday, I may possibly continue three weeks or a month longer; but that is the utmost; therefore my dear Amelia, lose no time. I could wish to see my dear children once more, and I am certain the bare men∣tion of that wish will be sufficient to bring them eagerly to me."</P>
<P>Thus, my dear Meriel, have I executed the desire of my almost expiring benefactress; hasten to me my friend that we may pour our affliction into each others bosom, and by participation lighten the burthen that will press so heavy on our hearts. I flatter my∣self the death-bed of an amiable and respected parent will have a good effect on the mind of your unkind truant, and bring him back to a sense of the happiness he is wantonly trifling away. I trust you will use all possible expedi∣tion. I have agreable to Mrs. Rooksby's desire wrote to her son requesting his immediate acquiescence with her wish. Oh! my dear Meriel, my mind is sorely oppressed. I shrink from the though of uniting myself to Captain Onslow at the very moment, when tears of real sorrow will dim the lustre of the hyme∣nial torch: but your better judgment shall in this and every particular direct that of your</P>

<P>From this great theatre of dissipation and folly does Meriel once more address her friend—but why am I not permitted to see you? why in the same kingdom does indispensible duties keep me from flying to you, and in your peaceful cloister burying myself at once from the world and all its sorrows? Alas I too plainly feel that even there I could not now be at peace: for thither should I carry corroding thought, the pangs of disappointed love, the remembrance of abused confidence, ingratitude and ill requited friendship.—Strange scenes have passed, my friend, since I wrote you last; I have hovered on the brink of eternity, from whence I was only snatched to be the victim of future misery; but let me pursue some method in my narrative and carry you back to the time when the receipt of Amelia's letter hurried us to proceed as expeditiously as possible to Aix to catch
<PB N="139" REF="029439_0469_0FE118C86235DFA0"/>
the parting sigh and receive the dying bles∣sing of my last dear parent, my more than mother. Every preparation necessary for our departure was soon made, when the even∣ing previous to the day on which we were to set out, Rooksby came into my dressing room, where I was busy in making some ne∣cessary arrangements with the housekeeper, and bidding her quit the room sat down be∣side me, and looking with more complacency than he had lately done, when addressing me, said, "I have unknown to you Meriel made a little addition to our party to the continent, and flatter myself it will not be disagreeable."—I believe I looked surprized when I replied, "had our journey been one of pleasure I could certainly have no objec∣tion to any person, whom he should think proper to join us, but on so mournful an oc∣casion I must suppose the presence of a stran∣ger"—</P>
<P>"It is not a stranger," said he (interrupt∣ing me eagerly,) "it is poor Clara."</P>
<P>"Clara, sir?" in a tone of angry surprize.</P>
<P>"Yes, my dear," he answered hesitatingly, "She is in a bad state of health; I met her lately by accident. She cannot well afford so long a journey; and it is a good opportu∣nity."</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="029439_0470_0FE118CD767F08D8"/>
"Rooksby said I," fixing my eyes upon his face: I think you know me well enough to be certain that if Clara is really ill and in want, she has a claim to every tender office of humanity from me as a fellow-creature, but"—</P>
<P>"Nay, Meriel, no buts: surely (affecting a smile) "you are not jealous?"—"No, sir, you may rest quite easy on that head. I can∣not think so meanly of you as to suppose af∣ter what had passed you would again be the dupe of an artful woman; for however my compassion may have been awakened toward Clara, I cannot help thinking her a woman capable of the basest duplicity."</P>
<P>"She is going to be married to Belger," said he, endeavoring to hide his evident em∣barrassment under the mask of carelessness.</P>
<P>"But I hope, sir, he is not to join us!" said I, reddening with indignation at the re∣membrance of past injuries, which I could now trace to their right source.</P>
<P>"No, he will follow Clara to Aix, and if my mother dies, we shall all spend the win∣ter in Paris."</P>
<P>The evident composure with which he mentioned such an afflicting circumstance,
<PB N="141" REF="029439_0471_0FE118D0D68C3780"/>
out me to the soul.—"You speak of your mother with great indifference," said I, and the tears gushed from my eyes.</P>
<P>"Indifference, no, indeed I am extremely sorry; but you know, my dear, she is an old woman, and we must expect it, and that you know prepares us for the stroke, and prevents the shock we should otherwise feel. I have been thinking," continued he after a little pause, "that I shall have the Hall pulled down next summer and built in a more modern stile."</P>
<P>I turned from him with silent contempt and resting my cheek upon my hand gave a loose to melancholy reflections. Celia I have been deceived in this man. He has no heart, no sensibility; every feeling of his soul is absorbed in self. Why, why was my fate united to such a man. I was roused from my reverse by a loud knock at the door.—"That is Clara," said he, starting up. "I desired she would sleep here, that we might be ready to set off together in the morning." I felt a faint chillness seize me as he spoke. I believe my voice faultered as I said, go down then and receive her; I will just take one more look at my dear little girl and join you immediately." When he had left the room I sunk motionless on the sopha. "Good heaven," said I, "and is it come to this. Can
<PB N="142" REF="029439_0472_0FE118D6624CF5C8"/>
it be possible, that the man whom I have pro∣mised to love and honour should thus forget what is due to me, to his child and to him∣self? But I will not judge too rashly, conti∣nued I, rising and drying my eyes. Per∣haps they may not be guilty. Jealousy magni∣fies every object, and construes even laudable actions into crimes." I then visited the nurse∣ry and having passed a few minutes in cares∣sing my little Clementina, I descended to the drawing room where I found Clara negligent∣ly seated on a sopha by Rooksby, and Susan Mossop playing on the Piano Forte. Clara rose from her seat, coloured and hesitatingly said something about intrusion. I confess I was not less embarrassed myself; however I paid her the civilities necessary as being my guest and we immediately went to supper, soon after which I retired on pretence of mak∣ing some further preparations, and having given orders about an apartment for Clara, I sat down and wrote a few lines to Susan re∣questing, as she intended staying in town, till she heared from us the result of our voyage and whether we returned or past the winter on the continent, that she would be particu∣larly attentive to the child, and in case of her father's sending for her begged she would accompany her to Paris. This I did by let∣ter, being sensible I should have no time to speak to her in the morning; and I did not
<PB N="143" REF="029439_0473_0FE118DB1498EB30"/>
think proper to send for her up stairs at that time. Early in the morning our post coach was at the door, and by six o'clock Mr. Rooksby, Clara, myself and Lester my wo∣man were seated in it; and we proceeded with all imaginable speed to Dover. Rooksby immediately on our arrival sent to speak to the master of a Packet. We found it was impossible to think of embarking till the next morning, and were informed by the man that a gentleman and lady just arrived from town had taken their passage on board his vessel. While we continued talking, a gen∣tle tap at the door interrupted us, and on its being opened who should enter but Mrs. Kingly. It was a most agreeable surprize to me, though I believe not so to Rooksby. "Well met my dear cousin," said she, af∣fectionately saluting me, "it is fortunate that we should both be travelling the same way. I saw your livery in the yard and im∣mediately made my enquiries." Kingly is gone out, so you see I took the opportunity and eloped to you; but when he returns I am sure he will be as happy as myself to pay you his respects." While she was speaking she did not notice who was in the room, and, indeed, Clara sat in an obscure corner by the fire, but as she finished the last sentence, turning hastily round she saw her; but not recognizing her immediately cried, "I fear
<PB N="144" REF="029439_0474_0FE118E0463A2978"/>
I am guilty of rudeness, you have company."—"No one particular," said I. It is only Mrs. Moreton." Clara was now under the necessity of rising; Mrs. Kingly started and curtsying formally, while she gave Rooksby a most expressive look, said she could not have expected to see Mrs. Moreton in this party, not knowing we were acquainted. I really felt for Clara; her colour varied from red to pale and from pale to red, till I thought she would have sunk. Rooksby looked mor∣tified, and I only slightly said, that Mrs. More∣ton having but indifferent health wished to try the air and weather of Aix, and we having an empty seat in the coach I had offered it to her.—Mrs. Kingly looked inquisitive, as much as to say, "do you know who she is." But she repressed the impulse of curiosity and made enquiries after my dear mother, whom she did not know till then, was in so dange∣rous a state.</P>
<P>In about an hour Kingly came in, when after the first salutations were past, he be∣gan to recognize Clara, I think it would be impossible to give you an adequate idea of the anger and contempt that agitated his expressive countenance, her presence was a restraint upon us all, it checked conver∣sation, we were for some moments silent and embarrassed—she saw it and guessing the
<PB N="145" REF="029439_0475_0FE118E604263D98"/>
cause, complained of weakness and fatigue and ringing for a light retired to her chamber.</P>
<P>She was no sooner gone than Kingly cried "why Mrs. Rooksby, how long have you been acquainted with that woman."</P>
<P>"Some time," I replied affecting as much ease as possible.</P>
<P>"Had you any knowledge of her before you were married?"</P>
<P>"O yes, I knew her very well; come I know what you would say, but I shall stop you at once; her former errors are nothing to me; at present she is in distress. It was in my power to render her a trifling service, and I only followed the dictates of huma∣nity."</P>
<P>"Neglecting those of common prudence," interrupted he tartly.</P>
<P>"Pshaw! nonsense," I replied laughing, "do not let us talk any more about her."</P>
<P>"You are the most unaccountable wo∣man," said he, "that ever existed, I declare
<PB N="146" REF="029439_0476_0FE118EB1B215FA0"/>
if almost half your life is not an inexplicable riddle."</P>
<P>"My dear," said Mrs. Kingly, to turn the conversation, "my cousins have taken their passage in the same packet with us; so we shall cross the channel together." This had the desired effect; we insensibly fell into mutual enquiries concerning the motives of our intended voyage: the conversation be∣came by degrees cheerful, and Clara was for the moment forgot. I found that Mr. and Mrs. Kingly were merely on a jaunt of plea∣sure, and that we should have their company no farther than Calais, as they intended to proceed to Brussels. But, my dear Celia, vain are the appointments of man; we look forward to many coming years, we mark out plans of future pleasure and enjoyment: and cry, Thus we will do, and thus. When sud∣denly the unexpected blasts of adversity pass over us, the beauteous vision fades before our sight, while darkness clouds and tempest shut the expected joys forever from our view, and hurl them far beyond our reach.</P>
<P>Like some poor hind, who during the fa∣tigues of the day, had looked often wishfully toward a distant shady grove, where he might repose from the scorching noon-day sun.—"When my daily task is ended," says he,
<PB N="147" REF="029439_0477_0FE118EE0F2B1268"/>
"I will retire there, and as I rest my weary limbs, enjoy the cool refreshing breezes as they pass over the banks of flowers." These reflections sweeten his toil, and he tastes a thousand times by anticipation the pleasures he expects to enjoy. At length the hour arrives, he quits his labour and hastily flies to the scene of fancy, promised bliss. "How delightful is the cooling shade," he cries, as he draws near the grove; "how charming the gurgling of the clear stream that glides over the pebbles and falls into a bason formed by nature; how delicious the fruit that hangs from the trees and courts the hand to gather them. Oh! I could live and die in so sweet a place. How happy I shall be, when I reach it, and stretch my weary limbs on the soft grassy turf."—Alas! poor swain, dost thou not see the sun is sunk beneath the hills, the gloom of evening comes on apace, and e'er thou canst reach thy desired haven, the clouds of night will obscure its beauties from thy view, and the chilly dews prevent your tak∣ing the repose you so ardently wish fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LII. MERIEL to CELIA. IN CONTINUATION.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Paris,</HI> <DATE><HI>January</HI> 30, 1784.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WE passed the night as proposed at Do∣ver, and at an early hour were called to go on board the packet, the wind and tide both favouring us. We embarked before it was well light, and the wind freshening as we proceeded we were soon obliged to retire to our cabins, being seized with the sickness incident to those, who are unused to the boisterous element.—For some time we were too ill to pay much attention to the motion of the vessel, but at length I thought it was very violent, and enquired of Kingly, if it was usual to be so much tossed about in crossing the channel; his reply alarmed me; "the wind is changed," said he, "and the clouds threathen a boisterous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; we shall make good sailors of you all, for I do not
<PB N="149" REF="029439_0479_0FE118F6DEE1D2A0"/>
think you will reach Calais to-day, at least not till late in the evening."</P>
<P>Soon after this the wind increased to a tremendous degree, and I saw by Kingly's countenance that he was uneasy. He went frequently upon deck; then returned to the cabin, endeavoured to chear us, and said he had advised the Master to turn back as the wind was so much against us, and we should not feel the surges so much, when we went before it. Happy would it have been for us all, if this advice had been taken while day∣light remained; but the man was obstinate, and continued beating about till nearly the close of day; then finding it impossible to make his intended port, attempted to return to Dover. As night came on, the storm increased, and though so late in the season was attended with the most vivid lightning and heavy claps of thunder; the sea was unusually agitated, the wind varying almost every instant and resting at no settled point. It is impossible, my dear Celia, to give you an adequate idea of the horrors of our situ∣ation in so small a vessel, driving about at the mercy of the waves and wind in a night, the pitchy darkness of which was only alle∣viated by lightning, which served to give us momentary views of the surrounding dan∣gers. And how shall I tell my dear Celia,
<PB N="150" REF="029439_0480_0FE118FC649F0000"/>
that in the midst of this distress and terror, I had one pang to encounter more acute by far than the near approach of expected death. Rooksby attached himself entirely to Clara. All his care, all his anxious solicitude was expressed for her. We had all risen from our beds, Kingly supported his wife in his arms. "My dear boys," said she, "Hea∣ven protect them."—"Heaven will pro∣tect us all, I hope my love," said he, pas∣sing his hand across his eyes.</P>
<P>Rooksby sat in a distant corner of the cabin beside Clara, who rested her head up∣on his shoulder. Sad and solitary, I sup∣ported myself against a table, that was fas∣tened to the cabin floor, and resigning my∣self to that Power, who could in an instant either rescue us from impending death, or plunge us at once into eternity—thus gave the reigns <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o reflection. Through every scene of my past life, how large has been my portion of misery, and how small com∣paratively, my allotment of joy: then why, coward soul, dost thou shrink from the friendly stroke, that will set thee free from the heavy clog of mortality, and lift thee above these regions of transitory, fading joys, to one where pleasure will be immuta∣ble, unchangeable and can never end!—Oh! Almighty Father of the Universe, weary as
<PB N="151" REF="029439_0481_0FE119012FCB2B20"/>
my pilgrimage has been, I acknowledge thy mercies have been ever beyond my deserts; to thee then do I commit myself—do with me as thou wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>—only; Oh! benignant Crea∣tor, grant me a portion of meekness and re∣signation equal to my afflictions. Thou art the Father of the fatherless; under thy pro∣tecting care my child will ever be secure. Do thou never forsake her in the hour of trial, and of thy mercy, grant she may never forget thee. Forgive my manifold offences, as from my soul I pardon every offence I may have received from my fellow-creatures. As these reflections passed through my mind, I felt a calm serenity take possession of my soul. I looked with an eye of complacency on Clara and Rooksby, whose horrors were de∣picted on their pale countenances, I even wish∣ed them peace of mind and fortitude to meet the impending danger as they ought. This world seemed fleeting from before my eyes, and I looked forward with humble hope, to that which was to come.</P>
<P>"Chearily! chearily! my dear cousin," said Kingly, taking my hand, which hung motionless by my side, "come, come, we are worth half a dozen dead folks yet.—'Tis a tight little vessel—my life for it, we weather the storm, and this will be a season∣ing
<PB N="152" REF="029439_0482_0FE11906A2051370"/>
for you. You will not be easily fright∣ened after this."</P>
<P>"My dear Mrs. Rooksby," said Mrs. Kingly, laying her hand on that of mine, which her husband held, "how much rea∣son you have, to hate me, and all my fa∣mily."</P>
<P>"Hush," said I, (frightened, least she was going to reveal my secret) believe me, I love and respect all of your family, whom I have ever known."</P>
<P>"Do not say so, thou much injured wo∣man, look there, (pointing to Rooksby) You cannot esteem that wretch, and yet you are linked to him for life, while the only man capable of rewarding virtue like yours: but no matter, 'tis I have done it all, and I deserve to be unhappy."</P>
<P>I was greatly distressed to hear her talk in this manner. But before I could inter∣rupt her, she thus continued.</P>
<P>"We are now, my dear cousin, hovering on the brink of eternity. Which of us, or whether any may escape the horrors of this awful night, heaven alone can tell; but we have both children. Promise me then my
<PB N="153" REF="029439_0483_0FE1190B899EB908"/>
friend, should you survive, to be a mother to my poor babes, while they shall require a mother's tender care: and should it be my fate to escape and yours to perish; here in my Maker's sight, I swear to consider your Clementina as my own child."</P>
<P>She had hardly spoke, when a severe shock which the vessel received convinced us we had struck on some rocks, and immediate∣ly from the deck issued a confused noise of "lost! gone! all is over!"</P>
<P>Rooksby started from his seat and clasp∣ing Clara in his arms, rushed upon the deck: Kingly did the same by his wife. The love of life still prevailed over the sense of misery and I followed them as well as I was able, crawling on my hands and knees up the steps. Kingly met me just as I had reached the top and taking me in his arms carried me to his wife. Here a new scene of horror discover∣ed itself; the day had begun to dawn just enough to shew us that we were on a reef of rocks which ran a considerable distance from the shore, and that the rage of the breakers, while the wind continued so violent would prevent any boat from coming to our assistance.</P>
<P>"See," cried Mrs. Kingly, "there is no hope." I could not answer.—We sunk upon
<PB N="154" REF="029439_0484_0FE11910A6B0CCE8"/>
the deck folded in each others arms, Kingly knelt beside and endeavoured to support us, and thus in silent agony, we waited the ex∣pected shock when our vessel would fall to pieces.</P>
<P>But it was near two hours before this event took place. At length unable to with∣stand the repeated shocks, she parted and I saw Rooksby and Clara plunged into the waves.</P>
<P>My terrors and grief here became too great for human nature to support and I lost all sense of my sufferings. How long I re∣mained insensible I cannot tell, but on re∣covering my recollection, I found myself alone on the wreck, slightly fastened to it by a small cord, that was passed round my waist and tied to a ring on the remaining part of the deck.</P>
<P>The terrors which at that moment took possession of my mind, are still too fresh in my memory to suffer me to proceed.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LIII. MERIEL to CELIA. IN CONTINUATION.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Paris,</HI> <DATE><HI>Feb.</HI> 2<HI>d.</HI> 1784.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I CONTINUED in this situation but a few moments—when I heard a faint voice call "Meriel," I turned my head and saw Kingly emerging from the sea and holding by part of the wreck—"Oh, Heavens!" said I, "are you alive then, and is there any chance of escaping?"—"Some little chance," said he, coming near me and beginning to nutie the cord that was round me.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="029439_0487_0FE1191BC6A99CB8"/>
"But where is Mrs. Kingly?"—"Safe, I hope," he replied, "I have conveyed her on board a coasting vessel, which you may see at no great distance from us; but which cannot come nearer on account of the wind blowing strong in shore, and the sea running so high a boat could not live in it. Come, my dear Meriel, throw off the most cumbrous part of your dress, the chance of saving you is but very small; yet, should I be so happy, I shall esteem myself blest be∣yond expression, and should I fail, I shall at least have the satisfaction of dying with the only woman I ever loved with ardency and sincerity."</P>
<P>"No, Kingly," said I, "if my life can only be preserved at the hazard of your's, leave me, I beseech you, to my fate. I am a poor forlorn creature of no consequence to any one:—here let me lay down the burthen of painful existence!—Do you return to your amiable wife. You may alone survive the fury of the waves; but en∣cumbered with me, it will be impossible. Go, my kind, my dear friend, be a father to my child, and sometimes think on her unhappy mother."</P>
<P>"Cease, dear Meriel, cease, thus to wound my heart, and trifle with the pre∣cious moments in which I may snatch you
<PB N="5" REF="029439_0488_0FE1192099B72CF8"/>
from impending death. I once had fondly hoped to live only to render you happy;—but since fate has ordered it otherwise, I will preserve your life or perish in the at∣tempt."</P>
<P>"Oh Kingly," I replied, "leave me, let me die while I am innocent. This gene∣rous conduct awakens all the softness of my soul, and should I live, I shall live only to endure the tortures of hopeless love, ren∣dered doubly agonizing by the pang of con∣scious guilt."</P>
<P>"Dearest, best of women," said he, "let me but preserve you, and certain I am that the rectitude of the heart that can harbour such fears will ever preserve you from the guilt it dreads."</P>
<P>The wind now seemed a little to abate. I plainly saw the vessel coming nearer—"Now is the time," said he, almost forci∣bly tearing off my upper garments, and binding a long shawl tight round my waist, he fastened it to his arm, and catching me up plunged into the water. I now became once more insensible, nor do I remember the least circumstance that followed, till I awoke, as it were, from a profound sleep, and found myself in a bed on board a small dirty ves∣sel.
<PB N="6" REF="029439_0489_0FE1192628841DB8"/>
I raised my head from the pillow and the first object which met my eyes, was Kingly on the opposite side of the cabin, ap∣parently dead.—Mrs. Kingly with a pale haggard countenance hanging over him; and stretched on a mattress, which was spread on the cabin floor, lay Clara and Rooksby just recovering from a state of insensibility. Weak as I was I desired to be lifted from the bed and crawling to that on which my preserver lay, I began to enquire what means had been used for his recovery. I found eve∣ry proper, every probable method had been tried without effect; they also informed me, that he was alive, when they took us up, but immediately on his getting on board, na∣ture exhausted with the exertions he had made to save me, had given way at once, and he sunk lifeless on the deck. Tortured almost to madness by this account, I entreat∣ed them to re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew their applications—nay, weak and exhausted as we were, both Mrs. Kingly and myself joined our endeavours, while Rooksby and Clara drank a little bran∣dy and water, and being covered up warm, fell into a profound sleep. For more than two hours we continued our applications without the least appearance of success; at length I was convinced I felt a faint palpi∣tation of the heart. I mentioned my hopes to his wife, who thought the same. This
<PB N="7" REF="029439_0490_0FE11929ACB72C90"/>
gave us fresh courage, and in less than ano∣ther hour we had the superlative felicity of seeing him open his eyes. The rapturous expressions of joy that burst from Mrs. Kingly on this token of returning anima∣tion are better imagined than described, nor was mine far short of what she expressed.—No sooner were we ascertained of perfect success by his gently pressing our hands and saintly articulating, "God bless you both," than bursting into tears of the most exult∣ing rapture, we sunk on our knees, and as we wept on each others bosom, poured forth our thanks to that benignant Power, who had crowned our humble exertions with success.</P>
<P>Never Celia! no never! till that moment did I fully comprehend what real joy was: the tide of delight that rushed upon my heart when I heard him articulate the words "God bless you," more than compensated for all the anguish I had ever endured. The vessel which had taken us up, was bound to Calais, whither it now bent its course; the elements growing much calmer, and the wind becom∣ing more favourable, and we were once more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on Terra Firma by three o'clock the next day.</P>
<P>I find the place, on which we were wreck∣ed is a dangerous reef on the Sussex coast,
<PB N="8" REF="029439_0491_0FE1192FB2A04420"/>
fortunately, only one life was lost and that was poor Lester, as the vessel which preserved us seeing our distress came as near as they possibly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould in hopes of rendering us some assistance; Rooksby is an expert swimmer and Clara a woman of intrepid spirit.</P>
<P>We resolved on staying a day or two at Calais to recruit our spirits. Indeed we all found ourselves astonishingly recovered after a good nights rest, except Mrs. Kingly, who appeared weak and languid, was unable to sit up and in the course of the day was seized with alarming faintings. Medical assistance was called in, but they declared her frame had received so severe a shock that in all human probability she would fall into a rapid decline; however change of scene, chearful company, and invigorating medicines might prove great restoratives.—This was a heavy stroke to poor Kingly. We were unable to stay any longer than the next day with him and it was evident that his Margaret would not be able to travel so early. But there was no alternative; my mother's danger pressed us to pursue our journey, and accordingly the next morning we took leave of the droop∣ing patient angel, and her afflicted husband, and set forward for Aix, flattering ourselves that a few days would bring them to join us.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="029439_0492_0FE11934B7EC0658"/>
On our arrival at Aix, Clara left us, and we proceeded to my mother's. Amelia met us at the door. "Is she yet alive?" said I eagerly pressing forward. "She is," replied Amelia, but greatly distressed. "We heard a packet was lost and feared it was the one in which you had embarked."—Before I could answer I found myself in Mrs. Rooksby's chamber. The dear woman held out her hand to me as I entered; but was unable to speak. Rooksby approached her bed-side, took her other hand, and pressed it to his lips with reverence; but we all remained si∣lent, I was pleased to see he still retained sensibility enough to be shocked at his mo∣ther's altered appearance. When she was a little recovered, "my dear children," said she, pressing our hands, "it diffuses a tran∣sient gleam of pleasure over my heart to see you once more, and to see you safe and happy; how have you left my sweet Clementina, was she well? does she remember her grand∣mother?"—I assured her she was in health, and if any thing could remain on her infant mind, it must be the sense of her grandmo∣ther's kindness and affection.—She smiled approbation, then turning to Rooksby—"Clement," said she, "you are arrived in good time to close my eyes and to smooth my passage to the grave, by passing an act of amnesty with your amiable relation Captain
<PB N="10" REF="029439_0493_0FE11939D96B4748"/>
Onslow. Come, promise me that the tri∣fling cause of your dispute shall be no more remembered, and that you will rank him among the choicest of your friends. I know he longs to convince you, that his affection toward you is unaltered."</P>
<P>"Your wish, my dear madam," he re∣plied, "must be to me a law. All our former differences are from this moment forgotten."—"'Tis well," said she; "then to-morrow I hope to see my dear Miss Sidney exchange the name of virgin for that of wife. I shall then have nothing more to wish in this world.</P>
<P>Amelia made no affected objections to this proposal, and that evening Captain Onslow took his tea with us. When the articles were signed, in which he settles on my dear Amelia, five thousand pounds, which was the bequest Mrs. Rooksby mentioned to have made in her will; he also presented her with a very handsome watch, a pair of bracelets sat with brilliants and a pair of diamond earings. The next morning she accepted his hand at the altar with that modest re∣serve, free from every prudish affectation of bashfulness, which ever distinguishes the real woman of sense.</P>
<P>From that time no material occurrence took place for three or four days; only that
<PB N="11" REF="029439_0494_0FE1193DE5CA1668"/>
I observed my mother seemed more chearful, and I flattered myself that our united atten∣tions might contribute to her restoration, I carefully concealed not only from her, but even from Amelia, the cause I had for sor∣row, as I knew it would pain their friendly hearts, without in the least relieving the an∣guish of my own; though I knew by the frequent and long absences of Rooksky, that the chief part of his time was devoted to Cla∣ra. But why, thought I, should I give my dear Amelia a bad opinion of a state, into which she had just entered, by revealing to her the art, the duplicity cruelty and perfidy of which man is capable. Will it not lead her to fear a future change in the husband, who is now so fondly attached to her. Was not Rooksby once as fond of me, Oh! had he been like Kingly, hither tended all my reflections on the subject, I was terrified to find myself making these comparisons and strenuously endeavoured to chase from my mind the only object on which it could dwell with de∣light and grateful tenderness.</P>
<P>But these ideas were soon interrupted by the intrusion of some still more painful. My dear Mother was one morning seized with a sit of coughing and expired before I could reach her apartment, though I was called the instant the attendants perceived her danger,
<PB N="12" REF="029439_0495_0FE119431FE65DD8"/>
though her death was hourly expected by those about her, I had vainly flattered myself she might recover; I therefore felt her sudden departure the more severely, and as if my heart was not already overcharged with af∣fliction on the second day after her decease, Amelia entered my apartment with a letter open in her hand. There was an air of me∣lancholy and surprise about her countenance, which awakened my curiosity. My thoughts instantly reverted to England and my child. "Is Clementina ill"—cried I, eagerly, snatching at the letter.—"No!" she repli∣ed, folding it up and putting it in her pock∣et, while she calmly seated herself beside me, "the letter is not from England."—"Are you sure of that Amelia," said I, looking at her with a scrutinizing eye. "Per∣fectly so, my dear Meriel, but have you no other friends, in whose welfare you are in∣terested beside those you left in England." "Perhaps it is from Kingly?"—"You are right," she replied, "and the contents are so much less dreadful than your mind for∣boded, that I think I may commit it to your perusal."</P>
<P>"Poor Margaret is worse, I sear," said I, as I took the letter. She made me no an∣swer, and I read it with a composure at which I have since been astonished. I send
<PB N="13" REF="029439_0496_0FE11945A302A580"/>
you a copy, and believe me, Celia, every line as I retraced it, has been wet with my tears.</P>
<P>Farewell, my dear girl, methinks you must be weary of a correspondent who writes only on melancholy themes.—Ah! my Ce∣lia, the miserable know no luxury equal to that of dwelling on their sorrows, and weep∣ing over their source. In this you have ever indulged me, and it is a privilege I shall not easily forego.—Adieu! God bless you.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LIV. MR. KINGLY to MISS SIDNEY.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He did not know of her marriage with Captain Onslow.</NOTE></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Calais,</HI> <DATE><HI>Jan.</HI> 13<HI>th,</HI> 1784.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MISS SIDNEY is the friend of Meriel Howard (for I will not call that dear woman by the name of her unworthy hus∣band;) to her then I may address myself and pour forth the sorrows that lie heavy at my heart.</P>
<P>Oh, Amelia! unless you could for a mo∣ment place yourself in my situation, you can have no idea of my wretchedness. My wife! my friend! my lovely! and beloved! Margaret is no more. I have taken up my pen to inform you of her placid, her hea∣venly end:—but I feel I am unequal to the task.—I must pause.—My tears will flow.—in such a cause the bravest need not blush to indulge their sensibility.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="029439_0498_0FE1194F31434460"/>
I am more composed—I have gazed on the serene countenance of my departed angel, and gathered fortitude from the re∣membrance of her virtues; from that blessed assurance, that the stroke which pierces my heart has secured to her felicity which will never end.</P>
<P>The disorder which alarmed us so much, by its appearance, before Rooksby left Ca∣lais, terminated in an inflammation on the lungs and a putrid sore throat occasioned by the cold the dear creature had taken and the agitation her spirits had undergone. It made rapid advances. She knew her own danger, and seemed resigned to quit the world, only that her heart yearned for her children: but even when she thought of them, her pious soul extracted consolation from the reliance she placed on a divine guardian and protector to whom she solemn∣ly recommended them.</P>
<P>Just before the last awful scene was closed, she called me to her bed-side, "Kingly," said she, "I am going.—Four years of su∣perlative felicity is as much as humanity can expect. I am resigned to my fate, and hum∣bly
<PB N="16" REF="029439_0499_0FE1195450BED5B0"/>
thank my bountiful Creator that I have not lived to know the privation of your af∣fection. That, my dear Frederic, I fear would have been a trial to which my forti∣tude would have proved unequal. I need not recommend my children to your care. I am satisfied you will never forget you are a father."</P>
<P>I assured her of my constant attention and undeviating affection to those dear pledges of our love, and begged she would not too much exhaust herself by talking.</P>
<P>"I must speak, my love," said she, "Alas! in a few hours that power will be denied me. I have something of importance to say. You have been vilely deceived. Mrs. Rooks∣by ever loved you.—She is truth and purity itself."—</P>
<P>She was proceeding, when a kind of con∣vulsion seized her—and she recovered only to speak in incoherent sentences—"Be the unalterable friend—She is worthy—In my cabinet you will"—She endeavoured to finish the sentence, but in vain—her eyes closed—her gentle spirit fled forever!—</P>
<P>The anguish of my heart is better imagin∣ed than described. Though I ever endea∣voured
<PB N="17" REF="029439_0500_0FE11957ADF3FA20"/>
to promote the happiness of my Mar∣garet; yet, when I reflect that I did un∣doubtedly love another, and that however, by the most grateful attention, I endeavour∣ed to veil my feelings from her, yet she knew the situation of my heart, and knew the worth of the object. I cannot but fear it hurt her sensibility and preyed upon her spirits.</P>
<P>I shall immediately return to England to attend her remains to their last dreary man∣sion, settle my children, dismiss my servants and solicit immediate employment; for idle∣ness will only be the nurse of affliction, and it is my duty to live and endeavour to re∣cover my spirits that I may attend to the dear bequests of my Margaret, be father! mother! every dear relation to her children, and the firm friend of—I need not write her name. I have sometimes thought her capricious and inconsistent, but the words "you have been viley deceived," have awak∣ened sentiments in my bosom, which it is im∣proper to indulge, tell her, my dear madam that while I live, I shall consider myself as bound to support! honour! and protect her! Alas! what right have I to protect her? is she not the wife of another?—Yes she is,—but that other is a villain, as such every man
<PB N="18" REF="029439_0501_0FE1195D5F9E40E8"/>
of honour and sensibility has a right to step forward in her defence.</P>
<P>"She is purity itself"—true but that pu∣rity cannot excel the pure the friendly affec∣tion that glows in my breast. A person who looks not beyond the surface of things, may think that these expressions are an insult, a sure mark of disrespect, to the memory of my departed Margaret, but you my dear madam will consider them as they are meant a proof of my confidence in her veracity, a wish to fulfil her last desire. Meriel is the wife of Rooksby.—My soul ever abhorred seduction of any kind; but to seduce a wife! a mother! horror! infamy!—the wealth of Indus, the joys of paradise would not tempt me to such a measure. No, Margaret no! my beloved partner. Meriel may be the adopted mother of your children, may im∣plant in their minds those virtues which have supported her under all her afflictons, but for me, I will seek employment abroad, and fly from trials, which might be too powerful for me.</P>
<P>I have just received Rooksby's letter in∣forming me of the death of his mother, and your union with Captain Onslow. May
<PB N="19" REF="029439_0502_0FE11960ACB2A080"/>

<P>MY dear Celia may perhaps be surprized that we did not attend the remains of our revered mother to England: but the obstinacy of Rooksby was not to be over come, and I was afraid to leave him lest by my absence I should appear to give a sanction to a connection which though I could not entirely prevent, I was determined as much as possible to interrupt. My friendly Amelia
<PB N="20" REF="029439_0503_0FE119663AA50FC0"/>
and her husband were returning to England, and proposed seeing the last duties fulfilled to my beloved parent, while I heavily and unwillingly attended Rooksby to Paris, where we were soon joined by Clara and Belger, the former of whom has now thrown aside all restraint, appearing publicly as the mis∣tress of Rooksby. Her house and establish∣ment are elegant; she gives splendid enter∣tainments, and though her infamy is well known, she is courted, followed and cares∣sed by the fashionable world; while I am left a poor solitary creature, in the midst of a busy multitude, without friend or com∣forter.</P>
<P>The parting with Amelia was like sever∣ing soul and body. I felt as if in losing her, I lost all support, for though I am sen∣sible, that you, my dear Celia, compassion∣ate all my sufferings, yet secluded as you are from the world, you cannot participate the sorrows of which you have no idea. I remember, once in the moment of exulting happiness, I condemned the torpid gloom of a monastic life. Alas! have I not since had sufficient cause to wish, that torpor, that insensibility had been mine. Yet why should I repine? why utter so ungrateful a wish, since had I never mingled in the active scenes of life though I might have escaped the
<PB N="21" REF="029439_0504_0FE1196B010853F8"/>
knowledge of a Clara, Belger, or Rooksby, I should also never have known the transcen∣dent worth of Amelia Sidney and Frederic Rainsforth.</P>
<P>Rooksby proposes remaining here till June, I could almost wish time would double the ra∣pidity of his motion and hasten the hour when I shall again embrace my Clementina. Hea∣ven protect my child, and shield her from the afflictions that have almost bowed to the earth her unhappy mother. Oh! my friend, hard as the task would be, I would sooner resign her to him who gave her being, than see her live to be a prey to sorrows, which, though sympathy may soften, nothing but death can relieve.</P>

<P>I FEAR my dear friend that Rooksby is in the high road to ruin, Clara sets no bounds to her extravagance. She gives splen∣did balls, concerts composed of the first per∣formers, and pretends to countenance all the literati of the age; besides she is an amateur in painting, and it is almost incredible what sums she squanders, in these pursuits. My dear little girl has now been with me three weeks. Susan Mossop came over with her, Susan is a lively girl and immediately attract∣ed the notice of Belger. It gave me pain to see it, as I was too well acquainted with the principles of the man to think he meant an honourable attachment, and in a friendly manner warned her to beware. Would you believe it? my attention to her happiness was construed into jealousy, and from that moment she has treated me with contempt and insolence.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="029439_0506_0FE1197557CF4A88"/>
I am just informed a gentleman desires to speak with me. It is something unusual for me to have a visitor especially a male one. It may be some English acquaintance I must leave you my Celia for a short time.</P>
<P>Oh heavens! how hard are my trials: when will the throbbings of my bosom cease!</P>
<P>When I left my pen and descended into the drawing room, the door of which stood partly open, I saw sitting with his back to∣ward me, a gentleman in deep mourning. He arose as I entered. Conceive my sur∣prize.—It was Kingly.</P>
<P>"My Kingly," said I, endeavouring at a look of composure, while my pale counte∣nance and tremulous voice betrayed my emo∣tions.—He took my hand, led me to a sopha and seating himself beside me endeavoured in vain to restrain the tears that trembled in his expressive eyes.</P>
<P>"I have obtained an appointment, my dear Cousin" said he recovering himself "and in a few months shall sail on a three years
<PB N="24" REF="029439_0507_0FE1197AE1B00DD0"/>
station to America: but I could not leave Europe, without taking a personal leave of the best of women and recommending to her care my dear boys, Heaven only knows what may be the fate of their father. Say, should I never return, will you be their mother, their counsellor, their friend?</P>
<P>"Surely Kingly," said I eagerly, "you cannot doubt my readiness to render them every service, within the narrow compass of my power. The friendship I bore their de∣parted mother,—"</P>
<P>"And is there nothing due to the affec∣tion with which you once honoured their unhappy father. Ah Meriel! your lauda∣ble deception is now of no avail: in my dear Margaret's cabinet I found a letter written by her own hand and addressed to me, in which she explains every part of your conduct, which had before appeared so mysterious. Yes my constant, my ador∣ed Meriel, I am now satisfied, that you must have thought me the basest of mankind, as I at one time believed you the most capri∣cious of women: but I can easily trace the black mischief to the fountain head. Hes∣ter Mossop, had frequently made me advan∣ces, which it was impossible to mistake.—Need I tell you I slighted her. Ah! my
<PB N="25" REF="029439_0508_0FE1197F1964EA60"/>
beloved Meriel, how amply has her arts re∣venged her slighted beauty."</P>
<P>He caught my hands, while I in vain en∣deavoured to suppress my tears; but unable to command my voice sufficiently to answer him, I continued silent and he proceeded.</P>
<P>"My own disappointment, my own suf∣ferings I have learned to bear without com∣plaining; but your's, dear Meriel, torture me beyond imagination. I see you married to a man, who ungratefully throws from him a gem, which might add splendor to a diadem. I see you unhappy; and feel I have not the power to alleviate your sorrows.</P>
<P>"Your friendly anxiety," said I "does me honour; and while I possess the esteem of my friends I can never think myself totally unhappy. But you mistake, in thinking Mr. Rooksby"—</P>
<P>"Pardon me Meriel, I know you would endeavour to draw a veil over his vices; but they are too glaring. All the world must see how you are injured!—Would to Heaven, Rooksby was not your husband, or that there was any way to oblige him to do you justice without injuring your fame, which I would die to preserve unspotted."</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="029439_0509_0FE11984AF070C18"/>
"Ah, Kingly!" said I, "your life is too precious to be lightly thrown away. Con∣sider your children—for their sake, for the sake of your friends, preserve it."</P>
<P>"And may I rank Mrs. Rooksby among those friends, who are interested in my safe∣ty?"</P>
<P>"Do you doubt it Kingly? who is there on earth so dear?"—I paused—I recol∣lected I was a wife—I was a mother!—The glow of self-reproach, crimsoned my face. He sunk on his knees before me.</P>
<P>"Oh! most adored of womankind! am I still dear to thy heart?—Speak! finish the blessed sentence! say you still love me!—and I will live in the sweet hope that some happy moment may arrive, when every bar∣rier will be removed!"—He pressed my hands to his bosom: my head sunk upon his shoulder and my tears flowed without restraint. Oh, my Celia! let the prude, the rigidly virtuous blame me: the affection of my heart at that moment triumphed! I looked back to the time when to love him was no crime! the felicity I might, have enjoyed in his society arose to my view! I felt, that spite of all resistance, I still loved him, and was still ardently beloved—but at
<PB N="27" REF="029439_0510_0FE119899039BF60"/>
the same moment, I remembered I could never be his.—</P>
<P>"Believe me," said I, "my heart has never wandered."</P>
<P>"Ten thousand thanks!" cried he, wild∣ly kissing my hands. At that moment the door opened and Rooksby entered. To de∣scribe the scene that ensued would be impos∣sible. I felt I had been to blame—I dared not assert my innocence, though I had for∣gotten myself but for a moment.—"Detest∣ed villian," said he," darting a fierce look at Kingly; "and you prevaricating wretch, where now is your boasted virtue?"—He at the same time seized me rudely by the arm: Kingly interposed—"Dare not to treat your wife injuriously—she is an angel."</P>
<P>"An angel of darkness, I believe," said he, contemptuously, "but I shall expect to settle this matter in another place."</P>
<P>"Rooksby," said Kingly, with an air of dignity, "you are the husband of Meriel Howard. I believe you do not doubt my courage: but worlds should not tempt me to lift my hand against your life."</P>
<P>"Base subterfuge—cowardly villain!"—cried the enraged Rooksby, and struck him.
<PB N="28" REF="029439_0511_0FE1198EAB5EBCC8"/>
I saw no more. Sense forsook me and when I recovered, I found they had left the house together. I am dreadfully agitated: Six hours have I past in the most agonizing sus∣pence; during which time, I have at inter∣vals endeavoured to compose my perturbed spirits by writing:—But, alas! I can no longer proceed. Interested in the fate of both, should they fight, I am destined to be unhappy.</P>
<P>Rooksby is returned—Kingly is danger∣ously wounded, and in a few hours my hus∣band sets off for Italy. I return to England with my child; but Susan Mossop forsakes me in my distress and goes to Clara, where ruin and infamy, I fear, will soon overtake her. I shall write no more on this side the channel. Heaven grant that Kingly may recover, and Rooksby awaken to a sense of his errors. Then may the pale messenger of peace beckon me from this vale of sorrow to that blessed mansion, where the tear shall cease to flow, and the heart be eased of its anguish.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LVII. MERIEL to CELIA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Glamorganshire,</HI> <DATE><HI>August</HI> 27<HI>th,</HI> 1784.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THE hasty scrawl I wrote on my first arrival in England,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Does not appear.</NOTE> informed you of my safety; but there are many other things you no doubt wish to know, as you must have been surprized at my long silence. A variety of incidents have contributed to make me appear neglectful of my friend; but they are now all past, and I am settled in a little neat retreat far from the busy scenes of life, where my chief occupation is the care of my sweet girl. I think my Celia, after buffeting as I have done the waves of adversity, the calm serenity of my little dwelling diffuses a degree of comfort over my heart, to which it has long been a stranger.</P>
<P>On my arrival in England, I went imme∣diately to our house in Harley-Street, where
<PB N="30" REF="029439_0513_0FE11998A1357AE8"/>
I spent a week in the most torturing suspence expecting every day to hear of Kingly's death, as I had desired a gentleman in Paris to inform me of that event immediately, if it should happen, or in case of his recovery, to let me know when he was out of danger. My dear Amelia came to me the day after my arrival and every tender attention, which friendship could bestow, I experienced from her and Captain Onslow. At length the long expected letter arrived and I read, to my surprize and joy, that Kingly was in a fair way of recovery. This was an infinite re∣lief to my mind, and I began to regain some degree of composure, which was only inter∣rupted by the idea of parting with my friend Mrs. Onslow, who was on the point of ac∣companying her husband to India; but the privation of her society was an event I was prepared to expect from the day of her marriage; I lamented it in silence, and only congratulated the dear woman on the felici∣tous prospects that seemed to await her, without damping her spirits by a mention of my sorrows of which her departure from England was not the least.</P>
<P>She had not been gone above a month, when I was alarmed and terrified by an execution coming into the house, and on enquiring into my husband's affairs, learned
<PB N="31" REF="029439_0514_0FE1199B6E3F7E28"/>
that his folly and Clara's profligacy had in∣volved him in irretrievable embarrassments; that he had mortgaged or sold almost all his property and could not command a thousand pounds clear in the world, except the estates which had been settled on me at my marriage and the small one in Glamorganshire, which he had presented to me previous to our union. I consulted with Mr. le Sage, a particular friend of Rooksby's whether any thing could be done to relieve him, and offered to cancel my marriage settlement; but of this he would not hear. However I determined to retrench every superfluous expense in my house-keep∣ing, to discharge my servants and lay down my carriage. Having made this resolution, I instantly set about the execution of it, call∣ed in all my accounts and paid to the utmost of my power every thing due, I then told Mr. le Sage that I should leave London and did not wish my place of residence to be known to many of my acquaintance; but that I should esteem it a favour if he would inform me, whenever he heard of Rooksby, and forward to me any letters that might come from the continent. I then with only two servants set forward for Glamorganshire. I found the journey very fatiguing especially when I drew near its conclusion. My income was now very confined yet I thought two hundred a year would be a sufficient support
<PB N="32" REF="029439_0515_0FE119A1329E4468"/>
for myself and child with economy, and would be a certain refuge for her, whenever I should be no more. As to my marriage settlement I did not consider it as my own, but held it merely with a view of being ser∣viceable to my husband in any future emer∣gency. Do not think, my dear Celia, I mean to insinuate that affection for Rooksby led me to act thus. No, that had long been extinct, gratitude had at one time awakened in my bosom an affection pure and tender, if not ardent, but his conduct since has en∣tirely extinguished it, and whatever I do now proceeds from a motive of duty, and a consciousness of right. He is the father of my child. He is the man I have solemn∣ly promised to prefer to all his sex. Oh! Celia! what an awful state is marriage and yet how thoughtlessly do many rush into it. How ought we to reflect before we take a promise it may not be in our power to keep. While I live I hope my actions will ever be the result of principle, and that principle rectitude. Let me perform my duty chear∣fully, and leave the event to heaven. But I am wandering. When I drew near the house which stands on my little farm, I was shock∣ed to see how very desolate it appeared, it had been untenanted two years and only a young man and his mother lived in one part of it; the one looked after the farm;
<PB N="33" REF="029439_0516_0FE119A512951868"/>
and the other milked the cows, made the butter and sent it to market. Part of the garden was cultivated but the largest half was over-run with weeds. Rooksby had not seen it for seven years past, and in that time it had been sadly neglected, so that though its original value had been two hundred pounds per year, it did not now produce half that sum. A cold chillness seized my spirits as we drove up to the gate; the wo∣man had been taught to expect me for I wrote to the young man, that a couple of bed-rooms might be prepared and well aired; the coach stopped, the door was opened and from the house come—judge who, my dear Celia. Why no other than my dear old nurse, De∣borah Ellis. I do really believe, I screamed with joy when I saw her. She, poor old soul, had no remembrance of me; but stood curt∣sying, and fearing my ladyship was very much fatigued. I followed her into the house—a small parlour wore the appearance of comfort; a table was covered with a clean coarse cloth, and in a few moments Debo∣rah brought in a couple of boiled chickens, a bottle of current wine, and every other appurtenance for dinner. I could not now withhold from discovering myself: but stop∣ping her as she was about to leave the room, "Deborah," said I," have you forgot me Deborah." A silent look of enquiry and
<PB N="34" REF="029439_0517_0FE119AA70931AB8"/>
surprize was her only reply. "Surely," said I, "you must remember your poor little Meriel.—"Meriel madam! what my dear Miss Meriel Howard?"—"Yes Deborah, your own Meriel, pray speak to me, I am Meriel Howard."—She laid her hand on my arm and looking earnestly in my face the large drops of joy chased each other down her aged countenance.—</P>
<P>"I think you are like her," said she, "but you are altered, you did not used to be so thin nor so pale." Then clasping me in her arms she continued, "I know you now, for well I remember you was the child of afflic∣tion.—</P>
<P>I then told her in as concise a manner as possible every occurrence that had passed since my removal to London, still carefully con∣cealing every thing that might lead to the subject of my leaving so abruptly Woodbine cott, and the unhappy consequences that pre∣ceded it. But I can plainly discover she too well guesses the cause of that elopement.—She comforted and consoled me under my present circumstances, and declared she would never again be seperated from me. I learnt from her, that the mother of the young man who managed the farm, was her sister, that she was lately dead, and that she her∣self had come by her nephew's desire to get
<PB N="35" REF="029439_0518_0FE119AFA67FF118"/>
the rooms ready for his lady's coming; but she had, no thought of finding in that lady the dear little girl, whom she had nursed, and loved like a child of her own.</P>
<P>You will readily imagine, my dear Celia, that the presence of Deborah greatly con∣tributed to my comfort. I soon got settled, discharged my man servant, whom I had on∣ly engaged to accompany me on my journey, and with Deborah and Lucy, a young woman whom I had engaged to wait on myself and attend Clementina, I entered on an entire new way of life; and believe me, when I say, it is by far the most comfortable I have experienced for many years. Colin, Debo∣rah's nephew, superintends the farm, which I flatter myself, will soon be in a flourishing state. My old fashioned casements are overun with jesmine and honey-suckle, and before my door, are a variety of roses, pinks, sweet-williams, and other flowers, which, though common are not less sweet, than the rare and expensive exotics that flourish in the green-houses of the first noblemen in England. My parlour and dining room are ormamented with pots of myrtle, geranium, mignionet, and balm of giliad; the furniture consisting only of plain oak tables and neat matted chairs. My bed chamber and that of my child, is furnished with while dimity,
<PB N="36" REF="029439_0519_0FE119B52F010908"/>
but made as plain as possible. Before I left London, I went to see Kingly's two chil∣dren. They are in perfect health, and pla∣ced where I think they will meet with eve∣ry tenderness and attention. I engaged the lady under whose care they are placed, to write frequently and inform me of their welfare; for should illness attack them, I should not hesitate a moment to fly to their as∣sistance. The world might perhaps, blame me, yet surely, my Celia, the world must be more unfeeling than I have even yet found it, should the conduct of a woman incur its censure, who having a child of her own, loves and compassionates those who are deprived of a mother's tenderness.</P>
<P>In this retreat then, my friend, I hope to pass some few years in tranquillity. Even if Rooksby returns to England, he will be accompanied by Clara and I should be only thought a troublesome intruder; therefore, unless he requires it, I will not leave my re∣tirement. Could I be of any service to ward off any impending misfortune, or comfort him under affliction; should a declining state of health require the kind attention of a nurse, then will I fly on the wings of duty, and prove myself a wife and friend. But alas! I fear he may perhaps even quit the world without my either seeing him or know∣ing
<PB N="37" REF="029439_0520_0FE119B7A8BF7138"/>
where he is; for he has not wrote to me since we parted at Paris, and knowing as I do his impetuous temper, I am sensible, especially connected as he is with such a wo∣man as Clara, he may be drawn into dan∣gerous quarrels. But I grow tedious on this subject, which is ever uppermost in my thoughts, and cruel as he has behaved to me, I daily offer up a prayer for his safety. Nay, sometimes I fear, least I have not loved him as I ought. Perhaps love so ardent as his, was quick sighted and could discover the difference between passion and friend∣ship: yet, from the first of our acquaint∣ance, I never attempted to deceive him or feign a tenderness I could not feel. Clara, I am certain has been the chief and only cause of alienating his affection from me.—I remember when I first knew her as Mrs. Moreton at Kensington, I told her in the un∣suspected openness of my heart every circum∣stance of my my life, my sincere attachment to Rainsforth, my misfortunes, my rash and im∣prudent step to relieve my mother. These perhaps, with aggravated circumstances have been repeated to Rooksby, and he has impu∣ted my union with him to interested motives. Nay, he might even think the reluctance I shewed to it at first was the effect of art.—These reflections often lead me to think more favourably of his conduct than perhaps
<PB N="38" REF="029439_0521_0FE119BD768A18E0"/>
others will say it deserves. While I ever be∣haved to him in one uniform manner, ten∣der, attentive, but calm and serene. Clara has no doubt affected the most impetuous passion and by his means has gained that ascendency over him which I greatly fear will end but in his total ruin or death.</P>
<P><HI>August</HI>29<HI>th.</HI></P>
<P>I have just received a letter from Kingly. He is going on a three years station to Ame∣rica. May the God of Battles defend him. He had heard of Rooksby's misfortunes and sent me a letter of credit on his banker; but of this no necessity whatever, should tempt me to avail myself. No, Celia, I feel my heart too much oppressed already with the weight of obligation. I am already but too apt to make comparisons of what is, and what might have been my fate, and this shall be the last time I will indulge myself in writing of him to you. Speak of him, I cannot, as no person here knows him; and I will endeavour not to think of him, for when I remember that there is such a man, I must also remember that it was he first taught my heart affection, it was he who saved my life almost at the expense of his own, and that possessed as he is of every
<PB N="39" REF="029439_0522_0FE119C26CF4E558"/>
amiable quality, he is unhappy.—Oh! human nature, how weak thou art!—Poor unstable beings that we are, conscious of our errors, we suffer reason to take the reins for a moment, and renounce them! But, scarce has the renunciation past our lips, perhaps in the very instant of self ap∣plause, some trifling circumstance will awa∣ken the feelings of our hearts, and we, im∣perceptibly, return to those very follies, the remembrance of which, had covered us with confusion!—</P>
<P>Adieu!—dear Celia—remember me in your pious oraisons, and continue to let me hear from you. I shall write, but my let∣ter will contain only the insipid detail of what passes at my solitaty habitation, or the, perhaps, not less insipid encomiums a fond mother will bestow in enumerating the growing perfections of a darling child.—Oh! may that child live to be my comfort∣er. I will hide her from the world, and all its allurements: So, may she never! never! feel its excruciating pains!—I will make my will, Celia, and leave this idol of my soul to your care, in case it should please Hea∣ven to deprive her of her mother. You, I know, will teach her that in the bosom of retirement, she alone can find peace. Oh how blest the heart whose sensibility has
<PB N="40" REF="029439_0523_0FE119C736779A80"/>
never been awakened, who, though dead to all the joys of love or friendship, feels not the pang of disappointment, or the pierc∣ing sting of ingratitude!—Once more, Adieu!—May Heaven ever bless you.</P>

<P>Between this letter and the next there are several omitted, which Mrs. Rooksby wrote to her friend during her residence in the country, where she con∣tinued four years, unnoticed by her husband and forgotten by a world, where her virtues had never been esteemed as they deserved. As these letters con∣tain nothing material it was not judged necessary to print them. Mr. Rooksby's return to England call∣ed her again into the busy scenes of life, and as her distressing situations are most feelingly described by her own pathetic pen—we here again take up the correspondence.</P>

<P>HAVE you never heard, my dear Celia, that mariners, who are accustomed to the vicissitudes of the unstable element, never experience a long succession of calm serene weather, but they hold themselves prepared for a heavy storm. The sea is deceitful and the inexperienced sailor may be lost e'r he is aware of danger. This has been my case. Lulled into security by the calm I had been allowed to enjoy I fondly flattered myself that I should sink quietly into oblivion, forgetting and forgotten by the world. The accounts I heard of my husband were vague and im∣probable. I was at a loss to think how he subsisted. I was told he had sunk into the detested character of a sharper and gambler. He never wrote to me, never enquired for me; nay, I was once informed that he had spread a report of my death. A few days
<PB N="42" REF="029439_0525_0FE119CFC350C140"/>
after my last to you as I was instructing my little darling in the first rudiment of the Eng∣lish language, a letter was brought me which I enclose for your perusal.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with infinite regret I take up my pen to inform you of what I am sensible will give you the most lively affliction and dis∣turb that tranquillity, which through the exertions of your own good sense you have for some time enjoyed.</P>
<P>Mr. Rooksby is in England. He arrived at my house last night extremely ill both in body and mind; he informed me in a few almost incoherent words, that he had killed a man at Brussels, where he has resided for some time, that in the fray he met with a slight wound in his shoulder, which had ne∣ver been properly dressed, as his servant had hurried him to England with the utmost ra∣pidity, and that he himself was unwilling to stop after crossing the channel till he arrived in London.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="029439_0526_0FE119D3D10BC118"/>
I found he was very much fatigued, and from the agitation of his spirits and an∣guish of the wound, very feverish. We persuaded him to go to bed and sent for a surgeon, who examined the wound and pronounced it slight; but in a bad way from being neglected. He was very restless all night, and towards morning I thought rather wild in his discourse, I asked him if I should send for you,—"send for who" said he, raising himself hastily, for "Mrs. Rooksby? for which of them," said he, wildly "I have two wives."—I thought this was a certain indication of delirium and forbore to an∣swer him, but he caught hold of my hand and obliging me to sit down thus continued, "if you mean Meriel, I have injured her too much to expect she will come, and as to Harriet, or Clara—Oh! do not tell Clara where I am!"—He then appeared violent∣ly agitated and soon after raved in a very incoherent manner. I thought, madam, it was necessary you should be informed of his unhappy situation, and therefore send an express off with this immediately, requesting you will set off for town as quick as possible; your presence may in some measure calm his perturbed spirits, and be the means of a re∣covery, which I believe the Physician con∣siders at present very doubtful. Fearing you might not be accommodated with cash

<HEAD>MERIEL, IN CONTINUATION.</HEAD>
<P>YOU will readily believe, that when the shock my spirits had received was a little subsided, I sat about hasty preparations for my journey: I took Lucy with me and left Clementina in the care of Deborah. I made but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> stoppages on the road, ta∣king but little refreshment, and no rest till I arrived in town. Anxiety kept me up, nor was I sensible of the fatigue I had un∣dergone:
<PB N="45" REF="029439_0528_0FE119DC37A63F10"/>
—But when I alighted in Wel∣beck Street, and attempted to walk up stairs, I found the exertion was beyond my strength, and I sunk almost insensible on the landing place. Mr. Le Sage was very attentive and friendly, as was also his amiable daughter; and by their kindness I soon found myself able to enquire after poor Rooksby. They told me he was bet∣ter, that he knew I was expected, and, that he was impatient to see me. I rallied my spirits, and having at the request of my kind host taken a glass of wine, I proceed∣ed to the sick chamber. I approached the bed cautiously.—Good Heavens!—what havoc has intemperance and sickness made in his person? How little should I have known him for the blooming elegant Clem∣ent Rooksby, whom only seven years before I had accepted as my husband. Pale, ema∣ciated, and haggard was his countenance; his words so weak they could not be under∣stood. He fixed his eyes for an instant on me; his lips moved, he stretched one hand out toward me and with the other covered his face. I took the offered hand; com∣passion overpowered resentment; I raised it to my lips and wet it with my tears.</P>
<P>"Oh! thou dear generous woman," said he saintly, "I have not deserved this ten∣derness
<PB N="46" REF="029439_0529_0FE119E1EDCBC140"/>
—I am a wretch, unworthy of your notice: but you are an angel of mercy come to whisper pardon to my soul that I may die in peace."</P>
<P>"You will live many years yet," said I, "many years in comfort and health."</P>
<P>"Never," said he, eagerly, "I do not wish to live. Health may return: but my heart will never know peace nor joy again; therefore. 'twere well, if it were cold and motionless. But, oh! my beloved—I do not deserve to live and I am afraid to die!"</P>
<P>Here the nurse interposed, and I was forced to leave him; for while I stayed, he persisted in talking to me, which irritated the disorder. I had not left him long, when he sent to know if I had brought Clementi∣na with me; and seemed greatly disappoint∣ed when he found I had not. His anxiety of see the child, pleased me, and tempted me to write to Deborah to come with her to town immediately. The tender assiduity, which inclination prompted me to show my poor Rooksby, accelerated his recovery and in about six weeks I had the pleasure of see∣ing him able to bear a removal to a small house we had taken at Pimlico. I had care∣fully avoided suffering him to dwell on past disagreeable circumstances and endeavoured
<PB N="47" REF="029439_0530_0FE119E59880E360"/>
by every means I could devise, to direct the melancholy I saw daily increasing; but my attempts were vain, and indeed had I known the real source of that melancholy, my own heart would have been equally oppressed.</P>
<P>We had been in our new habitation, but a fortnight, when one morning as we were at breakfast; two men entered and arrested Rooksby for a debt of five thousand pounds. which he told me was a gaming debt, and the same which had involved him in the un∣lucky quarrel at Brussels as he suspected the person who won it of him, did not win it fairly. I cannot tell you what I felt. Weak and low as he was, it was death to see him conveyed to a prison, yet that I knew must be the inevitable consequence of the arrest, as I had no means to extricate him from that and several others of a similar nature, for which he had been draw in to give his note. With a heart almost breaking I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him de∣part, and then immediately sent for a lawyer, whom I determined to invest with power to sell the little property we possessed, I did not consult Mr. Le Sage. I knew his cold Phi∣losophy would strongly oppose my giving up my settlements. Yet sure, my dear Celia, I should have been wrong to hesitate a mo∣ment, or out of a pretended care for the future welfare of my child to suffer her
<PB N="48" REF="029439_0531_0FE119EB5A40C3A0"/>
father oppressed with sickness and tortured by remorse, forsaken by those gay triflers, who once called themselves his friends, to waste the remainder of his wretched life in a prison.</P>
<P>"When I had given every proper direc∣tion for the raising what money we could, and endeavouring to bring the unjust holders of his notes to some composition, I visited him in his sad abode and endeavoured to chear and comfort him. That duty fulfill∣ed, I returned to my solitary home and taking my dear girl on my lap gave a free vent to tears which flowed from real anguish of heart.</P>
<P>Deborah brought in my tea. She shut the windows, stirred the fire and twice at∣tempted to speak; but the honest creature's own feelings were too acute to permit her to comfort me.</P>
<P>My poor Clementina, from sympathy had laid her dear head on my bosom and mixed her tears with mine "Mamma is sick, De∣borah," said she. Deborah took her silently from me, wiped off the tears that trickled down her innocent face; once more attempt∣ed to speak, but unable to articulate turned hastily from me and wept aloud. How long
<PB N="49" REF="029439_0532_0FE119EE6D281AB8"/>
this scene of mute sorrow would have con∣tinued I know not; but we were aroused from it by a coach <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and a loud rap at the door. I trembled, I knew not why; I wished not to see any visitors, yet had not presence of mind to forbid any one being admitted, and before I could compose my countenance or wipe away the traces of sor∣row from my face the door opened and a most lovely young woman entered. Her dress was second mourning, neat in the ex∣treme and she was visibly pregnant. Her looks were characteristic of modesty and truth. Her manners at once attractive and commanding, such as she appeared to me at that moment, fancy now represents her to my mind, and I find, sorrowful as my heart is, it has yet a vulnerable part that feels for her afflictions.</P>
<P>She curtsyed and with a look and voice humility entreated pardon for the intrusion, she had hoped to have found Mr. Rooksby at home. "He will not be at home to-night madam," said I, as I entreated her to be seated, "but if you will favour me with your commands I will serve you to the utmost of my power."</P>
<P>"Pardon me, madam," said she, "com∣mands are not for the unfortunate, I came
<PB N="50" REF="029439_0533_0FE119F40EBEA0B0"/>
not to command but entreat.—To entreat Mr Rooksby will call to his rememberance an unhappy woman, who deprived of his friendship must be forever lost."</P>
<P>"If you mean Mrs. Millar, madam," said I with some surprize. "I am astonished she could employ so respectable a person on so very improper a message."</P>
<P>"Alas! madam I do not know Mrs. Millar, I have indeed heard of her and that she had used Mr. Rooksby extremely ill, but it is not for her I would plead, it is for myself."</P>
<P>"Yourself," cried I, in breathless agita∣tion, "Does he owe you money."</P>
<P>"Oh no! no! he owes me succour and support, I am his wife! and he has forsaken me." I believe the wildness of my looks terri∣fied her; for she caught hold of my hand and thus proceeded.—"Dear madam, do not be angry, you perhaps are his sister, you blame the unequal alliance. I was poor, madam; but indeed, I will never disgrace the name he has honoured me with."</P>
<P>She might have proceeded longer without interruption. A sudden stupefaction seemed
<PB N="51" REF="029439_0534_0FE119F7D4103B00"/>
to deprive me of sense or feeling. This agra∣vation of my calamities was more than I could bear, and nature sunk under the shock. She was alarmed and hastily rung the bell. The entrance of Deborah and the child awakened me to sensibility, and the tears which the dreadful discovery I had just made had sus∣pended, now gushed forth afresh. I gave them free vent, and thanked heaven for the relief they gave my heart. When I became a little composed, I reflected on the sad in∣telligence I had to communicate to my un∣fortunate guest. At one moment I resolved in compassion to her situation to hide the truth from her; yet on reflection that ap∣peared impossible. My next care was how to break it to her in the tenderest manner; I invited her to partake my repast, and sooth∣ed her by the kindest attention; yet by de∣grees hinted to her that all was not as it should be, that I feared her expectations would be greatly disappointed, that Rooksby was in trouble, and I would advise her at that time not to attempt to see him.</P>
<P>"But if he is in affliction, madam, is it not my duty to fly to him, though he has forsaken me."—"I fear, my dear, you would meet a shock, should you attempt to see him. He at present could not with pro∣priety receive you."—"Could not,—per∣haps
<PB N="52" REF="029439_0535_0FE119FCEB0F8770"/>
you think he would not?"—"I do not mean so. I never heard him mention you; but I know there are very forcible reasons against his receiving you; reasons which make it altogether impossible for you to be with him.—Yet do not be alarmed though Mr. Rooksby cannot I will be your friend.</P>
<P>It seemed as at one moment she had com∣prehended the extent of her misfortune, for starting hastily from her seat she cried "Oh! I see it all, you, you madam, are not his sister, you are his wife, and I am undone forever!"</P>
<P>To give a proper force to the scene during the rest of the evening would be impossible. I detained her with me and in the language of the purest simplicity, she told a tale that for a moment stole me from my own sorrow, to lament hers. I have requested her to commit it to writing that I might transmit it to you. She has complied and bid me tell you if she can save enough from the wreck of her little fortune to pay her entrance she will come and in your convent bury her shame and her misfortunes. Oh! my Celia, should she come, receive her with the kind∣ness of a sister, and strive to alleviate the sorrows of her heart. She is innocent, un∣suspecting, and full of sensibility. Comfort

<HEAD>LETTER LIX. MERIEL to CELIA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>December</HI> 29<HI>th,</HI> 1788.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I RESUME my melancholy narrative, though God knows my heart bleeds at every vein, and the only consolation I have left, is, that you will pity—you will pray for me—my child—my beloved—my only com∣fort:—but Heaven's will be done.</P>
<LG>
<L>Array'd in robes of white,</L>
<L>In yonder fields of light</L>
<L>—She dwells in presence of the eternal king—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Plac'd on a throne divine;</L>
<L>Round which resplendent orbs of fire</L>
<L>Forever glow—for ever shine!</L>
<L>Hark! hark!—methinks I hear her sing,</L>
<L>And with a rapt, a grateful soul, admire</L>
<L>The verlasting joys that round her spring.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She was sweet as the roses that bloom,</L>
<L>And perfume the breath of the May,</L>
<L>But, alas! to my sorrow as soon,</L>
<L>She faded and withered away.—</L>
<L><PB N="55" REF="029439_0538_0FE11A0A2A49F550"/>
Bring me lilies that grow in the vale,</L>
<L>And sprigs from the jessamine spray,</L>
<L>They are sweet—tho' they're sickly and pale—</L>
<L>She was fairer and sweeter than they.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Her soul like the lily was pure,</L>
<L>Like the Jessamine fair to the eye,</L>
<L>Was her form—but, alas! when I tho't her secure,</L>
<L>'Twas decreed she should sicken and die!—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now in the cold—cold—grave she lies—</L>
<L>No more she glads my heart, or chears my eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But I'll rise with the morn!</L>
<L>To visit the turf</L>
<L>That o'er the blest seraph is spread;</L>
<L>Whilst I pluck from the earth</L>
<L>Nettle, thistle or thorn!</L>
<L>That unknowing her worth</L>
<L>May, spring o'er her innocent head.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For in her breast, no boist'rous passion dwelt—</L>
<L>She never envy knew; or malice felt.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But pure as angels—from this world she fled</L>
<L>To yonder realms! so exquisitely fair—</L>
<L>She sleeps—the cherub sleeps—she is not dead!</L>
<L>She will awake to joys eternal there.</L>
</LG>
<P>And that we may all awake there, is my earnest prayer. Poor Clementina!—I laid her by the side of my dear mother. Oh, Celia! the one was not more innocent, more worthy a place in the mansions of the blest, than was the other:—I am poor! Ce∣lia—very poor!—there is no monument:—no, not even a stone, to tell where their be∣loved
<PB N="56" REF="029439_0539_0FE11A0F9005D268"/>
ashes repose—but sacred be the dust that covers them! They who knew their worth, will revere the spot where they rest—and none who love their memories, as I do, will pass it without a tear!—</P>
<P>I took up my pen to write: I know not why—for I have nothing to say—only that this is a sad—very sad world to live in.—For if we love any thing we are sure to lose it. God forgive me, I often complain, when I have no right to do so—for we were all born to suffer.—Oh! my dear Celia, I wish you more patience that I have: for I am very impatient—sadly impatient:—but then indeed I am very—very—wretched!—</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LX. FREDERIC KINGLY, <ABBR>ESQ.</ABBR> to COL. ONSLOW.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>London,</HI> <DATE><HI>Jan.</HI> 20<HI>th,</HI> 1789.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I ARRIVED in England, dear Onslow, just in time to administer relief to the most amiable, most lovely of her sex. When I went to visit my dear boys, I enquired when they had seen Mrs. Rooksby. They told me that for some time past they had neither seen or heard from her. I then re∣paired to Le Sage, who I knew was Rooks∣by's banker. From him I learned that Rooksby was in prison, and the dear wor∣thy Meriel in distress for even the common necessaries of life. Her child, her beloved Clementina had been ill with the measles, and was even then in the utmost danger from a disorder which had settled on her lungs. I hastened to seek her out, and found her, Onslow, in a small lodging up three pair of stairs, in the vicinity of the King's bench prison, where her unworthy
<PB N="58" REF="029439_0541_0FE11A16E2A9BBC8"/>
husband was confined. When I entered the room, she was kneeling by the bed-side, her face, her hands, elevated towards that Hea∣ven whose mercy she supplicated in behalf of her dying child. Beside her knelt two lovely interesting boys, whom I afterwards learned were the children Rooksby had by Clara. I spoke to her. She took but little notice of me, for the feelings of a mother had absorbed every other. She signed for me to sit down, and pointing to her daugh∣ter looked unutterable anguish. I enquired whether she had proper advice and assist∣ance; her answer cut me to the heart. She had not the means to procure proper medi∣cal advice!—Every thing of value had been disposed of to support her hus∣band.—I did not remain long with this dear suffering angel!—But sent a Phy∣sician and a nurse to her, telling the lat∣ter, I would defray every expence—for will you believe it, Onslow, the dear crea∣ture, though reduced to the utmost distress, had never availed herself of the letter of cre∣dit I sent her previous to my departure from England. On the third day after this ar∣rangement, I called to enquire how she was and found her sweet little girl had just breathed her last. That was not a time to offer consolation. I took the two boys from her, and gave orders for the funeral.
<PB N="59" REF="029439_0542_0FE11A19C3326F88"/>
She had a very decent woman with her, whom she called Deborah, and who I saw was both respectful and affectionate in her behaviour. I thought my company at that time might be more intrusive than welcome; besides I was sensible the world was ever ready to censure an unhappy woman, who in dis∣tress met with friendship, however disinter∣ested from our sex. I therefore determined to wait till the funeral was over, before I attempted to see my dear afflicted Meriel; but on the very evening that the child was buried, I received a message from Deborah, saying her mistress was extremely ill, and she wished I would come to her immediate∣ly. I had been told that my adored girl had once before from the effect of a very heavy affliction, lost her senses for some days—(though what that affliction was, I never learned.)—But from this intelligence, I was prepared to find the same misfortune had befallen her. I was not deceived. She was writing when I entered the room, to a Miss Shelburne, with whom she spent the early part of her life in a convent at Bo∣logne, such a letter, Onslow, as would melt the most obdurate heart. I waited till she voluntarily resigned her pen, which she soon did, when folding her letter and speak∣ing to me, as though I was her servant she bade me make haste with it to the Post
<PB N="60" REF="029439_0543_0FE11A1F65DDEC88"/>
or I should be too late. It was by stratagem I got her to accompany me home, where I provided medical and other assistance. De∣borah has faithfully attended her, and I am told she is now in a fair way of recovery, though her senses are still wandering.—During her confinement I have taken care that Rooksby should want for nothing; be∣cause I believe it is the first wish of the dear creature's heart. But I cannot bring myself to see or converse with a man, who has re∣duced so noble a mind as Meriel Howard's to insanity; for sure I am, her mental facul∣ties must have been greatly weakened by prior afflictions or she would not so power∣fully have felt the loss of her child. Her pious soul, if in the unimpaired use of her reason, would have severely felt the privation but still submitted with patience.—</P>
<P>Deborah sends for me. May it be good tidings from her, who is all in all to me, and who though the wife of another, possesses my tenderest affection. Blame me not, my right was prior to his, and believe me my affection is pure as the soul of her who in∣spires it.</P>
<P>She is restored to reason, thanks be to heaven for it, I have not yet seen her, nor does she know in whose house she is; but I
<PB N="61" REF="029439_0544_0FE11A2290D99170"/>
am all joy at the fair prospect of her return∣ing health. Tell your lovely amiable wife that every exertion necessary for the restora∣tion of her friend shall be used, and that I hope my next letter will inform you of her perfect recovery. God bless you. May I see my dear Meriel in health before I am or∣dered again to leave England and I shall go without regret. Adieu,</P>

<P>ONCE more snatched from death, or what is to a thinking mind far worse, a total deprivation of reason; I have next to an al∣mighty providence, to render thanks and bless the hand of Kingly. Why am I doomed to be thus obliged, where I have no power to return the obligation but by grateful prayers and tears; I have some faint recollec∣tion of having wrote you a letter after the death of my beloved Clementina; but I fear it was very incoherent and hardly intelligible; but I will now endeavour to go back to the period when the poor young creature whom my husband had so vilely deceived came to my house at Pimlico. I resolved to prevent her, if possible, from seeing Rooksby, as I knew it would only irritate his sufferings, without in the least alleviating her own; I therefore prevailed on her to remain with
<PB N="63" REF="029439_0546_0FE11A2AC47265B0"/>
me till I could form some plan that might be of use to her; and as I every day expected Kingly in England, I thought he might render himself of service to her, without subjecting her to the unjust censures, which would be cast on me should I accept favours from his hands.</P>
<P>My time passed wretched enough for three weeks. At the end of that time I perceived that Harriet, which was the name of my <HI>Protegéé</HI> appeared somewhat more chearful and on enquiring the cause, she informed me that she was certain she had seen her mother's brother pass our house frequently, that she had inquired his name and learned it was the same she had thought it to be, that he lived in the neighbourhood and was a wealthy widow∣er without children. From this information Harriet had conceived the idea of writing to him and faithfully explaining her unhappy circumstances. She shewed me the copy of a letter she had prepared, which as it con∣tained the chief events of her life, I requested leave to send to you. I inclose it, and as it is necessary you should read it before I proceed I shall here break off.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>December</HI> 24<HI>th,</HI> 1788.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>PERHAPS, my dear and honoured uncle will be both surprized and offended to receive a letter from one whom no doubt he has heard, conducted herself in a manner that has thrown an odium on her family, I have been to blame, greatly to blame, but not so very culpable as you and perhaps all the world imagine.</P>
<P>I am fully sensible of the many disadvan∣tages I labour under, while addressing you, yet when I remember that out of a numerous family you were the only one, who shewed a friendship for my poor mother when her union with my father so highly offended all. When I recollect the many instances of your affection I have myself witnessed when I was but a child, I cannot but hope you will not turn away from the daughter of that once loved sister.—Oh! why was I so early de∣prived
<PB N="65" REF="029439_0548_0FE11A34E0773010"/>
of her maternal affection, or why did not the same stroke that snatched her from the world take also her unhappy daugh∣ter; for surely of all the forlorn beings the world contains a girl deprived of her mother is the most pitiable. She may, it is true, meet with relations or friends that will in some measure supply her place, but alas! they will not have the watchful care, the fond solicitude of a mother. Had I never lost that dear parent I should not have been the un∣fortunate creature I am; for there is a sort of talismanic virtue in the very name of mo∣ther, that while it fills our hearts with sensati∣ons undescribably delightful, is tempered with such awe, such fear of giving pain or incur∣ring displeasure, that it must be a very insen∣sible daughter who would wilfully do either.</P>
<P>My dear father was the tenderest, the fondest of parents, and strained, to the ut∣most, his little income, to procure for me an education befitting a gentlewoman. He placed me as a boarder in a convent near Abbeville, his place of residence, that he might keep a watchful eye upon my con∣duct; for the honour of his family and that of my mother's were ever dear to his heart, and he often said that he would sooner see me in my coffin, whilst a child, than have me live to fully the name I bore and the
<PB N="66" REF="029439_0549_0FE11A3A0729D8D8"/>
family I sprung from. My life passed in uninterrupted tranquillity, 'till I was seven∣teen, at which period a Mademoiselle St. Farr was going to leave the convent and marry. She had ever conceived a great es∣teem for me, was five years older than my∣self and had resided in the convent from the death of her father, which happened when she was very young. She was a woman of an enlightened understanding, lovely in her person and elegant in her manners. She ever preserved that dignity, which ren∣ders our sex respectable, yet mixed it with such charming vivacity, such sprightly wit and unaffected good humour that she at once commanded respect and conciliated affec∣tion. I have been thus minute in my de∣scription of Mademoiselle St. Farr, that you might not be surprised at my father's rea∣dy compliance with a request she made, that I should accompany her to Brussels, and remain with her during the winter season. Young and volatile my heart bounded at the prospect of the liberty and pleasure I hoped to enjoy under her protection. Her husband Monsieur Melville was a gallant man, and from the day of their marriage, promoted every entertainment that he ima∣gined could give pleasure to a young beau∣tiful woman, just emerged from the gloom of a convent. But Madame Melville was a
<PB N="67" REF="029439_0550_0FE11A3D49099D28"/>
woman of too much discernment to suffer dissipation and folly to have a moments as∣cendency over her mind. After sharing in the amusements of Brussels a few weeks, she expressed a wish of living in a more domes∣tic manner, and retired to an elegant cha∣theaux, which her husband possessed on the banks of the Seine. Thither I accompani∣ed her: but, alas! sir, my weak mind had been fascinated with the pleasures of the gay world, and I had lost all taste for retirement, and rational society. The account in some measure for this change I must candidly in∣form you, that during my stay at Brussels I had formed an acquaintance with an Eng∣lish gentleman of the name of Rooksby.—He was a man of fortune, lived in an ex∣pensive stile, and (I blush while I own it,) at that very time lived publicly with a wo∣man of an abandoned character.</P>
<P>But, he had paid me numberless atten∣tions and a profusion of compliments, so fas∣cinating to the inxeperienced female heart, that I fancied, (fatal mistake!) had he an affectionate wife, whom he loved; she might reclaim him from the follies of which he seemed so fond. He had often professed a passion for me, but not openly, and there my errors commenced; for at his request I for∣bore to mention his pretensions of Monsieur
<PB N="68" REF="029439_0551_0FE11A4326264028"/>
or Madame Melville. That lady soon dis∣covered the alteration in my spirits, after my leaving Brussels, and inquired into the cause. I evaded her kind questions: and soon after her brother coming to their cha∣theaux on a visit brought Rooksby with him. My chagrin vanished; I was again chearful and happy. A change so visible could not escape Madame Melville's penetration; she imagined it might be the attractions of her brother (who was in every respect her coun∣terpart) which had made an impression on my heart. With a smile she entreated my confidence; but by the unembarrassed air with which I answered her interrogations she discovered her error. The smile was chang∣ed to a look of apprehension. "I hope Harriet, said she, you have not listened to any flighty tales from that young English∣man. I do not like his character. My brother brought him here from a motive of friendship to endeavour to detach him from a set of gamblers, who in combination with a very vile woman, are leading him blind∣fold to ruin. He is a very weak young man, and possesses no stability."</P>
<P>After this conversation she kept a very strict eye upon me, and soon discovered enough to make her think it necessary to send me back to the convent sooner than she at
<PB N="69" REF="029439_0552_0FE11A46D8646A50"/>
first intended. Rooksby followed me—I had not attempted to conceal from him the sentiments he had inspired me with. We found means to correspond: he laid a plan for my escape from the convent, I followed his pernicious councils, and we were pri∣vately married; but under a strict injunc∣tion never to divulge our marriage till he should give me leave. Imagining that obe∣dience to him was now become my first du∣ty, I took a most solemn oath, never to re∣veal our union, though by so doing, I could avert the heaviest misfortune. Gracious Heaven! how little did I suspect the dread∣ful calamity, which then hovered over my head? Happy as I was, in having, as I then thought, secured him to myself, I still felt a considerable alloy from the reflection that I had acted undutifully to my dear father; that I planted a dagger in his heart, per∣haps incurred his heaviest malediction, yet dared not sue to him for pardon. Another source of disquiet was, that whenever Mr. Rooksby was absent for any length of time, I suspected he was with Clara the woman he had so publicly kept. To divert the me∣lancholy, these fears occasioned, he propo∣sed going for a few weeks to Paris, and thi∣ther I accompanied him. I had been there but ten days when one night, as I was at the opera, dressed in the gayest stile and in
<PB N="70" REF="029439_0553_0FE11A4CD3D3FD20"/>
company with a woman to whom he had introduced me. Just as the performance began, I saw Madame Melville enter a box opposite to me, led by a gentleman whose face was from me. Judge, my dear sir, if possible, my emotions, when he turned round to seat himself, I discovered my fa∣ther. His pale dejected countenance struck me with horror, an involuntary shriek esca∣ped me, he raised his eyes, he saw!—he knew me!—"Great God!" said he, clasp∣ing his hands, and sunk from the seat in a state of insensibility. What my feelings were at that moment, I will not, I cannot pretend to describe; nor can I tell how I got round from the box where I sat to the one that contained my father. All was con∣fusion; but the distraction of my brain pre∣vented my attending to any thing, but my parent, whom I saw before me to all appear∣ance dead!—And, alas! bitter reflection, murdered by my ingratitude and disobedi∣ence!—</P>
<P>When he began to recover, madame Mel∣ville hurried him out of the house, and I followed them almost unknowingly into the carriage. My father suffered me to hold his hands in mine, but did not speak to me during the time we were going to Madame Melville house. When we alighted, I per∣cieved
<PB N="71" REF="029439_0554_0FE11A509E5F2198"/>
he trembled so he could scarcely stand. I followed him into a parlour, where he sunk upon a sopha. I fell on my knees before him. Forgive me, father, dear father, forgive me."</P>
<P>"Harriet," said he, "what am I to think from your appearance.—tell me, tell me instantly and without prevarication.—Are you married?"</P>
<P>"Do not ask me, I cannot answer."—"Enough," said he, "I understand my dis∣honour."—Oh! my father, will you not pronounce my pardon?</P>
<P>"Yes," said he feebly, "may heaven eternally bless you and forgive you as I do now." When I heard of your departure from the Convent it was like a bolt of ice shot through my heart. Oh! child, I have not had a moments peace since; but, if my pardon can give you comfort, from my soul I pardon you—But you are dishonoured. Oh! my child, how have you forgot what was due—</P>
<P>He was proceeding; but his voice faul∣tered and his head sunk on my shoulder, I thought it was a return of his faintness, and shrieked for help. Alas! how shall I
<PB N="72" REF="029439_0555_0FE11A55F5DA25E8"/>
proceed. The horrors of that moment will never be blotted from my memory. We raised and laid him on the sopha, we strove to revive him; but in vain. His noble soul had never known dishonour, and the springs of life before exhausted by sickness and many afflictions gave way at once under the pressure of a calamity he was not prepared to bear. Oh! sir, when I reflect on that night, when I remembered it was my folly, viper that I was; that stung him to the heart, my brain turns round, and only that he forgave me, with his parting breath, the very idea would deprive me of reason.</P>
<P>Madame Melville suffered me to remain at her house till the last duties ware paid to his beloved remains; but as my character was now become equivocal, she forbore ever after to shew me any countentnce. I sin∣cerely lamented the privation of her friend∣ship, and the more as I found it was an ex∣ample that was followed by every woman of character with whom she was acquainted.</P>
<P>My situation on that account became ex∣tremely painful, and I mentioned to Mr. Rooksby, my desire of returning to Abbe∣ville, to take possession of the small patri∣mony my father had left me. He acqui∣esced, and we set forward immediately.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="029439_0556_0FE11A589FE4F290"/>
Three months, three little months, passed on in tranquillity, when my husband inform∣ed me he had particular business which call∣ed him to Brussels, that it would be impos∣sible for him to return, and he thought it most expedient to sell off what furniture, &amp;c. we possessed, and to settle at that place.—Alas! my dear sir, fond of his society, and having no will but his, I hesitated not to comply.</P>
<P>At Brussels, a new scene presented itself; a scene which gave me a pain, impossible to describe! and which no one but a wife who loved as I did can possibly conceive.—Mr. Rooksby renewed his connection with a set of gamblers and swindlers, who live on the follies of the unwary.—He became their dupe and in a few months was a very beggar.—It was one hot afternoon, in the middle of August last, when overcome by the weight of the atmosphere, and oppres∣sed by my own reflections, I had retired to an arbour, which terminated the small space of garden belonging to the house we occu∣pied, and was endeavouring to divert my sorrow, by the perusal of an English novel, which had been recommended to my no∣tice. I was deeply interested in the sor∣rows of the "Welsh Heiress," (who never having known the pleasures of maternal ten∣derness,
<PB N="74" REF="029439_0557_0FE11A5E336CFE48"/>
felt her heart expand towards those whose affection supplied the place of a mo∣ther.) My mind was occupied, my heart softened, the tears stole from my eyes, but they were tears that flowed from a source so pleasing, I wished not to stop their course: for while sympathy for poor Anna's distres∣ses awakened my sensibility, I felt the most exquisite delight in the remembrance that there was an author, a female author<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mrs. Bennett, author of <HI>Juvenile Indiscretions,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE>, who in conjunction with a Burney and Lee would snatch the British novel from oblivion, and future ages should with pleasure peruse the productions of her pen. Pardon me, sir, but with such fervour do I revere those super∣latively happy few, who to a brilliant culti∣vated understanding, add a fertile natural genius, an elegant refined taste, and great sensibility, all other subjects are forgotten, and I am like a rapt enthusiast, all wonder and veneration. But to return to myself, I was employed in the perusal of the Welsh Heiress, when Rooksby with a hurried step and embarrassed air entered the arbour: he sat down beside me, struck his hand against his forehead, and breathed a sigh that seem∣ed to come from his heart. My dear uncle must have a bad opinion of my heart, if he thinks fictitious distress could longer engross my thoughts, and though he had been from
<PB N="75" REF="029439_0558_0FE11A61730D9C50"/>
me then above a fortnight, yet as I knew he was my husband—I also knew it was my duty to receive him on his return with a smile, and, if possible, alleviate the afflictions which seemed to oppress him. I threw aside my book and taking his hand inquired the cause of this visible dejection. He told me he was ruined past redemption, that he had even lost more than he possessed the means to pay.—Unexperienced, my heart overflowing with affection, I endea∣voured to sooth his sorrows; and to calm the immediate perturbation of his mind, I put into his hands almost the whole of my worldly possessions: for I thought the most abject poverty preferable to seeing him la∣bour under such dejection of spirits. He left me soon after and I, visionary like, amused myself with the hope of seeing him return (after he had paid his debts of ho∣nour) a true penitent, and that some little might be left from the wreck of his fortune, on which we might live in decent compe∣tence retired from the world, and yet enjoy all the real blessings of life.</P>
<P>But, alas! sir, these pleasing, delusive hopes lasted but a short time. Night ad∣vanced, and Rooksby did not return? Day after day passed, and I saw him not! I sent to inquire after him—he was still with his dis∣solute

<P>The perusal of this horrid billet threw me into a state of insensibility, and when I re∣covered the power of thinking, it was too late My husband was set off for England. I would have followed but a fever occa∣sioned by the agitation of my spirits, con∣fined me to my bed. Long and doubly tedi∣ous
<PB N="77" REF="029439_0560_0FE11A6A15DD61B0"/>
were the hours of sickness, as they pre∣vénted my following and even in prison attending him. The anxiety of mind re∣tarded my recovery, and I felt myself much hurt and neglected at receiving no tidings from Mr. Rooksby. At one moment, I thought him dead! at another, languishing on a bed of sickness. At length, I heard by accident, that he was recovered from the consequence of his wound, and this intelli∣gence in some measure relieving my anxiety, I began to regain my health, and when I was able set forward for England. On my ar∣rival in London, I went to a Mr. Le Sage, whom I had often heard Mr. Rooksby men∣tion was his banker.

She has held forth to me the hand of benevolence—though, much I fear, she has scarcely the means to support herself, as she told me the other day that she must leave the house she was then in, and discharge her servants, as her income would afford nothing but the neces∣saries of life; yet added she, with a smile of friendly attention, small as my power is, you shall be welcome to share with me the little I have left.</P>

Oh! my dear uncle, let me intreat you to extend your kindness towards me. All I request is means to return to France, and spend the remainder of my days as a pension∣er in a convent, where by a constant course of penitence and prayer I may in some mea∣sure atone for my offences.—One thing more. I hardly know how to write it; but—a few months will make me a mother. Should this unfortunate child of affliction prove a girl; with me shall she be buried in the shades of obscurity: if a boy to your care I must commit him, for alas! I have no means to support him, and may you, dear sir, teach him to avoid the vices of his father, and whenever he sees a wretched forsaken woman, to pity and endeavour to comfort her, in remembrance of the sorrows of his mother.—In hopes of your pardon and protection, I beg leave to stile myself your</P>

<HEAD>MERIEL, IN CONTINUATION.</HEAD>
<P>IT was not long after this letter was dis∣patched before Mr. Prevott came and personally offered to Harriet an asylum in his house. Their meeting was tender I shared her joys as far as my own unhappy situation would permit, but cordial as was the offered friendship of her uncle I could perceive he felt, severely felt, poor Harriet's dishonour. I was greatly relieved by her having found so able, so proper a protector; for indeed, my dear Celia, I was reduced very low, and two days after she left me I removed from the house at Pimlico and which we had taken ready furnished. I discharged my servant and would have persuaded good Deborah to re∣turn to Wales to her friends, offering to pay her expenses home. But this was attempting an impossibility. She told me I might send her from my presence, but no power should force her from London. She would remain near me, nay, she would serve me while she had life. Such a proof of disinterested fidelity awakened all my gratitude, and from that moment I took her for my companion, my friend, my adviser, and we removed together to a small lodging near the King's bench prison, where poor Rooksby was by this
<PB N="80" REF="029439_0563_0FE11A778FC99C58"/>
time removed; for his distresses were so complicated and his affairs in such a distract∣ed state it was impossible to procure his en∣largement. Here it was I first began my letter to you, in which I meant to have in∣cluded the whole account of my sad change, but my dear girl sickened with the measles, and after languishing near a month was taken to eternal bliss. I fear, my beloved Celia, I behaved in a manner unbecoming a Christian, I did not submit as I ought I gave way to despair and was punished by the loss of reason, for several weeks. In this situation Kingly once more stepped forward to preserve and rescue me from the horrors of a mad house; for to that dreadful state, or perhaps worse to that of a poor wandering lunatic destitute and forlorn, I might have been re∣duced but for his timely interposition. He had me removed to his own lodgings, at∣tended by the best Physicians, nay, he even extended his benevolence to my unfortunate husband, whose feelings had been strongly awakened by the death of his child. But those feelings were soon overcome, and his heart again become calous. When I first began to recover my recollection, it was carefully concealed from me where I was. Deborah by degrees informed me of all that had passed and told me Kingly requested to see me. I was too weak in mind and body to resist,
<PB N="81" REF="029439_0564_0FE11A7ADD6C64F8"/>
and for some time I was accustomed to pass an hour or two with him every day, I saw not the danger, the impropriety of my situa∣tion, till roused from my dream of security by the following circumstance.</P>
<P>I was well enough to leave my apartment for the adjoining room, where I had dined for the first time with Kingly, who, as he said, to surprize me agreeably had sent for his dear boys from school, and also Clara's two children, whom he has taken under his protection. At the first sight of the children my sorrows all revived and I gave way to a vio∣lent burst of tears, which relieved the oppres∣sion that seemed like a cord to be bound round my heart. I wept plentifully, nor did any one attempt to prevent me. The dear children had all by degrees drawn nearer to me, and the youngest boy climbing on my lap, wiped off my tears with his frock, whilst he kissed me and bade me not cry any more. I know not how it was; but the anguish of my heart gradually subsided. I am not destitute of comfort said I mentally; these dear children, the friendship of Kingly, is something yet! how many at this moment, a thousand times more deserving, are more wretched, more forlorn than I am. During dinner these reflections occupied my mind. I spoke little, but I felt a degree of serenity
<PB N="82" REF="029439_0565_0FE11A806C505470"/>
pervade my breast, to which it had long been a stranger. When the desert was re∣moved, the boys growing rather boisterous in their play were dismissed to another apart∣ment. Kingly seated himself next me. We were for some moments silent.</P>
<P>"I hope," said Kingly, "my dear Mrs. Rooksby, you will now soon be able to reap the benefit of fresh air, and go for a short time into the country. It will be of great service to you."</P>
<P>"I hope I shall," replied I, "soon be able to go out; for then I can go to poor Rooks∣by, for I wish to see him and learn how he is accommodated; I fear he has been very un∣comfortable during my illness."—"Surely my dear creature," said he, fixing his eyes on my face with a look of expressive tender∣ness, "surely you cannot mean to return to that man."</P>
<P>"Why not, Mr. Kingly. He certainly wants a friend and comforter under his present uneasy circumstances."—</P>
<P>"But are not his present calamities the fruit of his own folly; and has he not behaved in the basest manner to you? has he not for∣feited all right—</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="029439_0566_0FE11A84DE2B1948"/>
"Not to my duty and attention," said I, eagerly interrupting him, "if he has forgot his duty, it is no rule for me to neglect mine."</P>
<P>"But should you leave him, all the world would acquit you."</P>
<P>"Yes Kingly; but I must be acquitted by a higher, a more sacred tribunal than the world. I seek the approbation of my own conscience, and the continued protection of a Being; wise! as he is great and merci∣ful."—</P>
<P>"But surely, my dear Meriel, as you have done your duty, nothing more can be expect∣ed from you."</P>
<P>"Yes Kingly, yes while I live, and Rooks∣by is in existence I know my marriage vow is in full force; and may I soon be able to fulfill the sacred engagements I entered into."</P>
<P>"Oh! Meriel you surely love, spite of his errors this ungrateful Rooksby."</P>
<P>"No—no,—mistake me not, I mean not to arrogate to myself the merit of a virtue to
<PB N="84" REF="029439_0567_0FE11A89F6C93138"/>
which I have no claim. I pity him from my soul, nay would sacrifice my own peace; to restore his tranquillity; but did I love him; Oh! gracious heaven, did I love him, I could not live and retain my reason under my pre∣sent circumstances."</P>
<P>"Then, why Meriel, why will you sacri∣fice your own peace, to a chimerical notion of duty? If you love him not, why return to him: why fly from a man, who not only loves, but almost adores you? Then stay with me, thou beloved of my soul, share my fortune and be the friend of my bosom; Rooksby shall enjoy all the comforts, nay if you require it, all the elegancies of life."</P>
<P>Shall I tell you, my friend, shall I con∣fess that strong as was my sense of recti∣tude, I felt my resolution slacken. My treacherous heart even debated whether I should not stand excused, if I accepted his offer.—Oh, God! pardon the weakness of frail humanity, if for a moment, I forgot what was due to the Deity I served—the religion I professed. Yes, Celia, I listened, I thought myself convinced, and had con∣sented to leave the man to whom I had pro∣mised love and obedience to the latest pe∣riod of our lives.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="029439_0568_0FE11A8CC648D360"/>
Kingly, though ardent in his wishes for me to be seperated from my husband, was respectful in his behaviour and we passed the evening in a friendly conversation, which would not have called a blush on the cheek of a brother and sister. Deborah had during my illness always slept in my apartment. But a few nights preceding the one I have mentioned, we had prevailed on her to go to another room and suffer one of Kingly's servants to occupy her place on a mattress by my bed-side.</P>
<P>When I was retired to rest, when I no longer saw the expressive countenance, or heard the persuasive tongue of Kingly, re∣flection returned with double force, and I per∣ceived I was standing on the brink of a pre∣cipice, from which if I receded not in time, I must plunge into everlasting ruin. Weak as I still was from the effects of my disor∣der, I resolved to fly, while I had sufficient reason left to direct me from the dangerous temptations which surrounded me.—Forsa∣ken, injured by my husband, and under the immediate protection of the man, who first taught my heart to beat with affection, who had conferred on me obligations I could never repay, who still loved:—And, Oh! my dear Celia, (the glow of confu∣sion
<PB N="86" REF="029439_0569_0FE11A92B25D72A8"/>
covers me as I write it,) who still was beloved by me.</P>
<P>To deliberate a moment; was to be lost, another such an interview as the last, and I might rush on irretrievable destruction.</P>
<P>The servant who slept in the room with me, wearied by the employments of the day enjoyed a sound and undisturbed repose—The clock had struck three, when convinced of the danger of remaining longer under his roof, I resolved to fly from Kingly. A can∣dle was always burning in my room: I arose with as little noise as possible, wrapping my∣self as warm as I could and tying up a change of linen in a handkerchief, I glided softly down stairs, and opening the street door ventured into the street. I knew there were coaches employed in the night as well as the day, and did not fear but I should soon find one to convey me to the house where I had lodged, previous to the death of my ever regretted Clementina, and where I knew I should be received and might remain till the hour when I could be admit∣ted into the prison to my husband.</P>
<P>You will, perhaps, blame me, for leav∣ing the protection of Kingly, in so abrupt a manner. Perhaps you will say why not stay
<PB N="87" REF="029439_0570_0FE11A98505D8F58"/>
till the morning, and then inform him of my resolution.—Alas! my friend, I dared not stay. I was sensible of the weakness of my heart, and had he intreated! had he looked unhappy! I know it would not have been in my power to persevere.</P>
<P>His lodgings were in Westminster near the park, and I found no stand of coaches near. Add to this, my weakness and the penetrating keenness of the night air, made my head swim, and I staggered like a per∣son intoxicated. I was proceeding as well as I was able toward Westminster bridge, when a cry of thieves and a watchman's rattle ar∣rested my attention. I was then near the end of Parliament-street, and before I had time for a moments thought found myself surrounded by a number of watchmen, con∣stables and other strange looking people, who one and all, persisted that I was an ac∣complice with a gang of thieves, who had, by the assistance of the housekeeper, broke in and robbed a lady's house in George∣street.</P>
<P>I attempted to speak; but had not the power. A cold chillness seized me, and my limbs failed, though I still retained my sen∣ses and felt the horrors of my situation in their full force!—Imagine, my dear Ce∣lia,
<PB N="88" REF="029439_0571_0FE11A9DCFCBEA30"/>
for a moment what my feelings were. I feared my reason would again wander: but it pleased Heaven to preserve me from that dreadful calamity. They conveyed me without resistance to the watch-house, where they threw me like a beast upon the floor, imagining my inanimation to proceed from the effects of liquor. Though unable to speak, I groaned pitiously and felt the tears gush in torrents from my eyes: but still I was unnoticed by all, except a young creature who I am sure could not have counted above sixteen years, and who habited in a white bedgown, a tattered silk petticoat, and a pair of old sattin shoes that would scarcely save her feet from the ground, sat in a cor∣ner of the place near where they had thrown me down; and as I then verily believed, where I was to end my days. For the sud∣den shock that had deprived me of the power of speech and motion seemed like the stroke of death, and I lifted up my soul to that Pow∣er who I thought was calling me to himself from a world, where from a child, I had ex∣perienced little else but sorrow.</P>
<P>The poor girl, whom I heard them call Peggy, knelt down beside me raised my head on her knee and put a small glass of warm punch to my mouth, which the con∣stable had just given her.—"Let her alone
<PB N="89" REF="029439_0572_0FE11AA229623530"/>
Peggy, said he, she has had enough already. She is so drunk she can neither speak nor stand.—</P>
<P>"Poor soul," cried Peggy, in an accent of the softest compassion. "She is ill I can see she is, and may die for want of assist∣ance. Come, continued she, swallow a drop of this. It may revive you."</P>
<P>Celia, the love of life is so strongly im∣pressed on human nature, that though bend∣ing beneath the weight of almost insupport∣able afflictions we struggle still to preserve existence. I swallowed the offered refresh∣ment, Peggy chaffed my hands and laid my head upon her bosom; my spirits revived, my strength began to return and in less than half an hour I could articulate my thanks to my preserver. Till tea the ensuing morn∣ing I remained in this miserable place, nor was I even able to procure the least accom∣modation for myself or companion in sor∣row; for they had not only taken my bun∣dle from me but even rifled my pockets of a guinea and a half, which was all that I possessed in the world. At ten o'clock a coach was called and with several others I was carried to a justice's for examination; for it was alledged that I was the woman, who had opened the door to the thieves and
<PB N="90" REF="029439_0573_0FE11AA7458CF5A0"/>
that having got what booty I could myself, I was making off when they stopped me; in evidence of which they produced my little bundle which contained two shifts a petti∣coat two muslin handkerchiefs and a linen gown. The constable also swore that I had more property about me; but that I had thrown it away when they pursued me and they could find nothing but a gold watch chain which they had picked up, and which they immediately produced wrapped in a fine cambrick handkerchief. Judge my surprize, Celia, when on opening the handkerchief I saw my own watch chain, to which was fix∣ed a miniature of my departed child set round with pearls, and on which I had desired Deborah to raise some money, I imagine the faithful creature had deceived me and rais∣ed the money on something of her own—yet how the chain could be dropped by me was a mystery, unless as I have since reason to think it was with the gown I had packed up and might drop from the bundle. During my examination, a coach stopped at the door and an elderly lady entered. It was the lady, whose house had been attempted. The moment she saw me she pronounced me not guilty.</P>
<P>I never saw her before, said she, with vi∣sible emotion, and even had she lived in my house. I could not have suspected her.—</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="029439_0574_0FE11AAB6B7FF4B0"/>
I cannot, my dear Celia, describe this lady to you such as she appeared to me. There was a mixture of majesty and condescension in her manner, her countenance beamed be∣nignity, and it appeared a countenance ren∣dered grave by affliction rather than that by nature. Several other persons were now brought in, who had been apprehended by other watchmen, and from a variety of evi∣dences I was acquitted; when I heard those words pass the justice's lips, I was hastily leaving the place, but a man stopped me and told me I could not go till I had paid all fees.—"Indeed sir," said I, in a voice scarcely audible, "I have no money; that watch chain I think was mine, yet how it came here I know not nor dare I demand it. Permit me to go and if ever it is in my power"—"I shall do no such thing, mis∣tress," said the man, "either pay the fees or stay in our custody till you can."</P>
<P>I could not answer, but raising my hands and eyes to heaven was returning in silent agony when the lady advanced and in∣quired the cause of my new distress.</P>
<P>"And are these your British laws" said she, "that when a person is falsely accused and their innocence made perfectly appear, are they to be detained from their families
<PB N="92" REF="029439_0575_0FE11AB16EBDD200"/>
for the paltry consideration of a few shil∣lings?" She then put her hand in her pocket and presented me with two guineas, at the same time asking if she could be of any further service to me; I would have thanked her, but my feelings were too powerful to permit me to speak, she saw my gratitude, she perfectly comprehended from my looks more than words would convey.—"You interest me," said she, "can you not tell me how I may serve you. Oblige me, madam; make me your friend I will not abuse your confidence; but pardon me, I am to blame. This is no place for conversation. Do me the favour to wait till I have finished the disagreeable business that brought me here, and then give me leave to take you to any place you wish to go to in my carriage."—I curtsyed my assent to this humane proposal, for in∣deed Celia, I was unable to walk, and could but ill afford to procure a coach. Harrassed as my spirits had been, my strength was ex∣hausted and I was almost sinking with faint∣ness. When the lady had ended her business, she desired me to follow her, just as we were stepping out of the door, poor Peggy who was just released, passed us on the steps.—"Forgive me, madam," said I, "if I pre∣sume to share with this benevolent girl, the bounty of your hand. She did all in her power last night for me, I fear I should have
<PB N="93" REF="029439_0576_0FE11AB5B57A1428"/>
perished, but for her humanity."—I then gave her the remainder of the guinea I had changed to pay the fees of the office. "God bless you," said she, pressing the hand that offered her the money, while the tears start∣ed in her fine blue eyes. "And was she kind to you?" said the lady. I repeated the circumstance of the preceding night. "Good girl," said she, "have you any friends?" addressing Peggy.</P>
<P>"Oh! no Madam," I am a poor, guilty, forlorn creature: lost to every thing but a sense of my own misery."</P>
<P>"So young, and yet accuse yourself of guilt." "Alas Madam, I was involved in guilt before I knew the value of virtue."</P>
<P>The lady answered not; but giving her a card, bade her call on her in the afternoon, and she would do something for her.</P>
<P>"And now," said she, as she seated her∣self in her carriage, "tell me where you wish to go."</P>
<P>"To the Kings bench prison, madam." "To a prison, good heavens! have you friends there?"</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="029439_0577_0FE11B1B99BAF1D0"/>
"My husband, madam, is confined there."</P>
<P>"Have you any children?</P>
<P>"I had, madam, one, a sweet girl:—but"—I could not proceed. I turned my face from her, and we both remained silent for several minutes.—</P>
<P>"I too," said the lady, starting as it were from a deep reverie. "I too, once had a child—a girl—nay, perhaps have still; but for many! many! years, she has been lost to me."</P>
<P>When we drew near to the end of our little journey, she told me she felt inclined to be my friend, and if I would do her the favour to call at her house and point out the means, she would readily exert her utmost abilities to alleviate the afflictions, which seemed to press so heavily upon me. She then told me her name was Harcourt and wished me a good morning.</P>
<P>Weak, oppressed, dejected my trembling limbs being scarce able to support me, I slow∣ly ascended the stairs, which led to the apart∣ment occupied by Rooksby. The door was opened. I was just entering, but a sight met my eyes that almost annihilated me. It was
<PB N="95" REF="029439_0578_0FE11ABB0C642268"/>
Rooksby seated beside his infamous Clara, with tea and coffee on the table before them. From their own dishabille and the appearance of the room, I perceived they were but just risen. I know not what I said in the first moment of surprize, but I remember clasp∣ing my forehead hard with both my hands and exclaiming, "grant me patience hea∣ven." As I ran down stairs, my brain seemed whirling in perpetual motion and had I not been detained by one of the keepers of the prison I fear I should have rushed in∣to the street in a state little short of insanity.</P>
<P>The recollection of what I then suffered is too much for my weak spirits. I cannot proceed in my narrative. Adieu, my friend∣ly Celia, I am now in a place of safety and will, when I am able, inform you of every occurrence down to the present time. Hea∣ven bless you.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXII. FREDERIC KINGLY, <ABBR>ESQ.</ABBR> to COL. ONSLOW.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>March</HI> 7<HI>th,</HI> 1789.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I HARDLY dare take up my pen to write to the worthy Onslow: for I have ren∣dered myself totally unworty of his friend∣ship. Will you and your amiable Amelia believe it? No you will think it impossible, that I—I, who so often have sworn to pro∣tect her, should act in so thoughtless a man∣ner as to drive the lovely Meriel from my house. Yes, Onslow, she left my house in the night, unattended and rushed into dan∣gers, of which her delicate mind could form no idea; and my folly was the cause. I forgot what was due to her honour and my own, and dared to solicit her to quit her hus∣band and remain with me. Oh! fool, madman that I was, when I knew the dig∣nity of her mind, to think she would suffer such a thought to harbour in her bosom for a moment. She once loved me;—yes, and
<PB N="97" REF="029439_0580_0FE11AC448A420B0"/>
with a voice soft as harmony, yet with looks and manners chaste as Diana, has she late∣ly confessed she still does and ever shall love me. But did I not know the heart of Meriel Howard. Was I not sensible, that with all her sexes softness she possessed the firmness and intrepidity of a Spartan matron? But I am tormenting you with suspense while I am writing an eulogium on her, with whose virtues you are already well acquainted.</P>
<P>The dear creature had recovered so far as to be able to leave her apartment, when the conversation passed between <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which frightened her from the protection I had vainly hoped would have henceforth shelter∣ed her from all the ills of life. She had supped with me, and on retiring, wished me a good night with a look and voice so full of tenderness, that I longed to press her to my heart: but I forbore and only kissed her hand. Early the next morning, I was awakened by poor Deborah, who asked me if I knew where her lady was—for she was not in her apartment, nor had the servant who slept in her room seen her. Terrified, least her unfortunate malady should have re∣turned, I hastily arose and inquired of eve∣ry person in the house if they had seen her; but to no purpose. The street door was found unlock'd and on searching her apart∣ment
<PB N="98" REF="029439_0581_0FE11AC7B9C2AEA0"/>
her hat and cloak with a few ne∣cessaries were missing. It then rushed into my mind that her own sensibility and strict sense of rectitude had driven her from my protection. Where could she go? Her friends or rather those who had once stiled themelves so, had all forsaken her in her misfortunes—to whom then could she go? Distracting as the thought was, I concluded she was gone to her base treacherous hus∣band. Impressed with this idea, I went im∣mediately to the prison; but she had not been there. I did not attempt to see Rooks∣by, I could not have spoken to him with calmness. I returned home almost deprived of reason, nor had I any tidings of the dear fugitive, till late in the afternoon, when I received the following note.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>MRS. ROOKSBY. to F. KINGLY, <ABBR>ESQ.</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>YOU are no doubt uneasy; let this calm your fears, I am safe. Reason told me I must not remain any longer with you. I came to my husband; but something has occurred, which I cannot now explain, and which makes it impossible for me to remain with him. We have parted, I be∣lieve,
<PB N="99" REF="029439_0582_0FE11ACD830CAB90"/>
forever.—But I charge you, Kingly, endeavour not to find me out,—I wish not to see you again. It is a meddling world. They have been already too busy with our names.—Think me not ungrateful for your friendship: it will never be obliterated from my mind while I have life; but it is fit, it is proper we should meet no more.—I know my faithful Deborah will wish to come to me. Bid her come with the bearer of this, who waits. But oh! Kingly, unless you wish to add another weight to my already insupportable afflictions, make no attempt to see me.—Heaven bless you, forever bless you, I cannot express all I wish; perhaps did I feel less, I could write with more eloquence.—As my last request I intreat you not to withdraw your bounty from the chil∣dren of Clara. They are innocent, whatever are the crimes of their parents. Oh Kingly, if you could see my heart, you would see it bleed with real anguish, while I tell you we must not cannot meet again. Once more, God bless you, and reward you for your kindness to the wretched</P>

<P><PB N="100" REF="029439_0583_0FE11ACFEBF8F928"/>
Though I earnestly desired to see the suf∣fering angel, her commands, her pathetic entreaties to me were sacred; I sent for Deborah and giving her ten guineas bade her hasten to her mistress and to let me know when she wanted more cash. The faithful old woman sobbed with joy when I told her that her lady was safe; and left the room almost with the alacrity of a girl, when she was told to follow the messenger who brought the letter.</P>
<P>The next morning, the money was return∣ed in a small parcel, which I received and opened without knowing from whence it came. On the inner paper were these words. "Dear generous Kingly, I am already over∣whelmed with obligations from you. Pardon me, I can receive no more." There was no name annexed; but I knew the dear characters had been traced by the hand of Meriel.—Resolved, if possible, still to serve her, even against her inclination, I went to my agent and desired him to go to the bench, make inquiry for Deborah and pretend to pay some money that was owing to old Mr. Howard. But here I failed; for when my agent re∣turned, he informed me that Mrs. Rooksby had been with her husband that she remained only a short time and where she was gone no one could tell. He also informed me
<PB N="101" REF="029439_0584_0FE11AD5CBA1FB48"/>
that Rooksby had a woman in the apartment with him, who had been thrown into prison about three weeks before by a Mercer, to whom she was indebted upwards of a hundred pounds, and that both of them expected soon to be released. From his description of the woman's person, I should suppose it to be the infamous Clara; but think it almost impossi∣ble, as I was informed she was living at Brussels only a short time since in great splendor with a man of the first rank and for∣tune. Should it prove so, I shall pronounce him a blacker villain than I ever thought him: and how like an angel will the villainy of the one and the ingratitude of the other make Meriel appear, who in the very mo∣ment that she was so cruelly treated by them could recommend their children to my care. I will obey her, Onslow. They shall share the education of my own boys, and I make no doubt of being able to provide for them either in the army or navy.—</P>
<P>Every inquiry after Meriel is vain She has hid herself so effectually as to elude the strictest search, I can no longer stay in Eng∣land I have solicited employment in the West-Indies and shall soon sail. I have commission∣ed
<PB N="102" REF="029439_0585_0FE11ADAA4A875E0"/>
my agent to continue his search for Mrs. Rooksby and should he discover the place of her retreat to supply her with cash, without suffering her even to suspect from whom it comes. I am certain wherever she is, she is in necessity. Good heavens, that I should live to say, while I am in possession of all the superfluities of life, Meriel Howard, the first choice of my heart, the woman I love and revere above all her sex, is perhaps languish∣ing for want of the means to support ex∣istence. I will write no more I am almost devoid of reason when I think for a moment on the subject.</P>
<P>I hardly dare desire my remembrance to your Amelia. I know how she loved and esteemed Meriel, and I have some faint hope that she will hear from the dear suffer∣er's own hand how she has disposed of her∣self; for certain I am, that while life warms the heart of Meriel Howard, it will glow with grateful affection for Amelia Sidney. And while I live, I shall remain your's in friendship.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXIII. MERIEL to CELIA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>May</HI> 20<HI>th,</HI> 1789.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I BROKE off abruptly in my last, for I found my spirits were unequal to the task of retracing scenes which had given me so much uneasiness. I informed you of my discovery of Clara in the prison with Rooksby; but I am yet to inform you that when, by the humanity of one of the keep∣ers, I was prevailed on to go into a room and endeavour to compose myself, I receiv∣ed a verbal message from my cruel tyrant, desiring me to leave him to his fate and re∣turn to my favourite Kingly, with whom he knew I had publicly lived for several weeks in defiance of shame. A message so injurious, so unjust, roused my resentment, and I de∣manded to see the cruel man, who could thus dare to insult me.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="029439_0587_0FE11AE429F397F0"/>
I once more ascended the stairs to his a∣partment, and knocking at the door, entered with as much resolution, as I could assume.</P>
<P>He received me with a mixture of confu∣sion and contempt, and Clara, without deigning to rise from her seat; gave a slight inclination of the head: but at that mo∣ment I felt myself a wife, an innocent injur∣ed wife! and resentment conquered every other feeling!—</P>
<P>"Rooksby!" said I, seating myself op∣posite to him, and regarding him with a fixed attention, "I come to inquire by what action of my life, I have incurred the unjust censures you have thrown upon me, or in what I have forfeited my claim to your regard, since I have been your wife."</P>
<P>"By your vile connection with Belger, before you were my wife—and your still more infamous intrigue with Kingly since!" said he, in a kind of hurried accent, as though conscious he did not himself believe what he asserted.</P>
<P>"By all my hopes of future felicity, Rooks∣by," I replied, "I am innocent of what you accuse me, as was the infant I bore—and who, I trust, is now an angel in the
<PB N="105" REF="029439_0588_0FE11AE9558D0F30"/>
mansions of the blest!"—At the recollection of my child, tears, in spite of my efforts to suppress them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urst from my eyes.—Rooksby was affected.</P>
<P>"Poor Clementina," said he, rising and coming toward me, I should have liked to have seen her once more, before she was gone forever."</P>
<P>Clara, saw she was losing ground; so rising in great haste, she told him that when he had settled the difference that had been between us, perhaps, she might look in and congra∣tulate us; that content was a great blessing, and a forgiving temper, a sure sign of a good christian; that for her part, she had good reason to suppose both Mrs. Belger and Mrs. Kingly fell victims to my art, for their hearts were broken by their husbands, whose affections I had exerted myself to obtain, and had effectually drawn from them."</P>
<P>"If," said I with more firmness than I believed myself capable of, "if every wo∣man in the world was as free from the crime of seducing the affection of a husband from his wife as I am, it would be well for many. But, be not mistaken, Clara, I come not to sue to my husband, or endeavour to re∣gain his heart, I am at length convinced I
<PB N="106" REF="029439_0589_0FE11AEDC33A9D48"/>
never possessed it, and as it would have been happy for us, had we never met; I am de∣termined that we will here part forever!!!"</P>
<P>"Forever, Meriel," said Rooksby, "leave me forever?"—</P>
<P>Clara's countenance brightened, and she resumed her seat.</P>
<P>"I am well convinced, Rooksby," I re∣plied, "that so far from having it in my power to serve or oblige you, my presence is painful to you, and I am considered a burthen.—The pain, the burthen shall therefore be removed."</P>
<P>"And you will return to Kingly?"</P>
<P>"No! Rooksby.—Here in the awful face of Heaven, I swear, I never have, nor ever will dishonour the name of your rever∣ed mother: a name, which at her request I received from you. And, that Heaven is my witness, was the chearful discharge of my duty a source of happiness to you, as no power on earth should seperate me from you!—I would remain with you in the most abject distress—comfort you—nay, even labour for your support! but—as it is—we must part!!!—I forgive
<PB N="107" REF="029439_0590_0FE11AF341C6A2B8"/>
you from my soul, every injury—not on∣ly you! but, those who have been the cause of your errors!—I will pray for your happiness—and forget, if possible—how cruelly and how often you have wronged me!"—</P>
<P>"I am villain!" said he, rising and strik∣ing his forehead with vehemence.</P>
<P>"Before we part Rooksby," cried I, lay∣ing my hand on his arm, " I solemnly con∣jure you as the last and only request I shall ever make, seek not to palliate your own faults by taxing me with guilt. I am con∣scious of my own innocence, and feel not the sharpness of the accusation; but it in∣creases your own offences in the sight of Heaven!—I forgive every thing that has past—only, throw not an odium on my character, and I will bless you forever!"—</P>
<P>"You are, you must be innocent," said he, "I believe you are pure as an angel. You are a treasure too great for me to possess. I have voluntarily thrown you from me, and though I know your worth, some strange fatality ever pursues me, and the weakness of my nature hurries me to actions which I know are wrong."</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="029439_0591_0FE11AF7276192D0"/>
"Farewel!" said I, turning to leave the room.</P>
<P>"But whither are you going, Meriel, I fear you are in want. My affairs begin to wear a better aspect. I have had a few thou∣sands left me by a relation. Let me know where to send to you that you may share in my fortune, though I can never hope again to possess a place in your heart.—His voice faultered and he actually shed tears. Celia, Rooksby is a man so weak so unstable in his nature that the impulse of the moment ever hurries him away: and perhaps just then he would have sued for a reconciliation and had he been master of the world offered to divide it with me. And the first moment Clara had an opportunity to exert her art, she would have revived all his suspicions and I should again been ill treated, vilified, nay, perhaps thrust like an abandoned wretch from his house.</P>
<P>Sensible of this versatility of temper I wish∣ed not to prolong our interview, besides I was faint and exhausted. The spirits which resent∣ment had roused were now begining to subside and when I considered his errors and the weakness of his nature I only considered him as an object of compassion. The presence of Clara too was insupportably painful, I,
<PB N="109" REF="029439_0592_0FE11AFC8E7B0FD0"/>
therefore, almost forcibly tore myself from him and hurring down stairs immediately left the prison, and went to the lodgings I had occupied before.</P>
<P>The woman of the house received me kindly. After I had taken some refreshment I lay down and endeavoured to procure a little rest; but the effort was ineffectual.—The scenes I had been engaged in the pre∣ceding night and day entirely occupied my thoughts; the idea of Kingly's surprize and uneasiness when he should discover my hav∣ing left him; the sorrow of my affectionate Deborah, my own forlorn situation, and dreary future prospect, all conspired to banish from my eyes the balmy comfort of sleep. I arose, and procuring pens and paper, wrote a few lines to my husband informing him where I was, that he might not say I had prevented his assisting me by not letting him know where to send. I also wrote to Kingly in a manner which I knew would effectually prevent his endeavouring to see me; but desired him to send Deborah back with the person, who brought the letter.</P>
<P>I passed the night in a very restless man∣ner, and in the morning was unable to rise. A fever, want of appetite, and great lassi∣tude, hung upon me for above ten days.—
<PB N="110" REF="029439_0593_0FE11AFFD09E3A08"/>
Indeed, I thought I was going into a rapid dicline; but the care of Deborah, who nur∣sed me with incessant tenderness, and part∣ed even with some of her apparel to pro∣cure me proper and nourishing food, restored me to some degree of my wonted strength. During this time, I heard nothing from Rooksby: though perfectly satisfied, that his fickle disposition had operated as usual, and that no longer seen, I was no longer remembered, yet something prompted me to send to the bench and inquire after him. Deborah was my messenger; she returned and told me he had been released above a week. I then sent to Le Sage; but without letting him suspect who made the inquiry, and learned that my husband, (Oh, Heavens! happy had I been, had he never borne that title!) had left England in company with Clara; for I particularly desired the person who inquired, to ask, wherever he was, if he was alone.</P>
<P>It was now time to think of some means of support, Gratitude also required that I should call on the benevolent Mrs. Harcourt. I dressed myself as neat as the scanty state of my wardrobe would allow and repaired to her house. At my approach, I saw the shutters of the upper part were closed; my heart sunk; but yet I ventured to knock
<PB N="111" REF="029439_0594_0FE11B05850994D0"/>
at the door. A woman servant opened it. I inquired for Mrs. Harcourt. "She is at "Bath," replied the woman. "Has she been ill then?"—"Yes, she caught cold on the night her house was robbed, which ad∣ded to the fright, brought on the gout in her stomach. She was taken ill the next evening and for several days was thought in great danger; but she is now better, and yesterday morning set off for Bath."</P>
<P>I thanked the woman for her information and was going from the door, when who should I see cross the hall but Peggy. She saw and instantly recollected me: an exclamation of joy and surprize escaped her and she ran to the door to speak to me. She informed me that Mrs. Harcourt had taken her into the house as an assistant to the housekeeper that the kind lady had mentioned me previous to her departure, and desired if I called I would leave word where I might be found. I told Peggy I was not settled in any place at present; but I would call again in the course of a fortnight when I hoped to hear of Mrs Harcourt's perfect recovery.</P>
<P>On my return, I consulted with Deborah, what we could possibly do to earn a subsist∣ence. The affectionate creature could think of nothing. She could only weep that I was
<PB N="112" REF="029439_0595_0FE11B0880173568"/>
obliged to have recourse to work. After re∣volving many various schemes in my mind, I at length fixed on one, that I thought was feasible—It was to send Deborah to the woman, who had formerly supplied me with millinery, and to desire her to inquire in my name whether she could give employment to a reputable young woman, who was in an ill state of health and only able to work at her own apartment. Deborah executed the com∣mission faithfully and on her return told me she had procured employment for me at a great warehouse, where she had been recom∣mended by the person to whom I sent her.</P>
<P>"But dear madam," said she, the prices are so very small, you will never be able to live on what you earn."—This did not deter me. I removed to a room near the warehouse for which I was to work; that our time might not be taken up in going backwards and for∣wards. Deborah procured the work and I executed it. I gave great satisfaction and had as much as myself and Deborah could pos∣sibly do, yet with the most indefatigable in∣dustry, we could scarcely earn eighteen or twenty shillings a week. The close applica∣tion to my employment did not agree with my health, and I was obliged to devote an hour every day to exercise, nor did even this answer the desired end, and I was in a short
<PB N="113" REF="029439_0596_0FE11B0E09343F38"/>
time so pale and thin that you would scarce∣ly have believed me to have been the Meriel Howard you once knew. Ill as I was, I still continued my employment as well as I was able; but weakness and fatigue often over∣came me and I was obliged to give up hours to rest, and sometimes whole days</P>
<P>My weakness encreased, and my income proportionally decreased. I saw famine ad∣vancing with hasty strides, and to add to my affliction I knew the affection of De∣borah had involved her in my distresses. My lodging was in Oxford-street, and I some∣times walked into the fields which are adja∣cent to the parish of Bloomsbury. One day, as with slow uneven pace I took my accus∣tomed walk, just as I had reached Gower∣street, I saw a splendid equipage pass me and stop at a house which seemed newly fitted up. I cannot accouut for the curiosity that seized me; but I inquired of a man who had the appearance of a Butler; to whom the house and carriage belonged.</P>
<P>"To Mr. Howard" said the man—Mr. Howard; what Howard?</P>
<P>"I don't know," he replied, "what his Christian name is, but he is lately returned from India".—</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="029439_0597_0FE11B11BB65A488"/>
Astonishment rendered me silent, and the man proceeded.—</P>
<P>"He came over about two months since, and took that house. I then lived the next door and knew all that passed in the family. He brought a young lady over with him, who is very pretty; but seems unhappy. She is very young indeed; and he is going to marry her; but I think it is against her inclination: for though I have heard the ser∣vants say she seemed to respect him, she of∣ten declares she can never love him.—</P>
<P>I mused upon what the man had told me and was determined to inquire farther about this Mr. Howard. It might be my brother, and the sums I had advanced it might now be in his power to return; not that I intended to ask him for them but, methought, natu∣ral affection would certainly operate in his bosom in behalf of a sister who had shared all her property with him and was now bent to the earth with sickness and sorrow.—On farther inquiry I learned that his name was Richard Howard. Determined to make at least a trial of him, I learned at what hour it would be most likely to see him, for as he was become a great man, I readily conceiv∣ed my only being his sister and in distress would but poorly plead my excuse for going
<PB N="115" REF="029439_0598_0FE11B16D84F9260"/>
at an unseasonable time. Far be it from me, my dear Celia, to say this is the case with all, there are some glorious ornaments of the creation who never turn from the cry of affliction, and who never consider it intrusive; whose hearts are ever open and whose hands are ever ready to dispense to those who are in want, a part of those bles∣sings which a bounteous Providence has showerd on themselves:—but the thorough knowledge I have of the human heart led me to reflect, that when a person has unex∣pectedly risen to opulence from obscurity, his feelings grow callous he forgets and to∣tally neglects those branches of his family who, though perhaps they have been equal∣ly industrious with himself, have not been equally the favourites of fortune.</P>
<P>At ten o'clock one morning, I knocked at Mr. Howard's door; and was requested by the servant to send up my name, I did so, adding that I had particular business with him. After waiting about ten minutes (for I suppose my dress had not prepossessed the man in my favour.) I was told I might come up.—My limbs trembled as I entered the room. The first glance convinced me it was my brother, though he is greatly in∣creased in bulk, being now a very stout man, and when we parted he was but a slender
<PB N="116" REF="029439_0599_0FE108554729B998"/>
lad, yet his features were the same. He was sitting at breakfast with a very young lady, who appeared dejected and unhappy. I ima∣gined this to be the person of whom the ser∣vant spoke.</P>
<P>He gave a slight inclination of the head as I entered, the servant brought forward a chair and left the room.</P>
<P>"Now madam," said the haughty master of the house, "what is your pleasure?"</P>
<P>"Is it possible," said I, looking earnestly at him, "that you can have no recollection of me?—</P>
<P>"Not the least, I do not recollect that I ever saw you before."</P>
<P>"You had once a sister, sir.—</P>
<P>"Yes I had, but she was always a strange eccentric girl; she ran through a very good fortune, and I understand has disgraced her family in the most shocking maner."</P>
<P>"Brother," said I, emphatically, "and I felt my eyes gush out with tears.—</P>
<P>He sat down the cup, which he was raising to his lips, and with a look of mingled anger
<PB N="117" REF="029439_0600_0FE11B20C1EF0690"/>
and astonishment, cried, "why surely you can never be Meriel Howard."—</P>
<P>"I am your sister, I am all that remains of Meriel Howard, but I no longer bear that name."—</P>
<P>"I was told you had assumed the name of a gentleman with whom you lived some years, but he has left you through your own folly."—</P>
<P>"And who could assert such a falsehood, brother?"—</P>
<P>"My Aunt Mossop told me, and so did Hester, who is well married. Susan wrote them word that you behaved in such a man∣ner some few years since upon the continent, as occasioned the person you lived with to fight a duel on your account: that you se∣perated then and had never lived together since."</P>
<P>The slight, the cutting indifference of my brother, wounded me to the soul. I was debilitated in mind and body, yet I could hardly restrain the fulness of my heart; be∣ing unable to support the interview any longer, I arose to depart; for he had nei∣ther asked me to eat or drink. The young
<PB N="118" REF="029439_0601_0FE11B247114D990"/>
lady looked at me, and I saw the tear of compassion start in her eyes.</P>
<P>"I am very sorry, Meriel," said my bro∣ther, "that you are in such indifferent circumstances as your appearance seems to bespeak, if a couple of guineas"</P>
<P>"No, sir!" said I, putting back the hand extended with the money, if I am un∣worthy to be received as your sister, I am unworthy of your assistance: besides, bro∣ther, I came in hopes to find an affection∣ate relative, a friend, whose heart would compassionate my sufferings. Disappointed in that—I am too proud to accept a dona∣tion from your bounty!"—"As you please, madam!" bowing coldly, "had you con∣ducted yourself in a manner becoming my sister"—</P>
<P>"Brother, had I come to your door in a splendid equipage, perhaps, you would not have inquired so strictly into my conduct. In that case even the errors of which I am now accused, would have been overlooked; but poverty is a fault the opulent can sel∣dom pardon. I am happy, brother, to see the advancement of your fortune; but, should you ever experience a reverse, you will then discover, that those who now ca∣ress
<PB N="119" REF="029439_0602_0FE11B2A584D5810"/>
and flatter you, nay, even would creep into your favour by vilifying me, would be the first to turn from you; and blame you for misfortunes you could neither avoid nor avert!"</P>
<P>"I see Meriel," said he, "with a sneer, "you at least retain one striking trait in your character, you are as good a preacher as ever."</P>
<P>"I will take care to retain every trait," I replied, "for which I have been respected. I have now lost the name of Howard, and can no longer disgrace it by my poverty; and I hope my affluent brother will never let that name be dishonoured by him."</P>
<P>I then bade him good morning, with∣out being requested to renew my visit. I was now so accustomed to disappointment that I felt not this behaviour of my brother so severely as I should have done some few years since. Indeed, my dear friend, I think my heart grows hard and insensible, and seems turning into stone, for it is cold and inanimate. I can no longer exult in the happiness, or sympathize in the miseries of my fellow creatures. The world appears one universal blank, nay even when I think of you and my Amelia, it still beats but lan∣guidly,
<PB N="120" REF="029439_0603_0FE11B2E467FD950"/>
its emotions are no longer exquisitely pleasant or painful, but like the faint rays of an expiring taper now and then emits a flash of light that for a moment chears the gloom of a solitary apartment, and after a few struggles is entirely extinguished. So my heart, which feels a degree of kindly warmth play round it, when I think of your affection, will perhaps a little longer struggle to illumine this frail tenement; then sink to peace in the dark mansion of the grave.—But why should I infest you with my melan∣choly? I fear I am an ungrateful wretch; for I have found a friend when I least ex∣pected it, and one who exerts his power to preserve a life that is no longer of value to me; because it is entirely useless to society. My poor Deborah too, she is still faithful and affectionate. I have still much to be thankful for; but such is the frailty of hu∣man nature, we remember our sorrows with a repining mind, while we forget the bene∣fits of which we we are unworthy parta∣kers.</P>
<P>I have written this at various opportuni∣ties when my time and strength would per∣mit. I shall now dispatch it, as you are I am sure ever anxious to hear from me, I will write again soon, and believe, till my heart
<PB N="121" REF="029439_0604_0FE11B342E476D68"/>
is devoid of all sensation, it will ever love you and pray for your happiness.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXIV. MERIEL to CELIA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>August 19th, 1789.</HI></DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MY dear friend, I have once more set down to address to you, to tell you I every day draw nearer and nearer the goal, to which we are all hastening, where I shall again embrace my dear Clementina, and be parted from her no more!—I told you, in my last, that I had unexpectedly found a friend, who had used his utmost en∣deavours
<PB N="122" REF="029439_0605_0FE11B37C6766370"/>
to serve me. It was Mr. Friend∣ly, the gentleman to whose care, my regret∣ted benefactor, Mr. Weldon, so strenuously recommended me before he left England. I was one morning at the warehouse, from whence I had employment, when he came in and with him a woman extremely gay in her appearance; but many years younger than himself. She was what might by many have been called pretty; but to me there appeared nothing in her features that could deserve that name. It was an unmeaning countenance, devoid of sensibility, and if it had any character, it was that of pride and impetuosity.</P>
<P>She purchased some very expensive arti∣cles, for which he stopped to pay, and she went off in the chariot, to make, as she said, some morning visits. From what I saw, I feared the good old gentleman had entered the matrimonial pale with a person no ways qualified to make him happy; and the event proved I was not mistaken in my conjectures. As I was so greatly altered in person, as not to be recollected by a bro∣ther, I could not suppose Mr. Friendly would know me; but I was mistaken; for as I was speaking to the person who was giv∣ing me out my work, he turned round has∣tily
<PB N="123" REF="029439_0606_0FE11B3CE60110A0"/>
and looked at me as though endeavour∣ing to recollect my features.</P>
<P>"There are but small remains of the per∣son," said he, coming toward me, "but I could almost swear that was the voice of Miss Howard." You know, Celia, I have often been remarked for the softness of my voice, and I believe many, who would not otherwise recollect me, know me the mo∣ment I speak. I curtsyed, acknowledged he was right, and left the shop. I had not proceeded many paces before he overtook me, and offering me his arm, with the so∣licitude of a father, inquired into my cir∣cumstances. He had heard I was well mar∣ried, but nothing more; my present ap∣pearance did not confirm the report; he wished to know if he could serve me. Be∣fore I could satisfy his laudable curiosity, we had reached the door of the house where I lived.</P>
<P>"I have an hour to spare, said he, "may I be admitted, "I cannot leave you till I know how you are situated. I am perfect∣ly acquainted with the goodness of your heart; but I know with all your virtues, you have weaknesses more prejudicial to your interest and happiness than some which are called vices. You are credulous; and
<PB N="124" REF="029439_0607_0FE11B41CDF935A0"/>
you let a sense of duty sometimes hurry you to actions which are not strictly right. Let me know how you are situated; tell me yourself what has seperated you from your husband."</P>
<P>Shall I confess, my dear Celia, shame at the mean apartment I occupied, for a mo∣ment crimsoned my cheek; and made me hesitate to admit him up stairs; but grati∣tude for the kind solicitude he expressed, a reverential remembrance of the noble spirit∣ed Weldon, whose friend he was: conspi∣red to conquer this unseasonable emotion of pride, and I led the way to my little garret, (for such it literally is.) Deborah looked surprised at my introducing a man into an apartment, which constituted our dining room, drawing room, bed chamber, and kitchen. But when she heard me mention Mr. Weldon, whose name she knew I re∣spected, and whose friends I should ever consider as mine, she was perfectly satisfied; and when she found the good old gentleman meant to prove his friendship to Weldon, by his attention to me, I thought she would have gone wild with joy. She drew a chair close to his, nor could all my endeavours to the contrary, prevent her informing him of all she knew, concerning Rooksby; and when she mentioned my drawing my sub∣sistence
<PB N="125" REF="029439_0608_0FE11B46ECFB2EB8"/>
from labour, and my evident ill state of health; she took his hand and pressed it to her heart; while the tears rolled in big drops down her aged face. I could not see her emotions unmoved: I arose from my seat and pretended to look after the dinner, which Deborah, from her friendly anxiety to promote my interest, had totally neglect∣ed; and unseen, gave a loose to sensations which almost overpowered me.</P>
<P>Mr. Friendly would not leave me, till he had prevailed with me to give up my em∣ployment, to leave the place I then inhabi∣ted, and go to apartments, which he would provide a little way out of town.—"You shall not be obliged," said he, "for I know that is what would most afflict your proud spirit. You think you are humble," (added he with a smile) "but I know you better. You ever was and ever will be very proud: but I like you the better for it. It is the right sort of pride; it is a pride, which shrinks from the weight of obligation which it has not power to return.—Now to obviate that, you have it in your power to oblige me. I have taken a young creature under my protection, (for I am quite a knight er∣rant in the cause of the ladies,) she is, I be∣lieve, a girl of good fortune, and strictly virtuous, but very unfortunate. Now if
<PB N="126" REF="029439_0609_0FE11B4B8C2B7E68"/>
you will take her for your companion and teach her, as I know you possess abilities, how to amuse at once her time and enrich her mind, I will supply you with the means. Some other time you may learn how I came to take her under my care. Perhaps, she herself, when she perceives the gentleness of your nature, will confide more to you, than from the difference of our sex she possibly could to me.</P>
<P>As to the means of your support, I have some connections, in the island of St. John's in America, who send to me for thick cloaks, &amp;c. fit for the climate; now it strikes me that you might make those garments, at a good profit for yourself, and yet leave a sufficient for me."</P>
<P>When I sound, he did not wish me to re∣ceive obligations from him, without some means to repay them, I was willing to lis∣ten to his plan, and in less than ten days from the time I first saw him, I was remov∣ed to apartments in Islington, where he sent the young lady to me, whom he had taken under his protection. It was evening when she arrived; I was ill, I was fatigued—had retired to bed and saw her not till the next morning. Oh! Celia, I am very ill now—my head is giddy—I can proceed no farther
<PB N="127" REF="029439_0610_0FE11B50A2D49C58"/>
—perhaps I may never resume the pen.—Let me tell you then, while I have power. This lovely girl is—I can no more—all is dark—and—</P>

<P>The young lady intrusted to my care is the person whom I saw at my brother's; and who, to avoid an union with him, has left his protection for that of a stranger's. She tells me her name is Alton: that she was born in England, but went over to India whilst an infant; that her mother being obliged to go with a lady up into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> left her with a friend, who before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mother's return was forced to retire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> ravages of war: The friend to whose care she was intrusted had no child of her own and at her death left her heiress to a very handsome fortune; the gentleman, who was executor to the will, and guardian to Miss Alton intrusted her to the care of my bro∣ther that she might be brought home to fi∣nish her education. Struck with her person and the more powerful charms of twenty thousand pounds, he has left no means un∣tried,
<PB N="128" REF="029439_0611_0FE11B54150D2518"/>
by which he could hope to win her affection and draw her into a marriage; but she has ever regarded him, as she says, with more horror than any other sensations, when she has considered him as a man designed to be her husband. He was extremely kind and attentive to her, and in return, she res∣pected him and would do any thing to pro∣mote his happiness, except sacrifice her own. She knew so little of the world, that she had actually formed a scheme of working for her bread, and did not even think she could oblige my brother to do her justice or place her at a proper school, and pay the sum her guardian allowed both for her education and pocket. She had not confided her real situ∣ation to Mr. Friendly, to whom I found chance had introduced her.

<SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE my lady dispatched her last letter to you, she has been daily declining and the faintings she mentioned encreased in a most alarming manner. Mr. Friendly did every thing in his power to make her com∣fortable, and the young lady he placed with her was very affectionate and tender; at one time I was in hopes she would recover. But a circumstance happened, that affected her spirits so much as to make the physicians think it necessary to hurry her to this place for the benefit of the waters. Mr. Friendly generally called on her about twice a week, and though to prevail on my dear lady, to accept assistance from him, he frequently talked and consulted her about work; yet
<PB N="130" REF="029439_0613_0FE11B5E668ADA10"/>
he never sent any to do, always making some∣excuse about its not being ready. He was, however, fond of talking to her and some∣times he would bring the newspaper and read to her, and whenever he gave her mo∣ney said it was for the board of Miss Alton. It was one afternoon about six weeks ago, as he sat at tea with the two ladies, a cha∣riot stopped at the door, a very fine lady came out of it, and without any ceremony threw open the dining room door, where they were all sitting: and flying at my dear lady abused her in the grossest manner, accused her of being kept by her husband; for I presently found, madam, that this dreadful∣ly passionate lady was Mrs. Friendly, who had traced her husband to the place where he so often visited, and finding only two women there, she immediately thought one of them must be her husband's mistress, and though my poor dear lady was so ill as might, one would have thought, prevented any such suspicion from being believed, yet did she insist upon it. Mr. Friendly, she said could maintain her there for no other pur∣pose. She called her every vile name, broke the china and was only withheld by her hus∣band from striking the innocent object of her jealousy, who sat as it were stupified with terror, her hands were clasped and rested on her knees and her eyes were fixed on the
<PB N="131" REF="029439_0614_0FE11B63AA6D2908"/>
floor; but she spoke not one word. Mr. Friendly endeavoured to prevail on his wife to go home; but she was deaf to his entrea∣ties, till he promised to accompany her. Just as she was going out, she turned round and wished my lady might starve and die in pri∣son, if ever she encouraged her husband to come there again. "I should like to see it," said she, "and if I saw you dying, I would not give you a farthing to save you. You have had enough from my poor, credulous, foolish husband already and I hope the next bit of bread you eat that is bought with his money will choak you."</P>
<P>I do suppose, madam, she would have gone on much longer, if her husband had not al∣most forced her into the carriage, which drove instantly away. When they were gone, my dear lady raised her eyes and clasped hands to Heaven, "for what new trials am I reserved!" said she, "Poor Miss Alton was crying ready to break her heart, and I should have been very glad to see my poor mistress do the same: but she did not shed a single tear. She looked the very pic∣ture of uncomplaining sorrow. I was fright∣ened to see her look so composed, and as I feared, her faintings which had kept off for a few days before, now returned with dou∣ble violence.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="029439_0615_0FE11B67241899C0"/>
The next day, a gentleman came from Mr. Friendly, saying, that for family rea∣sons, he could not visit her; but desired she might want for nothing. This gentleman waited, till the Doctor visited my lady, and when he heard his opinion, that Bristol might be of service to her, he desired me to make instant preparations for the journey. I chearfully complied, as I found not only the people, who kept the house, where we lodged, but even the neighbours, had learned something of the visit of Mrs. Friendly, and both my lady and Miss Alton were consider∣ed as bad women.</P>
<P>We travelled here by easy stages, my lady was greatly fatigued, and for many days I did not expect her to live. The place re∣vived in her mind the loss of her God∣mother, who died here about sixteen years ago, when my lady first left the con∣vent. The physicians here, comfort me, by saying, they do not think she is in a con∣firmed consumption; but that her disorder is chiefly on her spirits, and could that de∣pression under which she evidently labours be removed, she might yet recover, and would undoubtedly, in a rapid manner. Though I fear, madam, she will never lose that depression; yet I cannot but flatter my∣self something may yet turn out to comfort
<PB N="133" REF="029439_0616_0FE11B6CE546E860"/>
her. Surely it were a great pity so good a lady should be cut off in the very flower of her age, and that she, who never wilful∣ly gave pain to any person, should be dy∣ing of a broken heart. Indeed, madam it almost breaks my old heart to think of it.</P>
<P>She is some days so well, as to be able to walk to the pump room; but she has her∣self no idea, that she shall ever leave this place. She is perfectly resigned. She de∣sired me to write to you and to tell you, she thinks she shall never be able to write her∣self again. She offers you every kind wish and bids you pray for her everlasting peace. Those are her own words. One thing I was desired not to mention; but I cannot con∣clude without doing it. I have written twice to Mr. Friendly, since we have been here: but received no answer. Our money is al∣most gone, and should he forsake us, what will become of my dear lady and poor Miss Alton, God knows; as for myself, I am old, and could not hope to live much lon∣ger; but for them, they have but just en∣tered the world as it were. Pardon me, madam, for writing so much; but I am ve∣ry uneasy and have no one to complain to or advise with. My lady said to me yester∣day, "Deborah, I think I am better: we will dismiss the physician to-morrow." Poor

lady, I knew her motive: she thinks her money will not last long, and that she can∣not afford to pay him▪ I wish to Heaven, Mrs. Onslow was in England or Mr. King∣ly. Oh! madam that my dear blessed lady had been the wife of such a man as Mr. Kingly, how happy would she have been; and she might have lived years and years, blessing and blessed by all. But now she is broken hearted, forsaken by the world and with all her virtues will die unpitied and un∣lamented by all, except a few, who know how good she is; and among which, none will grieve with more sincerity than her and your humble friend and servant,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXVI. MERIEL to CELIA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>December</HI> 22<HI>d,</HI> 1789.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>STRANGE and inscrutable are the ways of Heaven. Once more, my dear Ce∣lia, I am permitted to address you, and I have a tale of wonder to unfold, which even at this moment, though I am sensible that I live, I breathe, that all around me is re∣ality, yet, my astonished senses can hardly credit!—Celia, the heaviest afflictions may lead to the most desirable events. We ought not to complain: every trial, howe∣ver painful to be borne is inflicted for some wise purpose. Gracious Heaven! when I think, how I have nourished one secret sor∣row; how even in my happiest moments have I brooded over it? but it is now re∣moved. That horror, that inexpressible horror, which for so many years has laid upon my mind, is no more. I have been afflicted 'tis true: but I trust I am now safe at least from poverty. My health daily returns,
<PB N="136" REF="029439_0619_0FE11B7B8FDDEB90"/>
and I can enjoy the heart-felt pleasure of relieving the distressed. But how, you will say, how have these changes taken place? My dear friend, when the tumult of my heart will permit me, I will tell you that I am no longer the friendless, distressed crea∣ture, I was not long since. I have a mo∣ther living! I have a father too! Blessed! blessed words! and those whom I ever con∣sidered as my parents were only relations. Mrs. Howard was sister to my mother.—But let me tell my tale with some coherence: for I think my Celia will imagine me wan∣dering from reason, and that I am writing her the effusions of a distempered fancy.</P>
<P>While I was at Bristol, as long as I was able, I went every morning to the pump room. Miss Alton always accompanied me. I there had several times an opportunity of seeing and conversing with Mrs. Harcourt, who was detained there by the ill state of her husband's health, who I found was at Bath at the time I first saw her, which was the occcasion of her attending the exami∣nation of the persons suspected of robbing her house. She frequently made me offers of friendship, at the same time entreating my confidence: but my spirits were not at that time, in a state to permit me to relate the incidents of my life, most of which had
<PB N="137" REF="029439_0620_0FE11B80AB0755C8"/>
been so extremely painful, that I endeavour∣ed as much as was in my power to banish them from my memory.</P>
<P>Mr. Friendly, from family reasons, I ima∣gine was deterred from inquiring for me, after I left London, and the allowance he had made me on account of Miss Alton's being with me, till he could hear from her friends abroad, entirely ceased when we had been about a month in Bristol, so that I be∣came again in very necessitous circumstan∣ces, which added to my having declined the attendance of the physician, and omitted going to drink the waters, on account of my slender finances, encreased my disorder and I soon was confined to my bed. Miss Alton is a tender and affectionate girl and would have confined herself to my bedside, had I not insisted, that she should sometimes walk out. In one of these walks she met Mrs. Harcourt, who inquired after me.—The friendly girl expecting every hour to lose me, burst into tears at the question, de∣scribed my situation to Mrs. Harcourt and entreated her to come and see me. Her own humanity impelled her to comply, and that very afternoon she came to my apartment. She seated herself by my bedside, took my hand, and was beginning to speak; when Deborah entered the room with some toast
<PB N="138" REF="029439_0621_0FE11B8554624EB8"/>
and water which she had been down stairs to procure. Mrs. Harcourt started. The glass fell from Deborah's hand; for their eyes met in the same moment. "Good gracious!" said Deborah, "am I awake—are you!—no,—it can't be!—I thought—but 'tis impossible!"</P>
<P>Mrs. Harcourt had a little recovered her∣self. "Yes, Deborah, said she, "it is possi∣ble. I am alive still, though so many years thought dead.—But tell me—I almost fear to ask—yet tell me, where is my child?</P>
<P>Deborah came near. She took my hand and put it into Mrs. Harcourt's, pressed them together, but remained silent.</P>
<P>"Oh! gracious heaven!" she exclaimed, "and is it indeed so?" Then falling on the bed, and throwing her arms round me, she cried, "my child! My darling child! have I found you then, only to lose you?"—Full of astonishment and wonder, I could scarce∣ly ask the meaning of what I heard and saw. "How madam," said I, "can I be your child? Alas! my dear mother has been ma∣ny years in the silent grave."—"You have heard her mention a sister she once had?"</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="029439_0622_0FE11B8A86ADA3F8"/>
"Yes, but I always understood she was dead before I was born."—"Dead to the world I was," she replied, "for many years, and from a few weeks after your birth, my sister never heard from me. Many vi∣cissitudes have I experienced, far from Eng∣land, unable to hear from you, and above ten years in captivity. When I again saw my native land and made inquiry for my child and sister, I was told they were both dead: Nor did I ever think to have been so blest as this; but I must inquire my beloved Meriel, when you are able to answer me. I must know how you have been so long hid from me, and why it was reported you were dead. Are my brother and sister Howard both dead?"—</P>
<P>She might have proceeded in her ques∣tions uninterrupted; for astonishment had deprived me of the power of speech. Yet perfectly conceiving in a moment the ex∣treme felicity of having a mother! a mother who loved me, my heart also felt lightened of a load of anguish. He, who had at∣tempted my seduction was not my father, he was no relation, only by marriage. Ce∣lia, my beloved Celia, cannot you perfectly comprehend the rapture that thought con∣veyed to my soul. Oh! my friend—I am certain, it is utterly impossible: for you are
<PB N="140" REF="029439_0623_0FE11B8E32E17F58"/>
unacquainted with guilt. The very idea of it inspires you with horror; then, what must have been my feelings on the reflection, that I had kindled a guilty passion, from which nature shrinks back aghast!—But human nature, with all its frailties, could never sink into such depravity.—Unable to ar∣ticulate a single word, I threw my arms round her neck and overpowered by the pleasing sensations that rushed over my heart, I sunk into insensibility. How long I remained so, I cannot even conjecture; but when I recovered, I seemed as though awaking from a deep sleep, and was full of the idea of a delightful dream.—How charmingly was that dream realized, when putting back the curtain I saw my mother! my kind affectionate mother, sitting by my bedside.—"How are you, my child," said she, in an accent of the softest maternal kindness.</P>
<P>I was extremely faint, and could scarcely answer, but yet I felt better and I told her so. From that hour I began to amend, and was in the course of a few days able to be removed to my mother's house, where I was introduced to my father. Oh! blessed thought, that I should live to say I have a father!—a noble! honourable! father!—whose every action of his life, is an eulogium
<PB N="141" REF="029439_0624_0FE11B940E81B6F0"/>
on the goodness of his heart; reflects a credit on the nation of which he is a native, and the religion of which he is not only a professor, but a strict follower of its pre∣cepts.</P>
<P>When I was taken from the lodgings which I then occupied, to my dear mother's house, a new source of astonishment pre∣sented itself. My mother had a person with her, whom I had often heard her mention as an esteemed friend and companion. The day after I was settled in her family, I was introduced to this lady and discovered in her, tho' greatly altered the person of Mrs. Talbot, whom you may remember Mr. Howard kept in a very unbecoming manner, even in the house with his wife, my dear, though so ri∣gid aunt.</P>
<P>She went abroad with a lady, who was following a husband, whom she loved, and who, from necessity, being an officer in the army, had been separated from her. When Mrs. Talbot left Woodbine-cott, she did not know her own situation; but about six months after, she became the mother of a girl. This girl she left in the care of a Mrs. Alton, while she herself accompanied her la∣dy up the country in search of her husband. A variety of incidents, unnecessary here to
<PB N="142" REF="029439_0625_0FE11B9707F14788"/>
relate, detained them several years from the place where she left her child. On her re∣turn, neither friend nor child were to be found. Celia, do you not already know that this child is the very Miss Alton, whom my brother, as I have been accustomed to call him, would have married. My soul shudders, when I think of the escape he has had. This Miss Alton, is his sister, the na∣tural daughter of his father. Good Hea∣vens! to what sins are mortals led, as it were blindfold; by the vices of their pa∣rents. The meeting between the mother and the daughter was very affecting. Mrs. Talbot has retained those good resolutions, with which she has been pleased to say I first inspired her. She lost the friend whom she accompanied to India, when she had been there about six years, and was soon after re∣commended to the notice of that excellent woman, whom I have now the honour to call mother! with whom she has continu∣ed ever since, as a companion, a friend, and the superintendent of her family.</P>
<P>When I am more composed, and my strength will better permit me, I will give you a few particulars of the life of this dear, this new found parent; but at present, I am not permitted to devote above an hour out of the four and twenty to writing, and this letter
<PB N="143" REF="029439_0626_0FE11B9CC4F5CA68"/>

<P>IN my last, I promised a few of the par∣ticulars of my mother's life, and I will now give them without further preface.</P>
<P>She was several years younger than Mrs. Howard; and when her sister was married, was still at school. At the early age of sixteen, she became acquainted with Mr. Harcourt, the
<PB N="144" REF="029439_0627_0FE11BA0010A9230"/>
only son of a wealthy East-India merchant, with whom she entered into the most sacred bonds before any part of either family even suspected there was an intimacy subsisting between them. Her father died soon after this union had taken place, died uninform∣ed of it—and her mother followed him be∣fore she had an opportunity to disclose the secret of her situation: for Mr. Harcourt dreaded the anger of his family, should they discover that he had married a woman with so small a fortune as two thousand pounds. My aunt Howard, whom I so long consider∣ed as my parent, was then settled, and was the only friend my mother had, to whom she dared impart her marriage, and to this disclosure she was driven by necessity; for she found herself likely to become a mother. Mr. Howard was at that time on a visit to a friend some hundred miles from Woodbine cott, and my aunt offered her sister an asylum, there, till she should be released from her bur∣then. It was there I was born, and on the very day of my birth intrusted to the care of the faithful Deborah, who had been brought up by my grandmother and married from her house. She solemnly vowed never to divulge the secret of my birth; and when three weeks after, my aunt Howard was de∣livered of a child, who expired in a few days, it was determined that she should adopt
<PB N="145" REF="029439_0628_0FE11BA5C3EB99E0"/>
me and ever take care of me as her own, till it should be in the power of my parents to claim and acknowledge me.—Deborah alone, was privy to the imposture, and wor∣thy has she proved herself of the confidence placed in her. My father's friends having cause to suspect he had formed some attach∣ment, which did not altogether coincide with the plans they had formed for his fu∣ture establishment in life, had sent him off on a commercial plan to Bengal, whilst my mother was lying in. Distracted by this in∣telligence, as soon as her strength permit∣ted, she resolved to follow him; and leav∣ing me in the care of Mrs. Howard, she embarked for India; but on her arrival at Bengal learnt that her husband had execu∣ted his commissions at that place, and was gone with some English factors up the coun∣try: impelled by a pure and ardent affec∣tion, she followed the route he had taken, but in vain. War began to advance with horrid strides, followed by devastation and famine, and whilst searching for her hus∣band, my mother fell into the hands of the enemy. Lovely in her person, ornamented with all the charms of youth, she was con∣sidered as a valuable prize among the cap∣tives, and was sold to a merchant, who pur∣chased slaves for the Grand Segnior. By long and tiresome journies she reached Con∣stantinople
<PB N="146" REF="029439_0629_0FE11BA9C1FC9B20"/>
and was presented to the royal Turk, but fortunately her person did not please him, and she was only purchased, merely to fill up the number of his wives; without once receiving a visit from him, or being solicited to entertain him in an impro∣per manner. Ten years was she detained in this place, where she says her time would have past pleasantly enough, had it not been for the remembrance of my father and my∣self; but the thought of what might have become of us, prevented her being happy or receiving the least satisfaction from the va∣rious scenes of luxury and amusement that daily surrounded her. In the summer sea∣son, the Grand Segnior sent his wives and all the female part of his family in large parties to the different houses he had in the country: and in one of these excursions my mother was struck with the appearance of a slave, who used to walk on a terrace before the windows of the apartments appointed for the women, apparently in a very ill state of health. In the party of woman of which my mother made one was a beautiful tur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> who was sister to the Grand Signior, her name was Zayde. She had ever shewn a vi∣sible partiality to my mother, and cultiva∣ted her friendship with the utmost care. She endeavoured to attain from her instructions some knowledge of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he English language,
<PB N="147" REF="029439_0630_0FE11BAF5045AA28"/>
and listened with attention, when she strove to instruct her in the precepts of the Chris∣tian religion.</P>
<P>This young princess perceiving one day, that my mother regarded the sick slave with fixed attention, took an opportunity to tell her, the slave was hers, that he was a fa∣vourite, and had made an impression on her heart.</P>
<P>"I love him," said she, "but I have never told him so. I only endeavour to make his servitude less painful by shewing him every kindness in my power; but when∣ever I tell him I am sorry to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him so un∣happy, and wish I could remove the cause of his affliction, he answers, that his sor∣rows can never be less, till he is restored to liberty and the love of a beautiful Christian, who alone can render either life or liberty desirable." "Thus much," continued she, I can understand; but as I cannot ful∣ly comprehend his meaning, I wish you would see and talk to him some evening, when, if you can learn from him, what will be most conducive to his happiness, I will exert my utmost power to procure it for him."—My mother complied with the re∣quest of Zayde, and one evening in the mid∣dle of July she accompanied her into the gar∣den
<PB N="148" REF="029439_0631_0FE11BB3F32E8DE8"/>
to give the Christian slave the promised meeting.</P>
<P>The moon was at the full—but the atmos∣phere was cloudy, and though it was possi∣ble to distinguish objects, yet the light was not sufficient to permit a discrimination of features.</P>
<P>She addressed the slave in English, told him how much Zayde was interested in his behalf, and begged to learn from him, what could be done to comfort his mind, and assist in the restoration of his health.</P>
<P>"I might say," replied the slave, "that liberty would restore me to all I so feeling∣ly regret—but, alas! lady, I have lost what it is not (I greatly fear) in the power of fate to restore.—Married in early youth to a lovely woman, who, to the charms of an engaging person, added all the fascina∣ting beauties of a pure and elevated mind, and separated from her in the very moment when the delicacy of her situation most re∣quired a husband's tenderness and fond solici∣tude, think what I must suffer from an absence of eleven years, without having once heard whether either herself or child are living. Sent from England by the cruel, pretend∣ed tenderness of parents, who valued wealth
<PB N="149" REF="029439_0632_0FE11BB93364FF68"/>
above every other earthly consideration—thrown by the chance of war into a slavery, from whence I can never hope to escape; I am, I feel am, lost to the world and dead to every thing but a remembrance of what I have been and what I now am."</P>
<P>"Alas! it is very sad," replied my mo∣ther, bending forward to wipe off the tears she felt trickling from her eyes.</P>
<P>Just then the moon broke from the cloud that had obscured her brightness and shed her beams full on the face of the person with whom she was conversing. A scream of mingled surprise and joy escaped her.—It was her husband, who under the same master, for the same term of years had en∣dured slavery, and yet no lucky chance had ever brought them together. Nay, even when she had observed him on the terrace, his visage was ever bent toward the earth, and his hat pulled over his eyes, and she had no opportunity to discover features, which however altered by sickness and sor∣row were still fresh in her memory, still dear to her heart.</P>
<P>They candidly revealed their situation to the generous Zayde, who was indefatigable till she had contrived the means for their es∣cape.—
<PB N="150" REF="029439_0633_0FE11BBBCB6C7040"/>
"And will not you accompany us," said my mother, when she informed her of the plan she had laid, and gave into their hands the means of putting it in execu∣tion.</P>
<P>"No," she replied, "you my dear friend have taught me the foundation of the Chris∣tian religion; it teaches us to compassionate and relieve the distresses of our fellow crea∣tures; but it also teaches us never to forsake our parents. I have a mother living, who is old. She says, I am her only comfort.—It will be wrong to leave her, to deprive her of what constitutes her whole felicity. Go then, my friends, embrace this oppor∣tunity of emancipating yourselves from slavery: leave me to the performance of my duty: and pray for me, that though I do not, perhaps, pursue the right Christian mode of worship, yet, that the offerings of a sincere and grateful heart may be accepted at the throne of mercy."—</P>
<P>With eyes and hearts overflowing with gratitude and affection did my parents take leave of this fair benevolent Mahometan; but though they regained their liberty, vari∣ous incidents prevented their return to Eng∣land, till within these four years last past. They had frequently written to inquire after
<PB N="151" REF="029439_0634_0FE11BC15A482A28"/>
me; but never received any answer; and when they arrived were informed from many people that all Mr. Howard's family were dead, except the son, who was abroad.—</P>
<P>Mr. Harcourt found that his own family, except some distant branches, were entirely extinct, and that a large fortune waited only his appearance and proper claim. This he is now master of, and to this I am now the acknowledged heiress. Caressed by my pa∣rents, respected once more by the world, who now again behold me surrounded by affluence, my health and spirits daily re∣turning, what have I more to wish for?—Alas! Celia, we are never content, and I most ardently desire my poor Rooksby's re∣formation to complete my felicity.—Kingly too, I could wish to hear that he was well and happy. But I will offer the sacrifice of thanksgiving for the blessings I have received, and for futurity trust entirely to a wise and bountiful Providence, who has never yet forsaken me, and who I humbly hope never will.</P>
<P>I have been once to see Kingly's children; my mother went with me: they are both well. Clara's children are at the same school and enjoy the same advantages. Generous Kingly may heaven reward you for the disinterested
<PB N="152" REF="029439_0635_0FE11BC4591F4A28"/>
kindness you have shewn these poor orphans, for indeed they are literally so, being for∣saken by both father and mother.</P>
<P>My dear Celia, pray for me, that I may support this unexpected, this wonderful ele∣vation of fortune as I ought, that while I share the pleasures of affluence I may never forget the pangs of poverty or turn a deaf ear to the cry of affliction.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXVIII. FREDERIC KINGLY, <ABBR>ESQ.</ABBR> to COL. ONSLOW.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>April</HI> 16<HI>th,</HI> 1790.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM returned to England once more; for my mind was so harassed by the thoughts of what might be the fate of my beloved Meriel, that my health declined, and I was advised to solicit an exchange and return to my native place; where the air might re∣store me. I complied with the advice of my friends, not from any opinion of my own that I was in danger, for the complaints of the mind are so far superior to those of the body, that I was not sensible of my own de∣clining state. Meriel, in affliction, without friends, without support, continually haunt∣ed my imagination.</P>
<P>On my arrival in England, I went imme∣diately to my agent. He had heard no ti∣dings of her. His heart was not interested; he had therefore made only a few inquiries
<PB N="154" REF="029439_0637_0FE11BCD65FFF378"/>
and finding them fruitless, had given up the search.—I determined to remain a few days in London to rest after the fatigues of my voyage and then visit my dear boys.—My time hang heavy on my hands and I saun∣tered into a coffee house towards the close of evening. A brother officer accosted me; we chatted a few moments on indifferent subjects, and he proposed going to the play. I accompanied him just to while away the time, rather than from any hope of amusement. Just before the curtain rose, an elderly gentleman entered the box op∣posite to that in which I was sitting, lead∣ing a lady, whom at the first glance, I knew to be my adored, my lovely Meriel. Health again adorned her countenance and sparkled in her eyes; yet there was im∣pressed on her features a sort of pensive shade, which seemed to say, she might be happier. Her dress though, sweetly sim∣ple, and becoming, yet bespoke the wearer in affluent circumstances, and the assidious attention of the gentleman, who accom∣panied her, was evidently the effusions of tenderness. She received them with com∣placency; nay, returned them with looks beaming expressive affection.</P>
<P>A young man in the box with me observed the emotions in my counteance, whilst I re∣garded
<PB N="155" REF="029439_0638_0FE11BD280CFC380"/>
her.—"Do you know that lady," said he,—"I think I do sir, I have some idea that her name is Rooksby."—</P>
<P>"I don't know her name," said he, "but she is a damn'd pretty creature, and that old fellow deserves to be gibbetted for mo∣nopolizing her."—</P>
<P>A chill of horror ran through my heart, can Meriel Howard, said I, mentally, be sunk from that eminence of virtue, which ever distinguished her, into so low, so piti∣able a character, as to exist on the wages of prostitution? "Does she live with that gentleman?" said I, to my intelligencer.</P>
<P>"'Tis thought so," he replied, "she is quite a new face. I have seen her often in public with him, and she seldom is accom∣panied by any one but an old woman, who looks like a convenient."</P>
<P>"And is that all the reason you can give" said I fiercely, "for injuring the character of a woman that ever was, and I trust ever will be free from blemish."</P>
<P>Oh! no," said he, "when I first saw her, it was at the opera; and I was told she was a woman of that stamp; for she left her hus∣band
<PB N="156" REF="029439_0639_0FE11BD7D8B50320"/>
about a year and a half ago and lived with a young officer of the name of Kingly."</P>
<P>I was going to answer with great warmth and inquire the name of the person, who had thus dared to sport with my character; but my friend interposed and obliged me to quit the play-house without any farther in∣formation.</P>
<P>This transient glance of my dear Meriel, added to the villainous assertions of the im∣pertinent coxcomb, who vilified her name, had such an effect on my spirits, that rest was a stranger to my eyes. I had not in∣quired the name of the gentleman with whom I saw her: it was therefore impossible to trace her out. For many evenings I frequented the theatres, the opera-house—every place of public amusement; but was still unsuc∣cessful. She was not at any, or if there, was effectually concealed from me.—Un∣happy, ill, disgusted with every object that surrounded me, I determined one morning to visit my children, who I had previously heard, were well, and endeavour to lose my chagrin in their innocent caresses. The school they were at is about twenty-five miles from town. I took a post chaise and arrived at the place about eleven o'clock. An elegant carriage stood at the gate, which drew off to
<PB N="157" REF="029439_0640_0FE11BDCF0A7CB98"/>
give me room to alight. I asked the servant who opened the gate, for my boys. "They are in the parlour," said he; I followed him, in fancy anticipating their dear embraces. He threw open the parlour door. I advan∣ced and saw, seated at the upper end of the room, surrounded by the four boys, (for Clara's children are there) distributing to them, toys and fruit, the interesting figure of Mrs. Rooksby. Astonishment riveted me to the floor. She looked toward me; joy flashed from her eyes. An exclamation of surprise escaped her, and before either of us had time for reflection, I found I had seated myself beside her and clasped her in my arms, while the dear children were climbing round, each striving to be the first to share my ca∣resses. However joy had for a moment made her forget herself, she soon recovered her usu∣al air of cautious timidity and disingaging her∣self from my embrace, she presented me to an elderly lady, whom till then I had not ob∣served; and whom she addressed by the en∣dearing title of mother. They proposed taking the children home with them and dismissing my chaise to take a seat in their coach and all return to town together.—During our ride, she unfolded to me a tale of wonder, unnecessary here to repeat; be∣cause she informed me she has written your Amelia a full account of it.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="029439_0641_0FE11BE18488B4A0"/>
I am a frequent visitor at Mr. Harcourt's, and enjoy her society undisturbed by the fears of the world's censure; for under the shelter of paternal protection, who shall dare to arraign her conduct? She informs me she has not heard from her husband, since his release from the King's bench: but imagines he is wandering abroad with the wild Clara. You will hardly believe it possible, that young Howard, who refused to assist or even acknowledge the dear Meriel, when she was in distress and he thought her his sister, has been to pay his respects to her since he has discovered she is a wealthy rela∣tive. She received him politely; but did not ask him to repeat his visit. He is af∣fluent," said she, "he does not want assist∣ance, and I do not wish to be pestered with his company."</P>
<P>Far different was her conduct to Hester Mossop, who is now a widow with three children and in very indigent circumstan∣ces. She met Mrs. Mossop by accident at a perfumer's shop, and judging from her ap∣pearance that she was no longer the wealthy, haughty woman, who had never known dis∣tress, accosted her in a manner, that encou∣raged her to make her a visit; nay, she en∣treated her to do so. From her she learned Hester's necessities, and hesitated not a mo∣ment
<PB N="159" REF="029439_0642_0FE11BE62A6DADD8"/>
to exert her benevolence to remove them. She inquired after Susan. Tears were the only answer she received.—Alas! poor Susan! seduced by Belger, led into all manner of folly by Clara, she fell from one degree of vice to another, till oppressed by the complicated evils of infamy, disease and a broken heart, she sunk into an untimely grave, in her last hours in want of the com∣mon necessaries of life. Meriel gave a tear to her memory and to sooth the affliction of the mother immediately formed a plan for Hester's support. She advanced money for her to take a shop furnished well with haber∣dashery and hosiery; and by the many re∣commendations of Mrs. Harcourt, she is like∣ly to gain a very decent subsistence. Young Mossop is married to a rich heiress; but they live in some town very distant from London, and he found it quite inconvenient to write and inquire after his mother and sisters.</P>
<P>I hope, now, we shall soon see you in England: I feel uncommonly happy, and I wish you to see and share my happiness.—Methinks, the wheel of fortune has gone its round: and we who have been thrown the very bottom, are now beginning to rise. I see my dear Meriel enjoying all the com∣forts, all the elegances of life—caressed, be∣loved,
<PB N="160" REF="029439_0643_0FE11BEB3A6EE490"/>
esteemed by all, and I cannot help indulging the flattering hope, (call it not chimerical) that I shall one day call her mine! Oh! Onslow—when that blest hour arrives! (if such an hour Heaven has in store for me) when I shall see the affection of her faithful heart beam from her expres∣sive eyes, unchecked by fear, I shall think myself at the very summit of human felicity!</P>
<P>My kindest remembrances and best wishes attend your Amelia.</P>

<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>P. S. Previous to Mrs. Rooksby's assist∣ing Hester, the poor creature made the hu∣miliating confession, that it was her artifices, to which she was instigated by her mother, that first separated me from my beloved Me∣riel; but that noble minded woman frank∣ly forgave her; never witheld her friend∣ship from her, and has never once since mentioned the circumstance.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXIX. MRS. ONSLOW to MISS SHELBURNE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>November</HI> 10<HI>th,</HI> 1790.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOU will perhaps be surprized, my dear madam, to receive a letter from a person to whom you are a stranger; but though I never was honoured with the ac∣quaintance of Miss Shelburne, yet she has no doubt heard of Amelia Sidney, who has been so highly honoured by the friendship of our equally beloved Mrs Rooksby.—</P>
<P>That lady from a variety of incidents has been prevented from writing to you for several months past; and I am now desired by her to inform you that she is in health; but totally inadequate to the task of relating to you the scenes in which she has been lately engaged.—I know her motive for thus declining a task which she ever considered pleasureable, that of writing to her esteemed Celia is delicacy: she cannot inform you of
<PB N="162" REF="029439_0645_0FE11BF06DC92D18"/>
what has lately occurred, without making mention of her own magnanimity. Her fortitude has ever been conspicuous, it has sustained her under some of the heaviest trials to which the human heart is incident; but in this last she has risen almost above humanity. Pardon the expression; for I am fully sensible how much the human heart is capable of, it is tempered by a great, an all wise Being, who will never inflict trials be∣yond our power to support;—but we daily see such instances of depravity that we look with a kind of wonder on those who through life maintain that dignified conduct, that purity of manner and universal benevolence which is the true characteristic of Christi∣anity.—But I intrude on your patience, and defer the interesting narrative. To pro∣ceed then.</P>
<P>On my arrival in England after an absence of six years I was both surprized and pleased to see the alteration which had taken place in the circumstanes of our friend. She had regained all that softness, that delicacy of countenance, for which she has been univer∣sally admired; but which sickness and sor∣row had when I left her faded into langour. She was chearful and apparently happy; but still some hours of painful reflection would intrude; for she was totally ignorant
<PB N="163" REF="029439_0646_0FE11BF9E1B45B60"/>
of the fate of her husband. He might return to England, he might demand her from her father and mother, when he found her the affluent heiress of a large fortune.—These ideas continually haunted her, and sometimes interrupted her most chearful hours. Mrs. Harcourt had invited me to spend a few weeks with them at a feat of their's situated on the banks of the Thames, near Windsor. I accepted the invitation, and had been there near three weeks, when Mrs. Rooksby entered my appartment one morning, pale and ready to faint. She could not speak, but put a note into my hands, which she had just received. It was from Clara—and in a few incoherent lines, represented Rooksby in a most wretched si∣tuation, dying and in the utmost distress.—I had known so many instances of Clara's art, that I endeavoured to persuade Mrs. Rooksby from the resolution, she had form∣ed of going immediately to town and ad∣ministering relief to her husband: but all I could say, joined to the united entreaties of her parents, could not prevail, and all I could do was to accompany her. She or∣dered the coachman to set her down accord∣ing to the direction contained in Clara's bil∣let. It was at a mean house in an obscure street in Westminster.. We enquired for her husband by the name of Moreton, and was
<PB N="164" REF="029439_0647_0FE11BFE20659058"/>
shewn up two pair of stairs into a small back room, where on a bed without hangings, lay all that remained of the once elegant af∣fluent Rooksby, worn to a skeleton, and in the very last stage of a decline, (for he had never recovered the effects of the wound) and riot and intemperance had hastened the period of his existence.—Beside the bed, (supporting his head on her arm, the tears flowing from her eyes) sat Clara: but I could never have conceived it to be the love∣ly Clara, who had stolen the heart of Rooks∣by from our dear friend, for her appear∣ance was squallid and miserable. Sunk eyes, pale cheeks, every indication of dis∣ease and poverty was marked upon her per∣son.—</P>
<P>She turned her eyes towards us as we en∣tered, but without changing her attitude. She has very fine eyes and in spite of their languor still retained sufficient expression, to inform us, that she was equally oppressed by the situation of the poor sufferer on the bed, and shame at appearing in the pre∣sence of the woman she had injured beyond reparation. Our excellent Meriel advan∣ced, (checking the powerful feelings of her heart) and as with one hand, she took one of her dying husband's, she extended the other towards Clara: and in accents scarce∣ly
<PB N="165" REF="029439_0648_0FE11C0383929CA0"/>
audible, bade her be comforted. Struck by such an uncommon proof of benevo∣lence, the poor suffering criminal sunk on her knees. She clasped the hand extended towards her, raised her streaming eyes;—but could not give vent to the fullness of her heart by words.</P>
<P>"Go," cried our magnanimous Meriel, "go, my poor penitent Clara, and compose yourself: I will stay and attend my hus∣band:" then turning to me, she continued, "Shall I entreat you Amelia to return and inform my parents that you have left me in the performance of my duty: that you have left me attending the sick bed of a husband, who raised me from obscurity to an elevated fortune: tell them, I remember not his er∣rors—they were the children of human nature:—but his benevolence will never be obliterated from my mind.—That was the offspring of Heaven.—As she spoke, she waved her hand; I found it was impossible to disobey her, and retired from the apartment—but not from the house. I dispatched a short note to Mrs. Harcourt and then exerted myself to obtain for Rooksby, and my dear rigidly duteous friend, every assistance which money could procure.—It is a sad thing to acknowledge, but so it was, those very people who had suffered Rooksby
<PB N="166" REF="029439_0649_0FE11C06158A4C28"/>
and Clara to want even the means to support existence, whilst they thought them destitute of friends and money, no sooner saw them visited by persons, who were supposed weal∣thy, and beheld the contents of my purse, which fortunately was amply supplied, than they were ready to run! to fly! to per∣form any dirty, or painful work for which they expected to be well paid. But I mean not to make human nature despicable by this observation. These people were poor.—And God knows we may all yield to temptations, when poverty is the strong incentive.</P>
<P>I heard from my friend every hour, though she herself imagined I was returned to her father and mother. About midnight I heard an extraordinary bustle up stairs, and on inquiring the cause, found that Rooksby who had never been able to speak to his angelic wife more than monofylables, since her arrival, had been seized with a kind of fit, and was expected every moment to ex∣pire. I thought it improper for Mrs. Rooks∣by to be left in such a situation to the entire care of strangers, and therefore sent up word that I was returned from the country with a message from her mother, and if she pleased would come up. She said, she would be happy to see me. When I went into the room I found her seated on the bed, support∣ing
<PB N="167" REF="029439_0650_0FE11C0C13561E78"/>
her dying husband, who was at that time easy and seemingly dozing. His right arm was encircling her waist, his head rested on her bosom, she pointed to a chair by the bedside, but did not speak. On the opposite side of the bed, stood a woman with volatiles which they had been applying to the nose and temples of the expiring man; and at the foot was Clara on her knees her eyes elevated, her hands, clasped, and her whole countenance bearing testimony to the anguish that rent her soul. In my life, I never saw a more interesting scene, nor never I hope shall I witness such another.—I sat down in silence, and in a few moments the Physi∣cian, whom Mrs. Rooksby had sent for arrived. He pronounced the patient past all hope, and a few hours confirmed the sentence. It was near seven o'clock, when starting as it were from sleep, he gazed ar∣dently on his wife.</P>
<P>"Oh Meriel," said he, "I dreamt I was in the realms of bliss and you conducted me there. Blessed woman, if you forgive me, if you pray for my enterance into that place of eternal peace; I shall, I know I shall, be received.—"Oh!" said she, with fervour, "May Heaven so forgive my offences as I pardon every offence of yours toward me.—"But Clara," cried he,
<PB N="168" REF="029439_0651_0FE11C102BB09200"/>
"poor guilty Clara!"—"I will be her friend," replied Mrs. Rooksby. "Enough," said he, "may every blessing crown you here, and everlasting joys"—He could not finish the sentence, but remained silent and almost inanimate for the space of half an hour. He then moved and took a cordial which she offered him. I prevailed on her to quit her painful situation at the head of the bed and let him lye down. She did so, but he still retained her hand.—Just before the final scene closed, he raised him∣self a little, and looking earnestly in her face—"My children," he cried, "my dear boys."—"Are they not mine," she replied in an accent to which no words can do justice.</P>
<P>"Oh! what a wretch I have been!!!"—said he.—His head sunk on her shoulder, he endeavoured to throw his arms around her, but Death had arrested their power.—He groaned—struggled for the power of utterance—and in that struggle expired.</P>
<P>I knew the extreme sensibility of the heart with which I had to deal. I attempt∣ed not to console her, I rather encouraged her to give a loose to her feelings, and in a few hours she became sufficiently compo∣sed to submit to my direction, and suffer her∣self to be conveyed to her father and mother:
<PB N="169" REF="029439_0652_0FE11C15C8CECE78"/>
but not 'till she had given proper directions for the future support of Clara. This un∣happy woman confessed in the anguish of her heart, that at the very moment when our incomparable friend gave her assistance and countenance in Devonshire, she was ploting her ruin, that the chief part of the letter she wrote to her, and of which you have had a copy was the invention of her own brain, and that from a very child she has been the offspring of folly.—</P>
<P>Mrs. Rooksby heard her confession with∣out any emotion, save that of compassion, and when she had finished, bade her not despair but resolve on a new course of life, and trust in that bounteous Creator for par∣don, who never turned from the truly peni∣tent.—She has sent this unfortunate and I may say guilty woman into Wales, were she has become responsible for her board, and allows her ten pounds a year for her pocket and extra expences. The children she has taken entirely under her own care.</P>
<P>My dear Miss Shelburne, I cannot help now indulging the most sanguine hopes, that I shall see this worthy woman rewarded for all her sufferings; shall see her soon united to the man to whom for many years she has been sincerely attached, and from whom only the most cruel treachery could
<PB N="170" REF="029439_0653_0FE11C1AA1080E00"/>
have separated her;—for Hester Mossop has confessed that she was the author of those letters which prevented her union with Rainsforth. We do not let Mr. Harcourt know that Hester has made this confession, for he would never forgive her, and I much fear would insist on Mrs. Rooksby's with∣drawing her friendship entirely from her.</P>
<P>Mrs. Rooksby bid me say she will write as soon as she is able, and in the mean time desires you will believe she can never be otherwise than your friend, and in the same rank begs leave to be placed,</P>

<P>I HAVE foreborn to write; because I knew my dear Amelia had informed you of every material occurrence. I knew
<PB N="171" REF="029439_0654_0FE11C1FC06A1058"/>
she had told you that I had promised after my year of mourning was expired, to give my hand to the man, who first possessed my heart. That year was ended on this very day, and I am now the wife of Kingly. I could almost find it in my heart to renounce the name and say, I am the wife of Rains∣forth.—</P>
<P>My dear Celia, pray for me, that the tide of joy, which now rushes on my heart, may not impair my gratitude, or lead me through my adoration of the creature to forget the Creator, to whom only adoration is due.</P>
<P>Oh, Heavenly Providence! am I indeed thus happy—yes, it is a blest reality. I can look up to a father to whom it is an honour to be allied. I can see the sweet effusions of maternal tenderness beam on me from a be∣loved mother's eyes. I am united to the man of my heart, I am the adopted mother of his children.—Where! where! is there a human being as superlatively happy as my∣self? happier they cannot be. I can lay my hand on my heart and fervently pray even for the felicity of my enemies. Enemies did I say, I will forget I ever had any, past scenes of sorrow shall be obliterated from my me∣mory, and remembering only the present happiness I will endeavour to deserve its

<P>Mrs. Onslow desires remembrances to you. My husband bids me say, should the com∣motions which at present agitate the Gallic shore, disturb you in your religious retreat; remember, you have a home, to which you can with confidence repair—a home, where you will be received with transport, and where you may consider yourself in the man∣sion of a sister! Heaven bless and protect you, is the ardent prayer of your friend in sincerity.</P>
