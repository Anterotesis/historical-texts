<P>IT was moved and seconded, and <HI>Voted unanimously,</HI> That a Committee should be appointed to wait upon the ORATOR, and return him thanks for his <HI>elegant</HI> and <HI>spirited</HI> ORATION, and to request a copy for the press.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>Ye Friends to justice, equity, and truth,</L>
<L>Ye Foes to falshood, treason, and rebellion,</L>
<L>—With patience hear me.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE flourishes of rhetoric I cannot use,—these will I <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the SONS of LIBERTY of this degenerate age.</P>
<P>I cannot boast the ignorance of HANCOCK, the insolence of ADAMS, the absurdity of ROWE, the arrogance of LEE, the vicious life and untimely death of MOLLINEAUX, the turgid bom∣bast of Warren, the treasons of QUINCY, the hypocrisy of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, nor the principles of YOUNG:—Nor can I with propriety <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> over the characters of these <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>,</HI> (or, to use their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> phrase, <HI>Indians,</HI>) without a few observations on their late <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>These sachem, or <HI>Indian chiefs,</HI> tho' of different titles, all pro∣ceeded from one and the same tribe; who being originally in∣habitants of a country a thousand leagues to the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> (or in the vulgar <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>) for assuring that <HI>claim,</HI> which is the natural right of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the good things of this world; which good things

Fortune had most unjustly bestowed upon others in too large a pro∣portion.</P>
<P>It was a matter of dispute for some time whether they were of the <HI>Mohawk</HI> kind or not; and this suspicion, I imagine, first arose from the observation of a learned physionomist, who perceiving their <HI>Os frontis</HI> to be uncommonly flat, burst out into the following exclamation:</P>
<L>"Your sapsculls are neither square, oval, nor round,</L>
<L>"A proof that their judgments can never be sound:</L>
<L>"I really believe they are put <HI>wrong way on,</HI></L>
<L>"As they seem to resemble a cobler's lap-stone."</L>
<P>But notwithstanding the above assertion might border upon truth, yet several of these chiefs denied it, by openly declaring themselves to be neither more nor less than plain <HI>Narragansets</HI>; who scorn'd to scalp any person who would submit to have his private property destroyed, without complaining.</P>
<P>With regard to their <HI>political</HI> schemes, I challenge all <HI>Hell</HI> to match them. Law they have none, nor any do they want; and could they send to Salem or Endor to procure a <HI>witch</HI> to bring MOLLINEAUX from the dead, even HE would condemn them.</P>
<P>The First of these chiefs is A—MS, a <HI>sachem</HI> of vast elocution; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> being extremely poor, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> syllables, sentences, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in the multitude; and it can be attested, that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> mouth of A—MS is sufficient to fill the
<PB REF="013840_0007_0F92035EF7D53680"/>
mouths of millions in America. But it is prophesied that the time is near at hand, when the <HI>frothy food</HI> will fail them.</P>
<P>But generous JOHN scorns to let him starve,—far from it; 'tis well known his purse-strings have been at SAM's disposal ever since he assisted in making the Oration delivered by JOHN on the 5th March 1774, to a crowded audience of Narraganset <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>The Second of these chiefs is H—CK, who having been possess'd of too much money for a private gentleman, resolved to make a public attempt to become a Monarch, and having courted <HI>popularity and power</HI> almost as long as he did Miss ...... Miss ...... or Mr Barnard's cook-maid, Betty Price, is at last likely to be jilt∣ed in his turn, and in the end to be wedded to beggary, contempt, and a g—s.</P>
<P>The Third of these incomparable <HI>Indians</HI> is ROWE; a chief (according to George Alexander Stevens) possess'd of a great fund of kn—owledge; but having a skull of an uncommon thickness, and the futures of the <HI>cranium</HI> being closely compacted, he never has never been able to display any rational faculties, except when he invented the new method of <HI>making Tea.</HI></P>
<P>But, oh! for words to grace the character of the most traiterous of men!—a modern Bravo. Did not the name of <HI>rebel</HI> stain the <HI>soldier,</HI> I could have afforded him a more brilliant title, and have call'd him a General. His name is L—. Oh! beware my friends of his follies! He mounted to almost the height of preferment but mazed with ambition, he fell from the precipice, burst him <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> asunder, and exposing his pride, proved <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></P>
<L><PB N="6" REF="013840_0008_0F92035E384D1DD0"/>
"Pride still is aiming at the blest abodes,</L>
<L>"Men would be angels, angels would be gods;</L>
<L>"Aspiring to be gods, if angels fell,</L>
<L>"Aspiring to be angels, men REBELL.</L>
<P>The Fifth of these chiefs is now no more. His name was M—x. He had a strong aversion to all order, civil or eccle∣siastic; he swore the K— was a tyrant, the Q— a —, the Prince a bastard, the bishops, papists, and the houses of lords and commons, <HI>a den of thieves.</HI> Thro' the strength of his own villain∣ny, and the <HI>laudanum</HI> of Doctor W—N, he quitted this planet, and went to a secondary one in search of LIBERTY.</P>
<P>The Sixth of these worthies is named W—RR—N; a man, who by his great skill in chemistry, could <HI>turn water</HI> into <HI>milk,</HI> and sell it for <HI>six coppers</HI> the quart. He was bound apprentice to an apo∣thecary, and turn'd out a Quack, but thinking this profession too grovelling for so sublime a genius, he has lately changed it for that of <HI>Orator,</HI> and is already so great a proficient in the <HI>sough,</HI> or true <HI>puritanic whine,</HI> and his notes are so remarkably flat and productive of horror, that when he dismisses his hearers, you would swear they were just come out of the cave of Triphonius.—There's an Orator for you!</P>
<P>Oh! that some Son of Liberty would go to <HI>hell,</HI> and fetch a spark from the altar of <HI>enthusiasm,</HI> to kindle in me the reforming and of W—n!—then might I speak his language.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="013840_0009_0F92035D78B3AFA0"/>The Seventh of these pillars of the state is Q—CY, and tho' I have placed him only as the seventh <HI>sachem,</HI> yet it has been as∣serted that he is worthy of a higher rank; having lately composed a Treatise, in which he absolved all his Majesty's subjects from their allegiance; and was one of the first inventors of <HI>mobbing, tar∣ring and feathering,</HI> and sundry other modes tending to the over∣throw of all societies, civil and moral.</P>
<P>The Eighth of these heroes is Y—G, whose character cannot be drawn by any pen with the consistency that becomes a true limner. Could we raise up the spirit of one of the murderers of St Stephen, to tell us what a figure Paul cut, when he breathed out threatning and slaughter against his SAVIOUR, then might we form an idea of Dr Y—G: but since that is impossible, I can only refer you to—<HI>his own countenance,</HI> wherein you may read his true and genuine disposition. Suffice it to say, this man stands ac∣cused of rebellion, not only against his Sovereign, but against HIS GOD;—he makes a mock at the merits of his Redeemer, and uses his God only <HI>to swear by.</HI></P>
<P>Oh! my friends and fellow subjects! what infatuation must pos∣sess the deluded fools who depend on such a <HI>race of rascals for their leaders!</HI></P>
<P>I shall pass over <HI>many others</HI> who are too insignificant to become the subject of my pen;—</P>
<L>And now to end th' infernal group here,</L>
<L>Who is so fit as Doctor C—?</L>
<L>"When gospel trumpeter surrounded</L>
<L><PB REF="013840_0010_0F92035CBA83B898" MS="y"/>"With long-ear'd rout to battle sounded,</L>
<L>"And pulpit, drum ecclesiastic,</L>
<L>"Was beat with fist instead of a stick;</L>
<L>He, prostituting his religion,</L>
<L>Turns a dispenser of sedition;</L>
<L>And to the greedy, gaping million,</L>
<L>For holy writ, deals out rebellion;</L>
<L>His sacred function quite forsaking,</L>
<L>Smells profit in oration making;</L>
<L>And when with pangs and throws he's dropt it,</L>
<L>Gets foolish, simple John t'adopt it:</L>
<L>By me advis'd, ne'er mind the nation,</L>
<L>But work at <HI>home</HI> a reformation;</L>
<L>Leave, against kings and rulers railing,</L>
<L>Give curtain lectures against <HI>stealing.</HI></L>
<L>Instead of making an Oration,</L>
<L>Make sermons against fornication;</L>
<L>And with uplifted voice and hand,</L>
<L>Strongly enforce the seventh command.</L>
<L>Of your black crimes 'gainst George and heav'n</L>
<L>Repent; you may be yet forgiv'n.</L>
<L>Reform the Rebel, Thief, and W—,</L>
