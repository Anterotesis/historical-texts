<P>It is a fearful thing to fall into the Hands of the Living GOD.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HOW awful and awak'ning are these <HI>Words!</HI> Eno' to strike the heart of the hardiest Sinner with the utmost fear! As the hand-writing on the wall over against <HI>Belshazzar</HI> changed his countenance, loos∣ed the joynts of his loins, and his knees smote one against another.</P>
<P>THE <HI>words</HI> come in the close of an excellent <HI>Warning</HI> against wilful &amp; presumptuous disobe∣dience to the Gospel, &amp; apostacy from it. The <HI>Apostle</HI> warns the presumptuous &amp; apostate Sin∣ner of the righteous and terrible <HI>Vengeance</HI> of God: <HI>For we know him that hath said, Vengeance be∣belongeth unto Me, I will recompence saith the Lord: And again, The Lord shall judge his people: It is a fearful thing to fall into the Hands of the Living God.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="002737_0004_0FE5F436AD804508"/>SEE here what <HI>GOD</HI> is: He is the <HI>Living GOD:</HI> That is his <HI>glorious and fearful Name.</HI> And see what the tremendous Punishment of <HI>Sin</HI> is; it is <HI>to fall into the hands of the Living God.</HI></P>
<P>I need not seek for any <HI>Doctrine</HI> out of the words of the <HI>Text</HI>: No words of mine can be like awful, instructive and awakning.</P>
<Q><HI>DOCT.</HI> IT is a fearful thing to fall into the Hands of the Living GOD.</Q>
<P>THE <HI>Text</HI> may be opened and confirmed in the following <HI>Enquiries.</HI> 1. What is meant by this Title, the <HI>living God</HI>? 2. What by the <HI>Hands</HI> of the <HI>living God</HI>? 2. What it is to <HI>fall</HI> into the hands of the living God? 4. In what respects it is so <HI>fearful</HI> a thing to fall into his hands?</P>
<P N="1">1. WHAT is the Import and meaning of this Title, the <HI>living God?</HI></P>
<P>IT is the glorious and <HI>proper</HI> Name of the <HI>true</HI> God, and many times given him in his Word. Jer. 10.10. <HI>The Lord is the true God, he is the living God.</HI> Mat. 16.16. <HI>Thou art Christ, the son of the living God.</HI> Now</P>
<P N="1">1. THE <HI>living</HI> God means the <HI>Eternal</HI> God. <HI>The Lord, the Everlasting God.</HI> He is the <HI>living One</HI> who ever was, is and will be, without be∣ginning or end. Jer. 10.10. <HI>The living God and the Everlasting King.</HI> Psal. 90.2. <HI>From Everlasting to Everlasting Thou art God.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="3" REF="002737_0005_0FE5F43807B246A0"/>2. THE <HI>living</HI> God speaks his <HI>Self existence.</HI> Eternal existence necessarily implies <HI>this.</HI> John 5.26. <HI>The Father hath life in himself.</HI> "God's life is his own: It is originated in Himself <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Willard</HI> on the <HI>Catechism.</HI></NOTE>, and not derived from another". He is life essential and original.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE <HI>living</HI> God speaks a life always the <HI>same.</HI> The immutability and unchangeableness of God is plainly contained in this <HI>Title.</HI> Dan. 6.26. <HI>The living God, and stedfast for ever.</HI></P>
<P>GOD's Name is — <HI>I am that I am.</HI> This is to <HI>live,</HI> and to be the <HI>living One.</HI> I am the Lord, <HI>I change not.</HI> He who is <HI>the same yester∣day, to day and for ever, with whom is no varia∣bleness nor shadow of turning,</HI> He it is that <HI>liveth.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. THE <HI>living</HI> God means the <HI>Fountain of life</HI> to all Creatures. Psal 36.9. <HI>For with thee is the fountain of life. Angels</HI> are living Beings, and <HI>Man</HI> is a living Soul, but <HI>God</HI> gives the Being and Life both to the one and other; up∣holds them in life, and preserves the Spirits. <HI>In Him they live and move and have their being; for they are his Offspring. He giveth unto all life and breath and all things.</HI></P>
<P>ONLY the <HI>Eternal Son,</HI> the <HI>Only begotten,</HI> hath life <HI>in himself,</HI> even as the <HI>Father hath life in himself.</HI> He therefore is no creature: He is the <HI>true God and eternal life.</HI> Life natural and spiritual are of him and from him toge∣ther with the Father. He is the <HI>Everlasting
<PB N="4" REF="002737_0006_0FE5F438D4DBD418"/>
Father</HI> and the living God. John 1.4. <HI>In him was life, and the life was the light of men.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. THE <HI>living</HI> God is in opposition to <HI>false</HI> Gods, Idols &amp; Images, which are <HI>dead</HI> things. The <HI>Stocks</HI> and the graven Images which stupid men have called <HI>Gods,</HI> were lifeless things; and the <HI>Heroes</HI> whom the Nations have ignorantly dei∣fied and worshipp'd were dying or dead men. <HI>The molten Image is falshood,</HI> because there is no <HI>breath</HI> in it. <HI>The portion of Jacob</HI> is not like it; He is <HI>Jehovah, Him that liveth.</HI> Life and death are just in that contradiction the one to the other that the true God is to all false ones. Act. 14.15. <HI>We preach to you that you should turn from these vanities to the living God.</HI> 1 Thes. 1 9. <HI>Ye turned to God from Idols, to serve the living and true GOD.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>reproach</HI> of Idols and of Idolaters is <HI>that the living seek to the dead.</HI> Isai. 8.19. And it should be <HI>hateful</HI> to a living Soul to worship <HI>the deaf, the blind &amp; the dumb.</HI> 2 Sam. 5.8. <HI>The hated of David's soul.</HI> He means the Idol, the <HI>Palladium,</HI> of the <HI>Jebusites,</HI> in which they fot∣tishly trusted.</P>
<P N="6">6. THE <HI>living</HI> God may mean the <HI>activity</HI> of the life of God beyond that of all Creatures. God is the <HI>most active life.</HI> His infinite wisdom, power and goodness in everlasting activity, this is <HI>life.</HI> In Him is life, and the life is the light of all worlds, of all creatures in them that have life.</P>
<P>HOW many vast <HI>Worlds,</HI> and millions of mil∣lions
<PB N="5" REF="002737_0007_0FE5F4399F128B48"/>
of <HI>living spirits,</HI> and <HI>moving creatures</HI> that have life, has the <HI>living God</HI> produc∣ed, and continually preserves? The life of Angels and Men, beasts and all cattle, creeping things and flying fowl, and whatsoever passeth thro' the paths of the Sea, is communi∣cated from him daily, and upheld by him. What an <HI>Active</HI> life is this? which <HI>worketh hi∣therto, &amp; yet works</HI> incessantly, in the most per∣fect ease, thro' all worlds, thro' all time!</P>
<P>THIS <HI>Agency</HI> and activity is plainly intima∣ted in my <HI>text,</HI> which speaks of the <HI>hands</HI> of of the living God, and of <HI>falling</HI> into them. The <HI>Hand</HI> is for <HI>working,</HI> and for <HI>striking</HI> if need be; for expedite and lively working, and for terrible striking. In both respects it intimates a life the most <HI>active</HI> imaginable.</P>
<P>BUT I come to the <HI>Second</HI> Enquiry,</P>
<P N="2">II. WHAT are the <HI>Hands</HI> of the living GOD?</P>
<P>TO be sure nothing like <HI>mens</HI> hands, and much less the lifeless carved hands of an Image. God has no hands nor bodily parts, is not flesh and blood as we are; but He is an <HI>Infinite Essence,</HI> the <HI>Immense Spirit,</HI> filling heaven and earth. When he shewed his Glory to the Elders of <HI>Israel,</HI> they saw no similitude. And when he gave his Commandments from <HI>Sinai,</HI> the <HI>second</HI> of them was— <HI>Thou shalt not make unto thee any likeness of any thing that is in Heaven above, or
<PB N="6" REF="002737_0008_0FE61B9930136368"/>
on the earth beneath.</HI> But in condescention to our weakness, and to help us in our ideas and conceptions of God in his works of Providence and Grace, He has pleas'd to speak to us of his eyes and hands and feet; to let us know that he ever sees us and concerns himself for us, in ways both of mercy &amp; of judgment, as it seems good to his wisdom and holiness. And accord∣ingly by the <HI>hands</HI> of the living God we must understand,</P>
<P N="1">1. His eternal <HI>Power,</HI> his "<HI>lively</HI> power and strength, together with his active <HI>Providence</HI> and universal agency, upholding and governing all his Creatures in all their motions &amp; actions. <HI>In his</HI> hands <HI>are the deep places of the earth, the strength of the hills is his also: He holdeth the waters in the hollow of his</HI> hand, <HI>and in it is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.</HI> The same Almighty <HI>hand</HI> that form'd and fashion'd us, also holdeth our soul in life▪ It is the <HI>good</HI> hand of the Lord our God upon us, and out of it proceedeth all the <HI>evil</HI> that befalls us. Job 2.10. <HI>Shall we receive good at the hand of the Lord? and shall we not receive evil?</HI></P>
<P>THERE is in the governing and all disposing Providence of God his <HI>protecting hand</HI> which is safe and comfortable <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Henry</HI> in loc.</NOTE>; his <HI>supplying</HI> hand which is full and open, munificent and liberal: And there is also his "<HI>correcting hand</HI> which is necessary, good and beneficial; and his <HI>wrathful</HI> hand which is fearful, dreadful and terrible.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="7" REF="002737_0009_0FE61B9937DE4AB8"/>2. BY the <HI>hands</HI> of the living God is meant in my <HI>text</HI> his <HI>Justice,</HI> power and <HI>wrath,</HI> which are against all them that provoke him <HI>His wrathful anger takes hold of them,</HI> Psalm 69.24. You read of <HI>these</HI> hands, Deut. 32.40, 41. <HI>I lift up my hand to heaven and swear, I live for ever</HI>! (O see there the fearful hand of the living God! the hand of him that lives for ever, lift up in swearing by Himself) <HI>if I whet my glit∣tering sword, and my</HI> hand <HI>take hold of judgment, I will render vengeance to my enemies, and reward, them hate me.</HI> These are the Hands that smite and wound, and tear and rend to pieces what∣ever stands in the way of his Holiness. God's wrath in temporal Judgments is his fearful hand: 1 Sam. 5.6. <HI>The hand of the Lord was against them of Ashdod, and he smote them with emerods and destroyed them.</HI> But how much more is there the fearful hand of God in spi∣ritual and eternal judgments?</P>
<P N="3">3. BY the <HI>hands</HI> of the living God we may understand "<HI>his own immediate punishing</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Henry.</HI></NOTE>, as the spiritual and eternal punishment of the wicked is. In temporal and outward punish∣ments God often uses the Hands of <HI>men</HI>; and these must be light and small in comparison of his <HI>own</HI> wrath immediately impressed and in∣flicted upon a poor Soul. Our <HI>Context</HI> points us to this immediate revenging hand of God, — <HI>For we know him that saith, Vengeance is
<PB N="8" REF="002737_0010_0FE61BA5DB4216A0"/>
mine, I will recompence, saith the Lord: It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</HI> The immediate, infinite and eternal Vengeance of God is the thing here spoken of; the vials of his wrath in the next life, not the few scalding drops of it in this only. And O the <HI>hand,</HI> the power and force of this vindic∣tive wrath! This future and everlasting misery of apostate and impenitent sinners "comes from God's own hand. "When he punishes by Creatures (as One has it) the Instrument abates something of the force of the blow, but the weight of his own hand is infinite Misery. This they shall have of God's hand, to ly down in sorrows for ever; endless and insup∣portable. Their destruction shall come <HI>from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.</HI> 2 Thess. 1.9.</P>
<P>BUT this for the meaning of God's <HI>hand</HI> in the <HI>Text.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. WHAT is it to <HI>fall</HI> into the hands of the living God?</P>
<P>IT cannot mean or suppose that we are ever <HI>out</HI> of his hand. No, we are always in it; both Saints and Sinners are so. <HI>All his Saints are in his hand,</HI> the hand of his Mercy, power and grace; and all his <HI>enemies</HI> are in the strong hand of his Justice. <HI>Whither can we go from his Spirit? and whither can we flee from
<PB N="9" REF="002737_0011_0FE61BA5E35578A0"/>
his presence? If we take the wings of the morn∣ing and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there shall his hand lead us, and his right hand shall hold us.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is indeed a falling into the <HI>hands</HI> of Divine wisdom and <HI>goodness,</HI> grace and mer∣cy; a <HI>casting</HI> our selves into them, and God's <HI>taking</HI> us into them. 1 Sam. 24.14. <HI>Let us fall now into the hand of the Lord, for his mercies are great.</HI> We must look to the helping and saving hand of God, and say, <HI>Hold thou me up and I shall be safe! Into thy hand I commit my Spirit!</HI></P>
<P>BUT sinners fall into the hand of Divine <HI>justice,</HI> when it lays hold of them to punish them for their iniquities; when it falls upon them as it were to slay them. When God judges sinners in his righteous and terrible Providence, or when his wrath falls upon their Consciences, or when Death arrests them to carry them in their impenitence to the Judg∣ment seat of <HI>Christ,</HI> and to the place of ever∣lasting torments; then, then do they fall into hand of the living God. When God says to evil angels, or to death, or to the tormentors after death, as <HI>David</HI> did to the young man, Go fall upon this <HI>Amalekite; And he smote him that he died.</HI> It is as when one falls into the hand of a powerful <HI>Enemy</HI>; or rather as when a <HI>Criminal</HI> falls into the hand of Justice, and it is arrested, arraigned, convicted, condemned to die and executed. All impenitent sinners are
<PB N="10" REF="002737_0012_0FE61BA78C7A5DD0"/>
always in the hand of God's <HI>Justice,</HI> under his wrath and curse, under the Sentence of eternal death. And not seldom they fall into the hand of his <HI>Judgments</HI> here in this life, both as to soul and body. But it is especially at <HI>Death</HI> and in the day of <HI>Judgment,</HI> that they fall into the hand of the living God. Then it is laid upon them, lays hold of them, holds them fast, and falls upon them. This is the <HI>Second death.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>WHY</HI> is it so <HI>fearful</HI> a thing to fall into the hand of the living God? I answer, 1. Because the power and wrath of God is in∣finite and insupportable. 2. Because it is eter∣nal and everlasting.</P>
<P N="1">1. BECAUSE the power and wrath of God is <HI>infinite,</HI> intolerable, and insupportable. Psa. 90.11. <HI>Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear so is thy wrath.</HI> It is infinitely beyond all that we can fear or ap∣prehend. Psalm 76.7. <HI>Thou, even Thou art to be feared, and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?</HI> Nahum 1.5, 6. <HI>The mountains quake at Him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burnt up at his presence; yea the world and all that dwell therein: Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him.</HI> Say now if it be not a <HI>fearful</HI> thing to fall into
<PB N="11" REF="002737_0013_0FE61BA7964C09D0"/>
the wrathful hand of this Infinite power! The wrath of an earthly <HI>King</HI> is as the roar∣ing of a <HI>lion</HI>; but to what can we compare the wrath of the Infinite God? How terrible was the wrath of the King, which the three <HI>Wor∣thies</HI> among the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> feared not, tho' it raged against them? Dan. 3.19. <HI>Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Me∣shach and Abednego; therefore he spake and com∣manded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heat; And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind and cast them into the burning fiery furnace.</HI> This is but a little image of the fierceness of the wrath of God, which will cast sinners into <HI>the pit that burneth with fire and brimstone.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. THE wrath and vengeance of the living God is <HI>Eternal</HI> and <HI>Everlasting</HI>; and this it is that renders it so <HI>fearful</HI> a thing to fall into his hand. The <HI>living</HI> God lives for ever to punish. He can and will inflict wrath for ever and ever. He lives to uphold the Soul under everlasting Sufferings.</P>
<P>IT is true that he could annihilate the Soul, and bring it to nothing: But he has made it immortal, made it for immortality, and it cannot die, it shall live for ever, tho' in in∣supportable torments.</P>
<P>GOD is unchangeable Truth, and inflexible Holiness. He has sworn and will not repent.
<PB N="12" REF="002737_0014_0FE61BB1706918D0"/>
He lives for ever and his hand takes hold of Judgment. — Yea his life and being is the most <HI>active</HI> imaginable, both as to punishing and rewarding. The living God is not like <HI>indolent</HI> Idols. He has hands and <HI>uses</HI> them. And all his power and anger is in <HI>everlasting activity</HI> against the wicked. Psalm 7.12. <HI>He will what his sword, he hath bent his bow and made it ready; he hath also prepared for him the instruments of death.</HI> Psalm 11.6. <HI>Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest; this shall be the portion of their cup.</HI> — But the terribleness of this active vengeance is, that it is <HI>Eternal</HI>; the vengeance of <HI>everlasting fire.</HI> Jude ver. 7.</P>
<P>THE living God inflicts eternal death on those whom he damns. The eternal damna∣tion of the wicked proceeds from eternal life in Him. The <HI>Sentence</HI> therefore runs thus; Mat. 25.41. <HI>Depart from Me ye cursed into everlasting fire.</HI> The living God passes this Sentence, and he lives for ever to see it exe∣cuting, through all the ages of Eternity. 2 Thess. 1.9. <HI>Who shall be punished with ever∣lasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.</HI></P>
<P>THE damned after the Day of Judgment will be as much in the wrathful hands of the living God as they were before. The hand that casts them into hell will hold them down therein. <HI>Hell is naked before him and destruction hath no covering.</HI> Once in those living hands
<PB N="13" REF="002737_0015_0FE61BB1B019B0B0"/>
and there for ever. O eternal horror! how fearful a thing to think of!</P>
<Q><L>For ever? fatal word! for ever? who</L>
<L>Can bear the doom of Everlasting woe <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Sir <HI>Richard Blackmore.</HI></NOTE>?</L></Q>
<P>THIS destruction from the Almighty should be indeed a terror to us. It is revealed to us for this end, in so many fearful and terrifying descriptions. Mark 3.29. <HI>In danger of Eternal damnation.</HI> O what a danger, what a hazard is that? what a fearful condition for a poor Soul to be in? Mat. 3.5. <HI>He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</HI> The chaff is such dry stuff that though it yield a vehement and fierce flame, yet it is presently over and out. But though sinners are no better than chaff, and the fire in their Consciences will be a most vehement flame, yet it will never abate and much less go out, but rage on for ever &amp; ever. There's oil eno' in guilt, such as it is, to feed the flames for ever. Mark 9.44. <HI>Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</HI> Here is misery in extremity, both in respect of the degree and of the duration thereof. It is with∣out intermission, diminution or end. O the fearfulness of this state of misery! Well might our <HI>Lord</HI> say, Luke 12.5. <HI>I will forewarn you whom you shall fear; fear him who after he has killed hath power to cast into hell; yea I say unto
<PB N="14" REF="002737_0016_0FE61BB30E1A32F0"/>
you fear him.</HI> The death of the <HI>Body</HI> is soon over, yea though it were to be burnt to death; the flames soon suffocate it or bring it to ashes: But the <HI>Soul</HI> can ly in flaming torments for ever and ever, and yet exist and subsist: And the bodies of wicked souls will be raised in such power and incorruption, as to endure the everlasting burnings of hell with∣out a second dissolution. Revel. 14.10, 11. <HI>The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy Angels and in the presence of the Lamb: And the smoke of their torment ascendeth for ever and ever.</HI> See also <HI>Chap.</HI> 20. the <HI>six</HI> last verses.</P>
<P>THUS <HI>fearful</HI> a thing it is to <HI>fall</HI> into the <HI>hand</HI> of the <HI>living</HI> God, which is <HI>infinite</HI> power and <HI>everlasting</HI> wrath. Isai. 33.14. <HI>Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>USE</HI> is, <HI>Let Sinners fear</HI>: fear the <HI>living</HI> God, fear his <HI>power,</HI> fear his <HI>anger</HI>; fear to fall into his <HI>hand,</HI> and under his wraths As <HI>Elihu</HI> speaks, Job 36.17, 18. <HI>Justice and judgment take hold on thee; because there is wrath beware lest he take thee away with his stroke.</HI></P>
<P>FEAR and <HI>repent</HI>: fear and <HI>flee</HI> from the wrath to come: fear and <HI>cry</HI> earnestly to God that thou perish not▪ fear and make haste to
<PB N="15" REF="002737_0017_0FE61BB3598C38E0"/>
the <HI>City of refuge</HI> for thy poor Soul, to lay hold on the <HI>Hope</HI> set before thee; <HI>JESUS who delivereth from the wrath to come.</HI> Fearing and <HI>trembling</HI> go to <HI>Christ,</HI> believing in him as able and willing to save thee. Get under his sav∣ing wings, put thy self into his merciful hands; lay hold on his righteousness and strength, thy only security. As <HI>Noah</HI> moved with fear pre∣pared an <HI>Ark</HI> for the saving of his house; so <HI>Christ</HI> is the Ark of Salvation for perishing Souls from the <HI>flood</HI> of Divine wrath.</P>
<P>LET Sinners realize the Great GOD in his eternal Being, Power, Providence and Judg∣ment; Justice and Holiness. Let them ever remember their own Immortality, the eternal existence of their precious Souls. And let them never forget the fearful and amazing threatnings of an everlasting punishment for all workers of iniquity. And then let them <HI>stand in awe and not sin</HI>; but <HI>commune with their own heart and be still</HI>; seriously considering with themselves,</P>
<P N="1">1. WHAT a <HI>fearful</HI> state and condition, a state of <HI>sin</HI> is: a state of nature which is a <HI>state of wrath,</HI> and a state of multiplied and aggra∣vated guilts which shall receive <HI>greater dam∣nation.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. THAT the state of <HI>Gospel sinners,</HI> and of <HI>some</HI> sinners under the Gospel, is <HI>more</HI> fearful than that of others.</P>

how worthy of death they are beyond others, by reason of unbelief presumptuous sins and impenitence. Read the <HI>Context</HI> from the 26. <HI>verse. For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remain∣eth no more sacrifice for sins; But a fearful look∣ing for of judgment and of fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries: He that despised Moses law died without mercy under two or three witnes∣ses; Of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an un∣holy thing, and hath done despite to the Spirit of Grace? For we know him that hath said, Venge∣ance belongeth to me, I will recompence saith the Lord: And again, the Lord shall judge his peo∣ple. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</HI></P>
<P>YOU that have heard the <HI>voice</HI> of the living God, as it were <HI>out of the midst of the fire</HI>; Deut. 5.26. How ought you to quake and tremble at the thought of falling into his revenging hands? You must <HI>defy</HI> the living God, if you do not fear him, in the declarations &amp; threat∣nings of his written word. And are you this <HI>Goliah</HI> of hell, to face the terrors of the living God with words of defiance in your mouth? Ah! how easily will you fall before the least instrument of death in the hand of his Provi∣dence and Judgment! how easily will his Curse sink into your <HI>forehead</HI> and triumph over the monster of iniquity!</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="002737_0019_0FE61BBD9D9132D8"/>YOU that have been <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ending the Name of the living God in horrid <HI>Oaths,</HI> cursings and im∣precations; <HI>Swearing</HI> vainly and falsly and ludicrously by it; in your passions, or in your sports and jests; how <HI>fearful</HI> should it be to you to think of falling into the hands of the living God? who has said (and made it one of his <HI>ten</HI> Words, the ten <HI>Commandments) Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his Name in vain.</HI></P>
<P>YOU that have liv'd upon <HI>rapine</HI> and <HI>rob∣beries,</HI> the spoil of your innocent and righteous Neighbours; how <HI>fearful</HI> should it be to you to think of falling into the hands of the living God? who has said — <HI>that he hates the robberies of the wicked, and that the unrighteous &amp; thieves shall not enter into the Kingdom of God.</HI></P>

of that <HI>wicked one</HI> (the devil) that <HI>murderer from the beginning,</HI> and have slain your <HI>Brethren</HI> because their deeds were righteous, and you knew they would not join with you in your impieties; — how can you dare to think of falling into the hands of the living God? who has said — <HI>The murderer shall surely be put to death: A man that doeth violence to the blood of any person, shall flee to the pit, let no man stay him.</HI> And again, Revel. 21.8. <HI>Murderers shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone.</HI></P>
<P>GOD is the Author and giver of Life. Death is an odious thing in his eyes. Therefore it is made the punishment of Sin. The living God cannot be more affronted and provoked than by that contempt and wrong which living souls and spirits do by sin pour on their own <HI>life,</HI> and therein on his Image and Authority. For he is the <HI>Lord of Life,</HI> and the <HI>Father of Spi∣rits.</HI> They are both his <HI>Subjects</HI> and his <HI>Off∣spring.</HI> As a <HI>King</HI> he can't bear the destructi∣on of his Subjects, and as a <HI>Father</HI> he can't bear the murder of his children· Apply all this to mens <HI>shedding innocent blood,</HI> and in∣fer the righteous vengeance of God on them that shed it.</P>
<P>THUS there are some sinners whose flagrant crimes make it a <HI>more</HI> fearful thing for them to fall into the hands of the living God.— But</P>
<P N="3">3. MOST of all fearful is a state of <HI>Security</HI> in sin, and <HI>hardness of heart.</HI> The sins before
<PB N="19" REF="002737_0021_0FE61BBEAE0599D8"/>
named do strangely harden mens hearts, but the <HI>fearless</HI> sinner is never secure, is least of all secure; is most in danger of God's terrible wrath; and that because he is the <HI>living</HI> God, and sees his fearlessness and is incensed by it. The secure <HI>fool</HI> says in his heart — "The liv∣ing God is not present, nor sees nor knows, nor will bring me into judgment". When at the same time the foolish sinner is within the dreadful hand of that God, whom he is deny∣ing and daring by his Security. He therefore is above all men in danger of Gods taking him presently and tearing him to pieces. The ter∣rors of God should now fall upon him, and <HI>fearfulness and horror should overwhelm him; a dreadful sound should be in his ears of the destroy∣er coming on him: Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid, they shall prevail upon him as a king ready to the battel: For he stretcheth out his hands against God, he strengthneth himself against the Almighty; he runneth upon him, even upon his neck, upon the thick bosses of his buckler.</HI> But if he sleep on still in his security, yet</P>
<P N="4">4. HOW <HI>fearful</HI> will the hands of the living God be in the hour of <HI>death</HI> and in the day of <HI>judgment?</HI> When the <HI>king of terrors</HI> advances with his mortal dart in his hand, and pointed at thy guilty heart; then <HI>fear</HI> and the <HI>pit</HI> and the <HI>snare</HI> will together present themselves before thee. Thy heart will be then <HI>sore pain∣ed</HI> within thee, and the <HI>horrors of death</HI> will fall upon thee; then <HI>fear will come as desola∣tion,

and destruction as a whirlwind; distress and anguish will come upon thee:</HI> Then <HI>terrors will pursue thy</HI> fluttering <HI>soul as the wind, and thy welfare will pass away as a cloud, and thy soul shall be poured out upon thee:</HI> Then comes the <HI>fearful looking for of judgment, and of fiery indig∣nation to devour</HI> thee.— But the horrors of that dreadful day can by no means be conceived of or represented. A little image or shadow of it you have, Rev. 6.12—17. <HI>And the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood, and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, and the heaven departed as a scrowl, and every mountain and island were moved out of their places; And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bond man, and every free man hid themselves in the dens, and in the rocks of the mountains; and said to the moun∣tains and rocks, fall on us and hide us from the face of Him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: For the great day of his wrath is come, and who shall be able to stand?</HI></P>
<P>LET sinners therefore <HI>fear</HI> the living God, and consider</P>
<P N="1">1. HOW <HI>soon,</HI> how <HI>suddenly</HI> they may fall into his hands. <HI>This night their souls may be required,</HI> and <HI>in hell they may lift up their eyes in torments.</HI> When they ly down to sleep, their eyes may be closed in eternal death.

No: while God lives he will hold you fast (in everlasting chains) and <HI>none shall pluck you out of his</HI> righteous <HI>hands.</HI> Take therefore the gracious warning and advice of <HI>Christ,</HI> Matth. 5.25, 26. <HI>Agree with thine Adver∣sary quickly, while thou art in the way with him, lest at any time the Adversary deliver thee to the Judge, and the Judge deliver thee to the Officer, and thou be cast into prison; Verily, I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid, the uttermost farthing.</HI></P>
<P>AND thus, as I could, I have <HI>opened</HI> and <HI>applied</HI> this awful and awakning <HI>Subject.</HI> May the <HI>living God</HI> (of his infinite mercies) set it home upon all our hearts; and give us grace (every one) to be applying it to the case and state of our own souls. More especially I hope that <HI>You</HI> the poor <HI>Prisoners</HI> under the sentence of death for your crimes, have been very seri∣ously applying the very terrible things that you have heard, for your own awakning and humiliation; by the will and grace and power of our God upon your souls. O that it may be so! and that this <HI>last Sabbath</HI> you have to live, and this last time you have to hear in a publick Assembly, might be <HI>a time of God's love,</HI> and <HI>a day of his power</HI> on your Souls. — O may the fear and <HI>dread</HI> of God's excellent Majesty, and amazing wrath, now fall on you!

the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God, whom you have so often and greatly <HI>quenched,</HI> come down like <HI>fire</HI> upon your hearts and consciences, and make his word as <HI>a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces.</HI></P>
<P>O you greatly need <HI>this,</HI> and a far more a∣wakning <HI>discourse</HI> that might bring divine light with <HI>flame</HI> and burning into your <HI>hardned</HI> and insensible Souls. For you have been sadly hardning your own hearts by <HI>profaneness and blasphemies,</HI> by <HI>drunkenness and sottishness</HI>; by your <HI>piracies, robberies and murders</HI>; and by your <HI>laughing</HI> at the very thunders of God. How did you harden your hearts, or how were they hardned, against the <HI>cries</HI> and supplicati∣ons of your poor distressed <HI>brother</HI> (your <HI>Master</HI> and <HI>Commander</HI>) in the sad hour when he <HI>beso't</HI> you only to spare his life, and <HI>not to send him down quick into hell,</HI> without a minutes time wherein to repent and to cry to God for mer∣cy. Ah, how much more gracious and <HI>merciful</HI> has God and man been to you than you were to him! Witness all the prayers that have been poured out over you and for you, by the <HI>Ministers</HI> and People of God in publick, in pri∣vate and in secret; and witness the solemn <HI>Calls</HI> and compassionate Invitations you have had to repent and seek the tender mercies of God thro' Jesus Christ. — O you are <HI>verily guilty concerning your Brother, in that you saw the anguish of his soul when he beso't you, and you would not hear.</HI> But you see <HI>Brethren</HI> the com∣passion

and anguishes of our souls for you, that you may repent and be saved. And the Lord deliver you from <HI>hardness of heart,</HI> now you are fallen into his dreadful <HI>hands,</HI> and are go∣ing within <HI>two</HI> days to appear before the <HI>liv∣ing God,</HI> even before his judgment seat, the bar of his Justice, to stand for an Eternal life or death. O that you might <HI>find mercy of the Lord in that day,</HI> and that <HI>the Second and Eternal death might have no power over you.</HI></P>
<P><HI>GOD's hand</HI> it is that hath delivered you up to die. The hand of <HI>man,</HI> the hand of justice, could have no power at all over you, had not the hand of God given you into it. And now that you are falling into the <HI>invisible hand</HI> of the Eternal God, in the day of your Execution, will you not <HI>yet</HI> fear and repent and give glo∣ry to him? <HI>Fear him who after the destruction of the body, can cast the soul down into hell,</HI> into everlasting burnings, <HI>where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched</HI>; and who will most certainly do so unless you repent, and cry to Christ, with the faith of <HI>the repenting thief, Lord remember me from thy heavenly Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>AND if you look up to him that was <HI>pierced,</HI> in the anguish and <HI>bitterness</HI> of your souls, and with a repenting faith, he will look down up∣on you in the <HI>prison</HI> and on the <HI>gibbet,</HI> and re∣member you in his tender pity and infinite compassion.</P>

<P><HI>IT is a faithful saying and worthy of all accep∣tation, that Jesus Christ came into the world to save the chief of sinners.</HI> He says even to <HI>such, Look unto me and be ye saved!

turn is this to my <HI>text!</HI> for as it is a <HI>fearful</HI> thing to fall into the wrathful hands of the living God, so it is a <HI>joyful</HI> thing to fall into the merciful hands of a sin pardoning God. But then this <HI>turn</HI> and change of my <HI>text</HI> sup∣poses a turn and change in your <HI>Souls,</HI> your state toward God. Of his mercy he saves souls <HI>thro' the washing of regeneration.</HI> He will take away <HI>the heart of stone</HI> and give you a soft and broken contrite Spirit, and so prepare you for his mercy. And if he do this, <HI>the high and lofty One that inhabiteth Eternity,</HI> will come down into your hearts, even in the dungeon, (<HI>for the Lord despiseth not his prisoners</HI>) to <HI>revive the heart of the humble, and the spirit of the contrite one.</HI> Then he'll hold you up in the hands of grace, now, at death, and thro' a blessed Eternity. <HI>The Eternal God is the only refuge of living souls, and underneath a repenting sinner are the Everlasting arms.</HI></P>
<P>INTO these <HI>saving hands of grace,</HI> we would bring You, into them we would commit you; <HI>our poor dying Brethren</HI>; lately the common Enemies of Mankind; but now our Brethren in Christ Jesus, if with repenting souls you make your flight to him. The prayer of all the Lord's people is for you, that his almigh∣ty arm may be stretched out to convert you, and his gracious arms receive you for ever.

Grace. May he who was made a <HI>Curse</HI> for us, by suffering the accursed death, <HI>the Just for the unjust,</HI> redeem your poor souls from the Eter∣nal curse</P>
<P>THE Lord enable you to give <HI>glory</HI> to him and <HI>warning</HI> to men, when you come to die.

<P><HI>YOURS</HI> is the danger, more especially, (<HI>my Friends</HI> and Neighbours, <HI>who do business on the great waters</HI>) yours is the danger of <HI>falling</HI> into and by the hands of such wicked and barbarous men: <HI>Thank</HI> God for all your preservations, <HI>pray</HI> daily to him your great Preserver.</P>
<P>YOURS is the danger of <HI>joyning</HI> with such wicked and bloody men when taken by them. The Lord by his grace <HI>keep</HI> you in that dread∣ful case. To die is more eligible. And it is marvellous to some of us to hear, how many <HI>threatnings</HI> and hazards of instant death many of you have pass'd thro', and yet <HI>gallantly</HI> (I wish I could say, <HI>graciously</HI>) refused. To God be all the glory of such Virtue, such constancy

<P>YOURS, <HI>our Seafaring friends,</HI> is the danger of turning <HI>robbers</HI> and <HI>murderers</HI>; and so of a life of horror and terror here, and of wailing and anguish for ever; because of those <HI>vices and lusts</HI> that reign among and over the men of the Sea; Namely, <HI>profaness, cursing</HI> and <HI>bitterness, swearing</HI> and <HI>blasphemy, drunkenness</HI> and <HI>revel∣lings, contempt of religion</HI> and <HI>profanation of the Lord's Day, whoredom</HI> and <HI>uncleanness.</HI> These quench conscience and the convictions of God's Spirit, stupify and harden mens hearts; take away all fear of God and sense of sin; or regard to men, their estates or lives. And so while you <HI>sail</HI> on the waters, <HI>(beholding the wonders of God in the deep,</HI> but never thinking of him, al∣ways defying and blaspheming him) you <HI>drown</HI> your Souls in destruction and perdition; turn∣ing robbers and murderers till neither the Land or Waters can bear you any longer.</P>
<P>I know that there are <HI>virtuous &amp; worthy Per∣sons</HI> that follow the Sea, as good as those that stay ashore; and that there are as <HI>bad</HI> ashore as any that are on the Sea.

people may increase greatly on the <HI>Sea</HI> and on the <HI>dry Land</HI>; for both are God's. But I hold my self call'd at this time to <HI>warn</HI> our seafaring friends, <HI>as my beloved Brethren,</HI> of their pecu∣liar temptations and hazard.

<P>THE miserable <HI>Persons</HI> to whom, and at whose desire the forgoing <HI>Sermon</HI> was preached, were <HI>Samuel Cole</HI> and <HI>Henry Greenvill.</HI> There was also present with them <HI>George Condick.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Captain</HI> of the Pirates, <HI>William Fly,</HI> re∣fused to come into publick. I mov'd the others for <HI>his</HI> sake, to let me preach to them in pri∣vate: But they said, It was the last <HI>Sabbath</HI> they had to live, and they earnestly desired to be in an <HI>Assembly</HI> of Worshippers, that they might have the <HI>Prayers</HI> of many together over them, and that others might take the more <HI>warning</HI> by them.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Story</HI> of these wretched men is short and tragical. They sail'd from <HI>Jamaica</HI> on board a <HI>Snoe, John Green</HI> Commander, bound to <HI>Guinea.</HI> They had not been long at Sea be∣fore they conspired to seize the <HI>Captain</HI> and <HI>Mate,</HI> and then go a <HI>pirating.</HI> On the 27th of <HI>May</HI> 1726. they put in execution their wicked design, in a most cruel and barbarous manner. About one a clock in the morning, <HI>William Fly</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="002737_0032_0FE61BE9F32B8490"/>
then <HI>Boatswain</HI> of the <HI>Snoe Elizabeth,</HI> after he had been some time forward with several of the <HI>Sailors,</HI> came aft with <HI>Alexander Mitchel</HI> and others, and said to <HI>Morrice Cunden (Gun∣ner</HI> of the Ship) then at helm,
<Q>D—n you, you dog, if you stir hand or foot, or speak a word, I'll blow your brains out.</Q>
And im∣mediately thereupon he went into the <HI>Cab∣bin</HI> where <HI>Captain Green</HI> was in bed, and <HI>Alexander Mitchel</HI> follow'd him; and while they were there <HI>Morrice Cunden</HI> heard the <HI>Captain</HI> cry out, <HI>What's the matter</HI>? But they soon hawl'd him upon deck, and were about to throw him into the Sea; when the poor man begg'd of them to spare his life, saying, <Q><HI>For God's sake</HI> Boatswain <HI>don't throw me over board, for if you do I shall go to hell.</HI></Q> But though in the anguish and amazement of his soul he thus pleaded with them, that they would not send him down quick into hell, for that he was not fit to die; yet his plea made no impression at all upon their hardned hearts. <HI>Fly</HI> bid him say after him these words, <Q><HI>Lord have mercy upon my soul</HI>;</Q> and away they hurried the poor surpris'd and astonish'd man overboard. It is affirmed that he caught hold of a rope and held for his life, which when one of the wretches saw he cut off his hand with an ax; and so he dropt into Eternity.</P>
<P>AT the same time some others of this <HI>bloody crew</HI> surpris'd the <HI>Mate</HI> of the Ship, <HI>Thomas
<PB N="31" REF="002737_0033_0FE61BEA08B293E8"/>
Jenkins.</HI> And <HI>Thomas Streaton</HI> (the <HI>Carpenter</HI> of the Ship) deposed that he heard <HI>Samuel Cole</HI> say to <HI>Jenkins,</HI> <Q><HI>Come out of your Cabbin, you dog!</HI></Q> and presently he was hawl'd out, and told <Q><HI>that he should go overboard after his Captain.</HI></Q> When he was in the Sea he was heard calling earnestly to the <HI>Doctor</HI> to hand him a rope. But the <HI>Doctor</HI> was by this time himself putting into Irons.</P>
<P>THUS <HI>bloodily</HI> these inhumane Creatures began their <HI>Piracy,</HI> but Vengeance follow'd them and suffer'd them not to live.</P>
<P><HI>William Fly,</HI> the chief and worst (we may suppose) of these barbarous rogues, took on him the Command, and named the <HI>Snoe</HI> the <HI>Fames Revenge.</HI> They were well stored with <HI>Powder,</HI> and <HI>Rum</HI> and <HI>Provisions,</HI> but wanted a better <HI>Vessel</HI>; and in quest of this it is likely they bent their course first to <HI>Carolina</HI> and from thence to <HI>New England.</HI> On the <HI>third</HI> of <HI>June</HI> they took a <HI>Sloop</HI> at Anchor off <HI>North-Carolina,</HI> on board of which was Mr. <HI>William Atkinson</HI> a Passenger; who was afterwards the happy Instrument in the hand of God for their destruction. They very much needed one so well skill'd as <HI>Atkinson</HI> was both as a <HI>Mariner</HI> and <HI>Pilot,</HI> and <HI>Fly</HI> treated him well on that account, but kept a strict eye upon him, forbidding him to have any conversation
<PB N="32" REF="002737_0034_0FE61BFAB6278680"/>
with the forc'd men; and lest he should he had a hammock given him in the <HI>Cabbin.</HI></P>
<P>THEY commanded him to carry them to <HI>Martha's Vineyard</HI> in order to wood and water there, and in hopes to meet with some Sloop sitting for their purpose <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">This is Mr. <HI>Atkinson</HI>'s own Account of things.</NOTE>: But he resolved to run the venture of carrying them past the <HI>Vine∣yard,</HI> and run them up into or near the <HI>Bay</HI> before they were aware of it. When they perceiv'd it they began to look upon him with an evil eye, &amp; spake of throwing him overboard. But as <HI>Fly</HI> was uttering his rage at him the next morning on this account, and telling him what death he should die if any thing ill be∣fell them thro' his conduct, a <HI>Schooner</HI> came in sight which put an end to <HI>Fly</HI>'s rage, for the joy of a good Prize. They found it a <HI>Schooner</HI> of <HI>Marblehead, George Girdler</HI> Master.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Atkinson</HI> had some time before this meditated the seizing on <HI>Fly</HI> and Company, and found means secretly to communicate his mind to some on board, whom he thought he might trust; particularly to <HI>Samuel Walker,</HI> and <HI>Thomas Streaton</HI>; and <HI>Walker</HI> had spoken of it to <HI>James Benbrook</HI>; who all consented if a fair opportunity should offer.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="002737_0035_0FE61BFAC25215F0"/>IT was very necessary to his design to <HI>ingra∣tiate</HI> himself, as far as he honestly and with a good conscience could, with <HI>Fly</HI> and his Pirates. Yet in doing this he ran a <HI>risque</HI> both of his innocence and his life: Of his <HI>In∣nocence,</HI> for <HI>with a furious man thou shalt not go, lest thou learn his ways and get a snare to thy soul</HI>; And of his <HI>Life,</HI> for as some of the <HI>Pi∣rates,</HI> the <HI>Captain</HI> especially, began to think friendly of him and to hearken to his Ad∣vice; (they all depending on him to navigate the Ship) so if a <HI>Ship of War</HI> had taken them it is to be feared that he had in vain pleaded his innocence and good intentions. But the good God who preserv'd, has also pleaded his innocence. And we ought to praise his virtue, conduct and courage, and give God the glory of it.</P>
<P><HI>Fly</HI> had no sooner taken the <HI>Schooner</HI> of <HI>Marblehead,</HI> but they discovered another at a distance from them. Whereupon he put <HI>three</HI> men on board the <HI>Schooner,</HI> and purposed to bear down on the new <HI>Sail</HI> with both his Ves∣sels. But Mr. <HI>Atkinson</HI> with a ready thought advised him to put <HI>six</HI> men into the <HI>Schooner</HI> and send her down on the fishing Vessels, being her self one of their company but a day before, and so there would be no likelyhood of their flying from her: but (said he) if the <HI>Snoe</HI> and the <HI>Schooner</HI> now bear down together they'll take you for what you are, and make away
<PB N="34" REF="002737_0036_0FE61BFBCBF036A0"/>
from you. <HI>Fly</HI> came into his advice and put three men more into the <HI>Schooner,</HI> and parted with her, standing a course wide from her.</P>
<P>NOW <HI>Atkinson</HI>'s thoughts were hard at work how to draw <HI>Fly</HI> away from his <HI>Arms</HI> on the quarter-deck. For there he kept alone, nor would suffer <HI>Atkinson</HI> to step up, so much as to set down the <HI>Bowl</HI> of punch after he had drank to him. And probably a Message which he receiv'd from a chief <HI>Pirate</HI> on board the <HI>Schooner,</HI> by the boat, <Q><HI>To have a special care of his Friend,</HI></Q> did increase his jealousie; tho' he seem'd only to laugh at it.</P>
<P>WITHIN a little while <HI>Atkinson</HI> spied a <HI>Sail</HI> a head to the <HI>Leward,</HI> and informed <HI>Fly</HI> of it. And presently after he pretended to discover two or three more sail, and told him he would have a <HI>fleet</HI> of prizes. But <HI>Fly</HI> with his glass could see but <HI>one.</HI> Why said <HI>Atkinson,</HI> If you were but here, Sir, with your glass, a-head, you would easily see them all. On a sudden <HI>Fly</HI> forgat his caution, and comes off the quarter-deck, where his arms lay, and sets him down a-head to spy the Sails spoken of. Then <HI>Atkinson</HI> gave the sign to his friends, and <HI>Walker</HI> follow'd by <HI>Benbrook</HI> came up, pretending at first to direct the <HI>Cap∣tain</HI> to look a point or two on such a side, while <HI>Atkinson</HI> (a spare and slender man) pass'd aft toward the <HI>Arms,</HI> and in the instant
<PB N="35" REF="002737_0037_0FE61BFBD4BF91B8"/>
that <HI>Walker</HI> laid hold of <HI>Fly</HI> he took the fire∣arms, and returned pointing the gun to the <HI>Pirate's</HI> breast, and telling him
<Q>He was a dead man if he did not immediately submit himself his prisoner.</Q>
The wicked <HI>Fly</HI> earnestly <HI>begg'd</HI> for his life, and now found that <HI>mercy</HI> which he had so barbarously denied to his <HI>innocent Captain.</HI></P>
<P>IN the midst of this struggle the Pirate <HI>Greenvil</HI> put up his head from between decks: for there as Providence order'd it He and <HI>Condick</HI> were at this instant; and as for the pirate <HI>Cole</HI> he had been in <HI>Irons</HI> for two days before, by <HI>Fly</HI>'s order, for some mutiny he had made. This it was that render'd the subdu∣ing them so easy to <HI>Atkinson</HI> and his three Com∣panions: for now <HI>Streaton</HI> had fallen in, and guarded one place, while <HI>Atkinson</HI> did the other, keeping the Pirates down. The Action was so surprising to the other <HI>Forc'd Men,</HI> that for a time they stood astonied and like Men amazed, not capable of acting for their own deliverance; altho' vehemently call'd upon and threatned by <HI>Atkinson.</HI> But in a little time they came to themselves and joyfully fell in with their <HI>De∣liverers.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Fly</HI> found himself chain'd down and effectually secur'd, he fell at times into the most desperate <HI>ragings,</HI> cursing himself and her that bare him, and the Day wherein he was born;
<PB N="36" REF="002737_0038_0FE61C124E946818"/>
cursing the very heavens &amp; in effect the <HI>God</HI> that judged him; Cursing all <HI>rovers</HI> that should ever give quarter again to an <HI>Englishman</HI>; and wish∣ing all the devils of hell would come and fly away with the Ship: The same <HI>Blasphemer</HI> now in his furious <HI>despair,</HI> or worse than he ever was before in his <HI>jollity</HI> and pride; when he wou'd sometimes even dare to ridicule the noise of Gods <HI>Thunder,</HI> as it rattled over him, Saying, <Q><HI>That they were playing bowls in the Air,</HI></Q> &amp;c. and as the <HI>Lightnings</HI> sometimes flash'd upon them, he would say — <Q><HI>Who fires now? Stand by,</HI></Q> &amp;c. — So he dar'd the dreadful Vengeance, which persu'd him swift as the <HI>Lightnings</HI> and suddenly struck him.</P>
<P>BUT Capt. <HI>Atkinson</HI> and his brave <HI>Mates</HI> are much to be prais'd, that they dealt so <HI>merci∣fully</HI> with these <HI>bloody Men</HI>; and neither <HI>blew their brains out</HI> (their own phrase) nor threw them overboard. <HI>Blessed be God that kept them that day from shedding blood, and from avenging themselves with their own hands.</HI> It was much better to reserve the <HI>Murderers</HI> to the Judgment of the <HI>Law,</HI> in the proper course of it. Hereby the guilty <HI>Miserables</HI> had a space granted them for <HI>repentance,</HI> and were bro't under the happy <HI>means</HI> of it; Means <HI>happy</HI> we hope to two of them, namely <HI>Greenvil</HI> and <HI>Cole.</HI></P>
<P>Capt <HI>Atkinson</HI> and Company now made the best of their way for the Port of <HI>Boston.</HI> The
<PB N="37" REF="002737_0039_0FE61C1256B01330"/>
Pirate <HI>Schooner</HI> made after them till night part∣ed, when they altered their course and lost her. On the 29 of <HI>June</HI> they arriv'd at <HI>Boston,</HI> and Surrender'd themselves, their Prisoners and the <HI>Snoe</HI> into the hands of the <HI>Government.</HI> On <HI>Monday</HI> the <HI>fourth</HI> of <HI>July</HI> a <HI>Special Court of Ad∣miralty</HI> was held at the <HI>Court house</HI> in <HI>Boston,</HI> where Mr. <HI>Atkinson</HI> and Eleven more pass'd their <HI>Trial</HI> and were <HI>acquitted: Fly, Cole, Green∣vil</HI> and <HI>Condick</HI> were found <HI>guilty,</HI> and Sentenc'd to <HI>die.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fly</HI> at his trial, as well as before and after it, behav'd boldly and impenitently. <HI>Cole</HI> and <HI>Greenvil</HI> more modestly, humbly, penitently; like Men greatly concern'd for their Souls, and distressed for their Sins. And this continu'd to the day and hour of their death. As for <HI>George Condick</HI> he appear'd ignorant, stupid and insensible; was acquitted by the <HI>Court</HI> of the <HI>Murder,</HI> and was afterward <HI>repriev'd</HI> at the place of Execution.</P>
<P>ON <HI>Tuesday,</HI> July 12. their <HI>Execution</HI> came on, and <HI>Fly</HI> briskly and in a way of bravery jumpt up into the <HI>Cart,</HI> with a nose gay in his hand, bowing with much unconcern to the Spectators as he pass'd along, and at the <HI>Gal∣lows</HI> he behaved still obstinately and boldly till his face was covered for death; but <HI>Green∣vill</HI> and <HI>Cole</HI> behaved piously and penitently in a judgment of charity. — <HI>Fly</HI> was the
<PB N="38" REF="002737_0040_0FE61C168B95C260"/>
greatest Instance of <HI>obduracy</HI> that has yet been seen among all the <HI>Malefactors</HI> who have suf∣fer'd in these parts.</P>
<P>THE Reverend <HI>Ministers</HI> of the <HI>Town</HI> visit∣ed them often, discours'd them seriously and affectionately, prayed with them frequently and fervently, and preached to 'em both in private and in publick.</P>
<P><HI>Samuel Cole</HI> in the morning before his Exe∣cution delivered a <HI>Paper,</HI> wherein he confess'd and bewail'd
<Q>his giving himself in his youth to the sin of <HI>drinking</HI>; and that while a boy he learn'd and addicted himself unto the too common sin of <HI>Swearing</HI> and blaspheming the great and fearful Name of God: Also his early defrauding his Master by <HI>stealing Liquors</HI> for wicked men, who entic'd and encourag'd him to do it: Also that when he arriv'd to Manhood he consulted nothing but sinful <HI>pleasures,</HI> drinking, whoring, danc∣ing, &amp;c. He desired all <HI>Sea-faring men</HI> to take warning by his shameful and ignomini∣ous death; which he was now come to by listning to the wicked words and actions of horrible men. He confess'd himself to be justly condemned, and gave abundance of thanks for the assistance of many good <HI>Mi∣nisters,</HI> their kind Exhortations and good Doctrine to him; He ask'd their continued prayers, and the prayers of all good people,
<PB N="39" REF="002737_0041_0FE61C16933ED588"/>
for his poor soul to the last hour of his life; and express'd his hope, thro' the blood of his dear Redeemer <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> his Lord, of entring into the Kingdom of heaven.</Q></P>
<P>THIS <HI>paper</HI> he earnestly desired might be published to the world. The other <HI>Prisoners</HI> said little, but warn'd all <HI>Masters</HI> and <HI>Com∣manders</HI> against severity and barbarity to their Men, which (they said) they were persuaded is the reason of so many turning <HI>Pirates.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER the Execution, the <HI>three dead Bodies</HI> were carried to a small <HI>Island,</HI> about two leagues from the <HI>Town</HI>; where the body of <HI>Fly</HI> is hung up in <HI>Irons,</HI> as a Spectacle for warn∣ing to others; and the two other bodies were buried there.</P>
