<HEAD>The LIFE of RICHARD BARRICK.</HEAD>
<P>I RIHCARD BARRICK, was born in <HI>Ireland,</HI> in the month of February, in the year 1763, and brought up at the Foundling-Hospital: I never could read nor write. At ten years of age I went as an Apprentice to James Saunders, a Silk-weaver in <HI>Spittlefield</HI> Parish, lived with my master about three years, but he starved and froze me almost to death, for which I left him, and roved through the streets, and frequently stole small things from shop-win∣dows.</P>
<P>I went to <HI>Salt-petre Bank,</HI> and joined a gang of thieves. We stole from many people for the space of a year; when I was taken up for stealing a handkerchief, and carried before the Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> who sent me to Gaol; I was tried and found not <HI>innocent;</HI> was complimented with thirteen stripes, which is continental colours, signifying, that I should be honoured in <HI>America</HI> with the <HI>Hibernian</HI> coat of arms, that is, two sticks <HI>rampant,</HI> one <HI>couch∣ant,</HI> a string <HI>pendant,</HI> and an <HI>Irishman</HI> at the end of it.</P>
<P>I joined my old gang again, and continued picking pockets for a year, and then was taken up and com∣mitted to Gaol, and lay there eleven weeks for trial; then I was tried and found guilty. They told
<PB N="4" REF="018559_0003_0FA7B076254C2FF0"/>
me they would pardon me if I would enter on board one of his Majesty's ships; this I consent∣ed to, but made my escape before I got to the ship. I returned back to <HI>Salt-petre Bank,</HI> where I joined my old companions in iniquity; went on picking pockets for six months, and was apprehend∣ed on suspicion of Robbery, and was sent on board a vessel, in which I came to <HI>New-York.</HI></P>
<P>Then I deserted and went to <HI>Long-Island,</HI> and lived with Mr. Volentine Williams; I left him and lived with Mr. Kirk fifteen months, intending to learn the Paper-making business. During this time, I was as honest as the times would allow. I left Mr. Kirk, and went to <HI>Horse-Neck,</HI> intending to go to the place from whence I came, and follow my old trade of <HI>Basket Making.</HI></P>
<P>Soon after this I and my comrades went to <HI>Long-Island,</HI> with an intent to rob James Ulits; but the weather being very severe, we turned back. On our return we met with a British vessel which we boarded and carried her into <HI>Stanford.</HI> We then went back to Mr. Ulits, in the night, and told him he must get up, for his brother's child was very sick.—He supposing us to be robbers, called for his firelock: We then forced in at the windows, and demanded his money. He said he had none; but his wife asked us how much we wanted? I answered one hundred pounds, Mr. Ulit went down cellar with a light in his hand, and we followed him; he took a horn from under a hogshead, which contain∣ed one hundred and ninety odd guineas. He then attempted to count out our hundred pounds which we demanded; but we told him as he made some
<PB N="5" REF="018559_0004_0FA7B076C3B2C318"/>
resistance at first, we would take all he had. He then gave us another horn, which contained about forty guineas: Then he gave us a number of dollars. We went out of the house, but soon concluded that if he had so many guineas, it was more than proba∣ble he had some other sort of gold; therefore we went back and demanded the remainder.—Then he gave us another horn containing thirty two half-Joes. we also took his plate and clothing, to the Value of four hundred dollars.</P>
<P>Soon after this, I was taken and put under guard on <HI>Long-Island.</HI></P>
<P>The Colonel ordered me from <HI>Long-Island</HI> to <HI>New-York</HI> goal for trial; where I remained three weeks, and then broke goal.</P>
<P>I returned to <HI>Greenwich,</HI> and was there re-taken for the same crime, and carried back to <HI>New-York.</HI></P>
<P>I broke out the second time and returned to <HI>Green∣wich.</HI></P>
<P>Then I went to <HI>Philadelphia</HI> and there I was taken up and committed to goal for <HI>Burglary,</HI> and tried for my life; but was acquitted. I was taken back to goal and had another trial and found guilty of theft. Then I was sent back to the work-house, to pick oakum for a month and pay fifteen pounds fine. (It may be noted here, that I had been confined in the dungeon in <HI>Philadelphia</HI> six weeks before.) I tarried in the work-house one fortnight, and then run away and came to <HI>New-York,</HI> there I stole a dozen silver spoons, out of a goldsmiths case. Then went to <HI>New-Haven,</HI> and broke open a shop, and stole goods to the amount of one hundred dollars: And from thence to <HI>New-London,</HI> and met with one of my old friends; he and I broke open a house and stole some clothing. Then went to <HI>Providence,</HI> and
<PB N="6" REF="018559_0005_0FA7B077785BDF28"/>
there I stole a watch out of a man's pocket, but was taken; I gave the man five dollars and his watch, and he said no more about it. I then went to <HI>Bos∣ton,</HI> and got in company with one Poor; and one John Sullivan (the latter is now under sentence of death with me) we went to <HI>Winter's-Hill,</HI> and there robbed one Mr. Baldwin, for which crime Sullivan and myself are to suffer Death, as being the just re∣ward of our demerits.</P>

<HEAD>The LIFE of ALEXANDER WHITE, a PIRATE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is to give satisfaction to all enquiring friends, that I ALEXANDER WHITE, was born in <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> in the County of <HI>Tryone,</HI> in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and sixty-two, and was brought up in the said place, and got what education my parents thought necessary. After I grew up my mind being inclined to visit strange Countries against my parent's will. I took my departure from <HI>Ireland,</HI> and went to <HI>England,</HI> and bound myself ap∣prentice to learn the Mariners art, and served my Master faithfully, until it pleased him to give up my indentures.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="018559_0006_0FA7B078401CDAB8"/>
I still followed the occupation of a Mariner, and improved my education until I thought fit to take the command of a vessel. I have been through ma∣ny scenes of life, and always endeavoured to support the character of an honest man, and believe that I was harmless to any body but myself. It is need∣less for me to give an account how I spent my life; for I have been in many parts of the world, but never did any thing that would cause me to blush, or be ashamed, before I transacted this horrid crime that I am to suffer for.</P>
<P>If you desire to know what this temptation did arise from; with shame I will endeavour to in∣form you: At first when I met with Capt. White it was in <HI>Philadelphia.</HI> My money being almost spent, I agreed to go to <HI>Nova-Scotia</HI> with him. Accordingly we pursued our intended voyage as far as <HI>New-York,</HI> and there we took on board our cargo, and came to a place called <HI>Cow-Harber,</HI> in <HI>Long-Island,</HI> and there tarried some days, and took on board the passenger John Vail, and sailed quick∣ly from thence.</P>
<P>My mind being very uneasy on account of a young lady whom I proposed to marry, only the want of money prevented our being joined in the bands of Hymen. Being below her degree, and being ashamed to own my necessity, prolonged our being joined in wedlock. But love began to burn my poor and wounded heart; and being resolved to go through any difficulty that might impede us, I in∣tended to take the life of my fellow creature; one evening seeing a good opportunity, I took up an axe, and with it I struck Captain White overboard, and attempted to murder the passenger also; but
<PB N="8" REF="018559_0007_0FA7B07A65FA2B00"/>
when I found I could not accomplish my purpose surrendered myself a prisoner.</P>
<P>I was confined for some time. Towards morn∣ing we fell in with a vessel, which carried me into <HI>Plymouth</HI> as a prisoner, and remained for a con∣siderable time, which I spent in anguish, imploring mercy of God, for the crime I had committed. I was then sent to <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and condemned to die by my own confession: And, agreeable to my inclination (choosing rather to die than live.) Time would fail me to give a particular account of this affair; but this is the truth that I have set forth, which I declare as a dying man.</P>

<HEAD>The LIFE of JOHN SULLIVAN.</HEAD>
<P>I JOHN SULLIVAN, was born in <HI>Ireland</HI> in the town of <HI>Limrick;</HI> was eighteen years old last April.</P>
<P>I inlisted as a solder in the British service in the year 1777, and took 5 pounds bounty; the Captain's name was Thomas, in the 36th regiment. Went to <HI>Bristol,</HI> in order to join the army but deserted.</P>
<P>I then went to <HI>Wales</HI> with an intent to inlist the second time, but altered my mind, and entered on
<PB N="9" REF="018559_0008_0FA7B07A8DD81140"/>
board the <HI>Ceres</HI> frigate, in the king's service, bound to <HI>New-York:</HI> I staid on board near three weeks, and then deserted. I went to <HI>Long-Island,</HI> and there was pressed on board a Vessel, staid on board eleven weeks, and then deserted.</P>
<P>I entered on board a sloop bound to <HI>New-York▪</HI> but hauled in at <HI>Loyd's-Neck:</HI> When I landed I was discovered and pursued, by the Doctor of my former vessel; he was on horse-back, and drove me into the water, but I was oblidged to come on shore and surrender; I then received thirty-nine lashes.</P>
<P>The same night I deserted and swam to another vessel, commanded by one Kelley: the master and I combined together, and stole the vessel, carried her into <HI>Stonington</HI> and sold her: I received about three hundred dollars for my share.</P>
<P>From <HI>Stonington</HI> I went to <HI>New-London,</HI> and entered on board a privateer John Buckley com∣mander: I tarried on board three months; we took some prizes. I then entered on board another privateer, commanded by James Woodworth; after a month's cruise was taken by the British, and carried into <HI>New-York,</HI> and put on board the Guard-ship, where I remained three days, and then was put on board the <HI>Lesophe,</HI> where I remained eleven weeks: She came to <HI>Staten-Island,</HI> where I desert∣ed. I went from thence to <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inock,</HI> where I was hailed by a small party, and ordered to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: I had a firelock with me, and fired on them, but they took me prisoner, and carried me to <HI>Horse-Neck,</HI> where Col. Camfield commanded; the Col. examin∣ed me and gave me a pass to go to <HI>Stanford,</HI> where I became acquainted with Barrick, who is condemned to die with me.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="018559_0009_0FA7B07F70759BF0"/>
In August one thousand seven hundred and eighty two I happened to fall in company with a lad; he and I laid down to rest. After he got to sleep I searched his pockets, and stole one guinea and a crown. After this I entered on board a whale-boat with the person I stole from, we went a cruize and came into <HI>Stonington,</HI> where I was accused of stealing the guinea and crown, but denied it: They searched me and found the money tied up in the tail of my shirt; they cut off my shirt-tail and left me. I went to Col. Daverport and he gave me a pass to <HI>New-London.</HI> I there entered on board a pri∣vateer commanded by Isaac Warner. We went about eight days cruise, and by distress of weather got dismasted: Our vessel being a wreck, and enable to defend ourselves, we were taken by a British vessel and carried to <HI>Burmudas.</HI> I then engaged with the Captain who took me prisoner, to go to sea with him. I took twenty dollars bounty. I never went on board after I received the money and clothes, but rode off on my ten toes and left them.</P>
<P>I went about seven miles to a piece called <HI>Cole-Lane,</HI> and engaged to go on board a pri∣vateer, took twenty-four dollars from the Cap∣tain and then bid them good night. I next went to <HI>St. George's;</HI> there I entered on board another privateer, Captain Hall commander, and took twen∣ty-four dollars bounty, we went five weeks cruise and then returned to <HI>Burmudas.</HI> Being destitute of every thing, I endeavoured to help myself to that which Solomon says will answer all things; and knowing that one Gutherege kept a store there, I
<PB N="11" REF="018559_0010_0FA7B0878F5333D8"/>
took a partner with me and broke it open, where we found a barrel of dollars; we took our pockets and hats full, then went to a place called Salt Ket∣tles, and changed the silver for gold.</P>
<P>Three weeks after this I entered on board Captpunc; Vezey, bound to <HI>St. Thomas's:</HI>—Peace being pro∣claimed, I went to <HI>North Carloina.</HI> I went from thence to <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> where I went to work three weeks: then I and my partner broke open a store in the day time, and took out twenty-four half-joes and some silver; my comrade was taken up on sus∣picion and carried before a Justice, but made his escape; and as I was not suspected, was sent to catch him; I followed on until I overtook him, and he and I contrived the matter between us, that he gave me his shoes and buckels to carry and tell the injured people that I pursued him so close that he was obliged to drop his shoes and buckels, and for this piece of villainy they rewarded (what they falsely called) my fidelity with two dollars.</P>
<P>I then went to <HI>Baltimore</HI> and entered myself on board a pilot boat, a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> went to <HI>Philadelphia:</HI> I then entered myself on board a transport bound to <HI>Scot∣land.</HI> I suspected there was money on board, nor was my suspicion groundless, for I and one more found a chest, and breaking it open, took out 40 pounds, then made our escape to <HI>New-York.</HI></P>
<P>Soon after this I got a new comrade, and we broke open a shop, and took out the value of 100 pounds in money and watches. I then went to <HI>Newbury-Port,</HI> where I entered on board Capt Wheelwright, bound to the <HI>West-Indies.</HI> When I arrived there, I went into a trader's shop and took to the value of 40 pounds in goods. Soon after this
<PB N="12" REF="018559_0011_0FA7B08A9340D928"/>
I took another comrade, and walking out we met: a man in the road: We told him we wanted some money and some we would have; he gave us three crowns. I then returned to <HI>Boston.</HI></P>
<P>On Friday night before Commencement, Barrick and I went to <HI>Roxbury</HI> with an intent to rob any person, but we were disappointed. The next Mon∣day night we went upon the old errand, but no booty. Soon after this we went to <HI>Winter's-Hill,</HI> and there we fell in with one Mr. Baldwin, and robbed him of his watch and money. I took the watch out of Mr. Baldwin's pocket, but Poor (the fellow who turned States Evidence) was the man that abused and gave him heavy blows. For this last crime I am to suffer death.—These are the most capital crimes I have committed, and I sincerely wish that others may a∣void the rocks on which I have split.</P>
