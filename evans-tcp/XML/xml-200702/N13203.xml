<L>TO drive the kine, one summer's morn,</L>
<L>The TANNER took his way;</L>
<L>The Calf shall rue that is unborn</L>
<L>The jumbling of that day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And <HI>Wayne</HI> descending Steers shall know,</L>
<L>And tauntingly deride,</L>
<L>And call to mind in ev'ry low</L>
<L>The tanning of his hide.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet <HI>Bergen</HI> Cows still ruminate</L>
<L>Unconscious in the stall,</L>
<L>What mighty means were used to get</L>
<L>And lose them after all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="016697_0003_0F9D785662FC7390"/>
<L>For many heroes bold and brave</L>
<L>From <HI>New-Bridge</HI> and <HI>Tapaan,</HI></L>
<L>And those that drink <HI>Passaick</HI>'s wave,</L>
<L>And those that eat soupaan,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And sons of distant <HI>Delaware,</HI></L>
<L>And still remoter <HI>Shannon,</HI></L>

<L>Who had a pair of shoes?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At six the host, with sweating buss,</L>
<L>Arriv'd at Freedom's Pole,</L>
<L>When <HI>Wayne,</HI> who thought he'd time enough,</L>
<L>Thus speechified the whole:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O ye whom glory doth unite,</L>
<L>Who freedom's cause espouse,</L>

<L>Ere yet you tempt your further way,</L>

<L>Hear, soldiers, what I have to say,</L>
<L>And take a pint of rum;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Intemp'rate valour then will string</L>
<L>Each nervous arm the better,</L>
<L>So all the land shall IO sing,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Know that some paltry Refugees,</L>
<L>Whom I've a mind to fight,</L>

<L>That grow on yonder height.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Their sort and block-houses we'll level,</L>

<L>We'll drive the scoundrels to the devil,</L>
<L>And ravish wife and daughter.</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="016697_0005_0F9D7857E1230458"/>
<L>For well you know the latter is</L>
<L>The serious operation,</L>
<L>And fighting with the Refugees</L>
<L>Is only demonstration.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His daring words from all the crowd</L>
<L>Such great applause did gain,</L>
<L>That every man declar'd aloud</L>
<L>For serious work with <HI>Wayne.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then from the cask of rum once more</L>
<L>They took a heady gill,</L>
<L>When one and all they loudly swore</L>
<L>They'd fight upon the hill.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But here—the Muse has not a strain</L>
<L>Befitting such great deeds,—</L>
<L>Huzza, they cried, Huzza for <HI>Wayne,</HI></L>

<L>NEAR his meridian pomp the sun</L>
<L>Had journey'd from the hor'zon,</L>
<L>When fierce the dusky tribe mov'd on</L>
<L>Of heroes drunk as poison.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The sounds confus'd of boasting oaths</L>
<L>Re-echoed through the wood,</L>
<L>Some vow'd to sleep in dead men's cloathes,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>At <HI>Irvine</HI>'s nod 'twas fine to see</L>

<L>Let none uncandidly infer,</L>

<L>He left him what was better yet,</L>

<L>He left him for a quick retreat,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>To stay, unless he rul'd the sea,</L>
<L>He thought would not be right, Sir,</L>

<LG>
<L>Another cause with these combin'd</L>

<HEAD>ON THE AFFAIR BETWEEN THE REBEL GENERALS HOWE AND GADDESDEN, Written at <HI>Charlestown.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>IT was on Mr. <HI>Peroy</HI>'s land,</L>
<L>At Squire <HI>Rugeley</HI>'s corner,</L>
<L>Great H and G met, sword in hand,</L>
<L>Upon a point of honour.</L>
<L><HI>Yankee Doodle, doodle doo, &amp;c.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>G went before with Col'nel E</L>
<L>Together in a carriage,</L>
<L>On horseback followed H and P,</L>
<L>As if to steal a marriage.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On <HI>chosen</HI> ground they now alight,</L>
<L>For battle duly harness'd,</L>
<L>A <HI>shady</HI> place, and <HI>out</HI> of <HI>sight,</HI></L>
<L>It shew'd they were in <HI>earnest.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="24" REF="016697_0022_0F9D78A5E1DFD060"/>
<L>They met, and in the usual way,</L>
<L>With hat in hand saluted,</L>
<L>Which was, no doubt, to shew how they</L>
<L>Like <HI>Gentlemen</HI> disputed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And then they both together made</L>
<L>This honest declaration,</L>
<L>That they came there—by <HI>honor</HI> led,</L>
<L>But—not by <HI>inclination.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That if they fought, 'twas not because</L>
<L>Of rancour, spite or passion,</L>
<L>But only to obey the laws</L>
<L>Of custom and of fashion.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The pistols then, <HI>before their eyes,</HI></L>
<L>Were fairly prim'd and loaded!</L>
<L>H wish'd, and so did G likewise,</L>
<L>The custom was exploded!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But as they now had gone so far</L>
<L>In such a <HI>bloody business,</HI></L>
<L>For action straight they both prepare</L>
<L>With—mutual forgiveness.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="25" REF="016697_0023_0F9D78A734E634B0"/>
<L>But lest their courage should exceed</L>
<L>The bounds of moderation,</L>
<L>Between the seconds 'twas agreed</L>
<L>To fix them each a station.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The distance stepp'd by Colonel P,</L>
<L>'Twas only eight short paces,</L>
<L>Now, gentlemen, says Colonel P;</L>
<L>Be sure—to keep your places.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Quoth H to G—Sir, please to fire,</L>
<L>Quoth G—no, pray begin, Sir;</L>
<L>And, truly, one must needs admire</L>
<L>The temper they were in, Sir!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Well fire both at once, said he,</L>
<L>And so they both presented;</L>
<L>No answer was returned by G,</L>
<L>But silence, Sir, consented.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They <HI>paus'd</HI> awhile, these gallant foes,</L>
<L>By turns politely grinning,</L>
<L>Till after many cons and pros,</L>
<L>H made a <HI>brisk</HI> beginning.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="26" REF="016697_0024_0F9D78A760F9F888"/>
<L>He miss'd his <HI>mark,</HI> but not his <HI>aim;</HI></L>
<L>The shot was well directed;</L>
<L>It sav'd them both from <HI>hurt</HI> and <HI>shame</HI>;</L>
<L>What more could be expected!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then G, to shew he meant no harm,</L>
<L>But hated jars and jangles,</L>
<L>His pistol fired, across his arm,</L>
<L>From H—almost angles.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>H now was call'd upon by G</L>
<L>To fire another shot, Sir,</L>
<L>He <HI>smil'd,</HI> and—"after this" quoth he,</L>
<L>"No, truly, I cannot, Sir."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such honour did they both display,</L>
<L>They highly were commended;</L>
<L>And thus, in short, this gallant fray</L>
<L>Without mischance was ended.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No fresh dispute, we may suppose,</L>
<L>Will e'er by them be started,</L>
<L>For now the Chiefs, no longer foes,</L>
<L>Shook hands, and—so they parted.</L>

<P>THE masters of Reason have decided, that when doctrines and practices have been fairly examin∣ed, and proved to be contrary to Truth, and injurious to Society, then and not before may Ridicule be law∣fully employed in the service of Virtue.</P>
<P>This is exactly the case of the grand American Re∣bellion; it has been weighed in the balance, and found wanting: able writers have exposed its princi∣ples, its conduct, and its final aim. Reason has done her part, and therefore this is the legitimate moment for Satire.</P>
<P>Accordingly the following Piece is offered to the Public. What it is found to want of Genius, the Author cannot supply; what it may want of Correction, he hopes the candor of the Public will excuse on account of the fugitive nature of the subject: next year the publication would be too late; for in all probability there will then be no Congress existing.</P>

<L>WHEN Faction, pois'nous as the scorpion's sting,</L>
<L>Insects the people and insults the King:</L>
<L>When foul Sedition skulks no more conceal'd,</L>

<L>Suppose the right in Britain to be clear;</L>
<L>Britain was mad to exercise it here:</L>

<L>The Colonies were mad in arms to rise;</L>
<L>Impolitic, and open to abuse,</L>

<L>No need for furious demagogues to chase;</L>
<L>America was jealous, and was safe;</L>

<L>The presbyterian with the convict march'd,</L>

<L>This was not Reason—this was wildest rage,</L>
