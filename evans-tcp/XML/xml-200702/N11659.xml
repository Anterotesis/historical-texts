<P N="1">I. <HI>The importance of GOD's being for us.</HI></P>
<P>WE have, my dear Countrymen, entered into the most solemn, weighty, and extraordinary affair, that ever concerned <HI>America</HI>; an affair that will termi∣nate in our final ruin, unless GOD be for us.— We have though I trust with the greatest reluctance, taken up arms against the King of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> who is the most powerful prince in the known world, who has been a terror to all nations, who is the strongest by sea, and can command the greatest navy of any nation whatever; a great part of which is now employed in bringing soldiers, arms, ammu∣nition and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to <HI>America,</HI> with a determination to subdue us—have taken <HI>Boston,</HI> the metropolis of <HI>New-England</HI>—have made it a strong garrison to guard themselves—many first blocked in as priso∣ners—others obliged to leave their pleasant habita∣tions;—have burned <HI>Charlestown,</HI> a very fine and beautiful place, to ashes—caused the inhabitants to

<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ave their habitations in flames;—have proceeded <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rther—have burned <HI>Falmouth,</HI> a place of vast value—men, women, and children, in the greatest confusion and consternation, occasioned by the roar∣ing of their cannon, the devouring flames of their buildings—obliged to leave their dwellings in ru∣ins—have immediate orders to burn all the sea-ports from thence to <HI>Carolina</HI>—will certainly execute their cruel design, which in the issue will damage <HI>America</HI> not less than 50 millions of money. Now all this will certainly be effected, unless GOD be for us.—To have this great and mighty nation against us, and the great and dreadful GOD against us too, must be dreadful indeed! For if GOD be against us, all the victories we have already gained, will only serve to augment their fury, and bring all the power and force of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> on us, and perhaps joined with the strength of other nations.— If GOD be against us, all the wise consultations of assemblies and congresses will prove abortive, our armies will be defeated, our country will be ravaged, we shall be destroyed by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; the sword without, and terror within, will consume us—a fire will be enkindled in his anger, that will burn to the lowest hell— He will scatter us into corners—he will cause the remembrance of us to cease, and deliver us up to the greatest reproach—those that hate us will rule over us, and we shall be treated as the worst of rebels.—This will certainly be the fate of <HI>America,</HI> unless GOD be for us, and on our side.—Now, <HI>What shall we say to these things? If GOD be for us,
<PB N="4" REF="014737_0004_0F94DB52FB4F9030"/>
who can be against us?</HI> And if he be against us who can be for us, that is able to deliver us?</P>
<P>Shewing the way, and the only way for the delive∣rance of <HI>America</HI> from the most distressing calami∣ties that ever befel any people.</P>
<P>THUS we see, my dear friends and countrymen, that it is all-important that GOD be for us. Which brings us to consider, in the</P>
<P N="2">II. Place, <HI>What must absolutely be done on our part, that the blessed GOD may be for us.</HI></P>
<P>AND here, <HI>First,</HI> Was is Liberty that first caused the settlement of this country?—Was this land de∣signed by God himself for a land of liberty?—Was this the tenor and condition of the grant of this country from God to our forefathers, that no tyrant should ever reign here?—Is this the only thing the Americans are suing for?—Was it their assert∣ing their rights to this precious jewel, that has drawn the sword against us?—Is it liberty that has set the nation in such a terrible convulsion?—Then it will certainly appear, that all those laws, customs, and practices, that infringe on the liberties of man∣kind, and are repugnant to the law of God, must be done away. Every thing that has any tendency to bind the consciences of God's Children, of what name or denomination soever, must be done away. As we would have the Lord on our side, we must set at Liberty those vast numbers of <HI>Africans,</HI> which have so long time been inslaved by us, who have as good a right to Liberty as we have—We must no longer exercise that Cruelty and Barbarity towards
<PB N="5" REF="014737_0005_0F94DB53BA5BC608"/>
them, as we have heretofore done—We must put a final stop to all vexatious Law suits, and no longer exercise that Cruelty among ourselves that even heathens would not be found guilty of—We must for ever cease from this so ruinous a Practice—We must be kind and benevolent to the Poor—help and de∣liver them out of all their troubles and distresses— break every yoke, and every heavy burden, &amp; let the oppressed go free. See Isa. 58, 7, and on—We must be sincere in our endeavors for Liberty, without a∣ny wicked or avaricious ends or designs for riches or honours to aggrandize ourselves or children— We must faithfully improve all our spiritual privi∣leges, and prize them above every thing else—We must have as much zeal to improve them as we have to contend for them, and then the Lord will never suffer them to be taken from us.—We must heartily ascribe the glory of all the victories obtain∣ed by us, to GOD alone; and go, if called to it, against our enemies, as King <HI>David</HI> went against <HI>Goliah,</HI> in the name and strength of the LORD GOD of Israel—We must continue that union and unani∣mity that subsists between the colonies, and unite, as one man, in putting away all those sins and abo∣minations which is the cause of God's controversy with us,—and continue to humble our selves in the united public manner as was once appointed by the Grand Continental Congress; which was the most extraordinary affair that ever happened in America: since which time we have been wonderfully defend∣ed; and we have the greatest incouragement to take this method for deliverance, whenever thought pro∣per
<PB N="6" REF="014737_0006_0F94DB5479BDDC40"/>
by those wise Men who are set at the helm of affairs, and are appointed guardians for the seve∣ral Colonies—We must break off all our sins by righteousness, and our iniquities by shewing mercy to the Poor;—then God will be for us, and all the powers of Earth and Hell will never deprive us of those privileges. Now, <HI>What shall we say to these things? If GOD be for us, who can be against us?</HI> If GOD be for us, he can easily defeat the cruel de∣signs of our enemies many ways: He can raise a tempest in the sea, that shall toss their shipping to the heavens, and bury them in the depths, and hurl them back from whence they came, or to some other remote part of the earth, or dash them one against another, or against some unseen reef in the sea, and sink them to the bottom. He can defeat them by sending sickness among them, and destroy them by the pestilence, or by sending faintness into their hearts, or granting us the victory if engaged in bat∣tle. He that sits at the helm of all the affairs of the universe, and rules in the court of heaven above, can so over-rule things in the court of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> as to cause all those cruel acts to be nullified, their shipping and armies recalled, our seaports all open∣ed, <HI>Boston</HI> and other places all restored to their pro∣per owners, the great breach healed, that ancient union restored, and the Americans put into the possession of all their rights on a lasting foundation.</P>
<P>THUS we see, my dear friends and countrymen, how many ways the blessed GOD may interpose in our behalf—the last of which is to be the most de∣sired by every American; for it seems a pity the
<PB N="7" REF="014737_0007_0F94DB553A7948B8"/>
<HI>English</HI> nation should be broke like a potter's vessel; the nation whom God has exalted to heaven—in which has been more of the glory of God to be seen, than in all the nations in the world besides—the nation whom God has exalted to such glory, honor and dignity.—O Britons! why wilt thou ruin thy self, rip out thine own bowels, run the sword into thine own heart, undo thy self and thy most obe∣dient children, the most loyal subjects in all thy vast dominions! Why shouldest thou, who hast been the glory of all nations, become the reproach to all nations! Why wilt thou do that which will provoke God to cast off the nation forever, and withhold his glory forever! Thou who hast been the admiration of all foreigners for thy most excellent constitution, and hast excelled all nations for thy kindness and hospitality, even to strangers! Witness the vast num∣bers of French and others in the City of London, from all parts of the world—distressed strangers and foreigners have been receiv'd with the greatest kindness and indulgence.—Great numbers of French and others have been naturalized and permitted to set up trade in the city of London, and have grown very rich thereby, by the unexampled beauty of the na∣tives; for hither they came destitute of every thing, and by public and private charity were put into a way to provide for themselves and families. From the Revolution to this time, fifteen or twenty thousand pounds has been paid to them annually by authori∣ty, towards supporting their poor. Now who could have thought the nation that has been so full of kindness and benevolence to strangers, could become
<PB N="8" REF="014737_0008_0F94DB55FA657680"/>
so cruel to their own Children? Who could have thought a few years past, that saw the English nation in her meridian glory—that saw the universities in England, Oxford and Cambridge, which consisted of near 40 Colleges, out of which proceeded swarms of the best men who have appeared most eminent both in Church and state—that saw the present King ascending the throne to sway the British scepter —that saw the Proclamations issued forth from un∣der his royal hand and seal, discountenancing vice and immorality, and encouraging virtue and true religion. Who was there, 20 years past, that be∣held the harmony that subsisted between Britain and her Colonies—that saw the wide Atlantick full of vessels laden with effects from America, bound to our native country—who could have thought, I say, that all the powers of Earth and Hell could have produced so sudden an alteration, as to see the same ocean full of shipping from our mother coun∣try, bound to America, laden with soldiers, arms and ammunition, and all manner of instruments of death and cruelty, to destroy her own Children! Who could have thought a little detestable Tea, thrown into the ocean by a factious mob, should be the cause of an ocean of bloodshed, and forever dissolve that union that was worth more Tea than the East-Indies produced? How much below the dignity of the nation are those severe proceedings? Consider, whilst thou art pouring out thy hot thun∣der bolts on the Americans, what thou art doing, lest the Almighty God pour out his wrath on thee for every drop of Blood shed in this unnatural con∣troversy,
<PB N="9" REF="014737_0009_0F94DB56B9D48508"/>
binds the curse of GOD on the nation, and will provoke GOD to leave it, and forever withdraw his glory from it never more to return, as he has from other nations and kingdoms. Methinks the words of the Prophet are applicable here, <HI>O thou sword of the Lord, how long will it be, ere thou wilt be quiet? Put up thyself into thy scabbard, rest and be still</HI>—or turn thyself against some avowed enemy, not thy best friends: And those of our Saviour, when he wept over the city of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> saying, <HI>O Jerusalem! hadst thou but known in this thy day the things that belong to thy peace; but now they are hid from thine eyes!</HI> And, <HI>O Jerusalem! Jerusalem! how often would I have gathered thee, as a hen gather∣eth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!</HI> And as in <HI>Hosea</HI> 9. 8. <HI>How shall I give thee up, Ephraim! How shall I deliver thee, Israel! How shall I make thee as Admah! How shall I set thee as Zeboim! My heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together!—How shall I leave the nation whom I have taken into such a near relation to myself, and made comely thro' my comeliness; which I have put upon high! Must I leave her, as I have other nations and places!</HI>—How shall I forsake <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> as I have left <HI>Jerusalem!—Go ye now into my place which was at Shiloh, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.</HI>—Go ye thro'out all the eastern parts of the world, where they were once illuminated with the light of the glorious gospel, and see how they are overwhelmed with ignorance, superstitions and heresies—What I have done to the seven churches of <HI>Asia</HI>—Look into <HI>Africa</HI>—time
<PB N="10" REF="014737_0010_0F94DB577AD02AE8"/>
was when there were thousands of glorious churches there—Into <HI>Europe,</HI> and see from how many places GOD has removed his glory.—There was once in <HI>Rome</HI> itself a glorious church.—Look into <HI>Spain,</HI> and the <HI>Spanish</HI> low countries, which had once the glorious gospel in them; but how has the bloody inquisition extinguished the light of the glorious gospel in that unhappy kingdom!—Into <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and see now where is their glory?—Into <HI>Hungary,</HI> and the great kingdom of <HI>France</HI>; how has their wickedness provoked God to leave that unhappy kingdom!—Time was when there were hundreds of protestant ministers and churches there; but how has a <HI>Babylonish</HI> king made them an empty vessel, swallowed them up like a dragon, and cast them out! And now, must <HI>Great-Britain</HI> share the same fate? Must <HI>Great-Britain</HI> come to nothing, to destruction and dissolution? for this is the certain fate of every kingdom divided against itself.—<HI>O that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, then would I weep day and night for the ruin of the</HI> English nation.—Is there no way to prevent this ruin?— Is there no balm in <HI>Gilead</HI>? no physician there, for the healing this deadly wound?—Why wilt thou not hold out terms for reconciliation, and let the breach be healed?</P>
<P>O <HI>America!</HI> what is the cause of GOD's contro∣versy with thee?—What hast thou done, that has provoked GOD to write his displeasure against thee in such bloody and fiery corrections?—Canst thou behold all the misery that is come on thee, and im∣magine thou hast done nothing to offend a holy,
<PB N="11" REF="014737_0011_0F94DB5839D3E8C8"/>
just, and righteous GOD?—Canst thou cast thine eye upon thy seaports, from <HI>Falmouth</HI> to <HI>Carolina,</HI> and see the ocean full of engines of death, destined for the destruction of <HI>America</HI>—look into <HI>Boston,</HI> that fine metropolis—view it taken out of the hands of the proper owners—look into those fine and beautiful houses, once devoted to the worship and service of GOD, once filled with his glorious presence, now turned play-houses and riding-houses, places, to furnish their horse for our destruction!—Who was there that saw the burning <HI>Charlestown</HI>—that saw the flames ascending from the lofty steeples of those beautiful buildings, once devoted to the wor∣ship of the great GOD;—I say, to see the flames as∣cending to the heavens—to hear the cracking and falling of the buildings—that heard the roaring of the cannon—the cries and groans of the wounded, they wallowing in their blood—the dead lying in heaps—look into <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and see those colleges, which were once seminaries of learning, places to fit and train up persons for the most sacred work of the gospel ministry, and to be physicians for wounded immortal souls—I say, shall we see those colleges, that were once consecrated to this sacred and impor∣tant business, now turned into hospitals, full of wounded bodies, and not suspect something has been amiss in those colleges?—See the ruin that has come on those churches, and not suppose there are things introduced contrary to the word of GOD, and very provoking to him?—Methinks we can have no greater precedent of the wrath of Almighty GOD, than these things are. Surely we can have no grea∣ter
<PB N="12" REF="014737_0012_0F94DB58F989BC80"/>
evidence that our sins have reached to heaven, and cry for vengeance upon us; and that he will not be for us, but against us, unless we turn to him by unfeigned repentance: For so long as we hold fast our sins, and retain our iniquities, and do not turn to GOD, do not regard the works of the LORD, nor the operation of his hands, notwithstanding he has been speaking to us by terrible things in righ∣teousness—been threatning us with drought and sore sickness—taking away many by death;—and now, add to all this the withdrawing of GOD's holy Spi∣rit—suspence of divine influence—hardness of heart —blindness of mind;—Now, all these together, makes it very evident there never was a people nigher the brink of final ruin than we are; and as long as we continue in this careless, stupid, and indifferent state, we declare by our practice, we have not done amiss, our ways are equal, we have not done any thing to merit those evils from the hand of the Lord. We answer by our practice, as <HI>Pharaoh</HI> answered <HI>Moses, Who is the Lord, that we should obey him?</HI>— By this means we reflect infinite dishonor on the wise Governor of the universe, for punishing an in∣nocent people. And here arises the controversy be∣tween the great GOD and us—just as when a kind father corrects a rebellious child, his aim is to bring him to obedience, and to his duty; now if the child is regardless of his father's corrections, and will not turn for the stripes his father gives him, there is an absolute necessity for a more severe correction;— and if he will not finally turn, he casts him off as a rebel, and lets him go on, and fill up the measure
<PB N="13" REF="014737_0013_0F94DB59BB11C3E0"/>
of his cup: But if the child turns to his father, and to his obedience, the father's heart is full of pity, his bowels yearn with compassion, his arms are open to receive him, and treat him with the most parental affection.—Just so the blessed GOD has for many years been dealing with <HI>America</HI>—he has been ma∣nifesting his sore displeasure against us—he has been most severely correcting us—his stripes have been most severely laid upon us.—Now, if we still go on, and will not remove the cause of his controversy, there is a necessity of his stripes being laid on more severe; for GOD never began a controversy with any people, that ever ended in any thing short of their reformation or final ruin. And this is the case with us. If we turn to GOD, put away those laws, customs and practices, those sins and abominations that are the cause of his controversy, and turn to him by unfeigned repentance, take his word for our rule, shake the dust from off our bibles, and let this be the compass to steer our course by, and walk so that our ways please the LORD; our calamities will soon cease, our enemies will be at peace with us, the great and eternal GOD will be for us and on our side. 'Tis in this way, and no other, that we can have the LORD for us. Thus it was when God punished <HI>Israel</HI> with three years famine, king <HI>David</HI> was very solicitous to know the cause of GOD's anger; and no sooner had he found out, and done as the LORD required in this matter, the heavens could no longer withhold the rain, the earth was replenished, and bro't forth her fruit. So it was with <HI>Joshua,</HI> after his defeat at <HI>Ai.</HI> The next step he takes, is to
<PB N="14" REF="014737_0014_0F94DB5A7997B6A0"/>
search after the cause of GOD's anger; and as soon as he had put the accused thing out of the camp, GOD was for him, and with him, and his enemies could not stand before him. In like manner, when the mariners had taken <HI>Jonah</HI> into their ship, it cau∣sed a terrible storm in the sea, which mounted her to the heavens, and buried her in the depths, and filled them with dreadful distress; they were very solicitous to know the cause of GOD's anger, and as soon as they had thrown <HI>Jonah</HI> overboard, the sea was a perfect calm.—So it would be with <HI>America</HI>— Could we find out the cause, and throw the <HI>Jonah</HI> overboard, the nation would be in a perfect calm, and GOD will certainly be for us, and on our side.</P>
<P>Which brings us to the</P>
<P N="3">III. And last thing proposed; that is, to shew <HI>How blessed we shall be if the blessed</HI> GOD <HI>be for us.</HI></P>
<P>AND now, <HI>What shall we say to these things?—If God be for us, who can be against us?</HI>—He will be a wall of fire round about us, and the glory in the midst of us:—He will defend us from all the insults of men or devils.—All those wise and good men, who are at the helm of affairs, and are appointed guardians for the colonies, if they are instrumental of a thorough and universal reformation, will shine as lights in the world; their memories will be dear and precious to the latest posterity; and they will not only shine in this world, but in the world to come, in the kingdom of glory, as stars of the first magni∣tude—Those churches in this land will be favored with the divine presence and glory of GOD—We shall be blessed in our basket and store, in our goings
<PB N="15" REF="014737_0015_0F94DB5B396AAB60"/>
out and comings in—We shall no longer hear the sound of the trumpet, or alarm of war, nor see garments rolled in blood—those instruments of cruelty shall be turned into the harmless utensils of husbandry—We shall be blessed with both peace and plenty—a foundation will be laid to enjoy them to the latest posterity—our root shall be spread by the waters, and the dew shall lie on our branches— We shall enjoy all those privileges that CHRIST has purchased for us, and which we have in consequence of that eternal covenant that was made between God the Father and God the Son; which covenant was ratified in the counsel of his eternal peace and was fulfilled when he shed his precious blood on the cross; through which channel flows every mercy and every favor that ever any of the human race ever did or ever will enjoy; for all was lost by the fall and apostacy of our first head and representative, and all was purchased by our second; and in this sense, and this only, he is said to be the Saviour of all men.—Now, if GOD be for us, all those mercies will as naturally flow to us, as the rivers flow into the sea.—Now, <HI>What shall we say to these things?— If GOD be for us, who can be against us?</HI>—Surely, if GOD be for us, we need not apply to <HI>France, Spain,</HI> or <HI>Prussia,</HI> for protection; for the blessed GOD will protect us.</P>
<P>THUS we have considered the importance of having GOD for us—We considered what must absolutely be done, that GOD may be for us— And likewise, how blessed it will be to have GOD for us.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="014737_0016_0F94DB5BF91E7790"/>AND now, my dear friends and countrymen, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we are all concerned in this most solemn affair, how highly does it become us, to endeavor to remove every impediment that hinders GOD's being for us, and on our side!</P>
