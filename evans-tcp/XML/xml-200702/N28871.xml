<HEAD>THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE most celebrated writers of former a∣ges have happily illustrated and re∣commended interesting and important truths by allegory, or fable; and by their agreeable manner in the figurative style, have ever been highly acceptable. Through those silvery channels, essential truths have been propitious∣ly conveyed, which were very unlikely to have been otherwise so cordially entertained. As such a method of writing hath always prov∣ed both pleasing and instructive, it is highly probable it will be continued in practice thro' succeeding ages. The introduction of imag∣inary beings hath, perhaps some degree of propriety in the scenes presented in the fol∣lowing memoirs, which are laid in those re∣gions where the most stupendous fabulous le∣gends originated. If fable hath been hither∣to so successfully employed (as both sacred and profane history appear to evince) for the instruction and entertainment of mankind;—if trees have been summoned to speak; the floods to lift up their voice; and the various orders of inferior existences, in language in∣telligible, to rebuke and reform;—if a proph∣et's madness hath been corrected by a moral lesson from his insulted beast; the vicious and cruel reprehended and reclaimed by talking birds and singing trees; why may not adole∣sence, or even riper years, be still in like man∣ner disciplined? Doth the mighty Hercules come forward, in ancient story, with his tre∣mentous
<PB N="4" REF="038495_0003_10122C62CC1AF408"/>
club, to arrest the progress of those baleful monsters which disturbed the peace of society; why shall not a Prince of China, in a later age, advance upon the theatre of the world, though with less formidable weapons than was that of the redoubtable hero;—with victorious eloquence and alluring manners to correct and reform the rash▪ and untutored, and restore the hapless wanderer to the paths of true virtue and honor, and consequent fe∣licity; and, having atchieved the most illustri∣ous exploits, establish a grand society cement∣ed by love? As then, the design of fable is agreeably to convey the most salutary truths that they may be effectually impressed upon the minds of those readers who are apt to be disgusted with dry treatises of morality; let it still be permitted to lend its benevolent aid for our entertainment and instruction, till the expected aera fully arrives when genuine un∣mixed truth shall shine forth with charms su∣perceding the necessity of the fascinating blan∣dishments of fictitious tales. However, the works of imagination, when subservient to rea∣son and virtue, will never fail to be admired.</P>
<P>The Author of the subsequent Memoirs looks for no other commendation than that which is merited by an honest attempt to ad∣vance, to the utmost of his slender abilities, the real felicity of his country and mankind. He thinks of his talent at composition as far be∣low those of the worthy and excellent writers of
<PB N="5" REF="038495_0004_10122C64E2B72178"/>
an age highly improved, and advancing in per∣fection before unknown; an age prégnant with great, and he hopes, happy events. His country may well boast the literary produc∣tions of eminent essayists of both sexes: and, to the rising generation, it is indeed a most in∣teresting circumstance, that female literary merit hath presented so brilliant an addition to our national glory.—Happy talents, Constan∣tia, are confessedly thine! How sweetly pleads thy pen in virtue's sacred cause! with sentiments ennobling, pathetic and sublime, winning each selfish heart to charity and love! Columbia's sons and daughters, whose virtues are her glo∣ry, shall never cease to bless thee! future ages shall grateful own thy worth; and say, An∣gels would write like thee! Had mines of gold been thine; and hadst thou, with the generous patriotism thou hast so eloquently commended, dispensed them for the public weal; they had been but trifles, when com∣pared with the rich, invaluable presents<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The GLEANER, in three volumes, whose uncom∣mon merits, the numerous and respectable subscribers of all ranks, most expressively proclaim.</NOTE> thou hast made to thy country! Who can refrain from noblest deeds of charity, when Constan∣tia solicits with softest moving accents;—when, with eloquence inimitably charming, angelic, she intreats! when, with richest and most expres∣sive
<PB N="6" REF="038495_0005_10122C67D2A164D8"/>
colouring, she presents the lovely por∣trait of philanthropy divine; or, with the re∣sistless magic power of her feathery wand, she calls forth every tender, every generous em∣otion of the soul! ever memorable will be the conquests of thy powerful rhetoric! The most obdurate hath it melted to compassion. Even the heart of the churlish niggard hath learned of thee to feel the sympathetic glow! The self-destroying children of intemperance have thy persuasive pages awakened to sobriety and frugality! Painful were their efforts against vicious habits long indulged. But it is thou who hast taught them to realise the momen∣tous consequence of speedy reform. 'Tis thou who inspiredst them with augmented fortitude, from the full conviction, that the more painful their virtuous struggles, the more glorious their victory would prove, and the more exquisitely relished the ensuing bliss! It is thou, too, who hast dignified thy sex. To thee is it highly indebted for thy excel∣lent vindication of its rights, ascertaining its importance, and celebrating its shining vir∣tues. If thou art still an inhabitant of the earth, long mayst thou, live illustrious amid thy worthy competitors for Heaven—approving fame, who with thee adorn and enrich our country and mankind! Happy American States! so richly adorned with sons and daugh∣ters of refined genius and exalted virtue! happy in thy illustrious chiefs, statesmen and
<PB N="7" REF="038495_0006_10122C69E78E9258"/>
legislators, whose fame resounds through eve∣ry region of the globe! in thy civil and re∣ligious liberties, and the means of every valu∣able improvement! happy in thy rich and powerful resources! firm and unshaken be thy union, and impervious to every violence! and by thy growing exemplary virtues, accelerate the destined day of universal harmony and love. Be thine the glory of exhibiting to na∣tions the value of freedom; and of all those graces and virtues which constitute the true dignity and happiness of man!</P>
<P>The Author hath attempted under the guise of amusement, to instill those active principles of piety, virtue and benevolence, which never fail of insuring, to all who are influenced by them, the real and the most exquisite enjoy∣ment of life;—those principles which are the only and sure foundation of civil, social and domestic felicity. It is his hearty wish that thousands of pens, and every tongue of e∣oquence may be incessantly employed (co∣operating with the brightest examples) in ac∣celerating the expected aera of universal hap∣piness, when the sigh of misery shall forever cease from the habitations of men.—A just a∣tention to the Deity, and a general convic∣tion, among all ranks, of our miserable ig∣norance and incapacity, as to the true enjoy∣ment of existence; and application to Hea∣ven, with unreserved confidence in his pow∣er and goodness, love and tender compassion,
<PB N="8" REF="038495_0007_10122C6B76C7DD60"/>
precedes and introduces the happy period which every heart desires, when darkness and fears, ter∣rors and distress shall be no more. I said unreser∣ved confidence in Heaven. For the want of this—so unbecoming and shameful to a rational being, is the source of every evil. Destitute of this confidence, what a wretched existence is man's! O happy country! where, even a∣mong the most influential, sentiments, so mo∣mentous, are realised!</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN that charming season of the year, when smil∣ing nature dressed in all its loveliness, presents the most enchanting scenes;—the philosophic and contemplative Nytan, Prince of China, had retired with several select friends, whose minds were con∣genial with his own, that they might enjoy the lux∣uries of spring, in a delightful retreat he had form∣ed a few miles from the metropolis. It was a re∣cess romantically situated, almost encompassed by rocky precipices and woods, and a very high wall extending to the sea shore. His building was con∣structed in the most elegant rural taste, containing a variety of beautiful and well furnished apartments. It was situated on a gradually rising ground, pre∣senting from its windows the most delightful and picturesque scenes; not in the least, incommoded by a number of trees nearly adjoining, which tow∣ered gay and majestic, and whose wide spreading branches, tempering the sun's meridian rays, waved over the lofty roofs. Among those select friends were his amiable sisters, with each a friend of their own sex, beautiful and highly accomplished, possessed of congenial minds, exalted by nature, and refined by education. Here they enjoyed alternately the sub∣lime pleasure of social converse, study, and contem∣plation—sometimes in delicious walks; at others,
<PB N="10" REF="038495_0009_10122C70F16CF440"/>
reclined in some chosen spot on the soft and verdant turf; or viewing the diversified scenes from an ele∣vated rock amid the sportive lambs. All the pleas∣ing variety of feathered songsters seemed to be here. collected on purpose to regale them with their spright∣ly and animated notes. Philosophic and elevated minds, like theirs, could not fail of enjoying the pleasures of so romantic and charming a recess with the most exquisite relish.</P>
<P>The Emperor and Empress sometimes graced this lovely retreat with their presence; which fail∣ed not to yield an highly augmented addition to its pleasures. Here their beloved and affectionate daughters were happy indeed. In the company of their fond brother, and two worthy Mandarins, his most endeared friends, and who had gained the hearts of the two sisters by the most tenderest assiduities. They were nearly arrived to that age when every charm expands. Their minds formed with native genius and worth were greatly improved by study and reflection, and every parental and fraternal attention. Happy lovers! sanctioned as such by the parents and relatives of each party, to enjoy, in this undisturbed seclusion from the cares of life, and the hurry of business, the soothing, the enrapturing con∣verse of the fair mistresses of their affections, to aid their studies in the various branches of litera∣ture they were delightfully exploring! Sweetly glid∣ed on the golden hours; and every succeeding sun arose to present them with new pleasures! What matter of deep regret that such felicity should be interrupted by any adverse occurrence! yet such was the appointed destiny. The Prince was sum∣moned, one day, from this delicious retirement, to at∣tend his father at court. He took leave of the little in∣chanting assembly, with the promise of a speedy re∣turn. But it was a promise which Heaven had de∣creed
<PB N="11" REF="038495_0010_10122C72857775B8"/>
should never be fulfilled. A long, an afflict∣ing separation that moment commenced from the dearest friends of his tender and affectionate heart. He had but lately returned from an important tour through the Empire; and had flattered himself with the sublimest enjoyments of the vernal season with those friends, in a temporary seclusion from the rest of the world. The iniquitous cause of his being curtailed of those enjoyments, and the surprising succeeding events, I proceed to unfold.</P>
<P>RENIEN had reigned till this eventful period, one of the happiest sovereigns that ever adorned the il∣lustrious throne of the vast empire of China. Bless∣ed in the love and esteem of his subjects, possessed of consummate wisdom and prudence, a tender and generous heart, his virtues diffused serenity and fe∣licity every where around him. Through nations, far and near, his fame was celebrated for innumer∣able great and good actions. The miseries of pov∣erty and oppression were scarcely known, in China, in his propitious days:—Propitious tranquil and serene,—till now—towards the close of his life (for no earthly bliss is alloted unexceptionably perfect;) when the secret ambitious and too successful ma∣chinations of Sanden one of his chief minsisters, be∣gan to disturb his repose, threatening the convul∣sion and disorganization of the Empire. The cha∣racter and growing virtues of his only son, Prince Nytan, were too much for the envious heart of that minister to endure? who, however specious his ap∣pearances, was an inveterate enemy to the good, and, it was by the profoundest dissimulation only, that he had maintained his place at court, or any degree of respect among mankind. He therefore employed every wicked art to fix an indelible stain of the deep∣est hue upon the reputation of the Prince,—to blast the fairest character for loyalty, virtue and probity;
<PB N="12" REF="038495_0011_10122C7414186CA8"/>
and to effect a period to those wise and benevolent schemes for the public weal, in the forming and prosecution of which, the son acted in concert with his royal parent. "If, said the plotting Sanden to himself, I can accomplish the disgrace of the Prince and his adherents—if I can procure them to be ex∣iled, if not destroyed; as the Emperor is now in the decline of life, and numbers are opposed to his virtues and political views, who will unite with me in the perfecting my designs; I shall soon be in a fair way of obtaining the sovereign power, and en∣joying pleasures uncontrouled." To accomplish his black scheme of villainy, whilst the prince was absent on his tour, (which was near fourteen months) he had secretly promoted an insurrection in a dis∣tant part of the empire, and had laid his plans so successfully, as to render it, an indubitable fact to millions, that the Prince was its chief promoter;—that he had persuaded many of great influence to dis∣affect the minds of the people towards the Emper∣or, as imposed on by intriguing courtiers, who were aiming under the mask of friendship, at a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> rev∣olution, This scheme so far succeeded that the Em∣peror issued orders to apprehend his son: and his being sent for to court was only a trick of Sanden's, to effect his confinement without alarming his faith∣ful and powerful friends in the recess; who there waited, indeed, a long time, with the utmost im∣patience, for his promised return! Before he had reached Pekin, he was seized by Sanden's soldiers, and hurried away to an old castle on the sea coasts, amidst craggy rocks, and gloomy woods; a place wholly at the disposal and command of that wicked minister, as were its gloomy inhabitants of fiends and murderers. Such were the effects of the cai∣tiff's calumnious lies.—Vile slanderer! Inhuman perpetrator of the foulest mischief! Ingrateful mur∣derer
<PB N="13" REF="038495_0012_10122C767AE32648"/>
of the purest fame, and betrayer of innocence the most spotless and perfect! What dreadful pun∣ishment can atone for thy unparralelled outrage to virtue and friendship, loyalty and patriotism! A slanderer—an incendiary—a traitor and betrayer.—What character can be deemed more infamous, more pernicious than thine; the slanderer is indeed the worst of murderers. He over whelms the universe with mischiefs and deaths! He is an assasssin who stabs in the dark; who destroys his neighbour's peace and felicity by depriving him of his good name, of his affectionate friends, far dearer to him than life: and yet vile and pernicious as is the cha∣racter of a slanderer, how many thousands are there, in regions called civilized, to whom it may be too justly imputed; and in which the defamer is every where heard, and the tongues of mischief are per∣petually fomenting discord in every family, in eve∣ry society. Are they the sons of reason, are they reflecting beings, who, professing the greatest of virtues, are guilty of the worst of vices, and▪ like Sanden, with specious pretentions to real goodness, are undermining the friends of virtue, and the sav∣iours of mankind, that vice, anarchy and ruin may reign triumphant! Ah! barbarous destroyer of the peace and felicity of thy unsuspecting friends! Such offences as thine are indeed of the blackest hue! but vengeance, just vengeance pursues thee! dread darkness and dire despair are on the way to arrest thee, and thy enormous crimes shall affright and torture thy guilty soul!</P>
<P>Too often does it happen that the wise are fatal∣ly deceived—the wise the generous and the good—by the specious the insidious friend. It is a les∣son of momentous instruction! It should rouse us to be more effectually on our guard; and it should
<PB N="14" REF="038495_0013_10122C7927AB0F50"/>
likewise instruct us to be more constantly dependent on the heavenly power. It is not in vain that we are suffered to feel the cruel effects of deception, of fallacious friendship. They are designed to ren∣der us more invariably sensible where our safety lies, to attach us more firmly to the celestial, the all-powerful the unchangeable FRIEND.—O happy expected age of perfection! when the great and the wise shall confide, unreservedly, in the source of wisdom, and nations rest on the Almighty arm!</P>
<P>The solitary situation, of the Castle in which the Prince was confined, was well adapted to the trai∣tor's infamous design. No habitations were adja∣cent to it, only a few miserable huts of miserable inhabitants; and the frightful reports of its being occupied by evil spirits, deterred the poor wretches, oppressed as they were by Sanden (on whose lands they but barely existed) as well as many others, from invading its precincts, or advancing under its moul∣dering walls. In this dreary building was the Prince immured, in a small paltry detached cham∣ber, with a boy only to attend him. An oath was imposed on him not to stir from his chamber but by special leave from the Emperor, and not to at∣tempt an escape from his prison. For his enemies were sensible that their strongest guards, and wisest precautions might possibly be defeated. The boy, who was devoted to Sanden, and bribed very high, was to sleep with him for greater security. A guard, likewise, was stationed, and strongly interested to prevent the prisoner's rescue, though his oath was sufficient security, with whom it was truly sac∣red and inviolable, though imposed against rea∣son and humanity. Yet all these precautions failed to compose the fearful and guilty mind of Sanden A wicked magician had taught the minister his en∣chantments; by the power of which he imagined
<PB N="15" REF="038495_0014_10122C7B41B368D8"/>
he had rendered the castle inaccessible to all but his depraved minions, and the Prince's confinement most effectual against any art or stratagems of his own. The Prince however, was far superior to him in magic skill; though he disdained the use of it to dishonorable purposes.—But thus it ever is with the wicked, guilty mind. Fearful and mis∣trustful, it calls in every aid, to impose on itself; adding guilt to guilt, crime to crime, outrage to out∣rage; it enlarges the structure of its villainies; till the pondrous load, unable to support itself on its iniquitous basis falls, and crushes the builder in its ruin!—</P>
<P>[The historians of <HI>Xuntien,</HI> who wrote Memoirs of <HI>Ravenzer,</HI> (the nation celebrated in the following books;) do indeed give a different account of the Prince's misfortune, and of the great events that followed it: One asserting that he was immediate∣ly banished to a desolate island; where, finding a few men who had been shipwrecked, he united with them and a great number of his countrymen who fol∣lowed his fortune, in forming a government for themselves. By this historian a variety of matters are related respecting the island and its inhabitants, and events there in the course of a hundred and nine∣ty years, when the inhabitants were increased to three hundred thousand. Nothing is said of the wonder∣ful magical operations, or of the Prince's inter∣course with a superior order of beings. It is only remarked, that the Prince, in his earlier years, was fascinated by the charms of <HI>occult science,</HI> and the conversation of magicians; but that he, after∣wards, thought very differently of these men, and their art, which may be indeed a state of the matter nearest to probability. <HI>Zerrinn</HI> asserts that the Prince held converse with, and was directed by Angels; and places the epoch of his existence many ages
<PB N="16" REF="038495_0015_10122C7CF9AC6F50"/>
back from that in which he is said to have lived by the Historian of China, <HI>Reshang,</HI> whom in the se∣quel, I chiefly follow; as he is more particular on interesting events, more entertaining, moral and sentimental: and his <HI>Genuis</HI> and <HI>Fairies</HI> (which we denominate <HI>Angels,</HI>) were incessantly employed in the works of benevolence; and, on that account, must be pleasing to every benevolent mind. With Reshang, then I shall proceed in composing the sub∣sequent Memoirs; though not without sometimes regarding the other writers; especially <HI>Long shang,</HI> who asserts, that the guardian Fairies and Genies, (or rather Angels,) of the Prince, indulged him a∣while in his fancied magical advantages; as though he thereby accomplished his enlargement from the castle, and many great things, which were in reality effected by them for benevolent purposes to man∣kind: But they afterwards undeceived him, con∣firming him in dependence on the Deity, for every aid and valuable gift.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>If <HI>Reshang,</HI> through the incredible marvellous, in∣troduces us to a grand society of the truly virtuous, to a flourishing nation, influenced by the most liberal and di∣vine sentiments; our entertainment will be sublime and interesting, our philanthropy instructed, and our devo∣tion rightly directed. From the fable we shall derive truth; and from the illustrious examples, an heavenly ambition to excel in every thing worthy of praise, and productive of felicity the most refined, exalted and permanent.</P>
<P>Since the tales of fiction are so greatly multiplied, so entertaining, and with such avidity perused; I would ren∣der them as harmless and useful as possible; and by pre∣senting, in the most engaging view, the moral of every one, guard the mind of the reader, while he is travelling through the regions of fancy, into the world of realities. In this manner escorted, he will attend me through the ensuing pages.</P></NOTE> But to resume the story of the Prince's confinement.]</P>
<P>—Thus he seemed to be effectually secured in his little chamber; where, too, he was liable to suffer on account of his health through the failure
<PB N="17" REF="038495_0016_10122C7F17C69BE0"/>
of proper exercise. Yet such was the wisdom and sagacity of this young man, (for he had scarcely seen his nineteenth year) that he found means, without violating his oath, both to preserve his health, and to free himself from the power of his enemy. The learning and science he had acquired, were im∣mense for one of his years. As he grew up from infancy he discovered a surprising genius. An in∣dulgent parent had afforded him every advantage for the most finished education, that could be derived from the best instructors; and he soon outstripped his competitors in study, making the most rapid advances in all the branches of polite learning, and every accomplishment that might render him ami∣able, respectable and useful. Nature had formed him perfectly beautiful and graceful in his person. With an unaffected goodness of heart, he united the most engaging and winning address, which, with his benevolent actions, had endeared him to all ranks of men. It can therefore be no matter of wonder, that the news of his imprisonment, and the pretended occasion of it, awakened astonishment and the sincerest grief in every heart excepting that of the infamous author, and those of the few assimilated to his vile character. His most powerful friends, among which where those who had, at length, re∣turned to town from the recess, vehemently remon∣strated to the Emperor against such harsh treatment of his son, but in vain. He answered them, that he had obtained some of his incendiary letters;
<PB N="18" REF="038495_0017_10122C812C939348"/>
(which were indeed the forgeries of Sanden,) and that he could at present act no otherwise than he had done. He however felt the most poignant grief, (as well may be conceived on the account of a son so greatly beloved and admired by both his royal parents, as well as by every good citizen. The Empress his mother, his sisters, and his dearest friends were inconsolable; but could prevail noth∣ing in the Prince's favour. The affliction of the Empress was almost too much for her to sustain. A violent fever seized her; and her life was soon deemed to be in eminent danger. The friends of the Prince used every means, in their power, to detect the conspiracies formed against him, and to disperse the storm gathering over the Empire. But matters were so managed by Sanden, and the powers he had engaged on his side, that they could accomplish but little. Ereng and Yerrie the disconsolate sisters, were ever urging them to exertions in behalf of their beloved brother; so that they were at length, constrained to amuse them with flattering hopes but ill founded.</P>
<P>In the mean time Prince Nytan was patiently enduring his confinement and improving himself with a few rare and invaluable books, without which he never travelled far from his father's palace. They instructed him in secrets of nature but little known in the world; and so vast was his genius, that he had already made improvements in the arts by which wonders are performed, beyond the knowledge of the authors of those books; the happy effects of which improvements will be evidenced from the sequel; from which it will appear how this won∣derful man could appear abroad in distant countries, and accomplish great and glorious things, and yet remain all the while in his little prison, doing al∣most every thing he pleased except embracing his
<PB N="19" REF="038495_0018_10122C841B2A21D0"/>
beloved parents, sisters and friends. Before he could enjoy that happiness, he had great things to effect for the good of mankind; and still greater were to succeed them.</P>
<P>He had purchased, in his tour several little pic∣tures, which he had fixed on the walls of his cham∣ber, on each side his couch. One, nearest his view, (which he had picked up from a miry place in the road,) he was very frequently looking at; studying certain figures of writing at the bottom of it, in∣telligible only to himself and their author. We shall see presently the extraordinary services this picture rendered him, of which he became exceed∣ing fond, not without reason.</P>
<P>His chamber had but one large window, which afforded him, as he reclined on his couch a very ex∣tensive and delightful prospect; and from which he beheld the reflected splendors of a magnificent tow∣er, and a number of beautiful buildings that ap∣peared above the distant hills and groves. This prospect entertained him in his momentary relaxa∣tions from his studies. Literary pursuits were ever his chief pleasure, as thereby he became more ca∣pable of serving mankind. To these his retirement was adapted, and he knew how to answer the calls of health for the exercises of walking, riding, and the charms of conversation, by a diet adapted to his sedentary circumstances. He conversed with books, he studied and contemplated the glorious works of nature; but he did not forget the Great Source of Being, and the underived origin of all intellectual light. He conversed with the God of nature, and his great knowledge in the occult science, and the deep mysteries he had learned, were by him improv∣ed for the good of mankind.—Unhappy fate! that a Prince so worthy should be excluded from the world, after having been falsely and slanderously ac∣cused
<PB N="20" REF="038495_0019_10122C85AB5064E8"/>
of seditious practices against his country, a∣gainst his Sovereign, and a parent too for whom he would have freely laid down his life! But such are often the events of this imperfect state of ex∣istence. The good suffer by the wicked. Yet let not the wisdom and goodness of the Almighty be ar∣raigned. For wise and good purposes are the vir∣tuous defamed and prosecuted, virtue is tried, and fortitude, under trials, made illustrious. Thus the good are refined for the enjoyment of higher plea∣sures, and more exalted bliss. Of these important truths, Nytan was far from being insensible; who possessed a great soul, formed to receive every sacred impression, and salutary instruction. Now Ges∣seng said he to his boy, (who was sitting pensive on a low soffa by the side of his bed,) I shall have a proof of my patience under trying circumstances, and of the sincerity of my professed submission to the decrees of Heaven.—O sage instructor of man! let thy preceps and example be ever presented to my thoughts! Thy great soul divinely illuminated, la∣boured for perfection. I aspire to be like thee. Thy bright examples will incessantly strive to imi∣tate, and whilst I patiently and submissively endure, I will exert myself to improve in every thing by which I may, in future, serve and bless mankind, for whose service only would I wish to live. All are my brethren, of one benevolent, glorious, Al∣mighty Father. I love them as such. I weep over their miseries, I am humbled for their errors, and my own. Without the power of doing them good, to me life would be insipid, worthless and intolerable. May kind heaven protect my sovereign parents, my sisters my friends and fellow citizens; and in its own time, bring to light the dark plots of our enemies, and effectually defeat their malicious de∣signs. Then will my integrity shine forth with a

brighter lustre. I wish no evil to Sanden or his ad∣herents; but their contrition, reformation and hap∣piness.'—Here he could not refrain tears at the recollection of his cruel banishment from his fami∣ly and friends, and at the thoughts of their being induced to entertain opinions of him injurious to his honour and his love.</P>
<P>Perceiving the boy was affected, he asked him whether he could, by any means, convey a letter to his sisters, without injury to the trust imposed in him. For Nytan would not, for the world. solicit of him a favor contrary to the injunctions he had received from his master, and the dictates of his con∣science. 'No, my lord, replied Gesseng, I am un∣der oath. I dare not attempt it.' 'Nor dare I, returned the Prince, to pursuade you to betray a trust reposed in you. To break an oath is to tempt the vengeance of Heaven. The vilest that ever dis∣honored our country and its laws, never yet could be so fool-hardy. Swear to me that you have no orders that touch my life.—Why Gesseng are you silent? Then I perceive you have such orders.'—' I dare not, my lord, to make you any reply on this subject,' answered Gesseng.—'Enough—poor deluded boy! exclaimed the Prince; I well know that you, of yourself, can have nothing against me. You are bribed high. The temptations of gold and diamonds have prevailed against humanity, and ren∣dered you, perhaps, in design a murderer.—But O! Gesseng; can you be proof against the tremendous vengeance of the Almighty, which must inevitably fall upon a murderer? sooner or later you must feel it. What then will avail the riches heaped up∣on you, by your vile emyloyer?—But do you not already perceive he must be a villain?—Nay do you not discern that he must be your greatest enemy who
<PB N="22" REF="038495_0021_10122C8AC1A4CAA8"/>
could instigate you to the perpetration of so black a crime? Are you not, by this time, convinced, that such a man must be the traitor and enemy to his country, and indeed to all the world; and not the persecuted Nytan? I see you are convinced. I see you stagger from your horrid purpose, and that I have no further cause of fear.'</P>
<P>The boy fell upon his knees; and with clasped hands, and tears gushing out.—'Never, never, cried he, will I be guilty of so black a deed. If die I must—I will rather die. Forgive me, dear Prince, and I solemnly swear, in the sacred presence of the avenger of wrongs, that I will, henceforth, be care∣ful of your life, though at the expense of my own.</P>
<P>'It is well, replied Prince Nytann, and happy for you, my boy,—and Heaven be praised on your own account, as well as for myself. But let us re∣tire to rest. I will love you, and consult my pillow for our mutual safety. Upon which,—trust me, my dear boy, the happiness and safety of many thou∣sands depend. To-morrow I will shew you jew∣els of immense value; and you shall very soon find whose friendship and confidence is most valuable,—Nytan's or that wicked lord's.' They then re∣tired to bed. But Nytan slept but little. He re∣volved a thousand important things in his mind. He had been now three weeks shut up in his cham∣ber, with no other company than Gesseng. For, not one of the guards of the castle appeared before him. He bore his misfortune with a philosophic tranquility becoming the greatness of his mind, and one who foresaw great consequences that would a∣rise from it, important to himself, his family and minkind.</P>
<P>There were a set of enthusiasts in different prov∣inces of China, who were wholly devoted to their hypocritical priests. They had never the counte∣nance
<PB N="23" REF="038495_0022_10122C8CD5C3BB48"/>
of the Emperor, though tolerated under cer∣tain wise restrictions. Renien, the Emperor, who was very learned and a great writer, had, in some of his published works, (which were of great rep∣utation throughout all China, and other countries,) exposed the absurdities of those religious sects; so that their priests were daily losing their consequence. The greatest body of them was in the province where the insurrection began. Hence Nytan was led to conclude, not without good reason, that his enemy had made use of those priests and their disciples to promote rebellion in the empire, and he was pre∣paring a letter to his father, representing his sus∣picions, and urging various weighty reasons that induced him to conclude they were well founded. How to convey his letter he had not been able to determine. He had only inclosed it in one to his sisters, who, he was confident would be the very last to believe any thing derogatory to his character, hitherto unimpeached.</P>
<P>A religion that contains in its bosom the seeds of vice and oppression, and which tends to enflame in∣stead of destroying vicious inclinations, ought to be exposed by every friend of virtue and the interests of mankind.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Through the influence of false religions, that which inculcates real piety and humanity, hath but little influ∣enced men inclined to imbibe errors—to pervert truth—to be religiously as well as philosophically deceived.</NOTE> Such was the sentiments which pre∣vailed in the court of Renien. The sects of enthu∣siasts, and the promoters of fanaticism, were therefore inimical to the reigning power of China, and might well be supposed to exert themselves when they could act with apparent safety against it. 'Those base priests, then, said the imprisoned Mandarin, were the props on which the plotting minister built his revolu∣tionary

fabric. The discernment and wisdom of my father and his council, will not be long in find∣ing them out; and then they will more effectual∣ly expose their detestable principles to all the world. Their mischievous manoeuvres will ef∣fect to open a new window of light and intelligence on the minds of my countrymen, and serve more rapidly to accelerate the annihilation of superstition and fanaticism that still have an existence in so many provinces of the empire. Their total destruction will be the happiest and most glorious aera of which the world ever boasted. How fortunate will it prove to me; Gesseng, if my letter finds access to my father and sovereign.' This was the general te∣nor of the Prince's conversation with his boy in the morning while he was shewing him his jewels and diamonds, which were of such high value that ei∣ther of them was sufficient to purchase several large provinces. One he presented to Gesseng, as an earnest of what he might expect in future. 'Now my dear boy, said he let us wash and dress for the day—and eat our breakfasts with merry hearts. I have a strong pre-sentiment of some favourable event today or before we shall see the sun rise again above the horison. See you that portrait, continued Nytan, looking at his favorite picture.? Those characters you see at the bottom of it, inform me of things that excite in me the most sanguine hopes. When you go out to the guard, remember the necessary cau∣tions I have given you: be discreet: punctually ob∣serve what I may have occasion to say to you. The time will come, when (if you are now faith∣ful to me) you will have the best reasons to consider your present attendance, on me, as the most fortunate of events. I shall be your faithful friend and instructor, and shall, one day, present you to
<PB N="25" REF="038495_0024_10122C9092C947C8"/>
your sovereign as one whom he will have cause to love and promote.</P>
<P>IT was on the very day of this seasonable com∣mencement of friendship between Prince Nytan and his boy, that the vile minister of mischief had given the latter a potion of poison for the prisoner, which was to be slow in its fatal operation, that his death might be considered as the effect of sickness owing to his close confinement, to chagrin, and being de∣prived of those exercises to which he had been be∣fore daily accustomed. The boy had delivered up the poison to his newly acquired friend; at the same time shewing him a large sum of gold and several valuable diamonds which he had received from San∣den, with the promise of ten times as much, when the work of death was done. 'Reserve all said Nytan, for the miserable labourers who live about this castle, and others. You will never want it. As soon, therefore, as you have opportunity distribute it in alms. Remember what our great law giver hath said;—<HI>Be blessed, and render thyself fortunate by deeds of charity; thus resembling according to thy measure, the giver of all things.'</HI> 'My dear Prince, cried the boy, (now softened with contrition, grat∣itude and love,) how blessed am I already in your friendship and salutary counsels! I shall most cer∣tainly do as you say, in this, and in every thing. Indeed, my dear and most respected sir, I feel my∣self, as it were, another kind of being than what I formerly was, before I revealed the black design. I was far from being happy. I had fears and trem∣blings, with painful reluctance; and suspected my employer of a design upon my own life, to prevent his being discovered after the poison should have de∣stroyed you. But now—O how happy! How grate∣ful! Freed from the disheartened rebukes of con∣science,
<PB N="26" REF="038495_0025_10122C9336671020"/>
and a slavish dependence upon a base, wick∣ed man!' 'It is highly probable, answered Nytan, that, to prevent all possible means of discovery, he would have taken your life. Let us now act with prudence and caution; and rely upon the Supreme disposer of events. Perhaps, one day more may free us from any further danger.</P>
<P>While the boy was gone down into the castle to prepare dinner, Nytan sat down before his window, consulting one of his books; and comparing what he found in it, with the intelligence he had obtained from the characters at the bottom of his favorite picture, which hung on the wall by the side of his bed. He had just attainted to what he was in search of all the forenoon, when the boy entered with their dinner. He made no communications to Ges∣seng; and appeared, all the time of dinner, in a deep study. Gesseng eat with him in silence: when the little dining table was removed, he was dismis∣sed till sunset to take the air, and prepare supper. The door being shut, locked and barred on the out∣side, as had been usual; Nytan laid himself on his couch, the window being open, contemplating the gay and beautiful prospects before him, and the per∣fections of the Great Creator and Upholder of the u∣niverse. At the head of his couch, on his right hand, stood a little cabinet, containing his books, and among other things, a small spying-glass. He took the spying-glass in his hand and looking thro' it clearly discerned several large bodies of armed troops, both horse and foot, passing over the hills, which greatly surprised him. An army marching through the country so near the capital was a sight never seen but once before in his father's reign; which was the only time he had ever beheld such an appearance of war as was now before his eyes. He viewed them attentively a considerable
<PB N="27" REF="038495_0026_10122C9550EFD890"/>
while, as they descended one hill, marched along the valley beneath, and ascended over another, till at lengh they passed out of sight. Inflamed as he was with the desire of knowing what was going for∣ward, and the desire of being present where his eyes now could no more reach;—he had but one re∣source. Folding his hands together, and fixing his eyes upon his favourite picture,—'Go, cried he pretty picture! fly quickly, and bring me intelli∣gence what business those troops are upon, and who employs them. You can do no less for one that loves you, and saved you from near perishing in the mire. Suffer me not to die here with terror.' The pic∣ture flew directly out of the window, and was gone out of sight in a moment. Now, shall soon be sat∣isfied, said the Prince to himself, my sweet little picture, I see, is grateful for the service I have done it. It will be here again presently with the tidings I now am most anxious to hear. I shall learn how my father is employed, and what my mortal enemy is doing. I shall reap the fruits of my deep researches and unwearied studies. I will therefore compose myself to sleep, till Gesseng arrives with supper.—And soundly he slept, till the boy's key rattling in the lock rouzed him. He arose quick∣ly, and sat over against the window to take his sup∣per. The sun was now setting and it was time for the picture to return. Nytan eat his supper in eager expectation; but the picture came not. He grew impatient, and ordered a chaffing-dish of coals, into which he cast a perfume. Then saying over a few mysterious words—the picture obeyed not the summons. Nytan was greatly shocked at this. It was a summons, he imagined, ever to be obeyed. But now it failed. 'Let us lie down without un∣dressing, said the Prince; and, as it is very warm, leave the window open and watch—whatever be the
<PB N="28" REF="038495_0027_10122C9766228ED8"/>
matter I have done my duty. I shall certainly, therefore, know before day, whence this unexpect∣ed delay arises, if I sleep not, and I feel not well enough to sit up. Should I sleep, Gesseng, I shall be nearly undone.' 'Heaven forbid it, my dearest Prince, cried Gessing, I will most certainly keep you awake. I will sing to you, and talk all the time.' 'Singing, answered the Prince, would a∣larm the guard; and I would not, on any account, it should interrupt me, to night. But reach me that vial and a glass. This, added he, will keep me awake, (drinking a glass from the vial) I had like to have forgot. Give me a glass every two hours. You see the vial is again replenished, and do you take two little wafers, which you will find in the lowest draw of my cabinet. They will serve to keep you wakeful. But they have no effect upon those who have passed their eighteenth year: neither does the liquor in the vial answer any purpose to those who are under that age.'</P>
<P>The boy having eat the wafers, and placed a lamp at the bed's head, they both lay down and fell to reading. They read for several hours. Ges∣seng had risen to give the Prince his third glass,—when, on a sudden, a great light shone into the win∣dow. The boy startled, let fall the vial, which was broken in pieces. Hark! exclaimed the Prince, what sweet music is that I hear? It draws nearer to the window. They listened till the music ad∣vanced directly under their window. The light was like mid-day. They distinguished a female voice, and heard distinctly these words, Maidens, give place. Let me come under the window, and ask leave of the beautiful and accomplished Prince Nytan, to present myself before him, and give him his beloved picture; and let him know what delay∣ed its return.' Nytan sprang from his bed to the
<PB N="29" REF="038495_0028_10122C9A07143D98"/>
window in a moment, and cryed, 'You are hearti∣ly welcome; but whoever you are, you must tell me by what means you can be with safety, conveyed to a place so very high from the ground. Besides, my chamber is so small, that it can by no means contain half the gay company you must have with you, and which, likewise, were it in my power I should be very glad to entertain. For I assure you I am nearly tired out with this solitary life.'—He was about to add further,—When a beautiful little yellow-bird flew into the window by the side of him, and perched on the corner of the cabinet. Nytan turned about from the windows, to see what a pretty bird he had in his chamber; and the boy advancing to take it in his hands. 'Touch me not, pretty youth, said the yellow-bird. You see, Prince, I have made bold, on the welcome you have just giv∣en me, and it is to put an end to your concern. I have brought you your faithful picture; and there it hangs in its place. As it is a little ashamed on account of its keeping you so long in a painful sus∣pense. I have undertaken to speak for it, and to ac∣quaint you with what you want to know. But, first, I must inform you who I am, and of the interest I take in your future fortunes. Know, then, that I am the merry and good natured Fairy Leingreing, whose palace is at the bottom of the sea that rolls its waves against the walls of this castle. I was journeying through the air, from Persia, when I met your picture flying in such a prodigious hurry, that one could not get a single word out of it. I was almost affronted to see it pass by without deigning to give an answer of two words to my kind saluta∣tion. So I even turned my course after it to know the cause of such a piece of rudeness. By a talis∣man in the golden chain, which you see about my neck, I found the course the picture had taken▪
<PB N="30" REF="038495_0029_10122C9C205129B0"/>
though it was gone out of sight; and quickening my speed, I soon came up with it. For I could fly as swiftly as the fleetest of all the choice pictures that adorn my grandmother's palace in the island of pictures. I found it fluttering about among the re∣bellious troops; till, at length it darted into the gen∣eral's pocket, and instantly flew out again, into the air, with his written directions. Away it darted through the clouds, giving me a side glance, with a forbidding air. But I flew after it, with velocity enough to overtake it. You, Prince, are too wise and knowing, young as you are, not to discern, that like a good natured fairy, I had but little difficulty in being reconciled to a picture, a relation of my grandmother's, and to detain it till we had done something else besides getting news. For indeed no time was to be lost. The rebel troops were march∣ing, as we found by the orders, to take possession of one of the strongest citadels, for your enemy and false accuser. Another army, under the command of a wicked Genie, was advanced, (as we likewise found by those same orders) near the capital City. And your father was in eminent danger of loosing both his empire and his life. For rebellion had made a rapid progress, through the influence of the mad fanatics, whom the false minister had found means to engage on his side. But you shall hear in a few words how matters are at the present moment. The chief commander, having no orders to produce, must wait till he gets them renewed; and as to the commanding Genie, I have ordered him to his old confinement. His army, finding their leader to be run away, will quarrel among themselves, and be dispersed. The Priests and their silly dupes I am about to handle pretty severely. But you Prince must remain no longer here.' 'Ah sweet bird re∣plied Nytan, that I very well know, yet an oath
<PB N="31" REF="038495_0030_10122C9DAEB0F8F0"/>
confines me to this chamber, and you are sensible it is impossible that I should violate it. To regard it, therefore, as it becomes me; and at the same time to absent myself from this castle and my coun∣try. I have accomplished the means of separating my chamber from the castle, and transporting it, with myself and my companion, to Mount Caucasus, where I have some business.' Very well, replied the yellow-bird; but let us have something to eat first. For I am very hungry, and stand in need of a good supper, considering the work I have to do be∣fore to morrow night.—Yet, after a second thought, we can sup after your chamber has begun its aerial journey; (for I mean to go with you, it being noth∣ing out of my way,) and, our repast being already prepared by my girls below; as we mount in the air, they shall hand it into your chamber door.' 'Thank you with all my heart, for your company, sweet bird and accomplished Fairy, rejoined Nytan, we shall soon be in motion from hence." Then pronouncing some mystical words well understood, and instantly obeyed by the invisible fairies and ge∣nies, the chamber flew off, with a terrible noise, and launched into the air. Then, fixing a spear of gold and several other metals, in a hole on the out∣side of the window, pointed towards the mount, the chamber pursued its destined course. In the mean∣time, the Fairy's girls handed into the door, two large bowls covered, one of gold, the other of burnt china, and a flaggon of wine; taking their leave with the following complimentary song—</P>
<LG TYPE="song">
<LG>
<L>Lovely Prince, in safety fly</L>
<L>Far from thy envious foes;</L>
<L>And enjoy sweet liberty;</L>
<L>And pluck the fairest rose!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="32" REF="038495_0031_10122C9F961E9900"/>
<L>May the maid that sighs for thee,</L>
<L>Possess an angel's form,</L>
<L>And mind; they both will make thee see</L>
<L>The power they have to charm!</L>
</LG>
</LG>
<P>The guards were frightened out of their wits. For the castle shook and trembled as though it was falling in pieces. Some of them rushing forward, and thinking to enter the little chamber, fell head∣long through the aperture which used to be closed at the chamber door. Others ran out into the court∣yard to hear the fine music in the air. See the mu∣sicians they could not. For both they and the cham∣ber were rendered invisible. The happy travellers now uncovered their bowls, and fixing their table near the open window, began their midnight repast. Gesseng handed them wine in cups of gold; asking the little yellow bird's blessing, as he placed the cup before it. 'That you have with all my heart, re∣plied the yellow bird. Regard the councils of this amiable friend of yours, and mine: Be faith in his service, and my blessing will ever follow you. It will not be long before your fidelity and attach∣ment, to this lovely, worthy young man, will be more effectually tried; and I agreeably flatter my∣self, that, in the trial, you will come off with ap∣probation and honor. You serve the son of a great and renouned Emperor, and a son, worthy of a fa∣ther so great, so wise, and so good;—a son, whom I sincerely love and respect; and whose interests I shall ever regard and advance, to the utmost of my power: and likewise those of all his faithful adhe∣rents: In doing which, I am well satisfied that I shall be serving the best interests of mankind.</P>
<P>BOTH Gesseng and the Prince were greatly af∣fected with those generous commendations: and the little bird, or fairy, addressing herself particular∣ly
<PB N="33" REF="038495_0032_10122CA1AF0C4BD8"/>
to Nytan, thus continued her discourse. 'I shall leave you presently, said she, and, as your stay will be but short where you are now going, take this ring, and wear it constantly. If at any time, you shall have occasion for my presence, rub it, and I shall immediately appear before you. If you only want to hear from me, send the picture, which will be proud of flying on your errants as long as her des∣tined hour permits her. I am now going to the island of pictures to see its relations; with whom I have some affairs of consequence. Con∣cerning which I may be, hereafter, permitted to acquaint you.' They then conversed together on a variety of entertaining and improving subjects▪ till day was almost ready to appear, and the chamber rested on the summit of mount Caucasus. The Fairy, as she perceived it, bid them farewell, and bent her course to the island of pictures.—The pal∣ace of libraries was one of the greatest wonders in the world, for its prodigious dimensions, and the infinite number of valuable books it contained. The good Genies who loved learning, had been for several thousands of years collecting them for their own use, and for the use of their particular favour∣ites. By his art, Prince Nytan could command one of those Genies, who dwelt at certain sseasons in a magnificent grotto on one side of a vast rock. His business, then, was with the Genie, to procure from him the keys of the palace, and to obtain di∣rections about the way to it, and the admission of his little chamber in the grand apartment of libra∣ries, which was spacious enough to admit fifty such chambers, and without his chamber being admitted into that apartment, which contained the books he was desirous of perusing, he had no means of enjoy∣ing that pleasure and advantage. Having, therefore,
<PB N="34" REF="038495_0033_10122CA45A7E8820"/>
dismissed his boy in search of the Genie, he next com∣missioned the picture to the yellow-bird with his letters to his father and sisters, which he had forgot to deliver to it; requesting the good bird to fly into the palace window, whilst they were at breakfast, and drop them into their tea-cups. Soon after the picture was gone on this errand, he beheld from his window, Gesseng leading towards it a little fright∣ful looking old man, whose head was ten times larger than the rest of his whole body, and with on∣ly one large eye, which was fixed in the middle of his forehead. He wore a monstrous cap.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He wore a monstrous Cap, resembling female head∣dresses in the reign of oddities.</NOTE> He held in his right hand, a scimetar three yards in length; and advanced with a low and solemn pace. The boy would have been frightened almost out of his wits, had not the old man encouraged him, by telling him he was as harmless as a fly.—Keep your eyes off from me, said he, laughing, if you don't like my looks. Nytan himself was, at first, a little startled at the sight of so hideous an object. For he had never seen him before, nor indeed, any thing half so ugly and disgusting. When the old man was arrived to the door of the chamber, he lay down his scimitar on one side of it. Nytan and his boy helped him in, and seated him on a low soffa. 'I am giddy-headed, and weak with old age, said he, as he dropped on the soffa. Nothing could have tempted me to so long a walk before eating my breakfast, but you must me obeyed. Let me then know your further commands; and when you have given me something to eat, I shall go about them with more cheerfulness.' 'I want the keys of the palace of libraries, replied the Prince. I am going thither to study awhile in my chamber.' 'How
<PB N="35" REF="038495_0034_10122CA670ADC6D8"/>
can that be? returned the old man; or rather the Genie Esdren. But why, continued Esdren, would you go so vast a journey over the ocean, since it is in my power, on certain conditions, to procure you, in less than two hours, as many books, as you want.' 'What are the conditions, asked Prince Nytan?' 'They are only, replied the old man, that you use your endeavours to render me a strong and hand∣some youth like yourself.' As Nytan was about to return an answer to the Genie; with a smile, his picture re-entered the window and took its place on the wall. 'Picture, cried the Prince, here is a de∣formed Genie, above a thousand years old, who has made me the unreasonable request to restore to him youth, strength and beauty.' 'As de∣formed as I am, returned the Genie, I would not change conditions with you; since the state I am in is best, for the time it is to last, which is but very short. What the Creator causes us to be, is al∣ways the best condition for us, and we ought always to be resigned and thankful. And yet, Prince, your pleasantry being set aside, such are the conditions; and I would have you exert yourself in my behalf. Per∣haps you are destined to be instrumental in that change of my circumstances which it is appointed should soon take place.' 'The request of Esdren is not so unreasonable neither, said the picture, and I believe you can do for him with my assistance. I long to see him in a less hideous form. And he shall fetch you twenty of the best volumes in the palace of libraries, which you may study in your chamber, while you are travelling over seas and lands: but first let me give you some little account of the man. From being one of the handsomest of Genies, who have the privilege of immortality, and the perpetual bloom of youth with all its vigour and activity, the accidental indulgence of a single
<PB N="36" REF="038495_0035_10122CA8167E31A8"/>
thought contrary to rectitude, required the trans∣formation into this ugly figure, for a certain term of time. We, good Genies, and Fairies, are apt to err once in a while, and dearly do we smart for it. Such is our destined lot, till the hour of con∣firmation in the highest abodes of perfection, to which we eagerly soar. But, the moment for his re-assuming his proper form and vigour is arrived. Catch the drops, you perceive distilling from me, in the palm of your hand, and pour them on his head.' Prince Nytan did as he was commanded. The old man rose up, threw his cap out of the window, and stood ready for his approaching renovation.</P>
<P>No sooner had the son of Renien, poured the drops on the head of Esdren, than he saw be∣fore him, instead of a deformed old man, a youth as gay and handsome as himself. He threw his arms round his neck, and kissed him again and again. Gesseng leaped for joy.—The chamber shook and trembled.—The picture congratulated Esdren, and,—O wonderful to relate!—leaving its station on the wall, stood before them, a lady of a most beautiful and majestic form!—It was Puria, the wife of Esdren! she flew into his open arms! rap∣ture succeeded rapture, and congratulations succeed∣ed congratulations.</P>
<P>All this happened within twelve minutes after the Genie had entered the Prince's chamber. Nytan thought proper to remind him how weak and hun∣gry he was, not long since; and asked him whether he had lost his appetite, or intended to live only up∣on love? If it be so, continued he, it were ill to in∣terrupt your caresses. The admonition was gra∣ciously received, and they were about to sit down to eat, when, Esdren recollecting himself, proposed breakfasting in his garden, on a terrace, from which they would enjoy a fine prospect. This being read∣ily
<PB N="37" REF="038495_0036_10122CAAD664ECE8"/>
agreed to; and Nytan fixing the spear in its hole they found themselves, instantly on the terrass. There is no occasion, said he, of leaving my cham∣ber, to which, you know, I am indispensably con∣fined to since we are now in your garden, and have every advantage of the prospect from the win∣dow. Here then, let Gesseng spread the table, and set on our breakfast. But O! fair lady! say, how am I to return the surprising obligations you have laid upon me? 'By not thinking of them at all, replied she. It is but just nothing as to what I hope to serve you in. When you picked me up, from the miry canal, only as a fine picture to hang in your chamber, you did me a great kindness, of which, in some future day you may be better in∣formed. As soon as we have done eating, we must hasten after your books, and having brought them to you, our family calls us away immediately, to look after its affairs. In the mean time, you may remain in our garden as long as you please, and make use of the grotto in our absence, after we have served your present occasions.' 'But dear la∣dy, returned Prince Nytan, you have not informed me about my letters.' 'I was about to tell you, answered she, that your father, sisters and friends are well; the Empress, your mother, slowly re∣covering from the disordered state of health into which your cruel usage had thrown her. You will at a proper season, have further communications from the Emperor's Court.' 'Alas! cried the Prince, I fear I have been too bold and forward in troubling that worthy lady, the fairy of the sea, with my letters.' 'Far from so, replied the wife of Es∣dren, you only oblige her, in laying your com∣mands upon her; and, therefore, make yourself perfectly easy and happy on her account. We are
<PB N="38" REF="038495_0037_10122CACEEED36D0"/>
all interested, highly interested in your welfare. You can do us no greater pleasure than to command our services. We shall never be weary of doing you kind offices.' Nytan was about to express his grate∣ful acknowledgments, but silence was enjoined him, and Esdren bid him observe the maidens on the green below, who were preparing to dance for the entertainment of the company. The Prince was all attention, whilst the maidens performed several dan∣ces, after the manner of the Chinese, and, likewise of the several countries in which Esdren alternately resided. They concluded with the following song, addressed to spring, it being that season of the year; and a farewell compliment to their guests, the Prince and Gesseng, whose uncommon beauty and loveli∣ness had excited their affection, and inspired their cheerfulness and vivacity.</P>

<P>The maidens, one after another, ascended the ter∣race, and advanced to the window; which being low, the Prince reached out, and kissed them, pre∣senting each with a diamond ring to wear for his sake. Gesseng went out, and made them a low bow, as they were retreating from the window. Esdren, and his fair partner then retired in order to proceed to the palace of libraries; fixing but two hours for their journey and return. Prince Nytan was now in good spirits, having received so many marks of regard and affection. He sat down at his window, waiting the return of his respectable and kind friends. Gesseng in the mean time, was going in and out from the grotto for his amusement, and preparing, from the Genie's garden and kitch∣en, a recruit of provisions, as he had been ordered, for the next adventure his lord was determined to make over the immense ocean.</P>
<P>Thus time past very agreeably, till Esdren and his consort returned, which they did in little more than an hour, though their journey was above two thou∣sand miles. The twenty volumes being handed in∣to

the chamber, and the friends parting with re∣luctance, and many caresses and affectionate em∣braces; the two adventurers being seated, and the door shut, the chamber mounted in the air, and pas∣sing over the ocean, was soon out of sight. Their course was directed to an island in the Indies. Ny∣tan had now nothing to do but examine his new books, whilst Gesseng was preparing dinner in a little stove in a corner of the chamber. They ob∣served, in their aerial course, several ships traversing the ocean, and the men busy on the decks, them∣selves and their wonderful travelling vehicle being visible to none; which circumstance was occasioned by a great magical operation equal to any ever per∣formed, and which often was of notable service to the fortunate adventurers. However, on proper oc∣casions, hereafter, they were rendered visible, in their majestic ascent or descent from the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the air.</P>

<Q><L>Not bars, nor walls, nor guards, nor golden key,</L>
<L>Th' oppress'd confine, whom Heaven wills to free.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>A MIND possessed of conscious rectitude, Heav∣en's choicest gift to the Denizens of earth; as it voluntarily rests its whole destiny with the faithful protecting power whence it originated; it calmly beholds the vicissitudes of life, convinced, beyond a doubt fortune that visits or awaits it, is wisely and benevolently appointed; and that the result of all will prove its highest good, its perfect felicity. Ah! how happy is the allotment of the being thus forti∣fied against the ills of life! That such ought to be the mind of every human being, the character the Deity hath exhibited of himself, as the never fail∣ing friend of all the intelligent creation, sufficient∣ly evinces to the wise and discerning. They are certain of a kind support under, and a compleat relief from every affliction in the most seasonable moment; for which, in the severest and darkest trials, they patiently wait, and with a lively resignation. Such was the mind of the persecuted Prince Nytan, when he experienced so wonderful an interposition in his behalf; when powers superior to humanity, rose, indignant, for the protection of virtue, and the de∣feat of its malicious foes. Under such mighty pro∣tection he soars aloft, and traverses the vast ocean to distant lands, bending his course to his destined island. Yet, though virtuous, great, and wise, some events must needs occur, in the course of so
<PB N="42" REF="038495_0041_10122CB62BE23120"/>
well directed a life, to remind him of his depen∣dence; and that he is still to improve in prudence and circumspection.</P>
<P>Gesseng, inadvertantly leaned against the cham∣ber door; which being carelesly fastened by a string, the string gave way, the door flew open, and he fell backwards into the ocean. The door, indeed had a lock, but it had been rendered useless by the shock the chamber had received on its separation from the castle. Prince Nytan turned his head to the door, on hearing the cry of Gesseng as he fell, and perceiving he was gone, immediately caused his chamber to descend to the surface of the water. But, as he was reaching out his hand to him, a monstrous fish swallowed him down his throat. Nytan was obliged instantly to retreat, with his chamber, from the monster, and the convulsions he made in the Wa∣ter. But suddenly recollecting himself, and glanc∣ing an eye at the tapestry on the wall at some mys∣terious characters and drawings, he took up his mag∣ic glass, and reconnoitred the fish. The fish, ob∣serving him, called out to him with a loud voice, 'O! gracious mandarin, Prince of lords! cried he, I have preserved the boy from perishing. In return for this piece of service, save an unfortunate Genie from the malice of the wicked Gendor, who having thus transformed me▪ as you see, confined me below the depths of the seas. You have only to throw your magic spear at me, and I shall appear in my proper shape, enter with the lad into your chamber, and place the spear in your hand.' 'Thou liest vile miscreant! replied Nytan, thou art that very Gendor, whom thou taxest with malice. Instantly deliver up my boy; or the vengeance of Esdren, and the son of Renien, shall inflict upon thee a more dreadful punishment.'</P>
<P>The affrighted trembling Gendor, immediately
<PB N="43" REF="038495_0042_10122CB7BB089068"/>
vomited out Gesseng, and bid himself in the bottom of the ocean. Gesseng swam towards the chamber, and soon found himself in safety with his beloved lord, who helping him to strip, rubbing him with cloths till his skin was dry, bade him repose him∣self on the bed; where covering him with the sheet and counterpane, and giving him a glass of cordial, he sat down by him congratulating him on his fortuate escape, and at the same time vehement∣ly accusing himself for his neglect of the door and lock, which he soon after, rendered properly se∣cure. Gesseng took all the blame to himself; as said he, 'To look after such things was my busi∣ness.' Prince Nytan assured him he intended him not an indirect reproof, and that if one was to blame, so was the other. 'I surely, continued the Prince, ought to have looked about me a little better. But, you only, my dear boy have been the sufferer.' Then kissing him, he advised him to endeavour to get a little sleep, which would be of service to him after the violence and purturbation he had undergone.</P>
<P>The next morning the Island appeared in view, and, before the sun had well risen, they were land∣ed on the summit of a hill, not far from its centre. The Prince, now having his spying-glass improved to his mind, (through which he could now see al∣most every thing above a thousand miles round him, with as much perspicuity as though he was upon the very spot to which he directed the glass;) now looked through it round the island, which appeared to be very large, and as he afterwards found, above three hundred leagues in length, and two hundred in breadth. It likewise appeared to be very fruitful and pleasant. He next directed the glass to his father's palace. The windows of the palace, and of his father's closet being open he dis∣tinctly saw him at his table, indicting a letter, which
<PB N="44" REF="038495_0043_10122CB94E99FDC8"/>
he perceived to be to himself; having read the whole of it, he beheld his father sign his name, with joy too, he saw him fold the letter, superscribe, and seal it; then deliver it to the messenger in wait∣ing; who went away with it. The contents of it were congratulatory, and affectionate. They like∣wise gave him his liberty, which was the greatest joy to Nytan; who now looked upon himself as free from his oath, and to go in and out as he pleas∣ed. He therefore gave a shout of rapturous joy, embraced his beloved Gesseng, and taking him by the hand 'Now said he, my lovely friend, we will walk and reconnoiter the island with the greatest pleasure.' They went out together, and descended the hill into an agreeable vale encompassed with woods, except several openings which afforded a de∣lightful prospect.—This island was inhabited by thirty men who had escaped from shipwreck, and was unknown to any others but Genies and Fairies, one of whom, whose name was Ravenzar, owned a palace under ground, in the heart of the island, and possessed vast riches. Those men had lived on the island about eight years, subsisting on what the i∣sland afforded, having several pieces of ground en∣closed for wheat, sheep and cattle, and little huts. Ravenzar who himself, unseen found means to con∣vey them into the island, could easily afford them better accommodations in a place from whence it was impossible for them to free themselves; but he thought best for them to remain as they were, till they had acquired fixed habits of virtue, and a con∣tempt for the vices and luxuries of the country from whence they originated. To this purpose the good Genie constantly assisted them. Prince Nytan knew all this, and fell in with the noble designs of Ra∣venzar. Besides, he had been informed, by some characters on his tapestry, than the hour was not
<PB N="45" REF="038495_0044_10122CBB64F597F8"/>
far off, when he should obtain from the Genie, an immense treasure for benevolent and charitable pur∣poses. It was on the knowledge of these, and oth∣er things respecting the island, that he had set out, and arrived to it.</P>
<P>Gesseng had greatly improved, under the tuition of so wise and generous a Prince, considering the short time he had been with him. As it would there∣fore, be now of great advantage to them both, Ny∣tan began to acquaint the youth with some of his great and benevolent designs. All his purposes were nobly disinterested, and effectually tending to the good of others; especially of the lowest classes of mankind, the poor, and the oppresssed. Such a life as was that of this Prince was indeed invaluable. He formed, in himself the truly great character and no man can with propriety be called great, any further than he is benevolent and virtuous, a pro∣moter of the happiness of his fellow creatures; in doing which this accomplished Prince and chief mandarin was ever busy. The greater part of the nights he was instructing young Gesseng; improving and invigorating his mind with the most useful learn∣ing, and virtuous precepts. Gesseng, too, was em∣ployed, the best part of each day, in the study of suit∣able books.</P>
<P>Prince Nytan now communicated to this well in∣structed youth, his business on the island (which he denominated the island of Ravenzar) and his design likewise of visiting nations and kingdoms; and, if possible, to kindle the sacred flame of philanthropy in foreign courts, where, it appeared from what he had learned, to be almost, if not altogether extin∣guished by vice, luxury, and intemperance. 'Those, said he, who are in exalted stations, should not desire to live but to bless mankind, and render them still
<PB N="46" REF="038495_0045_10122CBE8AF35C28"/>
happier. The longed-for period I hope is not far distant, when true knowledge and virtue will diffuse their salutary influence through every region of the habitable world. Let us do all in our power to bring forward the happy aera. But, it is now time for us to return and prepare breakfast. I expect Raven∣zar will be with us, in a few minutes. How pleas∣ant and refreshing is a walk after so long a confine∣ment. I hope to have a more pleasant one present∣ly, when we shall visit the Genie's palace, and the few not altogether unhappy inhabitants of the island.'</P>
<P>'Ah! Prince, thou wilt for once be disappoint∣ed! for this is the only walk thou art to enjoy for several years yet to come. Power superior to thine, and to mine, hath otherwise decreed for thee! thou must be again circumscribed within the limits of thy little prison;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heaven disappoints man his favorite, but for his good. Humility, resignation, dependance on, and un∣reserved confidence in our Maker and changeless Friend, constitute our happiness in every situation and circum∣stance of life.</NOTE> in which, indeed, thou wilt en∣joy the pleasure of riding triumphant over sea and land, and doing those services to thy fellow crea∣tures, which must precede thy benevolent intentions here. Make haste therefore, continued the voice of one unseen, to traverse the ocean, and visit far distant countries; pursuing the different courses, as the inspiring and protecting power shall direct thee. Be wary, and omit nothing. Remember the ne∣glected lock. I am not permitted to render myself visible, nor again to address thee till sometime af∣ter thou shalt return to this island. Ravenzar bids thee farewell, and prosper. Thou wilt find in thy chamber, a deed of gift of my palace and of the
<PB N="47" REF="038495_0046_10122CC0192C4660"/>
treasures there, as well as of the island. They are all your own property.'—</P>
<P>'Well then, cried the Prince, farewell Raven∣zar! to the will of Heaven I am all resignation. Come Gesseng, let us hasten to fulfill its wise and righteous decrees. This is our course of virtue, glory and felicity.' Then securing themselves in their chamber, they steered their destined course o∣ver the boundless waves!</P>

<P>THE fortunate son of Renien found his tapestry had not deceived him, when he perused the deed of gift from Ravenzar, which was written on a marble slab in letters of gold, and witnessed by four other Genies, his friends who lived in the in∣terior of Africa, and who had just called to carry him thither, on affairs of highest moment. The marble slab, on which the deed was written, was framed with gold and diamonds, and bordered with beautiful paintings of romantic scenes. It was hung up on the wall, in the Prince's chamber, by the side of his couch, in the place of his favorite picture. It was indeed a noble ornament there. His liberal benefactor could well spare the palace, and treasures, as likewise the island, as he owned several other palaces in different parts of the world, equally enriched with gold and diamonds, and vast tracts of land, equal to any in the most fertile coun∣try. But rich, profusely rich as Prince Nytan was now become, he valued not his treasures, but as they served to promote the happiness of others. The hour when he should again visit this island was wrote on the slab; and was distanced three years and an half from that of his leaving it.</P>
<P>Whilst the chamber progressed with an unprece∣dented
<PB N="49" REF="038495_0048_10122CC4F1C89D18"/>
velocity, the Prince and Gesseng, were pur∣suing their studies; till they found themselves on the continent of Africa. Nytan clothed himself mag∣nificently, and put on his head a crown of gold, a present from Ravenzar, as was likewise a golden sceptre. He then sent out Gesseng to assemble be∣fore him, the king of the country, and his nobles on business of high import to their future grandeur and felicity; ordering Gesseng to represent in be∣coming terms, the impracticability of his leaving his habitation, or passing over the threshold of his door, till he had visited other nations, and fulfilled his high commissions.</P>
<P>To contract the relation of Reshang, let it suf∣fice to say, the Prince was cordially received by king Zanger and his nobility who entered into his benevolent views, and eagerly imbibed his instruc∣tions; gratefully accepting the useful books pre∣sented to them in their own tongue. Here the Prince, having been stationary five weeks, took leave of the king, the nobility and gentlemen, and with Gesseng, bent his course to other regions, promis∣ing them to visit them again in some future period, when he hoped the king and himself should be able to congratulate each other on the success of their en∣deavors for the good of that kingdom, and when he likewise hoped to find their salutary influence extend∣ed to the neighbouring petty kingdoms. They like∣wise settled the means of their correspondence while absent from each other.</P>
<P>After Prince Nytan had spent near three years and an half, (as was determined) instructing kings and their subjects, in a great number of barbarous nations, and laid the foundation of future happy revolutions; he at length, bent his course to the i∣sland of Ravenzar, and hastened to accomplish those
<PB N="50" REF="038495_0049_10122CC68380D5D8"/>
great and noble designs he had so much at heart. He therefore, with eagerness, exercised his skill to accelerate his progress. Perhaps, wise and good as he was, he was rather too impatient; and Heaven might see fit a little to check the rapidity of his thoughts and the incredible velocity <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> flying vehicle.—On a sudden, the air was <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> darken∣ed!—When Nytan, lifting up his eyes, beheld a formidable body of gigantic monsters, blazing with fire, and rolling vast mountains down the skies up∣on his chamber! Astonishment seized him! come hither Gesseng, cried he, and see what fatal mis∣chief is ready to crush us!—The youth beheld—trembled and turned pale! he sunk to the floor and embraced the knees of his lord, in speechless ter∣ror! the Prince, however, had the presence of mind to recollect what he had long since learned from celestial science, that, in the moment of greatest dis∣tress, deliverance was at hand. He knew that some∣thing must occur to relieve a mind in such a situa∣tion as was his, or he must suddenly perish; sus∣pended as he was in the air, in so slender a vehicle, which was now arrested in its progress;—the bot∣tomless ocean beneath him, and tremendous ruin rushing down from above, urged on by the ven∣geance of malicious spirits, of superior power! Re∣posing in the Almighty, he accidentally cast his eyes upon the ring on his finger, and rubbing it hard, at the same time flinging open his chamber door, the fairy Leingreing instantly entered. The Prince embraced her with joy! Gesseng kissed her hand in rapture! immediately a most dreadful hur∣ricane arose! loud thunders roared, and awful light∣nings glared! the universe seemed to be one mass of fire! and all nature convulsed and dissolving! the Fairy suddenly locking the door, commanded the chamber to the bottom of the ocean. It in∣stantly
<PB N="51" REF="038495_0050_10122CC89C073390"/>
descended, at the moment Prince Nytan clos∣ed the window; but almost as instantaneously a∣gain immerged from the waves, and ascended into the air; when all was calm! The mountains were melted, rent and scattered; the bodies of those wick∣ed Genies, (for such they were) were annihilated; and those mischievous spirits, seized with panic terror, never afterwards dared to appear assem∣bled.</P>
<P>Thus the fortunate son of Renien experienced a third deliverance from the efforts of his malicious and vengeful enemies. The second was from the suddenly conceived stratagem of the huge Leviathan, who swallowed up Gesseng, and whose further in∣tention was, when the Prince should have thrown his spear, as he requested of him, to vanish with that talisman to the bottom of the sea; well know∣ing that the Prince being deprived of it, must in∣evitably perish. This stratagem of the wicked Ge∣nie, transformed into a monstrous fish, was as sud∣denly defeated, as conceived and attempted. Was not such an event designed to admonish the young adventurer of the importance of the most careful at∣tention to the minutest affairs? That it was so, was fully ascertained to him by the memento from Ra∣venzar—remember the neglected lock: and should not this last terrible event effectually serve to solem∣nize his mind, inspire weighty reflections, shew him his dependance, and restrain his vivacity and over-eagerness in his pursuits? The instructions, deducible from both, were indeed of the last conse∣quence to his conduct and success through life. Neither were they lost upon the Prince any more than were the good counsels of the Fairy. He renew∣ed his confidence in the arbiter and disposer of worlds, and conductor of the destinies of their in∣habitants, who, he well knew, could remove moun∣tains,
<PB N="52" REF="038495_0051_10122CCA2B5790D8"/>
should they obstruct his progress in accom∣plishing the good of mankind: <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> effect which was all he desired. For, to be himself happy without beholding the happiness of his fellow creatures, was the furthest of all things from the wish of his noble and generous heart. He could by no means be blest in himself, but in sure prospect of the felicity of every existence in the creation. The fairy Leing∣reing continued with Prince Nytan till his arrival at the island of Ravenzar. She informed him what she had done with the rebellious priests, and of the fate of the arch rebel Sanden. The priests were confined to the mines for a certain time; which being expired, they were to exist separately, and at the greatest distance from each other, in a state of trial, and with a scanty allowance. The treacherous and manoeuvering minister was secluded in a grove on the very island to which Nytan was now hasten∣ing, and surrounded with perpetual darkness; in which condition he was to remain till the Fairy's designs upon him, should be accomplished by Ny∣tan himself; to which purpose she gave him suita∣ble instructions. Being now safely landed on the island, Leingreing bid him and Gesseng an affec∣tionate adieu; acquainting them that Ravenzar was still in the interior of Africa, and would be some time detained from visiting them; and on that ac∣count it was he had made over to the Prince, his island, palace and treasures. She likewise inform∣ed them, that the entrance into the Genie's palace would be rendered visible to them as they were walking.</P>
<P>The fairy Leingreing being gone, the Prince and Gesseng went to a fountain and bathed. The sun was setting, when they returned to the chamber; where after taking some refreshment, and securing the door and window, they retired to bed, leaving
<PB N="53" REF="038495_0052_10122CCC9FE28960"/>
two wax candles burning on a marble table, which stood at the bed's head. There was nothing to dis∣turb their repose. Nytan's was the more sweeten∣ed by renewed liberty. 'Though I long to be with my parents, my sisters, and other friends, said the Prince, as he was dressing in the morning, yet so are the duties of my life circumstanced, that it will not be in my power to enjoy so great a pleasure, till I have been through Europe, and effected some very important things for myself and this island. How∣ever it affords me a great satisfaction that my dear Fairy has informed me they were in good health; that the monster rebellion, was crushed, and fanat∣acism breathing its last. Agreeable tidings these, my Gesseng! they will animate our zeal in the cause of liberty, of truth and virtue. Let us hasten, then, to the little community of this island, which we have been so long prevented from visiting. After∣wards we will descend into the palace of our bene∣factor.'—</P>
<P>The enterprizing son of Renien, had already per∣formed exploits of benevolence, which no confine∣ment found means to baffle, or schemes and enter∣prizes of malevolence to defeat—enterprizes con∣ducted by great, but wicked spirits; beings endow∣ed with an immortal strength and activity. It is true, indeed, he was not unaided. But, who was the son of mortality, or, who among the most ex∣alted and most potent intelligences, that could, ever effect the accomplishment of great designs without the assistance of others? Yet all—all, throughout the boundless regions of creation, are animated, guided, and rendered happily successful, by its omnipotent Lord, in every glorious work of benevolence and love! Of these truths our enterprising philanthro∣pist was fully sensible. Nor could he undertake, or hope for success in any kind of adventure, without
<PB N="54" REF="038495_0053_10122CD01D17B930"/>
an unreserved confidence in, and secret application to the great creator of worlds, and conductor of all their operations.</P>
<P>The Prince and his companion having breakfast∣ed, walked out on the banks of the river, shaded by the finest trees, of various kinds, besides fruit trees, which where on either side their way. Following the course of the river, they soon reach the huts of the inhabitants, who were not a little surprized at the sight of two strangers. The Prince assembling them under the shades of a venerable oak, acquaint∣ed them with his designs, and gained their concur∣rence. Most of those men had been very infirm, the chief of the time of their inhabiting the island. The spot on which they resided, was exceeding pleasant. The mountains and woods formed a mag∣nificent amphitheatre around them, situated as they were in an extensive valley, interspersed with a va∣riety of groves and fruit trees of all kinds, and flow∣ers, which perfumed the air, whilst the feathered songsters entertained them with their charming melody. They were gradually regaining health, and were indeed greatly pleased and animated with the behaviour and designs of their new friend and benefactor, who next bent his course towards the lofty ridge of mountains that divided the island into two equal parts. Through a vast rock among these mountains, he entered the Genie's (or rather his palace, with Gesseng. Striking the rock with his foot, it opened, and discovered to them a staircase of white marble, which they descended, the rock closing upon them. There was a glimmering light, which increased as they descended, till all was bright refulgent day. As they walked on, a vast hall ap∣peared before them, at the end of a spacious court paved with black marble. The gate of the hall, at their approach, unfolded its two golden leaves. On
<PB N="55" REF="038495_0054_10122CD1AB2DB218"/>
entering, they were struck with the beauty, gran∣deur and magnificence of every thing that saluted their eyes. In the middle of the hall was a large table spread and loaded with provisions of the most exquisite kind. Above the table, on raised alcoves, stood forty maidens, and the same number of young men, who all bid the Prince welcome to his palace, adding that they were his servants, and ready to o∣bey his commands. 'My benevolent friend, an∣swered Prince Nytan, increases my obligations, in commissioning you to serve me. I have business for you, which I doubt not the servants of so great and good a lord, as Ravenzar, will perform with pleasure. But you are still to consider yourselves as belonging to him, and only graciously lent to me. After we have eaten and viewed the palace and gar∣dens, we shall find some agreeable employment for you. Come then, Gesseng, let us partake of the boun∣ties of our common friend and benefactor.' Whilst they sat eating, the ladies entertained them with a concert of music, which was performed in that charming perfection of which fairies were so capa∣ble. When they were risen from the table, the Prince desired two of the young men to at∣tend him, and shew him the buildings and apart∣ments of the palace. Leaving the hall, they walked through a spacious gallery, viewed a number of magnificent chambers, and the immense riches in the treasury apartments. They went, next, into the gardens; which were large, and beyond des∣cription beautiful. But that which gave an inex∣pressible addition to those enchanting scenes, was the appearance of above thirty of the most charming female forms, just risen from the chrystal fountain, in which they had been bathing, and covering them∣selves with their milk white robes! The Prince and his attendants, being unobserved by them turn∣ed
<PB N="56" REF="038495_0055_10122CD337CDC828"/>
into another alley of the gardens. Still the love∣ly females were in view through the grove of trees, where they made a stand till they advanced from the fountain. Prince Nytan then moved towards them, and addressed them in the politest terms. After which they all walked together, and seated them∣selves in a superb saloon: when one of the ladies, who appeared to be the eldest, knowing the Prince by the description that had been previously given of his person, made him the following sensible address. 'We are commanded, noble and generous youth, by our kind protector, to acquaint you with our lit∣tle history, as one who will become interested in the felicity of our future lives. Though you see us among beings of a superior order, we are of the race of mortals. Snatched from destruction, when in swaddling clothes, deserted as we were by un∣natural parents of the different countries in which we were born, by the benevolent and compassion∣ate Ravenzar; under his fatherly care we have been nourished and brought up in this palace, now your property. The all accomplished and paternal Ra∣venzar has spared no pains in our education, that might render us fit to appear in the world, and use∣ful in whatever sphere of life it is allotted for us to move. By him we are now committed to your care and direction. What improvements we have made you are to be the judge, and assign us to such depart∣ments as to you shall appear most elegible. To you, therefore, we cheerfully resign ourselves, reposing in you an unreserved confidence as our friend and future guide.' When the lady uttered this last sen∣tence, they all rose from their seats, and paid Ny∣tan the respect he so justly merited, who conversed with them with that modesty and superior sense so natural to him. After which they went together into the hall. The waiting maidens and young
<PB N="57" REF="038495_0056_10122CD6ADB5C840"/>
men, paid the ladies that deference in which they had always been instructed. Prince Nytan then ac∣quainted them, that he should be absent from them a day or two in the issland; and, if longer, he should send them word. Then ordering the two young men who attended him into the garden, to follow him and Gesseng, he returned into the island. 'I am about to shew you, said he to the two young men, as they followed him towards the huts, our little so∣ciety, and to set you and your felllow servants to work for us.'—'Which we shall do with the great∣est pleasure, replied the young men. Every command of yours, most respected Prince, will be to us an in∣dispensable obligation. Our service, time, and abili∣ties are ever yours.' 'Well then, my friends, re∣turned Nytan, (for such I shall ever call you) you now see before you, the diminutive dwellings of the inhabitants of the island. You are this day to pro∣vide them with better ones. Before morning let me have thirty new houses compleated on this spot of ground over which we are walking. Let them be, likewise, furnished with every thing necessary and convenient. Besides there must be out houses, wells and gardens, with all things needful to each. I must have likewise a large palace, with a spacious and magnificent garden for myself with every neces∣sary building and furniture. All the buildings must be of grey polished marble The hall, which must be erected in the middle of my palace, must be suffi∣ciently large to entertain a thousand guests, without being in the least embarrassed for want of room. In the hall, too, a table must be spread with the most suitable provisions, by the middle of next day, with twenty waiters to attend. Before this last is done, one half of the gold and diamonds in the palace un∣der ground must be deposited in the treasury in my
<PB N="58" REF="038495_0057_10122CD8416ACB00"/>
palace. Several servants, male and female are also to attend, in future, on each inhabitant of the island, who are to dine in my hall on the morrow. When all is compleated give me notice.</P>
<P>The two young men bowed, signifying their cheerful obedience, and retired. Prince Nytan, then having dismissed Gesseng to look after his cham∣ber, and to wait there for him, directed his course to the wood where his once dangerous and inveter∣ate enemy was confined. The darkness in which he had <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> involved, was now dispersed, and he found <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> employed in reading, reclined on a soffa under a magnificent canopy surrounded by fragrant trees and flowers, with a carpet of green, before him of nature's forming.</P>
<P>'Ah! worthy and amiable son of the illustrious Renien, exclaimed Sanden, as soon as he perceived the Prince advancing towards him, how rejoiced am I to see you, now no longer your enemy, but henceforward your most sincere and zealous friend! I am confident, you will rejoice in the new forma∣tion of a heart very early seduced and perverted by evil spirits. I was apprized by the fairy, your friend, and mine, of your coming hither, and have been impatiently expecting you. O then, much injured Prince! let this meeting correspond with the wishes and requests of so charming a fairy as Leingreing, the sovereign lady of the sea; and make what trial you think proper of the sincerity of my professions. I am wholly devoted to you.'</P>
<P>'Add no more, replied the generous son of Re∣nien, from henceforward, we are friends. As such, let me embrace Sanden, and now, lay upon me your commands, and they shall be punctually fulfilled.' After many tears, Sanden resumed his discourse.</P>
<P>Though, my dear Prince, I have the most ardent <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to visit my family, and to throw myself at my
<PB N="59" REF="038495_0058_10122CDA5835C8D0"/>
sovereign's feet, yet I am ready, with the greatest pleasure, to attend you, wherever you are going, that I may be perpetually convincing you of the sinceri∣ty of my friendship and love.'</P>
<P>'It is most reasonable, answered Prince Ny∣tan, that you should first return home, and be∣sides, in so doing, you will, at this juncture, best serve our common cause, at the same time that you gratify your own wishes, which are highly com∣mendable, and which, I perceive, correspond with the sentiments of the Fairy, our common friend.—Observe yonder exhibition, stationary in the air.' Sanden lift up his eyes, and beheld, in the air, a repre∣sentation of a large vessel, and an Island to which the vessel was arrived, and casting anchor. As they both viewed the vessel, the island disappeared, and the vessel moved forward, descending to the sea shore, to which a tall figure, on its deck pointed. 'Then we must even follow it, said Nytan. This calls you immediately home. As we are walking, I will consider, and afterwards propose to you what ad∣vantages I would derive from this unexpected sa∣vor.'</P>
<P>When the two friends had walked in sight of the sea, they espied the vessel. The island was on all sides surrounded with rocks of that prodigious height, that no mortal could penetrate into it without the aid of superior power. Before they espied the ves∣sel, they had ascended a mountain which overlooked the rocks. The fairy Leingreing now descended in a chariot, drawn by winged horses, and saluting the Prince and Sanden—'Come, mount into the chariot, said she, and let us away. They were no sooner seated with the fairy, in the chariot, than the horses expanded their sable wings, and coursed their way▪ between the earth and heavens, down to the sea shore, where the vessel lay at anchor. In a
<PB N="60" REF="038495_0059_10122CDC314B2400"/>
few minutes the travellers, with the Fairy their conductor, were on board, and the vessel set sail. The son of Renien then proposed, that after the vessel was arrived at Pekin, and Sanden restored to his friends and his sovereign, he should request of the Emperor, in his name, to send the ship back loaded with goods, and families of the poorest sort, to settle in his island; acquainting the Emperor with the condition of the island, and the progress he was making in its settlement. This being a∣greed to, and a letter wrote and delivered to San∣den, for the Emperor, they separated with affec∣tionate embraces; the ship pursued its course, and the fairy conveyed Prince Nytan, in her aerial cha∣riot, to his chamber; where Gesseng was waiting his coming, and had made ready his supper. The sun had now but one hour to finish his diurnal course, when the Fairy and Prince entered the cham∣ber, and sat down to supper; enjoying the delight∣ful prospects from the window and conversing on the most useful and entertaining subjects. Supper being ended, they walked out, and seated themselves on a mossy couch, where the woods afforded them an agreeable shade. They had a fine prospect of the river before them, of the lawns and groves on the opposite side, and a ridge of mountains covered with hanging rocks and woods. The birds charm∣ed them with their harmonious notes. The whole scene around them was enchantingly romantic and picturesque; and led them into an affecting con∣versation on the glorious and magnificent scenes of creation, till their minds were elevated, and enrap∣tured! and in the warm effusions of their grateful and admiring hearts they poured forth in the fol∣lowing ode:—</P>

The harmonious sound of the voices of this respec∣table company, well corresponded with the exalted sentiments they conveyed perhaps to the listening ears of invisible superior beings. After a few minutes of silent contemplation, Gesseng, no longer able to restrain the sacred impulse, broke out in the fol∣lowing grateful strain; O! happy evening! which blesses me with company so exalted in sentiment and virtue, with conversation so instructing; inspir∣ing me with great and elevating ideas, and every virtuous resolution! and may I not call it a most fortunate event which fixed me in the service of so kind and indulgent a Prince; and which, at length introduced me to the presence, and, with the profoundest gratitude and respect I utter it, to the friendship of so amiable, so condescending a Fairy! O! illustrious friends! every moment of my life shall be employed in unremitted exertions to ren∣der myself worthy of your countenance and protec∣tion!'</P>
<P>The Fairy Leingreing was so well pleated with this behaviour of the enraptured youth, that she re∣newed her former blessing, and made him a present of a most beautiful diamond ring, as a further testi∣mony of her friendship and esteem. They then rose up, and walked, conversing together, till late in the evening, when the Fairy departed, and left her be∣loved friends to their necessary repose.</P>
<P>'How vigilant is our amiable benefactor for our good, exclaimed Prince Nytan, as they fastened the chamber door, and prepared for bed.—What illus∣trious deeds of benevolence hath she already per∣formed for our security and happiness, and still is she exercising her great power and talents to the same generous purposes.—Then our other great and powerful friends—those too we shall ever remem∣ber with the profoundest resspect, the most servent

gratitude and love! will it not be happy, Gesseng, to see them all together, before we are again called to leave our island? I shall use all the influence I have to effect such a meeting. But let us take our needful rest. Tomorrow will be a day of more than ordinary business.'</P>
<P>The Prince had acquainted Gesseng with the sur∣prizing change effected on the minister, Sanden, and the business he was gone to transact with the Emperor, his father. 'It will probably, said he, as he entered his bed, require a month or longer, to collect the families, agreeably to my request. The Emperor will be very particular in his choice of them. I intend, however, by the time they are here, to have their houses ready, and every thing completed for them that will be necessary and con∣venient, and, likewise, the men we have with us settled according to my wishes.' 'May benignant Heaven, replied Gesseng, grant you every wish, and my felicity will be complete.' 'To that be∣nignant Heaven, returned Nytan, let us commit ourselves, our friends, and all mankind, till we a∣wake in the morning, to bless the kind, protecting power.'—Sleep soon closed their eyes, and commis∣sioned guardian angels watched around their pil∣lows!—The morning found them refreshed and in∣vigorated for the business of the day. They arose and bathed in the fountain. Nytan walked with a book in his hand, enjoying the delicious pleasures which so fine a country afforded: whilst Gesseng, equally happy and delighted, prepared their morn∣ing repast. Having breakfasted, they walked to∣gether in the groves, waiting the arrival of the two young men, who were to notify the accomplish∣ment of their orders. They soon made their ap∣pearance, requesting the two friends to visit and ex∣amine

their works.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Verres,</HI> the historian of <HI>Xuntien,</HI> hath not reared the buildings, and peopled the island, with the expedition of Reshang. He, however, relates all as accomplished in grandeur unprecedented, and with dispatch unparalled, the efforts of mightiest genius and industry, which effect the greatest wonders.</NOTE> Prince Nytan with Gesseng, hastening with the young men, found every thing done to his mind. 'Now said he go and fetch hither the beautiful company of orphans, and their respecta∣ble attendants. We shall be waiting for them in the hall.' His servants obeyed, he walked on, with Gesseng, to the men who inhabited the huts, to con∣gratulate, and introduce them to their new buildings, which the intervening groves prevented them from observing. But, when Nytan brought them forth, and in view of the buildings and gardens, great in∣deed was their astonishment and admiration. Every thing, indeed, they beheld, was beautiful, grand, and elegant. Their houses which were of grey polished marble, stood in a circular form, at proper distances from each other and made a noble and magnificent appearance. Nytan's palace, being at a considerable distance from them, was scarcely per∣ceivable, for the intervening groves. The men having viewed and examined their gardens and buildings, and expressed their admiration and grat∣itude to their benefactors, followed him to his pal∣ace, which was encompassed with a wall of grey marble. They entered a magnificent gate, and crossing a spacious court, ascended by four and twen∣ty steps, into the hall. It was a vast apartment, fur∣nished with the utmost magnificence. The soffas were of cloth of gold, the carpets of green velvet, and every thing was answerable. A large table stood in the middle of the hall, sumptuously furnished,
<PB N="65" REF="038495_0064_10122CE7545A9A10"/>
and the beaufat dazzled the eyes with a profusion of vessels and flaggons, cups and dishes of gold and diamonds. Here, being all seated, they were fur∣nished, by the Prince and Gesseng, with delicious wines and fruits, as a refreshment after walking. Next, he led them into his garden, which was an∣swerable to the beauty and grandeur of the palace. it was of vast extent; and contained every thing in it that the Indies produce, a number of hills, and lesser eminences, adorned with groves, and all sorts of trees, rising here and there to the view, gave an inexpressible addition to the loveliness of the scene. Here they wandered, in separ∣ate companies, through allies, lawns, and groves, till a messenger arrived, and acquainted Prince Ny∣tan, the company, sent for, were in the palace. He, therefore, gathered his friends about him, and re∣turned with them to the hall: where, all being as∣sembled, they sat down to dinner. The young men and maidens, the servants appointed, by Ravenzar, to attend on Nytan, retired by his order, on some important business. Their services were never for mere ostentation. Prince Nytan, with Gesseng, waited on their guests; while cheerfulness and good humor enlivened the conversation. Here was an assembly worthy the contemplation of those superior beings, who, unseen, watch over mankind. They were the first inhabitants of a once solitary island; the founders of a community most illustrious and re∣spectable. The men had learned virtue and wis∣dom in the school of adversity. They were hardly passed the meridian of life; and through temper∣ance and proper exercise, were fast recovering their former strength, alertness and activity. Their minds were well informed, and capable of greater improve∣ments under the advantages they were now to obtain, with respect to which, Prince Nytan had as yet but
<PB N="66" REF="038495_0065_10122CE9F455E748"/>
executed a small part of his generous designs. Their persons were agreeable and commanded a great share of respect. The female part of this assembly, (whose number exceeded that of the men by one on∣ly, if we except Gesseng and the Prince,) might with strict justice be called perfect beauties. For, it seemed impossible that nature herself, with all her art and power, could add a greater lustre to her charms, or education to their accomplishments. It could, therefore, be no manner of wonder, if the men became fascinated with such an assemblage of female beauty, lustre and dignity. After they had dined, and separated to different apartments, one of the men, who used the greatest freedom with Prince Nytan, requested of him to be informed from what part of the creation he had drawn together such amazing prodigies of beauty and loveliness; and where they intended in future to dispose of them∣selves. 'Alas! exclaimed he, if they are to leave us, I know not what will become of us. For all my friends appear to be enamored beyond the pos∣sibility of recovery. When they left the hall and bid us adieu▪ every man of us was seized with de∣spair.'—'Oh! replied the prince, you talk indeed like a romantic lover! and if all your friends are in your situation, we shall hear of nothing but flames and darts, deadly wounds from cupid's fatal bow and quiver! sure nothing can be done for you, con∣tinued the Prince, laughing, in such desperate cir∣cumstances;—lost to every thing but love! but, if my friend, it be really as you say,—perhaps I have but one remedy for this sudden and violent storgee, and that is to hurry away those dangerous beauties as fast as possible.'</P>
<P>Prince Nytan had commissioned all the servants of Ravenzar to the subterranean palace, for seve∣ral things he should have occasion for among
<PB N="67" REF="038495_0066_10122CEC0ED4EBB8"/>
which the principal article was a large collection of books; the maiden servants were employed in household affairs. He now retired to his chamber in the palace; where he found the books ranged in good order on the shelves round his closet. Ex∣amining them he found they were a most valuable collection on every art and science, and the best his∣tories, many of them in the several languages he understood. He sat down at his closet window which looked into the spacious and magnificent gar∣den, limited only by the mountains that divided the island in two equal parts. The prospect before him was sublimely grand and beautiful, and adapted to excite, in a mind like his, the most noble and generous ideas. While he sat at the window in delightful contemplation, one of the servants entered to know his further commands. 'To-morrow said the Prince, you are to make a wide passage through the vast mountainous rocks that environ this island, and form a convenient and safe harbour for my ship. This done, you must complete a hundred more dwelling houses, with every thing needful about them. They are for my expected countrymen. Acquaint me when all is finished.'</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the new-rising city spent the afternoon in removing from their huts to the new buildings. The ladies, having apartments allotted them in the palace spent part of the time, after din∣ner, in viewing them, and the rest in roving in par∣ties, through the delicious garden. Gesseng, for his part, paid a visit to the solitary chamber, were he sat alone, meditating on the unrivalled charms of the youngest of the female orphans. She was a∣bout his own age, that is to say, nearly eighteen, and had made at first sight, the tenderest impres∣sions upon his heart. In short, every man except∣ing the Prince, had placed his affections on a lady.
<PB N="68" REF="038495_0067_10122CEDCFF4FDD0"/>
So that the one and thirty orphans were all sudden∣ly furnished with lovers, whom they likewise re∣garded with equal affection: and the result as will appear in the following book, was exceeding hap∣py for both parties.</P>

<P>THE happy company, at Nytan's palace, already noticed, walked in parties, in the garden. Sometimes they reclined on the green banks, shad∣ed by lofty pines and elms; at others, in delightful alcoves. On one side of the garden was a large and beautiful pavilion, situated on one of the highest hills, and the windows of which afforded the most en∣chanting prospects of woods and lawns, hills and val∣leys, fields and grazing cattle, of the river, and the new buildings. A stream of water ran winding by it, widening to the other side of the garden, part∣ly shaded with groupes of trees and was most pleas∣ant to view, from the palace windows. Nytan took with him to the pavilion, several of the men whom he chanced to meet, as he walked out; and who were converting with an equal number of ladies. Here the maidens brought them tea, wine, bread and fruit, with which likewise, the other parties were served, in the alcoves, and under the shades, where they were found reclining. In this manner they passed great par of several days successively. At night they were all assembled in the hall to sup∣per. In the mean time love ever active and enter∣prizing,
<PB N="70" REF="038495_0069_10122CF36238FC80"/>
was perpetually exerting itself, in all its various and refined arts of persuasion and endear∣ment, upon the hearts of the two sexes, whether in companies separate, in one assembly, or alone, in the recesses of the chamber, or the groves. Those with Nytan in the pavilion, were discerned by him to have made great progress in the tender, mutual affection which should ever precede the intimate and indissoluble tie of Hymen's bands. The con∣versation turned upon the refined and exalted plea∣sures of domestic life. The men, who had been well educated, discovered excellent minds, and just sentiments, in discoursing upon that subject. The ladies appeared to be exceedingly gratified by every thing they advanced. Nytan sung them a fine song, in praise of a domestic life, and the marriage state; and the company applauded him with the highest commendations. Several instruments of music were on one of the tables. The ladies, at the request of the Prince, took them in their fair hands, and hav∣ing tuned them, played several fine airs, accompanied with their charming voices. The men were in raptures! and prevailed upon them to gratify them over and over again with their inimitable perfor∣mances. This continued, till night brought all the company together in the hall. Gesseng was like∣wise returned to them. He had an unusual air of gaiety that night, and made swift advances in the af∣fections of the fair mistress of his heart. Supper being over, the remainder of the evening was spent in music and dancing and sprightly conversation, till the seasonable hour, of repose admonished them to retire to their several apartments. At parting the men signified, their intentions of lodging, in fu∣ture, in their new habitations. Nytan gave to each man two servants to attend upon him till they should hereafter be better provided for, on that score, as
<PB N="71" REF="038495_0070_10122CF4EF787740"/>
he told them with a great deal of gaiety. The men, however, continued their daily visits to the palace, to enjoy the charms of female conversation.</P>
<P>The six hundred houses, which Prince Nytan had ordered to be built, being compleatly finished, he took several of his workmen to his little chamber, which still remained where it first landed; and or∣dered them to erect a female statue on its roof, with a globe in one hand, and an olive branch in the oth∣er; and the emblematical dove on its head. The whole to be ornamented with gold and diamonds. This was done in half an hour, and made a grand and beautiful appearance. Nytan looked on the workmen with admiration, to see with what a∣stonishing rapidity, and consummate skill and ingenuity they worked off, and erected the stat∣ue; which being compleatly finished, seemed to be a real living existence, and to represent the Prince's sweet and amiable disposition, and peace and fe∣licity to the world: He, being perfectly satisied with the workmanship, immediately set all the workman to building houses, and laying out roads. Two, on each side his palace, were cut out through the mountains. And the river, which had many branches winding about the island, and which ran under the rocks into the ocean, was rendered navi∣gable, from the harbour two hundred miles, and within twenty of its source. Whilst these vast works were going on, our diligent philanthropist retired to his little chamber for the rest of the day, where he passed the time in reading till the sun was sitting. When, rising, and about to return to the palace, a splendid and beautiful picture came flut∣tering into the window, with a little cage of gold wire hanging to it, enclosing a fine blue-bird. The picture fixing itself on the wall of the chamber. o∣ver against the Prince, cried, 'O most excellent
<PB N="72" REF="038495_0071_10122CF6B4F33CA0"/>
Prince and chief mandarin of China! behold what a lovely bird I have brought you! I was commis∣sioned, with it to you, from my good aunt, the fai∣ry Perieng. The bird is to accompany you in your travels, and you will find it a very diverting com∣pany. You must hang the cage close to your win∣dow, that it may enjoy the sweet refreshing breezes, and the fine prospects. But, Prince, though it is now sun-set, you must take a trip with us to the i∣sland of pictures, and see how we live. There is no night there. However, you may easily get back to your palace before bed time.' 'Thank you, gracious, lovely picture! replied Nytan, for your sweet bird, as likewise for your kind invitation, of which I shall avail myself, and set out this mo∣ment.' So saying he set his chamber in motion through the air; and half an hour conveyed them to the island of pictures. But how greatly was the Prince astonished, to see there, a vast and magnifi∣cent palace, of an amazing height, and almost bound∣less dimensions! and illumined by four suns at each corner of the lofty open roof! which dart∣ed a spendor beyond mortal suffrance! but Prince Nytan was, for a while, rendered capable of endur∣ing it. They descended into the court, and walked up to the grand porch.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">This is not unlike some mysterious descriptions of the affairs of the superior order of beings.

<P>This island was famous for nothing besides the palace, and its inhabitants, in a vast wood, the mis∣tress of which was the fairy Perieng, who was sev∣eral
<PB N="73" REF="038495_0072_10122CF8D4461FE0"/>
thousand years old. The pictures of the palace were wives of Genies, who though good genies, were, for some little inadvertences, sentenced to a state of gentle discipline, and banishment from their consorts, who were stationary in the vast hall of the palace, in a state of contemplative confinement, till their husbands should be restored to them. Some∣times indeed they were allowed to make excursions a∣broad, or were sent on important errants, at which times they were to take special care not to fall asleep, lest some disagreeable accident should befall them; as was the case with the one Nytan picked up from a miry canal, somewhat disfigured, but still retain∣ing its internal lustre. The fairy Perieng was her aunt, and all the others were her relations. Hence it was that she took care of them, and was al∣ways attentive to their fortunes, and happy in their rational improvements, and progress in virtue and wisdom. She gave them the form of pictures, likewise, in compliment to her sex as the fairest part of the creation. Some of them, in their ex∣cursions, went through a variety of adventures be∣fore they could get back again to the palace, and their happier stations in the hall.</P>
<P>After they had gone through the grand porch, they beheld before them an old lady, of very dimin∣utive size, (for such was her destined figure for two hundred years,) standing at the foot of her throne, waiting their approach. It was the fairy Perieng. 'I wanted much to see you young man, said she to Prince Nytan. Follow me into my closet. Then sending away the picture, on some new errand, she ushered the Prince into her closet, where the con∣tinued with him in conversation for the space of three hours and an half, giving him many sage counsels for the direction of his future conduct.
<PB N="74" REF="038495_0073_10122CFB72384320"/>
She then carried him into the great hall, where ev∣ery thing he saw, was amazing, and past adequate description. The walls were looking-glass mixed with flames of fire. In these were the pictures fix∣ed, in frames of fire, gold and diamonds; appear∣ing every moment, of the pictures, the living orig∣inals, and that, with a splendor too dazzling for the eyes of mortals. They sang several charming songs, complimenting the Prince, and his blue-bird. The hall being wholly open above, the splendors of the palace overpowered the Prince, and he fainted. The fairy Perieng therefore ordered her servants to convey him to his chamber, where coming to him∣self, he heard the voice of the Fairy—'Return quick∣ly, beloved Prince, and prosperity attend thee.</P>
<P>The Prince found his blue-bird very merry com∣pany on the way home. 'But what am I to do? sweet bird, cried he, as the chamber rested on the ground in its former station, will you suffer me to take you with me to my palace?' 'O by no means, replied the bird. But I will tell you how to please me. Transport the chamber into your garden, in some obscure grove, there to remain invisible to ev∣ery one but yourself: and come and see me every day, and as often, each day as possible. I shall then be very well contented, with the window and door of the chamber left open, and something to eat and drink.' 'I will do every thing you shall de∣sire,' returned Nytan,—'Then love me excessively, rejoined the blue-bird, and I will sing you the most charming and diverting songs in the world, and tell you the finest stories, when you shall be in∣clined to hear me.' 'Which will be as often as possible, added Nytan, for you talk, and look so en∣chantingly, that nothing can please me like your sweet company.' 'Ah! returned the blue-bird. I wish with all my heart you may never be weary of
<PB N="75" REF="038495_0074_10122CFD89F9C988"/>
me.' 'Heaven forbid exclaimed the Prince, such excellence should perish! and now my charming prattler! we are in the place of your choice. See what a lovely grove of trees and fragrant flowers surround us, except the little opening before your window, which commands some of the finest views of the garden. What further orders have you for your devoted friend?' 'Go, answered the bird, to your company in the hall, bid them good night, and go to bed, and dream of your little lovely blue-bird till morning.' 'I will obey you to the utmost of my power, replied the Prince and so sweet lovely bird, good night.' Good night, good night, cried the blue-bird: adieu charming young man, adieu!</P>
<LG>
<L>Dream all the night, and only dream of me,</L>
<L>And, if I sleep, I'm sure to dream of thee.'</L>
</LG>
<P>Prince Nytan was shewn, by the fairy Perieng, several most valuable curiosities, among which was a most ancient Chinese manuscript, tracing that em∣pire to its original, and relating many great and wonderful things of which the world is ignorant. She promised him, the manuscript should be put in∣to his possession, after a cerrtain number of years. 'Be very careful and tender of the little blue-bird I sent you, added the Fairy; and you may one day, find your account in it, and know further than you can at present, how much your powerful friends are interested in your happiness and prosperity. To-morrow, you must go to the palace of libraries, and load your chamber with the best books compos∣ed by Genies and Fairies, and likewise, by men of the greatest learning and experience. There, also, you will find many finely wrote books by learned and ingenious women. Those you have divide among the men and women you have with you. You will
<PB N="76" REF="038495_0075_10122CFFA0992760"/>
find no difficulty in gaining admission into the pal∣ace: here are the keys.</P>
<P>The next morning, the Prince furnished his men with a further supply of books from his own col∣lection, and set out with his chamber and blue-bird, for the palace of libraries. He spent several hours there, examining the books. Each distinct libra∣ry was composed by one author only. Having load∣ed his chamber, leaving scarcely room for himself and the blue-bird, (which entertained and charmed him all the while, with its sweet melody and con∣versation,) they returned before sun-set. The morn∣ing following he supplied his friends with books. Then taking his spying-glass, he went up to the roof of his palace, and looked out for his expected ship; though the time was far from being elapsed which he had allowed for the voyage, yet he knew not with what expedition the Emperor might trans∣act his affairs. Besides, he had a mind to see his father and the family. He viewed the palace—the grand metropolis and all the great cities, as far as the glass could afford the prospect. At length, he saw the spacious windows of his father's breakfast∣ing apartment open, the Emperor, Empress, his sisters, and several other ladies enter and seat them∣selves at the breakfast table. They all appeared to be very merry and in good health; which gave the sincerest pleasure to so affectionate and dutiful son. After viewing them again and again, he was obliged to deny himself of so delightful a gratification, and descend to look after his important affairs. He of∣ten made use of his glass, and never failed of seeing his friends in good health, rendering thanks to Heaven for so desirable a privilege, when so far separated from his paternal home. The Prince frequently took Gesseng with him to his closet, for several hours, and like wife the men,
<PB N="77" REF="038495_0076_10122D013974B998"/>
three or four at a time, that they might consult to∣gether on affairs of consequence to their future pros∣perity. And they were all daily employed, besides, in the most useful studies.</P>
<P>In the mean time his little blue bird was not ne∣glected. There was an inchanting sweetness in its tongue, which often drew him to the cage. In honor to his lovely bird, which was perpetually talking and singing of love, he erected, on the roof of the little chamber, at the four corners, cupids of gold, whose spread-out wings were studded with diamonds, as were the architives of the door and window. So that the whole outside of the chamber being gold and diamonds, made a most splended and glorious appearance; especially when open to the sun. Whereas, to gratify the favorite bird, it was now concealed in a retired grove. The Prince took his bird out to view those ornaments. He was anxious to know whether, (as she examined them with apparent eagerness and surprise,) they afford∣ed an additional pleasure to his sweet companion. 'My dear Prince, said the blue-bird, you have highly honored me, and convinced me more than ever of your friendship. Ah Prince! let us make us friends to the utmost, whilst in this state of ex∣istence; for, if we gain no friends here, we can by no means expect to find them on our appearance in the future world. You have many and valuable friends. Go, Prince, hasten and make us as many as you can. We can never possess too many worthy heorts. Gain them in every region. Your talents, your accomplishments, your engaging person and manners, your divine philanthropy; these will ev∣ery where commend you to the great and good.'</P>
<P>At length, the expected ship arrived. From the lofty roof of his palace, Nytan with joy beheld her safe moored in the harbour. He beheld and recog∣nized
<PB N="78" REF="038495_0077_10122D045FF25840"/>
the countenances of his beloved countrymen, and hastened in his chariot to the shore; leaving orders for twenty chariots to follow him. His friends were quickly advertised of this arrival, and wanted no other summons to follow their beloved benefactor. What a glorious scene was it to see this noble son of Renien embracing and congratu∣lating his countrymen, though the poorest in all his fathers extensive empire! They were men, women and children; and though poor, yet wisely selected. Not a few among them, possessed knowledge and virtue, in a very eminent degree, though hitherto unfortunate, through various causes. They were conducted, some to the palace, others to the houses of the inhabitants; besides large tents were imme∣diately erected, that every individual might be a∣greeably accommodated. Feasts and entertainments now succeeded each other every day. The mer∣chandize of the ship was conveyed from the har∣bour, and divided among the new settlers, who now became rich. At length they were conducted to their new-prepared habitations, with their posses∣sions in chariots, and other convenient carriages, attended by Prince Nytan, Gesseng, and a few of their friends; the new roads being compleatly laid out and finished for easy travelling. This was in∣deed a pleasant journey to them all, through a fine country, abounding with every thing, and which might well be called the garden of the world. The Prince and his friends continued with them several days, when all being settled to their wishes and far beyond their most sanguine expectations;—the Prince returned to be witness to a new and unex∣pected scene of wonder and joy. As he came within view of his palace, and the thirty new buildings, he was surprised to see the spacious openings crowd∣ed with men, women and children, who, by their
<PB N="79" REF="038495_0078_10122D05EE50C7F0"/>
dress appeared to be of foreign countries. He knew too much to fear an invasion, nor was he long in de∣termining by what means so vast a multitude of people had found their way into an island guarded by powers that no human wit or force could suc∣cessfully oppose. He, therefore justly concluded his friendly fairies and Genies had brought some worthy settlers to replenish it. This was indeed the case. A messenger on horseback, rode up to the prince, and acquainted him that Ravenzar wait∣ed for him in the hall of his palace. As he was hastening thither with the utmost expedition, he soon distinguished his friend the Genie, by the dig∣nity and benevolence of his countenance, advancing from the outer court of the palace to meet him. Ny∣tan alighted from his chariot. They were instant∣ly in each other's arms. After many endearing ca∣resses, the Prince presented to him Gesseng, and his other friends, whom the Genie cordially embraced. Shouts arose from the chariots—' For ever live the great Ravenzar, and the all accomplished Nytan! Hail! happy friends and inhabitants of this highly favored island! in true glory and splendor forever flourish!—The two friends, and those about them, bowed to the people, and then went up into the hall, where the orphan ladies, and their attendants, received them with joyful congratulations. An entertainment was soon prepared, at which they all sat down, and every countenance expressed the most heartfelt pleasure. The conversation at table, was gay and lively, and becoming guests so worthy, so all-accomplished. After eating and conversing a∣while, the company retired to the garden to walk; all but the two illustrious friends, who remained, conversing in the hall till towards evening, when Ravenzar went down into the subterranean palace. The new settlers, who were no less than eighteen
<PB N="80" REF="038495_0079_10122D0781C199A8"/>
thousand, were accommodated with magnificent tents, served with every thing for which they had occasion, besides the best provisions the island afford∣ed. This multitude, of all ages and sexes, had been long training up, by good fairies and genies, in ru∣ral recesses, and subterranean palaces, for this fa∣vored island; this happy asylum from a world of vice, luxury and oppression. A fleet, of twelve vast ships, wafted them to the abodes of peace, freedom and virtue.—The genie Ravenzar retired not mere∣ly to rest, but to provide for the new inhabitants. He, therefore, who could easily perform the great∣est things, caused his immense palace, with its buildings and gardens, to immerge from the bowels of the earth, and form themselves into four spacious streets, of elegant buildings. His gardens were divided into a great many, and one to each dwelling∣house. Besides, a great number of houses were built, gardens laid out, and all compleatly finished that very night. So that, in the morning, the fam∣ilies had nothing to hinder them from taking posses∣sion of their new habitations, and preparing to en∣ter upon their several occupations. Ravenzar hav∣ing very early given them notice, and ordered eight hundred servants to assist them in conveying to their houses, their wives, children, and goods; before sun-set they were all happily settled. The Genie then repaired to the palace, and requested Prince Nytan to assemble, in the hall, the thirty original inhabitants, with the one and thirty orphan ladies. He then seated himself at the upper end of the hall, waiting their attendance. When they were all as∣sembled, together with Gesseng and the Prince, Ravenzar addressed them in the following speech:</P>
<P>'Respectable and beloved friends! as I am un∣der the necessity of leaving you in a few hours, I have called you together, that I may fulfil the re∣maining
<PB N="81" REF="038495_0080_10122D09A6D9FFC8"/>
offices of friendship and love, which are to conduce to the perfection of your future felicity. Myself and my worthy frend and fellow labourer, Nytan, have been constantly attentive to every thing that might effectually conduce to your happi∣ness and glory. You will, from henceforward, be left a long time to yourselves, to form agreeably to your wishes, a perfect happy nation, which will encrease, in strength and efficacy, through every succeeding age. Our beloved Nytan, must visit other countries. Yet, still, though absent from you, we shall be attentive to your interest. The great power and abilities, with which I am invest∣ed, must be in perpetual exertion: it is my happi∣ness that they should be so;—whilst I soar on high, invisible to mortals, or visit every region of the hab∣itable world; promoting as much as possible, its welfare, and defeating the nefarious plots of its en∣emies. I boast not of my powers. Having noth∣ing but what I derive from the benificence of Hea∣ven.—Should the Supreme withhold his benign in∣fluence, I must soon be bereft of all my worth and abilities; even become unworthy the attention of the lovely, amiable children I snatched from ruin, and nurtured; whose minds I have formed to vir∣tue, and adorned with every valuable accomplish∣ment. Let our eyes be ever directed to the author of our existence, and from whom we derive every blessing. Let unfeigned virtue, and true glory be our invariable practice and pursuit. True glory is founded only in the works of benificence and love; in these it will be impossible for us to con∣tinue, without the sacred energy of the glorious Al∣mighty Being, whose we are. In him, therefore, let us place the most unreserved confidence. His power will support, his wisdom will direct, his love
<PB N="82" REF="038495_0081_10122D0C4C452CA0"/>
will render us compleatly blessed.—You, the first inhabitants of this fertile and delightful island.; you only, of all the happy thousands that have arrived here to live with you as brethren; you, I say, are the only persons destitute of female partners for life, and, of consequence, your happiness is far from be∣ing compleat. But this must be no longer. Take, then, the partners your eyes have already selected. They stand before you. Take, each of you, the fair ones hand you have chosen; their hearts I know, are yours.'—He ceased speaking.—Each man then advanced to the fair orphans, and took the hand he had chosen;—Nothing loth.—Ra∣venzar then proceeded:—'One is yet left solitary. My admired, and loved Gesseng, she is yours. I know her to be the choice of your heart.'—Take then the fair one's hand.—Gesseng was not long in obeying.—The attendants were witnesses to their mutual vows of constancy and love, and the Genie pronounced each couple married in the sight of Heaven. Each saluted his bride. The two friends congratulated them, and gave them their blessing. Their attendants followed their example: and mirth and festivity concluded the day, and the evening. The day following, too, was a day of general feasting and congratulation; and perfect felicity reigned throughout the whole island; if we except the poor solitary blue-bird, concealed in the grove. All the rest of the birds were hap∣py.—O Prince! could you not have found a place, at least, in one of the hall windows, for so lovely and beautiful a bird, whose sweet notes out-rivalled all the songsters of the grove! Hasten Prince! you can do no less than carry the merry tidings to your lovely travelling companion. She will welcome you with a thousand caresses!—The truth is, the little blue-bird chose rather to remain in its retire∣ment; and was sufficiently content with visits from
<PB N="83" REF="038495_0082_10122D0E6448DD38"/>
the Prince, two or three times a day, with some∣thing for it to eat, and the sight of his engaging per∣son.</P>
<P>These mariages being happily consummated, the Genie Ravenzar departed; and the newly arrived families being most advantageously settled in dif∣ferent parts of the island, most of them applied themselves to agriculture and manufactures. In∣structors, of both sexes, were appointed for the children. A magnificent hall was erected, for pub∣lic business. Legislators were chosen; a council of Elders, and a President. Laws and regulations established. A book of records was kept in the hall chamber. In a word, every thing necessary, and advantageous, was established with the most consummate wisdom. The leading men were of the thirty first inhabitants; (who had made large ad∣ditions to the knowledge and discernment they bro't with them into the island,) and likewise, of those who were from the Empire of China. The best instructors were chosen for the youth, from fifteen years of age to twenty—who were educated in the principles of virtue and liberty, and every art and science. The grand metropolis was called Xun∣tien,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Xuntien, alias Pekin. The former name was a∣dopted.</NOTE> after that of China. To the houses of the first inhabitants, (who now took their wives home) were added, by the servants of the Genie, two thou∣sand, as yet unimproved, being reserved for the Chinese whom Gesseng, (now ambassador to China) was commissioned to bring in the fleet, which was to sail immediately for that kingdom of splendor.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">A modern name for China, is said to be Tamin, i. e. the Kingdom of Brightness.</NOTE> Those houses, with the thirty belonging to the first
<PB N="84" REF="038495_0083_10122D0FF3F92918"/>
inhabitants and the great number erected by Ra∣venzar, now composed the first city and grand me∣tropolis of the island, containing, at this period, twenty thousand buildings all inhabited, except those reserved for the Chinese expected.</P>
<P>Gesseng having sailed with the fleet, Prince Ny∣tan took a solemn and affectionate leave of his nu∣merous friends, assembled in the public hall, in a valedictory address, which he concluded with the following solemn and truly interesting words:—</P>
<P>'We who are so highly favored—we, who are so eminently enlightened, can never fail in the resolves we have formed, to seek those pleasures to indulge those gratificatioas, to pursue those schemes of life only which Heaven approves. Every in∣dulgence contrary to this, we well know to be ir∣rational, and must tend to the subverssion of the un∣paralleled tranquility, health and happiness we en∣joy. Heaven's high will is our felicity. Its will therefore must be ours, so long as conscious recti∣tude of heart is known to insure our bliss. Yes: rectitude will ever distinguish and ennoble our ac∣tions; the will of the Supreme will be ever our guide.</P>
<P>'Many of us, (in preceding years, in the coun∣tries which gave us birth,) have been sated to con∣test with men who would have deprived us of free∣dom and enslaved our minds. But we have been di∣vinely taught to think and act as becomes the free∣born children of the Highest; and our liberties and privileges are here perfectly secure from invasion. Let all our actions unchangeably evince our grate∣ful hearts.</P>
<LG>
<L>Heaven is guide, our guardian friend,</L>
<L>Whose richest favors know no end:</L>
<L>So let our love forever prove;</L>
<L>And all in sweetest concert move!</L>
</LG>
<P><PB N="85" REF="038495_0084_10122D12C8F1EEA8"/>
'Let us be ever pointing out to each other, in every sublime view, the unrivalled beauties of pure virtue, the transporting pleasures of undissembled love and benevolence, while a strict uniform, invariable temperance, insures to us all the bliss of which our natures are capable.</P>
<P>'We are now become a nation;—a nation col∣lected indeed, by Divine Providence, from many others;—a nation trained and disciplined to real virtue. Such we shall continue, if we cease not to reverence ourselves. For we shall think with a∣version and abhorrence of every vice. No more shall any of us glory in infamy and court destruc∣tion, as in other countries which celestial interposi∣tion alone can save. Alas! to what a plight are some of them reduced! to what inexplicable mise∣ries are they swiftly hastening! they are struggling in fires that will shortly consume them, unless pre∣vented by the kind interference of the gracious pow∣er. But I go, citizens to plead with them. I shall remind them of the dignity of their origin; and shew them how beautiful they will look, when adorned with real goodness. To many I shall say, (and many I shall convince) the truly happy, worthy and illustrious, are the virtuous, the generous and the benevolent. It is such the Creator loves, approves and blesses;—the tender, sympathizing hearts in sacred unison with his own, by virtue sweetly form∣ed. Many, (I shall say) have harangued finely on religion, benevolence, humanity, who in the prac∣tice of them were errant cowards. And who are more mean and dastardly than those, that, with all their fine speeches, pious and benevolent pretensions, be∣hold unmoved their fellow-creatures suffering a∣round and in the midst of them; yea, add to their miseries by their oppressive measures! what kind
<PB N="86" REF="038495_0085_10122D1569617D98"/>
of religion is that, without bowels of compassion? ye vile pretenders to goodness! shrink and hide your heads forever; or, yet become worthy the human forms ye wear! Whence, (I shall add) whence arise the greatest distresses among mankind, but from the selfish contemptible tempers of the powerful and rich among you? when we can brave∣ly deny ourselves to serve the indigent and reclaim the vicious; when we can give up our ardent pur∣suits of ambition and sensuality, and persevere, a∣against all embarrassments, in promoting the good of every individual, however low and debased:—when we can thus nobly live to the creation, we shall wear, with real honor, the name of men, of a specious gloriously formed, by omnipotence and love, for the true enjoyment of existence. But your ignoble ideas, your churlish disposition, your detes∣table pride and vanity, your vices, of every kind, place you below the brutal creation. Nay; the most noisome and loathsome of the inferior tribes of existence are far more excellent than you. If there be a spark of goodness buried among you, let it e∣merge from the darkness and ruin in which it hath been so long involved. Awake to real honour and glory! and become brilliant constellations in the unsullied galaxy of the virtuous sons and daughters of freedom and truth, whose splendors illuminate the world, and are as unfading as the day of Heav∣en! Experience the exalted pleasures of undissem∣bled virtue and benevolence, and henceforward la∣bor to do good, to render others happy. The gen∣erous labors of love, while they exalt and refine you for the high and grand enjoyments of immortals, will likewise add the greatest strength and glory to your national interests, and evince, in the most il∣lustrious point of view, how dear they are to Heav∣en.'</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="038495_0086_10122D16F69D27C8"/>
'In this manner, citizens, shall I inculcate sa∣cred interesting truths in the Countries to which I am called. As for us, confirmed as we are in the enjoyment of virtue, freedom and truth, we shall act like those who rightly estimate their value: and, respecting, adoring and loving the benificent author of our being we shall love and respect each other as the wonderful and glorious workmanship of his hands, reared into existence, and clothed with his comeli∣ness, to be ever glorious and amiable in his eyes and in the eyes of each other. And let the ennobling disposition, which we have embibed, be uniformly cherished;—of preferring one another in both men∣tal and civil eminences;—in wealth, in honor:—a disposition so opposite to the low, mean, selfish tempers that are so prevalent in other nations;—well knowing it to be our chief business, and high∣est good, to promote every one's happiness, that not a single sigh of infelicity be heard. This truly phi∣lanthropic dispossition builds us up in real grandeur, advancing us nearer to the perfection of that Heav∣en from whence it originates. Let, therefore, this sweet harmony and love increase which perfects our enjoyment of life, enhancing all its variety of genuine pleasures—ensuring to us still greater.</P>
<P>Our intercourse with other nations will be pre∣scribed by that divine power on which we feel our∣selves continually dependant, whilst we, at the same time, glory in such dependance; that power which we always consult with a filial confidence; and are happy indeed—Dear citizens—in every application the gracious being who ever takes delight in doing us good. No nation, or hostile power can harm us. But we can do the nations much good, and are per∣petually employed in serving their best interests: and, one day hence, will they all unite to bless us, and to follow those divine examples we are singled
<PB N="88" REF="038495_0087_10122D19651D9E10"/>
out to exhibit to the world: singled out, not be∣cause more deserving, but because it was the will of Him, whose ways are unsearchable!</P>
<P>'As indulgent Heaven, then, hath felicitated us with genuine truth, with real knowledge and high attainments, to us, I trust, they will be always in∣valuable; while from hence science shall, with in∣creasing lustre, spread over the face of the globe.—From us, who are ever, with superior aids, employ∣ed in diffusing her benign rays; and in which em∣ployment our enemies do in vain oppose us. Still will she advance in her glorious and majestic prog∣ress; rending in sunder the chains that enslave the mind, and breaking in pieces the fetters fabricated by the proud politician, and the aspiring priest.—Celestial traveller! we triumph in thy conquests, and cordially do we congratulate' each society and happy individual irradiated by thy splendors, and participating of the rich and liberal munificence thou art from Heaven commissioned every where to dispense! In vain, with malignant purpose, do thy adversaries set themselves in array against thee, in a distant region, where thousands have highly ex∣perienced by generous influence, and where thou∣sands of thousands wait thy salutary instructions. Such is the regard bestowed on man, by the source of goodness!—Man—Heaven's fairest image! too precious, in its estimation, to lie for ever in the chains of ignorance—to remain forever insensible of worth richly bestowed!—Man! how ennobled doth he appear! how august! when beheld adorned in his Creator's comeliness! how exquisitely divine his formation! ten thousand glories beam from his irradiated countenanance, and gracefully display themselves in his every gesture—his every move∣ment!—Let deserved infamy pursue those sacrilig∣ious aspersers that have dared the impious attempt
<PB N="89" REF="038495_0088_10122D1B54676F38"/>
to divest him of his celestial privileges, to villify his nature, to profane his sacred rights, and precip∣itate him to the debasing form of a wretch subject∣ed to the caprice of an unprincipled being swelled with pride and self importance!—I go cheerfully my dearest friends and fellow citizens, in your ser∣vice—in the service of mankind; and oppose my∣self against all that is inimical to human felicity!</P>

<P>THE king of Persia at his decease, having no other child than a daughter, left her the heir of his dominions. She was possessed of a superior understanding and incomparable beauty. Her en∣gaging manners and shining accomplishments had attracted universal love and respect. It was, there∣fore, with universal satisfaction the people saw her ascend the throne of Persia. Every day she gave fresh proofs of her superior talents, wisdom and prudence, and though scarce two and twenty, her illustrious actions raised her a fame beyond any of her predecessors; and drew to her court, princes of the neighbouring kingdoms, who solicited her hand; but in vain. Her affections being engaged, she had neither a hand nor a heart to yield them. Those princes, therefore, gave over their solicitations, and returned home with disappointment and chagrin. One of them carried his resentment so far, as to enter the Queen's dominions with a great army, which spread ruin and devastation wherever it advan∣ced. The Queen opposed this destroying power with all the force she could raise in an emergency so sudden and unexpected. But victory was decid∣ing in favor of her enemy, when Prince Nytan ar∣rived on the confines of her dominions, where he
<PB N="91" REF="038495_0090_10122D209B83A3E0"/>
soon became informed of those unjust and cruel dep∣redations. 'I must go, said he to his blue-bird, and chastise this invader, if Heaven condescends, to aid my arm.' 'Go, replied the blue-bird, and when you have succeeded, marry the Queen of Per∣sia, and bring her hither, that I may see a Princess of whom I heard so much talk. I shall wait impa∣tiently for you, and may prosperity attend you.' 'Ah! fair and beautiful bird! (if such thou really art) I shall have no fancy to marry any Queens, whilst I can enjoy thy sweet company. What bird ever sang, ever talked like thee? I was never half so well entertained and charmed!' Such was the Prince's return to the blue-bird; which he had long before conjectured to be more than a mere bird; though who, or what, he was still at a loss. 'Well, rejoined the blue-bird, dear flattering Prince! has∣ten away to the succour of the oppressed, and re∣turn quickly to the bird who best loves you.' 'If so, returned he, I have the highest reason to be satis∣fied. But, tell me most accomplished lady! (for such I have long esteemed thee,) wherefore this transformation, and this reserve of some impor∣tant secret to your loving and faithful friend, whom you say, too, you love? Why was you sent to me? was it that fate had decreed I should be in∣strumental to your resuming your proper person? or, are you cruelly banished, in this shape, from all you hold dear? forgive me, if I have, in any re∣spect, acted unbecoming your merits; and no long∣er conceal from me your true name, and the myste∣ry of this transformation. I have been purchasing some lands here, with an elegant house, in which I have furnished you an apartment for the night; se∣lecting another for myself in a distant part of the house; that I may not be wanting in shewing you the difference and respect you justly merit. I am
<PB N="92" REF="038495_0091_10122D2281095D98"/>
now ready to convey you to your apartment. In my absence, (which I hope will be but a few hours) three young women will attend you, whom I have bribed largely to be faithful to the trust I have re∣posed in them.'—What is all this fine speech to a poor little blue-bird? exclaimed the bird. How∣ever take me, if you please to the apartment you have provided for me.' 'Alas! resumed Prince Ny∣tan, think not to deceive me, I know too well what for a bird thou art; yet lovely in whatever shape you are pleased to assume.' 'As to my name, re∣turned the blue-bird which you desire to know, as, likewise who, or what I am, I am not permitted, dear Prince, to inform you till your return with victory'—'And to lay my laurels at your feet, interrupted the Prince. 'Shew me, resumed the bird, the house; O! is not that it yonder, and my apartment with the windows open? Make no re∣ply, noble mandarin! but hasten quickly, to fight the battle of God and mankind. You have not a moment to delay. Thus saying she flew out of her window, and the Prince saw her enter that of her new apartment.' Therefore, fixing his magic spear in its place, directed towards the field of war, which he had reconnoitred with his glass, his chamber mounted aloft in the air, and its splendors glittered to the sun.</P>
<P>When Prince Nytan was arrived to the martial field, he found the Persians almost vanquished and surrounded by the enemy. With sword in hand he soon fought his way through the thickest of his op∣posers; joined and rallied the Persian army, and in less than an hour, obtained a compleat victory; taking the Prince, and twenty thousand prisoners.—'Go, said the victorious son of Renien to the captive Prince, and by afflictions, learn humanity and virtue. To you, humiliation and sufferings are
<PB N="93" REF="038495_0092_101224D16CFD6138"/>
necessary; while, at the same time, they are ren∣dered glorious to me, only as an instrument in the hand of the uncontrouled Sovereign of the Universe, to bring good out of evil. Sooner or later, O haugh∣ty and impetuous Prince! we must all learn justice and mercy. It is impossible it should be otherwise. When you have been taught to think with me, we shall perhaps, meet again.' Having said thus, a∣greeable to Ravenzar's counsel, he ordered the roy∣al prisoner to be chained in a dark room, and, treat∣ed as a madman, till the public affairs of Persia were settled. Then he was to be banished human society, and conveyed into a vast forest, far distant from the kingdom, which, by his manners, he had disgraced and forfeited. 'We take no lives, added the hero; nor hath one been lost. We seek the reformation, not the annihilation of our brethren of mankind; whom God hath taught us to respect and love, and to live but for their good.</P>
<P>Having ordered the numerous prisoners, to be con∣fined, and guarded, till it should be determined in council, in what manner they were to be disposed of; Prince Nytan hastened to seek the Queen.—But no queen was to be found. This caused a great alarm, and excited the deepest concern. For the queen Selina, was loved by all, almost to adoration. She had gone abroad on pretence of hunting and retured not. Her attendants, suddenly missing her, searched every where in vain;—returned to the pal∣ace with the melancholy tidings;—with great num∣bers they went back to the forest renewing their search after their Queen; in which they were conti∣nally employed. The astonished hero dispatched a still greater number on the same important errand; and taking leave of the officers of the army, only for the night, hastened to his expecting bird. 'Wel∣come,
<PB N="94" REF="038495_0093_10122D26AD570670"/>
brave Nytan! I see victory triumphs in your countenance: and yet something appears to disturb you. How is the Queen of Persia?' 'Alas replied he, I know not. The Queen is missing, and no where to be found. Early must I go in quest of her.'—'Hardly so, answered the voice of one en∣tering the apartment. The Prince turned and be∣held the Fairy of the island of pictures advancing to the blue-bird which descended from the corner of a soffa, (where it was sitting) to meet her. Be∣fore that Prince Nytan had time to speak, the fairy Perieng, touched the bird gently with her wand. She had no sooner spoken, when, instead of a little blue-bird, a most charming lady, and of a majestic countenance, appeared before them, arrayed in a robe of sky-blue satin, and her head adorned with a crown of gold and diamonds!—'There cried the Fairy Perieng, is the Queen you would go in quest of. Carry home to her palace and marry her. But stay, on second thought, I will go with you. Fetch hither thy chamber. For this purpose, am I come to give you Queen Selina in marriage, and to make merry with you on so happy on occasion. Let us hasten, then to put and end to the grief of the most loyal subjects, who deplore their beloved Queen as lost.' Nytan soon brought his chamber to the Fairy and Queen; who entering with him, they were in a minute, at the gate of the Queen's palace. When the Queen appeared before her household and those of the nobility and ladies, who were at the palace, their joy was unbounded! The glad tidings soon circulated far and wide, and thousands flocked to the palace to bless their eyes with a sight of their beloved Queen whose absence they had so deeply regretted, and whom they had almost given over as irrecoverably lost! The Queen conducted her vic∣torious hero and lover, with the fairy Perieng, to
<PB N="95" REF="038495_0094_10122D294B06E428"/>
her great hall, and placed them on her throne. The hall was immediately crowded with the nobility and ladies, and vast numbers of others, congratulating their Queen, and bestowing a thousand blessings on Prince Nytan, who sat by her side. The dignity, majesty, and benevolence that shone forth in the countenance of the fairy Perieng excited their pro∣foundest respect and esteem. They bowed to the ground before her; when, rising from her seat, she thus addressed the numerous and joyful assembly.—'My worthy and respected friends! In the hero before you, I present you the son of Renien, sove∣reign of the vast Empire of China; the illustrious son, of an illustrious father, who has been, so many years, every where celebrated for wisdom, virtue, bril∣liant accomplishments an dinnumerable great and be∣nevolent actions. The son is worthy to share, with your Queen; the throne of Persia; your Queen, an inestimable gift of Heaven to you, and the man who found worthy of her hand. That man is the valorous Prince before you,—Prince Nytan, who in one happy moment, has turned away destruction from your kindom, and restored to you your belov∣ed Queen. They have sometime loved, though un∣known to each other; however mysterious my words may appear to you. Superior powers direct∣ed their destiny. Since, then, it is the will of the Supreme, let their hands be united, whose hearts are already one. And, long may they live, under the guidance of Heaven, to diffuse blessings through Persia; and far and wide wherever their influence is, in future times, to extend.' The speech of the fairy Perieng was received with universal approba∣tion, and acclamations of joy. The marriage was, that day, solemnized; and great rejoicings were made throughout the kingdom, with feastings, which lasted a whole month. Prince Nytan's wonderful
<PB N="96" REF="038495_0095_10122D2AF85A0E50"/>
chamber was placed on a pleasant hill in the Queen's garden, in a grove, till his further occasions should call for it. But, that which was very surprising to the Prince, was, to find the Queen's palace and garden exactly like those at Ravenzar. The apart∣ments of the palace, the courts, the avenues;—in a word, he could find nothing about the palace and gardens, within or without but what, was as much like those in Ravenzar, as if the one was copi∣ed from the other. So that when the Queen introduced him to the chamber for his private re∣tirement, he imagined himself suddenly and insen∣sibly transported to his own in the island. Like∣wise, when he entered the closet, and looked out of the window, and viewed the lovely prospect, he coudl not refrain crying out to the Queen, 'Why, Selina, can you explain to me these phenomena. Am I in my own palace, or am I not? if not, never was there, in every thing, so perfect a resem∣blance. The chamber, its furniture, the closet, books, garden, hills, groves, and the whole prospect, have the most perfect likeness! How can all this possibly be? 'I can account for these wonderful things, (answered the fairy Perieng, entering the closet) much better, I believe, than your Queen. It is the work of Ravenzar, who foreseeing every thing, ordered his servants to build, and finish off your palace and gardens exactly like those of your Selina; that you who so greatly resemble her in person and accomplishments, might resemble her in every thing else.' 'How much replied the Prince, am I in all things obliged to that great and good Genie! one might be almost ready to think, continued the Prince, that Ravenzar was as much in love with Selina—'As who? interrupted the fai∣ry, I hope you are not going to be jealous. How∣every, it is easy to see, that one who has been in love,
<PB N="97" REF="038495_0096_10122D2D15F72758"/>
and who takes such infinite pleasure in obliging his friends, must well know the delight lovers take in forming every thing to each other's fancy. And, as the Queen's palace, and garden's were unrivalled in beauty and perfection, how could he better oblige you both than by taking care, that those of yours should want in nothing of the original from which they are copied?' 'Dear fairy, returned Prince Nytan, you inflame my love and gratitude, to my worthy benefactor to the highest pitch.' 'Well, re∣joined the fairy Perieng, I foresee, it will not be a great many months, before Queen Selina's curiosi∣ty will conduct her to Ravenzar, that she may ex∣amine with her own eyes so perfect a copy of her own taste in building and laying out magnificent gardens. For, I can assure you, that all you find here, was built and compleated by her own direc∣tions. Her father's buildings being old and de∣cayed, all was renewed, and the gardens enlarged and laid out as you see them. Besides, the more you shall examine, the greater will be your convic∣tion of the perfect likeness.'</P>
<P>They sat down at the closet window, and con∣versed a great while, on the beauties of the prospect and the grand and magnificent appearance of the distant mountains. Here they examined four cas∣kets, whose contents were of immense value in jew∣els and interesting papers. They were presents from the fairy, containing memoirs, delightful, en∣tertaining and instructive.</P>
<P>The fairy Perieng, having spent above a month with the new married pair, and seen Prince Ny∣tan established, with Queen Selina, in the throne of Persia; bid them and the court adieu, and returned to her island; promising to visit them often, where∣ever their happy destiny should station them.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="038495_0097_10122D2F2BD2A4A8"/>
The generous attention, of this royal pair, to the interest and happiness of the kingdom of Persia, was soon manifested in numberless acts of generosity and humanity, and the effects of the wisest policy were felt and enjoyed by every individual through∣out the kingdom. The poorest of their subjects were considered, and treated by them as their own children. This conduct lays the only sure founda∣tion for the happiness of kingdoms, states, or com∣monwealths; when that attention to the lowest clas∣ses in society, and to the wants and morals of the poorest, is paid, which unfeigned humanity dictates, in opposition to the covetous disposition, which false ideas and false tastes have rendered so universally prevalent. Such an attention, so becoming men of genius, wealth or power, meet with the approbation of Heaven, and ensure true glory and felicity. Such an attention is the never failing fruit of real virtue and benevolence: and without it, no nation shall long flourish. The want of it has ever been 'followed, and ever will be by the decline and ruin of the best states or kingdoms.—Such were the sen∣timents entertained by Nytan and Selina, the sove∣reigns of Persia; and to which all their actions con∣stantly agreed. To render every class, and every individual of society industrious, virtuous and hap∣py, their efforts were unremitted. And as to so benevolent and noble a purpose, they spared no pains, so likewise, they withheld no cost or expence. They journeyed through their dominions, enquired into the circumstances of every one, and supplied ev∣ery want. They appointed weekly feasts and alms for the poor and helpless; and persons, worthy of sacred trust, to look after them, and afford them ev∣ery assistance, every convenience, every instruction. Such instances of celestial humanity and love to mankind were never before exhibited with half the
<PB N="99" REF="038495_0098_10122D3148B9B038"/>
sincerity, and persevering attention. Persia scarce ever knew what felicity and prosperity were, be∣fore this happy aera! or saw, as now, crowned heads feasting with the poorest and meanest of their sub∣jects! this was a glory reserved for Nytan and Se∣lina! every heart loved them; Every tongue bles∣sed them, and cried, O celestial king and Queen! Live forever! Here all the public affairs were transacted with the most consummate skill and wis∣dom. All officers were diligent and faithful. For true and able men were appointed to every office, in every department. All instructors were as sin∣cere as learned, and as faithful as wise; selected from the most accomplished and most bevolent. But as the royal philanthropists were of too great value and too much wanted in the world, to remain always in one kingdom; and as the time drew nigh when they were to visit other regions, and instruct the citizens of other nations in true wisdom and hap∣piness, they became indefatigable in making pro∣vision for the future peace and security of Persia. Seminaries were founded; and the king had pro∣cured a number of Genies to preside over them. Nothing was omitted, by the royal pair, that could conduce to the happiness of the kingdom in their successors in the sovereignty. The finest pieces were wrote, both in prose and verse, embellished and enforced with all the beauties, elegancies, and pathos of the most persuasive eloquence, in praise and commendation of every virtue, and of the study of the works of the glorious and benifi∣cent creator, and in commendation of arts and sci∣ences, agriculture, industry, social and domestic happiness. These were published, and distributed gratis, in every family, besides thousands of copies being for sale, in every great town or city. A great many noble examples enforced every precept and
<PB N="100" REF="038495_0099_10123FB3534F5C00"/>
instruction, and with a charming authority, every argument. The adorers of fire were no where to be found, in those happy days; but the true knowl∣edge of, and respect to the Deity, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> admira∣bly influential throughout all Persia. The ladies of highest rank, and the nobility were virtuous, gen∣erous, and exemplary. See, ye great! what hap∣piness ye may diffuse! and learn what it is to be truly great and illustrious; to be worthy of life and all its rich variety of blessings! the amiable Queen had done wonders in training up her subjects to virtue and happiness, so that the work of reformation became the easier, especially when two such great minds, as her own and her royal husband's, acted in concert, seconded, too, with the cheerful and unremit∣ted co∣operation of great numbers of the highest order.</P>
<P>As for the royal prisoner, he was committed to the hands of a genie, who took pleasure in fulfilling the commands of Nytan, ever tending to accomplish both public and private good. The prisoner, then, was borne away by invisible hands to a far distant wilderness, and there left a solitary and deser∣ted heing; yet still under the eye of the invisi∣ble genie, whose name was Pharenon, and who took care, with several occasional assistants, like himself invisible and unperceived, to preserve him from the fury of the wild beasts of the desert. After he had worn out his clothes, he wondered about naked, his intellects for the most part being deranged, so that he scarce knew what he did, living upon any thing he chanced to find except that now and then, some∣thing better than the desert afforded was thrown in his way, by means of Pharenon. One day towards its close, as he was wandering, perfectly naked, a company of Banditti came upon him; who, after diverting themselves with him awhile, tied him up by his hands to the limb of a tree, beat him
<PB N="101" REF="038495_0100_101224E1E9F70EA8"/>
cruelly, and left him hanging. Night came on He was near expiring. Two hungry lions rushed from the thickets, and made the wilderness resound with their tremendous roaring. They were just upon tearing in pieces the naked and helpless prey, when the Genie Pharenon appeared in a flame of fire! The lions instantly fled. The benevolent and compassionate Genie, assuming the form of a young man, untied the naked sufferer, laid him on the ground, and forced down his throat a cordial, at which he revived from a fit of fainting. He then anointed him all over with an healing specific oint∣ment, wrapped him in sheets which he had ordered to be brought, and conveyed him, from the woods to a house, where he was put in bed, and served with things necessary and comfortable. The Genie could not refrain weeping over him, and exclaiming—'It is enough ill-fated Prince! thy sufferings and dis∣grace are at an end! thy mind hath been sufficient∣ly exercised, and will presently appear refined, like gold from the furnace. Be comforted, happy days are before thee! here you will want for nothing, and when capable of easy travelling, you will be conducted to a more agreable mansion.' The Prince expressed his gratitude to Heaven, and to Pharenon for his kindness. 'I am now instructed, said the Prince, to be humane; and I hope the instruction will not be lost upon me and that I shall live to be grateful.' Pharenon was as good as his word to the Prince. As soon as he was capable of travel∣ling, he removed him by easy stages, to a palace he owned in that country; nor failed of any kind of∣fice. In his hands he remained till he was perfect∣ly recovered.</P>
<P>When the royal and illustrious pair were acquaint∣ed, by Pharenon, of the miseries to which the un∣fortunate Prince had been subjected, (though their
<PB N="102" REF="038495_0101_10122D32D7CB4730"/>
source was his ungovernable passions) they neither could refrain from weeping, notwithstanding they were acquainted with his happier situation. Such were their sympathising feelings for the human race. All indeed were grieved for his sufferings, and re∣joiced to find they were ended; that he was in such good hands, and that there was reason to hope he would now render himself worthy, who was once so despicable, and become, in future, a blessing and ornament to his country. Their hopes were not disappointed. After continuing a year with Phare∣non, he was restored to his family and kingdom. the twenty thousand prisoners were sent home, full of the praises of Nytan and Selina, and of the un∣precedented kind and generous usage they had ex∣perienced. Their Prince now became the father and benefactor of his people, reformed, to the ut∣most, every thing amiss. In a few months after his restoration, he visited the Persian court, where he was cordially received, and entertained with that respect and magnificence which none but such as Nytan and Selina knew how to exhibit.</P>
<P>Nytan had paid several visits to the confines of Persia, where he had purchased himself an house, and some lands, with the design of settling upon the lands a greater number of poor people, that could scarcely get bread to eat. This design he accom∣plished, and left the poor people, in a fair way of improvement in virtuous industry; intending ma∣ny of them for Ravenzar. To people that island with valuable citizens, and to sow the seeds of vir∣tue in the hearts of men. He now set out for Eu∣rope, bidding adieu to his Queen, and the court. They were much affected at the thought of parting. For the king soon but an end to their grief by tel∣ling his lovely queen and all present that they had no cause for parting with him so reluctantly; that
<PB N="103" REF="038495_0102_10122D3517D17538"/>
he was going on Heaven's errands; and knew his own safety and theirs; likewise, that by means of his expeditious mode of travelling, he should be of∣tener with them than they were imagining. Thus all tears were dried up, and they parted in good spirits!</P>
<P>King Nytan had been now about 13 months al∣most wholly in the court and kingdom of Persia. By means of Pharenon, he had heard from the Em∣peror his father, and the court of Pekin. His sis∣ters were married to the worthy mandarins; who, with the Emperor and Empress, were in good health. Under the influence of a wise and good sovereign, virtue and industry generally prevailed; which was the more extraordinary considering of what an immnese body of people the Chinese empire is composed. There being no less than three hun∣dred millions under the government of one man. They allow of no embassies but from Ravenzar. As ambassador Gesseng had been there; from whom, on his return, Nytan had received letters informing him of his arrival with two thousand families, of the health of every one, and that all things were prosperous; nothing being capable of adding to their felicity, but his presence. The king having answered Gesseng, and sent away his letters, set out for Europe, where his chamber soon rested, on the borders of a vast forest; not far from which was a flourishing city. Leaving his chamber, rendered invisible and inaccessable, he travelled on foot, to the city, and entered one of the best inns, which was crowded with company. He introduced himself as a foreigner, making the tour of Europe. Ingra∣tiating himself with the company, he soon learned all he wanted to know. In the morning, hiring horses, and a servant, he rode on to the next city, and put up at the inn most frequented by the citi∣zens, and by travellers. He walked alone, and pon∣dered
<PB N="104" REF="038495_0103_10122D37BA3FAAB8"/>
on what adventures might await him in this new scene. 'Have I said he to himself, exchanged my happy situation for these cities, where par∣ties strive and rage, and every dire form of wicked∣ness stalks at noon day. Destitute of acquaintance and friend to advise and assist. But I correct my∣self. A friend I have; and one of infinitely more value than the wisest, the best, the loveliest the most powerful and most faithful of all I have left behind.—A friend, though invisible, yet ever present and ever ready to aid. O how dared I to indulge a sin∣gle desponding thought, since the bestower of friends is mine. O let me never again a moment forget my friend omnipotent and omnipresent, in whose service too, I am engaged. I will walk, and see what adventure will greet me.' He was soon in∣formed a war just commenced between that and the neighbouring kingdom. He enquired into the merits of their controversy, introduced himself to the princi∣pal men; entered a volunteer in the service; and e∣quipping himself as a soldier, was received at head quarters. The occasion of the war appeared to be just and necessary. He was soon promoted; dis∣covering such wisdom, prudence and valor, as en∣deared him to the whole army in that country. In a word, he became chiefly instrumental in gaining a speedy and decisive victory, and peace on the most just and honorable terms. While in the army, he was successful in correcting and reforming many errors in discipline, (for he had studied war as well as peace) and reforming several vicious officers. His presence every where excited, in the minds of men, the justest notions of the dignity of human nature. He commanded universal respect, esteem and love. With several he formed an agreeable friendship. In the metropolis, he was received with the honours he merited. The monarch em∣braced
<PB N="105" REF="038495_0104_10122D39D9308068"/>
him, and closeted him for several days. He found the king to be highly accomplished, and at∣tentive to the interesting subjects on which Nytan conversed: that on which he most insisted was of the necessity of a greater attention's being paid to the lowest classes in society. He reasoned with such justness and energy, that the monarch's eyes were opened to scenes of national happiness, which he had before imagined could never be realised. He resolved, therefore, upon new schemes for the pros∣perity and happiness of his kingdom.</P>
<P>Having performed these important services he re∣turned to his chamber, where he passed two days and nights in contemplation, and rest from his in∣cessant exertions for the good of his fellow creatures. Solitary as the hermit, he prepared his own meals; and walked in the day-time, with a book, under the shades of the forest. He feared no banditti, or sav∣age invaders, having it in his power, by his art, to preserve both himself and his chamber from the rav∣ages of wild beasts, or the sons of violence.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There he servently implored Heaven's guidance in his future actions.</NOTE> On the third day, he caused his chamber to ascend, and in a few minutes, was in his garden in Persia. The Queen was just risen, and opening her window, be∣held her beloved lord advancing from the grove. She quickly descended the stair case, and ran into his arms! words fall to express the joy of the loving pair!—I have but just called, said King Nytan, to see how you do, and then I must away again to Europe, where I have scarcely done half my allotted work.' 'One day, at least, my dear lord!' replied the Queen.' 'No my Selina, it cannot be, returned the king: at noon I must leave you. Let us retire
<PB N="106" REF="038495_0105_10122D3BF0E5AB70"/>
unnoticed, to your apartment, or rather to my clos∣et; where you must assist me in chusing some books I mean to carry with me. Let breakfast be order∣ed there. I shall be with you, a few hours; and I would be unnoticed by more than one or two ser∣vants, that I may not be too long hindered from my return. I shall order matters so that this will be my last journey to Europe, at least for some years. Then my lovely Selina, I hope to give myself up to you at Ravenzar, for several months.' Before noon, Pharenon brought a packet of letters from the African monarch, which gave them a vast deal of pleasure. That monarch had greatly improved his subjects, and expressed his gratitude to Nytan in the warmest terms; who had but just time enough to return his answer, by the Genie. He embraced Se∣lina, who attended him to his flying chamber. She left not the hill, till the chamber, ascending the skies, and traversing the airy regions, was out of sight. The Queen excused to her household and the court, so secret and hasty a visit from her lord, on account of the necessity he was under of dispatching his af∣fairs in Europe, that he might return to them the sooner, to lay before them matters of great moment, which concerned their future welfare. Nytan now spent near eight weeks in travelling through other parts of Europe than those he had visited.—His time was wholly employed with the poorest peasants, at the greatest distance from cities and large towns. A∣mong them he distributed the books, with which he had loaded his chamber. They were in the lan∣guage of the country in which they lived. The king was perpetually giving them good advice and instruction. He settled them on good farms, which he purchased. He selected such persons as he sound most capable of receiving good councils, and profit∣ing by them in a more comfortable situation of life.
<PB N="107" REF="038495_0106_10122D3D84A0B528"/>
Of these, he had under his tuition, about twelve thousand, in different parts of Europe. Among them were a number of instructors, to whom the royal philanthropist was very much attached, on ac∣count of their virtues and good understandings. He supplied them with books, as likewise a number of fe∣males, who merited his attention, as capable of the greatest improvements.</P>
<P>These great things being so far happily accom∣plished, the king bade his societies farewell. A thousand blessings followed him to his travelling chamber; which he now saw fit to render visible. The peasants, with wondering eyes, beheld it ascend in the air, and convey their benefactor to distant re∣gions.</P>
<P>It was night when he arrived at his palace in Per∣sia. He went directly to his apartment and solaced himself in the arms of his lovely Queen.</P>
<P>In the morning the king presented himself to his people, and appointed a number of the nobility, and plebians to attend him, and the Queen, on a tour through the kingdom. The pleasure and joy of their loving subjects, wherever they appeared, can scarely be described, on the one hand; and on the other, their grief, when they acquainted them of their proposed departure, from Persia. The lat∣ter was only mitigated by their promise of visiting them as often as possible, and providing successors in the throne who would in every thing, follow their examples. The last was fulfilled without delay, on their return from the tour. Ravesco and Fatima, were crowned and proclaimed king and queen of Persia. Their known virtues and accomplishments render∣ed them highly acceptable, and their whole conduct ever gave universal satisfation. Nytan and Selina now prepared for their departure. The Queen would carry nothing away, excepting a few things
<PB N="108" REF="038495_0107_10122D4027E1D6C0"/>
necessary and convenient: and would allow of but one maid and one man servant to attend them Re∣lations she had none, though numbers of dear friends, with whom she know not how to part. Nytan how∣ever adjusted that affecting circumstance to her sat∣isfaction, by proposing that those to whom she was most attached, should, after a while, be transported to Ravenzar.</P>
<P>On the morning of their departure, the palace, courts, and gardens were crowded with weeping spectators. Nytan and Selina, from the hill lifted up their hands and blessed them; and, entering the aerial vehicle, soon lost sight of Persia, and their disconsolate friends! such indeed were the whole kingdom! men, women, and children, every where, with sighs and tears, bewailed the loss they had sustained, in a king and queen, who loved them as they were beloved! but such alas! are the chan∣ges and vicissitudes of human life! in which we are only relieved by the lively expectation of a state of higher, of consummate perfections where no chan∣ges can effect even a momentary grief!—So rapid was their voyage to the island of Ravenzar; so sud∣den their exchange of one country of friends for an∣other; that whilst the Persians were lamenting their loss, and returning with tears and sighs to their re∣spective abodes, the citizens of Ravenzar were re∣joicing and congratulating them on their arrival there! Nytan and Selina had now disrobed and di∣vested themselves of the ensigns and honors of roy∣alty, and were become only members of the com∣munity of Ravenzar. But, their great accomplish∣ments, their shining virtues, their unparalleled mod∣esty and sweetness of behaviour, procured them a ven∣eration and love, an esteem and honor, which few crowned heads, in any age or country, were ever capable of commanding; and which daily increased
<PB N="109" REF="038495_0108_10122D4243AF92B0"/>
as they progressed in life;—like rivers, enlarging as they flow on from their source, enriching their banks on either side, till they mingle with the vast expanse of waters!</P>
<P>But, left it should be imagined, that Selina's vir∣tues possessed not that degree of refinement essential to the rendering her fame as pure and unfullied as it hath been exhibited; in that she was unjustifiable in retiring from her invaded country, to confine her∣self with a Prince with whom she had become en∣amoured merely from the description and represen∣tations given of him by the fairy Perieng; it should be related, that the queen was governed by that wise and good fairy, who knew what was to happen; and who saw no harm in transforming a fair lady for awhile, into a beautiful blue-bird.</P>
<P>Gesseng was sitting with his lovely partner, at one of the palace windows, which looked into the garden, when the chamber descended to its wonted station in the retired grove. They soon beheld its dazzling splendors; and sat not gazing till it became stationary on its flowery lawn, and visible only to the songsters of the wood. Instantly they left their seats, and Olivia her pencil and drawings. They observed two unknown persons, (as they glanced their eyes through the staircase window, in their descent) emerge from the grove. But, as they al∣ways appeared in a becoming dress for company, they had no new arrangements to make, on the score of dress. They therefore immediately ran out in quest of their friend and benefactor, whom they had no doubt of finding returned. How great was their surprise to see him leading up the alley a beautiful lady, attended by a man and maid servant; as they now discerned them to be, whom they glanced at from the stair case window! As Nytan and Selina
<PB N="110" REF="038495_0109_10122D43ED79F3D8"/>
approached, they soon perceived how matters were;—the intimate union of the happy pair was visible in their countenances!—Joy! cried Gesseng, and ran into the welcome arms of his friend.—'All hail! lovely pair,' exclaimed gayly, the e∣qually lovely partner of Gesseng, and embraced Seli∣na. Their embraces were renewed with sweetest congratulations! The domestics gathered round them, and followed them into the hall. Selina thought she was in that in Persia! The news of their arrival made a rapid progress through the city, and the palace was soon crouded. Meanwhile, Nytan led his Selina through the palace, and up to his chamber and closet. She was filled with sur∣prise, admiration and delight, in observing the per∣fect resemblance of every thing to the palace and gardens she left in Persia. 'Why, cried she, have I been travelling, in a few minutes all over the world, and now find myself on a sudden, in my own palace, when I imagined myself to be distanc∣ed from it thousands of miles? What wonders are these?'—'What wonders? replied Nytan, you are indeed in your own palace; and you be∣held from the window your own gardens. Is all this so strange?—'If I am in possession of such hap∣piness, I owe it to the kindest of men! re∣turned Selina.'—'O my incomparable Selina! ex∣claimed the enraptured husband, what infinite ob∣ligations am I under to be ever kind, tender and affectionate to the first of women! all I am all I ever shall be are thine—forever thine! May Hea∣ven daily and hourly increase the power of Nytan to render himself worthy of its inestimable gift! as the happy years roll on, the charms of Selina shall receive new lustre, and every day add to the felicities of her life! Every succeeding hour shall in∣crease the tenderness and affection of the happiest of
<PB N="111" REF="038495_0110_10122D4613344280"/>
men! may that of his Selina be ever equal to her worth! it will then be complete and permanent.' He would perhaps, have exhausted himself in the ef∣fusions of love and gratitude, had not the appear∣ance of Gesseng, and the shouts of the people arrest∣ed his attention. He went down into the hall, and mingled embraces with his congratulating friends. Joy and gladness circulated throughout the island of Ravenzar. None could be greater. None could be more sincere. Nytan proposed, to his numer∣ous friends, an entertainment, the next day at his own expence, in the city hall. Accordingly, there a grand festival was celebrated; when the wonders of Ravenzar were commemorated. The succeed∣ing week, Nytan and Gesseng, with their conjugal partners, went through a course of visits in the city. Gesseng surprised his lord with a relation of the great things Ravenzar had been doing in his absence. Through the vast ridge of mountains, he had made eight more roads, with gradual ascents, on each side the roads, to the mountains heights; on which he had built houses and furnished them with inhabi∣tants. He had likewise, built a number of towns and cities, and settled a family in every house. So that the whole number of citizens, men, women and children, that composed the community, were an hundred thousand. An amazing populating rapid∣ity! but, what cannot fairies and genies perform? and there were many of them assisting in this glo∣rious and benevolent work. 'I must soon further contribute my share towards increasing the number of our citizens, said the admiring son of Renien, I have numbers in different parts of the world pre∣pared for our island: and I intend it shall not be long before they are here. You must go my Ges∣seng, and fetch more from China.' 'Many of these last, replied Gesseng, are from thence. Besides,
<PB N="112" REF="038495_0111_10122D48B4C64100"/>
they are all instructed in the Chinese language, like those settled here before them.' 'Very well, re∣turned Nytan, you will however, I hope proceed with your fleet, once more, on this business, to Chi∣na, and when you are there, I shall soon be with you. We will take our wives with us, and may kind and indulgent Heaven prosper us, as it hath hitherto done.' Nytan was as good as his word; and Gesseng returned with his fleet, to China tak∣ing with him his wife Olivia. His friend with Selina, soon followed them, in his aerial vehicle. But before Nytan sat out he summoned two pow∣erful genies. 'Hasten said he to them, to Persia, and fetch hither the men, women and children I have appointed. They will cheerfully obey your orders. And when they are here, furnish them with houses and lands, and all things they shall want.' The genies immediately proceeded on their errand. To conclude in a few words, Nytan and Selina, Ges∣seng, and Olivia, were for several days, happy with their friends in China. After which the two for∣mer, promising another visit the next year, took leave of the Emperor and Empress, their sisters, brothers in law, and the court, and returned to Ra∣venzar; where not long after, Gesseng and Olivia safely arrived in the fleet, having three hundred fam∣ilies. The genies likewise brought from Persia, seven thousand new citizens, all of whom were set∣tled to their satisfaction, and far beyond their ex∣pectations.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AMONG those who were last introduced into the island, by Ravenzar, was a beautiful and highly accomplished lady Amelia. She was of high descent in a foreign country; but persecuted and driven thence, on account of her inflexible attach∣ment to liberty, and to a few friends, of both sexes, who nobly dared to oppose the oppressive measures of an arbitrary an tyrannical government. Through their influence and exertions, great numbers became resolutely engaged in freedom's cause. War was its inevitable consequence. The zealous friends of the best of causes were indefatigable and persevering till they had formed, and brought into the field, an army of twenty thousand men, which unhappily was far exceeded by the opposing tyrants; whose innumerable cohorts poured in upon them, from all quarters, like a resistless torrent. Victory was then permitted to decide in favour of the scourgers of mankind. Amelia and her friends being defeated, she found means with a few adherents, to escape to a forest, under whose gloomy shades, they imagin∣ed they might rest awhile secure from pursuers. But there they found but a temporary retreat. A party of the enemy, which had been searching the
<PB N="114" REF="038495_0113_101224D69DA4E1E8"/>
forest, came upon them. They bravely opposed force to force. But valorous and desperate as they were, they were incapable of long resisting ten times their number; and, had not unexpected aid appear∣ed, they must at least, have yielded to death, or the chains of tyrants.—A man in flaming armour, dart∣ed like lightning upon their conquering foes; and instantly they were scattered, like pillars of smoke before the tempestuous wind! the terrific warrior no sooner assaulted than he defeated and dis∣persed, and, not a single opposer, was from that moment either to be seen or heard. Whilst Ame∣lia and her little company were wondering at this sudden deliverance, the Victor approached, and ad∣dressed them in the following terms—'Valiant and worthy friends! Heaven be praised, that sent me to rescue you from the power of a detestable herd of tyrants and debauchees, who are the disgrace of hu∣manity. Your brave resistance of those murderers of the human species, does you the greatest honor. Forsake then, this land of slavery and oppression, and follow me to a country of freedom and bliss. Thither will I conduct you in safety; even where you will find that virtue, glory and felicity, which you have in vain though nobly exerted yourselves to promote and establish here.' It was the great, the mighty genie Ravenzar who addressed them; who was answered with the most grateful acknowl∣edgments, and ready acceptance of his proffered friendship and protection. He led them out of the forest, taking Amelia's hand, and committing two little girls she had with her, to the care of his ser∣vants, who were then just come up to the com∣pany. He conversed with them, as they walk∣ed towards the road, on such subjects as tended to inspire them with just sentiments of his character and disinterested views, informing them who he
<PB N="115" REF="038495_0114_10122D4C66B57838"/>
was, and giving them a concise history of the place whither he intended to conduct them. 'How fatally said he, do those tyrants, under the specious pretexts of liberty, and virtue, amuse millions of people! You have seen, how little they could relish your just remonstrances against their covetous dispositions, their vanity, intemperance, and hypocrisy. I will convey you my worthy friends, to a country, where truth and virtue are understood, and where liberty is more than an empty sound to impose upon those who are willing to be deceived.'</P>
<P>Amelia and her adherents readily followed the genie Ravenzar on board his fleet, and arrived in safety to the happy island; where they soon expe∣rienced the unbounded generosity of their new friends; who placed them in situations of life most agreeable to their inclinations, and the wise poli∣cies and arrangements of the country, enriching them at the same time, far beyond their expectations, or even their desires. Amelia, with her two beauti∣ful girls, chose a retired situation. Those girls, the one eight, the other nine years of age, were the orphan daughters of her deceased brother, and had lived with her ever since the loss of her parents. As she was exceeding fond of them, she had spared no pains in their education. She was therefore, furnished, agreeably to her wish as, with a large and well built house delightfully situated about twenty miles from Xuntien, at some distance from the pub∣lic road, and surrounded by the noblest growth of trees; having a fine large garden, in which it stands upon an eminence that affords a fine prospect of the country, a branch of the river, hills, lawns, fields and groves, and the dwellings of the farmers on each side the water. In this romantic villa, Amelia settled, with her lovely nieces, and a few attendants, of both sexes. After a while, she kept
<PB N="116" REF="038495_0115_10122D4F0C6C9290"/>
open doors, entertaining all sorts of company. For, in Ravenzar, there were none unworthy of her hos∣pitality, friendship, or esteem. A large number, of both sexes, of learning and fine accomplishments, constantly resorted to her villa, often continuing there for several weeks. With these she enjoyed all the superior pleasures of a country life. Though the situation, was retired, it was by no means a sol∣itary one to her, who loved society. Some times they walked in the extensive garden and groves; at others they visited the industrious farmers, who were far from being ignorant, or unconversible, as is the case in some countries. Amelia likewise, had her hour of profitable employment, study, embroidering and drawing. From her company and associates, great mutual advantages were derived, and which extended to the community; which is every greatly served by the rich, who are virtuous, in whatever sphere of life they move. Amelia not only read, and studied, but she wrote elegantly and sublimely, in prose and verse: and her conversation was always highly entertaining, as well as beneficial and instruct∣ing. If her person was beautiful, her mind was still more so: and though not exceeding twenty∣three years of age, there were not many in the world, much older, that, possessed a greater share of knowledge, wisdom and discretion. Among the gay young noblemen of her native country, she had many admirers, who sought her hand. But their manners and principles she abhorred; and the pros∣pects of accumulated splendor and magnificence, which they set before her, she deemed not worth a single thought. But a few weeks before she was driven from her native home, she was addressed by a merchant of fine accomplishments, and gentle manners. His name was Philenor. For him she entertained the tenderest sentiments, and they had
<PB N="117" REF="038495_0116_10122D516E617578"/>
exchanged mutual vows of love and constancy. But he was now lost to Amelia! Philenor had sailed to a far distant country; where he was supposed to have bid adieu to this life. To indulge in si∣lent, unnoticed grief for one, to whom she once fondly hoped to be united, was that which gave the first rise to her inclination for retirement. But, reason and virtue came to her aid; and, at length, convinced of the criminality of yielding to secret unavailing sorrow; with her former views, she therefore, changed her plan; and courted society.</P>
<P>Amelia however, frequently indulged herself in solitary walks; enjoying the most delicious pleasure in the contemplation of the beauties of nature; ex∣alting her thoughts from the wonders of creation, to the consideration of the power, glory and majes∣ty of the Creator. As she rambled through, the fragrant groves; as she walked over the carpets of living green, and amidst the flowers and deli∣cious sweets which exuberant nature had spread around her;—she seemed to tread on enchanted ground, or as roving amid the luxuries of a second paradise!—In some chosen spot secure from obser∣vation, she would often take from her pocket, a lit∣tle writing desk; and reclining on the mossy bank, pour out, on paper, the effusions of a heart ever grateful to its divine former. The following peice may serve as a specimen of her talent in poetry. It was undesignedly dropped, in one of her morning walks: and to that accident we owe the pleasure of transcribing it for the perusal of those who have a taste for poetical composition. It is addressed to the Creator, on the display of his glory and good∣ness in the Creation and perfection of man.</P>

<P>Sublime thoughts like these, discovered an eleva∣tion of mind but seldom equalled by the contem∣poraries of Amelia, or in any age of the world. The works of creation, with which we are surround∣ed and in which we are involved, do <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> afford a most satisfactory evidence of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in∣tentions of the divine architect, with <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to the present and future happiness of man. A greater degree of felicity, in his present state of existence, is only prevented by his weakness: and yet, out of this weakness arises his future immeasurable height of bliss!</P>
<P>Not long after the return of Nytan, and his friends, from China, Selina proposed an excursion into the country, of which she had heard such un∣common panegyric's. Nothing could have been proposed more agreeable to him, as he was sen∣sible it would greatly conduce to the health as well as pleasure of his fair spouse. Gesseng and Olivia were equally pleased with it, for the like reasons. They sat out on a fine morning, on horseback. As they rode through the city, they made an addition of two couple to the company; two servants only attending them. They rode several miles on the verdant flowery banks of the river. The tall and majestic oaks afforded them an agreeable shade and defence from the scorching beams of the sun. Turning into one of the great roads that were cut out through the mountains, the prospects before them, and on each side, were luxuriantly magnifi∣cent; which were succeeded by those of alternate groves, fields and vales, buildings and planta∣tions. After travelling near two hours, through those dellghtful scenes, they entered a gloomy wood.
<PB N="125" REF="038495_0124_10122D633B088C80"/>
Though the road was excellent: yet the dark shade of the lofty trees, excluding the rays of the sun, gave the appearance of night; exciting a pleasing horror and agreeable solemnity for the succeeding hour; and they conversed but little. Having rode through the wood, they saw before them a large well built house, with an high wall of black marble, which they observed to extend through groves of trees, and over hills, to a great distance. This was Amelia's Villa. On one side appeared to them part of a branch of the river, which in various windings, ran through the island; and a number of well con∣structed houses on its banks. The scenes, here, were delightfully romantic! 'Every thing invites us, said Olivia, to rest here; and see who inhabits this retired mansion.' 'You are very right lady re∣plied Nytan. My curiosity is excited, and, I doubt not, that of every one. Besides it is high time for us to rest, and procure some refreshment, where there is no doubt of our being welcome. The inhabi∣tants of Ravenzar are the most hospitable people in the world. I will ride on, if you please, and make the first appearance. He then quickened his horse's pace. But Selina's did not choose to be left behind, so they both advanced together to the gate, which they found open. Alighting, and leaving their horses, they crossed the court to a large hall, in which Amelia was reclining on a soffa; who seeing two strangers advancing, arose to meet them with an air of gaity and engaging familiarity.—'Sweet lady, said Nytan, give me leave to present you with a sister, who must certainly look upon you as her second self, you so greatly resemble her.' He was indeed struck with the fine appearance of Amelia, and her likeness to his Selina. They saluted and embraced her, as was customary in this island of pure undissembled love. The Prince said a thou∣sand
<PB N="126" REF="038495_0125_10122D64CE48D858"/>
pleasant things. None could be a more gal∣lant and compassionate admirer of the fair sex. Struck, and enraptured, as he was, with the loveli∣ness, and likeliness of the two ladies, Which cried he, is Selina, and which is Amelia? Sure you are twin-sisters—what a surprising resemblance of two of the most perfect beauties nature ever formed!' The ladies were quite merry with his gallantry. 'I think however, added he, Silena may be distin∣guished by a little paleness. Then, conscious of the occasion of this distinction, which could not but excite some anxious sensations, at the same time that it flattered his most pleasing hopes; he tenderly seated them both on a soffa, calling upon his fellow travellers, who were entering the hall, to participate with him in the joy and pleasure of so unexpected and invaluable an acquisition to their society. Amelia rose to receive them but instantly sunk lifeless on the soffa! Every one was frightened, and ran to her assistance. Two lovely girls who were at work in a contiguous apartment, the door of which opened into the hall, flew to her with a smelling bottle. It soon produced signs of return∣ing life! when Amelia opening her eyes, fixed them on the astonished and enraptured Philenor! it was indeed Philenor himself whose sudden un∣looked-for appearance had overcome the tender A∣melia. 'O! exclaimed she, Philenor, I had re∣signed you to Heaven; as lost to me for the pres∣ent life!'—'Heaven, replied he has rewarded your resignation by restoring to you, your faithful lover, who will never more leave you! little indeed, did I ever expect this felicity! But my misfortunes are now amply recompensed. Yes. It was for this joyful event, that I was invited to the happy island of Ravenzar, and introduced to the illustrious
<PB N="127" REF="038495_0126_10122D66749C27A8"/>
friends who have conducted me to the treasure of my heart!</P>
<P>Great was the joy of the company on so fortunate an occurrence, which was brought forward in the manner following. Philenor was taken off a wreck by Gesseng, just before his last arrival. The men would most probably all have perished, had not de∣liverance been so seasonably sent them. A friend∣ship soon commenced between two young men so nearly resembling each other, as did Gesseng and Philenor, both in age and sentiment. The latter had been in the country with the seamen, saved with him from the wreck, to view a spot of land which has been recommended to them for their present residence, or future settlement, if they chose to con∣tinue on the island; with regard to which they were to be wholly at their own aption. Gesseng had mentioned them, to Nytan with good commen∣dations; highly praising Philenor, as one who would do great honor to their society. Adding, that he intended to introduce him, on his return from the country. It had been the intention of Philenor to return to his native home, as soon as possible by such means as should be concerted between himself Gesseng and Nytan. To return thither he pleaded indispensable obligations. He, therefore, purpos∣ed to be at court, as soon as he had determined mat∣ters with his seamen. Nytan, with his party of pleasure had been gone from the palace, but an hour, when Philenor arrived there: and receiving directions had immediately followed them: over∣taking them just as Nytan had preceded his com∣pany, and entered Amelia's gate. Thus it happen∣ed that he so unexpectedly appeared before her; who, having now recovered her presence of mind, or∣dered refreshments to be brought into the hall. In the mean time, her new friends were congratulating
<PB N="128" REF="038495_0127_10122D689EA882C0"/>
her and her lover on so happy a meeting, and saving a thousand pleasant things. 'But I hope, said Ny∣tan, we are not soon to lose you. Philenor, I have learned, intended to return in a few days, to his country, doubtless, in quest of his Amelia. But, now he has found her, I hope that intention will be laid aside; especially when he is informed what has happened. He cannot, scarcely, imagine it can be for his Amelia's safety, (if for his own) to return, at present, whatever he may do hereafter.' 'I think with you, my lord, replied Philenor on this subject. But I leave all to Amelia.' 'Then, said Selina, we may all keep up our spirits! mine I confess were a little deranged, at the very idea of loosing Amelia. But, I dare to say, she will not he in a hurry to visit a country so abandoned as to persecute such excellence, and force her to flee from her native home. What say you, my charming friend!' O! dear lady, replied Amelia, I can add nothing to your arguments for my re∣maining here, as in a happy asylum; after I have related to Philenor my misfortunes;—only that if I may take his word, we are never more to be sepa∣rated.' 'No answered Philenor, most certainly never. The idea of being separated, is intelerable for a moment! besides, if you, Amelia, chuse to continue here for life, I must of necessity make the same choice. Here, money, or estate, I have none. But I cannot fail of seeing you happy in the friend∣ship of those who will never suffer us to want any thing in their power to grant. At home, indeed, I have large interest, which, I doubt not, may be transferred here.' 'You will make yourself easy, replied Gesseng, on all accounts. Our friend Nytan, can inform you, there are the best of lands at your service.' 'And the sincerest friends, said Nytan. Whatever assistance you may require, in respect of
<PB N="129" REF="038495_0128_10122D6B51C39F68"/>
your estate, or friends, we shall cheerfully afford you. Amelia hath here a valuable estate, and the same hour that unites you in one, you will be∣come lawful possessor of a thousand acres of land adjoining to hers. Besides you will have apart∣ments in my palace, and a spacious elegant building of your own, nearly opposite to it, in the city. We have, likewise treasures of money and jewels, which you are to command as your own. Let us then, my friends hasten to Xuntien, and see these amiable lovers united. Afterwards, we shall find means to procure them intelligence from their na∣tive country.' Philenor and Amelia, with the most grateful acknowledgments, yielded themselves to the advice and conduct of their generous friends; who proposed to conduct them immediately to Xun∣tien.</P>
<P>Refreshments were now brought in, and set be∣fore the company. Nytan and Selina, after they had all dined, proposed a walk in the garden, which being agreed to, they went thither. They found it to be laid out in taste. The two little girls were likewise with them, and admired for their beauty and behaviour. Olivia proposed to take them to Xuntien, declaring they should not be buried in the country. It is time for them, added she, to see company. 'Have they been always, Amelia, con∣tinued she, thus secluded from the world?' 'Far from so, replied Amelia: my house is frequented by all sorts of people. We have seldom two days without company, and the girls have always their share of it.' 'Well returned Olivia, we must have them up to town, however.' 'By all means, ad∣ded Nytan, we shall on no account, consent to their being left; and I believe, Amelia, must shut up her house, for two or three months at least. We
<PB N="130" REF="038495_0129_10122D6D6EDE1BA0"/>
shall be very loth to part with her, and her beauti∣ful neices, in less time.' Amelia expressed the warmest acknowledgments to her friends; adding that all should be as they thought proper. 'Well, then, replied Nytan, let us prepare to set out, or it will be night before we reach Xuntien.' When they were returned to the house, Amelia was not long in arranging her affairs. She com∣mitted the care of her villa to her faithful servants, and her carriage was brought to the door; in which she, with Philenor, and her two neices, entered, and all set forward for Xuntien. The weather was fine, the company gay and cheerful. They made but one short stage, about half way; and be∣fore sun-set, reached Nytan's palace; who led his company into a spacious and magnificent apartment, the windows of which where open to the garden. Nothing could ever exceed the gaiety and splendor of this apartment! It seemed to be all alive with portraits large as were once the living originals; and paintings of romantic rural scenes, all done in the utmost perfection of art. These were the ta∣pestry work of the orphan ladies. Neither would it be easy to find any fine prospects superior, if e∣qual, to those which the windows of this apartment afforded. Here tea was brought, and other refresh∣ments suitable to the time and and occasion. Eve∣ry one took what they pleased from a large marble table, which stood under the window, loaded with every delicacy which nature provides to recruit <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> travellers. After sitting an hour as the e∣vening was delightful, and the moon shone out with unusual lustre, they walked out into the garden. The air was perfumed with nature's sweets, and the brightness of the evening invited them to con∣tinue walking till the hour of supper. This was served up in the pavilion; the most pleasant situa∣tion
<PB N="131" REF="038495_0130_10122D6F06D70D88"/>
the garden afforded; commanding several grand views of the country. It can scarcely be imagined—magnificent, delicious and inchanting as was every thing around them, that so respectable and accom∣plished a company of friends could be wanting in con∣versation on such delightful and interesting subjects as the wonders of creation, the events of life, and their own knowledge and experience must inspire and dic∣tate. When they met from the alleys and winding paths, in which each party had been strolling, Philenor introduced some observations on the various man∣ners of nations, and the heights of luxury and false magnificence to which some had arrived; and on the fatal consequences of vice and dissipation. He instanced several flourishing kingdoms, whose de∣struction he ventured to prophecy, would ere long be the necessary result of their extravagancies and vices. These subjects were renewned in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and led to others equally interesting. 'One great cause said Nytan, of the misery and ruin of nations, (little attended to) is intemperance in eat∣ing and drinking. Men drown their rational facul∣ties, by indulging their appetites. They load their bodies with bad humours, and strengthen the false appetites which they have acquired, weakening and destroying their constitutions. When the body is disordered by intemperance, the powers of the mind are, likewise weakened and depraved. False ideas of the enjoyment of life, are entertained, and produce innumerable expensive luxuries which render the rich bankrupt and oppressive. Their tables of luxury must be supplied, at all adven∣tures. The universe must be ransacked for deli∣cacies; and mankind plundered, oppressed, enslav∣ed to fill the purses of extravagant luxurious ava∣rice. Religion, too, must be prostituted to the same infamous and detestable purposes.'</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="038495_0131_10122D71207524A0"/>
'All this have I seen realized, added Eudemon, [he being one of the company who joined the par∣ty at Xuntien,] in the country from which I origin∣ated. In former times, continued he, when the leading men of society were virtuous and wife, so∣ber and temperate, my countrymen were influenced by their example; and enjoyed in a very remarka∣ble degree the happiness of civil and domestic life. But an unhappy negligence and oversight in the all-important care and education of children, caused intemperance gradually to take root, till it spread, like an infectious disease, in every family; till, at length, temperance and sobriety, were words which had wholly lost their original signification, and must now be considered as importing a decent kind of viciousness, very well comporting with virtue or re∣ligion. In fine, every amiable grace and virtue be∣came quite different things from what they formerly were; and men of interest and influence, who val∣ued themselves upon the excellency of their moral characters, were, accordingly, esteemed as good men—the best of men; whilst fashionable temper∣ance was undermining their constitutions, and load∣ing them with diseases; having already polluted their minds.—O unhappy country! how art thou estranged from thy ancient simplicity of manners, which arrayed thee with glory; from those illus∣trious virtues, with which thou wast anciently a∣dorned! how disgraceful is the distinction of men of character, wealth and influence now become, in discerning eyes, if there is any reality in virtue, if there be, in nature, any such things as true glory and real felicity!—disgraceful—because such pass for great and good, benevolent and useful, generous and brave, whose only real solicitude is to gratify their avarice and ambition, their passion for luxuri∣ous extravagant pleasures, and foolish magnificence;
<PB N="133" REF="038495_0132_10122D73CE02F5B8"/>
—who prostitute religion to their detestable pur∣poses, and fail not to call in fanaticism to their assistance, in establishing slavery and oppression! So long as they can gratify their ruling passions, their hearts are steeled against humanity, yet with a great parade of patriotism, philanthropy, and civilized manners; and they can have no attention to Heav∣en's justice, and that shame and ruin which must one day overtake them!'</P>
<P>'You indeed speak melancholy truths, rejoined Ny∣tan. What scenes of misery and distress have such men brought upon mankind in every age, as well as in the present; some of which I have myself been witness to, not long ago: and where the lower classes of society, who ought to be cherished and cultivated to the utmost, are used as beings crea∣ted only for slavery and imposition. They have religion: and what is it? The engine of cruelty and oppression: the religious leaders op∣pressing the people, at the same time that they grossly deceive them: in this they are leagued with those who are called the great ones; but who may more justly be denominated beasts of prey, devour∣ing monsters, or, the plagues and tormentors of mankind. Such are the effects of unrestrained ap∣petites and passions; rendering them never-ceasing plagues to each other, destroying virtue and sinceri∣ty, truth and humanity from the world. Custom has long rendered their vices and hypocrisy consis∣tent with virtue, piety, sincerity and uprightness. And many, imposing upon themselves, imagine that for their virtue and good deeds (respected as such) their names will be immortalised. But the immortality of their fame, will prove the immor∣tality of their disgrace! The luxury, the profuse magnificence of the rich and powerful are totally
<PB N="134" REF="038495_0133_10122D75EA53C120"/>
repugnant to the principles and sentiments of a tru∣ly virtuous mind. Though in a situation like ours, magnificence and splendor are unavoidable. Since gold, diamonds, and pearls are our readiest and cheapest materials for building and ornament; and the treasures we possess, can scarcely ever be ex∣hausted; by means of which likewise, we are ren∣dered more capable of extensive usefulness. But perfect temperance presides at our tables, and real virtue regulates our actions. These are all the gifts of our heavenly benefactor. It is through his sovereign will and pleasure that we are temperate and virtuous, and gratitude inspires and animates our exertions to render others as happy as ourselves.—But alas! What multitudes are there who most miserably suffer through the mistaken ideas of liv∣ing which they have imbibed and cherished! and how many are there, who endure every hardship for a name or to accomplish some imaginary valuable purpose; and that with a surprising fortitude and perseverance; who yet have not the courage to practice a just temperance, and thereby procure to themselves health, true pleasure and tranquility, for a long series of years!—What absurdity and incon∣sistency is here!—and which, those who could sub∣due armies, and establish empires, have not been a∣ble, as to themselves to obviate! To what purpose do they glory in their courage and fortitude, who have not, after all, the courage, the fortitude to re∣strain their appetites within the limits of that just temperance, which would insure to them true hap∣piness, true glory, permanent felicity and honor, and make them illustrious by real usefulness to mankind. Those who practice a just temperance, enjoy a thousand pleasures unknown to others: In them we may see its happy effects in every situa∣tion and circumstance. They only can be proper∣ly
<PB N="135" REF="038495_0134_10122D7779131580"/>
said to enjoy life. Our happiness greatly de∣pends upon the proper government and arrange∣ment of our thoughts; which can never be so a∣ranged and governed without the strictest temper∣ance both in eating and drinking, and bodily exer∣cise. For by the prevalency of bad humors, aris∣ing from intemperance, the mind becomes clouded and enervated; the reasoning powers are deprived of their natural freedom and influence. Some in∣dulge and pamper themselves to that degree, that they can hardly think or crawl: others stupify their senses, and drown their rational faculties with strong drink. No man can enjoy the free exercise of the powers of his body or mind, who lives intem∣perately. What a wide difference subsists between such an one, and the man who is governed by the strictest temperance! The former is erroneous in his judgement, wild in his projects, disordered in imagination, unhappy in his memory, depraved in his principles, a slave to his passions, restless, sick, diseased and hastening to a premature and miser∣able death. The latter is wholly from those evils; suffers no inconveniences from his own conduct; his passions and appetites being subservient to his reason and his felicity. He enjoys a sound mind in a healthy and vigorous body increases in wisdom and experience; and armed with virtue and manly reflection, is always prepared for every event of life. He lives quietly through a long series of happy years, and grows ripe for a glorious immortality. Temperance and sobriety are indeed of the highest consequence, both to the happiness and the usefulness of life. Experience evinces to every one who has made a fair trial of the salutary effects of temper∣ance, that, as is a man's temperance in his diet, so is the serenity, freedom and equality of his mind: and if there is a perpetual sameness in
<PB N="136" REF="038495_0135_10122D7999259B58"/>
the one, so, likewise, will there be in the oth∣er. To a just temperance is to be attributed that constant serenity and rationality in the sages of an∣tiquity, and which prevailed in them <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> proportion to their proficiency in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> practice of temperance. Hence the great and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ac∣quisitions of useful knowledge in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ages, for∣tunately transmitted to posterity. Hence the state∣ly progress of glorious liberty, with all her train of blessings, from one region to another, at different periods of time, till at length, fixing her residence in the temperate and peaceful, climate of Ravenzar, she diffuses her salutary influence, far and wide, through the habitable world! O sacred and power∣ful temperance! what mighty exploits hast thou atchieved! what great and excellent things hast thou accomplished! repairing the ravages and devasta∣tion which thy opposite had perpetrated! it is un∣der thy enlivening auspices only, that states or em∣pires can flourish in the changeless bloom and vigor of youth, or useful science diffuse its illustrious beams, and add a still new lustre and brilliancy to those splendors she has already so extensively dis∣played; whose reviving rays have penetrated the dark corners of the earth which savage barbarism and ignorance had so long involved in horrendous gloom. But I must not expatiate so largely, even on so important a subject.'</P>
<P>'I have frequently, said Laertes, [the other citi∣zen from Xuntien,] observed of persons, who were perpetually complaining of their ill health, that they were very unwilling to believe what sound reason teaches; namely, that whatever is received into the stomach more than it can readily digest, or that agrees not with it; excites those humors which occasion a variety of disorders. That those humors fill the brain with noxious fumes, and prevent the
<PB N="137" REF="038495_0136_10122D7C40B47F08"/>
proper exercise of the mental powers; render the persons restless and uneasy with every thing about them, which they impute to wrong causes. At length fevers were brought upon them, and a varie∣ty of symptoms and forerunners of incurable diseas∣es, in the end seized them. Whereas, those who were guided by their reason (few as they were) were free from those complaints, and enjoyed a great de∣gree of health to old age. Their health would have been more perfect, and they would have lived ma∣ny years longer had they been more perfect in the art of temperance. But most of the people a∣mong us, (for I am speaking of my former coun∣trymen) seemed to act more like children, who hankèr and fret after every thing that is to be eat or drank: and with regard to children, the indul∣gent parents very readily gratify them in their de∣sires, too often to their ruin. Ah! Cruelly indul∣gent parents! happy were it for you, and your off∣spring, did you refrain from such pernicious kind∣ness! Yet you still follow the beaten path of cus∣tomary folly in which, yourselves being induced, you have dragged heavily on, a burthensome life; this was owing to the abuse of your stomachs; and for which you are denied the exhilirating prospects of a long life of health and happiness!'</P>
<P>'Your observations, resumed Nytan, are such as may very justly be made on many other countries besides your own; though not I believe in this. We are sensible, the stomach is a most curious and delicate workmanship of nature, soon feeling injurious treatment, and terrible, are its re∣sentments. There are too many, who, owing to the fatigue of labour and business, have been induc∣ed to give way to their appetites to the great preju∣dice, and often, ruin of their constitution. But, it ought to be considered, that temperance is requisite
<PB N="138" REF="038495_0137_10122D7E58593B08"/>
in business and labour, as well as in the use of food and drink. The steady practice of using the same quantity of meat and drink every day, or at every meal, regarding, at the same time, its quality, as well as the measure of their stomachs, is what in∣sures long life, and a perfect state of health; even as the great system of the creation is constantly maintained in the same condition, by an exact sup∣ply from the divine source of its existence and fe∣cundity. Order and regularity were observed in the composition of our bodies; and how can we ex∣pect they can be maintained in their proper state of health and vigor, without temperance? Pherneone of Greece, thus uttered to me, lately, his melan∣choly complaint. 'My former tranquility is no more. I relish not my usual pleasures. I walk through the same delightful scenes of nature; but they yield not the wonted sublime enjoyment to me. The delights of the preceding years—alas! they are vanished!' 'To what, my friend, said I, is this unhappy change to be attributed? Is not your temperance the same? (for I more than suspected the real cause.) 'No replied Pherneone, it is not, I must freely own. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have not been able to afford myself my usual diet; and have made too much use of what agrees not with my constitution.'</P>
<P>I amply furnished him with the means of resum∣ing his temperance. His tranquility returned, and he enjoyed his delicious walks, his studies and a∣musements as before. But if men will eat and drink, or labour and toil beyond what their natures can endure, they must suffer the terrible consequen∣ces. Ardenly is it to be wished, their eyes were effectually opened to such inexcusable folly, and that they might be induced to renounce intemper∣ance, that baneful source of both public and private calamities; the plague and ruin not only of indi∣viduals,
<PB N="139" REF="038495_0138_10122D80413E5FE8"/>
but families, societies, states and empires!—But, look into the families-attentively consider the country, where temperance and freedom, those constant companions, are united;—who can de∣scribe the felicity and glory there enjoyed! To pro∣mote such a glory and felicity, amongst mankind, let every exertion be made, and every power of el∣oquence be used, deeply to impress upon the minds of men men who desire to be free; that the rich invaluable blessings of liberty, can never be effectu∣ally obtained, secured or enjoyed, if temperance is neglected. The men of temperance and sobriety are the wisest patriots and legislators, the best cit∣izens, the most benevolent, faithful and successful instructors. It is with such only, wisdom dwells, and with whom are found prudent counsels. It is such only who can possess undissembled benevolence. I have observed a custom in Europe, which hath doubtless, given rise to the greatest evils. It is that of urging, and even compelling guests to drink be∣yond the bounds of sobriety, which may very justly be called a barbarous custom; it having often oc∣casioned the ruin of many a promising young crea∣ture. I am confident the number is far from be∣ing inconsiderable, of those who can derive, from this inglorious practice, the fatal debauchery of their minds, and all the melancholy and distressing conse∣quences which have imbittered their lives, and that there are thousands now living (if living it may be called) the miserable victims of intemperance; who could attest to the truth of what I have advanced, as awfully verified in themselves.</P>
<P>But, how shall we address our misguided fellow∣creatures, so as to gain their attention on so inter∣esting a subject.'</P>
<P>'Powerful and persuasive arguments, answered Philenor, should be urged upon them, and enchant∣ing
<PB N="140" REF="038495_0139_10122D825D9F6F60"/>
scenes of virtuous happiness presented to their view. I would urge them frequently to contem∣plate the glorious advantages, the inexpressible hap∣piness to which, by a just temperance, they would attain. I would likewise press home to them the fatal consequence that inevitably follow intemper∣ate indulgencies. I would endeavour sedulously to induce them to reason each one with himself after the following manner. 'Shall I then risk en∣countering with the great, the accumulating evils which intemperance produce; especially when I see them making such terrible havoc with those a∣round me? Is there not horror in the thought suf∣ficient to deter me? Besides what can be more shameful than to refuse to be wise! On the other hand, how inviting are the benefits the rich varie∣ty of permanent blessings to which a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> temperance calls me! To be free from disquietude and pain, from distressing anxieties, diseases and agonies; to enjoy the free exercise of my rational powers, per∣petual health and serenity, to live long in felicity and honor; and when the period of this state of ex∣istence arrives, that period which nature hath pre∣scribed, to exchange it for immortality,—Surely these are glorious advantages worthy the contention against lawless indulgences though they were even more alluring than a false taste hath rendered them.' 'Men think, added Laertes, that to restrain their ap∣petites is to render themselves miserable; till you can persuade them, that though the restraining them is somewhat irksome at first, yet it afterwards be∣comes to them a second nature to live in the strictest temperance. When you have induced them to dwell in the subject, and to hear your arguments with pleasure; they may presently be animated to every necessary exertion; till at length they attain to an experimental knowledge of those felicities
<PB N="141" REF="038495_0140_10122D858A5946D8"/>
with which temperance crowns her faithful vota∣trires. I would address them, continued Laertes, in such moving language as the following:—If tem∣perance be the best preservative of health, the friend of nature, and the offspring of virtue, the source of industry, and of every great and good action; if she leads to true glory and renown, as she fits the mind and body for every valuable purpose and em∣ployment; if she gives length of days, and perma∣nent enjoyment; and if, on the other hand an in∣temperate course inevitably leads to irreparable mis∣ery; then let these weighty considerations rouze you from your unmanly indulgencies! break loose from the shameful the disgraceful fetters with which vice would forever enslave you, before they become too firmly rivited to be rent asunder.—Before it be too late, be intreated to spare yourselves, ere the wanton waste of your natural strength can never be repaired; before unavailing regret and anguish be forced upon you, and cruel reflection awakes, like a giant refreshed with wine; at once dashing in pieces, every delusive hope, and inflicting tortures that can never be fully expressed! For what can be conceived more dreadful than the condition of a person, who by his intemperance, has filled his bo∣dy with loathsome, incurable, tormenting diseases! add to this the agonizing reflection, that by his own folly he hath rendered, the pleasant and delightsome summer of life, a dreary winter of premature old age, loaded with infirmities, disorders, and racking pains! Thus would I endeavor to awaken my fel∣low creatures to a just sense of their folly and mad∣ness in destroying themselves by their intemperance, and may ten thousand tongues and pens be employ∣ed, in so laudable an attempt, with all the most per∣suasive and alluring charms and paraprase of unrival∣led
<PB N="142" REF="038495_0141_10122D871750DB58"/>
eloquence, exhibiting the unspeakable happiness of a life of sobriety.—For is there a subject more worthy of the strongest genius, or that more importu∣nately calls for the display of the most shining talents, when viewed in all its high relations!'</P>
<P>It was thus this worthy company past the even∣ing, in conversing on subjects the most interesting to mankind; whose perfect felicity was among their fondest wishes, and to promote which they were never wanting in the most vigorous exertions. The ladies had their share in the conversation, and every sentence they uttered did honor to their good sense, their education, and their philanthropy. The time of repose being arrived, they retired, to their several apartments. In the morning after break∣fasting, they resumed their garden walks. Not that business was neglected. Philenor was not wanting in his address to hasten his marriage. Nytan exerted himself to the same purpose—and Amelia, though em∣ployed in contemplation, study and writing, on the retired side of a hill shaded with groves, found some intervals of time to think on the same subject. She arose very early in the morning, and, entering the garden alone, ranged from grove to grove, and from hill to hill; till, at length, she seated herself on the side of one that commanded a grand and engaging view of nature's variegated works. Here she con∣tinued till the hour of breakfast; and indulging her poetic and prosaic genius, composed the following little pieces on temperance and the glories of crea∣tion.</P>
<P>'Sacred temperance! with thee are d allied all the graces and virtues that adorn human nature, which render us worthy <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that existence which Heaven hath bestowed, and which its goodness con∣tinues.

and every tongue should speak with rapture, of the invaluable blessings which thou dost procure! yet, worthy as thou art of universal regard, and, inesti∣mable as are thy labours, too few are there to be found, of mankind, and even among those called civilized nations, who pay a just attention to thy salutary laws! such is the deplorable depravity of human nature! what a continued series of calami∣ties, hath thy opposite—intemperance, brought up∣on the human race! Nor are either sex to be ex∣cepted.—With what wretched kings and rulers hast thou peopled the world! what miserable heads of families, parents, teachers and children! To rem∣edy thy growing evils, instructions and warnings have been but to little purpose inculcated.—Cold and lifeless treatises on the virtues of temperance and sobriety, however frequent, could accomplish, upon the voluptuaries, no salutary effect. When distempers assail them, when sickness and diseases make depredations on their frames, they reluctant∣ly submit to the necessary restraints from luxurious indulgencies, and to an abstemious diet; which is afterwards despised and misimproved, when a mea∣sure of health returns. A prudent and regular diet, so essential to health, is then no longer regarded, and they return to their former phrenzy.—If ma∣ny, who are instructors, understood and practised a just temperance, what happy consequences might be expected to follow this example and instruction! if possessed of superior abilities, they could not fail to recommend to every one, within the sphere of their influence, the virtue they exemplified in their lives and manners, with the most alluring charms of eloquence; which doubtless must produce a sal∣utary effect.—Happy would it be for the country, where I first drew my breath, could such valuable instructors be obtained there!

<P>The nuptials of Philenor and Amelia were cele∣brated in the hall of the Prince's palace. Raven∣zar was at the head of the brilliant company of friends and citizens there assembled,</P>

<P>Dinner was served up in a magnificent apartment adjoining the hall. A concert of music was per∣formed, at intervals, till the company arose from table. The most perfect temperance was habitual here. Their repast consisted of every wholesome delicacy. But, on this island of perpetual health, none feasted on flesh. Here no creature's blood

Here the beautiful variety of creatures enjoyed their various pleasures undistur∣bed, and lived in amity with man; and with him waited the illustrious day, not far off, when all shall be invested with immortality.</P>

<P>IT was on the first day of the eighth year of the establishment of Ravenzar, at noon they arriv∣ed; after a long absence in various parts of the world. Prince Nytan had transacted the affairs of his friend, effected an happy revolution in his native country, which held for several years, in which Rodrigo swayed the sceptre. A counter revolution dethroned him. He was the friend of Nytan, the pupil of Ravenzar. By their aid, he with a few adherents to virtue, was soon rendered secure and happy in this favoured isle. The Prince with his illustrious friends, had visited the court of Renien, after having compleated his other affairs abroad.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It was about this time, (as related by a Chinese wri∣ter, <HI>Leinshan</HI>) the Emperor Renien paid a visit to his son, and was received by his friends and fellow citizens with the greatest respect.</P><P>Another writer relates, that the vessel which conveyed the Emperor, was by a storm, drove on the rocks and split to pieces. That the fairy Leingreing descended to his rescue, in a magnificent vehicle drawn by dragons. She was accompanied by two females of exquisite beau∣ty. The spacious vehicle received the whole company of the Emperor, his two daughters and attendants. Kin∣dred minds, when they meet, soon become united in the bands of endearing friendship. They were all safely con∣veyed, by the fairy to Prince Nytans palace, where they remained several days when the Fairy announced her purpose of departing with her lovely companions. Ereng and Yerrie, the Emperors daughters, were seized with the most poignant grief at the thoughts of a separation from their newly-acquired friends. They were twin sisters; and the Fairy had lately taken them into her protection, having relieved them from the deepest poverty and afflic∣tion. This story is affecting and interesting. The Fai∣ry Leingreing was conveying them to a recess she had pro∣vided for them; where they were to compleat their ed∣ucation, and after a series of happy events they were to become inhabitants of Ravenzar. The Fairy perceiving the grief occasioned by this separation, assured them of an happy meeting in a few months in the Emperors palace. The Emperor after enjoying several weeks the pleasures of Ravenzar returned to his own dominions, full of its won∣der's; and it was a pleasure to a mind like his to ac∣knowledge the superiority of Ravenzar.</P></NOTE>

This was the day of their return to their beloved fellow-citizens. The shore was crowded to re∣ceive them, and congratulate their arrival. The sun beamed forth with unusual splendors, and na∣ture added new graces to her enchanting smiles!</P>
<P>A grand feast was served up in the hall and the courts and lawns around it; and the whole city en∣tertained, without the least confusion among so vast a multitude. There were concerts of music at proper intervals, and the illustrious assembly broke not up till long after the usual hour of repose.</P>
<P>Philenor and Amelia had been persuaded to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all thoughts of returning to their country villa;
<PB N="149" REF="038495_0148_10122D9682D714D0"/>
and the neices of Amelia were become so attached to the families of Prince Nytan and Gesseng, that nothing could afford them more pleasure than the resignation of the villa. They were now accom∣modated with buildings and gardens adjoining the Prince's. For which purpose the mountains were levelled to a great extent. One high wall enclosed all the gardens and buildings of the three friends. Nothing ever equalled their beauty and magnifi∣cence. The resigned villa was made a present to Randor, one of the sailors ship-wrecked with Phi∣lenor. He manufactured the finest of linen. Thus was this sailor raised from the lowest state of wretch∣edness, by means of Ravenzar and the three friends; and placed in the happiest situation in the finest country in the world. The unfortunate and op∣pressed are jyoifully received by the citizens of Ra∣venzar, formed by Heaven to benevolence. The Deity ever looks with melting pity on the unisera∣ble and destitute. Not one escapes his all-seeing eye; and for every one he appears, at the proper hour and moment of relief. The Prince frequent∣ly spent a solitary hour in his chamber in the grove, the chamber which reminded him of past affecting scenes. There he often thought of his rural retreat in China, and the happiness it afforded his friends. He was still fond of that pleasant recess of his own forming. There he likewise wrote to his sisters. The following extract from one of his letters is at once expressive of his fondness for that retirement, and the affectionate and exalted sentiments of his heart. And his memoirs of Elvina are far from unentertaining. The sisters, when they received the epistle, were sitting together in one of its most delightful chambers over their tea. It gave indeed an heightened relish to their evenings repast. The Prince, after relating some interesting domestic af∣fairs,
<PB N="150" REF="038495_0149_10123F4812B064B0"/>
thus continues, 'And why are we severed from each other at so great a distance? Is it not to ren∣der our pleasure more extatic, when we meet? Add to this, the other pleasures of absent friends in each other, and the pleasing, the transporting expecta∣tion of futute meeting.—O! my dear sisters, how far surpassing the most sanguine hopes is our felici∣ty here? With what an illustrious groupe of friends am I encircled! what astonished success hath at∣tended our benevolent exertions! and what a di∣vine accession of celestial aid hath exalted our glory and happiness, beyond the power of language to express! But soon, very soon will you converse with a few of us, in your happy recess. Ah! sacred, volup∣tuous retirement! Thee shall we often revisit; thy romantic apartments—thy delicious walks. There shall we talk of the refined happiness of our highly privileged society; and deplore with you, the vices and errors of that world from which we are detach∣ed. How far, how exceeding far, are mankind distanced from just ideas of living—from the true enjoyment of existence. These arise only from a just knowledge of the Deity, constant dependance upon and unreserved confidence in him. Hence we reason justly, think and act wisely; and our day is al∣ways clear and serene. Whereas, in the world, (those excepted to whom we have a commissioned access) men really live together more like infernals than rationals. Their lusts, pride and vanity ren∣der them self-tormentors, and perpetual plagues to each other. How have I seen it in societies—in families! There real worth and true modesty are strangers. They are ignorant of themselves, and the grand assemblies or pure and shining intel∣ligences that behold them, though invisible to mortal sight; and of the omnipresent Deity. But a divine reform is not far distant <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it began with us
<PB N="151" REF="038495_0150_10123F49ED38A518"/>
to become universal. Celestial information is mak∣ing a rapid progress among the nations. They shall behold and love truth and virtue!</P>
<P>'The retired Elvina, (of whom I formerly gave you some anecdotes) hath lately entertained some of us in her romantic abode. You will be surprised when I acquaint you she married to the venerable Dargenn. They have enlarged the boundaries of their dwelling in the forest. I must place some val∣uable friends around them.</P>
<P>Elvina still retains, in a great measure, her pe∣culiarities and gloominess of mind, notwithstanding her change of condition. She hath expressed some∣thing of them, and her melancholy turn, in a paper, which I found on the carpet in her little temple (as she calls it) embowered with trees, that give a deep shade, suited to the gloom of its owner. It is ad∣dressed to the creator, and is the following.</P>
<P>'Wherefore, O source of intellectual light! am I thus perpetually involved in darkness—in the grossest ignorance. What crimes did I perpetrate in my former state of existence, ere I had a being in this world of wretchedness? Why am I thus miserable—thus distanced from thee by whom only I exist?</P>
<P>'Thou art good—unquestionably good and kind. Wherefore are so many millions destitute of real happiness—involved in vice and misery? Why re∣mainest thou at a distance from those who seek thee? And why am I thus isolated from society, as not like the rest of the human species;—thus incapa∣ble of social converse? I cannot attain it. But I would converse with the good, the gener∣ous; with those only would I associate, wherever they are to be found. But I am void of understand∣ing. Wilt thou not reform this heart of mine? Wilt thou not present me with valuable friends, in∣capable
<PB N="152" REF="038495_0151_10123F4BFA846478"/>
of deceit and folly, pure as the chrystal stream—of gentlest manners, made up of kindness, formed in thy likeness.</P>
<P>'Reach forth the hand of benignity and love, O best and loveliest of beings—heal, raise, and ex∣alt the lowest of thy creatures; that she may be∣come cheerful and glad in thee tranquil and se∣rene—at rest and peace in thee—that she may pos∣sess a gaiety of heart that is of thee; not like that of the foolish, And why hast thou destined so very few to be wise and good? May thy creature de∣mand of thee? why suffered perpetually to err? Why are we not unchangeably established in rec∣titude? Thou hast given us pleasures; we know not how to enjoy them: but convert them into pains, distresses, agonies and horrid despair. Yet thou art most assuredly good tender and kind: and thy justice arises from thy goodness. None could pos∣sess a good thought, a rational desire, a tender sym∣pathising heart unless inspired by thee. Appear in thy divine excellencies. Say, I am thy friend, and I will sustain thee; I am thy richest, thy change∣less, thy exhaustless treasure, thy glory and joy. Then shall I arise on the wings of love, and diffuse light, and joy, and felicity around. Draw us to thy∣self. Unveil thy beauties to our sight. Then, and then only shall we live. For most surely thou in∣tendest our felicity, and nothing can thwart thy in∣tention. Thou who art happy, perfectly happy; and good, perfectly good; must delight in our per∣fection and happiness. Whence, O whence this veil of darkness? Haste to rend it from our hearts! But I fear alas! I ask that which I desire not. We are in love with our eccentricity. We delight to wallow in our pollution. We desire felicity, but are averse to the means through which it is ob∣tained. We would feign effect impossibilities; and
<PB N="153" REF="038495_0152_10123F4F2BA508E0"/>
reap the delicious fruits of virtue in the thorny fields of vice. Thou Almighty! All-benificent! art able to rectify these disorders, and dispose each heart to good.</P>
<P>'Elvina, thou lovest thy husband: but alas! to attract his affections, thou hast nothing—nothing lovely or amiable. He married thee to take care of thee and thy interest. He must despise thee, though he pities thee. Would to Heaven thou hadst one agreeable quality! where wilt thou hide thyself!</P>
<LG>
<L>All comfortless I wander through the groves,</L>
<L>Where happy birds carol, and sing their loves!</L>
<L>They're innocent and free, whilst I'm a slave,</L>
<L>In chains of darkness bound: O for a darker grave;</L>
<L>Where not a gleam of light, to shew my woe,</L>
<L>And no relief, could find a passage through!</L>
<L>Sweet songsters! you I envy not: sing on,</L>
<L>Then rest till morn, and hail the rising sun!</L>
</LG>
<P>'The present situation of Elvina's mind is owing to former ill-usage, and bad health. The regimen prescribed for her will be effectual. She will re∣cover. A large fortune afforded her the means of forming her solitary habition. Dargenn conducts with much prudence.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">'Yes, I believe the purpose of Heaven is our im∣mortal felicity, said Dargen, I pretend not to deny it. Indeed the argument appears unanswerable against the in∣fidels. Do they imagine, said he, the Creator formed creatures to curse their maker? Which they must do, if he made but to destroy; gave existence but to annihilate. For a continuation of that being is of all things the most desirable. And do we know we must forever cease to exist, that our life may be the more miserable? This makes the Creator a malevolent being, who merits the curse of his creatures. Then every thing great, good, and glorious, are sources of misery, and vain is virtue. Neither have we need of grateful hearts. What have we for which to be thankful, if born only to see good, and then forever to be deprived of it. If it be so, God and his creation are utterly contemptible. No wonder men depraved and vicious, proud and insolent harbor such ideas; they are the offspring of vice and ill-nature. But the virtuous are as sore of their future, as of their pre∣sent being and bliss. They know infinite perfection accomplishes endless being the happiness; and that noth∣ing is more impossible than our total annihilation.</NOTE> Her few attendants are
<PB N="154" REF="038495_0153_10123F50D2507A00"/>
very good. I shall see my wishes accomplished. Dargenn will be happy with Elvina; and they will become instrumental of much good in future life. What a variety of miserable situations is the allot∣ment of the children of men; which arise from want of judgment, prudence and foresight, and a readiness of apprehension and discernment, and of seasonable recollection; as well as from the want of good health, the sure consequence of intemper∣ance or inattention to their peculiar constitutions! When mankind have the wisdom and fortitude to be truly temperate, their grievances will cease;—when Deity puts forth the healing hand. The cure, the effectual cure is from Heaven; and ere long will it be accomplished. The gift of existence to men—how inestimable! In contemplating it, I am filled with adoring admiration and a pleasure extat∣ic. To live—to live to God in heavenly converse with the Deity, and with each other; in all things to see, to enjoy the all-beneficent source of life and worlds;—this, my sisters, is life; life overflowing with bliss!'</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="038495_0154_10123F52CD9A8758"/>
Thus writes Prince Nytan, to his beloved and a∣miable sisters, from his little retired chamber; once the prison of his confinement, when decoyed from their agreeable society in the recess; in which they still, with their invaluable friends, spent ma∣ny a delightful hour.</P>
<P>One day when he was enjoying a solitary hour in his little chamber in the garden, who should enter its door but Sanden and Roderigo, arm in arm.—He was both surprized and transported. Springing from his seat—How agreeably sudden and unlooked for is this! cried he. Welcome dear∣est friends! I am overjoyed to see you! 'Ah my Prince! returned Sanden, this situation, this apart∣ment! well am I reminded of a cruel traitor and enemy, and of his attrocious crimes! What celestial goodness would he have blasted!' A shower of tears succeeded those words. The inside of the cham∣ber he knew, notwithstanding some alterations, to be the same in which his Prince had been formerly con∣fined, and destined to death. The Prince was great∣ly affected for a moment. But recollecting him∣self—'My dearest Sanden, cried he, how happy have my little misfortunes rendered me, by procuring me your invaluable friendship! Such, my Roderigo, is Sanden, both to you and me, that nothing can ever disturb our mutual felicity.' 'Well replied San∣den, our worthy and amiable friend shall, at con∣venient time, be made acquainted with all. You must hasten with us to the palace, to see the illus∣trious company we have brought you, and learn how it has happened, that we, whom you believed to be thousands of miles distant from each other, now meet in Ravenzar.</P>
<P>Gesseng was arrived with his fleet from China, and Ravenzar and Roderigo from the country of the latter, with great numbers of worhty families.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="038495_0155_10123F5671BDBFD8"/>
Inexpressibly joyful was the meeting of these friends and the newly acquired citizens. They were feasted several days by the inhabitants of Xuntien. Ravenzar left them on the third day from their arrival: and, as the fleet was soon to return to China, Roderigo chose to accompany Sanden, and visit that renowned empire; from whence, after a few weeks, he returned to his beloved friends; and was accommodated with Philenor's mansion in Xuntien, till further arrangements were made in his favor by the vigilence of the Prince and the citizens.</P>
<P>The principle men of Xuntien and the other cit∣ies, now often assembled with Prince Nytan to con∣sult on the interests of their country, and plan schemes of utility the most wise, the most benevolent and the most extensive. Here (writes an historian of Xuntien) was a government of a most superior kind; great∣ly resembling that of an higher order of beings, whose existence is beyond the ken of human sight, except when such of them as are commissioned from Heaven render themselves visible, and hold converse with the wise and virtuous of mankind.—Here (in this new-formed community) was displayed the most consummate wisdom, and the most excellent exam∣ples of virtue, piety, and disinterested benevolence. Here was become universally habitual, a tranquil∣ity and happiness for incalculable years. Here the citizens, of both sexes, increase beauty, and vig∣or, and every amiable accomplishment, as they ad∣vance in life. Many, several hundred years old have still all the bloom and energy of youth, the most perfect exercise of the mental powers; and wait, in cheerful expectation of the approaching period when, with immortality, all nations shall be forever united in the most pure and the most sublime enjoy∣ment
<PB N="157" REF="038495_0156_10123F5980AD6E70"/>
of existence. Happy community so highly privileged! with whom exalted intelligences supe∣rior to humanity often associate! here, too, the ten¦ants of the forests have have put off their savage na∣ture, and rejoice with man! here no noxious ani∣mal lives, nor a creature perpetrates mischief, or excites a fear! Such is the reward of virtue like that of the citizens of this favored isle!</P>
<P>Roderigo now employed most of his time in stu∣dying the affairs and manners of the country; was exceedingly happy in the friendship of his fellow-citizens, and soon became most eminently distin∣guished for his abilities and his exertions for the public good. A peculiar circumstance had attend∣ed him, even from his earliest years, and very unac∣countable, considering his many amiable qualities:—He affected not female society, though few were more capable of rendering themselves agreeable to the most engaging of the fair. His mind was ex∣alted, his heart tender and benevolent, and his ex∣terior perfectly formed. This peculiarity is to be accounted for only from the secret influence of Ra∣venzar on his mind, least an attachment should in∣terfere with a series of events that were to be pro∣ductive of his future felicity in the connubial state. Neither is it unfrequent, in this world of mysteries and eccentricities, that things, unaccountable to hu∣man wisdom and discernment, are in the chain of events wisely ordered, and in their proper place. However, the perfection of the female character, now presented to him, began to inspire other sen∣timents in his heart, than such as he perhaps with too must reason had indulged in his native country.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE mild and calm region of peace and health; where unaffected modesty and sweet affabili∣ty rendered beauty and wit enchanting, and minds cultivated with real science; was the blissful lot of Nytan, and the friends with whom he was surround∣ed—in a country destined to be the richest sample, to the world, of nature in all her loveliness, per∣fection and felicity. But his generous heart, ex∣panding with benevolence towards the human race, admitted not of his confinement, even to friends and citizens so worthy and amiable, or to an island so de∣licious, so extensive, and populated by thousands of inhabitants, every individual of which were ever ca∣pable of affording him the most agreeable entertain∣ment, the sincerest pleasure. They were citizens who delighted only in real virtue, and whose manners were pure and refined; and therefore could not fail of being always pleasing and engaging to a mind formed like his. But he loved to range a∣broad in quest of adventures indeed of the most excellent and superior kind; not in the pursuit of vain, foolish ambition, wanton pleasure; but
<PB N="159" REF="038495_0158_10123F5D07FCFF88"/>
after objects of benevolence such objects as most expressively called for those friendly aids, those gen∣erous attentions, which Nytan was formed, by the source of goodness, to in a world administer, in olved in the disgraces and miseries inseparable from folly and vice; in nations whose great are so meanly lit∣tle, and whose instructors and guides are so basely degenerate, so uninformed in real wisdom and vir∣tue.—In the pursuit of such adventures, through which only true glory is acquired, he was unwea∣ried, bold and enterprising; discouraged by no la∣bours or difficulties, deterred by no dangers.</P>
<P>It was on one of his benevolent excursions to Bagdad, he was accompanied by Philenor, Silena, Amelia and her lovely neices. Aledden, the grand vizier's son, had no power to resist the charms of Maria. He first beheld her at the country seat his father possessed a few miles from the city; at which he, with his guests, were only refreshing themselves, in order to proceed to his most favoured seat twelve miles further, where were the most magnificent gar∣dens. It was there the grand vizier, having lately become a widower, chiefly resided. Aleddin's bu∣siness prevented his attending the company to that seat, and the next day he was to go on urgent affairs to a far distant town. He had therefore but a mo∣ments conversation with Maria, in which he ex∣pressed to her how painful was the obligation he was under to separate himself from her and her worthy and amiable friends. When they were gone forward on their route, he gave way to chagrin and grief at being so unfortunately circumstanced: when, on looking over the papers he was to take with him on his journey, he found to his joy, an es∣sential document missing. This made it necessary that he should set out in the evening to wait on his father for the paper he had neglected to leave.

When he arrived within view of the house, he was in raptures to see Maria on the road, far distanced from the rest of the company, who were walking. He hastened to her, and, dismounting from his horse, begged leave to attend her; informing her of the circumstance that rendered him so happy as to be∣hold her once more before he sat out on his journey. In expressing to her his affection he was heard by Maria with greatest apparant indifference; and at length she insisted upon his entirely dropping the subject. When they were arrived to the house, he waited on his father in his closet, who surprised at his own negligence, gave him the paper, insisting on his returning after supper, and hastening his jour∣ney. He knew the necessity of this too well to ob∣ject. He was happy however in the presence of the fair object of his affection at supper, and with the company and conversation of her illustrious friends. Ritiring to a chamber, he penned an e∣pistle to Maria, which having finished, and left with a servant on whom he could depend to deliver to her, if possible, that evening, he returned to the company, bade them adieu, and departed to prepare for his journey on the morrow.</P>
<P>When Maria perused the epistle, it presented to her a mind formed to her fondest wishes. At the bottom of it she read the following lines—</P>
<Q><L>A mind so sweetly form'd to love</L>
<L>As thine, sure ne'er can cruel prove,</L>
<L>Hence hope the lover's heart sustains;</L>
<L>Despair suspends, and sooths his pains.</L>
<L>Then view him, fair one, as he is,</L>
<L>Without deceit and mean disguise.</L>
<L>O! <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his fondest purposes,</L>
<L>And kindly seal his future bliss!</L>
<L>The faithless and inconstant lover</L>
<L>Thy piercing eyes must soon discover:</L>
<L><PB N="161" REF="038495_0160_10123F63287888E0"/>
But Aleddin his heart reveals,</L>
<L>And not a single thought conceals.</L></Q>
<P>As Aleddin had intreated for an answer to his e∣pistle; Maria after several hours musing on the subject of it, in a delightful grove whither she often retired, at length took her pen, and complied with his request. Their correspondence continued till his return when they became constant visitants to the grove, and admired together the pleasant scenes around it,</P>
<P>After a few days Philenor attended the grand vizier to his house in town to assist him some bu∣siness. Amelia and Silena visited the Sultana. Prince Nytan having spent an hour in writing, walked out alone.</P>
<P>At a small distance from the house, was a large wood. A pleasant opening in it invited him to en∣ter. One agreeable view succeeding another, drew him forward, till he found himself on the further side of the wood; and a vast plain before him, which seemed bounded only by the horizon. Find∣ing himself still inclined to walk, and excited by some degree of curiosity to know what terminated so extensive a plain, he pursued his course over it till he saw before him, a large building, environed by an high wall, be perceived one of the leaves of the gate open, which an increased curiosity deter∣mined him to enter. When he had entered the gate, he walked through a grand porch of marble, furnished with soffas and a carpet of cloth of gold. He made a stand in the court, and looked on all sides to see if any one observed him. But no crea∣ture appeared, at which he was greatly surprised. He walked on to the hall, the gate of which was o∣pen, having a curtain of silk and gold partly drawn before it. Here he made another stand, and knock∣ed
<PB N="162" REF="038495_0161_10123F64D144CAA8"/>
with his staff, at the gate. No one yet appear∣ing, he repeated knocking, but could make nobody hear. He then put aside the curtain, and entered the hall, calling aloud as he advanced into it; but to no purpose. He neither saw nor heard any person or creature. The hall he observed to be furnished with the most profuse magnificence. The windows being open, presented to his view an extensive and delightful garden, and the birds charmed him with sweet melody; the only existing beings he had per∣ceived. He sat to one of the windows, some time, to rest and entertain himself with the beautiful pros∣pects of beds of flowers, spacious gravel walks lined with fruit trees, and distant groves, and raised grounds which extended a great distance before him. At length he imagined he heard human cries in a distant part of the garden; and a door, which led into it, being open on the right hand, he hasten∣ed through it, and walked down the garden, on the side from whence the sounds he heard seemed to arise. As he advanced nearer he was convinced they were the cries of a person in distress. He quickened his pace, and entered, through a small gate, into a thick grove. In few minutes, he beheld too plainly, what had a∣larmed him. In the centre of the grove, was a large vacancy, where three Africans were beating a man who was almost naked.</P>
<P>The building and the grounds about it, were the property of a rich Turk; who having lost a lovely and amiable wife, the month after his marriage, had retired thither from society. He was attended only by a few African slaves, who taking advantage of his deep retirement, and incensed against him on account of former rigorous treatment, aimed at his death, and the possession of his treasures. Prince Nytan having freed the sufferer, and secured the blacks was entertained by the Turk, Siedden, with
<PB N="163" REF="038495_0162_10123F67680047B8"/>
the most grateful acknowledgments. One of the slaves, (dissenting from the wicked purposes of the assassins,) they had confined; not daring to touch his life, because he was of a great family in their own country; to which they intended returning; having secretly provided every thing for that pur∣pose. To this honest and worthy slave, Sieddin gave his freedom, and a sum of money, by which he was enabled to return to Africa, if he thought proper. Nytan likewise persuaded him to free the others, to pardon and dismiss them; offering a sup∣ply of money from his own purse to defray their expences in returning home. He conversed with them in their own language. He enlightened their minds and inspired them, at length with unfeigned contrition. Few sons of Kings thought and acted like this Prince and heir to the Chinese empire. Sieddin admired his virtues, listened with eagerness and delight to his instructive conversation, and ac∣ceded with pleasure, by him before unfelt, to his benevolent designs.</P>
<P>Thus was our amiable philanthropist acting in concert with Heaven in deducing good from evil. The dissenting slave, whose name was Zaddguin, was transported with joy at this unexpected turn of affairs, this divine interposition to rescue the dis∣tressed and reclaim the vicious and abandoned. Prince Nytan learned of Zaddquin, that Africa scarcely ever produced a more amiable and virtu∣ous monarch than was Mingeng, the sovereign of the realm of which he was a subject. 'He was an enemy to every species of slavery (said Zaddquin.) He suffers none of his subjects to be concerned in that inhuman traffic. The Almighty, said he, will avenge it by a dreadful punishment.' 'Yes, an∣swered Nytan, the emancipation of the human race from every species of slavery is not far distant. The
<PB N="164" REF="038495_0163_10123F6A1C831280"/>
mists of ignorance are fast dispersing. You, Zadd∣quin, shall carry a letter from me to your sovereign. He is the friend of humanity, and will become an instrument of much good in the African world.'</P>
<P>Thus by the benign interposition of Heaven and the friend of mankind, Zaddquin again beheld his native country, and his family. He presented the Prince's letter to his sovereign. Mingeng profited by its instructions, and many of his subjects, after a correspondence was opened between him and king Zanger, whom the Prince recommended to his friendship, besides furnishing him with suitable books in his own language. Useful knowledge be∣gan to make a rapid progress through those two Af∣rican realms.</P>
<P>Sieddin became a convert to the principles of freedom and truth; between whom, and Prince Nytan, a correspondence was settled; when the lat∣ter, taking leave of his newly acquired friends, sat out on his walk back to the grand vizier's. On his way through the wood, he beheld a youth engaged with two others, and fighting valiantly for his life. They were robbers who attacked him. The Prince advanced unobserved, and, aiming a stone at the head of one of the robbers, brought him to the ground: and a second stone levelled the other robber at his side. The young man found himself at liberty, without seeing the hand that did the execution on his adversaries. Nytan soon discovered himself; and advancing to the youth congratulated him on his safety, offering himself for company through the rest of the wood.</P>
<P>'I am an inhabitant of this wood, replied the young man. The mansion of my friends is not far from hence: and, as I am obliged to you for my life, let me prevail with you, my noble and gener∣ous friend, to walk home with me, and take some
<PB N="165" REF="038495_0164_10123F6BC78AE498"/>
refreshment, that I may there have an opportunity of shewing my gratitude.'</P>
<P>This youth was of an handsome and engaging form; and there was something in his countenance that gave an additional charm to his address, which agreeably compelled the Prince to accept of his in∣vitation. They walked together in a path that led through the thickest of the wood. At length a grad∣ual opening discovered the young stranger's seques∣tered abode, which they soon reached. The man∣sion was elegant, and surrounded with a variety of fruit trees. They entered a handsome apartment, in which sat a man and a woman, who appeared in the vigor and bloom of youth. 'O reward the man who hath saved me from robbers,'—Exclaimed the youth. 'Welcome Prince Nytan, cried they, ris∣ing. Your appearance exactly agrees with the grand vizier's description of the first of men.' And they cordially embraced. 'Such as I am said the Prince, I profess myself your friend and servant, and a sincere lover of you and yours.' 'What we speak, said the beautiful woman, is warm from our hearts. The character given you by the grand vi∣zier, was sufficient to inspire our love, respect and esteem, amiable Prince, without the additional ob∣ligation to affection and gratitude, on account of the service you have rendered this youth, the richest treasure of which we boast. Pray Prince be seat∣ed; and henceforward call this house, and its in∣habitants, your own, and likewise all they possess. Now we have seen Prince Nytan under our roof, we can say we have lived to some valuable purpose.' The Prince, blushing, sat down, saying he was bound to exert himself to become worthy of their affections. And I find continued he, I have more worthy and inestimable friends than the grand vizier
<PB N="166" REF="038495_0165_10123F6EEEFEF9B0"/>
had advised me of. But, pray let me be no longer ignorant by what names to call them.'</P>
<P>'Call me Debournon, said the elder, and the young man, whom you have made forever obliged to you, Parcellus. My fair partner's name is Sa∣bina. Is she not fair and handsome, Prince, for a woman who has seen her two hundred and fiftieth year? and I am only a year older. There hath been no very perceivable alteration in our health's or persons, for above two hundred and thirty years. We are both the adopted children of your illustrious friend Ravenzar.' How you astonish me! replied Nytan. This day hath been to me a day of won∣ders: and you, sire, will be of my opinion, when I have related to you its events! But why are not you, with your little family (if I see all of it before me) inhabitants of the island of Ravenzar? For I am persuaded you have been long (ere now) quali∣fied for that happy country.' 'I will inform you, returned he, presently. But first let my Sabina set before us refreshment. And while we are eating and drinking together, I will relate to you our little history. Sabina then laid the cloth in another room, and placed the table before them, near a door, which being open, commanded a view of the gar∣den, fields, and groves; the woods being on either side of the delightful prospect; which the declin∣ing sun rendered the more beautiful and charming; whilst the variety of birds entertained them with their sprightly songs.</P>
<P>Debournon resumed his discourse.—'My dear Prince, said he, illustrious as you are, and of noblest descent; yet your mind, far more noble, disdains not the man of meanest birth, whose virtues render him a useful member of society, and prepare him for the enjoyment of sublimer pleasures and honors than this transitory scene affords? Permit me to say, my
<PB N="167" REF="038495_0166_10123F70D79EFB58"/>
beloved and revered sire, (interrupted Nytan) that I value not myself for being born a Prince, but on∣ly for that degree of virtue and useful knowledge, which, by the bounty of Heaven I possess. I have renounced kingdoms; disdained the titles of royal∣ty and nobility, (they are beneath my ambition) and glory in being only a citizen of Ravenzar, formed by men, who had no honors of which to boast, but such as arose from their probity and benevolence. Those only convey real honor to their possessors. Pardon, sire my interruption, and let me intreat you to proceed in your relation.' 'My parents resum∣ed Debournon, were the meanest of mechanics in Bagdad; yet, free from disgrace—they were honest and industrious. I lost them very early, and was left a poor friendless destitute orphan. At a me∣lancholy date, from my existence, the benevolent genie Ravenzar was pleased to take notice of me; and, after a few necessary gifts and good counsels, he one day told me that if I inclined to agriculture, he would buy me a piece of ground, stock it, and provide me with a servant to assist my labour. I expressed my gratitude, and the pleasure I should take in a country life, provided I might have time to prosecute my studies. For I was exceeding fond of books, and possessed an eager desire of learning every thing that was attainable from the few left me by my father. The Genie highly applauded my passion for science, and promised me his assistance, and a number of books. Labour, added he, if ex∣ercised with a just temperance, will be of great ad∣vantage to your health; and render you better sit∣ted for study. In a word, before another month c∣lapsed from the decease of my father, who survived my mother but a year, that generous friend of the poor, settled me on a part of these lands which I now possess, and afterwards added to my farm a tract
<PB N="168" REF="038495_0167_10123F7404D80168F"/>
of land containing two thousand acres. In a few years, by his assistance, I built this house, and let out the smaller one I had occupied, to a tenant of his chusing, who had sons old enough and capable of cultivating a thousand acres to great advantage. My income increased, I soon grew rich, and capa∣ble of affording assistance to others, after the noble example of my benefactor. Without my inform∣ing him he knew of the charities I had bestowed, and applauded my generosity and the prudence and discretion with which I exercised it. When I was arrived to the age of five and twenty, he entered my apartment with a young damsel fair as the morn. 'I have brought you a worthy female partner, said he, say do you like her for a wife?' 'Who, an∣swered I, can be otherwise than charmed and cap∣tivated with so much beauty and loveliness. If I might be so happy as to gain the affections'—'You have gained them already, interrupted Ravenzar, she is yours. I brought her up for you. Stand forth then and be married.' And married we were, before we knew, scarely, what we were about. The Genie having married, embraced, and pro∣nounced his blessing upon us, left us to ourselves; saying as he went away, 'I will call upon you in the morning, and spend some time with you. Let your wife rise early, and prepare us a good break∣fast.' As he refused to stay to supper, (it being that hour) we eat and drank by ourselves, and went to bed.</P>
<P>'Before sun-rise, the Genie was at the door, in his chariot drawn by eight horses. We were ashamed to be found in bed; and rising with the utmost expedition, went out to receive him, with the best excuses we could make for not being earlier risers, and being in waiting for his coming. Four men-servants followed him into the house, bearing
<PB N="169" REF="038495_0168_10123F7658697748"/>
a trunk, which they sat down, and then retired. 'The trunk, and its contents are a present to you, my friends (said Ravenzar). It contains the most valuable of diamonds. Exchange the greater part of them with the jewellers in Bagdad.—They are worth twelve thousand pieces of gold.—Share them among the needy and unfortunate. Invisible pow∣ers will direct your minds aright.' 'Ye are our guardian angels! exclaimed Sabina.' 'We are your best friends on earth, returned he. Unseen by you we instruct you; and save you from innumer∣able dangers, of which you are insensible, and yet we ourselves are likewise instructed and sustained by superior power. All the happy intelligences, throughout the creation, of various orders,▪ are continually serving each other in kindest offices of love; and are attentive to the affairs of mankind. O! how great is the source of our be∣ing, the Creator and upholder of the Universe! How good! how kind! how tender!—It is this—it is this, my friends, that enflames our love, and inspires us, with unremitting activity, in copying after his works of benevolence and love I Renew then your strength, ye children of my affection—from the same divine impetus ▪ in the labours, of your happy choice—of diffusing true knowledge and felicity, wherever your influence is appointed to extend!' Breakfast being ready, we sat down; with our respected guest, feasting our minds more rich∣ly and luxuriantly with his discourse; which charm∣ed and enlivened, while it instructed. 'The city of Bagdad, said he, (resuming his discourse at the breakfast table) is large and full of people, of dif∣ferent nations and religions as absurd as they are inimical to the real prosperity and happiness of the professors. There are a few, however, and but a
<PB N="170" REF="038495_0169_10123F78B77D2F58"/>
few, whose minds are not wholly perverted by er∣roneous principles and depraved manners. Those I shall, in a short time, carry you to see; that com∣mencing friendship with them, you may become in∣strumental of confirming them in real virtue and just sentiments. The present Sultan is endowed with a great share of wisdom, considering in what a depraved world he was brought up, and the absur∣dities and political errors of the times. He is stu∣dying a greater reform among his subjects; by which, he will answer the wife purposes of Heaven, as to future events. He is a friend to liberty, but will by no means succeed in his endeavours to pro∣mote its cause. His life is thereby endangered: yet Heaven, for its own wise reasons, suffers him to be too eager and too violent.'</P>
<P>'To live in a land of liberty, said Debournon, and under a mild government, where peace and good order are not only objects of solicitous attention, but actually maintained; are temporal blessings high∣ly to be estimated; not the least of which is liberty of conscience, and free enquiry.' 'I am going to take you on a tour through Europe in a few days, returned the Genie, and then you will see what ex∣cellent use men make of liberty, and mild govern∣ments. But the most flourishing of mere selfish things, can be but of short duration, and their con∣tinuance very uncertain. The glory and happiness, derived from undissembled virtue and benevolence, can have no period to their existence. They sur∣vive the rise and fall of kingdoms and empires. They reach into eternity! Happy, those minds el∣evated above the follies and trifles that engage the attention of the greater part of mankind! they are Heaven-taught! they are divine! and are qualify∣ing for the regions of uninterrupted bliss! I was intending to say more of the Sultan, and the influ∣ence
<PB N="171" REF="038495_0170_10123F7B3AB9B4E8"/>
of some of the principal men of several nations of Europe, but we shall understand each other bet∣ter, after we have made the tour of Europe. And I fancy, when you are again returned hither, you will be apt to prefer your recluse situation, to the fair∣est prospects you will have found in the civilized nations, whose leading men have been too unfortu∣nate in forgetting to take proper care of themselves, before they undertook the care of others. A sad time of blunders, when wise men and politicians begin at the wrong end! you look as though you wondered how it so happens. But I will tell you the cause in a few words. They want good hearts. They have existence, but know not how to enjoy it: they boast in themselves, and are ignorant of their own weakness, and blind to futurity, they set their wills against God's. Yet for their good we gladly la∣bour; and the happy result is not far off.'</P>
<P>Ravenzar now rose from table, and bid us adieu. 'I shall see you again, in two or three days, said he, as he entered his chariot, in the mean time, all happiness attend you—the happiness of virtuous and benevolent minds!'</P>
<P>'But not to weary you with too many particulars of a life of more than two hundred years, let it suf∣fice to add—that, I found myself vastly improved in knowledge, after travelling, with Ravenzar, through the nations of Europe. On my return, I beheld, with rapture, my Sabina holding two lovely babes in her arms! they were twins, a boy and a girl. No words are capable of expressing our mu∣tual joy on this happy meeting, after an absence of near eleven months. But, to contract my relation in as narrow limits as possible,—in twenty years, Sabina bore me fifteen children, six daugh∣ters, and nine sons. Ravenzar visited us often; and carried away with him all our children as soon
<PB N="172" REF="038495_0171_10123F7D96C18BD8"/>
as they were arrived to years of discretion, and set∣tled them in different parts of the world, under his particular care and inspection. We were recon∣ciled to his proceedings, from the excellent reasons he produced. But they are now citizens of your Republic, though as yet, to you not personally known. We shall however, soon be with them there. And then they will be ready to afford you some agreeable entertainment in the history of their lives, till they commenced citizens of Ravenzar. With their history are necessarily interwoven some remarkable anecdotes of Sabina and myself. The Genie carried us, a number of times, to visit them. Sometimes we travelled with him in his aerial car, at others in his chariot, or on horseback; which pleasingly varied the delights of our journeys, oc∣casioning some curious and profitable, as well as a∣greeable adventures. My children's children are likewise dispersed in various countries. After the same manner, and for the same reasons as were ours, were they separated from their parents; who, however, cheerfully resigned to superior wisdom, patiently wait the day when they are to behold them in Ravenzar. Parcellus, the youth before you, is a native of China; and, (however it may surprize my friend) is the brother of Gesseng, the compan∣ion of your former travels. He was no one knew how) separated from his parents, at the age of e∣leven. Ravenzar brought him to me, at the age of seventeen. He was my assistant, friend and com∣panion. Here he pursued his studies, and made the greatest proficiency in all valuable science. His mind was early formed to virtue. He is wor∣thy of your friendship and love.'</P>
<P>Nytan arose from his soffa—'Let me, then, said he, embrace the brother of Gesseng. You have, continued he, my friendship, and my love. Hence∣forth,
<PB N="173" REF="038495_0172_10123F8004521828"/>
share with me, with Gesseng and our other friends, in the bounties which indulgent Heaven hath bestowed upon us. What a new and unlook∣ed for joy awaits your worthy and amiable brother, in which I shall likewise have the pleasure of par∣ticipating with him and his family! A happy fam∣ily, surrounded with happy friends; amongst whom I hope soon to see you, my Parcellus, and you, my respected and loved friends!' We wait only leave from Ravenzar, replied Debournon.—But night admonishes us of rest, and you will not leave us till morning. The grand vizier, promised to introduce us to you, and your friends; which I expected he would have done before this.' 'Let us then retire to rest, if you please, returned the Prince; tomor∣row, I purpose to bring my friends hither. They then retired to apartments, which, opening into each other, allowed them the pleasure of conversing, till sleep gently closed their eyes.</P>

<P>THE variety of surprising adventures and pleas∣ing discoveries, consequent upon a morn∣ing's excursion, afforded Nytan the most agreeable entertainment, as he walked to the Grand Vizier's seat, after breakfasting with Debournon, and his engaging little family; to whom he was delight∣ing himself with the thoughts of introducing his friends, as he entered the grand viziers court. Si∣lena and Amelia, who saw him, from the window of the apartment in which they were mournfully sitting, arose hastily, and went out to meet him. Their grief was too great to be concealed, however alleviated by her appearance. 'Alas! cried he, my lovely women! whence the sorrow so strongly de∣pictured in your countenances, for the first time, since the happy moments that united our hearts in the purest affection?' O my dear lord, replied Si∣lena, (as they mutually embraced) can you inform us of Julia and Maria?—Julia and Maria! returned he, surprised, are they not with you? hath any thing ill befallen our lovely girls?'—Amelia was speech∣less with grief. She received the embraces of Ny∣tan in silence; but with flowing tears, expressive of the deepest affliction. They sat down in the
<PB N="175" REF="038495_0174_10123F841881D590"/>
porch. Be comforted my dear Amelia, said Nytan. Your nieces, I perceive, have absented themselves longer than you expected, and you fear some dis∣aster. But yield not to such fear. Repose in hea∣ven. At this moment, I perceive my error, which hath occasioned your affliction.—My error, return∣ed Amelia, in bringing my girls abroad in this evil and disastrous world.' 'Blame not yourself, my dear friend, rejoined Nytan. Of myself I have had too good an opinion, I only am to blame. Nor will I rest a moment till I restore your nieces to your arms. Silena, instruct me what course to pursue. I will set out immediately. Where are Philenor and the grand Vizier?' 'They are gone in search, answered Amelia.' 'We have, added Silena search∣ed every where in vain. But I am not without great hopes—if you enquire once more in Bagdad, where they were last seen.'—Selina then related all that had happened the preceding day, and that morn∣ing. 'I go then to Bagdad, said he, but I conjure you, my dear ladies, he comforted. I shall bring you agreeable tidings.</P>
<P>After some anxious enquiries, the Prince, by means of his little spying glass discovered the girls in Philenors new built mansion. He immediately gladdened the hearts of Amelia and his Selina, with a relation of his success, and carried them to De∣bournon's At dinner they expressed a wish to see their admired host, with his little family settled in their happy country, and likewise the grand vizier, whom they equally admired and respected.</P>
<P>They had scarcely risen from table, when they perceived Ravenzar's chariot. Debournon and Ny∣tan hastened into the court to receive him. Alight∣ing from the chariot, he was followed by Parcellus, who then handed out Sabina. 'I picked up these good people, said Ravenzar, in yonder field; and I
<PB N="176" REF="038495_0175_10123F87353E0CF8"/>
assure you, my dear friends, I value myself on the acquisition. It is of that inestimable worth that we should not know how to do without it. Such (contin∣ued he, taking a hand of Debournon's, and one of Nytan's, and directing his expressive eyes on Sa∣bina and Parcellus; then on Selina and Amelia, who were advancing towards them, as they walked up the court)—such are the links of mutual affection, in which we are united by the divine source of life and love; that we must be inevitably unhappy in the loss of one. But, the chain of love and friend∣ship can never be broken or impaired, by momen∣tary separations, or casualties incident to the present state. It will grow stronger and brighter with the increase of years, and be perpetuated, through end∣less revolving ages, in the world of perfection. Permit me, my dear friends, added he, (when the last mentioned ladies joined them) to felicitate you on this happy meeting; and which I may safely venture to say, we shall ever recollect with plea∣sure.' 'It is, I am persuaded, replied Nytan, an unspeakable happiness to us all, to see and hear our noble and generous friend and benefactor. Some of us have been afflicted of late: yet the indulgence of Heaven has converted that affliction into increas∣ing joy; and your presence, most beloved and res∣pected friend, exalts it to the highest.' 'The af∣fliction of my friends, and their joy, are mine, re∣turned Ravenzar.—But, added he, perhaps, what I have to communicate, may serve to convince us, that our mutual joy and pleasure is not now so consum∣mate, but that it may admit of an higher elevation.' Being entered the apartment, and seated, the Genie continued his discourse; having by his last words, excited the curiosity, and raised the expectations of every one.</P>
<P>'The time is fulfilled, said he, addressing himself
<PB N="177" REF="038495_0176_10123F89A714CA90"/>
to Debournon and Sabina. You are no longer to live in this state of separation from your children. I am come to convey you to Ravenzar, and our oth∣er friends, excepting Philenor, who will remain with the Grand Vizier, till, with his assistance, his affairs are settled; after which the aerial chamber will waft them to the abodes of peace and bliss, to∣gether with his son Aleddin. I am further to in∣form you—The Sultan was slain by his janissaries a few hours past; so that there can be no safety here for the grand vizier and his son; nor for the amiable Sultana. She is to embark with us, in a vessel of my providing, which waits on the shore. Your estate here, Debournon, you will not want. I have given it to the two robbers, who would have killed your beloved Parcellus.' He ceased speak∣ing. The company looked astonished! but their astonishment was but momentary. They were too well taught, to misconstrue the sentiments and in∣telligence designed to be conveyed, in a gayly ab∣rupt manner, by the last words of Ravenzar.—'O my benefactor and friend! the friend of all! exclaim∣ed Debournon, then your beneficence will be rich∣ly-repaid;—incapable as you are of irrational lib∣erality. Something sublimely great has influenced your procedure! the robbers then were not actual∣ly slain, as we imagined. They live—but no longer plunderers and assassins. They greatly live, hap∣py converts to virtue, and will become the friends; no more the oppressors of mankind. It must be so. And our joy will be boundless to day!' So ex∣static is the pleasure which the reform of the vicious excites in the friends of humanity.</P>
<P>'They are indeed rendered converts to virtue, resu∣med Ravenzar. Extreme necessity drove them to the road for plunder; whilst others were doing the same,
<PB N="178" REF="038495_0177_10123F8C041EBFA0"/>
with more safety, in thrones or temples. While robbers they were under my eye. But I will not de∣tain your attention, at present, in relating the means I have used with them; the murders I have pre∣vented from being perpetrated by their hands. On some future day, they will have it in their power to entertain you with their own history. Let it suffice to say, that as they are men of knowledge and penetration; they are likewise now become men of virtue and benevolence. And, as such, they are to succeed my Debournon in the same labours of love to mankind, in which he hath been here, so successfully employed. He hath, in Ravenzar, a spacious and delightful mansion prepared; which he will exchange for this, and double the number of acres he enjoyed here; situated near the road to Terman, and about five miles from that city. The Sultana we shall call upon. And what is there my friend, to hinder our supping to night in Debour∣non's mansion in Ravenzar?'</P>
<P>The will of their powerful guardian friend, was to them a law. They learned it with an extatic pleasure, and that night was it happily fulfilled.</P>
<P>Every thing fortunately occurred to hasten the marriages of the several parties. Almira, and soon after her sister Sapphira, embraced their mother, from whom they had been long separated. Her name was Adeline. She was full of the praises of the benevolent Ravenzar; who said she, (relating her story to Almira) soothed my griefs, assisted me with his advice, and at lengh conducted me to this sa∣cred asylum, placed me in a pleasant village amongst men and women, who are more like angels and se∣raphs than like children of the earth.' Sapphira had been sold for a slave to Mahumed, though never treated as such. Roderigo was vanquished by her beauty and uncommon mental accomplishments
<PB N="179" REF="038495_0178_10123F8DC48549A0"/>
and their union was to take place on the same day of that of Maria with Alexis, Julia with Aleddin, and Parcellus with Almira. A large and brilliant company were assembled for several days at Debour∣non's; from whence they rode out in parties on different routs. Ravenzar and Parcellus directed their course to the boundaries of the island, on horse∣back, through a vast forest. I am about to shew you, said Ravenzar to the latter, my private apart∣ments that you may enjoy them at your leisure, in my absence. Then I shall introduce you to the seat of our future residence, which you will find el∣egant, and in every respect adapted to your taste. As they rode through the forest, Ravenzar discours∣ed on the expected future glorious date of the world. 'Many have wrote, said he, on this subject; and im∣agine it to be only a state of uninterrupted sensual enjoyments; in which they are greatly deceived. It will be a state of the sublimest enjoyment, and of the consummation of every wish of the heart divine∣ly formed for perfect and endless felicity. It is then the Deity will unfold his beneficent plan. To that state of perfection all things tend. It is then the divine architect will, with the most exquisite skill, adorn his creation in his own beauty and com∣liness in the most eminent degrees. For this, he began his stupendous work. For this light sprang from darkness, creation shone forth in its various lustres, and intellectual day dawned upon the world. Nature had been very liberal in the bestowment of her gifts on the youth now travelling with Raven∣zar. He had a clear perception of moral and natural beauties, and was a most affectionate admi∣rer of every thing beautiful, grand and sublime. He was enraptured with the magnificent scence of na∣ture; and the progress he had already made in phi∣losophy, both natural and moral, excited in him a∣doring
<PB N="180" REF="038495_0179_10123F90DBE0E2F8"/>
wonder, and ravishing delight in contem∣plating the great power and goodness of the crea∣tor. The excellent thoughts he expressed, and his agreeable manners, were highly gratifying to his guardian friend and instructor. 'My dear Parcel∣lus, said he, words fail to express the pleasure I I take in your happy turn of mind, and the improve∣ments you have made in science and virtue. You will be a rich acquisition to all our dear and worthy friends, and one of the brightest ornaments of their society. Infinitely happy will ye be in each other. Such are the recompenses of attention to the pre∣cepts of the wise; and vast are the advantages you are now going to enjoy in this secure asylum from the many evils to which mankind are still subject. Let us strengthen each others hearts and hands in the performance of our several duties, co-operating with the Deity in his works of beneficence and love.'</P>

<Q><L>Hail Heavenly powers! whose Celestial skill</L>

<P>YOU see yonder towering pile of rocks, whose craggy summits seem blended with the silver clouds, said Ravenzar, as they approached the boun∣daries of the island. It is through <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> we are to enter my apartments. You must remain here, whilst I proceed forward to open us a passage. When it is accomplished, you will perceive it, and ride up to me. Alight then, my Parcellus, and rest awhile under these lofty trees, whose tufted foliage will defend you from the meridian rays.' Having said this, he rode on to the rocks. Parcellus seated himself on a mossy hillock, under the shade of a Palmetto; so as that he could distinctly observe the Genies progress. When the Genie was advanced to those stupendous rocks, a dark vapour suddenly concealed him wholly from the view of Parcellus. The Heavens lowered and gathered blackness! A tremendous peal of thunder shook the solid world! All nature trembled around! The youth was seiz∣ed with terror and consternation; It was as uni∣versal ruin had commenced its awful desolating ca∣reer! but, soon his fears were dissipated, by the re∣turning light, and cheering serenity of day. Ra∣venzar again appeared to his view; he beheld a
<PB N="182" REF="038495_0181_10123F9640CF5238"/>
wide aperture in the rocks, through which the Ge∣nie entered, making a sign to him to hasten forward. Then mounting his horse he rode on to the aperture; which he had no sooner entered, following Raven∣zar, than it was rendered impenetrable by a black, fiery cloud; which served as a barrier against any intrusion from without. But it is impossible justly to describe the beauty and loveliness of the prospect before him! The apartments, seven in number, stood, at some distance from each other, in a spa∣cious garden, laid out and furnished with inconceiv∣able magnificence and gaity. They were of solid gold; their roofs and windows of purest chrystal glass; and partially shaded by tall and broad-leaved trees, whose wide spreading branches waved gently over them; and had a most enchanting effect on the whole scenery to the eyes of those either within or without the apartments. The gardens of Nytan, and several others on the island, with a number of buildings, are very far from being equalled in any part of the world. But here was a richness, a lux∣uriancy and splendor, exceeding those. The groves, the fruit trees, and beds of flowers and fruits, were disposed with inimitable art. The spacious alleys were of gold and marble. The walls of this gar∣den appeared to be of looking-glass and of a vast height; reflecting the gay and beautiful scenes they enclosed. At the distance of about twelve rods from the apartments, and on the right hand, as they advanced towards them, the ground was raised a number of feet, with a gradual ascent by several flights of steps of solid gold; beyond which at some distance, appeared, numbers of hills, clothed with verdure, rising one above another and bounding the delicious prospect. Ravenzar and Parcellus, dis∣mounting their horses, and turning them loose on the lawn, over which they had rode, walked to∣wards
<PB N="183" REF="038495_0182_10123F982BD9AD70"/>
the first apartment in their way. A beauti∣ful youth to appearance, clothed in a white flowing robe, stood at the door. It was Esdren: who per∣ceiving Ravenzar and Parcellus, advanced to meet them: 'We have been expecting you, my broth∣er, said he, to Ravenzar, but were not aware of your being attended by so lovely a companion, to en∣crease our pleasure.' 'This is Parcellus, replied Ravenzar, of whom you have often heard me speak, your friend and mine.' 'Let me then embrace our friend, said Esdren, folding Parcellus to his bosom. You have other friends within, added he, lovely youth, who will rejoice to see you; and embrace you with a sincere affection.' They then walked into the apartment, where Parcellus was over∣whelmed with pleasure, and the caresses of the il∣lustrious friends of Ravenzar; who were assem∣bled, in this paradise, agreeably to their yearly cus∣tom. There were the fairy Perieng, Puria the consort of Esdren, the fairy Leingreing, and five others from the palace of pictures, attended by their husbands, who had been lately restored to them; all arrayed in robes; immortal youth and beauty blooming in their countenances! None other, than the regions of the blest above, could boast an assem∣bly more illustrious and brilliant; of manners and intercourse more refined; or whose mutual en∣dearments were more extatic! After they had din∣ed, they walked in parties; Parcellus with Raven∣zar, and Esdren, who undertook to shew him the other six apartments, which lay in their way, at convenient distances, and in the most delightful sit∣uations towards each other; having clusters of tall elms, and other beautiful trees, placed between them, so as to afford an agreeable shade to those passing from one to another. The fourth apartment was the largest; having five galleries, and large closets,
<PB N="184" REF="038495_0183_10123F9A9C577670"/>
one within another, filled with shelves of books of the most superior kind. Having visited them all, they proceeded forward through the garden, and ascended the hills, from whence they had a com∣pleat survey of the whole garden, and its innumer∣able beauties. They seated themselves in an alcove under the shade of mulberry trees, and entertained themselves a long time with the lovely enchanting prospects. Esdren displayed the brightest talents in conversation, greatly to the instruction of Par∣cellus, to whom his discourse was chiefly directed, speaking of the delightful wonders of the place—'There was a time, said he, in my remembrance, (though many ages have since revolved) when this island, and most of the neighboring continents, were buried in the ocean. By slow degrees, in some places, and in others by sudden convulsions, the land emerged from the waters. At that distant pe∣riod, other countries became lost in the ocean, as these revived from it.' He enlarged upon the va∣rious changes he had observed on the face of the globe, and on the revolutions amongst mankind: then descanted on the beauties of creation. He likewise made a variety of sublime observations on the dispensations of Heaven towards the whole in∣telligent creation. Ravenzar had his share in the con∣versation; whilst Parcellus was all attention to the great and wonderful things he heard. His memo∣ry ever retained the whole, and he then imagined he understood every thing uttered by those sages; whose long experience had perfected them in the knowledge of the force and meaning, both of words and things. But an hundred years after convinced Parcellus, that he had but superficially and partially under∣stood the greater part of the conversation of that memorable day, evening and ensuing morning. Being at length disposed to walk further—'Come,
<PB N="185" REF="038495_0184_10123F9DA27DAE70"/>
said Ravenzar, I will shew you the baths on the other side the hills.' They arose, and, walking through a grove of fir trees, over the summits of the hills, descended to the baths, which were situat∣ed under the wall of looking glass which there ter∣minated the garden. Three golden buildings cov∣ered the chrystal fountains; on the hither sides of which were rich soffas covered with silk and gold, and tables of solid gold, separated from the fountains by partitions of glass, with curtains of green velvet: the roof of each building was of glass, and arched, like those of the seven apartments, with the branches of tall and majestic elms and oaks bending over them. They were surrounded by a spacious lawn, on which were clusters of palm trees, orange, fig, and other fruit trees. On one side was a grove of pines, of a young growth, which ascended part of the hills. On the other side was a wide alley, bordered with flowers, and various kinds of berries of a most de∣licious taste. This alley wound round the hills and communicated with others of the garden. 'Here; said Ravenzar, after refreshing ourselves in one of the fountains, we will recline on soffas, and wait the arrival of our friends, who have already bathed and pursued another walk. The ladies will return in carriages for the purposes of bringing us provisions and instruments of music: for here we shall spend the afternoon and evening.'—After they had bathed; Ravenzar opened a closet door; and shewed a small library of entertaining volumes. They took each a book, and, reclining on soffas, amused themselves an hour with reading. After which, they arose, and ascended the hills, looking round for their friends, who, by this time, said Esdren, must be on the way hither. But not perceiving them, they seated themselves in the alcove, and listened awhile to the charming music of the variety of birds. 'How
<PB N="186" REF="038495_0185_10123F9F44E933C0"/>
incessant, said Esdren, are the sylvan choristers of nature's temple, in the praises of the creator! how lively and animating their notes; as if they emulat∣ed the celestial musicians, who sweep their golden lyres in the heavenly temple above!—but see, our friends are approaching who will begin their melo∣dious concert when the feathered songsters shall have ceased; not to resume their sprightly lays till the morning's dawn. Let us join our company on foot while the ladies proceed forward in their carriages, and make ready our evening's repast.' Being unit∣ed, they took a different alley from that which the carriages pursued, which led them round the hills, on the right hand, through several delightful groves, and prolonged their walk till the ladies were pre∣pared to set at table. Having arrived, they all sat down to coffee, wine and cakes. All the variety of birds seemed to have assembled on the trees, in that delicious recess below the hills, to regale them with their sweetest melody! They advanced as near as possible to the apartment, perching on the branches that hovered over and around it; exerting them∣selves, as inspired with fresh vigor to raise their highest and most melodious notes, the nearer the hour of their rest approached. The ravished Parcellus could not refrain from expressing it as his opinion, that the birds had attained a skill and vivacity be∣yond their ordinary reach. It is really so replied the fairy Perieng. Our presence and the divine complacency, inspire and exalt them; the divine complacency, which delights in rewarding our faith∣ful and indefatigable labours for the good of man∣kind, with such pleasurable retirements, as this, for our relaxation, by means of which we renew our strength and vigor to pursue the works of ben∣evolence and love.'</P>
<P>After their repast was finished, some of the com∣pany
<PB N="187" REF="038495_0186_10123FA1D7C9DFD0"/>
joined in a concert of vocal and instrumental music; which with agreeable intervals of conversa∣tion, lasted till day began to appear, and the milder splendors of the moon to give way to brighter glo∣ries. They returned to their partments; where the company taking leave of Ravenzar and Parcel∣lus, ascended their splendid cars, and disappeared. Parcellus lamenting their departure, expressed him∣self in the following extemporary distich, with flow∣ing tears.—</P>
<Q><L>No glorious things can ever long remain:</L>
<L>The meteors shine and disappear again.</L>
<L>So dearest, kindest friends alas! must part;</L>
<L>Leave me to fruitless tears, and aching heart!</L></Q>
<P>'Your lines, observed Ravenzar, are true with regard to the present state of the world. But it is a state that will soon be over. Then all will be like us.—Come, my Parcellus, let us return to our lovely friends at Debournon's. Do you not long to see them? 'Indeed I do, my kind patron, re∣plied he. Their company will reconcile me to the absence of those who have just left us.' 'We shall return in a four-wheeled carriage, resumed Ravenzar. I have sundry articles to convey to your mansion, to which I shall carry you; it being sit∣uated but half a mile on one side of our road. A carriage will likewise follow us with two large chests filled, the one with gold the other with dia∣monds, for your use.' He then touched with his fore-finger a little golden ball, that hung by a wire to one of the pillars of the soffa on which they were sitting; immediately the sound of a large bell was heard, as at distance: and presently a door opened, and two servants appeared. Ravenzar ordered two four wheeled carriages to be made ready, the two
<PB N="188" REF="038495_0187_10123FA38863B098"/>
chests to be placed in one of them, and a trunk, that he described in another. 'And, added he, let eight servants be ready to attend me.' The servants in∣stantly disappeared to fulfil his orders. 'While they are obeying my orders, said Ravenzar, I will shew you where my servants live. When, at any time, in future you are here, and want attendants, you have only to touch this golden ball, and a servant will appear, and call others if you shall have occa∣sion for them.' Saying this they descended a stair case, through the door by which the servant entered. At the bottom of the stair-case was a long gallery. They walked through it to an opening, which brought them into a spacious lawn, where stood four handsome buildings of grey marble. They entered the first in their way; in which were two young men and women sitting at breakfast. 'We are come, said Ravenzar, to breakfast with you this morning.' 'You greatly honor your servants, re∣plied one of the young men, who are always rejoic∣ed to see our good master and his friends.' This he said rising and placing two chairs at the table in which Ravenzar and Parcellus seated themselves; the young women presenting them with tea, cakes and honey. Ravenzar and Parcellus conversed with them with the greatest cheerfulness and familiarity. When they had all breakfasted Ravenzar conducted his friend attended by the two young men, into the fields, cultivated by his servants, which were ex∣tensive, and in the most flourishing condition. 'There is not now time, said the Genie, to view the mines of gold, and the pits where the diamonds are gathered, and the various employments follow∣ed here. But my people will shew you every thing at some other time.' A number of men and wo∣men of very agreeable appearances, came from the other houses to pay their respects to their beloved
<PB N="189" REF="038495_0188_10123FA7567EAAC0"/>
employer, who received them with an affectionate regard; and blessing them, he, with Parcellus, at∣tended by the two young men, hastened back to the stair case, where the young men took their leave, and returned to their house. 'Some of my people, said Ravenzar, at proper seasons, work in my gar∣den, keeping it always in good order. But none of them are seen, at any other time, above these stairs, except when called. Their cheerful labours supply me with whatever I want, while here; and they are amply rewarded; living always in plenty, and happy in each other. Their fields and habita∣tions, are enclosed, on one side, by the wall of my garden; and, on the other, by the mountainous rocks which bend their craggy summits over the o∣cean. Here is the broadest extension of these rocks, which run further, by a mile, into the island, than in any other part of it.'</P>
<P>The two carriages and the servants being ready, they entered them and sat forward for the aperture; four of the servants attending on horseback When arrived to the Aperture, the Genie pronounced sev∣eral words, and the clouds retreated on one side to make way for the carriages and horsemen. As soon as all were passed through, the cloud resumed its station. As they pursued their way, Ravenzar pre∣sented Parcellus with a medal.—'On this medal, said he, are engraved the words which I used for the removing the cloud. You will therefore be sure to have it with you, my friend, whenever you shall design entering my apartments. But, see, before us, your buildings. They stand in a gar∣den of two hundred acres. We will, now, but just look at them, deposit the chest and trunk, and give orders to the eight servants, henceforwards yours, and then hasten on to our dear friends.</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="038495_0189_10123FA8F6A019B0"/>
Having viewed the buildings and gardens, and de∣posited the trunk and chessts, they expedited their course to Debournon's.</P>
<P>On the evening following the marriages were solemnized in the presence of great numbers of con∣gratulating friends. They were the next evening, to meet in Nytan's palace.</P>
<P>It was a most agreeable entertainment to those illustrious friends on the intervening day, to read a paper published by Philenor, and dispersed in his native country, and the neighbouring kingdoms, and to learn the recent events consequent upon it, which, at once shew in a striking light the depravi∣ty of human nature; and how ineffectual, and to themselves fatal, is the rage and vengeance of the sons of pride against the children of virtue under the immediate protection and guardianship of hea∣ven. The paper was entitled The Remembran∣cer, of which the following is a part.—</P>
<P>'By that wisdom which never errs is it decreed, that every atom of the creation, and every intellec∣tual as well as sensitive existence, performs their destined rounds. To consummate the plan of e∣ternal love a day—a glorious decisive day is fixed;—a day, to which every revolution and every dis∣pensation invariably tend;—when the stupendous plan of Deity shall open to the view of admiring and applauding worlds! All events, through all a∣ges, have respect only to this illustrious, this fast ap∣proaching day. In the present Crisis which ar∣rests universal attention among the nations, happy are those who with incessant benevolent exertions, coincide with the designs of heaven, wholly <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of every sordid view and immoveably attentive to the universal good!</P>
<P>How little doth it appear to be realized, that ev∣ery thing misused or mis-spent must be accounted
<PB N="191" REF="038495_0190_10123FAB52E6A750"/>
for;—that the consequences of the abuses of nature are terrible. We have learned from every age (as far as history instructs) the awful effects of living without that attachment to the Supreme, which a∣lone insures human felicity. Why are we no bet∣ter improved by experience of past times and our own? Is it that the most dreadful destruction is to reprove the absurdity and perverseness of our tem∣pers, the madness of our conduct?</P>
<P>The Deity is infinitely good and kind, as infin∣itely perfect and glorious. To resemble him is man's happiness, his honor, his greatness. Alas! we are poor realisers of the inestimable blessings of exis∣tence, and celestial liberality. We are shamefully unmindful of him who taught our souls to think! No wonder therefore we are miserable; no won∣der we are so disappointed, embarrassed, blasted in our projects and pursuits. In vain do we look for tranquility and bliss, whilst we respect not, love not the author of our being. What then is our re∣ligion, of which we make such a parade? What the worship we offer to Heaven? How much more like true worshippers would your religious assem∣blies appear, did they meet, both rich and poor, on the appointed days, like affectionate brethren; in the genuine spirit of love, relieving every want, en∣couraging each other in true virtue and real good∣ness with the sweetly persuasive eloquence of the heart? then would they unquestionably chant forth the songs of acceptable praise, and the air would resound with truly sacred melody. Then would they utter a thousand charming things, such as an∣gels might with delight and admiration listen to hear. New scenes of pleasure would open, as yet to them unknown. Then would they discern, that in each other, which the Deity beholds as infin∣itely attractive—beauty and charms that never
<PB N="192" REF="038495_0191_10123FADD5AB4978"/>
cloy or fade. Such is the only worship by Heaven approved. Away then—forever away with that detestable kind by which divinity and humanity are insulted.—* * *</P>
<P>* * *—O ye rulers!—Ye rich and influ∣ential! Is it not high time ye learned wherein true grandeur consists? How far are ye from entertain∣ing just ideas of living—of pleasure—policy—oecon∣omy—of virtue—of humanity—of true glory! oth∣erwise, would ye rest day or night, till by the spirit of the Eternal, ye became well instructed to bless mankind? Hasten then, ye great, ye leading men of the nations!—Seek him with affiance by whom alone ye live! cry mightily, and take no de∣nial!—be blest and bless mankind! realise how highly ye are accountable—'</P>
<P>But this is but a slender part of that interesting and alarming paper. The enraged powers sent out vast fleets to destroy Ravenzar. They could never find it. A dreadful storm dispersed them. They all miserably perished. Such is the inevitable doom of the implacable enemies of God and man! The grand the benevolent purposes of the sovereign of worlds can never be frustrated.</P>

<P>EARLY in the evening the company were as∣sembled in Prince Nytan's hall. It is easi∣er to imagine than describe the refined social plea∣sures of those illustrious friends, who with heaven's propitious smiles, had attained to the accomplishment of their utmost wishes. Selina made a number of rich presents to the newly married ladies, most el∣egantly adapted to the friendship and the liberality of her heart. Several weeks they passed together in a round of convivial pleasures in the palace and in the city. But the Prince was now suddenly cal∣led away to the continent of Africa In the height of sweetest social bliss, the dearest friends must part, and cheerfully submissive, yield to Heaven's great behests. A courier, swift as the wind, had brought intelligence of an alarming nature.—'I am instant∣ly to leave you my happy friends!—It is your glo∣ry and mine that summons me hence; since we
<PB N="194" REF="038495_0193_101224D498152D28"/>
are alike deeply interested in the felicity of man∣kind, and, under the direction of the sovereign parent, incessantly employed in promoting its weal, in preventing or mitigating its woe. Dire mis∣chief lours tremendous where we have been long labouring to insure mild virtue's tranquil reign! In silence, with pity's softest eye, you urge me to be gone; nor reluctant do I obey.'—It was thus Ny∣tan bid his guests adieu. He rested on the Afri∣can shore in Zanger's favored realm, and on the spot where his royal friend had erected, in honor to his memory, a magnificent dome, and where, at the instant of his arrival, he resided. Enraptured he embraced his most beloved of friends.</P>
<P>After mutual caresses, Zanger hastily informed his friend of what he already knew too well; that Mingeng, (the King whose history a preceeding page has introduced) was deposed and banished his kingdom, now distracted and torn by party rage, and in danger of soon becoming a prey to surround∣ing barbarous nations.</P>
<P>'Hinder me not a moment cried Nytan, I must instantly be gone. On my return I am to take you, my dear Zanger, to our happy isle, where my friends long to embrace you.'—He was soon in the midst of the divided people. Seasonable was his presence, and happy in its consequences was his benevolent interposition. The leading men of each party he highly blamed, accusing them roundly of shameful∣ly disingenuous conduct towards each other, as un∣happily hath in civil dissentions, been too often the case). All were highly incensed against him, and began to threaten his life. But they were ignorant of his worth, his abilities and powerful resources—in peace or war—in the cabinet or in the field; and how easily he could frustrate their nefarious pur∣pose. At the most interesting crisis he appeared in
<PB N="195" REF="038495_0194_10123FB53AFC76C0"/>
their assembly, and having solicited attention, de∣livered the following memorable oration, with that pathetic all-commanding eloquence so peculiar to himself.</P>
<P>'Respected citizens, the freedom of my interpo∣sition, I perceive, hath excited against me your re∣sentment. Yet suffer me once more to address you, before I bid you adieu. Alas! what are men, when hurried and agitated by impetuous passions. You are dear to me as my own existence; since we all are the indulged children of one common parent, that glorious being from whom originates every thing great, every thing good, every thing amiable and lovely. We must resemble our kind beneficents Creator, to be happy, to be honorable. Our devi∣ation from rectitude is certain incalculable misery and disgrace. But let us no longer deceive our∣selves, nor forget we are accountable for our ac∣tions. Alas! it is high time the nations were ful∣ly awakened to sentiments more becoming the dig∣nity of their nature as the offspring of Heaven! How inconsistent hath our tempers and conduct been towards each other?—Inconsistent with what we would be, and with what we are so ready to flatter ourselves we are! men of virtue and honor, great and good! We differ in our political views; and we are ever irritating each other by insulting language. From the public advertisers how shame∣fully is it evidenced.

times.—Are we never to be really wise and good; to rise superior to the degrading solicita∣tions of false ambition, or sensuality? And are we created only to wrangle and fight, afflict and devour each other? Wherefore do we pretend to possess the noble-exalted rational powers, while we thus act like irrationals?—If we possess a courage and fortitude to risk our health, our limbs and lives in hostile conflicts; to endure every thing in arduous, hazardous enterprizes;—Why have we not the cou∣rage to arrest the fatal deranging progress of cow∣ardly selfishness? The man uninfluenced by a sin∣cere, undissembled philanthropy, (which indeed ex∣ists not but with every virtue) however he may plume himself, and figure in the world, is but a cowardly pusillanimous wretch: and, sooner or la∣ter, in the presence of superior beings, he must be covered with shame. Nothing can be more true, or more worthy of solemn thought.—What <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have such multitudes of us been about? Im∣mortal beings! gloriously formed, when first pro∣duced from Deity's plastic hand! What, my breth∣ren, have we been pursuing! Alas! it is true that we have been pursuing only our shame!—Can there be any thing more contemptible in the eyes of the glorious and beneficent beings who encompass the eternal throne, than those selfish minds that prefer their own gratifications to the good of thousands, whom they might greatly serve by their affectionate attentions, and reform by their precepts and engag∣ing examples? But we, by our temper and con∣duct, and sordid private views, are blasting every benevolent purpose of the generous heart. What a disgraceful circumstance is it—how base and pregnant with the most terrific ruin—that the di∣vine gifts of speech and language are prostituted to the cruel murderous purposes of slander and de∣famation!

—Unhappy beings!—that would oppress and destroy those we ought to embrace and cherish! and this, is it for power, or wealth, that we would triumph in the misery of our brethren—in our shame?</P>
<P>But how, say you, shall we induce each other to think alike, (who entertain such opposite senti∣ments) and annihilate party spirit?</P>
<P>Let us ponder well the dire result of our present conduct. Let us with solemnity apply to the source of wisdom. To its guidance we must yield, or be inevitably undone: to exist without it is dreadful; there are deepest horrors in the idea!</P>
<P>O my friends! let us ponder well at this mo∣mentous crisis! let us be awakened to salutary healing truth before it be too late; nor plunge madly into distressing desolations beyond concep∣tions the most terrible! let us henceforth, then, unite in cherishing the sacred gentle spirit of love. Let us determine to act disinterestedly;—to conduct as in the presence of innumerable glorious pure and happy intelligences, who ever lean on om∣nipotence; and as in his presence. Whose all per∣vading eye searches into the most secret recesses of every heart. Let us for ever banish, (from this moment) pride and vain glory, and little-sordid self with all the cowardly fears that always attend it. Let us have done with every species of vice and intemperance. True temperance will be attended with every virtue—every attractive grace. Few indeed can be fairly allowed to possess so inestima∣ble a gift of Heaven. Ignorant of its excellencies, men have not desired it;—they have not therefore asked it. For the sincere request would never have been denied by the source of tenderness and love. A just temperance would render us tranquil, serene and happy. It would meliorate our hearts. With∣out

it our grandeur and fame are contemptible, be∣cause unworthy the acquisition of rationals—im∣mortals—who seek the glory founded only on gen∣uine heaven-born virtue. It would regenerate us, and render us divine. Yet every sense would be regaled with the variety of delicacies which liberal nature yields. But without a genuine temperance we can enjoy nothing. Possessing it, we shall en∣joy all things. Freed from the solicitations of false appetites, and racking desires, and of consequence, from expences that oppression only can support; we shall really possess more to enjoy, as we shall have more to give;—like the giver of all, existing to relieve the helpless, and communicate happiness. We should then taste the bliss, we should prove the enrapturing felicities of wisdom and philanthropy, divine, and no longer labour and rage to oppress and destroy each other. Innumerable pleasures, in endless blissful series, would then be ours.—Citi∣zens with a true magnanimity, let us surmount ev∣ery opposing passion, and become the nation so rich∣ly blessed! But the reputed temperance is below the grade to which I would have you soar. The truly temperate enjoy perpetual health, have the due com∣mand of the passions; and practice, with sublimest pleasure every virtue. E'er long some of you shall behold the divine and salutary effects of genuine temperance in the country where I dwell:—O' cit∣izens! I know not how to part with you till I have effectually convinced you wherein true glory and permanent happiness consist! Alas! we have widely erred! We have been unhappily mistaken!—but I perceive many of you are affected. Give me leave to point out our future course. Let us feel, the great supreme; without whose propitious smiles your country falls, and you plunge in the dreadful abyss of anarchy and ruin! Before the aw∣ful

But we shall now renounce them, and become hap∣py in the embraces of celestial virtue!</P>
<P>O citizens! what do we not owe to our benefi∣cent creator, who hath formed so glorious a world for our residence; who hath laid himself out for our felicity? what do we not owe to the bright in∣telligences of the heavenly worlds—to ourselves—to all mankind—to the whole creation! let us dwell on the momentous thought! let us aspire to attain all that will in future be valuable, and which we shall rejoice that we have pursued after millions of ages have revolved! We cannot endure the idea of being despised in the future world; let us conduct conscientiously and honorably in this; ever remem∣bering the Omniscient and Omnipresent discerns every secret motive of the human heart; and that he can delight only in that real goodness which cheerfully denies itself▪ for the peace and happiness of all.'</P>
<P>The eloquent and persuasive orator ceased. The audience was deeply affected. A new light sprang up in each mind. Numbers convinced, (and now angry only with themselves) immediately retired from public business. They retired to reflect, and reform. The sacred influence spread. The flame of celestial love was enkindled. And thousands of brightest genius' soon became gloriously active noblest deeds of fame which Heaven itself records. They were kindest deeds of benevolence and self-denial, wisely adapted to render every individual vir∣tuous

and happy. What wonders the moving elo∣quence of the heart and tongue accomplish when employed on a subject like this! The banished and deposed king was immediately recalled and reinstat∣ed. Nytan swayed every mind. It was influ∣ence he merited there to hold. And, though himself united to a Republic (great indeed) in strongest bands of love, he attempted not innovations. The monarchy was rendered there propitious and hap∣py, because the people became the children and sub∣jects of undissembled virtue. To leave his new converts in the pursuit of virtue, wisdom and know∣ledge, was his aim: and, happy consequent events in that kingdom a future page may unfold. At present, the narrator hath arrived to the utmost lim∣its of his intelligence. The successful philanthro∣pist, after three days, took leave of Mingen and his grateful applauding subjects, and repaired to the centre of a vast wilderness of Africa, in which, en∣vironed by impassible rocks and impervious woods, the splendors of Ravenzars palace glittered to the sun. Prince Nytan now for the first time beheld it, being previously informed of its situation by that illustrious friend. There, secluded from the world, a large society, consisting of both sexes, were train∣ing up, by Ravenzar, for the republic. Ravenzar was present to receive the friend of his heart. Sev∣eral days they conversed together on subjects of highest import. After which, and having been most agreeably entertained by the society, they took leave of each other, and Nytan hastened to king Zanger, who feasted him two days with truly royal magnificence, all the principal men and women of the court being present. Yet was it a feast where true temperance presided, however unusual at the tables of the great; and from which every one re∣turned happy, rational and divine.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="038495_0200_10123FC0C023C058"/>
On the morning the king took leave of the court, and with Nytan, followed by the blessings of the people, bid a long farewell to the continent of Af∣rica.</P>
<P>'How blest exclaimed Zanger (as they gently prog∣ressed through the air) are those who render the pow∣ers of art and science conducive to human felicity. What advantages have we in Africa thereby ob∣tained. And what an accession of happiness is thence derived to two powerful nations!' 'It is indeed glorious for us, replied his friend, that the divine gifts have enriched us with the power and the dis∣positions to serve each other. Ever new and en∣rapturing are the sensations of the benevolent mind. Divine love inspires its possessors with all that is great and good: it views every object in its its true light; and constantly realises the delightful truth that the creator beholds, in the children of humanity, forms infinitely lovely and engaging; and, by his wonder-working power, moulds and refines them to perfect purity and innocence; a∣dorning them in his own comeliness, and rendering them for ever lovely to each other. Such a view animates us to every possible exertion in serving each other: and we contemplate, with horror and disdain, those sensual indulgencies which effemin∣ate the mind, and cause it cowardly to shrink from philanthropy's glorious, unparalleled career. Dif∣ficulties serve but to invigorate our resolution, and strengthen our confidence in the Supreme. What rich blessings grow upon mankind from the multi∣plied deeds of benevolence! their increasing hap∣py effects both on the receiver and the bestower, may be compared to those prolific germs, which from the slenderest size advance in growth till they become the most beautiful and the most fruit∣ful
<PB N="202" REF="038495_0201_10123FC3F116E500"/>
of trees. But here the comparison fails. Those trees, however ornamental and useful, must decay and die: but the works of benevolence undecaying flourish; and are the permanent sources of plea∣sures the most refined. The delightful sensations, arising from the works of charity, are indeed di∣vine. From the source of love and kindness they originate; and, like every thing divine, they for∣ever exist, and forever beatify the beings in whose breasts they are naturalised! How glorious is it, my friend, to be employed in the important work, however arduous, of correcting the errors of man∣kind, of awakening their attention to virtue, of promoting universal peace and harmony! though it be indeed the most difficult of all works. How long are men gaining just ideas of virtue and hap∣piness! ideas sufficiently powerful to rouze all the energies of their minds to action! What difficult∣ties arise from passions and the ignorance and de∣pravity of men! but the more difficult the work, the more glorious will it appear in its final accom∣plishment by the great, the wonder-working pow∣er of God, with whom we co-operate. Its difficul∣ty, yea, impossibility, with us alone, and the num∣berless impeding causes of genuine reform, lead us to reflect how consummate must be the bliss when it is universally effected.</P>
<P>'Our growing numbers are indeed a sacred pow∣erful confederacy of illustrious personages under a divine influence, against every species of vice and oppression; aconfederacy not only for our own feli∣city, but for the promotion of real virtue and good∣ness, and for the relief of the wretched, the desti∣tute and the oppressed, in every region. And, as it intrudes not on other nations, or societies, it is itself secured against every foreign intrusion. Guid∣ed by the most perfect wisdom, and actuated by the

Every individual of our nation is well known to the administrators of the government, is industri∣ous, virtuous and happy. It contains the greatest geniuses of both sexes.—Such are Xarien Lateur, Zanthus, Debournon, and many others, by whom I have the happiness to be always encircled, besides great numbers who live in the distant towns, villa∣ges and cities.—Such are Zurien, Aranthus, Pherr∣deng, and the most accomplished women. A long list I might produce of female worthies, whose ex∣cellent precepts and examples are eagerly followed by every one of that amiable and respectable sex. The Philanthropic son of Renien was upon his fa∣favorite topics. Zanger was most pleasingly enter∣tained, whose mind was formed to virtue and ben∣evolence. He expatiated, in his turn on the de∣lightful themes.—Prince Nytan pursued several excellent thoughts of his friend with the most in∣structive and charming eloquence. He seemed to rise superior to humanity; and Angels might well listen to the sweet accents of his tongue, whilst he dwelt on the wonders of his happy isle, the virtues; the felicities of his citizen-friends. He eulogised those who indeed merited the highest praise. 'Such concluded he, are the inhabitants of this favored isle, and such are the exalted sentiments by which they are inspired and so fervent is the ardor of their philanthropy, that all the energies of their minds are exerted to the utmost, without cessation or dis∣couragement, in the service of their beloved and re∣spected brethren of mankind of every country and nation; wherever dispersed or however deranged; and with the most cheerful and unreserved filial con∣fidence

do they apply to Heaven for every requisite instruction and aid: nor do they ever apply in vain. By Heaven's direction and aid I gave them existence as a nation; then leaving them to them∣selves, and to adopt the form of government that best pleased them, they chose such an one as they conceived most suitable to their circumstances. The Lord of Nature is indeed their sovereign, and they are subjects of his peculiar care. Though I am heir to the empire of China; and though my fa∣ther would place me in the throne, I have prefer∣ed being a citizen amongst this illustrious people whose felicity is so perfect. And here I become most useful to the world.—But see yonder, the well defended shores, on which none but the truly vir∣tuous land! You are now, my Zanger to judge for yourself. We shall soon embrace our friends.</P>
<P>The splended luminary had just began its diurnal course, when they descended in the Prince's gar∣den. Amelia, from her window, first observed their descent, and called out to Selina. The com∣pany were all in motion, and before they had reach▪ the palace gate, they were encircled by the loveliest groupe of congratulating friends. From every one Zanger received the most cordial welcome. Their morning repast was prepared in the saloon, to which they repaired. Nytan related the wonders he had performed. Each heart swelled with rapturous joy, as well it might.—A nation plucked from ruin in one propitious hour! Through every village town and city, the gladdening tidings ran! For the gen∣erous purpose, couriers were instantly dispatched; that every benevolent heart (and such were all Ra∣venzar's, might early share in the sympathetic bliss. At noon the illustrious friends repaired to the city where they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with their fellow citizens in the public hall. Zanger was enraptured on viewing

the splendid scenes of Xuntien, and contemplating the virtues and the elevated happiness of its citi∣zens. 'Sure, exclaimed he, this is the region of perfect felicity; and the paradise of Heaven lie transplanted upon earth! What beauty! what mag∣nificence! what elegance and charming simplicity of manners! what warm effusions of friendship and amity flow from every tongue! and what ex∣quisite taste and refinement are displayed in every building, every street avenue and ornament! what grand inchanting prospects present themselves, wherever I turn my eyes! Enlarge, extend thy coasts, O favored isle! For thy numerous increas∣ing denisens make ample room! yes, I foresee thy future enlargement!

<P>ZANGER, having by the aid of Pharenon, ac∣quired the European languages, had made the grand tour. In which he saw indeed, much to admire, but more to lament. Nothing excited in him more of surprise and resentment than those principles, and that conduct, which tended to erase the belief of the souls immortality, and of the Dei∣ty's kind attentions to the works of his own hands; those tenets which are established indeed, by Di∣vine authority, in the heart of every citizen of Ra∣venzar. 'One would think said he, it were impos∣sible that men of sense and learning could enter∣tain the idea, that beings capable of such ennobling energies; refined sentiments and endearing affec∣tions, as are evidently the human species, were de∣signed for the enjoyment only of a temporary exis∣tence, and then utterly to perish, to be forever ex∣punged from the creation. No wonder, continued Zanger, men of such sentiment are among the chief oppressors of mankind, the perpetual plagues of so∣ciety.' He became however, acquainted with a
<PB N="207" REF="038495_0206_10123FD00BD7B530"/>
few of those: who were worthy of his esteem and affectionate attention. Yet no society of men in the world appeared to him comparable to this, in which, through the friendship of Prince Nytan, he was now initiated. And he could not refrain from renewed expressions of the high admi∣ration and exquisite pleasure with which he was affected, as they walked on to the pavilions of Le∣ingreing, their common benefactress, 'O my friend, cried he, with what ravishing pleasureable sensations am I overwhelmed, in beholding the un∣rivalled charms of your country! wherever I walk, here, I meet only endearing countenances, encoun∣ter kindest greetings; and am received with the most hospitable, the most cordial entertainment in every dwelling I enter. Here all is perfect love and sweetness! and the women—never did I be∣hold more lovely! They are rather celestials, who have condescended to dwell on the earth to console, to harmonise, to beatify mankind! What won∣ders would a party of these angels effect, in the re∣gions which gave me birth! their divine allure∣ments would be irresistible—the tout-ensemble of their matchless personal and mental charms—their superior knowledge, their persuasive eloquence, their unparalleled modesty, engaging manners and virtuous examples!—It must be so, my dear Prince—our fleet must bear away a few of these invalua∣ble commodities; since you have already told me, it is in contemplation in your assembly to settle sev∣eral families abroad, at different future periods, for the most benevolent purposes.'</P>
<P>'And would it not, think you, replied Prince Nytan, be very hard parting with citizens, with friends so dear?' 'The love of true glory, replied the king, removes every difficulty. Neither, my friend, would it be so very hard parting, since all
<PB N="208" REF="038495_0207_10123FD28FC65C50"/>
would often meet again, notwithstanding the great distance of the countries from each other. Besides, we are to reckon the peculiar pleasures of episto∣lary correspondence.' 'You argue eloquently, re∣turned the philanthropic friend, and, I believe, when you make your benevolent and patriotic claim, it cannot fail of being approved and sanctioned with∣out a dissenting voice. Our females will indeed be excellent instructresses and guards to youthful age against the errors to which they are liable. They will seasonably relieve them from the often fatal effects of those ssudden and unlooked-for incidents and assaults on their minds, which have deranged youth, who have, with determined steps, sat out in the career of virtue, and have not been sufficiently watched against by either parents, instructors, or guardians, in the countries, where I have visited.</P>
<P>Zanger was about to introduce the former sub∣jects of discourse when Nytan placed in his hands an epistle wrote by Amelia, to a young female whom she had educated, and who resided with Randor in her former mansion. 'This epistle, said the Prince, is a valuable specimen of the ideas with which our women inspire their children. Amelia is an ex∣cellent tutoress. But we have many such in our country. Heaven is peculiarly interested in the education of our children, and hath blessed them with wise, faithful and indefatigable instructors and instructresses. Indeed there is not one amonst them but might well astonish, and put to the blush, the best in the most civilised nations. I except the few we have sent abroad through the advice and concur∣rence of Ravenzar, Leingreing, and our other guar∣dian angels; for such they truly are, both to us, and to all to whom they are commissioned from on high.'</P>
<P>As they sat resting, embowered in a delightful

<LETTER>
<HEAD>AMELIA to CHLORIS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Chloris,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Your first essay in epistolary writing is beyond expectation agreeable. You will give me leave, in answer, to continue the important subject with which you concluded.—</P>
<P>Nature, ever attentive to her children; instruct∣ing each individual of all the immense variety of be∣ings; inciting it to those actions and dispositions which essentially contribute to, and constitute its fe∣licity; to our sex she points the most rational con∣duct and motives; seasonably advises us of every deviation from the path of rectitude. The happy ease and serenity of the mind is proportionate to its attention to her salutary dictates. Revere, my Chloris her sacred friendly voice. Obey her im∣portant injunctions; in every instance yield to her pointed intimations. She invites our sex to aim at every excellent accomplishment, to become rich∣ly adorned with all the amiable graces and virtues. Nor does she leave us ignorant, that the genuine, ruling motive for acquiring every mental charm, must be indisputably, the lively consciousness of its being pleasing to the infinitely lovely and be∣nificent author of our existence; who, as he is the source of every perfection, (himself▪ the perfection of beauty and loveliness) infinitely and immutably great and glorious, good and kind; it becomes his grateful daughters whom he hath blessed with an∣gel forms, to love him supremely; to aspire, with the most fervent ardor, to please him who first and best deserves to be pleased. They should therefore, be ever studious to render themselves lovely and all accomplished ultimately for his sake. Possessed of
<PB N="210" REF="038495_0209_10123FD75AEAAFA0"/>
this exalted sentiment, they may be justly said to enjoy real felicity; since it divinely excites them to pursue, with unremitted zeal, the career of true virtue and honor; aspiring after that splendid fame which is celebrated in the regions of consummate glo∣ry and bliss; exerting every energetic power to digni∣fy each revolving day and year by those virtuous and benevolent actions which will be pronounced intrinsically valuable in future worlds, and prove to them richest sources of joy innumerable ages hence. Thus, my Chloris, to live is to live to God, to the happy country we are destined to adorn, and to the world; and justly to merit that distinguishing and inchanting appellation—The fair part of the crea∣tion; to be hourly improving in mental beauty and lustre; to shine with a still brighter and more ra∣diant effulgence, till the illustrious day of Heaven unfolds to our enraptured sight! This is to answer the grand purpose of our existence: this is to do justice to ourselves, to the world, to its Creator.</P>
<P>How unnatural then, how uncharacteristic must it appear, in a beautiful and accomplished female, (contemplating, in some retired moment, her own personal and mental attractions) to refrain addres∣sing, with a fervent and grateful adoration, the di∣vine author of her existence, the underived origin of beauty and lustre ineffable, which irradiates intelli∣gences around his throne; and who hath so happily formed her mind and person, endowing her with the capability of higher perfections, and of approv∣ing herself to him by every purpose of her heart, every action of her life. For this only, my amiable Chloris, let us <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and desire to live; to honor our beneficent creator, who hath so highly honored us, in bestowing upon us so respectable an existence, and so admirably forming the creatures of his pow∣er and love;—to love him supremely; to copy af∣ter
<PB N="211" REF="038495_0210_10123FD9B640D310"/>
him in his endearing expressions of love and tenderness.</P>
<P>The more we study the creator, the more shall we resemble him. For the greater our advances in that knowledge of him, which arises from the contemplation of the immensely varied displays of his perfections, the more forcibly will his discerned beauties and excellencies attract our admiration and love; and, the object we most admire and love, we shall be ever principally solicitous to imitate. What an immense, stupendous plan of beneficence hath the Deity formed! What a profuse display of won∣ders—of benevolence, doth the universe exhibit to each interested spectator of its vast and magnificent scenes! all is the inestimable product of infinite, of unchangeable goodness and love, and surely, the more diligently we study the divine benevolence in its multiform, grand and engaging displays, the more fervent will be our ardors, and the more generous our exertions in copying after those exquisitely wrought patterns exibited for our imitation, by that incomprehensibly glorious being, who enthroned with ineffable splendors on high, is perpetually dif∣fusing every form of happiness through unnumber∣ed worlds!—Let us my dear, with wonder—with awe—with gratitude—contemplate the rank we hold, and are destined to hold in the vast uni∣verse of God; and beware of entertaining too ex∣alted an opinion of ourselves. Beings greatly su∣perior to us, notice our behaviour, and are interest∣ed in our felicity, and Heaven's all-pervading eye penetrates the innermost recesses of our hearts; in which he requires, and even solicits the freest res∣idence, and from which he would debar the minut∣est and most concealed seat for pride and vanity. Neither are we to despise any of the inferior be∣ings, from the unwarrantable conceit that we are
<PB N="212" REF="038495_0211_10123FDB80590128"/>
more worthy, more beautiful or happier than they. All the infinitely various orders of existences, from the most elevated Arch-angel down to the meanest insect, possess their peculiar excellences and feli∣cities; even the reptiles, from which we have been apt to shrink with loathing, and innumerable wing∣ed and creeping animals scarcely visible to the sight, (besides countless animalculae too minute for our survey, possess some advantages of which we are in∣capable, and enjoy perhaps, greater degrees of sensual pleasure than our constructure allows us. The whole creation should be enzoned in our af∣fections, and inspire our grateful song.—But I am called from my pen. My dear, for the present, I must bid you adieu.</P>

<P>Zanger, having finished reading the letter, ex∣pressed himself as exceedingly gratified. They con∣versed on its contents, as they walked through Xun∣tien to a grand and spacious opening, presenting to their view two vast and magnificent pavilions. They were erected by their benefactress Leingreing, near the delicious spot where she sat, one evening<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See page 26. Book 3d.—The author hath no other apology for his attempt to imitate the Oriental tales of fiction, than the hopes of drawing the attention to inter∣esting realities, of those who would otherwise be hardly persuaded to peruse his pages.</NOTE> with the Prince and Gesseng, in sweetest converse, and where they united in chanting forth the praises of the creator and benefactors of worlds. Hard by stood a superb dome, on the spot were the Prince first landed on the island. Those places were dear to the illustrious friends. From each of the pavil∣ions was a delightful view of one of the most spa∣cious streets of the lofty tower lately erected, and that rather exceeded, both in dimensions and bril∣liancy,
<PB N="213" REF="038495_0212_10123FDD23F75A08"/>
its refulgent prototype which ornaments a principal city of the Chinese Empire. The pavil∣ions were ever open to all the citizens, and were most agreeable resting places; affording every kind of refreshment after walking in the adjoining groves and gardens, or along the banks of the river, or after excursions in pleasure-boats elegantly con∣structed, and always ready for every one's use. Here they spent the best part of several days with their invaluable friends;—sometimes on the river with various music, answered from the shores and groves; at others, walking beneath the cool delicious shades. Each pavilion was furnished with gay a∣partments, and large closets of books with desks and implements for writing, besides chambers for re∣tirement. These were at every ones service; and the books, which were inestimable, always in use.</P>
<P>After a sumptuous entertainment in the city hall, they travelled in parties, taking different routs through the extensive and populous country. Zan∣ger found the cities, towns and villages every where grand and beautiful; the whole country under the best improvements; the inhabitants surprisingly intelligent, industrious and flourishing, cheerful and truly hospitable. All was far surpassing any thing he had ever imagined; and which may be summed up in a word. He saw the glory and felicity of a wise and virtuous nation, cemented by pure undis∣sembled love. On his return to Africa, (which was at the close of a month from his arrival on the island) he was at loss for words to express the won∣ders he had witnessed, and the sweet affability and condescension of Ravenzar, Leingreng, Puria Es∣dren, Perieng; (all whom he had seen and con∣versed with at Debournon's mansion, where they be∣came guests for two days) those illustrious and su∣perior

beings, whose power aided Prince Nytan in peopling the island, erecting its magnificent edifi∣ces, and forming the minds of their inhabitants worthy of celestial converse. But, looking on the present exhibited scenes, and the future, through a perspective grand, decisive and truly interesting; we may well in delightful transport exclaim—</P>
<Q><L>Far other power than fabled builders boast,</L>
<L>Shall rear new cities, like Ravenzar's gay;</L>
<L>With citizens adorn'd of innate worth,</L>
<L>Like hers, and ever-blooming health enrich all climes</L>
<L>With beings worthy of the gift of life;</L>
<L>And make this globe a paradise of bliss!</L>
<L>Then fervent, all address the heavenly power;</L>
<L>Nor our devout oraisons ere give o'er,</L>
<L>Till love and virtue sway each kindred heart,</L>
<L>And the true zest of happiness impart.</L>
<L>Columbia's worthies then shall stand confess'd,</L>
<L>Enrob'd with virtue, in true glory dress'd:</L>
<L>Whose bright effulgencies the world illume,</L>
<L>All, to their nobler merit yield the plume.</L>
<L>Their virtues prov'd and tried thro' many a scene,</L>
<L>And arduous conflict, the more glorious shine.</L>
<L>Great nations emulate such matchless worth,</L>
<L>And bless the power that gave Columbians birth!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Such indeed throughout the world is their exalted fame. Highly favored of Heaven, may the laws of unerring rectitude be ever their guide, and wisdom their stabil∣ity. A fair inheritance is their possession, not to be polluted or spoiled by the vicious, or wrested from them by secret or open invaders! If it may be compared to a beautiful and magnificent garden, most elegibly and commodiously situated; it is verifyed and illuminated by the intellectual sun; whose cherishing rays let no noxious mists or malignant vapours obscure, nor cause the delicious fruits and fragrant flowers to fade. By the hand of diligence let it be carefully weeded and prun∣ed, that its salutary fruits and herbs may grow and flou∣rish, and its odoriferous and embellishing flowers ever look lively and gay; while the defensive walls that inclose it around, remain solid and impregnable to every inimical assault!</NOTE></L>

Rise Federal City—rise—in glory rise!</L>
<L>In wisdom's cement thy firm basis lies,</L>
<L>Nor storms, nor ages shall thy strength impair;</L>
<L>Nations unborn thy splendors shall admire;</L>
<L>To thee shall flock, whilst Bards, inspir'd, proclaim</L>
<L>Thy patriot virtues, and immortal fame!</L>
<L>Heroes deceas'd the ruins of the grave survive,</L>
<L>In every clime, in every heart they live.</L>
<L>The just can never die—the just—the good—</L>
<L>Not death o'erwhelms, nor time's destroying flood.</L>

<L>Blest sacred prvilege of virtues sons,</L>

<L>But deaths and griefs soon shall forever cease,</L>
<L>And earth and Heaven be one inchangeless bliss!</L>
<L>A ray divine shews glory yet to come;</L>
