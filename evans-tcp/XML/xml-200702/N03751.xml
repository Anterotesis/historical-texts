<HEAD>TO THE Christian Reader.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Women, that were lately exe∣cuted at <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> were condemn'd by a Law, which I think proper to recite, omitting the Preamble, that it may be better known in all Families that shall have the following Sermon.</P>
<Q><TEXT>

<DIV1 TYPE="act">
<HEAD>An Act to prevent the destroying and mur∣dering of Bastard Children.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Be it enacted by the Governour, Council and Re∣presentatives conven'd in General Assembly, and by the Authority of the same,</HI> That if any Woman be deliver'd of any Issue of her Body, Male or Female, which if it were born alive, should by Law be a Bastard, and that she endeavour pri∣vately, either by drowning or secret burying thereof, or any other Way, either by herself, or by the procuring of others so to conceal the Death thereof, that it may not come to Light, whether it were born alive or not, but be con∣ceal'd; in every such Case the Mother so of∣fending shall suffer Death, as in Case of Mur∣der; except such Mother can make Proof, by one Witness at the least, the Child, whose Death was by her so intended to be conceal'd, was born Dead.</P>
</DIV1>
</BODY>
</TEXT></Q>
<P>The Execution of the said Women drew toge∣ther a vast Concourse of People, and probably the greater, because these were the first Executi∣ons that ever were seen in this Province: For,
<PB N="ii" REF="004599_0004_100DA9EC16A9C200"/>
altho' this Province, in some Part of it, has been inhabited as long as any of the neighbouring Provinces yet never any Person, before these unhappy women, was legally convicted of any capital Crime among us.</P>
<P>Now, tho' <HI>Curiosity</HI> might move many Persons to come to behold those sad Objects, I would charitably hope that many came from a <HI>better Principle</HI>; with Minds dispos'd to reflect on the <HI>Vileness and Corruption of their own Nature,</HI> which would have betrayed them into the worst of Crimes, had it not been for the <HI>restraining Grace</HI> of God, to whose Name alone belongs the Praise, that any of us have been with-held from the grossest and most horrid Acts of Wickedness▪ And, while they ador'd the <HI>Justice of God</HI> in leav∣ing those Criminals to die before their Time, I hope they were <HI>dispos'd to take Warning</HI> by them, agreeable to the Advice of the wise Man, <HI>Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou foolish; for why shouldst thou die before thy Time</HI>? And, as the Pun∣ishment of Crimes committed, is design'd <HI>in Ter∣rorem,</HI> for the Prevention of the like; 'tis to be hoped, that all others, who <HI>hear</HI> of it, will <HI>fear and do no more any such Wickedness.</HI></P>
<P>And, whereas <HI>Secrecy</HI> is a strong Temptation to many Sins, the strange <HI>Discovery of the secret Crimes of these poor Women</HI> may well abate the Force of that Temptation. All <HI>our Iniquities are before God, and our secret Sins in the Light of his Countenance,</HI> who can when he pleases <HI>bring to Light the hidden Things of Darkness</HI>; as is remarkably evident in the present Case; for an Infant, that was found in a Well at the Entrance into the Town▪ occa∣sioned a <HI>Search</HI> for the Mother of it; whereby it was found that the said Women had lately been deliver'd of Children: Now each of them deny'd, that the Child in the Well was theirs; and <HI>one</HI>
<PB N="iii" REF="004599_0005_100DA9EE2533D978"/>
of them declar'd, where she had bury'd her Child, which was accordingly found; but the <HI>other</HI> af∣firm'd, that she cast her Child into the River; which has never been found: And she stedfastly affirm'd to the last, that she knew nothing of the Child in the Well: So that it looks very proba∣ble, that a Woman equally (and perhaps more heinously) guilty than either of these, was the Mother of it▪ and has yet escap'd Discovery: But, if she will not <HI>take Warning and give Glory to GOD</HI> by timely Repentance, she will sooner or later find herself in a doleful Case; and her Con∣dition may be worse than if she had been detected with the other Women: For these were <HI>awaken'd to consider their Ways</HI>; and, as they <HI>had a Space of Repentance</HI> allow'd them, they <HI>shew'd a Concern to make a due Improvement thereof</HI>; gratefully <HI>accept∣ing the good Advice</HI> that was given them from Time to Time, and seriously <HI>joining in the Prayers</HI> that were put up for them in Prison, and <HI>devoutly at∣tending on the publick Worship:</HI> And they so behav'd both in Prison and on the Day of their Executi∣on, that 'tis charitably hop'd they had <HI>made their Peace with</HI> GOD. <HI>One</HI> of them had been brought up in <HI>gross Ignorance</HI>; but she seem'd <HI>willing to be instructed</HI> in the Essentials of Christianity: <HI>Both</HI> of them greatly <HI>lamented their past Life,</HI> and <HI>ac∣knowledged the Justice of</HI> GOD in leaving them to be brought to such an untimely End, because they had been <HI>great Sinners:</HI> Tho' they <HI>deny'd that they laid violent Hands on their Children; one</HI> affirming that her Child was <HI>dead born;</HI> and the <HI>other,</HI> that hers dy'd <HI>soon after it was born</HI>: But both seem'd sensible of their <HI>Neglect of taking due Care</HI> to preserve the Life of their Children: So that they tho't themselves guilty of the <HI>Breach of the sixth Commandment by Omission,</HI> if not by Com∣mission.</P>
<P><PB REF="004599_0006_100DA9F05CBC75E8"/>The numerous <HI>Spectators</HI> seem'd earnestly con∣cern'd for them, that they might be <HI>true Penitents▪</HI> and O! that <HI>they may all be duly concern'd for them∣selves, that they do not live and die without sincere Repentance!</HI></P>
<P>And O! that <HI>the sad End of these Women may be a Warning to all others, to take Heed of the Sin of Uncleanness,</HI> which is a Sin peculiarly opposite to God's unspotted Purity, and shall not escape his righteous Judgment: <HI>Whoremongers and Adulterers God will judge:</HI> And this Sin has doubtless often betray'd Persons into the <HI>crimson Sin of Murder, for the Concealment</HI> thereof; as the <HI>Monk's Fish-ponds</HI> sadly testify'd in the Beginning of the Reforma∣tion; and there have been many sad Instances thereof besides in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</P>
<P><HI>Happy is the Man that feareth always; but he that hardeneth his Heart, falleth into Mischief.</HI> We have all need to beg of God, that he would <HI>keep us back from presumptuous Sins, that they may not have Dominion over us; for then shall we be upright and innocent from the great Transgression.</HI></P>
<P>The Sermon preach'd by the Reverend Mr. <HI>Shurtleff</HI> on the Execution Day, being well adap∣ted to the Occasion, was very acceptable to all the Auditors, and is publish'd at the Desire of sundry of them: And, that the Blessing of Hea∣ven may accompany it to all the Readers, is the sincere Desire</P>

<HEAD>THE <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Prayer</HI> Of a dying MALEFACTOR.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>LUKE xxiii.42.</BIBL>
<P>And he said unto JESUS, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy Kingdom.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HAT which has occasion'd this mighty Concourse, and bro't us in such a Multitude to the House of God, will without Doubt be acknowledg'd to be a very <HI>awful and affecting Providence.</HI></P>
<P>And, it being thought proper while we have this <HI>mournful Spectacle</HI> before us, and are beholding One that has receiv'd the Sentence of Death, is just now going to suffer according to it, that
<PB N="2" REF="004599_0008_100DA9F520A53D20"/>
something should be offer'd in this publick Way, as well for the <HI>Benefit of the whole Audience,</HI> as for the <HI>Assistance of the condemn'd Person</HI> Herself in these her last Hours; and it being my Lot to have the difficult Task devolv'd upon me, I have thought of the Passage read to you, as that which may suggest something that is proper and perti∣nent to the sad and sorrowful Occasion.</P>
<P>The Words, you are sensible, were spoken <HI>by a dying Malefactor to his dying Saviour.</HI> The pre∣fix'd Period of laying open the most bloody and dismal Scene that was ever beheld under the Sun, <HI>viz▪</HI> the Crucifixion of the blessed Jesus, being now arriv'd; among other Circumstances that attended it, we are told in the preceding Parts of the Chapter, (agreable to what was long be∣fore predicted, that he should <HI>be number'd with the Transgressors</HI>) that there were <HI>two Malefactors led forth with him to be put to Death</HI>; who were accord∣ingly <HI>crucified</HI> with him, the <HI>one on his right Hand, and the other on his left:</HI> And in the Text, and the immediately foregoing Verses, we have an Ac¦count in what Manner these Malefactors con∣ducted themselves.</P>
<P>One of them, says the Evangelist Ver. 39, <HI>railed on him, saying, If thou be the</HI> CHRIST, <HI>save thy self and us: But the other rebuked him,</HI> and disco∣vers himself to be a sincere and real Penitent. It is indeed said in the two preceding Evangelists, that <HI>the Thieves that were crucified with him, reviled him:</HI> And accordingly some suppose, that they both did so at first, 'till the Heart of one of them was wonderfully and suddenly chang'd. But it is the more general, and, I think, much more pro∣bable Opinion, that it was but <HI>one of them that
<PB N="3" REF="004599_0009_100DA9F6D06EB5F8"/>
reviled,</HI> as is here related by St. <HI>Luke:</HI> And, as to its being elsewhere affirm'd of <HI>both;</HI> it's observ'd to be usual with the Evangelists, and common in the Jewish Style, to ascribe that to <HI>many,</HI> that a∣grees only to <HI>one</HI> Nay, so far are some from al∣lowing that he, who approv'd himself penitent, at first <HI>rail'd with the other,</HI> that they conceive he <HI>began his Repentance</HI> before: But, whensoever it first began, whether in the Prison, or upon the Cross, considering the extraordinary Circum∣stances of the Case, it can give no just Encour∣agement to the Sinner to put off this Work to the last. But as I may have Occasion to say some∣thing further to the Point, before I finish my Discourse, I shall wave is for the present, and only say that from what Period soever we suppose the Repentance of this dying Malefactor to bear Date, it was doubtless <HI>genuine and true:</HI> And this what he here says to his Fellow-Sufferer, seems plainly to shew: <HI>He rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same Condemna∣tion? and we indeed justly; for we receive the due Reward of our Deeds: But this Man hath done no∣thing amiss.</HI> And then we are told that <HI>he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy Kingdom.</HI> These are the Words I am now to speak to. And could I upon the Warning I have had, have redeemed so much Time from my o∣ther necessary Employments, as to have prepar'd a just and full Discourse upon the Subject, I could not have had Time allow'd me for the Delivery of it. I must therefore content myself with a few Hints.</P>
<P>And all, that I shall attempt at present, shall be as follows,
<LIST>
<PB N="4" REF="004599_0010_100DA9FA08624168"/>
<ITEM>I. To <HI>consider some great and weighty Truths, of which this dying Person was, and which we all may be in the firm Belief and Perswasion.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. To <HI>consider the Prayer, which he put up; and which all ought to put up consequent upon such a belief, especially if in the like Circumstances</HI>:</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. To <HI>consider the Manner in which he puts up this Prayer, and in which it becomes every one to do it in the like Time and Case</HI>; if he would hope for the Success he met with:</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>And then to make some suitable <HI>Application</HI> of the whole.</P>
<P N="1">I. Then, I am here to <HI>consider some great and weighty Truths, in which this dying Person was, and which all may be in the firm Belief and Perswasion.</HI></P>
<P>And in the</P>
<P N="1">1st Place, He <HI>firmly believ'd, that, after his Death and Departure out of this World, he was to exist and live in another State.</HI> Otherwise, what would it have avail'd him, for his <HI>Lord to remember him when he came into his Kingdom?</HI> He had nothing to ask as to this World, being conscious, that he was now taking his last Leave of it: So that he plainly asks for some Favour beyond it. From whence it is evident, that he was verily perswa∣ded of a <HI>future World.</HI> And who, that is in the Exercise of his Reason, and that does not turn away his Ear from listning to its Dictates, can possibly doubt of <HI>his future Existence</HI>?</P>
<P>When we look within ourselves, and take a View of the <HI>noble Faculties</HI> we are furnish'd with,
<PB N="5" REF="004599_0011_100DA9FCD7E7D7B0"/>
how can we forbear concluding, that in this Body there dwells a Soul or Spirit that is imma∣terial, and in its own Nature immortal?</P>
<P>And then, if, from reflecting upon these Facul∣ties, we proceed to the Consideration of the Bre∣vity of human Life, shall we think it likely, that a Creature endued with such Powers, capable of such Improvements, and form'd with Expectati∣ons, after having continued here for a little Space, should lose his Existence, and not lay it down for a Certainty, that <HI>he was design'd for another State</HI>?</P>
<P>Nay, if it were only upon observing the pro∣miscuous Distribution of Events to good and bad Men in this Life, how should we be puzzled to reconcile it with the moral Perfections of God, without the Supposition of another life?</P>
<P>But then we are not left to find out this Truth by the bare Light of Reason; but it is manifest from divine Revelation: And, if we look into the Scriptures, especially of the New-Testament, we shall find not only the <HI>Immortality of the Soul,</HI> but the <HI>Resurrection of the Body</HI> asserted and ex∣emplified to us.</P>
<P>We may then be verily perswaded, that after our Death and Departure out of this World, we are to exist and live in another State. Indeed the Belief of this great Truth is such a Trouble and Disturbance to a great many in their sinful Pur∣suits, that they would fain get rid of it, and may possibly so far root it out of their Minds, as to have hardly any Sense and Apprehension of it in their prosperous Seasons: But, in a <HI>Time of Ad∣versity,</HI> especially in the <HI>Hour of Death,</HI> the Evi∣dences
<PB N="6" REF="004599_0012_100DA9FEC1A2D6A8"/>
of it ordinarily appear in their full Force: And they are fully convinc'd that they are not about to be turn'd out of Being, but only to re∣move from one World to another, and to pass from a State of Probation, to a State of Retribu∣tion.</P>
<P>And hence, by the Way, What a serious and awful Thing is it to die? I may appeal to the <HI>miserable Object</HI> I have now before me, whether she does not find it to be so? Yea, I may appeal to all of you, whether it would not appear to be so to you in the like Case? And whether it be not Matter of Surprize, even at an uncertain Dis∣tance, to think seriously of passing the dark Entry of Eternity, through which, as you go right or wrong, you are made, or undone for ever? To think of putting off this fleshly Tabernacle; of your Spirits appearing seperately before your great LORD, and of being fix'd in an everlasting State?</P>
<P>But I proceed to the Consideration of a <HI>second</HI> great and weighty Truth of which the dying Per∣son spoken of in the Text, was in the firm Belief, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That CHRIST, <HI>who was now leaving this World, was going to his Kingdom, and so would have Authority to dispose of him after Death.</HI> And accord∣ingly we may be verily perswaded, that he is actually gone into his Kingdom; that he is seat∣ed upon his Throne, and has the determining of our future State. <HI>Remember me,</HI> says his Thief upon the Cross to his dying LORD, <HI>when thou comest into thy Kingdom</HI>; which plainly declares his Belief, that he was going into his Kingdom:
<PB N="7" REF="004599_0013_100DAA00E0BE7628"/>
And accordingly we find him telling his Disci∣ples after his Resurrection, Mat. xxviii.18. That <HI>all Power was given him in Heaven and Earth.</HI> In∣deed as God, all Power was originally in him: In this Sense <HI>his Kingdom</HI> and Dominion was <HI>from everlasting to everlasting:</HI> But the Kingdom, spo∣ken of in the Text, is that, which as GOD-Man, or Mediator, he is possess'd of; which he receiv'd partly in Recompence for what he had done and suffered in the Work of our Redemption. Agre∣ably we read, Philip. ii.9. That, <HI>because he had humbled himself, therefore God hath highly exalted him, and given him a Name above every Name: That at the Name of Jesus,</HI> or as it may be read, <HI>in the Name of</HI> JESUS; that is, in the Acknowledge∣ment of his sovereign Power, <HI>every Knee should bow.</HI></P>
<P>We may all then be verily perswaded that he, whom the Text speaks of as <HI>going,</HI> is <HI>gone into his Kingdom:</HI> That he <HI>is set down at the right Hand of the Throne of GOD:</HI> That <HI>the Government is upon his Shoulders</HI>: That all Persons &amp; Things are put in Subjection to him; &amp; that he has a sovereign Pow∣er to dispose of us at his Pleasure. It is he, that has the ordering of us, and of all Events that concern us, in this World: It is he also, that determines the Time and Manner of our going out of this World: And then, when we come into another, it is he that has the Disposal of us: <HI>I,</HI> says he, <HI>am he that liveth, and was dead, and am alive for ever∣more, and have the Keys of Hell,</HI> that is, of Hades, or the unseen World, <HI>and of Death,</HI> Revel, i.18. It is he, that determines the State of our Souls, and disposes of them in a State of Happiness or Misery, when they first leave the Body: It is he also, that will have the Decision of our Case, that
<PB N="8" REF="004599_0014_100DAA03021E01E8"/>
will pronounce us either <HI>blessed</HI> or <HI>cursed</HI>; that will sentence us either to <HI>inherit a Kingdom,</HI> or <HI>to go away into everlasting Punishment</HI> at the Resur∣rection and final Judgment.</P>
<P>And hence, by the Way, How worthy is he to be reverenc'd and obey'd? Of what Concernment it to us to yield an entire Subjection to him? And how stupid must we be to content ourselves till we are in good Terms with him? He is in∣deed the most proper Object of our Love, and ought to be incomparably amiable in our Eyes: But then there is also the utmost Reverence due to him: Shall we not stand in Awe of him, who has such an absolute Dominion over us, and be afraid of trampling upon his Laws, who has the Keys of Death and Hell, who has a Right to dis∣pose of us both here and hereafter, and is at the Head of all Principalities and Powers? Shall we refuse that he should reign over us, who is gone into the Heavens, and is at the <HI>right Hand of God, Angels, Authorities and Powers being made subject to him,</HI> as 1 Pet. iii.21.</P>
<P><Q>We little know, says One, or can conceive as yet, the several Orders and Distinctions of the Celestial Inhabitants, and their great and illustrious Princes and Potentates, <HI>Thrones and Dominions,</HI> that all pay him a dutiful and joyful Subjection and Obedience <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>How's</HI> Redeemer's Dominion over the invisi∣ble World, Page 92.</NOTE>:</Q>
And shall we, poor weak and worthless Worms, dispute his Ti∣tle, and dare to rebel against him? What Dan∣ger is there in such a Case, <HI>lest his Wrath be kindled
<PB N="9" REF="004599_0015_100DAA04953C7278"/>
and we perish by the Way</HI>▪ But, as he is a mighty so he is a merciful Prince: He invites and courts our Submission; and will readily accept us upon Condition of it: And there is no other Way, whereby the Sinner can effectually provide for his own Safety. Oh, then that you would all immediately flee for Refuge to this powerful and compassionate Saviour; that you would entirely resign and give up your selves to him, and not rest satisfied till you have good Ground to hope that you have made him your Friend, and are comfortably assur'd of being kindly remember'd by him.</P>
<P>And so I come to the</P>
<P N="2">II. General Head propos'd in speaking to the Words, which was, To <HI>consider of the Prayer the dying Person in the Text puts up, and which all which ought to put up consequent upon the Belief</HI> of the foregoing Truths, <HI>especially in the like Cir∣cumstances.</HI> Being verily perswaded of his own future Existence, and that the dying JESUS was about to be exalted at the right Hand of GOD, and to enter upon the full Possession of his regal Power, and so would have the disposing of him after Death, He makes this Request, <HI>LORD, re∣member me, when thou comest into thy Kingdom. Re∣member me,</HI> that is, <HI>remember me for Good</HI>: Or <HI>remem∣ber me so as to shew Favour</HI> to me: He does not prescribe to him, how far, and in what Degree he should do it: But he dreads the Tho't of being utterly rejected, and begs that he might not whol∣ly fall short of his Mercy. And, as he prayed to Christ as <HI>going,</HI> we are to pray to him as <HI>gone into his Kingdom</HI>; and as having <HI>all Power in Heaven and Earth given to him,</HI> that <HI>he would remember us for Good,</HI> and <HI>shew Favour to us in the other World.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="004599_0016_100DAA07015D9048"/>And further, to prove that this ought to be the Matter of our Prayer, I need only put you in Mind, what an inestimable Blessing it is, and how much it must needs be the Object of our Desire. It is a Thing greatly to be desir'd, that CHRIST in his Kingdom would think upon us for Good while we are in this World, and when we are departing out of it: That, as we are <HI>walking thro' the Valley of the Shadow of Death,</HI> he would take a favourable Notice of us, and let no needful Sup∣ports and Consolations be wanting to us. But it is more especially to be desir'd, that we may have his kind Remembrance when we come into the other World; whether upon our immediate De∣parture, or at the Resurrection and final Judg∣ment.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is infinitely worthy of our Desire, and ought therefore to be the Matter of our Prayer, that we may be <HI>thus remember'd by CHRIST in his Kingdom immediately upon our Death and Departure out of this World</HI> If he, who is the Lord of Para∣dise, and has the Keys of it in his keeping, be not merciful to us, what will become of us? If we are then excluded from his Favour and Protecti∣on, what can we expect, but that our Souls, as soon as ever they quit their present Habitations, will fall as a Prey into the Hands of that roaring Lion, who has always greedily sought to devour them? What, but that they will be carried away to some or other of those hellish Dens; where, besides the Tortures we shall receive from those merciless Spirits, to whose Company we shall now be perpetually confin'd, we shall undergo in∣finitely more than we can at present conceive from our own awaken'd and enrag'd Conscience, that biting Worm that shall never dy, and from
<PB N="11" REF="004599_0017_100DAA09EC1F16F8"/>
the Wrath of an omnipotent GOD, that fierce and flaming <HI>Fire that will never be quench'd.</HI> But, if upon our leaving this World, our exalted and glorified LORD be pleas'd to think upon us for Good, and to dispose of us in a State of Happi∣ness, some of those Angels, that attend upon him, and pay their cheerful Subjection to him, shall have Charge concerning our departed Spi∣rits; who shall defend them from the hellish Hosts, that stand ready to devour them, and con∣duct them safe to the blissful Habitations provid∣ed for them; where they shall obtain a compleat Rest from Sin and Sorrow, where they shall be like to CHRIST, and see him as he is; where their Faculties shall be vastly improv'd; where they shall join the sweet and agreable Society of Angels and perfected Spirits, and be perpetually exercised in the most noble Employments, till the Resurrection and final Judgment. And so I come to say</P>
<P N="2">2. That it is a Thing infinitely worthy of our Desire, that CHRIST, <HI>who is gone into his King∣dom, and will in that Day sit upon the Throne of his Glory, may so remember us as to shew Mercy to us.</HI> We have full Assurance that there is such a Day approaching: A Day, when our blessed LORD, who now sits at the right Hand of GOD, shall <HI>come in his Glory, when he shall descend from Heaven with a Shout▪ with the Voice of the Arch-Angel, and the Trump of GOD:</HI> When <HI>all that are in their Graves shall hear his Voice and come forth,</HI> and when <HI>Quick and Dead shall appear</HI> before him. So that, in a Sense, he may then be said to <HI>remember us all,</HI> there being no one of the whole Race of <HI>Adam</HI> that shall escape his Notice and Regard. But the Thing so much to be desir'd is, that <HI>he would re∣member

us for Good, and so as to shew Mercy to us.</HI> Without this, what a miserable State shall we be in? If we are of the Number of those, to whom he shall say, <HI>I know you not,</HI> how dismal will be the Sound? Oh! the hideous Shrieks and bitter Outcries, that will be heard at the pronouncing of that dreadful Sentence, <HI>Go ye cursed into ever∣lasting Fire, prepar'd for the Devil and his Angels!</HI> Who can conceive the thousandth Part of the Misery and Torment that is included in it, and which those forlorn Wretches, that fall under it, must forever endure? But, if our great LORD be then pleas'd to think upon us for Good, and we are rank'd among his Favourites and Friends, what can we desire more to compleat our Feli∣city? With what ravishing Pleasures shall our Minds then abound and overflow to behold our LORD placing us at his right Hand, and to hear him saying to us, <HI>Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepar'd for you from the Founda∣tion of the World</HI>? With what Songs of Joy and Victory shall we return with him to the City of the living GOD? And how faint, how imperfect, and inadequate are the most exalted Ideas, we are now able to form to ourselves of the ineffable Delights we shall uninterruptedly partake of throughout eternal Ages? Thus you see how worthy it is of our Desire, and consequently how much it becomes us to make it our Prayer, <HI>that CHRIST would remember us now he is in his King∣dom,</HI> and during the Exercise of that royal Power, with which, as Mediator, he is invested: We are to pray, that he would <HI>remember us at Death,</HI> and that he would <HI>remember us at the Resurrection</HI>; that he, who has the Decision of our Case, would <HI>shew us Mercy, and determine us to a State of Hap∣piness</HI>: We are to be often making this Prayer
<PB N="13" REF="004599_0019_100DAA0E7A5F38D8"/>
in the Time of our Life and Health: But it is especially proper in the Time of our Death: And it very well becomes those that die, as did the Malefactor spoken of in the Text. And so I come to the</P>
<P N="3">III. Thing propos'd, which was, To <HI>consider the Manner in which he puts up this Prayer, and in which it becomes every one to do it in the like Time and Case,</HI> if he would hope for the Success he met with. That the Prayer of this dying Male∣factor was <HI>prevalent and effectual,</HI> we may learn from the Verse immediately following our Text. Having said unto JESUS, <HI>LORD, remember me, when thou comest into thy Kingdom</HI>; we are told, that <HI>JESUS said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To Day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.</HI> And the Manner, in which he puts up this Prayer, and in which it becomes <HI>all</HI> in the like Time and Case, to put up the same, may be learn'd from the Text and the preceding Verses.</P>
<P>And here, I shall instance in a few Things, which deserve to be more fully insisted on, than the Time will allow of at present. And</P>
<P N="1">1. The Person here spoken of, <HI>makes this Prayer in the Exercise of a strong and active Faith;</HI> and so <HI>must every one in the like Case, that expects to be heard, accepted and blessed.</HI> The <HI>Faith</HI> of this dying Ma∣lefactor, is in some Measure evident from what has been already said: And what is related in the Context is abundantly expressive of <HI>it</HI>: He professes his Belief concerning JESUS, that <HI>he had done nothing amiss</HI>; and consequently that, in suffering as an Imposter, he suffer'd wrongfully, that he was the very Person he profess'd himself
<PB N="14" REF="004599_0020_100DAA109853B110"/>
to be, even <HI>a Prophet sent from GOD</HI>: And then, being convinc'd that he was perfectly innocent, and had no Sin to suffer for of his own, he was doubtless perswaded, that he suffered for the Sins of others: That <HI>he was cut off to make Re∣conciliation for Iniquity, and to bring in everlasting Righteousness,</HI> and therefore trusted to the Merit of his Sacrifice: Thus he implicitly acknow∣ledges him as <HI>Prophet</HI> and <HI>Priest</HI>; and expresly owns him as <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>King,</HI> &amp; submits himself to him as such: And all this he does at a Time, when he was in the very Depth of Disgrace: Such was the Faith that he was in the Exercise of —And, with something of the like Belief in CHRIST, of the like Reliance upon him, and entire Resignation to him, does it become all in the like Circumstances to make the foregoing Prayer, as they would hope for Success.</P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P N="2">2. The dying Person spoken of in the Text, puts up the Prayer here recorded, <HI>in the Exercise of a sincere and fervent Love.</HI>—And so must <HI>every one</HI> in the like Case, if he expects the like graci∣ous Answer that he met with. <HI>His Love to GOD and CHRIST is evident,</HI> in that he could not for∣bear manifesting his Dislike of the Irreverence and Disrespect that were shewn to them by his Fel∣low-Sufferer: And his Love to his Neighbour is evident, from the Rebuke he administers to him and the Concern he expresses for him: And, in the Exercise of the like Love to GOD and CHRIST, and the like charitable Disposition to∣wards Men, are we all, while living, but especi∣ally when dying, to put up this Request, <HI>That CHRIST would remember us</HI> now <HI>he is in his King∣dom;</HI> even with Minds free from all manner of
<PB N="15" REF="004599_0021_100DAA13EBAA7F50"/>
Ill-Will to those, who, we conceive, have been injurious to us, or we can't expect to prevail.</P>
<P>Again;</P>
<P N="3">3. It was <HI>in the Exercise of a deep Repentance,</HI> that the condemn'd and dying Person here spoken of, makes this Prayer: And in the like penitent Frame must every one put up this Request, if he hopes to succeed, as he did. He was fully appre∣hensive how unworthily he had behav'd towards GOD, and how ill he had deserv'd at his Hands: <HI>Dost not thou fear GOD,</HI> says he to his Fellow, <HI>seeing thou art in the same Condemnation; and we in∣deed justly, for we receive the Reward of our Deeds.</HI> Yea he doubtless saw himself worthy not only of Death, but of Hell; was suitably affected with the Consideration of it, and sensible that nothing but infinite Mercy could rescue him from it. And in the same Manner ought all dying Persons, especially all dying Malefactors, to make this Prayer to their exalted LORD and Saviour, if they expect that it should be prevalent and effec∣tual, viz. That he would <HI>remember them</HI> now he is <HI>in his Kingdom:</HI> They must see their Sins, as be∣ing odious and offensive to GOD, and as laying them open to his Vengeance: They must take Notice of the Hand of God in what has befallen them &amp; own that it is but the just Recompence of their Doings: Yea, they must be sensible that they have exposed themselves to greater Miseries than have befallen them, or that can befall them, in this World, and that they might justly be <HI>punish'd with everlasting Destruction from the Presence of the LORD, and from the Glory of his Power</HI>: They are there∣fore to cast themselves down at his Feet, and to place their only Hope in his free and sovereign
<PB N="16" REF="004599_0022_100DAA16915758A8"/>
Grace, <HI>looking for the Mercy of our LORD JESUS CHRIST unto eternal Life.</HI> And then, once more,</P>
<P>It is <HI>with the utmost Fervency,</HI> that the dying Person, whom the Text speaks of, makes this Prayer; and in the same Manner must every one put up this Request to his LORD and Saviour, if he hopes for the Success he met with. His Words, as One notes,
<Q>carry an Air of Importu∣nity in them: When he says, <HI>LORD, remember me</HI>; he as it were breathes out his very Soul in his Prayer. It is as if he had said, <HI>LORD, do but remember me,</HI> and I have enough; <HI>I desire no more; into thy Hands I commit my Case</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Henry.</HI></NOTE>.</Q>
And thus does it become <HI>every one</HI> when he makes this Prayer in the like Case, if he would do it to any Purpose, to do it with the <HI>utmost Earnestness and Fervour of Soul</HI>: He must pray with the <HI>Importu∣nity</HI> that the vast Importance of the Thing re∣quires: He must <HI>plead</HI> with his great LORD, as one that is pleading <HI>for Life, even an immortal Life,</HI> and must <HI>strive and agonize in his Prayer,</HI> as one that can't tell how to be denied.</P>
<P>Thus I have as briefly as possible <HI>consider'd some great Truths in which this dying Person was, and which all may be in the firm Belief and Perswasion;</HI> as also <HI>the Prayer which he put up, and all ought to put up in Consequence of such a Belief:</HI> And the <HI>Manner in which he put up this Prayer, and in which it con∣cerns every one to do it,</HI> if he would hope for the like Success that he had.</P>
<P>All then, that remains, is to make some suitable <HI>Application</HI> of what has been said: And here,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="17" REF="004599_0023_100DAA1856F578D0"/>1. With the tenderest Bowels of Compassion, and the deepest Concern of Soul, I would apply myself to the <HI>poor Prisoner,</HI> whose miserable Case has occasion'd this vast and numerous Assembly: And in a few Words let me exhort you, that you would <HI>in a becoming Manner make the Prayer of the condemned and dying Person,</HI> that has been now put into your Mouth.</P>
<P>You are, I trust, verily perswaded of that which you will most certainly find to be true, that, as you are leaving this, you are going into another World, and are to exist and live forever in a future State: I take it for granted, that you are also perswaded that CHRIST, who is gone into his Kingdom, has Authority to dispose of you; and that accordingly, being by and by, even within an Hour or two more, to appear be∣fore him, he will then determine your State; and you will be unalterably fix'd in a Condition of Happiness or Misery: And, believing this, how can you forbear breathing out this Request, <HI>LORD, remember me, now thou art in thy Kingdom</HI>?</P>
<P>It ought to be, and I trust is, Matter of deep Hu∣miliation to you, and the great Grief and Burden of your Soul, that you have liv'd so much in the <HI>Neglect of Prayer, and other religious Duties,</HI> in the Time past of your Life, whereby you have pro∣voked GOD to leave you to a great many Sins, and particularly to the Sin, that has brought you to this ignominious Death. And, as you have rejected CHRIST in your prosperous Seasons, when he has called you, you having one Time after another refused; you must acknowledge, that it would be just with him, to reject you,
<PB N="18" REF="004599_0024_100DAA19FB288800"/>
and turn a deaf Ear to your Cry now in the Time of your Calamity and Distress.</P>
<P>But yet don't absolutely despond; but so far encourage yourself as to make your humble Ap∣plication to him: And be sure to do it in the Manner that has been now prescribed.</P>
<P>See to it, that you make this Prayer to CHRIST in the due <HI>Exercise of Faith</HI>; with an entire Sur∣render of yourself to him, and a firm and stedfast Reliance upon him. Again,</P>
<P>Put up this Prayer in the <HI>Exercise of Love to</HI> GOD <HI>and CHRIST, and of universal Benevolence and Charity to Men.</HI></P>
<P>Do it also under a <HI>penitent Sense of your Sins</HI>; sorrowing that you have offended and dishonour∣ed a glorious and gracious GOD. Acknowlege the Equity of what has befallen you: That you are <HI>receiving the Reward of your Doings</HI>: Yea, that you are justly exposed to greater and more amazing Miseries. But yet have Recourse to <HI>sovereign Grace,</HI> and let your sole Dependance be upon it.</P>
<P>And then, Let this Prayer be put up to your glorified Lord and Saviour, with all <HI>possible Ear∣nestness and Ardour of Soul:</HI> Plead your Necessity of an Interest in him, and the inconceivable Mi∣sery you must incur without it: Say,
<Q>I am un∣done, for ever undone, unless thou wilt think upon me for Good, <HI>save me Lord, or I perish.</HI></Q>
Plead also his infinite Compassion to poor perish∣ing Sinners: Say to him,
<Q>Was it not in Love to the Souls of Men that thou wer't pleas'd to
<PB N="19" REF="004599_0025_100DAA1D739A3480"/>
come down from Heaven, to be made Flesh, and to dwell among us? Hast thou not manifested an infinite Concern for their Salvation in thy Life and Death; and dost thou not do the same since thy Resurrection and Ascension? Art thou not now <HI>touch'd with the feeling of our Infir∣mities,</HI> and affected with our Miseries? LORD, <HI>pity me in this my Time of Need.</HI> LORD, <HI>remem∣ber me, have Mercy upon me, and receive my Spirit.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And, if you look to him in the Manner you have been now directed to, you may hope to be heard and accepted of your gracious LORD, and that <HI>this Day,</HI> you shall <HI>be with him in Paradise.</HI></P>
<P>But, it is Time for me to turn myself to the rest of the Audience.</P>
<P>And, Men and Brethren, let me</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Bespeak your tender Regards to the Person</HI> here before you, and to the other in the like Case, who have been sentenc'd, and are just now going, to be cut off by the Sword of human Justice: They are most certainly fit and proper Objects of your Pity: Behold them then with a becoming Com∣passion and Concern: And let it be our united Cry to our great LORD and Saviour, that he would <HI>remember them now he is in his Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>And then</P>
<P><HI>Nextly,</HI> I would address you with a more par∣ticular Regard to yourselves, and exhort you to make it your Endeavour, as well as your Prayer, that your blessed Saviour, who is gone into his Kingdom and is seated upon the Throne of his Glory, <HI>may remember you for Good and shew Favour to you, when you come into another World.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="004599_0026_100DAA200E95E6E8"/>And let the Example of the condemn'd and dy∣ing Person here before you, and the other under the like Circumstances, serve as a Means to quicken you to it.</P>
<P>It is, you are sensible, <HI>the first</HI> Instance of the Kind that has occur'd in the Province. And Oh! if it were the Will of GOD, that nothing of the like Nature might again happen among us! And, as it is the <HI>first,</HI> and a <HI>double Example,</HI> you seem peculiarly called to take Notice of it▪ And accordingly be perswaded to behold them with a suitable Frame and Temper of Mind.</P>
<P>And here, as to those of you, that have been in a good Measure preserv'd from falling into the like Sins, let me exhort you, when you look upon these Objects, to do it not with Contempt and Triumph as to them; nor yet with vain Glory as to yourselves: But consider, <HI>who it is that ma∣keth you to differ,</HI> and admire and adore his distin∣guishing Grace.</P>
<P>But are there not those of you, who upon En∣quiry may find that you have been too faulty up∣on a like Account?</P>
<P>It now seems that there has been <HI>one</HI> among us, thro' whose Means these Persons have been remark∣ably detected, that is <HI>equally</HI> &amp; it may be much <HI>more heinously, guilty in the Sight of</HI> GOD: And, could I suppose the Person to be with in Hearing, I would say, <HI>Don't encourage yourself from your present Impu∣nity:</HI> Be assur'd that, though you are as yet conceal'd from Men, both you and your Crime are known to GOD, and that, though to serve some wise and good Purposes, he may suffer you
<PB N="21" REF="004599_0027_100D8380F7259978"/>
to escape for a while, you may be bro't to Shame and Misery in this World: Repent therefore, make thy Peace with GOD, and walk very hum∣bly before him: Or else, if your Sin do not find you out in this World, you will be expos'd to very heavy and distinguishing Punishment in the other World.</P>
<P>And, as to all such of you as are indulging your selves in any unchast and filthy Practices; let me admonish you of the Folly of trusting to the Se∣crecy of your Sins. Consider, that the GOD, to whose View they are expos'd, may before you are aware and in a Way you little think of, <HI>bring to Light those hidden Things of Darkness:</HI> And you may be brought to Punishment on the Ac∣count of them: Take Heed then, lest the Hea∣vens reveal your Iniquity, and the Earth rise up against you: And be prevail'd with to betake your selves to the Exercise of a speedy &amp; deep Repentance towards GOD, and to <HI>put away the Evil of your Doings from before his Eyes.</HI></P>
<P>Let me also exhort all such of you as allow yourselves in the Neglect and Abuse of GOD's Sabbaths; (which the condemn'd Person here present reflects upon with so much Regret) and in such like Sins as make Way for others, and very often lead to Capital Crimes, to beware of persisting in them, <HI>lest you also Mourn at the last,</HI> and say▪ <HI>How have we hated Instruction, and our Souls despised Reproof?</HI></P>
<P>In a Word, Whatever are the Sins of Heart or Life you have any of you hitherto indulg'd, be perswaded to give yourselves no Rest till you are effectually reclaim'd and turn'd from them to
<PB N="22" REF="004599_0028_100DAA219CFFA908"/>
GOD; that so you may the more confidently expect and pray to be <HI>remembred for Good, and to obtain Mercy from your great</HI> LORD, when you come into that other World, to which you must quickly and may suddenly remove.</P>
<P>But here perhaps you may be ready to object,
<Q>That there is no need of your making so much Haste to leave your Sins and to return to GOD and your Duty, but that you may safely put it off to the Close of your Days; that it will suf∣fice to make this Prayer at the last:</Q>
And may be apt to bring this Instance of the Thief upon the Cross as an Evidence of it.</P>
<P>But, if this Person's Conversion was begun during his Imprisonment, which as it has been hinted to you, is what some have conjectur'd, the Argument utterly fails, and there is no Force at all in it.</P>
<P>But, supposing it to be otherwise, and that, to keep Men from absolute Despair, there should be this one instance in our Bible of one who at the last Hour was thus heard and accepted in his Prayer: Seeing this is the only one, and atten∣ded with very extraordinary Circumstances, that Man can hardly be thought to be in his Wits, that should take any great Encouragement from it. "It was done, says Mr. <HI>Chillingworth</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Chillingworth</HI>'s Works, Page 385.</NOTE>, at the Time of CHRIST's Suffering; a Season, wherein GOD, in that one Act of the Redempti- of his Son, express'd the very utmost of his Mer∣cy. and discover'd unto the World as it were in
<PB N="23" REF="004599_0029_100DAA23520098C8"/>
one entire Sum, <HI>all the Riches and Treasures of his Goodness:</HI> If therefore he was pleas'd at such a Time to Work a Miracle of Mercy, what Ground can any have from hence to expect it in ordinary Cases?"</P>
<P>And besides, It is probable, that this Person had never before enjoy'd, and therefore could not abuse the Day and Means of Grace, and so could not incur the like Guilt that we do, in putting off our Repentance, who live under the Gospel.</P>
<P>And whosoever is embolden'd from this Ex∣ample to defer it to the last, presuming that he shall then <HI>find Mercy,</HI> (should he have the Oppor∣tunity to ask for it, which is too great an Uncer∣tainty for any one to depend upon) will most probably find himself deceiv'd.</P>
<P>Let none then dare any longer to delay this great and necessary Work: But if you are yet in Bondage to any of your Lusts; let me entreat you, that you would not rest satisfied until you are deliver'd from so base and dangerous a Servi∣tude, and have in good Earnest subjected your selves to the Yoke and Government of CHRIST.</P>
<P>In a Word, Let us all cordially embrace and obey his Gospel, and labour more and more to conduct ourselves as becomes his Disciples: <HI>Lay∣ing aside every Weight, and the Sins that do most easily beset us, let us run with Patience the Race set before us; looking unto JESUS, the Author and Finisher of our Faith</HI>; and be continually aspiring after a nearer Conformity to his <HI>Doctrine</HI> and <HI>Example,</HI> that so, when we are taking Leave of this World, we may with the greater Confidence pray
<PB N="24" REF="004599_0030_100DAA2664CE3DC0"/>
<HI>that he would remember us when we come into the other World:</HI> And he will then be assuredly mindful of us at Death and the Resurrection, and make us compleatly and inconceivably happy for ever and ever, AMEN and AMEN.</P>

<HEAD>A Brief NARRATIVE Concerning the CRIMINALS, Whose Execution was the Occasion of the preceding Sermon.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N the Preface to that Discourse, it is suggested, how these Persons came to be detected, and bro't to Punish∣ment: And, leaving it to the Rea∣der to make proper and pertinent Re∣flections upon the <HI>remarkable Discovery of their Crimes, and the Mysteriousness of Divine Providence, in suffering a third Person,</HI> as it now seems probable, one it may be more grosly guilty than themselves, and by whose Means they have been discover'd, <HI>as yet to escape</HI>: Whether for <HI>Mercy or Judgment</HI> to the particular Person, and for what Designs as to others, though doubtless for wise and good Purposes, must be reserv'd to <HI>the Revelation of the righteous Judgment of GOD.</HI> I shall now give a very short Account of their <HI>Behaviour after their Condemnation.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="004599_0032_100DAA29F5ACBCE8"/>No sooner had they receiv'd their Sentence, which was upon the 30th Day of <HI>August</HI> last, but seem'd to be <HI>deeply sensible of their miserable State, and to apply themselves with a great deal of Care to prepare for their Death.</HI> But, after some Time, a Notion being suggested to them of attempting an Escape and being perswaded by some indiscreet Persons who came to visit them, that their Sen∣tence was rigorous and unjust, and that upon due Application they might obtain a Reprieve so as to be finally excused from suffering: These Things seem'd to have an ill Influence (especially upon one of them) and to <HI>divert their Minds from Things of the greatest Importance</HI> for a while. But, for some Time before their Death, they appear'd, to have <HI>laid aside these Thoughts, and to set them∣selves with all Diligence to work out their Salvation, and to secure their future well-being.</HI></P>
<P>One of them, viz. <HI>Sarah Simpson,</HI> a Widow Wo∣man, of about 27 Years of Age, was born in the Province of <HI>New-Hampshire,</HI> in the Parish of <HI>Oyster-River,</HI> now the Town of <HI>Durham.</HI> She was put out young, and serv'd her Appren∣ticeship in <HI>Portsmouth.</HI> She was one, that had a good Degree of Understanding: And, tho' she sadly bewail'd <HI>her Negligence and Folly, in making no better a Use of the Opportunities</HI> she had enjoy'd of acquainting herself with Things of a religi∣ous Nature; yet she was not, when first confin'd, <HI>remarkably ignorant upon that Account, but made great Proficiency in Knowledge</HI> during her imprisonment: The Ministers of the Town making it their con∣stant Business to instruct her, as well as pray with her: And being also occasionally visited by some of the neighbouring Ministers and other good People, who offered her all the Assistance they
<PB N="27" REF="004599_0033_100DAA2CA43948F0"/>
could. The Way of publick Worship to which she had been us'd, was the Way practic'd by the Churches in this Country: Accordingly she went every <HI>Lords-Day</HI> to the Place of Worship, where she had been formerly wont to attend. And, on the <HI>Lord's-Day</HI> before her Execution, she desir'd a Paper might be read, wherein she in a very moving Manner, <HI>ask'd the Prayers of all GOD's People for her,</HI> as it was the last Time she was ever like to have the Benefit of them upon such a Day: Taking Occasion at the same Time to <HI>bewail her Breach of GOD's Sabbaths,</HI> which she declar'd, <HI>lay peculiarly heavy upon her Spirits, and warn'd all,</HI> more particularly <HI>young Persons, to beware of the like.</HI></P>
<P>On the Day of her Execution, she heard the foregoing Sermon seemingly with a great deal of Attention. She walk'd from the Prison, to the Place of Execution, which was not much less than a Mile; being accompanied by the Mini∣sters of the Congregational Churches in the Town, and some other of the neighbouring Mi∣nisters. She all the Way <HI>discover'd an uncommon Composure of Mind, and gave very pertinent Answers to the Questions</HI> that were put to her.</P>
<P>After she came to the Place of Execution, a Writing, (that was put into one of the Ministers Hands by the Way, said to be of her dictating, and which she acknowledg'd to be so) was pub∣lickly read at her Desire; wherein she <HI>mentions several Things that were Matter of Grief and Bitter∣ness to her,</HI> as, That she had <HI>been so forgetful of GOD in her Childhood and Youth, and pass'd away her early Days in light and wicked Company: To which she ascribes it, that her riper Years had been a Course of more direct Rebellion against</HI> GOD: And she de∣sires,
<PB N="28" REF="004599_0034_100DAA2F5B53E538"/>
that <HI>Parents, as well as Children, would receive Instruction</HI> from.</P>
<P>She here also laments, that <HI>she had made no bet∣ter an Use of</HI> GOD<HI>'s Sabbaths and of her Opportuni∣ties of hearing the Word:</HI> She declares, that, when she went to hear the Word, she was <HI>not govern'd by right Motives, and gave little, or no Heed to it:</HI> That, tho' it was sometimes very acceptable, and seem'd <HI>as the lovely Song, of one that had a pleasant Voice,</HI> &amp;c. yet <HI>it made no deep and lasting Impression upon her Mind</HI>: Accordingly she <HI>advises young People to keep their Hearts and Eyes from wandring</HI> in the House of GOD, and closely to attend to that which is their proper Business there: She also <HI>mourns, that she had improv'd no more by the Op∣portunities she had had in some Families in which she had liv'd, or been conversant,</HI> for some little Time after she was grown up; where the Worship of GOD was upheld, and where she had receiv'd many good and wholesome Instructions. And she men∣tions it with Regret, that, when she enter'd into the Marriage State, <HI>it was not with one that took Care to maintain the Exercise of Family Religion,</HI> and advises all when they marry, to make it their great Care <HI>to marry in the</HI> LORD: She at the same Time, expresses her <HI>Thankfulness to the Ministers</HI>▪ that had visited her, <HI>and that,</HI> as she express'd it, <HI>had so often carried her to the Throne of Grace,</HI> particular∣ly to the two who had been most frequent in their Visits: And, declaring her <HI>Forgiveness of all the World,</HI> she signifies <HI>her own Hope,</HI> notwith∣standing her great and manifold Sins, <HI>of obtaining Forgiveness and finding Mercy with GOD thro' the Blood of JESUS CHRIST his Son.</HI></P>

She was indeed very willing to be inform'd, and diligently heark∣en'd to such as would take the Pains to instruct her: She attended upon the <HI>Lord's-Days,</HI> at an Episcopalian Assembly, that being the only Way of publick Worship at which she had ever been present; except it be that in which she was edu∣cated. But she was privately visited and assisted not only by the Minister of that Society, but the Ministers of the other Churches: And from the Pains that had been taken to make her duly <HI>sen∣sible of her miserable and perishing Estate by Reason of Sin, and of the Way to obtain Salvation by JESUS CHRIST</HI>; she seem'd at length to have some sui∣table Apprehensions of them, and express'd her <HI>Repentance for her other Sins, as well as that for which she was condemn'd.</HI> She heard a Sermon at Church the Morning before her Execution. She walk'd to the Place accompanied by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Brown,</HI> who read Prayers for her there.
