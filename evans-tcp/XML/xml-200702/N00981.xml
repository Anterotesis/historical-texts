<P>WHOSE <HI>Voice</HI> is this? Tis the <HI>Noise of the Voice</HI> of GOD, and a <HI>Sound that goes out of His Mouth.</HI> A more than Flinty Hardness is upon our Hearts, if we cannot say, <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this our Hearts tremble, and are moved out of their place.</HI></P>
<P>It is an Ancient Observation, <HI>That the Wisdom of any Nation is very much to be observed in the Proverbs of the Nation.</HI> Of
<PB N="4" REF="001175_0003_0FB0DF0E53552478"/>
the <HI>Israelitish</HI> Nation then it might we be said, <HI>Surely this Great Nation is a Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> &amp; Understanding People!</HI> For the <HI>Proverb</HI> of that Nation were of a Divine Ori∣ginal. But thro' the Singular and So∣vereign Favour of God, the <HI>Proverbs <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Israel</HI> are now become <HI>Ours</HI> as well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Israels,</HI> and are derived with other <HI>Bles∣sings of Abraham,</HI> unto the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> The <HI>Proverbs</HI> are called by a Name, that sig∣nifies, <HI>Ruling Sentences;</HI> Intimating, that our Affairs and Motions, are to be <HI>O∣ver-ruled,</HI> by the maxims of Wisdom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> these Holy <HI>Proverbs.</HI> Oh! That th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Proverb</HI> now in our Hands may have such an <HI>Authority,</HI> such an <HI>Efficacy</HI> with it, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> our Lives, as may <HI>Over-rule</HI> our Dispo∣sition to those things which will bring all manner of <HI>Evil</HI> upon us.</P>
<P>It is a memorable passage, Psal. 125. 3. <HI>The Rod of the Wicked, shall not rest up∣on the Lot of the Righteous.</HI> There is in that passage, an Allusion, to the method used for the Dividing of <HI>Lands</HI> among the Jews of old. A <HI>Rod,</HI> or a <HI>Staff,</HI> was used in the Dividing of Lands by <HI>Lot,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> assigning to any one, what portion &amp;
<PB N="5" REF="001175_0004_0FB0DF114A6B86B8"/>
Lands was to fall unto him. The mean∣ing is not, That the <HI>Wicked</HI> shall not <HI>Sc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urge</HI> the <HI>Righteous;</HI> as from the mee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sound of the word, we sometimes do carry it; But the meaning is, That the <HI>Portion</HI> of the <HI>Wicked</HI> shall not be the <HI>Portion</HI> of the <HI>Righteous;</HI> they shall not in their Condition be Confounded with one another.</P>
<P>Behold, the <HI>Different Lot</HI> of the <HI>Wicked</HI> and of the <HI>Righteous!</HI> In the Verse we have a Distinction of men; Even the very same that now distinguishes this Congregation. Will every man seriously Enquire, <HI>To which of these do I belong?</HI> The <HI>Wicked</HI> and the <HI>Righteous,</HI> are the several parties. Of the <HI>Wicked,</HI> we have before us, two most awful Admonitions. First, We are told▪ what they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. They are <HI>Sinners.</HI> Their Name implies, that they <HI>go out of the way.</HI> For what? But that they may <HI>pursue that which is Evil.</HI> And then, We are told, what they <HI>find.</HI> I may rather say, what <HI>finds them. Evil</HI> does <HI>pursue them.</HI> And will it not <HI>come at them</HI> too? Most certainly! Most cer∣tainly!</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="001175_0005_0FB0DF13796319E0"/>
We have now this Doctrine and Warning from Heaven to insist upon.</P>
<Q>Sinners that Pursue Evil, are Pursuant of Evil.</Q>
<P>That the terrible Truth now before us, may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> apprehended, we may so order certain <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>positions,</HI> that they shall discharge <HI>Answers</HI> and Thunders, unto all the several Points, of Enquiry that we should have our Discourse to hear upon.</P>
<P>I. Who are the <HI>Sinners,</HI> whom <HI>Evil pursues?</HI> Who, but such as <HI>Pursue Sin &amp; Evil?</HI> It is the Description of Ungodly <HI>Sinners,</HI> Prov. 11. 19. <HI>He that pursueth Evil, does it unto his own Death.</HI> Indeed, all men are <HI>Sinners,</HI> in some Degree, in a very sad Degree. The most confirm∣ed and unhappy <HI>Sinner<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> in the world, are the <HI>Generation so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in their own Eyes,</HI> as to count themselves without Sin. We read in the Scripture. 1 King 8. 46. <HI>There as no man that sinneth not.</HI> Alas, There is no need of going to the <HI>Scripture</HI> for the proof of it. But <HI>Evil</HI> does not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="7" REF="001175_0006_0FB0DF14FB8B02F0"/>
all men. Some are <HI>Penitent Sinners</HI> and <HI>Pardoned Sinners. Evil</HI> will not <HI>Pur∣sue</HI> such <HI>Sinners. Evil!</HI> No, but God will <HI>surely do them Good.</HI> Their Joyful Song may be, <HI>Goodness &amp; Mercy shall follow me all my Dayes.</HI> But there are <HI>Sinners,</HI> who follow the Courses of Sin. It is said of them, 2 Pet. 2. 2. <HI>They follow their Pernicious wayes.</HI> Truly, <HI>Sin</HI> is E∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: We sin greatly, if we don't count <HI>Sin</HI> the <HI>greatest Evil.</HI> There are <HI>Sinners</HI> who <HI>Desire,</HI> and <HI>Study,</HI> and <HI>Labour</HI> to do that <HI>Evil.</HI> Some there are who can say with him, Psal. 38. 20. <HI>I follow that which is Good.</HI> And that which is <HI>Good</HI> will doubtless <HI>follow them.</HI> Yea, but there are those, who <HI>Follow that which is Evil.</HI> We read of some, Prov. 1. 16. <HI>Their F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et run to Evil.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Way,</HI> and their <HI>Walk,</HI> and their <HI>Work,</HI> lies in the Courses of <HI>Sin.</HI> They make a <HI>Trade</HI> of <HI>Sin.</HI> Sin is their <HI>Business</HI> and their <HI>Delight.</HI> The <HI>Principles</HI> of Sin, are those which they continually act upon. They are upon the <HI>Designs</HI> and the <HI>Courses</HI> of <HI>Sin;</HI> and they never were <HI>Turned</HI> from those Courses. No, They hold on in the <HI>Pur∣suit

of Evil:</HI> and as the Apostle speaks, <HI>They work it with Greediness:</HI> As the Pro∣phet speaks, <HI>They Sin as with a Cart-rope;</HI> they <HI>Sin</HI> till they are <HI>Weary,</HI> but yet they are never <HI>weary of Sin.</HI> These are the <HI>Sinners!</HI> And what will become of them?</P>
<P>There is in the Book of God, an <HI>Open Roll</HI> of <HI>Curses,</HI> denouncing the Doom of such miserable <HI>Sinners.</HI> I am now to stand for a while, as upon Mount <HI>Ebal;</HI> and Exhibit that <HI>Flying Roll</HI> before them. <HI>Be afraid,</HI> O Sinner, let <HI>Fearfulness</HI> now <HI>Surprize</HI> you, O pursuers of Evil. Hear how the <HI>Thunder</HI> of the Wrath of God, is Cursing them that <HI>set themselves in a way that is not Good.</HI></P>
<P>II. <HI>Evil</HI> will <HI>Pursue</HI> the Sinners that <HI>pursue Evil.</HI> What <HI>Evil?</HI> What less than <HI>All sorts of Evil. Sin</HI> and <HI>Evil,</HI> are indeed, the <HI>Mother</HI> and the <HI>Daughter.</HI> Tis a Scriptural Comparison; Jam. 1. 15 <HI>Sin brings forth Death.</HI> Or shall we bring another Comparison sometimes used a∣mong the Ancients? <HI>Flagit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m et Fla∣gellum, ut acus et Filum;</HI> This is to say, <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Evil,</HI> are the <HI>Needle</HI> and the

<HI>Threed;</HI> The <HI>One</HI> infallibly draws on the <HI>Other.</HI> But let us return to the Lan∣guage of the Scripture; In <HI>that,</HI> we read, Rom. 6, 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>The wages of Sin is Death▪ Death,</HI> Tis a Term that includes all the <HI>Evil,</HI> that can be imagined: More <HI>Evil</HI> than any man <HI>Alive</HI> can imagine!</P>
<P>Accordingly;</P>
<P>First, There is a <HI>Temporal Evil,</HI> which <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sues</HI> the Sinner. <HI>Ten Piagues</HI> pursued the Sinners of <HI>Egypt.</HI> We had in Pagan Antiquities, that the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> did for many hundreds of Years, with mourning, and howling, and lighted Candles, keep up an Anniversary Commemoration of them. So great, a much greater Vari∣ety of <HI>Pursues </HI> there is in the <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il</HI> that <HI>Pursueth</HI> Sinners. Unto Sinners, that is the Voice of God; Jer. 18. 11. <HI>Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I frame Evil against you.</HI> And will you see, how agreeably tis <HI>Fra∣med?</HI> Men indulge their Souls in <HI>Sinful</HI> and <HI>Sickly</HI> Appetites: The Evil of <HI>Sickness</HI> therefore does pursue the <HI>Sinners.</HI> Men do by Sin <HI>Dishonour the Name</HI> of God; The <HI>Evil</HI> of a <HI>Dishonour'd Name</HI> does therefore <HI>pursue the Sinners.</HI> Men are
<PB N="10" REF="001175_0009_0FB0E1A09EBA39E8"/>
not <HI>Rich towards God;</HI> The <HI>Evil</HI> of Po∣verty, and the loss of <HI>Riches</HI> does there∣fore <HI>pursue the Sinners.</HI> Men <HI>Idolize</HI> their <HI>Friends,</HI> or else they do not faithfully attend their Duty to and for their <HI>Friends.</HI> And so that <HI>Evil,</HI> the <HI>Death of their Friend</HI> does <HI>pursue the Sinners.</HI> Men are <HI>Un∣thankful,</HI> and <HI>Unfruitful</HI> under their En∣joyments; And so this <HI>Evil</HI> does <HI>pursue the Sinners,</HI> To be Deprived of their <HI>En∣joyments.</HI> Men do not <HI>Acknowledge God</HI> in their Undertakings; And the Sinners are <HI>Pursued</HI> with that <HI>Evil.</HI> To be Blasted in their <HI>Undertakings.</HI> If a <HI>Jonas</HI> depart from God, wonder not, O <HI>Jonas,</HI> that the Lord <HI>sends out</HI> a <HI>Tempest</HI> after thee. A <HI>Tempest</HI> of some <HI>Evil</HI> or other, will <HI>Pur∣sue</HI> them that <HI>Forsake the Lord.</HI> Under every such <HI>Evil</HI> as this, the <HI>Sinners</HI> may make that Confession; Dan. 9. 14. <HI>There∣fore has the Lord watched upon the Evil, and brought it upon us; For we Obeyed not His Voice.</HI></P>
<P>But, the <HI>Voice of the Trumpet</HI> now Sounding, the longer it Sounds, it must <HI>wax louder &amp; louder.</HI></P>
<P>For,</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="001175_0010_0FB0E1A1F5EC8508"/>
Secondly, There is a <HI>Spiritual</HI> E<HI>vil</HI> which <HI>Pursues</HI> the Sinner. A <HI>Resolved</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nner is <HI>pursued with evil</HI> indeed, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e holy God gives him up to commit <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore evil.</HI> Sin, Sin, is it self the most woful E<HI>vil,</HI> as well as the woful <HI>Foun∣tain</HI> of all other Evil. When <HI>Sin</HI> is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nished with <HI>Sin,</HI> or when for <HI>Sin</HI> men are left unto more <HI>Sin,</HI> Then, <HI>The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> does <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vil pursue Sinners,</HI> with the most horri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le Vengeance of God. I find, some In∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erpreters give this as the sense of the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entence</HI> here passed upon Sinners; <HI>Evil <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ursueth Sinners;</HI> That is to say, <HI>Sin∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers</HI> will have their Sinful and Evil Ha∣bits follow them, till they do Eternally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erish in them. A <HI>Lust</HI> is an <HI>Evil.</HI> Ne∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, Never does Evil more terribly <HI>pur∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ue a Sinner,</HI> than when he is given up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the <HI>Lust</HI> of his own Heart. But such oftentimes is the Dreadful Wrath of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Holy and Jealous God against a <HI>Sinner,</HI> as to leave him, to be Enslaved by a raging <HI>Lust</HI> as long as he lives. Thus we read, Psal. 81. 11. <HI>They would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hearken to my Voice; So I gave them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p to the Lust of their own Heart.</HI> A
<PB N="12" REF="001175_0011_0FB0E1A5A2479E98"/>
sinner is given up to the power of <HI>Lust;</HI> A <HI>Lust</HI> of intemperance, a <HI>Lust</HI> of Unchastity, a <HI>Lust</HI> of Covetousness and Earthly-mindedness. This <HI>Lust</HI> will now <HI>Pursue</HI> him all his Dayes; Tho' his <HI>Condition</HI> be changed, Tho' his <HI>Re∣lation</HI> be changed, yet his <HI>Lust</HI> continue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the same, and <HI>Pursues</HI> him in all his New Conditions and Relations: He goes per∣haps to get rid of his <HI>Lust,</HI> by some Devoti∣onary methods, but they signify no more than the <HI>Green Wythes</HI> about <HI>Sampson,</HI> for the Restraining of it; While he remains an Unregenerate <HI>Sinner,</HI> and a stranger to Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, it will Pursue him all his Dayes. And hence it comes to pass, that an astonish∣ing <HI>Blindness</HI> and <HI>Hardness</HI> comes upon the mind of a Sinner, and a lamentable Indisposition to <HI>Repentance.</HI> Oh! We have s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n, we have seen prodigious In∣stances! I have read of a Malefactor, one that had been Condemned to Dy for <HI>Stealing</HI> and <HI>Murder;</HI> That even in the very Hours of his Execution, he Procla∣med his Impenitence: His Fellow-sufferer could say to him, Luk. 23. 40. <HI>Dost th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="13" REF="001175_0012_0FB0E1A744243DE0"/>
not Fear God, seeing thou art under Con∣demnation?</HI> But I say unto you, <HI>Sinners</HI> can't be <HI>Pursued</HI> with a greater Evil, than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Soul insensible of the Evil, that <HI>Sin</HI> is bringing upon them! There have been <HI>Sinners</HI> actually <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iezed by a Law of Death, for <HI>Capital Crimes;</HI> These Criminals in their very Chains, have been so stupified, as to flatter themselves that there was no Danger near unto them; They have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t may be spent their Time in Drinking, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Gaming, in Profane Frolicks, when every Jingle of their Chains would have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ung that Peal in their Ears, <HI>Wretch, Thy Damnation slumbers not.</HI> And at last, when the Sword of Justice, has been just lifted up, to Cut them off, the marks of their <HI>Late Repentance</HI> have been how Strain'd, how Forc'd, and how wretched∣ly Defective! Tis because E<HI>vil pursues the Sinners;</HI> They have so provoked the Spirit of God, that He lets that worst of all Evils, <HI>Pursue</HI> them to the last; <HI>A Soul that cannot by Repentance be recovered out of the Snare of the Devil.</HI></P>
<P>But then there succeeds another <HI>Evil. Horror of Conscience</HI> is an Evil that <HI>pursueth

An Everlasting Banishment from God▪ the <HI>Chief Good,</HI> must needs be very <HI>Evil.</HI> When <HI>Sinners</HI> are fallen into a Damnation and Banishment, from the the Gracious Presence of God, it must be said, Ezek. 7. 5. <HI>An Evil, an only Evil, Behold, it is come.</HI> But this formidable <HI>Evil</HI> is <HI>Pur∣suing</HI> of you, O Unwary and Fool-hardy <HI>Sinners.</HI> Men do now say unto the Al∣mighty, <HI>Depart from us, we desire not the Knowledge of thy wayes:</HI> Therefore this Evil does <HI>Pursue</HI> the <HI>Sinners;</HI> That the Lord Jesus Christ will say unto them, <HI>Depart from me, I know ye not, ye workers of Iniquity.</HI> Men do now Refuse to come unto the Lord Jesus Christ, for His <HI>Blessing;</HI> This <HI>Evil</HI> does <HI>Pursue</HI> the <HI>Sinners,</HI> The Lord Jesus Christ will pro∣nounce this Doom upon them, <HI>Depart ye Cursed.</HI> Men are now as hot as <HI>Fire,</HI> in Thirsting and in Driving after the <HI>Pleasures <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sin;</HI> This <HI>Evil</HI> does <HI>Pursue</HI> the <HI>Sinners;</HI> They shall be cast into an Intolerable <HI>Fire</HI> and there Cry out▪ <HI>I am Tormented in this Flame!</HI> Men do
<PB N="17" REF="001175_0016_0FB0E1AD50CFAA48"/>
now <HI>Despise the pleasant Lord,</HI> and Kick against Heaven, and all the Glories, and the Offers of it; This <HI>Evil</HI> does <HI>Pursue</HI> the <HI>Sinners;</HI> They shall be cast into an <HI>Hell,</HI> where the <HI>Smoke of their Torment shall ascend for ever &amp; ever.</HI> Men do now hearken to the <HI>Devil,</HI> and Prefer &amp; Obey his Commands, doing the <HI>works of Darkness;</HI> This <HI>Evil</HI> does <HI>Pursue</HI> the <HI>Sin∣ners;</HI> They shall be Imprisoned in <HI>Utter Darkness,</HI> with the <HI>Devil and his Angels.</HI> Oh! Matchless <HI>Evil!</HI> To ly under Eter∣nal Impressions and Vexations, from the wrath of an Infinite God! Sinner, How canst thou bear the Thought of such an <HI>Evil!</HI> Secure Sinners will ask, How can the Minister prove, That there is in <HI>a∣nother World</HI> an <HI>Evil Pursuing</HI> of them? Prove it! Ah, Sinners, you your selves afford a <HI>Proof</HI> of it. You see, That <HI>Sinners</HI> often Oppress and Harass Innocent men, with <HI>Tortures</HI> that cannot be Paint∣ed out. <HI>Sinners</HI> have <HI>Racked,</HI> and <HI>Booted</HI> the Servants of God, and <HI>Burned</HI> them alive, and <HI>Broke</HI> them on the <HI>Wheel,</HI> &amp; <HI>Bastinado'd</HI> them to Death. Now, if there be a <HI>Just God,</HI> which the very <HI>De∣vils
<PB N="18" REF="001175_0017_0FB0E1AEB6727DE8"/>
Believe and Tre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e!</HI> These Bloody Sinners must themselves Endure as Grie∣vous things as ever they inflicted on the Servants of God. In <HI>this world,</HI> they do not Endure those things; they swim in all the Delights of the <HI>Louvre;</HI> they <HI>Live,</HI> they <HI>become Old,</HI> yea, they are <HI>mighty in Power;</HI> Their <HI>Off-spring also is Established before their Eyes.</HI> It follows then undeniably, That there is <HI>another World,</HI> wherein there is laid up for <HI>Sinners</HI> an <HI>Evil,</HI> more Hideous and Exqisite, than can be Expressed by the Tongue of any Mortal.</P>
<P>This, This is the <HI>Evil</HI> that <HI>Pursueth Sinners;</HI> This is <HI>the Heritage appointed unto them of God</HI></P>
<P>III. How does <HI>Evil pursue Sinners?</HI> We shall find something Observable in its <HI>Pursuing</HI> of them. The Notion of a <HI>Pur∣suit</HI> in the Case, is f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll of Instruction.</P>
<P>First, Evil Pursueth Sinners; It argues, that <HI>Evil</HI> does by <HI>Law</HI> belong to <HI>Sinners.</HI> To <HI>pursue Sinners,</HI> is to Prosecute them at Law. <HI>Sinners</HI> have broken the <HI>Law</HI> of God. By the <HI>Law</HI> of God, there is a <HI>Misery</HI> most justly belonging unto
<PB N="19" REF="001175_0018_0FB0E1B28A75D370"/>
them. That <HI>Misery</HI> is the <HI>Evil pursuing of them.</HI> Hence we are told, Joh. 3. 18 <HI>They are Condemned already.</HI> Sinners are obnoxious to <HI>Evil,</HI> by that <HI>Law,</HI> that is alwayes <HI>Holy &amp; Just &amp; Good;</HI> by that <HI>Law,</HI> that God will never balk, but for∣ever <HI>Magnify it, &amp; make it Honourable.</HI> How comes Evil to <HI>pursue Sinners?</HI> Tru∣ly, Sinners are <HI>Condemned</HI> unto Evil, by the <HI>Law</HI> of that God, of whom it is Ac∣knowledged; Hab. 1. 13. <HI>Thou art of purer Eyes than to behold Evil.</HI> There will be a most <HI>spotless Justice</HI> in all the <HI>Evil,</HI> that shall come upon <HI>Sinners;</HI> They cannot justly Complain of any <HI>Evil</HI> that shall come upon them: <HI>Why should a Sin∣ful man Complain? A Sinner for the punish∣ment of his Sin?</HI> Think, O Sinners, Think with your selves; <HI>O wretched man that I am; The Law of the Righte∣ous God has Condemned me to Dy.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. Evil Pursueth Sinners; And what are <HI>Sinners</HI> then, but <HI>Run∣awayes,</HI> but <HI>Malefactors! Pursued</HI> Folks are supposed such. It seems, that Sin∣ners have an <HI>Hue-in-Cry</HI> after them! Sinners are bound unto the <HI>Service</HI> of
<PB N="20" REF="001175_0019_0FB0E1B4B85422B0"/>
God: They are in most indispensable Bonds to be the <HI>Servants</HI> of the Lord Je∣sus Christ. But what? They come to that vile Resolution; Psal. 2. 3. <HI>Let us cast the Cords▪ from us.</HI> They refuse to serve the Lord; They will serve the World, the Flesh, the Devil; The Lord Jesus Christ is too good a Master for them. The <HI>Fugitives</HI> when they leave that Master, they fall into Ten Thousand Iniquities; They turn <HI>Robbers;</HI> They <HI>Rob</HI> the Great God of His Dues; They are <HI>Murderers, Traitors, Rebels;</HI> They break out into open <HI>Rebellion</HI> against the Great King of Heaven and Earth. Tis for these things, that the <HI>Hue-in-Cry</HI> is gone out after them, and <HI>Evil</HI> is <HI>Pur∣suing</HI> of them. We read of some, Job. 30. 5. <HI>They Cryed after them, as after a Theef.</HI> Sinner, so, Even so, art thou <HI>Cried after;</HI> The Destroying Judgments of God are <HI>Crying</HI> after thee.</P>
<P>Thirdly. Evil Pursueth Sinners; It shows, That tho' <HI>Sinners</HI> cannot al∣wayes escape <HI>Evil,</HI> yet they <HI>do</HI> for a while <HI>escape</HI> it; and they <HI>dream</HI> that they shall <HI>alwayes</HI> escape it. <HI>Evil</HI> is for a
<PB N="21" REF="001175_0020_0FB0E1B64C07D968"/>
while, it seems only upon the <HI>Pur∣suit</HI> of Sinners; it has not yet <HI>Over∣taken them.</HI> We read, Eccl. 8. 11 <HI>Sen∣tence against an Evil work, is not Executed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eedily.</HI> And wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le Sinners are yet on∣ly <HI>Pursued</HI> of <HI>Evil,</HI> Oh! the Security of the Silly ones! They fondly and vainly fancy, that <HI>Evil</HI> shall never overtake them. A most unreasonable Fancy! <HI>De∣lay</HI> is no <HI>Payment.</HI> Sinners, it must be said unto you, as it was said unto them of old; Num. 32. 23. <HI>Behold, ye have sinned against the Lord; &amp; be sure your sin will find you out.</HI> Your Sin; that is to say, the Punishment of your Sin: This is like a <HI>Blood-hound</HI> upon the Scent, swiftly pursuing of you; 'Twill come up with you, Be <HI>Sure</HI> of it! Be <HI>Sure</HI> of it! Sometimes a Remarkable <HI>Evil</HI> does <HI>Over∣take</HI> the Sinner before he Dies. There are some Sins, that seldome go unpunished in <HI>this Life.</HI> Gross <HI>Wrongs</HI> to our Neigh∣bours, are in <HI>this Life</HI> usually paid home unto us. <HI>Cheaters</HI> find it so; <HI>Robbers</HI> find it so; <HI>Oppressors</HI> find it so; and so do <HI>Relatives</HI> that carry it unkindly to one another. And, I wish, that People, whose
<PB N="22" REF="001175_0021_0FB0E1B7B53F0310"/>
Conversation is full of <HI>Reproaches,</HI> or <HI>Invectives</HI> against other People would consider of it. <HI>Abusive</HI> People are not only Chastised, by strange Accidents, that bring all their base Talk to the Ears of the Innocent persons, whom they have abused, but also the Hand of God so orders it, that they shall be overtaken and overwhelmed, with as heavy loads of Obloquy. <HI>Consider this, O ye Tongues, whom she Fear of God bridles not; &amp; be afraid of</HI> Sinning <HI>as you use to▪ do!</HI> Again, There are atrocious <HI>Crimes,</HI> the <HI>Crimes</HI> which the Bible calls, <HI>The Crying ones;</HI> those <HI>Crimes</HI> do in <HI>this Life</HI> usually meet with the Vengeance of God. Men that are <HI>Wicked overmuch,</HI> what becomes of them? Oftentimes, they don't <HI>live out half their Dayes;</HI> oftentimes God brands them with marks of His Vengeauce while they <HI>Live.</HI> The <HI>Barbarians</HI> themselves could expect it concerning Barbarous <HI>Murderers,</HI> That Vengeance would not suffer them to live. But be sure, At his <HI>Death,</HI> Then, Then a Sinner shall be overtaken with E<HI>vil</HI> unto the uttermost. Then will the Sinner feel the fulfilment
<PB N="23" REF="001175_0022_0FB0E1BB648359E0"/>
of that word; Job 27. 22. <HI>God shall cast Plagues upon him, &amp; not spare; tho' he would sain flee out of His Hand.</HI> Oh! what would the Sinner then give, that he could <HI>flee</HI> from the dreadful Hand of God! But, Sinner, The threatned Evil is now come, it is now come! There is no Fleeing from it! The Rocks can∣not hide thee; The Mountains cannot cover thee from the Wrath of God; <HI>Tho' they di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> into Hall, thence my Hand shall take them; tho' they climb up to Heaven, thence! will bring them down; tho' they hide themselves from my sight in the Bottom of the Sea!</HI> [Have not our Pirates found it so? <HI>wherever they hide themselves, I will search &amp; sieze them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Finally. Evil Pursueth Sinners; It is hinted, That it shall be a <HI>Retaliating Evil.</HI> A Sinner being one that <HI>pursues Moral</HI> E<HI>vil,</HI> tis but a <HI>Retaliation,</HI> that he should be <HI>pursued of</HI> E<HI>vil:</HI> And there is oftentimes a most Notable <HI>Retaliation</HI> in the very Kind of the E<HI>vil.</HI> The hint is further given in the next Clause; <HI>To the Righteous, Good shall be repaid.</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="001175_0023_0FB0E1BD082E44D0"/>
Even so, In the Evil that pursues th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Sinner, there shall be a <HI>Repaiment;</HI> Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Sinner shall be Repaid in his own Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. They that would have thrown <HI>Daniel</HI> to the <HI>Lions,</HI> are themselves thrown to the <HI>Lions.</HI> They that cast the <HI>Israelites</HI> into the <HI>River,</HI> are themselves cast into the <HI>Sea.

The Field is large; I must not now Ex∣patiate. A sinner shall see some surpri∣zing Circumstance, either in the <HI>Sort,</HI> or in the <HI>Place,</HI> or in the <HI>Time,</HI> or in the <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>strument</HI> of his Punishment, that shall make him with Surprize and Hor∣ror Cry out, like him; Judg. 1. 7. <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I have done, so God hath Requited me.</HI> Briefly, When Evil falls upon the Sin∣ner, it shall be with such Victorious De∣monstrations of Equity in the Glorious God, that all Heaven and Earth shall say, <HI>The</HI> Sinner <HI>is fairly dealt withal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪</HI> The Sinner himself shall Cry out, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Emperour <HI>Mauritius</HI> did, when h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>And,</P>
<P>I. Who are most nearly concerned in the <HI>Application</HI> of these things, but Sin∣ners? Let Sinners then be in the first place Examined &amp; Characterized. When we see such a black and a dense Cloud, charged with hot Thunderbolts, gathering <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver our Heads in this Word of God, Evil Pursueth Sinners; methinks, we should all stand trembling before the Lord, and Crying out with him, Joh. 13. 15.

<P>Sirs, If you meet with one who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> never yet felt <HI>Sin</HI> as the <HI>Greatest Evil,</HI> &amp; priz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <HI>Salvation frrom Sin</HI> as the <HI>Greatest Good;</HI> If you meet with one, who can Sin in <HI>Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sser Miscarriages,</HI> without <HI>Re∣luctance,</HI> and can go on in Sin without <HI>Repentance;</HI> If you meet with one who never yet by Faith carried a Soul distressed with Sin, unto the Lord Jesus Christ, for Deliverance out of its Distresses; This This is a Sinner! <HI>Ah!

<P>II. What is the most pertinent <HI>Appli∣cation</HI> to be made unto <HI>Pursued Sinners?</HI> It may pertinently enough turn upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> very pungent Questions.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="question">
<HEAD>The First Question.</HEAD>
<P>Sinners, <HI>What are you doing?</HI> Alas, you are bringing of <HI>Evil,</HI> much <HI>Evil,</HI> sad <HI>Evil,</HI> upon your selves. It may be said unto the Sinner, as Hab. 2. 10. <HI>Thou hast sinned against thy own Soul.</HI> And it may be said, <HI>Thou art by Sin bringing Evil upon
<PB N="28" REF="001175_0027_0FB0E1C677A84698"/>
all thy Interests.</HI> Oh! Take the Warning of God!</P>
<P>First; Be assured, O Sinners, you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not find any <HI>Good</HI> in <HI>Sin.</HI> Sin, Tis no∣thing but <HI>Evil.</HI> Sin. It will bring all <HI>Evil.</HI> The works of Sin, they are <HI>Un∣fruitful works.</HI> Tis an Appeal we may make to all the Sinners in the world Rom. 6. 22. <HI>What fruit have you had?</HI> All Deceived Sinner, Dost thou please thy self, as if thou were't <HI>Pursuing of Good▪</HI> Those <HI>Pleasures</HI> are not <HI>Good;</HI> They de∣bauch, they betray thy Soul into inter∣minable <HI>Torments.</HI> All this while, <HI>Evil</HI> is <HI>Pursuing</HI> of thee.

<P>And then, Serondly; Be assured O Sinners, you have no Reason to be Merry, or Easy, or Sleepy, in a state of <HI>Sin.</HI> You

behave your selves, as if nothing were Amiss. What? When there is <HI>Evil pur∣suing</HI> of you! It was among the sighs which a poor man once poured out before the Lord; Job 13. 26, 27. <HI>Thou writest bitter things against me; Thou lookest narrowly to all my Pathes; Thou settest a Print upon the Heels of my Feet.</HI> Even of such <HI>Bitter Things</HI> may a <HI>Sinner</HI> make a Soliloquy un∣to his own Soul.</P>

<P>Shall we begin, with the mention of that, which is the usual Beginning of all Wickedness? That is to say, Sabbath-breaking.

<P>Don't sleight these Warnings of God.

The man derided a <HI>God,</HI> an <HI>Heaven,</HI> an <HI>Hell,</HI> and all <HI>Religion.</HI> He became guilty of <HI>Stealing,</HI> and was Condemned to Dy for his <HI>Felony.</HI> The Godly Ministers could not Recover him from his <HI>Atheism.</HI> His <HI>Atheism</HI> accom∣panied him to the very Gallows.

Here was a while ago a Person in our Prison, who was the Son of a Reverend and an Eminent Minister, who Dyed for his Re∣ligion.

He was not <HI>Hanged for Re∣ligion;</HI> he was <HI>Hanged</HI> for <HI>Piracy,</HI> and for <HI>Murder!</HI> He was <HI>Twice Hanged,</HI> before his Execution could be accomplished; &amp; he was <HI>Hanged a Third time,</HI> in <HI>Chains,</HI> where Thousands daily behold the Spectacle.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sinners Pursued of Evil,</HI> may <HI>Laugh</HI> and <HI>Scoff</HI> at these things; and perhaps the Preacher may be derided for his <HI>Telling Stories in the Pulpit.</HI> Sinners, I wish that you don't prove some of the <HI>Stories.</HI> I am Credibly informed, That a principal Person among the <HI>Pirates</HI> now going to Dy, upon the Gallows, was in one of his former Voyages, Flouting and Railing a∣gainst a <HI>Minister</HI> in this place, who had never deserved it. And a more con∣siderate man then present, Rebuked him for it; but in his Rebuke Expressed his Thought, how it would be when he should have occasion for that very <HI>Minister</HI> to speak with him. You shall however be told one more, and I will at present have done with you.

The wretch goes out of the Church; and as he went out, a Tyle fell from the house that Killed him on the spot. Alas, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>worse Evil</HI> will <HI>Pursue,</HI> them that mock a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Warnings of God.</P>
<P>These Faithful Warnings against <HI>Sin,</HI> how can I better terminate them, than with the Dying words of a Malefactor, who Dyed a very Memorable and Exemplary Penitent! His words were to this purpose. <Q>Oh! That all People would be warned to beware of the Beginnings of Sin. When I was first Enticed into Evil, I was Tender and Fearful of it; but I did not hearken diligently to the Word of God, nor to the Voice of Conscience that checked me; I went on; <HI>By de∣grees</HI> I was Emboldened in Sin; At last, it became as familiar as my daily Food. Oh! As you love your Souls, <HI>Take heed of the Beginnings of Sin.</HI> Oh That I

<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="question">
<HEAD>The Second Question.</HEAD>
<P>Sinners, <HI>What will you do? Evil</HI> is <HI>Pursuing</HI> of you, even of as many of you, as are yet in your <HI>Unregeneracy.</HI> And,</P>
<P>First; You cannot <HI>Avoid</HI> the <HI>Evil.</HI> Which way, I marvel, which way can you propose to <HI>Avoid</HI> it? Will you <HI>Abscond?</HI> No; That cannot be done. You are ad∣vised; Psal. 139. 7. <HI>Lord, whither shall I flee from thy presence?</HI> Will you <HI>Resist?</HI> No; That cannot be done. You are ad∣vised; Ezek. 22. 14. <HI>Can thine Heart en∣dure, or can thy Hands be strong, in the Day that I shall deal with thee, saith the Lord.</HI> Or, will you <HI>Run</HI> so fast, that the <HI>Pursuer</HI> cannot come up with you? No, No; He has told you, Mal. 3. 5. <HI>I will be a swift Witness against them, that fear not me, saith the Lord of Hosts.</HI></P>
<P>And then, Secondly; You cannot <HI>En∣dure</HI> the <HI>Evil:</HI> Tis <HI>Intolerable!</HI> Tis <HI>In∣tolerable!</HI> It is Cryed out, Prov. 18. 14. <HI>A wounded spirit, who can bear?</HI> When a few Drops of that <HI>Evil,</HI> which is impen∣ding
<PB N="44" REF="001175_0043_0FB0E1EF60C35440"/>
over you, has fallen on a Soul, a <HI>Wounded Spirit</HI> has been the Effect of it. But that <HI>Wounded Spirit</HI> has made the Mi∣serables Cry out with <HI>Cain, My Punish∣ment is greater than I can bear!</HI> We have known some Languishing under a <HI>wounded Spirit</HI> among our selves; and they have kept Shrieking out, <HI>Oh! I am all on Fire under the Wrath of God! I am on a light Fire under the Wrath of God.</HI> And then, they have actually made <HI>Choice of Strang∣ling rather than Life.</HI> What then will i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be, to Ly among the Damned in the <HI>place of Dragons?</HI> Full of Consternation is that Advice; Heb. 10. 31. <HI>It is a fearful thing to fall into the Hands of the Living God!</HI> One that lay under the Terrors of God upon his <HI>Wounded Spirit,</HI> heard some Talk, about the <HI>Fire,</HI> and about being Roasted in the <HI>Fire,</HI> &amp; he fearfully Roared out; <HI>Oh! All of this is but a Metaphor, to what I do feel!</HI> Sinner, wilt thou venture on? Thou art falling down into an <HI>Evil,</HI> to which the most <HI>Fiery Tortures,</HI> are but a <HI>Metaphor!</HI> It was Exclamed of old; Psal 76. 7. <HI>O God, who may stand in thy sight, when once thou art Angry?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="001175_0044_0FB0FCEB7052ED08"/>
Come then; There is this to be done, O Sinners, That the <HI>Evil</HI> which <HI>Pursues</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may not come at you. Fly, O Fly, unto the City of Refuge. [See Heb. 6. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>8.] It is the Lord JESUS CHRIST, who is the Only <HI>Refuge</HI> for a Soul <HI>Pursued of Evil.</HI> Oh! Let a <HI>Pursued Soul</HI> makes its <HI>Flight</HI> into Him, and unto the Mercy of God in Him.</P>
<P>As it was said, Josh. 2. 16. <HI>Get you to the Mountain, lest the Pursuers meet you.</HI> Even so, I say, Get you to the Lord JE∣SUS CHRIST, that so the <HI>Pursuers</HI> may not come at you. Repair by Faith, unto that <HI>Hiding place;</HI> Repair Immediately; O Delay not, O Dally not; I must hasten you, as the Angel did <HI>Lot; Arise, Make hast, lest thou be Consumed.</HI></P>
<P>The Great Thing to be demanded of you is, That you give the Consent of your Souls, to be found in the Lord JE∣SUS CHRIST; Or, Consent, most Wil∣lingly, Heartily, Joyfully, to be the Lords. How, How shall this Point be gained? When the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God came upon <HI>Ama∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i,</HI> 1 Chron. 12. 18.] he Cryed out, <HI>Thine are we, O</HI> David, <HI>and on thy side, thou
<PB N="46" REF="001175_0045_0FB0FCED07074930"/>
Son of</HI> Jesse. Might the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God come upon our Hearers, we should so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> have that Cry going up to Heaven from them, <HI>Thine are we, O Jesus, &amp; for the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Thou Son of God.</HI> Oh! That the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God; and of Grace, would th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Operate upon us! Then, Then, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> should be no longer Pursued of Evil.</P>
<P>To Conclude;</P>
<P>It may justly be Expected, That we should all Endeavour to Improve wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we behold of Evil Pursuing Sinners in the surprizing Instances, which by the Providence of God, are newly fallen out among our selves.</P>
<P>There has been a Time, when some have come and Seduced and Enchanted several of our Young Men, to <HI>Piratical</HI> Courses; and there were some Unhap∣py Advantages, which the Sinners took, to shelter themselves in the Prosecution of their <HI>Piracies.</HI> But the Government of <HI>New-England</HI> will by a severe Proce∣dure of Justice, forever make it an Un∣just thing, to Reflect on the Countrey, as if such dangerous Criminals might hope ever to be safely Nested here.</P>
