<P>Mr. CHAIRMAN,</P>
<P>I heartily thank this respectable Assembly for the honour they have conferred upon me, but want words to express the sense I feel of their kindness. The mere accidents of meeting with particular books, and conversing with particular men, led me into the train of sentiments, which the committee are pleased to think just; and others, with the like opportunities of informa∣tion would much better have deserved to receive the thanks, they now generously give. I consider the approbation of this company as an evidence, that they entertain a favourable opini∣on of my good intentions, and as an encouragement for all to apply themselves, in these unhappy times, to the service of the public, since even small endeavours to promote that service, can find a very valuable reward. I will try, during the remainder of my life, to remember my duty to our common country, and, if it be possible, to render myself worthy of the honour for which I now stand so deeply indebted.</P>
<P>I thank you, Sir, for the polite and affectionate manner, in which you have communicated the sense of the committee to me.</P></NOTE> of this committee be given from the chair to JOHN DICKINSON, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> for the great assistance they have derived from the laudable application of his eminent abilities to the service of his country in the above performance.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the committee for pre∣paring a draught of instruc∣tions was appointed, it was consider∣ed, whether it would not be proper, to form some kind of a sketch, however imperfect it might be, of all the grievances of the colonies, and of course of their constitutional rights.</P>
<P>SUCH an attempt, tho' very rude, might be improved by better hands; and it seemed absolutely necessary, no longer to consine ourselves to occa∣sional complaints and partial reme∣dies, but, if possible, to attain some degree of certainty concerning our lives, liberties and properties.</P>
<P>IT was perceived, that if the instruc∣tions should be formed on this plan, they would comprehend many and ve∣ry
<PB N="vi" REF="013247_0005_0F90435288F01DD0"/>
important positions, which it would be proper to introduce, by previously assigning the reasons, on which they were founded. Otherwise, the posi∣tions might not appear to the com∣mittee to be just. From this consi∣deration it became necessary, to ren∣der the instructions long and argu∣mentative; and whoever candidly reflects on the importance of the oc∣casion, will think such a method very justifiable.</P>
<P>THE draught of instructions being brought into the provincial commit∣tee and read, and no objection being made to any of the principles asserted in them, it was not thought necessary, that the argumentative part should continue any longer in them. The committee, that brought in the draught, therefore moved, that this part of the instructions might be se∣parated from the rest. Whereupon the draught was re committed, for this purpose, to the committee, that brought it in. This was done.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="013247_0006_0F9043534D0B4B60"/>
SEVERAL additions have been made to the other part, now called "An Essay," &amp;c. since the vote for pub∣lishing. The additions are distinguish∣ed by crotchets, thus [ ] and in these it was not thought necessary to observe the stile of instructions. The notes have been almost entirely ad∣ded since the vote.</P>

THOMAS WILLING, Chairman.</P>
<P>CHARLES THOMSON, Clerk.</P>
<P>AGREED that, in case of any difference in sentiment, the question be determined by the deputies voting by counties.</P>
<P>THE letters from <HI>Boston</HI> of the 13th of <HI>May</HI> were then read, and a short account given of the steps taken in consequence thereof, and the measures now pursuing in this and the neigh∣bouring provinces; after which the following. RESOLVES were passed.</P>
<P>UNAN. 1. THAT we acknowledge ourselves, and the inhabitants of this pro∣vince, liege subjects of his majesty king <HI>George</HI> the third, to whom they and we ow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and will bear true and faithful allegiance.</P>
<P>UNAN. II. That as the idea of an uncon∣stitutional independence on the parent state is, utterly abhorrent to our principles, we view the unhappy differences between <HI>Great Britain</HI> and the Colonies with the deepest distress and anx∣iety of mind, as fruitless to her, grievous to us, and destructive of the best interests of both.</P>
<P>UNAN. III, That it is therefore our ardent desire, that our ancient harmony with the mo∣ther
<PB N="4" REF="013247_0010_0F904356490D5A30"/>
ther country should be restored, and a perpe∣tual love and union subsist between us, on the principles of the constitution, and an inter∣change of good offices, without the least in∣fraction of our mutual rights.</P>
<P>UNAN. IV. That the inhabitants of these colonies are entitled to the same rights and li∣berties WITHIN these colonies, that the subjects born in <HI>England</HI> are entitled to WITHIN that realm.</P>
<P>UNAN. V. That the power assumed by the parliament of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> to bind the people of these colonies, "by statutes IN ALL CASES WHATSOEVER," is unconstitutional; and there∣fore the source of these unhappy differences.</P>
<P>UNAN. VI. That the act of parliament, for shutting up the port of <HI>Boston,</HI> is unconsti∣tutional; oppressive to the inhabitants of that town; dangerous to the liberties of the <HI>British</HI> colonies; and therefore, that we consider our brethren at <HI>Boston</HI> as suffering in the common cause of these colonies.</P>
<P>UNAN. VII. That the bill for altering the administration of justice in certain criminal cases within the province of <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> if passed into an act of parliament, will be as unconstitutional, oppressive and dangerous, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the act above-mentioned.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="013247_0011_0F90435708530310"/>
UNAN. VIII. That the bill for changing the constitution of the province of <HI>Massachusetts Bay,</HI> established by charter, and enjoyed since the grant of that charter, if passed into an act of parliament, will be unconstitutional and dan∣gerous in its consequences to the <HI>American</HI> co∣lonies.</P>
<P>UNAN. IX. That there is an absolute ne∣cessity, that a congress of deputies from the several colonies be immediately assembled, to consult together, and form a general plan of conduct to be observed by all the colonies, for the purposes of procuring relief for our suffer∣ing brethren, obtaining redress of our griev∣ances, preventing future dissensions, firmly establishing our right, and restoring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>armony between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and her colonies on a constitutional foundation.</P>
<P>UNAN. X. That, although a suspension of the commerce of this large tra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing province, with <HI>Great Britain,</HI> would greatly distress mul∣titudes of our industrious inhabitants, yet that sacrifice and a much greater we are ready to offer for the preservation of our liberties; but, in tenderness to the people of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> as well as of this country, and in hopes that our just remonstrances will▪ at length, reach the
<PB N="6" REF="013247_0012_0F904357DB33BEC0"/>
ears of our gracious sovereign and be no longer treated with contempt by any of our fellow subjects in <HI>England,</HI> it is our earnest desire, that the congress should first try the gentler mode of stating our grievances, and making a firm and decent claim of redress.</P>
<P N="11"> XI. RESOLVED, by a great majority, That yet nothwithstanding, as an unanimity of coun∣sels and measures is indispensably necessary for the common welfare, if the congress shall judge agreements of non-importation and non ex∣portation expedient, the people of this province will join with the other principal and neighbour∣ing colonies, in such an association of non-im∣portation from and non-exportation to <HI>Great-Britain</HI> as shall be agreed on, at the congress.</P>
<P N="12">XII. RESOLVED, by a majority, That if any proceedings of the parliament, of which notice shall be received, on this continent, be∣fore or at the general congress, shall render it necessary in the opinion of that congress, for the colonies to take farther steps than are men∣tioned in the <HI>eleventh</HI> resolve; in such case, the inhabitants of this province shall adopt such farther steps, and do all in their power to carry them into execution.</P>
<P>UNAN. XIII. That the venders of mer∣chandize of every kind; within this province,
<PB N="7" REF="013247_0013_0F90435879AB1B78"/>
ought not to take advantage of the resolves relating to non-importation in this province or else where; but that they ought to sell their merchandize, which they now have, or may hereafter import, at the same rates they have been accustomed to do within three months last past.</P>
<P>UNAN. XIV. That the people of this pro∣vince will break off all trade, commerce, and dealing, and will have no trade, commerce, or dealing of any kind with any colony on this continent, or with any city or town in such colony, or with any individual in any such co∣lony, city, or town, which shall refuse, de∣cline, or neglect to adopt, and carry into exe∣cution such general plan as shall be agreed to in congress.</P>
<P>UNAN. XV. That it is the duty of every member of this committee to promote, as much as he can, the subscription set on foot, in the several counties of this province, for the relief of the distressed inhabitants of <HI>Boston.</HI></P>
<P>UNAN. XVI. That this committee give instructions on the present situation of public affairs to their representatives, who are to meet next week in Assembly, and request them to appoint a proper number of persons to attend a congress of deputies from the several colo∣nies,
<PB N="8" REF="013247_0014_0F90435D43E3D598"/>
at such time and place as may be agreed on, to effect one general plan of conduct, for attaining the great and important ends men∣tioned in the <HI>ninth</HI> resolve.</P>

<HEAD>INSTRUCTIONS From the COMMITTEE to the REPRE∣SENTATIVES in ASSEMBLY met.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE dissensions between <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and her colonies, on this continent, com∣mencing about ten years ago, since continually encreasing, and at length grown to such an excess as to involve the latter in deep distress and danger, have excited the good people of this province to take into their serious consi∣deration the present situation of public affairs.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants of the several counties qua∣lified to vote at elections, being assembled on due notice, have appointed us their deputies; and in consequence thereof, we being in pro∣vincial committee met, esteem it our indispen∣sible duty, in pursuance of the trust reposed in us, to give you such instructions, as, at this important period, appear to us to be proper.</P>
<P>WE, speaking in their names and our own, acknowledge ourselves liege subjects of his ma∣jesty king <HI>George</HI> the <HI>third,</HI> to whom "we will be faithful and bear true allegiance."</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="013247_0016_0F90436034FE92F8"/>
OUR judgments and affections attach us, with inviolable loyalty, to his majesty's person, family and government.</P>
<P>WE acknowledge the prerogatives of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he so∣vereign, among which are included the great powers of making peace and war, treaties, leagues an alliances <HI>binding us</HI>—of appointing all officers, except in cases where other provi∣sion is made, by grants from the crown, or laws approved by the crown—of confirming or annulling every act of our assembly within the allowed time—and of hearing and deter∣mining finally, in council, appeals from our courts of justice. "The prerogatives are li∣mited,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Blackstone</HI> 237</NOTE> as a learned judge observes, "by bounds so certain and notorious, that it is im∣possible to exceed them, without the consent of the people on the one hand, or without, on the other, a violation of that <HI>original contract,</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><P>And though we are strangers to the original of most states, yet we must not imagine that what has been here said, concerning the manner in which civil societies are formed, is an arbitrary fiction. For since it is certain, that all civil societies had a beginning, it is impossible to con∣ceive, how the members, of which they are composed, could unite to live together dependent on a supreme autho∣rity, without supposing the covenants abovementioned. <BIBL>BURLEMAQUI'S <HI>Princ. of pol. law, vol.</HI> 2. <HI>p.</HI> 29.</BIBL></P>
<P>And in fact, upon considering the primitive state of man, it appears most certain, that the appellations of sovereigns and subjects, masters and slaves, are unknown to nature.
<PB N="11" REF="013247_0017_0F90360DBBF9B70"/>

Nature has made us all of the same species, all equal, all free and independent of each other; and was willing that those, on whom she has bestowed the same faculties, should have all the same rights. It is therefore beyond all doubt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this primitive state of nature, no man has of himself an original right of commanding others, or any title to so∣vereignty.</P>
<P>There is none but God alone that has of himself, and in consequence of his nature and perfections, a natural, essen∣tial, and inherent right of giving laws to mankind, and of exercising an absolute sovereignty over them. The case is otherwise between man and man, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of their own na∣ture as independent of one another, as they are dependent on God. This liberty and independence is therefore a right naturally belonging to man, of which it would be unjust to deprive him against his will.<BIBL> <HI>Id. p.</HI> 38.</BIBL></P>
<P>There is a beautiful passage of <HI> Cicero's</HI> to this purpose.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nihil <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st illi principi Deo, qui omnem hunc mundum regit, quod quidem in terris f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at acceptius, quam consilia coetusque homi∣num jure sociati, quae civitates appellantur. <HI>Somn. S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ip</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 3.</NOTE> <HI>Nothing is more agreeable to the supreme Deity, that governs this universe, than civil societies lawfully established.</HI></P>
<P>When therefore we give to sovereigns the title of God's vicegerents upon earth, this does not imply that they de∣rive their authority immediately from God, but it signifies only, that by means of the power lodged in their hands, and with which the people have i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vested them, they main∣tain, agreeable to the views of the Deity, both order and peace, and thus procure the happiness of mankind. <BIBL><HI>Id. p.</HI> 40.</BIBL></P>
<PB N="12" REF="013247_0018_0F904362586BFBD0"/>

<P>But it will be here objected, that the scripture itself says, that every man ought to be subject to the supreme powers, because they are established by God<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiii.</NOTE>. I answer, with <HI>Gro∣tius,</HI> that men have established civil societies, not in conse∣quence of a divine ordinance, but of their voluntary mo∣tion, induced to it by the experience they had had of the incapacity which separate families were under, of defending themselves against the insults and attacks of human violence. From thence (he adds) arises the civil power, which <HI>St. Peter,</HI> for this reason, calls <HI>a human</HI> power,<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">i. Ep. c. 2. v. 13.</NOTE> though in other parts of scripture it bears the name of a divine insti∣tution<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>, because God has approved of it as an establish∣ment useful to mankind<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Grotius of the right of war &amp; peace, b. I. c. 4 § 7, 12. No. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE>.</P>
<P>All the other arguments, in favour of the opinion we have been here refuting, do not even deserve our notice. In general, it may be observed, that never were more wretched reasons produced than upon this subject, as the reader may be easily convinced by reading <HI>Pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>endorf</HI> on the law of nature and nations, who, in the chapter correspond∣ing to this, gives these arguments at length, and com∣pleatly refute<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">See the law of nature and nations, book VII. c. 3. </NOTE>. <BIBL><HI>Id. p.</HI> 42, 43.</BIBL></P></NOTE>

which, in all states impliedly, and in ours most expressly, subsists between the prince and sub∣ject.—For these prerogatives are vested in the crown <HI>for the support of society,</HI> and do not in∣trench

<P>BUT it is our misfortune, that we are com∣pelled loudly to call your attention to the con∣sideration of another power, totally different in kind—limited, as it is alledged, by no "bounds," and<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Blackstone</HI> 270.</NOTE> "wearing a most dreadful aspect," with regard to <HI>America.</HI> We mean
<PB N="13" REF="013247_0019_0F904363181E31C0"/>

<P>"IN ALL CASES WHATSOEVER"—a power, as we <HI>are not,</HI> and, from local circumstances, <HI>can∣not</HI> be represented there, utterly subversive of our natural and civil liberties—past events and reason convincing us, that there never ex∣isted, and never can exist, a state <HI>thus</HI> subordi∣nate to another, and yet retaining the slightest portion of freedom or happiness.</P>

<P>THIS power claimed by <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and the late attempts to exercise it over these colo∣nies, present to our view two events, one of which must <HI>inevitably</HI> take place, if she shall continue to insist on her pretensions. Either, the colonists will sink from the rank of free∣men into the class of slaves, overwhelmed with all the miseries and vices, prov'd by the history of mankind to be inseparably annexed to that deplorable condition: Or, if they have sense and virtue enough to exert themselves in striving to avoid this perdition, they must be involved in an opposition dreadful even in contemplation.</P>

<HI>Honour, justice,</HI> and <HI>humanity</HI> call upon us to hold, and to transmit to our posterity, that li∣berty, which we received from our ancestors. It is not our duty to leave wealth to our chil∣dren: But it is our duty, to leave liberty to them. No infamy, iniquity, or cruelty, can exceed our own, if we, born and educated in a country of freedom, entitled to its blessings, and knowing their value, pusillanimously de∣serting the post assigned us by divine Provi∣dence, surrender succeeding generations to a con∣dition of wretchedness, from which no human efforts, in all probability, will be sufficient to extricate them; the experience of all states mournfully demonstrating to us, that when ar∣bitrary power has been established over them, even the wisest and bravest nations, that ever flourished, have, in a few years, degenerated into abject and wretched vassals.</P>
<P>So alarming are the measures already taken for laying the foundations of a despotic autho∣rity of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> over us, and with such art∣ful and incessant vigilence is the plan prosecuted, that unless the present generation can interrupt the work, <HI>while it is going forward,</HI> can it be imagined, that our children, debilitated by our imprudence and supineness, will be able to over∣throw, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <HI>when completed?</HI> Populous and pow∣erful as these Colonies may grow, they will still find arbitrary domination not only strengthening

<P>To us therefore it appears, at this alarming period, our duty to God, to our country, to ourselves, and to our posterity, to exert our ut∣most ability, in promoting and establishing har∣mony between <HI>Great Britain</HI> and these colonies, ON A CONSTITUTIONAL FOUNDATION.</P>
<P>FOR attaining this great and desirable end, we request you to appoint a proper number of persons to attend a congress of deputies from the several colonies, appointed, or to be ap∣pointed, by the representatives of the people of the colonies respectively in assembly, or convention, or by delegates chosen by the counties generally in the respective colonies, and met in provincial committee, at such time and place as shall be generally agreed on: And that the deputies from this province may be in∣duced and encouraged to concur in such mea∣sures, as may be devised for the common wel∣fare, we think it proper, particularly to inform you, how far, we apprehend, they will be sup∣ported in their conduct by their constituents.</P>

<P>THE assumed parliamentary power of internal legislation, and the power of regulating trade, as of late exercised, and designed to be exer∣cised, we are thoroughly convinced, will prove unfailing and plentiful sources of dissentions to our mother country and these colonies, unless some expedients can be adopted to render her secure of receiving from us every emolument, that can in justice and reason be expected, and us secure in our lives, properties, and an equi∣table share of commerce.</P>
<P>MOURNFULLY revolving in our minds the calamities, that, arising from these dissentions, will most probably fall on us and our children, we will now lay before you the particular points we request of you to procure, if possible, to be finally decided; and the measures that appear to us most likely to produce such a desirable pe∣riod of our distresses and dangers. We there∣fore desire of you—</P>
<P>FIRST. That the Deputies you appoint, may be instructed by you strenuously to exert themselves, at the ensuing Congress, to obtain a renunciation, on the part of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> of
<PB N="18" REF="013247_0024_0F904366B94E7C88"/>
all powers under the statute of the 35 of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, chapter the 2d—of all powers of internal legislation—of imposing taxes or duties internal or external—and of regulating trade, except with respect to any new articles of com∣merce, which the Colonies may hereafter raise, as silk, wine, &amp;c. reserving a right to carry these from one colony to another—a repeal of all statutes for quartering troops in the Colonies, or subjecting them to any expence on account of such troops—of all statutes imposing duties to be paid in the Colonies, that were passed at the accession of his present Majesty, or before this time; which ever period shall be judged most adviseable—of the statutes giving the courts of admiralty in the colonies greater power than courts of admiralty have in <HI>England</HI>—of the statutes of the 5th of <HI>George</HI> the se∣cond, chapter the 22d, and of the 23d of <HI>George</HI> the second, chapter the 29th—of the sta∣tute for shutting up the port of Boston—and of every other statute particularly affecting the pro∣vince of <HI>Massachusetts Bay,</HI> passed in the last session of Parliament.</P>
<P>IN case of obtaining these terms, it is our opi∣nion, that it will be reasonable for the colonies to engage their obedience to the acts of parlia∣ment, commonly called the acts of navigation,
<PB N="19" REF="013247_0025_0F904367B000B628"/>
and to every other act of parliament declared to have force, at this time, in these colonies, other than those above mentioned, and to confirm such statutes by acts of the several assemblies. It is also our opinion, that taking example from our mother country, in abolishing the "courts of wards and liveries, tenures in capite, and by knight's service, and purveyance," it will be reasonable for the colonies, in case of obtaining the terms before mentioned, to settle a certain annual revenue on his majesty, his heirs and successors, subject to the controul of parliament, and to satisfy all damages done to the <HI>East-India</HI> company.</P>
<P>THIS our idea of settling a revenue, arises from a sense of duty to our sovereign, and of esteem for our mother country. We know and have felt the benefits of a subordinate con∣nexion with her. We neither are so stupid as to be ignorant of them; nor so unjust as to de∣ny them. We have also experienced the plea∣sures of gratitude and love, as well as advan∣tages from that connexion. The impressions are not yet erased. We consider her circum∣stances with tender concern. We have not been wanting, when constitutionally called up∣on, to assist her to the utmost of our abilities; insomuch that she has judged it reasonable to
<PB N="20" REF="013247_0026_0F90436BD33C35A8"/>
make us recompences for our overstrained ex∣ertions: And we now think we ought to con∣tribute more than we do, to the alleviation of her burthens.</P>
<P>WHATEVER may be said of these proposals on either side of the <HI>Atlantic,</HI> this is not a time, either for timidity or rashness. We perfectly know, that the great cause now agitated, is to be conducted to a happy conclusion, only by that well tempered composition of counsels, which firmness, prudence, loyalty to our So∣vereign, respect to our parent State, and af∣fection to our native country, united must form.</P>
<P>By such a compact, <HI>Great-Britain</HI> will secure every benefit, that the parliamentary wisdom of ages has thought proper to attach to her. <HI>From her alone</HI> we shall continue to receive manufac∣tures. <HI>To her alone</HI> we shall continue to carry the <HI>vast multitude of enumerated articles</HI> of com∣merce, the exportation of which her policy has thought fit to <HI>confine to herself. With such parts of the world only,</HI> as she has appointed us to deal, we shall continue to deal; and <HI>such commodities only,</HI> as she has permitted us to bring from them, we shall continue to bring. The <HI>executive</HI> and <HI>controuling</HI> powers of the crown will retain their
<PB N="21" REF="013247_0027_0F90436DC4F99EE0"/>
present full force and operation. We shall con∣tentedly labour for her as affectionate <HI>friends,</HI> in time of tranquility; and cheerfully spend for her, as dutiful <HI>children,</HI> our treasure and our blood, in time of war. She will receive a <HI>certain income</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The train of Officers, employed by <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> consume a very large part of what she takes from us. She therefore increases our distresses to make up for that con∣sumption. They will hereafter grow more and more op∣pressive, we more and more uneasy, she more and more dis∣turbed. We could raise an equal sum in a much more <HI>easy, equal,</HI> and <HI>cheap</HI> manner, than she can do. The attention of small states extends much more efficaciously and beneficially to every part of the territories, than that of the administra∣tion of a vast empire. The representatives in assembly, WHO ARE TAXED, WHEN THE PEOPLE ARE TAXED, AND ACCOUNTABLE TO THEM, will have double motives to take care, that the <HI>raising</HI> money is managed in the best way. The House of Commons would not bear to examine <HI>every particular</HI> relating to the just taxation of <HI>every county</HI> on this continent, and to <HI>settle all the accounts fairly.</HI> If they could go through the immense labour, it would be impossible for them to do any other business▪ In short, by not doing it, they would be <HI>unjust;</HI> by doing it they would be <HI>useless.</HI> Equity and reason demonstrate that such a power belongs not to them. The same reasoning holds as to the <HI>application</HI> of money. We have had some remarkable instances on this continent some few years ago, of the crown being <HI>according to all the forms of business</HI> charged with articles, that never went to the use of the crown. These were <HI>perquisites,</HI> and who could be so puritanical as to blame the civil word. It is said, our barracks cost about £. 8000 of this money—and that the barracks at <HI>another place,</HI> not deserving a com∣parison
<PB N="22" REF="013247_0028_0F90436F23623658"/>

with ours, cost £. 40,000 sterling. We built our own, <HI>ourselves,</HI> and were as saving and careful as we could be, it may be supposed. If money is raised upon us by parlia∣ment; of one thousand pounds, taken out of our pockets, not one hundred, in all probability, will be usefully applied to the service of the crown. Deficiencies will ensue—they must be supplied—other acts are made—still others—till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Speech of Lord Camden. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> 78</NOTE> "<HI>unrepresented blades of grass,</HI>" too frequently and closely cut down and exposed to the burning heat of an unsetting Sun, ever "<HI>in its meridian,</HI>" perish to their deep∣est roots.</P>
<Q><P>There is not upon earth (says the excellent <HI>Gordon</HI>) a nation, which having had <HI>unaccountable</HI> magistrates, has not felt them to be crying and consuming mischiefs.

<P>That the business of most kingdoms has been ill man∣aged, proceeds from this; it imports the <HI>lower</HI> rank of men only, and the <HI>people</HI> (whose cries seldom reach the prince, till it is too late, and till all is past remedy) that matters should be <HI>frugally</HI> ordered, because taxes must

pardon of all his father's debts. Gross frauds in office found out. Then new officers and salaries set up as checks. The new prove as great knaves as the old, and form a scheme of collusion and mutual understanding. But the public pays for all, and the power of the court is strengthened.

The business of old offices transferred to new: but the profits of the old still kept up, though become sinecures▪ An old servant of the public retires upon a penson. He who suc∣ceeds him, by interest gets it continued to him. Another gets an addition to his salary, and then sells his place for a great deal more than it cost him, and so an additional load is laid on the public: for the addition must be continued, because the place was bought. An annual sum is granted by the public for a public use, as keeping up a harbour, or the like. A private man, by interest, gets a grant of the jobb; the public concern is neglected, and the public poc∣ket picked. Crown lands perpetually begged and given a∣way to strengthen the court interest. The crown constantly kept in debt, and parliament solicited to pay those debts oc∣casioned merely by the voracity of the court. Commanders of fleets order a superfluous quantity of stores. By collu∣sion between them and the store-masters, this supersluous quantity is sold again to the king, and the money sunk in their pockets. Sometimes the store-masters gave receipts for more than was received into the king's stores, and the

<P><HI>Secret service</HI> is a huge cloke thrown over an immense scene of corruption; and under this cloke we must not peep.

up in the prosperity of our mother country. Our union, founded on mutual compacts and mutual benefits, will be indissoluble, at least more firm, than an union perpetually disturbed by disputed rights and retorted injuries.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="013247_0032_0F9043720EAF3F30"/>
SECONDLY. If all the terms abovemention∣ed cannot be obtained, it is our opinion, that the measures adopted by the congress for our relief should <HI>never</HI> be <HI>relinquished</HI> or <HI>intermitted,</HI> until <HI>those</HI> relating to the troops,—internal le∣gislation,—imposition of taxes or duties here∣after,—the 35th of <HI>Henry</HI> the 8th, chapter the 2d,—the extension of admiralty courts,—the port of <HI>Boston</HI> and the province of <HI>Massachusetts Bay</HI> are obtained. Every modification or qua∣lification of <HI>these</HI> points, in our judgment should be inadmissible. To obtain them, we think it may be prudent to settle some revenue as above-mentioned, and to satisfy the <HI>East-India</HI> company.</P>
<P>THIRDLY. If neither of these plans should be agreed to, in congress, but some other of a similar nature shall be framed, though on the
<PB N="27" REF="013247_0033_0F904372D0A76D80"/>
terms of a revenue, and satisfaction to the <HI>East-India</HI> company, and though it shall be agreed by the congress to admit no modification or qualification in the terms they shall insist on, we desire your deputies may be instructed to concur with the other deputies in it; and we will accede to, and carry it into execution as far as we can.</P>
<P>FOURTHLY. As to the regulation of trade—we are of opinion, that by making some few a∣mendments, the commerce of the colonies might be settled on a firm establishment, ad∣vantageous to <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and them, requir∣ing and subject to no future alterations, with∣out mutual consent. We desire to have this point considered by the congress; and such measures taken, as they may judge proper.</P>
<P>IN order to obtain redress of our common grievances, we observe a general inclination a∣mong the colonies of entering into agreements of non-importation and non-exportation. We are fully convinced, that such agreements would withhold very large supplies from <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and no words can describe our contempt and ab∣horrence of those colonists, if any such there are, who, from a fordid and ill-judged attach∣ment to their own immediate profit, would pursue that, to the injury of their country, in
<PB N="28" REF="013247_0034_0F9043738D2088E0"/>
this great struggle for all the blessings of liber∣ty. It would appear to us a most wasteful fru∣gality, that would lose every important posses∣sion by too strict, an attention to small things, and lose also even these at the last. For our part, we will cheerfully make any sacrifice, when necessary, to preserve the freedom of our coun∣try. But other considerations have weight with us. We wish every mark of respect to be paid to his majesty's administration. We have been taught from our youth to entertain tender and brotherly affections for our fellow subjects at home. The interruption of our commerce must distress great numbers of them. This we ear∣nestly desire to avoid. We therefore request, that the deputies you shall appoint may be in∣structed to exert themselves, at the congress, to induce the members of it, to consent to make a full and precise state of grievances and a de∣cent yet firm claim redress, and to wait the e∣vent, before any other step is taken. It is our opinion, that persons should be appointed and sent home to present this state and claim, at the court of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>IF the congress shall chuse to form agree∣ments of non-importation and non-exportation immediately, we desire the deputies from this province will endeavour to have them so formed
<PB N="29" REF="013247_0035_0F9043743853FBA0"/>
as to be binding upon all, and that they may be PERMANENT, should the public interest require it. They cannot be <HI>efficacious,</HI> unless they can be <HI>permanent;</HI> and it appears to us that there will be a danger of their being infringed, if they are not formed with great caution and delibera∣tion. We have determined in the present situa∣tion of public affairs to consent to a stoppage of our commerce with <HI>Great Britain</HI> only; but in case any proceedings of the parliament, of which notice shall be received on this continent, before or at the congress, shall render it necessary, in the opinion of the congress to take further steps, the inhabitants of this province will a∣dopt such steps, and do all in their power to carry them into execution.</P>
<P>THIS extensive power we commit to the con∣gress, for the sake of preserving that unanimity of counsel and conduct, that alone can work out the salvation of these colonies, with a strong hope and trust, that they will not draw this pro∣vince into any measure judged by us, who must be better acquainted with its state than strang∣ers, highly inexpedient. Of this kind, we know any other stoppage of trade, but of that with <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> will be. Even this step we should be extremely afflicted to see taken by the
<PB N="30" REF="013247_0036_0F9043750EA25A68"/>
congress, before the other mode above pointed out is tried. But should it be taken, we appre∣hend, that a plan of restrictions may be so framed, agreeable to the respective circum∣stances of the several colonies, as to render <HI>Great-Britain</HI> sensible of the imprudence of her counsels, and yet leave them a necessary com∣merce. And here it may not be improper to take notice, that if redress of our grievances cannot be wholly obtained, the extent or conti∣nuance of our restrictions may, in some sort, be proportioned to the rights we are contending for, and the degree of relief afforded us.

<P>THE authority of parliament has within these few years been a question much agi∣tated; and great difficulty, we understand, has occurred, in tracing the line between the rights of the mother country and those of the colonies. The modern doctrine of the former is indeed truly remarkable; for though it points out, what <HI>are not</HI> our rights, yet we can never learn from it, what <HI>are</HI> our rights. As for example—<HI>Great-Britain</HI> claims a right to take away nine-tenths of our estates—have we a <HI>right</HI> to the remaining tenth? No,—To say we have,

By no means. The words following those next above quoted from the "commentaries on the laws of <HI>England,</HI>" are—"unless where the con∣stitution hath <HI>expressly,</HI> or <HI>by</HI> EVIDENT CONSE∣QUENCE, laid down some <HI>exception</HI> or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>UNDARY: <HI>declaring,</HI> that thus far the prerogative shall go, and no farther." There are "some boundaries" then, besides the "express exceptions;" and according to the strong expression here used, "the constitution DECLARES there are." What "evident consequence" forms those "bounda∣ries?"</P>
<P>THE happiness of the people is the end, and, if the term is allowable, we would call it the body of the constitution. Freedom is the spirit or soul. As the soul, speaking of nature, has a right to prevent or relieve, if it can, any mis∣chief to the body of the individual, and to keep it in the best health; so the soul, speak∣ing of the constitution, has a right to prevent, or relieve, any mischief to the body of the so∣ciety, and to keep that in the best health. The "evident consequence" mentioned, must mean a tendency to injure this health, that is, to di∣minish the happiness of the people—or it must
<PB N="37" REF="013247_0043_0F90437DA3C9C610"/>
mean nothing. If therefore, the constitution "DECLARES <HI>by evident consequence;</HI>" that a tendency to diminish the happiness of the peo∣ple, is a proof, that power exceeds a "bounda∣ry," beyond which it ought not to "go;" the matter is brought to this single point, whether taking our money from us without our consent, depriving us of trial by jury, changing consti∣tutions of government, and abolishing the pri∣viledge of the writ of <HI>habeas corpus,</HI> by seizing and<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><P>"Of great importance to the public is the preserva∣tion of this personal liberty: for if once it were left in the power of any, the highest magistrate, to imprison <HI>arbitari∣ly,</HI> whomever he or <HI>his officers</HI> thought proper, (as in <HI>France</HI> it is daily practised by the crown) THERE WOULD SOON BE AN END OF ALL OTHER RIGHTS AND IMMUNITIES."—</P>
<P>"A natural and regular consequence of this personal liber∣ty is, that every <HI>Englishman</HI> may claim A RIGHT TO ADIDE IN HIS OWN COUNTRY SO LONG AS HE PLEASES, and not to be driven from it unless by the sentence of law. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or transportation is a punishment <HI>unknown to the common law.</HI>—"The King cannot constitute a man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> lieutenant of <HI>Ireland</HI> against his will▪ nor make him a foreign ambassa∣dor.

tendency to diminish our happiness, than any enormities a King can commit under pretence of prerogative, can have to diminish the happi∣ness of the subjects in <HI>England.</HI> To come to a decision upon this point, no long time need be required. To make this comparison, is stating the claim of parliament in the most favourable light: For it puts the <HI>assumed</HI> power of parlia∣ment, to do, "IN ALL CASES WHATSOEVER," <HI>what they please,</HI> upon the same footing with the <HI>acknowledged</HI> power of the King, "to make what peers—pardon what offences, &amp;c. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e pleases.</HI>" But in <HI>this</HI> light, that power is not entitled to be viewed. Such is the wisdom of the <HI>English</HI> constitution, that it "declares" the King may transgress a "boundary laid down by evident consequence," even by using <HI>the power</HI> with which he is <HI>expressly</HI> vested by the constitu∣tion, in doing <HI>those very acts</HI> which he is <HI>experss∣ly</HI> trusted by the constitution to do—as by cre∣ating too many or improper persons, peers; or by pardoning too many or too great offences, &amp;c. But has the constitution of ENGLAND <HI>ex∣pressly</HI> "declared," that the parliament of GREAT-BRITAIN may take away the money of ENGLISH colonists without their consent, and deprive them of tryal by ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, &amp;c? It cannot be pretended. True it is, that it has been so∣lemnly declared by <HI>parliament,</HI> that <HI>parliament has</HI> such a power. But that declaration leaves the point just as it was before: For if parlia∣ment
<PB N="39" REF="013247_0045_0F90437F8585BDF8"/>
had not the power before, the declaration could not give it. Indeed if parliament is really "omnipotent,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Blackstone, 161.</NOTE> that power is just and con∣stitutional. We further observe, that no <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> lawyer, as we remember, has pointed out precisely the line beyond which, if a king, shall "go," resistance becomes <HI>lawful.</HI> Gene∣ral terms have been used. The learned author of those commentaries, that notwithstanding some human frailties, do him so much honor, has thought proper, when treating of this sub∣ject, to point out the <HI>"precedent"</HI> of the revo∣lution, as fixing the line. We would not ven∣ture any reflexion on so great a man. It may not become us. Nor can we be provoked by his expressions concerning colonists; because they perhaps contain his real, though hasty sen∣timents. Surely, it was not his intention to condemn those excellent men, who casting eve∣ry tender consideration behind them, nobly presented themselves against the tyranny of the unfortunate and misguided <HI>Charles'</HI>s reign; those men, whom the house of commons, even after the restoration, would not suffer to be censured.</P>
<P>WE are sensible of the objection that may be made, as to drawing a line between rights on each side, and the case of a plain violation of rights. We think it not material▪ Circumstances have <HI>actually</HI> produced, and may again produce
<PB N="40" REF="013247_0046_0F9043805F152740"/>
this question.—What conduct of a prince ren∣ders resistance lawful? <HI>James</HI> the second and his father violated <HI>express rights of their subjects,</HI> by doing what <HI>their own express rights</HI> gave them no title to do, as by raising money, and levy∣ing troops, without consent of parliament. It is not even <HI>settled,</HI> what violation of those will justify resistance. But may not some future prince confining himself to the exercise of <HI>his own express rights,</HI> such as have been mentioned, act in a manner, that will be a transgression of a "boundary?" laid down by "evident conse∣quence," the "constitution <HI>de la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing</HI> he should go no further?" May not this exercise of these <HI>his express rights,</HI> be so far extended, as to intro∣duce <HI>universal confusion</HI> and a <HI>subversion of the ends of government?</HI> The whole may be oppres∣sive, and yet any single instance legal. The cases may be improbable; but we have seen and now feel events once as little expected. Is it not <HI>possible,</HI> that one of these cases <HI>may</HI> happen; If it <HI>does,</HI> has the constitution <HI>expressly</HI> drawn, a line, beyond which resistance becomes lawful? It has not. But it may be said, a king <HI>cannot arm</HI> against his subjects—he <HI>cannot raise money,</HI> without consent of parliament. This is the constitutional check upon him. If he should, it would be a violation of <HI>their express rights.</HI> If <HI>their purses</HI> are shut, <HI>his power</HI> shrinks. True. Unhappy colonists! Our money may be taken from us—and standing armies established over

us, without our consent—every <HI>expressly</HI> de∣clared constitutional check dissolved, and the modes of opposition for relief so contracted, as to leave us only the miserable alternative of sup∣plication or violence. And these, it seems, are the liberties of <HI>Americans. Because</HI> the costi∣tution has not <HI>"expressly declared"</HI> the line be∣tween the rights of the mother country and <HI>those</HI> of her colonists, THEREFORE, the latter have <HI>no rights.</HI> A logic, equally edifying to the heads and hearts of men of sense and humanity.</P>
<P>WE assert, a line there must be, and shall now proceed with great deference to the judgment of others, to trace that line, according to the ideas we entertain: And it is with satisfaction we can say, that the records, statutes, law-books, and most approved writers of our mother country, those "dead but most faithful counsellors" (as Sir <HI>Edward Coke</HI> calls them) "who cannot be daunted by fear, nor muzzled by affection, reward, or hope of preferment, and there∣fore may safely be believed," confirm the prin∣ciples we maintain.</P>
<P>LIBERTY, life, or property, can, with no consistency of words or ideas, be termed a <HI>right</HI> of the <HI>possessors,</HI> while <HI>others</HI> have a <HI>right</HI> of taking them away <HI>at pleasure.</HI> The most distinguished

This society is likewise a state of equality and inde∣pendance, which establishes a parity of right between them; and engages them to have the same regard and respect for one another. Hence the general principle of the law of na∣tions is nothing more than the general law of sociability, which obliges all nations that have any intercourse with one another, to practise those duties to which individuals are naturally subject.</P>
<P>"These remarks may serve to give us a just idea of that art, so necessary to the directors of states, and distinguished commonly by the name of <HI>polity.</HI> Polity considered with regard to foreign states, is that ability and address by which a sovereign provides for the preservation, safety prosperity and glory of the nation he governs, by respecting the laws of justice and humanity: that is, without doing and injury to other states, but rather by procuring their ad∣vantage, as much as in reason can be expected. Thus the polity of sovereigns is the same as prudence among private people; and as we condemn in the latter any art or cun∣ning, that makes them pursue their own advantage to the prejudice of others, so the like art would be censurable in princes, were they bent upon procuring the advantage of their own people by injuring other nations. The <HI>reason of state,</HI> to often alledged to justify the proceedings or enter∣prises of princes, cannot really be admitted for this end, but inasmuch as it is reconcileble with the common interest

<P>"<HI>Gretius</HI> indeed acknowledges that the law of nature is common to all nations; yet he establishes a positive law of nations <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from the law of nature; and reduces this law of nations to a sort of human law, which has ac∣quired a power of obliging in consequence of the will and consent of all or of a great many nations.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See Grotius, rights of war and peace: preliminary discourse § 18. and book 1. chap. 1. §. 14.</NOTE> He adds, that the maxims of this law of nations are proved by the perpetual practice of people, and the testimony of histori∣ans.</P>
<P>"But it has been justly observed that this pretended law of nations, contradistinct from the law of nature, and invested nevertheless with a force of obliging, whether people con∣sent to it or not, is a supposition destitute of all founda∣tion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fendorf, law of nature and nations, book 2. chap. 3. § 23. with Barbeyarc's notes.</NOTE></P>
<P>For 1. all nations are with regard to one another in a natural independance and equality. If there be therefore any common law between them, it must proceed from God their common sovereign.</P>
<P N="2">2. As for what relates to customs established by an ex∣press or tacit consent among nations, these customs are nei∣ther of themselves, nor universally, nor always obligatory. For from this only that several nations have acted towards one another for a long time after a particular manner in particular cases, it does not follow that they have laid them∣selves under a necessity of acting always in the same manner for the time to come, and much less that other nations are obliged to conform to these customs.</P>

It seems likewise, that some nations allowed themselves the use of poisoned arms in time of war.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">See Virgil AEneid, book 10. v. 139. with the 15th note of the Abbe des Foutaines.</NOTE> Shall we say that these were customs authorised by the law of nations, and really obligatory in respect to different people?

<PB N="47" REF="013247_0053_0F90438A236AA298"/>

which it means to promote and secure, is to be regarded. 6thly. If there is not such a <HI>representation</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> as the constitution requires, there <HI>ought</HI> to be. As to the resem∣blance above supposed. 1st. If many inhabitants of <HI>Eng∣land</HI> HAVE NOT a right to vote in the choice of members of the house of commons, there are many who HAVE. 2dly. <HI>Not one</HI> inhabitant of the colonies, <HI>has</HI> that right. 3dly. <HI>Some</HI> representation is better than <HI>none,</HI> though a <HI>complete</HI> one cannot be obtained. The <HI>first,</HI> is a <HI>defect</HI> of <HI>mode,</HI> the <HI>latter</HI> an <HI>extinction</HI> of the <HI>substance.</HI> There is, to a <HI>nice</HI> obser∣ver of nature, a <HI>perceptible</HI> difference between a <HI>deformed</HI> man and a DEAD man. 4thly.

By acquiring and enjoying a right to such vote, the <HI>colonists</HI> must <HI>cease</HI> to be inhabitants of the colonies—8thly. Their <HI>being inhabitants of the colonies,</HI> therefore <HI>disqualifies</HI> them from acquiring and enjoying the right to such vote.—9thly. If those not entitled to such vote in <HI>England</HI> were not bound by statutes made <HI>there</HI> they would not be bound by sta∣tutes, nor taxed <HI>at all,</HI> though possest of great property—but 10thly. The colonists are <HI>bound and taxed</HI> by the acts of their assemblies. 11thly.

Totally different is the condition of colonists, if bound by statutes generally.—By the acts of parliament for raising a revenue in <HI>America,</HI> the commons use the words, "GIVE AND GRANT." Can men give and grant what they have not? Did any of those acts take a sin∣gle penny out of the pocket of a single GIVER and GRAN∣TOR?

If we cannot, yet as we are upbraided continually in pamphlets and papers with the richness of our houses, our furniture, our equipage, our tables, and our dress, she may be made to think we abound too much in these <HI>conveniencies.</HI> If we are reduced to the condition of <HI>French</HI> peasants, it is no matter. We belong to the people of <HI>Great-Britain:</HI> And all <HI>British</HI> subjects, but <HI>Americans,</HI> may do what they please with their own.

<P>A statute intended to have force on the people of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> is the case of A STATE <HI>acting upon</HI> ITSELF.

In short, our national debt and taxes (besides the inconveniencies before-mentioned) have also in their natural consequences thrown such a weight of power into the exe∣cutive scale of government, as we cannot think was intended by our patriot ancestors; who gloriously struggled for the abolition of the then formidable parts of the prerogative, and by an unaccount∣able want of fore<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight established this system in their stead. <HI>The entire collection and management of so vast a revenue, being placed in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nds of the crown,</HI> have given rise to such a multitude of new officers, created by and removeable at the royal pleasure, that they have extended the influence of government to every corner of the nation. Witness the <HI>commissioners,</HI> and the <HI>multitude of depen∣dents on the customs,</HI> in every port of the kingdom; the <HI>commission∣ers of excise,</HI> and their <HI>numerous subalterns,</HI> in every inland district: the <HI>postmasters,</HI> and their <HI>servants,</HI> planted in every town, and up∣on every public road; the <HI>commissioners of the stamps,</HI> and their <HI>distri∣butors,</HI> which are full as scattered and full as numerous; the <HI>officers of the salt duty,</HI> which, though a species of excise and conducted in the same manner, are yet made a distinct corps from the ordinary managers of that revenue; the <HI>surveyors of houses and windows▪</HI> the <HI>receivers of the land tax;</HI> the <HI>managers of lotteries;</HI> and the <HI>commission∣ers of hackney coaches;</HI> all which are either mediately or immediate∣ly appointed by the crown, and removeable at pleasure without any reason assigned: these, it requires but little penetration to see, must give that power, on which they depend for subsistence, an in∣fluence most amazingly extensive. To this may be added the fre∣quent opportunities of conferring particular obligations, by prefer∣ence in <HI>loans, subscriptions, tickets, remit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ances,</HI> and <HI>other money tran∣sactions,</HI> which will greatly encrease this influence; and that over those persons whose attachment, on account of their wealth, is fre∣quently

the most desirable. All this is the natural, though perhaps the unforeseen, consequence of erecting our funds of credit, and to sup∣port them establishing our present perpetual taxes: the whole of which is in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irely new since the restoration in 1660; and by far the greatest part since the revolution in 1688. And the same may be said with re∣gard to the <HI>officers</HI> in our numerous army, and the places which the army has created. All which put together gives the executive power so persuasive an energy with respect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the persons themselves and so prevailing an interest with their friends and families, as will amply make amends for the loss of external prerogative.</P>
<P>"But, though this profusion of offices should have no effect on individuals, there is still another newly acquired branch of power; and that is▪ not the influence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but the <HI>force of a dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iplined army:</HI> paid indeed ultimately by the people, but immediately by the crown; raised by the crown, officered by the crown, comman∣ded by the crown.

And there need but few words to demonstrate how great a trust is thereby reposed in the prince by his people. A trust, that is more than equivalent to a thousand little troublesome prerogatives.</P>
<P>"Add to all this, that, besides the <HI>civil list,</HI> the <HI>immense reve∣nue</HI> of almost seven millions sterling, which is annually paid to the creditors of the public, or carried to the sinking fund, is first depo∣sited in the royal exchequer, and thence issued out to the respec∣tive offices of payment.

<P>A minister declared in the house of commons, that he should "always consider it as a part of the constitution that the military should act under the civil authority."

<P>I must think this point of such great importance, as to extend probably to the <HI>annihilation of manufacturers</HI> in our colonies—To conclude, it is in the proposed settle∣ment on the <HI>Ohio</HI> we must <HI>first</HI> look for hemp and flax; as such great numbers of the old <HI>American</HI> farmers have re∣moved and settled there, which may, in those fertile tracts, be cultivated in such abundance, as to enable us to undersell all the world, as well as supply our own consumption.

To these we should bring the settlers from <HI>Europe,</HI> or at least suffer none to go <HI>north</HI> of <HI>New-York;</HI> by which means our numbers would in∣crease in those parts, where it is our interest they should increase; and the report of the settlers from the new colo∣ny on the <HI>Ohio</HI> would be a constant drain of people from our <HI>unprofitable</HI> northern ones, by which means they would, in future times, as well as the present, be prevented from extending their manufactures.</P>
<P>What I shall therefore venture to propose is, that the government, <HI>through the means of a few merchants</HI> acquaint∣ed with the <HI>American</HI> trade, that can be tolerably de∣pended upon, should establish <HI>factons</HI> at <HI>Boston, Philadelphia, New York,</HI> and a few other ports, for the sale of such car∣goes of <HI>British</HI> manufactures as should be consigned to them; and to consist of such particularly as were most manufactured in the province, with directions immediately and continual∣ly to <HI>undersell</HI> all such colony manufactures. By this means the operation of the succeeding measures, from the num∣ber

of hands rendered idle, would be so much the easier to be executed.</P>
<P>The ships which carried out such cargoes should be large bulky ones, of eight, nine hundred, and one thou∣sand tons burden, for the sake of bringing large quantities of deals, &amp;c. back, at a less proportionate expence; and, previous to their arrival in <HI>America,</HI> cargoes of these should be ready for them. The colonists should be engaged to work their iron mines, and get the product ready in bars, &amp;c. and vast quantities of deals and squared timber ready for loading the ships: All which, on the certain and imme∣diate prospect of a sale would easily be effected; as it is well known they have more than once proved to the legisla∣ture, that they could supply all <HI>Europe</HI> with these articles, had they but the <HI>demand.</HI></P>
<P>But I laid it down as a rule to proceed upon, that <HI>trade, fishing,</HI> and <HI>manufacturing,</HI> were put an entire stop to among the colonies.</P>
<P>If the sugar islands contained ten millions of people, AS DESTITUTE OF NECESSARIES as they are at present, <HI>Britain</HI> would be as SURE of their allegiance as she is at present—provided no power more formidable than herself at sea arose for their protection.</P>
<P>The first dependance of our colonies, as well as all their people, is, to change the terms a little, upon corn worked into bread and iron wrought into implements; or, in other words, it is upon <HI>necessary</HI> agriculture and <HI>necessary</HI> manufactures; for a people who do not possess these, to think of throwing off the yoke of another <HI>who supplies them with them,</HI> is an absurd idea. This is precisely the case with our sugar islands. Let us suppose the continental colonies to be as happy in the <HI>necessary agriculture</HI> as they really are, but to be absolutely without manufactures, could they throw off their allegiance to <HI>Britain</HI> be their numbers
<PB N="72" REF="013247_0078_0F90439FF7CAFD50"/>

what they would? No. certainly; for that is nothing more than supposing they should throw off their allegiance to hoes and spades, and <HI>coats</HI> and <HI>shoes,</HI> which is absurd to imagine: can any one imagine that a rebellion can be car∣ried on among a people, when the greatest success must be attended with the loss of <HI>half</HI> the <HI>necessaries</HI> of life!</P>
<P>The following, among other effects relative to this point, would be the consequence of the <HI>plan</HI> sketched out in the preceding section.</P>
<P>The people would depend on <HI>Britain</HI> for those <HI>neces∣saries of life</HI> which result from manufactures.</P>
<P>The cultivation of <HI>staples</HI> would be more profitable to them than any other employment whatever.</P>
<P>The <HI>sale</HI> of those staples would depend on <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>The people would all be <HI>spread</HI> over an immense country as planters;—none of them collected in towns.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"This point, which is of infinite importance, would pretty fully be occasioned by other parts of the plan. But, to ensure so great a point, no new towns should be suffered, nor even villages; than which nothing could be easier to manage: nor would they be any where necessary but by the magazines of naval stores for load∣ing ships. All possible decrease of numbers in the cities already in being, should be effected. So systematically absurd is it to found towns and cities, as <HI>Britain</HI> has hitherto constantly done, in all the colonies she has formed."</NOTE></P>
<P>"To which circumstances I shall add, in respect to <HI>Bri∣tain'</HI>s further policy.</P>
<P>"That she should abide by the boundaries fixed already to the old colonies, that of the rivers heads; and all fur∣ther settling to be in <HI>new colonies,</HI> wherever they were traced.</P>
<P>"That she should keep the inland navigation of the continent, that is, of all the great lakes and navigable ri∣vers, to herself, and not suffer any <HI>sets</HI> of men to navigate

them, and thereby communicate from one part of the con∣tinent to another</P>
<P>That she should never suffer any <HI>provincial troops</HI> or <HI>militia</HI> to be raised, but reserve entirely to herself the de∣fence of the frontiers.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>"Specie tuendi finium, jugum liberis provinciis meditatur" <BIBL>STRADA, <HI>lib.</HI> 2.</BIBL></P></NOTE></P>
<P>That she should throw whatever obstacles she could, upon all plans of <HI>communication</HI> from colony to colony, or conveniences of speedy removals from place to place.</P>
<P>That in proportion as any colony declined in staples and threatened not to be able to produce a sufficiency of them, the inhabitants should receive such encouragement to leave it, as <HI>more</HI> than to drain its natural increase, un∣less new staples were discovered for it.</P>
<P>This is <HI>now</HI> the case with those I have distinguished by the title of the northern colonies; insomuch that <HI>Nova-Scotia, Canada, New-England, New York, New-Jersey,</HI> and <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> would be nearly of as much benefit to this country DURIED IN THE OCEAN as they are at present.

<P>"The war with <HI>France</HI> being concluded, it was resolved to keep up the troops in these provinces, and that the states should support them, which by a song course of war was grown customary."

The author of the controversy does not deny it: but enters into a dissertation upon the <HI>more</HI> and the <HI>less,</HI> which is not the point in question. 2dly. The writer of the letters say, that "an <HI>act of parliament</HI> commanding us to to do a certain thing, if it ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any vaildity, is a <HI>tax</HI> upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> the <HI>ex∣pence</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">This sentence related to the dissolution of the assembly of <HI>New-York,</HI> for not complying with the act of parliament for not supplying the troops.

word to mean the <HI>designation</HI> of money to particular pur∣poses in acts of parliament. Could it be possible, that the author of "the controversy" should imagine, the writer of the letters could be ignorant of such designation or appro∣priation of money by parliament, when one can scarcely open a book of statutes, without observing them? Parlia∣ment may accommodate grants of money to public necessi∣ties—and may call officers of the crown to account for mo∣ney, but these powers no more prove the <HI>actual expenditure and employment</HI> of money to belong to parliament, than the power of calling officers of the crown to account for in∣jurious leagues, or declarations of war, proves the power of parliament to make leagues or to declare war. Besides, it being contended against the colonies, that the <HI>"sovereign power"</HI> is lodged in king, lords, and commons, the same persons may <HI>tax</HI> and <HI>expend,</HI> to what excess and in what man∣ner THEY PLEASE, while the colonies will have NO KIND OF CONTROUL over them: And, that such an <HI>union</HI> of those powers, is unconstitutional and dangerous to the colonies in extreme, was the point the writer of the letter inoffensively ventured to assist on.</P>

<P>Some other unfairnesses there are in this famous piece, that need only be viewed, to be refuted; but of which, it may be said, if a "precedent" established by the respecta∣ble gentleman himself, can procure pardon for the expres∣sion, that "they are not entitled to notice." How could he venture to assert as he does, that—"the <HI>purpose</HI> of the letters was to excite resentment in the colonies against the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> parent country and to push them on to a separation from her." The letters prove the contrary. Few men have exprest a warmer zeal for the connexion, than the writer of them!

The author is welcome to take what o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er licenses he pleases in his reprehensions of the writer; but he ought not to have denied his integrity.

<P>A DEPENDANCE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This word "dependance" as applied to the states connected with <HI>England,</HI> seems to be a new one. It ap∣pears to have been introduced into the language of the law, by the common wealth act of 1650. A "dependance on parliament" is still more modern. A people cannot be too cautious in guarding against such innovations. "The creden∣tials of the imperial ambassadors to the states of <HI>Holland,</HI> were directed "TO <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>OUR FAITHFUL AND BELOVED."

<P>WE are aware of the objection, that, "if the king of <HI>England</HI> is therefore king of the colonies, they are subject to the general legislative autho∣rity of that kingdom." The premises by no means warrant this conclusion. It is built on a mere supposition, that, the colonies are thereby acknowledged to be <HI>within the realm,</HI> and on an incantation expected to be wrought by some magic force in those woods.

But a general legislative power, is not a power to preserve that connection, but to distress and enslave them. If the first power cannot subsist, without the last, she has no right even to the first,—the colonies were deceived in their contract—and the power must be unjust and illegal; for God has given to them <HI>a better right</HI> to preserve their liberty, than to her to destroy it.

To argue on this subject from other instances of parliamentary power, is shifting the

ground. The connexion of the colonies with <HI>England,</HI> is a point of an unprecedented and delicate nature. It can be compared to no other case; and to receive a just determination, it must be considered with reference to its own peculiar circumstances.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>The learned Judge, [in Vol. 1. pag. 107.] says this country was not "<HI>uninhabited</HI> when discovered and planted by the English, &amp;c. but <HI>ought to be considered</HI> as a <HI>conquered, ceded,</HI> or <HI>infidel</HI> country.

They are subject however to the controul of the parliament."</P>
<P>According to this doctrine, the <HI>colonists</HI> are considered <HI>in a legal view</HI> by the parent state, "as <HI>infidels</HI> or <HI>conquered people,</HI>" not as her children with her consent establishing societies for her benefit.

If <HI>this</HI> be their <HI>"condition,"</HI> then according to the law laid down by the judge, "they are subject not only to the controul of <HI>parliament,</HI>" but the "<HI>King</HI> may <HI>alter</HI> and <HI>impose</HI> what laws <HI>he pleases.</HI>"<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">1 Blac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>kst. 107. and the cases there cited.</NOTE></P>
<P>It is not known, what the learned Judge means by the word <HI>"principally."</HI> Perhaps he alludes to the ill directed <HI>hu∣manity</HI> and <HI>justice</HI> of the first settlers of some colonies, who purchased the lands from the natives, for valuable and
<PB N="98" REF="013247_0104_0F904C2DA95CDE00"/>


satisfactory considerations. It was a very useleless exercise of their virtues, for their posterity. It they had <HI>by accident</HI> settled an <HI>"uninhabited"</HI> country, the invaluable rights of the common law would have <HI>attended</HI> them; but when they <HI>dared</HI> to obtain a settlement by <HI>humanity</HI> and <HI>justice,</HI> they <HI>forfeited</HI> all rights of the common law, to the latest succeeding ages. <HI>Can this be law?</HI> Every case quoted by the Judge, it is humbly apprehended, makes a distinc∣tion between states or societies composed of <HI>English subjects,</HI> and those composed of <HI>"conquered"</HI> people, &amp;c. and that <HI>this</HI> is, the only distinction warrantable by those cases. That the <HI>conquerors</HI> should be considered AS the <HI>conquered,</HI> the <HI>expellers of the natives</HI> AS the <HI>expelled natives,</HI> and the <HI>christian possessors and owners by fair purchases from those who had a right to sel,</HI> AS at the <HI>infidels no longer possessing or own∣ing,</HI> seems to involve a confusion of ideas, little agreeing with the strength of reason that informs the common law.</P>
<P>It is very remarkable, how our ablest antagonists are perplexed in framing their arguments against us. Even the learned judge does not express himself with his usual per∣spicuity: But the want of it is well atoned, if we, colonists, can be thereby deprived of the benefits of the <HI>common law,</HI> and be absolutely subjected to the <HI>king;</HI> for <HI>these</HI> courtly tenets are the <HI>only</HI> consequences deducible from the curious <HI>argu∣ment</HI> that tends to involve <HI>these colonies</HI> in the misfortunes of "<HI>conquered, ceded,</HI> or <HI>infidel</HI> countries." The "controul of parliament," is asserted to be supreme, in every case. Whether the colonies were settled in "uninhabited countries," or in "conquered, ceded, or infidel countries," makes no difference as to <HI>that</HI> point.</P>
<P>Another learned gentleman has discovered, that we "are not entitled to as great a degree of freedom as <HI>Ireland.</HI>" Why? "Because <HI>Ireland</HI> was a <HI>conquered</HI> country." This remark does not seem to remove the difficulty. Let us hear the point a little more explained. "<HI>Ireland</HI> it is true was

<HI>conquered,</HI> but certain <HI>concessions</HI> were made to the people. These were the terms granted them, but <HI>England</HI> is obliged to keep no terms with the colonists." At every step these gentlemen take, those writers, who have contributed so much to the glory of their country, turn upon them, and directly oppose them. They at first shrink before these ve∣nerable advocates for liberty and humanity—but recol∣lecting themselves, they distinguish and refine, in order to take away the substance of every argument, and to whittle down a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> and a <HI>Locke</HI> into a <HI>Lestrange</HI> and a <HI>Filmer.</HI> After taking these liberties, they at length grow bold enough to arraign the authority of any man, even Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> himself, if his writings cannot, by all this art, be turned to their purpose.</P>
<P>We need no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be surprised after this, that every colonist, who ventures honestly, to assert, as well as he can, the cause of his native <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and, should be treated with little respect.

<P>His friend Mr. <HI>Molineux,</HI> in a letter dated <HI>March</HI> 15. 16<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7-8, tells him of his intentions to visit him—when he could get loose from business: "But this I cannot hope for till the parliament in <HI>England</HI> rises.

<P>Mr. <HI>Locke,</HI> in his answer dated <HI>April</HI> 6, 1698, says, amongst other things I would be glad to talk with you about, before I die, is that which you suggest at the bottom of the first page of your letter.

<P>SUBMISSION to unjust sentences proves not a <HI>right</HI> to pass them.

A PARLIAMENTARY power of <HI>internal legisla∣tion</HI> over these colonies, appears therefore to us, equally contradictory to humanity and the con∣stitution, and illegal.</P>
<P>As to the second head, a power of regulating our trade, our opinion is, that it is legally vested in parliament, not as a supreme legislature over these colonies, but as the supreme legislature and full <HI>representative</HI> of the parent state, and the only judge between her and her children in commercial interests, which the nature of the case, in the progress of their growth admitted.

on <HI>a few plain principles.</HI> The plausible appear∣ance of the objection consists in a confused com∣prehension of several points, entirely distinct in their nature, and leading to consequences direct∣ly opposite to each other. There was a time, when <HI>England</HI> had no colonies. Trade was the object she attended to, in encouraging them. A love of freedom was manifestly the chief mo∣tive of the adventurers. The connexion of co∣lonies with their parent state, may be called a new object of the <HI>English</HI> laws. That her right extinguishes all their rights,—rights essential to freedom, and which they would have enjoyed, by remaining in their parent state, is offensive to reason, humanity, and the constitution of that state. Colonies could not have been planted on <HI>these</HI> terms. What <HI>Englishman,</HI> but an ideot, would have become a colonist on these condi∣tions? to mention no more particulars, "That every shilling he gained, might rightfully be ta∣ken from him—trial by jury abolished—the building houses or making cloths with the mate∣rials found or raised in the colonies prohibited—and armed men set over him to govern him in every action?"</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="013247_0120_0F904C3AAD7DBC98"/>
HAD these provinces never been settled—had all the inhabitants of them now living, been born in <HI>England,</HI> and resident there, they would now enjoy the rights of <HI>Englishmen,</HI> that is, they would be free <HI>in that kingdom.</HI> We claim <HI>in the colonies</HI> these and no other rights. <HI>There</HI> no other kingdom or state interferes. But their trade, however, important it may be, as the affairs of mankind are circumstanced, turns on other principles. All the power of parliament cannot regulate <HI>that</HI> at their pleasure. It must be regu∣lated not by parliament alone, but by treaties and alliances <HI>formed by the king</HI> WITHOUT THE CON∣SENT OF THE NATION, with other states and kingdoms. <HI>The freedom of a people consists in being governed by laws, in which no alteration can be made, without their consent.</HI> Yet the wholesome force of these laws is <HI>confined</HI> to the limits of their own country. That is, a su∣preme legislature to a people, which acts <HI>inter∣nally</HI> over that people, and inevitably implies <HI>personal</HI> assent, <HI>representation,</HI> or <HI>slavery.</HI> When an universal empire is established, and not till then, can regulations of trade properly be cal∣led, acts of supreme legislature. It seems from many authorities, as if almost the whole power of regulating the trade of <HI>England</HI> was original∣ly vested in the crown. One restriction appears to have been, that no duty could be impos∣ed without the consent of parliament. Trade
<PB N="115" REF="013247_0121_0F904C3C2F6024B0"/>
was little regarded by our warlike ancestors. As commerce became of more importance, duties, and severities were judged necessary additions to its first simple state, parliament more and more interfered. The constitution was always free, but not always exactly in the same manner. "By the Feodal law, all <HI>navigable</HI> rivers and <HI>havens</HI> were computed among the Regalia, and were subject to the sovereign of the state. And in <HI>England</HI> it hath always been held, that the king is lord of the whole shore, and particu∣larly is guardian of the ports and havens, which are the inlets and gates of the realm: and there∣fore, so early as the reign of king John, we find ships seized by the kings officers, for putting in at a place that was not a legal port. These le∣gal ports were undoubtedly at first assigned by the crown; since to each of them a court of portmote is incident, the jurisdiction of which must flow from the royal authority. The erec∣tion of beacons, lighthouses, and sea marks is also a branch of the royal prerogative. The king may injoin any man from going abroad, or command any man to return. The powers of establishing public marts, regulating of weights and measures, and the giving authority to, or making current, money, <HI>the medium of com∣merce,</HI> belong to the crown. By making peace or war, leagues and treaties, the king may

open or stop trade as he pleases. The admiralty courts are grounded on the necessity of support∣ing a jurisdiction so extensive, though opposite to the usual doctrines of the common law. The laws of <HI>Oleron</HI> were made by <HI>Richard</HI> the first, and are still used in those courts." In the "Mare clausum", are several regulations made by kings<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The power of regulating trade, was carried so far by the crown, as sometimes to impose duties; and queen <HI>Eli∣zabeth</HI> obtained several judgments in the exchequer on such regulations.

<HI>of the realm</HI> ought not to contribute to the maintenance of the kings wars <HI>out of the realm</HI>—but this matter was ne∣ver in quiet, until it was more particularly explained by divers acts of parliament." The comment then mentions several acts declaring that no <HI>Englishman</HI> shall be bound to contribute to the kings wars <HI>out of England,</HI> in <HI>Scotland, Gascoigny, Ireland, Calais,</HI>) though <HI>these three last</HI> were countries <HI>dependant on England,</HI>) and says, "the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e acts of parliament are but declarations of the antient law of <HI>Eng∣land</HI>—But here may be observed, that when any antient law or custom of parliament" (such as before mentioned by making acts relating to foreign wars) "is broken, and the crown possessed of a precedent, how difficult a thing it is, TO RESTORE THE SUBJECT AGAIN TO HIS FORMER FREEDOM AND SAFETY." 2 ins. 527—529.</P>
<P>The author of "the controversy," who with a liberality of sentiment becoming a pleader against freedom and the best interest of mankind, counts, "statute books"—"minis∣ters"—"king's council"—pa. 77. 78.—:"scraps of jour∣nals"—pa 81. and ordinances of "the rump parlia∣ment"—pa. 87. among <HI>his</HI> "DEITIES" pa. 78; and grieves that we poor <HI>"infidel"</HI> colonists will not pay his idols the veneration his zeal judges due to them, has col∣lected a good many fragments of proceedings in the house of commons from the year 1614 to 1628. The amount is this, that the ministers of the crown insisted, that parliament could not make laws for <HI>America;</HI> that the the commons doubted; but at length in 1724, came to an opinion, that the king's patent for "a <HI>monopoly</HI> of fishing on the <HI>coasts of America</HI> was a <HI>grievance,</HI>"—that a <HI>"clause of</HI> FORFEITURE" against those who interfered in the fishery was void—and past a bill "for a <HI>free</HI> liberty of <HI>fishing</HI>" &amp;c. It appears in the debates that the fishery was free <HI>before the patent was granted</HI>—These extracts do not shew, what 
<PB N="118" REF="013247_0124_0F904C3E29E66CD8"/>


became of the bill in the house of lords. One Mr. <HI>Brooke</HI> said in 1621—"We may make laws here for <HI>Virginia,</HI> for <HI>if the king gives consent</HI> to this bill past here and by the lords, this will controul the patent."</P>
<P>It seems, as if the notion of the king's regulating power still prevailed, but, that "a clause of <HI>forfeiture</HI>" in such re∣gulations was void." So much had the power of parlia∣ment grown since king <HI>John'</HI>s reign. Nor does it ap∣pear to have been unreasonable, as commerce became of more consequence. The instance here mentioned, related to a regulation of trade; and however the king might have accommodated the point, with the other branches of the le∣gislature, the whole proceeding is immaterial. If it was a right actually enjoyed by <HI>Englishmen</HI> to fish on the coasts of a plantation—and a grant by the crown of the fishery to the people of the plantation excluding the people of <HI>England,</HI> could not <HI>divest them</HI> of their right—or, "if by the king's giving his consent to a bill passed by lords and commons,"—"the patent might be controuled"—it does not follow, that the king, lords and commons could divest the people of the plantations of all <HI>their</HI> rights.</P></NOTE> Time forbids a more exact enquiry

<P>Here it may be observed, <HI>first,</HI> that the reason assigned by the judges, why the statutes of <HI>England</HI> bind not the people of <HI>Ireland,</HI> though <HI>specially named,</HI> contains a consti∣tutional principle, the sine qua non of freedom. <HI>Secondly,</HI> that the people of <HI>Ireland,</HI> as subjects of the king, were <HI>"under, the admiralty of England as to things done on the high sea;"</HI> which is a strong confirmation given by the judges of <HI>England,</HI> to the supposition before made, of the power of regulating trade being formerly vested in the king. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> that the opinion of the chief justice, and of the other justices, such as it was, "reddendo singula sin∣gulis, &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecundum subjectam materiam," proves at most, only that <HI>Ireland</HI> was bound <HI>by statutes regulating their trade,</HI> for such was the 2 <HI>Henry</HI> 6th ch. 4th on which the case arose. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> that <HI>Brooke</HI> a man of great eminence and dignity in the law, appears by his note, to have been dissa∣tisfied with the judgment, tho only on a statute of regula∣tion, for <HI>this</HI> reason of such weight with an <HI>Englishman,</HI>—"because <HI>Ireland</HI> is a realm of itself and has a parliament within itself" <HI>Fifthly,</HI> that the authority of the crown, including the regulation of the trade of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and send∣ing writs of error there, were sufficient restraints, to secure the obedience and subordination of that kingdom. This reason seems to have held its ground, till lord chief justice <HI>Coke'</HI>s time; and though a great reverence is entertained for his memory, yet it can never be acknowledged, that an <HI>"obiter dietum"</HI> of his, or of any other man, is a rule of law. In <HI>Calvin'</HI>s case, the chief justice reciting the foregoing case, says, <HI>"Hibernia</HI> habet parliamentum, &amp; faciunt le∣ges, &amp; nostra statuta non ligant eos, QUIA non mittunt milites ad parliamentum (which "adds he," is to be <HI>under∣stood,</HI> unless they be <HI>especially named</HI>) And does the "especially naming them," give them a representation, or remove the injustice of binding them without it? This ob∣servation in plain English would run thus▪ "Our statutes

<P>Whatever pretence the chief justice's opinion was founded on, it has been carefully repeated in many law books since. Whether his lordship meant, that statutes of <HI>England</HI> could <HI>bind</HI> the people of <HI>Ireland,</HI> in taking away trials by jury,—taxing them, and indeed, "<HI>in all cases whatsoever,"</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> only in preserving their subordination, as by regulating their trade, which was the case referred to in his comment, does not appear.

And there∣fore the inference is just, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> meant such a power.</NOTE> With respect to all these declarations, however, as they are made to refer to us, we may answer as the lion did to the man in the fable.</P>
<P>Much the same arbitrary construction has been made on the question; whether a man could be tried in <HI>England</HI> on a charge of committing treason in <HI>Ireland.</HI> In queen <HI>Eliza∣beth'</HI>s reign, "<HI>Cerrade,</HI> chancellor of <HI>Ireland</HI> moved that question to the counsel of the queen, and it was held by <HI>Wray, Dier,</HI> and <HI>Gerrarde,</HI> attorney general, he could not, because he was a subject of <HI>Ireland</HI> and not of <HI>England,</HI> and if tried in <HI>England,</HI> he could not be tried by his peers." <HI>Dier,</HI> 360. Afterwards, to gratify the queen's resentment against some rebels, they were tried in <HI>England;</HI> and thus passion and complaisance made very good law against reason and justice.</P>
<P>Having mentioned <HI>Calvin'</HI>s case, it may not be im∣proper to observe, that if the author of "the controversy" had taken the tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ble of reading it, he might have found his perplexities removed on the question that has given him so much anxiety, and brought such a load of reproaches on the colonies. He is provoked at our insolence for pretending to be any thing more than <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> in <HI>England,</HI> while we deny the power of parliament to bind us "in all cases whatever." In that case, the gentleman would have discovered, that the judges of <HI>England</HI> held, that a man b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n in <HI>Scotland, under the allegiance of James</HI> the first, after his accession to the

throne of <HI>England,</HI> was entitled to all the rights of a subject born in <HI>England;</HI> though the objection, that statutes of <HI>England</HI> could not bind <HI>Scotland,</HI> or a man residing there, who held lands in <HI>England,</HI> was mentioned in the course of the argument. That great difficulty being got over, if the gentleman, will go a step farther, and perceive some little distinction between colonies proceeding out of the loins of <HI>England,</HI> and the <HI>"conquered"</HI> countries of <HI>Ireland</HI> and <HI>Wales,</HI>—the countries of <HI>Gascoigny Guienne,</HI> and <HI>Calais.

Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> first is a power subject to a constitutional check. <HI>Great Britain</HI> cannot in∣jure us by taking away our commerce without hurting herself <HI>immediately.</HI> The last is a pow∣er without check or limit. She might ruin us by it. The injury thereby to herself might be so <HI>remote</HI> as to be despised by her.</P>
<P>THE power of regulation was the only band that could have held us together; formed on one of those "original contracts,"—which only can be a foundation of just authority. Without such a band, our general commerce with <HI>foreign nati∣ons,</HI> might have been injurious and destructive to her. Reason and duty reject such a licence. This our duty resembles that of children to a pa∣rent. The parent has a power over them: but
<PB N="125" REF="013247_0131_0F904C43A2DFB430"/>
they have rights, which the parent cannot take away. Heaven grant that our mother country may regard us as her children, that if by the dispensation of Providence, the time shall come, when her power decreases the memory of former kindnesses, may supply its decays, and her colonies like dutiful children, may serve and guard their aged parent, for ever revering the arms that held them in their infancy, and the breasts that supported their lives, while they were little ones.</P>
<P>IT seems, as if the power of regulation might not inaptly be compared to the prerogative of making peace, war, treaties, or alliances, whereby <HI>"the whole</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I Blackst. 252, 257.</NOTE> <HI>nation are bound,</HI> AGAINST THEIR CONSENT:" and yet the prerogative by no means implies a <HI>supreme legislature.</HI> The lan∣guage held in "the Commentaries" on this point is very remarkable. "With regard to FOREIGN CONCERNS the king is the <HI>delegate</HI> or <HI>representative</HI> of the people; and in him, as in a <HI>center,</HI> all the <HI>rays</HI> of his people are united<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Id.</HI> 252.</NOTE> and the SOVEREIGN POWER <HI>quoad hoc</HI> is vested in his person<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><HI>Id.</HI> 257.</NOTE> Will any <HI>Englishman</HI> say these ex∣pressions are descriptive of the King's authority, WITHIN THE REALM.

He is stiled <HI>"sovereign"</HI> indeed; "his realm is de∣clared by many acts of parliament an <HI>Empire</HI> and his crown <HI>Imperial.</HI>" But do these splendid appellations, the highest known in <HI>Europe</HI> signi∣fy, that "<HI>sovereign</HI> POWER is vested in his person <HI>within the realm?</HI>" We have a full answer in
<PB N="126" REF="013247_0132_0F904C44471E1908"/>
the Commentaries. "The <HI>meaning</HI> of the legi∣slature, when it uses these terms of <HI>empire</HI> and <HI>imperial,</HI> and applies them to the realm and crown of <HI>England,</HI> is <HI>only</HI> to assert, that our king is equally <HI>sovereign</HI> and <HI>independent</HI> within these his dominions; and <HI>owes no kind of subjection</HI> to any potentate upon earth." Thus WE maintain, that with regard to FOREIGN AFFAIRS, the parent original state, "is the <HI>delegate</HI> or <HI>representative,</HI>" of the entire dominions, "the <HI>sovereign power</HI> QUOAD HOC is vested" in her. Her acts under this power "irrevocably bind the whole nation." But yet this power by no means implies <HI>a supreme legislature.</HI></P>
<P>THE exercise of this power <HI>by statutes</HI> was absolutely necessary; because it was, and could only be lodged, as the laws of the parent state, stand, in the supreme legislature of that state, consisting of king, lords, and commons; and <HI>statutes</HI> are the modes by which this united sentiments and resolutions are exprest. It is uni∣versally acknowledged in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> that it in∣fers no power of <HI>taxation</HI> in king and lords, that their <HI>limited</HI> authority is used in cloathing, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and grants of the commons</HI> with the <HI>forms of law</HI>—nor does it infer <HI>supreme legislature</HI> over us. that the <HI>limited</HI> authority of king, lords, and commons is used in cloathing <HI>regulations of trade</HI> with the <HI>form of law.</HI> The commons joining in the act, is not material. The difference is only in the mode of assent. Theirs is <HI>express,</HI> ours is <HI>implied,</HI> as the assent of the "whole nation," is, in the preceeding instances.</P>

THIS power of regulation appears to us to have been pure in its principle, simple in its operation, and salutary in its effects. But for some time past we have observed, with pain, that it hath been turned to other purposes, than it was originally designed for, and retaining its title, hath become an engine of intolerable op∣pressions and grievous taxations. The argu∣ment of an eminent judge, states the point in a similar case strongly for us, in these words.—</P>
<P>"Though it be granted, that the king hath the <HI>custody</HI> of the <HI>havens</HI> and <HI>ports</HI> of this island, be∣ing the very <HI>gates;</HI> of this kingdom, and is <HI>trusted</HI> with the <HI>keys</HI> of these <HI>gates;</HI> yet the <HI>inference</HI> and <HI>orgument</HI> thereupon made, I utterly deny. For in it there is <HI>mutatio hypothesis,</HI> and a <HI>transition</HI> from a thing of <HI>one</HI> nature to <HI>another;</HI> as the <HI>pre∣mises</HI> are of a <HI>power only fiduciary,</HI> and in <HI>point of trust and government,</HI> and the <HI>conclusion</HI> infers a <HI>right of interest and gain.</HI> Admit the king has <HI>custodiam portuum,</HI> yet he hath but the <HI>custody</HI> which is a <HI>trust</HI> and not <HI>dominium utile.</HI> He hath power to <HI>open</HI> and <HI>shut,</HI> UPON CONSIDERA∣TION OF PUBLIC GOOD TO THE PEOPLE AND STATE, but not to make <HI>gain</HI> and <HI>benefit</HI> by it: the <HI>one</HI> is PROTECTION, the <HI>other</HI> is EXPILATION."

Philip'</HI>s em∣pire then comprehended in <HI>Europe,</HI> all <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> the two <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>icilies,</HI> and such provinces of the <HI>Low Countries</HI> as adhered to him,—many islands of importance in the <HI>Mediterranean</HI>—the <HI>Milanese</HI> and many other very valuable territories in <HI>Italy</HI> and elsewhere.—In <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>Asia,</HI> all the dominions belonging to <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portu∣gal</HI>—in <HI>America</HI> the immense countries subject to those two king∣doms, with all their treasures and yet unexhausted mines, and the <HI>Spanish West-Indies.</HI> His armies were numerous and veteran, excel∣lently officered, and commanded by the most renowned generals. So great was their force, that during the wars in the <HI>Low Countries,</HI> his commander in chief the prince of <HI>Parma,</HI> marched twice into <HI>France,</HI> and obliged that great general and glorious king <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, to raise at one time the siege of <HI>Paris</HI> and at another, that of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> considerable was the naval power of <HI>Philip,</HI> that in the midst of the same wars, he fitted out his dreadful <HI>armada</HI> to invade <HI>England.</HI> Yet seven little provinces, or <HI>counties,</HI> as we should call them, inspired by one generous resolution—to die free, rather than to live slaves," not only baffled, but brought down into the dust, that enormous power, that had contended for universal em∣pire, and for half a century, was the terror of the world. Such an amazing change indeed took place, that those provinces afterwards actually PROTECTED <HI>Spain</HI> against the power of <HI>France.</HI></P>
