<P>AS we have all manner of Demon∣strations, to assure us, of what <HI>E∣lihu</HI> asserted when he said, <HI>There is a Spirit in man;</HI> so we have the Eternal <HI>Spirit</HI> of God Himself, by the Pen of His Inspired <HI>Solomon,</HI> Recommending this Blessed Oracle of Wisdom unto us, <HI>A man of Understanding is of an Excel∣lent</HI> S<HI>pirit.</HI> Indeed, we have no <HI>Under∣standing</HI> till, believing that we have within us, a S<HI>pirit Excellent</HI> for the first Author and Nature of it, we Endea∣vour above all things to make that <HI>Spirit</HI> become yet more <HI>Excellent,</HI> by the Alterations of a <HI>New Birth</HI> upon it. The Woful and Rueful Degeneracy, which has befallen the <HI>Spirit</HI> of Man, by his Fall into S<HI>in,</HI> is a matter of the most bleeding Lamentations, unto eve∣ry S<HI>pirit</HI> that in the least measure be∣gins to Awaken out of that Lamentable <HI>Fall.</HI> Yea, The whole Creation Groans over the vitiated <HI>Spirit</HI> of man, and sighs, <HI>How art thou Fallen, O thou Child of the Morning!</HI> Accordingly, when once the Symptoms of a Recovery, from,

upon the <HI>Spirit,</HI> is necessary to make it <HI>Excellent,</HI> so, there is a notable stroke of that work performed in the <HI>Sanctification</HI> of the <HI>Humour,</HI> which is to be seen in the <HI>Temper</HI> and <HI>Biass</HI> of that S<HI>pirit.</HI> There is a certain <HI>Air</HI> of our <HI>Complexion,</HI> which Re∣sults from some Circumstances of the <HI>Uni∣on</HI> between our S<HI>ouls</HI> and our <HI>Bodies;</HI> and this Disposition, we ordinarily call, <HI>The Spirit of the man.</HI> Let <HI>This</HI> be Sanctify'd, and the <HI>Man</HI> will become one of, <HI>The Ex∣cellent in the Earth.</HI> It would be a marvel∣lous Renewal of the <HI>Divine Image</HI> in our <HI>Spirits,</HI> and it would render us extraordina∣rily as well Serviceable to others, as Com∣fortable to our selves, if that <HI>Inclination</HI> which our <HI>Spirits</HI> have, as they are <HI>United,</HI> and therefore very much <HI>Conform'd,</HI> unto our <HI>Bodies,</HI> were <HI>Preserved Blameless:</HI> and were this remarkable Article of <HI>Sanctifica∣tion,</HI> more considered, we should see per∣haps, far more <HI>Excellent</HI> S<HI>pirits,</HI> than are now too frequently beheld in those that wear the <HI>Name,</HI> that began at <HI>Antioch.</HI></P>

<Q><HI>And the very God of Peace Sanctifie you wholly, and I pray God your whole</HI> SPI∣RIT, <HI>and</HI> SOUL <HI>and</HI> BODY, <HI>be pre∣served blameless unto the Coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THe Apostle, having given the <HI>Thessalonians,</HI> divers Exhortati∣ons in the preceding Verses, closes all with a profession of <HI>Prayer</HI> for them; as well knowing, That all Counsels, or Charges by men, tho'
<PB N="2" REF="000661_0009_0FA99FD4EC116710"/>
sent from God himself, would be of no effect, unless God by his Sanctifying Spirit do give men Grace to Improve them.</P>
<P>He prayes, not only that they may be <HI>Sanctified,</HI> but that they may be <HI>wholly</HI> so; And that the fulness of the Expression [<HI>HOLOTELEIS,</HI> wholly perfectly] may the better appear, He Descends to all the <HI>particulars,</HI> that are in Man; he men∣tions the chief Heads of them, which are either <HI>all</HI> that is in Man, or <HI>To which All,</HI> that belongs to Meer Man, may be Referred. Your <HI>whole Spirit,</HI> and <HI>Soul,</HI> and B<HI>ody;</HI> that they may be Sanctified or <HI>filled</HI> with Grace; and not only so, but also <HI>preserved blameless</HI> therein to the Co∣ming of our Lord Jesus Christ; (that is) <HI>preserved to the End.</HI></P>
<P>We shall a little Explain the words:</P>
<P><HI>The very God of peace,</HI> (<HI>Autos de O Theos</HI>) or the God of <HI>P</HI>eace himself: 'twas a frequent Option, Benediction, Salutation or Valediction, [<HI>Peace be to you.</HI>] In the word <HI>Peace,</HI> all good was comprehended. So, to these same persons, 2 <HI>Thes.</HI> 3. 16. <HI>Now the Lord of Peace himself, give you peace always, by all means.</HI> Here in the Text it seems to Referr to a <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty,</HI> peace <HI>with men, v.</HI> 13. <HI>be at peace among your
<PB N="3" REF="000661_0010_0FA99FD5AC2F2840"/>
selves.</HI> And a <HI>priviledge,</HI> peace <HI>with God,</HI> and <HI>in your Consciences.</HI> To both which S<HI>anctification</HI> doth contribute, in the per∣formance of the afore-mentioned Duties.</P>
<P>[<HI>Sanctifie</HI> you] <HI>HAGIASAI, make</HI> you ho∣ly, or separate and consecrate you to himself, (this is the <HI>Notation</HI> of the <HI>word.</HI>) The <HI>Definition</HI> of the <HI>Thing, Sanctification,</HI> is <HI>A Renewal of the whole man, whereby we are enabled daily more and more to Die <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto</HI> S<HI>in and Live unto Righteousness according to Gods Foreordaination.</HI></P>
<P>[<HI>Wholly</HI>] <HI>HOLOTELEI</HI>S, wholly-perfectly (as is before noted is, To Extend this work of Grace, to all the parts of <HI>Grace,</HI> and all the parts of <HI>Man.</HI> The parts of <HI>Grace,</HI> both <HI>Habits</HI> and <HI>Acts;</HI> and in both, the perfection of <HI>Degrees,</HI> and persistance of <HI>Duration.</HI> In the parts of <HI>Man,</HI> that which follows.</P>
<P>[And I pray God your <HI>whole Spirit</HI>] <HI>HOLOCLERON TO PNEUMA.</HI> The word <HI>HOLOCLERON</HI> signifies properly (<HI>Haeres ex asse</HI>) a compleat Heir, from whom nothing is given away; or one that has the whole Inheritance. It there∣fore (I think) does here signify all that Appertains to Man, expressed by the word S<HI>pirit, HUMON TO PNEUMA.</HI> All the Spirit that is in you, or all that may be
<PB N="4" REF="000661_0011_0FA99FD66C6C1200"/>
called <HI>your</HI> S<HI>pirit. Your;</HI> not the S<HI>pirit of God</HI> in you; for <HI>He</HI> is not capable of Sanct∣ification, being already, and always in himself perfectly Holy. <HI>TO PNEUMA,</HI> The S<HI>pirit:</HI> W<HI>hat it is,</HI> is the chief mat∣ter of our present Enquiry; and there∣fore of it, more fully after; only we shall here Note, That it seems to be a more <HI>General,</HI> and comprehensive word, in which the two that follow are Included</P>
<P>[<HI>And Soul and Body</HI>] <HI>KI HE PSUCHE KI TO SOMA.</HI> The Latin [<HI>Et Anima, &amp; Corpus</HI>] I should not scruple to Tran∣slate [<HI>Both</HI> the Soul and the Body,] and if (<HI>et &amp; et</HI>) in Latin signifie [<HI>Both,</HI> &amp; <HI>And</HI>] why (<HI>KI &amp; KI</HI> in Greek, does not as pro∣perly the same, I see no Reason. And then the Text would run thus. I pray that your <HI>whole compleat</HI> S<HI>pirit</HI> (as a General) <HI>Both</HI> S<HI>oul and Body</HI> (two special Ingredi∣ents thereof, or contributers thereunto) may be preserved, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>[<HI>Preserved</HI>] <HI>TERETHEIE,</HI> may be care∣fully watched; as those that keep Guard in a Garrison; for this Spirit of a man, is most liable to Assaults by Temptation: And because men are apt to be Defective in this Spiritual Watch, I pray that God would take the charge of you, watch o∣ver you and keep you sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="000661_0012_0FA99FD8B40A6340"/>
[B<HI>lameless</HI>] <HI>AMEMPTOS,</HI> so as M<HI>omus</HI> (the Carper) shall find no fault in you; so is the word Rendred, <HI>Phil.</HI> 2. 15. and 3. 6. 'Tis supposed you are, or will be, wholly Sanctified (according to the first Prayer in the Text,) but this notwith∣standing your <HI>peculiar</HI> S<HI>pirit</HI> is apt to ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> out, and so be blameable, unless you are <HI>especially</HI> protected, guided and preserved.</P>
<P>[<HI>To the coming of our Lord.</HI>] that is, to the end; Till you come thro' Grace to Glory. This needs no farther Explicati∣on as to the present Enquiry. The <HI>words</HI> thus Explained, we come now to view the <HI>parts</HI> of the Text, wherein we have.</P>
<P N="1">1. Two <HI>Acts.</HI> S<HI>anctification</HI> and <HI>Pre∣servation.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Author</HI> of them, <HI>God;</HI> to whom the Prayer is Directed.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Modification</HI> of them; <HI>wholly, throughout, continually.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>Subject,</HI> the <HI>whole man,</HI> expres∣sed by the <HI>Whole</HI> S<HI>pirit, both</HI> S<HI>oul and</HI> B<HI>ody.</HI> And this Last it is, with which (at present) we are mostly concerned.</P>
<P>The <HI>Whole Man</HI> is sometimes expressed by only two words [S<HI>oul</HI> and B<HI>ody,</HI> or S<HI>pirit</HI> and B<HI>ody</HI>] which are the two phy∣sical, or constituent parts of Man. So 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6. 20.<HI>Ye are Bought with a price,
<PB N="6" REF="000661_0013_0FA99FD8C52C9D90"/>
therefore Glorifie God in your</HI> B<HI>ody, and in your</HI> S<HI>pirits which are Gods.</HI> Also in 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. 1. <HI>Having these promises, Let us cleanse our selves from all filthiness of the Flesh and</HI> S<HI>pirit.</HI> In both which places S<HI>pirit</HI> is the same with S<HI>oul;</HI> and <HI>Flesh</HI> in the latter, is the same with B<HI>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> in the former. But why here the <HI>whole man</HI> (for 'twas the same to be <HI>preserved</HI> that was to be S<HI>ancti∣fied</HI>) why (I say) he should be here ex∣pressed by three particulars, is a matter wherein Expositors do differ, and I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind these several Interpretations of the place.</P>
<P N="1">1. Some will have S<HI>pirit</HI> and S<HI>oul</HI> to be put <HI>Exegetically;</HI> as if both signified but one and the same thing; one being add∣ed only as Explication of the other; so <HI>Austin.</HI>) But (indeed methinks) this here seems a little harsh, because needless; for S<HI>oul</HI> and B<HI>ody,</HI> or S<HI>pirit</HI> and B<HI>ody</HI> (as it is in the two fore-cited Scriptures) were Intelligible enough to express the two physical constituents of a man. Be∣sides, the particle [<HI>Kl. And,</HI> or rather <HI>Both</HI>] seems to connect Spirit,, <HI>And</HI> Soul, as two things that have some Distinction between them.</P>
<P N="2">2. Others will have S<HI>pirit</HI> to signifie the <HI>Mind and Understanding;</HI> and <HI>Soul</HI> the W<HI>ill and Affections</HI> (<HI>Calvin, Marlorate,</HI> and divers others) from whom I would not
<PB N="7" REF="000661_0014_0FA99FD96D5B1580"/>
willingly Dissent, and therefore shall not slight their Judgment; yet I must humbly profess, however clear the Notion was to them, it is not so to me; for that which they call S<HI>oul</HI> is as truly S<HI>pirit,</HI> as the Lea∣ding Faculty (the <HI>Intellect.</HI>) Yea, I find the Expressions quite Transverse; As if <HI>Soul</HI> signified the <HI>Intellectual</HI> Faculty and S<HI>pirit</HI> the <HI>Volitive</HI>) in <HI>Mary's</HI> Song. <HI>Luk.</HI> 1. 46,47. <HI>My Soul doth Magnify the Lord; and my Spirit hath Rejoyced in God my</HI> S<HI>avi∣our.</HI> As if she had said; My S<HI>oul,</HI> (that is, my Mind and Understanding) <HI>Doth Magnify</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> Has high Thoughts of God, great Estimation of him; which are Acts of the <HI>Intellect,</HI> and the only Internal Magnification of him) And my S<HI>pirit,</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> my W<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll and Affections</HI>) hath Rejoy∣ced (which is their proper Act.) This to me seems more currant, if in this place there be a <HI>Distinction</HI> between S<HI>oul</HI> and S<HI>pirit.</HI> But I will not Assert it, I rather think there is none here; only her Inward Joy of heart, being great; her Outward Expressions thereof in words, are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nlar∣ged; Soul and Spirit in a <HI>Pleonasm</HI> signify∣ing only her Inner Man. But if S<HI>pirit</HI> here do present us with any <HI>Distinct</HI> No∣tion, I should take it to be, a <HI>Chearful Frame▪ of</HI> S<HI>pirit,</HI> in which she then was; And then, it will fully fall in with our
<PB N="8" REF="000661_0015_0FA99FDA2F55F350"/>
present Conceptions of the word S<HI>pirit</HI> in our Text, as shall be shewn anon.</P>
<P N="3">3. Some will have S<HI>pirit</HI> (in our Text) to signifie the <HI>Higher</HI> Faculties (both <HI>Un∣derstanding</HI> and <HI>Will</HI>) the <HI>Rational part</HI> in man; and S<HI>oul,</HI> the Inferiour Faculties common to man with Bruits and Plants (S<HI>ensative, Vigetative,</HI> &amp;c.) This indeed is a common Interpretation. But me∣thinks it is harsh to Denominate <HI>Mans</HI> S<HI>oul</HI> from the Inferiour Powers (contrary to that <HI>Logical</HI> Rule. <HI>Denomination is from the better part.</HI> Nor do I find in Scripture (to my Remembrance) the word S<HI>oul,</HI> any where else to have this signification. Nor (Lastly) are these Lower Faculties capable of other Sanctification then that of the Body, which is to be but Instru∣mental to the Soul in Holiness; and there∣fore thus to separate S<HI>oul</HI> from S<HI>pirit,</HI> is but to confound it with Body in the busi∣ness of S<HI>anctification</HI> and <HI>Preservation</HI> here spoken of.</P>
<P>These three forementioned Interpreta∣tions I will not Absolutely deny, nor Contend with their Authors about them; Because they all agree well enough in the <HI>General Scope</HI> of the place, which is (be sure) that <HI>all,</HI> that is <HI>In Man</HI> be <HI>sancti∣fyed</HI> to God, However any one part be
<PB N="9" REF="000661_0016_0FA99FDAEDFFF0A0"/>
Distinguished from the other. Yet I am apt to think that a <HI>more Proper</HI> Interpreta∣tion may be found, which will give a more Full and Edifying sense to the place, then is usually ascribed to it.</P>
<P>For the Enquiry after this we shall consider to what things the <HI>N</HI>ame of <HI>Spirit</HI> is given in Scripture besides those before mentioned: And this I finde to be, to some things <HI>Out of Man,</HI> and some things <HI>In Man.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1 O<HI>ut of Man</HI> the Word (<HI>Spirit</HI>) is ascribed both to <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Creatures.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. To <HI>God</HI> both Essential and Personal.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Essential,</HI> as in <HI>Joh.</HI> 4. 24 <HI>God is a Spirit, and they that worship him, &amp;c.</HI> Not that S<HI>pirit</HI> is an <HI>Univocal Genus</HI> of God and any of his Creatures; for then there would be a <HI>Common Nature;</HI> but there is <HI>Infinite Distance</HI> between them: Only be∣cause S<HI>pirit</HI> is the Name of the <HI>most No∣ble</HI> Created Nature, we Ascribe it also to God by <HI>Analogie,</HI> for that we have no better Name to give him.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Personal,</HI> the <HI>Third</HI> in the Blessed <HI>Trinity,</HI> under the Title of the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> or <HI>Spirit;</HI> the S<HI>pirit of the Lord; of Jesus &amp;c.</HI> But this is not <HI>OUR Spirit;</HI> nor is he to be <HI>Sanctified</HI> or <HI>Preserved;</HI> and so can∣not be here meant.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="10" REF="000661_0017_0FA99FDBAD0CD258"/>
2. To <HI>Angels,</HI> both Good and Bad; but Bad Angels cannot be Sanctified; and Good need no Prayers in this Respect: Nor can they be called <HI>OUR</HI> S<HI>pirits,</HI> unless by Assignation of particular <HI>Guardian An∣gels</HI> to particular men; which (whatever were the Opinion of some Jews, and Gentiles of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld) I know no ground to Believe. This of the Spirit <HI>Out of Man.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>In</HI> M<HI>an,</HI> the Spirit is that, which belongs to a man in a proper and na∣tural sense; and of this kind there seem to be four distinct Significations of the word. Such as.</P>
<P N="1">1. When taken for the S<HI>oul</HI> (the <HI>forma hominis</HI>) Resigned up to God in Death. So I understand <HI>David,</HI> P<HI>sa.</HI> 31. 5. <HI>Unto thee, O Lord I commit my Spirit;</HI> (howe∣ver men deal with my B<HI>ody;</HI>) And this the rather, because <HI>Christ,</HI> at his Death u∣sing the same words, must needs be so understood. <HI>Luk.</HI> 23. 46. Agreeable to <HI>Eccles.</HI> 12. 7. <HI>The</HI> S<HI>pirit returns to God who gave it.</HI> And in the same sense also, <HI>Ch.</HI> 11. 5. <HI>Thou knowest not the way of the</HI> S<HI>pi∣rit, nor how the</HI> B<HI>ones grow in the womb.</HI> That is, (as I take it) Thou understand∣est not how the S<HI>oul</HI> doth form the <HI>Body,</HI> as an Habitation for it self. 'Tis the <HI>Inward</HI> part of man; so the Exegesis seems very
<PB N="11" REF="000661_0018_0FA99FDC6C251620"/>
plain, in that I<HI>sa.</HI> 26. 9. W<HI>ith my</HI> S<HI>oul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my</HI> S<HI>pirit within me will</HI> I <HI>seek thee early; i. e.</HI> with my inward man I <HI>have,</HI> and <HI>will,</HI> apply my self to thee: from whence arises a <HI>Tropical</HI> sense of Spirit, namely to signifie S<HI>incerity. God is my witness, whom I</HI> S<HI>erve in my Spirit in the Gospel, Rom.</HI> 1. 9.</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>Spirit</HI> is taken for the <HI>Life,</HI> or <HI>Union</HI> of Soul and Body; or Souls being in the S<HI>tate of Union.</HI> So I understand, <HI>Job.</HI> 10. 12. <HI>thou hast granted me Life, and thy visitation hath preserved my Spirit;</HI> namely to continue in and with my Body. And ch. 34. 14. 15 <HI>If God gather to himself mans spirit and his breath, all flesh shall perish to gether, and man shall turn again unto Dust.</HI> Thus tis said of the Damsel. whom our Saviour Raysed to Life; <HI>Her Spirit came again, and she arose Luk</HI> 8. 55. <HI>came again</HI> (<HI>ie</HI>) to be <HI>again United</HI> to her Body. We Read <HI>Ecl:</HI> 3.21. of the S<HI>pirit of a man, that goes upwards; and the Spirit of a beast that goeth Downwards,</HI> If the <HI>Spirit</HI> in both parts be understood in the same sense (as most likely it is); then either <HI>Brutes</HI> have <HI>proper</HI> Spirits (which many are loath to admit;) or the Spirit of man must signifie but the <HI>Life,</HI> which is all
<PB N="12" REF="000661_0019_0FA99FDD2EB42570"/>
(if not more, then) some will allow to Beasts. Again, <HI>Chap.</HI> 8. 8. <HI>No man hath power over the Spirit, to Retain the</HI> S<HI>pirit in the Day of Death.</HI> i. e. No man is Master of his own <HI>Life</HI> to prolong it. To the same purpose is that Expression in <HI>Hezeki∣ahs</HI> Prayer, <HI>Isa.</HI> 38. 16. <HI>O Lord by these things men Live, and in all these things is the Life of my</HI> S<HI>pirit, so wilt thou Recover me, and make me to Live.</HI> He means not by the <HI>Life of his</HI> S<HI>pirit;</HI> the continued Duration of his Ever-living Soul, but the continuance of its <HI>Union</HI> with the Bo∣dy, whereby the Life of his person should be prolonged.</P>
<P>The S<HI>pirit,</HI> in this sense taken, may indeed be S<HI>anctified.</HI> The <HI>Life</HI> may be Devotedun▪ to God; according to that of the Apostle. <HI>Rom</HI> 14. 8. <HI>Whether we Live, we Live unto the Lord;</HI> or <HI>Whother we Dye</HI> &amp;c. But this (I think is not the direct meaning of the <HI>Spirit</HI> in our Text.</P>
<P N="3">3. S<HI>pirit</HI> is taken for some special <HI>Faculties,</HI> or particular <HI>Acts</HI> of the mind; such as,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Understanding,</HI> Prov. 20. 27. <HI>The Spi∣rit of a man is the Candle of the Lord, searching all the Inward Parts of the Belly▪</HI> not in an <HI>Anatomical,</HI> but <HI>Moral S</HI>ense; The Understanding is set up by God in man (as a Candle) to search and
<PB N="13" REF="000661_0020_0FA99FDDEE0668E0"/>
find out by its Exercise, all those In∣ward Acts and Inclinations which would otherwise lie hidden and undiscovered. So that, <HI>Isa.</HI> 29. 24. <HI>They that Erred in Spirit, shall come to Understanding, and they that Murmured, shall Learn Doctrine.</HI> That is, they that had misapprehensions of Me, and my Ways, shall come to <HI>Understanding</HI> (not the <HI>Faculty,</HI> but) the <HI>Rectitude</HI> thereof; and they that Murmured, whose <HI>Wills</HI> were averse to embrace Truth shall be graciously Incli∣ned to Learn that which is Right.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Fancy</HI> or Imagination is some∣times to be understood by S<HI>pirit.</HI> Ezek. 13. 3. <HI>Wo unto the Foolish Prophets, that follow their own</HI> S<HI>pirit, and have seen no∣thing,</HI> or that walk after the things which they have not seen; (as in orig.) which God hath not Revealed to them, but they have fabricated to themselves out of their Evil Hearts and Foolish Fancies or Imaginations.</P>
<P N="3">3. The S<HI>pirit</HI> is also taken for the <HI>Thoughts upon,</HI> or Remembring of some person or thing. Thus the Apostle E<HI>x</HI>∣presses his <HI>Thinking</HI> of the <HI>Corinthians</HI> 1 Cor. 5. 3. I <HI>verily as absent in Body, but present in</HI> S<HI>pirit, have judged already, as tho' I were present, concerning him that hath
<PB N="14" REF="000661_0021_0FA99FDEAF3CF0F8"/>
done this Deed.</HI> He thought of them and their Affairs; tho' at a distance from them. So of the <HI>Colossians, Chap.</HI> 2. 5. <HI>Tho' I he absent in the Flesh, yet am I with you in the</HI> S<HI>pirit, Joying and</HI> B<HI>e∣holding your order, and the stedfastness of your Faith in Christ.</HI> He Rejoyced to behold their Graces by the eye of his mind, his Cogitations of them. And thus much of the Souls <HI>Faculties</HI> or <HI>Acts,</HI> for which sometimes the word <HI>Spirit</HI> is taken.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Spirit</HI> is Lastly taken for some <HI>Qua∣lifications,</HI> or <HI>Inclinations</HI> of the mind <HI>as United</HI> to the Body, and <HI>Conformed</HI> much thereunto.</P>
<P>This is the product of <HI>Nature, Acqui∣sition</HI> and <HI>Circumstances</HI> of Life, all which concur to form the <HI>GENIUS, Temper,</HI> or <HI>Disposition</HI> of man. Each man hath some∣thing <HI>peculiar</HI> to himself in this Respect; as he has in the Features of his Coun∣tenance, Stature, Shape, Meen or Car∣riage of his Body, whereby he is Dis∣tinguished from any other. So, if we ask, [What <HI>Spirit</HI> is he of?] we mean, of what Temper, Inclination or Geni∣us? How Disposed? How Qualified? And the true Answers will be as various, as men; of whom <HI>one</HI> man is (by Na∣ture,
<PB N="15" REF="000661_0022_0FA99FDF720D1470"/>
Acquisition, or both) of a sober, grave Spirit. <HI>Another</HI> of a Quick, Active, Chearful Spirit. <HI>Another</HI> of a weak, ti∣morous, Careful; <HI>Some</HI> are Gentiel, Ge∣nerous, Courteous, Open Hearted; <HI>O∣thers</HI> Churlish, Clownish, Surly, Rough, Close and Reserved, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> All these <HI>Spi∣rits</HI> are viciated by Corrupt Nature; and may by the Spirit of Grace be so Sanctified, as to Render men S<HI>erviceable,</HI> tho' in a <HI>different</HI> way, and of good acceptance both with God and man.</P>
<P>Now, <HI>This</HI> I take to be the <HI>most proper</HI> meaning of the word <HI>Spirit</HI> Here in the Text; And then the sense of it is,</P>
<P><Q>[I Pray God you may be wholly S<HI>ancti∣fyed</HI> in every <HI>Part</HI> and <HI>Faculty;</HI> every P<HI>ower, Natural</HI> &amp; <HI>Acquired;</HI> and being <HI>Sanctifyed</HI> may be wholy also <HI>preserved;</HI> In <HI>General</HI> your <HI>whole Spirit;</HI> All that gives any of you a Distinguishing Cha∣racter from other men; more <HI>Particularl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> your <HI>Soul</HI> (the <HI>forma hominis</HI>) the Inn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> part; and your <HI>Body</HI> (the <HI>materia ho∣minis</HI>) or Outer part, Both which are Included in the <HI>Spirit,</HI> which <HI>Results</HI> from both: The <HI>Faculties</HI> of the S<HI>oul,</HI> with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Habituations, or Improvements; and the <HI>Temperament</HI> of the <HI>Body,</HI> attend∣ed with <HI>Outward Circumstances,</HI> contribu∣ting
<PB N="16" REF="000661_0023_0FA99FE02E862BE8"/>
thereunto.]</Q> This I think is the Apostles meaning, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I rightly under∣stand him.</P>
<P>Having thus laid down the <HI>Notion in General,</HI> we shall Endeavour to make it plain, by opening some particulars▪ As</P>
<P N="1">1. There is in Scripture such a Distin∣ction between the <HI>Soul</HI> and <HI>Spirit,</HI> which we shall first shew by one place in the <HI>General,</HI> and after by more particularly in their proper places.</P>
<P>The place in <HI>General</HI> is that of <HI>Hebr.</HI> 4. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>2, 13. <HI>The Word of God is quick and pow∣erful, and sharper than any Two Edged Sword, piercing even to the Dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit, and of the Joynts and Marrow; and is a Discerner of the Thoughts, and In∣tents of the Heart; neither is there any Crea∣ture, that is not manifest in his sight, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This Dividing asunder of <HI>Soul</HI> and S<HI>pirit;</HI> Is it a Philosophical Distinction, of the Powers and Faculties, into S<HI>upe∣riour</HI> and <HI>Inferiour</HI> (as some would have it) I pray to what purpose? Is it to shew the S<HI>uperiour,</HI> as clear, and untainted by the Fall; but that the <HI>Inferiour</HI> and Bruit∣al, or sensual part is Vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iated and corrupt, as some of the Heathen Philosophers have confusedly suggested? They say in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> that <HI>NOU</HI>S (the mind▪) is <HI>Divina
<PB N="17" REF="000661_0024_0FA99FE12D5EF5B0"/>
auroe particula,</HI> a Sacred, and Divine Thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not inclined to any thing Disallowed by Right Reason; till it come to be Incarce∣rated in the Body: and then clogg'd by a Dull Material Flesh, and yoked with a couple of other silly Souls (the <HI>Sensitive</HI> of Brutes, and the <HI>Vegetative</HI> of <HI>P</HI>lants) It became obstructed in all vertuous aspiring; and born down to Sensual and Inferiour <HI>Acts</HI> and <HI>Objects.</HI> Thus they Dreamt; and does the Scripture give any Countenance to such Fancies? I think not.</P>
<P>I rather take it thus. The Apostle ha∣ving Exhorted them to study and use Di∣ligence, or <HI>Labour</HI> (as we read it) to En∣ter into the Rest before mentioned; Ta∣citly implies that this work should be done, with all Sincerity, for that they had to do herein with a Heart-searching God; This is manifest by the Energie of his Word, which openeth to a man the Secrets of his Soul; for the word is <HI>Living</HI> or <HI>Quick,</HI> &amp;c. As if he had said; God, who made man, knows him altogether, and better under∣stands what is in man, than man does what is in himself. Man has but Dark Apprehensions of himself, and therein oft times grosly does mistake; But God by his Word Searcheth intimately, and Dis∣covereth fully to him what he else would
<PB N="18" REF="000661_0025_0FA99FE2EA9A6710"/>
not take notice of: His <HI>Soul</HI> and S<HI>pirit</HI> lye close together (as do his <HI>Joynts</HI> and <HI>Mar∣row▪</HI>) But, as the <HI>Anatomists Knife</HI> lays open the <HI>one</HI> Difference; so the piercing Two Edged Sword of the W<HI>ord,</HI> does the <HI>other:</HI> That word shews him, How his S<HI>oul</HI> came pure out of the Hand of God; but he hath added thereto a vicious S<HI>pi∣rit,</HI> by the perverting of what God did make upright.</P>
<P>Let not man therefore charge God foo∣lishly, and say (as <HI>Adam</HI> did concerning <HI>Eve</HI>) From the S<HI>oul</HI> which thou gavest me all my faults do arise: No, It is from that Evil S<HI>pirit,</HI> which man hath to him∣self Acquired: His S<HI>oul</HI> indeed has the <HI>powers,</HI> but 'tis his Spirit that gives the <HI>In∣clinations,</HI> which (in a natural corrupt▪ State) are wholly bent unto Evil. Thus the <HI>Malady</HI> is opened and searched by the word, and the <HI>Cure</HI> is also by the same word prescribed: As here in the Text; Namely S<HI>anctification.</HI></P>
<P>And thus much for the <HI>first</HI> particular; That there is in Scripture such a <HI>Distinction,</HI> betwixt the S<HI>oul</HI> and <HI>Spirit.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That the <HI>Constitution</HI> of this S<HI>pirit</HI> or <HI>Genius,</HI> is an <HI>Aggregate</HI> or <HI>Resultant</HI> from the Connexion of divers things in Man: As his S<HI>ouls Faculties;</HI> his <HI>Bodies
<PB N="19" REF="000661_0026_0FA99FE32B62D3A8"/>
Tempera∣ment;</HI> His <HI>Acquired Habits,</HI> by Instructi∣ons, Examples, or Customes; And Last∣ly, The <HI>Outward Adjacents,</HI> or Circum∣stances of his present Life. A little of each of these.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Faculties</HI> of the S<HI>oul,</HI> (as Un∣derstanding, Will, Sensitive Appetite or Passions) are all Ingredients as the <HI>Sub∣strate Matter</HI> of this S<HI>pirit</HI> in Man; But the <HI>Modification</HI> of them is from the other Causes. <HI>Souls</HI> in themselves are all <HI>E∣qual;</HI> but the S<HI>pirits</HI> are vastly <HI>Different</HI> one from another. And this is from the particulars that follow, and in a chief manner from</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Temperament</HI> of the <HI>Body,</HI> which is (more or less) Different in e∣very Individual Man. As there are scarce Two Pebbles on the Sea Beach, or Two Chips hewen from the same wood, ex∣actly figured alike; Nay, As there are hardly Two Faces, Gestures, or M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of Men (which are the outward Indi∣ces of their Inward Constitutions) But doe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n some things Differ, tho' some are more alike than others: Even so it is with their <HI>Temperaments,</HI> which are a chief Ingredient into their <HI>Spirits,</HI> where∣of we now speak. That saying of Phi∣losophers [<HI>Manners of the Mind follow
<PB N="20" REF="000661_0027_0FA99FE3ECBDC410"/>
the Temperament of the</HI> B<HI>ody</HI>] is true if right∣ly understood with a due Temper, or (as we say) with a <HI>Grain of</HI> S<HI>alt:</HI> By M<HI>anners,</HI> we must understand, not the <HI>Vertues,</HI> or <HI>Vices</HI> themselves; But the <HI>Ge∣nius and Inclination,</HI> which leads and <HI>Dis∣poses</HI> to them. And that's the same with this our <HI>Spirit.</HI> Otherwise, skilful <HI>Phy∣sicians</HI> (who may perhaps have the worst Manners) might be accounted the best <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> &amp; they could easily mend all the wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld, who cannot mend themselves.</P>
<P>Nor must we understand by this, our Substrate Matter (the <HI>Faculties</HI> above∣mentioned) as if, The <HI>Body</HI> has an <HI>Oper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tive</HI> Influence upon the S<HI>oul</HI> to Induce (as it were) a new form upon it; for the S<HI>oul</HI> is the <HI>Active</HI> part, in Man, and the Body nothing so. But the thing stands thus.</P>
<P>The <HI>Soul,</HI> which is a <HI>True</HI> S<HI>pirit</HI> (in a Nobler Sense, than that whereof we are now treating) being, by its <HI>Information</HI> of the <HI>Body,</HI> most Intimately conjoyned thereun∣to; while it is in the State of Conjun∣ction, and Union in Man, <HI>Uses</HI> the Parts, Humours, and Members, as its <HI>In∣struments</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Organs,</HI> in all its Operations. Now a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a Workman Receiveth nothing of his strength or skill, from his Tools where∣with
<PB N="21" REF="000661_0028_0FA99FE4B2148A98"/>
with he works; yet in the Exercise of his Abilities he will find himself much furthered or hindred in his business, accor∣ding as his Tool is either Apt, or Unapt, for his Work. So is it in this Case: The <HI>Soul</HI> Recei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> no power from the <HI>Body;</HI> But in Exerting its own proper powers, is helped or hindred by the <HI>Bodys</HI> good or ill <HI>Temperament.</HI> Thus an <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l Tempered Brain</HI> makes that Soul Act like a Fool, or Ideot, which had it a Brain Well Temper∣ed, would be both prudent and sagacious. And so also the Temperament of the <HI>Heart, Blood,</HI> and <HI>Natural</HI> S<HI>pirits,</HI> gives Help, or Impediment to the <HI>Will</HI> and <HI>Af∣fections;</HI> even as, The <HI>Organs of Sense</HI> do, to their proper Senses. Hence that saying [<HI>Anima Galboe male habitat</HI>] The Brave Soul of <HI>Galba</HI> had but an Ill Lodging; He being a brave Spirited Man, but very sickly.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Acquired Habits</HI> do much Alter the <HI>Genius</HI> or <HI>Spirit,</HI> from what it would be, if men were left to their Pure Naturals. These Habits arise partly, (1) From <HI>In∣struction</HI> &amp; Rules: so Intellectual &amp; Moral Habits (whether good or evil) are formed much according to the Information men meet with, especially in their younger dayes. Thus (as to <HI>Advantage</HI>) every
<PB N="22" REF="000661_0029_0FA99FE57080F630"/>
part of <HI>Philosophy</HI> contributes its share; <HI>Logick</HI> and <HI>Metaphysicks,</HI> sharpness of Judg∣ment; <HI>Mathematicks</HI> Solidness and Sa∣gacity; <HI>Physicks</HI> good conjecture at the Reasons of things; <HI>Moral Philosophy</HI> and <HI>History,</HI> Prudence; <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etorick,</HI> Fairness and Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idence of Address; <HI>Poetry,</HI> quickness of fancy, and <HI>Imagination;</HI> Any of these as they are better studied, do according∣ly Enable and Incline the mind of Man.</P>
<Q><HI>Didicisse fidelite<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Artes &amp;c.</HI></Q>
<P>And so on the Contrary (as to <HI>Disad∣vantage</HI>) All vicious and erroneous Prin∣ciples, foolish and vain traditions, and such like evil Rudiments, being Instilled into Youth, do Taint and Darken the Judg∣ment, Debauch the Will &amp; Affections, and Debase the whole S<HI>pirit and Genius</HI> of the Man.</P>
<P N="2">2. From <HI>Pattern.</HI> Example, and Con∣verse, with People, make deeper impressi∣on then Rules, and have a very great in∣fluence in forming the <HI>Genius;</HI> especially of Youth, when they are stepping from Boy to Man, and are taking upon them to ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se their own way; then, (if ever) <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ltu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Refert quocum vixeris;</HI> it concerns you to think where you dwell. The force of Example is set forth in that (<HI>Prov.</HI> 22. 24. 25.) <HI>Make no friendship with an angry

man,</HI> and <HI>with a furious man thou shalt not go; Lest thou learn his way, and get a snare to thy soul.</HI> Tis called a <HI>Snare;</HI> tho' the ill∣favoured humour be no plausible bait <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o allure; yet for that, all C<HI>ustom</HI> has a secret and fascinating Insinuation, whereby, at least, the <HI>Aversation</HI> and Abhorrence of Ill things, to which we are enured is ve∣ry much abated. So as, not only the <HI>Vices</HI> themselves under some sal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e name (such as Gallantry of Spirit, Greatness of Soul, Scorning to take an injury, <HI>&amp;c▪</HI>) put fair for an approbation, and are conta∣gious; But even the <HI>Inclinations</HI> to them, &amp; <HI>preparation of Spirit</HI> for them, do common∣ly spread themselves from one person to a∣nother.</P>
<P>And, so also (in some measure, tho' not casually) may we expect in things of a <HI>better Character. Prov.</HI> 13▪ 20. <HI>He that walketh with the wise shall be wise,</HI> &amp;c. Which place (I think) does not only intimate Gods usual Blessing upon fit means, but also discovers those proper means, which in their own Nature are apt to operate, in a Moral way upon the minds of men: not indeed to give the <HI>Truth</HI> of Grace; for then all in Godly Families would be Religious, &amp; Leave no ground for that complaint, I<HI>n the Land of upright∣ness
<PB N="24" REF="000661_0031_0FA99FE6EF187CF0"/>
will he deal unjustly. Isa.</HI> 26. 10. And the contrary (too often) do we find by sad experience. Nor are those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>air Dispositi∣ons, which Conversation may work, such <HI>Preparations</HI> for Grace, as doth oblige God (<HI>ex congruo</HI>) to give the <HI>Truth</HI> thereof; but only the whole is this; If God please to give his <HI>Supernatural</HI> Grace, to one, that has fair <HI>Natural Dispositions;</HI> Those Graces will the more Illustriously, appear, to Render a Man the more Eminently Serviceable.</P>
<P>Add to this our daily Experience, and common observation; that men are much what the Custom and usual practice of the place is, where they live. He that is bred, or much conversant, in the coun∣try; gets there a simple plain heartedness; or perhaps a Rough Rusticity: He that is much in the City, has more of Civility, Sagacity, and Cunning. One, who lives where News is frequently Talked, Gets somewhat of a Publick Spirit: Amongst good natured People, a Candid Spirit. Amongst Souldiers, a Bold and Boysterous one; And so of all other Affections: which may be considered in an Indiffe∣rency; Neither morally Good nor Bad, in themselves; but only as Sanctification or Corruption makes the Difference.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="25" REF="000661_0032_0FA99FE7B3AEAAC8"/>
4. <HI>Outward Circumstances</HI> do also Ex∣ceedingly vary <HI>mens spirits,</HI> and that in a shorter space of time, then <HI>Habits</HI> use to do. Thus <HI>Prosperity,</HI> Wealth, Honour, Health, friends <HI>&amp;c.</HI> do commonly enlarge the mind of a man; and make him bold and brisk: Whereas the contrary <HI>Poverty,</HI> Disgrace, Sickness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> do usu∣ally Contract and Emasculate the <HI>Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>If these are of a long continued Series, they do very much towards the forming of a setled and fixed <HI>Genius.</HI> But if only Occasionally, or at certain times they oc∣cur; then they vary and <HI>Contemperate</HI> the <HI>Setled</HI> S<HI>pirit</HI> for a season; and per∣haps become a means to Reduce it to a better <HI>Mediocrity.</HI> Thus one of a Light and Airy Spirit, and for the most part in all good Circumstances, (may at such times) be unmanageable by Advice; until perhaps, a particular sore Affliction, hath somewhat abated of his Gallantry, and opened his Ear to Instruction, where∣by his <HI>Spirit</HI> may be better Regulated for the future.</P>
<P>And thus much for the Aggregation or Resultance, of this our S<HI>pirit,</HI> from the concurrence of divers things, both within, and without the Man.</P>

Explaining of our <HI>General Notion,</HI> shall be the taking Notice; That all these do some way concurr to Constitute and Re∣present the Man, <HI>Abstracted</HI> from <HI>Grace</HI> and S<HI>in;</HI> yet the Internals and Essentials of <HI>Soul</HI> and <HI>Body,</HI> have the <HI>principal</HI> stroak herein: And then, that the other matters, that are <HI>External</HI> to the Essence of man; the Accidental Inherents, and Adjacents; do but somewhat <HI>Modify</HI> and <HI>Affect</HI> the former constitution, which will still ap∣pear in some Degree or other.</P>
<L><HI>Naturam Expellas, furca licet, ipsa recurret.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Drive Nature out with Pitch forks; twill Return,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And act its part, as sure as fire will Burn.</HI></L>
<P>And, because the <HI>Soules</HI> Primitive facultyes are supposed to be all Equal in every man; tis the <HI>Bodyes Temperament,</HI> that especially gives the great Diversity in Mens S<HI>pirits;</HI> we shall therefore speak of these more Distinctly; And that not Exactly according to the common four <HI>First Qualityes</HI> (Hot and Dry, Cold and Moyst) which are said, by their Mixture, to give the four <HI>Complexions</HI> (Sanguine, Cholerick, Melancholy, and Phlegmatick) of which Physicians do so often speak. But I shall Treat of them, ac∣cording
<PB N="27" REF="000661_0034_0FA99FE92DA5F190"/>
to the <HI>Actives</HI> (<HI>Hot,</HI> and <HI>Cold,</HI>) with a <HI>Mean</HI> Temper between them; Taking notice of the other By the way, only as occasion is offered. For it is not <HI>Physical</HI> composition, or <HI>Medical</HI> Dispositi∣on of spirits, which we have now to do with; But S<HI>pirits</HI> as they Relate to Humane and Moral Actions; into which these three (<HI>Hot, Cold,</HI> and <HI>Mean</HI>) have the greatest Influence. Besides, all men will admit of a Hotter, and a Cooler Temperament; even those who Reject Elementary Mixtures; and have no great Regard to the four Complexions. If a∣ny like better to have it expressed by <HI>Matter,</HI> more or less, moveable or moved; They may please themselves. There is no Difference in the <HI>Thing,</HI> however Ex∣pressions vary.</P>
<P>I say therefore; some mens Spirits are <HI>Hot,</HI> and they do commonly <HI>Act warmly;</HI> Others are <HI>Cold,</HI> and they usually <HI>Act Cooly;</HI> Others have a S<HI>pirit</HI> of a fine <HI>Mean</HI> between these two Extreams, and their Actions are <HI>participant</HI> of both qualificati∣ons; <HI>viciously,</HI> it Unsanctified, and under natural Corruption; <HI>vertuously,</HI> if Sanctifi∣ed, and mens Spirits be guided, and acted by the Spirit of God: All common∣ly according to their several Capacities:
<PB N="28" REF="000661_0035_0FA99FEA5C47CEA0"/>
But if at any time a man be acted con∣trary to his peculiar <HI>Genius,</HI> 'tis by a spe∣cial hand of the Good or Evil Spirit up∣on him; some special Instigation, and Assistance, upon a particular occasion. And according to this Method we shall Treat of the several Spirits; first Descri∣bing <HI>themselves,</HI> and then their S<HI>tates,</HI> both of <HI>Unregeneracy</HI> and S<HI>anctification.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The more <HI>Hot</HI> S<HI>pirit</HI> Discovers it self in Chearfulness, Activity, Courage, and Angry Zeal or Jealousy.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Chearfulness:</HI> Heat joyned with a convenient Moisture (answerable to the S<HI>anguine</HI> Complexion) Renders a man Chearful, Vivid, Sprightly, and upon occa∣sion (with apt Circumstances) Joyous, Refreshed, Merry and Comfortable. It makes him look Ruddy, and of a Beau∣tiful Countenance (like <HI>David</HI> in the flower of his Youth) and pleasant, like the face of all things in the Spring. <HI>Da∣vid</HI> (we may suppose) was of a Natural Chearful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it: His <HI>Musical</HI> Inclination, whereby his skill was great, seems to speak so much: for this, and his <HI>prudence in matters</HI> (so we Read in the Text, but in the Margin <HI>prudent of</HI> S<HI>peech.</HI> 1 Sam. 16. 18.) for these things (I say) He was sent for by S<HI>aul;</HI> that so his Musick
<PB N="29" REF="000661_0036_0FA99FECF8097580"/>
and his prudent Mirth, might Drive away S<HI>auls</HI> Evil (Melancholly) Spirit. This Chearful Spirit, as it was, in <HI>Young David, Natural;</HI> so it was in <HI>Old Jacob,</HI> upon occa∣sion; when he heard good News of <HI>Joseph,</HI> and saw the Waggons that were sent for him, (<HI>Gen.</HI> 45. 27.) 'tis said, <HI>The Spirit of Jacob their Father Revived.</HI> Such also were the <HI>Refreshed</HI> S<HI>pirits</HI> mentioned, 1 <HI>Cor</HI> 16. 17, 18. I <HI>am glad of the coming of For∣tunatus, for they have Refreshed my Spirit and Yours.</HI> And that of <HI>Titus</HI> his Joy, (2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. 13. B<HI>ecause his Spirit was Refreshed by you all.</HI></P>
<P>The meaning of all is: Their Spirits were Chearful and Vivid, upon these Comfortable occasions. The S<HI>pirit</HI> also signifyes Health and strength; as in the Hunger▪starved <HI>Egyptian</HI> (1. <HI>Sam:</HI> 30) who being left sick (<HI>v</HI> 13) having now Eaten and Drank, after the three Days fasting; tis said (<HI>v</HI> 12. <HI>His spirit came again to him;</HI> that is, He had now some life in him, and could do something like himself; who before was as one Dead, with sadness and Desperation; But now Doubtless, was glad that he was alive.</P>
<P>This <HI>Chearful</HI> S<HI>pirit,</HI> If <HI>Unsanctifyed and Corrupt,</HI> is groslyabused to <HI>Levity,</HI> froth, vanity, and foolish Jesting, which is not
<PB N="30" REF="000661_0037_0FA99FEDB703DCC0"/>
convenient: To <HI>Lasciviousness</HI> in them, who make <HI>Provision for the flesh to fulfil the Lusts thereof:</HI> To <HI>Pride</HI> &amp; Haughtiness, self co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it and glorying in their own strength and Beauty; to <HI>forgetfulness of God feeding themselves without fear;</HI> yea, to wax fat and Kick against their Maker; and <HI>Rejoyce in their</HI> B<HI>oastings; But all such Rejoy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ings are evil. James</HI> 4. 16.</P>
<P>But If S<HI>anctifyed,</HI> The <HI>Joy of their Spirit</HI> becomes <HI>Spiritual Joy;</HI> Like <HI>Marys</HI> (<HI>L</HI>uke 1. 46. 47.) <HI>My</HI> S<HI>oul doth Magnify the Lord, And my Spirit hath Rejoyced in God my</HI> S<HI>avi∣our.</HI> It Disposeth them to <HI>Thankfulness,</HI> and adapts for Praysing and Glorifying of God. It fits men for Chearful Service to him; which much commends Religi∣on to the World, who are apt to be fright∣ed from it by Conceits of nothing but Mortification and Self Denial therein. Chearful Christianity adds a Lustre to Pro∣fession; and convinces men, That they may be merry and wise.</P>
<P>Now, tho' this doth chiefly arise from the Testimony of a Good <HI>Conscience,</HI> and the Sealings of the Comforting S<HI>pirit of Adoption;</HI> yet <HI>Subservient</HI> thereunto is this our Natural Spirit, which Renders men more apt outwardly to express it. <HI>David</HI> was (as is before noted) of this Sanguine
<PB N="31" REF="000661_0038_0FA99FEE6FDD6EE8"/>
and Cheerful temper; and he did Emi∣nently Glorify God by his Musick and Psalmody; agreeable to the Apostles Rule James 5. 13. I<HI>s any among you merry, Let him sing Psalms.</HI> This of Cheerful∣ness.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Activity</HI> is another effect of the <HI>Hotter Spirit;</HI> it shews it self in a willingness and readiness to be employed; as also some∣times in strong inclinations and vigorous motions; in a great inquisitiveness and earnest search after things that are out of common view. This Temper is very na∣tural to Youth, which is usually fitter for <HI>Execution</HI> then <HI>Deliberation;</HI> and because of <HI>this Spirit</HI> tis called the <HI>Sprightliest</HI> time of mens Lives.</P>
<P>This <HI>Active Spirit,</HI> while <HI>Unsanctifyed</HI> is (like as in a brisk Monkey) a very un∣lucky thing; It <HI>renders</HI> men Idle Busy-Bodys; Medlers with other Mens Matters; Grievously Troublesome, both to the Church and World; Restless in themselves; and suffering none to be quiet by them; this fruitful Soyl uncultivated, brings forth a multitude of Weeds; if set upon mis∣cheif, <HI>one</HI> such will do more then <HI>many</HI> o∣thers; like the active Element of <HI>Fire,</HI> where it is not employed in profitable Ser∣vice, it works Destruction and Desolation.
<PB N="32" REF="000661_0039_0FA99FEF2F8B47A8"/>
The <HI>Inquisitiveness,</HI> that attends such un∣sanctified Spirits, does often make men S<HI>ee∣kers</HI> in Religion; never satisfied with set∣led Truths, but <HI>Scepticks,</HI> Rambling and Uncomposed <HI>Sectarys,</HI> tossed about with e∣very wind of Doctrine; or, if they hap to be S<HI>ect-Masters,</HI> they'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> compass Sea and Land to make a Proselyte. In a word; They are the <HI>nimblest</HI> S<HI>ervants</HI> of the Devil, and notable<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Instruments he can find, to make use of, in the world.</P>
<P>But if <HI>Sanctified,</HI> Then, none so <HI>Service∣able</HI> to God, or Man. Such S<HI>pirits</HI> will make men <HI>wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ling</HI> to do Service. (as <HI>Exo.</HI> 35. 21.) <HI>They came every one, whose Heart stirred him up; and every one, whose</HI> S<HI>pirit made him willing;</HI> and <HI>they brought the Lords Offering to the work of the Tabernacle.</HI> 'Tis not said, [whom <HI>Gods Spirit</HI> made willing] Tho' that is most true, as to the <HI>First Cause;</HI> But [<HI>whose Spirit made him willing, whose heart stirred him up</HI>] That is, his <HI>own</HI> Spirit, being <HI>Sanctified</HI> by the Spirit of God: Here the <HI>Second Cause</HI> is noted, being stirred up by the <HI>First.</HI> And indeed God often W<HI>arms</HI> and <HI>Raises up</HI> mens Spirits for any noble Designs, in which he intends to use them. So in those (<HI>Ezra</HI> 1. 1.) <HI>The Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tirred up the</HI> S<HI>pirit of Cyrus,</HI> and
<PB N="33" REF="000661_0040_0FA99FEFF0920948"/>
then <HI>Cyrus</HI> communicates of his warmth, to stir up the Spirit of the poor Dispirited Jews. (<HI>v.</HI> 3.) <HI>Who is there among you of all the People?</HI> What? Have you never a <HI>Brave</HI> Man among you to undertake this <HI>Great &amp; Worthy</HI> affair? Upon this <HI>Giving Fire</HI> their Spirits were Enflamed, <HI>Then r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se up the chief of the Fathers, the Priests and the Levites, with all them, whose</HI> S<HI>pirit God had Raised to go up</HI> (<HI>v.</HI> 5.) Not <HI>All</HI> the People, but some <HI>Chief</HI> men: men (its likely) that were of <HI>Large Souls,</HI> act∣ive and Gallant Spirits in themselves, fitted for Noble designs; but (alas;) they were so shrunk, and sunk by their long Captivity, that neither <HI>In nate</HI> briskness, nor the <HI>Encouragement</HI> which <HI>Cyrus</HI> gave them, was sufficient to Chirp them up, till God <HI>Sanctifyed their</HI> S<HI>pirits,</HI> and raised them above themselves to this Pious and Noble undertaking. Two of them are mentioned <HI>by Name</HI> (besides others, Hag. 1. 14.) <HI>The Lord stirred up the</HI> S<HI>pirit of</HI> Zerubbabel, <HI>the Governour; &amp;</HI> Joshua, <HI>the High Priest;</HI> and <HI>the Spirit of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Rem∣nant of the People,</HI> and they came and did work in the house. Now, was it the S<HI>ouls</HI> of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e men? Or, the <HI>men them∣selves?</HI> Methinks tis more Genuine, <HI>The Spirits</HI> of those men in the sense we now propose▪</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="000661_0041_0FA99FF0B116DD30"/>
This <HI>Active Spirit,</HI> uses to discover and express it self (as is befere noted) in a strong Inclination, <HI>&amp;</HI> vigorous Motion. <HI>Elihu</HI> speaks of a <HI>Spirit</HI> in man (<HI>Job</HI> 32 8.) which I suppose is the same, to which he hath Reference. (<HI>v.</HI> 18.) <HI>I am full of matter</HI> (or words) <HI>and the Spi∣rit within me</HI> (or of my Belly) <HI>constrai∣neth me</HI> (<HI>v.</HI> 20.) <HI>I will speak, that I may be refreshed.</HI> Now <HI>Elihu</HI> was the <HI>youngest</HI> of <HI>Jobs</HI> Friends, as he himself intimates (<HI>v.</HI> 6, 7.) and upon that account, in part, he is more earnest, and copious, then the rest; the Ardour, and Activity of his Spirit, caused an eager desire in him to express his mind; which he calls the <HI>Constraining of his Spirit.</HI> But be∣cause there was somewhat of <HI>anger</HI> in the case, (besides his <HI>Youthful Warmth</HI>) we shall have occasion to reflect upon this instance again; and then shew more of this vigorous Motion, and strong Incli∣nation, under the Head of Z<HI>eal,</HI> to which we shall referr it.</P>
<P N="3">3. This <HI>Hotter Spirit,</HI> is a Spirit of <HI>Courage</HI> &amp; <HI>Boldness,</HI> to address Difficultys, and meet with Evil.</P>
<P>This shews it self divers ways.</P>
<P N="1">1. Sometimes in a wrath for <HI>War;</HI> which God S<HI>tirs up</HI> or <HI>Abates,</HI> as is a∣greeable
<PB N="35" REF="000661_0042_0FA99FF16FC81610"/>
to his own holy purposes. Thus to Impoverish, take, and lead Captive the Idolatrous <HI>Israelites,</HI> (1 Chron. 5. 26.) <HI>The God of</HI> Israel, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tirred up the Spirit of Pull, King of Assyria, and Tilgath</HI> P<HI>ilne∣ser King of Assyria, and he carried them away.</HI> The former took their Goods 2 King. 15. 19.) <HI>Menahem gave Pull</HI> a Thousand Talents of Silver (that is an Hundred and Eighty Seven Thousand, One Hun∣dred pounds) <HI>And he turned back, and staid not in the Land.</HI> This was a Vast S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m; But the other came and swept all both Goods, and Persons too.</P>
<P>On the other hand, He <HI>Abates</HI> also Mens Courage, and takes down their <HI>Spirits. He shall cut off the Spirit of Prin∣ces; He is terrible to the Kings of the Earth</HI> (psal. 76. 12.) Thus <HI>Moses</HI> Prophecy of the Dukes of <HI>Edom,</HI> and Inhabi∣tants of <HI>Canaan</HI> (Exod. 15. 16.) <HI>Fear and Dread shall fall upon them, by the greatness of thine Arm; they shall be as still, as a stone, till thy People pass o∣ver, O Lord.</HI> And to the same ef∣fect is that Promise, (Ex. 11: 7.) <HI>But against any of the Children of Israel, shall not a Dog move his Tongue.</HI> The Geni∣us and Spirit of a Dog, is (you▪ know) to Bark at Strangers: This is an effect
<PB N="36" REF="000661_0043_0FA99FF22F615560"/>
of Heat and Boldness in that Animal, where it is but a little afraid; but if it be greatly Terrifyed, it will then Run and hide it self in silence: So some Men, that would in their wicked In∣clinations, both Bite and Devour, may be yet so far over awed by Gods Pro∣vidence, that they dare not so much as Bark at his People.</P>
<P N="2">2. Sometimes in a stout Resolvedness of Mind, that will take no discouragement; this is to have <HI>a Heart like that of a Ly∣on</HI> (2. <HI>Sam.</HI> 17. 16.) Now a Lyon, <HI>when a multitude of Shepheards is called forth against him, will not be afraid of their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them</HI> (<HI>Isay,</HI> 31. 4,)</P>
<P>The contrary hereunto is a S<HI>pirit fai∣ling</HI> (I<HI>sa.</HI> 19. 3.) <HI>The</HI> S<HI>pirit of</HI> AE<HI>gypt shall fail</HI> (or be emptied) <HI>in the midst thereof;</HI> tis said in the Precedent (<HI>v</HI> 2) I <HI>will set</HI> AE<HI>gyptians, against</HI> AE<HI>gyptians, &amp; they shall fight:</HI> They shall spend their Spirits, or Courage among themselves; but shall have no Spirits left to defend their Country. So tis said of the <HI>A∣morites</HI> and <HI>Canaanites,</HI> that heard of the drying up of <HI>Jordan,</HI> which they accounted as their <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate</HI> and <HI>Fence</HI> a∣gainst
<PB N="37" REF="000661_0044_0FA99FF2F080C750"/>
I<HI>srael, Their heart melted neither was there</HI> S<HI>pirit in them any more</HI> (<HI>Josh.</HI> 5: 1:) So that you see both ways, in the <HI>Abundance</HI> and in the <HI>Defect, Spirit,</HI> Signifies Courage and Resolu∣tion.</P>
<P>Now if this Spirit be <HI>Unsanctifyed,</HI> tis a stoutness in evil: that will be ready to say, (with <HI>Pharoah</HI>) <HI>Who is the Lord?</HI> Tis Obstinacy and Hardning; <HI>Sihon King of Heshbon would not let us pass; for the Lord had hardned his Spirit, and made his Heart Obstinate</HI> (<HI>Deut.</HI> 2. 30.) This may be also the meaning of the <HI>perverse Spirit min∣gled among the Egyptians,</HI> (<HI>Isa.</HI> 19 14.) that is, a quarrelsome and contentious Spirit, among themselves, whereby their Councils were Divided, and their Affairs Unsetled, <HI>as a Drunken Man staggereth in his Vomit:</HI> They had S<HI>pirit,</HI> or Animo∣sity, enough against one the other; but for <HI>Publik</HI> defence, AE<HI>gypt shall be like unto Women, they shall be afraid and fear</HI> (<HI>v</HI> 16) And this Discovers one fault more, in this <HI>Unsanctified</HI> S<HI>pirit.</HI> That it is <HI>Un∣stable:</HI> Stout and Surly, were it should be Humble and Meek; Mean and Poor; where it should be Brave, and Resolute. Such were the Rebellious Israelites (<HI>Ps.</HI> 78. 8.) <HI>a stubborn and rebellious Genera∣tion,
<PB N="38" REF="000661_0045_0FA99FF3AF3DB830"/>
that set not their hearts aright, whose</HI> S<HI>pirit was not</HI> S<HI>tedfast with God.</HI> It follows (<HI>v.</HI> 9.) that, how Sturdy soever they were against God; yet against their Enemies they were very Cowards, or God, in Jus∣tice made them so, for their Stubborness against him. <HI>The Children of Ephraim be∣ing Armed, and carrying</HI> B<HI>ows, turned back in the day of Battel.</HI></P>
<P>But, If <HI>Sanctified,</HI> 'tis an <HI>Excellent Spirit,</HI> and of great use. This was that <HI>o∣ther</HI> S<HI>pirit</HI> of <HI>Caleb</HI> (Numb: 14. 24.) The Spirit of the other Spies was Base and Cowardly, and caused the heart of the <HI>People to melt</HI> (Josh. 18. 8.) at which God was greatly displeased; but <HI>Calebs</HI> cou∣rage was approved, and accepted of God, tho' it had not its desired effect upon men; and was Rewarded with admission into the Land of Promise, when others were excluded.</P>
<P>This Spirit S<HI>anctified,</HI> is a Spirit Bound Bent, and Resolved, in the service of God what-ever be the Hazards. <HI>And now b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hold</HI> (says <HI>Paul</HI>) I <HI>go bound in the Spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing the</HI> (par∣ticular) <HI>things, that shall befal me there</HI> (Act 20. 22.) <HI>saving Bonds and Afflictions</HI> (in
<PB N="39" REF="000661_0046_0FA99FF47312CC70"/>
general) which I expect (<HI>v.</HI> 23.) <HI>But none of these things move me</HI> (<HI>v.</HI> 24.) Now this B<HI>ound Spirit</HI> I take to be, the Apo∣stles <HI>Brave</HI> Spirit <HI>Bound</HI> (that is) strong∣ly inclined by the Spirit of God to this special, and particular, Service, not∣withstanding all these foreseen difficul∣ties, to break thorow which he was G<HI>allantly</HI> Resolved. And this his Cou∣rage is (I think) the same, that he prays might be given to the <HI>Ephesians,</HI> chap. 3. 16. <HI>That he would grant you, accor∣ding to the Riches of his Glory to be strength∣ned with might, by his</HI> S<HI>pirit, in the</HI> I<HI>nner Man.</HI> This referrs to (<HI>v.</HI> 13) <HI>I desire that ye faint not, at my Tribulations for you.</HI> Some men are so Weak-Spirited, as to faint, when they see another Bleed; or have a grievous Wound dressed, or the like; But I would not have you to be so Feeble-Minded; I would have you more Couragious; and for that end, make this prayer on your behalf; <HI>I</HI> should ra∣ther shrink that <HI>feel</HI> the trouble; then <HI>you,</HI> that only <HI>behold</HI> it with your eyes.</P>
<P>Such another <HI>Brave</HI> S<HI>pirit was in Ne∣hemiah,</HI> when God had raised it up. See a taste of it (<HI>Neh.</HI> 6: 11.) S<HI>hould such a</HI> M<HI>an as</HI> I <HI>Fly?</HI> And <HI>who is there being

as</HI> I <HI>am, would go into the Temple to save his Life?</HI> I <HI>will not go in.</HI> This Gallan∣try was of the Lord; for (whatever his <HI>Naturl</HI> S<HI>pirit</HI> was) His C<HI>aptive circum∣stances</HI> had rendred him but weak; as we may Guess by his <HI>Timorousness</HI> to speak to the King (tho' he was in good place about him) He continually <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etch'd his strength from God; He was fain (by <HI>Ejac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lation</HI>) to pray between a Question and an Answer (<HI>chap.</HI> 2. 4.) <HI>What is thy</HI> R<HI>equest?</HI> S<HI>o</HI> I <HI>Prayed= And</HI> I <HI>said</HI> &amp;c. He had not Courage to give the King an answer; till he had his Spirits Revived by the God of Heaven.</P>
<P N="4">4. This <HI>Hotter</HI> S<HI>pirit</HI> is an <HI>Angry</HI> S<HI>pirit</HI> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ardent and Fervent in it self; Eager and Vigorous in motion; with a vehe∣mence in Inclinations (all which may be better Referred to this head, then that of <HI>Activity,</HI> before mentioned) Its chief ingredient is C<HI>hollerick</HI> Constitution tho' it may be also <HI>Habitually</HI> encreased, and <HI>Morally Fixt</HI> in men, by frequent <HI>oc∣casions</HI> and provocations; as also by much <HI>converse,</HI> with peevish and fretful persons this is intimated in that (<HI>Prov.</HI> 22. 24. 25,) <HI>Make no friendship with an angry man, &amp; with a furious man thou shalt not

go; Lest thou Learn his ways, and get a snare to thy</HI> S<HI>oul.</HI> His anger will, by degrees heat thy Spirit into a Disorder; or, at least bring it into another frame; then to what thou art naturally inclined.</P>
<P>This Spirit Acts, and shews it self in Z<HI>EAL, and JEALOUSY.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Z<HI>eal,</HI> is a Fervour of Spirit, where∣by a man does Act (<HI>Valide &amp; Valde</HI>) All that comes to his hand, he present∣ly does it with his <HI>Might.</HI> Here <HI>An∣ger</HI> is (<HI>Cos Fortitudinis</HI>) the Whetstone of Valour; And tho' Courage hath its <HI>Strength</HI> in it self, yet it commonly has the <HI>beginning,</HI> and more often the <HI>conti∣nuance</HI> of its motion, from this Z<HI>eal.</HI> This is as the <HI>Touch▪Powder,</HI> that catches the first Fire, and as soon inflames that which has all the force in it.

<P>The Hearts of those Jews were so Callous and Hard, that they needed to be warmly fomented.

<P>Sullen <HI>Discontent</HI> we may see in <HI>proud Haman,</HI> who, (whatever his Natural Spirit was) had a very Jolly one upon the Kings Favour. <HI>Haman went forth that Day, Joyful, and with a Glad Heart.</HI> (Esth. 5.9.) <HI>That Day,</HI> It seems it was not always so; (Aspiring Pride, and Sowerness of Spirit, are frequently con∣joyned; because of the many obstructi∣ons

Real, and more apprehended, that cross his Ambition) But <HI>That Day,</HI> and upon that particular <HI>Occasion,</HI> he was very Merry. This in him was <HI>Unsanctifyed,</HI> and therefore Unstable and soon Altered to the contrary, by a very slight matter; for after he had Boasted among his Friends of all his Riches and Glory: <HI>yet</HI> (saith he) <HI>All this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecat the Jew sitting at the Kings Gate.</HI> (<HI>v.</HI> 13.)

<P>Another such an Instance of <HI>Sullenness</HI> was C<HI>ovetous Ahab,</HI> whose S<HI>pirit was sad,</HI> because he was Denyed <HI>Naboth's</HI> Vineyard (1 <HI>King</HI> 21. 5.) which caused him to Loll <HI>on his Bed, turn away his face, and would not eat</HI> B<HI>read</HI> (like a pouting Child) vext at heart, that he could not have his

One would have thought, that these Wo∣men (because of the Natural Coldness and Moysture of their Sex) should have been Authors of milder Counsels; But their Unsanctifyed Hearts, being filled with Devillish Pride, makes them act contrary to that, which should be their very Nature; so virulent are Feminine Humours, when Corruption (on occasi∣on) turns them into <HI>Acids.</HI> Dismissing these Two, as they are; you may (if you please) send in <HI>Jobs</HI> Wife; with her <HI>Curse God and</HI> D<HI>ie,</HI> (Job 2. 9.) to make up the Number, <HI>All. (Tria sunt om∣nia.)</HI> Note only (by the way) That <HI>Old Wives Prescriptions,</HI> are seldome good Re∣medies, for sad and melancholly Husbands. And this of <HI>Sullen Discontent.</HI></P>
<P>Of the <HI>Froward</HI> P<HI>eevishness,</HI> in this Colder and Mournful Spirit, we have a Notable Instance in the <HI>Israelites;</HI> who could not hear what was <HI>Reasonable,</HI> and might be <HI>Comfortable,</HI> to them. God by <HI>Moses</HI> had sent them a very good and Gracious Word; A Promise of their De∣liverance; of being their God, and ta∣king
<PB N="59" REF="000661_0066_0FA9A005B259A218"/>
them to be his People; <HI>And Moses spake so, unto the Children of Israel; But they hearkened not unto Moses, for Anguish</HI> (or Shortness) of Spirit, and <HI>for Cruel Bondage,</HI> which was the occasion thereof. (<HI>Exod.</HI> 16. 9.) They were in this <HI>Like</HI> weeping <HI>Rachel,</HI> who <HI>Refused,</HI> and <HI>would not be Comforted.</HI> (<HI>Mat.</HI> 2. 18.)</P>
<P>From these <HI>Instances</HI> (besides frequent <HI>Experience,</HI>) we may Learn, That the <HI>Consequents</HI> of a sad <HI>Unsanctifyed Spirit</HI> are Deplorable; All manner of Evil, <HI>Natural, Moral</HI> and <HI>Judicial. Natural</HI> and <HI>Moral</HI> seem to be pointed at in that Expression (2 Cor. 7. 10.) <HI>The sorrow of the world worketh Death.</HI> This may referr to both; 'tis both a <HI>Sin</HI> and a <HI>Mischief;</HI> as appears by the <HI>Antitheta</HI> (in the former part of the verse.) <HI>Godly Sorrow worketh Repen∣tance to</HI> S<HI>alvation, not to be Repented of;</HI> Therefore (by the Rule of contraries) Worldly Sorrow is S<HI>in,</HI> unto <HI>Destruction,</HI> and to be Repented of by those, who would avoid those Evils. But more ex∣presly is it <HI>Judicial,</HI> when God pronoun∣ces it as a Curse. <HI>Ye shall Cry for sorrow of heart, and shall Howl for vexation</HI> (or Breaking. marg.) <HI>of Spirit.</HI> (Isa. 65. 14) This if <HI>Unsanctified.</HI></P>

<P>The greatest Instance (in mee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> man) of a <HI>sorrowful</HI> S<HI>pirit,</HI> was that of <HI>Job,</HI> in the Days of his Tryal; His Complaint he Uttere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h freely, and Justi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yeth his so doing, as of a natural Necessity: His Case was sad; <HI>His</HI> S<HI>pirit was Drunk up,</HI> (<HI>ch.</HI> 6. 4.) <HI>Drunk up</HI> (as he expresses it) That he had <HI>None Left</HI> to bear his Trou∣bles. <HI>The Spirit of a man will bear his In∣firmity</HI> (<HI>P</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o. 18 14.) But (alas) his <HI>Bearing Spirit</HI> is gone, and nothing but a Broken and Burthened one is Left in him: In this case, he says, <HI>I will not Re∣frain my mouth; I will speak in the Anguish of my Spirit; I will complain in the Bitterness of my</HI> S<HI>oul</HI> (ch. 7. 11.) But his Com∣plaint is <HI>To God,</HI> and not <HI>Of God. As for me, is my Complaint to man? And if it were so, why should not my</HI> S<HI>pirit be Troubled?</HI> (ch. 21. 4.) And yet, we may

say of him in all this, as was testified of him in the beginning, <HI>In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly</HI> (ch. 1. 22.) Altho' Satan expected it from him. (<HI>v.</HI> 11 and ch: 25.) which indeed he would have done, had not God <HI>Sanctified</HI> his <HI>sorrowful Spirit:</HI> and <HI>preserv∣ed it Blameless.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Nebuchadnezzar Dreamed Dreams, wherewith his</HI> S<HI>pirit was Troubled.</HI> [<HI>Dan.</HI> 2. 1.] We find this <HI>Unsanctified</HI> Hea∣then fret and vex, and require unreaso∣nable things: <HI>The Thing is gone from me</HI> I have quite forgot it; yet, <HI>Tell me the Dream, and the</HI> I<HI>nterpretation, or ye shall be cut in pieces, and your Houses made a Dung∣hil.</HI> (v. 5.) So eager was he to be Rid of his <HI>Troubled</HI> S<HI>pirit.</HI> But <HI>Daniel</HI> thro' <HI>Sanctification</HI> was of another Temper in the like case. (ch. 7. 15.) <HI>I Daniel was grieved in my Spirit, in the midst of my Body</HI> (or sheath) <HI>and the Visions of my Head troubled me.</HI> He then seeks for sa∣tisfaction from <HI>God,</HI> by Drawing near to his <HI>Angel</HI> (<HI>v.</HI> 16.) And though he say; <HI>My Cogitations Troubled me, and my</HI> C<HI>ounte∣nance changed in me.</HI> (<HI>v.</HI> 28:) yet he was not in haste to be Rid of it; <HI>But I kept the matter in my heart;</HI> namely, to be farther Meditated upon, and to wait the Issue:

And indeed in all Troublesome Cases, This is the Guise of a <HI>Gracious and</HI> S<HI>ancti∣fied</HI> S<HI>pirit.</HI></P>
<P>But of all other Instances, the Great Exemplar the <HI>Lord Jesus Christ</HI> is most to be Admired and Imitated in his <HI>Holy Mournful</HI> S<HI>pirit.</HI> His Sorrow in <HI>Gethse∣mane,</HI> when he approached near his Passi∣on, is thus set forth. <HI>He began to be sore Amazed, and to be very Heavy;</HI> and saith, <HI>My Soul is exceeding</HI> S<HI>orrowful unto Death.</HI> (<HI>Mat.</HI> 14. 33, 34.) And what does he, but pray? That this <HI>Bitter Cup</HI> (as <HI>Ma∣thew</HI>) or this <HI>Hour</HI> (of Temptation) as <HI>Mark</HI>) <HI>might pass from him; and being in an Agony he prayed more earnestly,</HI> (<HI>Luk.</HI> 22. 44.)

<P N="2">2. Is that <HI>Hotter Spirit Active and Vigo∣rous:</HI> This C<HI>older is dull and weak;</HI> a dull Spirit, or <HI>Spirit of Heaviness,</HI> as 'tis call'd (I<HI>sa.</HI> 61. 3.)

<P>And as to the <HI>Weakness</HI> of this <HI>Spirit,</HI> It Leads to Dependance on Gods All-Sufficiency; It is often an Effect of great Sorrow, <HI>By</HI> S<HI>orrow of heart the</HI> S<HI>pi∣rit is Broken.</HI> (<HI>Prov.</HI> 15. 13.)

A Professor of such a Spirit is but a <HI>Cold</HI> C<HI>hristian,</HI> and will have but a <HI>cold Entertainment</HI> when he comes to seek his Reward. A true Christian should be al∣ways <HI>furnished with a</HI> Spirit, though not always <HI>Use</HI> it: There is a time for necessa∣ry Anger. And we should <HI>Use</HI> our warmth of Spirit, or <HI>forbear</HI> it, as occasi∣on Requires. <HI>What will you? Shall</HI> I <HI>come unto you with a Rod; or in Love, and in the</HI> S<HI>pirit of Meekness?</HI> (1 Cor. 4. 21.)</P>
<P>This <HI>Unsanctified softness of</HI> S<HI>pirit,</HI> Tho' it be thus <HI>Useless</HI> and <HI>Blameable;</HI> yet this must be acknowledged of it: That of all the Worldly Spirits 'tis <HI>one of the best;</HI> and as it does <HI>no good,</HI> so it does <HI>Least Harm</HI> and <HI>Mischief.</HI> It may Render a man a quiet and untroublesome <HI>Neighbour,</HI> and tollerable Member, of the <HI>Common wealth;</HI> But still a sapless and fruitless Branch in the <HI>Church,;</HI> and is far short of true Chri∣stianity, whatever it professes.</P>
<P>But if the <HI>Meek</HI> Spirit be a <HI>Sanctified</HI> one; Oh! How Excellent, How Lovely and Desirable is it? How much does it conduce to <HI>Brethrens Living together in U∣nity?</HI> How many Brawls and Factions would it prevent?

<P>Again, this is a fit Spirit to Deal with Sinners. <HI>Restore such an one in the</HI> S<HI>pirit of Meekness.</HI> (Gal. 6. 1.)

<P>And thus much of the two <HI>Opposite</HI> Spirits, the <HI>Hot</HI> and the <HI>Cold.</HI> We come now to the <HI>Mean,</HI> between them both; which of all the <HI>Natural Spirits</HI> is the most <HI>Curious, Desireable,</HI> and <HI>best Manage∣able,</HI> to every good purpose. Therefore</P>

Evenly, Smoothly, and Firmly; The Vessel of due proportion, betwixt Hull, and Sayl, which usually well Arrives at its intended Port. 'Tis the <HI>foelix Tem∣peries</HI> of the Philosophers, that naturally <HI>Disposes to,</HI> and <HI>Adapts for, General</HI> Ver∣tue. 'Tis best enabled to Use its own Abilities; and manage its own powers, whether <HI>Intellectual</HI> or <HI>Volitive</HI> to the best Advantage.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Intellectual</HI> by a moderation, and order of Thoughts; of a sufficient <HI>Heat to Excite</HI> them, and yet of <HI>Coolness</HI> enough to <HI>Govern</HI> them, and their Effects, which otherwise might be Exorbitant. 'Tis not the <HI>Dull▪ Soul,</HI> that thinks not <HI>Intense∣ly of any</HI> thing; Nor the Phantastick Air, that Huddles, and is <HI>precipitant in all</HI> things. But it is such a well compo∣sed Spirit, as indeed <HI>Quickens</HI> a man to Act, and yet Renders him <HI>Sober,</HI> and <HI>Deliberate,</HI> in all his Actions. Hence a∣rises <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Prudence</HI> in Matters, and a <HI>firm Judgment,</HI> that will not suf∣fer it self to be Biassed or Disordered by any unruly <HI>Passions;</HI> But Governs them by Reason; and brings and keeps them in their due Subordaination.</P>
<P>Whence follows</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Volitive</HI> Powers are well used,
<PB N="75" REF="000661_0082_0FA9A0149544EE58"/>
and ordered by such a <HI>Moderate Spirit;</HI> The <HI>Will</HI> is Benign, and the <HI>Passions</HI> Re∣gular. The <HI>Will,</HI> and all the <HI>powers under</HI> its Commands are Disposed to Sub∣jection unto Right Reason. Hence <HI>This Spirit</HI> is apt to be well governed <HI>In the man,</HI> that has it; And thereby Renders him more fit to Govern amongst <HI>other men</HI> in the world; from both which it may be Denominated <HI>A Spirit of Govern∣ment.</HI> Of this brave Spirit was <HI>Titus Vespasian,</HI> who from thence was called (<HI>Humani Generis Delicioe</HI>) The Delights of Mankind. Faithfulness, Candour, Beneficence, and all other things that are Excellent (so far as <HI>Nature</HI> can go) have their Derivation from this Spirit; because it is not so liable to the Infirmity of Unruly Passions, which is the Natural Cause of all the contrary Vices.</P>
<P>Yet if this Rare and Excellent Spirit, which is so very good <HI>in it self</HI> be <HI>Un∣sanctify'd</HI> and Corrupt; 'Tis all as Bad, if not worse, then the Rest. Corruption of the best is worst. For</P>
<P N="1">1. Its <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Prudence,</HI> if <HI>Unsancti∣fyed,</HI> is (at best) but <HI>Worldly Wisdom,</HI> and Imployed wholly to serve Worldly Interests: But it seldome stops there; for it commonly proceeds in a way of
<PB N="76" REF="000661_0083_0FA9A014AFE50068"/>
<HI>Enmity</HI> against God and Goodness; And becomes too often a <HI>Devilish Policy.</HI> If the Enemies of the Church be men of <HI>this Spirit,</HI> they are most Dangerous: 'Tis the men of this Temper, that are the <HI>Achitophels</HI> for Mischievous Counsels.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hot</HI> S<HI>pirited Huffs,</HI> and <HI>Hectors,</HI> may have as great an Enmity, which they of∣ten shew in a <HI>storming rage;</HI> But their vehement Passions do oft-times Deprive them, of a discreet consideration, where∣by they overshoot themselves, and miss their Designs. The Smooth-bootes that look Demure, who can think and con∣trive, and are not in over-great Haste; The Wolves in Sheeps-cloathing; (in a word) The close and undiscerned Hypo∣crites (who by means of this <HI>Moderate</HI> S<HI>pirit,</HI> may more easily so be.) These are the Dangerous Enemies; These under their <HI>seeming Vertues,</HI> have advantage to act their <HI>secret Vices.

<P>As to the Spirit of <HI>Judgment,</HI> and <HI>Go∣vernment Unsanctified;</HI> 'tis that which maketh Nets and Snares, and perverteth Jugdment in the Gate. 'Tis not the Baw∣ling Sollicitor, so much as the subtile

'Tis they, that say, <HI>We have a</HI> L<HI>aw, and by our Law he ought to Die.</HI> (<HI>Joh.</HI> 19. 7.) Thus they Turn Judgment into Hem∣lock, and make the Ordinance of God Minister to their Lusts and Passions.</P>
<P N="2">2. Its calmness of <HI>Will,</HI> and moderati∣on of <HI>Affections,</HI> with those seeming Ver∣tues, that attend it, all are nothing so, as they do appear, but are <HI>Evil,</HI> and <HI>Sub∣servient</HI> thereunto. <HI>Evenness of Mind Un∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anctified </HI> Renders a man but a <HI>Gallio,</HI> ca∣ring for none of these things; Not con∣cerned about the <HI>Greatest</HI> Interests of their <HI>own,</HI> or <HI>others</HI> Souls: This is that Odious <HI>Lukewarmness</HI> which God will S<HI>pue out of his mouth.</HI> (<HI>Rev.</HI> 3. 16.)</P>
<P>Again, <HI>Benignity, Generosity,</HI> and <HI>Can∣dour</HI> of Spirit, if <HI>Unsanctified,</HI> is, (as Mr.<HI>Fuller</HI> calls it) The <HI>Bad-good-nature,</HI> which is commonly, and most Abused by Para∣sitical Hang-byes. Such men are Led by a <HI>Thred</HI> (not like <HI>Ariadne's</HI> Clew, <HI>out of,</HI> But) <HI>into</HI> continual Dangers. The Gallantly follow Trappanning, and De∣ceitful

Guides, to do Mischief; like the men, that followed <HI>Absalom in their simpli∣city, and they knew not any thing of his De∣signs.</HI> (2 S<HI>am.</HI> 15. 11.) These are oft Impos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d upon; and made Tools, and Im∣plements, in mischievous and ungodly projects, for want of Gracious Wisdom. On the same account of <HI>Bad-good-nature,</HI> they are apt to <HI>spare</HI> and <HI>favour,</HI> even <HI>Wickedness</HI> in men; and Indulge them in their corrupt ways. They are apt to be <HI>prodigally Bountiful,</HI> to such as they should rather frown away. (Prov. 29. 23.) <HI>The North-wind Driveth away Rain; and so doth an Angry Countenance a Backbiting Tongue.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, as to the <HI>Fidelity</HI> and <HI>Stedfastness</HI> of this Natural Spirit, if <HI>Unsanctifyed,</HI> it fits men to keep the Devils Counsel; <HI>He Heareth Cursing, and bewrayeth it not.</HI> (<HI>Pro.</HI> 29. 24.) A Thief may trust him with his Stollen Goods. Alas he is mislead by false names and notions of things, and the Clears Immoveably to them: As for Instance; An <HI>Oath,</HI> to which he will stick, tho' it be but a B<HI>ond of Iniquity,</HI> (contrary to the very nature of an Oath)</P>
<P><HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Trust</HI> he so looks upon, un∣der the Name of <HI>Moral Vertues,</HI> That he forgets the C<HI>hristian Duty</HI> of not being
<PB N="79" REF="000661_0086_0FA9A016EDD830D8"/>
<HI>Partaker in other mens Sins.</HI> So also, in <HI>Friendship,</HI> which (through his <HI>Candour</HI>) he often strikes with the Enemies of God; He then thinks himself obliged to be faithful in all things to these his friends; Tho indeed <HI>true Friendship</HI> is only in <HI>Ver∣tue;</HI> and other Friendship neither ought to be <HI>Begun,</HI> or C<HI>ontinued: Shouldst thou Help the Ungodly, and Love them, that Hate the Lord? Therefore is Wrath upon thee from the Lord.</HI> (2 Cor. 19. 2.)</P>
<P>These <HI>Firm</HI> S<HI>pirited,</HI> are the unhappy men, who being once <HI>Ill-engaged,</HI> are hard to be Reclaimed: They will persist, tho' against the very Edge, and prickles of Conscience, and Convictions: They scorn to forsake their C<HI>olours,</HI> tho' it be to come under C<HI>hrist's Banner: There is no hope</HI> to perswade; <HI>no; For I have Loved</HI> S<HI>tran∣gers,</HI> and (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e never be a base Changling or Turn-coat) <HI>After them will I go.</HI> (Jer. 2. 25.)</P>
<P>Thus this <HI>Noble</HI> S<HI>pirit</HI> is abused; Thus its <HI>Silver is become Dross;</HI> and those <HI>seem∣ing Vertues,</HI> which use to Glitter therein, are no more than (as <HI>Austin</HI> calls the Heathen Morals) S<HI>plendida peccata;</HI> meer Gloworms and Fire flies to the sight of a Moon-Ey'd World.</P>

But if S<HI>anctified,</HI> if Light and Heat be put into them by the <HI>Baptism of Fire,</HI> How do the Excellencies of this Spirit Excel themselves? This <HI>Governa∣ble</HI> Spirit is under a <HI>Twofold</HI> Govern∣ment; That of our <HI>own,</HI> and that of <HI>God</HI> too. This <HI>Fortified</HI> Spirit has a <HI>Double Guard;</HI> That of our <HI>Discretion,</HI> and that of Gods <HI>Grace.</HI> Let us take a view of this Spirit, as <HI>Regulated by,</HI> and S<HI>et forth in,</HI> the Scripture.</P>
<P N="1">1. 'Tis a <HI>Temperate</HI> Spirit; not <HI>Cold</HI> or <HI>Lukewarm,</HI> but <HI>Governably</HI> C<HI>ool.</HI> In (Prov. 17. 27.) we have (in this Re∣spect) its Character, and its Commen∣dation. <HI>He that hath Knowledge, spareth his words; and a man of Understanding is of an Excellent</HI> or (as in the Margin) a C<HI>ool Spirit.</HI> By K<HI>nowledge</HI> and <HI>Un∣derstanding</HI> in Scripture (and frequently in this particular Book) is meant <HI>Gra∣cious</HI> Wisdom, and S<HI>anctified</HI> Knowledge: 'Tis this that truly Tempers the Spirit to be excellently Cool; and enables it to Govern <HI>it self</HI> and its <HI>Astions;</HI> yea; and that Unruly Little Member, the <HI>Tongue,</HI> which in Hot, and <HI>Gun-powder</HI> S<HI>pirited</HI> men is oft-times <HI>Inflamed and Set on Fire of Hell.</HI> (James 3. 5, 6.) 'Tis a
<PB N="81" REF="000661_0088_0FA9A0186C236870"/>
S<HI>pirit of Government,</HI> both <HI>Passively</HI> and <HI>Actively.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Passively</HI> (or fit to be <HI>Governed</HI>) which gives Commendation to the man that has it, beyond the Triumphs of a Conqueror. <HI>He that Ruleth his Spirit is better, than he that Taketh a City.</HI> (Prov. 16. 32.)</P>
<L><HI>Fortior est, qui se; quam qui fortissima vincit.</HI></L>
<L><HI>That</HI>'s <HI>the</HI> brave man, <HI>that Rules his Spirit; he</HI></L>
<L><HI>Has the</HI> brave Spirit, <HI>where 'twill Ruled be.</HI></L>
<P>The <HI>Cold Spirit</HI> is too slow and heavy, to follow the Dictates of Regulated Rea∣son, unto any considerable Effect. The <HI>Hot Spirit</HI> over-runs it, and (of the Two) is the most Ungovernable. The <HI>Hasty</HI> and Disordered Spirit is chiefly Denomi∣nated <HI>Unruly,</HI> which often Exposes a man to <HI>Dangers,</HI> as an Unfortify'd City. (<HI>Prov.</HI> 25. 28.) <HI>He that hath no Rule over his</HI> (Royled and Ruffled) <HI>Spirit, is like a City, that is Broken down, and hath no Walls.</HI> The Moderate Spirit sets Discretion in the Government of his Affairs; But the <HI>Hasty Spirit</HI> (not taking time to consider, what is to be done upon the present E∣mergence) <HI>Exalteth Folly</HI> (Prov. 14. 20.)
<PB N="82" REF="000661_0089_0FA9A0192B69C8E8"/>
To the same Effect is that Comparison; <HI>The patient in Spirit is better, than the proud in Spirit</HI> (Eccl. 7. 8.) which is Explained and Applied, in that Caution. (<HI>v.</HI> 9.) <HI>Be not Hasty in the</HI> S<HI>pirit, to be Angry; for</HI> (proud) <HI>Anger Resteth in the Bosome of Fools.</HI></P>
<P>The Moderate Spirit is well compact, and firm, which keeps Folly from Break∣ing <HI>in,</HI> or <HI>out;</HI> But the Immoderate both <HI>Admits,</HI> and <HI>Discovers</HI> Folly, in all its Actions; And most easily and commonly in the <HI>Tongue. A perverse Tongue is</HI> (i. e.) Betokens and Declares) <HI>a Breach</HI> (or Disorder) <HI>in the Spirit.</HI> (<HI>Prov.</HI> 15. 4.)</P>
<P>This Cool and Temperate Spirit In∣clines to <HI>Wisdom,</HI> observed in <HI>Daniel,</HI> by the <HI>Babilonians,</HI> who <HI>Recommend</HI> him for it to <HI>Nebuchadnezzar,</HI> (Dan. 5. 12.) <HI>An <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cellent Spirit, and Knowledge and Under∣standing, was found in him—to Dissolve Doubts</HI> (or Untie Knots.) And for this he was <HI>Advanced; Because an Excellent</HI> S<HI>pirit was in him</HI> (ch. 6. 3.) Now here we must Remember, that in Scripture phrase, the <HI>Excellent Spirit,</HI> is in the Mar∣gin Read, <HI>the Cool</HI> S<HI>pirit,</HI> (as is before no∣ted.) It seems <HI>Daniel</HI> was a <HI>man of Tem∣per,</HI> even in <HI>their</HI> Observation, who could <HI>not</HI> D<HI>iscern</HI> his <HI>Grace;</HI> 'Twas his P<HI>rudence,</HI>
<PB N="83" REF="000661_0090_0FA9A019F08D88F0"/>
and not his <HI>Piety,</HI> that they took notice of; And tho' (<HI>ch.</HI> 4. 8, 9.) <HI>The</HI> S<HI>pirit of the Holy Gods</HI> was by those Heathens ac∣knowledged to be in him; yet, it was not his S<HI>anctification</HI> by the S<HI>pirit</HI> of the <HI>True God,</HI> which they meant; But (ac∣cording to their manner) whatever Tran∣scended the common course of men, they were wont to <HI>Diefy. Daniel</HI> had indeed <HI>Extraordinary</HI> Assistance from God for Re∣vealing <HI>Secrets;</HI> But this Help was above their Cognizance; they only observed <HI>such</HI> Excellency of his Spirit, as manifest∣ed it self in his <HI>Covers</HI> amongst them; for which also <HI>The King thought to set him over the whole Realm.</HI> (ch. 6. 3.)</P>
<P>That phrase in (<HI>Job</HI> 20. 3.) <HI>The</HI> S<HI>pirit of my Understanding causeth me to Answer.</HI> Signifies not (I think) his <HI>Understanding Faculty;</HI> but rather, That <HI>Moderation</HI> and Government, of <HI>his Spirit,</HI> whereby he was enabled (without Disturbance) to go on in Discourse of the Matters that were before them; as if Z<HI>ophar</HI> had said, <HI>I have heard the check of my Reproach;</HI> But it does not so Disturb the order of my Thoughts, that I cannot have my Wits about me; No, no, I know well enough, what to say; I have still an <HI>Understand∣ing;</HI> Because a <HI>Well-governed Spirit,</HI> that is

not Hurried by provocation; I can Rule my <HI>own Spirit,</HI> tho' not <HI>your Tongue;</HI> and therefore I can Answer what is meet: The <HI>Spirit,</HI> that accompanie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>another</HI> mans Understanding, might (perhaps) silence him from any prudent Reply, but the <HI>Spirit of my Understanding,</HI> (or, that Spirit which accompanies it) <HI>causeth me to An∣swer.</HI> And thus tis a <HI>passive Spirit of Go∣vernment,</HI> or, a Spirit <HI>to be</HI> Governed.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is also a <HI>Spirit of Government, Act∣ive;</HI> or it is most fit to Rule in the world.

<HI>Repairers of their Breaches, and Restorers of paths to dwell in;</HI> (ch. 58. 12.) from all which it appears, that this <HI>Moderate Spirit</HI> is not only apt to be <HI>Governed;</HI> but also it is fit to <HI>Rule and Govern</HI> in the World; because of the Wisdom and Discretion, that is used to accompany it; especially when it is Sanctified and Over-ruled by God.</P>
<P>As to that <HI>General Vertue,</HI> in respect to the <HI>Will,</HI> or Volitive Faculty, to which it is Adapted, as the Philosophers (<HI>foelix temperies</HI>) happy temperament; by S<HI>an∣ctification,</HI> these <HI>Moral Vertues</HI> become <HI>True Graces.</HI> In Heathens, where is no Sancti∣fication, yet, if God Excites their Spirits, they become eminently Serviceable. So <HI>Cyrus,</HI> who was of a Generous Noble Temper in himself; yet how much did he act above himself, when God stirred up his Spirit (2 Cor. 36. 22.) <HI>The Lord stirred up the Spirit of Cyrus King of</HI> P<HI>ersia;</HI> upon which he Issues forth a Noble Pro∣clamation. (<HI>v.</HI> 23.) It was <HI>Cyrus his Spirit,</HI> tho' <HI>stirred</HI> by God, and Inclined to this special Service.</P>
<P>But where Sanctification <HI>Renews the whole man;</HI> and gives <HI>New Principles</HI> and <HI>Ends</HI> in all their Actions; The whole Nature of their Laudible Atchievements

is also changed; so that, their <HI>Natural</HI> S<HI>pirit</HI> of <HI>Candour</HI> becomes the Character of a <HI>Blessed man, in whose</HI> S<HI>pirit there is no Guile.</HI> (Psal. 32. 2.)

(Prov. 11.13.) Their <HI>Moderation of Affections</HI> is also from a principle, that, not only <HI>Restrains</HI> (as Heathen Morals do) but <HI>Mortifyes the Affections and Lusts.</HI> (Gal. 5. 24. &amp; Col. 3. 5) Their <HI>Firmness</HI> is farther fortifyed by <HI>Might in the Inner-man;</HI> (Eph. 3. 16.) whereby they are <HI>stedfast, unmoveable, al∣ways abounding in the work of the Lord.</HI> (1 Cor. 15. 18.) for, if their well-con∣sidered <HI>Reasons</HI> do fix their purposes; Much more will their well-grounded <HI>Faith</HI> establish them.

<P>And by considering well the <HI>many</HI> S<HI>criptures,</HI> that have been alledged, we may fairly see, That 'tis <HI>no strained No∣tion,</HI> which is the Design of this present Treatise. It must indeed be acknowledg∣ed, that in <HI>many</HI> of those Scriptures, the word [<HI>Spirit</HI>] may be taken in some of the <HI>common</HI> S<HI>enses</HI> put upon it. As for In∣stance; it may be taken for the S<HI>oul</HI> in general; and in some, for the Inward Part, as an Expression of S<HI>incerity:</HI> But to take it for the <HI>Higher Faculties</HI> of <HI>In∣tellect and Will</HI> (as the <HI>Rational</HI> part, con∣tradistinct from the S<HI>oul,</HI> or from the <HI>Liver;</HI> This, tho' it be the most com∣mon and approved Interpretation of this Text; I must confess I do not see suf∣ficient Reason to allow it. I do not find (to my Understanding) the word so taken in any other Scripture: And therefore I take it to be, but a strained Sense, and thought of, only for this particular place, because of some Difficul∣ty, that appeared therein.</P>
<P>'Tis true indeed, there is one Scripture
<PB N="89" REF="000661_0096_0FA9A01F31370B78"/>
usually alledged (<HI>Heb.</HI> 4. 12.) wherein S<HI>oul</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> are Distinguished one from the other: of which place Dr. <HI>Smith</HI> in his P<HI>ortraiture of Old Age</HI> hath Discoursed, and Laboured to Evince, That S<HI>pirit,</HI> there signifies the S<HI>uperiour Faculties</HI> of man; And S<HI>oul,</HI> the <HI>Inferiour.</HI> This Discourse of the Doctor's was Considered in a former Draught on this Subject; which now, because that Ingenious Gen∣tleman is some Years since gone to his Rest, I think fit to omit, only he, that has Leisure may compare what is there said, with what we have said of the <HI>same Scripture</HI> in the beginning of this Discourse, and then judge as he sees meet. And as for the many other pla∣ces quoted, wherein <HI>Mans</HI> S<HI>pirit</HI> is men∣tioned. (on which I now Desire you to Reflect) I suppose you will judg with me: That they may (for the most part) be very genuinely understood in our sense; and that the Interpretation of those Scriptures will, according to our proposed sense, be very Currant.</P>

Spirits:</HI> To blame the Diversity of them, is to quarrel Gods Work of Creation, or Providence. <HI>Why hast thou made me</HI> (or him) <HI>thus</HI> (<HI>Rom.</HI> 9. 20.) for <HI>Natural Temper,</HI> and Modification of it, by <HI>Out∣ward Circumstances</HI> is more Dependent on <HI>his Will,</HI> then <HI>our Industry.</HI></P>
<P>We should rather observe how all this <HI>variety of Spirits</HI> may be made <HI>Eminently</HI> Serviceable; for that every Spirit has its particular Natural Excellency; Tho' all have not that, wherein thou (perhaps) mayst peculiarly Excel. One Servant of God is <HI>Chearful,</HI> and Sings at his work; Another goes <HI>sadly</HI> and carefully about it, for fear of miscarriage; yet both may be good, and Faithful Servants, and nei∣ther shall Lose his Reward, but Enter in∣to his Masters Joy. Surely the <HI>Manifold Wisdom of God</HI> would not be so well <HI>made known by the</HI> C<HI>hurch</HI> in many Respects; (as Eph. 3. 10.) Nor the <HI>Manifold Grace of God.</HI> (1 Pet. 4. 10.)

The following verses set forth the Church under the Parable of a Humane Body; wherein every Member has its peculiar Ability and Use; so as the Eye cannot say to the Hands, or the Head to the Feet, <HI>I have no need of you;</HI> (<HI>v.</HI> 21.) But all are Serviceable in their place and kind. This (he says) he wrote, that <HI>there should be no Schism; But the Mem∣bers should have the same care or regard, one for another.</HI> (<HI>v.</HI> 25.)

And that (in <HI>Isa.</HI> 57. 16.) <HI>The Spirit should fail before me, and the</HI> S<HI>ouls which I have made; Spirit</HI> and S<HI>ouls</HI> may be taken, as put <HI>Exegetically;</HI> yet, if you consider, what follows, (in that Z<HI>ach.</HI> 12. 2.) <HI>I will make Jerusalem a Cup of Trembling, to all the People round about, when they shall be in the Fire.</HI> (<HI>v.</HI> 3.) <HI>A Burthensome</HI> S<HI>tone to all the people, gathered together against it.</HI> And (<HI>v.</HI> 4.) <HI>Smite every Horse with Asto∣nishment, and his Rider with madness.</HI> This (I say) considered, seems more to favour our Sense.

Thus the <HI>High</HI> S<HI>pirits</HI> (who are like <HI>Hills</HI>) are pulled down.

<P>Hence also will naturally follow the <HI>Exhortation</HI> of the Apostle, (Eph. 4. 23.) <HI>Be ye Renewed in the</HI> S<HI>pirit of your minds.</HI> This means not, that you should have <HI>New Powers,</HI> or <HI>Faculties Natural</HI> (whe∣ther Superiour or Inferiour) But new <HI>Inclinations,</HI> new <HI>Dispositions;</HI> The S<HI>pirit of the mind,</HI> cannot be here new <HI>Intellects,</HI> or new <HI>Wills</HI> (which some would have to be the <HI>Spirit of Man</HI>) But new <HI>Light</HI> in the <HI>Understanding,</HI> new <HI>Bent</HI> in the <HI>Will;</HI> This is to have new S<HI>pirits of the mind,</HI> by Sanctification.</P>

or Means) to Reform our Spirits, where they are apt to be Exuberant; and bring our <HI>Reasons</HI> to Act, in S<HI>ubordaination</HI> to <HI>God</HI> in the Renovation of them.

<P>Of these <HI>Endeavours</HI> in Subordaination to Gods Working a <HI>Chief one is,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. To Discover and <HI>Know our own</HI> S<HI>pi∣rits</HI> (GNOTHI SEAUSON) <HI>Know thy</HI> S<HI>elf,</HI> was (I think, in <HI>This</HI> Respect) meant by the Ancient Morallist.

and <HI>Address to Duty,</HI> in which two, consists That <HI>Renovation of their▪ Spirits,</HI> to which they are Exhorted.</P>
<P N="1">1. To <HI>Resist</HI> S<HI>in;</HI> That you may keep your selves (like▪ <HI>David</HI>▪) from <HI>your Ini∣quity.</HI> (<HI>Psal.</HI> 18. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.)

<P N="2">2. <HI>To Address to Duty,</HI> That we may be more <HI>Eminently</HI> Serviceable to God and Men in our Generation.

<P>When <HI>Other men</HI> make a Choice for an

Affayr, if they act prudently, they view the S<HI>pirits</HI> of their Candidates. So the Apostle ordered the Primitive Christians to Do.

<P>Now as the <HI>Electors,</HI> do Regularly mind me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Spirits, so much more should the <HI>Elected,</HI> in their <HI>Acceptance</HI> of Employ∣ments, to which they are Chosen.

<P>Some are Imposed upon, by <HI>Others</HI> Hypocritical <HI>Flattery;</HI> And they again Impose upon <HI>themselves,</HI> by their careless

<P>This is not said, that men should only Contemplate their <HI>Own Infirmities;</HI> for then no <HI>Humble, Honest Man</HI> would ever be Employed; All such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would be ready to Answer with <HI>Moses</HI> upon a Great, and Illustrious Call; <HI>I am not Eloquent; I am slow of Speech;</HI> I <HI>pray thee send by the hand of him, whom thou wilt</HI> (or marg: <HI>shouldst</HI>) <HI>send.</HI> (<HI>Exod.</HI> 4. 10) Or with Holy, Humble <HI>Jeremi∣ah</HI> (ch. 1. 6.) <HI>Ah Lord—</HI>I <HI>cannot speak, for I am a Child.</HI></P>
<P>But the meaning is; every man (pru∣dently allowing graynes for Humane Infirmity) <HI>Does,</HI> or <HI>may</HI> (by the Study of his <HI>Own</HI> S<HI>pirit</HI>) know, what in some

<P>And thus much of <HI>Knowing our Spirits.</HI></P>

<P>I have done; and shall conclude this Discourse, with that frequent Benedicti∣on of the same Apostle: As to <HI>Timothy,</HI> (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>2 Epist. 4. 22.) <HI>The Lord Jesus Christ be with your Spirit.</HI> Which is the same in Sense with that to the <HI>Galatians,</HI> (ch. 6. 18.) and <HI>Philemon,</HI> (<HI>v.</HI> 25.) <HI>The Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your Spirit.</HI> Amen.</P>
