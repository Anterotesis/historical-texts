Enslave th' Amer'can wildernesses,</L>
<L>And tear the provinces in pieces</L>
<L>For these our 'Squire among the valiant'st,</L>
<L>Employ'd his time and tools and talents;</L>
<L>And in their cause with manly zeal</L>
<L>Used his first virtue, to rebel;</L>
<L>And found this new rebellion pleasing</L>
<L>As his old king-destroying treason.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor less avail'd his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sleight,</L>
<L>And Scottish gift of second-sight.</L>
<L>No antient sybil fam'd in rhyme</L>
<L>Saw deeper in the womb of time;</L>
<L>No block in old Dodona's grove,</L>
<L>Could ever more orac'lar prove.</L>
<L>Nor only saw he all that was,</L>
<L>But much that never came to pass;</L>
<L>Whereby all Prophets far out went he,</L>
<L>Tho' former days produc'd a plenty:</L>
<L>For any man with half an eye,</L>
<L>What stands before him may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></L>
<L>But optics sharp it needs I ween,</L>
<L>To see what is not to be seen.</L>
<L>As in the days of antient fame</L>
<L>Prophets and poets were the same,</L>
<L>And all the praise that poets gain</L>
<L>Is but for what th' invent and feign:</L>
<L>So gain'd our 'Squire his fame by seeing</L>
<L>Such things as never would have being.</L>
<L>Whence he for oracles was grown</L>

<L>Divided their estates and pelf,</L>
<L>And took a goodly share himself.</L>
<L>All this with spirit energetic,</L>
<L>He did by second-sight prophetic.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus stor'd with intellectual riches,</L>
<L>Skill'd was our 'Squire in making speeches,</L>
<L>Where strength of brains united centers</L>
<L>With strength of lungs surpassing Stentor's.</L>
<L>But as some musquets so contrive it,</L>
<L>As oft to miss the mark they drive at,</L>
<L>And tho' well aim'd at duck or plover,</L>
<L>Bear wide and kick their owners over:</L>
<L>So far'd our 'Squire, whose reas'ning toil</L>
<L>Would often on himself recoil,</L>
<L>And so much injur'd more his side</L>
<L>The stronger arg'ments he applied:</L>
<L>As old war-elephants dismay'd,</L>
<L>Trode down the troops they came to aid,</L>
<L>And hurt their own side more in battle</L>
<L>Than less and ordinary cattle.</L>
<L>Yet at town-meetings ev'ry chief</L>
<L>Pinn'd faith on great M'Fingal's sleeve,</L>
<L>And as he motion'd, all by rote</L>
<L>Rais'd sympathetic hands to vote.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The town, our Hero's scene of action,</L>
<L>Had long been torn by feuds of faction,</L>
<L>And as each party's strength prevails,</L>
<L>It turn'd up did'rent, heads or tails;</L>
<L>With constant rattl'ing in a trice</L>
<L>Show'd various sides as oft as dice:</L>
<L>As that sam'd weaver,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Homer's Odyssey.</NOTE> wise<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t' Ulysses,</L>
<L>By night each day's-work pick'd in pieces,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="017750_0006_0FA26804B020B978"/>
And tho' she stoutly did bestir her,</L>
<L>Its finishing was ne'er the nearer:</L>
<L>So did this town with stedfast zeal</L>
<L>Weave cob-webs for the public weal,</L>
<L>Which when compleated, or before,</L>
<L>A second vote in pieces tore.</L>
<L>They met, made speeches full long winded,</L>
<L>Resolv'd, protested, and rescinded;</L>
<L>Addresses sign'd, then chose Committees,</L>
<L>To stop all drinking of Bohea-teas;</L>
<L>With winds of doctrine veer'd about,</L>
<L>And turn'd all Whig-Committees out.</L>
<L>Meanwhile our Hero, as their head,</L>
<L>In pomp the tory faction led,</L>
<L>Still following, as the 'Squire should please,</L>
<L>Successive on, like files of geese.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now the town was summon'd greeting,</L>
<L>To grand parading of town-meeting;</L>
<L>A show, that strangers might appall,</L>
<L>As Rome's grave senate did the Gaul.</L>
<L>High o'er the rout, on pulpit-stairs,</L>
<L>Like den of thieves in house of pray'rs,</L>
<L>(That house, which loth a rule to break,</L>
<L>Serv'd heav'n but one day in the week,</L>
<L>Open the rest for all supplies</L>
<L>Of news and politics and lies)</L>
<L>Stood forth the constable, and bore</L>
<L>His staff, like Merc'ry's wand of yore,</L>
<L>Wav'd potent round, the peace to keep,</L>
<L>As that laid dead men's souls to sleep.</L>
<L>Above and near th' hermetic staff,</L>
<L>The moderator's upper half,</L>
<L>In grandeur o'er the cushion bow'd,</L>
<L>Like Sol half-seen behind a cloud.</L>
<L>Beneath stood voters of all colours,</L>
<L>Whigs, tories, orators and bawlers,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="017750_0007_0FA2680563045718"/>
With ev'ry tongue in either faction,</L>
<L>Prepared, like minute-men, for action;</L>
<L>Where truth and falshood, wrong and right,</L>
<L>Draw all their legions out to fight;</L>
<L>With equal uproar, scarcely rave</L>
<L>Opposing winds in AEolus' cave;</L>
<L>Such dialogues with earnest face,</L>
<L>Held never Balaam with his ass.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With daring zeal and courage blest</L>
<L>Honorius first the crowd address'd;</L>
<L>When now our 'Squire returning late,</L>
<L>Arrived to aid the grand debate,</L>
<L>With strange <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our faces sat him down,</L>
<L>While thus the orator went on.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"—For ages blest, thus Britain rose</L>
<L>The terror of encircling foes;</L>
<L>Her heroes rul'd the bloody plain;</L>
<L>Her conq'ring standard aw'd the main:</L>
<L>The diff'rent palms her triumphs grace,</L>
<L>Of arms in war, of arts in peace:</L>
<L>Unharrass'd by material care,</L>
<L>Each rising province flourish'd fair;</L>
<L>Whose various wealth with lib'ral hand,</L>
<L>By far o'er-paid the parent-land.</L>
<L>But tho' so bright her sun might shine,</L>
<L>'Twas quickly hasting to decline,</L>
<L>With feeble rays, too weak t' assuage,</L>
<L>The damps, that chill the eye of age.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, like men, are doom'd as well</L>
<L>Th' infirmities of age to feel;</L>
<L>And from their diff'rent forms of empire</L>
<L>Are seiz'd with ev'ry deep distemper.</L>
<L>Some states high fevers have made head in,</L>
<L>Which nought could cure but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> us bleeding;</L>
<L>While others have grown dull and dozy,</L>

<L>Each peaceful habitant and neighbour;</L>

<LG>
<L>Thus now while hoary years prevail,</L>
<L>Good Mother Britain seem'd to fail;</L>
<L>Her back bent, crippled with the weight</L>
<L>Of age and debts and cares of state:</L>
<L>For debts she ow'd, and those so large,</L>
<L>As twice her wealth could not discharge,</L>
<L>And now 'twas thought, so high they'd grown,</L>
<L>She'd break and come upon the town;</L>
<L>Her arms, of nations once the dread,</L>
<L>She scarce could lift above her head;</L>

<L>And now her pow'rs decaying fast,</L>

<L>Fell in the vapours much by spells.</L>
<L>Strange whimsies on her fancy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</L>
<L>And gave her brain a dismal shock;</L>
<L>Her mem'ry fails, her judgment ends;</L>
<L>She quite forgot her nearest friends.</L>

<L>She first, without pretence of reason,</L>
<L>Claim'd right whate'er we had to seize on;</L>
<L><PB N="11" REF="017750_0010_0FA2680970C61580"/>
And with determin'd resolution,</L>
<L>To put her claims in execution,</L>
<L>Sent sire and sword, and call'd it, Lenity,</L>
<L>Starv'd us, and christen'd it, Humanity.</L>
<L>For she, her case grown desperater,</L>

A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Heathen gods in antient days</L>

<L>Th' omnipotence of Parliament.</L>

<L>And for that purpose he projected</L>
<L>The only certain way t' effect it,</L>
<L>To take your powder, stores and arms,</L>
<L>And all your means of doing harms:</L>
<L>As prudent folks take knives away,</L>
<L>Lest children cut themselves at play.</L>
<L>And yet tho' this was all his scheme,</L>
<L>This war you still will charge on him;</L>
<L><PB N="36" REF="017750_0035_0FA268260CD93710"/>
And tho' he oft has swore and said it,</L>
<L>Stick close to facts and give no credit.</L>
<L>Think you, he wish'd you'd brave and beard him?</L>
<L>Why, 'twas the very thing that scar'd him.</L>
<L>He'd rather you should all have run,</L>
<L>Than stay'd to fire a single gun.</L>
<L>And for the civil war you lament,</L>
<L>Faith, you yourselves must take the blame in't;</L>
<L>For had you then, as he intended,</L>
<L>Giv'n up your arms, it must have ended.</L>
<L>Since that's no war, each mortal knows,</L>
<L>Where one side only gives the blows,</L>
<L>And th' other bears 'em; on reflection</L>
<L>The most you'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> call it is correction.</L>
<L>Nor could the contest have gone higher,</L>
<L>If you had ne'er return'd the fire;</L>
<L>But when you shot, and not before,</L>
<L>It then commenc'd a civil war.</L>
<L>Else Gage, to end this controversy,</L>
<L>Had but corrected you in mercy:</L>
<L>Whom mother Britain old and wise,</L>
<L>Sent o'er, the Col'nies to chastise;</L>
<L>Command obedience on their peril</L>
<L>Of ministerial whip and ferule;</L>
<L>And since they ne'er must come of age,</L>

<L>Still more, that this was all their errand,</L>
<L>The army's conduct makes apparent.</L>
<L>What tho' at Lexington you can say</L>
