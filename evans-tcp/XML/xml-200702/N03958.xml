<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HAT same Spirit of Pride and Malice, which the Pharisees manifested towards our blessed Lord himself, whilst ful∣filling his Ministry in the Flesh, pre∣vailed very much against his Church after his Death, and Ascension into Heaven; where∣fore the Church of Christ at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> was greatly oppressed, and many were afraid to unite themselves to it, for fear they should fall under the Displeasure of the Rulers; and especially were the Rich and Great unwilling to hazard their All for the Sake of Religion, so that the Number of Believers consisted chiefly of the poorer Sort, who were not well able to support the Gospel. St. <HI>Paul</HI> therefore the A∣postle
<PB N="2" REF="004883_0004_100E08AF8647BE08"/>
to the Gentiles, endeavours to stir up a Spirit of Charity amongst them; and tells them, <HI>they were Debtors to the Jews,</HI> and <HI>ought to give them of their carnal Things, since they had so largely received of their spiritual Things,</HI> ver. 27. (Such was the Temper, and such the primitive Spirit in the Days of the Apostles; and would to God there was more of it handed down to us in these remote Ages.) And when the Apostle had obtained a Collection among the Gentiles, and was going up to Jerusalem to de∣liver the same to the Saints, he writes this Epistle from <HI>Corinth</HI> to <HI>Rome</HI>; wherein he informs the Christians there, that when he should Journey into <HI>Spain,</HI> he purposed to come to them, and assures them he should come to them in the Fulness of the Blessings of the Gospel of Christ, <HI>ver.</HI> 29. And therefore he beseeches them to strive in Prayer for him to God. In the Words we may observe,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Duty recommended, and this is <HI>striving.</HI> And he lets them know he was engaged in it him∣self. <HI>Strive together with me.</HI> He does indeed tell us, 2 Tim. 2.24. <HI>That it is not lawful for a Ser∣vant of the Lord to strive.</HI> But there he uses a diffe∣rent Word <HI>(Machesthai)</HI> which signifies to contend in Anger and with Weapons: But the Word here rendred <HI>strive,</HI> is (<HI>Agonisasthai</HI>) to be in an Agony, or to agonize; and the same Word is used, <HI>Luk.</HI> 13.24.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Manner of striving; and that is, in <HI>Prayer</HI>: in which we are to be in an Agony. Thus <HI>Jacob</HI> wrestled in Prayer, <HI>Gen.</HI> 32.24. So Christ himself was in an Agony in Prayer, <HI>Luke</HI> 22.44. And <HI>Epaphras</HI> laboured fervently in Prayer, <HI>Col.</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="004883_0005_100E08B1B40C66E0"/>
4.12. Our Prayers should all be fervent and in∣wrought Prayers.</P>
<P N="3">3. What it is the Apostle urged them thus earnest∣ly to strive for in Prayer; and it was, that <HI>he might come unto them in the fulness of the Blessing of the Gospel of Christ</HI>; that <HI>he might come to them with Joy by the Will of God, and be refreshed with them,</HI> verses 29, &amp; 32.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Motives to this Duty of earnest Prayer for him. And they are the <HI>Lord Jesus Christ's sake,</HI> and <HI>the Love of the Spirit.</HI> As if the Apostle had said; be it so you have no Love for me, yet if you have any Desire to advance the Kingdom of your Lord; and have any Desire to feel the blessed In∣fluences of the Spirit upon your own Hearts, and see the Operations thereof upon others, then pray for me, that my Ministry may be prospered.</P>
<P>Hence the
<Q><HI>DOCT.</HI> That it greatly concerns both Ministers, and People, to unite their earnest Endeavours, and most fervent Prayers to God, that the great Ends and Purposes of the Ministry may be answered.</Q></P>
<P>When our Lord had purchased a Church here with his own Blood, and was about to ascend up on high; he did not leave it comfortless; but sent down his Holy Spirit, which wonderfully filled the Hearts of his People: nor did he leave his Church without Means and Helps for it's Growth and In∣crease; but gave Gifts to Men, <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.8. He was pleased to constitute an Order of Men to teach and
<PB N="4" REF="004883_0006_100E08B34EE0CAC8"/>
build Men up in the Faith, and graciously has pro∣mised them his Presence to the End of the World.</P>
<P>Now, do we consider what their Business is, who it is that sends them forth to it, and how they must e're it be long, render an Account to him: how does it concern them in an especial Manner to be fervent in Spirit serving the Lord? Mankind are ready to think the Work of the Ministry is an easy Employ∣ment, very much freed from all Difficulties; and many have envied them their Ease; yea it is to be feared some have left their secular Employments, and turned into the Ministry, that they might in∣dulge greater Sloth and Idleness: But such Men are grosly ignorant of the sharp Conflicts &amp; severe Agonies, which attend a faithful Discharge of the Ministry. Oftentimes Earth and Hell unite against them.</P>
<P>Wherefore a People are not to look upon them∣selves altogether unconcerned about the Ministry; whether it be succeeded or not; but must do all in their Power to promote the great Designs of it: they must do nothing to oppose, and hinder it themselves; and when they see it labouring under Difficulties, and Oppositions, they may not sit still, and leave Ministers to grapple with them; but must appear for their Help, and say to them as the Peo∣ple once did, to <HI>Ezra,</HI> Chap. 10.4. <HI>Arise, for this Matter belongeth unto thee; we also will be with thee, be of good Courage and do it.</HI> It is of great Concern, that a People as well as Ministers do what they can to forward the Ministry.</P>
<P>But in handling this Doctrine I propose,</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="004883_0007_100E08B62EE93B48"/>First, <HI>To show what it is that Ministers &amp; People are to endeavour after and pray earnestly for.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>Point out the Manner in which they are to seek the Advancement of the Ministry.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>Give some Reasons of the Doctrine.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, <HI>Apply the Truth to Ministers and People.</HI></P>
<P>First then, <HI>I am to show what it is Ministers and People are to endeavour after and pray earnestly for.</HI></P>
<P>And in general, it is the Glory of God by the Salvation of Men in the Way of the Gospel. The Glory of God is the great End of our Creation, and it is what we should always aim at in our Actions. As we are Men we should endeavour so to live that God may be honoured by us: and as we are Mini∣sters and Christians we are especially concerned to promote the Honour and Glory of God, by seeking our own, and the Salvation of others, in that Way revealed by Christ in the Gospel: And in order to this,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Ministers must strive and even be in an Agony, till Christ be formed in their own Souls, and the Souls of their Hearers.</HI></P>
<P>Men are not always converted when they enter into the Ministry: many Instances there have been of their Conversion by their own Ministry. But if this be the Case of any Ministers not to be convert∣ed, how should they cry to God Day and Night for pardoning and sanctifying Mercy? And give no Peace to themselves till they are born of the Spirit of God: <HI>lest whilst they preach the Gospel of Christ to others, they be a Castaway themselves,</HI> 1 Cor. 9.27. How should they wrestle in Prayer till they know the Work of God upon the Heart, and can feelingly
<PB N="6" REF="004883_0008_100E08B7B3A3ECC8"/>
pitty, and travail in Birth with others? And when this happy Change is effected in their own Souls; how should they strive and agonize in Prayer <HI>till Christ be formed in the Souls of their Hearers?</HI> Gal. 4.19.</P>
<P>And if Ministers have ever felt the Terrors of the Law, and experienced the Comforts of God's Spirit, they can't be easy till their People are bro't out of a State of Sin and Death into the Favour of God, they will not rest till they have rescued them from the Hands of the Devil, and introduced them into the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ. Mini∣sters must take much Pains for the Conversion of their Hearers; and especially if at any Time they perceive a good Work begun in their Souls: they should never give over till it end in a thoro' Con∣version to God.</P>
<P>And at the same Time that Ministers of the Gos∣pel are travailing in Birth for their own and the Souls of others, a People must join with them and pray earnestly for them. <HI>Have any of you an unconverted Minister, you may not reject him even for that; you have no such Warrant from the Word of God; to do this would be to impeach the Wisdom of our Lord Je∣sus Christ, who commanded the Hearers to observe and do all that the Scribes and Pharisees taught them.</HI> Mat. 23.2, 3. <HI>And it would be to make your selves wiser than the Wisdom of God, who chose one to the Apostleship whom he knew was in a State of Nature; and at that very Time foresaw he would lift up his Heel against him.</HI></P>
<P>Your Duty in such a Case is to pray earnestly to God for him; that he may be made of God a faith∣ful
<PB N="7" REF="004883_0009_100E08B9E7B2FAA8"/>
experimental Minister of Jesus Christ. And is your Minister labouring for the Conversion of you or yours, can you neglect striving with him, 'till such a blessed Work be effected in you?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Ministers and People are unitedly to endeavour to uphold and promote real Piety and Godliness among themselves.</HI></P>
<P>Ministers must strive to be exemplary themselves, to be Patterns of Patience, Holiness and heavenly Mindedness; they must resist all Temptations to Lewdness and Vanity. It is a great Reproach to Religion when Men, who bear the Character of Christ's Ambassadors, give themselves up to Sen∣suality, and have no Government over their Passions and Appetites. But this has been unhappily some∣times the Case to the great Dishonour of Christ. Would we be Ministers of our ascended Lord and glorified Redeemer, we must avoid every Thing, which tends to bring our selves and his Doctrines into Contempt.</P>
<P>And all such as profess themselves Christians must be very watchful over themselves, and <HI>walk circum∣spectly, not as Fools but as Wise, redeeming the Time,</HI> Eph. 5.15, 16. They must avoid all Appearances of Evil, and live up to the Character they sustain. Nor is it enough here, that Ministers and People are externally sober and religious; but they must keep up the <HI>Life and Power of Godliness, as well as the Form of it,</HI> 2 Tim. 3.5.</P>
<P>And do Ministers and People at any Time ob∣serve Religion dying, how should they strive toge∣ther, to revive it? Is any Sin prevailing and grow∣ing rampant; they must awake to put a Stop to it,
<PB N="8" REF="004883_0010_100E08BC05266F88"/>
and face it down: It is not enough that Ministers exert themselves; but a People must also join their strongest Endeavours and most servent Prayers: they must strengthen the Hands, and encourage the Hearts of Ministers; as they in <HI>Ezra</HI> 10.4. <HI>forecited.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Ministers and People are concerned to do all in them lies to preserve Peace and good Order amongst themselves.</HI> Christ's Blessing to his Church was <HI>Peace.</HI> Joh. 14.27. And the Gospel often enjoins Peace upon the Followers of Christ. Hence we are commanded <HI>to live peaceably as much as possible,</HI> Rom. 12.18. and to <HI>follow the Things which make for Peace,</HI> Rom. 14.19. And Peace amongst a Peo∣ple is very necessary in order to the flourishing of Reli∣gion: The Spirit of God will not dwell in the midst of War and Contention. How watchful therefore should Ministers and People be that they don't fall into Strifes and Animosities? Satan is always ready to cast in Bones of Contention: Ministers must strive so to live that they may give none Offence to any; and that Satan may have nothing to improve against them to destroy their Usefulness: And a People must avoid all Occasions of Contention, by living in Love, by bearing with, and forgiving one ano∣ther. And is any Feud springing up, how does it concern us all to quench the Coals?</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Ministers and People must unite their Endeavours and Prayers that the Doctrines of Christ may be pre∣served pure and unmixed with Errors.</HI> We are all bound <HI>earnestly to contend for the Faith,</HI> Jude 3. And especially should it be of a great Concern to such, as are appointed to teach the Truth to others, to be well grounded themselves in the Truth. Mini∣sters
<PB N="9" REF="004883_0011_100E08BF01A883C8"/>
may not indifferently embrace any Tenets; thinking it no Matter so their People are easy with them; but they must examine the Truth, and when they are well instructed in it, must teach it to others: and they are commanded <HI>to convince Gainsayers,</HI> Tit. 1.9. And is any Heresy springing up at any Time, they must make a vigorous Opposition; and a People must assist them herein, lest the Corruption become epidemical, and prove fatal to the Souls of many.</P>
<P><HI>So also it equally concerns Ministers &amp; People to pre∣serve the Worship of God unmixed with the Inventions and Superstitions of Men. Moses</HI> in building the Ta∣bernacle, was to follow exactly the Pattern shewn him in the Mount: So we in all our Worship should pattern after the Mind of God revealed in his Word. We must keep up a holy Jealousy for God's Worship, and be always ready to rescue it from the Impositions of Men, which however plea∣sing they may be to carnal Reason, yet are con∣demned by God, and unsafe for us.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Ministers and People must do all they can to sup∣port Christ's Authority in his Church, that his Laws and Government may take Place upon Transgressors.</HI> That Christ has left Authority in his Church is cer∣tain, <HI>Mat.</HI> 18. &amp; 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. In whose Hands it is reposited, I shall not now attempt to determine; nor is it necessary it should be decided, would Ministers and People assist and strengthen one another, and both do what in them lies to reclaim Sinners and bring them to Repentance; but so long as Ministers and People are jealous of one another, and all they aim at is to engross the Power into their own Hands; and
<PB N="10" REF="004883_0012_100E08C086DE6858"/>
refuse to strengthen one another, Things will grow worse and worse if possible. It is a Reproach to Christians, that there is scarce so much as a Shadow of Government in the Church; and it is so hard a Matter to bring Offenders to humble themselves: and obstinate Men cannot be brought to submit to Order. Happy would it be, would Ministers and People unite to recover the sinking Authority of Christ in particular Churches; <HI>since we can't have any Help from Councils of Churches:</HI> Authority is as necessary in a Church as in a Kingdom: and the more this sinks, the more will Religion die with it. Mi∣nisters therefore must bear a Testimony against Offenders; must boldly call them to an Account; and a People must strengthen a Minister's Hands and encourage his Heart herein; and may not justify the Wicked, as is too commonly the Case.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>It concerns Ministers and People to endeavour to support the Honour and Credit of the Ministry.</HI> How∣ever a corrupt and degenerate Age may despise Men of a sacred Character; yet certainly the Work of the Ministry is the most honourable Employment in the World: and Christ assures us, <HI>that such as des∣pise them despise him,</HI> Luk. 10.16. He will have them <HI>esteemed highly for their Works sake,</HI> 1 Thes. 5.13. and <HI>accounted worthy of double Honour,</HI> 1 Tim. 5.17. And when we consider how much the Suc∣cess of the Ministry depends upon the Esteem Men have of Ministers themselves, shall not both they and a People do all they can to advance their Credit and Reputation? They must themselves live so holy and exemplary, that none may have any Reason to Censure and Reproach them. They must ap∣prove
<PB N="11" REF="004883_0013_100E08C20D80A270"/>
themselves to the Consciences of Men. Their Lives and Conversations must be such as will com∣mand Reverence from Men: But then Ministers are <HI>Men of like Passions, and subject to like Temptati∣ons with other Men,</HI> Act. 14.15. And if they do any Thing inconsistent with their Character, and Calling; a People must bear with their Infirmities, overlook, and cover their Failings. God has guard∣ed their Reputation better than any Mens whatever, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.19. How afraid then should you be to speak Evil of them, as is the common Practice of Mankind? <HI>As tho' they hired them into the Ministry, to let loose reproachful Words of them?</HI> But not∣withstanding all the Care God has taken to preserve the Reputation of Ministers, how ready are Men to spread every Failing they are guilty of to the great∣est Distance? But when Ministers are thus wound∣ed in their Reputations, their Usefulness is greatly destroyed.</P>
<P>And in order to <HI>your upholding the Credit of the Ministry, you must support them honourably who labour for your Souls</HI>▪ God commanded that <HI>the Ox which treadeth out the Corn should not be muzzled,</HI> Deut. 25.4. Which the Apostle applies to the present Case, 1 Cor. 9.9, 10. And he lets us know there is the same Reason <HI>they who preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel; as they who attended upon the Altar should be Partakers of the Altar,</HI> Verses 13, 14. But it is certain, the Priests under the Law were allowed by God a vastly greater Maintenance than Men are willing to allow Ministers of the Gospel. It is a vain Imagination some Men have, that if Mi∣nisters are kept poor and dependant, they will be
<PB N="12" REF="004883_0014_100E08C44F61E590"/>
more faithful, that they may not be rejected by the People: This is the Way to make them Servants to Mens Humours, instead of Servants to their Sal∣vation; if they are kept mean and low, they will not have Courage to reprove Men boldly, and face down their darling Sins: <HI>their Strength is not the Strength of Stones, nor their Flesh Brass,</HI> Job 6.12. And if they are kept poor and dependant, when Troubles arise and Men evil intreat them, they are ready to sink, and know not how to persist in their Work. <HI>And it is to be feared this has overborn and wasted the Spirits of some of the faithful Servants of our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I am to show in what <HI>Way and Manner Ministers and People are to endeavour to promote the great Ends of the Ministry.</HI></P>
<P>And the particular Way the Apostle points out to us all is <HI>Prayer:</HI> Yet we are not to suppose this is the only Method Ministers and People are to use, for the Light of Nature, and the Word of God it self, will teach us to add to Prayer all reasonable Means and Endeavours; but as we are intirely de∣pendant upon God and Christ for our Salvation, and can do nothing of our selves; so nothing is more reasonable than this, that we should make known all our Wants to God, and commit all our Cares to him by Prayer; He alone can prosper our Endea∣vours, and grant us our Desires. And especially should Ministers of Christ be frequent in this Duty of Prayer; they are altogether of themselves in∣sufficient for this Work, and <HI>all their Sufficiency is of God,</HI> 2 Cor. 3.5. And how earnestly should they implore upon their Knees the compassionate Presence
<PB N="13" REF="004883_0015_100E08C682D2F620"/>
of their Lord, and the gracious Influences of his Spi∣rit, to conduct them into the Paths of Truth, and save them from the endless Labyrinths of Error? That he would Support and Comfort them under all the great Difficulties and Discouragements they meet with in their Work? How should they ago∣nize in Prayer, and plead for the Influence of the Spirit in all their more private or publick Services? That both in their Studies, and in the Congrega∣tion they may approve themselves to God, and be faithful Ministers of the New Testament? They must also be much in Prayer for their People; must carry all their Cases to God. <HI>They must confess and bewail their Sins before God, and intreat God to spare them,</HI> Joel 2.17. Yea they must do this, when God seems to be ready to destroy them: Ministers may not hide themselves in the Day of God's An∣ger. Ministers must plead with God for all the Mercies their People want; and especially for the Graces of his Holy Spirit upon them. <HI>Ministers must be well acquainted with the State of their Flocks,</HI> Prov. 27.23. That they may suit their Prayers to their various Circumstances.</P>
<P><HI>And at the same Time that Ministers are thus wrest∣ling in Prayer, a People must also lift up holy Hands to God, and labour earnestly in Prayer for their Mini∣sters and themselves.</HI> It is not enough that you put up some cold Petitions for your Ministers on Lord's Days; and yet perhaps this is more than many, who would be accounted Christians, do. You must wrestle in Prayer for them, that God would be with them; direct, assist, succeed and prosper them in their Work; and this should be Matter of your daily Prayer, both in the Closet and Family; so also how
<PB N="14" REF="004883_0016_100E08C8B1A9D248"/>
earnest must you be in Prayer for your selves, that God would keep you from Sin, and guide you in the Paths of Life and Peace.</P>
<P>But as Ministers and People stand in different Re∣lations to one another, it concerns them to strive in different Ways to forward and succeed the Ministry.</P>
<P N="1">1. Then, <HI>as to Ministers they must take much Pains to be furnished with Knowledge for their Work.</HI> They <HI>must give themselves to reading, and attend continually upon these Things,</HI> 1 Tim. 4.13, <HI>&amp;</HI> 15. That they may handle the Word of God skilfully, and be <HI>Workmen that need not to be ashamed,</HI> 2 Tim. 2.15. They <HI>must convince Gainsayers,</HI> Tit. 1.9. and give to every one his Portion in due Season; which they never can do unless they are Men of Knowledge and acquainted with Learning of diverse Sorts. It is in vain for Ministers to pretend they need not take Pains for their Discourses; and that the Spirit of God will suggest Truths while they are speaking. We are not so to expect the Assistance of the Spi∣rit at the present Day. We must <HI>search out accepta∣ble Words,</HI> Eccl. 12.10. <HI>However Men of such a Stamp who despise humane Learning and Study may be admired and followed when Men are over heated with Zeal; it is certain they cannot last long; and in a little Time their Folly will be known to all Men; and the World will as much despise them, as now they ad∣mire and caress them.</HI> A Minister may at some Times have a Call to enter into the Desk with but little previous Meditation &amp; Preparation; but always to do this, is Presumption, and inexcusable Arrogance.</P>
<P>And while we are composing our Sermons, we must endeavour to suit them to the Consciences of Men, and not to their itching Ears: We must strive
<PB N="15" REF="004883_0017_100E08CB1C304348"/>
for such Words as will awaken Mens Hopes and Fears, and make them engaged for the Salvation of their Souls; and not study for polished Words and strains of Rhetorick, which will soar above Mens Understandings, and make no lasting Impression upon their Souls.</P>
<P><HI>And not only must Ministers strive to compose their Sermons well▪ but must take Pains in the delivery of them.</HI> I shall not pretend to determine whether it ought to be with, or without reading their written Notes: I think there is much needless Dispute in this Matter: and after all there is Liberty of Consci∣ence. But let the Way and Manner be what it will, Ministers must speak in the Name of God, and with Authority. Their Words, their Gesture, and very Countenance must discover them in earnest for the Salvation of Souls. Ministers must not be cold and lifeless in the Desk; but should <HI>be Flames of Fire,</HI> Heb. 1.7. When they address themselves to Sinners, they must be Sons of Thunder, de∣nouncing the Terrors of the Law in such a Manner that Fear and Trembling may take hold on them. And when they speak to awakened and weary Sin∣ners, it must be with such Tenderness &amp; Compassion that they may be drawn to Christ for Life and Rest. If Ministers are cold and lifeless in their Delivery, they will make careless and dead Hearers.</P>
<P><HI>So also they must take much Pains in their publick Prayers</HI>; and manifest such earnestness, and so suit themselves to the State of their Flocks, that they may command the Attention of the People. And in all their Conversation they must endeavour so to behave themselves, so to teach, exhort, and reprove
<PB N="16" REF="004883_0018_100E08CCCEE1EBD8" MS="y"/>
Men privately, that all may profit by them, as well as in their publick Ministry.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>On the other Hand a People must (according to the Relation they stand in to Ministers) take much Pains that the Ministry may be succeeded.</HI> A People must then take due Care to attain to a suitable Pre∣paration of Heart to attend upon the preaching of the Word of God. <HI>You must break up the fallow Ground of your Hearts,</HI> Jer. 4.3. That the Seed to be sown may be received into good Ground. If you come to the publick Worship without any Preparation of Soul, you cannot expect to profit by what is delivered to you: It will be no more than a dead Letter. And is not this one great Reason why Multitudes have heard Thousands of Sermons, and never profited at all by them? If Hearers do not awake the Powers of their Souls with Meditation and Prayer to hear the Word preached, Ministers may ordinarily preach to dead Walls and lifeless Images, to as much Advantage.</P>
<P><HI>You must also embrace all Opportunities to hear the Word preached, and not neglect assembling your selves together,</HI> Heb. 10.25. What will all the Study and Pains of a Minister avail, if you will not attend upon their Ministry? You must willingly miss no Op∣portunity of hearing, lest you miss of some Truth that might awaken, convince, and comfort your Souls.</P>
<P><HI>And you must strive to hear aright what is preached to you,</HI> Mar. 4.24. You must take Pains to under∣stand it, and not allow your Tho'ts to wander to the Ends of the Earth; nor your selves drowned in Sleep, while Truths of the greatest Importance are delivered to you.</P>
<P><HI>And you must take much Pains to treasure up in
<PB N="17" REF="004883_0019_100E08CF05904160"/>
your Memories; that you may pray over what you hear.</HI> It is unhappily the Case of many Hearers, they never carry any Thing from the House of God▪ But would you profit by the Ministry, you must of∣ten think of what you hear, and pray over it, that God would bless it to your Salvation.</P>
<P><HI>And you must be careful to practice what you hear from Time to Time</HI>; otherwise it will be of no Advan∣tage to you, <HI>Mat.</HI> 7.24,—27. Many think if they hear good Discourses and commend them, they ans∣wer their Duty; and are easy if they never put them in Practice; but the End of Hearing is to Practice: and how careful should you be to Practice what you hear, lest the wicked One take it from you.</P>
<P><HI>And to sum up all here with respect to a People, would you strive together with Ministers to promote their Ministry; you must govern your own Families.</HI> And herein you will make their Work much easier, and more happy: Hereby you may do much towards the Peace of a Church, and flourishing of Religion; but if you are negligent in this Point, you will lay a Foundation for Rebellion &amp; Trouble in the Church. If Children are not bound to obey at Home, they will not submit either to Ministers or Magistrates. It is what God mentions of <HI>Abraham</HI> to his Honour, <HI>that he governed his Houshold,</HI> Gen▪ 18.19. And a Want of this has been the Cause of so much Trouble and Vexation to Ministers; and such a World of Disorder and Confusion in Church &amp; State. Would you then help and encourage Ministers of the Gospel, you must train up your Children in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord.</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>Proceed we now to give some Reasons of the Doctrine.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="18" REF="004883_0020_100E08D1338E3630"/>1. Then, <HI>when we consider how very great and noble the Ends and Designs of the Ministry are</HI>; it is enough to animate Ministers and People to do all they can to promote the same: Now <HI>these are no∣thing short of the Glory of God, and the eternal well-being of immortal Souls.</HI> What can we better em∣ploy our selves about, and spend our Strength for, than these? These are worthy our highest Ambition, and well deserve our warmest Endeavours. Can we do too much for God's Honour, or the Salvation of our own Souls? And these are what the Ministry is aiming at.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The greatness and weightiness of this Work of the Ministry calls for the mutual Endeavours of Mini∣sters and People.</HI> Have Ministers so much upon their Hands, and will they not be concerned to accomplish the same? Can they loiter, and indulge Sloth? And have a People any Pity for Ministers, and know how great a Burden they sustain, can they refuse to assist, encourage and strengthen them? God com∣manded his People <HI>to help even an Ass labouring un∣der a Burden,</HI> Exod. 23.5. And can you omit bearing with Ministers, and striving with them?</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Success of the Ministry depends very much upon the joint Endeavours of Ministers and People to promote it.</HI> What can either Ministers or People do alone? If Ministers are zealous &amp; laborious in their Work; yet if a People remain careless &amp; slothful, they will have Reason to complain they labour in vain: So, if a People are striving in Prayer, and Ministers are void of Life, there will be but little Fruit: But when they both unite their Endeavours <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Prayers, there is a Prospect of a glorious Harvest.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="19" REF="004883_0021_100E08D2B99418D8"/>4. <HI>The Consideration that Ministers are employed to advance the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, ought to invigorate Ministers and People to use their best Endeavours to promote the Ministry.</HI> If we have any Love to the Lord Jesus Christ, who has loved us to the Death, shall we not seek the Advancement of his Kingdom of Peace in the World? His Government is most happy &amp; reasonable: his Laws all just and good. And shall we not seek to promote such a Kingdom in the World? Which the more it pre∣vails, the more happy it will make Men; for <HI>his Yoke is easy, and his Burden light,</HI> Mat. 11.29, 30.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Have Ministers and People any Love to the Spi∣rit of God, they will thus strive together.</HI> If they have any Desire to feel the blessed Influences of the Spi∣rit of God upon their own Hearts; or do they long to see the blessed Fruits and Effects of it upon the Souls of others, they will strive together herefor: The more faithful and labourious Ministers are, and the more a People strive to profit, so much the more is the good Spirit of God cherished amongst a People: But if Ministers are unfaithful, and a Peo∣ple careless and slothful, they will quench the Spirit of God, and drive him from them.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>The present Circumstances of Religion in the Country require the most vigorous Endeavours of Mi∣nisters and People to support the same.</HI> God has been pleased remarkably to revive his Work in our Land: But by Reason of the Imprudence and over-heated Zeal of one Set of Men; and the Coldness and In∣difference of another towards Religion; it is dying in many Parts of the Land: and we are in the ut∣most Danger of falling into the wildest Confusion in our religious Affairs. Some are hastening on the
<PB N="20" REF="004883_0022_100DEF48C2B177E8"/>
greatest Extravagance in Religion, and others grow∣ing into a Coldness and Contempt of the Work of God. And is it not now high Time for Ministers and People to use their best Endeavours to guard Religion, and save themselves from these approach∣ing Calamities?</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Both Ministers and People are accountable to Christ their Judge for what they do. We must all stand before the Judgment Seat of Christ,</HI> Rom. 14.10. And <HI>must give an Account of our selves,</HI> Ver. 12. Ministers for what they have preached, and you for what you have heard, and how you have profited by it: And what Account can we give, if we have not done our Endeavours to advance the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ? If Ministers are not faith∣ful to discharge their Trust, and a People don't take Care to profit under their Ministry, how amazing will their Account be?</P>
<P>What remains is to apply what has been said to Ministers and People.</P>
<P>USE I. Of Information. <HI>And what you have heard shews you how falsly they judge of Things, who envy Ministers their Work because it is attended with greater Ease than other Employments.</HI> They know not what Trials and Sorrows they are exercised with, who attend upon the Ministry: While you eat and sleep sweetly, Ministers feed upon the Bread of Tears, and Sleep flies from them: They have Agonies and Struggles which the World know not of.</P>
<P><HI>So also what has been said shows us what Reason both Ministers and People have for Humiliation and Self-Abasement:</HI> We have all done too little for Christ: Have not strove together as we ought to
<PB N="21" REF="004883_0023_100E08D72C6BD380"/>
have done; the best and most faithful Ministers have Reason to be ashamed they have strove no more to advance the Kingdom of Christ, and the Sal∣vation of Souls, and may justly say, <HI>they have been unpro∣fitable Servants,</HI> Luk. 17.10. And that People who have strove most to advance the Kingdom of Christ, and the Salvation of their Souls, may justly say, <HI>in many Things we have offended all,</HI> Jam. 3.2.</P>
<P><HI>We may also, from what has been said, account for it that the Ministry is attended with no better Success.</HI> Ministers and People don't strive together, and are not suitably concerned to promote Religion; would they stir up themselves and put their Hands to the Work, would not a merciful God do for them what they can't do themselves?</P>
<P><HI>We also learn from what has been said it should be Matter of great rejoycing, when God pours out his Spirit, to both Ministers &amp; People, for now Ministers may expect much Success in their Work, and a People hope for the Salvation of Souls.</HI> So on the other Hand, how should they mourn when God takes away his Spirit from them; for then Ministers will labour very much in vain; and a People will grow cold, and draw back in Religion.</P>
<P>USE. II. Of Direction to Ministers and People. Would they mutually strive together:</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Let both Ministers and People endeavour to en∣tertain just Thoughts of one another.</HI> It has too often happened, because Ministers and a People have en∣tertained wrong Thoughts of each other, in a little Time they have fallen into a shameful coldness and indifferency towards each other: Thus a People sometimes when they call a Minister among them,
<PB N="22" REF="004883_0024_100E08DA0C648028" MS="y"/>
exalt him above Measure; and scarcely will allow humane Frailties in him: <HI>but this is only to prepare him for the greater Fall:</HI> Like a Pendulum, the far∣ther it is stretched on one side; will in its return swing as far on the opposite Side. And even such a People are commonly as ready to debase him as be∣fore to exalt him. Let a People therefore look up∣on their Minister as a Man of the same Passions and Infirmities with themselves; and expect he will fail in some Things as well as they.</P>
<P>So let a Minister look upon his People as Men who have many Remainders of Corruption, from whom he must expect to receive Injuries and Abuses. Mi∣nisters have sometimes been ready to look upon their People wholly free from these Things, and when they have evilly intreated them, have been ready to sink under it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Let Ministers and People take pains to grow and increase in their Love for one another; and then they will strive together; and will not oppose one another.</HI></P>
<P>Ministers must love their People, as their special Charge, whose Souls they are accountable for. And if they perish thro' their Neglect, they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> answer for them to God. And let a People look upon their Ministers as special Blessings bestowed by Christ the great Head of the Church, <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.11, 12, 13. and a People ought to love them in a high Degree as such.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Would Ministers and People strive together, let them learn to bear with and cover over one another's Failings.</HI> A Minister must be very sparing in spread∣ing abroad the Weakness or Sins of his People: and a People must always conceal as much as
<PB N="23" REF="004883_0025_100E08DB92B84068"/>
possible the Infirmities of their Ministers, Let not the Failings of Ministers be the Subject of your Con∣versation, and the News you carry abroad with you. A want of this mutual bearing between Ministers and People, has greatly hindred the Ministry and the Salvation of Souls.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Let Ministers and People make the Advancement of Religion their great Business.</HI> Both Ministers and People are too cold in the Service of Christ, by Rea∣son of their being too much engaged in worldly Affairs. A People think hard to support the Mini∣stry, and do much to promote it; because they are more concerned to promote something else. Now if the Advancement of Christ's Kingdom lies nearest the Hearts of Ministers and People, they will strive together.</P>
<P>USE. III. Of Motive to Ministers and People to strive together. And</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Let us all consider how much the Lord Jesus Christ has done for us.</HI> He freely undertook for our Redemption; left the Glories of Heaven, came down and dwelt in Flesh: <HI>He who was rich emptied himself and became poor, that we might be made rich,</HI> 2 Cor. 8.9. He obeyed the Law which we had broke; and has paid the Debt we owed to divine Justice. He suffered the shameful and cruel Death of the Cross; and is ascended into Heaven, there to make Intercession for Sinners: And now, can we be unwilling to do all we can for Christ, who has done so much for us?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Let Ministers and People consider how awful it will be to perish after they have lived under the Gospel, the one preaching and the other hearing the glad Tidings
<PB N="24" REF="004883_0026_100E08DDA2D38318"/>
of Salvation.</HI> Barely preaching the Word of God, or hearing the Gospel preached, will not intitle Men to Salvation; and many who now preach, and hear the Gospel preached, will another Day hear Christ say to them, <HI>I know you not,</HI> Mat. 7.22, 23. Luk. 13.25. But can Ministers or People bear the Tho'ts of being thus disowned by Christ?</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Often think what Joy and Satisfaction it will yield you in the great Day of Accounts to be found to∣gether at the right Hand of Christ.</HI> What Pleasure will it be to Ministers to see in that Day great Num∣bers of their People, whom they travailled in Birth for, standing with them at the right Hand of Christ cloathed in white Raiment. This will afford mutual and inexpressible Joy to Ministers and People.</P>
<P>To conclude, <HI>Let us all keep in View the Glories of the upper World, and that unspeakable Reward which will be given both to Ministers and People who are faithful and strive together to promote the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ. Eye has not seen, nor Ear heard, nor can it enter into our Hearts to conceive of the great Things God has prepared for such,</HI> 1 Cor. 2.9. And both Ministers and People who strive together to promote the Kingdom of Christ; and are made the happy Instruments of recovering Souls from Sin to God, will <HI>shine as the Brightness of the Firma∣ment, and as the Stars for ever and ever.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The CHARGE given the Rev. Mr. <HI>John Norton.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN our blessed Lord ascended up on high, he gave Gifts to Men; and this was one of the precious Gifts of our ascended Redeemer, even a settled Ministry, an Order of Men seperated and ordained to the Office and Work of the Gospel Ministry, to teach and instruct Men in the Way of Salvation: And God having in his wise Providence inclined the Hearts of this People, to call you to this great and good Work among them; and your's also to accept their Invitation: We the Elders and Messengers now present, being satisfied of your Gifts and Qualifications therefor, do now heartily join together to seperate and ordain you to the Gos∣pel Ministry, according to Christ's Appointment, and particularly a Pastor over this Church, whose Call you have now accepted: And we give thee Charge in the Sight of God, and before our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the Quick and the Dead, at his Appearing and Kingdom, to take the Oversight thereof, not for filthy Lucre sake; but of a ready Mind. And we trust the great Lord of the Harvest will be with you; who calls you to La∣bour in his Vineyard, and make you an able, faith∣ful, and successful Minister of the New Testament.</P>
<P>And we solemnly Charge you before God, to preach the Word; be instant in Season, and out of Season: Reprove, Rebuke, Exhort, with all Long-suffering and Doctrine.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="004883_0028_100E08E2159AE628"/>Take Care to shew thy self approved, a Work∣man that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly divid∣ing the Word of Truth; and give to every one his Portion in due Season.</P>
<P>Give Attendance to Reading, to Exhortation, to Doctrine; holding fast the faithful Word as thou hast been taught, according the Scriptures of Truth; that thou mayst be able both to exhort and convince Gainsayers.</P>
<P>Take care also to instruct the ignorant, convince the erroneous; contend earnestly for the Faith once delivered to the Saints: You must rebuke the ob∣stinate, and comfort the feeble minded.</P>
<P>Make full Proof of thy Ministry: Meditate upon these Things; give thy self wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all Men.</P>
<P>Take heed to thy Self, and thy Doctrine; that thou mayest both save thy self, and them that hear thee.</P>
<P>You must pray for this People both in publick and private; and be their daily Intercessor at the Throne of Grace.</P>
<P>Do thou also now receive Authority to administer the Sacraments, and Seals of the New Testament, to Persons suitably qualified: taking Care always to distinguish between the precious and the vile; re∣membring that Holiness becomes God's House for ever.</P>
<P>Unto thee are now committed the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, the Key of Doctrine, and the Key of Discipline; them that Sin rebuke before all.</P>
<P>And we now solemnly Charge thee before the great GOD, the LORD JESUS CHRIST, and the elect
<PB N="27" REF="004883_0029_100E08E449735790"/>
Angels, that thou observe these Things without preferring one before another; doing nothing by Partiality: keep thy self pure.</P>
<P>Let no Man despise thee; but be thou an Exam∣ple to the Believers, in Word, in Conversation, in Charity, in Spirit, in Faith, in Purity.</P>
<P>Consider also that a Bishop must be blameless, and the Servant of the Lord must not strive, but be gen∣tle towards all Men.</P>
<P>He must be patient, in Meekness instructing those that oppose themselves, if peradventure God may give them Repentance to the acknowledgement of the Truth.</P>
<P>Carefully thus feed the Flock of CHRIST now committed to your Charge; not as being a Lord over God's Heritage, but as being an Example to the Flock: And when our blessed LORD the great Shepherd shall appear, you shall receive a Crown of Glory that fadeth not away.</P>
