nor present malice in the case, but killed his neigh∣bour at unawares; and those cities were for the security of such, from the revenger of blood, as well as typical of CHRIST, the only refuge for souls; but for wilful murder there was no city of refuge provided, but the murderer must die.</P>
<P>The doctrine to be noted is this, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P>It is the statute of Heaven, it is the law of the great God, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a murderer shall be put to death.</P>
<P>I. My purpose is, to prove the doctrine.</P>
<P>II. Then consider, that GOD is the rightful Lord, Lawgiver, and supreme Governor of all worlds.</P>
<P>III. Then view the reasonableness and recti∣tude, holiness and goodness of GOD's laws, and moral government.</P>
<P>And then apply the whole, agreable to the day, and solemn occasion.</P>
<P>I. I am to prove, that it is the statute of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a∣ven, the law of GOD, that a murderer shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> put to death. Gen. ix. 6. <HI>Whoso sheddeth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> blood, by man shall his blood be shed; for in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of GOD made he man.</HI> This is a law which GO<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> made, and gave to Noah, the father of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> world, to be published and binding upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mankind. This doctrine is clearly manifested <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the law which was revived, and, with solem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pomp, published at Mount Sinai, when GO<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> spake all these words, saying, and this divine pre∣cept, Exod. xx. 13. is one of the ten command∣ments, which GOD spake, <HI>Thou shalt not kill.</HI> By this, all murder is absolutely forbidden. Af∣terwards, we find in a variety of places, GO<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="5" REF="011045_0003_0F8545C08BA2A728"/>
makes it a law unalterable, that murder shall be punished with death—tho' these laws were pen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and judicial, and made and given unto Israel, of GOD, as their king, and political head, yet they were founded upon this orig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>al statute, <HI>Thou shalt not kill:</HI> yea, and founded upon the law of nature, for antecedent to all human compact, and forming into society, every man has a natural right to his own life, and no one has any right to take it away; and therefore, whosoever doth take away the life of another, forfeits his own; there be many laws which declare that murder shall be punished with death, Exod. xxi. 12. <HI>He that smiteth a man so that he die, shall surely be put to death.</HI> So in our text and context, he that smiteth with an instrument of iron, by throwing a stone, or with a weapon of wood, or by smiting with his hand, any one, so that he die, such a man is a murderer; he shall surely be put to death, This divine command was maintained by the wise king Solomon, Prov. xxviii. 17. <HI>A man that doth violence to the blood of any person, shall flee to the pit, let no man stay him.</HI> Therefore by the divine law, a murderer must be put to death.</P>
<P>II. I am to consider, that GOD is the rightful Lord, Lawgiver, and supreme governor of all worlds. For where we find a law, and penalty annexed, it supposes authority, and right of go∣vernment. Now, we are to view GOD's absolute authority to enact laws, and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t supreme king for∣ever.</P>
<P N="1">1. JEHOVAH is by nature GOD, an absolutely perfect being, the creator and proprietor of the
<PB N="6" REF="011045_0004_0F8545C17A88F088"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>niverse, and is therefore the absolute Lord of all, and the government of all things devolves upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, for the kingdom is the Lord's, and he go∣verns among the nations; and it is his absolute right, as GOD, to take his seat at the head of the universe, and conduct all affairs in his own worlds; and the divine government doth extend universally; it reaches to the highest heavens; and divine controul to the lowest hell: thro' all the natural, and all the moral world; and it is a mat∣ter of joy, <HI>that</HI> the LORD GOD reigneth.</P>
<P N="2">2. Consider GOD is infinitely equal to the pro∣vince of universal government; the divine per∣fections are infinite, and GOD's character abso∣lutely perfect; the infinite knowledge and wis∣dom of GOD, can form the most perfect plan of government; and infinite holiness, justice, and goodness, holding the reins: every affair is con∣ducted in the best, wisest, and most perfect man∣ner: so there is an infinite propriety that GOD should reign, and be king for ever; from the con∣sideration of the divine qualifications, and that all worlds, and created beings, should be his abso∣lute property.</P>
<P N="3">3. Therefore GOD the rightful lawgiver, hath an infinite authority to enact laws, and govern in his moral kingdom; for if GOD most-high, has a right of government, then, he has an infi∣nite authority to enact laws; for to suppose a right of government, and not authority to make laws, nor demand obedience, nor annex a penalty, is to cut all the sinews of government; but as all moral created beings, are GOD's workmanship,</P>

<P>My discourse now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urns to the poor prisoner, under sentence of death.</P>
<P>JOHN JACOBS, It was your request, that this last advice, should by me be given to you, and therefore by help of divine grace, I shall speak to you, with great plainess, and O! that I may address you, with that warmth and faithfulness, which your present case calls for, this being the last sermon you will ever hear.</P>
<P>When I see you a poor criminal, under sentence of death, when I view your aggravated crimes, and you standing upon the edge of time, and just launching into an unalterable and eternal state; O! prisoner, what shall I say to you! O! my hear∣ers, what words shall your preacher choose!</P>
<P>Prisoner, attend! The great GOD hath made a law, <HI>that he that sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed</HI> And in our text, <HI>if</HI> one <HI>smite</HI> a∣nother <HI>with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he is a murderer, the murderer shall surely be put to death.</HI> GOD had an infinite authority to make this law, and annex this penalty; and, <HI>JOHN,</HI> this is your case; you smote one of your fellow creatures in malice and rage, <HI>with an instrument of iron, so that he died;</HI> therefore you are a murderer, and you stand chargeable with guilt of blood; 'tis just that you be put to death, for by the statute of heaven, by the law of GOD, you ought to die.</P>
<P>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>soner, attend! You deserve to suffer the eter∣nal
<PB N="12" REF="011045_0007_0F8545C550E58FC0"/>
pains of hell, it is just in God to send you to the hopeless regions of the damned; you was a sinner born, have been a prayerless, and malicious crea∣ture, therefore GOD, <HI>against whom you have sin∣ned, and whose laws you have violated,</HI> may justly damn you. As you have ferved Satan and your own lusts, you deserve to reap the wages of sin, and to be a sharer in torments with the devil, that old murderer, with whom you have symbolized. GOD is clear when he judgeth, <HI>and his throne guiltless, and his character glorious, tho' the smoke of your torment should ascend for ever and ever.</HI></P>
<P>Prisoner, attend! Your sins are greatly aggra∣vated, you have been bro't up in a christian land, capable of reading the word of GOD, and the greater advantages you have been under, your sins in their aggravation arise in proportion: you was able to read the statute of heaven against murder, you knew that it was contrary to the law of GOD, for you to kill your fellow creature, and in taking away his life, you assumed, daring∣ly assumed GOD's prerogative, who is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ole LORD, and disposer of life; therefore heaven daring, and GOD provoking is your crime, and calls aloud for divine vengeance to descend upon your guilty head: keen will be the torments, and dreadful indeed, will be the damnation of them which perish, who have been favoured with the glorious gospel!</P>
<P>And, poor criminal! if you are yet impenitent, and a graceless, and umbel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eving, Christ less sinner, you are under condemnation, and the wrath of GOD, abides on you, and you now hang over a

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>laming hell! and as with your natural life, no∣thing remains but execution, dying in such a state of impenitence and unbelief, you will de∣scend to woe and hopeless misery! look all around, how doth vengeance pursue, the wrath of GOD hang over your guilty head! the curses of the law pointing at you, and the sword of justice ready to be bathed in the blood of your soul.</P>
<P>But, poor prisoner! There is one door of hope, and only one, and that is Christ: <HI>for it is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Je<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s came into the world to save sinners, even the chief.</HI> 1. Tim. i. 15. <HI>The blood of Christ clean∣seth from all sin.</HI> 1 John, i. 7. Great sinners have found mercy, the crucifiers of Christ, (some of them at least) were washed in that blood which they shed, and the dying thief obtained mercy in some of his last, yea, in his dying moments: but those repented of their sins, and by faith re∣paired to Jesus, the only Saviour; <HI>for without re∣pentance, there is no remission of sin, and without faith in Christ, there is no justification, nor salvation.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore you must be sensible of your sin, feel your▪guilt, and see your ruined, perish∣ing and undone estate, and helpless condition; and as you by nature are totally corrupt and depraved, so you stand in absolute need of a new heart, and a foundation to be laid in you, by the operation of the holy spirit, for true views, and holy exer∣cises you must see, and have a sense of GOD, of the excellence of his law, and government, and of your vileness and odiousness, by reason of your sin, and see the justice of GOD, in casting you
<PB N="14" REF="011045_0008_0F8545C625F9F838"/>
off for ever, and feel yourself righteously con∣demned. You must feel your need of a saviour, and under a sense of the gloriousness, and all-suf∣ficiency of Christ, the compleatness of his atone∣ment, and with heart approbation of the glorious way of salvation, and under a deep sense of your unworthiness, guilt and vileness, with full con∣sent of heart, come into this way of salvation by Christ, receive him a Saviour to save from sin, and the punishment of sin, and trust all the affairs of thy soul in his all-saving hands, &amp; with a bleed∣ing heart for sin, and hatred of it, give up your∣self to GOD in Christ, unreservedly, and for ever. O! now repent, and believe on the LORD Jesus Christ! you stand in the greatest need of an inter∣est in Christ! for, Mark xvi. 16. <HI>He that believeth not shall be damned.</HI> And our LORD saith, John viii. 24. <HI>If ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.</HI></P>
<P>But the fountain of Christ's blood is open, your sin in it's nature is not unpardonable, unless you fix it by final unbelief; but you cannot be saved, unless you are truly penitent, and believe on the name of the LORD Jesus Christ. The matter is bro't to a point, you must accept of Christ, or go to hell. I therefore, in the name of the LORD, warn you to repent, and to go to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> threshold of mercy; own your guilt, and just condemnation, plead for the life of your precious soul, that GOD would glorify his grace, in your pardon and salvation, and that Jesus would save a poor perishing and hell-deserving sinner.</P>

<P>And all the children of GOD in this assembly, in the poor criminal's name, I ask yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, ardent prayers: you have an interest in the court of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣ven: plead GOD's free grace, for this poor dy∣ing man.</P>
<P>All in this assembly, which are graceless, and umbel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eving sinners, you no doubt feel your com∣passions move, when you behold this prisoner; but pray attend to your own case: <HI>He that believeth not is condemned already.</HI> You are under the con∣demning sentence of GOD's law: and thus living, and thus dying, you will be bro't forth to a more awful execution, and divine vengeance sink your guilty souls to the prison of hopeless misery.</P>
<P>Finally, this day and occasion, may naturally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead our views forward to the great day of judg∣ment; when, upon the sounding of the last trump <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here shall be an asse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bled world at GOD's bar: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ark to the solemn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound! <HI>arise ye dead, and come <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o judgment!</HI> gloriou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and joyful day to faints, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ehold the Judge upon his throne, but terrible to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nners! who will call upon the rocks and moun∣tains

to cover them: when final sentence will be passed upon impenitent sinners, and they be bro't out, the helpless prisoners of justice; and with more than dying groans, descend to an eternal hell, while the righteous shall shine as the sun in the kingdom of their father, and praises be sung in heavenly glory forever and ever,</P>
