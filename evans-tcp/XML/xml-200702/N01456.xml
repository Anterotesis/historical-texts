<BIBL>Micah VI. 9.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>The Lords voice cryeth unto the City, and the Man of Wisdom shall see thy Name; Hear ye the Rod, and who hath ap∣pointed it.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MAY the GOD of all Grace in our Lord Jesus Christ, by His holy Spi∣rit, so influence our Souls, that by Minding the dispensations of His holy <HI>Ordinances,</HI> we may come to under∣stand something of the meaning of the dis∣pensations of His awful <HI>Providences</HI> among us. Then will there be some room for us to hope, that God is making all things to
<PB N="2" REF="001729_0002_0FB77B4E1944CBB8"/>
work together for good unto us, among them that Love God.</P>
<P>It would be inexcusable inadvertency in us, and a dreadful token of lamentable Stupidity in our Souls, if we should take no Notice of the late Stupendous, Tre∣mendous dealings of the glorious Lord a∣mong us, while the very bars of the Infer∣nal Pit have seemed, as it were, to shiver and the dreadful Smoke of the bottomless Lake hath begun to break out and ascend before our Eyes: And the venemous Vi∣pers of Hell have had a Permission to raise up their heads and after a very uncommon manner, to spit about their Venom upon us, and to shew us a little of their cursed and cruel disposition, by the blood that hath been shed, and the fire that hath been kindled in our Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>What means the heat of this anger of the Lord our God! The <HI>Words</HI> of God must be attended that we may understand the <HI>Works</HI> of God. We must regard the Works of the Lord and consider the Ope∣rations of His hands, or we shall be de∣stroyed with yet more terrible destructions. But that we may know what God says by His <HI>Works,</HI> we must mind what He speaks by His <HI>Words:</HI> The holy Bible is written for the admonition and the information of
<PB N="3" REF="001729_0002_0FB77B4E1944CBB8"/>
us upon whom the ends of the World are come, and we shall do well to give heed unto that sure Word of Prophecy: The Oracles of God in His Book are to explain the operations of God in the World. And our considerations upon the Words that have now been read unto us may by the Divine Blessing, help us to know some∣thing of the intention of the Most High, in the Works that have been lately done among us.</P>
<P>In the beginning of this Sixty Chapter of <HI>Micah,</HI> the Lord by the Prophet mana∣geth a Controversy with His People. He enters an Action against them, and in His declaration charges them with unaccounta∣ble unreasonable ingratitude For, after the Lord had called for Attention, by say∣ing, <HI>Hear ye now what the Lord saith, Arise, contend thou before the Mountains, and let the Hills hear thy voice, Hear ye, O Mountains, the Lords controversy and ye strong foundations of the Earth: for the Lord hath a controversy with his People and he will plead with Israel.</HI> Then He goes on to plead with his Peo∣ple, by saying, <HI>Oh, my People. What have I done unto thee; wherein have I wearied thee? Testify against me. For I brought thee out of AEgypt and redeemed thee out of the house of Servants, and sent before thee Moses &amp; Aaron,

He enumerates divers Particularities of his care about them, for the aggravation of their Wicked∣ness in their unanswerable returns to him. And He appeals to their own Consciences and makes them Judges to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the case between Him and them. He knew that they could not but acknowledge his Righteousness, and must condemn them∣selves for their own Sinfulness Neverthe∣less after the declaration of the Lords con∣troversy with them, and the demonstration, by the clearest and fullest evidences of their ingratitude to him. The People be∣ing thorowly convinced in their own con∣sciences, that they were very faulty and that God had just reason to be very angry at them; They seem to demand what they should do to appease the anger of God, by saying, <HI>Where with shall I come before the

But he there upon tells them. <HI>The Lord hath shewed thee, O man, what is good </HI> [or who is the good One: may this intend the <HI>Messiah,</HI> who is the Good One: as if the Lord had said I have found a Ransom, I have provided a Re∣deemer, who will satisfy my Justice for all that will accept of him for their Saviour, and I have shewed him and offered him to you, that through him there may be a Pos∣sibility of Reconciliation Then he goes on, saying] <HI>and what doth the Lord require of thee</HI> [upon thy accepting the Redeemer, the good One] <HI>but to do justly, to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy God</HI> The terms of Reconciliation between God and Man are plain, easy, possible and highly

reasonable. There can be no good ob∣jection made against the proposals for ac∣commodation between their God and their Souls But the Sinful People standing out against the offer of Mercy, the Lord shews that he designs a Process of Judgment a∣gainst them in the Words of our Text.</P>
<P><HI>The Lords voice cryeth unto the City.</HI> The Word of God proclaimes Wrath, Anger, Indignation against all Impenitent Sinners. The Wrath of God is by the Word of God revealed from Heaven against all Un∣godliness and Unrighteousness of them that hold the Truth in Unrighteousness. If Sinners be convinced of their Duty, but will not do it; or convinced of their Sin, but will not forsake it; the word of God is against them. The Lords voice then cryes against them in his Word.</P>
<P><HI>The Man of Wisdom shall see thy Name.</HI> It will be Wisdom for every one then to Mind what the Lord sayes in his Word and to see his Name who cryes with his voice: to Mind who it is that speaks to them. And then there is that call. <HI>Hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.</HI> Some∣thing extraordinary is implyed, If the cry in the Word be not regarded, then comes the Rod. And there is a voice in the rod
<PB N="7" REF="001729_0004_0FB77B58A1718218"/>
that should be heard by all, and so heard as to excite all to consider who sends the rod, and upon what errand the rod is or∣dered to come.</P>
<P>To Doctrine then, to be now consi∣dered by us, must be this.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE. It would be the Prudence of all People, and will be the Practice of wise People to take such notice of the Extraordinary dispensations of GOD as to learn the design of GOD in managing of His Controversy with Sinners, by those Dispensations.</HEAD>
<P>We have several Propositions to be con∣sidered under this Doctrine.</P>
<P N="1">I. PROP. <HI>The GOD of Heaven does frequently manage a controversy with Sinners upon Earth for their Misdemeanours before Him.</HI> He shews that he is displeased at them. And he shews them that he hath just cause to be so displeased. Their wayes are not pleasing in his sight, and so he walks in wayes toward them, that are not pleasing nor easy to them. So in the Second Verse of this Chapter, it is said,
<PB N="8" REF="001729_0005_0FB77B59944623C8"/>
<HI>The Lord hath a Controversy with his People and he will plead with Israel.</HI> Then he tells them what he had done for them. And they had not done before him, as he might justly have expected, and therefore he was offended, and they should be made sensi∣ble of his displeasure. And so it was fore∣told unto the People of God, in Levit 26, 27 <HI>If you will walk contrary unto me, then I will walk contrary unto you.</HI> The Lord having told them that if they were willing to obey him, then they should enjoy the blessings of his Covenant. But if they would not hearken to his voice and obey his Commandments and walk in his Sta∣tutes, then he would be angry against them, and they might expect the tokens of his anger: Then he shews them that if they would not repent and be reformed by lesser Judgments, then he would bring up on them greater Judgments and punish them yet Seven times for their iniquities and yet Seven times more, and Seven times more, until their Uncircumcised hearts be humbled When he hath begun a contro∣versy with Sinners, he will go on with it until they be reformed or destroyed.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="9" REF="001729_0005_0FB77B59944623C8"/>
II. PROP. <HI>The Lord is often pleased to bring Judgments upon Sinners for their Sins, while He is managing his Controversy with then.</HI> He hath threatned them with Judg∣ments for their Sins, if they don't turn from their Sins He must bring the Judg∣ments threatned, that he may appear to be the God of Truth. And he hath done from time to time according to his threat∣nings, thus in the Thirteenth verse of this Chapter, He declares, <HI>I will make thee sick in smiling thee, in making thee desolate be∣cause of thy Sins.</HI> Thus also in Deut 28 58. Sayes the Lord, <HI>If thou wilt not observe to do all the Words of this Law, that thou mayest year the glorious and fearful Name,</HI> THE LORD THY GOD. <HI>The Lord shall make thy Plagues wonderful.</HI> He told them that if they would be obedient, they should en∣joy abundance of blessings, but if they would be rebellious, then there should be curses multiplyed upon them. According∣ly it came to pass. The Promises of bles∣sing having been fulfilled, <HI>Joshua</HI> and <HI>So∣lom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> could bring in their testimony for that, so far as to their dayes, [in Josh. 23. 14 1 King. 8 56] The threatnings of curses were also wonderfully accomplished, as both <HI>Jeremiah</HI> and <HI>Daniel</HI> observed,
<PB N="10" REF="001729_0006_0FB77B5B8597A400"/>
[in Lam. 2. 17. Dan. 9 11.] So the Lord often brings various Judgments upon Sin∣ners, while he manageth his controversy with them. They find it a perillous thing to continue in wayes of Sin against the Holy God. But,</P>
<P N="3">III. PROP. <HI>GOD in pleased graciously to Warn Sinners, before He brings Judgments upon them in His managing to His controversy with them.</HI> And these warnings of God are in various wayes delivered.</P>
<P>For sometimes the Lord warns by his Word. So <HI>the Lords voice Cryes unto the City.</HI> People that read the Word of God, may discern a cry in the Word which they read, like that in Isaiah 3. 10. <HI>We to the Wicked, it shall be ill with him.</HI> The Writ∣ten Word of God plainly cryes, <HI>Evil pur∣sueth Sinners,</HI> it cryes, <HI>The Soul, that Sinneth, shall dye,</HI> it cryes, <HI>The wages of Sin is Death,</HI> The cry of the Word is, <HI>God will render to every one according to their Works: To them that are contentious and will not obey the truth, he will render indignation and wrath, tribula∣tion and anguish, upon every Soul of them.</HI> The plain cry of the Word is, The Wicked shall be turned into Hell &amp; all the Nations that forget God. God will rain upon Im∣penitent Sinners, fire and brimstone, a
<PB N="11" REF="001729_0006_0FB77B5B8597A400"/>
burning Tempest must be the Portion of their cup. God will find a time to call to remembrance the Sins of Sinners, and will set their Sins in order before them for their Eternal confusion. The plain Cry of the word is that in the a Thes. 1. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>—<HI>The Lord Jesus will be revealed from Heaven, with his Mighty Angels in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ; They shall be punished with ever∣lasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the Glory of his Power.</HI> And be∣sides and before the terrible things, that will come at last upon all finally Impeni∣tent Sinners, there are awful cryes in the Word of God against them, denouncing terrible things in this Life and World. Would People Read the Word of God, as they should, they might find the Written Word crying against them for their multi∣plyed Impieties against and before God.</P>
<P>So People that hear the Word of God, may often perceive a cry, like that in Ezek. 18 30. <HI>Repent and turn from all your trans∣gressions, that iniquity may not be your ruine.</HI> A cry, like that in John 3 36. <HI>He that be∣lieveth not the Son of God, the wrath of God abideth on him.</HI> A cry, like that in Zeph: 2. 3. <HI>Seek ye the Lord, Seek Righteousness and Meekness, that ye may be hid in the day of the Lords anger.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="001729_0007_0FB77B5F835A0458"/>
The Ambassadours of the Lord Jesus Christ, who are to Preach the Word of God, are commanded, as in Isaiah 58 1. <HI>Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a Trumpet, shew People their transgressions.</HI> And as in Ezek 33 8. 9. <HI>Thou shalt hear the word at my Mouth and warn People from me, when I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely dye; and thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way the wicked shall dye in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thine hand. Nevertheless if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn him from it, if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity, but thou hast delivered thy Soul.</HI> Thus must the Mi∣nisters of God warn Sinners about their Sins, against their Sins, that they may turn from their Sins. They must cry with ear∣nestness, with vehemency, with solemnity against the Sins and Vices of the Times and Places, wherein they live.</P>
<P>Indeed Sinners don't love to have their Sins cryed against. And if the Ministers of God will venture to cry against the Sins of Sinners, then will Sinners be ready to cry against the Ministers of God. And if the Ministers will not let Sinners alone to Sin quietly and to live in quiet, while they live in Sin, they be sure Sinners will not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> let the Ministers of God alone, to
<PB N="13" REF="001729_0007_0FB77B5F835A0458"/>
have any quietness in their Lives o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any comfort in the World, if they can help it. Did not <HI>Elijah, Elisha, Isaiah, Jeremiah, John the Baptist,</HI> and the Apostles of our Lord find it so. But if Ministers do let Sinners alone to live in Sin, to Sin as they please, then God will not let Ministers no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sinners alone very long They shall nei∣ther of them enjoy any long time of quiet∣ness. For,</P>
<P>So lies the case. If Sinners will Sin a∣gainst God, and God send his Ministers among them, He will have them to cry against their Sins. But if the Ministers of God will not cry against the Sins of Sin∣ners, but will be silent, then will Sinners be in danger of perishing in their Sins: but negligent Ministers must answer for the Souls of the perishing Sinners. Their blood will be required at the hands of those that should have cryed and given them warning, that they might have turned from their Sins: Therefore the Ministers of God must not dare, for their Lives, to be Silent; They must cry against Sin, if they love their own Souls. They must be as Trumpets thorow which the Lords voice cryes unto Sinners. Thus there is the cry of the Word, by which the Lord is pleased to warn Sinners, that they may turn from
<PB N="14" REF="001729_0008_0FB77B67CEF55C68"/>
Sin, so as to prevent his Judgments from coming.</P>
<P>But sometimes notwithstanding all the cryes of the voice of the Lord by his Word, Sinners will go on still in their trespasses. But what comes then?</P>
<P>Then,</P>
<P>Sometimes the Lord warns by His Rod And therefore is it said, <HI>Hear ye the rod an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who hath appointed it.</HI> If Sinners will not hear the Word of God, then comes the Rod of God. If the cry of the Word be despised, then the smart of the rod must be endured. Lesser Judgments come to war<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sinners of greater Judgments coming i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they continue Impenitent, if they are no Reformed by lesser Judgments. The rod comes to tell that the Sword is coming, in Sinners will not be perswaded of the rod to forsake their Sins. For when God hath begun his controversy with Sinners, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may expect that he will go on, to finish in Righteousness, if they will not be Re∣formed they must be ruined. The Lord will overcome when He judgeth. Thus we find it with the People of God, of old, it the fore-mentioned 26th of <HI>Leviticus,</HI> and 28th of <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> and in divers other Places of Scripture we find that they were told that if they would not hear the Words
<PB N="15" REF="001729_0008_0FB77B67CEF55C68"/>
of God, they should feel the rod of God. There should come lesser Judgments, and if they did not reclaim them, then there should come greater Judgments. And if they would not be Reformed by the Lord, by these Judgments, then He would punish them yet Seven times more for their Sins. The Lord would break the Pride of their Power, and would send the Sword to a∣venge the quarrel of his Covenant. So af∣terwards we find, the Lord began with them as a Moth, by lesser Judgments consuming of them; and then went on as a Lyon, by greater Judgments, devouring of them. So the Lord is pleased to deal with Sinners. The Word cryes unto Sinners. <HI>You have Sinned against God, Oh! Turn from Sin, left God bring his rod.</HI> But if the Sinners do not turn from Sin, then they may justly look for the rod. And when the rod comes, then the rod cryes unto Sinners <HI>Oh! The Word of God has been despised therefore is the Rod come Take heed, lest you despise the rod: For if you don't hear the Rod, the Sword may come next</HI> The cry of a lesser Judg∣ment, is, Oh! Be Reformed by this lest a greater come. And if there be no Re∣formation, a greater does come, and if Sin∣ners continue still incorrigible, it may be still complained according to <HI>Isaiah</HI> 9 11.
<PB N="16" REF="001729_0009_0FB77B6952517018"/>
The Lord hath brought sad things upon his People, they are environed with Ene∣mies; they know not which way to turn, they are exceedingly distressed, yet, <HI>For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still: For the People turneth not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him that smiteth them, neither do they seek the Lord of Hosts.</HI> By these things we learn that God is pleased to give warning to Sin∣ners, before He brings Judgments upon them He warns by his Word, before he strikes with his Rod. And by lesser Judg∣ments coming, He warns that greater will come, unless there be amendment by lesser. So it is commonly with a People external∣ly in Covenant with God. He speaks by the Word for their Instruction, before he smites with the Rod for their Correction: or strikes with the Sword for their De∣struction. But if they will not be Refor∣med by the Word, nor Amended by the Rod, they may fear being ruined by the Sword.</P>
<P N="4">IV. PROP. <HI>It would be the Prudence of all People to take such Notice of the extra∣ordinary Dispensations of God, as to learn what is the design of God in his managing of his Con∣troversy with His People by those Dispensations.</HI> We are to remember that the God of Hea∣ven
<PB N="17" REF="001729_0009_0FB77B6952517018"/>
is pleased ordinarily to walk in a way of Mercy toward Sinners, while they live in this World. The Sinfullest People in this World enjoy more Mercies than they endure Sorrows while they live here upon the Earth. And when God begins to bring any Sorts of Judgments upon Sin∣ners: they are strange, uncouth, unusual, unexpected things; and so may be styled the extraordinary dispensations of God. He goes out of his common Road, when he steps into a way of Judgment with Sin∣ners. The judicial dispensations of God may be called <HI>His Strange Works,</HI> for at their first coming, they are frequently sur∣prizing and amazing unto Sinners. Tho' they have been told &amp; warn'd about them, yet when they come they seem to wonder at them, as new &amp; strange things. Indeed when judgments have continued some time &amp; are grown common, then People grow less and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess affected &amp; concerned with them. So when War, Famine or Pestilence are grown common Evils among a People, then Sin∣ners frequently grow hardened, unconcer∣ned, unaffected. They make light of the Evils. But then frequently the Lord is pleased to bring something that is uncom∣mon. There shall happen some extraordi∣nary things, that shall mightily astonish
<PB N="18" REF="001729_0010_0FB77B6ADE90C888"/>
People, and put them into great confusion at lest for a while.</P>
<P>And the All wise God hath evermor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> some holy design in His extraordinary dis∣pensations toward Sinners. For He is cause by Counsel, ever acting with Infi∣nite Wisdom. He does nothing in vain. He doth never amuse the World with any strange thing, without some wise aim. He hath some Glorious Intention in all his ex∣traordinary dispensations about his Crea∣tures. For we are sure from Eph 1. 11. <HI>He worketh all things after the Counsel of his own Will.</HI> And therefore with Infinite Wisdom, consummate Prudence, and ex∣quisite Contrivance. All his Actions a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> weighed, ordered and contrived with a view at something for the Advancement of His Own Glory.</P>
<P>And about all the Evils of Trouble that come upon Sinners, all sorts of Judgment whether they be ordinary or extraordinary Ones, it may be demanded, as in Amos 3. 6 <HI>Shall there be Evil in the City, and the Love hath not done it?</HI> [The Lord has a han<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in all the Judgments that come upon Sin∣ners] <HI>The Lord will do nothing, but he re∣vealeth his secrets to his Servants the Prophets.</HI> And else-where it is demanded, <HI>Who is b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that saith and it cometh to pass, when the Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="19" REF="001729_0010_0FB77B6ADE90C888"/>
commandeth it not? The Counsel of the Lord shall stand, the Thoughts of his Heart to all Genera∣tions.</HI> Every thing that cometh to pass in the World, is directed by the Infinite Wis∣dom of God. He knows and sees all, yea He foresees and orders all. Nothing can come to pass without His permitting Will.</P>
<P>Indeed He does not force the Wills of Sinners, nor compel them to Sin against himself in breaking of his Laws. There is no such decree or purpose of God as lays any necessity of compulsion upon the Wills of any of his Creatures, that may be improved as Instruments in the hand of God, in bring∣ing to pass those things that may be called the Judgments of God: For God may ap∣point what shall be, and may design to di∣rect his Instruments in their Actions, while they act most Willingly and most Wick∣edly, without his being the Author of their Sin. For we are sure that God 'fore knew, for He 'foretold unto <HI>Moses,</HI> that the heart of <HI>Pharaoh</HI> would be hardned so that He would not be willing to let the Children of Israel go out of his Land. Yet <HI>Pharaoh</HI> did voluntarily harden his heart.

(4) They will realize unto themselves that the extraordinary Dispensations of God, are set before them for their conside∣ration, that they may learn something from them, for His Glory &amp; their Own benefit. For the Children of Wisdom look upon the God of Heaven as their Father; and they cannot believe that their All-wise Fa∣ther would present things before the Eyes of his Children, without any design of Honour to his Name or advantage to their Souls. They don't imagine that he only designs to amaze them or amuse them with his dispensations. But they Believe that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he would have them to consider of them so as to glorify Him, and get good for themselves. They reckon themselves call'd upon as in Job 37. 14. <HI>Stand still and consider the wondrous works of God.</HI> They consider, Psal. 111. 2. <HI>The works of the Lord are great, sought out of those that have plea∣sure therein.</HI> So they think themselves under obligation to take notice of the works of God.

<P N="5">(5) They must not cease considering the extraordinary dispensations of God un∣til they have learned something of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> own duty, unto which they should be ex∣cited by those dispensations, that they ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> know how to behave themselves under All the awful dealings of God.

of Repentance, and of Righteousness, that may issue in everlasting Peace to their Souls. And therefore they must consider the works of God so that they may know what He would have them to do: It was a good resolution of a Religious Man, Psal. 85. 8. <HI>I'le hear what God the Lord will say, for he will speak peace unto his</HI> (holy) <HI>People, but let them not return again to folly,</HI> (or that they may not return again to folly.) This may imply that as we must mind What God sayes by his Words, that we may be reduced or preserved from Sin; so we should mind what God sayes by his Works that we may be reclaimed or diverted from Sin; Be sure we should mind what God the Lord sayes to us, both by his Words and by his Works, that we may more fully understand what our behaviour ought to be before the Lord. As the goodness of God should lead us to Repentance, that we may do better than we have done; so by the Chastizements of God we should be excited unto more Holiness. And be sure the more Awakening dispensations of the Most High are to be considered and improved for such Ends. While dreadful Judgments of God are in the Earth, the In∣habitants of the World should learn Righ∣teousness. Then would they see the Name

this good. If People think that they have Saving Grace in their Souls, but are no Thankful to God for being preserved from Sin; they have just reason to fear, that they have hitherto deceived their own Souls. If you are holy Persons, you will be Thankful to God, in Christ, for His Grace, and will own as in 1 Cor. 15. 10 <HI>By the Grace of God, I am what I am. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> in Gal. 2. 20. <HI>I live, yet not I, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> liveth in me, and the life that I live in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Flesh, I live by the Faith of the Son of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who hath loved me, and given Himself for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> This will be the disposition of truly Gra∣cious Persons. But if People have been Restrained from Sin, chiefly, by the Con∣victions of their Consciences, Oh! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them be Thankful to God for those Con∣victions. Bless the Lord for enkindling those Convictions in your Souls, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> keeping them alive. And while you have been preserved from great Wickedness Remember, God may say unto you, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him in Gen. 20 6. <HI>I withhold thee from Sinning against me.</HI> Oh! What Sins an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Woes would Unconverted Sinners quick∣ly rush into, if they were not withheld <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Glorious God.

as the Wickedest of Sinners, if God should leave me to my self.</HI> And if the Father (<HI>Bernard</HI>) might say to any, that told him of any fault of another, <HI>Ay, he is fall'n, I shall fall next, and then you may fall; if the Lord do not uphold us.</HI> And if the Man after Gods own Heart saw cause to Pray, as in Psal. 19 13. <HI>Keep back thy Servant,</HI> O Lord, <HI>from Presumptuous Sins.</HI> Then what Sins would Ungodly People fall in∣to, if left unto themselves? And then what reason have all to be Thankful for the Restraints of common Grace afforded unto Sinners.</P>
<P>And if you have been Restrained from Sin, by any sort of Afflictions, Oh! then acknowledge, It is good to have been Afflicted, that I might be preserved from Sinning against God. Hath God so hedged up your way with Thorns, that you could not break into the Paths of Un∣godliness, without exposing your self to many, certain, ruining inconveniencies?

any Afflictions: yet are under some set of the Wrath of the Civil Magistrate, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is not to bear the Sword in vain; but should be a Terror to those Evil Doers, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not be terrifyed from their Villanies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any other means.

For we see, we know that some Sinners may arrive to such degrees of Wicked Madness, that they fear neither God nor Man; They care not what becomes of themselves, their Souls or Bodies, for Time or for Eter∣nity.

<P>But we have not well done with the Article of Thankfulness, until we have Thankfully considered, unto whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are obliged for the purchasing of all the Preservations.

IX. Does not the Lords Voice Cry this unto us: Oh! Let all Persons be alwayes ready for Death, for Judgment and for Eternity! And let them all make haste and make sure about their Preparation for those things; because they know not how surprizingly the Lord may call them away by Death, to appear before His Tribunal, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> receive their Eternally Unchangeable Doom. It was of Old, advised, Mat. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4. 44. <HI>Be ye ready, for in such an hour, is you think not, the Son of Man cometh.</HI> So <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is very often, The Lord comes and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alls by Death, when Persons, least of all think of any such thing. Little or no∣thing did those Poor Women, Murdered within these Six Days, think of their own Death being so near, but a few Minutes before the Mortal strokes were given. So little or nothing do any of us think about things that may suddenly come up∣on some or other of us. There may come sudden, awful things, that are now alto∣gether unexpected by any of us. Who, among us all, expected this day Se'n night, what hath happened within this Week? Tho' we had not been without warning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> look and fit for awful things. And is there not reason still to fear more awful things to come, unless means be attended
<PB N="62" REF="001729_0032_0FB77BC4987AA9A0"/>
for the preventing of them? Oh! th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they might be prevented! Oh! that tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> things might be done, that must be do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> if they are prevented! But what are the things that must be done, that bad thing may be prevented. Briefly, Three thing must be done, that bad things may be pre∣vented. If any one of these three thing be neglected, generally, among us, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> may justly fear that sadder things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> come than all those that have come. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> what are those three things, to be attend∣ed? One thing is this; Let <HI>Prayer</HI> God be more constantly attended by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> People, than it has, generally, been attend∣ed. Oh! That all Persons would Pray ways, [in all <HI>Times</HI> for Prayer,] with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Prayer [all <HI>Sorts </HI> of Prayer, Publick, Pri∣vate, Secret, both Ejaculatory and conti∣nued on ordinary and extraordinary Occa∣sions] with Supplications in the Spi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> watching there-unto with perseverance requesting the blessings of Heaven <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> themselves and all their Neighbours, as especially the Saints of God; this wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> be a means to preserve the Presence God with us, and then God would pre∣serve us from evil. Another thing is this Let care of <HI>Truth</HI> be, more commonly regarded by all People than it has, gene∣rally,
<PB N="63" REF="001729_0032_0FB77BC4987AA9A0"/>
been regarded. Oh! that all Per∣sons would get Truth of Grace in their Hearts, keep Truth of Speech in their Lips, and mind the Truth of God's Word for the ordering of their Lives: Then might we hope that the God of Truth would be graciously present with us, and then what evil could befall us? But there is another thing that must not be forgotten. That other thing is this; Let <HI>Love to Christ</HI> be, universally, entertained in our Souls and evidenced by our Lives. This would be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Token for good unto us. If all Persons among us, would maintain a due Esteem <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or Christ, in their affections, and express <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> high value for Christ by their Conver∣sations and would be continually and soli∣citously exercised, upon all suitable Occa∣sions, with serious endeavours to secure their interest in the glorious Redeemer of Souls, and to be promoting the Glory of the Son of God; then we should have God with us, and he would effectually drive the Devils, and all Evils away from us. He would soon chain up those Tygers of Hell, so that they should, no longer, annoy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, nor do us any real harm. Oh! that these counsels might be followed! But if Sinners will still generally, continue as they have been, Prayerless, Deceitful, Underva∣luing
<PB N="64" REF="001729_0033_0FB77BCB9A27ADC0"/>
the Lord Jesus Christ, neglecting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> great Salvation, freely offered in his Gos∣pel; then there will sad things come, sadde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> than all that have come. God knows wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> they will be. However it is good for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to make sure about our own Preparation for Death, for Judgment, for Eternity, see∣ing the Lords Voice cryes unto us, You know no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> how suddenly your Lives <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> end.</P>
<P N="10">X. Certainly, the Lords Voice cry this, very plainly, very loudly unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Let unfeigned Repentance, and evidence Repentance be practised by all People, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so their terrible, eternal perdition may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> prevented. Oh! let us all show our selves to be the Children of Wisdom, in hear∣kening to this cry of the Voice of the Lord our God, in what he has been lately <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> among us; let all Repent, that so no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may perish.

<P>After the Lord had told his People <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old, about several dreadful Judgment brought upon them, and yet they remain impenitent, He tells them thus; <HI>I on threw some of you, as I over-threw Sodom a G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrha,</HI> [burning, fiery Judgments <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="65" REF="001729_0033_0FB77BCB9A27ADC0"/>
been brought upon them; for he sayes] <HI>and ye were as a Fire-brand pluck'd out of the burning; yet you have not returned unto me, saith the Lord:</HI> They were still incorrigi∣ble after all; then he tells them, as in A∣mos 4 12 <HI>Therefore thus will I do unto thee O Israel!</HI> [How is that? As he had threat∣ned with an Oath, in the second verse. <HI>The Lord God hath Sworn by his holiness, that lo, the dayes shall come upon you, that I will take you away with books, and your Posterity with fish-books.</HI> Both Parents and Children should suffer grievous Miseries, and be, generally, miserably destroyed. But yet sayes the Merciful God] <HI>And because I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel,</HI> How better then with deep Humi∣liation, sincere and fervent Supplication, with penitential Confession of their Sins, with bitterness of Soul, with brokenness of Heart; with Hearts broken for and from sin, so as to be ready and willing to for∣sake Sin, putting away all their iniquities, far from them, relying on the Great Sacri∣fice for obtaining Pardon of Sin and Re∣conciliation with God. Such Preparation to meet the Lord, would well become us, at this day. There should be Repentance for Sin; this hath two things implyed in it, as in <HI>Prov.</HI> 28. 13. Confessing of Sin with
<PB N="66" REF="001729_0034_0FB77BCD12860508"/>
forsaking of Sin. It is not enough to Con∣fess our Sins, if we are not inclined to for∣sake them: nor is it enough to forsake <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sins, if we are not disposed to Confe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> them. Confessing and Forsaking of si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> must go together; if Repentance be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> feigned, if it be, as it ought to be, from thy Heart. But if it be from the Heart, it will be in the Life: Unfeigned Repentance will be evident Repentance. If Repen∣tance be real in the Heart, it will appear in the Life, and it will continue as long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Life continues.</P>
<P>Now such Repentance does the Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> call for from us, with a loud Voice: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> loud Voice of the Lord cryes to us, Oh Repent of all your Sins, with all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Hearts, that you may be Saved; And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> unto the Exalted Saviour to give such Re∣pentance &amp; Remission of Sin.

<P>This Poor Man had, in his Younger <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ime, Enjoyed such a Religious Educa∣tion, that his Conversation was, for a while, accounted by some, that knew him remarkably Religious; before he began <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> leave Religiously inclined Company.</P>
<P>But according to his own Acknowledg∣ments, in the Time, when he seemed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve the clearest Apprehensions about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ings of that Nature, He had grievously <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>un'd against the Light of his own Con∣science, in Apostatizing from Godliness: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or he own'd that he had Forsaken the

<P>He said, He would give Thousands of Worlds, if he had them, that what was done might be Undone, that he might Live to improve the Helps for Good that he had Sinfully Despised; But he profes∣sed, that he Entirely Relyed on the Free Grace of God in the Lord Jesus Christ for all Salvation.</P>
<P>But now he is gone beyond the Reach of all his Neighbours, to make any Positive-Determination, what Benefit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> might obtain by the Means of Grace that he Enjoyed at any Time while he was among the Living: It is the During of all that are yet among the Living <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Try to Benefit their own Souls, by wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> they are Acquainted with, concerning Him.</P>

<P>While the Minds of People were under this Dreadful Consternation, the Sermon Published here-with, was Preached in a Congregation, where Divers then seemed mightily Affected, as if Desirous to Know the meaning of the Voice of God in His Providence: and to Comply with His Will.</P>
<P>When I understood that many of the Hearers desired the Publication of the Ser∣mon, as a more Durable Remembrancer of the impressions then made upon their Souls, than their own Treacherous Memo∣ries were like to be; I was not utterly, Unwilling to Gratify the Desires of them, who Designed not only their own Benefit, but also the Benefit of Other.

<P>If the Blessing of Heaven may so Ac∣company the Sermon, as to make it, by the Grace of Christ, Beneficall to the Souls of them that have Desired the Publication, or any Others of Gods Elect; and if Peo∣ple

<P>THE design of my Sermon is, to excite <HI>Repentance towards God</HI> and <HI>Faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>Repentance unto Life, and Believing unto the Saving of the Soul,
<PB N="76" REF="001729_0039_0FB77BDE51F0E928"/>
should be alwayes designed by all that Preach, and by all that hear the Gospel.</P>
<P>In the prosecution of this design, some of the last words of several Dying Persons are now to be considered.</P>
<P>The last words of Dying Persons have been frequently esteemed considerable.</P>
<P>Of the Persons, that we are now to con∣sider some of the last words; One was a very bad man, he had lived wickedly and then he dyed wofully; he continued wick∣ed unto the end of his Life, and was very miserable in his Death, at his last. Ano∣ther had been a very bad man too long, but before his Death, he became a very good Man, he shewed and proved, beyond all contradiction, before he dyed, that he was a very good Man; he had the Appro∣bation, the Attestation of Truth it self, that he was become really good. So that tho' some of the circumstances of his death were very doleful, yet he dyed happily he was unspeakably happy in his Death at his End. The Other was the very bell Man that ever lived, that ever dyed; H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was more than a meer Man, He was God as well as Man, the Almighty Saviour of Men. Therefore his words, be sure, first and last and all of them are most worthy of our Serious consideration.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="001729_0039_0FB77BDE51F0E928"/>
Among the Ancient Predictions about our Lord Jesus Christ, registred in the holy Bible, it was foretold by the Prophetical Evangelist, the Evangelical Prophet <HI>Isaiah,</HI> [whose Name signifies, <HI>The Salvation of the Lord.</HI> And so clearly does he propose the Methods of Salvation for Sinners, by our anointed Lord, and so plainly does he describe the Person, who is the Author of eternal Salvation, that he may well wear that Name, He foretold,] in the conclu∣sion of the Fifty-third Chapter of his book, That the Lord, our Saviour, should be numbred with Transgressors, while he bare the Sin of Multitudes, and made In∣tercession for Transgressors. Now we find that all the Four Evangelists, who wrote the Life and Death of Jesus Christ, have taken express notice of the Punctual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul∣filment of this Remarkable Prediction.</P>
<P>There were two notable Transgressors crucifyed with our Saviour, while he was hanging on the Cross, bearing the Sins of all Multitudes of his People, making Intercession for the Transgressors that Cru∣cifyed him. One Transgressor was hang∣ing on his Right Hand, another Trans∣gressor was hanging on his Left Hand, He being placed between them, as if he had been the wickedest of all Transgressors.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="001729_0040_0FB77BDFCA4D0238"/>
One of those Transgressors continued Impenitent, manifested his impenitence in the time of his Crucifixion, dyed a mise∣rable Impenitent.'</P>
<P>The other of those Transgressors disco∣vered himself a true Penitent, evidenced his Repentance in the time of his Cruci∣fixion, dyed a truly repenting Believer.</P>
<P>Whether he was a true Convert before his being guilty of the crime, for which he was Crucifyed, or whether he might be Converted after his Apprehension, before his Condemnation; or after his Condem∣nation, before his being brought unto the Place of Execution; or whether he might receive the Principle of Saving Grace, and might begin the exercise of Repentance, after he was nailed to, and hanging on the Cross; are all of them things not so easily and certainly to be determined, as that he was a true Penitent, before he dyed, when∣soever he began to Repent. We have as clear evidence that he was a true Penitent, as we have concerning any Person, that we read of in the whole Book of God. We are sure and certain that he was a true Pe∣nitent. Some of the sure signs, the certain tokens of his Repentance are to be conside∣red by us, with some other considerable things, in the Sermon that is now Preaching.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="001729_0040_0FB77BDFCA4D0238"/>
Our Text may be divided, according to the Two Parts of the Speech of the Peni∣tent Sinner mentioned in the Text. And both Parts of his Speech have several things in them, well worthy of our Obser∣vation.</P>
<P N="1">1. We have the Speech of the Penitent Sinner unto his Impenitent Companion, with the occasion of that part of his Speech.</P>
<P>The occasion of his Speech to his Com∣panion, was the railing expression of his Companion against the Lord Jesus Christ. It is said, <HI>One of the Malefactors, which was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iled at him, saying, If thou be th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Christ, save thy self and us.</HI></P>
<P>If the other Malefactor joyned with him, for a while, in reviling of the Lord Jesus Christ, or doubting whether he were the promised Messiah, yet we are sure that he Repented of that wickedness, that sinful In belief, or disbelieving or questioning the. Truth of the Word of God. But there is room for us to suppose that he did not joyn with him at all, in his Unbelieving dis∣course, nor so much as countenance him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all in his railing expression; or at most, not any more than his Silence from re∣proving him for a while, might seem, in the apprehension of some of the by-Stan∣ders, to countenance him in his Ungodli∣ness;
<PB N="80" REF="001729_0041_0FB77BE305150298"/>
however, certain it is, he did suffici∣ently clear himself, at last, from all com∣munion with him, in his Impiety. For his Speech to his Companion will be his own everlasting Vindication. It will be a per∣petual Testimony for him, that he was en∣tirely separated from the Sin of that Sin∣ner, if he had, for any time, at all partaken with him in his Sin. He shewed that he would no longer have any fellowship with him in his wicked expression, but rather would rebuke him for the wickedness of his words. When his Companion she was his Impenitence by his wicked words, he would not suffer those wicked words to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> unrebuked.</P>
<P>And in his rebuking of his Companion, for his Impenitence, he discovers that he had himself truly Repented, when he sayes, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the some Condemnation?</HI> As if he had said:</P>
<P><Q>If all this great Multitude of People should have so little of the fear of God in them, as to revile an innocent Person suffering here, yet THOU shouldest have more of the fear of God in thee, than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> revile this innocent Person. If thou hast no fear of Man, yet shouldest thou have so much to the fear of God, as to keep thee from adding Sin to Sin. If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="81" REF="001729_0041_0FB77BE305150298"/>
hast no Love to God, yet the present Ex∣ecution of his wrath upon thee, should produce in thee some fear of God, so as to hinder thee from going on Impeni∣tently in thy wickedness. Yea, what thou now feelest of the terrible impressi∣ons of the Justice of God upon thee, in bearing the Temporal Miseries, to which thou art condemned by Man, should make thee fear the more terrible impres∣sions of the Divine Justice upon thee in bearing those Eternal Miseries, to which thou deservest to be condemned by God, so as to consider how thou mayest be delivered from his anger for ever. Thy sufferings now are dreadful, but they will quickly be more dreadful, if thou do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t not fear God so as to use all Means to escape his everlasting indignation.</Q> So does he advise and reprove his Impeni∣tent Companion.</P>
<P>But here is not all the evidence of his own Repentance, for he does not only re∣buke his Companion for his wickedness, but he also acknowledges the Justice of their Punishment; <HI>They were justly condem∣ned, for they received the due reward of their deeds.</HI> And he justifies the Lord Jesus Christ, acknowledging that <HI>He had done no∣thing amiss.</HI> Nor is this all the evidence of
<PB N="82" REF="001729_0042_0FB77BE447D153D8"/>
his Repentance, We have yet farther evi∣dence in the other Part of his Speech, that he truly Repented. For,</P>
<P N="2">2. We have the Speech of the Penitent Sinner unto his Merciful Redeemer; with the consequent of that Part of his Speech. He sayes to Christ, Lord <HI>remember me when thou comest into thy Kingdom.</HI> He had ac∣knowledged that our Lord Jesus Christ was true Man, while he was confessing his in∣nocence. <HI>This Man hath done nothing amiss</HI> But now he acknowledges that he is true God, while he is desiring his Mercy: he calls him <HI>Lord,</HI> Commits and Submits him∣self of his disposal; he owns that he into King, that he hath a Kingdom, that he was to come into his Kingdom; that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had Power to admit whom he pleased into his Kingdom; that he could bring the most miserable Sinner into his Kingdom, as easily as think upon him: and he hum∣bly desires the lowest degree of Mercy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> good thought, that he might be kindly thought upon, that the Merciful Saviour would Mercifully Remember him, when he came into his Kingdom. Thus hum∣bly Prayes the Penitent Sinner.</P>
<P>The gracious and comforting answer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our compassionate Redeemer immediately follows this humble Prayer of the Penitent
<PB N="83" REF="001729_0042_0FB77BE447D153D8"/>
Sinner. <HI>Jesus said unto him, verily, I say unto thee, To day, thou shalt be with me in Paradise.</HI> It means, that immediately after the separation of his Soul from his Body, he should be lodged in a Place of happi∣ness, in a State of blessedness; and should certainly be brought unto the possession of what he humbly desired; he should be re∣membred by the Lord Jesus Christ, when he came into his Kingdom. The Lord Jesus Christ would have him assured, that he would not forget him, and fully satis∣fyed that he would Mercifully Remember him. As if he had said, <HI>Poor Soul, don't fear that I shall forget thee, I'le certainly Remember thee, and thou shalt be sensible of it, this very day, to thy unspeakable Consolation.</HI> Oh! Then let us think well &amp; speak well about our Lord Jesus Christ, whom we find thus ready &amp; willing, in the time of his own bitter sorrows, to shew compassion to a miserable Sinner. What greater encou∣ragement for Faith in Christ, Repentance of Sin, Prayer to God, can be desired, than to have the Lord nigh to us, in all that we call upon him for, and to hear us, and help us, and bestow upon us all that we can de∣sire, as soon as we desire it; yea, to do for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or think?</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="001729_0043_0FB77BE5C9B467D0"/>
The Day of Judgment will be the most glorious Day of God, that ever has been: Then will the glorious Perfections of the ever glorious GOD shine forth most glori∣ously, before the whole World of Men and Angels, in such a manner, as never before. But next unto the Day of Judgment where∣in our Lord Jesus Christ will appear upon a glorious Throne, The Day whereon our Lord hanged on the Cross, may seem the most wonderful Day.</P>
<P>For as at the Day of Judgment, there will be some standing Condemned at One Hand of the glorious Judge, and some Ac∣quitted on the other Hand; so on the Day of our Lords Crucifixion, There was one, Impenitent, on one side of Him, and another Penitent, on the other side of Him.</P>
<P>And as at the Day of Judgment, the Grace of the Lord Jesus Christ will appear glorious in the Salvation of them that are Saved; and his Justice will appear glori∣ous in the Destruction of them that are Condemned. So in the time of his Cru∣cifixion, He appeared glorious both in his Righteousness, and in his Mercy; Righte∣ously suffering one Sinner to continue Im∣penitent in his wickedness, &amp; leaving him to Perish in his Impenitence; and merci∣fully enclining &amp; enabling another Sinner
<PB N="85" REF="001729_0043_0FB77BE5C9B467D0"/>
to Repent of his wickedness, and receiving him into his favour, and promising to re∣ceive him into his Kingdom upon the ma∣nifestation of his Repentance.</P>
<P>But having now considered these things about the Text in general, some of the particular Doctrines, that ly plainly before us in the Text, may be mentioned for our Consideration.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCT. 1. Persons may be equally favoured with External Privileges, for the Exciting and Assisting of Repentance, and other good things; and yet may be wonderfully distin∣guished in respect of their Internal Advan∣tages by those Privileges.</HEAD>
<P>They that enjoy the same External Means of Grace, may not alwayes receive the same benefit by those Means. They that are a-like as to their Outward Enjoy∣ments, may not be a like as to their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣provements of those Enjoyments. This is plain from the Instances in our Text; This Two Malefactors on the Cross, were both of them near unto our Lord Jesus Christ; the dying Saviour was bleeding by their sides, and his blood, for ought appears, offered as freely to one, as to the other; and both of them saw, and heard, and felt very
<PB N="86" REF="001729_0044_0FB77BEB05D992E8"/>
terrible things, that should have imbitter'd Sin to their Souls, and made them willing to have the blood of Christ applyed to their Souls, and their Souls cleansed from Sin with that blood. Yet one remained Impenitent, manifested his Impenitence, proceeded in Sinning against God. The other appeared Penitent, manifested his Repentance, gave glorious demonstrations, that he sincerely Repented of his wicked∣ness, confessed his Sin, acknowledged the Justice of God in his Punishment, pleaded for the Innocence of the Lord Jesus Christ, believed in him for Salvation, shewed the Truth of his Faith by his humble Prayer to the Lord, professed Him before all People; there present, had a speedy, gracious glori∣ous, wonderful &amp; Soul-satisfying answer to his Prayer: A full demonstration of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> &amp; sincerity of his Repentance. Thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> these two distinguished, as to the be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> that they obtained by the Means of Grace, notwithstanding their being so much a like in the External Means that they en∣joyed. And so in other Instances, Persons that are a-like in External Privileges may be unlike, in respect of Spiritual advanta∣ges by those Privileges.</P>
<P>Thus, near the beginning of the World, <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Abel</HI> doubtless had the same Reli∣gious
<PB N="87" REF="001729_0044_0FB77BEB05D992E8"/>
Admonitions about the Affairs of their Souls given to them by their father <HI>Ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</HI> So <HI>Shem</HI> and <HI>Ham</HI> in the Family of <HI>Noah;</HI> so <HI>Isaac</HI> and <HI>Ishmael</HI> in the Fami∣ly of <HI>Abraham;</HI> so <HI>Jacob</HI> and <HI>Esau</HI> in the Family of <HI>Isaac.</HI> And yet they differed much in respect of the benefit which they received by the means that they enjoyed. And in after-times, did not <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Judas</HI> enjoy the same excellent instructions of our Lord Jesus Christ? And were not the same Exhortations delivered by <HI>John the Baptist,</HI> and by our <HI>Saviour</HI> in the hearing of the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> and of the <HI>Sadducees,</HI> that were delivered by them, in the hearing of their other Disciples? And were not the foolish Virgins equally favoured with the wise, in respect of their External Privi∣leges? But how vast the difference be∣tween them, in respect of their advantages by those Privileges? And is it not so in our dayes? Don't we see that as the same Sun that softens the wax, hardens the clay; so the same Word which unto some is the savour of life unto life, is unto others the savour of death unto death. And the Seals of the Covenant may be Seals of Salvation to some, and of Damnation to others And the Providential dispensations of God, both Mercies and Sorrows, ordinary and extra∣ordinary,
<PB N="88" REF="001729_0045_0FB77BF15AD7DF38"/>
may have a very different opera∣tion upon the Subjects of them. Some are bettered and benefitted by what they experience, and furthered in holiness, and prepared for eternal happiness; while o∣thers may be hardned and confirmed in their wickedness, and ripened for eternal misery, by what they experience.</P>
<P>This comes to pass by the Sovereign disposal of the All-wise God, who is not obliged to give an account about any of his Matters, unto any of his Creatures. He may do what he will with his own; we are all the work of his hands, He hath brought us out of nothing into being, and so may dispose of us for Time and for E∣ternity as He pleases. And besides this, we are all Sinners, and by our Sins we all deserve the Wrath and Curse of God for ever, and he would be just, if he should leave us all to Perish eternally in our Sins, He might justly with hold from us oil the Means of Grace, or a blessing from all those Means. It is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth, but of God that shew∣eth Mercy, that any are saved or advanta∣ged by the Means of Grace. Therefore should not any trust in the Means of Grace nor bless themselves in their enjoyment of the Means of Grace, nor imagine that, be∣cause
<PB N="89" REF="001729_0045_0FB77BF15AD7DF38"/>
they enjoy the Means of Grace, there∣fore they are in a happy condition: For Persons may enjoy the Means of Grace, and yet Perish in their Sin. Salvation can∣not be ascertained to all them that enjoy the Means of Grace. For we see that some who enjoy those Means of Grace, that as far as we can discern, are exceedingly benefi∣cial to others, yet perish themselves. The Impenitent Sinner on the Cross perished in his Sin, tho' he were near unto that Sa∣viour, by whom his Penitent Companion obtained Eternal Salvation.</P>
<P>Yet we are not excused from serious di∣ligence, in all suitable endeavours, to get good by all the Means of Grace, tho' Sal∣vation be not infallibly annexed to those means. We must be diligent in the improvement of all the Means of Grace, that we can improve, acknowledging, that if we obtain saving Grace, in the use of any of the means of Grace, it must be a∣scribed unto the Free Grace of God, by whose Grace we are saved, through Faith, and that not of our selves, that is the Gift God.</P>
<P>Therefore we must not say, that because others have got no good by the Means of Grace, there is no hope that we shall ever get any good, and so it is in vain for as
<PB N="90" REF="001729_0046_0FB77BF5A66FD418"/>
to use those Means, But we must in Obe∣dience to God and with Dependence on Christ, for assistance and acceptance, im∣prove the Means of Grace, with hopes for benefit, by the Grace of God, whatever has been the effect thereof unto others, what∣ever may be the event thereof unto our selves.</P>
<P>Had the Penitent Thief on the Cross been discouraged, by hearing the ungod∣ly Expressions of his Impenitent Compa∣nion, he would have made an ill use of what he heard. But when he exercised the Grace of God in his rebuking of his Companion for his Wickedness, and ac∣knowledged the Righteousness, of God and the Innocence of Christ, and pro∣fessed his Faith in the Glorious Redeemer, Prayed to Him for His Mercy, humbly referred himself to His Will; we see that things then issued well to him.</P>
<P>Indeed, that the Impenitent Thief con∣tinued Impenitent, is to be ascribed unto the Wickedness of his own heart; and that the Penitent Thief discovered his Repen∣tance, must be ascribed unto the Free Grace of God. There is Wickedness e∣nough in the Hearts of all Sinners, to keep them for ever in their Impenitence, if the Grace of God were not bestowed on some
<PB N="91" REF="001729_0046_0FB77BF5A66FD418"/>
to promote their Repentance. And God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> under no Obligation to bestow His Grace upon Sinners. But He will be Gracious, to whom He will be Gracious, and He will have Compassion, on whom He will have Compassion. But where God in∣tends to bestow Mercy upon Sinners, He will excite Sinners to improve Means to obtain Mercy: at least, before He makes them sensible that He has bestowed saving Mercy on them. If your Salvation be in∣tended, you shall be excited to use the Means of Salvation. But it will not be enough to enjoy to attend the Means of Salvation; others may do so and get no good by them, as to their Eternal Benefit. But if God has designed your Salvation, He will incline you to improve the Means <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Salvation diligently, seriously, and to Work out your Salvation with Fear and Trembling. And He will work in you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> will and to do according to His good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>easure. And one hopeful Evidence of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Gracious Intention of God, about your salvation, will be your Prayer to Him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat His Grace may be so exercised toward you, and therein glorified.</P>

<HEAD>DOCT II. Impenitent Sinners would be Saved from Eternal Misery, without any Regard to the Glory of God in their Sal∣vation.</HEAD>
<P>There is in all Rational Creatures a Na∣tural desire of Happiness, or Freedom from Misery. They would not be Eternally Miserable. The worst of Sinners have some sort to desire to be Easy and Happy for ever. They think, they pretend, they would be Saved and go to Heaven. They would not be Damned nor go to Hell. If they must leave this World; when they leave it, they would not go to a place of Torment, but to a place of Comfort.</P>
<P>But as for all Impenitent Sinners, while they remain Impenitent, they do not sin∣cerely desire the Glory of God in their Sal∣vation. The Impenitent Malefactor on the Cross cryed, <HI>If thou be the Christ, sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thy self and us.</HI> He Prayed, after a manner for Salvation, for himself and his Compa∣nion. He desired that our Lord Jesus Christ would shew Himself to be the Pro∣mised <HI>Messiah,</HI> by delivering Himself <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the hands of His Enemies, and from His present Sufferings, and by appearing for the Salvation of himself and his Compa∣nion
<PB N="93" REF="001729_0047_0FB77BF70DA2F780"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> present Mise<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> regard for the Glory of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> might be Glori∣fyed in their Salvation.</P>
<P>So it is with all Impenitent Sinners, might they live in Sin for ever, and be free from Misery: they would have no con∣cernment about being Saved to Glorify God: they would be contented to live in Sin for ever, to the dishonour of God. This is the disposition of all Impenitent Sinners Universally.</P>
<P>Indeed some Sinners do, more plainly, discover this disposition, than some other Sinners. But all Impenitent Sinners have so much of this ungodly disposition pre∣vailing in them, as long as they are Impe∣nitent, that might they be Saved and Freed from Eternal Misery, let who will be con∣cerned for the Glory of God, they take no care about Glorifying God.</P>
<P>Thence it is, partly, that so many Sin∣ners do so Shamefully and Wickedly put off the Work of their Souls, from time to time, and follow their sinful courses, until they think they are near Dying, and then they begin to think something must be done, to get ready for Death, to make their Peace with God, that He may be willing to take their Souls into Happiness, when
<PB N="94" REF="001729_0048_0FB77BFC4FEEF6D8"/>
they go out of this Miserable World. They desire that God would take them to Himself, now they think, they can live no longer. But if God remove the occa∣sion of their present fear of Dying, and they seem like to live longer; they can pre∣sently take to the same Course of Sin, that they were in before, they go on still in their Trespasses. They are not concerned For the Glory of God in their Salvation. All the Salvation that they desire, might be separated from the Glory of God.</P>
<P>And so some, that seem to be Mightily concerned for some of the Means of Sal∣vation, Ecclesiastical Privileges, the Seal∣ing Ordinances of God, Baptism and the Supper of the Lord to be Administred to themselves and to others, they are fre∣quently too little concerned for the Glory of God. If they might be admitted to Evangelical Privileges, they would be contented to live in their Sins, to the disho∣nour of God, and the reproach of Religion. So, it seems, it was with some of the Hearers of <HI>John</HI> the Baptist, and therefore he ad∣vised them to bring forth Fruits meet for Repentance, if they desired to be Baptized now they were up grown. So they that desire Gospel Privileges, in a Church State now, must be concerned to prepare
<PB N="95" REF="001729_0048_0FB77BFC4FEEF6D8"/>
for those Privileges, that they may Glorify God in their injoyment of them. They must endeavour that there may be, at least, room to hope that they do sincerely desire to turn from all Sin to God in Jesus Christ, and to live holily by the Grace of Christ, and to follow and perfect Holiness in the fear of God, for the Glory of God; before they can be regularly admitted unto the Table of the Lord, or unto Baptism, if they are come to years of understanding. I have said, <HI>at least, Room to hope thus of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed, it would be a very awful thing, if any People, Professing the Christian Re∣ligion, should be overwhelmed with such Enthusiastical Prophanity, as to live con∣tentedly without the Holy Ordinances of God, and without any care to prepare for those Ordinances, and without any sense of any need of any Preparation for them, and yet think that things are well e∣nough with their Souls, tho' they live in disobedience to the plain, express, positive Commands of our Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>But it would be a no less awful thing, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y People, pretending to Christianity should be carried away with such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Formality, as to desire that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Or∣dinances of God should be prostituted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="96" REF="001729_0049_0FB77BFDDE32AAC8"/>
to the base Lusts of Wicked Sinners; and be Administred unto those that are noto∣riously unprepared for those Ordinances, and evidently without any care to pre∣pare for the improvement of them, and would be hardened in their Wickedness and confirmed in their Impenitence, and have their Damnation dreadfully Sealed upon their Souls, if they should enjoy them.</P>
<P>Nor would it seem well, if any Persons, manifesting a Zeal for God, should igno∣rantly encourage poor Sinners to any such impiety. For how can they think that the Lord will hold them guiltless?</P>
<P>For we should be concerned for the Glory of God, in all the remarkable En∣terprises of our whole Conversation, but peculiarly in our attending of the Holy Ordinances of His Instituted Worship. And it is not for the Glory of God, for us to neglect the Ordinances of God, pre∣tending that we are not fit for them. Herein we Rebel against God. Nor is it for the Glory of God for us to abuse the Ordinances of God by Prostituting them to the Lusts of Sinners, in Administring them to those, that by their clearly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to

<P>But it will be for the Glory of God, if we mourn for our negligence and care∣lessness about our Preparation for the Or∣dinances of God, and beg Pardon for all our sinful Omissions, for the sake of Christ, and Pray for Grace that we may be pre∣pared for the Ordinances of God, accor∣ding to the Directions of the Gospel.</P>
<P>And when we are so prepared, it will be for the Glory of God, for us to desire to have them Administred unto us, according to the Rules of His Word. This would be for the Glory of God &amp; for the Honour of His People in this World and for their Welfare for ever.</P>
<P>But if People are not concerned for the Glory of God, in their Salvation, He will take care for His own Glory, in their con∣fusion.

<HEAD>DOCT. III. Where there is no evidence of Repentance it may be justly feared that there is no right fear of God.</HEAD>
<P><PB N="98" REF="001729_0050_0FB77A6CCBAD4200"/>
If People did rightly Fear God, they would Repent of Sin. So thought the Peninent Sinner on the Cross, about his impenitent Companion, hearing him utter his ungodly expressions, that shewed that he had no Repentance, he feared that he was without the Fear of God, and says, <HI>Dost not thou fear God.</HI> The fear of God will excite Repentance of Sin. So thought the Saint of God, in Psal. 26 1. <HI>The transgression of the Wicked saith within my heart, that there is no fear of God before his Eyes.</HI> If Sinners abide in their Trans∣gression without Repentance, we may justly fear that they do not rightly Fear God. Therefore should we consider the Glorious Perfections of God, that we may Fear Him and repent of Sin. For such is the wickedness of our sinful Hearts, that we are not willing to part with Sin, except we are terrifyed from Sin. <HI>Job</HI> acknow∣leges in Chap. 31. 23. <HI>Destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of His highness I could not endure.</HI> Tho' he were a good Man, yet he found that there was need for him to be kept in aw, by the Fear of God. Then let us consider the Righteousness, the Holiness, the Infinite Purity, the Almighty Power and the Su∣perlative Excellency of God, that we may
<PB N="99" REF="001729_0050_0FB77A6CCBAD4200"/>
be excited to Fear Him, as a God hating all Sin, resolving to Punish all Sin, to de∣story, Eternally, those that continue finally Impenitent in Sin. But let us also consider the Grace, the Mercy, the Compassion, the Loving Kindness of God, that we may Fear the Lord for His Goodness, and Fear Him, as One ready and willing to shew Mercy for the sake of the Lord Jesus Christ unto Miserable Sinners that Penitently repair to Him, in the Name of Christ, for His Pardoning Mercy, notwithstanding all their unworthiness.</P>

<HEAD>DOCT. IV. Penitent Sinners will Desire and Labour that other Sinners may be brought unto Repentance.</HEAD>
<P>This disposition appears in the Peni∣tent Sinner on the Cross; one of the first Evidences of His Repentance, was this, he rebuked his Companion for his wicked∣ness, and laboured to excite him to Fear God, and shewed him that there was great reason for Him to Fear God now he was under Condemnation for his wicked∣ness.</P>
<P>And we read about <HI>David</HI> in Psal. 31. 123 He promises that upon Gods restoring him unto his Favour, after his great Sin, her
<PB N="100" REF="001729_0051_0FB77A6E013EC190"/>
would endeavour that Sinners might be Converted unto the Lord.</P>
<P>And we find about the Apostles of our Lord, that were first called by Him, they Invited others to come and partake with them, in the Benefits of the Merciful Messiah.</P>
<P>And our Lord gives that Counsel to <HI>Peter, When then art Coverted,</HI> (that is, re∣stored from thy Fall) <HI>strengthen thy Bre∣thren</HI> And he remembred the Counsel and practised it, in advising, Pass the <HI>time of your Sojourning bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in fear:</HI> he would not have others to be sinfully confident of their own strength, as he had been of his. But he would have them to fear al∣ways, and walk humbly with God that they might be preserved from Sin.</P>
<P>This will be the disposition of all truly Penitent Sinners; they will endeavour that others may be brought to share with them, in the benefits of Repentance.</P>
<P>For as Impenitent Sinners have so much of the Spirit of the Devil within them, and the Image of Satan upon them, that they desire and labour to hinder other Sinners from turning from Sin to God, in Jesus Christ, they strive to prejudice them a∣gainst the Means of Grace, and would all their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with base, mean thoughts

So Penitent Sinners, that have the Spirit of Christ in them, and the Image of God reinstamped on them, they desire and labour to further others in turning from Sin to God, in Jesus Christ; they endeavour to awaken them out of their sinful security, and they strive to promote in them, good and right Opinions about the Means of Grace, and would have them love the Ordinances of God, and prize the Embassadours of Christ, because then they will be in a hopeful way unto Repentance and Salvation, they will be in the way where the Lord commands His Blessing, even Life for evermore, to them that walk uprightly in that way con∣scientiously improving the means of Grace <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Obedience to God, with reliance on Christ for the Influences of the Holy Spi∣rit, to make those means beneficial for the saving of their Souls.</P>
<P>This may help us to know what sort of People they are that hinder others from repenting of their Sins. They are Impe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Sinners themselves, or at best, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> much more to be done, than has been done, about their own Repentance!
<PB N="102" REF="001729_0052_0FB77A715FA82810"/>
And this will be found the fault of not only the more Prophane Transgressours, who declare their Sin, like <HI>Sodom</HI> and hide it not, and labour all they can to make other People as bad as themselves; and have their various devices to keep their Foolish Companions fast in the Chains of Death, by holding them in the Cords of their Wickedness: But this will be found the Crime of too many Formal Professors, Persons that have only the Form of God∣liness themselves, denying the Power of it, and so labour to make others contented with the Formalities of Religion, without ever endeavouring to experience the reali∣ties of Christianity. And this likewise will be found the Crime of some indiscreet Persons, that stifle the Convictions of Sinners, by leading them into some Com∣pany, or some Exercise, that shall so divert their Convictions, that they shall never be really Converted, they shall never see their need of coming to the Lord Jesus Christ for Salvation. Abundance of Souls are lost, by having their Convictions diverted without being brought unto the Lord Jesus Christ by a saving Conversion.</P>
<P>They that, notwithstanding all suitable Cautions, will still go on to hinder Souls from repairing to the Lord Jesus Christ for

Three or Four sorts of People, at least, might be mentioned, that are in dreadful Danger of being more Miserable than the Impenitent Malefactor on the Cross, be∣cause they are in Danger of Perishing in their Wickedness, after they have been warned by his Example. Who are they?</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Unchast Sinners.</HI> They that seem to be given over to the Sins of Unchastity, and are so far brought under Condemna∣tion, that they have brought shame, dis∣grace, and reproach on their Names, disho∣nourable wounds, mischiefs and ruines up∣on their Interests; and yet have so little of the Fear of God in their Souls, that they venture to go on still in their Wickedness.

<PB N="106" REF="001729_0054_0FB77A75952B5B78"/>
Danger of Perishing under a terrible Con∣demnation, because that such are seldom reclaimed unto Repentance. The Bible shews about the Sin of Unchastity, that none that go to it, return. So few that they are almost none, they are next to none. They make no shew, they are so very few that be recovered from the Sin. Oh! that the Sinners that feel their Consciences now smiting of them, or should feel the lashes of their Consciences, would beg Earnestly of God, in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, for the Purifying Influences of His Holy Spirit, that they might have Grace to Repent, before it be too late.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Drunkards.</HI> They that are given over to the Lust of Drunkenness, and are so far brought under Condemnation for that their Wickedness, that they begin to feel the Woes, that God has Denounced against Drunkards: Their Names are Blasted, their Estates are Wasting and Sinking, their Bodies consuming, if they don't stag∣ger in the Streets, by reason of Strong Drink, but above all their Souls are dread∣fully Destroyed, yea, their Consciences be∣nummed so, that they can't find in their Hearts any the least Inclination to leave off their Wickedness.

Don't the Wrath of GOD Flame upon their Souls? After they are Drunk, before they are quite Sober, they'l say, they will seek it yet again. They'l Profanely say, they'l take another Hair of the same—, tho' they are Damn'd for it. Oh! Let no Person then abide under such Condemna∣tion: But beg for the Holy Spirit of God, that you may be filled with the Spirit, and then you will mourn bitterly before the Lord, for all your Excesses in drinking Strong Drink, and you'l pray for Pardon for the sake of Christ, and you'l beg that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou may be kept out of the way of Temp∣tation to the like Sin for Time to come and you'l watch against the Occasions of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Hypocrites.</HI> That have made a Pro∣fession of Godliness, but have not been Sincere in their Profession. They know that they endure Terrible Things, their Consciences frequently scourging of them Terribly, for their False Dealing with God. And they find it hard to keep up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Shew of Religion, because they have

They have some Sin or other, that they are unwilling to part with. And tho' they know themselves to be Hypocrites and so under Condemnation, yet they will not Repent. Yea, tho' they find God chasti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing of them, in leaving them to sad Falls into great Sins; yet they Repe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t not of their Hypocrisy.

When will they Pray Sincerely and Earnestly for Integrity and Uprightness?</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Covetuous Wordlings;</HI> who know that their Hearts are set upon the World, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that they love the World more than they love God or their Souls, and find God cros∣sing them in their Worldly Designs, disap∣pointing and impoverishing them with one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> after another.

<HEAD>DOCT. VI. The Truth of Repentance for Sin should be discovered in Penitent Sin∣ners, not only by their Serious Concernment for the good of others and the Glory of God, as well as their own good; but also by their Humbleness before God, and their Thankful∣ness unto God.</HEAD>
<P>They must humbly refer themselves un∣to the Sovereign Pleasure of God, and Thankfully accept and improve the least Mercy from God. So the Penitent Sin∣ner in our Text, not only endeavours to reclaim his Impenitent Companion from his unreasonable Wickedness, but he also sensibly acknowledges the Righteousness of God, in the Punishments that were come on them for their Wickedness. And he humbly Prays unto the Lord Je∣sus Christ, and humbly Submits himself unto the Will of that Glorious Lord, and shews a willingness to be contented with the least Mercy that might be conferred on him, and waits on the Lord for His own Time to know His Will. So Hum∣ble, so Thankful was he in his Repentance:</P>
<P>We might here say, that the Penitent Sinner on the Cross, having Preached a good Sermon, he then made a good Prayer, in the hearing of Jesus Christ. His Ser∣mon was Occasioned by what was La∣mentable,
<PB N="112" REF="001729_0057_0FB77A85560659F8"/>
the Railing Language of a Sin∣ful Creature at our Suffering Saviour. His Prayer was answered with what was Com∣fortable, the Gracious Promise of our Mer∣ciful Saviour to a Distressed Sinner.</P>
<P>The Converted Sinner concerned for the Glory of God, perceiving his Uncon∣verted Companion to be in a very bad Frame under his terrible Sufferings, for his heinous Wickedness, he Preaches unto him an Excellent Sermon to promote his Repentance toward God, endeavour∣ing to Excite him unto a Consideration of his Duty, under his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Circum∣stances, advising him to Evidence more of the Fear of God, than had hitherto ap∣peared in his Language, and to consider and Acknowledge the Righteousness of God in the Punishment that was Inflicted upon them both for their Wickedness. And then he Preaches about the Lord Je∣sus Christ, declaring His Righteousness, while he Condemned himself and his Com∣panion for their own Wickedness, and manifested an acceptation of the Pu∣nishment of his own Wickedness, and would have his Companion to be so sensi∣ble of his Ill deserving that he might ac∣cept of the Punishment of his Wickedness. Thus he Preached to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Companion.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="001729_0057_0FB77A85560659F8"/>
But it is possible that the Penitent Sin∣ner, seeing little or no Evidence of Re∣pentance in his Companion, he then Ad∣dresses himself unto the Lord Jesus Christ, and makes unto him an Excellent Prayer, to entreat His Compassion for his own Soul. But probably with an earnest De∣sire still for the Welfare of the Soul of his Companion; for he so Expresses himself in his Prayer, that his Companion might be encouraged to Believe in the Lord Je∣sus Christ. He plainly discovers before all People, his own firm Confidence in the Tender Compassions of his Gracious Lord, so that he could venture the Ever∣lasting Affairs of his never-dying Soul with Him. This might have been for the Encouragement of his Companion. How∣ever, in his Prayer, <HI>Lord, Remember me, when thou comest into thy Kingdom;</HI> he Ac∣knowledges the Lord Jesus Christ to be the Son of God, the Saviour of Souls, and the King of Heaven; that He was then going into His Kingdom, that if He had but a kind Thought about him, and would but think upon him with Compassion, it would be to his Advantage; and he is contented with the smallest Mercy, a kind Thought: And he desires this Kindness of the Lord, when he should come into
<PB N="114" REF="001729_0058_0FB77A89466A41F8"/>
His Kingdom. He would wait His Will about the Time and Way for the bestowing of any the least Mercy that He should see cause to bestow upon him. Thus he Prayed to his Redeemer.</P>
<P>Now for the USE of this Doctrine.</P>
<P>Let all Persons thus discover the Truth of Repentance for Sin, imitate the Pe∣nitent Sinner on the Cross. in his discove∣ring of his Repentance for Sin.</P>
<P>It is not enough to say, that you have Faith in your Souls, toward the Lord Je∣sus Christ; nor is it enough to say, that you have Repentance toward God in your hearts; but you must endeavour to satisfy others, that you do truly Repent.</P>
<P>All Sinners have dishonoured God, by Sinning against Him. They should there∣fore endeavour to honour Him by Repen∣ting of their Sins. But some of their Sins have been committed before others, they should therefore endeavour that others may know, as well about their Repentance for Sin, as they have known about their Com∣mission of Sin. The Salve should cover the Sore: and if the Sins of any Persons have been openly committed, then should Repentance for those their Sins, be openly evidenced.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="001729_0058_0FB77A89466A41F8"/>
And if God hath, in His Holy Provi∣dence, brought Sinners out upon the Stage of the World, to make them to be Exam∣ples unto others, then it is their Duty to Glorify God before the World, by con∣fessing of those their more Secret Sins, that have Provoked the Lord to leave them unto the more Open Sins, that have ex∣posed them before the World; that others may be warned against, and so preserved from the like Out-breakings into Sin, so as to prevent further Dishonour from coming <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Holy Name of God, by Open Sin∣ning. This agrees with the Advice to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> a Bad Man, as also with the Prac∣tice of <HI>David,</HI> a Good Man; when their Sins found them out, and they were, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Holy Providence of God, openly ex∣posed. They were then to give Glory to God by making Penitent Confession of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eir Sins before the World, that others <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight hear and fear, and might no more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in so against the Lord.</P>
<P>If one Sinner has been left, by the So∣vereign Providence of God, to stumble <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fall grievously into any great Iniquity, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as mightily to Dishonour God and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound his own Soul, and grieve the Hearts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Neighbours; it is for the Honour of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od, and the Benefit of others, that he

tell them of the Evils, at or by which he began to stumble, and that he warn them against those Evils. Thus,</P>
<P>If Sinners have neglected Secret Prayer to God, or grown slack to, or cold in, or careless about, any other Duty of Godli∣ness, and God has punished them for their secret Neglects, by His leaving them to fall into more Open Sin, that brings them under publick Shame, they should ac∣knowledge how they began to leave God, and should acknowledge the Righteousness of God in leaving them, and should there∣withal advise others to take heed, lest they begin to leave God, by giving way to se∣cret Sins of Omission, that are often pu∣nished by the guilty Sinners being left unto Open Sins of Commission, that bring the woful Sinners at last unto Open Pu∣nishment. If Sinners have been remarka∣ble for their Disobedience to their Superi∣ors, and God has punished them for their Disobedience, by leaving them to further and greater, and more Heinous and Open Crimes, and they come to be cut down by the Sword of Civil Justice, and must Dye before their Time, for their being Wicked overmuch, it is their duty to Advise all and especially Young People, to avoid all sinful Disobedience to their Lawful Supe∣riors
<PB N="117" REF="001729_0059_0FB77A8A9A484198"/>
lest God cut them off in the midst of their Days, and take them away by some dreadful stroke of His Wrath.</P>
<P>If Sinners know in their own Conscien∣ces, that they were very careless about the Religious Observation of the Lord's Day, and God hath left them so to some other Iniquity, that they are Openly Pu∣nished, as they justly fear, for their Pro∣phanation of the Sabbath of the Lord; they should warn others, that Sabbath breaking is a costly Sin, that they may dread the Wickedness, the Sacrilage of Robbing God of His own Time, that He hath reser∣ved in peculiar for His Holy Worship.</P>
<P>And if Sinners know, and can truly charge themselves, that they have not kept such a Guard as they should have kept, on their Tongues, nor had so much care of Truth, as they should have had in their speech, but have sometimes talked too much at random, without the Fear of God; and God hath punished them for that their Wickedness, by leaving them to more grievous and ruining Transgressions; They should warn others to take heed to their Ways, that they Sin not with their Tongues, but keep their Tongues from E∣vil, and their Lips from speaking Guile.</P>

be produced as a good Example for this Thing. <HI>The cautioning of Sinners against E∣vil Speaking.</HI> For he was ready to reprove his Companion for his Ungodly Expressi∣ons. He would have him to govern his Tongue more with the Fear of God.</P>
<P>The Impenitent Sinner on the Cross, doubtless might be Ignorant enough, and he might have had very little Information about our Lord Jesus Christ; he might on∣ly hear some general Report that he was the <HI>Messiah,</HI> the Saviour of the World, be∣fore he came to hang by him on the Cross. And so his Ignorance might be some Oc∣casion of his Unbelief, that he discovered in saying, <HI>If Thou be the Christ,</HI> save thy self and us. But yet he was not without great Fault in his Ungodly Expressions forasmuch as we know, that he should have been more Confiderate than to make a Doubt, whether One that had so many Tokens of His being the <HI>Christ,</HI> were in∣deed the <HI>Messiah.</HI> But the Penitent Sinner did well to Admonish him for his unfi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Discourse. And so should they that have been Faulty, and are brought to Repen∣tance themselves, Admonish others against the ways of Sin, that they have experien∣ced to be Pernicious to their own Souls.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="001729_0060_0FB77A8C21356760"/>
And if Sinners know, and can justly charge themselves [and Oh! what Num∣bers that live under the Gospel, may so charge themselves, and very justly?] that they have dreadfully despised the Lord Jesus Christ, neglected the great Salvation, delaying to accept the Offers of His Gos∣pel, and to comply with the Motions of the Holy Spirit of God, and so have lived in their Impenitent Unbelief, and are sa∣tisfyed that the Righteous and Holy God us therefore given them up unto their own Hearts Lusts, and unto the Power of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the punishment for their wickedly refusing to accept the gracious Offers of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Merciful Saviour; They should seri∣ously tell others about the Danger of all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> delayes, and solemnly warn them against the Evil of all such needless de∣layes, and earnestly excite them to make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aste and make sure about the Affairs of their Souls, and presently give themselves unto the Lord Jesus Christ, and sincerely comply with the Invitations of Salvation immediately, that they may not receive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Grace of God in vain, lest the Lord would be provoked to give them up Eter∣nally unto the Lusts of their own Hearts &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ower of Satan, who will be ready to hur∣ry them into Soul-Desolating Abominati∣on.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="001729_0061_0FB77A9220D307C8"/>
For so it is very often with Sinners living under the Gospel, that have a Day of Grace, enjoying the means of Grace and the strivings of the Spirit of God, urging them to accept the Offers of Salvation by the Lord Jesus Christ, and heartily con∣sent to receive Him as their External Sa∣viour; they are not for a present consent, but they carele<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly delay and put off this work from time to time, until the Holy Spirit of God is grieved, so that He with∣draws and goes from them; and then the Evil Spirit comes to them and he takes possession of their Souls, and fills them and rules <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and leads them away Captive according to his will, and they Perish for ever in their Impenitence; and some of them do, before they Dye, become guilty of greater Abominations, than are com∣monly committed by them that never lived under the Gospel. According to what we find in Psal. 81. 11. Where sayes the Lord, <HI>My People would not hearken to my voice, and Israel would none of me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> gave them up unto their own hearts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and they walked in their own Counsels.</HI> But when Sinners be so forsaken by God, they may fear that Satan will quickly be their Councellor. Thence have some that once enjoyed the Offers of the Gospel, but re∣jected
<PB N="121" REF="001729_0061_0FB77A9220D307C8"/>
those Offers, been given up to an astonishing efficacy of Errour, they re∣ceived not the love of the Truth, that they might be Saved. And for this cause, doth God send them strong Delusions, that they believe a Lye, that they may be Damned. They take such incurable Offence at the Lord Jesus Christ, or at some thing in His Gospel, or Worship, or People, or Provi∣dential Dispensations, that they forsake. Him and His Holy Ordinances, and will never be recovered, never be reduced, ne∣ver be renewed again unto Repentance.</P>
<P>But God may suffer some, that have neg∣lected the great Salvation a long time, to ill so grievously into Sin, that their Falls may awaken them out of their sinful se∣curity, and when they are thorowly a∣wakened so as to see their Miserable Con∣dition, He may by His Holy Spirit, lead them unto the Lord Jesus Christ, and help them to repair to Him with their distressed and burthened Souls for Salvation. The Prodigal Sinner may go far from his Fa∣thers House, &amp; may bring himself into grie∣vous distresses, and while he is under those distresses, he may come so far to himself, that he may bethink himself, and call to mind how things were with him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> former days, and how he enjoyed the

<PB N="122" REF="001729_0062_0FB77A93A3398078"/>
Offers of Mercy, but refused then to ac∣cept those Offers; and he may, by the Grace of God, be assisted to seek the Face of God, and Pray to the Lord in the time of his Affliction, so as to obtain Mercy and be received into the Favour of God, for the sake of Christ, after a long time of wandring from the Lord! Was it not so with Repenting <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>asseh?</HI> Was not he such an Instance of the Sovereign Grace of God? He had enjoyed a Religious Education, but he had sadly abused what he had enjoyed, he became a very Wicked Sinner; and among other ways of his Wickedness, he Wickedly shed abundance of Innocent Blood, and maintained Con∣versation with some who dealt with Fa∣miliar Spirits and was very Wicked be∣fore the Lord and before the World. And God brought him into Trouble for his Wickedness, but in the time of his Trou∣ble he sought the Lord, and the Lord was entreated of him, and he knew that the Lord was God. He acknowledged Jeho∣vah, the God of Israel for his God. It is hop'd that he became a true Penitent, that he truly Repented of his Sin.</P>
<P>But when Sinners become true Peni∣tents, it becomes them to evidence the Truth of Repentance by their endeavours
<PB N="123" REF="001729_0062_0FB77A93A3398078"/>
that other Sinners may be brought unto Repentance. They must not say, <HI>What can we do? People won't care to mind any thing that we say to them. They will but reproach and revile us, if we should say any thing to them concerning Repentance.</HI> They must not excuse themselves thus. For the Penitent Sinner-on the Cross did not ex∣cuse himself, tho' the Lord Jesus Christ was between him and the other Malefactor; yet when he discerned a convenient Op∣portunity for him to say something for God and for Christ, he then said what he thought proper for him then to say, for the convincing of his Companion of his Wickedness, and the reclaiming of him from it. He did not plead, <HI>That Wicked Sinner has rail'd at the Lord of Glory, and therefore it is in vain for me to say any thing to him. There's no hope that he'l mind any thing that I say.</HI> But he was willing to do his Duty, whatever might be the Success. He leaves that with God. And one E∣vent of his going his Duty, is this that it is Recorded for his Everlasting Commen∣dation, that he pleaded against Sin, and for God, and for Jesus Christ, in the saddest condition of Humiliation, that our Lord was ever in, while He was living upon Earth, before He gave up the Ghost.
<PB N="124" REF="001729_0063_0FB77A9D80FA9088"/>
And tho' the Penitent Sinner did not pre∣vail with his Impenitent Companion to Repent, that we can discern, yet it tended <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the Glory of God and his own honour, that he attended his Duty. And so it will be with others, that will attend their Du∣ty in their Season. They shall not lose their Labour. And besides this, Repen∣ting Sinners do owe more than this unto the Glorious God, for what He has done for them, in granting unto them saving Repentance. They should acknowledge their Thankfulness unto Him for His Grace, by endeavouring that others may be Partakers with them in His Grace, or at least, that He may have His Grace Glorifyed, in helping them to perform their Duty.</P>
<P>But this must not be all that Repenting Sinners do for the Glory of God, to en∣deavour that others may be brought un∣to Repentance; But they must Pray to God for their own Souls. Thus did the Penitent Sinner on the Cross, he not only suitably advised his Companion to what would have been for his benefit, if he had taken his advice; but he also took time, while there was time, to Pray unto the Glorious Redeemer to remember him, and he showed his humility in his Prayer, and
<PB N="125" REF="001729_0063_0FB77A9D80FA9088"/>
his Resignation to the Will of Christ, in Praying for the smallest Mercy, acknow∣leging the Sovereignty of the Lord Jesus Christ, referring himself entirely to His Pleasure. So should others do But O∣mitting other things, One Doctrine more may be mention'd, and it is a very com∣fortable One.</P>

<P>Let sinful Persons be sure that they truly Repent of all their Sins, with unfeigned Re∣pentance, and let them endeavour in all fit ways to shew the Truth of Repentance; and they may justly expect that the Mer∣ciful Saviour will not only be ready to Pardon all their former Sins, without up∣braiding them with any of them, and willing to admit them into His Favour immediately upon their manifestation of Repentance; but also He will certainly receive them, at last, into His Kingdom. No sooner had the Penitent Sinner made his humble Prayer unto his then Crucifyed Lord, but immediately thereupon our now Glorifyed Lord presently shews Fa∣vour

Thence might the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> be fully satisfyed (as well as by what is other wayes Re∣vealed) that Believers on Christ will be with Christ, in happiness, immediately af∣ter the Dissolution, the Separation of their Souls from their Bodies.

<P>It was one mentioned for the Dis∣grace, but it is indeed for the Glory of our Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>That he Receiveth Sinners.</HI> Penitent Sinners will ever be wel∣come to Him, he will in no wise, cast out any of them, that come to Him with Repenting Souls. Never did he turn a∣way one Soul, never will He turn away one Soul, that comes to Him, desiring Deliverance from Sin. He is most ready, forward, willing to receive such. And he says, in Mat. 9. 13. <HI>I am come to call Sinners to Repentance.</HI> Then be sure he will not reject them that Obey His Call but will receive them.</P>

<P>Then let all Sinners be Advised to make haste, and make sure about their unfeigned Repentance, upon the first In∣vitations to Repentance. Does our Lord Jesus Christ readily admit Penitent Sin∣ners into His Favour, immediately upon their Expressions of Repentance, and speedily assure them of Admission into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Kingdom? Then let Sinners be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eady and willing to comply with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Invitations of the Gracious Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Repentance.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="001729_0065_0FB77AA13311AB60"/>
And if there be those that have slight∣ed many Invitations, Let them comply with the present Invitations to Repent. Oh! Repent Now and turn from all your Transgressions that so Iniquity may not be your Ruin. Consider God's Laws and Examine your Souls and Lives, Con∣fess and Bewail before God, what you find contrary to the Laws of God in your Souls and Lives. Acknowledge that you deserve to be Destroyed for ever, because you have Transgressed the Laws of God. Beg Pardon for your Transgressions for the sake of Christ. Repair to the Blood of Christ for Par∣don of all Sins past, and look to Him for Grace to Glorify God, in Time to come, with an Holy Conversation. These are some Things belonging to Repen∣tance, and some of you have been often advised about such Things. But if you have never attended them, you should Now attend them and Repent Now.</P>
<P>If the Penitent Sinner had not heard about the Lord Jesus Christ, before he was hanged on the Cross, then it seems that this was the first Invitation, the ever he had unto Gospel Repentance And he complyed with it. And if he had neglected to comply with any for∣mer
<PB N="129" REF="001729_0065_0FB77AA13311AB60"/>
Invitations, we find that his. Now complying with the present Invitation, was not in vain. Therefore</P>
<P>Let us all now comply with the present Invitations to Repentance. You are now Invited in the Name and Fear of God to Repent; but none of you know that you shall have another Invitation, if you don't comply with this.</P>
<P>And remember, tho' true Repentance be never too late, yet late Repentance is too seldom true. Those that have been brought under fearful Expectations of speedy Death, and have seemed mightily concerned about their Souls; and have made their promises, how well they would live in time to come, if God would be pleased to spare their Lives and continue them longer in the World, and have been delivered from their Fears; Few of them have discovered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Truth of Repentance by their after Conversation. I say very few of them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> appear true Penitents. The most of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> quickly forget their Distresses and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Promises, and are as bad as ever, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> some worse than ever, before many Months pass away.</P>
<P>Therefore should we take heed lest we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eive our own Souls, by pretending
<PB N="130" REF="001729_0066_0FB77AA405A49098"/>
or supposing that we may safely put off Repentance till we come to Dye, and then may, in drawing some of our last breaths, do enough about Repentance, to secure the welfare of our Souls: for there is danger about those who delay Renpen∣tance, lest they be hardened for ever and confirmed in Sin. They, that think Re∣pentance may be attended and performed well enough in a short time, discover too much of Ignorance about Repentance. Indeed the Thief on the Cross had but a short time to Repent, if he began there to Repent. But if God enabled <HI>him</HI> to Repent in a short time, on such an ex∣traordinary occasion; yet this may not encourage others to delay Repentance with an imagination that they can well enough Repent in a short time. Nor can we be sure that the Thief then began to Repent, while he was Hanging on the Cross. He might have the Foundation of Repentance laid in his Soul, a great while before then, so that the Principle of Grace in his Soul, being then excited, he might then go on to Build upon the Old Foundation that was laid a long while before that time. However it is utterly uncertain that he was ever guilty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> delaying his Repentance with an Ex∣pectation
<PB N="131" REF="001729_0066_0FB77AA405A49098"/>
to Repent, well enough, at last. But very certain it is, that our Lord Jesus Christ will never come again to be Crucifyed any more, to give any other Sinner such an Opportunity to Repent. On this Instance we may say, as hath been said a long Time ago. If the Peni∣tent Sinner on the Cross began his Re∣pentance there, then there was one Sin∣ner that began to Repent in some of the last Hours of his Life, and is gone to Glory; and but one such Instance recorded in all the Hystories of more than four thousand Years. <HI>There was One, that none might Despair; and but One, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> might Presume.</HI> And we should remember that God hath alwayes promised Pardon to the Penitent; but He hath never promi∣sed Repentance to the Presumptuous. Therefore let all of us Repent Now, make haste and make sure Now about Re∣pentance, hoping for the Pardoning Mercy of God for the sake of Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>And YOU that have no expectation at all to hear another Sermon about Repen∣tance, Publickly Preached unto you, throughout Eternal Ages. Oh! Repent Now and be Awakened &amp; Encouraged un∣to Repentance by what you have heard.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="001729_0067_0FB77AA57936D1F0"/>
You have head something about the broken heart of a Repenting Sinner, that will be acceptable with God through Jesus Christ (in the former Part of the Day) God can Glorify His Grace in giving you such an heart, and in healing your broken heart. And you have heard now (in the later part of the Day) about some of the last Words of a very bad Man, that Dyed (for ought we know) with an hard, stupid, unbroken, impenitent Heart. Oh! Be not you like him, without the Fear of God, while under Condemnation. You have heard about some of the last Words of one that, tho' he had been a very had Man, yet he became a very good Man before he Dyed. Oh! Be you like him, Do you follow him in Repenting of Sin, Evidencing the Truth of Repentance, Being sincerely concerned for the Glory of God, and the good of o∣thers, Humbly committing and resigning your self into the Merciful Hands of the Almighty Redeemer of Souls And you have heard about some of the last Words of that Almighty Redeemer of Souls, and how ready and willing he is to receive into his favour truly Penitent Sinners, and to heal their broken hearts, and fill their wounded &amp; troubled Souls with the sweet
<PB N="133" REF="001729_0067_0FB77AA57936D1F0"/>
Consolations of his Holy Spirit, and to ad∣mit them at last, into his Glorious King∣dom of Life, and Light, and Joy, and Peace and Eternal Blessedness.</P>
<P>Be assured, that our blessed Lord has the same Heart now He is in Heaven, that He had while He was upon Earth. And He is now as full of Grace, and Mercy, Love and Compassion as ever, toward Mi∣serable, Unworthy Sinners, that humbly Cry to Him for Grace and Mercy. He hath not forgotten to be gracious, now He is in Glory. Then, if notwithstanding all his Griefs and Pains, that he endured while he was hanging on the Cross, He had leisure to take notice of and shew kind∣ness to a distressed, broken hearted Sinner, making his addresses to Him for his fa∣vour; We may be sure he will not now disregard those, that humbly seek to Him for his Mercy, how unworthy soever they are. He did not upbraid the Penitent Sin∣ner with his Unworthiness, when he cryed to Him for his Merciful Remembrance.</P>
<P>Let this Consideration be for your en∣couragement. If you sincerely Repent, the Lord Jesus Christ will certainly have Mercy upon you. Remember <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Manasseh</HI> that were guilty of Murder; and yet they Repented and Obtained Mercy.
<PB N="134" REF="001729_0068_0FB77AAD0CB7B8D8"/>
Remember that some of the Murderers of our Lord Jesus Christ Repented and Ob∣tained Mercy, and their Sins were blotted out, and their Souls were Washed &amp; Saved by the blood, which they sinfully shed: Tho' no Murderer hath eternal Life abiding in him, yet they, that have Grace given them to Repent of their Murders, with Unfeigned Repentance, will have their Souls cleared from the guilt of their Mur∣ders by the Righteousness of Christ, and so shall be blessed with Life Eternal.</P>
<P>But now you are going to hear the last Words that ever I expect to Speak to you in this Place.</P>
<P>What shall I say unto you! Oh! Be not deceived about the Affairs of your Soul. Be not deceived by trusting to your own Righteousness. Be not deceived by ma∣king a Righteousness of your own with any thing that you think you do about Repentance. You cannot but know that if you had Lived without Sin, all your Days ever since you came into the World, (had such a thing been possible) Yet you brought with you into this World enough Sin to deserve your Eternal Destruction. You cannot but know that all your best endeavours about Repenting of Sin, have so much of sinful Pollution cleaving unto
<PB N="135" REF="001729_0068_0FB77AAD0CB7B8D8"/>
them, that they deserve the wrath of God for ever. And you cannot but know that all your own Righteousness will come Infinitely short of the Righteous Demands of the Holy Law of God. There∣fore when you have done all that you can, to endeavour that Things may be well between God and your own Soul, and all that you can, to endeavour in all fit Ways to evidence the Truth of Repen∣tance before the World, by Confessing and Bewailing your Sins, Mourning Bitterly for them all, and Lamenting your Mise∣ries before the Lord. Acknowledging His Righteousness, and Warning others upon all suitable Occasions to take heed of all the Paths of the Destroyer, against which you may Advise them, and by begging the Prayers of all that Fear God for you, and Praying to God for your own Soul; Don't imagine, that by any of these, or any such Things, you deserve any the least Favour from God. Renounce all Confi∣dence in your own Righteousness. Re∣member it is a great Sin to go to Esta∣blish a Righteousness of your own, by any of your own Doings, or by Repen∣tance for Sin. But when you have done all that can be done, acknowlege that you are Unprofitable before God, and that
<PB N="136" REF="001729_0069_0FB77AB03034FCF8"/>
you deserve nothing of Good from God, and that God must Glorify His Free Grace unto you, if you are Saved. And keep still relying on the Lord Jesus Christ for all Good; for Pardon, for Healing, for Assistance, for Acceptancce, for every Blessing, that is needful for your Soul. And beg of God, that whatever He de∣nies you, yet you may not be Deceived about your Soul, so as to lose your Soul for ever; that whatever He denies you, yet you may be remembred by the Mer∣ciful Redeemer, and received into His Kingdom, tho' a Miserable Sinner. And if it should be so, that after all your En∣deavours about your Soul, the Righteous and Holy Lord should see Cause to hide the Light of His Countenance from your Soul, so that you must go out of this World in the Dark, without any com∣fortable Satisfaction of his being Recon∣ciled to your Soul, or Assurance of the Pardon of your Sins; yet be sure to Justi∣fy Him in all, Acknowlege His Righte∣ousness and Holiness to the last; and try to keep the Eyes of your Soul upon the Lord Jesus Christ, remembring that He is able to Save unto the uttermost, all that come to God thro' Him, seeing He ever liveth to make intercession for them, and
<PB N="137" REF="001729_0069_0FB77AB03034FCF8"/>
He can Save at the Last. And remember what the Penitent Sinner on the Cross hath Experienced, at the Last, for your Encou∣ragement. God can take from the Cross into Paradise, and from the Gallows in∣to Glory; and He can help you so to Re∣pent of all your Sins that you may Glo∣rify Him before you Dye.</P>
<P>And so far as you may be Encouraged by this (and this may be some Encou∣ragement) you may be satisfyed, that they that Fear God will not cease to Pray to the Lord for you. They will continue to take all proper Seasons, both in Publick now, and in Private and in Secret to Pray for you, as long as you continue a proper Subject for Prayer. But if you would have any saving benefit by their Prayers, you must be sure to continue to take all Times to Pray for your self, and continue Repenting of Sin as long as you Live, and continue Believing on Christ as long as you Breath, and keep longing for such Manifestations of Gods Love in Christ Je∣sus unto your own Soul, that you may be able truly to say (as in Psal. 49. 15.) <HI>God will redeem my Soul from Hell, and he will receive me.</HI></P>
