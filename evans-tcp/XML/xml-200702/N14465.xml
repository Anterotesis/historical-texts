<HEAD>THE LIFE and DYING CONFESSION of <HI>RICHARD BARRICK,</HI> HIGH-WAY ROBBER.</HEAD>
<P>I <HI>RICHARD BARRICK,</HI> was born in <HI>Ireland,</HI> in the month of February, in the year 1763, and brought up in the Found∣ling-Hospital: I never could read nor write. At ten years of
<PB N="7" REF="018324_0005_0FA5CDFDB860BD40"/>
age I went as apprentice to <HI>James Saun∣ders,</HI> a Silk-weaver in <HI>Spittlefield</HI> Parish, lived with my master about three years, but he starved and froze me almost to death, for which I left him, and roved through the streets, and frequently stole small things from shop-windows.</P>
<P>I WENT to <HI>Salt-petre Bank</HI> and joined a gang of thieves. We stole from many people for the space of a year; when I was taken up for stealing a handkerchief, and carried before the Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> who sent me to goal. I was tried and found not <HI>innocent;</HI> was complimented with thirteen stripes, <HI>which is Continental colours,</HI> signifying, that I should be ho∣noured in <HI>America</HI> with the <HI>Hibernian</HI> coat of arms, i. e. two sticks <HI>rampant,</HI> one couchant, a string <HI>pendant,</HI> and an <HI>Irishman</HI> at the end of it.</P>
<P>I JOINED my old gang again, and con∣tinued picking pockets for one year, and then was taken up and commit∣ted to goal, and lay there eleven weeks for trial; then tried and found guil∣ty.
<PB N="8" REF="018324_0006_0FA5CDFE5DF39270"/>
They told me they would pardon me if I would enter on board one of his Majesty's ships; this I consented to, but made my escape before I got to the ship. I returned back to <HI>Salt-petre Bank,</HI> where I joined my old companions in iniquity; went on picking pockets for six months, and was apprehended on suspicion of robbery, and was sent on board a vessel in which I came to <HI>New-York</HI></P>
<P>THEN I deserted and went to <HI>Long-Island,</HI> and lived with Mr. <HI>Volentine Wil∣liams;</HI> I left him and lived with Mr. <HI>Kirk,</HI> fifteen months, intending to learn Paper-Making. <HI>During this time I was as honest as the times would allow.</HI> I left Mr. <HI>Kirk,</HI> and went to <HI>Horse-Neck,</HI> intending to return to the place from whence I came, and follow my old trade of <HI>Basket-Making.</HI></P>
<P>SOON after this, I and my comrades went to <HI>Long Island,</HI> with an intent to rob <HI>James Ulits;</HI> but the weather being very severe, we turned back. On our return, we met with a <HI>British</HI> vessel which we boarded, and carried her into <HI>Stanford.</HI> We then went
<PB N="9" REF="018324_0007_0FA5CDFF4C2705E0"/>
back to Mr. <HI>Ulit's</HI> in the night, and told him he must get up, for his brother's child was very sick—He supposing us to be robbers, call'd for his firelock: We then forced in at the windows, and demanded his money. He said he had none; but his wife asked us how much we wanted? I answered one hundred pounds, Mr. <HI>Ulit</HI> went down cellar with a light in his hand, and we followed him; he took a horn from under a hogshead, which contained one hundred and ninety odd guineas. He then attempted to count out our hundred pound which we demanded; but we told him that as he made some resistance at first, we would take all he had. He then gave us another horn, which con∣tained about forty guineas: Then he gave us a number of dollars. We went out of the house, but soon concluded that if he had so many guineas, it was more than probable he had some other sort of gold; therefore we went back and demanded the remainder. Then he gave us another horn, containing thir∣ty two half joes. We also took his plate and cloathing, to the value of one hun∣dred
<PB N="10" REF="018324_0008_0FA5CE0348E6C730"/>
dollars. We ordered him to give us some liqour; he obeyed us. Then we went back to our boat unmolested, and gave the man who took care of the boat two guineas.</P>
<P>AFTER this we went to <HI>Copt-Island,</HI> where we divided our booty.</P>
<P>FROM thence we went to <HI>Greenwich,</HI> and tarried there until our money grew short: Then we went over to <HI>Long-Island,</HI> to the house of one <HI>Allberson</HI> where we knocked at the door and de∣manded a light: We then demanded his money: He gave us money and plate to the amount of two hundred dol∣lars: We eat and drank in his house, and then ordered him to keep the matter se∣cret for three weeks, which I have reason to think he was fool enough comply with. After dividing the boo∣ty, I returned to <HI>Stanford,</HI> and tar∣ried there until my money grew short.</P>
<P>I AND my comrades went to <HI>Long-
<PB N="11" REF="018324_0009_0FA5CE03D9C26410"/>
Island,</HI> and order'd one <HI>Peter Sniffing</HI> to open his door, which he did; we then made a civil demand upon him, which was, <HI>Give us all your money;</HI> he said he had none. (Take notice that as <HI>Sniffing</HI> knew me, I did not enter the house:) After his refusal one of our gang came out to me for advice: I told him to flash a pis∣tol in <HI>Sniffing's</HI> face, and then he would comply; but this had not the desir∣ed effect; for <HI>Sniffing</HI> had two pistols and other weapons: However, we dis∣armed and robbed him of money and cloathing.</P>
<P>WE went from there to <HI>Cow-Neck,</HI> and attacked the house of Mr. <HI>John Mitchel;</HI> his wife saw us coming, upon which she blew out the candles and bar'd the doors: We ordered him to open the door, which he refused; then we burst the door open with a stone. One of <HI>Mitchel's</HI> family fired at us and wounded one of our gang. <HI>Mitchel</HI> fell upon the wounded man who cried for mercy. We retired a little way and held consultation: Our leader said that one man was wounded
<PB N="12" REF="018324_0010_0FA5CE048D7E6820"/>
and should not be left behind; then we made the second attack upon the house, but was obliged to retreat again; then we made the third attack, upon which they left the room: We then brought off the wounded man, who (like a true christian) begged us to retaliate upon <HI>Mitchel,</HI> as he was unable to do it himself. All we took from the house was the fire∣arms: Then we went to our boat; one of our party said he wanted some retaliation; that one returned back and met <HI>Mitchel's</HI> son at the door, whom he instantly shot dead. After he had shot the young man he said he had got satisfaction in behalf of his wounded partner. We made the best of our way to the boat and went to <HI>New-Rochel,</HI> where we was hailed by the guard: We told them we had a man wounded by the Refugees. We ran away from the guard, leaving our boat and all behind except our fire-arms.</P>
<P>WE went to <HI>Greenwich</HI> and gave relief to our wounded partner; there I parted with my comrades. From thence I went to <HI>New-Haven,</HI> intending to get
<PB N="13" REF="018324_0011_0FA5CE082C91FD08"/>
some employment. I got no work there, and went to <HI>Norwich</HI>—No employment there, I returned to <HI>Greenwich,</HI> where I met with the wounded man, in compa∣ny with a well man. The well man went with me to <HI>Long-Island.</HI> We intended to rob the house of Mr. <HI>Titus;</HI> but a guard being kept at his house, we hid in a swamp, and went from thence to <HI>Sand's-Point.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER this I and others broke open the house of Mr. <HI>James Mots,</HI> and took from him fifty guineas, besides plate and cloathing, to the amount of two hundred pounds. We went to <HI>Greenwich</HI> and divided the booty: Then we parted and met again in a fortnight. Then we went to the house of Mr. <HI>John Sands</HI> on <HI>Long-Island.</HI> Mr. <HI>Sands</HI> let us in, I demanded his money: He denied having any. I made search and sound fourteen dollars, one silver spoon, twenty-three guineas and one half joe, together with cloathing and plate, to the amount of ten pounds. Then <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> made off, but was pursued so close that one of our party was taken. We
<PB N="14" REF="018324_0012_0FA5CE08592FA5A8"/>
rescued him; but the pursuers pressed so hard upon us, that they took two more of our party, and brought them to trial; but they availed themselves of a stratagem, and told a false story; for they told the pursuers that they were not in our gang; but were endeavouring to take us prisoners. I escaped myself and kept concealed some time. I hid in a hollow rock. After this I went to <HI>Hog-Island,</HI> in company with other sinners: We rob∣ed one Mr. <HI>Ledlow</HI> of six dollars and a watch, and a quantity of cloathing. We returned to <HI>Greenwich,</HI> from thence to <HI>Heton's-Neck;</HI> There we broke open a house and robbed the master of one hun∣dred and sixty dollars, and cloathing to the amount of thirty dollars.</P>
<P>AFTER that we went to <HI>Green∣wich;</HI> and from thence to <HI>Long-Island,</HI> and broke open Mr. <HI>Allberson's</HI> house, and robbed him of twenty-four dollars. (It may not be amiss to notice here, that I had robbed this man once before.) The next night we went into the house of one Mr. Parsons, and demanded his
<PB N="15" REF="018324_0013_0FA5CE098F6884E0"/>
money; but there being fifteen or six∣teen folks in the house, we could not collect them all together. The man of the house went on the roof and sound∣ed an alarm. We went into the cham∣ber and found an iron chest, but could not break it open, nor get it cut of the room: The neighbours raised a party who fired upon us; but we made our escape.</P>
<P>AFTER this we went to <HI>Long-Island</HI> and were discovered; therefore we hid our∣selves several days. Then we went with an intent to rob one <HI>Henry Post,</HI> but were discovered, and ran into the woods. We went to a house that right and demanded a supper; they gave us one.</P>
<P>SOON after this we set out for <HI>New-York,</HI> but were taken and carried before a <HI>British</HI> Colonel and examined; they asked my name, and told me they wan∣ted to catch <HI>Barrick:</HI> (They did not know I was the man.) I told them my name was <HI>Richard Willis.</HI> The Colonel ordered a party to escort me out of the lines; but unluckily for me we met with
<PB N="16" REF="018324_0014_0FA5CE09B4F39E48"/>
a party of about twenty. They asked our party if they had got <HI>Barrick?</HI> The answer was, They, had not: but one of their party knew me and called me by my right name, and says, <HI>Now we have you we will keep you.</HI> Then they bound me and kept me in that situati∣on almost five weeks.</P>
<P>THE people I had robbed came to see me, to know whether, they could swear to me out of the whole gang. There were but two of the spectators could swear to me, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Allberson</HI> and <HI>Robbins.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The WAGES of SIN is DEATH. THE LIFE and DYING CONFESSION OF JOHN SULLIVAN, HIGH-WAY ROBBER.</HEAD>
<P>I <HI>JOHN SULLIVAN,</HI> was born in <HI>Ireland</HI> in the town of <HI>Limrick,</HI> and was eighteen years old last A∣pril. I shall minute down my crimes in the order I committed them.</P>
<P>CRIME I. I inlisted as a soldier in the
<PB N="20" REF="018324_0018_0FA5CE0D6A7B32C8"/>
<HI>British</HI> service in the year 1777, and took five pounds bounty; the Captain's name was <HI>Thomas,</HI> of the thirty-sixth regiment. Went to <HI>Bristol,</HI> in order to join the army, but deserted.</P>
<P>CRIME 2. Went to <HI>Wales</HI> with an in∣tent to inlist the second time, but alter'd my mind and enter'd on board the <HI>Saris</HI> fri∣gate, in the King's service, bound to <HI>New-York:</HI> I staid on board <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ar three weeks, and then deserted. I went to <HI>Long-Island,</HI> and there was press'd on board a vessel, staid on board eleven weeks and then de∣serted.</P>
<P>CRIME 3. I enter'd on board a sloop bound to <HI>New-York,</HI> but hawl'sd in at <HI>Lovd's-Neck:</HI> When I landed I was discover'd and pursued by the Doctor of my former vessel; he was on horse∣back, and drove me into the water, but was obliged to come on shore and surrender; I then received thirty-nine lashes.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="018324_0019_0FA5CE0E24E7EFE0"/>
CRIME 4. The same night I deserted and swam to another vessel commanded by one <HI>Kelley:</HI> The master and I combined together, and stole the vessel, carried her into <HI>Stonington</HI> and sold her: I receiv∣ed about three hundred dollars for my share.</P>
<P>CRIME 5. From <HI>Stonington</HI> I went to <HI>New-London,</HI> and entered on board a pri∣vateer <HI>John Buckley</HI> commander: tarried on board three months; took some pri∣zes. I then entered on board another privateer, commanded by <HI>James Woodworth;</HI> after a months cruise was taken by the <HI>British</HI> and carried into <HI>New-York,</HI> and put on board the guardship, where remain∣ed three days, and then was put on board the Lesophe, where I remained 11 weeks: I came to <HI>Staten-Island</HI> where I deserted. I went from thence to <HI>Marrineck</HI> where I was hailed by a small party, and ordered to stand: I had a firelock with me and fired on them, but they took me pri∣soner, and carried me to <HI>Horse-Neck,</HI> where Col. <HI>Camfield</HI> commanded; the Colonel exa∣mined me and gave me a pass to go to
<PB N="22" REF="018324_0020_0FA5CE0EE391F118"/>
<HI>Stanford,</HI> where I became acquainted with <HI>Barrick,</HI> who is condemned to die with me.</P>
<P>CRIME 6. In August one thousand seven hundred and eighty two, I hap∣pened in company with a young lad; he and I laid down to take rest. After he got to sleep I searched his pockets and stole one guinea and one crown. After this I entered on board a whale-boat with the person I stole the money from, we went a cruise and came into <HI>Stoning∣ton,</HI> where I was accused of stealing the guinea and crown, but denied it: They searched me and found the money tied up in the tail of my shirt; they cut off my shirt-tail and left me. I went to Col. <HI>Davenport</HI> and he gave me a pass to go to <HI>New-London:</HI> I there entered on board a privateer commanded by <HI>Isaac Wherar.</HI> We went about eight days cruise, and by distress of weather got dismasted: Our vessel being a wreck and unable to defend ourselves, we were taken by a <HI>British</HI> vessel and carried to <HI>Bermudas.</HI> I then engaged with the
<PB N="23" REF="018324_0021_0FA5CE0FDCB3B3B8"/>
Captain who took me prisoner to go to sea with him. I took twenty dollars bounty. I never went on board after I received the money and cloaths; but rode off on my ten toes and left them.</P>
<P>CRIME 7. I went about seven miles to a place called <HI>Cole-Lane,</HI> and engaged to go on board a privateer, took twenty-four dollars from the Captain and then bid them good night. I next went to St. <HI>Georges;</HI> there I enter'd on board ano∣ther privateer, Capt. <HI>Hall</HI> commander, and took twenty-four dollars bounty: We went five weeks cruise and returned to <HI>Bermudas.</HI> Being destitute of all things, I endeavoured to help myself to that which <HI>Solomon</HI> says <HI>will answer all things;</HI> and knowing that one <HI>Gutheridge</HI> kept a store there, I took a partner with me and broke open his store, where we found a barrel of dollars; we took our pockets and hats full, then went to a place called <HI>Salt-Kittles</HI> and changed the silver for gold.</P>
<P>CRIME 8. Three weeks after this. I entered on board Capt. <HI>Vezey,</HI> bound to
<PB N="24" REF="018324_0022_0FA5CE105CC27128"/>
<HI>St. Thomas's:</HI> Peace being proclaimed I went to <HI>North Carolina.</HI> I went from thence to <HI>Portsmouth,</HI> where I went to work three weeks: Then I and my part∣ner broke open a store in the day-time and took out twenty-four half-joes an some silver; my comrade was taken up on suspicion and carried before a Jus∣tice, but made his escape; and as was not suspected, was sent to catch him. I followed on until I overtook him, and he and I contrived the matter between us, so that he gave me his shoes and buck∣les to carry, and tell the injured people, that I pursued him so close that he was obliged to drop his shoes and buckles and for this piece of villainy they reward∣ed (what they falsely called) my fidelity with two dollars.</P>
<P>CRIME 9. I then went to <HI>Baltimore</HI> and entered on board a pilot-boat and went to <HI>Philadelphia:</HI> Then went from thence to <HI>New-York.</HI> I then entered myself on board a transport bound to <HI>Scotland</HI> I suspected there was money on board, nor was my suspicion groundless,
<PB N="25" REF="018324_0023_0FA5CE13686E5B68"/>
for I and one more found a chest, and breaking it open took out forty pounds: Then made our escape to <HI>New-York.</HI></P>
<P>CRIME 9. Soon after this I got a new comrade, and we broke open a shop and took out the value of a hundred pounds in money and watches. I then went to <HI>Newbury-Port,</HI> where I entered on board Capt. <HI>Wheelwright</HI> bound for the <HI>West-Indies:</HI> When I arrived there I went into a trader's shop and took to the value of forty pounds, in goods. Soon after this I took another comrade and walking out we met a man in the road: We told him we wanted some money, and some we would have; the man gave us three crowns. After this I re∣turned to <HI>Boston.</HI></P>
<P>CRIME 10. On Friday night before Commencement, <HI>Barrick</HI> and I went to <HI>Roxbury</HI> with an intent to rob any person, but we were disappointed. The next Monday night we went upon the old er∣rand but no booty. Soon after this we
<PB N="26" REF="018324_0024_0FA5CE14E2768A50"/>
went to <HI>Winter-Hill,</HI> and there we fell in with one Mr. <HI>Baldwin. Barrack,</HI> and I stopt said <HI>Baldwin,</HI> and rob'd him of his watch and money. I took the watch out of <HI>Baldwin's</HI> pocket, but <HI>Poor</HI> was the man that abused and gave him heavy blows. For this last crime I am to suffer death.—These are the most capital crimes I have committed, and I sincerely wish that others may avoid the rock I have split upon.</P>

<HEAD>Thy BROTHER'S BLOOD crieth unto ME from the Ground. THE CONFESSION OF ALEXANDER WHITE, PIRATE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is to give satisfaction to all enquiring Friends, that I <HI>ALEXANDER WHITE,</HI> was born in <HI>Ireland,</HI> in the County of <HI>Tyrone,</HI> in the year of our Lord one thousand se∣ven hundred and sixty-two, and was brought up in said place, and got what education my Parents thought necessary. After I grew up, my mind being inclined to see strange countries against my Pa∣rent's
<PB N="28" REF="018324_0026_0FA5CE175D58B5E8"/>
will. I took my departure from <HI>Ireland,</HI> and went to <HI>England</HI> and bound myself apprentice to learn the Mariner's art, and served my Master faithfully un∣til it pleased him to give up my inden∣tures.</P>
<P>I STILL followed the occupation of a Mariner, and improved my education 'till I thought myself fit to take the command of a vessel. I have been through many scenes of life, and always endeavoured to support the character of an honest man, and I believe I was harmless to any body but myself. It is needless for me to give an account how I spent my life; for I have been in many parts of the world, but never did any thing that would cause me to blush or be ashamed before I transact∣ed this heinous crime that I am to suf∣fer for.</P>
<P>If you are desirous to know what this temptation did arise from; with shame I will endeavour to inform you: At first when I met with Capt. <HI>White</HI> it was in <HI>Philadelphia.</HI> My money being
<PB N="29" REF="018324_0027_0FA5CE18D6403A60"/>
almost spent I agreed to go to <HI>Nova-Sco∣tia</HI> with him. Accordingly we pursued our intended voyage as far as <HI>New-York,</HI> and there we took on board our cargo, and came to a place called <HI>Cow-Harbour,</HI> in <HI>Long-Island,</HI> and there tarried some days and took on board the passenger <HI>John Vail,</HI> and sailed quickly from thence.</P>
<P>MY mind being very uneasy on account of a young lady who I proposed to marry, and only the want of money prevented our being married. Being below her degree, and being ashamed to own my neces∣sity, prolonged our being joined in wed∣lock. But Love began to burn my poor and wounded heart; and being resolved to go through any difficulty that might im∣pede us, I intended to take the life of my fellow-creature; one evening seeing a good opportunity, I took up an ax, and with it struck Capt. <HI>White</HI> over board, and attempted to murder the passenger also; but when I found I could not ac∣complish my purpose, surrendered myself a prisoner.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="018324_0028_0FA5CE198CAF8348"/>
I WAS confined for some time. Towards morning we fell in with a vessel, who car∣ried me into <HI>Plymouth</HI> as a prisoner, and remained there for a considerable time, which I spent in anguish, imploring mer∣cy from GOD, for the crime I had commit∣ted. Then I was sent to <HI>Cambridge,</HI> and condemned to die by my own confession: And, agreeable to my inclination, (chu∣sing rather to die than to live.) Time would fail me to give a particular account of this affair; but this is the truth that I have set forth, which I declare as a dying cri∣minal.</P>
