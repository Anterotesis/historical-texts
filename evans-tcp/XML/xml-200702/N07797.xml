<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT TO THE CANDID READER.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS at the earnest desire of the church people in <HI>Great-Barrington,</HI> and not from any inclination of appearing in print, I send the following plain and inelegant discourse abroad; and as there are some expressions in it, may appear harsh, and the facts they relate to, improbable in a land of li∣berty, and where the oppressors can justly claim but toleration, I think it expedient to advertise the reader of those facts, and then leave him to judge of the expressions.</P>
<P>Some of the first settlers of the town of <HI>Great-Bar∣rington</HI> were <HI>Dutch</HI> people, who professed themselves <HI>Lutherans,</HI> and engaged and paid a <HI>Lutheran</HI> minis∣ter for coming among them four times every year. When the <HI>English</HI> came among them, they joined in settling two dissenting ministers, and contributed largely to build the meeting-houses in <HI>Great-Bar∣rington</HI> and <HI>Sheffield;</HI> but could receive no benefit from either, as they did not believe the principles of <HI>Calvinism,</HI> constantly taught in both, and could not
<PB N="iv" REF="009948_0003_0F7B3AA78581D9E0"/>
have their children baptized unless they would openly profess it.—Being desirous, their children should re∣ceive the sacred ordinance of baptism, they were obliged to go thirty or forty miles to a <HI>Lutheran</HI> mi∣nister, for that purpose. Seeing they received no advantage from the dissenting minister, and hired one of their own, they applied to the town to con∣sider their circumstances, and to allow them a part of the taxes they paid Mr. <HI>Hopkins,</HI> to help pay their own minister for visiting them; but this reason∣able desire was rejected with disdain, and invectives: However they made no disturbance, but attended Mr. <HI>Hopkins</HI>'s meeting, until he compelled them to leave it, by preaching the misterious notions of ab∣solute and irrespective decrees, and the augmenta∣tion of good and happiness to the moral system, by the introduction and abounding of sin, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Upon this they became uneasy, and told him they could not, in conscience, come to hear, and have their chil∣dren learn such doctrines for the gospel. Some of the <HI>English</HI> laboured under the same uneasiness, and could not admit the doctrines he constantly taught, to be true, and according to the revealed will of GOD: Nevertheless if he believed them, he might preach them, but he ought not to compel others to hear and learn them; which however was in some measure the fact; for when some who were dissatis∣fied, absented for a few days from his meeting, he instigated, from his desk, his people to prosecute them with the utmost rigour of the law: The conse∣quence was, several aged and sober men were put into the stocks, and two into the public goal;—their crimes were very atrocious, they could not, in con∣science, come to hear preached what they could not believe;—but they were <HI>Lutherans.</HI>—One <HI>Englishman,</HI>

Mr. <HI>Hamlin,</HI> was more criminal, yet, he was old, sick and lame, so that he could not go abroad; but then he was a churchman. Call you this liberty of conscience?—'Tis the same that was granted to churchmen, when <HI>presbyterianism,</HI> in days of that arch-hypocrite <HI>Oliver Cromwell,</HI> had rule. 'Tis liberty upon the same footing that the <HI>papist</HI> court of inquisition grants to <HI>protestants,</HI> of punishing the body for the good of the soul; the same as our pro∣genitors, those famous patrons of religious liberty, allowed the <HI>Quakers,</HI> of fines, stripes, imprisonments, and death; and yet this is boasted of as a merrito∣rious deed, whilst they proclaim their indulgence, and lenity to all, by words. But to proceed; in process of time, the <HI>Lutherans,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Called <HI>Lutherans,</HI> because they embrace the principles of Dr. <HI>Martin Luther,</HI> a <HI>German</HI> divine, who about the year 1517, op∣posed the errors of the <HI>Roman</HI> church; upon which many of the nobility, clergy and common people joined with him, effected the reformation of several whole electorates and king∣doms.—His opinions are now held by most <HI>Protestant</HI> churches, a few only excepted, of the <HI>Calvinists.</HI> <BIBL>BAYLEY.</BIBL></P></NOTE> together with some of the <HI>English</HI> there, became acquainted with the doc∣trines and worship of the church, and in <HI>September</HI> 1762, they invited me to visit them; I did, and preached there, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> when some of the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>English</HI> declared their conformity to the church, put themselves under my pastoral care, and I have visited them as often as was consistent with my other en∣gagements, and have prevailed with sundry other missionaries to do the same; and when no minister was there, they constantly assembled upon the Sun∣day, and performed divine service, according to our book of common prayer, and read good printed sermons. From this time, that they were regularly embodied in the public and avowed profession of the
<PB N="vi" REF="009948_0005_0F7B3AA970CB8BF0"/>
church of <HI>England,</HI> 'twas reasonably presumed, they would no longer be compelled to attend at the dissent∣ing meeting, to hear what they did not believe; nor be obliged to pay taxes to support the dissenting teachers, the which they had hitherto done;—but what signifies <HI>reason, justice,</HI> and <HI>conscience,</HI> when in com∣petition with <HI>passion, will,</HI> and <HI>interest!</HI> The truth was loud; and clamorous threatenings were thundered out, that if they would not come to meeting, they should suffer fines and imprisonment; but when <HI>that</HI> had no effect, upon better advice, the execution was suspended, and changed into railing, calumniating, and anathemas, and a more rigorous collecting of their rates to pay Mr. <HI>Hopkins,</HI> whom they did not hear; to support the propagation of what they be∣lieved erroneous. The church people began, and be∣fore the rates for another year were due, as I think, they raised a large and elegant church, and hired a young candidate for the ministry, as a reader, and steadily attended the worship of the church. Seeing they had expended so much money, for the church, and in every respect were known professors thereof, 'twas presumed they would now forego obliging them to pay to Mr. <HI>Hopkins;</HI> but like those which the wise man tells us are never satisfied, they more strenuously insisted upon the rates, and because the money could not be raised exactly when called for, some had their goods distressed and sold, at under rates; and ten of the more aged and sober men, were sent to the public goal, until the rates were paid. Time would fail me to relate the particular aggrevations which attended these oppressions; these are easily conceived, when the characters of the op∣pressors are known. Notwithstanding all these oppres∣sions, and the violent opposition made, the church
<PB N="vii" REF="009948_0006_0F7B3AAAA77107D8"/>
people have unanimously proceeded, and have ex∣pended large sums of money,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In a piece wrote at <HI>Great-Barrington,</HI> and published in the <HI>Boston Gazette, September</HI> 17, 1764, it is asserted, that <Q>the per∣sons who are at the chief expence in this undertaking (that is in building the church) declared for the church of <HI>England</HI> to <HI>escape rates,</HI> and <HI>save</HI> money.</Q> 'Tis evident the author ran foul of truth with his eyes open, it being said by the dissenters that the churchmen will ruin their estates in building their church. 'Tis certain they have expended tenfold larger sums▪ than if they had continued nonconformists, and this voluntary. As to es∣caping rates, if Mr. <HI>H—s</HI> was the author of that piece, he must know, by a notable instance of craft, that he was mistaken, which instance was, that when the taxes were gathering of the church people, for Mr. <HI>H—s,</HI> he went privately to some of the <HI>Dutch</HI> families, and offered to free them from paying him rates, if they would break off and not join with the church of <HI>England,</HI> the which proposal they rejected, and have been forward, upon all occasions, to pay towards the church. What credit, are honest people then to give to such nameless stuff, and yet I know some, whether honest, or not, who love to hear and propagate such malicious tales!</NOTE> in so far compleating their church, that they can conveniently attend the public worship there. Now whoever will candidly and impartially consider these facts, and as being done in land of professed freedom, and by a people who can justly claim for themselves but toleration, will not think any expressions in the ensuing discourse, sarcastical or severe.</P>
<P>Hoping the reader will not be hypercritical upon a juvenile performance, I wish him health and hap∣piness, remaining his servant in CHRIST,</P>

<HEAD>The WORSHIP and PRINCIPLES of the CHURCH.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>ST. MATTHEW, chap. 21, part of the 13th verse.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>It is written, my</HI> HOUSE <HI>shall be called the</HI> HOUSE <HI>of</HI> PRAYER.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IF it is a maxim of unchangeable truth, that dependant creatures ought to pray, and offer their praises to the eternal, perfect, and gracious parent of the universe, who created, preserves, and continually can bless them; it is as certain, there ought and must be <HI>time</HI> and <HI>place,</HI> proper for that purpose. Such obvious truths, laying level with the lowest rational capacity, are and need not be directly commanded or revealed; for when the truths, from which they flow, are made clear and evident, the weakest rational can form the conclusion: 'Tis true divine wisdom hath given us sufficient information, in the new testament, that some portion of time should be observed, and devoted for the purpose of religion; and also, that some places should be set apart for the same; although neither are particularly and expressly commanded, and why need it?—Seeing the hints and information
<PB N="2" REF="009948_0008_0F7B3AAD4F3EB5C0"/>
<HI>there,</HI> with the reason and experience of mankind, sufficiently shew the necessity of both: For the rea∣sons which prove the use of the one, holds good for the other; for if some part of time should be set apart for the purposes of religion, the same holds true as to place: The arguments which shew some particular time to be holy, or rather to have a relative holiness, shew the same concerning the other; if the first day of the week is, in holy writ, called the LORD'S day, a place or house set apart for the worship of GOD, is there called the LORD'S house; if no unnecessary bu∣siness should be performed on the LORD'S day, so none should be in his house; if the former is de∣voted to the service of GOD, and the promotion of religion, so ought equally the latter; if we are more peculiarly obliged to serve GOD, and learn our duty upon the LORD'S day, we are more peculiarly bound to serve him, and to learn in his house; the reasons for these particulars are so exceeding obvious, I shall omit them: And as we are now convened for the public worship of GOD, the first time, in this house, which you have erected, and is now opened, and from hence peculiarly to be used, for the glory and the worship of JEHOVAH, and the instruction and benefit of mankind, my business shall be briefly to point out to you those particulars which those who attend at this house are obliged and ought to per∣form, together with the happy consequences. The text, (as used by our SAVIOUR to the <HI>Jews,</HI> who had profaned the temple) characterizes such an house, by the most eminent part of the service performed therein, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> prayer—And JESUS went into the tem∣ple of GOD, and cast out all them that bought and sold in the temple;—and he said unto them it is written (in <HI>Isaiah Ivi. 7.</HI>) my house shall be called the
<PB N="3" REF="009948_0009_0F7B3AAE108F49D0"/>
<HI>house</HI> of prayer; <HI>i. e.</HI> an house dedicated to the worship of GOD, of which prayer is the most eminent part. Seeing prayer is put for, and is the most eminent part of the worship of GOD in his house, it therefore includes all the lesser or subordinate, parts of the service to be performed there; so that our duty re∣quired in this house of GOD, is comprehended in and expressed by this general term of prayer;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Let it be observed then, that preaching being subordinate to praying, people in most congregations are very blameable in neglecting that part of the worship of GOD, which is of the greatest importance, by either coming very late, or else only hearing the minister pray.</NOTE> the se∣veral branches whereof are accurately described by St. <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Timothy,</HI> 1 Epistle ii. 1.—<Q>I exhort there∣fore, that first of all, <HI>supplications, prayers, interces∣sions,</HI> and <HI>giving</HI> of <HI>thanks,</HI> be made for all men;</Q> which imports both the privilege of such unworthy and inferior beings as we are, to address that dread <HI>being,</HI> the majesty of heaven and earth, and our obligation to perform the same, together with the method how;—for to <HI>supplicate,</HI> imports our privilege and duty of petitioning GOD, through the merits of CHRIST, to pardon our sins, to turn away and re∣move our evils, temporal and spiritual, for and from ourselves and others.</P>
<P>By <HI>prayers</HI> there, we may understand our asking for blessings, for grace, and good things from GOD.</P>
<P>By <HI>intercessions,</HI> our pleading and interceding, more especially in behalf of our fellow-christians, and men every where.</P>
<P>By giving of thanks, is intended the privilege and obligation of returning, and offering our praises and acknowledgments, for the blessings and unmerited favors, we, and others, are, and may be, partakers of; all which is a privilege so great, and a duty so
<PB N="4" REF="009948_0010_0F7B3AAE53562A30"/>
incumbent, and of which the royal psalmist had so high and adequate conception, that principally, and above all others, this was his desire, and actual pur∣suit: <HI>Psal.</HI> xxvii. 4.—<Q>One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the <HI>house</HI> of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to <HI>enquire</HI> in his <HI>temple.</HI></Q> And indeed this is so eminent a privi∣lege, so much conducive to the honor of GOD, to be∣get and cherish in our minds worthy apprehensions of him, and just thoughts of ourselves, tending so much to our present comfort, and future happiness, and by GOD'S appointment, the requisite condition to obtain his blessing upon our endeavours, the par∣don of our sins, and that eternal life which is pur∣chased by CHRIST, that we ought to esteem it, as <HI>David</HI> did, the earnest desire of our souls, and make it our constant employ, and improve every favorable opportunity of publicly worshipping that glorious and gracious GOD, who alone can here bless and reward us.—That this distinguishable part of the service of GOD might be performed in a proper and acceptable manner, we have a most excellent, ra∣tional, pious and comprehensive liturgy, compiled by good and wise men, which approves itself worthy to be used by all sorts and conditions of men; cal∣culated to raise, and increase, a spirit of true devo∣tion, and to fix the soul upon its holy employment; to engage the attention, and animate the whole man; by which the true penitent may confess his sins, bewail his infirmities, and importune for par∣don; the indigent may sue for grace, protection, and relief; the grateful shout forth his acknow∣ledgments; in a word, whatever concerns a sinner, or saint, in the great work of public prayer, here is
<PB N="5" REF="009948_0011_0F7B3AAF04984500"/>
prescribed, both as to <HI>matter</HI> and <HI>method,</HI>—that which is <HI>right, proper, pious</HI> and <HI>engaging.</HI></P>
<P>The matter is collected from the holy scriptures, or in every instance agreeable thereunto; no vain dis∣putations; no frivolous controversies, which specula∣tive or enthusiastic heads have been and daily are forming, to the decay and discredit of true religion and devotion; no new-fangled notions, or bold and un∣common, trifling and indecent expressions; which serve, <HI>where</HI> used, to perplex and bewilder the under∣standing, to tickle and please the fancy, or to turn the soul from the important and solemn work it should be about. I confess ours is a form,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I hope no christian will be offended at that, when he con∣siders, that if he ever prays in the congregation, he must pray by a form, although his priest may pray extemporary; that he was baptised by a form, received the Lords supper by a form, re∣turns thanks by a form, is blessed by a form, and that our SA∣VIOUR to his disciples, GOD to the <HI>Jews,</HI> and <HI>John</HI> to his dis∣ciples, prescribed a form.</NOTE> but 'tis a form of such sound words, that all serious christians may use, and which none can condemn, unless clouded by ignorance, distracted by enthusiasim, or feared by irreligion and impiety.—For <HI>all</HI> is addressed to the one only, true, faithful, wise, good, just, merciful, almighty and eternal GOD, through the merits and mediation of one only saviour our Lord JESUS CHRIST, whatsoever as a community is need∣ful, both for body and soul, for time and eternity; for our friends and benefactors, and even for our enemies and persecutors; and lastly, for all mankind in their several stations, relations and conditions: Every vice or lust which reigns in us, and we would willingly forsake and subdue; every sin and folly we desire to have forgiven; every grace and virtue that we need and would have given; every favour and blessing we would return thanks for, we here may
<PB N="6" REF="009948_0012_0F7B3AAFC3DF8420"/>
find and use the matter; which is <HI>plain, proper,</HI> and <HI>engaging,</HI> and which, I doubt not, will appear so to every one, who will impartially read, and under∣stand, the book of common prayer.</P>
<P>As to manner or method, it begins with some selected texts of scripture read by the minister, toge∣ther with a solemn exhortation to all present; which puts them in mind of what those texts declare, and also of all the succeeding parts of duty which they meet to perform; calling upon them, with one heart and voice, to the first part of prayer, which imme∣diately ensues; by which means all have <HI>time,</HI> and <HI>means,</HI> to compose their minds, and to consider <HI>where</HI> and <HI>what</HI> we are, and the business we are going about, which is to kneel down, and unitedly to con∣fess our sins, and to pray for the pardon of them. The minister then, as the ambassador of GOD, through CHRIST, declares the blessings of the gospel, of pardon and remission, to all true believers and penitents: To which is added the LORD'S prayer, by all present, with petitions, that GOD would open our lips, and prepare our hearts to declare his praise; the which we do standing,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was a gesture ever used of old by good men, in reading hymns of praise, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Psal.</HI> xviii. 4.—2 <HI>Chron.</HI> xxiii. 30. <HI>Nehemiah</HI> ix. 5.</NOTE> by repeating a large portion of the psalms, whereby as they help to ex∣press our gratitude, so they engage our attention, and instruct our minds into the knowledge of GOD'S will; after which a chapter out of the old testament is read by the minister standing, and the people sitting, to which is added, a hymn to praise GOD for teaching us his will: We then hear another chapter out of the new, which sets forth unto us something relative to the great work of our redemption by JESUS CHRIST;
<PB N="7" REF="009948_0013_0F7B3AB188DF02E8"/>
after that immediately ensues a psalm of thankfulness; to evidence the truth of these things we have heard, we are then to repeat, with one <HI>heart</HI> and <HI>voice,</HI> the summary of the christian religion called the apostles <HI>creed;</HI> we are then directed to pray to, and interceed with our all-gracious GOD and heavenly father, for his <HI>grace,</HI> for <HI>peace,</HI> for <HI>protection,</HI> for ourselves, for our king, and his family, for our church, and its rulers, for all sorts and conditions of men, and as oc∣casion requires, for all other things needful for our∣selves and others; and lastly, to return our unfeigned thanks for our creation, preservation, and redemp∣tion by our Lord JESUS CHRIST, and for all GOD'S favors to us and all men. One thing is observable through the whole; every prayer, and almost every general petition, begins with some one of the divine attributes, and concludes, through the merits of CHRIST. Your patience will not permit my more critical or lengthier observations,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Those who would see the beauty and excellency of the com∣mon prayer book, may consult Mr. <HI>Wheatly,</HI> Bishop <HI>Beveridge,</HI> Dr. <HI>Faulkner,</HI> and others.</NOTE> but shall conclude this part of my discourse in the words of that pious and great divine bishop <HI>Tillotson:</HI>—"I have been (says he) according to my opportunities, not a negli∣gent observer of the genius and humour of the se∣veral sects and professions of religion: And upon the whole matter I do in my conscience believe the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> to be the best constituted <HI>church</HI> this day in the world; and that, as to the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>in, the <HI>doctrine</HI> and government, and <HI>worship</HI> of it, are ex∣cellently framed to make men soberly religious: Se∣curing men on the one hand, from the wild freaks of enthusiasm; and on the other, from the gross follies of superstition."<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sermon</HI> on 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> iii. 15.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="009948_0014_0F7B3AB21012DA58"/>
The great design of erecting this house, is to meet and join in the use of public prayer; but as the knowledge of religion is requisite, in order for mens becoming religious, and St. <HI>Paul</HI> shews we come not to this knowledge without teaching, (<HI>Rom.</HI> x. 14) and as all men have not time nor capacity to instruct themselves, therefore, a further design, is, that the true principles and duties of our holy religion might be here taught and learned, the sum of which religion is contained in these two terms, <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>repentance.</HI>—Under the head of faith will be taught, the <HI>existence</HI> and <HI>attributes</HI> of one eternal, good, wise, great and self-existing GOD, who created, preserveth, and governs the universe, and all creatures; that he is to be adored, loved, and obeyed; that when man had sinned, and had exposed himself to justice and punishment, incapable of relieving himself, that GOD so loved the world, that he sent his only begotten son, that whosoever believeth in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life; (<HI>John</HI> iii. 16)—that he assumed human nature, taught, both by precept and example, mankind, all holy living; died a sacra∣fice for the sins of the world, and thereby to make peace for us: <Q>And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself, by him I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven;</Q> (<HI>Col.</HI> i. 20) and sealed and ratified a covenant of grace, whereby sinners may obtain <HI>pardon, grace,</HI> and everlasting salvation. These particulars will be taught as matters of faith; as necessary for every one firmly to believe, together with many other consequential principles: Abstruse and needless speculations, that tend only to confuse the ignorant, distract the weak, and advantage none, will be omitted and discarded,
<PB N="9" REF="009948_0015_0F7B3AB2C1E8E058"/>
as being contrary to the genius of christianity, and the design and business of its ministers. Under the head of repentance, will, we reasonably expect, be taught, what the grace of GOD, which hath appeared bringing salvation, (<HI>i. e.</HI>) the offers and terms of salvation to all men, teacheth, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that denying un∣godliness, and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world; (<HI>Tit.</HI> ii. 12) <HI>i. e.</HI> to quit and turn from all vice and immorality; all profaneness and debauchery; all injustice, malice, su∣perstition, and idolatry; to pray to GOD, for his pardon, and for his grace▪ to do so no more; but heartily and faithfully to do what he has required; to love, fear, and serve GOD, with all our souls, and power; to cordially embrace, and stedfastly believe his revealed <HI>will;</HI> to govern our passions, and live in the regular exercise of our reason; to love, and do good to our fellow-men every where: Under each of these particulars are comprehended many other duties, which the preacher will not fail of inculcating, in plain, sober, and engaging words and manners. In a word, we are to expect the plain principles of the gospel, and not the whims and notions of men; the religion and duties which CHRIST our Saviour taught, which is to promote true holiness, and genuine god∣liness and honesty, and not misterious and useless speculations, impracticable and impossible duties; which make men either proud or desperate, where and when preached and believed.</P>
<P>Having thus briefly represented both the worship and principles of the church, I shall now as briefly mention the advantages that you may reasonably expect, in consequence of building this house, and having these particulars performed therein. All reasonable actions are done to gain some design and
<PB N="10" REF="009948_0016_0F7B3AB4E94BF1F8"/>
end; and it may justly be supposed, that you expected the advantages arising, would be sufficient to recom∣pence you for the cost and trouble you have and will be at; that you would not contentedly suffer so many inconveniencies, <HI>persecutions,</HI> and more than <HI>hostile barbarities,</HI> and take so much pains, and ex∣pend so much of your interest, if you had not the prospect of reaping some advantage. The motive is good; this has ever been presented by the wise and good parent of nature, to excite and animate man∣kind to be religious. The first advantage you may expect is the worshipping GOD almighty, agreeable to your faith, and according to his revealed will.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note, Mr. <HI>Calvin,</HI> and his scholars, make a wide difference in GOD'S revealed and secret will: by the one, all have the offers of life and salvation; by the other, only a few, and the rest are reprobated by the same will. Vid. <HI>Cal.</HI> inst. lib. 3. c. 24. <HI>Gill, Cole,</HI> and others.</NOTE> This is most certainly a very great benefit, unto all such as are, by the grace of GOD, willing and en∣gaged to join heartily therein. You come here not only to hear another pray, but to attend and join, both with heart and voice, to pray to and praise your GOD. In other assemblies, you can but hear another pray his own prayer, if that may be called his own which he knows not before he prays, and remembers not afterwards; whereas we ought to pray as well as sing praises with the spirit and with the understanding also, which may be performed here, but as things at present are, cannot be done in the other assemblies in this land.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI>—You always hear the revealed will of GOD read, a large portion being always appointed, so that you will always when you meet here, certainly hear your GOD speaking and teaching you what to
<PB N="11" REF="009948_0017_0F7B3AB5B174DF98"/>
believe and do for salvation. In other congrega∣tions, the scriptures are wholly laid aside for the preacher to produce something more pleasing and excellent; just as though a glow-worm would yield a more pleasing and advantageous light than the meridian sun.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI>—We commemorate the remarkable events of our saviour CHRIST, particularly his miraculous birth, as upon this ever joyful and memorable day, and for that purpose we always partake of that holy and valuable institution, by which we unworthy crea∣tures are allowed spiritually to eat the flesh and drink the blood of our saviour JESUS CHRIST, and thereby to be evidences of, and to shew forth his death to future ages: And you, my brethren, who design this day to come to his holy banquet, should duly remember yourselves, and so to have examined your hearts and repented of your sins, as preparedly to be partakers thereof, that so you may receive spiritual blessings from the sacred appointer and author.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly.</HI>—Another advantage to be expected, is, that the preacher will entertain and instruct your minds, not with unreasonable misteries, mere specula∣tive notions, or impracticable duties, which serve only to distract and bewilder mens understanding; but that from the existence and perfections of one GOD; from the wonderful love and work of one only Saviour; from the agency of one only spirit, he will proceed to explain and enforce the plain duties of a holy life; furnishing your minds with proper argu∣ments, and gospel motives, to become truly holy, in heart and conversation.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly.</HI>—Another advantage, and that not incon∣siderable, will be, that your minister will be invested with a proper commission, and with competent
<PB N="12" REF="009948_0018_0F7B3AB5D9F2D280"/>
authority from CHRIST, the head of the church, to execute the work of a minister among you.</P>
<P>This is an advantage which the <HI>dissenters</HI> in this land can justly lay no claim to, unless every layman has authority to ordain; which appears so glaringly absurd, that many curious distinctions are trumped upon the ignorant, and when these fail, 'tis denied what our Saviour expressly declared (when he com∣missioned his apostles) of <Q>lo I am with you always even unto the end of the world.</Q> Whoever can∣didly considers the fate of the presumptuous invaders of this office, under the old, and the appointment by CHRIST and his apostles, under the new testament, and that for fifteen hundred years after, none but such as were ordained in this line of succession, were allowed in the christian church, as the history of all ages of the church testify, will have reason to esteem it a privilege to be under a ministry which is justly unexceptionable in this particular.</P>
<P>And lastly, to mention but this one, which crowns all the other advantages, and for to attain this, the others are only designed as helps and means; in the proper use of them, through the goodness and mercy of GOD, by the merits and mediation of JESUS our common Lord and Saviour, you may obtain the pardon of your sins, the assistance and blessings of heaven, peace, unanimity, and contentment in this present world; and in the future, when this mortal shall put on immortality, when contention and male∣diction shall be confined to its proper abode, may come the possession of that everlasting salvation, that incorruptible crown of glory, that heavenly residence, of <HI>life, light,</HI> and <HI>joy,</HI> which is reserved in heaven for all true and obedient christians. This, my brethren, is a prize! worth all your striving; a reward, beyond
<PB N="13" REF="009948_0019_0F7B3AB684CFF2E8"/>
all your doings for the service of GOD, and promo∣tion of religion; an advantage, that will more, infi∣nitely more, than recompence you, for all the <HI>scoffs, ridicule, hatred, opposition,</HI> and <HI>oppression,</HI> cast at, and laid upon you by others; for all the fatigue, anx∣iety and cost, you have voluntarily undergone and expended; or let you be ever so liberal for the fu∣ture, in completing this edifice, or engaged in the services thereof, and of religion in general, this will abundantly recompence you for all: This great advantage, reward, and recompence, you must ever esteem as <HI>such;</HI> never to flatter or deceive yourselves, as to imagine, upon the one hand, you have earned, and therefore may demand it as wages due to you; nor, upon the other, that you ever shall possess it, notwithstanding what you have hitherto done, unless now, and for the future of your lives, you live agree∣able to the conditions thereof; the which is evident upon both sides, from <HI>Heb.</HI> v. 9, speaking of the suf∣ferings of CHRIST, <HI>verse</HI> 4, the apostle subjoins, and being made perfect, he became the <HI>author</HI> of eternal <HI>salvation,</HI> unto <HI>all</HI> them that <HI>obey him.</HI> Here see CHRIST, and not man, is the author and bestower of this salvation; yet you also see, although CHRIST is both author and giver, he will bestow it upon none but such as will <HI>obey</HI> him; so that we can have no just expectation of this, the greatest of all other advan∣tages, unless we faithfully and truly <HI>obey</HI> him. My time only permits me to mention that <HI>obedience</HI> which we must perform in this house, in order to reap the advantages proposed, which is briefly thus:</P>
<P><HI>First.</HI>—Be always careful to be here before the worship begins; and when you enter this house, re∣member you enter the house of GOD; therefore drop all ceremony to your fellow-men, all the care and
<PB N="14" REF="009948_0020_0F7B3AB76272D518"/>
concerns of your worldly business and employment; all improper thoughts and reflections, and have <HI>Ja∣cob</HI>'s reflection upon your minds,—"How dreadful is this place! This is none other but the house of GOD! This is the gate of heaven!" (<HI>Gen.</HI> xxviii. 17) let therefore a more solemn awe and reverence be paid here. "Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of GOD, and be more ready to hear than to give the sacrifice of fools:—Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter any thing before GOD," <HI>Eccles.</HI> v. 1, 2.</P>
<P><HI>Seccondly.</HI>—When the worship begins, join devoutly and engagedly therein; let your hearts be sincerely animated, your affections discreetly warmed, and your attention stedfastly fixed; for it is a most hei∣nous and aggravated provocation, <Q>to draw near GOD, with our mouths, and with our lips to ho∣nour him, but to have removed our hearts far from him.</Q> As we are compounded of soul and body, and as both are redeemed, we should serve and honour GOD with both; thus St. <HI>Paul</HI> infers, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> vi. 20, "for ye are bought with a price, <HI>therefore</HI> glorify GOD in your <HI>body,</HI> and in your spirit which are GOD'S."—Neither should be neglected, in the worship of GOD; but it is the service and worship of our souls, that most excellent part of us, that is prin∣cipally regarded; that of the body is insignificant and criminal, unless conducive to that of the soul.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI>—When you pray for the pardon of your sins, be resolved to forsake them; when for grace and GOD'S holy spirit, be determined and engaged to receive, embrace, and comply therewith. When you return thanks, let a sense of GOD'S favors and blessings be deeply imprinted in your souls, and with your voices; let your souls, and all that is
<PB N="15" REF="009948_0021_0F7B3AB810147098"/>
within, join in praying to and praising GOD'S holy name.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly.</HI>—When the word of GOD is read or ex∣pounded by the minister, be all silence and attention to hear and learn GOD'S holy will, and your duty, taking up a firm resolution to perform whatsoever you understand to be his will and your duty.—The gospel is, in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s language, <Q>the power of GOD unto salvation, unto every one that be∣lieveth;</Q> (<HI>Rom.</HI> i. 16)—and in St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s, <Q>the incorruptible seed by which we are born again,</Q> 1. <HI>Pet.</HI> i. 23.—From whence you are therefore to learn what is GOD'S will, what he has and will do for your good and salvation, and what you have to do to comply with, and come to the possession of the same.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly.</HI>—As the posture of our bodies, may, in the worship of GOD, be subservient to the ends and pur∣poses of spiritual services, some directions might be necessary, had not those wise and good men who compiled our service book, already to your hands laid down all those that are necessary and proper; a little attention thereto, and use thereof, will lead your minds to discern the propriety and expediency of them, in the worship of GOD in this house.</P>
<P>Lastly—We ought to conclude the public services of religion, by heartily joining in prayer for a bles∣sing from GOD upon what we have heard, and what we have performed; for although <HI>Paul</HI> may plant, and <HI>Apollos</HI> water, 'tis GOD that gives the increase.—And since the minister, who is the servant and em∣bassador of CHRIST, only has authority to pronounce the blessing of GOD, you should reverently wait, and with attention receive, joining with one heart and one voice, in that summary conclusion, AMEN, <HI>i. e.</HI> that it might be so, that GOD would bless you in∣deed.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="009948_0022_0F7B3AB8C2E5A360"/>
If you, my brethren, would conduct yourselves after this manner, in the service of GOD, and your redeemer JESUS CHRIST, in this house of CHRIST'S, which you have with much labour and expence erected for these purposes, you will not ever find either your cost or labour in building, nor your at∣tention, care, and diligence in performing these, and the other duties of our holy religion, unrewarded; but that it will be found, from the great goodness of our heavenly father and creator, through the merits and intercession of JESUS CHRIST our redeemer, infi∣nitely rewarded—Unto whom, with the holy spirit, let us now, and ever in this house, as it is in heaven ascribe all honor and praise. AMEN.</P>
