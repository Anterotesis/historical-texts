CYNTHIA. A NOVEL.</HEAD>
<DIV1 TYPE="part of story">
<P>FORTH from a desert and un∣frequented wood in the east parts of Albion, a∣butting to the sea, issued out a woman; and seat∣ed herself upon a carpet of sweet flowers, em∣broidered by the hand of nature; she resembled Diana, the beautiful huntress of the woods; or more fair, if possible: one would have taken her for a celestial deity, if the succeeding vicis∣situdes of fortune had not strongly persuaded she was a mortal beauty. Indeed the purity of her complexion seemed to excel the new fallen snow, but sorrow gathered the carnation off her cheeks. All the features of her face had so near a kindred, and formed to so rare a proportion, that she seemed nature's master∣piece; or rather sympathised something of that divinity which name she bore. From her eyes darted a lustre, mingled with a vivacity so pen∣etrating, that it was impossible for the most confident soul to make resistance. This pro∣digious creature, after, she had searched every vacant place with her eye, fearing to be over∣heard,
<PB N="4" REF="033593_0003_0FF7972D34C045C0"/>
with a troubled and low voice she began as followeth:</P>
<P>"O my dear, though absent, Orsamus! To whose merits I never yet gave any reward, whose complaints I could never be induced to pity! When Neptune shipwrecked thee upon the shore, I little thought thy presence would beget me such disquiet; O duty! O love! To what extremes do you hurry me? And what enemies are you to my rest? The birds that live in these unfrequented woods are happier than I; for they may chuse their mates, and carol their sweet pleasures to the spring; but by the cruel commands of a father I am forced to neglect the person I love; and disesteem the services of one with disdain, whose welfare I prize above my life; who once left, I would not bid a welcome to the dearest good the world can afford me. But alas! The time draws near that will make a perpetual divorce. Unfortunate Orsamus, by thy absence; miser∣able Cynthia, by thy folly."</P>
<P>Scarce had these words took a farewel from her mouth, when from an adjacent part of the wood issued out a man richly appareled, and bent his steps directly to the place where she sat. Her eyes had no sooner found him out, but with excess of grief she uttered these com∣plaints, "O cruel Heavens! Do you take a pleasure in tormenting submitting innocence,
<PB N="5" REF="033593_0004_0FF7972ECB7983E8"/>
that you conduct this monster, the enemy of my content, and fatal disturber of my quiet, so unfortunately to the place of my concealment; now farewel my poor Orsamus; I shall only stay here amongst the living to consecrate the relicts of a languishing life to thy dear mem∣ory."</P>
<P>By this time the unknown person came up; and seating himself by her side, he accosted her with this discourse: "Madam, said he, your father expects you with ardency, and is in fear∣ful apprehensions of the certainty of your safe∣ty. Why, madam, continued he, at such a time as this do you seek out solitude, and so carefully shun the person that adores you? Why these clouds my dear princess, on a joyful day; wherefore these tears too, too precious to be thus lavishly cast away; Why are my promising joys overcast with such fearful o∣mens, and my sweetest hopes vanished? Tell me, O tell me! joy of my bliss, what may oc∣casion your disquiet, that with the peril of my life I may procure a remedy."</P>
<P>This fair unknown was preparing, for a re∣ply, when they were disturbed with a noise from the neighbouring thickets; and casting their eyes about to understand the cause of that surprizal, when behold there rushed out a man, whose unexpected appearance was quickly be∣come their astonishment: his visage was pale
<PB N="6" REF="033593_0005_0FF79730655E19E0"/>
and clouded over with grief; in all regards and lineaments of his face appeared a natural fierceness; his whole composure shewed the ev∣idence of something so great and noble that spake him to command others, born to dises∣teem the whole world, and think it held none fit to be his rival.</P>
<P>He set his face and directed his hasty steps to the place where they sat; but his presence put them both in confusion. He no sooner presented himself to their sight, but fixing his eyes wholly on this fair unknown, as the load stone of his will, and centre of his happiness, with a rapture of joy he suddenly cast himself at her feet. "O my divine princess, said he, beautiful cause of my misfortunes, and cruel origin of all my miseries? How careful has fortune been to make me happy, when I have intended to sacrifice the fragment of this wretch∣ed life to your severity? I have yet this com∣fort left me in death, to complain to you of your injustice."</P>
<P>All this time a wavering colour often went and came in her cheeks, that she became stiff∣ned with astonishment, as if she had been planet struck; but at last calling back that assurance her sudden surprizal had sequestered, "Gods, said she, is this Orsamus himself I see before me? Yes, replied he; it is Orsamus, if you have not cast the memory of so poor a wretch
<PB N="7" REF="033593_0006_0FF79732DA803DA0"/>
into oblivion." This said, he dissembled him∣self from her knees, and with a look full of ter∣ror, he drew his sword to pierce his breast with that fatal weapon. But Cynthia no sooner saw that glittering minister of death unsheathed, but giving a grievious shriek, she fell into a deadly swoon; when suddenly casting his eyes about, he saw this first gallant sitting like one metamorphosed, or a statue without life; and suddenly calling him to remembrance, "Oh (cried he) have I found you, the only opposer of my bliss? Can you think to go safely away with that prize, which is only due to my ser∣vices; If you know how to own a good, main∣tain the interest you would challenge in this di∣vine creature with your sword." Saying this, he presented his sword against his breast, but he never moved from the place where he sat, neither did he endeavour to make any motion of defence.</P>
<P>In this interim of time, his friends who had been in quest of him in the most secret parts of the wood, hearing of a disturbance, came up unto him, and seeing Cordello in danger, at that moment they made in, and rescued him out of his hands, when no doubt he had acted the last catastrophe and scene of his life. They all assaulted him at once; but he, without spending a thought upon the number, rushed upon them like lightning, with a swiftness,
<PB N="8" REF="033593_0007_0FF7973643A7E1F0"/>
and looks so terrible and dreadful, that he made the forwardest repent their rashness. Six lay stain by his hands: and they had encom∣passed him about, so that it seemed impossible he could make any longer resistance against such numbers as surrounded him.</P>
<P>When lo! fortune provided a remedy for this disaster; yet one that seemed worse than the disease. Behold from an adjoining creek of the sea, shaded by a little hill, issued about sixteen pirates led on by their captain. They came not to assist either side, but to make their utmost advantage of both. No sooner had the assailants of this brave cavalier beheld them coming, but they all ran away; only he alone set him in a posture of defence to preserve the lady; but, overpowered by their numbers, they forced him to submit to their will; yet not before he had received four desperate wounds in the body; in revenge of which he had slain four of the best men belonging to their vessel. They conveyed Cynthia, with Orsamus, on board the boat, intending to sat∣isfy the death of their companions with the au∣thor who had occasioned it. They put off from shore, and began to prepare for his exe∣cution; mean while the fair Cynthia, whose spirits were newly returned to execute their proper functions, sat almost dissolved in tears, beholding these preparations for Orsamus's
<PB N="9" REF="033593_0008_0FF79737D4CE9190"/>
death, fearfully apprehending what she could not as yet know the cause of; going unto him that seemed commander of the rest, she de∣manded "to what use those weapons, and preparations of death were made?" He return∣ed answer, "for that cavalier who in her de∣fence had slain four of the best men belonging unto his ship." "Sir, replyed Cynthia, that young man is my brother; and ye cannot well blame him in what he did in the defence of a dear sister: and sure the course you would take is indirect, since if you fulfil your resolu∣tions, you can gain nothing by his death, but preserving his life, you may receive a great ran∣som.</P>
<P>The sweet thought of gain, delivered from such a lovely creature, set both his love and covetousness on the rack. In fine, the hope of gain turned the current of their revenge, in execution of which their choler abated, and they rested satisfied. But it was not so with their commander, for the eyes of his fair pris∣oner had opened themselves a passage, and darted their resplendant rays into the soul of this fierce pirate. He found such charms as it seemed impossible, and mere folly, to stand in opposition against them. Here was a meta∣morphose wrought by the force of love and beauty, a barbarian civilized to a milder tem∣per; for, accosting his fair prey, he composed
<PB N="10" REF="033593_0009_0FF797F9C4499C48"/>
all that was fierce and rude to respect and duty. "Madam, replied he, 'tis enough that you desire your brother should live; rest satis∣fied, he shall live only for your sake; not so much for our interest as for your content; for we could well have dispensed with our gain to give our revenge precedence: but your desires have put a period to our resentment; thus you reign triumphant while you esteem yourself a captive. O madam, continued he, cease those showers: clear up those bright stars, have you any desire? Give them a name; for I find it irresistable to give you a denial. Re∣tire to yonder cabin, which shall be wholly at your disposal. Your menial servants shall not be more officious, than these my men that seem so barbarous shall be dutiful at your com∣mands. For myself I'll pay my respects with as much chaste zeal as we pay our devotion to the offended deities, at such a time only when my visits will not incommode you: for I am not so much a pirate but I know what civilities ought to be paid to ladies of your quality; which, as you appear to me, is not mean.— Rest firm in the assurance of my promise, whilst I take care for the speedy dressing of your brother's wounds, and for his accomodation in the ship." Saying this, he left her in pro∣found respect.</P>
<P>Orsamus, who was an auditor and spectator
<PB N="11" REF="033593_0010_0FF797398F337AC0"/>
of the discourse that passed betwixt the pirate and Cynthia, was transported with ravishment when he understood that she was his preserv∣er. "Nay, said he, since my life is not indif∣ferent to my fair divinity, I'll live to free her from this captivity, or perish in the attempt; since she seems to have an esteem for my life, I'll endeavour to preserve it, for I cannot but prize what she esteems." These words were overheard by those that guarded him: but being spoken in English were not under∣stood. By their captain's command he was carefully conducted into the hold, where he had a lodging assigned him, and surgeons sent him that searched his wounds, which they found dangerous, but not mortal: they careful∣ly dressed them and left him unto his rest.</P>
<P>While things were thus stated, they would have tacked about again for the shore, to have received their expected ransom for Orsamus; but there arose a cruel tempest, which convey¦ed them many leagues from thence into the main ocean. The captain was not so sorry for disappointing his men of their hopes, because he had an opportunity to oblige Cynthia with the stayance of her supposed brother; as also to benefit himself in making him the solicitor of his love.</P>
<P>Three days had passed since the last disaster befel Cynthia; mean time Orsamus was care∣fully
<PB N="12" REF="033593_0011_0FF7973D27A43180"/>
dressed, and officiously attended, and Cynthia served with caution, the pirate never visiting her without permission. On the fourth day he invited her to take a walk on the deck. It was about the time Sol left watery Neptune's bed and newly darted his rays upon the face of the water.</P>
<P>Cynthia accorded with his desire; and kindly presenting him her hand, they went both forth the cabin. But oh! what a mine of beauties did the LIGHT present, which grief, and that dismal place had detained from his eyes; for the pain and fear she suffered for Orsamus, by the assurance of his safety, was partly vanished away, so that the beauty they had put to flight, was almost returned back again to its usual lustre, which this pirate took some time to contemplate and admire.— The encrease of her beauty augmented his passion; and sparks of love and pity that lay hid be∣fore, began to blaze into a flame, as by the sequel will appear; for after she had sweetly complained unto him of the detaining of her freedom, and, that according to his promise, he had not put her brother to his ransom, taking a hint from these words he began as followeth:</P>
<P>"Madam, said he, would I set your freedom to sale, a kingdom were too little to buy the ransom. If your brother's liberty has been de∣ferred,
<PB N="13" REF="033593_0012_0FF7973FA028D190"/>
perhaps your interest was the chief oc∣casion, when in some sort to oblige you, I have neglected so great a gain. For should I accord with you in this one thing, touching your freedom, possibly I should divorce my eyes from the dearest object forever. Mad∣am, I love you, because it is impossible to see you and be insensible. I have a passion for you that nothing can extinguish but death; but it is legitimate, and may be owned by you without a scruple, were your condition equal to the degrees of a princess. My birth is not ignoble, altho the disasters of my life have been uncommon; nor because I seem rustic, is my condition so mean, since the king of Norway, a few days since, profered me his neice to wife, which upon my return to Norway, I did intend to accomplish; and had certainly ef∣fected it, had not your prodigious beauty dis∣appointed my designs. And for your liberty, how can you account it a restraint when your goaler has become your slave? Abate but the thoughts of separation, and your desire cannot name another thing should meet my refusal. If once I be so happy to attain the shore of Norway, whither I intended in a few days to go, I will spend the residue of this wretched life at your feet." Here he contin∣ued silent, leaving Cynthia in amaze at the discovery of his passion; yet being obliged to reply, she returned the following answer.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="033593_0013_0FF79741316F22D8"/>Sir, your respective usage could not give me more satisfaction then your unpleasant dis∣course gives me discontent, since you take away the hopes of my liberty in denying my ransom. Never think by constraint to gain my affection, nor by detaining my liberty to make me become kind. Would I accord to your will, I am at my brother's disposal, whom you disa∣ble in denying him freedom, but never think by such rude ways, to force love; for your hopes will all fail you; for my soul is free, al∣though my body be your prisoner; and you shall find I can die when I cannot live. Say∣ing this, she left him and returned to her cab∣in.</P>
<P>Mean while the pirate stood like one trans∣formed: yet, not minding to despair of the first repulse, when he had the person in his power; so that recollecting his spirits, he went immediately to give Orsamus a visit, whose wounds by this time were fast recover∣ing.</P>
<P>After salutations past, he desired him to be his assistant to his sister, who protested never to dispose of herself without his consent: promising him in recompence to give him his freedom: or if he would go with him to Nor∣way he should have ample revenues to subsist during life. Orsamus thanked him, and said, if he would allow him the freedom to visit his
<PB N="15" REF="033593_0014_0FF79743932D5128"/>
sister, he would perform the utmost of his en∣deavours to procure her consent; that if his felicity depended upon his disposal, he would be no obstruction to defer it; that seeing he had put him to choice, he had rather go to Norway with his sister, than to return without her into his own country. Thus he was forc∣ed to delude him with hopes, so to detain him within the bounds of reason.</P>
<P>The pirate was satisfied at the freedom of his discourse, giving the physician orders, when his wounds would permit him, to let him have free access to his sister's chamber, and li∣berty of conversation, at such times as he best pleased.</P>
<P>This past he left him to his rest; but this transport was too great to let him mind that necessary minister of his health: that which Cynthia had done for him in preserving his life, by adopting him with that happy title of brother, and lastly, not to dispose of herself without his consent, was a fit subject to exer∣cise his thoughts upon. Now her former rig∣ours were all vanished to his memory, and he considered her only as his benefactor, and orig∣inal of his felicity.</P>
<P>He past away his time in such pleasing trans∣ports, ever fancing the idea of his fairest Cyn∣thia before his eyes, that all other thoughts were hushed in silence; his contentment seem∣ed
<PB N="16" REF="033593_0015_0FF79747CE378AA8"/>
perfect, and his wounds received an addi∣tional cure, from the temperature and quietness of his mind, so that in two days time he found himself in a capacity to visit his dearest physi∣cian; which being made known to the pirate, the more to oblige Cynthia, he intended to present him unto her himself.</P>
<P>'Twas about the time that Phoebus had clim∣ed into his mid-day height, and began to drive his chariot to the western seas, when Orsamus accompanied him to Cynthia's cabin. They found her sitting in the most dismal part of the room, very disconsolate, accompanied only with a mournful silence. At their first en∣trance, the pirate saluted her in this manner: Madam, since the disconcealing of my love has begotton your disquiet, I have courted all op∣portunities to dissipate your resentment, yet I fear you will not welcome the happness, be∣cause I bring it. This said with great respect, he departed out of the Cabin.</P>
<P>Scarce had he given an exit, shutting the door after him, but Orsamus in a transport cast himself at her feet so hastily, as she had neither time nor power to prevent him. But she, un∣willing to let him remain in that condition, presented him her hand, Rise Orsamus (said she) this prostrate action can scarce obtain its pardon; your presence at this time is not un∣welcome, since it has quietted me of some fears
<PB N="17" REF="033593_0016_0FF797495F8FF4C0"/>
that prepossessed me in your absence, concern∣ing your welfare, and the wounds you receiv∣ed in my defence.</P>
<P>These wounds (replied Orsamus) have been less cruel than those I received from your fair eyes; they would admit of a cure, but these daily augment, without hope of remedy. Oh! my dearest princess! I die daily, and every moment begets a new death. If your anger has prepared me a condemnation, I will re∣ceive the fatal doom from your mouth with a perfect and entire obedience. Believe it, Or∣samus, (replied she) you will not obtain it so easily as your imagination flatters you; neith∣er prehaps has my severity proceeded from the cause your opinion has taken it. No, no; I have not been insensible of your love, nor re∣gardless of your merits, but have prized them both at their true value in my breast.</P>
<P>Orsamus bowing his head at this discourse with a profound respect; Then, Madam, re∣plied he, I am not utterly lost, for if my prin∣cess vote me happy, I will bid defiance to for∣tune's malice; since she cannot with all her stock of misfortunes make me miserable. But, Madam, what shall this happy wretch do, whose life you have preserved with such excess of ge∣nerosity? what price shall he add for the least of these divine bounties: by a fidelity, repli∣ed Cynthia, which I value above my father's
<PB N="18" REF="033593_0017_0FF7974B0B075570"/>
crown; and, by which till death you may preserve that affection, whereon you establish your happiness. If that be the means, replied Orsamus, I will be happy to my tomb, and all human considerations shall not make me wa∣ver one moment in my inviolable loyalty. But, Madam, continued he, after a small pause, if I may have licence to ask it, how shall we dis∣pose of our affairs in this condition, whereinto fortune hath blindly brought us? The happy title of brother you have conferred on me, hath preserved my life and by your bounty I begin to prize it at its true value, so that I can dare the effects of fate. But for you, my dear princess, that you should be brought to such extremes, is that which galls my heart with unexpressible grief. My misfortunes are become my chief felicity, but I am too misera∣ble in yours; you have raised me to the height of human happiness, then gratitude calls that I should purchase your content. Fortune, spight of herself, shall shortly give you ease, or put a period to the cause; since to expect her to be kind, is to involve ourselves in greater dangers. Desperate wounds must have des∣perate cures; extremes must be thus served, when bliss and happiness be in danger of a wreck, boldly to dare it, bravely to preserve it. Thou wretched rival, obstructor of my bliss, continued he with a tone somewhat ele∣vated,
<PB N="19" REF="033593_0018_0FF7974CADDD60F8"/>
I'll give an exit to thy love and life; though guarded by a thousand swords, nothing shall secure thee from my arms; if I fail in the attempt, I shall have the satisfaction, that I did endeavour your quiet, though I could not ef∣fect it.</P>
<P>O Sir! said Cynthia, with a timerous agita∣tion of spirit, do not with such rash resolution cast away your life, but consider that stroke that ends your days gives a period to mine.— Oh! think in the custody of what villains I shall be left, acquainted with nothing but what is ill! Then death may fly me; and that may be taken from me I esteem far above my life. I shall have none then to participate in my sor∣rows, or revenge my quarrels, when you are gone. Death, when all hope is past, will not fail to relieve us; fortune is full of vicissitudes; and being unkind so long, must at last be just: that valour is unconquerable to which discre∣tion is joined, when wisdom directs it for the most advantage. The caution will be pardon∣able, when you remember I interceded for Cyn∣thia's safety in the welfare of Orsamus. As yet respect seems to have the upper hand in his thoughts, let us not abuse it to our utter destruction: In the mean time, seek to attempt nothing but upon good mature consideration in each others life. We may continue safe, and be good companions in adversity: Let your
<PB N="20" REF="033593_0019_0FF797511C498FD8"/>
carriage be circumspect, that he may not sus∣pect you for any other than what you seem; so you may remain secure, whilst I rest firm guarded with my innocency. Because he has made you the agent of his love, you may feed him with hope; for it will be dangerous to lose those advantages he hopes from you: My carriage unto him shall be followed by your ad∣vice; and you may tell him what your reason and wisdom accords to, is convenient; always reserving my honor intire. And seeing Or∣samus, I repose my honor in your trust, look you do not fail my confidence. O, Mad∣am! replied Orsamus, that life which you set so high a prize on is not worth the care you take to preserve it; but it were no life were it not wholly at your devotion; and being only yours, I shall be careful not to cast that life useless away, which is reserved wholly and entire for your interest. Your commands shall lead me by the hand, which I will execute as far as weary life will go. 'Twere a sin, re∣plied Cynthia, to doubt your fidelity and the continuance may not go unrewarded. But let us leave this discourse for some time more agreeable, and consider how to treat the pirate at his return, which will not be long. I'll shew myself somewhat kinder, that he may conceive you have prevailed something in his behalf; and, this kindness, if my expectation fail me not, shall purchase a relation of his life▪
<PB N="21" REF="033593_0020_0FF79752AB662B20"/>
which will for a small time free me from his importunities, and in some sort dissipate my misfortunes by the history of his disasters, since we naturally find a pleasure in the reher∣sal of past miseries. His respect and behav∣ior towards us shews him to be more than what he seems; yet this odious course makes him seem less than what he is. His life in my ap∣prehension, must be monstrous that walketh in a way so uncommon.</P>
<P>In such discourses they passed away the small time of the pirate's absence; but fortune soon took care they should not surfeit their joys, by hastening his return to the cabin. And hav∣ing saluted Cynthia with much respect as his mistress, and caressed Orsamus as her brother, he seated himself to participate of their dis∣course, which he apprehended did tend to his advantage.</P>
<P>He was opening his mouth to speak, when the fair princess prevented him; and taking the word with an air, replied, with a grace and behaviour only peculiar to herself, she began her discourse thus. "Sir, your kind∣ness used to my brother is no small obligation that I owe you, nor have you failed in your purpose when you made him your solicitor; since none can more persuade my inclination or more freely dispose of me than he; yet he, I think, will not agree to force my will to what
<PB N="22" REF="033593_0021_0FF797543ADD6988"/>
is repugnant. If I must love, I would have a subject worth my affection. Such you may be if your life has been regulated and guided by that rule formerly, as in this time since we have been your prisoners. But the fairest fruit is not always pleasant to the taste; nor will a wise merchant purchase commodities without a trial. We may paint the sun, but not his warm influence; and the fire, but not its heat.— With small trouble you may ease me of this doubt, in relating your extraction and birth, and the past adventures of your life."</P>
<P>This bold language of Cynthia put the pi∣rate to his dumps, knowing the relation of his life would diminish the esteem they had of him; and should he give her a denial, he began to fear her first resolution; so that for a small time his thoughts were upon the rack, and he sat possessed with a deep silence; but at last re∣collecting himself, he made this reply.</P>
<P>"Madam, cease these horrible resolutions, for I find it impossible to disobey you; you shall be satisfied with the true narration of the disas∣ters of a miserable wretch, injured by fortune, and pursued by fate, the relations of which will set my wounds bleeding afresh, yet Madam, you shall be obeyed. Then prepare yourselves with attention to receive the satisfaction you desire, whilst I entertain you with the tragic sto∣ry of my life, which if it cannot beget love, it may produce pity.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="033593_0022_0FF79755D4FA7008"/>When Orsamus and Cynthia had seated themselves with regard, in expectations of his discourse, after he had satisfied himself in some particular niceties and scruples of his discourse, with sadness in his looks and actions he began as followeth.</P>

<HEAD>THE TRAGICAL ACCOUNT OF THE UNFORTUNATE LOVES OF ALMERIN AND DESDEMONA:</HEAD>
<P>IN the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> sea is situated an island called Sicilia, renowned over the world for the sweet wholesomness of the air, and fer∣tility of the soil; extolled highly by fame for the wonderful mountain Etna, there fixed; which being always on the outside covered with snow, yet by a sulpherous or brimstone matter doth continually burn within. Often∣times the flame mounting upwards is so strong it brings up with it burnt and scorching stones, and pieces of hard substances, which seem to be rent out of some rocks, to the great terror and danger of the beholder. Report has not been idle in proclaiming the known rarities of this isle; but above all, that so much famed ci∣ty of Syracuse, twenty-two miles in compass, walled about with three strong walls, for strength and security; watered with many sweet springs adorned with many gardens, and pleasant ar∣bours;
<PB N="24" REF="033593_0023_0FF7975A3AAD7FE8"/>
the noble buildings added to its gran∣deur, whose lofty towers and turrets seemed to support the skies, retaining a majesty, and yielding a glorious shew to the eyes of the be∣holders. It was the mart town of the island where ships go out, and resort thither, to and from all parts of the world, which enriches the inhabitants.</P>
<P>It was this city that gave me birth; although my father had his original out of Norway, a kingdom far hence distant, towards the fro∣zen north, his inclinations being more to trav∣el strange countries than live a quiet life in his own; when the one begets nothing but effem∣inateness and sloth, and the other produces ex∣perience and valour. So that with his father's consent he took his journey, having well stored himself with jewels and money, necessaries ve∣ry needful for such a voyage; in a few years he ranged over the greatest part of Afri∣ca and Asia, where he saw the famous cities of Grand Cairo in Egypt, the city ot Jerusalem in Palestina; where he did behold many rare monuments, with the lofty pyramids. Hav∣ing passed through many large dominions, at last he arrived at Constantinople, the imperial city of the Grecian empire. Here he spent some time, and at last took shipping there to visit the isles of the Mediterranean sea; so that he came at last to the famous island of Sicilia,
<PB N="25" REF="033593_0024_0FF7975BD83D4AB0"/>
where the pleasantness both invited and incited his longer stay and abode.</P>
<P>Where, by strange fortunes and unheard of chances, he was made known unto King San∣credus, who at that time had his residence in Syracuse, in whose affection he gained so great an esteem, as he gave his own kinswoman in marriage, enriched him with several lordships, made him one of his council, and Governor of the famous city of Syracuse.</P>
<P>I was his only son, and in this city I receiv∣ed my life and education. I lived with my father in a garb befitting a prince rather than a Governor's son. All their hope and comfort they seemed to treasure up in me. Thus I continued until I arrived at the age of sixteen years, and became capable to receive the im∣pression of love.</P>
<P>Small time had passed away afterwards before fortune presented me an object to beget it.— For fate had so decreed, that in a pleasant gar∣den belonging to the city, garnished with ma∣ny private walks, among which I had chosen out one for privacy, to retire from the scorch∣ing heat of the sun, here it was I went to seek rest, and found eternal disquiet; for by the bank of a little rivulet, which had a thorough∣fare, and many turnings in the garden, sat a most beautiful damsel, who had seated herself as it were to observe the secret gliding of the
<PB N="26" REF="033593_0025_0FF7975D8C8BAB80"/>
murmuring stream. The place where I had retired was so ordered by nature, that I could see, yet remain unseen. Her years might be about fourteen; her stature tall, and comely; her face the perfect map of beauty, where the lillies and the roses did seem to surpass in glory what nature had ever framed, or art ever per∣fected; I beheld her with amazement; for never before did my eyes behold any thing so lovely.</P>
<P>Thus unperceived was I conquered by this unknown beauty; and at that fatal hour, with∣out resistance, I became her slave, and resolv∣ed to wear her chains.</P>
<P>Yet how to make my addresses unto one that till then I never saw, or to talk of love to her, both seemed gross▪ the first seemed too full of confidence, and the other seemed to fa∣vour much of impudence.</P>
<P>But here fortune supplied this want, and at first seemed to court me; but it was only to drill me into greater miseries; for no sooner I saw her rise from the place where she sat, but I made towards her, from the place where I lay concealed, when behold this charming beau∣ty was surprized by an unknown stranger, who with expressions of joy uttered these words; "Fortune, I defy thy further malice, and dare my fate to make a second relapse in my de∣sires"—So that by force, in spite of her resist∣ance,
<PB N="27" REF="033593_0026_0FF7975F3A161E00"/>
taking her delicate body rudely in his arms, he began with a more than ordinary pace to convey her to a neighbouring thicket. My eyes had never left her, but were wholly em∣ployed and fixed on this insolent action, per∣formed on so lovely a creature. I needed no solicitors but her cries to prepare me for a re∣venge; and it was but a few moments betwixt the resolution and the execution; for with the utmost dilligence I pursued him by the same track I saw him pass. Such expedition I made that my haste outwent his speed, and my fury overtook him before I had time to consult with reason; so that without demanding any ques∣tions, I run him through the body, and he not having disburthened himself of his fair prey, fell down, clasping her in his deadly arms.</P>
<P>The first thing I did was to free her from him, which with some trouble I performed.— After I had set her at liberty from that danger, and her frighted spirits returned to her again, she fell down at my feet, and embracing my knee, Sir, said she, this sudden assistance per∣suades me to esteem you as the genius of my better fortune, since you have by timely re∣demption preserved what is more precious to me than that we prize most dear.</P>
<P>Her tears and sweet speeches transformed me from my usual temper; and I could not behold her in that mournful posture without
<PB N="28" REF="033593_0027_0FF79761B0638708"/>
participating in her sorrows; so that taking her in my arms, I returned her this answer: Madam, I rejoice in being made the happy cause of preserving you, if I have obliged you in this action, I have a satisfaction above what I could hope, and fortune has been kind above my hopes, in affording an opportunity to man∣ifest my affection. O Madam! blame me not when I reveal I love you. If you think I have obliged you, Oh! pay it in love, and I shall soon become the debtor; and talk not of death, when the gods detest thy propositions; but think lovely creature, if so much beauty can be without pity, and yield no redress to my love, death will be kinder than you, and yield a remedy when you deny it.</P>
<P>This said, I set my sword against my breast, saying, here Madam, is that, that will yield re∣lief in necessity; and seeing I cannot live without love, I will endeavour in death to gain your pity; and if my love is become an of∣fence, this very sword shall make satisfaction, and destroy that life that gave it birth. She no sooner saw this desperate offer at my life, but casting an eye of pity on my rashness. Oh! hold, says she, that fatal weapon, the cruel dis∣turber of my quiet! and think, whoever you be, what an error I must commit in yielding to love one who till this moment I never saw: and how shall I forget paternal duty to give
<PB N="29" REF="033593_0028_0FF79765207B6248"/>
myself away without their knowledge. Con∣sider what an obligation will lie on you, when I rely upon your promise of fidelity to preserve my honor entire; and how the gods will pun∣ish you if you prove purjur'd.</P>
<P>Virtuous lady, replied I, you wrong my love to think it base, and my integrity to imag∣ine I may prove unconstant. No, no Madam, your charms are too strong to be rivalled by any other objects, and affection too entire to be deceived by any other beauty. Because you shall not be obliged to love one you know not, and to esteem one that till this moment you never saw; to disperse those doubts, know my name is Almerin, the only son of Artme∣dorus govenor of this famous city of Syracuse; never before unfortunate, if you prove pitiless; never before happy, if you become kind. If ever I endeavour to violate your honor, or think to commit so great a sacrilege on your virtue, let all the gods rain down vengeance on my head for my disloyalty, and let the heavens be witness to what I promise.</P>
<P>Oh hold! said she, swear not by that; can∣kers may eat a flower on the stalk: and when in these cheeks and lips which you extol so high, shall not be left red enough to blush at perjury, when you shall make it, what will be∣come of me then?</P>
<P>O Madam! replied I, cease those doubts▪
<PB N="30" REF="033593_0029_0FF79766B0D3F060"/>
and dissipate such needless fear; the sun shall as soon faulter in his career, the stars drop from their places, where they have of old been fixed; the earth shall remove, nature shall al∣ter her course, and all impossibilities shall be performed, when I prove disloyal.</P>
<P>These protestations did give her some satis∣faction; and prevailed so far with her, that she suffered me to enjoy the privilege to accom∣pany her to her parent's house, which was within the city. When we came thither she gave her friends to understand the timely assist∣ance I gave her, as also my birth and quality, and authority in the city. They no sooner received this relation from their daughter, but they bade me welcome, and caressed me with the greatest endearments. My entertainment was extraordinary: but the kindness that was bestowed on me was not after the lofty court mode, but most familiarly, as if I had been a near relation to them, and gave me thanks in the most obliging terms for the kindness conferr∣ed on their daughter, which I could receive without a blush. Here it was I learned his name was Philaster, an aged knight, that liv∣ed there many years; that his fair daughter was his only child, whose name was Desdemo∣na.</P>
<P>In several discourses we passed away the time while supper lasted, where the chiefest delica∣cies
<PB N="31" REF="033593_0030_0FF797686CF5CFB8"/>
I fed on was Desdemona's beauty; and indeed it was she alone made all things seem pleasant.</P>
<P>Supper being ended; and the evening far spent I began to prepare for my departure. Af∣ter I had bade farewel to the old knight and his lady, I began to order myself to take leave of the fair Desdemona, and in this manner I accosted her, "Fairest of creatures, let not absence beget a neglect in my love, but think of the torments I endure; and though neces∣sity enforces me to leave you, yet think how all places will seem a hell when you are absent; and that you bring a heaven of felicities, when∣ever your fair self doth appear. O Desdemo∣na! I must leave you; yet shall I tell you, a poor criminal never went to execution with more reluctancy than this cruel parting seems to me, since I must leave all my happiness with you, and go away accompanied only with my torments and miseries." I had proceeded farther, but I saw some attentive to understand what I said.</P>
<P>Desdemona returned me no answer, but a blush. And after I had with an extacy sealed a kiss on her fair hand, I took my leave; yet not before the old knight and his lady desired me that I would honor them so much as to further oblige them with a visit. This com∣pliment over, I was conducted, and accom∣panied
<PB N="32" REF="033593_0031_0FF7976CC2EC0C00"/>
by them all to the door where stood a chariot richly adorned to convey me to my father's house. Here it was I parted from them, and bid the first farewel to myself. I was no sooner arrived at my father's house, but was welcomed by the greatest kindnesses that might be, my presence diverting the fear of a∣ny dangers that might befal me. They began to enquire how I passed the evening so late; but I had a story ready that gave them satisfac∣tion. After a while I gave them good night, and betook myself to rest.</P>
<P>But small rest, heaven knows, it was I could take: my fancy formed the idea of fair Desde∣mona; and it was only these thoughts that did give a small cessation to my torments.</P>
<P>In this sort I passed away the time, thinking the night exceeded its usual length, exclaiming against Phoebus for his sluggish approach; and yet when he did appear, how often have I wish∣ed his absence! so that night seemed a vexa∣tion, and day a torment. Some few days pass∣ed, and what for want of sustenance in the day, and for want of rest in the night, my spir∣its began to decay, and my body fore-weaken∣ed; my colour faded away, and my youthful vigour abated, so that I was but an emblem of what I had been. My careful parents wond∣ered at this sudden alteration and change; the physicians were sent for, but their conjectures
<PB N="33" REF="033593_0032_0FF7976E54495048"/>
came far short of the disease; every one gave his judgment as fancy and opinion gave them birth, but all came short of the symptoms of my disease. My careful parents never forsook my pillow, seeking to search out the cause of this distemper, that so they might provide a remedy.</P>
<P>Perhaps you wonder I did not reveal my love to them at such a time when there was a possibility of having my desires granted.</P>
<P>Fairest lady, said he looking upon Cynthia, you will not marvel, nor have occasion to blame me, when you understand that about six weeks before I was betrothed, by my parents consent, to a fair damsel named Artemesia, second daughter to the earl of Palermo. Indeed I think she was more noble than fair, yet her beauty was not so mean but it might have satis∣fied my nicety, had I never beheld the be∣witching charms of fair Desdemona.—'Twas on this fatal marriage I was destinated a victim to my parents will, not my desires. I knew my father to be a man too passionate, and not to be altered by persuasions in his proceedings. Besides, this marriage seemed to augment and agree with his ambition; and his being allied to so great a lord, no mean honor. He was obstinate in his humours, nor could reason make him reverse what he had decreed; but especially those he imagined did tend to fur∣ther
<PB N="34" REF="033593_0033_0FF797700BB9F018"/>
and advance his aspiring ambition. These were the unhappy causes that I did not reveal to them the affection I had for the fair Desde∣mona.</P>
<P>As nothing continues always in one state and condition, so my distemper began to abate, and my weakened body began to recover a little strength; yet in my mind I received no com∣fort, since my dearest physician was absent.— Phoebus had scarce run his career thrice in this upper world, and lodged himself in the western ocean, but I left my bed: and though I was extremely feeble, yet I did endeavour to walk, and the first small journey I made, was secret∣ly to Desdemona. I had no sooner set my face towards that part of the city, but mark the wonderful effects! although my body was weak, yet methought in every step I went towards her I received new strength; when I arrived, and entered the house, my body became as if it had been inspired with a new soul; and well it might, since it was there alone the felicity and content, which was the extacy and rapture of my soul, did reside.</P>
<P>Such unthought of alteration had my small time of sickness begotten on me, that none in the house could hardly discern who I might be; but these thoughts were silenced when I reveal∣ed myself; so that they seemed to be possessed with amazement rather than unbelief. In a
<PB N="35" REF="033593_0034_0FF79772A6B07AE0"/>
few moments all their suspicions were vanish∣ed, so that I was entertained with their accust∣omed kindnesses. In a few moments fair Des∣demona did appear; and although she was forewarned by some in the house, yet in her first approach she could not contain from won∣der. She bade me welcome as her deliverer, not as lover; yet did her eyes speak pity to my disasters; and then her looks seemed a sov∣ereign balsam to expel the worst of miseries: what shall I say, it was here my sickness took its birth, and it was here I had the only reme∣dy to expel it.</P>
<P>After dinner the old knight and his lady, with fair Desdemona, invited me to take a walk into a fair garden adjoining their house, beau∣tified with shady arbours, where nature was helped by art to make the work more exqui∣site, and was adorned with many pleasant walks.</P>
<P>But in the midst of the garden was a house of pleasure, the fairest for workmanship that ever I beheld; so that nature grew envious that art should excel her, endeavouring with fine shady trees, and what sweet summer's live∣ry wears, to conceal it from the eyes of the spectators, when the pretty birds that harbour in those boughs seem to cross her intents with their melodious notes, inviting the eyes of the beholder not to leave so rare a work unseen.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="033593_0035_0FF797752FD8CF50"/>Into this garden I accompanied them, where we had some discourse on different subjects, which I think impertinent, and nothing relat∣ing to the story of my life. Thus having pass∣ed away some time, Philaster and his lady re∣tired themselves into the house of pleasure be∣fore related, and left Desdemona only to enter∣tain me. This opportunity fell out above my thoughts; and being unwilling to lose so fair a time, as we walked along the alleys I began this discourse.</P>
<P>Fairest Desdemona, I cannot tell whether <HI>I</HI> should say you are more kind than cruel, or whether you are more fair than <HI>I</HI> am misera∣ble. See, my divine lady, behold <HI>I</HI> die alive; and what is more cruel than living death? can∣not you pity one that dies for love? O, pierce my heart! It is the nobler way, and let me not live in such torments.</P>
<P>Sir, said she, <HI>I</HI> am not insensible of your love, nor do <HI>I</HI> take any pleasure in your tor∣ments; <HI>I</HI> would <HI>I</HI> could perform the one as willingly as <HI>I</HI> can the other, you should not lan∣guish for a remedy. If a return of love and compassion can give you ease, <HI>I</HI> can pity; if that be too low, <HI>I</HI> can grieve; if this will not do, O think, sir, in what bands you are bound not to violate my honor. Oh! seek not to ruin this, and command all things besides <HI>I</HI> am able to perform.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="033593_0036_0FF79777A5CE6FB0"/>O Madam, replied I, heaven send those pun∣ishments on my head I so lately did invocate, if I intend dishonor to you person. No, Mad∣am, 'tis lawful marriage I desire; and what is more honorable? This way you may secure∣ly give cessation to my torments, and not injure your chastity. Oh! think if you can pity, as you give me to understand you can; be not cruel to let me pine away with sorrow, when you are the only physician that can give me a remedy.</P>
<P>I had scarce finished these last words but old Philaster, and his lady, left the place where they had remained during our discourse; and their too sudden approach robbed me of Des∣demona's answer. So that we made towards them; and joining our company and discourse with theirs, we passed away the residue of that time, fortune not offering me that day another opportunity where I might with secrecy renew our discourse. After a while we left our diver∣sion, Philaster forsook the garden, and we at∣tended him in, where we spent the remainder of the day. I then took my leave of my char∣mer. And altho my desires were frustrated, and my intentions prevented of speaking unto her, by reason of her parents being present; yet my eyes and countenance severely spoke the language of my heart. And as far as I could perceive I did not find she had any aver∣sion for my love.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="033593_0037_0FF7977937989AE0"/>With this hope of good fortune I gave Phi∣laster the good-night, and returned secretly to my father's, where they all wondered at my long absence, yet glad to see me recovered so well, wondering from whence the cause of such a sudden sickness should arise, also at so uncommon a recovery; but leaving them to conjectures, I went to my chamber, where I passed the night in a different manner from what I had formerly done, my hopes now having overcome my despair. In such pleas∣ing thoughts the hours passed away; yet not so swift but I could number them, and think them slow in going. I arose and attired my∣self with a more than ordinary curiosity; build∣ing many hopes in expectation of what the following day might bring forth, and the hour approaching wherein visits are accustomed to be given, I took my way to Philaster's house. As my visits were become more common, I was esteemed a less stranger, and my enter∣tainment was more familiar and friendly: so that after some discourse had passed, I request∣ed the favour of Philaster that I might take the privilege to pass some small time away in his fair garden: which request was kindly granted, himself intending to accompany me; when behold, as we were entering the garden, he was sent for by a messenger, that informed him that his brother did attend him, desiring
<PB N="39" REF="033593_0038_0FF7977ACDD73E50"/>
some conferrences with him about earnest occa∣sions that would not admit of delay; so after pleading necessity for his untimely parting, he left me.</P>
<P>Half an hour had not passed since I enter∣ed the garden, but I saw fair Desdemona, who was sent by her father to entertain me in his absence. I made towards her with much respect, and she accosted me with as kind a reception, with such innocency as might seem to bring in compass the extravagant thoughts of any but myself.</P>
<P>Here it was we betrothed ourselves to each other and registered our vows in heaven.— Here it was I could not bound my joy, and consequently my passion; so that I could not retain from folding her delicate body in my arms, giving and receiving many a sweet kiss on her ruby lips. In this rapture of ravish∣ment we spent the time, till Sol with his scorching beams, forced us to retire into that house of pleasure before-mentioned. This proved a defence against the heat, and a cov∣er to act our loves more securely. Here we did double our kisses and embraces, while the pretty birds did seem to participate my hap∣piness. The favours she then conferred on me could not yield content and satisfaction to my desires, but served only to beget a confi∣dence to presume to purchase greater, and as∣pire
<PB N="40" REF="033593_0039_0FF7977E4995DF68"/>
to higher felicities. So that from the fa∣miliar conversation I began to request the fru∣ition of that love I then enjoyed: and follow∣ing my requests with such intreaties and im∣portunities, with a promise of never failing fi∣delity, urged by such strong persuasions, and resisted with such faint denials, that I came to the yielding up of that fort, which the great∣est kings might envy me the conquest of; in the enjoyment of which imperial monarchs would have accounted it the highest felicity; all which was wholly prostrated to my raging pas∣sion and lustful desires.</P>
<P>The kisses, embraces and endearments, were almost numberless, our discourse treat∣ing wholly of our loves and servent affections of the day of marriage. Thus we spent our time in a paradise of pleasure; passing these few minutes we stayed there in such felicity as might well be termed the chiefest happiness of lover's bliss.</P>
<P>But to defer your expectation no longer, I'll go forward in my discourse, and give you to understand, that after I had quitted old Phi∣laster's hospitality and kindness, with the these of his daughter's honor, and against the vows I had made, by inticements and deceit, I had forgotten the fairest jewel in Desdemona's ward∣robe, we saw him and his lady enter the gar∣den. With all expedition we forsook our de∣lights,
<PB N="41" REF="033593_0040_0FF79780CD22EE28"/>
and descended down a private pair of stairs, unseen of them, being shaded by the friendly trees, which, in the time of our de∣lights, seemed to stand as watchmen to defend us, and now a screen to secure us. This way we passed, left they might suspect what indeed was true, and so prepared to meet them acci∣dentally. Here we joined company and dis∣course with them, and passed away the residue of time till dinner was brought in, upon which notice was given, we left the garden, and spent the remainder of that day altogether in diver∣sion, till night began to approach, and urged my departure; and returning them many thanks for their civilities and kindnesses, I took my leave of Philaster and his lady; and hav∣ing saluted Desdemona with a promise of a sud∣den return to require her in marriage of her parents, according to my vows in the garden, I left her, and with her all my joys.</P>
<P>I soon arrived at my father's house, but I found him inquisitive above his usual manner, to know where I had passed away my time these three days past; my absence having be∣got a suspicion in him of what indeed was true; and sudden sickness, seconded with as quick a recovery, did confirm him: so that seeing me well recovered, and almost in as good a state of health as when I first fell sick, he began his discourse to me in this manner.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="033593_0041_0FF7978294EE5A48"/>Son, your sudden health cannot give me more joy than the extraordinary cause gives me suspicion, lest in your carriage, which hath been so reserved to me, you should act any thing which should fall contrary to my intentions and desires. You know the time will draw short∣ly near when you must marry your contracted bride, fair Artimesia; one which is fortunate as fair, and as wise as fortunate; one, my son, that will raise thee to a high esteem of high honors, which is the mistress young gallants court. And by the alliance of so great a lord, we shall be made shot-free against the strong∣est batteries of fortune.</P>
<P>"Sir, (said I) your suspicions are not grounded amiss: if you suspect I love, and if I be a criminal in making it a secret unto you, forgive and pardon me when I shall make a re∣al confession. Yes, Sir, I do love, and with that ardour and affection, with that constancy and fidelity, as death cannot divert my incli∣nations: and should you make a separation, or imagine an alteration, know, Sir, my vows are registered in heaven, which if you once en∣deavour to violate, expect the punishment may attend your endeavours. You may com∣mand my life, since you give it me; but my soul, it is the gift of the gods."</P>
<P>This discourse, uttered with as much bold∣ness as confidence, began to raise a storm in
<PB N="43" REF="033593_0042_0FF79784256EBBB0"/>
my father's countenance; for the form of his visage began to overcast with frowns, and all his actions beclouded over with anger. So that casting a frowning look on me, enough to daunt me, had not my love made me proof against his fury, and confident to sustain his utmost charge.</P>
<P>Villain, replied he, and shame to thy blood, dare you justify and vindicate that which is con∣trary to my intentions? or can your disobe∣dience own what I have an aversion against? Shall my hopes be thwarted by your extrava∣gant youth, and my purposes frustrated by your ill-placed love? Curse on your willful ob∣stinacy, which puts me into this unusual pas∣sion; and your boldness, that durst give me this relation. Ungoverned young man! Can you think this giddy-headed youth, subject to all passions, and pliable to all impressions, should better know how to govern his passions and direct his actions, than his aged sire? Can he better chuse for his good, than one who hath so often been acquainted and concerned with the vicissitudes and changes of this nature? No, no, young man, you yet want that experience, which is always the best school-master, and the mistress of understanding. Your youth is un∣ruly, and like a headstrong horse that will run himself on any danger, without he be surely curbed: so you grow bold and impudent, dar∣ing
<PB N="44" REF="033593_0043_0FF79786AE6424F8"/>
any precipice so you may possess your un∣bounded desires; but know I'll curb you from these extravagancies, and retain you from these wild wandering thoughts; and if I have been too indulgent, for the future you shall find me as severe: and so avoid my sight, that by the want of duty art become a grief to my eyes, and a vexation to my soul, and see that at our next meeting you show not the least aversion against your marriage with Artimesia; but that you bound your love and desires in the compass of my will, and that you tread no strange path, but that you reform and recollect yourself first, by taking your rules from me, and not reso∣lutely <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> run yourself headlong to ruin, and me dishonor: but if you have any extravagant love, destroy it whilst it is young in the bud; and learn to forget it before you come to the knowledge of what it is. Return no answer to justify what I must condemn; but regulate your ways and life by my directions, and hav∣ing so sure a guide, you cannot err or go as∣tray▪ but if you continue still obstinate and audacious in your proceedings, you shall find I will disinherit you both of my love and es∣tate, and make account of you but as a stran∣ger, and a rebel to my blood.</P>
<P>Having said this, he left me and departed. But alas! how can I describe to you the grief that did seize on me at that time, when Desde∣mona
<PB N="45" REF="033593_0044_0FF7978A1A172748"/>
came to my remembrance, and my fath∣er's cruelty was fresh in my memory. Oh! how was I torn between love and duty! now it was love that led me in a maze so difficult and intricate, that my best endeavours could not keep me from ruin. To go forward was dangerous; but to return backward did shew more perilous.</P>
<P>Such Madam, was my desperate condition: my sweetest hopes began to leave me, horror, despair began to possess, and fear razed out the expectation of a more happy change. This confirmed me in the ominous presage that did befal me in my return homeward from my dearest Desdemona.</P>
<P>After I had well weighed and considered all the difficulties on either side that might befal me. I resolved at last that my love should reign supreme, and remain entire to fair Des∣demona; but yet withal, that I would shew a yielding consent to my father's will in my marriage with Artimesia; and like a warter∣man, that rows one way, and looks another, yet brings the boat to the desired place: so I endeavoured by this policy, seeming to accord with my father's desires, when my inclinations roved a contrary course; and whilst openly I did comply with him, inwardly I might pro∣cure my own content; flattering myself, that as fortune had made so sudden a change in my
<PB N="46" REF="033593_0045_0FF7978BAC800B48"/>
happiness, in some small time she might beget as great an alteration in my misfortunes, and at last bring me to the period of my desires: of which, though I had small cause to hope, yet I did not wholly despair.</P>
<P>I did further resolve not to acquaint Desde∣mona with my father's resolution, lest it might beget her discontent. I began to repent of re∣vealing to my father what I should have kept secret, and resolved to conceal my passion for the future, since I had only given manifesta∣tion of love, and not of the person beloved, which I did expound as one happy presage of my fortunate proceeding. This way I had fixed on, since I had no other wherein I might walk with more security. Nor did my hopes altogether fail me; for by my crasty wiles, the next time I accosted my father, I had set on so strange a face on my former pro∣ceedings, shewing myself so dutiful and pliant to all his intents and purposes, as begat won∣der in him when he did behold it. He ques∣tioned of me who this object might be, to whom I did shew so great, and seemed to have so firm an affection not long since, which now I did seem to slight.</P>
<P>I understood very well the subtleness and craft he used, and how like myself his actions were working one way, and his desires another, but both agreed to intrap me in my dearest se∣cret.
<PB N="47" REF="033593_0046_0FF7978D422915D8"/>
But Old birds are not caught with chaff; for he could not closely work his mine to de∣ceive me, but I as privately made my counter∣mine to blow up, which I performed in this manner.</P>
<P>"Sir, replied I, you were too passionate in you last discourse, and what I proposed only to try your inclinations, how you would have allowed of a change, if I could have admitted of an alteration; this you took to be a verity, and too severely rebuked me for what was on∣ly a fiction; and allowing me only one moment of time, wherein I might disable you in your error, and ask your pardon for my over confi∣dent presumption, in raising so great a tempest from so small a cause, and that I have not, nor never will, fix my affections without your ap∣probation.</P>
<P>This compliance to his will, so contrary to his expectations, began to work wonders in his mind, when my artifice had persuaded him that all my former discourses and protestations were mere deceit; so that instead of continu∣ing so fierce in his proceedings he became more mild, his choler abated, he left accusing me, and began to excuse himself. I soon laid hold of this opportunity, aggravating his mistake, yet by always wherein any likelihood did ap∣pear exempting myself from blame. And so far did I insinuate myself into his soul, of my
<PB N="48" REF="033593_0047_0FF79791BA8333C8"/>
innocence in the cause that he suspected me, that my deceit became approved verities, and what I could relate in my defence received as undoubted truths: so that I think he never parted from me with a greater show of love and satisfaction than at this time.</P>
<P>Whether this occasioned my father's enqui∣ry to cease I cannot tell, but I well know I de∣ceived him in his own craft, and over-wrought him in his own device. Neither did I in words alone confirm him in his belief, but manifested the same in my carriage and actions; so that a week or ten days passed away in this manner before I did offer in the least to absent myself from my father's house. After which time I did secretly and privately many times visit and converse with my Desdemona, but I made my visits much shorter, which was soon perceived and taken notice of by Desdemona, who urged a consummation of our marriage; fearing as indeed afterwards it happened, that some unhappy obstruction might defer it. I comforted her amidst these fears with my promise of loyalty, and with my best endeav∣ours to gain my father's consent; which if I should fail of, I firmly engaged to perform all the rights of marriage at the end of one month from thence next ensuing. We agreed, lest my often resort should beget jealousies of that, which as yet her parents had no mistrust,
<PB N="49" REF="033593_0048_0FF797934F5D78C0"/>
that by a secret way into the garden I should have access at certain times, when I might se∣cretly enter; which to perform we appointed a time at our parting, or else by a certain to∣ken of a handkerchief that gave me assurance that I might securely pass.</P>
<P>By such secret and unmistrusted paths, I of∣ten times visited my dearest lady, who received me with as kind endearments; where I often∣times enjoyed, without controul, the happy felicity and fruition of her love.</P>
<P>In these bitter sweets, and stolen pleasures, some three months had passed since I first saw Desdemona, and almost one since I had made her the last promise of wedlock. Now the time began to draw near to confirm by mar∣riage, what I had already performed by con∣tract with Artimesia. And now alas! my dearest Desdemona found herself conceived and quick with child. In neglecting the first I was sure to procure my father's displeasure; but in the latter, before God and man, I could not quit myself of the grievous ingratitude.— In the first my ignorance might excuse me; but to the latter I could plead no excuse, since my vows to Desdemona proceeded from my very soul, and no doubt had reached the gates of heaven; when my contract with Artimesia proceeded only of course, and in satisfaction of my father's humor, and not for any inclination
<PB N="50" REF="033593_0049_0FF79794E1BD6F98"/>
to love on my own part. So I resolved to con∣tinue firm and constant to Desdemona, and procure my own content, in hazarding my fa∣ther's displeasure rather than to satisfy his am∣bition with my own torment.</P>
<P>The time approached in sight wherein I must be married to Artimesia, but not the least re∣membrance was given me by my father for a preparation; so that I began to bury the tho't of it in forgetfulness; thinking some difference had lately happened between my father and Artimesia's parents; so that I began to account myself secure as to that.</P>
<P>But a change of fortune soon put me out of that mind; for one morning, when I did lit∣tle suspect such deceit, my father desired me to array myself in my best attire, and wait on him to the great temple of the city. This I performed with great willingless, not mistrust∣ing that any deceit or treachery had lain hid in his request; and before I could find the plot, I found myself ship-wrecked on a rock. I was no sooner ready but I attended him to church, only accompanied with my mother, who was of his confederacy. We soon arriv∣ed at the temple, yet with more haste then good speed: for I was no sooner entered, but to my amazement I saw the earl of Palermo, with his daughter Artimesia, with all his and my father's friends attending him, richly attired,
<PB N="51" REF="033593_0050_0FF79796730EE858"/>
and the priest standing ready to join our hands. They all came to receive and welcome me with much respect; but my amazement would not let me receive their kind endearments with a behaviour as I ought to have done; for it was such a strange, disagreeable and unac∣ceptable sight, that I could not suddenly recov∣er from my astonishment; rather thinking it to be a dream or a fiction, than any thing else. My father came and roused me from this trance; "Son, said he, wonder not at what you see, but recollect yourself, and embrace your fortune. Surprizes in love make the en∣joyment of greater value. And this business was managed by me, that a blessing that falls on you unexpected, might be by you more prized and esteemed. Cease your marvel then and accost those friends with respect that are ready to receive you."</P>
<P>His discourse being ended, and the compa∣ny expecting an answer I replied, I must con∣fess Artimesia is a fortune above my hopes or deserts; yet such a one as I cannot with safety possess, lest by enjoying such a happiness, I should enforce heaven to make her wretched and miserable for my sake. For to put you out of doubt, know I am betrothed already to one that is as virtuous as fair; with whom I have tied such an inviolable knot, that it is past the art of man to unloose it without provoking
<PB N="52" REF="033593_0051_0FF7979B19EC5658"/>
the gods to revenge: there is no promise but I have made it, no protestation but I have per∣formed it, no ceremony but I have signed it, nor is there any obligation or vow but I have sealed it. Heaven hath joined our hearts, this can only join our hands. In this, reason will tell you I have shewn no disobedience; since, as I lately told you, heaven gave me a soul, and it is only that I have disposed of with its con∣sent; my body is yet free which you gave me: but it may as well survive without a soul as re∣voke the vows I have lately made. My af∣fection is so entire, that if all things admit of charge, it cannot be subject to alteration. And should death itself approach I should continue firm in the grave.</P>
<P>I had continued my discourse, but my fath∣er hastily interrupting me, drew his sword, and presenting it to my breast, Die thou rebellious villain, said he, and enjoy the fruits of thy la∣bor in the dust. This action was no sooner taken notice of by Artimesia, but she freed herself from her father; and casting herself be∣fore my father's weapon, hold, said she, barba∣rous and unnatural man, and pierce this breast, it will shew less horrid and inhuman. This unexpected action, with his friends persuasions and intreaties, made him sheath his sword, whilst a salamander did seem to live in his eyes, which shot forth fire like a murthering cannon that it
<PB N="53" REF="033593_0052_0FF7979CAADB2930"/>
lightens ere it smokes. Wicked wretch, said he, I disown thee from this hour from being my son, and revoke all ties and privileges that love or nature hath given thee; and do not dare from this minute to assume the confi∣dence to appear in my presence, as thou tend∣erest thy life and safety. Having said this, he left me in a rage.</P>
<P>My father was no sooner departed, but poor Artimesia received a check from her parents for her too much diligence and care in preserv∣ing me, who did slight and neglect her; and that it rather pertained to my friends to have interceeded, and diverted the blow, than her∣self.</P>
<P>My mother, with my relations, came and importuned me not to continue so obstinate, with many intreaties and persuasions, urged the danger I cast myself into, by bringing on my head my father's displeasure.</P>
<P>I was hitherto miserable, but I was more wretched in being beloved by Artimesia. If her love and affection had not been so great, there might have been hopes that my coldness might have begot an aversion in her towards me. But like a merchant o'er charged with debt, when he begins to fail, all things agree to ruin him; so that he only knows then to be wretched, and they from whom he hopes any relief, most times conspire, and agree to his
<PB N="54" REF="033593_0053_0FF7979E71D8E128"/>
ruin. And as the Persians adore the rising sun, and curse it again ere the day be half spent, so fortune seems to court the man who flourisheth in prosperity and scornfully neglects him when he falls into adversity.</P>
<P>This was the last blow, and I utterly undone. For upon notice of my consent, my father re∣turned with Artimesia, and the earl of Palermo her father, where, in the midst of a great throng of people, which this disturbance had brought together, the priest joined our hands; the us∣ual ceremonies were performed with great state, which being once ended, I was attended by my father's friends, and a very great company of citizens to my father's house, where, with, music, dancing and feasting, they passed away the residue of the day; and the night approach∣ed, when my father, with the earl of Paler∣mo, conducted us to our lodging, where they left us, as they imagined, to make a new ban∣quet of pleasures. But they were no sooner departed out of the chamber, taking her by the hand, "Madam, said I, this body you have so virtuously preserved, is but a poor recom∣pence in consideration of the danger you un∣derwent for my sake, and I fear you will soon grow weary of what so lately you had an esteem for, since I am become a burthen and torment to myself, and by consequence in the use may prove so to you. O Artimesia! thou enjoyest
<PB N="55" REF="033593_0054_0FF797A01802F130"/>
this wretched and miserable part of me, the body, when my soul is bestowed elsewhere: thou hast only the shadow of what I am, when another enjoys the substance. How, for your sake only, could I wish love were no mathe∣matic point, but would admit of diversion, that in some sort I might quit the obligation that I owe you! O cruel parents! you are too kind to procure my discontent, and give me no me∣dicine to dissipate it.</P>
<P>Poor Artimesia, stood dissolved in tears at my discourse; and, although I could not love, yet I could not continue insensible of her mis∣eries, nor refrain participating in griefs which had their original from me.</P>
<P>Oh! how I was wrecked by my conscience that ensuing night, which presented my in∣gratitude in lively colours! the day approach∣ed, but to no other end but to renew my mise∣ries, and make my perfidiousness seem the greater. Artimesia, with her kind and sweet speeches, and lovely behaviour, did endeavour to divert the melancholy discontents; and this seemed another dagger to pierce my breast, since I could make no return for such a mine of love.</P>
<P>Two days had passed away since my mar∣riage with Artimesia, and the third approach∣ed, wherein I had given my faith to marry Desdemona. The remembrance wrought so
<PB N="56" REF="033593_0055_0FF797A3B1897520"/>
strong on my affections, that I intended to write and excuse myself, lest she might think, by my neglect, I performed that willingly, that I was enforced to do by necessity; so that taking pen, I wrote and sent her the letter by one that did attend me, of whom I had often made trial of his fidelity; to whom I revealed all the particulars which happened to Desde∣mona and myself, and of the continuance of our loves. It is some comfort in our miseries when we have a partner in our sorrows; one that will participate in our griefs, and to whom with confidence we may reveal our closest se∣crets. Such an one was this man, whose name ought not to be concealed in this story; Fide∣lio was his name, and it well suited his na∣ture. I gave him directions to the garden gate, with charge to remain there till he saw Des∣demona enter. Away he went to execute what I commanded him, whilst I with an earnest expectation waited an answer. Fidelio, long expected at last returned. I no sooner saw him, but I endeavoured to read my destiny in his looks; but I beheld there a sad omen to attend me. Yet with an earnest desire, accompanied with timerous apprehensions, I thus bespoke him. Fidelio, dost thou intend to make me linger away in expectation, and silence with that which being revealed, will kill as soon as know? What is Desdemona's sentence; be
<PB N="57" REF="033593_0056_0FF797A62991A5B8"/>
it happiness or misery, joy or sorrow, life or death, nothing can be bitter or harsh that she commands; but I shall be all obedience. I am loth to suspect where I love, yet it is not without pain I expect your answer, I am earn∣est you should reveal what perhaps I would not know; yet I would fain know the worst, that I might be freed from the fear of worse to come.</P>
<P>He returned me no answer; but drawing a letter from his bosom, Sir, said he, here is that will give a better account of your fortune than myself; peruse it; after which I will give you a relation of the particulars that happened in this small time of absence.</P>
<P>I had no leisure for a reply; but taking her letter, hastily opened it, and read lines, which, while I live, I shall retain and keep in my me∣mory.</P>
<P>Her words, like a dart, wounded my very soul. Her innocent sweetness made my infi∣delity appear more notorious. Fidelio, to per∣fect the grievousness of my own crimes, at my request related these few particulars.</P>
<P>Sir, said he, according to your order and di∣rections, I staid at the garden gate some time: but it was not long before I saw Desdemona en∣ter, and with her presence, like another sun, did dazzle the eyes of the beholders. Her attire was negligent and careless; her countenance
<PB N="58" REF="033593_0057_0FF797A7BAF82D18"/>
seemed to be clouded with sweet melancholy sadness, fitly suited to her thoughts; and tho' all were shadowed and overcast with a veil of grief, yet she seemed charming, since it did on∣ly serve that we might behold her perfections at a nearer distance, and her virtues more ap∣parent and plain; so we may face the sun when he is clouded, which in a clear day we dare not approach with our eyes. Such was her grief, it would make one in love with sadness; and such her gesture, it would make one wel∣come sorrow.</P>
<P>Ravished with this apparition, I knocked at the gate; which <HI>I</HI> had scarce done, but like a goddess she appeared, and fixed her eyes upon my face, perhaps presaging me to be some harbinger of ill news; quickly recollecting her∣self, "Sir, said she, are you not mistaken, have you any business with any person here? this is no common way, and it gives me some cause of wonder how you came here."</P>
<P><HI>I</HI> answered, "Madam, it was not a mistake that bro't me hither, nor by chance that <HI>I</HI> ap∣pear before you, but expresly and on purpose. <HI>I</HI> was sent to you by Almerin, the governor's son of Syracuse, with a letter, with a charge to deliver it into your hands." With these words <HI>I</HI> delivered her your letter; which <HI>I</HI> had no sooner done, but <HI>I</HI> perceived she was possessed with an usual agitation and emotion of spirit;
<PB N="59" REF="033593_0058_0FF797A990A7B3D0"/>
sometimes the roses of her cheeks were overcast with a lovely red, and suddenly they vanished and gave way to the lillies to possess their pla∣ces. She kissed the letter, earnestly enquired of your health, to which, when <HI>I</HI> had given her an answer, she entreated me to walk into the garden; and so shutting the door, she re∣tired herself into a private arbour, where open∣ing the letter, she began to read, whilst <HI>I</HI> seat∣ed myself to behold her.</P>
<P>When on a sudden all former signs of joy vanished; her visage was overcast with a fatal disturbance; her breast began to pant, and a shower of tears began to fall from her fair eyes, which hung on her cheeks like pearly dew on a sweet smelling rose; such were her actions, that they would have induced the wild satyrs and fierce beasts to pity. She shewed nothing of rashness in her carriage; but reserving her complaints mildly, till her spirits being over∣charged with sorrow, forsook her, so that letting your letter fall, she fell into a deadly trance, without any motion, or hopes of life remain∣ing. <HI>I</HI> ran hastily to catch her before she fell, but came too late; so that falling, she seated herself on a bed of violets, which seemed to close and hang down their heads at this fatal misfortune.</P>
<P>Then it was <HI>I</HI> curst you for your perfidious∣ness to so sweet a creature. Heaven only knows
<PB N="60" REF="033593_0059_0FF797ADF05DBE90"/>
the extremes of grief <HI>I</HI> then endured. <HI>I</HI> could not go out of the garden and leave her in that forlorn condition, yet to stay was perilous to my life; but my pity overcame my fear, so that running to a fountain in the garden, and tak∣ing cold water in my hand, <HI>I</HI> sprinkled it on her face; and taking her lovely body in my arms, <HI>I</HI> softly began to blow her; so that o∣pening her fair eyes, and sending two or three heart-breaking sighs, as a token of her soul's return to her body, which was loath, as it seem∣ed, to leave so fair a habitation.</P>
<P>When her senses began to execute their pro∣per function and duty, casting her eyes on me, taking notice <HI>I</HI> had her in my arms, Sir, said she, <HI>I</HI> perceive <HI>I</HI> have been a trouble to you, for which <HI>I</HI> beg your pardon, and intreat you to assist me to yonder house (shewing me a place situate in the midst of the garden) so that rais∣ing her up, <HI>I</HI> supported her by the arm; first taking up your letter, <HI>I</HI> conducted her to the house, where she wrote the letter <HI>I</HI> now deliv∣ered you, and sealing it, gave it me in these words, Tell him <HI>I</HI> wish him happiness and feli∣city; for myself, tell him <HI>I</HI> shall hardly find a∣ny but in the grave. So descending the stairs, <HI>I</HI> attended her to the gate; and taking my leave, <HI>I</HI> left her, bewailing your ingrati∣tude.</P>
<P>Thus Fidelio ended his discourse, and con∣firmed
<PB N="61" REF="033593_0060_0FF797AF84694D90"/>
what he had said to be nothing but ver∣ity. I could not refrain from participating with him, and hate myself, since she continued still to love me; for all my perjury and infi∣delity, betraying and abusing so much inno∣cence, Desdemona sends me word she loves me still, and shall do so in death; she forgives me too, more than I can forgive myself; yet this was the same Desdemona whose goodness and kindness I so much abused, her harmless innocence began to set a higher price on her virtues in my soul than formerly I had for her beauties. I began to know the worth of the treasure I had forgone, and found the value to surmount all esteem.</P>
<P>Now all my thoughts and desires became wholly engaged to tender an ample satisfaction, in recompence of the injuries I had occasioned her, but I found my desires were all fruitless, and that my best performance would be of no value, while Artimesia remained as an obsta∣cle to obstruct my intentions. It was here the agents of hell solicited and assisted me in this tragical design, so that her death was conclud∣ed in a moment; nothing remained but the means how to effect it.</P>
<P>As formerly I was black with perjury, now I began to plot how to be red with murder, in taking away the innocent and guiltless life of one that not five days before had preserved
<PB N="62" REF="033593_0061_0FF797B114905FB0"/>
mine; but reason and consideration were ban∣ished; no thoughts remained but how to ac∣complish what I had so barbarously begun. I had thought of many ways how to bring it a∣bout, but poison at last I resolved on. I was loth to trust any one with a secret of so great a consequence, whereon my life depended; so that I went myself to an apothecary in the city, of whom for a few crowns I purchased the fa∣tal potion, and went to perform my fatal res∣olution.</P>
<P>Being come to my father's, I found poor Ar∣timesia indisposed in her bed; and going to visit her in her chamber, I set down by her, where casting her arms about my neck, and bestowing many a sweet kiss on me, with en∣dearments so obliging, that if hell had not con∣spired her ruin, sure it would have turned the current of my barbarous design. Much dis∣course passed till she desired to take a little rest, so kissing her, I left her to her repose; but taking notice of a posset that was preparing on the fire, the maid being busy about her mis∣tress; like a fiend of hell, I hastily and un∣seen emptied the poison in it, and so departed away undescried. About half an hour after, this envenom'd drink was administered unto her, which spreading itself by degrees into all parts of her vital spirits, which, with its force, soon made a separation betwixt the soul and
<PB N="63" REF="033593_0062_0FF797B2C637E758"/>
the body and left her a breathless corpse. The rumour of her sudden death begat an admira∣tion to whom it was related. Accompanied with father and mother, I went to see her life∣less trunk, not without tears in my eyes; but I cannot safely say whether it was in deceit, the better to cover my villainy, or the woful object presented to my eyes; but for one, or either, or both together, many sighs of sorrow I made. Mean while messages were sent to my father-in-law, the earl of Palermo, with the heavy tidings of his daughter's untimely death. They arrived at the house about the evening; but the lamentations and moans they made o∣ver the untimely hearse of their dear child were numberless. They were not without doubts and mistrusts about the sudden occasion of her death; but having no light whereon they might build or ground a suspicion, it vanished as soon as it received birth. After nature had paid her tribute in paternal tears, her body was carefully coffined up, and in two days, the same company that attended me in my bride nuptials in state and triumph, this day accom∣panied the corpse of poor Artimesia to the tem∣ple, where the body was committed to the earth, after the usual ceremonies of the dead were celebrated.</P>
<P>Four days had passed since the burial of Artimesia, and two since the departure of her
<PB N="64" REF="033593_0063_0FF797B62AFB3838"/>
parents when, to pass away the summer's even∣ing, and to refresh my drooping spirits with the sweet air and pleasant shades. I retired myself, only accompanied with Fidelio, into the same garden wherein I was first surprized with my fair Desdemona.</P>
<P>Phoebus now hastened to bathe his sweltry steeds in the foaming ocean, and his sister Luna began to appear so to expel the usurping shades of night, when being comforted by the refreshing sweetness of her cold influences, so that the pleasures I then enjoyed, accom∣panied with the thoughts of enjoying Desde∣mona, made the time seem short, so that the unexpected hour of ten arrived. Fidelio's intreaties, with the lateness of the evening, could not persuade my return, my mind be∣ing employed on thoughts more agreeable. Af∣ter the clock had struck eleven I intended to leave the garden, but first resolving to visit the happy place where I rescued my dear Des∣demona, it was almost on the stroke of twelve ere I arrived there: the night continued fair and clear, and this was the most private retir∣ing of any in the garden: where I was no sooner arrived, but, to my amazement, be∣hold! by the glimmering light of the moon, I saw a beautiful woman: her countenance was pale and wan, dropping pearly tears from her fair eyes, which she wiped off with a handker∣chief.
<PB N="65" REF="033593_0064_0FF797B8B80942B8"/>
She sat on the ground, leaning her head on her fair hand. She seemed wholly a map of sorrow, and gave demonstrations by her actions that her gesture could not express the torment of her mind. I had no sooner approached near enough to have spoken to her, but as one surprised, she hastily takes away her hand, that supported her head; which she had no sooner done, behold from her breast issued a crimson gore. My amazement was great, when in her face I beheld the features of Desdemona. Her countenance seemed to contend with grief and pity, rather than with wrath and anger.</P>
<P>Frighted with the horror of this sight, I stood like an image of stone, not able to go forward, or retire back; when this woful ob∣ject came nearer unto me fixing her eyes stead∣fastly on my face; after a while raising her right hand, laid it on her wound, which seem∣ed to run in purple flood down her breast, sprinkling the grass with scarlet dye. My amazement was augmented, when unfixing her eyes from my face, she lifted them towards Heaven with so pale and mournful a posture as would have produced pity in the most senseless breast. This sudden surprisal, did cowardice all my spirits, so that I had not the confidence nor courage to speak to this pitiful apparition, which once more lifting up her hands to her
<PB N="66" REF="033593_0065_0FF797BA4FD67950"/>
wounds, giving me a grievous parting look, suddenly vanished out my sight. I was amaz∣ed after its departure, and jealous whether I should believe my eyes or no; or whether this was a real apparition, or a fiction brought forth by fancy, that had figured such dismal ideas in my mind. But the succeeding incidents soon confirmed the effects to be no illusions; for before I could recollect and rally together my frighted spirits, behold from the thicket hard by me issued dismal screeches horrible and fear∣ful moans, accompanied with uncommon and confused voices: the heavens on a sudden cov∣ered themselves with a sable cover, and the moon hid her face under an eclipse. The noise became yet more loud and terrible, and the resounding echo of the horrid clamour drew nearer and nearer, and so became more fearful and dreadful. The horizon was cloath∣ed with thick dark clouds; from whence pro∣ceeded a stormy shower of hail and rain, the wind grew tempestuous and boisterous, fear∣ful slashes of lightning proceeded: after which followed loud and fearful claps of thunder. The storm increased, and became more horri∣ble, when from the neighbouring thicket rush∣ed out a woman, who approached me, and whom I soon knew to be the dead Artimesia. I would have fled from her sight, but could not fly my destiny: when coming yet nearer
<PB N="67" REF="033593_0066_0FF797BCCD999528"/>
unto me, with a weak and feeble voice she ut∣tered these words.</P>
<P>"Wretched man, now the reward of thy wickedness draws near, and thy punishment is at hand. Heaven is ready to leave thee, and the earth is prepared to swollow thee; sen∣tence is pronounced against thee, and a mes∣senger prepared to execute. My innocent death will not go unrevenged, nor your per∣jury unpunished. Go, miserable and wretch∣ed! despair: think of nothing but horrors, shrieks, pains, and torments; let content and felicity henceforth become strangers to thee, and let thy misfortunes become even worse and worse: let thy sleep be short, and disturbed with fearful visions. The remainder of your life shall be a living death: you shall seek for death, but you shall not find it. This is the commission I had to unfold to thee from the higher powers, which having revealed, I leave thee to thy fate."</P>
<P>This said, she vanished from my sight, but not my thoughts; for the remembrance was so fixed in my soul, that I think the feigned fantasm would hardly yield precedency to the real. My eyes were, yet firmly bent towards that part of the thicket I saw Artimesia take▪ And Fidelio, who the time of this tempest had concealed and sheltered himself in a thicket near at hand, after his desires and intreaties
<PB N="68" REF="033593_0067_0FF797BF5E890440"/>
became fruitless, in requiring me to retire with him, when he came unto me, he found me not removed from the same place where he left me. Wondering at this change, he took me by the arm; Sir, said he, what occa∣sions these ghastly looks, and timerous appre∣hensions? You seem as if you had met your sins, or been accosted with your grandfather's ghost. What causes thus to bend your eyes on vacancy, and fix your thoughts on shad∣ows? Where do you let your fancy run at random? Sir, consider where you are, and what time of night it is and let us repair from this fatal place, that has brought you this distur∣bance.</P>
<P>His earnest importunities brought me to myself: and seeing him expect a reply, Yes, Fidelio, said I, my sins have met me in full bloom▪ and ghosts more fearful than my grand∣father. By heaven! Fidelio, shadows haunt me. Saw you not my dearest Desdemona here, and the deceased Artimesia, who just now pronounced the sentence of horror and damnation against me?</P>
<P>"Sir, replied he, these chimeras be nothing but the delusions of a disturbed brain, which forms to itself wonders, which the spectators cannot behold: such no doubt was yours; for I protest and vow to you I heard no voice, nor did I apprehend any such similitudes: Arti∣mesia

lies quiet in her grave, and I doubt not but Desdemona is asleep in her bed; rest will soon cure this disquiet: come, Sir, let us walk home, the night grows aged, the late storm is past, both call on us to depart, lest we should be prevented by a second disaster.</P>
<P>His entreaties, made me accord to leave the garden, and without returning an answer, I straitway accompanied him. We soon came to my father's, where they all sat up expecting my return; but they no sooner beheld me in that condition and ghastly distemper, but they stood like people with amaze. I was led to my chamber by Fidelio, where I betook myself to bed; but oh! the horrors that accompa∣nied me the latter part of the night! If asleep, Desdemona presented herself to my imagina∣tion; yet suddenly starting from the trance, methought I saw that object really which fan∣cy formed in my dreams; so that fearfully call∣ing to Fidelio, who attended me, Oh! Fidel∣io, dost thou not see my dearest Desdemona; the blood streaming from her fair breast, now standing by my bed side? behold she is going away out of the door. Oh stay abused inno∣cence! and tell me the reason thou dost visit me in that dismal posture.</P>
<P>Here Fidelio, to divert these thoughts▪ made me this discourse, Desdemona remains entirely yours, and you may bind her so by
<PB N="70" REF="033593_0069_0FF797C36BD7D8B0"/>
tying that inviolable knot of matrimony, which you have already fastened by so many vows: since Artimesia is dead, there is no obstruction can hinder you from giving her satisfaction, and yourself content.</P>
<P>Here Fidelio ended when I embraced him saying, O my friend! I am willing to believe whatever thou hast related unto me, could it contain less of truth. I should wish no great∣er happiness were Desdemona still among the living; I would cease to expect and aspire to any greater hope, if I could once embrace her in my arms, and repose this weary head in her bosom. To-morrow, my Fidelio, I will put thee to the trouble once more to deliver a letter to Desdemona; in the mean time we will endeavour to take a little rest.</P>
<P>Night had no sooner fled, but I left my bed, and taking pen, I wrote to this effect.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Dearest Heart,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO put thee out of doubt of the constancy of my affections, altho' necessity compelled me to an inforced marriage, yet I knew not how to repair the fault, nor give thee a real mani∣festation of my love, but by destroying the cause that gave us this disturbance; know them, my dear, that to enjoy thy love, and to give thee an example of the integrity of my heart, I have given my wife Artimesia a potion that hath carried her to her long home; and what rests

there now, but that I do thee right and equity, according to my vows, if you dare permit me to that privilege and felicity, and give new life to one that daily dies for you. Send my par∣don signed from your fair mouth by this mes∣senger, in the expectation of which I shall look to remain miserable or happy. If you burn this letter, the thoughts of any future danger is past: for I would not commit the secret of my life to any but Desdemona, since it is only she alone that can dispose of</P>

</LETTER>
<P>I had no sooner ended my letter, but I can∣not tell what horrid fate prompted me to the contrary, to go myself in person, alledging that my presence would procure more in Des∣demona's breast, than my letter could. I went accompanied with Fidelio, towards her fath∣er's house; but we had no sooner, lessened the distance, but behold I saw a coffin covered with black, adorned with a garland of flowers; the hearse was supported and carried by four young men and six beautiful maidens accompa∣nied them, each holding a part of the hearse∣cloth, wherein they did intimate and silently speak their willingness to do something oblig∣ing, it being the last service they could per∣form to the body of this poor departed virgin. The company were all covered with a fable black, their pace silent and slow, bent towards the
<PB N="72" REF="033593_0071_0FF797CA18492DA8"/>
great temple of the city. This sight began to chill my blood: and that which gave suspi∣cion to my fears was, because I saw, them come out of Philaster's house; to confirm me that I was not in an error, I saw the corpse followed by the old knight and his lady; their countenance and actions declared them to be in the bitterness of sorrow, and plunged in the depth of woe.</P>
<P>I had accompanied them to the temple, had not the earnest desire I had to be resolved of the worst prompted me to the contrary, and persuaded me to go to the house to be truly satisfied of my fears. We soon came to the door, and having knocked were met by a ser∣vant of the house, who did know me since I used to frequent the house; and being acquain∣ted with the respect his lord and lady paid me when they requested me to come in. I asked for the knight and his lady, not taking notice that I had seen them; also for Desde∣mona; to which he gave me a pitious look, letting drop from his eyes many tears. "Sir," said he, "you come in a time to see us buried in woe, and to behold us overcharged with sorrow; for about four days ago, after my mistress Desdemona had pined with grief and given to sorrow the full reins and possession in her breast, when her spirits being overcome with grief, and her senses overcharged with
<PB N="73" REF="033593_0072_0FF797CBABAF0390"/>
melancholy, she sell into despair, and walking out as if she would recreate herself in the gar∣den, she retired into a house of pleasure there privately situated, where with a fatal dagger she wounds herself to the heart, and this day, ac∣companied with her friends, in a solemn man∣ner they perform her obsequies, and convey her body to the temple.</P>
<P>Here he ended—while my apparition came bleeding fresh in my mind;—my crimes presented themselves in their own colours; and my conscience bid me expect nothing but the fulfilling of murdered Artimesia's sen∣tence.</P>
<P>I took my farewell, but not without shed∣ding tears for the loss of one whom I so dear∣ly loved.—In this distress of mind, I returned home; and about the hour of ten, at night, while reposing on my bed, suddenly and un∣expected, our house was surrounded with armed men, my chamber doors broke open, my body seized on, and taken prisoner; being thus surprized, I demanded the cause, and by what authority they did it? To which one returned me this sharp answer, their authority they had from the king, which I must obey, and the occasion, the death of your late mar∣ried wife Artimesia, supposed to be poisoned by you; with a suspicion which is conceived of you, that you are the author and cause of
<PB N="74" REF="033593_0073_0FF797CD434EFC20"/>
the death of Desdemona, daughter and only child of an aged knight of this city, called Philaster; these are the crimes to which you must answer; in the mean time you must yield obedience to our power, and immediate∣ly go along with us. This said they laid hands on me, and speedily hurried me out of my chamber, to convey me to prison; but we had not shortened half the way between my fath∣er's house and the city goal, but by the shine of the moon, we might discern a troop of horse, and perceive a small company of foot, which in a void place of the city began to com∣pass us about, which my guard no sooner des∣cried, but they cried out a rescue, a rescue: but their voices were soon stopped by the horse-men which overran them, and the foot∣men that bravely assaulted them: so that in a moment I saw myself free, and bravely mount∣ed on a fresh horse. Whilst I was wondering at the strangeness of this rescue, I saw one make toward me, which I presently knew to be Fidelio. Sir, said he to me, cease your amazement, and follow this guard with speed; for every moment you stay here will be dan∣gerous, and they will safely convoy you to the water-side, where a vessel attends you, provid∣ed by your father, from whom, by my timely notice came also this guard; for he now re∣pents him of his obstinacy which occasioned
<PB N="75" REF="033593_0074_0FF797CEF4182E80"/>
these evils for which you were accused fearing you are too much guilty to stand in justifica∣tion of yourself and your crimes too notorious to abide a trial; and therefore being unwilling to leave you to the mercies and severities of the law, that himself first brought into danger, waits for you at the water-side, with some oth∣er company.</P>
<P>Being conducted to the vessel, and the wind blowing fair, so that we left Syracuse far a∣stern, and a few hours after wholly lost the sight of the island of Sicilia; the gale continuing still fair, we gained a ken of the isle of Malta, where we did not land, but continuing our course almost three days gained a view of the main continent of Africa; and about the eve∣ning of the third day, we anchored before the mighty city of Carthaga.</P>
<P>Here we landed and provided ourselves with all necessaries, as well offensive as defensive, and all other things needful, which our so hasty parting from Syracuse would not permit us to furnish. We lay there one day, and then weighed anchor, and put to sea, where our intentions were to cruize about, in expecta∣tions to meet with some vessels that came lately from Syracuse, of whom we might en∣quire tidings of what we all did so passionately desire to know.</P>
<P>It was now seven days since we parted Sicil∣ia,
<PB N="76" REF="033593_0075_0FF797D3805EA290"/>
and two since we left the coast of Africa, about the time of the day when the sun begins to decline towards the west, when a boy stood centinel on the top mast head suddenly cried out a sail, a sail; being demanded from whence she steered her course? he returned answer from Sicilia. This began to augment the de∣sire I had to have news from Syracuse; so that I gave commands to the pilot to steer his course to her, which he had no sooner performed, but the boy called out again, saying, prepare for your defence, for this vessel bears to us with all speed for an assault. He had scarce ended these words but our eyes did give us proof the were fit for a present fight.</P>
<P>This sight caused them to forget the con∣cernment of others, and to think on nothing so much as to provide for their own safety; yet they agreed with one accord chearfully to make good their defence, and manfully to guard themselves, and me from being captured. We had hardly made our preparations for a resist∣ance, but we saw this vessel with great dexter∣ity preparing to board us on the weather side: their javelins in a moment were ready to grapple with our vessel, in the perform∣ance of which we received a brave assault, and they as gallant repulse. Our archers scarce spent an arrow in vain; neither did their's slack their duty. The fight continued
<PB N="77" REF="033593_0076_0FF797D510EECB08"/>
sharp while we lay off the one from the other, but I heard him that seemed to be the captain of the vessel say these words to his soldiers, "Arm yourselves with courage, noble hearts, and let the king of Sicilia know you are val∣ient. We are not mistaken; see fortune hath presented the murderous villain an object to your eyes, and brought him a sacrifice to our just resentments. Now let the innocent death of Artimesia and Desdemona sharpen your swords for a just revenge, and let their sorrowful parents see your fidelity, and the in∣terest you take in their wrongs, when you present them with the head of their mortal en∣emy.</P>
<P>This speech left us no longer in doubt of their business; and although I esteemed my life scarce worth preserving, yet the great pro∣mise this fellow made of my head made me re∣solve not to part with it friendly to my enemies at such a time when I was in good capacity to defend it. This raised my anger to make a stout resistance; and his oration caused his soldiers to assail us with double courage.</P>
<P>Now the fight began to be at the highest, and a great number of men were slain on both sides. This battle was fought till the sun be∣gan to bid good night to our horizon, yet for∣tune had left it doubtful to which side she should incline: when we were pressed by our
<PB N="78" REF="033593_0077_0FF797D6A60569E8"/>
enemies, with so much vigour, that my men were forced to retire, whilst they furiously mounted our vessel. Here I exposed myself to certain dangers, very willing to part with life, so I could have lost it nobly in resisting my enemies; but death flies them that seek him, and intrudes on such as desire his absence. As I was desperately braving the utmost danger, I met and engaged with their commander, so greedily we combated one with another, and with so much desire endeavoured the ruin of each other, that it was no wonder fortune made haste to determine the end; many cruel blows we exchanged, till at last I pushed my enemy so closely, and redoubled my blows with so much violence, that directing a blow which fell on his head with my greatest force, it part∣ed in two, and he fell lifeless on the deck.— Thus he who so confidently disposed of my head, could not secure his own from my sword.</P>
<P>This sight began to abate the courage of our enemies, and to revive the spirits of my almost vanquished men; for returning with a greater force than at first, they made a mighty slaughter; and having dispatched all those in their own vessel, with great speed we boarded our enemies, so that the offensive were now be∣come defensive, and performed their part so ill in maintaining it that we soon became con¦querors
<PB N="79" REF="033593_0078_0FF797D92AA59E28"/>
of the other ship, committing all the souls to the place appointed for their deserts, where the spirits of all men are rewarded ac∣cording to their merits. The dead bodies of our men, and also of our enemies, we cast overboard into the sea.</P>
<P>The night became extreme dark, not one star appeared in the firmament, as if they had disdained to behold so bloody a tragedy: so that we were forced to strike up lights, the bet∣ter to see to clear the vessel of the dead carcas∣es. Myself, with a torch in my hand, went to behold the slain in the enemy's vessel, where the soldiers, the tempest of their revenge being not yet stilled, without pity cast as well the wounded as dead out of the vessel; when their wounds, miseries, intreaties, prayers, or dismal moans, could not persuade them to mercy.</P>
<P>Among many that were thus used, one of them, whom my men had taken up in their arms ready to cast him away into the ocean, cried out, "O Sirs! spare me but one mo∣ment, and bring me to your commander, to whom I shall relate such secrets as he is yet ig∣norant of." This had not preserved his life, if I had not given a speedy command to the soldiers to hold their hand; and although dis∣figured with wounds, by his voice I quickly discovered him to be the servant of Philas∣ter,
<PB N="80" REF="033593_0079_0FF797DBAF80F320"/>
the same who related to me the death of Desdemona. And from him I learned that the letter I wrote to Desdemona, and which I unfortunately dropped near her father's house, had been found, and delivered to the earl of Palermo; who thereby discovered me to be the murderer of his daughter, and who with a design to revenge her death, had caused me to be arrested; but finding I had been resqued by my father, applied to the King, who imme∣diately armed and sent vessels in pursuit of me; and that the earl's servants, and the servants of Philaster, had voluntarily gone on board, determined to secure the author of the calam∣ities that had befallen their masters. He pro∣ceeded no farther, and perceiving him to grow faint by the loss of blood, I ordered the sur∣geons to administer the best relief; but in vain, for he soon expired.</P>
<P>Day soon advanced, and the enemies vessel appearing the strongest, and best to sail, we re∣moved our stores, sunk our own vessel, and set sail for the city of Algiers, knowing of no o∣ther port that would give us protection, and that only upon condition of our turning pirates.</P>
<P>It would be too tedious, madam, to relate the many adventures thro' which I have since passed; and the many human sacrifices I have made to acquire wealth, and to obtain the fa∣vor of the Dey. But here let me put an end
<PB N="81" REF="033593_0080_0FF797DE21EB8860"/>
to my dismal story. I have given you, mad∣am, a true relation, nor have I interwoven the least falsehood, with a view to draw a veil over my crimes. But when you remember that my first sins proceeded, not from inclination, but from my adverse fate, and that having once entered the gulph of wickedness, there was no possibility of going back, you will ra∣ther pity than condemn me. Was I uncon∣stant to, and did I practise Artimesia's death— Oh! remember my constancy and love to Desdemona; I am incapable of going farther in my own justification. My crimes are a continual torment; but the rehersal of them affords me some satisfaction when it is done by your command.</P>

<HEAD>The continuation of the History of <HI>ORSAMUS</HI> and <HI>CYNTHIA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HERE Almerin ended the story of his life, leaving Orsamus and Cynthia in ad∣miration and astonishment; they saw he was pursued by a divine hand, and that it was im∣possible for him to fly his fate; so that they be∣gan to look on their own condition, fearfully apprehending the calamities that might befal them, in being prisoner to one, who being followed by divine vengeance, made all miser∣able that were concerned in any thing that ap∣pertained
<PB N="82" REF="033593_0081_0FF797DFB51E86A8"/>
unto him. Their fears almost made them despair but that they did remember Hea∣ven doth always assist the virtuous in their greatest calamities, and is nearest at hand, with remedy and relief, when our miseries become most desperate, and past cure.</P>
<P>These considerations dissipated the grief of lovers endured, else it had been too heavy a burden; for their condition seemed so despe∣rate that only a divine power could relieve them. The relation of Almerin's life, became an addition to their own miseries, and an aug∣mentation of their tears, yet in civilitiy she was enforced to render him thanks for his narra∣tion; after some discourse had passed, and night began to cloath herself in a sable black, so putting a period to their discourse, Orsamus and Almerin each taking their respective fare∣wels of Cynthia, left her to her rest; Orsamus retiring to his cabin, and Almerin to give commands to his soldiers, concerning the ship.</P>
<P>Some days passed, while they cruised in ex∣pectation of more prizes; In the mean time, Almerin prosecuted his suit to Cynthia with much eagerness; still keeping himself in the bounds of his respect, until by the return of Cynthia's beauty, his love blew his lust into a flame, which could not be extinguished with∣out peril to either side. Love is a passion of
<PB N="83" REF="033593_0082_0FF797E14BE17930"/>
all others most lovely, until lust take a moiety, and becomes its rival, then it becomes a very tyrant, and is subject to the greatest villainy; for where passion bears sway, there is no admit∣tance for reason.</P>
<P>About nine days had passed away, since they were first surprised, when he came very rudely into her cabin, and with much insolence treated her in this manner: Madam, I see all civilities have been lost, and you provoke me to destroy all the considerations that have flowed from that fountain. I have henceforth decreed to seek my satisfaction by other means, so that I allow you until to morrow to frame a resolution, and if that fail to overcome your obstinacy, I shall know how to oblige you un∣to it, in spite of your aversion. He confirmed this menace with many others; and his actions agreeing thereunto told him to have spoke nothing but what he fully determined before in his mind; saying this, he left the cabin with∣out the least respect; and in going out, he fortuned to meet Orsamus, then going to pay his usual visit to Cynthia, and greeting him in his rough language, sir, said he, remember you are my prisoner; and since fortune gives you no greater tie over your sister's affections, that she will not suffer you to gain your free∣dom, from henceforth you shall be treated like a slave, or like one that has baffled and deluded
<PB N="84" REF="033593_0083_0FF797E5A87EF180"/>
me with false hopes; henceforth I shall find other ways to compass my ends, without your intercession: until to-morrow I have allowed your sister to comply with my desires, which if you can perfect you may both yet be hap∣py. Base man, replied Orsamus, dost thou think thy villainy shall always remain unpun∣ished, and that there is no period set on thy wickedness. This said, he entered into Cyn∣thia's cabin, yet composing all that was fierce and terrible in his looks, where he found the object of his felicity bathing in tears. Why these precious showers, Madam? said he, wherefore the overflowings of grief? is it be∣cause this villain has so confidently set a time to finish his desires? alas! my dear princess, he does but hurry on his own punishment, and set an end unto his villainy; fear not the issue, Madam; but dissipate those cruel apprehen∣sions; for you shall yet be free.</P>
<P>All the time of this discourse Orsamus re∣mained at her feet; but recollecting her spir∣its, taking him by the hand, rise Orsamus, said she, and blame not my griefs since fortune in∣tends to put no period to our misfortunes, nor end to our miseries; she is become cruel with∣out remorse, and pitiless without compassion; if I think of hope, she soon transforms it into dispair, and if I dare imagine I may be more happy, she soon curbs me in that presumption.
<PB N="85" REF="033593_0084_0FF797E738BC1028"/>
If there is no preterminant end set to my mis∣fortunes, why should I expect any longer, and not count death as the last remedy? then blame not the tears I shed in so woful a case, since some fall for Orsamus, and accompany those that drop for Cynthia. Orsamus ravish∣ed at this free and unconstrained answer of Cynthia, and manifestation of her pity, Oh! Madam, said he, how happy do you make me! a thousand such lives as mine spent in thy ser∣vice were but a poor recompence of the least of those precious tears that you shed: Oh rest contented, my dearest princess: I am only safe in your security, and happy in your satisfaction. It is impossible I should be thus fortunate, and yet be unhappy.</P>
<P>In such discourse they passed away their lim∣ited time, till Almerin, with hasty steps made towards the cabin door; which was no sooner perceived by Orsamus, but he made ready for his entertainment. Cynthia persuaded him from an attempt upon his life: but he return∣ed answer, Cease, fair soul, and let me alone, middle ways to such enterprizes are the most dangerous.</P>
<P>By this time Almerin came to the cabin door, which was opened on to him by Orsamus, at his entrance he suddenly disarmed him of his sword with such an impetuous fury, that before he could cry out for help or make the
<PB N="86" REF="033593_0085_0FF797E8D2AF7280"/>
least resistance, he cast him deadly wounded at his feet, "Lie there thou main obstructor of my quiet, said he, take the reward of thy villainy in the grave." Hardly was he fallen on the deck but his amazed spirits returned, being ready to give a farewel to the body; which Orsamus seeing, made ready to give him another blow, so to make a sudden end to that fatal separation, which Almerin perceiv∣ing cried," "Oh, hold your hand! it is e∣nough; I feel my soul is ready to take her flight, and my continuance here will be but a few moments. Oh horrible! still beginning and never ending eternity; now I desire to live because I fear to die; yet I would die because I would be free from the fear of worse to come. Oh happy they that so live, that they may be never afraid to die; to such, death is eternal happiness;—but mine is—another voyage— for my time is at hand, I go away in a mist I know not how;—I can say no more—farewel." At this he gave up the ghost, to the amaze∣ment of Orsamus, and to the terror of Cyn∣thia.</P>
<P>In a moment the glory of the day was over∣cast with black clouds, the wind grew boister∣ous, and the seas turbulent, the resounding echo of the thundering claps were terrible to the hearers; flashes of lightning made the ship seem on fire, with storms of hail and rain; so
<PB N="87" REF="033593_0086_0FF797EA7172A548"/>
that the men made towards Cynthia's cabin, to give notice to their captain to have his ad∣vise; when behold they were amazed at the dismal object presented to their eyes; they saw him wallowing in his own blood at the entrance of the cabin.</P>
<P>This sight was followed with a loud and bit∣ter cry, with lamentations, of many voices; still the storm continued, and their confusion increased until at last recollecting their distrac∣tion, they agreed with one consent to make good their revenge upon Orsamus, who they doubted not had been the murderer of their captain; part they appointed to manage the ship in the storm, while the rest went to sacri∣fice his blood to the ghost of their slain com∣mander. Their resolution was answerable to their design: for the loss of their captain whom they loved so entirely, and in whom they built their future fortunes, had raised their cholor to such a height, that nothing could allay it but his death. This was made manifest in their fierce assault, which was by Orsamus as brave∣ly repulsed; for he had gotten this advantage, that defending himself at the entrance of the cabin door, but one at a time could endanger or hurt him. The combat continued hot on both sides, Orsamus, for the safety of his dear∣est Cynthia, and the pirates their revenge.— Three of the pirates Orsamus had sent to ac∣company
<PB N="88" REF="033593_0087_0FF797EED063D4D0"/>
their captain, neither did he himself escape without wounds. Things were thus stated when the tempest began to assuage, and one from the forecastle began to cry out, A Sail, a Sail. This summons persuaded them to defer their revenge for a time, so that of that great number that assailed him, six only staid as a guard to secure him, fearing, should they engage, he might issue forth and join with the enemy, to their no small disadvantage.</P>
<P>The ship drew nearer, making towards them with full sails before their preparations were in readiness for defence, they were salut∣ed with showers of arrows that seemed to dar∣ken the sky; in a few moments they came to a closer combat and grapple with their ship; then the fight began bloody, and cruel despair made the pirates courageous, so that twice they repulsed them with no small loss: in the third assault they were worsted and their ene∣mies▪ taking advantage of their retreat, slew all, leaving not a man alive, those that guard∣ed Orsamus were fled away, and escaped his hands, but it was only to fall by others; some that were forwardest for plunder and spoil, would have entered Orsamus's cabin, but their lives paid the forfeit of their folly: this occa∣sioned another bickering and drew most part of the conquerors together to behold a resist∣ance so bravely maintained by one man, where
<PB N="89" REF="033593_0088_0FF797F061E74688"/>
eight lay wallowing in their blood yet he made good his defence, thus he continued triumph∣ing in their deaths, while the victorious captain that had boarded the ship was a spectator, and pitying that so much bravery should wither in the bud, he commanded his men to leave assail∣ing him, and drawing something nearer, Gal∣lant man, said he, your courage has gained an esteem in the breast of your enemy; cease this contest, and I promise, you life and liberty.</P>
<P>Your offer is noble, replied Orsamus, nor could it flow but from a breast truly generous; it is not only against your men I have made this resistance, but against the whole strength of this ship before your valour subdued it; the captain lies here a sacrifice, slain by my hand; and nothing could have preserved my life, had not providence directed you hither; yet being my preserver, I dare not deliver my∣self on these terms; not that I doubt the per∣formance of your promise, but I have here within this cabin one whose safety if I cannot secure, I shall little value my own. If you please to let us both share alike in your bounty, and promise to include us both in that noble offer of life and liberty, I will submit myself to your protection; if not, I am ready to make good my defence, with the loss of that life I shall not esteem, without the entire perform∣ance of those articles. Saying this, he put
<PB N="90" REF="033593_0089_0FF797F1F34F0280"/>
himself in a posture of defence. Hold said the captain I will fulfill all thy request; in the King of Kent's name, my royal master, I plight thee my faith. Orsamus remained amazed at this answer, and after some revolutions in his spirit, he replied, ha, King of Kent said you' come and finish what you have begun; for I will never live to see in another's custody what is entirely due to my merit.</P>
<P>Scarce had he uttered these words when an aged man made through the crowd towards him, and with extacy of joy exclaimed, My noble lord Orsamus, living and found here! Heavens, you have satisfied my tedious expect∣ations: and pausing a while with admiration he continued his discourse; Sir, I am not so much lost unto your memory, but you may remember one Willifred. At this Orsamus recollecting himself, crying out, my dear fath∣er, Oh come into this fatal place that I may have happiness in death to die in the defence of two persons that share my soul betwixt them. Oh sir! replied the old man, talk not of death, we come forth in search of you only for safety; that I make all this evident unto you, cease your admiration for a time. This said, and all continuing silent, he proceeded as follows.</P>
<P>Oswald, that famous king of the Northum∣bers, had a brother named Oswain the only
<PB N="91" REF="033593_0090_0FF797F3B81FC088"/>
successor to that great kingdom: he was mar∣ried to a noble lady, by whom he had issue Egfrid the elder, and Orsamus one year young∣er; so that you are not my son, as hitherto you have esteemed yourself. When that fatal bat∣tle of Masterfield was sought by king Penda, the tyrant of Mercia, against your uncle Os∣wald, king of the Northumbers, in which field he was slain, it was uncertain whether Oswain your father, or your elder brother Egfrid had ended their lives at the moment; as soon as tidings were brought of their dismal overthrow, I fled with you, being as then about ten years old, unto the next port town, where I got ship∣ping and escaped to find a more secure sanctu∣ary in another country than our own; but I kept you from the knowledge of yourself; pardon, it was my love that erred, for I did conclude a discovery would be prejudicial.— While we were sailing on the ocean as you well remember, their arose such a tempest, that the skill of the mariners was used in vain; so be∣ing left to the mercy of the sea we were con∣veyed to unknown parts: and about the dawn∣ing of the second day, we discerned land, and before we had time to recollect upon what shore we were cast, we grounded on a rock so that the ship burst into a thousand pieces.

you safely on I left you to the mercy of the sea, while I secured myself on a piece of tim∣ber that came from the broken ship, but mine was driven a contrary course unto that which you went, so that we soon parted to a great distance, that I never saw you since, until this moment. Some time after your father recov∣ered and took possession of his brother's king∣dom, and after I had made a strict enquiry a∣bout the part where I conceived you were lan∣ded and not finding you, I imagined you had paid your life as a tribute unto the unmerciful waves; so that I returned home sorrowful into my own country, and made this relation unto your father, who bitterly lamented your loss; but time at last put your memory into oblivi∣on, when we considered you were not among the living.</P>
<P>Some years had added themselves unto the age of time when same proclaimed in our own country the excellent beauty of Cynthia, daugh∣ter to the king of Kent; so much did the re∣port of this seize your brother Egfrid's affect∣ions, as he desired his father to treat of an al∣liance with the king of Kent by a marriage with his daughter.—His father, that after the report of your death, did prize him as the ap∣ple of his eye, unwilling to cross affection in a cause so just, immediately accorded with his desires and chose me for that embassage▪ so
<PB N="93" REF="033593_0092_0FF77E1156CECA78"/>
that well attended, in a few days I arrived at Doraborina, the regal city of Kent; in a small time I was admitted to a hearing, where I de∣livered the sum of my embassage; hardly had I arrived unto the period of my commands, but with tears in his eyes he began as follow∣eth.</P>
<P>"Sir, some few years ago, when I enjoyed my dearest Cynthia, for now she is not; or if she be, is not to me: in a pleasant morning, before Sol had cast her rays from the moun∣tain tops, she arose to enjoy the variety of the pleasant spring, which Flora had cloathed in her choicest garb; the pearly dew did yet hang on the sweet damask roses, and the infant blossom cast forth a pleasant favour; the wild choristers of the wood made the vallies ring with echo of their delightful notes; while her contemplation was taken up on the musing of these rarities, her curiosity had brought her to a little path, which led towards the sea, which was not far from the place where she was; straying farther, and casting her eyes on the o∣cean, they encountered with an object that at once excited her admiration and pity; she saw a youth about her age, that had secured him∣self on two casks, and with his utmost skill en∣deavoured to gain shore; compassion is never wanting in so tender a breast, nor was it absent from hers; she commanded those men that
<PB N="94" REF="033593_0093_0FF797FB718E95A0"/>
attended with all expedition to make off and save his life, and bring him unto her, having more timerous apprehensions of his safety than at that time needed. Her commands were exactly obeyed, so that by their industry in a few moments they secured him ashore, and weak and feeble as he was presented him be∣fore Cynthia. I remember I was walking in my palace garden when they presented him unto me: Lo here, Sir, said she, taking the youth by the hand with a smile, sweetly inno∣cent, see how fortunate I have been to day by my early rising, to be the preserver of this pretty lad, which, with your consent, I would have to attend on me since it is his de∣sire, to spend his life, so happily preserved, in my service. With this she related where, and how he came into her hands; I staid sometime for an answer, contemplating his behaviour, and sweet becoming graces; me∣thought I saw something in him of majesty. I questioned him of his name and country, to which he gave me this answer, Sir, my name is Orsamus, my father is an aged old man, who I fear perished in the late storm; my country is far hence, in parts unknown to me; and being shipwrecked in the late tempest, he secured my safety upon two casks; many hours I continued on the waves uncertain of life, until I was cast upon this happy shore,
<PB N="95" REF="033593_0094_0FF797FD09A5AE48"/>
and rescued from the jaws of Neptune, by this fair divinity, in whole service I should be too happy were I assured of my dear father's safety. At the period of his discourse he let fall a shower of tears to the memory of so near a loss. We comforted him with the most a∣greeable words we could frame, telling him his mistress would be to him instead of a fath∣er; that if his father were cast upon our coast he should have notice given of his safety. He seemed much satisfied with this discourse, which contentment he expressed in his conte∣nance; for that time he left me, and attended the princess.</P>
<P>"He was already become the darling of the whole court; every day added to his esteem he had already gotten, who all admired such uncommon graces should bud in years so green; he had a solidity that overtoped his age, he was never hardly from Cynthia's eye, nor in∣deed did she desire it; so that he seemed to bound his whole felicity in her service; he waited upon her walks and recreations, but still kept himself about her with a profound re∣verence; he would not prize the dearest good before the least and smallest occasion to please her; he courted all opportunities, time and places, to make it manifest; if she would retire herself into an arbour there would he charm sweet sleep upon her eye lids with delightful
<PB N="96" REF="033593_0095_0FF79800A9EC21C8"/>
music, in which art he was excellent; and while she slept he would remain a careful cen∣tinel. The princess, young as she was, did not bury those services in oblivion, but rated them at their true value in her breast, rewarding all with a grand esteem, which was received by him as a reward of all his merits; he could so sweeten his discourse and action to so near a sympathy, his conversation being so charming and agreeable, that Cynthia was never satisfied when he was absent; as his years increased, he bent his delight to manly exercises, so that ma∣ny times his gallant deportment in publick spec∣tacles drew admiration from all that did behold him.</P>
<P>"His affairs stood thus in court, when my land was suddenly invaded by Cavaline, King of the West-Saxons; I raised an army to op∣pose him, and set forward to meet him; when this young novice, fired with hopes of action, to make trial of his valour, taking opportunity when the princess was alone, he accosted her in this manner: "Madam, I am too happy, in the felicity you have raised me to in being your servant; but now opportunity presents what perchance fortune may never offer a∣gain; your country is invaded by enemies, and I desire your good leave to accompany your father in this expedition, against those Pagans that dare to commit so great a sacrilege;—
<PB N="97" REF="033593_0096_0FF7980341CB7900"/>
where, in the field of honor, I may purchase trophies that may raise me to deserve that esteem you have for me." Cynthia, having a while considered of his request, with an unusual kindness, made this reply. "Yes, Orsamus, you have my free leave to go: nor can I trust you better than with my father; yet it is no small hopes I promise myself, from these early beginnings of your bravery; go then, and be happy, for you shall never want the prayers of your mistress." This said, he attended her to my chamber, where she made known his resolution unto me; nor could I disapprove the gallantry of his mind, but commending his forwardness, gave him con∣sent, ordering him always to be near my per∣son.</P>
<P>"We marched forward by usual journies, to hinder the enemies foraging in the country, until at last we encamped upon a large plain, on the frontiers of my kingdom; here we took the advantage of our ground, and bade the enemy battle; it was first begun by the fore∣runners of our armies, but at last our main body engaged, and the fight became bloody on both sides; victory as yet remained doubt∣ful to which side she would incline; at last, by a violent charge of the enemy, my ranks were broken, my main battle disordered, and, in spite of my guard I was taken prisoner. This
<PB N="98" REF="033593_0097_0FF79804D3C14810"/>
was no sooner understood by Orsamus, but, like a young Mars, he rushed into the midst of the throng, dealing blows with so much bravery, that he soon redeemed me, and in short we became masters of the field.</P>
<P>"But it fortuned soon after, I became the disturber of his quiet, and chief occasion that he left my court. It fell out thus; the East Angles king, my adjoining neighbour, asked Cynthia in marriage for his son Cordelio; my council advised me to grant his request; I con∣descended to their advice, and concluded the marriage with his ambassadors, telling them I would celebrate their nuptials in Doroborino: the Ambassadors returned home, and in a few days after, Cordelio arrived with a great train. The day was appointed to join their hands, all necessaries provided; yet, by a turn of fortune, it came to no effect.</P>
<P>"After this contract of marriage Orsamus became possessed with unusual melancholy! he sought out solitary places wherein to spend his time; a mortal sadness was charactered in all the features of his face: the whole court concerned them in his misfortunes, and my∣self was not the least; I often times demanded of him from whence this change did arise, but he never yielded me any account. This was soon taken notice of by Cynthia, so that being with him alone in the garden walks, How
<PB N="99" REF="033593_0098_0FF798066944B280"/>
now, Orsamus, said she, why these sighs? wherefore is your countenance changed? why have you let yourself fall into a distemper below the knowledge of your mistress? reveal it, that if possible I may procure a remedy.— Yes, said Orsamus, it is only you can yield a remedy; you made me happy only to be un∣fortunate: Oh that I had been buried in the raging ocean! I should have found a resting place in Elizium, and not have died by a second death. Oh Madam! continued he, resolve me, must you be married? Yes, replied Cyn∣thia, it is so decreed: then farewel hopes, con∣tinued Orsamus; now, Madam, you have pro∣vided a remedy, death and despair will soon give period to my life; but because I will ac∣cord with your desires, that your displeasure may hasten on the death I so much desire, know, from the moment you preserved my life, until this time, I have nourished such a passion for your virtues, as will follow my ash∣es to the grave. Seven long years are past since I have concealed this a secret in my bosom; the summer's scorching heat, nor the tedious winter nights, could never work the least change; it was daily nourished by your good∣ness, although innocently, until it came to its full growth; whilst there was the least hope it thrived nor did I ever complain; but to have hope torn up by the roots, to be confined nev∣er
<PB N="100" REF="033593_0099_0FF77E184BCD7818"/>
to see you more, is a cruelty that cannot be borne. Here he continued silent.</P>
<P>Whilst Cynthia remained astonished at his discourse; but at last recovering that assurance she had lost the time of his discourse. "Orsa∣mus? (replied she) is it thus you pay your res∣pects unto me? dare you raise your ambition to the daughter of a king? or could you imag∣ine I would own your pretensions? I am sorry my esteem should be thus lessened by your fol∣ly; or if my intentions or inclinations could lean that way, it is impossible my father should ever consent, whose displeasure I would not gain to obtain the dearest good: to put an end to those dangers that this may occasion for the future, I desire you from henceforth to avoid my presence, since there is only this mean left to cure your malady; while I restrain those in∣nocent familiarities that have disturbed your quiet." Oh Madam! said Orsamus, falling on his knees, mitigate your displeasure—there wanted only this to make me wretched. It is decreed, replied Cynthia, and it behoves you not to dispute it. Then be it so, said Orsa∣mus, to thy cruel sentence will I submit, and henceforth avoid thy presence, however fatal to me may be the separation from her who, thro' pity, preserved my life: may my absence free you from the danger of your father's displeas∣ure;—and if in death I still retain your pity,
<PB N="101" REF="033593_0100_0FF7980A054741E0"/>
then shall my ghost rest quiet in the grave.— He bowed, and left the room.</P>
<P>The absence of Orsamus, soon produced great effects in the breast of Cynthia; discon∣tent seated herself on her brow, the carnation of her cheeks began to abate, and the lillies be∣gan to possess their places; having demanded the reason of those sudden effects, she inform∣ed me of the particulars that had fallen out be∣twixt Orsamus and herself, and the occasion of his absence. Sir, said she, see the resolution of this unfortunate youth occasioned by one has∣ty word; which I fear will destroy what I so happily preserved, although his audacious re∣vealing of his love were an offence, it was not of that degree to call his life in question. Shall I tell you, from whom I do not conceal my greatest secrets; had Orsamus's love been au∣thorised by your free consent, I would have cho∣sen him out of the stock of mankind; nor can I much offend in loving one that has been the preserver of your life and kingdom.</P>
<P>I could not much gainsay, what she had said, for Orsamus's virtues were so well grounded in my breast, that oftentimes I have had thot's to his advantage, tending that way; but, as things were now stated, I durst not make my concerns known unto Cynthia. The marriage day drew near, and Cordelio waited the con∣firmation of his nuptials, so that I could not go
<PB N="102" REF="033593_0101_0FF7980C748DFEA8"/>
back from promise without provoking the East Angles King to be my enemy. This consid∣eration caused me to cloud my countenance with a frown: Fy, Cynthia, replied I, forget this man, one of so low condition; were his birth any ways correspondent to thine, I think I should have accorded with thy desires, had I known it before this contract with Cordelio; but this has proceeded so far, that the deferring of it would endanger my whole kingdom.— Banish this miserable man from thy memory, and obey the commands of thy father and king. She made no reply, but with a low sub∣mission seemed to consent with what I desired, and left me. After her departure, I sent spies throughout my kingdom to search for Orsa∣mus, and bring him back: my discontents came little short of Cynthia's, for I could not endure the absence of him to whose valour I was so much obliged. My servants at length returned without bringing the least intelligence of Orsamus; this added fresh grief to Cyn∣thia; and shunning those amusements which might have dispelled her melancholy, she was soon reduced to an object of compassion. I beheld this vicissitude with sorrow, and gladly would have procured a remedy. The day of marriage fast approached, and being unwilling at such a time she should be wholly made up of sorrow, I caused a stately banquet
<PB N="103" REF="033593_0102_0FF7980E0910A5F0"/>
to be prepared in my garden adjoining the sea environed by an unfrequented wood. It was here I recreated myself when my business at court would permit my absence; and thither I came with Cynthia, attended by Cordelio and a numerous train. We had ended our ban∣quet, and separated to participate of various pleasures. Cordelio remained with me, and Cynthia, accompanied by her usual attendants, directed her walk to that part of the garden a∣butting the sea; as she approached the bounds of the garden she cautioned her servants to keep at a distance: these commands were com∣mon, and always obeyed. She had retired an hour, when becoming anxious for her safety, they ventured to break her commands, and resolved to follow her into the wood: but bet∣ter reason induced them first to give me notice, as the turnings were so intricate, that, being once entered, they might sooner lose themselves than recover their absent mistress. We then dispersed into all parts of the wood; scarce a thicket was left untraced; night approached, and we had almost despaired of finding her, when it was Cordelio's fortune to discover her sitting alone. He had but just seated himself by her side, when Orsamus issued from a neigh∣boring thicket and cast himself at her feet. So changed was his countenance, that he remain∣ed unknown to Cynthia until he complained
<PB N="104" REF="033593_0103_0FF7980FCB436C40"/>
of her cruelty. Amazed at his sad appearance, she was unable to reply. He became despe∣rate; drew his sword, and resolved to sacrifice his own life to his love, and the life of Cordel∣io to his revenge. Cordelio was falling a sac∣rifice, when his attendants flew to his assist∣ance; they instantly assaulted him, and altho' by his bravery he slew five of the stoutest, yet no doubt they would have put a period to his life, had not a strange turn of fortune preserv∣ed him—From a small creek issued sixteen pi∣rates, at the sight of which they that assaulted Orsamus fled; but he made good his defence against them. Too late I had news of this, for when I came to the place, nothing was to be seen but half a score of men lying dead on the ground. Among those there was one who began to recover, and by assistance was soon brought to his senses, to whom I promised life, on condition that he gave me a true relation what they were: He began as followeth:</P>
<P>My country is the Ocean, and the command∣er of these men with whom I came a shore is Almerin the famous rover; under his conduct 16 of us came ashore, and were bravely repuls∣ed by one single man, who made good his de∣fence against us all, for the preserving of a lady who lay senseless on the ground; three of my companions besides myself lay grovling in their blood at his feet, which sight incensed Alme∣rin
<PB N="105" REF="033593_0104_0FF798125D21A828"/>
to a speedy revenge, that they rushed up∣on him with such force that it seemed impos∣sible he should make any longer resistance; in fine, they seized him, and conveyed both him and the lady aboard our vessel.</P>
<P>Scarce had he uttered these words, when casting my eyes towards the Ocean I beheld the ship that contained all my worldly joys, going before the wind with full sails. I gave orders to several vessels to follow this pirate; but all things agreed to further his escape. The night became exceeding dark, and there arose a mighty storm, so that he was conveyed to un∣known parts, far from my own country. This, Sir, is one reason I cannot accord with your master's desires; and the other is, were she here I could not without breach of honor break my promise to Cordelio."</P>
<P>Here, continued Willifred, the king ended his story, which I hearkened unto with aston∣ishment; at last recollecting my spirits, Sir, replied I, before I proceed, tell me one thing truly, I see you prize Orsamus's virtues at their full value, should his birth be as illustrious as his virtues, would you deny him your daught∣er in marriage. Would I? replied the king— could I be so fortunate, his person and merits, would be the first to gain my breast. I was much satisfied at the freeness of his discourse, and returned to him this answer, Know, Sir,
<PB N="106" REF="033593_0105_0FF79815D1B737A0"/>
Orsamus is of royal blood, second son to my master, the king of Northumbers, by casualty shipwrecked on your coast; I gave a relation of what already you have heard, and told him I would return to my master, to give him in∣telligence of those many strange adventures, from whence I would set out with a ship well manned in pursuit of the pirate.</P>
<P>He seemed highly pleased at what I propos∣ed, and speedily fitted out the ship we are now in, dispatching this noble commander to assist in the recovery of his daughter. The wind blowing fair we put off from shore, and gave farewel to the king. In fine, we had a nim∣ble passage into our own country, where I land∣ed, and gave your father an account of your fate. Your father rejoiced much at the hope of your safety, according with the king of Kent in all his requests; for they were equally con∣cerned in each others disasters.</P>
<P>Hardly were commands issued for a prepa∣ration, but a ship that came into our harbour brought news that Almerin was off at sea, and that they narrowly escaped his hands; this opportunity would admit of no delay, which this brave captain conceiving, hastened our departure; in a moment the ship was strongly manned with our own men, who freely offered their lives to redeem their prince; myself, tho' age would have excused it, accompanied
<PB N="107" REF="033593_0106_0FF79817617DBEE8"/>
this noble man, the thought of your welfare extinguishing the imagination of my own dan∣ger; thus we made off to sea, accompanied with one ship more, which was severed from us in the late storm. Four days had not yet pass∣ed since I left my own country, in which time heaven had been so kind to make us your pre∣server! Now what remains but that we return to your father.</P>
<P>This discourse being ended, Orsamus and Cynthia left the cabin, whose beauty was the admiration of all that did behold her, and claimed obedience as a tribute from all hearts; and the respects there shewn her were not in∣ferior to those she received in her father's court. After a short consultation, it was resol∣ved to stear for Northumberland; the ships were then cleared; Almerin's body, with the rest, was committed to the waves, and this was the miserable end of that wretched man.</P>
<P>A fair and pleasant gale soon wasted them to their native shore, where being arrived, they made themselves known to the king, who was almost ravished with joy at the sight of his long lost son; his brother caressed him, his friends welcomed him, nor could there be a parallel to his entertainment. Cynthia had such respects paid her as were peculiar to so rare a creature; such deep impressions can virtue make on no∣ble minds. Because they would not disturb
<PB N="108" REF="033593_0107_0FF7981909CA8FB0"/>
their happiness by a sudden journey, they sent a messenger to the king of Kent, to certify him of his daughter's safety, and to give him advice, that in a few days time Oswin would be with him in Doroborina, accompanied with his too sons, and his fair daughter Cynthia, to celebrate Orsamus's nuptials; the messenger was received with all joy and respect, prepa∣rations were made on all parts for a triumphant entrance; at the time limited Oswin came and was received with acclamations of joy. They had a splendid attendance to the palace, where Cynthia threw herself into her father's arms, and they embraced with tears of mutual glad∣ness. The marriage was deferred no longer than the next week, when Orsamus received Cynthia from the hands of the old king, as the best reward of his services and valour. They lived in felicity, and, as a cruel winter makes a lovely spring, so the adversity through which they had passed, added to their new scenes of pleasure.</P>
