<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE ensuing epistolary poems contain a description rather of passions than of incidents. They resulted from an idea of it being possible to unite the impassion'd fondness of <HI>POPE'S</HI> ELOISA, with the chaster tenderness of <HI>PRIOR'S</HI> EMMA; avoiding the voluptuousness of the first, and the too conceding softness of the second. It is hoped the Reader will distinguish between the apprehended possibility of exhibit∣ing in verse a more faultless female Character than the EL∣OISA of <HI>POPE,</HI> or the EMMA of <HI>PRIOR,</HI> and the rash and vain design of equalling, much less of surpassing the transcend∣ent poetic excellence of either of those Compositions.</P>
<P><HI>THE</HI> LOUISA of the following pages has all that enthusiasm which springs from an heart warmly affectionate, joined to a glowing and picturesque imagination. Her sensibilities, heightened, and refined in the bosom of Retirement, know no bounds, except those which the dignity of conscious Worth, and a strong sense of Religion prescribe. It is feared the mo∣dern young Ladies will have little sympathy with her, since she is unfashionably enthusiastic, and unfashionably tender.</P>
<P><HI>AN</HI> ingenious Friend, after reading the first epistle, re∣marked, that LOUISA might have described with more inter∣esting particularity her Lover's declaration of his passion, and the manner in which she received that declaration; but the Author thought the present method of conveying that circum∣stance to the mind of the Reader more poetic. <HI>POPE'S</HI> ELO∣ISA is minute in her description of the awful Scenery, for∣med by the rocks, the streams, and mountains, of Para∣clete,
<PB REF="022137_0004_0FB6CB460BA28BD0"/>
but by no means minute concerning the amorous eclair∣cissement between herself and Abelard. LOUISA discrimi∣nates her Lover's early attentions to her, tho' she leaves the manner of his declaring their source very much to the Imagi∣nation. Her application of the beautiful scenic objects, by which she was at that interval surrounded, to her own, and to her Lover's situation; and the possing sud∣denly to their present altered appearance, contrasts the charms, and bloom of the first, with the chill drearness of the second. There it was that the Author had in view that striking letter in the 3d Vol. of the Nouvelle-Heloise, which describes St. Preaux accompanying Mrs. Wolmar to the rocks of Meillerie, then covered with the richness of Summer-luxuriance; and painting to her the situation of that very Scene, when he had visited it alone, amidst the horrors of Winter, and found those horrors congenial to the temper of his Soul.</P>
<P><HI>THIS</HI> Poem has little chance to be popular. A feeling Heart, and a fondness for Verse must <HI>unite</HI> to render it inter∣esting. A feeling Heart without a glowing Imagination will be tired of the Landscape-painting, somewhat luxuriantly in∣terspersed. An Imagination that glows, while the Heart is frozen, has a propensity to fancy every thing prosaic which is not imagery, and will probably yawn over the reasoning of these Lovers, and sicken over their tenderness.</P>
<P><HI>IF,</HI> however, this little Work has the honor to interest and please the Few, in whom the kind and sweet affections are
<PB REF="022137_0005_0FB6CB479B559AB8"/>
blended with poetic taste, the end for which it is published will be obtained.</P>
<P><HI>EXCEPT</HI> some slight alterations, which have been made since the two first Editions, the hundred and fifty six lines, with which the poem opens, were written when the Author was only nineteen. They had been mislaid during a long in∣terval, It is sixteen months since they were accidentally recovered. Some few Friends, to whom the Fragment was shewn, thought it worth being extended into a regular Work The first, and third of these epistles are designed to be descrip∣tive, and sentimental; the second, and last, dramatic.</P>

<HEAD>LOUISA TO EMMA, HER FRIEND IN THE EAST-INDIES</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>OCTOBER 21, 1779.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<LG>
<L>THEE, EMMA, four slow-circling years have seen</L>
<L>Press, with thy pensive foot, Savannas green;</L>
<L>Seen thee, with fond Affection's moisten'd gaze,</L>
<L>And the low-warbled song of former days,</L>
<L>Wind round the shadowy Rock, and shelving Glade,</L>
<L>Where broad Bananas stretch their grateful shade;</L>
<L>Bend o'er the West thy longing eyes and chide</L>
<L>The tardy Breeze that fans th' unfreighted Tide.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, as with filial care thy light step roves,</L>
<L>Thro' India's palmy plains, and spicy groves,</L>
<L>To bless thee, exil'd thus in Youth's gay prime,</L>
<L>May sprightly Health resist the torrid clime,</L>
<L>Temper the sickly blast, the sever'd ray,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="022137_0007_0FB6CB534AF3AE30"/>And Peace, and Pleasure, lead the shining Day!</L>
<L>Yet, when thou know'st for me, that Sorrow shrouds</L>
<L>Hope's crystal mirror with impervious clouds,</L>
<L>The sighs, and tears, that tenderest pity speak,</L>
<L>Shall swell thy breast, and chill thy glowing cheek;</L>
<L>Since one have been our pleasures, one our cares,</L>
<L>From the first dawn of those delicious years,</L>
<L>What time, inspir'd by joy's enlivening powers,</L>
<L>We chas'd the gilded infect thro' the bowers,</L>
<L>And oh! I fondly tell my anxious heart,</L>
<L>The dearest truth experience can impart,</L>
<L>That yet, to quench this sympathy of soul,</L>
<L>Time, and the world of waters, vainly roll.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O'er this deep Glen, departing Autumn throws,</L>
<L>With kind reverted glance, a short repose,</L>
<L>E'er yet she leaves her ENGLAND's fading scene,</L>
<L>Where sickly yellow stains the vivid green,</L>
<L>And many an icy morn, and stormy gale</L>
<L>Embrown the pathway of the winding vale.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now, while I seek the bosom of the Glade,</L>
<L>And the thin shelter of th' impoverish'd Shade,</L>
<L>Unequal steps, and rising sighs, disclose</L>
<L>The thorny pressure of tyrannic woes;</L>
<L>And where th' incumbant Rock, with awful face,</L>
<L>Bends o'er the fountain, gurgling from its base,</L>
<L>And marks the limit of the silent Dell,</L>
<L>Sadly I sit my bosom'd griefs to tell;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="022137_0008_0FB6CB544BB29930"/>Invoke thy Spirit, those fond griefs to sooth,</L>
<L>And bid, alas! their surging tide be smooth.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It will not be;—since here, with yearning thought,</L>
<L>By weak, involuntary impulse brought,</L>
<L>Where Love and Memory bear resistless sway,</L>
<L>And all the weakness of the Soul betray!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O Ye known objects!—how ye strike my heart!</L>
<L>And vain regrets, with keener force, impart!</L>
<L>Slow, thro' the faded grove, past Pleasures glide,</L>
<L>Or sadly linger by the fountain's side.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Dear, awful witness of a broken vow,</L>
<L>Steep Rock, how sternly frowns thy rugged brow!</L>
<L>But, if the frequent blast shall bend thy pines,</L>
<L>Clear at thy foot the crystal water shines!</L>
<L>Tho' drizzling Clouds the misty Mountains veil,</L>
<L>Yet the mild Sun-beam gilds the narrow Dale!</L>
<L>Tho' vernal flow'rs this bank no more adorn,</L>
<L>Nor Summer's wild rose blushes on its thorn,</L>
<L>Yet shelter'd, mossy, dry, and warm, it draws</L>
<L>The heedless roving step to quiet pause.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus the pale Year, tho' Nature's edicts urge</L>
<L>Her step to Winter's desolating verge,</L>
<L>Sedately passes to the drear domain,</L>
<L>And breathes, e'en yet, soft comforts o'er the plain;</L>
<L>But oh! for me, in Youth's luxuriant glow,</L>
<L>Hope's lovely florets wither as they blow!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="022137_0009_0FB6CB5F170854F0"/>
<L>No grief my bosom at our parting knew,</L>
<L>But that of bidding thee a long adieu;</L>
<L>And the sweet tears, that such soft sorrows bring,</L>
<L>Fall, as light rain-drops in the sunny Spring;</L>
<L>For youthful Hope, subduing tender Fears,</L>
<L>Bounds o'er the gulf of interposing Years;</L>
<L>While, thro' their course, her airy hands avert</L>
<L>Misfortune's arrow from the Wanderer's heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Soon then did Cheerfulness the morn illume,</L>
<L>And Peace descend with Evening's grateful gloom;</L>
<L>They saw my breast in that clear spirit gay,</L>
<L>Which speeds the social hour so fast away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now Expectation's fervour rose, to hail</L>
<L>The youthful Master of this quiet Vale,</L>
<L>My blooming Brother—from Oxonia's towers,</L>
<L>Who sought, with tender haste, his native bowers.</L>
<L>'Twas Noon, and ripen'd Summer's fervid ray</L>
<L>From cloudless Ether shed oppressive day.</L>
<L>As on this shady bank I sat reclin'd,</L>
<L>My voice, that floated on the waving wind,</L>
<L>Taught the soft echos of the neighboring plains</L>
<L>Milton's sweet lays, in Handel's matchless strains.</L>
<L>Presaging notes my lips unconscious try,</L>
<L>And murmur—"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An enchanting Song of Handel's, from Milton's II Penseroso.</NOTE> Hide me from Day's garish eye!</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="022137_0010_0FB6CB60660E7E20"/>Ah! blest, had Death beneath his sable shrine</L>
<L>Hid me from all the woes that since were mine!</L>
<L>Beneath my trembling fingers lightly rung</L>
<L>The Lute's sweet chords, responsive while I sung.</L>
<L>Faint in the yellow broom the Oxen lay,</L>
<L>And the mute Birds sat languid on the spray;</L>
<L>And nought was heard, around the noon-tide bower,</L>
<L>Save, that the mountain Bee, from flower to flower,</L>
<L>Seem'd to prolong, with her assiduous wing,</L>
<L>The soft vibration of the tuneful string;</L>
<L>While the fierce Skies flam'd on the shrinking Rills,</L>
<L>And sultry Silenc brooded o'er the hills!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As on my lip the lingering cadence play'd,</L>
<L>My Brother gaily bounded down the glade,</L>
<L>And, while my looks the fire of gladness dart,</L>
<L>With ardor press'd me to his throbbing heart;</L>
<L>Then to a graceful Stranger turn'd, whose feet,</L>
<L>With steps less swift, my coyer welcome meet.</L>
<L>O'er his fine form, and o'er his glowing face,</L>
<L>Youth's ripen'd bloom had shed its richest grace;</L>
<L>Tall as the Pine, amidst inferior Trees,</L>
<L>With all the bending Ozier's pliant ease.</L>
<L>O'er his fair brow, the fairer for their shade,</L>
<L>Locks of the warmest brown luxurient play'd.</L>
<L>Blushing he bows!—and gentle awe supplies</L>
<L>Each slattering meaning to his downcast eyes;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="022137_0011_0FB6CB61CB59F5C8"/>Sweet, Serious, tender, those blue eyes impart</L>
<L>A thousand dear sensations to the heart;</L>
<L>Mild as the Evening Star whose shining ray</L>
<L>Soft in th' unruffled Water seems to play;</L>
<L>And when he speaks—not Music's thrilling pow'r,</L>
<L>No, not the vocal Mistress of the bow'r,</L>
<L>When slow she warbles from the blossom'd spray,</L>
<L>In liquid blandishment, her evening lay,</L>
<L>Such soft insinuating sweetness knows,</L>
<L>As from that voice in melting accent flows!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet why, fond Memory! why, in tints so warm,</L>
<L>Paint'st thou each beauty of that faultless Form?</L>
<L>His specious virtues surely might impart</L>
<L>Excuse more just for this devoted heart.</L>
<L>Oh! how each noble passion's seeming trace,</L>
<L>Threw transient glories o'er his youthful face!</L>
<L>How rose, with sudden impulse, swift, and strong,</L>
<L>For ev'ry secret fraud, and open wrong</L>
<L>Th' Oppressor acts, the Helpless feel, or fear,</L>
<L>Disdain's quick throb, and Pity's melting tear!</L>
<L>So well its part each ductile feature play'd,</L>
<L>Of worth, such firm, tho' silent promise made,</L>
<L>That to have doubted its well painted truth,</L>
<L>Had been to want the primal grace of youth</L>
<L>Credulity, that scorns, with gen'rous heat,</L>
<L>Alike to practice; or suspect deceit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="022137_0012_0FB6CB6B462B44F8"/>
<L>Cease, vain Regrets, excursive Fancy cease▪</L>
<L>Ye only wound afresh my bleeding peace,</L>
<L>And keep from gentle EMMA's anxious ear</L>
<L>Th' event she longs, yet kindly dreads, to hear;</L>
<L>But ah! nor singular, nor strange the tale,</L>
<L>My Sister-Sufferers mourn in every vale;</L>
<L>For gold, and dazzling state, incessant prove,</L>
<L>In Man's hard heart, the Murderers of Love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While many a Sun in summer-glory rose,</L>
<L>EUGENIO's lip no softer accent knows</L>
<L>Than Friendship dictates—but disorder'd praise,</L>
<L>Scarce half express'd; the musing ardent gaze;</L>
<L>The varying cheek; the frequent smother'd sigh,</L>
<L>Reveal the latent meaning of his eye;</L>
<L>Plain, and yet plainer ev'ry hour, declare</L>
<L>The shining secrecies, that languish there.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>These are the days that fly on Rapture's wing,</L>
<L>Empurpling ev'ry flower that decks the Spring;</L>
<L>For when delicious Hope, with whisper bland,</L>
<L>Wakes the dear magic of her potent wand,</L>
<L>More vivid colours paint the rising Morn,</L>
<L>And clearer chrystial gems the silver thorn;</L>
<L>On more luxuriant shade the Noon-beam plays,</L>
<L>And richer gold the Evening-Sun arrays;</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="022137_0013_0FB6CB6C4E3D91A0"/>Stars seem to glitter with enamour'd fire,</L>
<L>And shadowy Hills in statelier grace aspire;</L>
<L>More subtle sweetness scents the passing gales,</L>
<L>And softer beauty decks the moon-light Vales;</L>
<L>All nature smiles! nor e'en the jocund Day,</L>
<L>When festal roses strew the bridal way,</L>
<L>Darts thro' the Virgin breast such keen delight,</L>
<L>As when soft Fears with gay Belief unite;</L>
<L>As Hope, sweet, warm, seducing Hope inspires,</L>
<L>Which somewhat questions, what it most desires;</L>
<L>Reads latent meaning in a Lover's eye,</L>
<L>Thrills at his glance, and trembles at his sigh;</L>
<L>As o'er the Frame disorder'd transport pours,</L>
<L>When only less than Certainty is ours.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At length, that rosy Certainty appears,</L>
<L>With faithless promises of golden years.</L>
<L>Here, by this fountain side, EUGENIO strove</L>
<L>To trace the tender progress of his love;</L>
<L>'Twas on the Evening of a splendid Day;—</L>
<L>Calm on the gilded grass the fountain lay!</L>
<L>But oh! when doubt, in that dear moment fled,</L>
<L>A calm more suny o'er my bosom spread!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As the gay Lark his last clear rarol sung,</L>
<L>And on a slanting Sun-beam warbling hung,</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="022137_0014_0FB6CB6E04746950"/>With sweeter music trill'd the vesper lay,</L>
<L>Than when he soar'd amid the blaze of Day;</L>
<L>But yet a thousand times more sweet the sound,</L>
<L>In which my Soul its dearest blessing found!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Slow on the Sun had stol'n the sailing Cloud,</L>
<L>And drawn o'er his gay fires the purple shroud,</L>
<L>Then roll'd away!—till, by no shade represt,</L>
<L>Afar the setting Orb emblaz'd the West;</L>
<L>Lighted with arrowy beams the Ocean caves,</L>
<L>And sunk with splendor in the iliumin'd waves!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus oft would Modesty her blush employ,</L>
<L>Coyly to veil the radiance of my joy;</L>
<L>But from these eyes the sun-bright gladness beam'd,</L>
<L>And all the triumph of my bosom stream'd!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas here,—e'en here!—where now I sit reclined,</L>
<L>And Winter's sighs sound hollow in the Wind;</L>
<L>Loud, and more loud the blast of Evening raves,</L>
<L>And strips the Oaks of their last, lingering leaves;</L>
<L>The eddying foliage in the tempest flies,</L>
<L>And fills with duskier gloom the thickning Skies.</L>
<L>Red sinks the Sun, behind the howling Hill,</L>
<L>And rushes, with hoarse stream, the mountain Rill,</L>
<L>And now, with ruffling billow, cold, and pale,</L>
<L>Runs, swoln, and dashing, down the lonely Vale;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="022137_0015_0FB6CB779A47E3D8"/>While, to these tear-ful eyes, Grief's faded form,</L>
<L>Sits on the Cloud, and sighs amid the Storm!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet, dreary Vale! detain thy pensive Guest,</L>
<L>Tho' drizzling sleet beats cold upon her breast!</L>
<L>To this sad Soul more welcome are thy glooms,</L>
<L>Than Spring's green bowers, or Summer's gaudy blooms;</L>
<L>Nor asks an Heart, that only breaths to sigh,</L>
<L>A warmer mansion, or a kinder Sky!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And still that destin'd Heart, so fond to mourn,</L>
<L>And dwell on scenes, which never can return,</L>
<L>Shrinks, e'en as guilty bosoms shrink from shame,</L>
<L>To join with <HI>perfidy</HI> EUGENIO's name;</L>
<L>Feels its soft streams in ev'ry pulse recede</L>
<L>From the pain'd mention of one barborous deed,</L>
<L>That kills my hopes, like Eurus' fierce career</L>
<L>On the bright foliage of the early year;</L>
<L>Which turns, while premature its buds disclose,</L>
<L>To livid yellowness the damask Rose.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thou see'st, my EMMA with what fond delay</L>
<L>Th' unwilling Spirit loiters on her way;</L>
<L>Clings to past scenes that wore gay Summer's form;</L>
<L>Clings to the wildness of the wintry Storm,</L>
<L>To stop the sad narration, e'er it throw,</L>
<L>Dark on my fate, the long, long night of Woe,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="11" REF="022137_0016_0FB6CB7912B24528"/>
<L>Yet, O my Soul! resume it; e'er the power</L>
<L>Of wasting Sickness brings the fever'd Hour,</L>
<L>That stops th' ill-guided pen in the weak hand,</L>
<L>And shakes from Life's dim glass the ebbing sand!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thou, EMMA. wilt not blame my easy youth,</L>
<L>That soon this Heart declar'd its tenderest truth.</L>
<L>Ah! could I dream he feign'd whose glances warm</L>
<L>With ceaseless ardor wander'd o'er my form?</L>
<L>And as gay smiles, and youthful graces fair,</L>
<L>Shone in my eyes, and harmoniz'd my air,</L>
<L>Not one unheeded pass'd his eager gaze,</L>
<L>His fervent, yet discriminating praise;</L>
<L>Tho' oft he swore, amid the fond survey,</L>
<L>The Mind they grac'd was lovelier far than they,</L>
<L>Protested oft, that Mind was form'd to share</L>
<L>Each high-soul'd purpose, and each virtuous care;</L>
<L>Catch ev'ry new idea, as it rose,</L>
<L>Partake his joys, and melt with all his woes;</L>
<L>False could I think that vow, whose starting tear</L>
<L>Sprung, the warm witness of a faith sincere?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now dawn'd th' appointed, but unwelcome Day,</L>
<L>That bore my dearest Brother far away,</L>
<L>Where foreign Climes might store his ripening Youth,</L>
<L>With Observation, Science, Taste and Truth.</L>
<L>The same sad Day my lov'd EUGENIO sigh'd</L>
<L>Adieus impassion'd to his promis'd Bride;</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="022137_0017_0FB6CB7A9E750328"/>Yet often urg'd, inspiring faithless ease,</L>
<L>That between <HI>us</HI> Fate spread no cruel <HI>Seas</HI>;</L>
<L>Alas! in his chang'd Heart my eyes explore,</L>
<L>Of Falsehood's waves,—a Sea,— without a Shore!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where Thames expands with Freedom's wealthy pride,</L>
<L>Attractive Commerce calls him to her Tide;</L>
<L>As with firm step she runs along the Strand,</L>
<L>And points, to the tall Ship, the distant Land.</L>
<L>His rising interests on the call attend,</L>
<L>For with a Father's prosperous fate they blend.</L>
<L>Thus, with these interests, Duty's filial power</L>
<L>Unites to tear him from LOUISA's bower;</L>
<L>But parting Sorrows yield them to the force</L>
<L>Of strong Necessity's resistless course,</L>
<L>By generous Confidence when lull'd to rest,</L>
<L>That broods, on dove-like pinion o'er the breast;</L>
<L>While, from kind letters, rays of joy pervade</L>
<L>The gloomy moments of the love sick Maid;</L>
<L>And oh! how warm, how bright those letters glow'd,</L>
<L>What ardent Love, in melting language flow'd,</L>
<L>My dearest EMMA, thou wilt ne'er explore;</L>

<L>Pride, Virgin-Pride, pronounc'd the stern behest,</L>
<L>And tore the faithless Scriptures from my breast!</L>

<L>Thro' four sweet months, to my delighted eyes</L>
<L>These precious tablets of my bliss arise!</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="022137_0018_0FB6CB84AB29CA18"/>At length, dread Silence,—torturing Doubt, and Fear,</L>

<L>Veil'd to thy sense in perfidy and shame!</L>
<L>Oh? deep indeed the mists, they long have spread,</L>
<L>To Fancy's eye, round this devoted head!</L>
<L>While deeper still the shades of anguish lower,</L>

<L>Burst the dark consines of disastrous Life,</L>
<L>Given, or with-held, by EMMA's guardian hands,</L>
<L>As her Friend's peace hereafter best demands,</L>
<L>Will she receive EUGENIO's last request,</L>
<L>In faithful trust for her LOUISA's breast,</L>
<L>Hear his sad story —that yet dares appear</L>
<L>To claim her justice, and implore her tear?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If so, let now thy gentle heart incline</L>
<L>To mourn the trials, and the pangs of mine!</L>
<L>No longer shalt thou think I basely sold</L>
<L>My peace, my liberty, my love, for gold;</L>
<L>That gold did purchase them, we know too well,</L>

<L>To thee, so long accustom'd to disclose</L>
<L>Whate'er on Life the strengthen'd colour throws,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Veil'd by her native Groves, I left the Maid,</L>
<L>And journied onward from that blooming Glade,</L>
<L>With eyes, full oft reverted as I pass'd,</L>
<L>With many a look to Heaven in fervor cast,</L>
<L>To implore protection for LOUISA's peace,</L>
<L>Her health's dear safety, and our love's increase.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>E'er yet I join'd the animated Train,</L>
<L>Whose full-fraught vessels seek the ports of Gain,</L>
<L>To that domestic scene I bent my way,</L>
<L>Which far in <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The River Deva, celebrated by Milton, and other of our Poets, rises in Merionethshire, and flows thro' mountainous and beautiful scenery, still, as it is said, retaining its origi∣nal name. In Cheshire it assumes that of Dee, which led some of the commentators on the first Edition of this Poem to sup∣pose the villa of Ernesto in that country; but the author meant to place it in Wales, on the banks of the Deva, before it changes its title for one so much less harmonious, and wa∣ters a country more fertile, but much less lovely.</NOTE> Deva's woodland mazes lay;</L>
<L>A rural kind Retreat from all the cares,</L>
<L>Which busy Commerce for her Sons prepares.</L>
<L>Translucent Deva the green Valley laves,</L>
<L>And darkling Alders screen her wandering waves,</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="022137_0028_0FB6CBAF0B24AD28"/>Till slow she rises from o'er-hanging shades,</L>
<L>And, seen at distance, thro' the opening Glades,</L>
<L>With bank less veild'd, and streams that mildly shine,</L>
<L>Leads round the lonely Hills her silver line.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In that sweet Dale, and by a Mountain's side,</L>
<L>Whose sheltering heights the angry North deride,</L>
<L>Abode, so late, of Cheerfulness and Ease,</L>
<L>White gleams the Mansion thro' the waving Trees!</L>
<L>Tall are the Trees that whisper round its Walls,</L>
<L>And soft the pathway down the Valley falls!</L>
<L>Oh! how each charm, that decks the quiet scene,</L>
<L>Assum'd new grace, and wore a softer mein,</L>
<L>From the blest thought, that soon the nuptial Hour</L>
<L>Would lead LOUISA to my native bower!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas there my gentle Parents often knew</L>
<L>The calm sweet Night, the Day that lightly flew;</L>
<L>And there the heart-felt pleasure gaily shew'd</L>
<L>EUGENIO's welcome to the green abode,</L>
<L>A father's elevating gladness proved</L>
<L>How dear the presence of the Son he loved.</L>
<L>My gentle Mother, archly smiling, prest</L>
<L>The love-sick Wanderer to her honor'd breast;</L>
<L>For so she fondly call'd her darling Youth,</L>
<L>Yet lov'd his ardor, and approv'd his truth.</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="022137_0029_0FB6CBB04271DAC0"/>My Sisters, fair, ingenuous, graceful Maids,</L>
<L>Th' acknowledg'd pride of all the neighbouring Shades,</L>
<L>Met me with bounding step, and joyous mein,</L>
<L>And rays of transport brightened all the scene</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor wilt thou, mighty Love! upbraid my Heart,</L>
<L>For bearing in their joys so warm a part;</L>
<L>Since no ambition gloom'd my Father's brow,</L>
<L>No third of wealth reproach'd my plighted vow;</L>
<L>He scorn'd to name LOUISA's want of gold,</L>
<L>But gladly listened while her worth I told.</L>
<L>Pleas'd has he seen her in this melting eye,</L>
<L>Pleas'd with her name, half whispered in a sigh;</L>
<L>Then would I grasp his hand, and ardent say,</L>
<L>"Oft shall my Parents bless our bridal Day,</L>
<L>"Since from that Soul of sweetness, they shall share</L>
<L>"A Daughter's tenderness, an Angel's care;</L>
<L>"For her's each virtue and each Grace refin'd,</L>
<L>"That breathe on Loveliness the glow of Mind,</L>
<L>"And, with assiduous Duty's cheering pow'r,</L>
<L>"Strew Life's worn path with ev'ry filial flow'r."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>One Eve, as on the shady bank I rode,</L>
<L>Where thro' new Dales the beauteous Deva slow'd,</L>
<L>Loitering I listen to the Red-breast clear,</L>
<L>The last, lone Songster of the waining Year.</L>

<L>The glowing raiments of the vanish'd Sun;</L>
<L>Nor yet the deepning shades of Night impede</L>
<L>My roving course, which pensive musings lead,</L>
<L>What time the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Moon of Ceres, the Harvest Moon.</NOTE> Moon of Ceres mildly throws</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sudden, wild sound; are borne along the gales;</L>
<L>The piercing shriek my startled ear assails!</L>

<L>And plunging thro' the deep, opposing flood,</L>

<L>Appal a guilty band of desperate Slaves;</L>
<L>For soon, in ruthless, felon-gripe, I found</L>
<L>A beautious Female, screaming on the ground;</L>
<L>Dragg'd from her Horse, that graz'd unconscious near,</L>
<L>Her tresses torn, and frantic with her fear.</L>
<L>Two livered Youths, attendant on the Maid,</L>
<L>At the first onset in that gloomy Glade,</L>
<L>Had, or seduced by Gold, or Wing' by dread,</L>
<L>From danger, and from duty, coward fled.</L>

<L>Yet no cold fear arrests my vengeful force,</L>

<L>With one demoniac glance, as down he fell.</L>
<L>The Soul starts furious from its vital cell.</L>

<LG>
<L>Then tender pity, and assiduous care,</L>

<L>Till Life's warm tide, which long the Heart detains,</L>
<L>Returns, slow purpling the forsaken veins.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In one deep sigh, as Recollection came,</L>
<L>It wakens Gratitude's impetuous flame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"For more than life," exclaims the trembling Maid,</L>
<L>"I stand indebted to thy generous aid."</L>

<L>'Cease, Fair-One, cease.—well might this arm deserve</L>

<L>And chides with sighs the swiftly fleeting Hours:</L>
<L>Still at the chearful Board, or as she roves</L>
<L>Along the Plain, or lingers in the Groves,</L>
<L>Each glowing wish, from new-born Passion sprung,</L>
<L>Each soft disorder, on her eye-lids hung,</L>
<L>At my approach reveal, tho' much in vain,</L>
<L>What words are little wanted to explain,</L>
<L>Vain! had I never seen the matchless grace,</L>
<L>The touching sweetness of LOUISA's face;</L>
<L><PB N="31" REF="022137_0036_0FB6CBC64DA78390"/>Where from each feature beams, or mildly plays,</L>
<L>Refined intelligence, with varying rays;</L>
<L>Where native dignity, with air serene,</L>
<L>Conscious, not arrogant, adorns her mein;</L>
<L>While from those eyes, in scorn of artful wiles,</L>
<L>The tender spotless Soul looks out, and smiles.—</L>
<L>These unbeheld, yet still EMIRA's charms</L>
<L>Had ne'er allur'd EUGENIO to her arms;</L>
<L>For oh! the fever'd languor of the eye,</L>
<L>The restless blushes, the voluptuous sigh,</L>
<L>Th' impatient haughtiness, but half conceal'd,</L>
<L>The rage of pleasure in each glance reveal'd,</L>
<L>Tho' in youth's fervid hours, perchance they fire</L>
<L>The kindling ardours of unaw'd Desire,</L>
<L>Quench, while the transient flames their force impart,</L>
<L>The torch of Passion, e'er it reach the Heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twas thus the youthful Ithacan survey'd</L>
<L>The Goddess Nymph, beneath her magic Shade;</L>
<L>While Eucharis' mild beauties foil'd the sway</L>
<L>Of charms, that deck'd the Daughter of the Day;</L>
<L>By Love protected, when the Princely Boy</L>
<L>Beheld the Dame her wonted lures employ;</L>
<L>Saw her fine Form, by all the Graces drest,</L>
<L>The glowing purple of the floating vest,</L>
<L><PB N="32" REF="022137_0037_0FB6CBC8D490FBF0"/>And on her blooming cheek the tresses bright,</L>
<L>That play'd in wavy wreaths of golden light,</L>
<L>Or on her snowy bosom, shining fell,</L>
<L>Like a warm Sun-beam on a Lilly's bell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not more EMIRA's charms my Soul engage,</L>
<L>The fair Calypso of a sensual age;</L>
<L>And then licentious Beauty less, the stores</L>
<L>That splendid Fortune on EMMIKA pours;</L>
<L>Or the proud boast of lineal Blood, allied</L>
<L>To Rank, and Pow'r, could wake that senseless Pride,</L>
<L>Which quenches the soft warmth that Love inspires,</L>
<L>And lights the nuptial torch with rayless fires.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To save the Fair-One from the thorny smart</L>
<L>Of hopeless Passion, rankling in her heart,</L>
<L>I urge my gentle Sisters to reveal</L>
<L>All my charm'd senses for LOUISA feel;</L>
<L>The worth, the graces, which around her wait,</L>
<L>And all the smiling prospect of our fate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>EMIRA listens with impassion'd scorn,</L>
<L>Of wounded Pride, and rival Anger born.</L>
<L>Unwish'd unwelcome, as the theme arose,</L>
<L>Her clouded cheek in deep suffusion glows,</L>
<L>Proudly exclaiming,—"Can EUGENIO prove</L>
<L><PB N="33" REF="022137_0038_0FB6CBCCD386B3F8"/>"Cold, and obdurate to my lavish Love?</L>
<L>"Has Beauty's magic zone my bosom bound,</L>
<L>"Does Rank exalt me, and has Fortune crown'd,</L>
<L>"That faint attractions in a Village Maid</L>
<L>"Should shield the Passions which these eyes invade?</L>
<L>"Impossible!—but oh? thy lips impart</L>
<L>"The sting of jealousy, that goads my heart.</L>
<L>"MATILDA, all my waking dreams divine</L>
<L>"Thy charming Brother shall at length be mine▪</L>
<L>"This groveling flame was but ordain'd to prove</L>
<L>"Thy Friend's wish'd triumph at the shrine of Love,</L>
<L>"And by comparison of brighter charms,</L>
<L>"To light EUGENIO to EMIRA's arms."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, while self-flatt'ring Pride her mind assures,</L>
<L>The artful Fair-One spreads her varied lures;</L>
<L>Sometimes, with archness laughing in her eyes,</L>
<L>Hangs on my arm, and ridicules my sighs;</L>
<L>And oft with coyer tenderness appears,</L>
<L>While Love's warm glances steal thro' shining tears;</L>
<L>Now, with arch'd brow, and supercilious stare,</L>
<L>Affects the empress—dignity of air;</L>
<L>And now, as reasoning with a wayward Heart,</L>
<L>In trances, broken by the frequent start,</L>
<L>With pausing step she wanders thro' the Grove,</L>
<L>A female Proteus in the wiles of Love!</L>

<L>To muse at leisure on my lovely Maid,</L>
<L>And woo her image in the lonely Glade,</L>
<L>Where no EMIRA by the rigid laws</L>
<L>Politeness dictates, my attention draws,</L>
<L>Far in the Wilds I wander thro' the Day,</L>
<L>And to a lowly Cot at midnight stray;</L>
<L>There taste the sweetness of that deep repose,</L>
<L>Which from applauding Conscience gently flows,</L>
<L>When Health, and Hope their downy pinions spread,</L>
<L>And scatter roses on the youthful bed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Light with the Dawn disperse my tender dreams▪</L>
<L>And now the Sun looks golden on the streams?—</L>
<L>O Morn! the last for me that gaily rose,</L>
<L>On Memory's tablet still thy beauty glows.</L>
<L>Charm'd, as I wander'd thro' the dewy Vale,</L>
<L>And drank the spirit of the Mountain-gale,</L>
<L>How little did my unconscious heart divine,</L>
<L>The joys thou gav'st should ne'er again be mine!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On as I rov'd along the winding Glades,</L>
<L>A Youth in haste the sylvan Copse pervades!</L>
<L>Says, his commission instantly recalls</L>
<L>My devious step to the paternal walls.</L>
<L>Upon the rustic countenance appears</L>
<L>A fix'd solemnity, that wakes my fears.—</L>
<L><PB N="35" REF="022137_0040_0FB6CBD4203FEBA0"/>"Oh! is all well?"—with breathless haste I cry,</L>
<L>"Thy Friends are well,"—his faltering lips reply;</L>
<L>Then dread, lest sad intelligence invade</L>
<L>The precious quiet of my native Shade,</L>
<L>Sickens my heart;—and swiftly as I go,</L>
<L>From my pale lip disorder'd accents flow;</L>
<L>Each moment, for LOUISA's Life, arise</L>
<L>Prayers, that implore the mercies of the Skies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now my quick, unequal steps are led,</L>
<L>A Day of gladness where they us'd to spread,</L>
<L>But ah! no silver tones EUGENIO call!</L>
<L>No bounding foot-step meets me in the hall!</L>
<L>Suspence, with all its heavy heart-ach, teems,</L>
<L>And palpable the solemn stillness seems!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So, when returning from the well-faught plain,</L>

</LG>

<L>O! Thou soft Hope, that once with lustre gay</L>
<L>Did'st gild the hours of Love's delicious day,</L>
<L>What, tho' no more the lively joy remains,</L>
<L>That traced thy light step, o'er those earthly plains,</L>
<L>Yet, piercing now Despair's incumbant shroud,</L>
<L>Soft Hope, thou lockest from you parting cloud;</L>
<L>And my lov'd EMMA's hand the vision shews,</L>
<L>That smiles my struggling Spirit to repose!</L>
<L>Bright in EUGENIO'S vindicated truth,</L>
<L>That vision lights anew my drooping youth;</L>
<L>For, in perspective beauteous, it displays</L>
<L>A long eternity of blissful days;</L>
<L><PB N="49" REF="022137_0054_0FB6CC62AC8195D0"/>Of all those sacred joys our Souls shall prove</L>
<L>"When pleading Seraphs reunite our love."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis true, EUGENIO, thro' Life's thorny way,</L>
<L>In far divided path's our steps shall stray;</L>
<L>It is not given us, when rude blasts assail,</L>
<L>And pale Misfortune breaths the bitter gale,</L>
<L>It is not given, to temper, and assuage,</L>
<L>Each for the other's breast, its cruel rage;</L>
<L>Nor mutually to feel the cheering rays,</L>
<L>When Health, and Joy inspirit Summer-days.</L>
<L>Our little barks, their flattering Port in view,</L>
<L>Fate, on Life's billowy surge, asunder threw;</L>
<L>Friend of my soul! we are not doom'd to gain</L>
<L>The sunny Isle of that tempestuous Main;</L>
<L>But O! thy Virtue, long imagin'd lost,</L>
<L>Has felt the wreck of no insiduous coast!</L>
<L>The deep and troubled floods, it knew to brave!</L>
<L>It rises buoyant on the stormy waves!</L>
<L>Vain are those Storms, by which its course is driven.</L>
<L>Since sure, tho' distant, is the port of Heaven.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My dear EUGENIO, the dread Voice will prove</L>
<L>Indulgent to the frail excess of Love,</L>
<L>Which to such sad extremes would blindly run,</L>
<L>Lavish of health, and sickening at the Sun;</L>
<L><PB N="50" REF="022137_0055_0FB6CC698EC2D6D0"/>Since, while an unaccusing Conscience threw</L>
<L>Th' eternal portals open to my view,</L>
<L>My Spirit sunk, a prey to fond Despair,</L>
<L>And coldly view'd that Heaven thou could'st not share;</L>
<L>Soil'd with its griefs those amaranthine flowers,</L>
<L>Inwove by Faith in bright Religion's bowers</L>
<L>Angel of Mercy! thou wilt gently breathe</L>
<L>Exhaling sighs upon that sullied wreath;</L>
<L>And the dim stains of my impatient tears,</L>
<L>Impassion'd yearnings, and desponding fears,</L>
<L>Shall vanish, as chill dews that Morning throws,</L>
<L>By summer Winds are wasted from the Rose!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O! how o'er-joyed my dazzled sight survey'd</L>
<L>These words, in EMMA's characters pourtray'd,</L>
<L>"He is not guilty!"—rapid from my tongue</L>
<L>They, in exulting iteration, sprung.</L>
<L>"Read, dear LOUISA, and acquit the Heart,</L>
<L>"That bears in all thy griefs so large a Part."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Think'st thou, my EMMA, thy benign command</L>
<L>Met an unwilling eye, a tardy hand?</L>
<L>Heaven! with what force these hands these eyes, impell'd</L>
<L>Sieze the known characters, so long with-held!</L>
<L>While every letter, e'er examin'd, wears</L>
<L>Th' uninjur'd magic of the vanish'd years!</L>
<L><PB N="51" REF="022137_0056_0FB6CC6A9D520310"/>Disorder'd sounds my lips pronounce, nor spare</L>
<L>The useless question to th' unconscious air.</L>
<L>"Does that dear hand yet trace LOUISA's name?</L>
<L>"Will it his Love, his Innocence proclaim?</L>
<L>"How may this be?—yet EMMA says 'tis so."</L>
<L>Then did I read, and weep, and throb▪ and glow,</L>
<L>Approve, absolve, admire, and smile, and sigh,</L>
<L>Till pensive Peace shone mildly in my eye;</L>
<L>Back with that lost esteem, my heart deplor'd,</L>
<L>The Wanderer came, with half her rights restor'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So luckless CLAIRMONT's thorny path she smooths;</L>
<L>So his sharp sense of many an ill she sooths;</L>
<L>One dear recover'd Hope his grief beguiles,</L>
<L>And, 'midst the wreck of all the rest, he smiles.</L>
<L>EMMA, thou knew'st him well;—the jocund Youth,</L>
<L>Ambition's Votary, yet of taintless truth.</L>
<L>Lur'd by the wealth the glowing Andes hide,</L>
<L>He long'd to pass the interposing tide.</L>
<L>Remembrance sees him on the Sea-beach stand,</L>
<L>His fair CLARISSA weeping on his hand.</L>
<L>With anxious smiles her varying cheek he dries,</L>
<L>And talks of prosperous Winds, and favoring Skies.</L>
<L>Clear was the Sky, and gentle were the Gales,</L>
<L>And wide and waving stream'd the snowy Sails;</L>
<L><PB N="52" REF="022137_0057_0FB6CC6CCCF398F8"/>While, tossing the green sea-weed o'er, and o'er,</L>
<L>Crept the hush'd billow on the shelly shore;</L>
<L>Soft as th' autumnal breeze among the sheaves,</L>
<L>Or gently rustling in the fallen leaves;</L>
<L>And rolling in blue Light the watery Way</L>
<L>With frosted silver seem'd bedropt, and gay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Impatient CLAIRMONT led his pensive Bride,</L>
<L>As slow she scal'd the Vessel's stately side.</L>
<L>So smooth the Seas, the tall Bark seem'd to sleep,</L>
<L>While her gay Pennants ting'd the glassy Deep.</L>
<L>Day after day mild Breezes freshen'd round,</L>
<L>Till Skies alone the mighty Waters bound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But now, far distant from Britannia's shore,</L>
<L>Round craggy Steeps where angry billows roar,</L>
<L>Rise the dark Wind!—and borne on flagging wing,</L>
<L>On the bent mast the screaming Fulmars cling!</L>
<L>And soon the fury of the wildest Storm</L>
<L>That could the vext and swelling Sea deform,</L>
<L>With Death's shrill voice, shrieks in the rending shrouds,</L>
<L>As whirls the dizzy Vessel to the clouds;</L>
<L>Or prone shoots swiftly to the billowy vale,</L>
<L>While the wet Seaman's altering cheek is pale.</L>

<PB N="53" REF="022137_0058_0FB6CC89225E1C68"/>
<L>The Whirling Ship the guiding Rudder mocks,</L>

<L>Unhappy CLAIRMONT, who had vainly tried</L>
<L>In the toss'd Boat to place his beauteous Bride,</L>
<L>Sees, on the deck pale, trembling, as she stood,</L>
<L>The sudden Billow dash her to the Flood;</L>
<L>While on the riven plank himself convey'd,</L>
<L>With only Life, beneath a stranger Shade,</L>
<L>Wakes from the briny trance, and wakes to know,</L>
<L>Of Fate's dark stores, the most accomplish'd Woe!</L>
<L>Borne by a friendly Sail, that now he stands</L>
<L>A ruin'd Wanderer on his native Lands,</L>
<L>Seems little;—Love's severer tortures reign</L>
<L>With force despotic, and exclusive pain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This borne, from month to month, and year to yea</L>
<L>At length, unlook'd for tidings charm his ear;</L>
<L>His fair CLARISA lives!—on coasts unknown</L>
<L>Wreck'd, like himself, unfriended and alone,</L>
<L>By destiny severe, an hapless Slave,</L>
<L>Pines on rude shores beyond th' Atlantic wave;</L>
<L>Yet, that she <HI>lives</HI> is so unhoped a joy!—</L>
<L>Before it doubt, and Fear, and Anguish fly!</L>
<L>She lives!—and Fate may aid the ardent strife,</L>
<L>And to his arms restore his long-lost Wife?</L>
<L><PB N="54" REF="022137_0059_0FB6CC8A4A6BD4D8"/>In that dear hope pale Misery's tortures cease,</L>
<L>And agony subsides almost to peace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So I—but to EUGENIO swift impart</L>
<L>How full the pardon of LOUISA's heart▪</L>
<L>O! let him not repent he wrung her Mind</L>
<L>With fruitless woes, so generously desin'd;</L>
<L>Since, tho' they fail'd her freedom to restore,</L>
<L>Had she not long been destin'd to deplore</L>
<L>His Mind, as cruel, venal, false, and vain—</L>
<L>O but for that!—the Soul—distracting pain,</L>
<L>Whose unexpected flight makes other grief</L>
<L>Sink in the softness of that blest relief,</L>
<L>Her Spirit ne'er, as now, had risen above</L>
<L>The poignant woes of disappointed Love;</L>
<L>Of that disunion here, stern Fate commands,</L>
<L>Who throws her edicts with such ruthless hands!</L>
<L>But greater Ills remov'd the less remain</L>
<L>Shorn of their pointed stings, and lost their bane.</L>
<L>Say, in LOUISA's breast no longer glow</L>
<L>The inward fires of life consuming Woe;</L>
<L>Distant alike from Pain's incumbant gloom,</L>
<L>And sprightly Pleasure's gaily-kindling bloom,</L>
<L>The vital Powers effuse a softer flame,</L>
<L>And with serener beams pervade her Frame.</L>
<L><PB N="55" REF="022137_0060_0FB6CC8BE29B8EE0"/>O bid him live!—live, to fulfil each part</L>
<L>That makes such awful claims upon his heart;</L>
<L>And as an Husband, as a Father, prove</L>
<L>Virtuous, and great, as in his filial love!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I too shall live!—Health's warmer currents break,</L>
<L>Yet unconfirm'd, upon my faded cheek,</L>
<L>Last Night their honied dews prolong'd my rest,</L>
<L>As soft they sprung within my cherish'd breast.</L>
<L>O Night! the first exempt from wildest throes</L>
<L>Of fever'd Pain, that chas'd the short repose,</L>
<L>Since my EUGENIO's seeming coldness shove,</L>
<L>Alas! how much in vain! to quench my Love.</L>
<L>Yes, I shall live to expiate by a Mind</L>
<L>Bow'd to its fate, and cheerfully resign'd,</L>
<L>The dangerous rashness, which my peace had thrown</L>
<L>On human chance, and errors not my own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here, to my favourite bower, at rising Day,</L>
<L>With tranquil step, I bent my purpos'd way;</L>
<L>For here I first beheld the graceful Youth,</L>
<L>And here he promis'd everlasting truth;</L>
<L>And here to thee, my Friend, I used to grieve,</L>
<L>When Life could charm no more, nor Hope deceive;</L>
<L><PB N="56" REF="022137_0061_0FB6CC8D2CF51820"/>And here, my long afflicted Spirit, freed</L>
<L>From that barb'd shaft, on which it wont to bleed,</L>
<L>Now bids its soften'd feelings gently flow,</L>
<L>To her, who draws the deadly sting of Woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Once more these eyes, with smiles of pleasure hail</L>
<L>The vernal beauties of my native Vale;</L>
<L>The plenteous dews, that in the early ray</L>
<L>Gem the light leaf, and tremble on the spray;</L>
<L>The fresh cool gales, that undulating pass,</L>
<L>With shadowy sweep, along the bending grass.—</L>
<L>Now throw the shrubs and trees the lengthen'd shade</L>
<L>On the smooth turf distinct!—and now they fade,</L>
<L>As sinks the Sun, behind a cloud withdrawn,</L>
<L>That late unveil'd shone yellow on the lawn.</L>
<L>Soft o'er the Vale, from this my favorite seat,</L>
<L>Serene I mark the vagrant beauties fleet;</L>
<L>In different lights the changing features trace,</L>
<L>Catch the bright form, and paint the shadowy grace.</L>
<L>Where the light Ash, and browner Oak extend,</L>
<L>And high in Air their mingled branches bend,</L>
<L>The mossy bank, beneath their trembling bowers,</L>
<L>Arises, fragrant with uncultur'd flowers,</L>
<L>That stoop the sweet head o'er the latent spring,</L>
<L>And bear the pendant Bees, that humming cling.</L>
<L><PB N="57" REF="022137_0062_0FB6CCAC4C62E600"/>Just gleams the Fount—for, curving o'er its brink,</L>

<L>Their green arms half its glassy beauties hide,</L>
<L>As from beneath them steals the wandering tide,</L>
<L>And down the Valley careless winds away,</L>
<L>While in its streams the glancing Sun-beams play.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But where the Greenwood-hill, with arching shade,</L>
<L>Opes the light Vista up the winding Glade,</L>
<L>I see a venerable Form descend;</L>
<L>His slow steps falter as they hither bend.</L>
<L>Soft lifts the breeze the locks of silver grey,</L>
<L>And gentlest meanings his mild looks convey;</L>
<L>Stranger, whoe'er thou art, thy faded face</L>
<L>And bending form have many a touching grace.</L>
<L>He stops!—I hasten to explore the cause</L>
<L>Of that fix'd gaze!—of that impassion'd pause!</L>

<TRAILER>END OF THE THIRD EPISTLE.</TRAILER>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="note">
<P><HI>NOTE,</HI> UPON reading this third Epistle to a Friend, he observed, that perhaps a comparison of <HI>LOUISA's</HI> own situation with the harder fate of her Lover, and her tender pity for the inevitable miseries of such a union, might have been acceptable in the place of the episode of <HI>CLAIRMONT,</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="022137_0063_0FB6CCAE13BAB860"/>
and the description of the bower; but it should be considered, that <HI>LOUISA</HI> wrote under the immediate impression of her extacy to find <HI>EUGENIO</HI> guiltless; that her Mind was not sober'd enough for reflection. To have investigated the un∣happy lot of her Lover must have been a melancholly em∣ployment. Eased of an oppressive weight of misery, her exhilarated spirits admit not, so early, any painful ideas. She does not discriminate, she felicitates her destiny. Her sympathy in the fate of her Friends grows more lively—she recollects the situation of <HI>CLAIRMONT</HI>—Joy is naturally loquacious, and she is gratified in relating his story to her <HI>EMMA.</HI> She awakens with new vivacity to the impressions of pleasure, which her Mind was accustomed to receive from scenic objects. The propensity to dwell on them prevailed even in the hours of her unhappiness. It is an habit which compares and assimilates the smiling, or the gloomy views of Nature to the internal feelings, and is common to people of a lively imagination. In the exultation of her Heart to find her Lover yet estimable, <HI>LOUISA</HI> speeds to the bower, so im∣press'd with his image. Its beauties strike her more for∣cibly than ever, and in this frame of Mind she naturally feels delight in painting them.</P>

<LG>
<L>OH! my lov'd EMMA, I have much to tell,</L>
<L>Since last I sent thee an abrupt farewel;</L>
<L>But be the chain of those events regain'd,</L>
<L>That led my steps, where awful Horrors reign'd,</L>
<L>And thro' their gloom, the light of Joy reveal'd,</L>
<L>By Fate's eclipsing hand so long conceal'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Rising impatient from the mossy seat,</L>
<L>with asking eyes, the stranger Guest I meet;</L>
<L>He clasps my hand!—Oh! in that look benign,</L>
<L>What rays of love, and angel-pity shine!</L>
<L>Sweet cordial confidence my bosom cheers,</L>
<L>Yet thrilling start the soft spontaneous tears.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="60" REF="022137_0065_0FB6CCCDB7B0E1B8"/>
<L>'What chance, or generous impulse, may I bless,</L>
<L>'Thrice gentle Stranger, for this kind address;</L>
<L>'That thus thou visitest this lonely Grove,</L>
<L>'And gazest on me with paternal love?'</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Ah! sweet LOUISA," the mild Form replies,</L>
<L>His words slow mingling with the rising sighs,</L>
<L>"Behold in me, the source of all the woes,</L>
<L>"That paled on thy fair cheek the early rose,</L>
<L>"But thou art generous, and wilt kindly shed</L>
<L>"Forgiveness on ERNESTO's aged head;</L>
<L>"Yes, thou wilt much allow to sad extremes,</L>
<L>"For round thee, as a Light, Compassion beams"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With pleas'd surprize my beating heart expands;</L>
<L>My swifter tears fall copious on his hands;</L>
<L>My trembling knee involuntary bends</L>
<L>For deepest reverence with my transport blends.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'O Heaven! art thou that Being, so rever'd,</L>
<L>'In happier days to my charm'd Soul endear'd,</L>
<L>'Which oft, unconscious of thy Form, survey'd</L>
<L>'Thy worth, by filial tenderness display'd.</L>
<L>'All, all is known!—no selfish murmers rise,</L>
<L>'Nor groans arraign the mandate of the skies;</L>
<L><PB N="61" REF="022137_0066_0FB6CCCF13F52D38"/>'Nobly EUGENIO their high call obey'd!—</L>
<L>'Oh! what a Wretch were I, should I upbraid,</L>
<L>'Because th' exalted Youth, whose heart I won,</L>
<L>Deserves the blessing, to be born thy Son!</L>
<L>'Some vagrant drops may fall, some rebel sighs,</L>
<L>"Perchance, to our divided Loves arise;</L>
<L>'But vanish'd now is Misery's ruthless smart,</L>
<L>'Tho' sad, not wretched, my devoted Heart;</L>
<L>'And oh! since poor LOUISA thus obtains</L>

<L>"Honor'd LOUISA! fair angelic Maid,</L>
<L>"With every blessing be thy worth repaid!</L>
<L>"But time flies rapidly!—the least delay</L>
<L>"Ill suits th' important message I convey;</L>
<L>"An hapless Penitent adjures thee fly,</L>

<L>Silent—astonish'd—trembling—faint—and pale,</L>

<PB N="62" REF="022137_0067_0FB6CCD0AB759C40"/>
<L>'When to the Altar my unhappy Son</L>

<L>'Pensive his eye, and serious was his air;</L>
<L>'Tho', with attentive, and respectful care,</L>
<L>'He strove to hide the sorrows of his Soul,</L>
<L>'But could not oft their bursting sigh controul,</L>
<L>'Bright, and adorn'd, as came the high-born Maid,</L>
<L>'In every lavish elegance array'd.</L>
<L>'Yet oft I saw, that inauspicious Morn,</L>
<L>'From smother'd consciousness, the transient scorn</L>
<L>'Cast lurid flames at times, amid the joy</L>
<L>'That glow'd voluptuous in her ardent eye,</L>
<L>'When she perceiv'd, no ray of fond desire</L>
<L>'Met her warm glance, or authoris'd its fire;</L>
<L>'saw deep-felt anguish in her Bridegroom prove</L>
<L>'The power supreme of violated Love;</L>
<L>'And oft his notice, courteous, yet constrain'd,</L>
<L>'Eager she sought; receiving it, disdain'd;</L>
<L>'And still each day increas'd the vain chagrin,</L>
<L>'And wak'd new fallies of malicious spleen;</L>
<L>'The pensive homage of a wounded Mind,</L>
<L>'Tho' grateful, sad, and, without ardor, kind,</L>
<L>'Seem'd to reproach those eyes, as powerless grown,</L>

<L>'Unjust EMIRA! that could'st hope to gain</L>
<L>'Love's glowing homage from an Heart in pain;</L>
<L>'Thou should'st have sooth'd th' involuntary smart,</L>
<L>'And with his friendship satisfied thy heart;</L>
<L>'Thus sweet, and gentle, thou had'st quickly won</L>
<L>'That grateful tribute from my generous Son;</L>
