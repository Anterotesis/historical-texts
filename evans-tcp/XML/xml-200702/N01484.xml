<P>A Sorrowful Spectacle.

<HEAD>The OCCASION.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT gave Occasion to the SERMONS here Ex∣hibited, was an Amazing Instance of what the poor Children of Men abandoned unto <HI>Ignorance</HI> and <HI>Wickedness</HI> may be left unto! A Prodigious Instance of that <HI>Hardness of Heart,</HI> which especially the <HI>Sins of Unchastity,</HI> accompanied with <HI>Delays of Repentance,</HI> do lead unto.</P>
<P><HI>Margaret Gaulacher,</HI> an <HI>Irish</HI> Wo∣man, arrived the last Winter from <HI>Cork</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> a Servant, that soon found a Place in a Family where she would not have wanted Opportuni∣ties and Encouragements for the Ser∣vice of GOD.</P>
<P>She had been by her part in a <HI>Theft</HI> brought into Trouble in <HI>Ireland;</HI> and after her Transportation hither, it was not long before she was found in <HI>Thievish</HI> Practices.</P>
<P>Ere she had been long here, it was begun to be suspected, that she
<PB N="ii" REF="001764_0004_0FB7CBCFEEEC8708"/>
was with Child, by a Fornication; But she so Obstinately all along de∣nied it, that at last she must feel the Effects of her Obstinacy.</P>
<P>She was delivered of her <HI>Illegiti∣mate,</HI> when she was all alone; and she hid the <HI>Killed Infant</HI> out of the way; which was within a little while discovered.</P>
<P>Of her Behaviour in the Time of her Imprisonment, and of the Means used for her Good, there is an Ac∣count given in our SERMONS.</P>
<P>The Woman was of a very Vio∣lent Spirit; and the Transports and Furies thereof, sometimes were with such Violence, as carried in them, one would have thought, an uncom∣mon Degree of <HI>Satanic Energie.</HI></P>
<P>By'nd by, she would bewail her Passions, and promise to indulge herself no more in such Passionate Outrages.</P>
<P>One who owns himself to be a <HI>Roman-Catholick,</HI> affirms to me, that she privately Declared herself unto him, to be in her Heart, of his Re∣ligion;
<PB N="iii" REF="001764_0005_0FB7CBD0DEBB1890"/>
But she never would own any thing of <HI>that</HI> unto the Ministers who visited her with the Means of her Salvation.</P>
<P>A Gracious and Worthy Servant of God, Mr. <HI>Thomas Craighead,</HI> (a Faithful and Painful Minister of the Gospel, who came from <HI>Ireland,</HI> much about the same time that she did) having Instructed her, and used many Charitable Endeavours for her Good, was desired by her to be near her at her Execution; who ac∣cordingly Pray'd with her there, and continued his Instructions unto the Last.</P>
<P>She said little, but referr'd herself to the Paper which had been read Publickly in the Congregation just before.</P>
<P>And yet she Frowardly let fall one Word, which did not seem very consistent with it; For which fret∣ful Strain of Impatience, being re∣buked, she added, <HI>Then the Lord be Merciful unto me!</HI> and spoke no more.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="001764_0006_0FB7CBD2588A0738"/>
All that remains for us to do, is to leave her in the Hands of a So∣vereign GOD, whose <HI>Judgment,</HI> and not <HI>ours,</HI> has the Disposal of her; and make the <HI>best Improvement</HI> we can of such a Tragical Spectacle; for which the ensuing SERMONS are some Essays.</P>
<P>But, I ought now if I can, to Refresh my Readers, with something that shall be more Agreeable, more Comfortable; have less to Trouble them; something that may be the <HI>Reverse</HI> of so shocking a Spectacle, as has here given Troublesome I∣dea's unto them.</P>
<P>Looking among my Reserved Me∣morials, I find an Excellent Hand∣maid of the Lord, a bright Candi∣date of the <HI>Heavenly Glory,</HI> finishing her Holy Life, in such Remarkable Circumstances, that I cannot withold a Brief Relation of the Matter.</P>
<P>Some while ago, there died in our <HI>Salem,</HI> a Gentlewoman whose Name was Mrs. <HI>Rix,</HI> the Daughter of the Reverend Mr. <HI>Skelton,</HI> (one of the
<PB N="v" REF="001764_0007_0FB7CBD55F6AC538"/>
Two first Ministers, that Illuminated the First of the Churches in the <HI>Massachuset</HI> Colony;) A Gentlewo∣man of Real <HI>Piety,</HI> and of equal <HI>Pa∣tience;</HI> and one who had been a Disciple of the Cross, and had en∣dured much Affliction, especially by Sickness, with much Submission to the Will of God. Some while before she died, her Valuable Pastor, (the Reverend Mr. <HI>Nicholas Noyes,</HI>) gave her a Visit, wherein the Holy Minds of both, had their grateful Enter∣tainments. Particularly, she told him, That there had newly appeared un∣to her, several <HI>Shining Persons,</HI> who told her, <HI>That they were not now come for her, but on that Day six Weeks hence, they would come for her, and fetch her away with a Glorious Equipage.</HI> And then she immediately asked her Pa∣stor, <HI>I pray Syr, what is the meaning of the Word EQUIP AGE? I don't re∣member that I have heard that Word EQUIP AGE!</HI>—Her Pastor with his usual Wisdom, (tho' wondring at what she said, and pondering <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="vi" REF="001764_0008_0FB7CBDFCD4DD2A0"/>
in his Heart,) advised her by no means, to build her Hopes, on any <HI>Visionary Matters,</HI> but have them for∣ever▪ Built on the <HI>sure Foundation,</HI> which the <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> decla∣red in the Gospel, afforded for them. She gave him abundant Satisfaction that she did so. But yet she kept in an Heavenly Manner, Praying, and Waiting, and Longing, to see her <HI>long Six Weeks</HI> expired; and precise∣ly at the Expiration thereof, <HI>she died.</HI></P>
<P>My Readers, I could not withhold <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ Passage from you; nor forbear observing to you, That a <HI>Soul</HI> filled with the <HI>Love</HI> of GOD, and a Plea∣sure in all possible Obedience and Conformity to the <HI>Will</HI> of GOD, and a dislike of every thing that may be Displeasing to Him: A <HI>Soul</HI> that <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> and Admires, and Adores, the Blessed JESUS, and Believes on him for all Good, and has a perpetua∣ted course to Him as the <HI>Fountain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> A <HI>Soul,</HI> that is full of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> towards all the Children of Men and cannot h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rbour the least <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI>

<P><PB N="7" REF="001764_0014_0FB7CBF26C8BC348"/>
There are some Awful PROPO∣SITIONS, which we must now at∣tend unto.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>The First PROPOSITION.</HEAD>
<P>An <HI>Hard-hearted Sinner▪</HI> is no unu∣sual Spectacle. <HI>Hardness of Heart</HI> is a Spectacle too frequently to be seen among the Sinful Children of Men.</P>
<P>But, what is an <HI>Hard Heart?</HI> And what are the <HI>Symptoms</HI> of it?</P>
<P>You know, in general; There is a <HI>Metaphor</HI> in the Phrase. An <HI>Hard Heart</HI> is a Soul, that has Dispositions, wherein the Properties of a <HI>Stone</HI> are answered. The <HI>Heart</HI> means <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> which like the <HI>Bowel</HI> that we call. <HI>The Heart,</HI> is within us. 'Tis our <HI>Inner Man.</HI> The <HI>Hardness</HI> of the <HI>Heart,</HI> is allusive to the <HI>Hardness</HI> of a <HI>Stone. As hard as a Stone,</HI> is a Proverbial Speech. An <HI>hard Heart</HI> has in the Sacred Scripture this Denomination▪ Ezek. XI. 19. <HI>A Stony Heart</HI> Yet, 'Tis an <HI>Heart</HI> compared <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Stone,</HI> which is the most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Fossil Tribe; even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="8" REF="001764_0015_0FB7CBF42A3319C0"/>
We read, Zech. VII. 12. <HI>They have made their Hearts as an Adamant Stone.</HI> The Qualities of a <HI>Stone</HI> are then to be enquired after. O look Inward; <HI>Enquire within;</HI> and, <HI>Commune with thine own Heart.</HI> My, Friend, If thy <HI>Heart</HI> have these Qualities, it is an <HI>hard Heart;</HI> and it is time for thee to cry out, <HI>God be Merciful to me, an Hard-hearted Sinner!</HI></P>
<P>First. An <HI>hard Heart,</HI> is an Heart very <HI>Dull of Understanding</HI> in the Word of God; not brought <HI>quickly to un∣derstand</HI> the Truths and Things of Religion. We read; Mar. VIII. 17. <HI>Perceive ye not yet; neither understand? Have ye, your Heart hardned?</HI> Some∣times the <HI>Heart</HI> of a Man apprehends no more than a <HI>Stone,</HI> of those Things, which are <HI>The Things of our Peace.</HI> 'Tis an <HI>hard Heart</HI> that is thus Unapprehensive, so Inadvertent. Thus we read, Mar. VI. 52. <HI>They consider∣ed not, for their Heart was hardene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> Many a Man does not <HI>consider</HI> what the Word of God speaks unto him not <HI>consider</HI> what Errand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he came
<PB N="9" REF="001764_0016_0FB7CBF64E4F2988"/>
into the World upon, or how to be∣have himself in the World; not <HI>con∣sider</HI> how soon he may go out of the World, nor what will become of him when he is gone out of the World. Alas, the <HI>Heart</HI> of this Man is <HI>hardened.</HI> An <HI>hard Heart</HI> is the same with a <HI>slow Heart.</HI> We read, Luk. XXIV. 25. <HI>O Fools, and slow of Heart to believe.</HI> An <HI>Heart slow</HI> to take in right Notions about the Glo∣ry of GOD, the Beauty of CHRIST, the Damage of SIN, and the <HI>Reason∣ableness of Religion;</HI> an <HI>hard Heart</HI> it is! An <HI>Heart</HI> that is <HI>hard</HI> to be in∣structed in the Affairs of the King∣dom of God. An <HI>hard Heart</HI> is a <HI>Sottish</HI> one. A <HI>blind Mind</HI> goes with an <HI>hard Heart.</HI> We read, Joh. XII. 40. <HI>He hath blinded their Eyes, and hardened their Heart.</HI> O you that sit under the Means of Knowledge, but still remain <HI>Souls without Knowledge,</HI> and know very little of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Points <HI>which to know is Life <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> you have the Light <HI>shining</HI> about you our not <HI>entring</HI> into you; no, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="10" REF="001764_0017_0FB7CBF7EE179B38"/>
than into a <HI>Stone;</HI> you have cause to cry out, <HI>Oh! the hardness of my Heart! What will become of me!</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. An <HI>hard Heart</HI> is an <HI>Heart</HI> not easily impress'd upon; what the Word of God will not easi∣ly make any <HI>good Impression</HI> upon. Sometimes the Word of God makes a <HI>Deep Impression</HI> upon the <HI>Heart;</HI> yea, the <HI>Heart</HI> is <HI>Conformed</HI> unto the Word of God, as if it were cast into the Mould of it. So we read, Rom. VI. 17. <HI>Ye have obey'd from the Heart, that Form of Doctrine whereinto ye were drawn.</HI> This is not an <HI>hard Heart;</HI> It is an <HI>Heart of Wax,</HI> rather than an <HI>Heart of Stone.</HI> But now, an <HI>hard Heart</HI> is one; that Hears the <HI>Commandments</HI> of God, but will take no Notice of them; will not obey them, will not observe them. It hears the <HI>Promises</HI> of God, but it is not affected with them; the <HI>Consolations of God</HI> are <HI>small</HI> unto it. It hears the <HI>Threatnings</HI> of God, but it is not affrighted at them; it <HI>Mocks at the Fear:</HI> The great God says; Jer. XXIII. 29. <HI>Is
<PB N="11" REF="001764_0018_0FB7CBFC0F6131E0"/>
not my Word like an Hammer, which breaks the Rocks in pieces.</HI> But many an <HI>Heart</HI> under the Knocks of that <HI>Hammer,</HI> is never broken by them. The Sinner is earnestly call'd upon, To forsake the ways of Sin; to Em∣brace his only Saviour; To come into the Covenant of God. He stirs no more than a <HI>Stone.</HI> The Loud Calls of Heaven are made unto him, to <HI>Arise and call upon his God,</HI> and set upon the Practice of Prayer, and form unalterable Resolutions of Pie∣ty; <HI>As Good speak to a Stone!</HI> He is nothing the <HI>better,</HI> for sitting under the <HI>good Word of God.</HI> All Counsils, all Rebukes, all Exhortations are thrown away upon him. <HI>O hardness of Heart!</HI> There is an <HI>Heart</HI> that will not <HI>Conform</HI> unto the Word and Will of God; An <HI>Inflexible</HI> Heart; An <HI>Unpliable</HI> Heart; An <HI>Heart</HI> from which the Demands made in the Word of God have that Return. <HI>As for the Word spoken to me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the Lord, I will not hear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> it.</HI> What shall be said of such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.
<PB N="12" REF="001764_0019_0FB7CBFDCA8B8DF0"/>
We read Isa. XLVIII. 4. <HI>I know, that thou art Obstinate; and thy Neck is an Iron Sinew, and thy Brow Brass;</HI> An <HI>Heart</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as <HI>hard</HI> as <HI>Iron</HI> and <HI>Brass; O Hard-hearted Obstinacy! Unperswade∣ableness</HI> is <HI>Hard-heartedness.</HI> The <HI>Chil∣dren of Unperswadeableness</HI> are <HI>Hard-hearted</HI> ones. We read of <HI>An Heart hardened from the fear of God.</HI> An <HI>Heart</HI> that will not be <HI>perswaded</HI> heartily to <HI>Fear God,</HI> and Seek Him, and Serve Him; This is an <HI>Heart</HI> that is <HI>Har∣dened.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. An <HI>hard Heart</HI> is an <HI>In∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ensible</HI> one; an <HI>Heart</HI> that has no <HI>Sense,</HI> either of <HI>Blows</HI> given to it, or of <HI>Loads</HI> lying on it. A Man has the <HI>Blows</HI> of the Divine <HI>Wrath</HI> given to him. An <HI>hard Heart</HI> keeps him <HI>Insen∣sible</HI> of the <HI>Blows.</HI> He is Afflicted, but he is not Amended.

<P>The Sinner of an <HI>hard Heart,</HI> is one who <HI>hardens his own Heart.</HI> He confirms his own <HI>Hardness</HI> by a pre∣sumptuous Resolution to go on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sin.</P>
<P>There is a <HI>Natural hardness of Heart,</HI> which we are all Born withal. The <HI>Stone of the Heart</HI> is an Hereditary Distemper. But then, there is an <HI>Acquired hardness of Heart,</HI> which is when Men do Confirm and Augment and Increase their <HI>hardness,</HI> by going on to Sin with an <HI>high <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> against the Lord.</P>
<P>We will enquire more Particular <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>When, and How, does a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> his Heart?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="001764_0023_0FB7CC06CDC50E10"/>
He does it, Ah! wretched Sinner, Thou doest it, in such Things as these.</P>
<P>First. A Sinner does Render and Proclaim himself <HI>Hard-hearted</HI> in Sin, when he has made himself <HI>Impudent</HI> in it. We read of some; Ezek. III. 7. <HI>They are Impudent and Hard-hearted.</HI> Where there is a <HI>Brow ef Brass,</HI> there is an <HI>Heart of Stone.</HI> A Sinner has <HI>hardned</HI> his <HI>Heart,</HI> when he has got an hearty <HI>Courage</HI> for Sin, and is grown so Courageous in it, as that he can Sin <HI>Openly,</HI> and <HI>Publickly.</HI> If Men <HI>Declare their Sin like Sodom,</HI> they <HI>hide it not;</HI> and it may be said unto them; as in Jer. III. 3. <HI>Thou hast a Whores Fore-head, thou refusest to be A∣shamed.</HI> Confident Creature, If thou hadst not made thyself <HI>Hard-hearted,</HI> thou wouldest be more <HI>Ashamed.</HI> The <HI>hardness of Heart,</HI> arrives to a more considerable Obduration, when a Sinner can express a more singu∣lar Defiance of the Infinite GOD, a what he does. Those People have <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their Hearts,</HI> of whom the
<PB N="17" REF="001764_0024_0FB7CC0B793508E8"/>
Holy One may say, as in Isa. LXV. 3. <HI>'Tis a People that provoketh me to Anger, continually to my Face.</HI> People that can Sin in the special Presence of GOD; People whom the nearest Relation to GOD will not restrain from the grossest Impieties; People that will go reeking to or from the Table of the Lord, under the unre∣lenting Appetites of the vilest Im∣pieties; <HI>Church-Members</HI> that under a Mask of Religion will carry on a Course of Adulteries, or of Disho∣nesties. And so have those People, who are so <HI>Hardy</HI> as to make their Appeals to GOD for the Vindica∣tion of their Innocency, when GOD knows the Matters to be <HI>Unjust</HI> and <HI>Untrue,</HI> wherein He has been so dar∣ingly Appeal'd unto. <HI>O Hard-hearted Monster;</HI> What an <HI>hardenss of Heart</HI> hast thou contracted, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thou canst say, <HI>God knows,</HI>—a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to be so or so, when thou dost thyself know that it is not so!</P>
<P>Secondly. A Sinner has <HI>hardened his Heart</HI> in Sin, when he will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="18" REF="001764_0025_0FB7CC0D5E4BE7B8"/>
to Sin, with the utmost <HI>Hardiness,</HI> tho' he has the Light and Voice of his <HI>Conscience</HI> Reclaiming of him. To be so <HI>Hardy</HI> in Sin, as to trample on all the Remonstrances of <HI>Conscience</HI> against it, is to <HI>harden ones Heart</HI> in Sin. We find it Exemplified; 2 King. XVII. 13, 14. <HI>The Lord testified a∣gainst them, saying, Turn from your evil Ways: Yet they would not hear, but hardened their Necks. Conscience,</HI> the Deputy of God, pleads in his Name with many a Man, <HI>Oh! Do not the Abominable Thing!</HI> And yet, the <HI>Abominable Man</HI> will do that Thing. Such a Man has <HI>hardened</HI> his own <HI>Heart</HI> unto a Degree that is Horri∣ble! A Sinner <HI>hardens his Heart</HI> when he omits those Things, whereof his <HI>Conscience</HI> tells him, <HI>This is Commanded of GOD!</HI> But he yet more <HI>hardens his Heart,</HI> when he commits those Things, whereof his <HI>Conscience</HI> tells him, <HI>This is Forbidden by GOD!</HI> It may now be said of such,—what we read, Zech. VII. 12. <HI>They have made their Hearts as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Adamant Stone, lest they should hear
<PB N="19" REF="001764_0026_0FB7CC0E53D0C4E8"/>
the Law, and the Words which the Lord of Hosts hath sent by His Spirit.</HI> There are those, that won't forbear Sin∣ning, tho' their <HI>Conscience</HI> do stand before them with a flaming Sword, as the Angel did before <HI>Balaam;</HI> and say, <HI>Thy Way is Perverse before God; The Wrath of God will fall upon thee in this evil Way.</HI> O Desperate <HI>hardness of Heart!</HI> Wherein does the <HI>Heart of a Divel</HI> differ from it! <HI>Fool∣hardy, Self-hardened</HI> Sinner; What wouldest thou do if thou couldest? What less than push an Impotent Stab upon the Almighty GOD Him∣self? What less than <HI>stretch out thy Hand against God, and strengthen thy∣self against the Almighty, and run upon Him, upon the thick Bosses of His Buckler!</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. When a Sinner has an <HI>Impenitent Heart,</HI> then he has <HI>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rden∣ed his Heart.</HI> Those Things go, toge∣ther; Rom. II. 5. <HI>Thy Hardness and Impenitent Heart.</HI> A Sinner does <HI>har∣den his Heart,</HI> when he will by no Admonitions be brought home unto
<PB N="20" REF="001764_0027_0FB7CC11D2000840"/>
God, from all his Wandrings in the <HI>Wilderness of Sin.</HI> A Sinner is told, That Sin is an <HI>evil and a bitter Thing.</HI> He <HI>hardens his Heart,</HI> if notwithstand∣ing this, he will persist in Sin. He is told, That a CHRIST is the <HI>One Thing that is Needful.</HI> He <HI>hardens his Heart,</HI> if a CHRIST and His <HI>Great Salvation,</HI> be still neglected with him. He is told, That the Ways of Piety are <HI>pleasant Ways.</HI> He <HI>hardens his Heart,</HI> if still he remain a Stranger to these Ways. But, Oh! What have I now brought the Matter to! All that con∣tinue in their <HI>Unregeneracy,</HI> will find themselves included in the Charge. Unhappy Sinners, you stand every one of you all <HI>Indicted</HI> for this; <HI>That you have hardened your own Hearts:</HI> else you could not be what you are. There is no <HI>Unregenerate</HI> but what comes under that Unhappiness; Jer. IX. 26. <HI>Uncircumcised in Heart.</HI> Some that have been opened after their Death, have upon the Disse∣ction had a <HI>Stone</HI> found in their <HI>Heart;</HI> a <HI>Stone</HI> without a Metaphor.

<P>First. A Sinner by <HI>hardening</HI> his own <HI>Heart,</HI> falls into that matchless <HI>Mischief,</HI> that fearful <HI>Mischief,</HI> a <HI>penal hardness of Heart,</HI> Inflicted 'by the Judgment of God upon him. O <HI>Mischief</HI> whereto there is none to be

XIV. 8. <HI>The Lord hardened the Heart of Phara<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> 'Tis true, so far as <HI>hardness of Heart</HI> is a Sin; the Holy GOD is not th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Author and Father of it. We ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> say, <HI>'Tis not of the Father.</HI> We must say, <HI>No Man is tempted of God unto it.</HI> And yet there is an <HI>active Provi∣dence</HI> of God about that <HI>hardness of Heart,</HI> the <HI>Mischief</HI> whereof a Sinner that <HI>hardens</HI> his own <HI>Heart</HI> will fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> into. [See Psal. CV. 25.]</P>
<P>First. The Holy GOD in His Righteous <HI>Providence,</HI> withdraws His <HI>Grace</HI> from the Sinner that <HI>hardens his own Heart,</HI> and then, O Sinner what an Horrid <HI>hardness of Hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> will soon seize upon thee!

<P>Secondly. When a Sinner <HI>hardens his own Heart,</HI> the Righteous <HI>Provi∣dence</HI> of an Holy GOD, will cast be∣fore the Sinner such <HI>Objects,</HI> as he shall Abuse to strengthen the <HI>hardness of his Heart,</HI> how Perniciously, how Exceedingly! As the Potter sets his Clay in the Sun, and it is <HI>hardened</HI> here; so the great God, before

whom we are, as the <HI>Clay before the Potter,</HI> [And, <HI>whom He will, He har∣deneth!</HI>] when a Sinner <HI>hardens his own Heart,</HI> the great▪ God is provoked then to set him in very <HI>hardening</HI> Circumstances. Perhaps, the Sinner shall now be <HI>hardened,</HI> by being left in the Hands of Wicked Company. Among all the <HI>Engines of Hell,</HI> there is not upon the Face of the Earth a greater <HI>Hardener!</HI> 'Tis from a Dis∣pensation of the Holy God, that the Sinner becomes intimately Acquain∣ted with <HI>Company</HI> that shall teach him the <HI>Arts of Sin,</HI> and spur him to the Practice of them; <HI>Company</HI> that shall instill into him Notions that dispose him to Atheism, and prepare him for <HI>all manner of Sin and Blasphemy; Company</HI> that shall pre∣judice him against the Best Men and Things, and so lay the Dark Fetters of Death upon him. So be∣coming a <HI>Companion</HI> of such <HI>Fools,</HI> Sinner, Thy Heart is <HI>hardened,</HI> and thy Immortal Soul destroy'd. But then, there is another dismal Occa∣sion
<PB N="25" REF="001764_0032_0FB7CC215021E200"/>
which brings an <HI>hardness</HI> upon the <HI>Heart</HI> of many a Sinner, which is forever to be deplored. It is in the Scandalous Falls of such as have made a fair and high Profession of Christianity. By the Disposal of God, it comes to pass, that when a Sinner has been <HI>hardening</HI> his own <HI>Heart,</HI> his Lot shall be cast, where some that every body thought <HI>First-Rate Christians,</HI> fall into Scandalous, Amazing, Infandous Actions. The Divel knew, what a Game he should pray, when he drew those Persons into such Actions! The perverse Use the Sinner makes of what he sees, is to conclude; <HI>Well, All Reli∣gion is a Cheat. If I do the worst Things in the World, I do nothing, but that in which the greatest Pretenders to Religion indulge themselves!</HI> The Foolish Sin∣ner is now <HI>hardened,</HI> and the Bars of the Pit are about him forever!</P>
<P>Thirdly. A Sinner that <HI>hardens his own Heart,</HI> is by the Righteous Pro∣vidence of the Holy GOD, left in the Hand of <HI>Satan;</HI> And Oh! what
<PB N="26" REF="001764_0033_0FB7CC2289ECF078"/>
a <HI>Satanic Hardness</HI> will the Heart of such a Sinner be soon congeled in∣to! Of Impious ones, we read, 2 Cor. IV. 4. <HI>The God of this World has Blinded their Minds.</HI> 'Tis the same, who <HI>hardens their Hearts.</HI> An <HI>Ahab</HI> will be <HI>hardened</HI> with a Vengeance when the <HI>Lying Spirit</HI> shall have a Permission for the Seducing of him. An <HI>hardened Heart</HI> is a <HI>seared Heart.</HI> But it is the <HI>Divel,</HI> that brings from Hell, those Hot Irons, by which the <HI>Heart</HI> of a Sinner comes to be so <HI>Hardened</HI> and <HI>Seared.</HI> Anatomical Observations have told us, That the <HI>Stone</HI> whereof some have died, be∣ing opened, a <HI>Snake</HI> has been found in it. When the Heart of a Sinner is <HI>hardened,</HI> there is the <HI>Old Serpent</HI> in the <HI>Stone,</HI> to make it so. A Sin∣ner by <HI>hardening his own Heart,</HI> In∣vites the <HI>Divel</HI> to take Possession of it.

that be, which has the <HI>Divel</HI> filling of it! Forlorn <HI>Ananias,</HI> If <HI>Satan fill thy Heart,</HI> what, what wilt thou come to?</P>
<P>But then, Finally. When God <HI>Judicially</HI> gives a Sinner up to <HI>hard∣ness of Heart,</HI> what Sin will there be, which the Sinner will not fall into? 'Tis a dreadful Word; LXXXI. 12.<HI>I gave them up unto their own Hearts Lust, and they walked in their own Counsels.</HI> Oh! the Snares and Pits into which now their <HI>Walk</HI> will car∣ry them! The Doom which the Ho∣ly GOD now passes on the <HI>hardened Sinner,</HI> is; <HI>He is Unjust, and he shall be still Unjust. He is Filthy, and he shall be Filthy still!</HI> The Sinner is now left unto the enslaving Power of Sin: He will now <HI>serve diverse Lusts;</HI> and he will now stick at no Sin that shall be proposed unto him.

Secondly. A Sinner by <HI>hardening</HI> his own <HI>Heart,</HI> must also fall into all that <HI>Mischief,</HI> which <HI>every</HI> S<HI>in,</HI> as well as an <HI>hard Heart</HI> has entail'd upon it. <HI>SIN,</HI> what is the <HI>Wages</HI> of it? Our youngest Children have this Instruction given them, as part of the <HI>Milk for our Babes; The Wages of Sin is Death.</HI> Now, this <HI>Death,</HI> yea, all of this terrible <HI>Death,</HI> is what a Sinner by <HI>hardening</HI> his <HI>Heart</HI> will fall into: All the <HI>Curse</HI> due to Sin; all the <HI>Wo</HI> brought by Sin; all the <HI>Wrath</HI> to which by Sin the Sinner becomes obnoxious. Verily, O <HI>Hard-hearted</HI> Sinner, Nothing less than <HI>Destruction</HI> will be thy Portion; A <HI>Destruction from God,</HI> if thou were not horribly <HI>Hardened,</HI> would be a <HI>Terror</HI> unto thee. Lo, the Great GOD <HI>ut∣ters His Voice,</HI> and that a <HI>mighty Voice,</HI> in those Words; XXIX. 1. <HI>He that being often Reproved, hardens his Neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without Remedy.</HI></P>

their <HI>Hearts</HI> in Sin, expose themselves. There is that Word ful∣fill'd upon them; Ezek.

III. 5. <HI>He looked round about on them with Anger, being grieved for the hardness of their Hearts.</HI> He now <HI>looks round about</HI> our Congregation; and where he sees any-still going on in their Sins, He says upon them, <HI>Oh!

<P>II. But I am now, to Address you, with an EXHORTATION, which I shall bring you in Terms which the Holy Spirit of God has prepared for you; even those Terms; Heb. III. 7, 8. <HI>To Day if you will hear His Voice, harden nor your Hearts.</HI> And, Oh! that the Holy Spirit would <HI>this Day</HI> set
<PB N="33" REF="001764_0040_0FB7CC3A16624538"/>
in, to make this <HI>Exhortation</HI> become Effectual! <HI>O Thou irresistible Spirit of▪Grace, Do thou break our Hearts, and make us Tremble at all those Things that will harden them.</HI></P>
<P>That our dear People may take a due Course, to be delivered from the <HI>Mischiefs</HI> of an <HI>hardened Heart,</HI> let them now hearken to the Counsels of God.</P>
<P>First. Look up to GOD your SA∣VIOUR, for <HI>so great Salvation.</HI> Oh! Pray hard, Oh! Cry hard, unto the <HI>God of the Spirits of all Flesh,</HI> that He would save you from an <HI>hard Heart,</HI> and give you an <HI>Heart of Flesh.</HI> You have a sweet Promise of such a Ble∣ssing; Ezek. XXXVI. 26. <HI>A new Heart will I give unto you, and a new Spirit will I put within you; and I will take away the Stony Heart out of your Flesh, and will give you an Heart of Flesh.</HI> O plead so Gracious a Promise; and urge; <HI>O my God, Be it unto me accor∣ding to thy Word; and let a soft Heart be given to me!</HI> It is not in Men or
<PB N="34" REF="001764_0041_0FB7CC3B8E4D0E78"/>
Means, to Soften an <HI>hard Heart.</HI> As they said of Old, <HI>Who shall roll away the Stone from the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Sepulchre?</HI> Even so, may we say, <HI>Who shall take away the Stone from the Heart, which keeps it Rotting in the Grave of a sinful Estrangement from God?</HI> Verily, None but GOD can do such a Thing. 'Tis a <HI>Creating</HI> Work. As he said, <HI>Create in me a Clean Heart, O God;</HI> so must we say, <HI>If ever I have a soft Heart, O God, it must be of thy Creating in me!</HI> He that can change a <HI>Stone,</HI> into a Child of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and none but He, can change an Heart of <HI>Stone,</HI> and rescue a Sinner from the <HI>Mischiefs</HI> of it. O <HI>Hard-hearted</HI> Sinner, look up∣to thy SAVIOUR. Be not so <HI>Stout∣hearted,</HI> as to be always <HI>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r</HI> from this <HI>Righteousness▪</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. There are <HI>Heart-breaking Meditations,</HI> which you are to be ad∣vised unto; There are <HI>Specificks</HI> a∣gainst an <HI>hard Heart</HI> in the <HI>Medita∣tions.</HI> Of the Things which are <HI>hard∣dened</HI> by the Cold and Frost of our <HI>Winter,</HI> we read; Psal. CXLVII. 18.
<PB N="35" REF="001764_0042_0FB7CC3FC8A33E20"/>
<HI>He sendeth out his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> them.</HI> It might indeed be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>breaking</HI> Subject for your Medita∣tions; <HI>How Foolishly and Fearfully have I ruined myself by my Sins against the Glorious God!</HI> It might be a yet more <HI>Heart-breaking</HI> Subject for your Meditations; <HI>What a shameful Disin∣genuity has there been, and how Ungrate∣fully have I done, in my Sins against the Glorious GOD?</HI> But then proceed, and <HI>Meditate</HI> on what the <HI>Word</HI> of God has declared unto you, con∣cerning His Infinite <HI>Mercy,</HI> ready to Receive and Pardon you after all your Sins. Methinks, the <HI>sending forth</HI> of this <HI>Word,</HI> should <HI>Melt</HI> your <HI>Hearts</HI> within you. Behold the <HI>Heart</HI> of your Saviour yearning over you; Behold Him shedding His <HI>Heart-Blood</HI> for your Sins; Hear Him calling to you, <HI>O poor Sinner, yet come unto me, and I will not cast thee out.</HI> Certainly, to Meditate on such a <HI>Word,</HI> will <HI>Melt</HI> your <HI>Hearts</HI> within you. My Friend, What an Heart hast thou, if steeping it in the <HI>Blood</HI> of thy Saviour dissolve it not!</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="001764_0043_0FB7CC455E4DD3E8"/>
Lastly. Beware, Oh! Beware of such Things, as will have a Tenden∣cy to <HI>harden</HI> your <HI>Hearts;</HI> Beware of all <HI>Heart-hardeners,</HI> and as you love your Souls avoid them.</P>
<P>Take the Warnings of God If you are in hazard of having your <HI>Hearts hardened</HI> by the Society of any Ungodly People; Shun them, Fly them, no longer Assotiate with them; Oh! <HI>Forsake the Foolish and live.</HI> Be warned therewithal, That all <HI>Sins against Knowledge</HI> are mighty <HI>hardeners of the Heart;</HI> The oftner you Repeat such <HI>known Sins,</HI> the more will you <HI>harden your Hearts.</HI> But no <HI>Sins</HI> have a more fatal Effi∣cacy this way, than the <HI>Sins of Un∣chastity.</HI> Ah! Bewitching Sins, How do you take away the <HI>Heart</HI> of them that Wallow in you! What <HI>Infatua∣tions</HI> do they bring upon those tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> venture on them! When People have once abandoned themselves un∣to the <HI>Sins of Unchastity,</HI> with what <HI>hardness of Heart</HI> will they sleight a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Calls of Heaven, to Reform
<PB N="37" REF="001764_0044_0FB7CC4815E75490"/>
their Evil-doings? With what Stu∣pidity do they go on from one Vileness to another, and <HI>wax worse and worse?</HI> How Stupidly do they lay aside all Consideration of their own Interest; and become like <HI>Bruit Beasts,</HI> and anon <HI>Perish in their own Corruption!</HI> God leaves them; Sa∣tan takes them; Nothing will bring them to any Good. When they are in <HI>Chains</HI> for their Wickedness, even <HI>then</HI> they will Repeat it, being held in the <HI>Chains</HI> of their Wickedness.</P>
<P>Of this we have a very Tragical Instance now before our Eyes. One who by <HI>hardening</HI> her <HI>Heart</HI> has brought herself into wonderful <HI>Mis∣chief;</HI> and continues to <HI>harden</HI> her <HI>Heart,</HI> after the wondrous <HI>Mischief</HI> has come upon her like a Whirl∣wind from the Lord.</P>
<P>Ah, poor Creature; Thou hast been Guilty of many <HI>Sins,</HI> and Hei∣nous ones. But, Oh! Don't add this to all the rest, this Comprehensive one, this Atrocious one; To <HI>harden</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="001764_0045_0FB7CC4D8A07B020"/>
thy <HI>Heart</HI> after all, and so to bind all fast upon thy Soul forever.</P>
<P>God has done a dreadful Thing upon thee, in leaving thee to a Crime for which thou art now as one <HI>Wicked overmuch,</HI> to <HI>Dye before thy Time,</HI> and e're twenty five Years have rolled over thee, the Sword of Justice with an <HI>untimely Stroak</HI> must cut thee off. But it will be a much more dreadful Thing, if thou art left after all unto an <HI>hard Heart,</HI> that will not Repent of thy Abominati∣ons, and of thy <HI>Bloodguiltiness.</HI></P>
<P>If thou hadst not <HI>hardened</HI> thy own <HI>Heart</HI> exceedingly, Oh! what Things would be seen upon thee; other Things than are yet seen upon thee! Verily, A <HI>soft Heart</HI> would Mourn and Weep and Bleed, for a Life sweell'd away in Sin against the Glorious GOD. A <HI>soft Heart</HI> would soon Drown thee in Tears, from the View of the doleful Things thy Sin has brought upon thee. A <HI>soft Heart</HI> would make thee own the <HI>Justice</HI> of God and Man in what is
<PB N="39" REF="001764_0046_0FB7CC4ECBA44150"/>
now done unto thee; and would Si∣lence thy Froward and Fretful and Furious Gnashing upon such as thou hast no Cause to treat with so much transported Fury.</P>
<P>It <HI>breaks</HI> the <HI>Hearts</HI> of the Good People in the Place, to see thy <HI>De∣plorable State:</HI> They are concerned, when they see thy <HI>Lamentable State:</HI> But above all, to see, that thou art thyself no more concerned for it; no more affected with it; so little <HI>Broken</HI> in <HI>Heart.</HI> And shall not thy <HI>own Heart</HI> at length be <HI>Broken,</HI> when thy <HI>own State</HI> comes into thy Consi∣deration?</P>
<P>One once could say, <HI>God makes my Heart Soft, and the Almighty Trou∣bles me.</HI> And will it not <HI>make thy Heart Soft,</HI> when thou thinkest on the amazing <HI>Trouble,</HI> which thou shalt feel from the Wrath of the <HI>Almighty</HI> GOD, if thou <HI>Dye in thy Sins?</HI> Verily, All the <HI>Sorrows</HI> thou seest here, are but the <HI>Beginning of Sorrows,</HI> if thou art not by a <HI>broken Heart</HI> prepared for the Salvation of God.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="001764_0047_0FB7CC5046761D20"/>
But then, What an <HI>Heart-breaking</HI> Thought is this? <HI>Margaret,</HI> There is yet <HI>Mercy</HI> for thee, if thou wilt not by an <HI>hard Heart</HI> refuse the Mer∣cy; The <HI>Mercy,</HI> thro' which <HI>Rah<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Harlot perished not;</HI> The <HI>Mercy,</HI> thro' which <HI>Mary Magdalene</HI> had her <HI>many Sins forgiven her;</HI> This <HI>Mer∣cy</HI> is ready to do Wonders for thee. A <HI>Merciful</HI> Saviour Invites thee; O <HI>come unto me, and I will do Wonders for thee.</HI></P>
<P>Come and fall down before Him, and beg the Blessings of a <HI>soft Heart</HI> at His Gracious Hands. I know not of any <HI>Advice</HI> that can be so Proper, or so Needful for thee, as this; No <HI>Prayer</HI> of so much Importance to be made by thee as this.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ignorance</HI> which lays <HI>Chains of Darkness</HI> upon thee, is a sore En∣cumbrance on thy Essays for turning to God. Yet thou art not so <HI>Ignorant,</HI> but thou canst make this Petition to thy SAVIOUR. <HI>Lord, soften this hard Heart of mine!</HI> And, <HI>Lord, Be∣stow a New, and a Clean, and a Soft Heart upon life!</HI> And, <HI>God be Merciful to me a Sinner; yea, an Hard-hearted Sinner!</HI></P>
<P>Now, May the Gracious Lord accordingly look down upon thee.</P>

in, and for, and by, one of these <HI>Malefactors,</HI> is what will call us to be still Astonished. Of these two <HI>Malefactors,</HI> wherein some find a Type of those two People, the <HI>Jews</HI> and the <HI>Gentiles;</HI> the one continued an obdurate and obstinate Wretch, and as he lived so he died, Aban∣doned of God. The other became a <HI>true Penitent,</HI> and an astonishing Monument, of what the <HI>Sovereign Grace</HI> of God may do for the worst of Sinners in the World. He em∣ploy'd the last six or seven Hours of his Life on the Cross, at such a rate, that one may see the whole <HI>Race of Christianity</HI> run in half a Day and the Ground wonderfully swal∣lowed in a most <HI>expeditious Piety.</HI> The common Opinion is, That the Grace of God <HI>first</HI> found him here; and that he came to the Cross, no other than a <HI>finished Villain,</HI> but was here in his last Moments turned into a <HI>Child</HI> and <HI>Saint</HI> of God.

and very much Enlighten him, and Rectify him, while he was in the <HI>Gaol,</HI> none can say how long before his Execution; and that he might come to the <HI>Cross</HI> in some degree, furnished with that <HI>Principle of Grace,</HI> which now broke forth, in its most lively and wondrous Operations.

<P>The first Effort, which we see of the <HI>Divine Principle,</HI> in the Soul of this <HI>Penitent,</HI> is, His Rebuke upon his <HI>Fellow-sufferer.</HI> He saw and heard the Outrages of the Monster; he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Outrageous Affronts unto the Glorious Redeemer, whom his own Soul now Glorified as the <HI>Son of God,</HI> and the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Dead;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he Faithfully and Zealously <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him for his Behaviour▪ where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he proclaimed that the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of God</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> horribly wanting in him▪</P>

Dreadful Thing for People in a Dying Hour, to be without the FEAR OF GOD.</Q>
<P>I. The first observable Thing that now occurs unto us, is; That Real, Vital, Saving RELIGION does consist in the <HI>Fear of God;</HI> A Religious <HI>Fear</HI> of the Glorious God.</P>
<P>The Thing which the Convert Inculcated on his Friend under <HI>Con∣demnation,</HI> is, All that <HI>Religion,</HI> which will bring unto <HI>Salvation.</HI> The Term used for it, is, <HI>The Fear of God.</HI> The Censure due to a Man of no <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eli∣gion,</HI> is; <HI>Thou dost not Fear God.</HI></P>
<P>There are some general Expre∣ssive; and Instructive Terms, by which the <HI>Whole</HI> of <HI>Practical Religion</HI> is de∣scribed unto us. It is called, The <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> of God, a <HI>Trust</HI> an <HI>Hope,</HI> a <HI>De∣light</HI> in Him, a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> of God, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Calling</HI> on Him. It is called, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> and <HI>Repentance,</HI> and <HI>Newness of Life,</HI> and, <HI>A good Conversation in Christ</HI> and, <HI>A patient Continuance in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> doing.</HI> Oh!

by these Discriptions of Re∣ligion; Try, See, Find, whether the Experience of such Things will En∣title you to the Denomination of <HI>Truly Religions.</HI></P>
<P>But, the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> is one of those notable Terms. And now, <HI>Come ye Children</HI> who would Profess <HI>Religion,</HI> and be found the <HI>truly Reli∣gious</HI> Children of God; <HI>I will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you what is that Fear of God,</HI> which is demanded of you.</P>
<P>First. In true <HI>Religion,</HI> the <HI>Fear</HI> of the <HI>Divine Displeasure,</HI> whereto all Sinners are obnoxious, drives a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> unto the JESUS, who <HI>saves His Peo∣ple from their Sins.</HI> The <HI>Fear of God</HI> contains in it, a <HI>Fear</HI> of His <HI>Displea∣sure,</HI> to which we are by Sin become obnoxious. One that has the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> can say, <HI>Lord, My Flesh trembles for fear of thy Displeasure, and I am a∣fraid of the Judgments to which my Sin exposes me.</HI> But so far the <HI>Divels</HI> themselves may go; They <HI>tremble;</HI> worse than <HI>Divels</HI> they who do not so! But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Fear</HI> wherewith we are
<PB N="50" REF="001764_0057_0FB7CC75D78020E8"/>
to be <HI>moved,</HI> must put us upon doing what we are to do, that we may be <HI>Saved.</HI> It must cause our <HI>Flight</HI> unto the only SAVIOUR. This is the <HI>Fear of God</HI> in the right Notion of it. Thus you have been <HI>taught</HI> it in Psal. CXLVII. 11. <HI>The Lord taketh Pleasure in them that fear Him, that hope in His Mercy.</HI> It is the MES∣SIAH of God, in and by whom His <HI>Mercy</HI> reaches us. A <HI>Fear</HI> without <HI>Hope</HI> of that <HI>Mercy,</HI> is the <HI>Despair</HI> of them that are cast into <HI>outer Dark∣ness.</HI> The <HI>Fear</HI> which Awakens and Animates our <HI>Flight</HI> unto that <HI>Mercy,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <HI>Fear of God</HI> in the True, Clear, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Operation of it.</P>

Secondly. In True <HI>Religion,</HI> the Religious <HI>Fear of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> against God, Restrains and Governs the Soul, and makes every <HI>Sinful</HI> Thing, a <HI>Fearful</HI> and an <HI>Hateful</HI> Thing unto the Soul. When the <HI>Fear of Sin</HI> Re∣strains and Governs the Mind ex∣ceedingly, then the Man <HI>Fears the Lord exceedingly.</HI> The <HI>Fear of Sin,</HI> is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> main Ingredient in the <HI>Fear of God.</HI> We read. Prov. VIII. 13. <HI>The fear of the Lord is to hate Evil.</HI> The Man who <HI>Fears God,</HI> is one who <HI>shuns Evil;</HI> one who has an Horror of SIN, as the <HI>worst Evil.</HI> Whatever such a Man takes to be a <HI>Sin,</HI> he is <HI>afraid</HI> of it; he would not be more <HI>afraid</HI> of a <HI>Fiery Furnace.</HI> A <HI>Tempta∣tion to Sin,</HI> is rejected by such a Man, with a vast Abhorrence of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fear of Sin</HI> in True <HI>Religion,</HI> issues from an Awe, and an <HI>awful Sight</HI> which a Believer has of some Things that are <HI>not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een.</HI></P>
<P>First; The <HI>Presence</HI> of GOD, is Awful to a Man that <HI>Fears</HI> Him. The <HI>Fear of God</HI> will make a Man
<PB N="53" REF="001764_0060_0FB7CC7C181607E8"/>
Realize the <HI>Eye of God.</HI> One that <HI>Fears God,</HI> is under the Power of this Apprehension; <HI>O Lord, Thou art ac∣quainted with all my ways: O Lord, There is not a Word in my Tongue, but thou knowest it: O Lord, Thou knowest my Thoughts afar off.</HI> This makes him <HI>afraid</HI> of every Sin; <HI>afraid</HI> of even the most <HI>Secret Sin.</HI> If a Sinful and Vicious or Foolish <HI>Thought</HI> break into his Mind, he is <HI>afraid</HI> of afford∣ing it a Lodging there. An Omni∣present GOD, is much Considered, much Reverenced, by the Man that, <HI>Fears Him.</HI> Such an one may say, <HI>I have set the Lord always before me.</HI> He Labours, he Watches, he Wishes, That he may behave himself <HI>always as before the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Again; The <HI>Judgment</HI> of GOD is Awful to such a Man. The <HI>Fear of God</HI> assures a Man of a <HI>Judgment to come;</HI> and it makes him <HI>Tremble</HI> at the Apprehension of being Pro∣nounced, <HI>Guilty,</HI> in that <HI>Judgment, The time of the Dead, when they shall be Judged,</HI> is the Time, when a <HI>Re∣ward</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="001764_0061_0FB7CC861DE1A0B0"/>
shall be given to them that <HI>Fear God.</HI> They that <HI>Fear God,</HI> have their Eye much on the Time, when the <HI>Dead</HI> shall be <HI>Raised</HI> and <HI>Judged,</HI> and on the <HI>Reward</HI> which is then to be given to the Children of Men. One that <HI>Fears God,</HI> is very Thought∣ful of the Day, when we must <HI>every one stand before the Judgment Seat of Christ;</HI> the Day when <HI>God will bring every Work into Judgment.</HI> The Dread of this Day, is to such a Man, <HI>The Terror of the Lord.</HI> His great Study is, <HI>Oh! That in the Day of God, I may give up my Account with Joy, and not with Grief! Oh! That I may do nothing that may prove to my Disadvantage in the Day when I give up my Account unto God!</HI> The <HI>Fear of God</HI> is not in the Man, who is not so disposed, so affected. I am sure, in the Convert on the <HI>Cross,</HI> these things were very Visible.</P>
<P>Thirdly. True <HI>Religion,</HI> which <HI>Fears God,</HI> will Religiously and Con∣scienciously endeavour to <HI>Serve God.</HI> The <HI>Worshippers</HI> of GOD, are called,
<PB N="55" REF="001764_0062_0FB7CC87FB1D0A98"/>
<HI>Those theat fear Him.</HI> The <HI>Worship</HI> and <HI>Service</HI> of GOD, is called, <HI>His Fear.</HI> We read of one, Act. X. 2. <HI>He was a Devout Man, and one that feared God, and prayed unto God always.</HI> The <HI>Fear of God</HI> will put a Man upon all the <HI>Devotions</HI> of a <HI>Godly Life.</HI> The <HI>Fear of God</HI> will bring forth <HI>Prayer to God:</HI> Secret Prayer, Private Prayer, Public Prayer; <HI>All Prayer with Per∣severance</HI> in it. When Men <HI>cast off</HI> this <HI>Fear,</HI> then they <HI>restrain Prayer.</HI> The <HI>Fear of God,</HI> will fill the Life of a Man with <HI>Work for God.</HI> It will make a Man <HI>Abound in the Work of the Lord.</HI> It will make a Man <HI>Diligent in the Work</HI> of both His Callings, the Spiritual and the Temporal. Conti∣nual <HI>Acknowledgments</HI> of God, are in the Endeavour of the Man that <HI>Fears Him.</HI> We are so called upon▪ Prov. XXIII. 17. <HI>Be thou in the fear of the Lord all the Day long.</HI> 'Tis done in our conformity to that Rule of Piety, <HI>Acknowledge the Lord in all the Ways.</HI> This <HI>Fear of God</HI> will bring a Man to that Perswasion, <HI>I have to do
<PB N="56" REF="001764_0063_0FB7CC894F508458"/>
with God in every Thing.</HI> And from so sweet a Root, as the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> there will issue and flourish a <HI>Love to Man.</HI> The <HI>Fear of God</HI> will make a Man afraid of doing or wishing any Hurt unto his Neighbour; It will make him contrive to be a Blessing in his Neighbourhood; It will make him a <HI>Good Man,</HI> and a <HI>Doer of Good.</HI> This, this is to <HI>Fear God.</HI></P>
<P>But, certainly, you can scarce hear these Instructions, without expecting two Things to be immediately pres∣sed upon you.</P>
<P>First. O view yourselves in this <HI>Impartial Glass,</HI> and see what you are Try and see, whether you have the <HI>Fear of God</HI> in you, or no. It was enquired; Psal. XXV. 12. <HI>What Man is he that fears the Lord?</HI> Let every one of us make the Enquiry, <HI>Am I the Man that fears the Lord?</HI> Let there be no such <HI>Token of Death</HI> upon us, as may give Cause for our being so questioned thereupon, <HI>Dost not thou fear God?</HI> Examine, Whether upon the Question, you can say, <HI>Yes, I
<PB N="57" REF="001764_0064_0FB7CC8B15EC1368"/>
prize CHRIST, I hate Sin, I walk with GOD, and Labour to please Him.</HI> Oh! be not at Rest until you come to this.</P>
<P>Secondly. You <HI>see,</HI> and, Oh! will you not <HI>seek,</HI> a <HI>Blessing</HI> of which you have cause to be exceedingly, un∣speakably desirous. 'Tis, The <HI>Fear of God.</HI> A Man cannot infuse the <HI>Fear of God</HI> into his own Heart. It is the <HI>Grace</HI> of GOD. Oh! Let us make our Supplication to GOD, for this <HI>Grace.</HI> If any of you <HI>lack this Wisdom;</HI> this <HI>Beginning of Wisdom,</HI>—Let him <HI>Ask it of God.</HI> It was an hopeful Cha∣racter of some; Neh. I. 11. <HI>Thy Ser∣vants who desire to fear thy Name.</HI> Oh! may all of you come into it; and make that Petition, <HI>O Great GOD; Let there be an Heart in me to fear thee!</HI> 'Tis a Petition to be made Im∣portunately, to be made Continu∣ally!</P>
<P>II. The Second observable Thing which we have before us, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; That when People who <HI>suffer Evil Things,</HI> continue to <HI>do Evil Things,</HI> it argues
<PB N="58" REF="001764_0065_0FB7CC9518898268"/>
that the <HI>Fear of God</HI> is wanting in them. Oh! <HI>Grievous</HI> Thing! Did the Sun ever look upon a more <HI>Griev∣ous</HI> Thing! Ah, Forlorn Soul, where∣in such a <HI>Grievous</HI> Thing shall be exemplified! When a poor Man <HI>Con∣demned</HI> unto various and grievous <HI>Miseries,</HI> went on in Gross <HI>Mis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar∣riages,</HI> and the <HI>Cross</HI> itself would not make him turn unto God, this pro∣cured that Righteous Reproof unto the miserable Creature, <HI>Dost not thou fear God?</HI> It shew'd great Want of the <HI>Fear of God.</HI></P>
<P>Let us a little Inform ourselves, How it is.</P>
<P>First. Some that <HI>suffer</HI> very sad Things, do not Reform the <HI>Sins,</HI> which have brought their <HI>Sufferings▪</HI> It may be said of some, as in Jer. V. 3. <HI>O Lord, Thou hast Consumed them, but they have refused to receive Corre∣ction.</HI> Our <HI>Afflictions</HI> come to us, with a <HI>Message</HI> from God. The <HI>Mes∣sage,</HI> and <HI>Language</HI> of them, is; <HI>Oh! Repent of thy Way, and of thy Doings, which have procured these things unto
<PB N="59" REF="001764_0066_0FB7CC98FB182C80"/>
thee; Of the Wickedness, which has pro∣cured thee all this Bitterness.</HI> Yet many Afflicted ones there are, whose Af∣flictions do not bring them to <HI>Re∣pentance.</HI> Their <HI>Iniquity</HI> is not thereby <HI>Purged,</HI> and the <HI>Fruit</HI> thereof is not the <HI>taking away of their Sin.</HI> The <HI>Duty</HI> they Omitted before their Afflictions, tho' they are Afflicted, yet they continue in their <HI>Omission</HI> of it. The <HI>Trespass</HI> they committed before their Afflictions, tho' they are Afflicted, yet they continue in their <HI>Commission</HI> of it. Tho' they have <HI>born Chastise∣ment,</HI> they are not Inquisitive what those <HI>Offences</HI> may be, for which they have been Chastised; and they do not say, <HI>What is meet surely</HI> to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> unto God, <HI>I will not Offend any more▪</HI> Tho' the Holy One have <HI>Stricken</HI> them for their <HI>Sinning</HI> against Him, yet they are not more <HI>afraid of Sin∣ning,</HI> than formerly. Tho' God be <HI>vexing them with all Adversity;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it an <HI>Evil World</HI> unto them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they are not more weaned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Love of the World.</HI> Tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="60" REF="001764_0067_0FB7CC99E54657D8"/>
an <HI>Afflicted Life,</HI> yet they do not lead a more Prayerful, a more Fruitful, a more <HI>Heavenly Life;</HI> a Life of more Communion with God. Tho' the <HI>Rod</HI> be Employ'd upon them, yet they do not <HI>Hear the Red.</HI> They have their <HI>Cross,</HI> but no <HI>Peaceable Fruits of Righteousness</HI> growing upon it.</P>
<P>Secondly. Some who <HI>Sinned</HI> be∣fore they <HI>Suffered,</HI> fall into New and more <HI>Sins,</HI> after their <HI>Sufferings. Evil Men wax worse and worse</HI> under those Things, which they should have grown <HI>Better</HI> upon. We read of such <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Incurable;</HI> 2 Chron. XXVIII. 22. <HI>In the time of his Distress,</HI> did he <HI>Tre∣spass yet more against the Lord.</HI> There are many <HI>Fools,</HI> who <HI>because of their Transgressions, and because of their Ini∣quities, are Afflicted.</HI> And yet they add <HI>new Transgressions,</HI> and add <HI>new Iniquities,</HI> unto the old Score of their Enormities; This they do <HI>after</HI> their Afflictions. They have <HI>Sinned,</HI> and they have <HI>Smarted;</HI> And, <HI>for all this they have Sinned still;</HI> and they have
<PB N="61" REF="001764_0068_0FB7CC9B6FC2C2C8"/>
added <HI>new Sins</HI> unto the vast Heap of their Provocations; and been more Sinful, in further Out-breakings, and Outrages of Impiety. 'Tis especially thus, when People do like the Wick∣ed <HI>Thief</HI> on the Cross, <HI>Blaspheme</HI> God under their Afflictions; When they are full of <HI>Discontent,</HI> full of <HI>Impati∣ence,</HI> full of <HI>Murmuring</HI> under their Afflictions; full of <HI>Envy</HI> against those who do not endure the like Afflicti∣ons; When they take <HI>Indirect Courses</HI> to escape their Afflictions, <HI>unlawful Methods</HI> to abate their Afflictions. That ever the World should have such <HI>Monsters</HI> in it!</P>
<P>Thirdly. Such <HI>Incorrigible</HI> ones discover themselves to be destitute of the <HI>Fear of God.</HI> We may on this oc∣casion say that in Psal. XXXVI. 1. <HI>The Transgression of the Wicked saith within my Heart, There is no fear of God before his Eyes.</HI> The Charge may be very plainly proved upon them.</P>
<P>First. If we see <HI>Suffering<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> upon <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> People,</HI> God expects that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Him, and improve in all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="62" REF="001764_0069_0FB7CC9E9EF97D38"/>
upon such Admonitions. Thus we read; Zech. UI. 7. <HI>I have cut off the Nations,—I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive Instruction.</HI> Surely then, if we do not <HI>receive Instruction</HI> from Suffering upon <HI>ourselves,</HI> 'tis plain, that we do not <HI>Fear God.</HI> When <HI>others</HI> are Scourged, God expects that <HI>we</HI> should all <HI>Hear and Fear, and no more do Wickedly.</HI> Surely then, if they that are <HI>under the same Condemna∣tion,</HI> go on to Sin under their Scour∣ges, these do not <HI>Fear God.</HI> There can be no doubt of this!</P>
<P>Secondly. They who <HI>get no Good</HI> by their <HI>Sufferings,</HI> forget that they have to do with God in their <HI>Suffer∣ings.</HI> Were People sensible that God sends their <HI>Sufferings</HI> on them, and <HI>comes looking for the Fruit</HI> of His Dis∣pensations, they would certainly <HI>get some Good</HI> by them. We read, Job V. 6, 8. <HI>Affliction comes not forth of the Dust, neither doth Trouble spring out of the Ground.—I would seek unto God.</HI> Were we sensible, that we have to do with an Higher than all <HI>Second
<PB N="63" REF="001764_0070_0FB7CCA3C0C45D88"/>
Causes</HI> in our Sufferings, they would certainly bring us nearer to God. But now, if Men cast off the <HI>Sense</HI> of God, it is plain, they also cast off the <HI>Fear</HI> of God. It is undoubtedly, so.</P>
<P>Thirdly. They that are <HI>Incorrigible</HI> Sinners under Sufferings, are unque∣stionably <HI>Unconverted</HI> Sinners. We read; Psal. CXIX. 71. <HI>It is good for me, that I have been Afflicted, that I might learn thy Statutes.</HI> It is then <HI>good for us</HI> that we have Suffered any Humbling Things, when we are quickened in and by our <HI>Sufferings,</HI> to Learn, and to Love, and to Do the <HI>Statutes</HI> of God. There is a true <HI>Conversion</HI> to God, in doing so. Un∣der Sufferings, to be brought into the <HI>Frames,</HI> and unto the <HI>Rules</HI> of a <HI>New-Creature;</HI> under <HI>Sufferings,</HI> to be brought into the <HI>Covenant</HI> of God, and of His Grace, and unto a con∣sent unto all the Articles of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> un∣der <HI>Sufferings,</HI> to Embrace a Precious CHRIST, in all His <HI>Offices,</HI> for and with all His <HI>Benefits;</HI> And under
<PB N="64" REF="001764_0071_0FB7CCA6C937C1A8"/>
<HI>Sufferings</HI> to have all Sin rendred A∣bominable to us; This is to <HI>get Good</HI> by <HI>Sufferings.</HI> But they who are Strangers to these things, are <HI>Un∣converted</HI> Sinners. And all <HI>Unconvert∣ed</HI> Sinners, are Strangers to the <HI>Fear of God.</HI> Unto every <HI>Unconverted,</HI> and <HI>Unregenerate</HI> Soul, <HI>Thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God, and my Fear is not in thee, faith the Lord God of Hosts.</HI> This cannot be questioned.</P>
<P>Lastly. Sinners <HI>Incorrigible</HI> under <HI>Sufferings,</HI> proclaim themselves with∣out <HI>Fear</HI> that the <HI>Justice</HI> of God, may yet bring more <HI>heavy Sufferings</HI> upon them. They make a <HI>Fearless,</HI> Dar∣ring, Hardy Challenge to the <HI>Justice</HI> of God. God threatens them who are <HI>Incorrigible</HI> under their <HI>Sufferings,</HI> at that rate; Lev. XXVI. 23, 24. <HI>If ye will not be Reformed by these Things, then will I Punish you yet seven times more for your Sins.</HI> God will go on, <HI>Punishing</HI> the <HI>Incorrigible</HI> Sinner, and Multiplying His Plagues upon him, until he has destroy'd the Sin∣ner wonderfully. God will <HI>go on still</HI> in His Inflictions, if the Sinner will <HI>go on still</HI>
<PB N="65" REF="001764_0072_0FB7CCAD69B94E10"/>
in his <HI>Trespasses.</HI> Yea, 'Tis the tre∣mendous Commination of God; <HI>After thy Hardness and Impenitent Heart,</HI> O Incorrigible Sinner, thou shalt find thou hast been <HI>treasuring up Wrath against the Day of Wrath,</HI> and thy wo∣ful Portion will be in the <HI>Perdition of Ungodly Men.</HI> But, the <HI>Incorrigible</HI> are not afraid of what a just God will do unto them. No, you Wretches, whose Heart-strings are Sinews of Iron, you <HI>Fear</HI> it not! This fully proves the <HI>Indictment,</HI> That the <HI>Male∣factors have not the Fear of God before their Eyes.</HI></P>
<P>These Things cannot well go off, without this Direction unto us. My Brethren, Give this Demonstration; that you have the <HI>Fear of God;</HI> Hav∣ing <HI>suffered Evil Things,</HI> do not per∣sist, Oh! no longer persist, in <HI>Doing</HI> any <HI>Evil Things.</HI> Be prevailed withal, to make this Use of all your <HI>Suffer∣ings.</HI> Consider, <HI>What is the Errand which the Affliction I now suffer is come upon?</HI> Make that Request unto God; Job X. 2. <HI>Shew me wherefore thou con∣tendest
<PB N="66" REF="001764_0073_0FB7CCAEF0547B78"/>
with me.</HI> But then, <HI>Repent,</HI> Oh! <HI>Repent</HI> of the <HI>Miscarriages,</HI> which have procured such a <HI>Suffering</HI> for you. It is a memorable Word; Rev. III. 19. <HI>As many as I Love, I Rebuke and Cha∣sten; be Zealous therefore, and Repent.</HI> Christians, If you grow more <HI>Zealous of all good Works,</HI> and <HI>Repent</HI> of all your <HI>Evil Works,</HI> there has been the marvellous <HI>Love</HI> of God, in <HI>Rebuking</HI> and <HI>Chastening</HI> of you. Conform to the <HI>Will,</HI> Comply with the <HI>Call,</HI> of Him, who sends all your Sufferings, as His <HI>Messengers,</HI> upon you. Be Sol∣licitous for nothing so much as this; <HI>Oh! that my Sufferings may not be lost upon me!</HI> This will Demonstrate, That you <HI>Fear God.</HI> And, O Lord, <HI>How great is thy Goodness, which thou hast laid up for them, who so do Fear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>!</HI></P>
<P>III. The Third <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Thing, in which the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Trumpet is to wax yet Louder and Louder unto us, is this: 'Tis a <HI>Dreadful Thing</HI> for any one to <HI>Dye without the Fear of God.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="001764_0074_0FB7CCB05615F9F8"/>
Why was the Convert so much in Earnest, that his poor Friend might have in him the <HI>Fear of God?</HI> Why, He was just a <HI>Dying.</HI> He was to <HI>Dye</HI> that Afternoon. If he <HI>Dy'd</HI> before he had the <HI>Fear of God</HI> wrought in him, he must pass into a very Bad Condition <HI>after Death.</HI> Had it not been so, to what purpose had it been so earnestly to inculcate the <HI>Fear of God</HI> upon him! Truly, If any Man <HI>Dye,</HI> before he have a Soul Impreg∣nated, Rectified, Purified, by the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> the least that can be said, is; <HI>It had been good for that Man, that he had never been Born.</HI> If the Life of Man come to an end, before the <HI>Fear of God</HI> has begun to Regulate his Life, his <HI>Death</HI> will bring a dread∣ful Change upon him. 'Tis a fear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Thing for a Soul to go <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the World, not marked with the <HI>Fear of God</HI> for Blessedness in another <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Never, never was there heard a mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Astonishing Thunderclap, than that Word; Joh. VIII. 24. <HI>Ye shall Dye in your Sins.</HI> This, this will be the Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
<PB N="68" REF="001764_0075_0FB7CCB1CC289068"/>
of them, who <HI>Dye</HI> without the <HI>Fear of God.</HI> They <HI>Dye in their Sins,</HI> and their Death is a <HI>Trap-door,</HI> that lets them down into horrible Miseries.</P>
<P>The Pulpit must now become a <HI>Sinai.</HI> And since you are now to stand before a Flaming Mountain, Be <HI>afraid,</HI> O ye Sinners in our <HI>Zion;</HI> Let <HI>Fearfulness</HI> also <HI>Surprize </HI> you, O ye <HI>Hypocrites</HI> thereof. I am to tell you;</P>
<P>First. The <HI>Future State</HI> will be a <HI>Dismal State</HI> unto them, whose <HI>Death</HI> finds them in <HI>ill Terms with God.</HI> We have all possible Assurance, that <HI>after Death</HI> Men pass into a <HI>Future State. After Death a Judgment.</HI> A Redee∣mer, who by <HI>Rising from the Dead,</HI> asserted Himself to be the Eternal Son of God Incarnate, has assu∣red us of it. The <HI>Future State,</HI> as it will be Inconceivably <HI>Happy</HI> to some, so it will be Unutterably <HI>Dole∣ful</HI> to others. It will have such a Distribution as that; Matth. XXV. 46. <HI>The Wicked shall go away into ever∣lasting Punishment; but the Righteous
<PB N="69" REF="001764_0076_0FB7CCB9946FCFC0"/>
into Life Eternal.</HI> Particularly; There are some, who at their Death have their Spirits turned among <HI>Divels:</HI> One may almost say, turned into <HI>Divels.</HI> They are confined unto very uneasy Confusions: Rueful <HI>Chains of Darkness</HI> are laid upon them. They languish under the amazing Terror of a <HI>Wrath to come; a Fiery Indigna∣tion</HI> that shall one Day <HI>Devour</HI> them. He will one Day Raise them from the <HI>Dead:</HI> But it will be, that He may inflict a <HI>Second Death</HI> upon them; and a <HI>Death</HI> which will have in it, a <HI>Torture</HI> suitable to the Demerit of their <HI>Offences:</HI> A <HI>Torture</HI> whereto all the Racks and Fires here, are but <HI>Metaphors.</HI> A <HI>Guilty Conscience</HI> will remain in their <HI>Spirits,</HI> and the <HI>Wrath of God</HI> therewith forever Tor∣turing of them. Thus, even thus, the <HI>Enemies of God</HI> are to be dealt withal.</P>
<P>Secondly. The People whose <HI>Death</HI> finds them without the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> are such as <HI>Dye</HI> in <HI>ill Terms</HI> with God: And, Oh! What, what will the <HI>Fu∣ture State</HI> be unto them! We read;
<PB N="70" REF="001764_0077_0FB7CCC1C5612AB0"/>
Psal. XC. 11. <HI>Who knows the Power of thine Anger? Even according to thy Fear, so is thy Wrath.</HI> Men shall be treated by the <HI>Wrath of God,</HI> accor∣ding to the <HI>Fear of God</HI> which there has been in their Souls. By the <HI>fear of God</HI> Men get from under His <HI>Wrath.</HI> But if they are without the <HI>fear of God,</HI> they have His <HI>Wrath</HI> for∣ever abiding on them. For,</P>
<P>First. If People Dye without the <HI>fear of God,</HI> they <HI>Dye Unpardoned:</HI> And this Entails the formidable <HI>Wrath of God</HI> upon them. We read; Psal. CIII. 11, 12. <HI>Great is His Mercy to∣wards them that fear Him. He removes our Transgressions from us.</HI> But if Peo∣ple do not <HI>fear God,</HI> their Sins are lying on them, sticking to them; <HI>not one of a Thousand,</HI> alas, not one of their many Thousands, <HI>removed</HI> from them. The <HI>Wrath of God</HI> therefore falls upon the Man, who <HI>Dies</HI> with∣out the <HI>fear of God.</HI> He is not at <HI>Peace with God,</HI> and so he can't avoid the <HI>Wrath of God.</HI> But, Oh! How dread∣ful a Thing to fall under the <HI>Wrath</HI>
<PB N="71" REF="001764_0078_0FB7CCC30F6E0ED8"/>
of the LORD GOD ALMIGHTY! How <HI>fearful a Thing to fall into the Hands of the Living God!</HI> The <HI>Wrath of God</HI> sometimes lays People under incredible Torments in <HI>this World.</HI> But undoubtedly, the Tormenting Blows and Scalds, which the <HI>Wrath of God</HI> will give unto the <HI>Children of Wrath</HI> in the <HI>World to come,</HI> will ex∣ceed all that is ever seen in this World. Oh! Never yet were those unsearchable <HI>Treasures of Wrath</HI> so broken up, that any People alive upon Earth, have had a full Display thereof. But there is this <HI>Terror of the Lord</HI> added unto the <HI>dismal State</HI> of it Sinner lying under this <HI>Wrath;</HI> We <HI>know no Period of it!</HI> The Lamenta∣tions will not be, <HI>All our Days are passed away under thy Wrath.</HI> No, The Days will <HI>Never, Never, Never</HI> be <HI>All passed away.</HI> Nor will they be <HI>Days</HI> neither. They will be <HI>Nights</HI> rather than <HI>Days.</HI> 'Tis all <HI>utter Darkness.</HI> There will be <HI>Blackness of Darkness</HI> forever. O Dreadful! To be Exiled from GOD! And with an everlast∣ing
<PB N="72" REF="001764_0079_0FB7CCC4CAB77820"/>
Exile! To be made <HI>Vessels of Wrath,</HI> wherein the <HI>Wrath of God</HI> a∣gainst Sin, shall hang up <HI>Everlasting</HI> Monuments and Spectacles! This is the <HI>Portion</HI> of them who <HI>Dye</HI> with∣out the <HI>fear of God:</HI> This the <HI>Heritage</HI> of them who do not get into the <HI>Favour of God</HI> before they <HI>Dye.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. If People <HI>Dye</HI> without the <HI>fear of God,</HI> they <HI>Dye</HI> with a <HI>Vene∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ious Nature</HI> still unchanged; and so they carry an <HI>Eternal Fuel</HI> for the <HI>Wrath of God</HI> into Eternity with them. We read, Rom. VIII. 7. <HI>The Carnal Mind is Enmity against God.</HI> Until the <HI>fear of God</HI> come into the <HI>Mind,</HI> the Sinner has a <HI>Carnal Mind</HI> that re∣mains uncured in him. Now there is no prospect for the <HI>Cure</HI> of that <HI>Carnal Mind,</HI> when a Sinner is fallen under the Revenges of God, for his <HI>Enmity.</HI> No, He that is <HI>Unjust</HI> will still be <HI>Unjust;</HI> and he that is <HI>Filthy</HI> will be <HI>Filthy</HI> still. A perpetual <HI>En∣mity</HI> to God is then rivetted into the <HI>Mind</HI> of the Sinner; <HI>Never, never</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be gotten out. But what will be the
<PB N="73" REF="001764_0080_0FB7CCC66AF158E0"/>
<HI>Consequence</HI> of this <HI>Enmity?</HI> It must needs make the <HI>Future State</HI> a very <HI>Dismal</HI> one. A perpetual <HI>Enmity</HI> to God, must needs involve the sinful Wretch in a perpetual Wretched∣ness. No Comfortable <HI>Visions</HI> of God can be allow'd unto him, whom <HI>God counteth for His Enemy.</HI> Continual <HI>Re∣bukes</HI> from God, will be thundered upon him. Irregular <HI>Passions</HI> will keep his Enraged Soul in a perpetual Storm. His <HI>Desires</HI> will never be gra∣tified, but be always creating of <HI>Troubles</HI> unto him. He will <HI>Hate</HI> God, and God will <HI>Vex</HI> him; and the Vengeance of Heaven will be per∣petually Triumphing over him. This 'tis to <HI>Dye</HI> without the <HI>Fear of God:</HI> This must they look for, who <HI>Dye without Wisdom.</HI></P>
<P>And now, Oh! the Importunity, the Fervency, the Energy, which the EXHORTATION should be urged withal!</P>
<P>See to it, <HI>O all ye People, every one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f you,</HI> See to it, That you <HI>Dye</HI> not
<PB N="74" REF="001764_0081_0FB7CCD050137698"/>
without the <HI>fear of God,</HI> and, <HI>Alienated from the Life of God.</HI></P>
<P>My Hearers, We are every one of us all, under a <HI>Condemnation of Death.</HI> Know you not? Alas, you are obliged every Day to see the Execu∣tion of it; <HI>It is appointed unto Men once to Dye.</HI> The irreversible Sentence is gone out from the Mouth of God; <HI>So Death has passed upon all Men, for that all have Sinned.</HI></P>
<P>What? My Friend, Under this <HI>Condemnation,</HI> and not <HI>Fear God!</HI> O our <HI>Dying</HI> People,—And I Address every one of you all, under that Ap∣pellation; O our <HI>Dying</HI> People, <HI>Why will you Dye,</HI> and not get the <HI>Fear of God</HI> into your Souls before you <HI>Dye?</HI></P>
<P>First. There are <HI>None</HI> of you, but for ought you know, may <HI>Dye</HI> very <HI>Speedily,</HI> yea, may <HI>Dye</HI> very <HI>Suddenly.</HI> Unto the <HI>Youngest</HI> and unto the <HI>Strongest</HI> of you all, and unto them that are most ready to <HI>put far away the Evil Day,</HI> it may be said, as in Prov. XXVII. 1. <HI>Boast not of To- Morrow, for thou knowest not what a
<PB N="75" REF="001764_0082_0FB7CCD2165B2CD0"/>
Day may bring forth.</HI> Children, It highly Concerns every one of you, to Retire this very Evening, and <HI>Commune with your own Hearts;</HI> and ask, <HI>Have I yet attained unto the fear of God?</HI>—Ask, <HI>Is my Soul yet Renew∣ed with the fear of God?</HI> And send up your Cries from the Dust unto the Lord; Even those Cries; Psal. LXXXVI. 11. <HI>Lord, engage my Heart to fear thy Name.</HI> You are not sure that you have one Week more to <HI>Live.</HI> 'Tis <HI>Time</HI> to lay hold on a Mercy, for the ensuring whereof you are not sure of having any more <HI>Time</HI> allow'd unto you.</P>
<P>Secondly. There are <HI>Some</HI> of you, who know, that you are just going to <HI>Dye.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aged People</HI> surely cannot but know this. I am therefore to say unto you; An <HI>Aged Person without the fear of God,</HI> Oh! 'Tis one of the most Melan∣choly Sights that can be look'd up∣on. What? <HI>Past Fifty,</HI> and come to the Use of Glasses, and flying down to the Grave, with the <HI>Haste of an
<PB N="76" REF="001764_0083_0FB7CCD3966D0338"/>
Eagle to the Prey;</HI> and still without the <HI>fear of God!</HI> Oh! Lamentable! I entreat you, I entreat you, Syrs, to <HI>make Haste</HI> in lifting up your Cries unto God. <HI>Oh! God of all Grace, Im∣plant thy Fear in my Soul before I die! Oh! Let not my Death surprize me, be∣fore the Grace of thy Fear has Enlighten∣ed me!</HI> And Oh! be at no Quiet, until you feel the Working of it. Your <HI>Epitaph</HI> will else quickly be that; Eccl. IX. 3. <HI>Madness is in their Heart while they Live, and after that they go to the Dead.</HI></P>
<P>But of those who are sure of hav∣ing the <HI>Arrest of Death</HI> presently served upon them, there is none that has a more affecting Assurance of it, than a poor <HI>Daughter of Death,</HI> who is this Afternoon to have her <HI>Soul Required</HI> of her. Ah! poor Crea∣ture! <HI>Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art under a Condemnation,</HI> to a Tragi∣cal Death which is to be this After∣noon executed on thee; and within three or four Hours, <HI>thy Soul will be Required of thee;</HI> within three or four
<PB N="77" REF="001764_0084_0FB7CCD51AC8A4C8"/>
Hours thy Soul must make its Ap∣pearance before a Terrible GOD! Oh! What, what will be the Con∣dition of that Perishing Soul, if no <HI>Fear of God</HI> be found in it, when it Appears before Him?—</P>
<P>There is indeed a vast Abundance even to a Profusion, of <HI>Instructions,</HI> bestow'd more <HI>Privately</HI> on such <HI>Male∣factors</HI> as <HI>Dye</HI> among us: No Place upon Earth does equal this Place for that Exercise of <HI>Charity.</HI> And this poor Creature has had a very parti∣cular Share thereof: Not only have the <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Gospel done their Part, in Visiting of her, but also many Private Christians have done theirs, in a most Exemplary man∣ner. As of old in <HI>Jerusalem</HI> it was the Usage of the Ladies, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for the Dying <HI>Malefactors,</HI> that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which was called, <HI>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Condemned,</HI> so the Young Gentle∣women here in their Turns, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Charitably gone to the Prison <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Day for diverse Weeks together, and because of her not being able to Read,

have spent the Afternoons in Read∣ing Portions of the Scriptures, and other Books of Piety, to this <HI>Con∣demned Woman,</HI> and giving their Ex∣cellent Counsils unto her. Never∣theless, we chuse in a more <HI>Publick</HI> way also to direct a few Words of our Sermons, unto such Persons; when we have them among our Hearers; Because, the <HI>Preaching of the Gospel,</HI> is the Grand Ordinance of our Saviour, for the <HI>Conversion of a Sinner from the Error of his way;</HI> and we would wait upon our Glorious LORD, in that way which he has Ordained, hoping, still hoping, to see a <HI>Soul saved from Death!</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore once more, <HI>O misera∣ble Woman,</HI> entring into an Eternity to be trembled at; Once more, thou shalt hear the <HI>Joyful Sound</HI> of the Gospel, inviting thee to the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> and the <HI>Faith</HI> of thy only Savi∣our. And if there be not in this Last Essay, a more saving Impression from the <HI>Glorious Gospel of the Blessed God</HI> made upon thee, than thou hast yet
<PB N="79" REF="001764_0086_0FB7CCDE2D8FE508"/>
felt from any former ones,—Oh! the dreadful, dreadful Consequences! What will become of thee!—<HI>Can thy Hands be Strong, or can thy Heart endure,</HI> in the View of what a Terri∣ble GOD will order for thee?—Be∣hold, Ah! poor <HI>Margaret,</HI> Behold a mighty Congregation of People, with Hearts Bleeding for thee, and Wishing and Praying and Longing to see the <HI>fear of God</HI> making some Discoveries in thee. And shall thy Heart still remain unaffected with thy own Condition; discovering still a total Estrangement from the <HI>fear of God!</HI> No Tears are enough, Tears of Blood were not enough, to be em∣ploy'd on so prodigious a Spectacle!</P>
<P>I am sorry, I am sorry, that I find myself obliged so much to speak it. Even since thou hast been <HI>under Con∣demnation,</HI> thou hast not <HI>feared God.</HI> Not many Hours are passed, since I saw in thee, so much Rage, and so; <HI>Unrighteously</HI> harboured, and so <HI>Inde∣cently</HI> Vomited, against some Ver∣tuous Children of God, that it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="80" REF="001764_0087_0FB7CCE3557220A8"/>
too Evident, this <HI>fear of God</HI> had not yet begun to soften thee.</P>
<P>But if the <HI>fear of God</HI> enter not in∣to thy Soul, before thy Soul be dri∣ven out o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thy Body, which will be now,—alas, before many Minutes more be expired, thy Desolate, For∣saken, Miserable Soul, can have no part in the <HI>Kingdom of God.</HI> My Soul cannot be safe, if I forbear to tell thee so!</P>
<P>Ah, poor Creature, Art thou wil∣ing to <HI>Dye</HI> unreconciled unto the God, whom thou hast Affronted with infinite Provocations? To <HI>Dye,</HI> and fall into the Mouths of <HI>Dragons,</HI> who have so long poisoned thee, and en∣slaved thee? To <HI>Dye</HI> and be cast into the Eternal Burnings, from whence the Smoak of the Torment will ascend forever and ever? What? Shall all the Means of Good, which in a Religious Place have, been used for thee, with hopes that they might find out one of the <HI>Elect of God,</HI> serve only to aggravate thy Eternal Con∣demnation
<PB N="81" REF="001764_0088_0FB7CCE6944506A0"/>
at the last? Oh! Dread∣ful Consideration!</P>
<P>But, Oh! Be Astonished at it! There is yet a <HI>Door of Hope</HI> set open for thee; It will <HI>for one Hour</HI> it may be, stand open yet! Oh! Be full of Astonishments at such an Heart-melt∣ing Declaration, as is now to be made unto thee. A Compassionate SAVIOUR, is yet willing, to <HI>Cleanse by Soul</HI> with His Blood, from the Sins, which by casting off the <HI>fear of God</HI> thou hast fallen into; yet wil∣ing to <HI>create</HI> in thee a <HI>Clean Heart,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at shall be filled with the <HI>fear of God,</HI> if he be sought unto; yet call∣ing to thee, <HI>O look unto me and be Sa∣ved!</HI> And yet affording unto thee that Encouragement, in Joh. VI. 27. <HI>He that cometh unto me, I will in no wise cast out.</HI></P>
<P>And, Oh! What wilt thou now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o under these Astonishing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>?

Prodigy!</HI> Fall down before thy SA∣VIOUR, and cry out; <HI>O my Savi∣our; Take pitty on my Soul, and now at the Last, let Sovereign Grace break forth, with a good Work of thy fear in my Soul!</HI> Cry out, <HI>O my Saviour, Let my Sin be all pardoned, and let all Sin be as Abominable unto me, as it is unto all that fear thy Name!</HI> Let thy Outcries pierce the very Heavens.</P>
<P>But, be it known unto thee, If the <HI>fear of God</HI> be in thee, it will be a thing <HI>more Bitter than Death</HI> unto thee, that thou hast Sinned against His Glorious Majesty; Thy <HI>Malice</HI> a∣gainst every Neighbour will be ex∣tinguished; Thou wilt submit with Patience, to the <HI>Punishment</HI> of thy Iniquity; And thou wilt be an Ho∣ly, Humble, Thankful Soul, and quite <HI>another Creature!</HI>—God of His Infinite Mercy make thee so!</P>
<P>Tho' I have now no more to say unto this poor Creature; yet I have something to say unto <HI>all</HI> this Con∣gregation of God; and her Circum∣stances <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urnish me with an Awful Occasion for it.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="001764_0090_0FB7CCEA102FF778"/>
I wish, Oh! I wish, the Testimo∣nies of a thorough <HI>Repentance</HI> in her, were more Conspicuous. But I would make the best Use I can, of what <HI>Little</HI> has been obtained.</P>
<P>This Woman in her better Frames, has very Voluntarily over and over again, testified her Desire, to do what <HI>Good</HI> may be done, by an <HI>Instrument,</HI> that she has put into my Hands; Signed with her own, before several <HI>Witnesses,</HI> after every Clause thereof had been distinctly Considered with her. An Instrument which▪ I shall now Read unto you.—</P>
<Q><P>A Miserable Death is hastened upon me, for my Sins against the Almighty God. I own the Ju∣stice of the Almighty in what is come upon me; and I own also the Justice of the Government <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Executing the Sentence of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which cuts me off.

<PB N="84" REF="001764_0091_0FB7CCF26CA0AEC0"/>
Lord, in providing a Saviour for so great and vile a Sinner. I fly to Him, that my Sins may be all par∣doned for the sake of His Blood, and that I may be delivered parti∣cularly from the Bloodguiltiness wherewith I am justly Chargeable; and also that He would give me a New Heart, and make all my Sins Bitter and Loathsome to me.</P>
<P>I am sensible, That without a true Repentance, I must Perish un∣der the dreadful Wrath of God: And wo to me, if I Dye in my Sins. But I am informed, That in Repenting of my Sins, I shall do well to warn other Sinners against such things as have been the undo∣ing of my Soul.</P>
<P>I do therefore declare, That I believe God has been greatly Of∣fended at me, for the Sins of an Unbridled Tongue; whereof <HI>Swear∣ing</HI> and <HI>Cursing</HI> is to be particular∣ly reckoned; and for my Profana∣tions of His Holy Sabbaths. But the Sin which above many lies
<PB N="85" REF="001764_0092_0FB7CCF3D6343058"/>
heavy on my Mind, is my Diso∣bedience and Rebellion against my Parents; A Sin against which I would have all to be warned, that would not come to an untimely End.</P>
<P>I also Bewail before the Lord, and His People, the Sins of <HI>Uncha∣stity,</HI> which have led me on to the Ruine that is now come upon me. Little do poor Creatures consider, when they are once got into the Unclean ways of Unchastity, what they shall come to.</P>
<P>Being forsaken of God, I attemp∣ted in Murderous Ways, to Destroy my Unborn Infant.

<P>God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Merciful to me a Sinner: and make my Warnings Profitable to other Sinners.</P></Q>

The <HI>Violent Passions</HI> whereinto this Woman has been Transported since her calm and free Exhibition of this Instrument, leave us at a perfect Loss what to make of her. We can do no more, but leave her to the <HI>unknown Mercy</HI> of God.</P>
<P>But my Hearers, You can your∣selves now generally make agreeable <HI>Remarks,</HI> on this <HI>Instrument;</HI> And you will not let such an <HI>uncommon Engine of Piety</HI> be lost among you.</P>
<P>But, I hope, <HI>Undutiful Children</HI> es∣pecially will tremble at the Spectacle which God this Day hangs up for them all with a Trembling Soul to look upon. <HI>Undutiful Children,</HI> How often, how often have you now heard from the Gallows, those dole∣ful Eiulations, <HI>Disobedience to Parents is what brings to this!</HI> Yea, 'tis a won∣derful Thing I am now to tell you. This poor Creature here, cannot now forget it. In a mad Rage once, [Horrible to be spoken!] she <HI>Cursed her own Mother.</HI> And her enraged Mother then uttered that Impreca∣tion
<PB N="87" REF="001764_0094_0FB7CCF79FCCAFA0"/>
upon her, <HI>I wish thou mayest Dye upon the Gallows!</HI> And now, see what it is come to! Oh! do not you go on in your <HI>Disobedience.</HI> If you have given your <HI>Parents</HI> cause to Com∣plain, that you have made <HI>Heavy Hearts</HI> for them, <HI>Repent</HI> of what you have done; and Obey them, Oblige them, Comfort them. What will the Holy GOD else leave you to? Child, <HI>If thou wilt not hearken to my Counsil, I know that God has determined, He will destroy thee!</HI></P>
<P>And, Oh! that all Profane <HI>Delays of Repentance,</HI> might after this appear more Frightful, from a fresh and a black and a stupendous <HI>Experiment,</HI> that has been made of the Danger in them. This poor Creature, upon her very first Imprisonment, had the best Advice that could be given un∣to her, to <HI>spend her Time unto the best Advantage.</HI> But a vile Person in the Prison perswaded her, that he should make his Escape, and would carry her off; and all should be well.

<HI>Hardness of Heart,</HI> which this Foolish Perswasion betray'd her to. But I cannot perceive any of all her <HI>Follies,</HI> to be now more Cruciating to her, than what were the Fruit of this Perswasion. Particularly, That now she minded nothing of <HI>Repentance,</HI> until her <HI>Condemnation;</HI> And God knows, what poor Work she has made of it since, tho' the Honour∣able Judges have Mercifully allow'd so much Time unto her.—O Pro∣crastinating Sinners, If by secure <HI>Delays of Repentance,</HI> you so <HI>Vex</HI> the Holy Spirit of God, as to procure His Departure from you, what <HI>Hard∣ness of Heart</HI> may you be given up unto! <HI>Wo to them, when I depart from them, saith the Lord.</HI></P>

<P>Abominable Sins! The Sins where of our Holy JESUS, hath from Hea∣ven sent this Notice to us, <HI>I hate there!</HI> The <HI>Sins,</HI> which the Holy Scripture

<P>I cannot but think, That there is a <HI>Voice of God</HI> unto the Country in this Thing; That there should be so many Instances of Women Exe∣cuted for the Murder of their <HI>Bastard-Children.</HI> There are now Six or Se∣ven such unhappy Instances, that are upon Record, and made <HI>Pillars of Salt</HI> in Printed Memorials. <HI>Lo, God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nds out. His Voice, and that a mighty Voice,</HI> in these Things. <HI>Lord, Help us to understand thy Meaning in them.</HI></P>
<P>Certainly, There is a Loud Voice and Call from God unto Good Men, to consider more than ever; <HI>What Sacred Exorcisms are to be used, that
<PB N="91" REF="001764_0098_0FB7CD0510A90B90"/>
the Unclean Spirit may be suppressed in the Land.</HI></P>
<P>Most certainly, There is this <HI>Voice</HI> of GOD: Let all People beware how they give way to lesser Begin∣nings in the <HI>Sins of Unchastity.</HI> Oh! People can't see, where they shall <HI>stop,</HI> if once they give the Reins to Impetuous <HI>Impurities.</HI></P>
<P>Most certainly, All of us that may upon Reflection find any Stumbles into the <HI>Sins of Unchastity,</HI> may now hear this <HI>Voice</HI> of GOD unto us; <HI>O Bewail your Impurities; and Abhor yourselves before an Holy GOD; and get the Cleansing Blood of your Saviour sprinkled on your Souls.</HI> And may we not apprehend one thing more! Several <HI>Bastard-Children</HI> have been <HI>Murdered</HI> in this Place; But there has not unto this Day been any Detection of the <HI>Murderers.</HI> There is this Day a <HI>Voice</HI> of GOD, and lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, it is a <HI>mighty Voice,</HI> unto th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Bloo∣dy Creatures; <HI>Oh!

<P>I have done. I have these Faith∣ful Warnings in the Hands of GOD, for Him to make them Efficacious. <HI>O Glorious LORD, Give thou, for Thou alone canst <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an Efficacy to them!</HI></P>

<Q><HI>Have I any Pleasure at all that the Wicked should die? saith the LORD GOD: and not that he should return and live?</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE <HI>Words</HI> are among the many <HI>Endearing Argu∣ments</HI> and <HI>Addresses,</HI> where∣with the Great GOD persues wilful and obstinate Sinners; if it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight be possible at last to softe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 'em unto Repentance.</P>
<P>THE Wicked <HI>Jews</HI> had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a <HI>strange Opinion</HI> of the Blessed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="4" REF="001764_0102_0FB7CB0DA8E9A5E8"/>
as if he took all Advantages against 'em, to Punish 'em; and particularly <HI>that they suffered for their Fathers Sins</HI> It was become a kind of <HI>Proverb</HI> a∣mong 'em, tho' it carry'd a plain <HI>Reproach</HI> and <HI>Impeachment</HI> of the Di∣vine Judgments; that <HI>the Fathers had eaten four Grapes, and the Children<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Teeth were set on Edge.</HI> The <HI>Objection</HI> was Foolish as well as Profane; for it is no ways Unjust in GOD to inflict <HI>Temporal Evils</HI> upon the Chil∣dren for their Parents Sins: For a great many present Punishments of the Sins of Parents, do by a natural and unavoidable Tendency involve their Posterity in Calamities and Miseries.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>Chapter</HI> GOD asserts in Ge∣neral His own <HI>Soveraignty</HI> and <HI>Justice</HI> that <HI>all Souls are His,</HI> and that <HI>the Soul that Sins shall die.</HI> But more especially there are <HI>four things</HI> pretty much insisted on; as Mr. <HI>Henry</HI> di∣vides the <HI>Chapter:</HI> That it shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>ill with the wicked Man,</HI> tho' he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a good Father; that it shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <HI>we

with the good Man,</HI> tho' he had a wicked Father; that it shall be <HI>well with Penitents,</HI> tho' they began ne∣ver so ill; and that it shall be <HI>ill with Apostates,</HI> tho' they began never so well.</P>
<P>UNDER the <HI>Third</HI> of these Heads our <HI>Text</HI> falls; <HI>Have I any Pleasure at all that the Wicked should die? saith the Lord GOD: and not that he should return from his ways and live?</HI></P>
<P>LET us attentively Consider, <HI>Who</HI> it is that speaks, and <HI>What</HI> is said. <HI>Saith the Lord GOD:</HI> He it is that speaketh <HI>from Heaven,</HI> and <HI>see that you refuse</HI> Him not. What Attention, Re∣verence, Fear and Faith do we owe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto <HI>His Words?</HI> whether of <HI>Grace</HI> or of His Anger and Wrath.</P>
<P>OBSERVE the <HI>Thing sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> and the <HI>Form</HI> wherein it is clothed. <HI>Have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Pleasure at all?</HI> No, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> not the least, that the <HI>Sinner <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>:</HI> But on the contrary, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in∣stantly, unspeakably Pleasing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Great and Holy GOD, that <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from his evil ways and live▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> He

desires, <HI>this</HI> wou'd delight Him; <HI>this</HI> He aims at, and endeavours in all His Addresses unto perishing Souls for their Salvation.</P>
<P>HE can Appeal to Sinners them∣selves and refer it to them to judge, <HI>Have I any pleasure at all that the Wicked should die?</HI> Besides the <HI>vehement Nega∣tion</HI> on God's part herein imply'd, it is as much supposed that <HI>the Sinner can't deny or oppose</HI> the Truth of what is here affirmed. So that the <HI>Doctrine</HI> before us is this:</P>
<Q>Doct. That the Lord our GOD has given us the utmost Assurances, that He has no pleasure at all in the Death of Sin∣ners, but on the contrary, that He earnestly desires their Repentance and Salvation.</Q>
<P>IN speaking to this <HI>Doctrine,</HI> I shall only 1. <HI>Premise a few Words for the stating and limiting</HI> the Truth as∣serted; and then 2. <HI>Exemplify, Illu∣strate and prove it by an Induction of undeniable Instances.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="001764_0105_0FB7CB1635F5FED0"/>
I. I would <HI>Premise</HI> a few Words for the <HI>Stating and Limiting</HI> the Truth before us: Which may serve as so many <HI>Negative Propositions,</HI> to tell us what is <HI>not meant</HI> to be affirmed. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IT is a most certain Truth, that GOD has Pleasure in hating Sin.</HI> He has the highest Complacency in His own Holiness, the Rectitude of His own Nature; and consequently in the Aversations of that Holy Nature: He is <HI>not a God that can have Pleasure in Wickedness, neither can Evil dwell with Him; He hateth all the workers of Iniquity.</HI> Psal. 5. 4. Even a sanctify'd Nature on Earth, so far as its mea∣sures of Sanctification are, doth more or less find great Pleasure in its Aversations to Sin. <HI>They that love the Lord hate Evil.</HI> There are all the Pleasures of Love to GOD in the hatred of Sin. All <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is not Grievous and Painful; all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Re∣gular and truly Natural, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and Pleasant: <HI>Pain</HI> proceeds only from the Irregularity of a thing, its being Wrong. The Blessedness and
<PB N="8" REF="001764_0106_0FB7CB17911C62E8"/>
Joy of GOD is in His own Holi∣ness. The hatred of Sin is therefore Essential to GOD and to His Bles∣sedness. So that tho' GOD has no Pleasure that the Wicked should die, yet has He Pleasure in <HI>hating</HI> the Wicked, as such, and their ways: <HI>The Wicked and him that loveth Violence His Soul hateth.</HI> Psal. 11. 5.</P>
<P N="2">2. MOREOVER, <HI>God has Pleasure in Glorifying His Justice in all the De∣mands of it against the Wicked.</HI> The Justice of GOD is an Attribute Es∣sential to Him. It necessarily follows upon the Rectitude and Holiness of His Nature, together with His Do∣minion and Government. If there be one most Holy Lord and Governour of the World, I'm sure that it is Essential to Him to Punish Sin at such Times, and in such Manner and Circumstances, as His Wisdom, Purity, the Order and Good of the World, and His own Honour and Glory do direct unto. So far God's Punishing Sin by a <HI>necessity of Nature</HI> is Intelligible, and Certain; and no
<PB N="9" REF="001764_0107_0FB7CB1B2182EB20"/>
farther can I apprehend it. GOD's Holiness, Honour &amp; Justice is dearer to Him than a thousand Worlds; <HI>Pereat Mundus sed fiat Justitia;</HI> let the World be Burnt up, but let Ju∣stice be Glorify'd. The <HI>Goodness</HI> and <HI>Mercy</HI> of GOD can have no Pleasure in any Display of itself, any further than is consistent with the Satisfa∣ction and Glory of <HI>Justice. They</HI> do not Lust against each other; oppose, repine at, or glory over one ano∣ther: No; they agree, unite, and are both Glorious in the Exaltation of either. <HI>Goodness</HI> in GOD is as much for the Preservation of the <HI>Rights of a Holy and Wife and Perfect Admini∣stration of Government,</HI> as strict Justice is; and Justice delights in the Exal∣tation of Mercy <HI>these preserv'd,</HI> as much as it does in the Inflictions of the Punishments which they call for. Hence GOD is <HI>just to forgive,</HI> as well as to punish. It is as Delight∣ful to GOD to glorify His Ju∣stice as His Mercy. The one is as dear to Him as the other. They ne∣ver
<PB N="10" REF="001764_0108_0FB7CB211EBB91A8"/>
<HI>Rival,</HI> but infinitely Delight in each other. St. <HI>James</HI> has a Passage that may be easily mis-understood: Jam. 2. 13. <HI>Mercy rejoiceth against Judgment.</HI> If you should understand this of <HI>Mercy in GOD,</HI> it could be only spoken <HI>Popularly;</HI> as among Men Mercy shown to the Evil that deserve it not, seems to get the <HI>Victo∣ry and Ascendant.</HI> But indeed the <HI>Apo∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e</HI> there speaks of <HI>Mercy in Man,</HI> when <HI>that</HI> is in its Display and Ex∣altation, triumphing over the Wick∣edness and Enmity and Injuries of others; <HI>it gives a Person Comfort and Rejoicing in his prospect of the Judg∣ment of God: For he shall have Judg∣ment without Mercy, that sheweth not Mercy; and Mercy rejoiceth against Judgment.</HI> So that it is not spoken of the Mercy of GOD rejoicing against His Judgment; but of the <HI>Grace of Mercifulness in the Saint,</HI> enabling him to rejoice against the threatning and Condemnation of the Law.</P>
<P>TO return from this <HI>Digression.</HI> Tho' GOD has no Pleasure that
<PB N="11" REF="001764_0109_0FB7CB2445FFEB50"/>
the Wicked should die, yet has He Pleasure in Glorifying His Justice in all the Demands of it upon the Wicked: That is infinitely Pleasant to Him.</P>
<P N="3">3. LET it be also further observed, as another great <HI>Maxim of Truth;</HI> That GOD <HI>has ineffable Pleasure in fulfilling and performing His Word.</HI> Whe∣ther it be the <HI>Promises</HI> or the <HI>Threat∣nings</HI> thereof; the Words of <HI>Grace</HI> or those of <HI>Terror.</HI> They are both the unchangeable Truths of GOD, and according to His most Blessed and Perfect Nature; and the Plea∣sure of GOD is equal in the fulfil∣ment of either. <HI>As for GOD His Work is Perfect; He is a GOD of Truth and without Iniquity, Just and Right is He.</HI> He has not more Pleasure in holding the <HI>Universe</HI> in its Order, than He has in fulfilling of His <HI>Words;</HI> the Word which threatens the Wicked with Death. Yea the Heavens and the Earth <HI>shall pass away, sooner than one Jot or Tittle</HI> of God's revealed written Truth. More settled is <HI>this</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="001764_0110_0FB7CB2E2E021F38"/>
than the Ordinances of Heaven, and the Beauty and Glory of the Uni∣verse more depends on <HI>this</HI> than on their Order and Motion. Hence 'tis that He will <HI>Laugh at the Calamity of the Wicked, and Mock when their Fear cometh.</HI> Prov. 1. 25. There can be no room for <HI>Pity</HI> when Holiness Justice and Truth stand forth and demand Execution. GOD is Plenteous and Abundant in <HI>Truth</HI> as well as Mercy and Goodness. <HI>Just and True are His Ways, true and right His Judgments,</HI> and therefore He necessarily takes Pleasure in <HI>them. The strength of Israel cannot lye nor repent, for He is not a Man that He should repent.</HI> Psal. 89. 34. <HI>Neither will I alter the thing that is gone out of my Mouth.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. AND lastly. We must also lay down this for an undoubted Truth, That <HI>the Sufferings of the damned can∣not give God Perturbation or Disrest.</HI> Tho' GOD has no Pleasure that the Wicked should die, yet if they die in their Sins it gives Him no <HI>Inquietude,</HI> Uneasiness or Disturbance. He is
<PB N="13" REF="001764_0111_0FB7CB2FA0C17F80"/>
<HI>Over all blessed for ever.</HI> GOD lives in a full Complacency and in ever∣lasting Rest. Uninterrupted, and ne∣ver to be diminished is His Satisfa∣ction in Himself: With Him is the Fountain of Light, and there can be no Darkness at all near Him.</P>
<P><HI>GOD is liable to no Passion, or disorder of Affection.</HI> Heaven is the <HI>Temperate Region.</HI> Humane Passions have their <HI>Transports</HI> and their <HI>Pain;</HI> and to ac∣comodate Himself to us and affect us God speaks of Himself <HI>after the man∣ner of Men;</HI> but let us beware of thinking GOD <HI>altogether such as our∣selves.</HI> What is <HI>imperfect</HI> in us, we must <HI>infinitely remove</HI> from GOD, when we conceive and speak of Him. We may as well make to our∣selves a <HI>Graven Image of Humane Form</HI> and call it <HI>GOD,</HI> because that GOD has spoken of Himself as having an <HI>Eye</HI> to see, an <HI>Ear</HI> to hear, a <HI>Mouth</HI> to speak, and a <HI>Hand</HI> to strike; as con∣ceive of GOD after the <HI>Imperfection of our own Souls</HI> in the workings of their <HI>Affections.</HI> The <HI>first</HI> would be on∣ly
<PB N="14" REF="001764_0112_0FB7CB3168CE3678"/>
to make a <HI>Dead Lifeless</HI> Image of GOD; the <HI>last</HI> to <HI>impute</HI> Evil and <HI>Moral Disorders</HI> to Him.</P>
<P>IF <HI>we</HI> Punish from <HI>Anger</HI> it roils us: if <HI>Pity</HI> remain it grieves us. If <HI>Joy</HI> seizes us, and <HI>Love</HI> work strongly in us, they overcome us almost: But much more if <HI>Wrath and Hatred</HI> move us, we suffer most ourselves in the Punishments we lay on others. But it is not so with God: Tho' we read of His Wrath, yet must we not <Q>suppose or imagine <HI>any Painful Im∣pression on the Divine Mind.</HI> He nei∣ther feels the Miseries He pities; nor is vext at the Sins which He detests.</Q> The Divine Mind is ever Serene, Calm and <HI>Impassible;</HI> and <Q>we must abstract all that in our Conceptions of Him,</Q> which spring out of the Imperfection either of <HI>Nature</HI> or <HI>Happiness.</HI></P>
<P>SO far I have labour'd to State and Limit the <HI>Truth</HI> before us; to clear and deliver it from those <HI>Ca∣vils</HI> and <HI>Objections</HI> that may rise against it in our Minds. Tho' GOD
<PB N="15" REF="001764_0113_0FB7CB34D0BFCBC8"/>
has no Pleasure that the Wicked should die, yet it is infinitely Plea∣surable to Him to hate Sin, to glo∣rify His Justice, and to perform His Truth and Threatnings against Sin; and the <HI>Miseries</HI> of them that perish are no grief or <HI>offence of Heart</HI> unto Him.</P>
<P>II. I now pass unto the <HI>Second Thing</HI> propounded, which is; <HI>To illu∣strate, prove, and exemplify the Doctrine by an Induction of diverse Instances:</HI> all which shall confirm and shew that GOD has given us abundant Assu∣rances that He has no Pleasure in the Death of Sinners, but in their Re∣pentance.</P>
<P N="1">1. AND as it is fit, I will begin, <HI>first</HI> with the <HI>positive Affirmation hereof in the Word of GOD.</HI> And this is in∣stead of a thousand other Proofs, if GOD had said it: <HI>His Truth endureth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ro out all Generations.</HI> Yea the GOD of Truth has passed it into an <HI>Oath,</HI> which is the <HI>highest Confirmation and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n End of all Strife</HI> or Dispute; It shows the <HI>Immutability</HI> of His <HI>Counsel,</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="001764_0114_0FB7CB3C95D3BCF0"/>
wherein it is impossible for GOD to change; and so is a Ground for the strongest Confidence, and Consola∣tion to them that <HI>fly for Refuge</HI> from Guilt and the Avenger of Blood to lay hold on the <HI>hope</HI> of Forgivness and Life Eternal. Now this <HI>Oath</HI> we have in <HI>Form</HI> and express Terms: Ezek. 33. 11. <HI>Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the Death of the Wicked, but that the Wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways, for why will ye dye, O House of Israel?</HI> How solemn is this Assurance given to Sinners? and what could GOD do more to assure them? Is it not a wonderful <HI>Condescention</HI> in the Great GOD to superadd His Oath unto His Word? to <HI>swear</HI> to what He had once said, that so His Word might make the deeper Im∣pression on us? whereas any <HI>one Word</HI> of GOD, the <HI>Eternal Truth</HI> is instead of ten thousand Oaths. Therefore He swears by Himself, there being <HI>no Greater to swear by: As I live, saith the
<PB N="17" REF="001764_0115_0FB7CB4100CF1F70"/>
Lord, I have no</HI> &amp;c. GOD is Sincere <Q>and Faithful in all that He says; He deals plainly with us and speaks what He intends:</Q> His Words are the true Image and Declaration of His Mind. And He has told us of Himself, that He <HI>would have all Men to be saved.</HI> 1 Tim. 2. 4. that He is <HI>not willing that any should Perish, but that all should come to Repentance.</HI> 2 Pet. 3. 9.</P>
<P>NOW shall we believe GOD, or shall we make Him a Liar? shall we scruple and doubt after His positive Word is passed? No; <HI>let GOD be true;</HI> let His Word be magnified, in GOD let us praise His Word! that Word by which the World stands! until the time come when the Angel lifts up his Hand to Heaven hereafter and swears by him that liveth for ever and ever, that time shall be no mercy and then by the same word shall all things be dissolved.</P>
<P N="2">2. GOD has given assurance to Sinners that He hath no pleasure in their Death, <HI>in the Revelation which
<PB N="18" REF="001764_0116_0FB7CB42B74B9FD8"/>
He has given us of His own merciful Nature.</HI> When He descended to Pro∣claim His Name to <HI>Moses,</HI> in how many <HI>Attributes of Grace</HI> was it, as the Saviour of Sinners and ready and abundant to Pardon? <HI>The Lord Gra∣cious and Merciful, Long-suffering and abundant in Goodness; keeping Mercy for thousands</HI> &amp;c. How many Words are here heap'd up to show how much the glory, nature and will of GOD is in the Salvation of Sinners, their Repentance and Pardon? Mercy, Grace, Patience, Goodness, Faith∣fulness all glorified in forgiving Ini∣quity, Transgression and Sin. And to Magnify this the more to Sinners for their Comfort and to draw forth their confidence therein, and ado∣rations thereof, we read that He is <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in Mercy,</HI> and <HI>plenteous</HI> in Mercy; of the <HI>greatness</HI> of His Mercies, and the <HI>multitude</HI> of His Mercies; His <HI>manifold</HI> Mercies and His <HI>tender</HI> Mer∣cy; and all imploy'd for the help and relief of perishing Sinners. P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al. 51. 1. <HI>According to the multitude of thy tender Mercies, blot out my Transgressions.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="19" REF="001764_0117_0FB7CB43DB8230C8"/>
3. <HI>THE Relation wherein GOD stands to His Creatures,</HI> may afford Assu∣rance unto <HI>Sinners</HI> that He has no pleasure in their Death, save only as the Honour, Holiness and Justice of His Government do necessitate it.</P>
<P>WE are all the <HI>Work of His Hands: One GOD created us.</HI> Now GOD has implanted in <HI>us,</HI> a natural and ne∣cessary, but most free chosen and delightful Regard to <HI>our own;</HI> whe∣ther our own, <HI>Works,</HI> or our <HI>Off∣spring.</HI> We desire to see those that come of us Happy; in all their Afflictions we deeply share and are afflicted; it is very painful to us to see them suffer; On the other hand, How does it please us to see them Happy? what Content have we in their doing and faring well? how do we Rejoice in their Prosperity? And has not GOD a higher and superior Regard, think we, to all His Works?</P>
<P>DO we not esteem it a proper suitable and wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Inclination in Us? most Beneficial and most Just? Cer∣tainly
<PB N="20" REF="001764_0118_0FB7CB454BBE31F0"/>
it is. But far more Necessary is the <HI>High Creator,</HI> the Father and Preserver of all things! If His tender Mercies were not over all His Works, what would become of them?</P>
<P>WHAT wise Man has pleasure in the Destruction of his own Work? when he has done it with any De∣gree of Art, bro't it to some great Perfection, and to an equal Useful∣ness and Service? Does he not che∣rish it and tender it? And are not the Glorious and perfect Works of GOD dearer to Him, and more pre∣cious in His Sight?</P>
<P>TRUE, To His <HI>own</HI> Honour and Glory, the Ends of His Holiness Wisdom and Justice, and the common Good of all His Creation, it is meet &amp; good that a <HI>Million</HI> of Creatures be thrown away in a day into an Eter∣nal Perdition: for what are <HI>these</HI> un∣to the Honour and <HI>Government</HI> of GOD? and to His Glory from Infi∣nite Millions of Holy and better Creatures, and their joynt-happiness? 'Tis but as an <HI>Achan</HI> sacrificed out of
<PB N="21" REF="001764_0119_0FB7CB4D0CC370D8"/>
the Congregation to the Justice of Heaven, and for the Preservation of the Whole! But otherwise, the GOD who made us, the Rock that form∣ed us, certainly bears a very gracious Inclination to us and our happiness: the Misery of His Creatures can in it self alone be no pleasure to Him.</P>
<P>SEE the <HI>Context: v.</HI> 4. <HI>Behold, all Souls are mine; As the Soul of the Fa∣ther, so also the Soul of the Son is mine; the Soul that sinneth it shall die.</HI> God, the Fa∣ther of Spirits, is a lover of Souls; He thro'ly knows the Excellency and price of them; and what the loss and what the Misery of His <HI>Immortal Workmanship</HI> is; and it can't be plea∣sing to Him to behold it.</P>
<P>[THEREFORE He at first Cre∣ated Man on Earth, as He did the Angels in Heaven in a state of Ho∣liness and Happiness. It was His pleasure that we should have liv'd happy for ever. He made all things Good, and formed Man in His own Image. He planted the <HI>Tree of Life,</HI> the Sacrament of Immortality, in the
<PB N="22" REF="001764_0120_0FB7CB4E73993E68"/>
midst of <HI>Paradice;</HI> He forbad and warn'd Man of <HI>one baneful Tree</HI> set there to try and prove his Obedience and Gratitude to his Creator. Death and Misery was thus forbidden in the Causes of it; Life and Happi∣ness were before given and the care∣ful Preservation of them was thus requir'd. It was with great Displea∣sure that He saw Man <HI>naked</HI> and ruined. <HI>What is it that you have done?</HI> said He—and drove them out of Paradice into Labours and Sorrows, in a World which their Sin had blasted. The <HI>Creators Rest was glori∣ous,</HI> when He saw all things that He had made, and behold they were very Good and Happy; and this wou'd have been the <HI>Rest</HI> of His Soul for ever to have seen His Creatures ever have remain'd so under His Blessing.</P>
<P>TO Conclude, GOD had no plea∣sure in the <HI>Fall of Angels,</HI> nor of <HI>Man;</HI> He made them both Happy: He has pleasure in the Angels that <HI>stand,</HI> and in the Sinners whom His <HI>Grace
<PB N="23" REF="001764_0121_0FB7CB5144D2DD00"/>
recovers.</HI> He chose not their Sin and Ruin, tho' He permitted their own profane Choice; and for it He curs'd them in His Wrath and sore <HI>Dis∣pleasure.</HI>]</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>THE very Threatnings of the Law against Sin, the Threatning of Eternal Death in case of Impenitence in Sin,</HI> shows that GOD has no pleasure that the Sinner should die, but that he repent and live.</P>
<P>THE Intention of the <HI>Threatning</HI> is in Mercy to the Sinner, to pre∣vent his Sin and Destruction: it is to deter and affright us from Sin, that so the woful Effects thereof may not fall upon us. GOD shows us the Evil of Sin, and what a dangerous thing it is to commit it, that we may tremble at the Motion of it, and fly therefrom.</P>
<P>CAN we think that He who warns us of our Danger desires that it should befall us? No, far from it: It were the most cross and perverse Imputation that can be; most absurd, and also most ungrateful and bafe.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="001764_0122_0FB7CB57F449C1E8"/>
THE Threatning does not make the <HI>Effect</HI> of Sin to be what it is: No; <HI>that</HI> had been the same without the Publication of the Curse. That the <HI>Wicked shall die</HI> is founded in the very Nature of Sin; the Holi∣ness and Essential Dominion of GOD make <HI>that</HI> Necessary.</P>
<P>It is not owing to the <HI>Absolute and meer Will</HI> of GOD, that he who Sins shall die; but to the Holiness and <HI>Rectitude</HI> of the Divine Nature, and to the wise and <HI>Righteous Administra∣tion</HI> of His Government.</P>
<P>THE Threatning of God's Word only lets us know what <HI>will be</HI> and <HI>must be</HI> in case of Sin; what the Wis∣dom and Justice of GOD make Ne∣cessary. And why is this made known to us by the <HI>Word,</HI> but for our Warn∣ing; that we may not by Sin, and by continuance therein, bring Death and Damnation upon our selves.</P>
<P>LET us look into <HI>Humane Govern∣ments</HI> and their Laws. These ordain <HI>Death</HI> in many Cases as the <HI>Sanction</HI> necessary to the Ends of Govern∣ment,
<PB N="25" REF="001764_0123_0FB7CB5B90CA4B48"/>
or to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>merit</HI> of the <HI>Crime.</HI> But shall we think now that it is the Will and Pleasure of the Govern∣ment that any shou'd commit these <HI>Capital Crimes</HI> and suffer Death there∣for? Or when the <HI>Judges</HI> legally Condemn the <HI>Convicted Person,</HI> and see that the <HI>Malefactor</HI> be Executed, does it follow that they have plea∣sure in the <HI>Criminals</HI> Death? No, GOD forbid. Yet the Provision of the Law, and the Execution of it is Wise, Necessary, Good; and a ten∣der Care for the Publick. It is to <HI>pre∣vent Transgression</HI> that Death is made the Punishment; and for <HI>this End</HI> the Punishment is told and warn'd of? and the <HI>Meaning</HI> hereof can be no other than this—<HI>that the Authority have no pleasure that any should trans∣gress and Suffer; but however it pleases rather that a Transgressor do suffer than that Right and Wrong, Good and Evil be Confounded; the Order of the World and the Welfare of it lye at the Mercy of every Licentious Wretch.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="001764_0124_0FB7CB5CE5DB73B8"/>
THUS the Threatning of Death against Sin shows that GOD has no pleasure that the Sinner should die.</P>
<P>AND the <HI>Juditial Executions of Pro∣vidence in this Life</HI> do really speak the same thing. Providence hangs up one Criminal in Chains for Warn∣ing and Terror unto others. As of old the <HI>Reason</HI> of the Severities and Executions of the Law was this; Deut. 13. 11. <HI>And all Israel shall hear and fear and do no more wickedly.</HI> The <HI>Tragic End</HI> of one may thus prevent the Transgression and Perishing of many others. The Terror of the Punishment strikes many with Hor∣ror at the Tho't of the Fact. <HI>Smite the Scorner, and the Simple will beware.</HI></P>
<P>IT may be a Mercy to the <HI>Body</HI> to cut off a <HI>Gangreen Member;</HI> and so to the Community to stone an <HI>Achan.</HI> The Public Justice may be Inexora∣ble to a private Criminal, because the public Compassions to the whole Community prevails. <HI>It is Expedient that one Man should die, and that the whole▪ Nation perish not.</HI> The <HI>Sinner</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="001764_0125_0FB7CB604F88AF40"/>
may bring it to that sad pass as to himself, that the Divine Justice may <HI>fix on his Eternal Ruine</HI> and cut him off in his Sin; and yet the Wise and Gracious GOD may Mercifully or∣der and turn it to the <HI>saving many other Souls from Death.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. GOD's <HI>sending His own Son, our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, to die for us,</HI> is the highest Argument of all that He has no pleasure that the Sinner should die. No greater Testi∣mony could GOD give of His Desire of our Salvation. And therefore has He no pleasure that the Sinner shou'd die, because His Soul <HI>has the utmost Complacency</HI> and fullest Satisfaction in the Death of <HI>Christ;</HI> by whom we have received the Attonement.</P>
<P>THE express End of the Incar∣nation and Sufferings of the Son of GOD was to save Souls from Death. And what a <HI>Price</HI> was this for a Soul! now was the Heart of GOD set up∣on saving Sinners? <HI>We see HIM of whom are all things, and by whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all things,</HI> sent upon the Work of
<PB N="28" REF="001764_0126_0FB7CB61CD01BE10"/>
our Redemption from Sin and Death. What a Desire then had GOD there∣of?</P>
<P>THIS Divine and Glorious Person submitted for this End to the deepest Humiliation and Abasement, to bit∣ter Sorrows and to an accursed Death. He was made <HI>Sin</HI> and a <HI>Curse</HI> to de∣liver us from the <HI>same.</HI> He paid in Ransom for our Souls His own Life, His precious Blood. Not only did the Son of GOD become <HI>Man,</HI> but a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> to satisfy the Justice of GOD for Man's Sin. And <HI>therefore did His Father love him,</HI> because He laid down His Life for us. What pleasure then has He in the Life and Salvation of poor Sinners?</P>
<P>WHY else has He provided for it at such an Expence of Grace? and why is the Call, the Offer, Tender and Promise of Life thro' Him so earnestly urged on us? Had GOD desired our Death He might have left us in our <HI>Blood,</HI> and never have said unto us, <HI>Live.</HI> But we see that He had pleasure in the Death of His
<PB N="29" REF="001764_0127_0FB7CB64E1C829B0"/>
own Son, rather than we should die in our Sins. 1 Jo. 4. 9. <HI>In this was manifest the Love of GOD, because He sent His Only-begotten Son that we might live thro' Him.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. AND lastly. It may be argued from <HI>Stories of Scripture Penitents,</HI> that the Holy GOD has no pleasure that the Sinner should die, but rather that he repent and live. Where is the <HI>Instance</HI> of a Penitent whom GOD has not readily and with plea∣sure receiv'd and pardoned? When <HI>David</HI> had so hainously sinned, yet did he no sooner confess, but GOD remitted. When <HI>Peter</HI> had so hai∣nously denied Christ, but thereupon had wept bitterly before GOD, his Sin was never once mentioned a∣gainst him by his Saviour. When <HI>Manasseh</HI> humbled himself greatly before GOD, the Lord GOD of his Father, tho' he had before exceeded in wicked Transgressions, yet was the Lord entreated at his Tears.</P>
<P>WITH what Tenderness and Mer∣cy did <HI>Christ</HI> ever receive the Peni∣tent
<PB N="30" REF="001764_0128_0FB7CB6753F056F0"/>
Sinner? The <HI>Woman at His Feet,</HI> washing them with her Tears, how did He as it were forget, and forbid the Mention of her Sins? The <HI>weep∣ing Person</HI> also bro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to Him for His <HI>Condemnation,</HI> how gently did He re∣claim, by confounding her more guilty <HI>Accusers?</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Publican</HI> stood Abased in the Temple, Imploring Mercy in deep Confusion of Soul, and smit∣ing on his own Breast from the Con∣science of Guilt and Fear of Wrath; how graciously was he dismissed with a Pardon? And when the <HI>Prodigal</HI> return'd unto his Father from his Rebellion and his Riot, saying, <HI>Fa∣ther I have sinned against Heaven and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son;</HI> how tenderly was he received? Luk. 15. 20.<HI>And when he was yet a great way off his Father saw him, and had Compassion on him, and ran, and fell on his Neck and kissed him.</HI> What Joy and Pleasure, Mirth and Feasting, Music and Dancing also follow'd that blessed Evening? <HI>v.</HI> 23.
<PB N="31" REF="001764_0129_0FB7CB7348341130"/>
<HI>Bring hither the fatted Calf and kill it, and let us eat and be Merry; for this my Son was dead and is alive again, he was lost and is found.</HI></P>
<P>THESE <HI>Instances</HI> are so many strong Proofs of GOD's Pleasure, not in the Death of Sinners, but in their Repentance.</P>
<P>USE I. <HI>WE see the Adorable Good∣ness of the Lord our GOD, the Glory and Riches of His Grace and Mercy.</HI> The Exaltation of it lies in this, That tho' Sin be infinitely hateful to Him, and provoking, yet that he seeks and endeavours the Repentance of Sin∣ners with so great Desire. O how glorious, how dear and amiable shou'd this render the Name and Ways of our GOD unto us! Mic. 7. 18, 19. <HI>Who is a GOD like unto Thee, that par∣doneth Iniquity, and passeth by Trans∣gression—? He retaineth not His Anger for ever, because He delighteth in Mer∣cy. He will turn again, He will have Compassion upon us: He will subdue our Iniquities: and Thou wilt cast all their Sins in the depth of the Sea.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="001764_0130_0FB7CB7553D62BB8"/>
II. WE learn <HI>what Compassion we owe unto the Wicked, and how we should endeavour their Repentance and Salva∣tion.</HI> It should be a most sorrowful thing to us to see Men Sin against GOD and damn their own Souls. There should be Joy on Earth as there is in Heaven over one Sinner that repenteth. Our hearts desire and prayer for others should be that they may be saved, and we should count our selves happy if we may be any ways Instrumental therein. This is true <HI>Love</HI> to Men, true <HI>Devotion</HI> to∣ward GOD.</P>
<P>III. OUR Doctrine brings <HI>Convi∣ction to the Wicked, the Ungodly and Impenitent,</HI> and on diverse Accounts do they stand <HI>Condemned</HI> by it.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>AS having pleasure in their own Death.</HI> GOD says to them, <HI>Why will you die?</HI> This He <HI>Charges</HI> upon you, and justly <HI>Complains</HI> of it. He says, <HI>You hate your own Soul, you love Death.</HI> O how <HI>Unnatural</HI> and worse than <HI>Brutish</HI> is this? A <HI>natural brute Beast</HI> flies from Death, and from every∣thing
<PB N="33" REF="001764_0131_0FB7CB76E12D83D8"/>
that hurts its Life; but mad as <HI>Men</HI> are, they Murder their own Souls, void equally of pity and of fear.</P>
<P N="2">2. OUR Doctrine reproves and con∣demns <HI>all them thao have pleasure in the Sins of others:</HI> whether <HI>Tempting</HI> them to Sin, <HI>Approving</HI> them, <HI>Indulg∣ing</HI> them in it, or <HI>Rejoicing</HI> at it and <HI>Insulting</HI> over them. The latter is as <HI>barbarous,</HI> as the former <HI>treacherous;</HI> but all <HI>Impious.</HI> Rom. 1. 32. <HI>Who knowing the Judgment of GOD, that they who do such things are worthy of Death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.</HI> Rom. 14. 15. <HI>Destroy not him—for whom Christ died.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Satan is highly pleas'd and grati∣fied in thy Sin and Impenitence.</HI> He de∣sires thy Damnation: he seeks thy Death. You grieve and offend GOD, and Murder your self, to gratify his Spleen; to satisfy his Lust against thy Soul. As the <HI>Fowler</HI> is pleased to see the Bird taken in his Snare; as the <HI>Lion</HI> is pleas'd when he is de∣vouring
<PB N="34" REF="001764_0132_0FB7CB813A1366B0"/>
the Prey, or as a malicious <HI>Enemy</HI> when he has his will and lust upon his hated <HI>Foe;</HI> so is the <HI>Devil</HI> pleas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in the Ruine of thy Soul. There is <HI>Joy in Hell</HI> at thy Sin, and in thy Destruction.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>THY Damnation will be owing to thy self at last, thy own wilful Choice of Death in the Causes of it.</HI> Thou art a <HI>Self-destroyer,</HI> and canst have no Excuse, nor lay the Blame of thy Eternal Misery on any one but thy self. <HI>Thou hast a Devil and art Mad, he goeth about to kill thee.</HI> With the furious <HI>Demoniac</HI> thou stabbest thy self. You act against the <HI>deepest Prin∣ciple</HI> in Nature, even <HI>Self-preservation.</HI> A Devil let loose upon you could not do you more hurt than you do to your self. <HI>False, pitiless, cruel</HI> and <HI>base</HI> to your self. And such Refle∣ctions will be your exquisite and eternal Torment.</P>
<P>IV. ON the other hand, <HI>The Doctrine is full of Comfort and Encou∣ragement to every poor and contrite Spi∣rit,</HI> that trembleth at GOD's Word,
<PB N="35" REF="001764_0133_0FB7CB85C160EF90"/>
feels the plague of its own Heart, and fears the Wrath of GOD; that is mourning in the Conscience of Sin, and in the Apprehension of the Curse due thereto.</P>
<P>IS Sin your Burden, GOD your Fear, Grace your Desire? and do you doubt whether GOD will delight to shew thee Mercy? let me rebuke thy Unbelief, and warn thee of the Wickedness thereof.</P>
<P>THO' your Sins are many, great and hainous; tho' they may have been long persisted in and often re∣peated; yet GOD seeks thy Repen∣tance, and desires you wou'd turn and live: He would glorify His re∣newing Grace, and His pardoning Mercy upon thee. Have you <HI>consider∣ed</HI> and <HI>turned?</HI> then all your Trans∣gressions shall <HI>not be mentioned</HI> against you; <HI>you shall surely live, you shall not die.</HI></P>
<P>TRUE, You <HI>deserve</HI> Death for past Sins, and GOD might have struck you dead in 'em, if He had any pleasure in your Death: but He
<PB N="36" REF="001764_0134_0FB7CB8686F51CD8"/>
spares you, and continues the Offers of Grace, Pardon and Life to you.</P>
<P>OUR <HI>Text</HI> for ever forbids and rebukes <HI>Despair,</HI> wou'd <HI>revive</HI> the Spirit of the Humble, and encou∣rage them that are of a <HI>fearful Heart:</HI> It wou'd lift up the <HI>weak</HI> hands, and strengthen the <HI>feeble</HI> knees; make the <HI>lame</HI> man to leap as an Hart, and the tongue of the <HI>dumb</HI> to sing.</P>
<P>V. AND lastly, <HI>Let the Use be in an earnest Exhortation unto Repentance.</HI> The <HI>Use</HI> which the <HI>Context</HI> makes for us: <HI>v.</HI> 31, 32. <HI>Cast away from you all your Transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed, and make you a new Heart and a new Spirit; for why will ye die, O House of Israel? For I have no plea∣sure in the Death of him that dieth, saith the Lord GOD: wherefore turn your selves, and live ye.</HI></P>
<P>I will only urge <HI>this</HI> by these two <HI>Considerations.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THE Goodness of GOD shou'd lead you to Repentance.</HI> GOD seeks your Repentance from the most tender Compassion to thy poor Soul. O let
<PB N="37" REF="001764_0135_0FB7CB8805408350"/>
it <HI>soften</HI> thy hard Heart: do not <HI>har∣den</HI> it against the Mercies of GOD: let Divine Goodness win and melt it: let thy Saviour's love to thy Soul, constrain and draw forth thy Soul unto Him again Let the <HI>Tears</HI> and <HI>Blood</HI> of thy Saviour affect thee. It is a dreadful Case to perish in con∣tempt and in spite of Infinite Mer∣cy it self, labouring to hinder thy Ruine.</P>
<P N="2">2. IF the Goodness of GOD <HI>cannot</HI> lead thee to Repentance, <HI>then GOD will have pleasure in they Eternal Dam∣nation.</HI> He wou'd not now have you die; it wou'd please Him to see you repent and live; but if you de∣spise and slight this His Goodness, and continue to do so, and die Im∣penitent, the Wrath and Vengeance of GOD will then take place, and have its Satisfaction. <HI>He that made you will not have Mercy on you, and He that formed you will show you no Fa∣vour.</HI></P>
<P><HI>TURN or die.</HI> O might <HI>the Word</HI> fasten on the foolish Heart of every
<PB N="38" REF="001764_0136_0FB7CB934482F7E0"/>
one that goeth on still in his Tres∣passes. Think not at last of finding Mercy, nor of dying in Peace, tho' you for the present go on in Sin: the Lord will not spare you, but the <HI>Anger of the Lord and His Jealousy will smo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k</HI> against that Man, and all the <HI>Curses</HI> of the Law shall lye upon him, and the LORD shall blot out his Name from under Heaven. Jer. 13. 14. <HI>I will not pity, nor spare, nor have Mercy.</HI></P>
<P>FOR our <HI>Text</HI> and <HI>Doctrine</HI> we have the <HI>Oath</HI> of GOD; <HI>As I live saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure that the Sinner should die:</HI> but have we not <HI>His Oath</HI> too for the Impe∣nitent Sinners Destruction? Deut. 32. 40, 41. <HI>For I lift up my Hand to Heaven, and say, I live for ever. If I whet my glittering Sword, and mine Hand take hold on Judgment; I will render Vengeance to mine Enemies, and will reward them that hate me.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="001764_0137_0FB7CB9503227998"/>
BUT I cannot <HI>Conclude</HI> without casting an Eye of <HI>tender Compassions</HI> on the poor <HI>Condemned Person</HI> before us; and O that GOD wou'd please to Enable her to apprehend the <HI>a∣bounding Riches of His Glorious Grace</HI> and Compassions to the chief of Sin∣ners, and glorify the <HI>same</HI> unto her.</P>
<P>YOU have heard, <HI>poor Margaret,</HI> (and O might it be to your everla∣sting Comfort and for your eternal Salvation that you have heard) that the Holy and most Merciful GOD has <HI>no pleasure at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll that the Sinner should die, but that the Sinner do repent and live.</HI> Now why should not your Soul be overcome, and all the Wick∣edness thereof, by the Mercies of GOD? why should not thy hard Heart be softened and melted into floods of Tears for thy Sins, that the pardoning Mercy of GOD may be magnified toward thee!</P>

of blood too</HI> than it is; (tho' it be very bad, and how can you think it cou'd be worse than it is?) yet there is no reason for thee to despair of GOD's Mercy. It is only thy own hardness and Impenitency that can exclude thee from it. The glorious <HI>GOD</HI> pi∣ties thee, the <HI>People</HI> of GOD pity thee; <HI>O miserable Woman</HI> pity thy self, have compassion on thy own Soul, and cry mightily to thy Savi∣our that thou mayest find Mercy.</P>
<P>NEITHER <HI>GOD nor Man</HI> have pleasure in thy Death. Thy <HI>Judges</HI> on Earth have no pleasure in thy Condemnation and Execution, but they can't answer it to GOD or Man to spare thee and suffer thee to live. The <HI>Murderer</HI> by the Law of GOD <HI>must surely be put to Death, and he that sheddeth mans blood by man must his blood be shed.</HI> But tho' it be unavoidable that you must die by the <HI>Hand of Ju∣stice</HI> here, yet let me however tell thee that GOD has no pleasure <HI>in your Eternal Death.</HI> Indeed GOD has infinite pleasure in hating your Sin,
<PB N="41" REF="001764_0139_0FB7CB97C8A14250"/>
and in glorifying His Justice in all the Demands of it against you if you continue Impenitent; God will with Ineffable pleasure fulfil and ex∣ecute all His Threatning against Im∣penitent Sinners, and your Eternal Sufferings in Hell will never give Him any perturbation and disrest. But GOD has as much pleasure in fulfill∣ing all His gracious Promises to the repenting Sinner, the penitent Be∣liever in Jesus Christ. <HI>Say unto them, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>WHEREFORE Believe me, <HI>Mar∣garet;</HI> (or rather Believe the true and Merciful GOD, who has said it in His Word, and revealed so much of His own Merciful Nature to thee that thou mayest believe it; and has given His own Son to die for the chief of Sinners, and has chosen many such unto Eternal Salvation by him) Be∣lieve me I say, in what I therefore speak to you from the Blessed GOD; <HI>If you do at last die in your Sins and perish for ever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> have

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n that account; so that thou shalt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eely confess, that if He damn thee <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or ever He is most holy and just in doing so; then <HI>He will also discover <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o thee the Glory of His own Grace and Mercy in saving such a wretch as thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt;</HI> in pardoning such Guilts as thine are.

Prayer, <HI>To day thou shalt be with me!</HI> Ah poor <HI>Margaret,</HI> why should not you lift up your Soul unto <HI>your Savi∣our in His Kingdom,</HI> and make <HI>that Prayer?</HI> and why may not you hear <HI>that Answer</HI> from His glorious Lips?</P>
<P>O that thy Soul were <HI>prepared</HI> for the Consolations in Christ! that God might pour the <HI>soft healing Oyl</HI> into thy wounded Soul! that there were a <HI>contrite Heart</HI> to seek receive and feel it!
