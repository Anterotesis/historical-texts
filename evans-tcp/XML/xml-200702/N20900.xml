<HEAD>THE AGE OF REASON.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been my intention, for several years past, to publish my thoughts upon religion. I am well aware of the difficulties that attend the subject; and, from that consideration, had reserved it to a more advanced period of life. I intended it to be the last offering I should make to my fellow citizens of all nations; and that, at a time, when the purity of the motive that induced me to it, could not admit of a question, even by those who might disapprove the work.</P>
<P>The circumstance that has now taken place in France, of the total abolition of the whole national order of priest∣hood, and of every thing appertaining to compulsive sys∣tems of religion, and compulsive articles of faith, has not only precipitated my intention, but rendered a work of this kind exceedingly necessary; lest, in the general wreck of superstition, of false systems of government, and false theology, we lose sight of morality, of humanity, and of the theology that is true.</P>
<P>As several of my colleagues, and others of my fel∣low citizens of France, have given me the example of making their voluntary and individual profession of faith, I also will make mine; and I do this with all that sin∣cerity
<PB N="4" REF="027458_0003_0FD3D92ED80C0568"/>
and frankness with which the mind of man commu∣nicates with itself.</P>
<P>I believe in one God, and no more; and I hope for happiness beyond this life.</P>
<P>I believe the equality of man, and I believe that re∣ligious duties consist in doing justice, loving mercy, and endeavouring to make our fellow creatures happy.</P>
<P>But, lest it should be supposed that I believe many other things in addition to these, I shall, in the progress of this work, declare the things I do not believe, and my reasons for not believing them.</P>
<P>I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jew∣ish church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkish church, by the Protestant church, nor by any church that I know of. My own mind is my own church.</P>
<P>All national institutions of churches, whether Jew∣ish, Christian, or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions set up, to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.</P>
<P>I do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise. They have the same right to their belief as I have to mine. But it is necessary to the happiness of man, that he be mentally faithful to himself Infidelity does not consist in believing, or in disbelieving: it consists in professing to believe what he does not be∣lieve.</P>
<P>It is impossible to calculate the moral mischief, if I may so express it, that mental lying has produced in society. When <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> man has so far corrupted and prosti∣tuted the chastity of his mind, as to subscribe his profes∣sional belief to things he does not believe, he has prepared himself for the commission of every other crime. He takes up the trade of a priest for the sake of gain, and in order to <HI>qualify</HI> himself for that trade, he begins with perjury.</P>
<P>Can we conceive anything more destructive to moral∣ity than this?</P>
<P>Soon after I had published the pamphlet, COMMON SENSE, in America, I saw the exceeding probabili∣ty
<PB N="5" REF="027458_0004_0FD3D931787487A8"/>
that a Revolution in the System of Government would be followed by a Revolution in the System of Religion. The adulterous connection of church and state, wherever it had taken place, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, had so effectually prohibited, by pains and penalties, every discussion upon established creeds, and upon first princi∣ples of religion, that until the system of government should be changed, those subjects could not be brought fairly and openly before the world: but that whenever this should be done, a revolution in the system of religion would fol∣low. Human inventions and priest-craft would be de∣tected, and man would return to the pure unmixed and unadulterated belief of one God, and no more.</P>
<P>Every national church or religion has established it∣self by pretending some special mission from God com∣municated to certain individuals. The Jews have their Moses; The Christians their Jesus Christ, their apostles and saints; and the Turks their Mahomet; as if the way to God was not open to every man alike.</P>
<P>Each of those churches show certain books which they call <HI>revelation,</HI> or the word of God. The Jews say that their word of God was given by God to Moses face to face; the Christians say, that their word of God came by divine inspiration; and the Turks say, that their word of God (the Koran) was brought by an angel from heaven. Each of those churches accuses the other of unbelief; and, for my own part, I disbelieve them all.</P>
<P>As it is necessary to affix right ideas to words, I will, before I proceed further into the subject, offer some ob∣servations on the word <HI>revelation.</HI> Revelation, when applied to religion, means something communicated <HI>imme∣diately</HI> from God to man.</P>
<P>No one w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> deny or dispute the power of the Al∣mighty to make such a communication if he pleases. But admitting, for the sake of a case, that something has been revealed to a certain person, and not revealed to any other person, it is revelation to that person only. When he tells to a second person, a second to a third, a third to a fourth, and so on, it ceases to be a revelation to all those persons. It is revelation to the first person
<PB REF="027458_0005_0FD3D9318053FC00"/>
only, and <HI>hear-say</HI> to every other; and consequently they are not obliged to believe it.</P>
<P>It is a contradiction in terms and ideas to call any thing a revelation that comes to us at second hand, either verbally or in writing. Revelation is necessarily limit∣ted to the first communication. After this, it is only an account of something which that person says was a re∣velation made to him; and though he may find himself obliged to believe it, it cannot be incumbent upon me to believe it in the same manner, for it was not a revela∣tion made to <HI>me,</HI> and I have only his word for it that it was made to <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>When Moses told the children of Israel that he re∣ceived the two tables of the commandments from the hand of God, they were not obliged to believe him, be∣cause they had no other authority for it than his telling them so; and I have no other authority for it than some historian telling me so. The commandments carry no internal evidence of divinity with them. They contain some good moral precepts, such as any man qualified to be a lawgiver or a legislator could produce himself, with∣out having recourse to supernatural intervention.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is, however, necessary to except the declaration, which says, that God <HI>visits the sins of the fathers upon the children.</HI> It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> contrary to every principle of moral justice.</NOTE></P>
<P>When I am told that the Koran was written in heaven, and brought to Mahomet by an angel, the ac∣count comes to near the same kind of hearsay evidence, and second hand authority, as the former. I did not see the angel myself, and therefore have a right not to believe it.</P>
<P>When also I am told that a woman, called the Vir∣gin Mary, said, or gave out that she was with child with∣out any cohabitation, with a man, and that her betrothed husband, Joseph, said, that an angel told him so, I have a right to believe them or not; such a circumstance re∣quired a much stronger evidence than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> bare word for it; but we have not even this; for neither Joseph nor Mary wrote any such matter themselves. It is only reported by others that <HI>they said so.</HI> It is hearsay upon
<PB N="7" REF="027458_0006_0FD3D932D54C58C8"/>
hearsay, and I do not chuse to rest my belief upon such evidence.</P>
<P>It is, however, not difficult to account for the cred∣it that was given to the story of Jesus Christ being the Son of God. He was born at a time when the heathen mythology had still some fashion and repute in the world, and that mythology had prepared the people for the be∣lief of such a story. Almost all the extraordinary men that lived under the heathen mythology were reputed to be the sons of some of their gods. It was not a new thing at that time to believe a man to have been celes∣tially begotten; the intercourse of gods with women was then a matter of familiar opinion. Their Jupiter, ac∣cording to their accounts, had cohabited with hundreds: the story, therefore, had nothing in it, either new, won∣derful or obscene: it was conformable to the opinions that then prevailed among the people called Gentiles, or mythologists, and it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> those people only that believed it. The Jews who had kept strictly to the belief of one God, and no more, and who had always rejected the heathen mythology, never credited the story.</P>
<P>It is curious to observe how the theory of what is called the Christian church, sprung out of the tail of the heathen mythology. A direct incorporation took place in the first instance, by making the reputed found∣er to be celestially begotten. The trinity of Gods that then followed was no other than a reduction of the form∣er plurality, which was about twenty or thirty thousand. The statue of Mary succeeded the statue of Diana of Ephesus. The deification of heroes changed into the cannonization of saints. The mythologists had gods for every thing; the Christian mythologists had saints for every thing. The church became as crouded with the one, as the pantheon had been with the other; and Rome was the place of both. The Christian theory is little else than the idolatry of the ancient mythologists ac∣commodated to the purposes of power and revenue; and it yet remains to reason and philosophy to abolish the amphibious fraud.</P>
<P>Nothing that is here said can apply, even with the most distant respect, to the real character of Jesus Christ▪
<PB N="8" REF="027458_0007_0FD3D95B088993D0"/>
He was virtuous and an amiable man. The morality that he preached and practised was of the most benevo∣lent kind; and though similar systems of morality had been preached by Confucius, and by some of the Greek philosophers, many years before, by the Quakers since, and by many good men in all ages, it has not been ex∣ceeded by any.</P>
<P>Jesus Christ wr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e no account of himself, of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> birth, parentage, or any thing else. Not a line of what is called the New Testament is of his writing. The history of him is altogether the work of other people; and as to the account given of his resurrection and ascen∣sion, it was the necessary counterpart to the story of his birth. His historians having brought him into the world in a supernatural manner, were obliged to take him out again in the same manner, or the first part of the story must have fallen to the ground.</P>
<P>The wretched contrivance with which this latter part is told, exceeds every thing that went before it. The first part, that of the miraculous conception, was not a thing that admitted of publicity; and therefore the tellers of this part of the story had this advantage, that though they might not be credited, they could not be de∣rected. They could not be expected to prove it, because it was not one of those things that admitted of proof, and it was impossible that the person of whom it was told could prove it himself.</P>
<P>But the resurrection of a dead person from the grave, and his aseension through the air, is a thing very different as to the evidence it admits of, to the invisible conception of a child in the womb. The resurrection and ascension, supposing them to have taken place, ad∣mitted of public and occular demonstration, like that of the ascension of a balloon, or the sun at noon day, to all Jerusalem at least. A thing which every body is re∣quired to believe, requires that the proof and evidence of it should be equal to all, and universal; and as the public visibility of this last related act was the only evidence that could give sanction to the former part, the whole of it falls to the ground, because the evidence never was giv∣en: Instead of this, a small number of persons, not
<PB N="9" REF="027458_0008_0FD3D95C8C08B810"/>
more than eight or nine, are introduced as proxies for the whole world, to say they <HI>saw it,</HI> and all the rest of the world are called upon to believe it. But it appears that Thomas did not believe the resurrection; and, as they say, would not believe without having occular and manual demonstration himself. <HI>So neither will I;</HI> and the reason is equally as good for me and for every other person as for Thomas.</P>
<P>It is in vain to attempt to palliate or disguise this matter The story so far as relates to the supernatural part, has every mark of fraud and imposition stamped up∣on the face of it. Who were the authors of it, is im∣possible for us now to know, as it is for us to be assur∣ed, that the books in which the account is related, were written by the persons whose names they bear. The best surviving evidence we have respecting this af∣fair is the Jews. They are regularly descended from the people who lived in the times this resurrection and ascension is said to have happened, and they say <HI>it is not true.</HI> It has long appeared to me a strange incon∣sistency to cite the Jews, as a proof of the truth of the story. It is just the same as if a man were to say, I will prove the truth of what I have told you, by producing the people who say it is false.</P>
<P>That such a person as Jesus Christ existed, and that he was crucified, which was the mode of execution at that day, are historical relations strictly within the limits of probability. He preached most excellent mo∣rality, and the equality of man; but he preached also against the corruptions and avarice of the Jewish priests; and this brought upon him the hatred and vengeance of the whole order of priesthood. The accusa∣tion which those priests brought against him, was that of sedition and conspiracy against the Roman government, to which the Jews were then subject and tributary; and it is not improbable that the Roman gov∣ernment might have some secret apprehension of the ef∣fects of his doctrine as well as the Jewish priests; neither is it improbable that Jesus Christ had in contemplation the delivery of the Jewish nation from the bondage of
<PB N="10" REF="027458_0009_0FD3D95E0B9D09A8"/>
the Romans. Between the two, however, this virtuous reformer and revolutionist lost his life.</P>
<P>It is upon this plain narrative of facts, together with another case I am going to mention, that the Christian mythologists, calling themselves the christian church, have erected their fable, which, for absurdity and extrav∣agance is not exceeded by any thing that is to be found in the mythology of the ancients.</P>
<P>The ancient mythologists tell that the race of Gi∣ants made war against Jupiter, and that one of them threw an hundred rocks against him at one throw; that Jupiter defeated him with thunder, and confined him af∣terwards under Mount Etna: and that every time the Giant turns himself, Mount Etna belches fire. It is here easy to see that the circumstance of the mountain, that of its being a vulcano, suggested the idea of the fable; and that the fable is made to fit and wind itself up with that circumstance.</P>
<P>The Christian mythologists tell that their Satan made war against the Almighty, who defeated him, and con∣find him afterwards, not under a mountain, but in a pit. It is here easy to see that the first fable suggested the idea of the second; for the fable of Jupiter and the Giants was told many a hundred years before that of Satan.</P>
<P>Thus far the ancient and the Christian mythologists differ very little from each other. But the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atter have contrived to carry the matter much farther. They have contrived to connect the fabulous part of the story of Jesus Christ, with the fable originating from Mount Etna: and in order to make all the parts of the story <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ye to∣gether, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> taken to their aid the tradition of the Jews; for the Christian mythology is made up partly from the ancient mythology, and partly from the Jewish traditions.</P>
<P>The Christian mythologists, after having confined Satan in a pit, were obliged to let him out again, to bring on the sequel of the fable. He is then introduced into the garden of Eden in the shape of a snake, or a serpent, and in that shape he enters into familiar conver∣sation with Eve, who is no ways surprised to hear a
<PB N="11" REF="027458_0010_0FD3D95F89CA8FB0"/>
snake talk; and the issue of this t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te-à-tète is, that he persuades her to eat an apple, and the eating of that ap∣ple damns all mankind.</P>
<P>After giving Satan this triumph over the whole creation, one would have supposed that the church my∣thologists would have been kind enough to send him back again to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pit; or, if they had not done this, that they would have put a mountain upon him (for they say that their faith can remove a mountain) or have put him <HI>under</HI> a mountain, as the former mythol∣ogists had done, to prevent his getting again among the women, and doing more mischief. But instead of this, they leave him at large, without even obliging him to give his parole. The secret of which is, that they could not do without him; and after being at the trouble of making him, they bribed him to stay. They promised him ALL the Jews, ALL the Turks by anticipation, nine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>enths of the world beside, and Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omet into the bargain. After this, who can doubt the bountifulness of the Christian mythology?</P>
<P>Having thus made an insurrection and a battle in heaven, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ich none of the combatants could be either killed or wounded—put Satan into the pit—let him out again—given him a triumph over the who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e creation—damned all manking for the eating of an apple, the Chris∣tian mythologists bring the two ends of their fable togeth∣er. They represent this virtuous and amiable man, Jesus Christ, to be at once both God and man, and also the Son of God celestially begotten, on purpose to be sa∣crificed, because they say, that Eve in her longing had eaten an apple.</P>
<P>Putting aside every thing that might excite laugh∣ter by its absurdity, or detestation by its prophaneness, and confining ourselves merely to an examination of the parts, it is impossible to conceive a story more deroga∣tory to the Almighty, more inconsistent with his wisdom, more contradictor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to his power, than this story is.</P>
<P>In order to make for it a foundation to rise upon, the inventors were under the necessity of giving to the being whom they call Satan, a power equally as great▪
<PB N="12" REF="027458_0011_0FD3D96108F53A68"/>
if not greater than they attribute to the Almighty. They have not only given him the power of liberating himself from the pit, after what they call his fall, but they have made that power increase afterwards to infinity. Before this fail, they represent him only as an angel of limited existence, as they represent the rest. After his fall, he becomes, by their account, omnipresent. He exists ev∣ery where, and at the same time. He occupies the whole immensity of space.</P>
<P>Not content with this deification of Satan, they represent him as defeating by stratagem, in the shape of an animal of the creation, all the power and wisdom of the Almighty. They represent him as having compelled the Almighty to the <HI>direct necessity</HI> either of surrendering the whole of the creation to the government and sovereign∣ty of this Satan, or of capitulating for its redemption, by coming down upon earth and exhibiting himself upon a cross in the shape of a man.</P>
<P>Had the inventors of this story told it the contrary way, that is, had they represented the Almighty as com∣pelling Satan to exhibit <HI>himself</HI> on a cross in the shape of a snake, as a punishment for his new transgression, the story would have been less absurd, less contradictory. But instead of this, they make the transgressor triumph and the Almighty fall.</P>
<P>That many good men have believed this strange fable, and lived very good lives under that belief (for credulity is not a crime) is what I have no doubt of. In the first place, they were educated to believe it, and they would have believed any thing else in the same man∣ner. There are also many who have been so enthusi∣astically enraptured by what they have conceived to be the infinite love of God to man, in making a sacrifice of himself, that the vehemence of the idea has forbidden and deterred them from examining into the absurdity and prophaneness of the story. The more unnatural any thing is, the more is it capable of becoming the object of dismal admiration.</P>
<P>But if objects of gratitude and admiration are our desire, do they not present themselves every hour to our
<PB N="13" REF="027458_0012_0FD3D9628B161E98"/>
eyes? Do we not see a fair creation prepared to receive us the instant we are born, a world furnished to our hands that cost us nothing? Is it we that light up the sun; that pour down the rain; and fill the earth with abundance? Whether we sleep or wake, the vast machinery of the universe still goes on. Are these things, and the blessings they indicate in future, nothing to us? Can our gross feelings be excited by no other subjects than tragedy and suicide? Or is the gloomy pride of man become so intolerable, that nothing can flatter it but a sacrifice of the Creator?</P>
<P>I know that this bold investigation will alarm many, but it would be paying too great a compliment to their credulity to forbear it upon that account. The times and the subject demand it to be done. The suspicion that the theory of what is called the Christian church is fabulous, is becoming very extensive in all countries: and it will be a consolation to men staggering under that suspicion, and doubting what to believe and what to dis∣believe, to see the subject freely investigated. I therefore pass on to an examination of the books called the Old and the New Testament.</P>
<P>These books, beginning with Genesis and ending with Revelations (which by the bye, is a book of riddles that requires a Revelation to explain it) are, we are told, the word of God. It is therefore proper for us to know who told us so, that we may know what credit to give the report. The answer to this question is, that nobody can tell, except that we tell one another so. The case, however, historically appears to be as follows:</P>
<P>When the church mythologists established their sys∣tem, they collected all the writings they could find, and managed them as they pleased. It is a matter altogether of uncertainty to us, whether such of the writings as now appear, under the name of the Old and the New Testa∣ment, are in the same state in which those collectors say they found them; or whether they added, altered, abridg∣ed or dressed them up.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="027458_0013_0FD3D96661354438"/>
Be this as it may, they decided by vote, which of the books, out of the collection they had made, should be the WORD OF GOD, and which should not. They re∣jected several: they voted others to be doubtful, such as the books called the Apo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raphy; and those books which had a majority of votes, were voted to be the word of God.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Book of Luke was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by a majesity of one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly.</NOTE> Had they voted otherwise, all the people, since calling themselves Christians, had believed otherwise; for the belief of the one comes from the vote of the oth∣er. Who the people were that did all this, we know nothing of; they call themselves by the general name of the church: and this is all we know of the matter.</P>
<P>As we have no other external evidence or authority for believing those books to be the word of God than what I have mentioned, which is no evidence or author∣ity at all, I come, in the next place, to examine the in∣ternal evidence contained in the books themselves.</P>
<P>IN the former part of this essay I have spoken of revelation. I now proceed further with that subject, for the purpose of applying it to the books in question.</P>
<P>Revelation is a communication of something, which the person to whom that thing is revealed, did not know before. For if I have done a thing or seen it done, it needs no revelation to tell me I have done it, or seen it, nor to enable me to tell it, or to write it.</P>
<P>Revelation, therefore, cannot be applied to any thing done upon earth of which man is himself the actor or the witness; and consequently all the historical and an∣ecdotal part of the Bible, which is almost the whole of it, is not within the meaning and compass of the word re∣velation, and therefore is not the word of God.</P>
<P>When Samson ran off with the gate-posts of Gaza, if he ever did so, and whether he did or no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is nothing to us▪ or when he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Delilah, or caught his foxes, or did
<PB N="15" REF="027458_0014_0FD3D9681CF8B7B0"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny thing else, what has revelation to do with these things? If they were facts, he could tell them himself; or his secretary, if he kept one, could write them, if they were worth either telling or writing; and if they were fictions, revelation could not make them true; and wheth∣er true or not, we are neither the better nor the wiser for knowing them.—When we contemplate the immensity of that Being who directs and governs the incomprehen∣sible WHOLE, of which the utmost ken of human sight can discover but a part, we ought to feel shame at calling such paltry stories the word of God.</P>
<P>As to the account of the creation, with which the book of Genesis opens, it has all the appearance of being a tradition which the Israelites had among them before they came into Egypt; and after their departure from that country, they put it at the head of their history, without telling, as it is most probable they did not know, how they came by it. The manner in which the ac∣count opens, shews it to be traditionary. It begins ab∣ruptly. It is nobody speaks. It is nobody that hears. It is addressed to nobody. It has neither first, second, nor third person. It has every criterion of being a tra∣dition. It has no voucher. Moses does not take it upon himself by introducing it with the formality that he uses on other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sions, such as that of saying, "<HI>The Lord spake <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Moses, saying.</HI>"</P>
<P>Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een called the Mosaic account of the creation, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at a loss to conceive. Moses, I believe, was too good a judge of such subject to put his name to that account. He had been educated among the Egyp∣tians, who were people <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>well skilled in science, and par∣ticularly in astron<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> any people of their day; and the silence and cap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Moses observes in not au∣thenticating the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> a good negative evidence that he neither told it, nor believed it. The case is, that ev∣ery nation of people has been world-makers, and the Is∣raelites had as much right to set up the trade of world-making as any of the rest; and as Moses was not an Isra∣elite, he did not choose to contradict the tradition. The
<PB N="16" REF="027458_0015_0FD3D96A0F6471E8"/>
account, however, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> harmless; and this is more than can be said of many other parts of the Bible.</P>
<P>When we read the ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the cruel and torturous executions, the unre∣lenting vindictiveness, with which more than half the Bi∣ble is filled, it would be more consistent that we called it the word of a demon, than the word of God. It is a history of wickedness, that has served to corrupt and brutalize mankind; and, for my own part, I sincerely detest it, as I detest every thing that is cruel.</P>
<P>We scarcely meet with any thing, a few phrases ex∣cepted, but what deserves either our abhorrence, or our contempt, till we come to the miscellaneous parts of the Bible. In the anonymous publications in the Psalms and the Book of Job, more particularly, the latter, we find a great deal of elevated sentiment reverentially expressed of the power and benignity of the Almighty; but they stand on no higher rank than many other compositions on similar subjects as well before that time as since.</P>
<P>The Proverbs, which are said to be Solomon's, though most probably a collection (because they discover a knowledge of life, which his situation excluded him from knowing) are an instructive table of ethics. They are inferior in keenness to the proverbs of the Spaniards, and not more wise and oeconomical than those of the American Franklin.</P>
<P>All the remaining parts of the Bible, generally known by the name of the prophets, are the works of the Jewish poets and itinerant preachers, who mixed poetry, anecdote and devotion together: and those works still re∣tain the air and stile of poetry, though in translation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>As there are many readers who do not see that a compo∣sition is poetry unless it be in rhyme, it is for their information that I add this note.</P>
<P>Poetry consists principally in two things: Imagery and com∣position. The composition of poetry differs from that of prose in the manner of mixing long and short syllables together. Take a long syllable out of a line of poetry, and put a short one in the room of it, or put a long syllable where a short one should be, and that line will loose its poetical harmony. It will have an effect upon the line like that of misplacing a note in a song.</P>
<P>The imagery in those books called the Prophets, appertains altogether to poetry. It is fictio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and often extravagant, and not admissible in any other kind of writing than poetry.</P>
<P>To shew that these writings are composed in poetical num∣bers, I will take ten syllables as they stand in the book, and make a line of the same number of syllables (heroic measure) that shall rhyme with the last word. It will then be seen, that the composition of those books is poetical measure. The instance I shall first produce is from Isaiah.</P>
<L>"<HI>Hear, O ye heavens, and give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> O earth.</HI>"</L>
<L>'Tis God himself that calls attention <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orth.</L>
<P>Another instance I shall quote is from the mournful Jeremiah, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o which I shall add two other lines <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or the purpose of carrying out the figure, and she wing the intention of the poet.</P>
<L>"<HI>O that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> head were waters and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine eyes</HI>"</L>
<L>Were fountains, flowing like the liquid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ies;</L>
<L>Then would I give the mighty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> release,</L>

<P><PB N="17" REF="027458_0016_0FD3D96BD600E770"/>
There is not throughout the whole book called the Bible, any word that describes to us what we call a poet, nor any word that describes what we call poetry. The case is, that the word <HI>prophet</HI> to which latter times have affixed a new idea, was the Bible word for poet, and the word <HI>prophesying</HI> meant the art of making poetry. It also meant the art of playing poetry to a tune upon any instrument of music.</P>
<P>We read prophesying with pipes, taborets and horns; of prophesying with harps, with psalteries, with cymbals, and with every other instrument of music then in fashion. Were we now to speak of prophesying with a fiddle, or with a pipe and tabor, the expression would have no meaning, or would appear ridiculous, and to some people contemptuous, because we have changed the meaning of the word.</P>
<P>We are told of Saul being among the <HI>prophets,</HI> and also that he prophesied; but we are not told what they <HI>prophesied,</HI> nor what he <HI>prophesied.</HI> The case is, there was nothing to tell; for these prophets were a company of musicians and poets; and Saul joined in the concert; and this was called <HI>prophesying.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="027458_0017_0FD3D97105F8F228"/>
The account given of this affair in the book called Samuel, is, that Saul met a <HI>company</HI> of prophets; a whole company of them! coming down with a psaltery, a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aboret, a pipe and a harp, and that they prophesied, and that he prophesied with them. But it appears after∣wards that Saul prophesied badly; that is, he performed his part badly; for it is said, that "an evil spirit from God<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As those men, who call themselves divines and commen∣tators, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e very fond of puzzling one another, I leave them to con∣test the meaning of the first part of the phrase, that of <HI>an evil spirit from God.</HI> I keep to my text. I keep to the meaning of the word prophe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y.</NOTE> came upon Saul, and he prophesied."</P>
<P>Now were there no other passage in the book called the Bible than this, to demonstrate to us that we have lost the original meaning of the word prophecy, and substitut∣ed another meaning in its place, this alone would be suf∣ficient; for it is impossible to use and apply the word prophesy in the place it is here used and applied, if we give to it the sense which latter times have affixed to it. The manner in which it is here used strips it of all reli∣gious meaning, and shews that a man might then be a prophet, or might prophesy, as he may now be a poet or a musician, without any regard to the morality or the im∣morality of his character. The word was originally a term of science, promiscuously applied to poetry and to music, and not restricted to any subject upon which poe∣try and music might be exercised.</P>
<P>Deborah and Barak are called prophets, not because they predicted any thing, but because they composed the poem or song that bears their name in celebration of an act already done. David is ranked among the prophets, for he was a musician; and was also reputed to be (though perhaps very erroneously) the author of the Psalms. But Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, are not called prophets. It does not appear from any accounts we have that they could either sing, play music, or make po∣etry.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="027458_0018_0FD3D972891E59C0"/>
We are told of the greater and lesser prophets. They might as well tell us of the greater and lesser God; for there cannot be degrees in prophesying consistently with its modern sense. But there are degrees in poetry, and there∣fore the phrase is reconcileable to the case, when we un∣derstand by it the greater and the lesser poets.</P>
<P>It is altogether unnecessary, after this, to offer any observations upon what those men, stiled prophets, have written. The axe goes at once to the root, by shewing that the original meaning of the word has been mistaken, and consequently all the inferences that have been drawn from those books, the devotional respect that has been paid to them, and the laboured commentaries that have been written upon them under that mistaken meaning, are not worth disputing about. In many things, however, the writings of the Jewish poets deserve a better fate than that of being bound up, as they now are, with the trash that accompanies them, under the abused name of the word of God.</P>
<P>If we permit ourselves to conceive right ideas of things, we must necessarily affix the right idea, not only of unchangeableness, but of the utter impossibility of any change taking place, by any means or accident whatever, in that which we would honour with the name of the word of God; and therefore the word of God cannot exist in any written or human language.</P>
<P>The continually progressive change to which the meaning of words is subject, the want of an universal language which renders translations necessary, the errors to which translations are again subject, the mistakes of copyists and printers, together with the possibility of wil∣ful alteration, are of themselves evidences, that human language, whether in speech or in print, cannot be the vehi∣cle of the word of God. The word of God exists in some∣thing else.</P>
<P>Did the book called the Bible, excel, in purity of ideas and expression, all the books that are now extant in the world, I would not take it for my rule of faith, as be∣ing the word of God; because the possibility would
<PB N="20" REF="027458_0019_0FD3D973C83D2D38"/>
nevertheless exist of my being imposed upon. But when I see throughout the greatest part of this book, scarcely any thing but a history of the grossest vices, and a collec∣tion of the most paltry and contemptible tales, I cannot dishonour my Creator by calling it by his name.</P>
<P>THUS much for the Bible. I now go on to the book called the New Testament. The <HI>new</HI> Testament! that is, the <HI>new</HI> Will, as if there could be two wills of the Creator.</P>
<P>Had it been the object or the intention of Jesus Christ to establish a new religion, he would undoubtedly have written the system himself, or <HI>procured it to be written</HI> in his life time. But there is no publication ex∣tant, authenticated with his name.</P>
<P>All the books called the New Testament were writ∣ten after his death. He was a Jew by birth and by pro∣fession; and he was the Son of God in like manner that every other person is; for the Creator is the Father of all.</P>
<P>The first four books, called Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, do not give a history of the life of Jesus Christ, but only detached anecdotes of him. It appears from these books, that the whole time of his being a preacher was not more than eighteen months; and it was only during this short time, that those men became acquainted with him. They make mention of him, at the age of twelve years, sitting, they say, among the Jewish doctors, asking and answering them questions. As this was seve∣ral years before their acquaintance with him began, it is most probable they had this anecdote from his parents. From this time there is no account of him for about six∣teen years. Where he lived or how he employed him∣self during this interval, is not known. Most probably he was working at his father's trade, which was that of a carpenter. It does not appear that he had any school
<PB N="21" REF="027458_0020_0FD3D9754B5513C8"/>
education, and the probability is that he could not write, for his parents were extremely poor, as appears from their not being able to pay for a bed when he was born.</P>
<P>It is somewhat curious that the three persons, whose names are the most universally recorded, were of very obscure parentage. Moses was a foundling. Jesus Christ was born in a stable, and Mahomet was a mule driver. The first and the last of these men, were found∣ers of different systems of religion; but Jesus Christ founded no new system. He called men to the practice of moral virtues, and the belief of one God. The great trait in his character is philanthropy.</P>
<P>The manner in which he was apprehended, shews that he was not much known at that time; and it shews also that the meetings he then held with his followers were in secret: and that he had given over or suspended, preaching publicly. Judas could no otherwise betray. him than by giving information where he was, and point∣ing him out to the officers that went to arrest him; and the reason for employing and paying Judas to do this, could arise only from the causes already mentioned, that of his not being much known, and living concealed.</P>
<P>The idea of his concealment not only agrees very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with his reputed divinity, but associates with it some∣thing of pusillanimity: and his being betrayed, or in other words, his being apprehended, on the information of one of his followers, shews that he did not intend to be apprehended, and consequently that he did not intend to be crucified.</P>
<P>The Christian mythologists tell us that Christ died for the sins of the world, and that he came on <HI>purpose to die.</HI> Would it not then have been the same if he had died of a fever or of the small pox, of old age, or of any thing else?</P>
<P>The declaratory sentence which, they say, was passed upon Adam in case he ate of the apple, was not, that <HI>thou s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alt be crucified,</HI> but <HI>thou s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alt surely die.</HI> The sentence was death, and not the <HI>manner of dying.</HI> Cru∣cifixion, therefore, or any other particular manner of dying,
<PB N="22" REF="027458_0021_0FD3D9770FD807C0"/>
made no part of the sentence that Adam was to suffer, and consequently, even upon their tactic, it could make no part of the sentence that Christ was to suffer in the room of Adam. A fever would have done as well as a cross, if there was any occasion for either.</P>
<P>This sentence of death, which they tell us, was thus passed upon Adam; must either have meant dying natu∣rally; that is, ceasing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o live; or have meant what these mythologists call damnation; and consequently, the act of dying on the part of Jesus Christ must according to their system, apply as a prevention to one or other of those two <HI>things</HI> happening to Adam and to us.</P>
<P>That it does not prevent our dying is evident, be∣cause we a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> die; and if their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of longevity be true, men die faster since the crucifixion than before; and with respect to the second explanation, (included with it the <HI>natural death</HI> of Jesus Christ as a substitute for the <HI>eternal death</HI> or <HI>damnation</HI> of all mankind) it is impertinently representing the Creator as coming off, or revoking the sentence, by a pun or a quibble upon the word <HI>death.</HI> That manufacturer of quibbles, St. Paul, if he wrote the books that bear his name, has helped this quibble on, by making another quibble upon the word <HI>Adam.</HI> According to him, there are two Adams; the one who sins in fact and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffers by proxy, the other who fins by proxy, and suffers in fact. A religion thus inter∣larded with quibble, subterfuge and pun▪ has a tendency to instruct its professors in the practice of these arts. They acquire the habit without being aware of the cause.</P>
<P>If Jesus Christ was the Being which those mythol∣ogists tell us he was, and that he came into this world to <HI>suffer,</HI> which is a word they sometimes use instead of <HI>to die,</HI> the only real suffering he could have endured would have been <HI>to live.</HI> His existence here was a state of ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ement or transportation from heaven, and the way back to his original country was to die.—In fine, every thing in this strange system is the reverse of what it pretends to be. It is the reverse of truth, and I become so tired with examining into its inconsistencies and absurdities,
<PB N="23" REF="027458_0022_0FD3D97DD32A5388"/>
that I hasten to the conclusion of it, in order to proceed to something better.</P>
<P>How much, or what parts of the books called the New Testament, were written by the persons whose names they bear, is what we can know nothing of, neith∣er are we certain in what language they were originally written. The matters they now contain may be classed under two heads; anecdote and epistolary correspon∣dence.</P>
<P>The four books already mentioned, Matthew, Mark. Luke, and John, are altogether anecdotal. They relate events after they have taken place. They tell what Jesus Christ did and said, and what others did and said to him; and in several instances they relate the same event differently. Revelation is necessairly out of the question with respect to those books: not only because of the disagreement of the writers, but because revelation cannot be applied to the relating of facts by the persons who saw them done, nor to the relating or recording of any discourse or con∣versation by those who heard it. The book called the Acts of the Apostles, an anonymous work, belongs also to the anecdotal part.</P>
<P>All the other parts of the New Testament, except the book of enigmas, called the Revelations, are a collec∣tion of letters under the name of Epistles; and the forge∣ry of letters has been such a common practice in the world that the probability is, at least, equal whether they are genuine or forged. One thing, however, is much less equivocal, which is, that out of the matters contained in those books, together with the assistance of some old sto∣ries, the church has set up a system of religion very con∣tradictory to the character of the person whose name it bears. It has set up a religion of pomp and of revenue in the pretended imitation of a person whose life was hu∣mility and poverty.</P>
<P>The invention of a purgatory, and of the releasing of souls therefrom, by prayers, bou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ht of the church with money; the selling of pardons, dispensations, and indulgenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, are revenue laws, without <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aring that name or
<PB N="24" REF="027458_0023_0FD3D97F0ACFA788"/>
carrying that appearance. But the case nevertheless is, that those things derive their origin from the proxysm of the crucifixion, and the theory deduced therefrom, which was, that one person could stand in the place of a∣nother, and could perform meritorious services for him. The probability therefore is, that the whole theory or doctrine of what is called the redemption (which is said to have been accomplished by the act of one person in the room of another) was originally fabricated on purpose to bring forward and build all those secondary and pecu∣niary redemptions upon; and that the passages in the books upon which the idea or theory of redemption is built, have been manufactured and fabricated for that purpose. Why are we to give this church credit, when she tells us that those books are genuine in every part, any more than we give her credit for every thing else she has told us, or for the miracles she says she has performed. That she <HI>could</HI> fabricate writings is certain, because she could write; and the composition of the writings in ques∣tion, is of that kind that any body might do it; and that she <HI>did</HI> fabricate them is not more inconsistent with pro∣bability, than that she should tell us, as she has done, that she could and did work miracles.</P>
<P>Since then no external evidence can, at this long distance of time, be produced to prove, whether the church fabricated the doctrine called redemption or not, (for such evidence, whether for or against, would be subject to the same suspicion of being fabricated) the case can only be referred to the internal evidence which the thing carries of itself; and this affords a very strong presumption of its being a fabrication. For the internal evidence is, that the theory or doctrine of redemption has for its basis, an idea of pecuniary justice, and not that of moral justice.</P>
<P>If I owe a person money and cannot pay him, and he threatens to put me in prison another person can take the debt upon himself, and pay it for me. But if I have committed a crime, every circumstance of the case <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> changed. Moral justice cannot take the innocent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the guilty, even if the innocent would offer itself. To <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
<PB N="25" REF="027458_0024_0FD3D980DDC300D8"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pose justice to do this, is to destroy the principle of its existence, which is the thing itself. It is then no longer justice. It is indiscriminate revenge.</P>
<P>This single reflection will shew that the doctrine of redemption is founded on a mere pecuniary idea, cor∣responding to that of a debt which another person might pay; and as this pecuniary idea corresponds again with the system of second redemptions, obtained through the means of money given to the church, for pardons, the probability is, that the same persons fabricated both the one and the other of those theories; and that, in truth there is no such thing as redemption; that it is fabulous; and that man stands in the same relative condition with his Maker he ever did stand since man existed; and that it is his greatest consolation to think so.</P>
<P>Let him believe this, and he will live more consistently and morally than by any other system. It is by his being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ught to contemplate himself as an out-law, as an out-cast, as a beggar, as a mumper, as one thrown, as it were, on a dunghill, at an immense distance from his Creator, and who must make his approaches by creeping and cringing to intermediate beings, that he conceives either a contemptu∣ous disregard for every thing under the name religion, or becomes indifferent, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>urns what he calls devout. In the latter case, he consumes his life in grief, or the af∣fectation of it. His prayers are reproaches. His humility is ingratitude. He calls himself a worm, and the fertile earth a dunghill; and all the blessings of life by the thankless name of vanities. He despises the choicest gift of God to man, the GIFT OF REASON; and hav∣ing endeavoured to force upon himself the belief of a sys∣tem against which reason revolts, he ungratefully calls it <HI>human reason,</HI> as if man could give reason to himself.</P>
<P>Yet with all this strange appearance of humility, and this contempt for human reason, he ventures into the bold∣est presumptions. He finds fault with every thing. His selfishness is never satisfied; his ingratitude is never at an end. He takes on himself to direct the Almighty what to do, even in the government of the universe. He pray <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>atorially. When it is sun-shine he prays <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n
<PB N="26" REF="027458_0025_0FD3D982326C62E0"/>
and when it is rain he prays for sun-shine. He follows the same idea in every thing that he prays for; for what is the amount of all his prayers, but an attempt to make the Almighty change his mind, and act otherwise than he does. It is as if he were to say—thou knowest not so well as I.</P>
<P>BUT some perhaps will say, are we to have no word of God—No revelation; I answer yes. There is a word of God; there is a revelation.</P>
<P>THE WORD OF GOD IS THE CREATION WE BEHOLD: And it is in <HI>this word,</HI> which no human in∣vention can counterfeit or alter, that God speaketh univer∣sally to man.</P>
<P>Human language is local and changeable, and is there∣fore incapable of being used as the means of unchangea∣ble and universal information. The idea that God sent Jesus Christ to publish, as they say, the glad <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idings to all nations, from one end of the earth unto the other, is consist∣ent only with the ignorance of those who knew nothing of the extent of the world, and who believed, as those world-faviours believed, and continued to believe for several centuries, (and that in contradiction to the discoveries of philosophers, and the experience of navigators) that the earth was flat like a trencher; and that a man might walk to the end of it.</P>
<P>But how was Jesus Christ to make any thing known to all nations? He could speak but one language, which was Hebrew; and there are in the world several hundred languages. Scarcely any two nations speak the same language, or understand each other; and as to translations, every m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n who knows any thing of languages, knows that it is impossible to translate from one language into another, not only without losing a great part of the original, but frequently of mistaking the sense: and besides all this, the art of printing was wholly unknown at the time Christ lived.</P>
<P>It is always necessary that the means that are to ac∣complish any end, be equal to the accomplishment of that end, or the end cannot be accomplished. It i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in
<PB N="27" REF="027458_0026_0FD3D983B6C2A570"/>
this that the difference between finite and infinite power and wisdom discovers itself. Man frequently fails in ac∣complishing his end, from a natural inability of power to the purpose, and frequently from the want of wisdom to apply power properly. But it is impossible for in∣finite power and wisdom to fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l as man faileth. The means it useth are always equal to the end: but human language, more especially as there is not an universal language, is incapable of being used as an universal means of unchangeable and uniform informa∣tion; and therefore it is not the means that God useth in manifesting himself universally to man.</P>
<P>It is only in the CREATION that all our ideas and conceptions of a <HI>world of God</HI> can unite. The creation speaketh an universal language, independently of human speech or human language, multiplied and various as they be. It is an ever-existing original, which every man can read. It cannot be forged; it cannot be counterfeited; it cannot be lost; it cannot be altered; it cannot be suppressed. It does not depend upon the will of man whether it shall be published or not; it publishes itself from one end of the earth to the other. It preaches to all nations and to all worlds; and this <HI>word of God</HI> reveals to man all that is necessary for man to know of God.</P>
<P>Do we want to contemplate his power? We see it in the immensity of the creation. Do we want to con∣template his wisdom? We see it in the unchangeable or∣der by which the incomprehensible Whole is governed. Do we want to contemplate his manificence? We see it in the abundance with which he fills the earth. Do we want to contemplate his mercy? We see it in his not withholding that-abundance even from the unthankful. In sine, do we want to know what God is? Search not the book called the scripture, which any human hand might make, but the scripture called the creation.</P>
<P>The only idea that man can affix to the name of God, is that of a <HI>first cause,</HI> the cause of all things. And incomprehensibly difficult as it is for man to conceive what a first cause is, he arrives at the belief of it, from the ten-fold greater difficulty of disbelieving it. It is difficult beyond description to conceive that space can have no
<PB N="28" REF="027458_0027_0FD3D9850C738000"/>
end; but it is more difficult to conceive an end. It is difficult, beyond the power of man to conceive an eternal duration of what we call time; but it is more impossible to conceive a time when there shall be no time. In like manner of reasoning, every thing we behold carries in it∣self the internal evidence that it did not make itself. Every man is an evidence to himself that he did not make himself; neither could his father make himself, nor his grandfather, nor any of his race; neither could any tree, plant or animal, make itself: and it is the conviction aris∣ing from this evidence, that carries us on, as it were, by necessity, to the belief of a first cause, eternally existing, of a nature totally different to any material existence we know of, and by the power of which all things exist, and this first cause man calls God.</P>
<P>It is only by the exercise of reason, that man can dis∣cover God. Take away that reason, and he would be in∣capable of understanding any thing; and, in this case, it would be just as consistent to read even the book called the bible, to a horse as to a man. How then is it that those people pretend to reject reason?</P>
<P>Almost the only parts in the book called the bible, that convey to us any idea of God, are some chapters in Job, and the 19th psalm. I recollect no other. Those parts are true <HI>deistical</HI> compositions; for they treat of the <HI>deity</HI> through his works. They take the book of Creation is the word of God; they refer to no other book, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ll the inferences they make are drawn from that volume.</P>
<P>I insert in this place, the 19th psalm, as paraphrased <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>to English verse, by Addison. I recollect not the prose, and where I write this, I have not the opportunity of see∣ing it.</P>

<L>With all the blue etherial sky,</L>
<L>And spangled heavens, a shining frame,</L>
<L>Their great original proclaim.</L>
<L>The unwearied sun, from day to day,</L>
<L>Does his Creator's power display,</L>
<L>And publishes to every land,</L>
<L>The works of an Almighty hand.</L>
<L>Soon as the evening shades prevail,</L>
<L>The moon takes up the wond'rous tale,</L>
<L><PB N="29" REF="027458_0028_0FD3D9868DDE2BC0"/>
And nightly to the listening earth</L>
<L>Repeats the story of her brith.</L>
<L>Whilst all the stars that round her burn,</L>
<L>And all the planets in their turn,</L>
<L>Confirm the tidings as they roll,</L>
<L>And spread the truth from pole to pole.</L>
<L>What tho' in solemn silence, all</L>
<L>Move round this dark terrestrial ball,</L>
<L>What tho' no real voice, nor sound,</L>
<L>Amidst their radient orbs be found,</L>
<L>In reason's ear they all rejoice,</L>
<L>And utter forth a glorious voice;</L>
<L>Forever singing as they shine,</L>
<L>THE HAND THAT MADE US IS DIVINE.</L>
<P>What more does man want to know than that the hand, or power that made these things, is divine, is omnip∣otent? Let him believe this, with the force it is impossi∣ble to repel, if he permits his reason to act, and his rule of moral life will follow of course.</P>
<P>The allusions in Job have all of them the same ten∣dency with this psalm; that of deducing or proving a truth, that would be otherwise unknown, from truths al∣ready known.</P>
<P>I recollect not enough of the passages in Job to in∣sert them correctly: but there is one that occurs to me that is applicable to the subject I am speaking upon.—"Canst thou by <HI>searching</HI> find out God? Canst thou find out the Almighty to perfection.</P>
<P>I know not how the printers have pointed this passage, for I keep no Bible: but it contains two distinct questions that admit of distinct answers.</P>
<P>First, Canst thou by <HI>searching</HI> find out God? Yes. Because, in the first place, I know I did not make myself, and yet I have existence; and by <HI>searching</HI> into the na∣ture of other things, I find that no other thing could make it∣self; and yet millions of other things exist; therefore, it is that I know by positive conclusion, resulting from this search, that there is a power superior to all those things, and that power is God.</P>
<P>Secondly, Canst thou find out the Almighty to <HI>per∣fection?</HI> No. Not only because the power and wisdom he has manifested in the structure of the creation that I
<PB N="30" REF="027458_0029_0FD3D9880646D3A8"/>
behold, is to me incomprehensible; but because even this manifestation, great as it is, is probably but a small display of that immensity of power and wisdom, by which millions of other worlds, to me invisible by their distance, were created and continue to exist.</P>
<P>It is evident that both these questions were put to the reason of the person to whom they are supposed to have been addressed; and it is only by admitting the first ques∣tion to be answered affirmatively, that the second could follow. It would have been unnecessary and, even ab∣surd, to have put a second question more difficult than the first, if the first question had been answered negatively. The two questions have different objects, the first refers to the existence of God, the second to his attributes. Reason can discover the one, but it falls infinitely short in discovering the whole of the other.</P>
<P>I recollect not a single passage in all the writings ascribed to the men called apostles, that conveys any idea of what God is. Those writings are chiefly controversial; and the gloominess of the subject they dwell upon, that of a man dying in agony on a cross, is better suited to the gloomy genius of a monk in a cell, by whom it is not im∣possible they were written, than to any man breathing the open air of the creation. The only passage that occurs <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me, that has any reference to the works of God, by which only his power and wisdom can be known, is re∣lated to have been spoken by Jesus Christ, as a remedy against distrustful care. "Behold the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lies of the field, they toil not, neither do they spin." This, however, is far inferior to the a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>usions in Job, and in the 19th psalm; but it is similar in idea, and the modesty of the imagery is correspondent to the modesty of the man.</P>
<P>As to the christian system of faith, it appears to me as a species of atheism; a fort of religions denial of God. It professes to believe in a man rather than in God. It is a compound, made up chiefly of manism with but little de∣ism, and is as near to atheism as twilight is to darkness. It introduces between man and his Maker an opaque body which it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s a redeemer; as the moon introduces her opaque self between the earth and the sun, and it produces by this means a religious or irreligious e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pse <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>. It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> put the whole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of reason into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="027458_0030_0FD3D989A55C1640"/>
The effect of this obscurity has been that of turning every thing upside down, and representing it in reverse; and among the revolutions it has thus magically produced, it has made a revolution in theology.</P>
<P>That which is now called natural philosophy, em∣bracing the whole circle of science, of which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>onomy occupies the chief place, is the study of the works of God and of the power and wisdom of God in his works, and is the true theology.</P>
<P>As the theology that is now studied in its place, it is the study of human opinions and of human fancies <HI>con∣cerning</HI> God. It is not the study of God himself in the works that he has made, but in the works or writings that man has made; and it is not among the least of the mischiefs that the christian system has done to the world, that it has abandoned the original and beautiful system of theology, like a beautiful innocent, to distress and reproach, to make room for the hag of superstition.</P>
<P>The book of Job, and the 19th psalm, which even the church admits to be more ancient than the chronolo∣gical order in which they stand in the book called the Bi∣ble, are theological orations conformable to the original system of theology. The internal evidence of those prations proves to a demonstration, that the study and contemplation of the words of creation, and of the power and wisdom of God, revealed and manifested in those works, made a great part of the religious devotion of the times in which they were written; and it was this devotional study and contemplation that led to the discov∣ery of the principles upon which what are now cal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed Sciences are established; and it is to the discovery of these principles that a most a I the Arts that contribute to the convenience of human life owe their existence. Every principal art has some science for its parent, though the person who mechanically performs the work does not al∣ways, and but very seldom, perceive the connection.</P>
<P>IT is a fraud of the christian system to call the sci∣ences <HI>human inventions;</HI> it is only the application of
<PB N="32" REF="027458_0031_0FD3D98B0DB7A090"/>
them that is human. Every science has for its basis a system of principles as fixed and unalterable as those by which the universe is regulated and governed. Man can∣not make principles; he can only discover them:</P>
<P>For example. Every person who looks at an al∣manack sees an account when an eclipse will take place, and he sees also that it never fails to take place according to the account there given. This shews that man is ac∣quainted with the laws by which the heavenly bodies move. But it would be something worse than ignorance, were any church on earth to say, that those laws are an human invention.</P>
<P>It would also be ignorance, or something worse, to say, that the scientific principles, by the aid of which man is enabled to calculate and fore-know when an eclipse will take place, are an human invention. Man cannot invent any thing that is eternal and immutable; and the scientific principles he employs for this purpose, must, and are, of necessity, as eternal and immutable as the laws by which the heavenly bodies move, or they could not be used as they are, to ascertain the time when, and the manner how an eclipse will take place.</P>
<P>The scientific principles that man employs to obtain the fore-knowledge of an eclipse, or of any thing else relating to the motion of the heavenly bodies, are con∣tained chiefly in that part of science called trigonometry, or the properties of a triangle, which, when applied to the study of the heavenly bodies, is called astronomy; when ap∣plied to direct the course of a ship on the ocean, it is called navigation; when applied to the construction of figures drawn by a rule and compass, it is called geometry, when ap∣plied to the construction of plans of edifices, it is called archi∣tecture; when applied to the measurement of any portion of the surface of the earth, it is called land surveying. In fine, it is the soul of science. It is an eternal truth: it contains the <HI>mathematical demonstration</HI> of which man speaks, and the extent of its uses are unknown.</P>
<P>It may be said, that man can make or draw a triangle, and therefore a triangle is an human invention.</P>
<P>But the triangle, when drawn, is no other than the image of the principle; it is a delineation to the eye,
<PB N="33" REF="027458_0032_0FD3D98C8C3EE340"/>
and from thence to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of a principle that would otherwise be imperceptible. The triangle does not make the principle, any more th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n a candle taken into a room that was dark, makes the chairs and tables that before were invisible. All the properties of a triangle exist independ∣ently of the figure, and existed before any triangle was drawn or thought of by man. Man had no more to do in the formation of those properties, or principles, than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e had to do in making the laws by which the heavenly bodies move; and therefore the one must have the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vine origin as the other.</P>
<P>In the same manner as i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may be said that man can make a triangle, so also it may be said, he can make the mechanical instrument called the lever. But the princi∣ple by which the lever acts as a thing distinct from the in∣strument, and would exist if the instrument did not: it attaches itself to the instrument after it is made; the in∣strument therefore can act no otherwise than it does act; neither can all the effort of human invention make it act otherwise. That which in all such cases, man calls the <HI>effect,</HI> is no other than the principle itself, rendered per∣ceptible to the senses.</P>
<P>Since then man cannot make principles, from whence did he gain a knowledge of them, so as to be able to ap∣ply them not only to things on earth, but to ascertain the motion of bodies so immensely distant from him as all the heavenly bodies are? From whence, I ask, <HI>could</HI> he gain that knowledge, but from the study of the true theo∣logy?</P>
<P>It is the structure of the universe that has taught this knowledge to man. That structure is an ever existing ex∣hibition of every principle upon which every part of methematical science is founded. The offspring of this science is mechanics; for mechanics is no other than the principles of science applied practically. The man who proportions the several parts of a mill, uses the same scien∣tific principles as if he had the power of constructing an universe: but as he cannot give to matter that invisible agency, by which all the component parts of the im∣mense machine of the universe have influence upon each other, and act in motional unison together, without any
<PB N="34" REF="027458_0033_0FD3DAF2097B0080"/>
apparent contact, and to which man has given the name of attraction, gravitation, and repulsion, he supplies the place of that agency by the humble imitation of teeth ano∣cogs. All the parts of man's microcosm must visibly touch. But could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e gain a knowledge of that agency, so as to be able to apply it in practice, we might then say, that another <HI>canonical book</HI> of the word of God had been discovered.</P>
<P>If man could after the properties of the lever, so also could he alter the properties of the triangle: for a lever (taking that sort of lever which is called a steel-yard, for the sake of explanation) forms, when in motion, a trian∣gle. The line it descends from (one point of that line being in the fulcrum) the line it descends to, and the chord of the ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, which the end of the lever describes in the air, are the three sides of a triangle. The other arm of the lever describes also a triangle; and the corres∣ponding sides of those two triangles, calculated scientifi∣cally, or measured geometrically; and also the fines, tangents, and secants generated from the angles, and geo∣metrically measured have the same proportions to each other, as the different weights have that will balance each other on the lever, leaving the weight of the lever out of the case.</P>
<P>It may also be said that man can make a wheel and axis, that he can put wheels of different magnitudes to∣gether, and produce a mill. Still the case comes back to the same point, which is, that he did not make the prin∣ciple that gives the wheels those powers. That principle is as unalterable as in the former cases, or rather it is the same principle under a different appearance to the eye.</P>
<P>The power that two wheels, of different magnitudes, have upon each other, is in the same proportion as if the semidiameter of the two wheels were joined together, and made into that kind of lever I have described, suspended at the part where the semidiameters join; for the two wheels scientifically considered, are no other than the two circles generated by the motion of the compound lever.</P>
<P>It is from the study of the true theology, that all
<PB N="35" REF="027458_0034_0FD3DAF3194540E8"/>
our knowledge of science is derived, and it is from that knowledge that all the arts have originated.</P>
<P>The Almighty Lecturer, by displaying the princi∣ples of science in the structure of the universe, has invited man to study and to imitation. It is as if he had said to the inhabitants of this globe that we call ours, "I have made an earth for man to dwell upon, and I have rendered the starry heavens visible, to teach him science and the arts. He can now provide for his own comfort, AND LEARN FROM MY MUNIFICENCE TO ALL, TO BE KIND TO EACH OTHER."</P>
<P>Of what use is it unless it be to teach man some∣thing that his eye is endued with the power of beholding, to an incomprehensible distance, an immensity of worlds revolving in the ocean of space? Or of what use is it that this immensity of worlds is visible to man? What has man to do with the Pleiades, with Orion, with Siri∣us, with the star he calls the north star, with the moving orbs he has named Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus and Mercury, if no uses are to follow from their being visi∣ble? A less power of vision would have been sufficient for man, if the immensity he now possesses, were given only to waste itself, as it were, on an immense de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>art of space glittering with shows.</P>
<P>It is only by contemplating what he calls the starry heavens, as the book and school of science, that he dis∣covers any use in their being visible to him, or any ad∣vantage refulting from his immensity of vision. But when he contemplates the subject in this light, he sees an additional motive for saying that <HI>nothing was made in vain;</HI> for in vain would be this power of vision if it taught man nothing.</P>
<P>As the christian system of faith has made a revolu∣tion in theology, so also has it made a revolution in the state of learning. That which is now called learning, was not learning originally. Learning does not consist, as the schools now make it to consist, in the knowledge of languages, but in the knowledge of things to which lan∣guage gives names.</P>
<P>The Greeks were a learned people; but learning with them did not consist in speaking Greek any more
<PB N="36" REF="027458_0035_0FD3DAF592B6C198"/>
than in a Roman's speaking Latin, or a Frenchman's speaking French, or an Englishman's speaking English. From what we know of the Greeks, it does not appear that they knew or studied any language but their own; and this was one cause of their being so learned; it af∣forded them more time to apply themselves to better studies. The schools of the Greeks were schools of sci∣ence and philosophy, and not of languages; and it is in the knowledge of the things that science and philosophy teach, that learning consists.</P>
<P>Putting aside, as matter of distinct consideration, the outrage offered to the moral justice of God, by supposing him to make the innocent suffer for the guilty, and also the loose morality and low contrivance of supposing him to change himself into the shape of a man, in order to make an excuse to himself for not executing his supposed sentence upon Adam: putting, I say, those things a∣side, as matter of distinct consideration, it is certain, that what is called the christian system of faith, including in it the whimsical account of the creation; the strange story of Eve, the snake and the apple; the amphibious idea of a man-god; the corporeal idea of the death of a god; the mythological idea of a family of gods; and the christian system of arithmetic, that three are one, and one is three, are all irreconcileable, not only to the divine gift of reason that God has given to man, but to the knowledge that man gains of the power and wisdom of God, by the aid of the sciences, and by studying the structure of the universe that God has made.</P>
<P>The setters up, therefore, and the advocates of the christian system of faith, could not but foresee that the continually progressive knowledge that man would gain by the aid of science, of the power and wisdom of God, manifested in the structure of the universe, and in all the works of creation, would militate against, and call into question, the truth of their system of faith; and there∣fore it bacame necessary to their purpose to cut learning down to a size less dangerous to their project, and this they effected by restricting the idea of learning to the dead study of dead languages.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="027458_0036_0FD3DAF798308CF8"/>
They not only rejected the study of science out of the christian schools, but they persecuted it; and it is only within about the last two centuries that the study has been revived. So late as 1610, Galileo, a Florentine, discov∣ered and introduced the use of telescopes, and by applying them to observe the motions and appearances of the heav∣enly bodies, afforded additional means for ascertaining the true structure of the universe. Instead of being esteemed for these discoveries, he was sentenced to renounce them or the opinions resulting from them, as a damnable heresy. And prior to that time Vigi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ius was condemned to be burned for asserting the antipodes; or, in other words, that the earth was a globe, and habitable in every part where there was land, yet the truth of this is now too well know even to be told.</P>
<P>If the belief of errors not morally bad did no mischief it would make no part of the moral duty of man to oppose and remove them. There was no moral ill in believing the earth flat like a trencher, any more than there was moral virtue in believing it was round like a globe; neither was there any moral ill in be∣lieving that the Creator made no other world than this, any more than there was moral virtue in believing that he made millions, and that the infinity of space is filled with worlds. But when a system of religion is made to grow out of a supposed system of creation that is not true, and to unite itself there with in a manner almost in∣separable therefrom, the case assumes an entirely different ground. It is then that errors not morally bad, become fraught with the same mischiefs as if they were. It is then that the truth, though otherwise indifferent in itself, becomes an essential, by becoming the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riterion, that either confirms by corresponding evidence, or denies by contradictory evidence, the reality of the religion itself. In this view of the case, it is the moral duty of man to obtain every possible evidence that the structure of the heavens, or any other part of creation affords, with re∣spect to systems of religion. But this, the supporters or partizans of the christian system, as if dreading the re∣sult,
<PB N="38" REF="027458_0037_0FD3DAF915588210"/>
incessantly opposed, and not only rejected the sci∣ences, but persecuted the professors. Had Newton or Descartes lived three or four hundred years ago, and pur∣sued their studies as they did, it is most probable they would not have lived to finish them; and, had Franklin drawn lightning from the clouds, at the same time, it would have been at the hazard of expiring for it in flames.</P>
<P>Later times have laid all the blame upon the Goths and Vandals: but however unwilling the partizans of the christian system may be to believe or to acknowledge it, it is nevertheless true that the age of ignorance com∣menced with the christian system. There was more knowledge in the world before that period, than for ma∣ny centuries afterwards; and as to religions knowledge, the christian system, as already said, was only another species of mythology; and the mythology to which it succeeded was a corruption of an ancient system of the∣ism.</P>
<P>It is owing to this long interregnum of science, and to no other cause, that we have now to look back through a vast chasm of many hundred years to the respectable characters we call the ancients. Had the progression of knowledge gone on proportionably with the stock that before existed that chasm would have been filled up with characters rising <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in knowledge to each other; and those ancients, we now so much admire, would have appeared respectably in the back ground of the scene. But the christian system laid all waste; and if we take our stand about the beginning of the sixteenth century, we look back through that long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, to the times of the ancients, as over a vast sandy desert, is which not a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> appears to intercept the vision to the fertile hills beyond.</P>
<P>It is an inconsistency, scarcely possible to be credit∣ed, that any thing should exist under the name of a <HI>reli∣gion,</HI> that held it to be <HI>irreligious</HI> to study and contem∣plate the structure, of the universe that God had made. But the fact is too well established to be denied. The event that served more than any other to break the find link in this long chain of despotic ignorance, is that known by the name of the reformation by Luther. From
<PB N="39" REF="027458_0038_0FD3DAFB918951A0"/>
that time, though it does not appear to have made any part of the intention of Luther, or of those who are cal∣led reformers, the Sciences began to revive, and Liberal∣ity, their natural associate, began to appear. This was the only public good the reformation did; for with res∣pect to religious good, it might as well not have taken place. The mythology still continued the same; and a multiplicity of national popes grew out of the downfal of the Pope of Christendom.</P>
<P>HAVING thus shewn, from the internal evidence of things, the cause that produced a change in the state of learning, and the motive for substituting the study of the deed languages in the place of the Sciences, I proceed, in addition to the several observations already made in the for∣mer part of this work, to compare, or rather to confront, the evidence that the structure of the universe affords, with the christian system of religion. But as I cannot begin this part better than by referring to the ideas that occurred to me at an early part of life, and which I doubt not have occurred in some degree to almost every other person at one time or other, I shall state what those ideas were, and add there to such other matters as shall arise out of the subject, giving to the whole, by way of preface, a short introduction.</P>
<P>My father, being of the quaker profession, it was my good fortune to have an exceedingly good moral edu∣cation, and a tolearble stock of useful learning. Though I went to the grammer school,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Grammar School at Thetford, in Norfolk.</NOTE> I did not learn Latin, not only because I had no inclination to learn languages, but because of the objection the quakers have against the books in which the language is taught. But this did not prevent me from being acquainted with the subjects of all the Latin books used in the school.</P>
<P>The natural bent of my mind was to science. I had some turn, and I believe some talent, for poetry; but this
<PB N="40" REF="027458_0039_0FD3DAFB96AB3900"/>
I rather repressed than encouraged, as leading too much into the field of imagination. As soon as I was able I purchased a pair of globes, and attended the philosophi∣cal lectures of Martin and Ferguson, and became after∣wards acquainted with Dr. Bevis, of the society called the Royal Society, then living in the Temple, and as excellent astronomer.</P>
<P>I had no disposition for what was called politics. It presented to my mind no other idea than is contained in the word Jockeyship. When, therefore, I turned my thoughts toward, matters of government, I had to form a system for myself that accorded with the moral and philosophic principles in which I had been educated. I few, or at least I thought I saw, a vast scene opening it∣self to the world in the affairs of America; and it appear∣ed to me, that unless the Americans changed the plan they were then pursuing, with respect to the government of England, and declared themselves independent, they would not only involve themselves in a multiplicity of new dif∣ficulties, but shut out the prospect that was then offering itself to mankind, through their means. It was from these motives that I published the work known by the name of COMMON SENSE, which is the first work I ever did publish: and so far as I can judge of myself, I believe I never should have been known in the world as an author on any subject whatever, had it not been for the affairs of America. I wrote COMMON SENSE the latter end of the year 1775, and published it the first of January, 1776. Independence was declared the fourth of July following. Any person who was made observations on the state and progress of the human mind, by observing his own, can∣not but have observed that there are two distinct clasles of what we call Thoughts: those that we produce in our∣selves by reflection and the act of thinking, and those that bolt into the mind of their own accord. I have always made it a rule to treat those voluntary visitors with civili∣ty, taking care to examine, as well as I was able, if they were worth entertaining; and it is from them I have ac∣quired almost all the knowledge that I have. As to the learning that any person gains from school education, it
<PB N="41" REF="027458_0040_0FD3DAFCD37F5540"/>
serves only, like a small capital, to put him in the way of beginning learning for himself afterwards. Every person of learning is finally his own teacher; the reason of which is that principles being of a distinct quality to circumstan∣ces, cannot be impressed upon the memory. Their place of mental residence is the understanding, and they are never so lasting as when they begin by conception. Thus much for the introductory part.</P>
<P>From the time I was capable of conceiving an idea, and acting upon it by reflection, I either doubted the truth of the christian system, or thought it to be a strange affair; I scarcely know which it was; but I we I remem∣ber, when about seven or eight years of age, hearing a sermon read by a relation of mine, who was a great de∣vote<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the church, upon the subject of what is called <HI>Rede<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ption by the Death of the Son of God.</HI> After the sermon was ended, I went into the garden and as I was going down the garden step (for I perfectly recollect the spot) I revolted at the recollection of what I had heard, and thought to myself that it was making God Almighty act like a passionate man that killed his son when he could not revenge himself any other way; and as I was sure a man would be hanged that did such a thing, I could not see for what purpose they preach such ser∣mous. This was not one of those kind of thoughts that had any thing in it of childish levity; it was to me a serious reflection, arising from the idea I had, that God was too good to do such an action, and also too Almighty to be under any necessity of doing it. I believe in the same manner to this moment; and I moreover believe, that any system of religion that has any thing in it that shocks the mind of a child cannot be a true system.</P>
<P>It seems as if parents of the christian profession, were ashamed to tell their children any thing about the principles of their religion. They sometimes instruct them in morals, and talk to them of the goodness of what they call Providence: for the christian mythology has five der∣ties: there is God the Father, God the Son, God the Holy Ghost, the God Providence, and the Goddess Na∣ture.
<PB N="42" REF="027458_0041_0FD3DAFF74063108"/>
But the christian story of God the Father putting his son to death, or employing people to do it (for that is the plain language of the story) cannot be told by a parent to a child; and to tell him that it was done to make man∣kind happier and better, is making the story still worse, as if mankind could be improved by the example of murder; and to tell him that all this is a mystery, is only making an excuse for the incredibility of it.</P>
<P>How different is this to the pure and simple profes∣sion of Deism? The true Deist has but one Deity; and his religion consists in contemplating the power, wisdom, and benignity of the Deity in his works, and in endea∣vouring to imitate him in every thing moral, scientifical, and mechanical.</P>
<P>The religion that approaches the nearest of all others to true deism, in the moral and▪ benign part thereof, is that professed by the quakers, but they have contracted themselves too much by leaving the works of God out of their system. Though I reverence their philanthropy, I cannot help smiling at the conceit, that if the taste of a quaker could have been consulted at the creation, what a silent and drab-coloured creation it would have been! Not a flower would have blossomed its gaieties, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a bird been permitted to sing.</P>
<P>QUITTING these reflections, I proceed to other matters. After I had made myself master of the use of the globes and of the orrery, and conceived an idea of the infinity of space, and of the eternal divisibility of matter, and obtained, at least, a general knowledge of what is cal∣led natural philosophy, I began to compare, or, as I have before said, to confront the internal evidence those things afford with the christian system of faith.</P>
<P>Though it is not a direct article of the christian sys∣tem that this world that we inhabit is the whole of the hab∣itable creation, yet it is so worked up therewith, from what is called the Mosaic account of the creation, the sto∣ry of Eve and the apple, and the counterpart of that story,
<PB N="43" REF="027458_0042_0FD3DB00B5CDF0E8"/>
the death of the Son of God, that to believe otherwise; that is, to believe that God created a plurality of worlds at least as numerous as what we call stars, renders the christian system of faith at once little and ridiculous, and soatters it in the mind like feathers in the air. The two beliefs cannot be held together in the same mind; and he who thinks that he believes both, has thought but little of either.</P>
<P>Though the belief of a plurality of worlds was fa∣miliar to the ancients, it is only wihtin the last three cen∣turies that the extent and dimensions of this globe that we inhabit have been ascertained. Several vessels, follow∣ing the tract of the ocean, have failed entirely round the world, as a man may march in a circle, and come round by the contrary side of the circle to the spot he set out from; The circular dimensions of our world in the wid∣est part, as a man would measure the widest round of an apple or a ball, is only twenty-five thousand and twenty English miles, reckoning sixty-nine miles and an half to an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>torial degree, and may be failed round in the space of about three years.</P>
<P>A world of this extent may, at first thought, appear to us to be great; but if we compare it with the immen∣sity of space in which it is suspended, like a bubble or a balloon in the air, it is infinitely less in proportion than the smallest grain of sand is to the size of the world, or the finest particle of de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the whole ocean, and is there∣fore but small; and as will be hereafter shewn, is only <HI>one</HI> of a system of worlds, of which the universal creation is composed.</P>
<P>It is not difficult to gain some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aint idea of the immen∣sity of space in which this and all the other worlds are sus∣pended, if we follow a progression of ideas. When we think of the size or dimensions of a room, our ideas limit themselves to the walls, and there they stop. But when our eye, or our imagination, darts into space; that is, when it looks upward into what we call the open air; we cannot conceive any walls or boundaries it can have; and if for the sake of resting our ideas, we suppose a bounda∣ry, the question immediately renews itself, and asks, what
<PB N="44" REF="027458_0043_0FD3DB03A54AD448"/>
is beyond that boundary? and in the same manner, what is beyond the next boundary? and so on, till the fatiguing imagination returns and says, <HI>there is no end.</HI> Cortain∣ly, then the Creator was not pent for room when he made this world no larger than it is; and we have to seek the reason in something else.</P>
<P>If we take a survey of our own world, or rather of this of which the Creator has given us the use, as our portion in the immense system of creation, we find every part of it, the earth, the waters, and the air that surround it, field, and, as it were, crowded with life, down from the largest animals that we know of, to the smallest infects the naked eye can behold, and from thence to others still smaller, and totally invisible without the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the microscope. Every tree, every plant, every leaf, serves not only as an habitation, but as a world to some nume∣rous race, till animal existence become so exceedingly refined, that the effluvia of a blade of grass would be food for thousands.</P>
<P>Since then no part of our earth is left unoccupied, why is to be supposed, that the immensity of space is a naked void, lying in eternal waste? There is room for mil∣lions of worlds as large or larger than ours, and each of them millions of miles apart from each other.</P>
<P>Having now arrived at this point, if we carry our ideas only one thought further, we shall see, perhaps, the true reason at least a very good reason for our happiness, why the Creator, instead of making one immense world, extending over an immense quantity of space, has preferred dividing that quantity of matter into several distinct and sparate worlds, which we call planets, of which our earth is one. But before I explain my ideas upon this subject, it is necessary (not for the sake of those that already know, but for those who do not) to shew what the system of the universe is.</P>
<P>That part of the universe, that is called the solar system (meaning the system of worlds to which our earth belongs, and of which Sol, or in English language, the Sun, is the center) consists, besides the Sun, of fix distinct orbs, or planets, or worlds, besides the
<PB N="45" REF="027458_0044_0FD3DB062F273A60"/>
secondary bodies, called satellites, or moons, of which our earth has one that attends her in her annual revolution round the Sun, in like manner as the other satellites, or moons attend the planets, or worlds, to which they seve∣rally belong, as may be seen by the assistance of the tele∣scope.</P>
<P>The Sun is the center, round which those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ix worlds or planets, revolve at different distances therefrom, and in circles concentric to each other. Each world keeps constantly in nearly the same tract round the Sun, and continues at the same time, turning round itself, in nearly an upright position, as a top turns round itself when it is spinning on the ground, and leans a little side ways.</P>
<P>It is this leaning of the earth (23½ degrees) that occasions summer and winter, and the different length of days and nights. If the earth turned round itself in a position perpendicular to the plane or level of the circle it moves in round the Sun, as a top turns round, when it stands erect on the ground, the days and nights would be always of the same length, twelve hours day, and twelve hours night, and the season would be uniformly the same throughout the year.</P>
<P>Every time that a planet (our earth for example) turns round itself, it makes what we call day and night; and every time it goes entirely round the sun, it makes what we call a year, consequently our world turns three hundred and sixty-five times round itself, in going once round the sun.</P>
<P>The names that the ancients gave to those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ix worlds, and which are still called by the same names, are Mercu∣ry, Venus, this world that we call ours, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. They appear larger to the eye than the stars, being many million miles nearer to our earth than any of the stars are. The planet Venus is that which is called the evening star, and sometimes the morning star, as she happens to set after, or rise before, the sun, which, in either case, is never more than three hour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P>The sun, as before said, being the center, the plan∣et, or world, nearest the sun, is Mercury; his distance from the sun is thirty-four million miles, and he moves
<PB N="46" REF="027458_0045_0FD3DB07619240E8"/>
round in a circle always at that distance from the sun, as a top may be supposed to spin round in the tract in which a horse goes in a mill. The second world is Venus; she is fifty-seven million miles distant from the sun, and con∣sequently moves round in a circle much greater than that of Mercury. The third world is this that we inhabit, an I which is ninety-five million miles distant from the sun, and consequently moves round in a circle greater than that of Venus. The fourth world is Mars; he is dis∣tant from the sun one hundred and thirty-four million miles, and consequently moves round in a circle greater than that of our earth. The fifth is Jupiter; he is distant from the sun five hundred and fifty-seven million miles, and consequently moves round to a circle greater than that of Mars. The sixth world i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Saturn; he is distant from the sun seven hundred and sixty-three mil∣lion miles, and consequently moves round in a circle that surrounds the circles or orbits of all the other worlds or planets.</P>
<P>The space, therefore, in the air, or in the immensity of space, that our solar system takes up for the several worlds to perform their revolutions in round the sun, is of the extent, in a strait line, of the whole diameter of the orbit or circle in which Saturn moves round the sun, which being double his distance from the sun, is fifteen hundred and twenty-six million miles; and its circular extent is nearly five thousand million, and its globical con∣tent is almost three thousand five hundred millions times three thousand five hundred million square miles.</P>
<P>But this, immense as it is, is only one system of worlds; Beyond this, at a vast distance into space, far beyond all power of calculation, are the stars, called the fixed stars. They are called fixed, because they have no revolutionary motion as the six worlds or planets have, that I have been describing. Those fixed stars continue always at the same distance from each other, and always in the same place, as the sun does in the center of our system. The probability therefore i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that each of those fixed stars is also a sun, round which another system of worlds or planets, though too remote for us to discover,
<PB N="47" REF="027458_0046_0FD3DB0A749A8998"/>
performs its revolutions, as our system of worlds does round our central sun.</P>
<P>By this easy progression of ideas, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he immensity of space will appear to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to be filled with systems of worlds; and that no part of space lies waste, any more than any part of our globe of earth and water is left unoccupied.</P>
<P>HAVING thus endeavoured to convey, in a fa∣miliar and easy manner, some idea of the structure of the universe, I return to explain what I before alluded to, namely, the great benefits arising to man in consequence of the Creator having made a <HI>plurality</HI> of worlds, such as our system is, consisting of a central sun, and six worlds, besides satellites, in preference to that of creating one world only of a vast extent. It is an idea I have never lost sight of, that all our knowledge of science is derived from the revolutions (exhibited to our eye, and from thence to our understanding) which those several planets, or worlds, of which our system is composed, make in their circuit round the sun.</P>
<P>Had then the quantity of matter which these six worlds contain been blended into one solitary globe, the conse∣quence to us would have been, that either no revolution∣ary motion would have existed, or not a sufficiency of it to give us the ideas and the knowledge of science we now have; and it is from the sciences that all the mechanical arts that contribute so much to our earthly felicity and comfort are derived.</P>
<P>As therefore the Creator made nothing in vain, so also must it be believed that he organized the structure of the universe in the most advantageous manner for the benefit of man: and as we see, and from experience feel the benefits we derive from the structure of the universe, formed as it is, which benefits we should not have had the opportunity of enjoying, if the structure, so far as relates to our system, had been a solitary globe, we can discover, at least, one reason why a <HI>plurality</HI> of worlds has been
<PB N="48" REF="027458_0047_0FD3DB0C9DB5FCD0"/>
made, and that reason calls forth the devotional gratitude of man, as well as his admiration.</P>
<P>But it is not to us, the inhabitants of this globe, only, that the benefits arising from a plurality of worlds are limited. The inhabitants of each of the worlds, of which our system is composed, enjoy the same opportu∣nities of knowledge as we do. They behold the revolu∣tionary motions of our earth, as we behold theirs. All the planets revolve in sight of each other; and therefore the same universal school of science presents itself to all.</P>
<P>Neither does the knowledge stop here. The system of worlds next to us, exhibits in its revolution the same principles and school of science to the inhabitants of their system, as our system does to us, and in like manner throughout the immensity of space.</P>
<P>Our ideas, not only of the Almightiness of the Creator, but of his wisdom and of his beneficence, be∣come enlarged in proportion as we contemplate the ex∣tent and the structure of the universe. The solitary idea of a solitary world rolling, or at rest, in the immense ocean of space, gives place to the cheerful idea of a so∣ciety of worlds, so happily contrived, as to administer, even by their motion, instruction to man. We see our own earth filled with abundance; but we forget to con∣sider how much of that abundance is owing to the scien∣tific knowledge the vast machinery of the universe has un∣folded.</P>
<P>But in the midst of those reflections, what are we to think of the christian system of faith that forms itself up∣on the idea of only one world, and that of no greater ex∣tent, as is before shewn, than twenty-five thousand miles? An extent, which a man walking at the rate of three miles an hour, for twelve hours in a day, could he keep on in a circular direction, would walk entirely round in less than two years. Alas! what is this to the mighty ocean of space, and the Almighty power of the Creator.</P>
<P>From whence then could arise the solitary and strange conceit that the Almighty, who had millions of worlds equally dependent on his protection, should quit the care of all the rest, and come to die in our world,
<PB N="49" REF="027458_0048_0FD3DB0CA26B5338"/>
because, they say, one man and one woman had eaten an apple? And on the other hand, are we to suppose that every world in the boundless creation, had an Eve, and apple, a serpent, and a redeemer? In this case, the person who is errevently called the Son of God, and sometimes God himself, would have nothing else to do than to travel from world to world, in an endless suc∣cession of death with scarcely a momentary interval of life.</P>
<P>It has been, by rejecting the evidence, that the word, or works of God in the creation, affords to our senses, and the action of our reason upon that evidence, that so many wild and whimsical systems of faith, and of religion, have been fabricated and set up. There may be many systems of religion, that, so far from being morally bad, are in many respects morally good: but there can be but ONE that is true, and that one necessarily must, as it ever will, be in all things consistent with the ever existing word of God that we behold in his works. But such is the strange construction of the christian system of faith, that every evidence the heavens afford to man, either directly contra∣dicts it, or renders it absurd.</P>
<P>It is possible to believe, and I always feel pleasure in encouraging myself to believe it, that there have been men in the world who persuaded themselves that what is called <HI>a pious fraud,</HI> might, at least under particular circumstances be productive of some good. But the fraud being once established, could not afterwards be ex∣plained; for it is with a pious fraud, as with a bad action, it begess a calamitous necessity of going on.</P>
<P>The persons who first preached the christian system of faith, and in some measure combined with it the mor∣ality preached by Jesus Christ, might persuade themselves that it was better than the heathen mythology that then prevailed. From the first preachers, the fraud went on to the second, and to the third, till the idea of its being a pious fraud became lost in the belief of its being true; and that belief became again encouraged by the interest of those who made a livelihood by preaching it.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="027458_0049_0FD3D9298C29A1D8"/>
But though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a belief might, by such means, be rendered almost general among the laity, it is next to im∣possible to account for the continual persecution carried on by the church, for several hundred years, against the sciences and against the professors of science, if the church, had not some record or some tradition that it was origi∣nally no other than a pious fraud, or did not foresee that it could not be maintained against the evidence that the structure of the universe afforded.</P>
<P>HAVING thus shewn the irreconcileable inconsis∣tencies between the real word of God existing in the uni∣verse, and that which is called <HI>the word of God,</HI> as shewn to us in a printed book that any man might make, I pro∣ceed to speak of the three principal means that have been employed in all ages, and perhaps in all countries, to impose upon mankind.</P>
<P>Those three means are, Mystery, Miracle, and Pro∣phecy. The two first are incompatible with true religion, and the third ought always to be suspected.</P>
<P>With respect to mystery, every thing we behold is, in one sense a mystery to us. Our own existence is a mystery; the whole vegetable world is a mystery. We cannot account how it is that an acorn, when put into the ground, is made to develope itself and become an oak. We know now how it is that the feed we sow un∣folds and multiplies itself, and returns to us such an abundant interest for so small a capital.</P>
<P>The fact, however, as distinct from the operating cause, is not a mystery, because we see it; and we know also the means we are to use, which is no other than put∣ting the seed into the ground. We know therefore as much as is necessary for us to know; and that part of the operation that we do not know, and which if we did, we could not perform, the Creator takes upon himself and performs it for us. We are therefore better off than if we had been let into the secret, and left to do it for our∣selves.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="027458_0050_0FD3DB120A954250"/>
But though every created thing is in this sense a mystery, the word mystery cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> applied to <HI>moral truth;</HI> any more than obscurity can be applied to light. The God in whom we believe is a God of moral truth, and not a God of mystery or obscurity. Mystery is the antagonist of truth. It is a fog of human invention, that obscures truth, and represents it in distortion. Truth never envelopes <HI>itself</HI> in mystery; and the mystery in which it is at any time enveloped, is the work of its an∣tagonist, and never of itself.</P>
<P>Religion, therefore, being the belief of a God, and the practice of moral truth, cannot have connection with mystery. The belief of a God, so far from having any thing of mystery in it, is of all beliefs the most easy, be∣cause it arises to us, as is before observed, out of necessity. And the practice of moral truth, or in other words, a prac∣tical imitation of the moral goodness of God, is no other than our acting towards each other, as he acts benignly to∣wards all. We cannot <HI>serve</HI> God in the manner we serve those who cannot do without such service; and, there∣fore, the only idea we can have of serving God, is that of contributing to the happiness of the living creation that God has made. This cannot be done by retiring our∣selves from the society of the world, and spending a re∣cluse life <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> selfish devotion.</P>
<P>The very nature and design of religion, if I may so ex∣press it, prove, even to demonstration, that it must be free from every thing of mystery, and uni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cumbered with ev∣ery thing that is mysterious. Religion, considered as a duty, is incumbent upon every living soul alike, and therefore must be on a level to the understanding and com∣prehension of all. Man does not learn religion as he learns the secrets and mysteries of a trade. He learns the theory of religion by reflection. It arises out of the action of his own mind upon the things which he sees, or upon what he may happen to hear or to read, and the practice joins itself therto. When men, whether from policy or pious fraud, set up systems of religion incompatible with the word or works of God in the creation, and not only above, but repugnant to human comprehension, they
<PB N="52" REF="027458_0051_0FD3DB120E8F3FC8"/>
were under the necessity of inventing, or adopting a word that should serve as a bar to all questions, inquiries and speculations. The word <HI>mystery</HI> answered this purpose; and thus it has happened that religion, which, in itself, is without mystery, has been corrupted into a fog of mys∣teries.</P>
<P>As <HI>mystery</HI> answered all general purposes, <HI>miracle</HI> fol∣lowed as an occasional auxiliary. The former served to be wilder the mind, the latter to puzzle the sense. The one was the lingo, the other the legerdemain.</P>
<P>But before going further into this subject, it will be proper to inquire what is to be understood by a miracle.</P>
<P>In the same sense that every thing may be said to be a mystery, so also may it be said, that every thing is a miracle, and that no one thing is a greater miracle than another. The elephant, though larger, is not a greater miracle than a mite; nor a mountain a greater mir∣acle than an at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m. To an Almighty power, it is no more difficult to make the one than the other, and no more difficult to make a million of worlds than to make one. Every thing therefore is a miracle in one sense; whilst, in the other sense, there is no such thing as a mi∣racle. It is a miracle, when compared to our power, and to our comprehension. It is not a miracle, compared to the power that performs it. But as nothing in this de∣scription conveys the idea that is affixed to the word mi∣racle, it is necessary to carry the inquiry further.</P>
<P>Mankind have conceived to themselves certain laws, by which, what they call nature is supposed to act; and that a miracle is something contrary to the operation and effect of those laws. But unless we know the whole ex∣tent of those laws, and of what are commonly called the powers of nature, we are not able to judge whether any thing that may appear to us wonderful or miraculous, be within, or be beyond, or be contrary to, her natural power of acting.</P>
<P>The ascension of a man several miles high into the air, would have every thing in it that constitutes the idea of a miracle, if it were not known that a species of air can be generated several times lighter than the common
<PB N="53" REF="027458_0052_0FD44038832BD038"/>
atmospheric air, and yet possess elasticity enough to pre∣vent the balloon in which that light air is inclosed, from being compressed into as many times less bulk, by the common air that surrounds it. In like man∣ner, extracting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lashes or sparks of fire from the hu∣man body, as visibly as from a steel struck with a slint, and causing iron or steel to move without any visible agent, would also give the idea of a miracle, if we were not acquainted with electricity and magnetism: so also would many other experiments in natural philosophy, to those who are not acquainted, with the subject. The restoring persons to life, who are to appearance dead, as is practised upon drowned persons, would also be a mira∣cle, if it were not known that animation is capable of being suspended, without being extinct.</P>
<P>Besides these, there are performances by slight of hand, and by persons acting in concert, that have a mi∣raculous appearance, which, when known, are thought nothing of. And besides these, there are mechanical and optical deceptions. There is now an exhibition in Paris, of ghosts or spectres, which, thought it is not imposed up∣on the spectators as a fact, has an astonishing appearance. As therefore we know not the extent to which nature or art can go, there is no positive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riterion to determine what a miracle is; and mankind, in giving credit to ap∣pearances, under the idea of their being miracles, are subject to be continually imposed upon.</P>
<P>Since then appearances are so capable of deceiving, and things not real have a strong resemblance to things that are, nothing can be more inconsistent than to sup∣pose that the Almighty would make use of means, such as are called miracles, that would subject the person who performed them to the suspicion of being an impostor, and the persons who related them to be suspected of lying, and the doctrine intended to be supported thereby, to be suspected as a fabulous invention.</P>
<P>Of all the modes of evidence that ever were invented to obtain belief to any system or opinion, to which the name of religion has been given, that of <HI>miracle,</HI> how∣ever
<PB N="54" REF="027458_0053_0FD4403AACC5F9A0"/>
successful the imposition may have been, is the most inconsistent. For, in the first place, whenever recourse is had to show, for the purpose of procuring that belief (for a miracle, under any idea of the word, is a show) it im∣plies a lameness or weakness in the doctrine that is preached. And, in the second place, it is degrading the Almighty into the character of a show-man, playing tricks to amuse and make the people stare and wonder. It is also the most equivocal sort of evidence that can be set up; for the belief is not to depend upon the thing called a miracle, but upon the credit of the reporter, who says that he saw it; and therefore the thing, were it true, would have no better chance of being believed than if it were a lie.</P>
<P>Suppose I were to say, that when I sat down to write this book, a hand presented itself in the air, took up the pen, and wrote every word that is herein written; would any body believe me? certainly they would not. Would they believe me a whit the more if the thing had been a fact? certainly they would not. Since, then, a real miracle, were it to happen, would be subject to the same fate as the falshood, the inconsistency becomes the greater, of supposing the Almighty would make use of means that would not answer the purpose for which they were intended, even if it were real.</P>
<P>If we were to suppose a miracle to be something so entirely out of the course of what is called nature, that she must go out of that course to accomplish it; and we see an account given of such miracle by the person who said he saw it, it raises a question in the mind, very easily decided; which is, Is it more probable that nature should go out of her course, or that a man should tell a lie? We have never seen in our time, nature go out of her course, but we have good reason to believe that millions of lies have been told in the same time; it is, therefore, at least millions to one, that the reporter of a miracle tells a lie.</P>
<P>The story of the whale swallowing Jonah, though a whale is large enough to do it, borders greatly on the mar∣vellous; but it would have approached nearer to the idea
<PB N="55" REF="027458_0054_0FD4403C6B6F4728"/>
of a miracle, if Jonah had swallowed the whale. In this case, which may serve for all cases of miracles, the matter would decide itself as before s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ated, namely, Is it more probable that a man should have swallowed a whale, or told a lie?</P>
<P>But supposing that Jonah had really swallowed the whale, and gone with it in his belly to Nineveh, and to convince the people that it was true, have cast it up in their sight of the full length and fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of a whale, would they not have believed him to have been the devil instead of a prophet? Or, if the whale had carried Jonah to Nin∣eveh, and cast him up in the same public manner, would they not have believed the whale to have been the devil, and Jonah, one of his imps?</P>
<P>The most extraordinary of all the things called mir∣acles, related in the New Testament, is that of the devil flying away with Jesus Christ, and carrying him to the top of a high mountain; and to the top of the highest pinna∣cle of the temple, and showing him, and promising to him <HI>aid the kingdoms of the world.</HI> How happened it that he did not discover America? or is it only with <HI>king∣doms</HI> that his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> highness has any interest?</P>
<P>I have too much respect for the moral character of Christ, to believe that he told this whale of a miracle himself; neither is it easy to account for what purpose it could have been fabricated, unless it were to impose upon the connoisseurs of miracles, as is sometimes practised up∣on the connoisseurs of Queen Anne's farthings, and collectors of relics and antiquities; or to render the belief of miracles rediculous, by outdoing miracle, as Don Quix∣ote outdid chivalry; or to embarrass the belief of miracles by making it doubtful by what power, whether of God, or of the devil, any thing called a miracle was performed. It requires, however, a great deal of faith in the devil to belief this miracle.</P>
<P>In every point of view, in which those things called miracles can be placed and considered, the reality of them is improbable, and their existence unnecessary. They would not, as before observed, answer any useful purpose, even if they were true; for it is more difficult to obtain belief
<PB N="56" REF="027458_0055_0FD4403E8698C438"/>
to a miracle, than to a principle evidently mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any miracle. Moral principle speaks universally for itself, Miracle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould be but a thing of the moment, and seen but by a few; after this, it requires a transfer of faith, from God to man, to believe a miracle upon man's re∣port. Instead therefore of admitting the recitals of mira∣cles, as evidence of any system of religion being true, they ought to be considered as symptoms of its being fabulous. It is necessary to the full and upright character of truth, that it rejects the crutch; and it is consistent with the character of fable, to seek the aid that truth re∣jects. Thus much for mystery and miracle.</P>
<P>As mystery and miracle took charge of the past and the present, prophecy took charge of the future, and rounded the tenses of faith. It was not sufficient to know what had been done, but what would be done. The sup∣posed prophet was the supposed historian of times to come; and if he happened, in shooting with a long bow of a thousand years, to strike within a thousand miles of a mark, the ingenuity of posterity could make it point blank; and if he happened to be directly wrong; it was only to suppose, as in the case of Jonah and Ninevah, that God had repented himself, and changed his mind. What a fool do fabulous systems of religion make of man!</P>
<P>IT has been shewn in a former part of this work, that the original meaning of the words <HI>prophet</HI> and <HI>pro∣phesying</HI> has been changed, and that a prophet, in the sense the word is now used, is a creature of modern in∣vention; and it is owing to this change in the meaning of the words, that the flights and metaphors of the Jewish poets, and phrases and expressions now rendered obscure by our not being acquainted with the local circumstances to which they applied at the time they were used, have been erected into prophesies, and made to bend to expla∣nations at the will and whimsical conceits of sectaries, ex∣pounders, and commentators. Every thing unintelligible

was prophetical, and every thing insignificant was typical. A blunder would have served for prophecy; and a dish∣clout for a type.</P>
<P>If by a prophet we are to suppose a man to whom the Almighty communicated some event that would take place in future, either there were such men, or there were not. If there were, it is consistent to believe that the event, so communicated, would be told in terms that could be understood, and not related in such a loose and obscure manner as to be out of the comprehension of those that heard it, and so equivocal as to fit almost any circumstance that might happen afterwards. It is con∣ceiving very irreverently of the Almighty to suppose he would deal in this j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sting manner with mankind▪ yet all the things called prophecies, in the book called the Bi∣ble, come under this description.</P>
<P>But it is with prophecy, as it is with miracle. It could not answer the purpose even if it were real. Those to whom a prophecy should be told, could not tell whether the man prophesied or lied, or whether it had been re∣vealed to him, or whether he conceited it: and if the thing that the prophesied, or pretended to prophecy, should happen, or something like it among the multiude of things that are daily happening, nobody could again know whether he foreknew it, or guessed at it, or whether it was accidental. A prophet, therefore, is a character use∣less and unnecessary: and the safe side of the case is, to guard against being imposed upon by not giving credit to such relations.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, mystery, miracle, and prophecy, are appendages that belong to fabulous and not to true religion. They are the means by which so many <HI>Lo heres!</HI> and <HI>Lo theres!</HI> have been spread about the world, and religion been made into a trade. The success of one impostor gave encouragement to another, and the quieting salvo of doing <HI>some</HI> good by keeping up a <HI>pious fraud,</HI> protected them from remorse.</P>
<P>Having now extended the subject to a greater length than I first intended, I shall bring it to a close, by ab∣stracting a summary from the whole.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="027458_0057_0FD440449BFC8918"/>
First, That the idea or belief of a word of God ex∣isting in print, or in writing or in speech, is inconsistent in itself for the reasons already assigned. These reasons, among many others, are the want of a universal language; the mutability of language; the errors to which transla∣tions are subject; the possibility of totally suppressing such a word; the probability of altering it, or of fabri∣cating the whole, and imposing it upon the world.</P>
<P>Secondly, That the creation we behold, is the real and ever-existing word of God, in which we cannot be deceived. It proclaimeth his power, it demonstrates his wisdom, it manifests his goodness and beneficence.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That the moral duty of man consists in imitating the moral goodness and beneficence of God man∣ifested in the creation towards all his creatures. That seeing, as we daily do, the goodness of God to all men, it is an example, calling upon all men to practise the same towards each other; and consequently that every thing of persecution and revenge between man and man, and every thing of cruelty to animals, is a violation of moral duty.</P>
<P>I trouble not myself about the manner of future ex∣istence. I content myself with believing, even to posi∣tive conviction, that the power that gave me existence is able to continue it, in any form and manner he pleases, eith∣er with or without this body; and it appears more prob∣able to me, that I shall continue to exist hereafter, than that I should have had existence, as I now have, before that existence began.</P>
<P>It is certain that, in one point, all nations of the earth and all religions agree. All believe in a God. The things in which they disagree, are the redundancies annex∣ed to that belief; and therefore, if ever an universal relig∣ion should prevail, it will not be believing any thing new, but in getting rid of redundancies, and believing as man believed at first. Adam, if ever there was such a man, was created a Deist; but in the mean time let every man fol∣low, as he has a right to do, the religion and the worship he prefers.</P>
