<HEAD>A short <HI>SKETCH,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>MR. LENT MUNSON, the son of Lieut. <HI>Levi Munson,</HI> now of Harwinton, in Connecticut, was born in <HI>Wallingford,</HI> the 3d of March 1768. In the 10th year of his age, he entered as a musician into the Continental Army, where he continued until the establishment of peace; after which he joined the family, who had in his absence removed to Harwinton. Here he resided until the year 1787, when he again entered into the service of his country, in the corps raised by Col. David Humphreys, with the rank of Sergeant-Musician. The short duration of that command soon left him again under the direction of his parents, where he continued until the year 1788,— when he once more determined upon a military life. Ac∣cordingly he went to Hartford, and engaged for the term of three years; and joined the army at Fort Harmer, in the Western Country; where he performed the duty of Musician until early in the year 1789, when he was ad∣vanced to the rank of Quarter Master-Sergeant to the garrison, in both of which stations his conduct was un∣exceptionable. In December 1790, orders came out at Fort Washington, where Mr. <HI>Munson</HI> then was stationed, for re-enlisting the men. He engaged for three years more, and was soon after ordered to Connecticut on the recruiting service. He was stationed at Middletown, where he continued in that duty until 1793, when he joined the army again at Fort Washington. During his residence at Middletown, he cultivated an acquaintance with many respectable inhabitants of that city, who not∣withstanding his humble rank in life, discovered his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>l <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and treated him with the politeness and respect <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>served. The attention paid him at this and other <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had a tendency to wean him from the army, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> drawn up in his mind a determination, after the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> his present engagements, to obtain his bread <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> means. But not long after he had joined
<PB N="4" REF="033827_0004_0FF97C75D8F28538"/>
the army, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> sent on a detachment, as an escort to provision, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the command of Lieut. <HI>Loury.</HI> On the 17th of October, the party was attacked by the Savages, and totally defeated: The officers, and many of the sol∣diers, were killed: Mr. <HI>Munson,</HI> being with others miss∣ing, was supposed to be amongst the slain.</P>
<P>The melancholy tidings of this unhappy affair, were communicated to the family, and other friends, who la∣mented his untimely end, with all the bitterness of grief natural to the circumstances of his supposed death.</P>
<P>But Providence had reserved him for other scenes. Finding no hopes in flight, he had determined to act the part of a soldier, and sell his life as dear as pos∣sible; but being quite spent with fatigue, he was soon disarmed by the Savages, and stript of all his clothes, ex∣cept shoes, socks, and overalls. They gave him in ex∣change an old Indian coat, and the second day an old shirt. In this dress he was driven five or six days; the Indians on horseback still riding upon his heels, till his strength was almost wholly exhausted, and he more than once con∣cluded, he could struggle no longer with his fate, but must seek a refuge in the shades of death. On the third day after his capture they painted him, in token of life and pardon. Each night he was fast bound, and placed between two Savages; so that there was no possibility of escaping from them. They moreover had left the place of action in such haste, for fear of pursuit, that they could take but very little provision; in consequence of which the prisoners had the additional misery of hunger to en∣counter. There were eleven taken; but one of the un∣happy number, being unable to travel at the unmerciful rate the Savages required, was killed: The other ten ar∣rived at an Indian town, belonging to the Ottawa tribe. For several days after their arrival, Mr. <HI>Munson</HI> was <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣able to walk: On the 11th of his captivity they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> hair, and put a jewel in his nose; they attempt<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cut his ears, which he resisted with such spirit <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>verance that they finally did not insist on his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. His principal diet was corn either parched <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> water, without salt. 'Tis true they had <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>

custom was to let it putrify before they ate it, he could not partake of their repast, and to stay in their huts at meal time was almost intolerable.</P>
<P>In this wretched situation he continued for eight months, compelled to hard labour;—almost without clothing ex∣posed to the inclemencies of the winter season, far remo∣ved from all his friends who, ignorant of his fate, sup∣posed him beyond all the troubles of this life.—His forti∣tude, however, did not forsake him;—he revolved in his mind various plans for escaping from them: But being a stranger to the country thro' which he must pass, ignorant of the course he ought to steer, and beset with the jealous vigilance of his enemies, he still found insurmountable ob∣stables before him. Having however by much com∣plaisance and seeming tranquillity, flattered his Master into a security, he came to the determination of taking his gun, and trusting himself to fortune: But before he had put this hazardous experiment in execution, he happily met with an English trader, who suggested a safer method. After receiving from this trader the point of compass he ought to observe, and other useful directions, on the 17th of June he left them in a profound sleep; and assisted by the light of the moon, which was now rising, he took his unknown way through the uninhabited wilderness, amid the solemn silence of the night. He travelled till the dawn of day, when he secreted himself in some weeds and grass, about 15 rods from a kind of road in which he travelled. In this situation he saw two of his enemies pursuing after him on horseback. In about an hour and a half they re∣turned the same way. The next night he pursued his course, and arrived at some French settlement, where the people shewed him kindness. Having washed the paint from his face, and refreshed himself, about day-break he continued his rout, and travelling 26 miles, about 11 o'clock he came to another settlement. He had but just stepped into the house, when accidentally looking out at the window, he saw twelve Indians crossing a river within twelve rods of the house. The gentleman proved to be friendly, and concealed him in an upper loft for his security in case they had entered: But they pursued the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich he came; so that had he been ten minutes
<PB N="6" REF="033827_0006_0FF97CAB71C568C8"/>
later, he must inevitably have fallen into their hands,— the fatal consequences of which are easily conceived. Here he stayed two days, and the people shewed him much kindness. The Lady gave him a good shirt, and a hat, the first which had been on his head in eight months;— they procured him a passage by water to Detroit, and gave him a sufficient quantity of provisions for the journey. Such are the blessed fruits of benevolence!—When he arrived at that fortress, Col. <HI>English,</HI> the commanding officer, was no less benevolent: He gave him a plenty of provisions, and a passport;—put him on board of a vessel in his Majesty's service, and sent him to Niagara, where he met with a number of New-England gentlemen, whose liberality supplied him with necessaries to complete his journey. Capt. <HI>Guernsey,</HI> late of Durham, and Mr. <HI>Salmon Goodrich,</HI> of Berlin, were of the number of these gentlemen, whose kindness did honour both to themselves and their country, and whose names Mr. <HI>Munson</HI> hath frequently mentioned with gratitude.</P>
<P>Here, after eight months of almost incessant fatigue of body and mind, he took a short repose; and afterwards getting a passage by water to Skenectady, on the 21st of July he again arrived at his Father's house. The joy and surprise of his Parents, on receiving again that Son to their arms whom they had thought no longer an inhabitant of this world;—whom they had mourned as dead for many sorrowful months, is much better conceived than expressed.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Munson's</HI> military career here ended. After stay∣ing a short time with his friends, in Harwinton, he re∣paired to Middletown, where he gladdened the hearts of his acquaintance, and with whom he consulted upon the future plans of his life. As the seas seemed to open the fairest prospect for him towards wealth and respectability, he applied himself to the study of navigation, and soon became master of it. His earnest desire of perfecting himself in the maritime profession, induced him to ship on board a vessel as a raw hand, in an European voyage. The several duties to which he was called, during the un∣dertaking, were performed with so much <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and
<PB N="7" REF="033827_0007_0FF97CC5113B58B0"/>
dispatch, that in his settlement with the owners, on his return, they allowed him Four Dollars a month for extra services. He remained with his friends a short time, ar∣ranging his affairs for another voyage, which he under∣took for the West-Indies. This voyage proved his last: He was captured by the French, and carried into the island of St. Croix a prisoner, where he was seized with a vio∣lent fever, which in a short time put an end to his labours. He died on the 21st of Sept. 1796;—after a toilsome life of 28 years, 6 months, and 18 days,—11 years and four months of which was spent in the service of his country.</P>
<P>In the course of his travels, he had contracted an ac∣quaintance with many worthy and respectable people: As their friendship for him was wholly disinterested, the un∣usual warmth of their affection, affords us the highest en∣comium upon his character.—"The opportunity I had of knowing him (saith one of these, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cap<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>JOHN PRATT,</HI> of <HI>Middletown,</HI> in a letter to Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dated <HI>December 9</HI>th, <HI>17<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>6</HI></NOTE>) licences me to de∣clare, that he was honest, prudent, charitable, and just in all his dealings:—That possessing these qualities, together with an amiable disposition, he bid fair to honour society, make his family happy, and himself respected. Those who knew him, loved and respected him; those who may know his character, if they have any regard to merit, will revere his memory. The above observations I have made to you without solicitation: I have offered them as a testi∣mony of my great esteem and regard for a deceased friend; and let me assure you, they fall far short of the evidence I feel within me."</P>
<P>Lieut. <HI>Munson</HI> whose family, consisting of eight sons and a daughter, had many of them often been engaged in the service of the public, and consequently dispersed into va∣rious parts of the country, had the pleasure of seeing the most of them together on the 11th day of January <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>2,— a pleasure well known to those who are parents. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> con∣sequence of this favour, he had desired his neighbours and friends to meet with him and his family at the House
<PB N="8" REF="033827_0008_0FF97CE70F0225D8"/>
of GOD, on the 11th of January 1797, to offer at the foot of his Altar public Thanks for his goodness. But in the mean time arrived the sad news that <HI>one</HI> of this Family was no longer amongst the living. The proposed Meet∣ing of course gave place to another on a different occasion, —when the following DISCOURSE was delivered. The Mourners requested a Copy of it; and as our duty requires us on such occasions to deny them no <HI>means of consolation,</HI> 'tis humbly requested the courteous Reader will accept THIS, as <HI>some</HI> apology for the publication.</P>
