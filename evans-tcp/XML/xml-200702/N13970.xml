<HEAD>TO DR. DELACOUR.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I AM</HI> not going to ascribe to you a miracle. I renounce enthusiasm, and think too highly of your understanding to insult it by flattery. But, so far as <HI>second</HI> causes may be necessary to fulfil the fiat of the first, in the government of human affairs, I do, in the most solemn manner, believe, you were the means of saving me, in the summer of <HI>1779</HI> from death.</P>
<P>Prior to the event which procured me the benefit of your advice, it had been my chief pleasure to compose the volumes which now ap∣proach you. Struck by an uncommon tenderness in the circumstances, whereon the work is founded, I wished earnestly for health to finish what might prove a source of virtuous entertainment. Not that I laid any stress on my <HI>own</HI> effort towards it, but because the facts were pre∣eminently beautiful in <HI>themselves;</HI> and courted every addition of fancy, with every embellishment of the heart. I recovered. Emma Corbett was concluded. The incidents, without the least literary adornment, take a strong hold of the feelings; and, probably, will owe more to their simplicity and native <HI>TRUTH,</HI> than if, by a more elaborate effort, I had robbed them of this <HI>genuine</HI> advantage.</P>
<P><HI>The tear of Sensibility</HI> is at once the softest and best evidence of the praise which it is my ambition to merit on this occasion: and if it be my lot to enjoy this honour, you cannot be ignorant of the means by which it has been conferred. Notwithstanding this, every thing, which tends to shew the world how entirely your <HI>generosity</HI> prevailed over your <HI>interest,</HI> will, I know, be interdicted, I comply therefore, Sir, with the proscriptions of delicacy, though I am thereby deprived of doing justice: and with whatever difficulty I repress the current of my gratitude; only reserving to myself the pleasure to declare publicly, how much I am, Sir,</P>

<P>YOUR promises are fair, and the language in which they are expressed, is proper to your age, and suitable to your character. I hasten to give you the opportunity you invite. Re∣sign your commission—<HI>that</HI> commission which, against all dissuasive hints, you have solicited and procured. Lay down your sword, or else draw it in the cause of liberty and Heaven. Your school-fellow, Edward, has, as you know, fallen a victim to these hostilities. My darling son is no more. He was plentifully provided for in the colonies.—The spot which he occupied was disforested by his ancestors, who, with much toil and expence, turned to a smiling domain what they found a wilderness, inauspicious to every purpose of society. It descended to this unhappy youth just as tyranny be∣gan

He took possession of the land, which before was under the superintendance of an agent. You know how soon he was in∣vaded,—how soon his little territory was laid waste,—his house set on fire,—and how, when the enemy advanced to his door, he was hurried into arms. He became a soldier on necessity. He fought —He fell!—</P>
<P>The blow which killed a son had well nigh killed a father also.— Yet, in presence of Emma and you, I exerted my utmost fortitude. But the wound is not healed; it is still bleeding at my heart.— To mens eyes it seems well. I have tied about it a political ban∣dage, yet I secretly detest every principle which <HI>begun</HI>▪ and every motive which <HI>continues,</HI> this <HI>assassination of America.</HI> Long I have kept the anguish of these sentiments to myself. It makes no part of my conversation:—but now, finding that your ardour, O my dear Harry, has taken a wrong direction, it is time to speak—it is time to tell you, what will <HI>lose</HI> and what will <HI>gain</HI> me for <HI>ever.</HI> Hammond, you are about to engage in a cruel cause—a cause to which I object both as patriot and as parent. The vigour with which you have sought to obtain an authority to go forth <HI>amongst</HI> your countrymen, <HI>against</HI> your countrymen, bears in it something shock∣ing to my nature. Whom I thought tender, him I find bloody. Do you desire to be a hero? the means are ready. Change the po∣sition of the attack, and <HI>that</HI> will, in itself be heroism. Or, which is still <HI>better,</HI> if you could cultivate the embellishing arts of peace, and the Muses who love you, apologize to your patron the Earl for the trouble you have given—take the hand of Emma Corbett, and, with her, share the fortunes of her father.</P>
<P>These sentiments declare my opinion of your honour; and my esteem for your person is expressed in the presents I tender. Per∣ceiving how obstinately you were bent to aid this fallacious plot against the rights of nature and mankind; I thought to let you go blindly on to blacken yet more the catalogue of British oppressors; but I well knew the source and progress of that sentiment which unites you to my only surviving child, and I feel myself unwilling, that the son of a dear deceased friend should thus prostitute his cou∣rage in an action so peculiarly base, so peculiarly barbarous— Emma, fortune, and my favour, are before you. You know the prizes, and you are not now ignorant of the only mode of conduct by which they can be obtained. Farewell then. Think seriously, venerate my trust, and do not forfeit my esteem, I put you to the test.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV. TO C. CORBETT, <HI>Esq.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NO greater time is necessary to determine, than that which will be taken up in penning the determination. I <HI>do</HI> venerate your trust. My principles hold every man's private opinion a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="5" REF="017678_0005_0FA21F0729DF21A8"/>
sacred; but the very same principles compel me to forfeit even <HI>your</HI> affection, Sir, if it is to be preserved at the price of my duty. We, unfortunately, happen to see the American dispute in opposite lights. It is sufficient to a soldier that he believes his quarrel to be just. You arraign my humanly. Wherefore? I retort not the accusation. May we not consider a public contest in different points of view, and yet be friends? Both may act from feeling▪ and both on principle. You imagine America is aggrieved, while I look upon <HI>her</HI> at the aggressor. What of that? Do we interfere with the opinions of each other? I was not accessary to the death of your son; and had it been my fate to meet him in the field, I can conceive the point on which nature would have insisted. She would gracefully have led us both a little from the line of duty, and spared one in sympathy to the other N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, more. Had I seen the sword tremble at his bosom, my own should for that moment have been as a shield, and you know not <HI>how</HI> far I would have ventured for the brother of Emma. But as to the commission, O be assured, I did not solicit it till I had well reflected on every consequence, pro∣bable and possible, of obtaining it. It <HI>is</HI> obtained, and I rejoice; nor could it be resigned to purchase a diadem, with Emma on a throne to wear it. Change sides! No, Sir; if these are to be the terms, take back the hand you <HI>permitted</HI> me to win, and possess, undivided, her fortune and your own. You have not looked ac∣curately at my soul. As I am not, on the one hand, so <HI>sensual,</HI> to gratify my passion at the expence of the holy faith and the solemn services which I have sworn to my country; so neither am I so <HI>sor∣did</HI> on the other, as to court her inheritance without many endea∣vours, consistent with the powers of my youth, to add something to her fortune. Patrimony hath dropt from my hope, but nature may, perhaps, have bestowed the equivalent. The arts of war, ra∣ther than those of peace, seem, at this conjuncture, to lay the strongest claim to the genius of a young Englishman; and I have no notion of that indolence which can be content to fall into the arms of beauty and prosperity, without a single effort to deserve them. If, Sir, I have any tender interest in the heart of Emma, as I think I have, it has been more generously fought. But why do I argue with so much gravity, when perhaps you intend all this in the way of trial: willing to see if my attachment to my native country was not less than my passion for my mistress. Yes, yes, this is your experiment. You wanted to know whether it was ap∣petite or affection that influenced me in regard to your daughter, and you will not, I trust, be displeased to find the basis as solid as your friendship or solicitude might desire.</P>
<P>Adieu, dear Sir; I thank you for the stratagem: and glory in every success that draws me nearer to your heart.—</P>

You will, however, in common politeness, cease to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ender yourself unwelcome, and save me from an appearance of inhospitality. I think you ought, as a man of honour, to drop corresponding with Emma, and let it seem to be your own act and deed self-suggested, and self-inspired. This, however, your conscience will best settle. To that I refer you. As you so soon depart, a few more letters cannot be very material. Farther avowals of love, however, I shall consider as seductions.— Farewell. To wish you success in your undertakings would be to partake of your folly: you will therefore excuse me.

<P>YOUR ship will not be ready, then, to bear you into the paths of danger, for some days. How uniformly amiable is your solicitude—dearest and best of friends—and how kind your atten∣tion to every circumstance that has the least tendency to affect my ease and my welfare! I reflect upon your generous kindness with a kind of weeping rapture that wants a name: but, thank Heaven, I find my nature sufficiently susceptible, and my heart sufficiently enlarged, to answer the demands which your tenderness and con∣stancy are daily drawing for; and, though it be a proud boast, I will venture to say that, in sentiment and friendship, in good will and good wishes, I can never die your debtor. Yet this little delay, my dear Henry!—into what an exultation of spirit did it not throw us? Last night, my beloved friend—oh, last night! the hours betwixt six and ten!—have you any idea of a period that could be rated in comparison with them? What a space! it was all spirit and all soul. Every inferior sense was annihilated, and the registering angel, if such there be, can hardly have marked a pas∣sage more soft, more affectionate, more beautiful, or more pure. During the whole course of that precious interview, alike elegant and ardent were the expressions of our lips, the flutterings of our bosoms, and the feelings of our hearts,—not a look, not a word, not a whisper, not a moment, but memory shall hoard with dearest care, and dwell▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with increasing satisfaction: Virtue shall be summound to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> her immortal page, and transcribe the correct pleasures of last night amongst the whitest transactions of humanity.

After you left me, my friend, I continued still in converse with you▪ or personally in vision pure, or by the assist∣ance of this little instrument, as fancy took the lead. The bright scenes that were then painted—with all their vivid images around me—how, how shall I describe them? Ah, Henry! the closer I look into your heart—the deeper and the more deliberately I examine and analize its properties, the more I admire and applaud. Oh, my friend! my most congenial and most amiable friend, could I speak or write of the spotless hours which we have passed together, with half the heart-felt satisfaction that I think of them—my, lan∣guage would be indeed eloquent:—it would emulate your own.
<Q>"Ye Prudes in Virtue say,—Say, ye severest,"</Q>
do I confess too much? ah that I knew words sufficiently ardent to say more! I am unequal to the task. It is pride and gratitude, sensibility and softness.

I have, indeed, perused and re-perused them till the cha∣racters are almost washed away, —I only mean, from the paper. The impressions remain <HI>uninjured</HI> elsewhere. O Hammond, Ham∣mond, how the soft emotions agitate the heart at the command of your affecting pen! As I read your pages of this morning, distress and joy, complaint and resignation, the tear of anguish and the smile of hope, all struggled together. In every pulse I felt the force of your tender eloquence. It had power to smooth the rug∣ged front of war, and I represented you returning victorious from the battle. Every varying sensation took its turn to reign; at one moment I was soothed, at another chilled. What feeling of the soul did not alternately assert its dominion? I was disturbed, quiet∣ed, agonized, and made supremely happy. Yet, O my friend, it requires an inspiration, even brigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> than your own, to disguise the tempest which is gathering around me, and to render me insen∣sible. I am not prone to make any event in life a source of unne∣cessary misery. On the contrary▪ I have a strong constitutional pro∣pensity to content, and a kind of resisting quality in my nature, which disposes me to ward off all imaginary evil. But the depar∣ture of Henry is <HI>not</HI> an imaginary evil. It is a blow, which, how∣ever suspended, cannot fail most deeply to affect whenever it falls; and fall it m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st, within the compass of—what? a few days—ah, my God! spare▪ spare me;—the tribute of my tenderness is streaming on my paper.

But you are going from me. Ah! go not with one sentiment against your Emma. If, in compliance with the decent usage of the world, or the prejudice of a worthy father, or my particular sense of that precise decorum which it becomes every unmarried woman to adopt: If, Henry▪ I have hence at any time been witheld from more cordial declarations—declarations which you might well expect in return for your's, so ardent and so elegant—<HI>allow</HI> for me▪ allow for my sex, allow for my situation.

My nature keeps such a jealous eye upon my conduct, that an instinctive something, like the internal disapprobation of a wrong measure, has often repressed the tenderest language, lest I should pass that sacred barrier, which constitutes the chief delicacy in the character of a single woman. Perhaps, I have carried this scruple to an ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reme: but I could no more help it than I can prevent the

<P>THE delightful letter of my charming Emma is lying in my bosom, as I take up the pen to reply. It came to hand at my poor Louisa's—at the house of my languishing and lovely sister; she told me she expected you. I passed an hour of pleasing attendance, after which it became painful—ah, <HI>how</HI> painful!—You did not come. Why was this? Yet it matters not.

Louisa said to me, with a tear assisting the eloquence of her expression,—▪"<HI>What,</HI> brother, hath not the long tenor of a sister's wretchedness and dis∣appointment—disappointment which is to last for <HI>ever,</HI> taught you to bear the loss of a <HI>single</HI> interview?" I felt the force of the appeal but continued to be uneasy. My sister withdrew, and my anxiety increased. By way of mitigation, I took up a pen which lay before, me and marked with it my emotions; I marked them, my Emma, in numbers, "for the numbers came." Let them be acceptable. Let the sincerity in the sentiment atone for any defect in the poetry Send me word that you are composed, and let me meet you, as chearful as you ought to be, in the morning. Louisa will look for you by ten o'clock.—Poor Louisa! ah, that Edward had not fallen!—Ah, that the brother of Emma were yet alive!— that he saw the injuries done to this unhappy country with <HI>my</HI> eyes, and that, as much inspired by Louisa as I by Emma, he was now making loyal preparation to fight the battle of Britain by the side of</P>

<P>WHATEVER is elegant, beautiful, or amiable, in that fair blossom, the human understanding, under the highest cul∣ture, is expressed in the correspondence of my dear Henry; espe∣cially in the precious favour that was inclosed in his last billet, dated from the apartment of Louisa. Ah, that Emma were an all-accomplished judge, whose plaudits might reflect all the honour which my hero deserves to receive! This being impossible, let it suffice, that you have, in these tender effusions, furnished your Emma with new proofs of tenderness, though none were necessary
<PB N="13" REF="017678_0013_0FA21F1174C16EA0"/>
to complete the measure of either sentiment in my bosom. Yet such charming repetitions and innovations can never be unwelcome; nor will Hammond refuse or overlook this unassuming tribute — this numb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and acknowledging page, which simple nature and affection offer. It is not the full foliage of the laurel, but it is the little unobtrusive leaf of gratitude and love.</P>
<P>Yet must I not, and ought I not to tremble while I praise? O, this America, my Henry! These chances of war! A theatre of mis∣chief already fatal to the lover of Louisa — I faint under the thought! The time steals on, even while I am talking of its lapse. Your virtues all known — all tried — all pressing on the eye, and twining round the heart. It is terrible — it is too much! In mercy be less kind — less amiable — less engaging. Oh, if you draw the chain thus close,— thus near; if you bind the lovely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etter thus hard — till every comfort and every joy <HI>depends</HI> on the near and ex∣quisite contact; if you contrive thus to annihilate every object but yourself —to create a void in nature— or fill it in my idea only by your existence — and that existence is to be exposed to hourly peril — what is to become of me? Or when cruel necessity shall tear you from me, which she is preparing to do, how am I to support it? Fancy sickens to reflect upon the vast and formidable distance that is so soon to divide us. To separate for such a purpose too! How few hopes —how few consolations! Correspondence will be delayed—in∣terupted — interdicted. The soft and sweet solace flowing from pen to pen will henceforth lie at the mercy of winds and waves. Our sentiments will depend upon the terrifying circumstances of war. We shall no longer breathe the same air, repose in the same Island — walk under the same hemisphere: but separation, uncertainty, and wretchedness, must ensue.</P>
<P>O dire and deadly spirit of contention—patron of carnage and encourager of bloodshed! O thou, who ragest most unnaturally in the human bosom, (where all the graces and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffections should inhabit) and settest man against man!— Thou, who hast swept a brother untimely to the grave, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t a father, a sister, and a lover, to mourn his fate — Thou whose spear seems now trembling over my panting heart, which bleeds at the dangers of the youth whom I adore — Oh, mischievous WAR! armed at all points against the happiness and humanity of the species — how v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous and how dreadful are thy horrors!— I cannot bear it H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>—</P>
<P>Yet let me think a little.—Are you not resolved? what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> I doing? labouring to unman you? Ah! forgive my inconsistency; I cannot help it —indeed I cannot. No words, no pen, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> even your <HI>own</HI>▪ my best friend, all-eloquent, all Promethean <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it is, can paint the effusions of nature as they burst from me at this a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ing moment. Consider the fate of Edward, and think of what may be your own: consider the sorrows of Louisa, and think on what may soon be those of Emma.</P>
<P>Yet what have I said—am I not satisfied with the most affectionate and in v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riable solicitude, but I must interfere with a mode of con∣duct, which, you assure me is a duty not to be laid aside without

dishonour. Alas! Henry, I am reduced, by this cruel commission of your's, to a very bitter exigence, which neither permits me to cen∣sure or approve. I dare not write any more, for I feel the ride of overwhelming softness pouring on me. Perhaps I might advise you, at this tender crisis, to—</P>
<P>No: I will not <HI>trust</HI> myself with the pen. It would sully me in your <HI>esteem,</HI> should I longer hold it. O Henry, Henry, pardon and pity me.

<HEAD>LETTER XV. TO EMMA CORBETT,</HEAD>
<P>ALAS! what is to be do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with this bleeding tenderness of your's? For Heaven sake, temper your sensibility with a little discretion, my beloved Emma. Your elegant and affecting pages penetrate me to the soul. The tears of anguish mingle with those of admiration as I read them. Yet let me implore you to strengthen <HI>your</HI> mind a little, lest you wholly debilitate <HI>mine.</HI> Let not your Henry disgrace the cause he is to defend, nor fully the profession <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e has chosen. Dear, unhappy friend, make one great and gene∣rous effort to support your drooping spirits, to sustain your wasting frame, and to preserve a life so valuable to <HI>me,</HI> that the same stroke— I cannot pursue the subject —Rouse, rouse your∣self, my Emma. For my sake, let all your fortitude be exerted. We are both young; there is the same protecting providence by water as by land; in the fields of war, as on the plains of peace. The <HI>future</HI> is a wide space, and may contain within its circle a thousand blessings. Struggle then against the storm bravely. Your inferences are too gloomy: various opportunities will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffer, doubt not, to speed our generous intercourse. The wide world of senti∣ment and sensation still opens upon us. By aid of this little friend∣ly instrument, we may range through those paths which ocean seems to separate. However remote, you should still learn to think i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a superior blessing, that, in some part of animated nature, there still exists the counterpart of Emma—congenial as dear; —one, when no circumstance can change, but who must ever remain true to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry touch of joy, and every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>embling of woe. Look, Emma, at the paltry passions, and vulgar gratifications of common life— of common lovers. Look attentively at these, and then examine your own heart—examine mine. Consider the pure nature of the affection that unites them. Does not the superiority of our attach∣ment make you generously proud? O Emma! you ought not to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wretched. We have both reason to be content.</P>
<P>Does Emma still weep? let her rather gratefully acknowledge, that though th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pure sourc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of sacred ami<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y is occasionally em∣bittered, as is, more or less, <HI>every</HI> affection of the virtuous heart; there are moments in which happiness breaks forth with a lustre that makes amends for every intervening vexation. Such was the
<PB N="15" REF="017678_0015_0FA21F150CA79408"/>
period, when I wrote those hasty lines which you have honoured with most dear praise. In striking the balance then, let us not complain, my friend; but when fretting at disappointment, or drooping under the languors of distress, let us support ourselves with the assurance, that the rich current will return after all ob∣structions, and flow sweetly and smoothly along its proper chan∣nels. Its source, my dear Emma, can never be exhausted, It is as the chrystal fountain of living water, which streams for ever, and and suffers no impurity to remain upon its surface.</P>
<P>Ah! what is there so likely to melt the spirit of a soldier into cowardice, as the tears of Emma? She will not then give way to the tender torrent. She will court the balmy blessings of ease and hope. She will check these convulsive transports of distress▪ so destructive to my honour, and her own health. She will buffet the wild waves of adversity, nor thus suffer them to overwhelm her. Consider these things, O my beloved Emma! Come then, my friend, be still yourself; repose with perfect confidence upon that faithful pillow which my affection prepares for you; seek to amuse and to solace; cease to murmur and repine.</P>
<P>Do these things, and all your generous wishes shall be rewarded —Do these things, and all shall be well. Peace shall revisit your gentle bosom, and spread her whitest plumes about your pillow.</P>

<P>IT may not be, my brother. I cannot see you in the last hours of your stay in England: I love you too dearly to support it. It is not even now, without pain, I hold the pen. My tenderness is too strong, and my constitution too weak, to bear such an inter∣view — to bear the tears of Emma, the embraces of my brother, and my own distress. Excuse me, therefore. It is true affection that persuades me to retire. I will not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>man you, nor add to the weight of Emma's sympathy. I will take my head from this weary pillow, and set out for my cottage before you come. This illegible scrawl shall be delivered by the servant whom I will leave to attend you. My wishes for you need not be repeated. You do not want to be told how much I love you. Yet I have one little request, nor will you refuse it to poor Louisa.</P>
<P>You are going to the spot where the dearest and loveliest of men— suffer me to call him so, and do not oppose the voice of party to the language of nature—lies murdered, or, if you like the term better, lies honourably slain.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXII. EMMA TO HER FATHER. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Written in her chamber, previous to the interview.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>YOU have found then, it seems, Louisa's billet, making the offer of her house this evening to Emma and to Henry. By what chance the note dropt I am ignorant. The hand of agitation is not, indeed, steady; nor can the agonized heart guard against common chances. I am not sorry that the paper, by whatever means, has got into <HI>your</HI> possession, oh, my dear father! It takes some part of the load from my bosom; for I am hurt to appear plotting that, which will so thoroughly bear explanation. You desire Mr. Hammond to visit me no more. He obeys. You request that I would, without enquiring into reasons, forbear to speak of him to you. I am obedient. You desired that my utmost interest might be tried, to keep him from America. O, you can conjecture how <HI>readily,</HI> and, as you know Henry's darling passion, you may guess how <HI>vainly,</HI> I undertook this. The double pleasure of obli∣ging you, my father, and of gratifying my own fond heart, pre∣vailed with me to urge this point, till I had well nigh turned his affection to disgust You bid me cease to love, and with the utmost ingenuousness I tell you it is impossible — Impossible, my dear father, because repugnant to every principle by which all the actions of my life have been governed.</P>
<P>My regard — oh! that is too cold a word — my <HI>love,</HI> for Henry, is not, you know, the start of a moment, the romantic sally of a warm temper, nor the effect of that silly admiration, which pays down the tribute of folly to the charms of a red coat. I secretly grieve that the profession of arms should have been chosen: I have shed too many tears to the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mory of my <HI>brother,</HI> to be in love with regimentals: but my tenderness was antecedent to all these misfor∣tunes; nor will it be in the power of any misfortune to diminish what your judgement, and the eloquence of my own heart, have so long approved. Your present avowed displeasure against Mr. Ham∣mond is sudden; but settled affection cannot readily accomodate itself to such revolutions. What is rooted in nature cannot, with∣out much labour, be eradicated by art. As it displeases you, Sir, I am concerned at this. But shall I deceive, in order to make my peace? shall I be <HI>unnatural,</HI> in order to be <HI>filial?</HI> Shall I propensely set one great duty against another, and so destroy the excellence of
<PB N="19" REF="017678_0019_0FA21F1786FD8148"/>
both? No. You would hate me for it, and I should hate myself. That I am in this bitter period, when I am about to lose what you yourself so lately thought most precious, able to write with so much argumentative composure, is, alas! no sign of my indifference, but an instance — perhaps the strongest that could be given — of that steady attachment, which, born of honour, is nourished by virtue. To be <HI>attached,</HI> is the dictate of nature. To be attached to a man of <HI>sense</HI> and <HI>morals,</HI> is the dictate of delicacy; and the symptom, I conceive, of a good disposition. Such, my most honoured father, were the elementary rules I caught from you. Would you controvert your own maxims? Or, while the merit of the object increases, is it a fit time to withdraw from it the love, which nature and common sense seem to say should increase in proportion?</P>
<P>But you depend, I find, on the lenitives of absence, and of time. I will not answer for the vigour of my own mind, for I know the frail<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of our nature. If it is soothing to my father to count upon what these things <HI>may</HI> do, let me not destroy his source of ex∣pectation. I am not, thanks to <HI>his</HI> corrected culture, enough the giddy girl to burst forth into asseverations of <HI>constancy everlasting,</HI> merely to vex a parent by <HI>setting my heart</HI> against his wishes: I would desire rather to distrust my own temper; and, laying my af∣fections open to his view, beg him to form his judgment upon a sur∣vey of them.—But I dare not mislead one who hath so entire a right to be treated frankly. I make no vows; yet, in proportion as an attach∣ment is deliberate, is it not fixed and permanent? And this being my first and only affection, (having besides a man of unblemished character and congenial manners for its object) have I not a right strongly to suspect—But enjoy the opinion you so strongly adopt. Bless you, my father, for the gentleness of your inhibitions. You do not threaten — You do not rave. These might have augmented my distress, but could not have abated my affection. A circum∣stance of which parents seem so unconscious, that they destroy the effect of authority by the vehemence with which they exert it. They confuse, but do not convince: terrify, but do not conciliate; and almost justify disobedience, by their manner of enforcing duty.</P>

An ingenuous nature appeals to you for pity, Sir — will you refuse? Oh, my father, my father, my spirits have done their utmost, ere the trial is begun. Suffer me to be unhappy. —Prepare for me — oh! prepare for me the parental hand against my return, and do not let <HI>my</HI> tenderness abate <HI>your's.</HI></P>

Follow your design of making my house your's, till you go into the country, and then many occasions will present themselves of discovering that merit which, I am sure, the generous Emma will not be able to resist.

You well know, in what manner I shall employ the interval; it shall be dedicated to softness and to Emma.

I pressed it with fervent and chaste ardour to my lips and to my bosom — I laid it soft and close upon the panting heart, and am relieved — as much so, my Emma, as I ought to be, or as is consistent with hu∣man nature at this crisis. Oh, my dear friend, it is indeed a pa∣thetic period. I now feel that I had set myself too hard a task.

<P>WHAT a return have you made for the trifle I sent you, O, most dear and ingenious friend I ever directing the current of that rich stream (which knows no diminution, but scatters fer∣tility and fragrance as it flows) to comfort, to amuse, or to instruct me▪ How I rejoice, that the bagatelle pleased you. It was my first intention to have the hair disposed into an ornament for the shirt, but I considered the nature of that delicate sentiment you feel for Emma. I reflected that it was <HI>retired,</HI> that it shunned every thing obtrusive, that it could ill brook the idle, and perhaps the wanton curiosity of those cockaded heroes, who imagine tenderness incompatible with bravery. On these accounts, therefore, I chose to suit my locket to <HI>that</HI> situation only in which your delicate par∣tiality would be most likely to place it.</P>
<P>Round your neck, my dear Henry, let it ever hang, impervious to every eye but that of the proprietor. — A sacred calisman may it prove — a soft shield thrown over your bosom by the trembling hand of a friend! —O, that I could breathe upon it all the virtues that were supposed to be in possession of the most benevolent geoii — that it had strength of charm sufficient to preserve you as securely from sickness, sorrow, and mischance, — from the bullet and the sword, — as I do firmly believe the sight and touch of it will arm your heart against the impression of every error, and the practice of every irregularity.</P>
<P>Your letter, with its fair and tuneful inclosure, found me upon my pillow, from which I hastened with a rapidity which is the spontaneous impulse of unaffected tenderness. Like a much-wished-fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and much-wanted cordial▪ it found me in an affecting moment. I read and recovered, wept and was well Oh, wondrous power of virtuous affection! Yes, thou admirable and honourable friend, the die is cast, thy invaluable love shall be the sustaining solace of my future existence. Ah! may no jarring word or discordant thought ever rise up to disturb an amity so sacred and so pure! The fine spirit of our esteem, my Henry, shall extend its delicate influ∣ence over all the rougher passages, on a sea far more stormy than that whose bosom is now pressed by your vessel — Over every trou∣bled moment our affection shall softly diffuse itself,
<Q><PB N="26" REF="017678_0026_0FA21F1CEC7AA478"/>
<L>"Like the sweet breezes of the South,</L>
<L>"Stealing and giving odour."</L></Q>
Oh, Henry, my heart dilates as I write and the soft drops descend in a pathetic and sweet assurance of our future felicity; but do not be uneasy that I weep,—such tears will not hurt me. They are pre∣cious drops that invigorate virtue, and freshen as they fall. Oh! those sacred hours we have passed together, in friendship, in con∣verse, in books; no divided attention, thought saluting thought, the mutual tear, every thing, or dear or elegant, included in every moment. Carry the remembrance of such intercourse over the world of waters. Call to mind the time when our lengthened at∣tention to the moral page, instead of relaxing, grew stronger and more fixed; when our understandings and our hearts seemed equally to refine and to expand!</P>
<P>Yes, Henry, I will try to adopt that gentle spirit of prophecy, which breathes so beautiful an ardour over your consolatory pages. I do not <HI>expect</HI> to gather the bloom of the rose, without feeling the puncture of the surrounding thorn. I gratefully take it with all its little wounding appendages—I place it in my bosom.</P>
<P>—I have promised not to repine: yet, if a gentle murmur some∣times escapes, let me, I prithee, find indulgence for it, and do not chide me; oh, how often have I wished since your departure, to be the companion of your voyage and all its consequences, how∣ever multiplied, however menacing! And, after all, Henry, your situation is more tolerable than mine: the travelling friend has the advantage of those who are left, in solitude, behind. The very velocity of the motion is favourable: in passing rapidly along, the freshness of the air, and the change of objects, engage and divert the mind insensibly; while the poor forlorn one, that remains fixed to the former spot, has only to mark the present period, to look in vain around for what is lost, to cast a "longing, lingering eye" upon the past, and, in the torture of reflection, to confess that such things <HI>were,</HI>—but <HI>are,</HI> alas! no more.</P>
<P>It has been my fortune to pass thro' the street where you resided, more than once since your departure. O, think with what emotions I viewed those windows which belonged to an apartment so lately your's! The sight of your <HI>grave</HI> could scarcely have produced any thing more affecting: and yet I feel that I shall like to pass often by them. I do not pretend to <HI>account</HI> for these little touches, I only simply <HI>relate</HI> them. Will not your feeling nature easily explain them?</P>
<P>And now confess, Hammond, that I have arrived at the due degree of heroism: confess, that I am sufficiently <HI>soldier'd</HI>; for I can hold the pen, and impress the quiet-seeming sentiment, with my eyes full of tears▪ and my heart full of sorrow. What more can you expect from female philosophy? What more can you expect from a friend who has been used to regret the absence of an hour as a misfortune?</P>
<P>I shall send off this, on the slight chance of its reaching you. If
<PB N="27" REF="017678_0027_0FA21F1D72F46F00"/>
it should not—what then? what will be its fate?—I care not. Gross as is the world, were every sentiment of my soul laid open to its view, I could support the scrutiny. I still could "<HI>boast</HI> the grace∣ful weakness," if indeed it be a weakness of my heart.

<P><HI>MY</HI> brother and <HI>your</HI> friend, then, is gone! How fares it with you, my dear Emma? Are the conflicting pangs of a parting so poignant some-what subsided, the tender spirits some-what com∣posed, the fluttered, agitated heart more still? I ask you these questions in the bosom of my retreat. I date from my sanctuary, where my widowed heart (for <HI>that</HI> has been long wedded) is retired to muse upon the dead. Of the living, you, one other person, and Henry, are the only objects of my case. For your welfare, and for your

distress, I can yet feel, and while you remain in it, the world will have something that ties me to it—the rest is Edward's.</P>
<P>Fifteen months of desperation are gone by, my friend, and five more have followed those, less clamorous, but more deep. The frenzy of my soul is succeeded by the still small sigh, and silent tear of settled sorrow. It is not now the <HI>passion</HI> but the <HI>principle</HI> of grief. Here I sit under the dark umbrage of these sepulchral bows — ah shade most sacred! and invoke piety to consecrate my grief.—She comes—she comes, my Emma!</P>
<P>—Amidst the modest shadings of the evening, I behold her celes∣tial form descending on a moon-beam. Even now she diffuses a holy melancholy into my heart.—She fits me for the contemplations that are most dear.—She utters the name of EDWARD in tunes of Heavenly eloquence—she touche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the tender strain—she echoes the pensive sign in softest cadence, and increases the stream of woe with cherub drops of sympathy. The lovely enthusiasm is complete!</P>
<P>It is now twilight, my Emma; the but is taking its circles in the ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and poor Fidelio is sleeping at my feet — I use the day's last moment to write, supporting the paper on my lap.—The owl, which shrinks from sunshine, has left his ivy, and flits by me.— The village bell is toiling —This night departed the soul of a WIDOW!—It is the <HI>passing</HI> bell, then, that I hear!—Oh! Heavens!</P>
<P>Alass, I meant to comfort you, and I shall infect you with my gloom.</P>
<P>—The present pensive sweets be mine.— Adieu!—I lay down the pen till I can use it to a more soothing purpose.</P>
<P>In continuation.</P>
<P>It is particularly unlucky, Emma, for you, that I should have contracted this sequestered habit, when my soothing cares might be so particularly acceptable to my friend.— Yet, in the present situ∣ation of her heart, all attuned as it is to <HI>gentle</HI> emotions, I am much inclined to ask her society.</P>
<P>The retreat is tender: the weather is fair. Close upon my cot, Simplicity seems to have fixed her seat of "dearest residence." She has sequestered herself in a bow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r of shrubs, at whose roots rambles the fertilizing till. My shades are formed to receive and to em∣brace the gentle spirit of acquiescence. Reposed in the thickest foliage. The saintly form of Melancholy also is there, listening to the plaint of the stock-dove, and to the soft gradations of the water-fall. Is not this an asylum for the <HI>heart</HI> of Emma? Even Louisa (ah, how pre-eminently wretched!—) finds some consola∣tion amongst these pensive sweets of nature in her solitudes—soli∣tudes, my friend, not to <HI>annihilate</HI> but to <HI>compose,</HI> not to <HI>extinguish</HI> the generous flame, but to <HI>attemper</HI> it. Ah, come then— come to the woman who esteems you.—Come to the sister of Henry, —come to the mourner of Edward! retirement is the norse of love. 'Tis "hereabouts she dwells." Virtuous affection is blooming here amidst rose<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Friendship, (ah, surely I might say KINDRED

friendship) in the form of your Louisa, attends. What, of soft, of sacred, of serene, is there <HI>wanting</HI> to invite you? <HI>Here,</HI> as far∣ther removed from the tumults of busy life, you will be drawn more near to Henry. Directing the "mind's eye" only towards <HI>him,</HI> you will seem to approximate almost all of life that is most pre∣cious to us both. The pure air itself will assist. The softness of morn, and the serenity of eve, will be alike auspicious—the sign will become more soft—the violent agitations will subside—the tempestuous passions will sink into a delicate calm, like the smooth sea "when not a breath of wind blows o'er the surface."</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIV. TO F. BERKLEY, <HI>Esq.</HI></HEAD>
<P>FREDERICK, he is set off; but I have no reason to imagine his embarkation a good omen. As far as the <HI>father's</HI> interest goes, I am safe, but <HI>that</HI> does not go very far. To tell you the truth, I am <HI>myself</HI> somewhat an odd kind of a fellow in this re∣spect. I should not choose to accept an alienated or reluctant hand. Nor could I sit quiet under the idea of possessing a woman, who gave her person as an equivalent for a title and a fortune. These niceties, you will say, are, at my age, somewhat <HI>out of date</HI>; and I ought not to <HI>expect</HI> such etiquettes will be attended to by a fine young woman, whom, perhaps, you imagine, I might jump at on <HI>any</HI> terms. Look'y' Frederick, leave me to settle my own singu∣larities, and do you settle your's. I think fit, for old acquaintance sake, to unbosom to you a very foolish secret. The least you can do is to hear my story, and to let me tell it my own way. I am now in love "<HI>nolens volens.</HI>" You may laugh, but I <HI>feel</HI> it is not in my power to extricate myself. Would the wench had not fallen in my way! <HI>These</HI> are what I call cross incidents. When a man is jogging on, and has got soberly to the resting place, <HI>then</HI> to have a slap on the shoulder from such an urchin as Cupid, <HI>then</HI> to be attacked bow and arrow in hand—Is not this too bad—Is not this too ridiculous—too humiliating?</P>
<P>After you have uttered the sarcastic <HI>yes,</HI> I shall proceed to ac∣quaint you, that this mighty ridiculous thing is the most <HI>serious tor∣ment</HI>: and what renders it the more perplexing is, that, old fellow as I am, it is a circumstance wholly <HI>new</HI> to me—not more so to the veriest stripling when he wafts from him the maiden sighs for a tripping chit of fifteen. I am not in my dotage, <HI>am</HI> I, Berkley, at forty-three? No, hang it; that is not what they call being well-stricken—<HI>is</HI> it? I have some terms to keep with <HI>myself</HI> too. I should not <HI>choose</HI> to be <HI>too</HI> absurd.</P>
<P>But this young adventurer! This happy hero! The parts of his character that I have been able to pick up—such as health, agreeableness, genius, spirit, courage, and animation, are not absolutely in my favour, are they, Frederick?</P>
<P>Let us see what <HI>I</HI> have got to put in the balance <HI>against</HI> them. — the gout— small-pox pits—not the ninetieth part of a muse—less courage than caution, and spirits somewhat harrassed out in the real wear and tear of worldly events. I don't like it, Frederick.— It won't do. My lighter scale is hurled aloof, and I am bouncing my head against the beam most abominably. O Frederick!</P>
<P>Is there, then, nothing to throw in by way of bringing a middle aged gentleman on the equilibrium? Yes: A lusty lump of <HI>money.</HI> The <HI>golden make weight</HI> of fifty thousand pounds. Fair force of <HI>metal,</HI> Frederick! Our cockaded spark has not any thing to poise <HI>that,</HI> in the opinion of the world; and yet, if this should happen to be <HI>Emma's</HI> opinion. I am so whimsical a mortal, that I should esteem her <HI>less</HI> for the very circumstance which would make
<PB N="33" REF="017678_0033_0FA21F2372AC2B00"/>
my sait <HI>more successful.</HI> The fortune of Henry Hammond, I find, is small. He has <HI>not</HI> much money, but he has what does a thousand times more execution in a delicate bosom: he has <HI>sentiment.</HI> O that cursed <HI>sentiment</HI>! — a term, Frederick, of late invention, to express old emotions in a new way — a term, which many use, more affect, few understand, and still fewer feel, — a term, which — which — in short — curse that sentiment!</P>

<HEAD>Letter XXXV. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>I SAID I would tell you how we deceive ourselves. I will. The <HI>slender circumstances,</HI> and even the <HI>great misfortunes</HI> of a lover, are no kind of objection in the eyes of a <HI>sentimental mistress</HI>; em∣barrassments of the world call forth the siner sentiments, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se excite sympathy. Now <HI>sympathy,</HI> Frederick, is, in the female breast, a very tender sensation. It is a strange thing, but a true, that this same adorable SENTIMENT has ever had (with indeed very few exceptions) a most sore quarrel with solid silver and gold; and with the coin current of a country. In the account of young <HI>English</HI> women (who are the greatest worshippers of the fair idol) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t really circulates as mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t <HI>sterling</HI>; and the prevailing charms of a pathetic, poetical poverty is a more welcome draft to them, than any which mere <HI>matter-of fact wealth</HI> could draw upon his banker. Thus it is, that fathers sacrifice to Plutus, and children (especially daugh∣ters) to a beggarly Deity, whom Plutus laughs to scorn: and hence the source of ten thousand family feuds — hence the rise of separate maintenance; and the fall of domestic confidence. Sentimental Love is torn almost to ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ers in his way to the altar; and when, in this effort, his robe is <HI>most</HI> ragged, <HI>then</HI> is his gl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry the <HI>most distinguished</HI>; for thus b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ggarly as he i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, he shall laugh at the labours of a <HI>rich</HI> passion, and as he passes, poverty-struck (as it should seem) through files of females, he will flaunt his famine in your face, and <HI>sentimentally</HI> tell you, it is his <HI>letter of recommenda∣tion.</HI> And all this, Frederick, while plain affection (in a snuff-coloured coat for instance) throws in <HI>vain</HI> the massy money bag, across his shoulders, and seeks Hymen's temple by the path that is obvious and unentangled. Now a days, the broad highway is de∣serted; and the women rather <HI>choose</HI> to stick those roses in their bosom that are encompassed by <HI>thorns,</HI> than accept the richest <HI>bouquet,</HI> in the garden that lies open to the view, ready to the hand, and that may be collected without any difficulty.</P>
<P><HI>Difficulty!</HI> there it is again. That is <HI>another</HI> cursed thing which enters into the spirit of a modern attachment! It is the first cousin of sentiment, or, as I have heard, its parent. A sly old neighbour of mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, who has look'd shrewdly and silently at human nature, and whom I, sometimes, used to consult on that subject, tells me, that <HI>difficulty</HI> is the happiest thing in the world to sentimental lovers. I
<PB N="34" REF="017678_0034_0FA21F255B8787F8"/>
hinted to my friend in reply to this, that <HI>I</HI> then might consider my age, my dark complexion, my wig, and my fair round body, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s so many points in my <HI>favour,</HI> since they would, no doubt, throw a respectable quantity of the aforesaid <HI>difficulty</HI> in the way of my <HI>wishes,</HI> meaning my overtures to Emma Corbett. Aye, quoth my friend—but they are not the right <HI>sort</HI> of difficulties. There are, continued he, difficulties which <HI>impede</HI> and difficulties which <HI>ad∣vance.</HI> Of the <HI>former,</HI> your's, Sir Robert, happen to be the most substantia], to which you might have added many more that have the kindness to attend you. Of the <HI>latter,</HI> you, Sir Robert, to my recollection, have not one: for you are too rich to experi∣ence an objection on the side of cash, which, by incurring the con∣tempt of the father, might possibly recommend you to the child — You are too sleek and too plump, to make a young lady mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>take your countenance for the seat of sentiment, and there is so terrible an air of <HI>plenty</HI> all over you, that you are, in my opinion, an un∣wise Baronet to address any thing but one of those <HI>prudent</HI> young ladies, which, in a matrimonial bargain, cling to the <HI>solid</HI> com∣forts, and will not like you the <HI>worse</HI> for being so abundantly pro∣vided with the goods of this life — But to attempt a woman of <HI>sen∣timent,</HI> an ATTACHED woman of sentiment, the mistress of a young <HI>soldier,</HI> who loves a man of <HI>poverty</HI> — a man of <HI>poetry</HI> — and, to crown all, who loves a man that is not the <HI>present choice of her fa∣ther</HI>— Alas, poor Sir Robert! you may think yourself well off, if she does not conceive towards you, a generous kind of aversion, and order you to assume a genteel size, to wear your own hair, and to adopt the melting mood before she suffers a second visit.</P>
<P>Thus spake my friend—and I don't know what to think of his doctrine Give her up, I positively cannot — Gain her is not a lit∣tle improbable. Yet I have met her several times since my arrival, and she has not yet ordered me to assume a genteel size, nor to wear my own hair. I design to make some little alterations in the <HI>head∣way,</HI> 'tis true, but this is more in frolic than seriousness: for I love to adopt little drolleries. They belong to my temper, and have accompanied me to a very good end, through life—which, I really find, requires many little lifts to go pleasantly through.</P>
<P>It is on this account, Frederick, that I regret having seen the fair Emma Corbett. My partiality is not, I find, such a one as I can accomodate to my old habit of quaint jocularity. It has a little jarred the harmony of my little system already, I do not enjoy the passing scene quite so care-free—and why shou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d I disguise any thing from Frederick Berkley?— I feel an earnest desire to touch the <HI>heart</HI> of this girl <HI>so,</HI> that I should be as necessary to her felicity as she is to mine; and the fear of not being able to accomplish this makes me, at times, most peculiarly miserable. Thank discre∣tion, however, she knows, as yet▪ nothing of the matter; and I shall have the advantage soon of being under the same roof. I could treat her with great tenderness: indeed I could, Frederick.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="017678_0035_0FA21F27F795B0C8"/>Before I quite accede to the invitation —though I have written to Corbett—I will consider about it; and shall be glad to hear from you, in the mean time. But you need not write any of your objec∣tions to my pursuit, lest you inspire me with a love of <HI>difficulty,</HI> and I should, like a sentimental Lover, exert myself to oppose them, in proportion as they appear insurmountable. But you may send my word I am engaged in a hazardous undertaking, <HI>not doubting my success,</HI> if you please.</P>

I have not been al∣lowed breathing time since the news of Henry's embark∣ation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ached me. It seems now the great point of my father to disl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, entirely, all traces of Mr. Hammond. A father's <HI>heart</HI> engages in this endeavour; and though I know it to be hopel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss, I forbear to disturb his plan by unavailing contest, and am passive to the projects which surround (ah, how vainly!) the <HI>honourable affection</HI> of my bosom. The <HI>acute</HI> pang, my friend, <HI>is</HI> subsided, but my affection is only the more fixed upon that account. All places being now pretty much alike, I suffer myself to be drawn about from one silly circle to another. Yet how should my father thus mistake my temper? This affection is no impromptu—No en∣thusiastic flight of f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lly, fancy, or of p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssion. It has been the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>w, progressive course of various combining and irresistible circumstan∣ces — circumstances, which, unfolding themselves trait by trait, have discovered to me the merit of a most amiable character; and, on the basis of experience, fixed me to it beyond all possibility of change. So very complex, peculiar, and precious, Louisa, has been every movement in the series of events which have contribu∣ted to cement and fasten the faith — the HOLY faith, established between Emma and your brother, that, though no particular pre∣destinarian, nor easily yielding to the wild images of superstition, I am strongly inclined to think — and <HI>there</HI> is my hope — that something more powerful than the more random agency of chance, <HI>must</HI> have interfered. I am not of the light or fickle tribe: nor am I tumultuous. Extreme violence I dread. That pathetic so∣briety which is separated on the one hand from the darkness of despair; and, on the other, from the perilous furor of extacy, (if I at all know myself) discriminates my character. To the fortunes of Mr. Hammond, I am tied by those fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e bonds of sympathy, upon which time and chance can have no influence. Wherefore, then, sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld I not give way to the generous instinct? You have often heard me say, that I respect and venerate every rule which reason has pre∣scribe, to render female conduct correctly amiable; and to preserve that beauteous decorum, without whose graces woman is both des∣picable and wretched. But does reason bid us withold the miti∣gating balm which is given us to heal the wounds of life? No, my friend Your own hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, virtuously attached to the memory of a most lovely, and most lamented youth, will plead in my behalf, and

<P>To delicacy I grant much. To custom <HI>all</HI> which she <HI>ought</HI> to expect. But to <HI>nature,</HI> chastened and regulated by <HI>real virtue,</HI> I devote my heart. In devoting it to them, I dedicate it to Henry; and it is with equal pride and pleasure I am able to inform the sister of my dear Hammond, that, such has been the delicacy of his man∣ners, so uniformly pure hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sentiments, his tenderness so adorned by dignity, so becoming a <HI>man to offer,</HI> and a <HI>woman to accept,</HI>— ardent yet steady, and soft yet brigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,—that I do not recoll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct one word, either spoken or written, which <HI>dying,</HI> I could wish to blot from the tablature of my memory.

She will answer me <HI>herself,</HI> when I venture to refer to her. But I want to know whether <HI>you,</HI> as her father, have given him, at parting, any mark of approba∣tion.

paltry piece of <HI>titleship,</HI> and so, in the end, become the object of de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ision to a whole family. I understand tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, during my long resi∣dence abroad, this Hammond was under your guardianship; that he lived with you and Emma some years in the very house called Castle∣berry, which I have purchased of you; that <HI>there</HI> the young man was countenanced by you, and his addressess to your daughter <HI>not disapproved.</HI> N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w, as I do not hear of his having done any thing to <HI>forfeit</HI> your affections, I cannot conceive why you have, as you say, "resolved against him."</P>
<P>To be ingenuous, I am afraid you think <HI>I</HI> am a BETTER <HI>match.</HI> Look'y' Charles, I am no hero, but an honest man, and you shall not break your word, (as many a <HI>very</HI> honest man <HI>has</HI> done) in compliance with certain rigorous circumstances —Let us talk like old friends, newly met.</P>
<P>On my leaving England, <HI>I</HI> was <HI>poor, you</HI> were <HI>rich.</HI> In the roll of human affairs, perhaps, now that <HI>I</HI> am returned rich, <HI>you</HI> may be, comparatively, poor,— that is, you may have some wise scheme to carry, and cannot well bring it about. I can no otherway ac∣count for this sudden change in disfavour of Hammond—for you used to be fixed in your opinions—than that, impelled to an altera∣tion by distressing incidents, you,—In short, is there any hard part in your situation, which you imagine an alliance with me might remove? and, <HI>but</HI> for this, would not Hammond be as much the object of <HI>your</HI> choice as he is that of your daughter?</P>
<P>Corbett, speak plain. What cash do you want? Let not your necessities violate your engagements. Condescend to be a borrower where you may so safely rely upon your lender; and where, by con∣tracting a debt, you may confer an obligation. To plead for a rival would be unnatural — but to save a friend from error, and myself from disgrace, is not amiss.</P>
<P>An old and intimate friend of your's happened to step in, just as I was directing my servant to carry my luggage to your house, Your name was no sooner mentioned, than he exclaimed — "Poor Corbett, how miserable must he be at the departure of young Hammond, who is betrothed to his daughter Emma!

<HEAD>LETTER XLI. TO Sir ROBERT RAYMOND.</HEAD>
<P>YOU force me in to a very unwelcome explanation. Unwel∣come, because <HI>precipitate</HI>; and which I designed to have opened at a proper opportunity, in the hour of confidence: however, as the circumstance is thus hastened on, I must suit myself to it.</P>
<P>I am not by any means so rich as I was at your departure from this country for India: yet I am too rich— and should think myself so had I only one guinea upon the earth— to marry Emma to <HI>your</HI> fortune to mend <HI>mine.</HI> I did love Hammond, even with a father's love, and in a legal sense to <HI>be</HI> his father was my favourite inten∣tion. Yet that idea is now, of <HI>all</HI> others, the farthest from my mind, and never CAN be revived. It is a little hard that you have got me into such an exigence as to make it impossible for me, with any credit, to keep the great secret of my life.</P>
<P>Henry Hammond is, against all advice, and persuasion, violently attached to those cruel <HI>spoilers,</HI> who have gone sword in hand into the bowels of a country, where my dear son has fallen a victim— a country which is most barbarously butchered, and to whose well∣fare I am bound by ties the most tender and interesting. I would reject <HI>you,</HI> I would reject an EMPEROR that should pretend to the hand of Emma, and yet sacrilegiously pollute his <HI>own</HI> hand, in the life-blood of AMERICA. Oh, thou hapless land! thou art precious to me beyond the breath which I am now drawing!—beyond every hope that I can form on this side Heaven!—beyond my daughter— yes even beyond Emma, because thou art equally the object of my love, and more of my <HI>pity!</HI> The rapacious HENRY is gone to plunge another p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ignard in thy bosom!—the bosom of my country — the tomb of Emma's brother, and the vault of every generous affection. Nature herself lies bleeding on thy shore, and <HI>there</HI> the inhuman mother has plunged the dagger (with her own barbarous hand) into the bowels of her child!—</P>
<P>But oh the deep and tremendous restitutions are at bond; I see them, with a prophetic eye, this moment before me. Horrors shall be re-paid with <HI>accumulation</HI> of horror. The wounds in America shall be succeeded by deep mouthed gashes in the heart of Britain! The chain of solemn consequences <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ances. Yet, yet, my friend, a little while, and the poor forlorn one who has fought and fallen at the gate of her proper habitation, for freedom—for the common privileges of life — for all the sweet and binding principles in hu∣manity —for father, son, and brother—for the cradled infant, the wailing widow, and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> weeping maid —Yet, yet a little while, and she shall find an avenger Indignant nations shall arm in her defence.—Thrones and dominions shall make <HI>her</HI> cause their own, and the fountains of blood which have run from her exhausted veins, shall be answered by a yet fuller measure of the horrible ef∣fusion.

<P><PB N="40" REF="017678_0040_0FA21F2BC65E91C8"/>You remember it was amongst my first questions that I desired to know <HI>your</HI> opinion of the war? I received the answer which soothed my heart, and it was not till after that moment, I suffered my full tide of antient tenderness again to flow.</P>
<P>To <HI>Henry</HI> I break <HI>no</HI> promise —Emma's attachment, I think, may be <HI>subdued</HI> by gentle means. O, if she still unites her heart (even her secret heart) to that <HI>volunteer</HI> murderer, these silver hairs shall descend in sudden sorrow to the grave. But indeed, I do not apprehend it.

<HEAD>LETTER XLII. TO C. CORBETT, <HI>Esq.</HI></HEAD>
<P>YOU astonish me. I imagined <HI>you</HI> were, like <HI>myself,</HI> a citizen of the earth, and of no particular party. For my own part, I have <HI>travelled</HI> away all enthusiasm of the sort you mention. There is indeed, something like a natural affection, which one bears to the place of one's nativity; because, <HI>there</HI> our b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ings were first linked to the chain of society—there first shot up our ideas — there grew our connections, our affections, our hopes, and our wishes, —there our little loves were first formed, and our little wants first accommodated. It is upon these accounts that I am more happy to contemplate the scenes of England than those of India — that I rate more highly my <HI>own</HI> than I do a <HI>fo∣reign</HI> language — that I look with fondest partiality at the spot (which is marked in everlasting traces on the memory) devoted to the pastimes of my infancy, and that I continue some sort of grateful tenderness for the very <HI>trees</HI>▪ whose shades so often soothed me in the summer of my childhood. My predilection for my na∣tive country, friend Corbett, "hath this extent— no more." It has been my fate to travel — I had almost said — wherever Euro∣peans are dispersed. I have travelled too, where civil society hath yet made no progress, but I have <HI>never</HI> travelled (and oh <HI>may</HI> I never) where the "human face divine" did not meet my eye. However varied by colour, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, and by feature, I saw enough to discover my <HI>kind,</HI> and to acknowledege i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. I disputed not about the white or black, the tawny or the yellow; nor about the diffe∣rent mixture, shade, or distinction of these. — I saw beings of the same erect form — I saw MY SPECIES; and in this very serious moment I declare to you, that I felt attachment to the general figures of men and women, wherever I beheld them, even before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w any thing of their particular dispositions.

between one state and another. In passing through a variety of countries, and seeing them <HI>all,</HI> either <HI>engaging, preparing</HI> to engage, or healing the wounds of an engagement <HI>past,</HI> I began to think the passion for honourable death (i. e. cutting throats and lopping limbs for subsistence or for glory, for pride or pique) was universally peculiar to these ages of iron and steel; till, devoting a cool hour to examine the map of the world, and perceiving that, from the creation (or very soon after) even unto this day, to shed blood in this manner has been the <HI>constant practice,</HI> I gave up the idea of calling my fellow-creatures particularly cruel or sanguinary upon this account, and <HI>deplored</HI> a custom which I could not <HI>approve.</HI> Yet, in every army are characters to be loved; and the human affections spread themselves, more or less, over every clime. In considering the <HI>causes</HI> of wars, between different proportions of the same species, (of whom numbers without number have been s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain) I have found them so wretchedly inadequate to the horrible <HI>effects,</HI> that I have often melted into tears, but never have been inflamed with anger. Tens of thousands, my friend, have been sacrificed to the frown of a favourite, the whim of a prince, or the smile of a prostitute. The <HI>occasions</HI> are contemptible, but the <HI>event</HI> is murder. What can a good natured man do, but commiserate the abuse of power, and the madness of ambition? In point of <HI>propriety,</HI> there is seldom a pin to choose on either side; and even when it is Justice herself that draws the sword, and heads the phalanx, the blood of many an innocent is shed in the contest; and in the warmest mo∣ment of success, while victory is enjoying her jubilee, — if all the milk of human kindness were not drained out of the hero's bosom —there is a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> much cause for him to sorrow, as to rejoice. Oh Mr. Corbett, were he to retire <HI>after</HI> the shout of acclamation to some quiet solitude, and there think on the means by which the conquest has been gained — were he to consider, that heaps of his <HI>countrymen</HI> as well as of the <HI>enemy (all</HI> of whom were human beings) lie cut to pieces upon the plain — while <HI>another</HI> heap, yet more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be regretted, are groaning in hospitals — would not the laurel wi∣ther on his brow? would not the sense of rapture be checked, sym∣pathy stream from his eye, and re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ling horror freeze up the blood about his heart? Such are my opinions. I caught them, my friend, from the fountain head of a most touching <HI>experience.</HI> They flowed immediately from the <HI>wounds</HI> of my fellow creatures. Ap∣pointed to the office of surgeon, at a time of <HI>war,</HI> in the earlier part of my life, it was the fortune of our ship more than once to feel the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hocks of public hostility. I had so much business upon my <HI>hands</HI> that it was almost too much for my <HI>heart.</HI> At the conclusion of the voyage, an opportunity offered to quit my cruel station, and I readily embraced it. Since that time I have kept myself unen∣gaged from scenes for which nature did not form me: and I am not of any party. I detest war, and the <HI>thoughts</HI> of war, but I sin∣cerely wish well to every human creature. That England is at va∣riance with her colonies is unhappy. In both countries I have
<PB N="42" REF="017678_0042_0FA21F2D4DCCC6A0"/>
friends who are dear to me. In both I have property. But I dare not lean either way, lest I should unsettle that system of <HI>general loving kindness,</HI> which, for a great while, has been the basis of my happiness. I assiduously avoid political conversation; and it is a certain prudence in <HI>your</HI> conduct (which seldom suffers you to men∣tion these things) that makes me so pleased, my dear Corbett, with your society. I am now too far advanced in life to begin the cares of a <HI>partizan,</HI> but as I have some <HI>feelings,</HI> I cut out some more <HI>con∣genial</HI> employment for them. I love my jest. I love my friend. I love you; and I love your daughter. Your ardent principles now convince me, that an alliance with Hammond would be to unite fire with fire; I will therefore try, for her father's sake, and for mine, how far Emma may be brought to like a <HI>man of peace.</HI> I have only to desire that you will consider me as one who remains <HI>neuter</HI> upon the same principle that <HI>you</HI> take a <HI>fide</HI> viz. because I <HI>think</HI> it is <HI>right,</HI> and because I <HI>feel</HI> it to be <HI>happy.</HI> This condition observed, our ancient friendship will stand firm, and I shall ever be,</P>

For my own part, I <HI>cannot</HI> remain neuter. My soul is on fire — I breathe generous vengeance against barbarous Britain: I own it; and, could I move this lacerated body out of England without immediate peril of a life on which my Emma has a claim, I would not continue in a soil so accursed. We now know each other's opinion, and the subject disor∣ders me so much when it is brought forward, that I most readily ac∣quiesce in your wishes to drop it for ever.

<HEAD>LETTER XLIV. TO LOUISA HAMMOND.</HEAD>
<P><HI>YOU</HI> alarm and check my curiosity in the same moment, Oh, beautiful unfortunate! Yet is it not a little hard to have any con∣cealments with the sister of Edward, and the avowed admirer of Henry? Particular circumstances, however, justify what, in general ones, would be a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> unkindness; and these, I am convinced, <HI>sanctify</HI> the silence of Louisa. Sacred and embosomed, beyond the reach of any participation, be all that you desire to keep so. I wait, in patient tenderness, the moment of fuller confidence; and till that arrives, will only assure you that I am connected with every turn of your life, and with every stroke of your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ but will suffer myself to make no more the premature enquiry.

<PB N="43" REF="017678_0043_0FA21F2DFB8AB4D0"/>
the welfare of Emma; whose chief pleasure on this side the separating sea, consists in the correspondence which she maintains with Louisa.</P>
<P>After several days of tedious revelry, the <HI>hurry</HI> into which my heart hath been precipitated somewhat subsides. We have left the smoke of London, and got into a s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rener system. The house of a very <HI>old friend</HI> of my father's, lately landed from India, is now our residence, and it was once the residence of Emma and of Henry; for it is that very <HI>Castle∣berry</HI> where my father (who has since sold it to the present proprietor) had used to pass with his select friends, some months of every summer. Since his American misfortunes—O, pardon me the mention of them! he detests the country, and has, I find, sold the whole property to the agent employed to provide a country house and some pleasure grounds for Sir Robert Raymond, (that is his name) previous to his arrival in England. The agent fixed upon this spot, and it became the seat of Sir Robert before my father knew that it was to be inhabited by a friend. Sir Robert is delighted with the purchase, and my father re∣joices to see a domain which he once loved, so properly disposed of. You also remember this retreat; for was you not the associate of our flowery infancy?— Louisa and Edward, Henry and Emma, formed the dear, family circle. You tell me it soothes you to indulge these sen∣timents: but, perhaps, they may be too <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat a trial for the present state of your spirits, and I forbear.</P>
<P>Sir Robert Raymond, our host, is a br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d set, brown faced, good-natured, very sensible man, with some, not disgreeable particu∣larities; a large fortune, sometime since bequeathed him, and no sort of impertinence in consequence of it. Humour, serious sense, and obser∣vation, divide his character. He was bred to physic, and in the ear∣lier part of his life practised as a sea surgeon. He is full of anecdote, and extremely assiduous to animate conversation, without ingrossing it. <HI>I</HI> am particularly the object of his notice, chiefly, no doubt, because he perceives I stand most in need of comfort; and I return his civilities as well as the situation of my heart will allow.</P>
<P>Yet, with respect to the country, I was somewhat mistaken, my friend. I happen to be fixed in a spot where every leaf of every tree appear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>consecrated</HI> An holy inspiration seems to breathe about me! Wherever I look I behold a trait of Henry — I tread the paths where, arm in arm, we have walked together, and I sleep in the very <HI>apart∣ment,</HI> which was formerly devoted to his repose. These are small circumstances, Louisa; but they cling close to the heart.—Yes, my dearest friend, this place is not without some softnesses, some seducing sweets, agreeable to the present distress which bears upon my spirits. However depressed, however exhausted, I am in proper feeling to <HI>en∣joy</HI> such a retreat. The tender lapse of the streams, the balmy lightness of the air, the serene quietness of shade, the freshness of that verdure which at once charms and <HI>cherishes</HI> the eye, the carol of the gentler kind of birds, the unobtrusive bloom of the softer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd of flowers — <HI>each</HI> and <HI>all</HI> of these conspire to produce that weeping resignation which Louisa has described; and which is the natural effect of a virtuous heart in disappointment. — But still I am unhappy. Since I am not
<PB N="44" REF="017678_0044_0FA21F2EB3DC7D40"/>
permitted to <HI>talk</HI> of the dear cause of my grief, I <HI>feel</HI> more. Some part of the sorrow, which used to vent itself in language, is now doubled by solitude and silence; like brooks which murmur least, when they are most profound. I write this in a little rocky cavity that stands in the garden, where, at your beloved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear of twilight's soberest grey, I have stept f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rth, amidst the breathing fragrance of eve, to meditate and to mourn. But while I write of my sequester'd retreat it is about to be disturbed, for the tread of an intruder assails my ear, — it is Sir Robert Raymond. — Adieu! oh, Louisa, adieu!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER L. TO F. BERKLEY, <HI>Esq.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BE so obliging as to tell me, whether it is madness, or dotage, to which I am now reduced? That it is one or the other, (pro∣vided it be not a mixture of <HI>both</HI>) is now past question. I cannot suf∣fer Corbett to propose me to his daughter, nor have I the confidence to propose myself. And, indeed, the more frequently I converse with her (which I take all decent occasions of doing) the more I see her, hear her voice, and perceive the sense "distinct and clear" that is falling from her lips whenever she opens them, the less I am able to speak, nay the less assurance have I to believe, that so much merit, youth, and beauty, will have any thing to say, seriously, to a fellow with so sun-burnt a visage, and <HI>unsentimental</HI> a set of fea∣tures, as the middle-aged Robert Raymond.</P>
<P>She hath an affecting trick of sighing bitterly, and of shedding tears, which burst upon one so unpreparedly, that, though I knew them to be the effusions of her friendship for the young volunteer, I could not find it in my heart to check them; but let a few of the same kind steal down my <HI>own</HI> cheek in very <HI>fellowship of sym∣pathy.</HI> I should upon my word, I <HI>feel</HI> that I should, and I have not sported with my emotions enough to disguise them.</P>
<P>Yet I have never heard her mention the name of Hammond since her arrival at Castleberry, from whence you see I am now da∣ting. Is not this strange? I always thought the tongue was a traitor upon these occasions. She LOOKS Hammond, methinks, but she SPEAKS him not. I think I can interpret her eyes; but <HI>they</HI> are indeed the seat of every fine sentiment, and seem made to express every thing that is gentle and tender, so that it is no wonder. <HI>You,</HI> friend Frederick, are an adept in these matters. Inform me.</P>
<P>Little of this great world can I speak more "than pertains to feats" of salves and plaisters, and therefore
<Q><L>"Little shall I grace my cause</L>
<L>"In judging for myself.</L></Q>
I do really think I am engaged in a very unthristy undertaking—a looking-glass that happens to hang near the table on which I am now writing, confirms me in this opinion. There is such a pal∣pable air of <HI>confidence</HI> in <HI>supposing</HI> I should succeed, that had not the torrid zone scorched all the <HI>graces of the blood</HI> out of my coun∣tenance, I should certainly blush.</P>
<P>I write, you see, in my old way, but I am put sorely out of my old road for all that. It is, after all, a droll sort of a defect I possess, that of really thinking I am too old and ugly to be an object of a young woman's attachment. Yet, there is nothing very preposter∣ous in this idea, either. Speak to Emma, says passion.—Dread a repulse, replies common sense.—Then give up the point, and think no more about it, cries Prudence.— "Ah! teach me how I should forget to think," answers Love, in the language of Romeo▪ A pretty struggle this for a grave man of forty-three, Frederick, is it not? Between ourselves, I fancy that, when I have procrastina∣ted
<PB N="47" REF="017678_0047_0FA21F30F2517840"/>
as much as possible, played the fool with my feelings and made myself sufficiently miserable, I shall see the propriety of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scaping</HI> an <HI>explanation,</HI> and so make a match of it in the Temple of <HI>Fancy</HI> only, where a man chooses his own mistress and can dread no disappointment. After all, I cannot but apprehend there is some little delicacy in this conduct. It proceeds from a quick <HI>terror</HI> of becoming ridiculous. Tender attachments, and all the train of the sensations they produce, are extremely graceful at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve-and-twenty but, when one has reached the wrong side of forty, I do truly think the <HI>belle passion</HI> somewhat outré. Yet, hitherto, having mixed but little with amiable young women, and never with im∣modest ones, the ardours of eighteen can scarce exceed my own, and I am, in this first affection, this first love, (for it is absolutely such) as bashful and as aukward as a boy just ushered into the soci∣ety of the sex. "'Tis passing strange," and perhaps "passing pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iful;" but, however you may enjoy the confession, I fully feel all the <HI>tremours of tenderness.</HI></P>

Dear as is the name of Hammond, much as I love to write it, and sweet as are the sensations which agitate my heart so often as I see it marked upon the paper, there is, methinks, something more dear, more lovely, and more sweet in that of Louisa Corbett. At least <HI>her title</HI> to use it seems to bring the <HI>sister</HI> so close upon my bosom▪ and so soft upon my soul, that I feel uncommon joy at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>idings.

<HI>BELL</HI>'s Book-Store, in Third Street. Just Published, the following NEW WORK, (Price One Dollar.) LORD LYTTELTON'S FAMILIAR LETTERS TO HIS FRIENDS, With his <HI>POEMS</HI> on several Occasions. Introduction to <HI>LYTTELTON's LETTERS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THERE is no species of publication which seems to be more agreeably received than that which illustrates the characters of men distinguished for their abilities, venerable for their erudi∣tion, and admired for their virtues. The political history of great men is useful and necessary to many; but the domestic history of all men is useful and necessary to all.</P>
<P>Among the materials from whence the biographer forms the vo∣lume of domestic characters, private letters are considered as the most valuable, because they are the most unequivocal authorities of real sentiment and opinion. Conversation is too fugitive to be remembered; public declarations may be oftentimes suspected; but the epistolary communications of friendship may be depended upon as faithful to the mind from whence they arise. The following letters, therefore, as proceeding from a Nobleman whose great talents promised no small utility to his country, and whose character has been the subject of such general speculation, will, without doubt, meet with a favourable reception.</P>
<P><HI>Memoradum,</HI> Great Variety of curious and useful Books, in History, Divinity, Voyages, Travels, Poetry, Plays, Novels, and Entertainment, with Medical and Surgical Works, Latin and Greek Classica, and evey Curiosity, whither Old or New, that is come-at-able, in the American World of Books; may be had at said BELL's Book-Store, near St. Paul's Church, in Third-Street, Philadelphia.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LIII. TO MRS. ARNOLD.</HEAD>
<P>BY a line just received from Louisa I am interdicted at present from writing to her, and the sentiments which now oppress me are indeed, on <HI>all</HI> accounts, improper to offer a mind pierced by so similar a sorrow. Yet, to restrain the whole dreadful weight in my own bosom would surely kill me. Do <HI>you</HI> then, O my dear cousin, my worthy Caroline, do <HI>you</HI> assist me. — Tell me, I conjure you, where the feeling heart shall find a sanctuary? Tell me, what foliage is thick and impenetrable enough to repel that terror which assails an unhappy woman, when the object of every hope and every fear is determined upon dangers the most complicated and decisive? Henry, your <HI>favourite</HI> Henry, is gone, you know, to defend his country, to signalize his bravery, and to serve his King. I admit the propriety of the enterprize, according to the laws of <HI>honour,</HI> but I weep at the extremity of its horror when tried by the laws of <HI>feeling</HI> and <HI>humanity.</HI></P>
<P>The glowing arguments of that dear departed, I did not dare to oppose. I faintly breathed the female resistance, I feared, lest my affection might seem to be selfish, by contesting the point of separation. I violated the softness of my sex, and the tenderness of my nature, to restrain the flowing tide that rose in billows to my heart, which laboured with the agony of suppression. His being this moment upon the sea, eager to gain the seats of hostility, is a proof of it! Perhaps, I might have seduced him from this adventure, since humanity and love (oh, how opposite from ravage and war!) are the principles which shine the brightest in the spotless history of Henry's youth. But I dreaded the after operations of inexorable honour, which might detest the trembling hand that saved it from the sword.</P>
<P>Yet <HI>now,</HI> my Caroline, <HI>now</HI> that he is far removed from the voice of my complainings, and can no longer be disarmed by their sweet impression, suffer, oh suffer me to mourn — suffer me to ex∣ecrate that wanton and insatiable <HI>power,</HI> which scatters desolation o'er the land! Ah this dire <HI>daemon</HI> of <HI>battle!</HI> —this <HI>daeman,</HI> who, with giant footsteps, tramples upon the best and most beautiful af∣fections of the soul— who delights to hear the wail of the wounded, and the groans of the expiring—whose vessels sail upon a sea of tears, and are wafted by sighs which are extorted from the tender bosom. I see, I see the sanguinary power. He shoots athwart the realms of affrighted fancy, in a robe of crimson ten times dyed in the blood of his votaries. The soft verdure of the spring withers as he advances. The streams of plenty, which fertilized a happy wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld, stand checked in their progress, or roll onward a bed of troubled waters. Behold where the ruthless monarch approaches.
<PB N="4" REF="017678_0052_0FA21F3A25F98AD8"/>
The bounties and the beauties of nature fall before him. — Terri∣tories are torn up by the roots, and empires mingle in the common ravage. Behold, chained to his triumphal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar, fear, despair, and all the family of pain; while the lover, the friend, the father, the widow, the orphan, and all the virtues bleed in the procession. Dreadful, dreadful retinue! and all for what?— for what, my Caro∣line? Wherefore is the peace of the world thus to be destroyed? Wherefore is man to raise his hand against the life of man, and deliberate murder to be intitled to applause?</P>
<P>Hear, O humanity, the reply, and be <HI>still</HI> if thou canst! The rulers of different realms, in the wanton exertion of power, infringe upon what is falsely called the property of each other. Men, who are utter strangers to the very persons of one another, and are separated, perhaps, by partitions of a thousand leagues, quarrel for a few vile acres of the dirt which shall presently cover the toiling race; and the lives of a people are devoted to the sword. Earth itself, wide as is extended her beautiful domain, is not <HI>enough</HI> extensive for these pigmy mortals to divide amongst themselves; nor are the natural miseries of a very short life, with all its moral, all its civil, all its social evils, sufficient, without the aids of untimely and <HI>voluntary</HI> slaughter. The hurry of the scene, the din of the battle▪ and that political music which drowns the cry of distress, may <HI>pass over</HI> these sentiments, and humanity will not have time to hear, nor to be heard. But in the quieter moment, when the <HI>gentle</HI> power revisits the bosom, and resumes the lovely throne from whence she has been driven, oh how impious, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow contemp∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>le, will appear those bickerings, which terminate in the effusion of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>man bloo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. And could these heroes enter cooly into the <HI>con∣sequence</HI> of this barba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>us practice: this practice of defacing and hacking away the expr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s image of their God, to ascertain privileges in a world which was made for the reception and accommodation, the peace and the pleasure of <HI>all</HI> mankind—could they be spectators of the calamity which equally attends the shout of victory and the shriek of defeat—could they behold the inconsolable wife sink upon her widowed bed, and the child, stretching forth its little hands in vain to greet a returning father—a father, left naked, mangled, and unburied, upon a foreign and an inhospitable shore—would not the touch of human pity assert its softening pressure, and all agree to cultivate the blessings of universal brotherhood?</P>
<P>How many wretches, forlorn and fallen, are at this instant pi∣ning away on the sorrow-steeped couch, while the heedless m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lti∣tude echo the praises of one who has earned a laurel at the expence of adding acres to his king, and anguish to his country-women?— I am no politician, Mrs. Arnold; I am a human being. I am a Christian. I am one who profess to adore a religion of peace —one too, who can never be persuaded that the human form divine —the express image of the Deity— is created thus fair, and thus amiable, to be cruelly sported away in the riots of ambition, pride, and folly—</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="017678_0053_0FA21F3AF7182040"/>Ah, my dear Henry! alive as thou art to all that is most endear∣ing, what will be <HI>thy</HI> sensations <HI>after</HI> the bloody affray! Thou▪ whose bosom is gentler than the mildest and kindliest breezes of the spring!—what wilt <HI>thou</HI> feel, should some hapless woman, attend∣ed by all her little orphans, demand, of thy victorious hand, the slaughtered husband, and the slaughtered fire? Or should but thy <HI>fancy</HI> suggest such a groupe, rushing through the ranks, and in piercing tones of agony exclaiming—"<HI>restore, restore</HI> them to me," — how would'st thou support it?

<P>O Caroline, Caroline, I congeal with horror. I can derive no lasting serenity from the pious example of the resigned Louisa. I rage. I rave. I cannot bear it. Indeed I cannot! Hope, duty, religion, are insufficient. I shall be detected in the deepest agony of my sorrow. The tears are deluging my paper.

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Cousin,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with great willingness I set down to make a reply to the let∣ter you addressed to me; but it is not without much concern that I find it necessary to use the pen in answer to those which you addressed to Louisa, whose present state of health is such as to pre∣vent her writing. Anxious, however, even as she presses the pil∣low
<PB N="8" REF="017678_0056_0FA21F3CF72BDEF0"/>
of sickness, to alleviate the suspense of her beloved Emma (in regard to the promised articles of confidence) she instructs me to acquaint you, in the concisest way that I am able, of the means by which she became the wife of your unfortunate brother, as well as with the reasons which prevailed with her to keep that union a se∣cret from <HI>his</HI> family, from her <HI>own,</HI> and from the <HI>world.</HI> She con∣ceives too, that the deeper colours of distress in <HI>her</HI> fate, may, by comparison, alleviate the softer tints of wretchedness in <HI>your's</HI>; for at the worst, my dear cousin, as matters now stand, you have a lover living who is very properly the object of many a charming hope; while the poor Louisa is daily tortured with reflecting on the death of one yet dearer than a lover—even a husband and a father, who is the object of many a misery too mighty for the solace of sighs and tears.</P>
<P>With respect to the letter I have had the pleasure to receive from you it bespeaks a heart overflowing with streams of genuine philanthro∣py, and beautifully becomes the pen of Emma Corbett. But believe me, believe a woman who has been connected from her infancy with men devoted to the trade of arms—believe the daughter of a veteran chief, and the widow of one who felt the military passion in all its force—believe <HI>her</HI> when she tells you, that such gentle arguments are never of the least consequence in the eyes, or on the minds of a soldier. They serve only to make female weakness the more pitied by the men, who think the dignity of a more resolved courage <HI>con∣cerned</HI> to shew itself in <HI>contrast.</HI> Sometimes, it is true, the tears of a wife will excite the manly drop in the eye of a husband; but it tarries not. The voice of public fame is, on these occasions, louder than that of private affection. The world fixes an earnest look on the actions of an officer. One hero inflames another: the sparks of glory pass like an electric power: the necessity of a brave <HI>example</HI> becomes apparent: the profession soon grows into a darling passion: the blood warms: the genius of war takes possession of every facul∣ty: home connexions are forgotten: the scene of action terminates the prospect: the warrior can see no farther. Valour and victory seem marching before him. There is not leisure for a private emo∣tion, and tenderness would assist the efforts of his foe He gives himself up, therefore, nobly and absolutely, to the battle; wounds can make no impression upon him in the progress of his ardent ca∣reer; and death itself is, in that moment, less terrible than defeat.</P>
<P>These, my lovely cousin, are not the sentiments of a theorist, but caught immediately from the lips of the very heroes who prac∣tised every action they relate. In the interval of peace, few men of any order have a more elegant humanity than the English offi∣cers; and all the endearing qualifications, which make up the great domestic characters, are to be found amongst them; but in the day of contest, my cousin, a different duty calls upon them, and military fame is as easily wounded, and its wounds as vital to felicity, as those of a woman.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="017678_0057_0FA21F3DB2037398"/>Let not your glowing pencil paint the protectors of our country as beings destitute of every tender feeling, but allow for their situ∣ation, which sometimes renders incompatible the immediate union of love and glory: or the duties of peace with the duties of war.</P>
<P>While I close this sentence, Louisa expresses a wish to write to you <HI>herself.</HI> To-morrow she imagines that she shall be equal to the task, and she assures me that nothing which relates to the history of <HI>her</HI> husband and <HI>your</HI> brother, can come so properly from any pen as her own. In the hope of her gaining strength for the friendly effort, I will fold up my letter, and bid you farewell.</P>

<P>P. S. I find you are still indisposed, and may, perhaps, want amusement in your solitude. To this end I send you the FRAGMENT of a little military history found amongst my father's papers. It will shew you that humanity and bravery are nearly allied, and that the tender husband and good soldier often form the same character, though they cannot always exert themselves in the same moment; or, perhaps, were we to scrutinize nicely, we should, in reality, find, that when the soldier is hazarding his life and liberty for that of his wife, his children, his countrymen, and his King, he is <HI>then</HI> the tenderest lover, the worthiest husband, the best parent, the most loyal subject, and the most valuable citizen. I believe it was written by my father in his youth, and I consider it as a family relique.</P>

<HEAD>A MILITARY FRAGMENT. THE CARBINES.</HEAD>
<P>*****OH for the history of that wound! said I, seeing a scar upon the cheek of the person appointed to shew me the hospital! — Oh for the history of that wound!</P>
<P>Not worth the telling, answered the man, pointing to the stump of his left thigh as to a more important subject of curiosity He took me into a different quarter of the building, which presented the lodgings of those who were pensioners. In each was a small bed, a chair, and a table. The attendant's name was Julius Carbine. At a door leading into one of the apartments be stopped: and then looked through an aperture, which commanded the room.</P>
<P>The luckiest of all moments, said Julius — for brother Nestor will soon be at it, and it is a day of discipline. We will enter.— Julius, said the owner of the apartment, as we entered, sit down with your company. The side of the bed was covered with a clean white cloth, by a little girl who opened the door, and I had also a little girl with me, and we all sat down. It was actually the <HI>brother,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not the brother <HI>soldier</HI> only, to whom Julius introduced us. In their appearance there was a fraternal <HI>similarity,</HI> not so con∣sisting in the features and limbs which remained, as in the misfor∣tunes
<PB N="10" REF="017678_0058_0FA21F3E7B6FF528"/>
which had happened to those invisible parts which lay scat∣tered in different quarters of the globe.</P>
<P>Julius was the younger of the Carbines, and as he placed himself <HI>side ways</HI> upon the bed, and desired Carbine the elder (whose name was Nestor) to suspend the attack — he told his story.</P>
<P>We slept in the same cradle, and were nursed up for the service. Our little arms—</P>
<P>He flourished a stump which projected about four inches from the right shoulder—Our little arms—</P>
<P>But I have begun the matter wrong and prematurely, for before I relate the account which Carbine gave of himself, I should offer some description of his person, as well as that of his brother Nestor. It is the stump of Julius which reminds me of this.</P>
<P>Carbine the elder was the remnant of a noble figure, who in the uprightness of his youth must have risen six feet from the earth per∣pendicularly. He had the marks of about seventy years wearing in his face — allowing for the natural vigour of his form, the in∣vasions of incident, time, and profession. The present stoop in his shoulders was favourable to the height, or rather to the want of height in his apartment. It is not without just cause that I called Nestor a <HI>remnant.</HI> Nature originally formed in him her fairest pro∣portions. At the time I saw him he was a capital figure reduced. For instance, if you looked him in the face, or, more properly to speak, in the residue of his face, you would perceive, in his left cheek, a deep scarification, which boasted no sort of rivalship with the glorious embrowning of the other that had received no in∣jury. Though Nestor himself said, "the whole cheek, in com∣parison with the half cheek, looked like an errant poltroon." "It is a cheek," cried he, "which seems to have done no duty; now here," continued he, turning the other side to view with much tri∣umph, "here are the signs of service."</P>
<P>Both the Carbines, indeed, had <HI>served</HI> to some purpose. In point of honorary cred<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntials there was little cause of jealousy. Nothing could be more equally divided than the mutual marks of brother∣hood in bravery. Sorely battered were the outworks of both. It is worth while to observe how the matter was settled to their satis∣faction and credit. The thigh of Julius became the victim of a parapet, but then Nestor was even with him when he had the ho∣nour to drop his left arm in the counterscarp. But as if fortune did not imagine an arm, and that a <HI>left</HI> arm, a sufficient equivalent to a whole thigh, amputated at one decisive whizz by a cannon ball, she deprived Nestor of his right foot, which was left at the bottom of an entrenchment in Flanders. The younger Carbine had the track of a musket visible at the extremity of his neck, and the bul∣lets, with which that musket was charged, slanted along the left jaw, carrying off some of the finest teeth in the world, and which, perhaps, are even yet to be seen in one of the fosses To bring the military scale even, on the part of Julius, he has the good fortune to conceal under his hat (which, upon account of that concealment he
<PB N="11" REF="017678_0059_0FA21F3F39481BB8"/>
seldom wears) a respectable contusion, which, beginning at the left ear, swept away, not only the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eatest part of that, but all that grew in its path, from one end to the other; which distinguish∣ing stroke is in honor of the bastion. But Julius had his <HI>unostenta∣tious</HI> wounds too: his shirt covering no less than six, insomuch that his bosom was crossed this way and that, direct and transverse, like a draught board. I detected the flush of something like vic∣tory in the countenance of Julius, as he threw open his chitterlin, and opened his shirt-collar under pretence of too much heat: but Carbine the elder checked his brother's ambition by by baring his right arm to his shoulder, (or rather begging <HI>me</HI> to bare it) and there discovering a masked battery of blows, which were a fair match for those in the breast of Julius.</P>
<P>Thus were the testimonies of their prow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss participated; and if (said they) either of us could have boasted a less equal division, it would have been a blow too many for our friendship, and, perhaps, have bred ill blood betwixt us.</P>
<P><HI>Here the fragment is torn.</HI></P>
<P>— the veteran Carbines, after having platooned and pioneered it for a number of years, in the cause of their country, found at length they could keep the field no longer.</P>
<P>They entered the Temple of Peace: but not quite on the footing of ordinary members. The senior Carbine privately enjoyed some small privileges, and the junior was in possession of the casual∣ties derivable from shewing the hospital to such as had the curiosity to survey it: and he hopped about with his <HI>ruins</HI> in a manner that engaged one's pity and admiration.</P>
<P><HI>A second rent in the fragment.</HI></P>
<P>—</P>
<P>Now Nestor was a man of enalienable affections. They were not to be subdued. The military passion was by no means dead in his bosom. The heart of the soldier was still visible in his little bed-chamber. There were to be seen, suspended from the walls, the battered co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>slet that had covered his breast, and the firelock, whose iron mouth was almost worn out by the loadings. They were brightly burnished, and the nicest care taken to clean them weekly.</P>
<P>But this was nothing. The practical part of a soldier's discipline did Nestor carry on in a room of forty inches diameter.</P>
<P>No sooner were we all seated by the side of the bed, than a sin∣gular ceremony began. He had six sons, all little, all living for their country, and in secret training for the battle under their father. It was his custom, thrice in the week, to turn the key upon all the pensioners but his brother, and instruct his family in the art of war. Poor as he was, he had actually been at the cost of equipping them; had fitted up for them something that resembled a uniform, and
<PB N="12" REF="017678_0060_0FA21F3FF1B1DCE0"/>
in miniature accoutrements, presented them with the sword, the musquet, and the bayonet.</P>
<P>The soldier's science was taught them by the veteran. One branch or another of the art military was the subject of every day. The sons of Nestor Carbine knew not the enervating luxuries of artificial heat: they thawed the severity of the seasons with nobler fires. Their education was wholly martial. At night they listened to the lecture, and their swords were drawn forth to practise what they had heard in the morn. They engaged their strengthening arms in the <HI>mock</HI> fight, that they might be prepared for the <HI>real</HI> one. It was now the evening of the ravelin, then of the flanking; now of the fortification, then of the fossé; now of the half-moon, then of the epaulment; now of the saps, and then of the ambus∣cade; now of the horn-works, and then of the bastion; now of the gabion, and then again of the mines, the parapet, the battery, or the tenaille.</P>
<P>They had just began an engagement as we entered the room — It will be best related before the younger Carbine tells his story. Let him therefore repose a little longer upon the bed.</P>
<P>The stripling troops were drawn up three deep in the centre of the room, and the object of attack was a large deal trunk set up∣right betwixt the contending parties. One side were to oppose and one to defend. The father was commander, and in good time came the brother, who, instead of reposing on the bed as above∣mentioned, sprung up with surprizing agility, and hopped away to head the adverse party, making a kind of warlike music with a lit∣tle drum tattoo'd by the timber instrument that served him for an arm. Nestor, meantime, assumed a whistle which served for a clarionet.</P>
<P>The engagement was carried on in the exactest military order; they advanced, they retreated, they rallied, and they came on again.— Every little heart panted with ambition, every eye sparkled with ex∣pectation of victory. The mimic ardour soon became real, and the two generals were themselves wrought up into a serious sensation. Julius shouted, and Nestor encouraged. But, presently, the aspect of the battle altered, for one of the <HI>besiegers</HI> (a boy of uncommon bra∣very) took one of the <HI>besieged</HI> prisoner. The conqueror flourished his little soil, but the captive shed tears of slavery and sorrow. The ge∣neral on the worsted side affected to be dismayed. His opponent spirited up his army, pursued his victory, took a a second of the enemy prisoner, and the town (that is the <HI>box</HI>) was taken.</P>
<P>A shout of joy was heard on one side, while the poor remains o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the conquered troops fled to a corner that was the interior en∣campment behind the bed. Julius beat the dead march with his wooden drum-stick: but Nestor and his troops, having burst the city gates, (that is the box <HI>lid</HI>) proceeded to plunder. It con∣tained all the magazines of the enemy, consisting of new foils, martial caps, belts, wooden bayonets, confections, and fruits. These were the prizes of conquest. They were all fairly won, and
<PB N="13" REF="017678_0061_0FA21F42811F3370"/>
divided amongst the victors according to seniority. The little girl, who had sat on the bed, now sprung up, took a small ozier-basket, from a hook, and strewed flowers in the path of the victorious, singing a song of triumph as they marched round the room. The ceremonies, however, being over, both parties came forward, and shook hands very heartily, in token of good-will, and then the af∣fair ended with "God save great George our King" and a gene∣ral huzza.</P>
<P>—</P>
<P>Our little arms, continued Julius, (whom I will interupt no more) were nursed into early vigour for the field: for our fa∣ther, whose bones—May every Saint bless them said Nestor— have been reposing more than half a century, in different parts of Flanders and Germany, struck first into that mode of training which my brother ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> adopted. Other people's children have playthings given the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> because, forsooth, they whimper for them; but we were never allowed so much as a hoop or a top till we gained it by a vic∣tory. We knew the difficulty of obtaining the prize, and valued it the more; and thus were fitted for deeds of hardihood, ere other infants had an idea of glory.</P>
<P>Poor creatures! said Nestor's second son scornfully.</P>
<P><HI>We</HI> could vault upon the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeds of the menage before <HI>they</HI> could keep the saddle of their wooden ponies. Ripe for practice, we were sent forth at an early age to the field, and both of us entered as volunteers in the service of our country.—We did so said Nestor.</P>
<P>Nature — for which stump as I am, I still thank her—gave us no bad forms; and, though we took the field with faces as effeminate as that of our mother, [You was reckoned the very mode<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> her, you know, Nestor] — yet the first campaign left us no room to blush upon that score, Our virgin engagement happened in the hottest glow of the summer, and we were soon rid of a delicacy which is inglorious on the front of a soldier. Oh with what pleasure did we contemplate the alterations at our return!—I remember it said Nestor, smiling.</P>
<P>The traits of the mother were quite worn out by the weather. — In every lineament there was seasoning. The sun had written hero in our countenances, and we rejoiced in the dignity of the tan.</P>
<P>But mark the joke, Sir; a fantastical pair of wenches pretended to love us, in our fair-weather suit of features, before we made the first sally, that is, before we were <HI>worth</HI> loving; but took it into their heads to quarrel with our appearance the very moment we re∣turned. They wanted still to see the red and white of the <HI>woman,</HI> and so took to themselves new paramours—The jades gave us up, Sir, for a couple of fellows who would shudder at the patter of a hail-storm.</P>
<P>So much the better, said Nestor. We have had the satisfaction to see one of the rascals hanged for sheep-stealing, and the other you know is to be put into the pillory this day se'ennight.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="017678_0062_0FA21F43009E3BD0"/>And I'll be prepared for him, I warrant ye, exclaimed one of the boys.—No, child, said Nestor: he is no mark for the son of a soldier.</P>
<P>After this, Sir, we had no lazy periods of peace. Some part or another of Europe was continually beating the drum or sounding the trumpet in the ear of England. It was our duty to go forth in her defence.</P>
<P>Father, said the eldest of the boys, when is it likely we shall have a <HI>war?</HI></P>
<P>My brother, Sir, — (continued Carbine, who was not put out by any family remarks) — my brother, Sir, had the honour of the first misfortune. — You do not call it by a right name, said Nestor.</P>
<P><HI>He</HI> triumphed in the first testimony of the warrior. — I am an elder brother, said Nestor, and the first blow was my birth-right.</P>
<P>But I was soon even with him; for, towards th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> close of the campaign, a random shot — when I was thinking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> nothing less, — gave the four fingers of my left hand to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>emy. In that condition we entered into winter quarters.</P>
<P>But no sooner was my brother cured of the wound in his face. — You may see the mark of it here, Sir, said Nestor. — in his face, than he received one much deeper in his heart!</P>
<P>In his <HI>heart,</HI> cried the youngest of the six sons, clapping his hand on his father's side? — why, you joke: here it is alive and merry now. I can feel it beat.</P>
<P>God keep it so, answered the eldest. It will be a sore day for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s when that stops, I promise thee.</P>
<P>Give me thy hand, Ferdinand, said Nestor; and brother, do you go <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with your story, for it entertains the gentleman and his little daughter, and I like to hear it. You were always good at a story from a child. Go on.</P>
<P>—Would you believe it, Sir, that a fellow so sliced should have the impudence to attack one of the prettiest girls in England?</P>
<P>In the <HI>world,</HI> you might have said, cried Nestor, shaking his knee.</P>
<P>—Like a brave boy of the blade, he pushed his point right on, turned his <HI>worst</HI> side to the wench, and insisted upon her taking the scars as a recommendation.</P>
<P>Why they <HI>were</HI> so, said Nestor, holding his knee still while he spoke.</P>
<P>—In this manner he continued to batter the citadel which trem∣bled in the bosom of the pool girl, and in less than a month (no time at all for such a siege) he entered the fair castle of her affections in triumph.</P>
<P>By the blood that I have shed▪ Sir, said Nestor, and by the drops which <HI>yet</HI> flow in my body, Frances was the best and bravest wench that ever lay by the side of a soldier.</P>
<P>Nestor, said Julius, hold your tongue. — His limbs, Sir, were almost constantly on the move. War carried them away. What
<PB N="15" REF="017678_0063_0FA21F43B150D508"/>
of that? His joke was ready. Never mind, Frances, (would he say to his wife) I am the winner yet, fear nothing. Were I redu∣ced to my trunk, I should flourish still, my girl. A soldier, whose children have blood in their veins, is invulnerable. He is immor∣tal in his sons.</P>
<P>Let us <HI>engage,</HI> father! said one of the boys eagerly, as he bran∣dished his foil.</P>
<P>Thus would my brother heal up the wounds of the war: but be that as it may, wounds are but sorry things in a family. Often <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s my brother disputed with me on this subject. "Julius, (would he say ) thou art but half a loyal subject still — thou givest to thy country the services only of an individual, while <HI>I</HI> furnish it with the force of a whole family. As an <HI>individual,</HI> thou must soon die; but hadst thou taken care to <HI>multiply</HI> thyself as I have done, thou mightest well expect to live and conquer these thousand years. Brot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r, brother, it is a false notion; a soldier ought of all men in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Majesty's dominions the soonest to marry: he ought indeed." Notwithstanding this, Sir, I could never be prevailed upon. No, though an honest girl offered to sling my knapsack across her shoulder after the loss of my thigh. To confess the plain truth, to you, I did not like certain ceremonies betwixt my brother and sister, at their partings. Frances indeed wept but little, but, in my opinion, she <HI>looked</HI> a much deeper sorrow than is to be expressed by a pair of wet eyes.</P>
<P>—Nestor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emm'd violently.</P>
<P>And as to my brother, though he cocked his hat fiercely — pre∣tended to have caught cold — rubbed up his accoutrements, and blustered mightily, he never was steadily himself — and how the devil <HI>should</HI> he be — for a week after. These things, Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> against the grain. The brush of a b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llet is nothing at all: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay take off your head, or it may only take off your hat: either way, no great matter — but the cries of a woman, the piercing agonies of a wife, to come across one's thoughts in the last moments — No, Sir, — no, damn it — there's no bearing that — I will live and die batchelor!</P>
<P>But this is not the worst, Sir. <HI>Death</HI> sometimes comes at the bottom of the account to <HI>unsoldier</HI> a man. He knocked at brother Nestor's door, and carried Frances away while she was nursing him of a fever into which he was thrown by the pain of a wound. — Zounds! that was a terrible day, Nestor, was it not?</P>
<P>Terrible! said Nestor, turning his head from the company.</P>
<P>She died suddenly. Courage, said I, brother. He waved his hand, and spoke not. Brother, said I, have courage. "Fool, replied he, in a passion — (if had he called me so in cold blood, I would have had him out)—Fool, said he, (in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> way that one could not but forgive him, stamping his foot on the ground at the same time) am I, thinkest thou, before GOD ALMIGHTY or the enemy? What has courage to do before him? thou should'st tell me to be <HI>patient.</HI>" I said no more: for the poor Frances lay dead before
<PB N="16" REF="017678_0064_0FA21F44F27269D8"/>
his eyes; and there being but one bed of any size, the living and the dead lay together.</P>
<P>Child, (said Nestor, to the little girl, his daughter, who was sobbing at the side of the bed, with her apron thrown over her eyes) —come hither. Thou art <HI>like</HI> thy mother — kiss me.</P>
<P>Nestor (continued Julius) tied the crape round his arm, and his soul was in mourning. He gave Frances to the earth. Decency —<HI>Go no farther,</HI> said Nestor,</P>
<P>—Decency required <HI>my</HI> attendance, Sir. My poor Carbine shed then the first tears that I ever saw upon his cheek. Oh! he was melted down into something softer than his mother. He wan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d to prevent the man from striking the nails into the coffin.—</P>
<P>Julius, GO NO FARTHER, I say, (cried Nestor) pressing his daughter close to his breast.</P>
<P>I wish my uncle would hold his tongue, said one of the boys.</P>
<P>He opened the closed lid, and peeped in, (con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nued Julius.) He cast a lingering look into the grave. He drew his hand gently over the coffin as the sexton was beginning to lower it. He kneeled down to see that it was put <HI>softly</HI> into the ground. He let it go, and said he was perfectly resigned; then came away, and then returned, then went off a second time, and sought the grave again, wringing his hand, and declaring he was perfectly resigned all the time —</P>
<P>Wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>kill</HI> me, Julius? said Nestor: stop, I say!</P>
<P>—in short, sir, he — he — he — did so many things upon that occasion, that, surely, if a man has any love for a woman, he ought to be a batchelor.</P>

<P>— After the engagement the solemn thoughts again came on.—Julius rubbed his face twice or thrice along the pillow, and declared that while the wind continued in that quarter, his old aches would twinge him a little.</P>
<P>And in this hospital, Sir, we are now laid up for life, said Julius.</P>
<P>He rubbed his face again upon the pillow. Well, said he rising, every dog has his day!</P>
<P>Upon this Nestor began to whistle: — not one of those tunes which arise from vacancy, but a whistle truly contemplative; it was more slow and pensive as he proceeded, and in its closing cadence, a tear started from his eye. Streaming almost to the borders of the upper lip, it settled there, and though as he waved his heed backwards and forwards, it trembled upon the edge of his cheek, it did not fall.</P>
<P>When he had opened the door, I stole an opportunity to put something into his hand.</P>
<P>He took it as money ought to be taken by a brave or worthy man who wants assistance, and sees no shame in receiving it. A sober smile came into his countenance: but the <HI>tear</HI> continued.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="017678_0065_0FA21F4550A5E2F8"/>His daughter's hand was still closed in his; but she looked at the tear, and was taking out her handkerchief.</P>
<P>Let it alone, my dear, said Nestor. IT IS YOUR MOTHER'S.</P>
<P>How are the Carbines to be envied, said I when we were stepping into the street!</P>
<P>You flatter us, replied Nestor, bowing gently. — I went two paces and turned back. — The tear had verged off, possibly while he was bowing.</P>
<P>It had got upon <HI>my</HI> little girl's face, and there it hung like a dew drop from a rose-bud. — Good God, said I, how rapid an exchange!</P>
<P>In saying this, I found it had vanished from the cheek of my daughter, in the time that I was making the exclamation!</P>
<P>Alas, it is <HI>quite</HI> gone then! said I.</P>

<P><HI>I</HI> KNOW not whether I shall live long enough to relate the horrors of my situation!</P>
<P>On the evening of the day that I desired the suspension, I felt an impulse, more strong and more sacred than that of common curiosity, to know the full scope of my suspicions.</P>
<P><HI>Before</HI> this interview, my distress appeared sufficiently great. Alas▪ we are continually exclaiming that the heart will break, without knowing what additional burthens it will bear, even when we think it is <HI>most</HI> surcharged.</P>
<P>Come hither, dear Emma, said my father—drawing me gently to him —his hand trembling as he touched my gown.</P>

And it is so extreme, that I have been compelled (ah, hard necessity) to dispose of this fair mansion, which hath more than a cen∣tury owned a Corbett far its Lord. This very room, my dear, which gave — oh spare, me Emma, — this very room, the consecra∣ted spot of <HI>thy nativity,</HI> is now another's; and so are the late heredi∣tary lands that smile around it. The ruin has been <HI>deliberate</HI> too: and I have concealed it from every eye; even (and indeed chiefts) from thine, till now that I am in the arms of poverty.

<P>O thou lovely stream from a fountain whose sources are stopped — <HI>what,</HI> what is to be done?</P>
<P>The <HI>decisive</HI> blow came yesterday upon me. I had, ere this, in reserve, one rich casket — but it is gone: the last capture has deprived us of it. It would have been enough for <HI>my</HI> age and for <HI>your</HI> youth, but the post of yesterday —</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LXVI. TO EMMA CORBETT.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prior to the receipt of the above.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>NO, my loved sister, I will not, cannot, send a long story. A few pages will comprise the main circumstances; and let those suffice till days of future conversation. — Your father had ever an ambition to enlarge the fortune of his Edward by marriage: and Edward had already sufficient to his wishes. He acquainted his father of the love which he bore to Louisa. It produced a dis∣pute. My brother happened to be present. He entered as your father exclaimed, "What but beggary can be expected with a girl like Louisa Hammond, of scarce an hundred pounds a year?" — The conversation stopped.</P>
<P>Sir, (said Henry to Edward, when they were alone) had any man living but Emma's father spoke in these terms of my sister, he should have been punished for it severely. — I love <HI>Emma Corbett,</HI> and to her he is indebted for—</P>
<P>And I love <HI>Louisa Hammond,</HI> Sir, (replied your brother) but my father has an arm of his own, and that failing, he has that of a <HI>son,</HI> to defend him from the insults of a boy, should he <HI>dare</HI> to —</P>
<P>It is an improper place to discuss the question, said Henry. They went out. Henry commanded Edward, in terms of intole∣rable severity, never to offer his hand to Louisa, while Edward insisted, that Henry should desist from farther engaging the affecti∣ons of Emma. The inhibition was promised to be observed, and a breach of it was to terminate in the last frightful decision amongst men. Edward dropped his visits, and I knew not the cause. Henry did the same, and you were equally ignorant of the motive. I fell sick; a fever seized my spirits, and my life was despaired of. Edward heard of my illnes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and came to visit me at a time when he knew Henry was from home. He found me in the extremity — the fever was become pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rid, and the physician ordered no one to approach my breath any nearer than could be avoided; the bed was strewed
<PB N="20" REF="017678_0068_0FA21F49EFD38F90"/>
with the herbs which are supposed to prevent infection. Regardless of this, and every other image of self-preservation, Edward rushed into my chamber, threw himself upon his knees by the side of the bed, and hung his head over my face, which received and welcomed the tender tears that were streaming from his eyes. O! Louisa, Louisa, (said he) I can bear it no longer! At these words Henry was heard upon the stairs, Edward leaped up — Heavens! said he, can it be possible, is Henry returned? Well, it is no matter. My brother entered the room, and at the sight of Edward stept back, like a man astonished. Edward ran up to him, threw his arms about his neck, and insisted that the embrace should be returned. Oh Henry, he exclaimed, too long have we mutually suffered a false delicacy to prevail. Enough have we sacrificed to pique, for Emma and Louisa have been the victims. I heard that your sister was dying, and I could not deny myself the mournful privi∣lege of a friend— will you chide me for it, Henry? — will you still withhold your hand and your heart from the brother of Emma Corbett? <HI>Will you?</HI> This was the first moment I had been in∣formed of the dispute. The surprise was too much for me in the <HI>firmest</HI> state of my constitution. In the condition I <HI>then</HI> was, it had well-nigh proved fatal. All which my strength suffered me to do was to raise myself on my pillow, fold my hands in the attitude of intreaty, and with feeble accents to implore, they would spare my last moments, and not embitter them by <HI>their</HI> enmity.</P>
<P>Ere I had uttered this, Henry and Edward were weeping on the necks of each other, and Henry said, alas! Edward, I <HI>owe</HI> you more than this, for on my part was the promise first broken. I have secretly maintained the usual correspondence with Emma, since she has been away: and found the <HI>tenderness</HI> superior to the <HI>anger</HI> of my temper. Indeed we have <HI>both</HI> been wrong. Henceforward, let us be <HI>more</HI> than friends — if possible, let us be brothers. Shall we not, my Edward?</P>
<P>Again, Emma, I clasped my hands, and a sudden sense of joy came over me that gave a turn — a <HI>happy</HI> turn to my disorder. I recovered. It was agreed between us that the <HI>cause of the quarrel,</HI> and the means of the reconciliation, should be equally a secret. The families were re-united, and none but Edward, Henry, and Louisa, could account for the late coolness on the part of the two former. But the harmony was not o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> long duration; — it was again interrupted by your father's violence in the cause of <HI>America,</HI> opposed to that of my brother in the cause of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> Edward sided with the former, and, though it no longer prevented an intercourse between us, it threatened an eternal separation of political interests. At the same time Henry was permitted to address you, and Edward continued openly his partiality for me. — Nay, your father at last declared, he hoped still to see the two countries restored to the embraces of each other, and two happy matches to felicitate their union. You were, my dear Emma, fortunately from home on a visit during most of these transactions,
<PB N="21" REF="017678_0069_0FA21F4B250D07F8"/>
and your Henry did not think it prudent to break the thread, of an elegant affection by the little jarrings that were happening to cross it at home. The contest now became fierce on the other side the Atlantic▪ and threatened to carry bloodshed and rapine to that part of the continent where Edward had property. Louisa (said he to me, one evening) I must cros<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the seas: my fortune is in danger: it equally concerns you and me, that I should endeavour to defend ti, yet I will wait another month to hear the event of terms that are proposing between the countries — if they produce <HI>peace,</HI> you know how ready I shall be to continue in England; if they <HI>fail</HI> of that end, you must have resolution enough to part from me for a short season. But, continued he, as no man can tell the chances of the slightest separation, I ardently wish to call you by the ten∣derest of all human titles, <HI>mine,</HI> before I go. <HI>Publickly</HI> this cannot be done, for though my father affects to consent, our union would make him unhappy. No, Louisa: let our happiness be known only to ourselves till it is proper to communicate it. Impart it not▪ till my return at least, to Emma, to Henry, or to any part of the family. I have my reasons for it, even more strong than those that have been already related.</P>
<P>Soon after this conversation, Emma, we were privately married, and none of the appointments that led to the ceremony, or which succeeded it, were discovered or suspected. Previous to the voyage of my hapless husband, he put into my hand a sealed paper, con∣taining his will, and he desired I would not open it till his return▪ in the fond hope of that return being possible▪ I have, till within these few days, kept the seal unbroken, and now, alas! I find it is a testamentary disposal of his property abroad, bequeathed en∣tirely to me as sole executrix. —</P>
<P>Yes, my dear Emma, there <HI>is</HI> a fatherless Edward, and Heaven only knows whether the father had any knowledge of his birth before he died. I repeatedly sent letters, full of all a mother's minute and affecting solicitude, but I received no replies.</P>
<P>To Mrs. Arnold, dear and generous friend! I owe the power of keeping my husband's secret, not-withstanding an event that promised to betray it. The poor little one was lately taken ill, and his death ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry moment expected. It was that (oh Nature!) made me write the disordered scrawl, which intreated Emma to forbear her visit. On my reaching the house of our worthy Caroline. I found the cold hand of death lay heavy on my child. I wept sore I offered up the prayer of the desolate widow, not <HI>wholly</HI> to bereave me; and begged (ah, how earnestly) the Blessed God to restore <HI>one</HI> or receive <HI>both</HI>!</P>
<P>My prayer was heard. My child grew well. Your letter came in the warmest, newest, and most melting moment of matron extacy. The smile of the babe was in my eye, and in my heart. I saw miniatur'd forth the features of the murdered Edward. Oh the beautiful extreme of rapture! It grew too big for bearing. I de∣voured my child with kisses. I ran with weeping joy to Mrs.

<P>Edward, the <HI>infant</HI> Edward, sleeps as I write this. His gentle breathing is as the music of the spheres to his mother's ear. Ah, had there been a pause — a stop — an <HI>eternal</HI> stop in that harmony, what should I have done? But he lives, and I will not murmur. Oh for health to rear his tender youth.

<P>THE irresolute note which I sent this morning to your chamber, is not worth your attempting to decypher. I wanted to express my sympathy of your present misfortune in a way more answerable to the emotions of my friendship. I wished to gather such knowledge of some persons <HI>connected with your loss.</HI> as might enable me to plan some pious fraud to relieve your situation with∣out wounding your delicacy. But I should make bungling work of it, and destroy the felicity I intended to promote. I am a man of plain feelings, and have no dexterity of address when it is ne∣cessary to adorn them. Accept then, dear Corbett, of an honest mind, in lieu of elegant manners. Is any decoration necessary to introduce a friendly circumstance? — and if there is not, where∣fore do I thus lengthen the preface?</P>
<P>Corbett, I am one of those whom the world calls an unthrifty fellow: for I value money merely as it conduces to my happiness. My happiness depends on society, and not on myself alone, I have fixed it in the dear domestic circle that encloses Emma and her father. Beyond that barrier I do not desire to wander; and if I can promote their felicity, my own will, of necessity, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> compleat.

chance I am become rich, you know. The sum I possess is too much to be dissipated, and not enough if I had a passion to accumulate. It is quite sufficient to render three persons happy, so far as happiness takes its colour from money. Amongst three persons then let it be divided; but let only two of those know the source by which the third is supplied. You may easily persuade Emma to believe, (what indeed will be true) that by an unexpected turn, your losses are repaired. She will be too much rejoiced at the event to teaze herself about the means. Or, if she <HI>should</HI> en∣quire, her curiosity is of a tender kind, and will readily be pacified. I hope you love me too well to make scruples; and yet I shall pre∣pare myself to combat them. It is really a very hard and mortify∣ing thing, that these <HI>bare-weight</HI> duties betwixt friend and friend, should be so rare as to make the offer of them a matter of embar∣rassment; as if there were nothing expected in society but its etiquette and professions. All I desire is, that you will lose no time in settling your affairs▪ and no otherwise remember the <HI>mode</HI> by which they are accomodated, than as it may impress your bosom with tender sensations, and strengthen the cement of that alliance which is formed between us.

<P>Corbett is now as much recovered in health as in his circumstan∣ces, and word is just brought that Emma is better.

<P>FREDERICK, I have again beheld the source of my admirati∣on and distress. She came: she sat at table: said a few words in a silver voice: sighed softly, and retired. I never beheld any "mortal mixture of earth's mould" so touchingly sweet. She is more interesting as she is less in her bloom. Sorrow has taken the rose out of her cheek, and left only the lily, which seems charm∣ingly to lament the loss of its companion. She rises every moment upon me; and sickness, which has weakened <HI>her frame,</HI> appears to have given strength to <HI>my affection.</HI> My wishes are augmented, but my expectations are not advanced.

<P>THESE transitions are almost too much for me — but I wel∣come the dear agitating stroke that gives felicity to my father.

<P>SOON after breakfast this morning, while Corbett and I were walking in the garden, he took hold of my hand, and laying it to his breast, said, "Now, Sir Robert, is the time: my daughter is recovered. Take an opportunity to display your ge∣nerous attatchment. [Faith, Frederick, I do not see the gene∣rosity of trying to possess a fine young woman.] I will give you an opportunity, (continued Mr. Corbett) and pray Heaven it be in her power to give you the possession of her hand and her heart!" —</P>
<P>IN CONTINUATION.</P>
<P>Mr. Corbett informs me that Emma is now gone into the library, She is, he says, all <HI>tenderness</HI> to day. It is then the crisis of de∣claration; the season in most proper to speak; and I think I was ne∣ver more <HI>unfit</HI> for the undertaking. O that I were younger, hand∣somer, less rich, and more engaging. Indeed, I wish most of those things altered, with which, till I beheld Emma Corbett, I was perfectly satisfied. Not a syllable, however, of Henry falls from her. Surely that looks wells. At what a twig doth the drowning catch! I will not close this letter till I can add to it the particulars of our conference.</P>
<P>—</P>
<P>IN CONTINUATION.</P>
<P>It is past. It is decided. I have read my fate, without di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my condition. I entered the library, and found Emma— <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> shall I describe to you the situation in which I found her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> had been observing the ravages of war, as they are figured i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the prints which are hung around the room. I saw the tears still stand∣ing in her eyes. O those eyes!</P>
<P>And what has been the matter, Emma, said I?</P>

<P>"O Sir Robert, behold the images of conquest and defeat! Observe two mighty hosts of human beings met together, after the most deliberate plans of attack, to butcher one another—to per∣petrate <HI>generally</HI> that very crime which, in any <HI>particular</HI> instance, is punished by the retaliation of a shameful death. To destroy an individual is ignominy; but at the massacre of an army, the trum∣pet sounds its note of boldest triumph The gallows and the hal∣ter, the awful trial or gloomy dungeon preceding these, are pre∣pared for him, who, in the phrenzy of passion, or the raging of desire, deprives the irritating object of farther <HI>power</HI> to torment; while the laurel and the bay contribute to the garland of <HI>those he∣roes,</HI> who, after returning from the cities they have depopulated, and the territories they have laid waste, come exulting home in all the honours of blood and of slaughter—</P>
<P>She paused a moment. A glow of generous scorn was in her eye, and she again extended her white arm along the picture, and proceeded.</P>
<P>"Here, sir, you may observe, lawful and <HI>glory-crowned murder,</HI> exhibited in every form. See — see, into that wretch's quivering side, the ball has just entered! — Here lies a head severed from the body. — There are the mangled reliques of an arm torn from the shoulder; and there the wounded horses are trampling upon their wounded masters!</P>
<P>"Rights — territories — and privileges, disputed or invaded, are the great justifications! Poor, puer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le, and insufficient!</P>

Into what ridiculous portions of ideal property art thou cut out? How art thou quarrelled, how contended for? How often doth the bounteous sun that shines up∣on thy surface to expand the grain, and to cherish thy various productions —Oh, how often <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o his beams retire, and leave thy verdant mantle dipt in gore! Yet thou hast <HI>thyself,</HI> (improvident mother of these wrangling emmets) thou hast <HI>thyself</HI> been, in some measure, accessary to these horrors. Oh! that pernicious and fas∣cinating <HI>dross</HI> that glows within thee!

A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arice and ambition are of the same family, and assist the vices of each other: the one delights in the plunder, the other in the havock by which it is obtained.</P>

<P>Oh, Mr. Berkley, what remains? She has rescued me from the misery of a declaration at least. Her own passion is hopeless, yet fixed; but mine is in despair.

<P>WE are returned to town. The several inclosures will ac∣quaint you with the aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cting transactions which have pas∣sed since the last stop in our correspondence — a stop, my dear Louisa, made in very <HI>sympathy:</HI> for, though you have of late re∣peatedly told me that you found a pathetic kind of pleasure in sharing griefs so congenial to your own, I could not but blush at the pain which I must often have created you. Yet nature, at this very time — poor feeble nature, strongly prompts me to repeat the fault. My heart swells high with sorrow, and I stand in need of the participating Louisa. Nor will any <HI>but</HI> Louisa soothe me. Mrs Arnold is generous and sensible, elegant and informed, but▪ oh! she has not drank so largely of that bitter, yet salutary cup which subdues the effervescence of the spirit, and disposes us to melt at the miseries of another. She is a widow without knowing the value of her husband, and love seems a secondary passion in her mind to that of glory.</P>
<P>How is it, my friend, that we do not hear from Henry? Ah, what an affecting difference betwixt a post-office and a ship!</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="017678_0078_0FA21F52C2A6E4E0"/>O <HI>distance,</HI> DISTANCE, it is now I begin to feel what thou art! Join, I conjure you, Louisa, the prayer of Emma — supplicate the power at whose commands the winds and the waves are still, — supplicate him in behalf of a hapless woman, whose treasure is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ing on a precarious sea. Beseech that the hospitable barks may salute each other, and that their separation may alleviate mine. Im∣plore that these things be granted, and my heart shall be at rest.</P>
<P>— At rest! and will my alarms be hushed by such a circum∣stance? Are the beatings of the <HI>billows</HI> all I have to fear? Alas, the perils of the water are m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rely introductory to those of the land. Scarce will the dangers of the flood be past, ere those of the field come on. Which way then shall my petition be directed? The policy of nations, and the dictates of nature, the voice of ambition, and that of peace, are so distinct, that a perpetual war seems to be proclaimed between <HI>divine</HI> and <HI>human</HI> institutions. The tender and graceful interest which nature bids us take in the fate of those whose lives and fortunes are dear to us, make us wish well to the natives of our country, and the friends of our heart: and it is on this prin∣ciple, but not for the parade of dominion, or the barbarian flush of victory, that I wish well to the cause of Henry and his associates — I do not say COUNTRYMEN, for it appears that we are at war with these, as <HI>they</HI> with us: a large and once <HI>loving</HI> family divided against itself. Whom are <HI>we,</HI> Louisa, to consider then as enemy, and whom as friend? WE suffer, alas! bitterly, from the con∣test on either side.</P>
<P>Oh, God of tranquility! heal up the <HI>mutual</HI> wound, and suffer not that which is terrible between <HI>different</HI> people, even in <HI>hostile</HI> nations, to become more intolerably so by allowing it to rage a∣mongst <HI>brethren!</HI></P>
<P>The paths of military honour, Louisa, are cut through the bowels of humanity; and heroism laughs at the apostrophe of pity: but I, who want refinement to extinguish the simplicity of my sen∣sations, shall yet persist to call even <HI>victory</HI> a calamity.</P>

<P>I WILL not affect to misconceive you, my only parent. You seem constantly anxious to connect me with some worthy man, as the associate of my life; yet do not recollect that my choice is made, my principles fixed, and my heart <HI>inalienably</HI> engaged. An unsubdued veneration for truth attends me. I caught the in∣spiring affection I bear her, from the respectable authors of my being. It is a prejudice as early as it is amiable, and you should not wonder if I walk steadily in the way of my directors. This, sir, I have often told you. I have been brought up to consider the happiness of life, not as deducible from the maxims of the world, but from implicit reliance upon that power whom Heaven has seated upon the throne of the soul, as an un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ring judge in all cases of moral arbitration. It has been a hard task for me to struggle with the various inflictions which have long hung over our house, and though the burst of nature has sometimes broken unawares, it was not in <HI>those</HI> seasons that I was the most unhappy. — When only the pitying eye of GOD was upon me, when I sought the silent corner, and could secretly commune with my own heart, and en∣ter into all its inclinings: then — <HI>then,</HI> my father, it was that the extreme of your Emma's wretchedness came over her; for she found it impossible to wean her affections from an object, one so entirely and with so good reason approved, and now so entirely, and (you will pardon me) without any solid reasons, rejected. I have not, at this period, my dearest father, collection of mind enough for much argument; but you will please to recollect that it was you who first kindled the sparks of tenderness for Henry. Besides that we were brought up together, when gentle impressions are easily ad∣mitted and u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reservedly avowed, you represented him as an orphan of honour, talents, and good sense. I depend on every thing you say, and was charmed with a sentiment correspondent to my own. The affection was full grown, and had expanded into blossom, ere you attempted to destroy, or even to check it. Then, <HI>all at once,</HI> you said you had your reasons, (which to this hour remain partly unexplained) to desire I would think no more of Henry Hammond:
<PB N="33" REF="017678_0081_0FA21F554B94DFD0"/>
yet, you averred, it was not fortune or any other circumstance re∣lating to what to the world calls <HI>a good match,</HI> that created a change in your esteem. Want of <HI>worth,</HI> I am sure, it <HI>could not</HI> be; and yet you still persist to d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssuade me from attaching myself to merit, elegance, and virtue.</P>
<P>I am glad this method of addressing each other by letter, though in the same house, has, by accident, been adopted It appeared awkward at first, but hath now the familiarity of a habit. It may well be said, in <HI>my</HI> case, "to excuse the blush, and pour out all the heart." Yet wherefore do I talk of blushing! Surely, it is not necessary. I yield not to any romantic pomps of passion. I make it not a subject, where it can be likely to create one discord∣ant feeling. I love with simplicity and truth: and it is far beyond my power—far, even as the preservation of a solemn vow is from the breach of it, to change my object but with a change of its purity. The oaths that are taken at the altar, Sir, may <HI>ratify</HI> tenderness, but cannot <HI>create</HI> it: and amongst the sordid connecti∣ons of men, it is not uncommon to be inv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sted with the public sanction, without ever receiving a private assent from the under∣standing or the heart. I do not think the law of the land, of it∣self, sufficient to make a woman happy. Marriage is a very hon∣ourable, but it may be a very miserable institution: that is, it may produce misery while it confers honour. The <HI>ceremony</HI> is only the <HI>seal</HI> of mutual love, but the <HI>bond</HI> should be mad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> before; and in point of attachment I hold myself at this moment as religiously united to Henry as if all the forms of the earth had pass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d my lips in confirmation. The same idea will be lodged in my bosom, whether that confirmation be remote or near. It is not intended by Heaven to be the affection of a year only. It is to last for life. It is to follow its object through all perils and dangers. Its holy ardour is to burn equally bright and pure, and nothing but death is to extinguish it. Thus contracted, my father, in spirit and in truth, you will easily j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dge how light must be the sacrifice of my cousin's strange legacy. The <HI>political</HI> tenets of Mr. Hammond have nothing to do with my friendship for him. As they have carried him into a dangerous path of life, far from <HI>me,</HI> I so far de∣plore them. I chose not the <HI>officer;</HI> but the <HI>man!</HI> and though it is, alas, but too unlikely that our <HI>personal</HI> interests should be made <HI>one,</HI> yet the union of our souls is too sincere, and too strong, for five and twenty times the conditional five thousand pounds to loosen or dissolve. I felt myself about to declare that not <HI>any</HI> earthly motive could induce me to embrace this gorgeous bribe: but I am suddenly checked, and find, upon scrutiny into this filial bosom, O my dear <HI>dear</HI> father, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>one</HI> motive, and <HI>only one</HI> tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <HI>might</HI> have been, which could make your Emma <HI>the victim of money.</HI></P>
<P>Had the late convulsions of fortune remained in their full force —had it pleased God to <HI>increase</HI> their violence—had all that could have been raised by the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds of property and industry proved insuf∣ficient—and had those venerable ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s been <HI>inaeed</HI> consigned to sor∣row,
<PB N="34" REF="017678_0082_0FA21F56035149F8"/>
and none but a <HI>daughter's</HI> duteous hand to help a parent's poverty; in that dire case, my beloved father, if you have a true sense of my nature, you will guess what I should have been tempt∣ed to do. I should have accepted the conditions in the codicil, and secured to my father a resource from indigence at a time of his life when humanity is the least able to bear it. I would <HI>not</HI> then have "married an officer engaged in the national contest." Yet even <HI>then,</HI> my affection would remain, though its ultimate views would be changed.</P>
<P>In the private recesses of my soul, the image of Henry would still be engraved; and, although I sacrificed all that was possible or necessary, to duty, it would be long, very long, ere I could withdraw that chaste and charming sentiment which gives me in all transitions, a title to esteem—ah more than esteem—to <HI>love—him tenderly.</HI></P>

injured — she is aggrieved, my daughter. Her oppressions are at my heart. The strings that fix it to my bosom are trembling for her. She glows with a generous love of freedom. She has been condemned without a hearing. She was stabbed into resistance. The sword was held to her throat ere she thought of selfdefence. Conflagration, famine, and parricide, have entered her late peaceful habitations. The common bounties of Providence have been denied her. The blood of citizens, of brothers, and of friends, are flowing in rivers through her streets.</P>
<P>I have not, Emma, been one of those who hawk about my principles, and saunter in babbling ignorance from coffee-house to coffee-house. I am <HI>fixed</HI> in <HI>my</HI> politicks, and think my steady adhe∣rence to them a part of my <HI>religion.</HI> Since we are cruelly taught to make a sanguinary mark of distinction between an Englishman and an American, I own myself the latter, and deplore the infirmities that prevent me from rushing to the field.

I enter deeply, and pathetically, into every wrong which America sustains, It is the only point wherein I am enthusiastic, and it is the only point where enthusiasm is great and glorious!

High of heart, he scorned to be even <HI>tenderly</HI> controuled. I endeavoured to win him generously over to an honourable cause. He called it insult, bribery, baseness. The military distraction was throbbing in every vein. When I argued, he justified every measure of ministry. <HI>Great Britain,</HI> he said, was grossly abused — her lenity scorned — her laws defi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d — her sublime prerogative contemptously set at nought. He spoke loud and vehement of American <HI>rebellion.</HI> The honour of the empire, he said, now depended on the exertion of each individual, and it was the duty of every young man (whom every tie of interest, every bond of loyalty, and every principle of policy called upon) to manifest his zeal, his courage, and his attachment. He went on, my child, in all the foaming folly of youth, declaring, that he should ac∣count himself b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, were he to deny the <HI>contribution</HI> of his arm. The greater his love for <HI>Emma,</HI> the nobler his <HI>sacrifice,</HI> he said.

<P>I HAVE a suspicion that Mr. Hammond is wounded; let that circumstance, oh my father, account to you for the horrors of mind which have for some days locked up every power of hand and of voice. The former faculty is in some measure restored, so far at least, as tremblingly to trace upon paper something like an an∣swer to your affecting favour; every syllable of which is as an en∣venomed arrow fixing in my bosom. Your determined objection then to poor Henry is at last accounted for. I thought the sanguine track of party was washed wholly from a father's heart by the blood of my brother. Shall political prejudices interrupt the finest affec∣tions of humanity? Horrid is the aspect of battle, view it on ei∣ther side. It cannot shift to an attitude, nor take <HI>one position,</HI> to soften its terrors upon the reflecting <HI>mind.</HI> TO THAT it is uni∣formly odious; nor is it at all amended by considering, that as it began soon after the <HI>creation,</HI> it will scarcely end till the destruc∣tion of the world. It has, even within the narrow precincts of <HI>our</HI> family, divided the son from the father, and the lover from his mistress; let it not be rendered <HI>more</HI> dire by setting the interest of the daughter against that of her most honour'd parent, since <HI>that</HI> would be to encourage the madness of mortals, and the civil pesti∣lence, that, in the form of a <HI>family-war,</HI> is gone forth against us. It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould violate the gentle law of nature, and tear down those conciliating ties which fasten <HI>kindred</HI> in one vast chain of connexion ample as earth, and beautiful as Heaven. You have painted your own patriotism and that of Henry, sir, with equal vigour of lang∣uage; at least, you have said enough either way to prove that <HI>both</HI> fancy the <HI>cause adopted</HI> is the cause of rectitude and glory. When one side attacks, the other must naturally defend; on which ac∣count, while the spirit of contention remains, some will vehe∣mently censure the very measures which some as vehement∣ly
<PB N="42" REF="017678_0090_0FA21F5E0D8B29C0"/>
applaud. But, in avowing your own enthusiasm, my dear fa∣ther, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not, in effect, justify that of Henry? You both seem to hug to your bosoms a political Cleopatra, for whose sake you are willing to gain or to lose a world. England is to Henry what America is to you. Each insists that he is espousing the cause of an injured friend: and while this is the case, how can it be expected that <HI>either</HI> should yield? In fact, would not such a concession, ac∣cording to the prescriptions of <HI>honour,</HI> in this world's acceptation of the word, be accounted base? You have, you say, attempted to direct the sword of Henry on the better side of the dispute. <HI>Which is</HI> that better side? Henry declares for Britain; you for America. What third person shall decide between you? The feeble voice of a woman will neither be heard or admitted. Else, might she venture to assert that your countrymen are bleeding a∣broad, while the point of right and wrong is adjusting at home. This, however, is clear, my dear father, from your own premises: if Henry thought himself insulted by the proposal of changing his side, <HI>you</HI> would have been no less stung, had a similar proposition come from <HI>him</HI> to <HI>you.</HI> And this proves, that both are acting on what is called patriotic principle. What right reason then has the one to be displeased with the other? Yet upon this displeasure on your part, you urge me to withdraw my vows. Are then virtu∣ous resolutions so to be withdrawn, my father? When affection is fashioned by the feelings, and long cherished in a soul which nei∣ther projects nor practises any ill, whose every thought is submitted to the holy criticism of Heaven, nor ever dreads the scrutiny — is it, under these circumstances, of a texture so convenient, as to shift from side to side with every gale of opinion? Wherefore, let me once again tenderly enquire, wherefore did you originally in∣spire me with a veneration for sober reason? why infuse in me a steady and generous way of thinking? Was it designed for orna∣ment or for use? If not intended as the <HI>governing rule of conduct,</HI> thro' every maze of this mortal pilgrimage, oh wherefore did you not at <HI>first,</HI> even in the nursery, while every power was impressive and would have taken the form you chose to give it —wherefore <HI>then</HI> did you not lead me into the path that I was to tread without stop or turning? Alas! you have given me fixed principles, acknowledged they were good, saw them with joy take root in my heart, and now you expect in their fullest growth, and finest foli∣age, that they should suddenly perish. But the habits of my youth are grown so strong, that I feel it is too late for me to deal in dis∣guises. I will not now begin an artificial character. Oh! suffer me to implore you, sir, to continue my attachment to Truth and Nature. I know nothing of State wrangles, or Congress quarrels. I mix not with the infuriate errors of party. I only act up to those simple principles of moral life, which assure me that constancy in favour of a <HI>known valuable object</HI> (not obstinate predilection to a <HI>bad one</HI>) is the basis on which the superstructure of all that is noble, just, and good, must be raised. My wisdom is extremely limited. It stretches not into those maxims which desolate the earth for a

vapour of victory, nor does it presume to penetrate the scheme of government. All it <HI>does</HI> pretend to, belongs to that small and dear system in which every woman ought to be instructed; namely, that a <HI>well-fixed tenderness</HI> should never be removed, that it should brave the storms of fortune and distress, that while life remains it should be the animating <HI>purpose</HI> of life to <HI>cultivate</HI> it, and that death, and death <HI>only,</HI> should dissolve the bonds which virtue had made. If my beloved father would for one moment lay the clamorous conten∣tions of a bickering species aside, and submit to be charmed by that dispassionate power which decides calmly of truth and fals∣hood, he would be convinced of this. I am sure he would: for his nature is gentle and his heart is soft. Ah think wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a task it is for your soul-sick Emma to be under the necessity of using these pleadings at <HI>such a time!</HI> Come to her bed-side — perhaps the cause of <HI>our</HI> disputes may now —</P>
<P>Oh for pity my father, hasten to me — aid me in this dreadful conflict — rescue me from myself — wipe away the bitterest tear that anguish ever drew from the heart of a daughter, and recover me, ere it be yet too late, from the arms of death.</P>

<HEAD><HI>MOMUS;</HI> or the <HI>LAUGHING PHILOSOPHER.</HI> The <HI>HUMOURS</HI> of a <HI>WET SUNDAY,</HI> near <HI>LONDON.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HAVING dined with a friend a few Sundays ago, at his villa within a few miles of London, I was, on my return home, overtaken by a violent shower, and obliged to put up at the first public house I met with upon the road. While I was there watch∣ing the weather from a window, that I might seize a favourable moment to pursue my journey, without being in a dripping con∣dition, I was not a little amused with a collection of draggled fe∣males; who, with their loving husbands, &amp;c. were driven, by the torrents pouring upon their heads, to shelter themselves under the same roof.</P>
<P>"Lord have mercy upon me!" exclaimed a woman of the larg∣est size, and rendered still more weighty by her corpulence, "Lord have mercy upon me!" wiping her face, which shone like a cook-maid's, with her apron, "I am sure this is making a toil of a pleasure; here we labour and take pains all the week, on purpose to have a little comfort on a Sunday, and now you see, I shall spoil every <HI>individual</HI> thing about me; besides, I am so fatigued into the bargain: but I told my husband this very morning, that I would never set out again without a coach, or <HI>shay,</HI> or something to car∣ry me."</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="017678_0092_0FA21F62449A3900"/>"You're in the right of it," replied her friend, a tall, raw-boned woman, with her mouthful of pins, with which she was en∣deavouring to pin up her petticoat; "I am sure, I will not slave myself to death again for all the pleasure upon earth; and yet I'll not sit at home all day neither."</P>
<P>"What's that you won't do?" said a poor meagre, half starved fellow, who was by this time come up to them with a heavy child on each arm. "I am sure you have not the reason to complain I have, who have carried the boys so many miles; — you are never satisfied; but you shall carry them yourself the rest of the way, or leave them behind."</P>
<P>Here, being hardly able to stand with his incumbrances, he was going to throw off his load; — his rib then called out to him in a raised, but not in a very melodious voice, "Don't offer to set my children down, don't, I say; do you think I will have their coats wetted, and their frocks dirtied? Who must clean them? Not you, I suppose, you will tell me, like a sneaking devil as you are; but come what will, please God, you shall stand at the wash tub till you drop; for I will see them all <HI>got up,</HI> to cure you of drag∣ging me home upon my feet: and now we are brought into this precious pickle, I wonder what is to become of us."</P>
<P>"Oh, (replied her unwieldly neighbour) we must stay till we can light of a coach; and in the mean time let us call for some∣thing.—What do you like best, Ma'm?"</P>
<P>"You may call for what you please, (answered the distressed husband, interrupting her) but then you must pay for it, as I have not a single sixpence left out of my whole week's wages — 'tis all gone."</P>
<P>"Gone?" cries his glamorous lady; "gone? Why, then, if we <HI>should</HI> have the good luck to meet with a <HI>shay</HI> or a coach, we must be wet to the skin, because you have no money to pay for it."</P>
<P>"No; but <HI>you</HI> have," replied he, "for I gave you every penny that I received last right, and did not even keep back enough for a single pot of porter: I am sure, I drank nothing but Adam's ale after my bread and cheese before I went to bed, which has made me as weak as a rat."</P>
<P>"Weak?" said she, "weak with drinking water? That's a <HI>good one,</HI> indeed! I am sure there is not a wholesomer liquor in the world."</P>
<P>"Then I wonder, my dear," answered he, with an arch look, "that <HI>you</HI> drink so much strong beer yourself."</P>
<P>"I drink strong beer? Aye, and so I do, or else how should I be able to suckle my two twins, God help me! As women go through so much in this world, they had need of something to sup∣port them; but men are always grudging them, and taking every thing for themselves."</P>
<P>"Zounds! what ails the woman," exclaimed the provoked hus∣band, "with her grudging? Didn't I give you all?"</P>
<P>"Yes, and then went and run up a long score at the <HI>Black Dog</HI>; so we shall not have a farthing left to pay our rent."</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="017678_0093_0FA21F6336C6A8C8"/>"Why, we cannot eat our cake and have it," said he; "you wanted to come a pleasuring, and let's hear no more about it."</P>
<P>The waiter now made his appearance with a bowl of punch, and a plate of cold boiled beef; and by so doing put a stop to their al∣tercation, as they all fell to as if they had not eaten a morsel that day, they had dined very heartily upon a fillet of veal, and a gam∣mon of bacon, and greens, at an <HI>Ordinary</HI> at <HI>Hammersmith,</HI> and dispatched a large quantity of stout beer, with a pot of tea, and several plates of bread and butter.</P>
<P>The present refreshment put them into a tolerable humour. The mother of the twins took them by turns to the breast, while the father of them sat down in the corner of the room to rest himself till the rain was over.</P>
<P>When he began to think of setting off for the capital, the huge-waisted lady said to his wife, in a whisper, "If you will lend me enough to discharge the reckoning, I will treat in return next Sun∣day."</P>
<P>While this affair was agitating in one part of the room, a smart altercation was carried on in another, between a lover and his mistress, who had just been caught in the shower, and were dry∣ing themselves over a pot of coffee. The lady was drest in the very extremity of the fashion; her hair was stretched to above twice the length of her face; her hat was quite narrow before, and im∣mensely broad behind; her <HI>Polonese</HI> was tied up with the most ele∣gant air imaginable; and she had a pretty little foot just covered with a white slipper with a purple rose, heel, and binding. — <HI>He</HI> had his hand on her shoulder, and <HI>she</HI> was putting som<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sugar into his cup, when a returned post-chaise drove up to the door. "There is a carriage," said she briskly, "let us secure it."—Away ran he, but soon came b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck. "Well," said the lady, "will he wait?" "Wait!" replied the lover; "I did not ask him, as he will not carry us to London under half a guinea; he is no common driver, it is a Lord's carriage." "Well, and if my Lord was here," an∣swered she, "he would be happy to have my company upon any terms; and so you have let him go, rather than give such a paltry sum to accommodate <HI>me</HI>; but I shall not walk, I assure you, nor draggle my petticoats like the wives of your dirty mechanics, I did not attach myself to <HI>you,</HI> but to enjoy all the pleasures of life; yet you are so scandalously mean, as to deny me the common con∣veniencies: but I will leave you—I could not be used worse if I was married." —Here she flounced out of the room, and I presently saw her drive off with an officer in his <HI>phaeton,</HI> in which she certainly must have been half drowned, as the rain continued to come down with great violence; and the captain was too genteel to have a top to his chaise, out of which she was afterwards thrown by his driv∣ing too near a post just at the entrance into London, by which acci∣dent both her leg and arm were broken.</P>
<P>The curious <HI>trio</HI> above mentioned having thoroughly lined their insides, set out on foot, and became quite regardless of their out∣sides; but their expences had been so heavy, and the reparations
<PB N="46" REF="017678_0094_0FA21F63F6C23040"/>
of the damages which their cloaths had sustained made such breach∣es in their pockets, that they were obliged not only to work harder than usual during the following week, but to deny themselves some of the lowest necessaries of life; yet all their labour and oeconomy would not enable them to make an other excursion when the next <HI>Sunday</HI> arrived; and as that Sunday happened to be a remarkably <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ne one, they spent it in quarrelling —because they could not <HI>en∣joy</HI> it, by <HI>abusing</HI> it.</P>

<HEAD>AN EXTRAORDINARY LOVE-LETTER, From <HI>Mr. PETER PLAINMAN</HI> to <HI>Miss PRISCILLA PRUDISH.</HI> [Taken from a genuine Copy.]</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM a little afraid you and I shall never come together. There is that expectation of flattery about you that I cannot bear. Yet as I love you well enough to be honest — a bold word that — I will once for all speak my mind, and I desire your attention. I believe I do not admire you or value you for any one of those charms for which you admire and value yourself. I do not, for instance pay any adoration to the present brightness of your eyes, because I am so strange a fellow as to consider them philosophical<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y. They are very brilliant, to be sure; but what are they? What are they, Madam, <HI>ab origine?</HI> Fops, Fools, and Poets would, in their usual airy manner, tell you, that they were made of celes∣tial fire, that they were two animated balls of beauty, two love-darting mirrors formed by the graces, and a pack of such fluff: But I scorn to figure away at the expence of fair truth. I write in honest prose, Madam, and therefore in honest prose I tell you, that those same balls of etherial beauty, those same love-darting mirrors, are at best two pieces of ordinary clay varnished. The varnish, I allow, is good, and well put on; thanks to the sound health of the father that begot you, and the mother who bore you; But what of all this? I am not such a short-sighted, amorous pup∣py, but I can look forward alittle beyond the length of my nose, to the time when the gloss will all be worn away, when the japan of Nature will be utterly gone, and the devil a spark of fire will you have about you. If you live long enough, you will be purblind, and then what becomes of your love-darters? Don't be quite so vain, my young beauty. Another mighty matter upon which you have, it seems, to pique yourself, is your face; I mean such things as we call cheeks, lips, and complexion. I wish it to be known to you, that I have but a very poor opinion of these divine graces, as you call them. Some time ago, I remember you shewed me, in a great air of triumph, a paper scrawled upon by some storid puppy of your acquaintance, who swore, in very sorry verses, that your cheeks threw into utter despair all the lillies and roses in the crea∣tion; your skin too, was, if I recollect, polished marble; the veins were compared to the azure of the third Heaven, and the colour was whiter than alabaster. 'Tis a lie, PRISCILLA, 'tis a sad lie;
<PB N="47" REF="017678_0095_0FA21F64C590E570"/>
you are indebted to poetical fiction for all this trash: the rogues who deal in it have, as they tell us, a licence from that si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly fellow APOLLO, to play such pranks with idle girls and boys who believe them. For my part, I never could be taken in by the tag of a rhime, nor the cadence of a couplet, nor the transposition of ten saucy syllables, since I was born; I always looked upon them as mere ear-traps. What a collection of falsities is here, indeed! I never saw a pair of cheeks in my life, that were fairer than a lilly, nor a pair of lips that were redder than a rose. As to alabaster, I will take upon me to say, there never was a woman's skin half so white in the whole world; and I should be very glad to see a com∣plexion so well polished as a piece of Egyptian marble. No, no; these flights won't pass upon men of cool prose. They won't in∣deed, PRISCILLA; upon my soul they won't. Metaphor, meta∣phor, my dear, is a mere bam; it tickles the child's ear; but I heartily despise it. Not but that I give to a fine form its proper portion of praise. I am perfectly sensible to handsome features▪ I like to see the proper proportions of red and white: I am very well pleased with a sparkling pair of eyes; but I have no idea of calling any of these what they really are not, nor of comparing them with objects to which they have no likeness whatever. For instance now, your bosom is said to be purer than the driven snow: If that isn't carrying the jest as far as it will fairly go, I don't know what is. Snow, quoth'e— Why, Madam, if a snow-ball and your bosom were shewn together, and any thing in the world but a poet to be the judge, he would say that you were a swarthy gip∣sey in the comparison. But how you ladies can be pleased with all this high flying is to me astonishing,—Zoon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Priscilla, how can this be? If a man was to compare me to a stick or a stone, or a tree or a plant, that I was no more like than I am like the main ocean, should I perk up my head, and look about me the more for that? As to features, skin, complexion, &amp;c. they are so tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> things of today, that if I was a woman, I should be afraid to put any trust in them. They have more enemies than the ever-per∣secuted have. I could recount such a catalogue as would make
<Q><L>Your hair to stand an end,</L>
<L>Like quills upon the fretful por<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pine.</L></Q>
Go into your garden — fix your attention on the fairest flower▪ take care that it is in the luxuriance of its bloom. Did you ever behold tints more exquisite, scollops more exact, colours better mixed, or beauties better varied? Now leave it. Pay it a second visit to morrow morning. What are you surprised at? That a flower should fade! A slight blast of wind in the night hath whol∣ly destroyed it; the tints are dead; the colours are faded; the beauty is no more. Step now to your toilette. Indeed, Priscilla, you are very pretty: What a face, what an air, what a shape! In the evening one of the thousand enemies of handsome features overtakes you, and your second visit to the mirror shews— an ugly woman. I believe you have wit enough to see whereto all this tends— it tends, Priscilla, to your instruction. I would not have
<PB N="48" REF="017678_0096_0FA21E7F75317A38"/>
you fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> too violent a dependence upon features. Nor do I, Pris∣cilla, e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>timate you according to your wealth: Certain it is, old Prudish, your father, left you rich; but I wish you were not so fascinated with these possessions. I heard you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in such raptures of a new coach, and new diamonds, that I am <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uch afraid you are far gone in the <HI>frippe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies</HI> of life. A slight fever would soon shew you the impotency of gold, and it would divest of all the trappings in which you have wantonly dressed the finest fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of horses in the universe. Every thing I have mentioned is held on a sad tenure, even the tenure of a regular pulse. I think there is under all your false ideas a <HI>good heart</HI>; 'tis this, Priscilla, which draws me towards you. I think I could banish the frailties that cling at present about your affections. If you can bear me after this letter, I shall have a better opinion of you than ever: If you are offended, and take pet at it, I shall lose you, it is true; but then I shall know by experience, that your love was not worth seeking. I know we should live very happy together, if you would but comply with my terms. They are neither difficult nor various: 1st. Break your looking glass. 2d. Turn all your poets out of doors. 3dly. Throw their verses into the fire; and, lastly, Make a solemn vow never more to put your trust in <HI>metaphors</HI> and <HI>comparisons,</HI> two cursed things which have done more injury to young women than libertinism itself. What say you, will you agree to these conditions, and take to your bosom, without ei∣ther lace on his coat, poetry in his head, or <HI>puppyism</HI> at his heart,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XCIX. TO EMMA CORBETT.</HEAD>
<P>UNgrateful Emma! perverse and insensate child! You merit neither the pangs you cost me, nor the tenderness you re∣ceive from me, I gave you a reason cogent enough to have weaned a <HI>worthy</HI> girl from a thousand Hammonds. To that I might have added the sudden departure of a generous friend, who I <HI>now</HI> tell you (for I <HI>can</HI> hold no longer) would have laid his fortune at your feet. This, indeed, you must have seen, since nothing but the most extreme stupidity could remain ignorant of those attentions which, for many weeks past, have been lavished upon you by Sir Robert Raymond, a man, oh inconsiderate! who saved thy aged father in the very crisis of his misfortunes; and, too delicate to de∣mand as a debt the tender returns of love, which he would have sued for as a favour, is gone, almost broken-hearted, away. I had promised to <HI>conceal</HI> his confidence, but you extort it from me: nay, you continue still to doat upon the wretch who is fighting against all the best and dearest connexions of your family. I will not en∣dure it. You assume the language of decision, and call it the sen∣timent of reason. You set yourself up as a judge, and lift your wo∣man's voice against the sacred principles of patriot and parent. It is not to be borne. Let me hear no more on the subject. Cease your threats about daggers, darts, and death. I look DOWN upon such romance. Forbear to urge me. You are not to learn the touches of my temper. <HI>My principles</HI> are not less sacred than <HI>your passion. Your</HI> principles! What are they? Airy nothings. <HI>Mine</HI> are the solemn af∣fections of a lover of his country, and a detester of its oppressors, a <HI>aetester of Henry Hammond!</HI> Why will you drive me to this? I know nothing of his wounds; but if he has <HI>received some,</HI> there is reason to suppose he has <HI>given more:</HI> at least his bloody endeavours cannot have been wanting, and every one is in the bosom of your father's native land. Your affection is that of a girl whimpering after a boy. Is this an affection to be brought in competition with that glorious fire which the love of liberty, and an abhorrence (as set∣tled as it is sublime) of rights usurped and faith broken? Is your pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rile, yet headstrong inclination worthy to be brought into con∣sideration with the passion that fills the breast, and fires the soul, of your affl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cted and off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nded father,</P>

Pity, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pity the anguish of a father — pity a pa∣rent whose persecutions have driven away his child! Emma hath eloped. Heaven knows where she has wandered. Under presence of visiting a friend near town, she went in one of the public stages, with intent, as she said, to return in the evening. The friend whom she <HI>pretended</HI> to visit was Mrs. Arnold of Richmond, on whom she had often called in a neighbourly way. I remained therefore perfectly unalarmed till twilight. A tempest of thunder and lightening happening about nine o'clock, I sent over a servant to Mrs. Arnold's, imagining she might be afraid to come through it alone. The servant returned from Mrs. Arnold with news that Emma called there for a few minutes by way of morning ride, but went away in a great hurry. It was near midnight before I receiv∣ed

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I CLAIM the assistance of a man whom I know to be generous, who honours me with his esteem, and whom I venerate for the ancient friendship that has long united our families. By the pow∣erful force of <HI>all</HI> these feelings, I conjure you, on the receipt of this letter, to visit my father. Assure him that his dear, dear image lives unimpaired in my heart. Tell him that my absenting myself in this manner is not the truant trick of a girl who triumphs in the vexation of a parent, but proceeds from a motive most virtuous, most irresistable, most conscientious — from a duty that appeals to my heart, my senses, and my soul. O let him not think that I <HI>glory</HI> in the necessity which takes me one moment from <HI>him.</HI> I la∣ment, I weep, I mourn over it. I could wish that each duty went hand in hand, and that some of their objects did not lie so wide apart from others. Superior to every deceit, I would have consulted my father even on the present measure, but he will recol∣lect the terror into which his late conversations threw me, and will then be convinced how impossible it was to risque such an ecclair∣cissment▪ Yet even now I will forbear to justify my departure, because I would suffer some reproach myself, rather than try to establish an irregular example. But the Power who is giving me strength to sustain the great business I am about to undertake, has placed in my bosom something which reconciles me to the enter∣prize. Oh Sir Robert, there is a duty which <HI>must</HI> be performed— at least attempted. Nature, reason, honour, and faith the most hallowed, all stir within me; nay God himself, at the marking of whose awful name I bow, seems looking down from his heaven of heavens with approbation. I may seem to be romantic, when I mean only to shew myself sincere. All sort of research will be vain, I would not have yielded to the least semblance of a scheme, which is most terrible to my nature, could it by any means have been avoided. My father will call to mind certain sentiments, and do me justice in his own dear bosom on this occasion.</P>
<P>Sir Robert Raymond, I ever desired to be uniform, and to re∣concile the distinct parts of my conduct with the whole. Yet I will bear up against the charge of impropriety in this one instance for the sake of — but further explanation is unnece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ary. Go then, oh amiable mediator betwixt parent and child — go, and plead my cause in all the eloquence of friendship. Obtain for me the paternal pardon — sustain his heart, and do not leave him a prey to sorrow.</P>
<P>Excuse my forbearing to give you my address. Pity the con∣cealments which are thus imposed. Be it sufficient that I will continue to send you accounts of myself at every opportunity.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CVI. TO SIR R. RAYMOND.</HEAD>
<P>YOUR letter, Sir Robert, with its dear and dreadful inclosure, came to hand. It is now before my eyes, which are stream∣ing in penitence for the phrenzy which has banished my daughter. I now behold the whole matter too plain. Oh, my friend, I treat∣ed the most dutiful of children with unwonted harshness, and in the patriot I extinguished the parent. I expected that a soul like Emma's should circumscribe itself within the pale of politics. Curse on the rage of party! Execrated be the tyrannies of war. Ah what are causes, countries, worlds, to the loss of one dear child, adorned with the virtues of Emma Corbett — Blind, doating zeal: what hast thou to do with an old man's heart? What, with the sacred season of the silver hair? Is mine an age to engage in these tumultuous subjects? No. I should have taken my darling daughter to my bosom, and with an enlarged benevolence prayed fervently for the returning embrace of a divided people. <HI>That</HI> would have been true patriotism and true philanthropy. Instead of which, dolt and dotard as I was, I mixed with hot-headed gid∣diness in the affray. I interested myself in every fugitive breath of vague intelligence; and, while I talked of justice, I was encour∣aging slaughter; wholly forgetting, or too blood-thirsty to remem∣ber, that either army is composed of kindred and of countrymen. Behold Raymond, how I am punished! But where, where all this time is Emma? No date! No address! A young creature un∣friended, alone, of a delicate frame, and harrassed by fatigue! <HI>Sick</HI> also! Never used to travel unattended — Oh heaven! But she will return. The thought makes me easier. Let me indulge it. How tender will I be to her — with what fondness will I hang upon her neck, and hide her blushes in my bosom — how will I talk — how soothe — how console her — oh I will kiss her into confidence and composure. I will even converse — (pardon me Sir Robert, pardon the effusions of a repenting heart) — I will even converse upon her darling theme. — The name of Henry shall be mentioned, and if it does her good, not without tender∣ness, Alas! what has the youth done, but — Yes, yes, Emma will return. She must. She shall. The slender and trembling thread of my being is sustained by no other hope.</P>
<P>I have sent advertisements to the papers, inviting her home, describing person, circumstances, and situations, but concealing names. I have dispatched various messengers to all the ports to have her tenderly intreated, almost cordially <HI>controuled,</HI> should her romantic nature — for oh I suspect she meditates— Was there ever any thing so wild — But she will never be able to carry it into execution, and I will not even suppose it practicable. She will return. I shall recover the treasure of my age. But the interim is anguish — oh, hasten my friend to soften it. I am sick, and Emma is not at my side. I see her not at the harpsichord — I hear not her enchanting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e — I contemplate not her love∣ly

<HEAD>LETTER CXI. E. CORBETT TO HIS FATHER.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER having been thirteen months agonized amongst the wounded, and more than once considered as the prize of death, I am at length able to write a few lines to acquaint you that I exist; by which information, I flatter myself I shall make a father, a sister, and a friend, most happy. The arm and shoul∣der, which were wounded, are at length cured without amputation▪ but the half of the left cheek is gone. These tidings I had caused to be conveyed to England long since, by letters sent at different op∣portunities, by various means of conveyance; but as I have not re∣ceived your replies, I fear either those miscarried, or mine have never reached you. Indeed, war puts a dreadful stop to this branch of communication, although the only one which can re∣lieve the pains of so perilous an absence.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON offers me the means of future retreat and inacti∣vity, in consideration, I suppose, of my scars. But I am now too far engaged to accept this with any honour. I wish it may be no more necessary to fire; and they <HI>talk</HI> indeed of peace, but there is no real prospect of such a blessing being at hand. I fought, at first, in my own defence, and must, I fear, continue to do so still. The English persist to call those cowards whom they prove to be men, and feel to be heroes. To-morrow I shall once more fix the

<P>Wherefore does my old friend Henry stay idling at home,
<Q>"Now half the Youth of Europe are in Arms?"</Q>
Why does he not take one side or the other, as principle directs? He was wont to maintain with me warm disputes in favour of Great-Britain, but by this time his opinion must be changed, and the cause of America must be dear to him, were it only in respect of her youth, her bravery, and her misfortunes. Tell him I should be glad to receive him here — to receive him, in that case, as a brother; and on those conditions, too, we will both return one day or another, and enjoy the fruits of a double marriage; for notwithstanding your resistance, my father, I must still remind you that I have a heart only for Louisa.

<P>ACCIDENT favours me. I trace the footsteps of Emma. I am now in the house from which she lately departed. On my arrival here I overheard some sailors upon the quay reading aloud one of your advertisements, after which two of them swore it must mean the fair-looking boy who lodged a few nights ago at the ship, and sailed in the Henry letter of marque. I caught at this, and am so far rewarded in my enquiry. Farewell. The opportunity of following your child presents itself. Adieu.</P>

<P>OH, Mr. Corbett, the abrupt joy produced by your late intelli∣gence, has counteracted the tender design<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Ed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ard, and thrown his poor Louisa into a condition which makes me tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ble. The settled calm of her mind has long been overthrown, and I, who have been her almost constant companion, can assure you, that when she has thought herself the most tranquil, she has been nearest that state which of all others, in this sorrow-teeming world, is the most affecting. Indeed, sir, you should have been less pre∣cipitate— yet you meant kindly. You acknowledge her for a daughter. It is impossible to tell you in what a style of enthusias∣tic gratitude she speaks of this. All will be well, and yet — soft! she wakes! Oh what a look! how wild! how fearful!

<HEAD>SECOND INCLOSURE FROM SIR R. RAYMOND.</HEAD>
<P>CORBETT, the seal of Providence is surely upon my enter∣prize! Oh happy chance! I have at once saved and res∣cued your daughter. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pleased God to carry me into the same place of confinement, where I found her mingled with the multi∣tude of our unhappy countrymen. A violent shriek upon my en∣trance betrayed her to me. Her man's apparel became no longer a veil to hide her from eyes so familiar with her voice and her fea∣tures. She fainted in my arms.</P>
<P>The prisoners were too much involved in the sullen gloom of their own melancholy to regard the distress of another. The paper which I inclose, spotted as you see, with drops of blood from her own lovely arm, fell from her bosom. By the time she recovered, one of the officers who had guarded us approached.— She look∣ed at him a moment (it being the first time she had seen him since he came in) and then sunk without any appearance of life upon the floor. She lay as a corpse.</P>
<P>Oh merciful Heaven! — Oh God, great and gracious God! cried the officer, it is — it is — it must be Emma — it must be my SISTER.</P>
<P>Presently, Emma and Edward Corbett (for it was your son, my friend) were both embracing upon their knees.</P>
<P>It was no time to explain. She was moved out of the prison. I was permitted to attend. Edward Corbett in his own arms con∣veyed her to an apartment. He obtained leave of absence from the farther duties of the day. He was the nurse of your poor Emma. Oh, Mr. Corbett, I was not idle.</P>
<P>Washington happened to be quartered at the same town, prepar∣ing the manoeuvres of a new attack. He is easy of access; and be∣ing at liberty on a parole of honour, I gained an interview.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="017678_0112_0FA21E8FB4472208"/>Ah, can you not guess its motive? what <HI>could</HI> it be but the <HI>free∣dom</HI> of the captive Emma? The General heard the story of her love as I related it. I concealed no part from him but that which had reference to my own former folly. I brought the narrative down to the moment of reciting it. The soldier's cheek was not without the graceful dignity of a tear. He wept.</P>
<P>Sacred, said he, be the rights of hospitality: I am not at war with the <HI>affections.</HI> Ever privileged be <HI>their</HI> emotions. I feel them all. The beauteous prisoner is at liberty, Sir Robert, to go where she pleases. I shall appoint persons to attend her, who may pre∣vent all interruption and insult; but <HI>you,</HI> methinks, Sir Robert, should continue to follow her fortunes as a <HI>friend,</HI> — you are <HI>both</HI> free.</P>
<P>I flew to Edward Corbett with the tidings. Emma had by this time acquainted him with her situation.</P>
<P>At what a moment did I enter the room! Your son was pro∣nouncing, or rather <HI>attempting</HI> to pronounce, the names of wife and parent, of Louisa and his little Edward. And have I then these blessings, (cried he) and is my father <HI>yet</HI> in ignorance what claims, what doubly tender claims, Louisa Corbett hath upon him? He then pressed his sister in his arms, and they wept together.</P>
<P>Surprizes came too fast upon the hapless youth. He knew not that Henry was under arms. He did not know that he was an enemy. Yet he dropped for a while the fierceness of the soldier, and acted as a man — as the child of nature — as the husband of Louisa, and the brother of Emma. Then go, my sister, said he, your career is too glorious to be checked. In contemplating your conduct, I rise above all the prejudices of party. Alas, my sister, I know too well the sorrows of love and separation not to respect them. You find me here the foe of Henry, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it is not now the day of battle, and were he at this moment here, should I not expand these arms to receive the lover of Emma? Go then. But we are on the eve of a desperate undertaking. Our army moves to-mor∣row. I tremble for thee! Perhaps we m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y never meet more — perhaps — ah retire, retire, my best-loved sister, ere the idea of losing you for ever should tempt me to break my promise, and —</P>
<P>—This fraternal kiss, this affectionate embrace, and farewell. Give me not leisure to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct, let me not have opportunity to con∣sider the consequences of thus — Ah take her from me▪ Sir Robert, she is gaining on my affections, and I shall not be able —</P>
<P>Here he stopped, Mr. Corbett; Emma beheld the gathering storm of tenderness coming on, and exerting a resolution more than human, as fearing she should be prevented from pursuing the great object of her adventure, which was even dearer than a brother, she caught me by the arm, and shortened a scene too poignant to be continued.</P>
<P>No sooner were we alone — I am interrupted. Farewell.</P>

<P>No sooner had we got beyond the reach of those sighs which were breaking from the heart of Edward, than his lovely sister fell upon her knees, pressed my hand to her bosom, and spake thus. — On generous deliver, I devote to thee the first moment which the confusion of crouding incidents allow to pour forth the tribute of my gratitude. I ask not the means by which Heaven directed you to me, but I feel the motive of your voyage so pathetically, so per∣fectly, so — ah Sir Robert, wherefore do you heap on me this agonizing goodness? Wherefore did you pursue the footsteps of one whose pre-occupied heart and plighted hand make it impossible to reward your kindness or your generosity? Not even a beloved brother, whom I thought breathed no more, not even Edward, long lost and newly found▪ could prevail with me to forego the purpose of my pilgrimage. No, by this affecting effusion of tears which are now ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hing your hand▪ I swear — But it is un∣necessary. Behold a woman firmly resolved, Sir Robert; oh why are you then — Indeed it is vain, <HI>indeed</HI> it is. Go then I conjure you, return to my dear, my drooping father—assure him that his Emma is in no danger —tell him that his darling son is found: Alas! how I forget myself, of this you say he is already informed, but at all events return; it is to no end that you follow me: how can you expect—</P>
<P>I expect it <HI>not</HI> Miss Corbett, said I, attempting to raise her up.</P>
<P>Here will I remain, cried she, till you pledge to me your honour that you will here close the debts which it will never be in my power to discharge. It is no place or time for arg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ment, Sir Robert. You are even now preventing me from the great business of my life▪ I beseech you to leave me. I am not ignorant of your passion, but I thought your prudence in never revealing it to me by your own mouth — in short, sir, I must insist on —</P>

<P>Oh sacred force of sovereign tenderness! Emma has tidings of her Henry. Our enquiries have at length terminated in success. He is now with his regiment off John's Town. Thither we are bending our course with the utmost expedition. I send you not the minutiae of intervening adventures. They yield to enterpri∣zes of greater moment. We are within one day's journey of the place.</P>
<P>By Heavens, Corbett, the roses are suddenly thrown over the cheek of your child, and the pale of fatigue and sickness, and loss of blood, (which has not been inconsiderable) all give way to the joyful expectation of seeing her Henry.</P>
<P>Surely it requires only a generous effort to turn our disappoint∣ments to amiable account. To conquer affection is not, I feel, always possible; but to direct it from one worthy path into ano∣ther, when the former is unfit or unjust, is assuredly in our power. Henry himself cannot adore Emma more sincerely than myself. My whole heart is her's; oft it trembles, oft it bleeds, but the choice either to be the object of esteem or the object of aversion is before me. Oh! I would not forfeit the partial sentiment which my conduct has lodged in the breast of Emma, for any other earth∣ly enjoyment. She owns me for her friend, her <HI>first</HI> of friends She talks to me without reserve. She looks at me sometimes till the heart's soft tear is in her eye. Ah, that tear! it is more worth than the possession of all the reluctant beauty that ever gold, gran∣deur, or importunity, extorted into their arms. I feel it stream over my senses. Blessed sympathy! Pure effusion! Generous, glorious Emma!</P>
<P>I am penciling these informations of our route, sometimes in the vehicle and sometimes in a room.</P>
<P>Emma has this moment desired the driver to stop. The door of the chaise is open; she jumps out, saying to me in a whisper, that a lucky thought strikes her.</P>
<P>I will follow her.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="continuation">

<P>God of all goodness! didst thou ever create another Emma?</P>
<P>In passing along, she took note of some bushes which were cover∣ed thickly with a dun coloured berry that clustered in the h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dge-rows. I assisted her in gathering these without daring to ask for information as to causes. She hath an air of intreaty which cuts short all curiosity about motive, and leaves us no other solicitude than that of gratifying her by implicit obedience.</P>
<P>I knew not the design of Emma in picking the berries till the evening, and <HI>then</HI> she explained to me their use.</P>
<P>Now for an <HI>experiment,</HI> dear Sir Robert, said she, taking up the bundle, and going into her chamber at a publick-house where we baited at twilight.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="017678_0115_0FA21E924064CCB0"/>In about an hour she re-entered — she <HI>re-entered,</HI> Corbett; but oh, how different from that Emma who had so recen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly retired! You know the clear and lucid w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ite that mixes with the eloquent bloom in her countenance — you know that rich tint of tenderness and ardour, of pat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etic softness and graceful passion, which form her complexion. Imagine my astonishment at beholding these discoloured in the darkest shade of that peculiar disguise which the juice of the berries we had collected cast over the skin. The stain was deep, strong, and apparently fixed. It resembled almost ex∣actly the hue of some of the savages whom we had observed to be wounded in a town through which we passed.</P>
<P>It was certainly <HI>inspiration,</HI> (said Emma, rejoicing at the alter∣ation as she surveyed it in the glass.) Ah how preferable this pre∣cious dye, continued she, to the fairest complexion in the world.</P>
<P>I shall assist Henry, I shall touch his dear hand, and attend him in every danger, without distressing him by surprize, or disarming him by softness. Oh, my good Sir Robert, romantic as may s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em the steps I have taken, be assured that I proceed with the utmost cauti∣on. I do not even <HI>now</HI> design to interfere with the horrid virtues of Henry's profession. I will not dare to place myself betwixt him and his duty. I will share his dangers, but cannot consent any longer to bear about a wretched being without at least attempting to render it serviceable to my friend. Your generosity well fits you to receive these apologies, if indeed any apologies should be necessary for the conduct of Emma on this trying occasion.</P>
<P>I could not reply, Mr. Corbett. Even her avowals of the af∣fection that she bears to Henry become new sources of my tender∣ness and admiration. But we are setting off again.</P>

<P>Oh Corbett, Corbett, who shall anticipate a moment's joy, a moment's satisfaction! By what an accident was my last sentence interrupted! — Your son — your poor son — your Edward, your dear, your darling Edward, is now <HI>indeed</HI>—</P>
<P>Bear up, my hapless friend, against the storm. To learn to suffer is the science of humanity. Each has his throes of heart. War, which levels millions with the dust, has at length —</P>
<P>But oh the generous youth, in what a cause he fell! — Unable to support our departure, he obtained his furlow and followed us. The humane general permitted him to seek his sister, and either guide her to the arms of Henry, or persuade her to return. He promised <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o return in three days. Alas! he will return no more. A party of the English were burning a village after a sudden at∣tack. Edward drew his unavailing sword to defend himself and the inhabitants, who were flying different ways in terror and de∣spair. And there my friend it was your son received his wound —his wound of death!</P>
<P>The conquerers drove off the cattle, loaded themselves with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of conquest, then suffered the peasants to escape, and re∣turned to the troops from whence they had been detached.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="017678_0116_0FA21E94BB2F0FE0"/>Edward bled fast; but having traced our route, he gave direc∣tions to the two soldiers w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o accompanied him, and pressed on∣ward. He was resolved once more, he said, to behold his sister. The men, who were indeed of those under his command, obeyed his orders, supported him on each side as he sat in the chaise, till, poor young man!—</P>
<P>— You know the rest. He sunk upon one of their shoulders, and with his dying breath insisted on their taking his corpse to Emma, of whom he had received tidings by the guide who had last left us, and whom he met on his return.</P>
<P>The poor fellows came on disconsolate with their dead master. They reached the town where we stopped, and were passing the window of our inn, when we heard a cry of — "the armies are engaged, the armies are engaged!"</P>
<P>The postilion got from his horse; the two soldiers (who had ta∣ken the precaution to alter their dress as American.) scaped from the carriage, and joined the multitude that thronged the streets.</P>
<P>The body of Edward was deserted. Emma, (who had th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> just finished her remarks on her disguise) seeing a man lie motionless, approached the chaise door, and there she beheld —</P>
<P>Oh Mr. Corbett, what accumulated miseries is it fated for this virtuous woman to undergo!</P>
<P>'Tis I then that have <HI>caused</HI> thy death, thou beloved youth, said she! No language can describe her agonies, but they were at∣tended to by none but myself: for the whole town was in consterna∣tion at the news of the engagement, Every house was emp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d.

The alarm spread every moment more wide — horror exhibi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed itself in every possible form. To continue in such a si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion was madness: to leave the breathless remains of Edward — oh shocking thought!—Oh Mr. Corbett, the exigencies of wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and the terrors of a town under such a panic, are not to be described▪ Old men were moving their d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>crepid limb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from door to door in despair of escape, and mothers with their children went w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ling by us.</P>
<P>With pious haste, these hands, assisted by my heart, (which is devoted to every connexion of Emma) prepared an hasty grave for the reliques of your son, — Emma, touched at the ceremony▪ burst into a flood of tears, and exerting herself beyond what is reported of her sex, joined in the last sad offices of love.</P>

<P><PB N="21" REF="017678_0117_0FA21E94F2343FC8"/>It was in vain to expostulate. She saw the danger, but felt no emotions of dismay. All feminine and gentle as she is, she ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e above the spirit of humanity.</P>
<P>I insisted on the priviledge of attending. She pressed my hand within her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and we set out for the scene of action.</P>
<P>It was altogether an impulse of most solemn enthusiasm. Emma was resolved, — and I am the friend of Emma.</P>
<P>Yet the tearful looks which she cast towards Edward's grave pierc∣ed me to the heart. One hallowed kiss more imprinted upon that earth, Sir Robert, and I will delay no longer. Pity a sister.</P>
<P>I stood at some distance, and saw the lovely one depart. O what minutes were these!

<HEAD>LETTER CXXV. TO C. CORBETT, <HI>Esq.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From Henry Hammond.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>THAT paragon of her sex, your daughter! That man too, soaring above the flight of humanity, who attended her as the companion of all her perils, all her pangs! The writer of this letter (or more properly speaking, the person by whom this letter is dictated) is at a loss by what means, or in what language, to convey to you the wonders which yet he is most anxious to im∣part.</P>
<P>By gentle degrees — oh, Mr. Corbett, let me open upon you the blessings which▪ by the contrivance of Providence, have been brought about, Summon your heart to hear the best, the dearest news which is in the nature of human things for you to hear. O let the agony of <HI>that</HI> information, which Sir Robert Raymond's letter has doubtless produced, be, in great measure, done away, by the happier tidings that will salute you in this.</P>
<P>The <HI>hand writing</HI> of the pers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n now dictating would too much discompose you. He makes use, therefore, of an amanuensis to prepare the way to circumstances of uncommon joy; and to give them to you in the security of more progressive explanation.</P>
<P>The leading step to every other felicity you must hear <HI>first</HI> You, who have deeply drank of the bitter cup, must now try to support, without intoxication, the taste of sweeter ingredients.</P>
<P>From the point of death, your Emma has recovered. The in∣terposing hand of Heaven was <HI>suddenly</HI> extended.</P>
<P>Ten days after the departure of S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Robert's packet, she was in a situation to leave her bed. To what <HI>purpose</HI> did she leave it? Resolution, oh how sacred is thy force, when animated by the breath of love!</P>
<P>If Henry be dead, said she, it is still the duty of Emma to pay him the mournful offices which she has paid to Edward.</P>
<P>She insisted on searching for the corpse of the man who had caused all her misfortunes.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="017678_0120_0FA21E98297284F8"/>The generous Sir Robert Raymond was at that time himself con∣fined by sickness which threatened his life: — when he was out of danger, Emma gave him in tenderest charge, and sat out, alone, towards th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se woods where some late skirmishes had passed. On her way she had the precaution to use again those berries which tinge the skin: to these she added a certain ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k that had been mentioned to her in the course of her various enquiries.</P>
<P>Behold, oh Mr. Corbett, behold the dear and delicate Emma, wandering unprotected, in the woods of America. — Behold her bearing over her tender shoulder the mere necessaries of decent covering. — Behold the most gentle, and most female form exposed to all the dangers of a wild and unknown country — picking her food from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edges — straying she knew not whither — in dis∣guise — in disorder — in despair!</P>
<P>Incredible were the toils of her research — incredible her fatigue. The forests are here, you know, of great extent: the wilds immea∣sureable.</P>
<P>After several days travelling, during which time she had not en∣countered any passenger who could give her the least intelligence, she sat herself down as usual, about the noon, and wept over her misfortunes.</P>
<P>Scarce had she rested a moment, ere the clamour of human voices, shouting at a small distance, caught her attention. She pressed hastily forward through the foliage, and observed at a little aper∣ture in the forest, a par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of soldiers engaging with a tribe of In∣dians; but while she was eagerly examining the persons of the <HI>former,</HI> the <HI>latter</HI> were put to flight, and retreated with the utmost precipitation: the soldiers pursued, and both were out of sight er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Emma had time to approach nearer to them.</P>
<P>She saw enough, however, to convince her that the regimentals were British, and the uniform of the officers such as belonged to the regiment of Henry; you will guess her despair when she did not perceive Henry amongst them.</P>
<P>The bodies of several English soldiers were seen in different parts of the forest, but the corpse of Hammond could, by no diligence, be found.</P>
<P>Still indefatigable, she went on, though by this time reduced almost to the last exigencies of nature, and every thing subdued but tender resolution, and the love which inspired it.</P>
<P>At length, Providence relented to her wish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and directed her steps to a bread common path way, across which was ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d a human figure, lying as dead, with an arrow sticking in his bosom. You already perceive, that it was no other than <HI>Henry himself.</HI> This, you <HI>may</HI> perceive, but no tongue can give you the faintest idea of that unparalleled heroism and fidelity, which now inspired the soul of Emma! She found the body yet warm, the pulse slowly moving, and the heart languidly bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h life. She extracted, the arrow, and sucked the wound — she had heard of the Indians using shafts whose points were envenomed: and right∣ly concluding <HI>this</HI> to be one of them, applied to it her lovely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ips
<PB N="25" REF="017678_0121_0FA21E98C465E678"/>
without hesitation.—This additional danger was an additional mo∣tive to the deed. Oh Mr. Corbett, what an angel is Emma!</P>
<P>Signs of existence increased. With scarce a covering from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y, the affectionate Emma sheltered her unfortunate charge for many days. Ere his senses returned, she thickened her disguise by all the arts in her power. Oh can any thing less eloquent than the great Author of Nature describe to you the transport of this wondrous creature, when she first beheld the long closed eye of Henry open on the light — and open on herself?</P>
<P>Think, Mr. Corbett, how difficult <HI>concealment</HI> must have been at this extatic moment; then, consider what presence of mind was necessary to repress the dear and dangerous effusion. The silver tones of the softest voice in the world were so artfully changed, as to correspond with the rest of her appearance. She fed him with what the fortune of an hour's hunti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g amongst the fruits of the fo∣rest afforded. He could not move. No soldiers returned. Men drop in a skirmish, and are sought for no more! No house was near: no hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: and she dared not stray too far from the place where he lay, lest she should lose sight of the spot. But now Henry felt the puncture of a want which even Emma could not accommodate. Fruits and vegetables, collected by chance, as they grew obvious, and within the beat of Emma's journeyings, were too unsubstanti∣al. It seemed as if famine would compleat what poison had begun. For lack of proper nutriment, after fatigues so imminent, he was reduced to an extreme of languor even worse than that of Emma; whom tenderness seemed to have rendered superior to every thing that could befall herself.</P>
<P>In these moments it was that Henry yielded to despair — in these moments his heart melted with gratitude to his protector —</P>
<P>Oh, generous unknown, (said he feebly) whosoever thou art, receive the dying acknowledgments of the man whom thou hast endeavoured to rescue from an untimely death. Had those kind endeavours succeeded, what thanks shouldest thou receive from one of the <HI>best</HI> — the <HI>dearest</HI> — But it may not be — I am nearly exhausted —perhaps, ere yet another hour moves by—. Lest that <HI>should</HI> be the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se, let me, oh let me while yet I have the power to call down hea∣v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n's choicest blessings on that lovely mourner, whose tears are hap∣ly streaming at this moment for the expi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing Henry—Ah Sir, all worthy youth, couldst thou see her — couldst thou attest for me these dying sentiments — couldst thou assure her that with my la∣test dreath — But that is impossible; she is a thousand leagues from these fatal shores. No matter. Oh hear me GOD! do <HI>thou,</HI> this <HI>night,</HI> this <HI>instant,</HI> suggest to her what was my last employment — my last aspiration. Oh Emma! Emma! my life, my love! —</P>
<P>Here he fell on the bosom of Emma, and would <HI>indeed</HI> have di∣ed had he known it was Emma that supported him.</P>
<P>She pressed his hand. She could not speak. To the Omnipo∣tent Father of Mercy she cast the imploring eye!</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="017678_0122_0FA21E99B9325D50"/>Let not the human heart give up its confidence in Heaven. It is never too late to trust!</P>
<P>A team now passed within fight of this disconsolate pair. They were laden with provisions and apparel drawn in fledges, and small waggons, and were on their way to three detachments of soldiers, (who had applied to the General for these accomodations) that were stationed on the north side of the forest. Amongst this groupe were also some cattle, of which some were cows. It is un∣necessary to say what use the unwearied Emma made of these: her winning address, and the moving simplicity of her grief, joined to the wretched situation of an English officer who appeared to be al∣most at the point of death, gained so entirely upon the soldiers and people who attended the fledges and waggons, that they adminis∣tered whatever could promote the wish of Emma, and even fur∣nished her with a fledge, a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le, and a guide, to carry Captain Hammond to John's-Town.</P>
<P>Thus providentially saved from death a <HI>second</HI> time, I shall not trouble you with other difficulties in the passage, or in the progress of Henry's recovery, though the least of these were enough to im∣mortalize Emma Corbett; but I shall convey your imagination to John's-Town, where Henry and his protector at last arrived, and found Sir Robert Raymond recovered from his fever, and just a∣bout to set out again in pursuit of Emma.</P>
<P>To her assiduous cares were now superadded those of this excel∣lent man, and Henry became in a short time the nurseling of both▪ He could walk, converse, and his wound was healing. Emma's dear perilous experiment was guarded — the prospect clear on every side. One afternoon Sir Robert gradually prepared Henry for the softest surprize that could touch the heart of a lover; h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> discover∣ed himself to be the friend of Mr. Corbett — he assured Henry that he saw Emma <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n good health a little before he left England — he asserted, in the strongest terms, her constancy, her attachment, her love — and said that such was the force of her affection he should not wonder some day or other to hear that she was arrived in America.</P>
<P>—<HI>Yes,</HI> and in America she <HI>is</HI> arrived, cried she, (entering at this moment, agreeable to the plan concerted) She <HI>is</HI> arrived <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> she is <HI>here</HI> — she is now in the presence of her beloved Henry — she now offers him the hand of Emma for EVER!</P>
<P>Emma was yet in her boy's apparel, but had washed the stain from her lovely countenance, and discovered enough to throw Henry first upon his knee to the restoring God, and then into the arms of this tenderest of women.</P>
<P>You will not expect I should tell you what <HI>either</HI> felt at that mo∣ment! You will not expect I should describe the series of delicious. sorrow and gratulations which followed, while all the enterprizes of Emma were relating to Henry. He found himself the most blest, most honoured, and most beloved of men! He found Emma all that language <HI>cannot</HI> express. He found —</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="017678_0123_0FA21E9A480F2BE0"/>— In short, it was a false rumour you see that reached Emma at John's-Town, respecting the death of Henry. He was reserved for Emma to discover and to restore.</P>
<P>He is discovered, he is restored. — Emma is now before him — Emma the most generous, most —</P>
<P>— Oh, Mr. Corbett! Henry is the happiest of mankind. He now TELLS you that he is — <HI>he</HI> dictates these explanatory sheets — they flow from his grateful heart — the tenderest mercies of Providence have been upon him; they are to be seen — they may be felt: you will no longer refuse to give him the hand of Emma! ah that he were worthy of her. Disclose, he beseeches you, these tender circumstances to Louisa, his sister. Oh! he can hold no longer, he is too, too happy; he takes the pen from the amanuensis and — No! it is not necessary to sign the letter, The writer is now known.</P>

<P><HI>THE</HI> blessings of Providence are at length manifest; since the pacquet from Henry must, ere this, be come to band. It is not easy to tell you how totally I have in <HI>them</HI> annihilated <HI>myself,</HI> for many days past. Henry recovers apace. The attentions of Emma, indeed, so pointed and so pure, might almost raise him from the dead. Yet I almost envy her the share she has had in this discovery, and all its happy consequences. I can scarce forgive my illness for sei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g me at such a time. It is Emma alone who has been the saviour of Henry. It is Henry only who can merit such salvation. You can image to your∣self nothing so tender as his gratitude, so warm as his affections, or so perfect as his delicacy. From his somewhat military stile of address I expected not this, and am equally surprized and delighted. Yes, my dear old companion, you have yet a daughter, and will, in a few days, boast also —</P>
<P>Oh my friend, how infinitely I fall beneath the standard of my am∣bition! How incorrect is human virtue! How frail is human for∣titude! The prospect of Henry's becoming your <HI>SON</HI> does not charm this rebel heart half so sincerely as it ought to do; and yet, Heaven is witness, that I am doing every thing to advance his health and his happiness</P>
<P>Self interested, perhaps, still. I d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt on promoting the felicity of Emma by any means. I am proud to please her. I consider the youth of Henry, and wish it the joys it is formed to taste. I reflect on my own age, and think that I am too silly to be pardoned. I am entirely convinced of my folly, and yet hug it to my heart. Ah Mr. Corbett, what is there in that subtle and active principle which we thus feed in our bosoms, and which turns, serpent-like, against the nourisher? It stings, and we are not angry: it tortures, and we do not, <HI>cannot</HI> command it to depart from us. Something, like the healing balm, flows into the wound, and recompenses us for all we suffer The misery which is the consequence of a tenderness like mine, is compounded of such

sweet ingredients, that it is not in the nature of the tender heart to wish it were removed. And yet, my friend, it is most intense. I have found the vanity of attempting to argue myself into neutrality▪ It is virtue and beauty that have attracted — that have bound me! Ere a soul like mine can free itself from <HI>such</HI> captivity, the enchanting powers of its object must change; its beauty become deformity, and its virtue vice. 'Tis out of the question. The great point of moral pro∣priety is in every man's power, and consequently in mine.

<P>THE greatest trial of mine, and perhaps of human life, is past; for I have just heard that your daughter is the wife of Henry, and yet I am able to hold the pen. Is there not a certain decent pride that sustains us after the great and difficult duties are perform∣ed?

<P>I did not attend the ceremony, which was this morning per∣formed.</P>
<P>I do not propose returning to Philadelphia for some days.</P>
<P>'Tis a dreary uncomfortable night. I am here too in a large apartment alone. Sighs burst from my bosom, and tears fall from my eyes, without any apparent cause. The effect of a thick drifly atmosphere perhaps—</P>

I have now been six weeks in the possession of Emma Corbett. She is my wife! God of Heaven, how I thrill with gratitude!

<HEAD>LETTER CXXXVII TO C. CORBETT, <HI>Esq.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I HAVE brought my pulses to be almost as obedient as I wish them. Reason is not so weak a power as we make her appear. Her province is perhaps misunderstood, my friend It is not ty∣ranny, but a mild and <HI>genial</HI> authority, which she should exercise. The subjects of her sway are the passions; those of the <HI>tender</HI> kind are with the most difficulty governed.</P>
<P>I have applied to this our intellectual sovereign on a different principle. I implored her, not to inspire me with that <HI>indifference</HI> which is the usual prayer of the disappointed. The object of my love is married to the man of her heart. She obtained him at the price of almost unparalleled hazards. I saw every hope of possession cut off. It was an intolerable agony. I bore it till I became al∣most desperate. I indulged the passion even till the indissoluble bonds were tied against me. I saw the madness of my pursuit, and retired — retired, my dear Corbett, not to meditate revenge against a happy rival, but to manage my own wretchedness, and to <HI>think.</HI></P>
<P>A serious appeal from the passions to the judgment is seldom made in vain. We miscarry, chiefly because we are <HI>not</HI> serious, but only <HI>suppose</HI> ourselves so.</P>
<P>I selected a quiet hour, and laid the simple facts before me. They were not elaborate. The woman of my affection (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hus I argued) is now happily married. She is generous enough to pity and res∣pect me for misery that she hath very unwillingly occasioned. Ac∣cidents have confirmed what Corbett at first betrayed. I have too much contributed to her present happiness for her to treat me un∣tenderly: and yet my farther intimacy will increase her distress,
<PB N="34" REF="017678_0130_0FA21EA111216040"/>
even if it does not spread itself in time to her husband. How bit∣terly does she pay for my former services! What hinders her, now that she is in the arms of Henry, from looking upon my pas∣sion as insulting and impious? Those very services. Do I then presume, and persecute her upon these? Oh indelicacy! oh folly.</P>
<P>But can I conquer my affection? No. It is not possible; it is not necessary. To <HI>extinguish bad</HI> passions, and to <HI>regulate good</HI> ones, are the two great points within the compass of reason. To covet any longer the <HI>person</HI> of Emma would be infamous. It is interdicted by law, by religion, and by God. But, are the merely sensual passions then at my age so very gross, that by no exertion, no interest, I can subdue them? What will be the consequence of my persisting? The distress of Emma, who now should taste on∣ly of joy, the suspicion of Henry, whose heart melts in gratitude towards me, and my own conscious upbraiding. Can I <HI>sustain</HI> these, or is an obstinate attachment to the only point which reason refuses me, (and which, after all, is hopeless) strong enough to sup∣port me? But <HI>what</HI> then am I to do? Does reason bring with her no compensations — no equipoise of rewards for punishments so severe? She does, and MANY. Shall I not rank amongst those the delights of a friendship not less <HI>tender</HI> though less <HI>interested</HI>— the <HI>secret</HI>-breathed prayer for one human being whose happiness is dearer to <HI>me</HI> than that of any other upon the earth — the generous sigh — the softening tear — the social smile — the self gratulation — the flush of virtue, pleased with <HI>herself</HI> — the smile of Emma — the assent of HEAVEN?</P>
<P>Oh Mr. Corbett, we have glorious faculties, had we the resolu∣tion to exert them. We are afraid to <HI>begin.</HI> The heart trembles at a view of its labour. We venture to climb the steep, and are dismayed. But every difficulty of soul and body diminishes by earnest perseverance. However cragged the mountain, or slippery its path, every effort brings us nearer to the summit; the second step is easier than the first, the third is smoother than the second. It is the motive of climbing that gives us fortitude. When the mo∣tive it <HI>so great</HI> as to concern the happiness of others, and our own duty is included, surely we should struggle to ascend. I, Corbett, <HI>have</HI> struggled — I cannot say how much or how long, but I can and do tell you, in the sincerity of my soul, that though I am not, nor perhaps shall EVER be again a <HI>happy</HI> man, I do not wish either the death of Henry, or the alienation of his Emma's affection. I can support the presence of both, when softness and wedded love sits <HI>fairest</HI> upon their features. And, tho' many a rising tear warns me that it is time to retire, no sentiment of irregular desire invades my heart. Henry cultivates my friendship with kindest care; I do not impute to him, his <HI>happiness</HI> as his <HI>fault</HI> I recede not from his embrace, though I seldom make advances to conversation that relates to Emma, and yet Emma is his perpetual subject, and his darling theme. Her own conduct is such as corresponds with
<PB N="35" REF="017678_0131_0FA21EA1B5C169E0"/>
every part of her former life. Perhaps there never was a more affecting situation than she has to perform whenever I am present. It is indeed too much for a nature so gentle, and so ingenuous. But I will remove the effect, by removing the cause. Humanity should not <HI>presume</HI> to be perfect. I have carried a conquest as far, perhaps, as it can go. I have acquired strength by an examination of weakness. Let me not sink into captivity by fool-hardiness. I have done much. In attempting more, I may lose all the laurels I have won. Involuntary thoughts will trespass on the firmest mind. Emma is a tender wife, a tender friend. Heaven continue her so, while earth hath a feeling to make life desirable. But the familiar intercourse of a private family is somewhat too much for me at present. I constrain Emma, whenever I visit her, and nature impells my steps towards Philadelphia but too often — to appear restrained. I beg you will tell my steward to prepare Castleberry for my reception. I will return to England. There is no danger of a relapse; but I am obliged to repeat the rescuing arguments too often. A few months absence will compleat my work. Henry and his WIFE —I wish, Corbett, I could write that word with a steadier hand — are happy. I leave them in the arms of each other. I —</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CXLII. TO F. BERKLEY, <HI>Esq.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE inclosed rough draught of letters will enable you, oh my friend, to trace the vestiges of some unhappy human beings since their departure from London to their return.</P>
<P>At present, fortune seems to continue our wretchedness by means the most complicate and inventive.</P>
<P>Two hours ago we arrived at the house of the unfortunate Cor∣bett. It was with the utmost difficulty his daughter reached town.</P>
<P>The first object that struck her was a HEARSE standing close be∣side her father's door. In the passage she beheld the undertakers bearing a coffin down stairs, The woe-worn Corbett was support∣ed between two servants, to take his last mournful leave of the friend whose remains were about to be deposited. He could not move. He had not received my letter from Portsmouth dispatch∣ed three days before. It had been miss-sent. The le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er did not come to hand till two hours after our arrival. He was not PRE∣PARED to receive us.</P>
<P>Our chaife drew up still closer. Emma rushed out. — The poor old man — the daughter.—</P>
<P>— We are not provided with a language to express these hor∣rors.—</P>
<P>Almost an hour the child and parent remained speechless — it was surprise and agony, at once dumb and dreadful.</P>
<P>The hearse waited. The coffin was placed in it, and shu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> up.</P>
<P>The bell is at this instant telling for poor LOUISA: The s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is come to tell the attendants that the clerg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>man is waiting, Wretched widow of Edward! She died distracted. The hearte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> driving off.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="017678_0137_0FA21EA71F5992E0"/>What a house is here! Alas, it has long and truly been the house of mourning!</P>
<P>Corbett and Emma are still together in the next room to that in which I write. The servants look amazement and dismay.</P>
<P>I hear, methinks, the voice of my aged associate in friendship and in sorrow. I am called suddenly and hastily —</P>
<P>Oh friend, oh Berkley: to what am I reserved! A PREMA∣TURE LABOUR has been brought on by hurry, agitation, and fatigue. This morning's sun sees Emma the mother of a <HI>living</HI> child. — The poison seems not to have been in the least degree communicated to this precious pledge. It is a female.</P>
<P>Alas! Emma would leap for joy at this circumstance; she would forget awhile her woes in viewing the babe whom Henry had bequeathed. She would present it with some testimony of mater∣nal transport to her drooping father. But that — even Henry's offspring can no longer soothe — for EMMA CORBETT IS DEAD.</P>
<P>Her death instantly succeeded the pangs of the birth. It hap∣pened at midnight. Her frame must have dropped in consequence of the venom, which resisted the force and subtilty of all applica∣tion. Soon — too soon — would the fair victim of constancy have sunk to the tomb; but these precipitating agonies added to the rest — oh, they were too much. She fell before them.</P>
<P>In the expiring moment she called me to her — "'Tis Emma's infant: take it, said she: it is a parting gift — I <HI>can</HI> no more — my father — my poor father!" —</P>
<P>She dropped upon the pillow, from which she twice vainly en∣deavoured to raise her head, and lift her eye to the objects about her — THEN BREATHED HER LAST.</P>
<P>Thus lived, and thus died, the most faithful and beautiful of women.</P>
<P>Charles Corbett stands fixed over the corpse of his daughter.</P>
<P>The old man is now bereft of all! "I am childless, Sir Robert, (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> exclaim) — Behold what CIVIL WAR has done for me▪" —</P>
<P>Berkley, I have kissed the clay cold lips — I have pressed the clay cold hand. On that bed the — that very bed —</P>
<P>—But I dare not indulge reflection. <HI>Pierced</HI> as I am, I would fain preserve a decent sorrow Ah that I were in my grave! Im∣pious wish! Is there a single point of space in the petty allotment of man, in which something important is not to be done?</P>
<P>You aged forlo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n one, now weeping over his child, looks up to me alone for something which resembles comfort, during the wretched residue of life.</P>
<P>The funeral obsequies of Emma are yet to be performed—</P>
<P>The widow of Edward hath left a son —</P>
<P>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e widow of Henry a daughter —</P>

<HEAD>LETTER CXLIII. TO THE SAME.</HEAD>
<P>I AM just come from the most agonizing ceremony, oh Frederick, that can possibly pass under the eye of man! — May you never feel what otherwise you can never know! Easy in your fortunes, quiet in your situation, unconnected in your interests, you can, happily for you, have no conception — at least no perfect one — of that rend in the heart which is made by death, when youth, in∣nocence, and beauty, are committed to the dust—when the parent hangs his drooping head over the last sad mansion — when the or∣phans—</P>
<P>What have I said? Youth, innocence, and beauty! — and do <HI>all</HI> these then go down to the earth's cold bosom? Shall none of them ascend? The gloom of the soul carries sensation almost in∣to sin! They shall ALL ascend! The <HI>one</HI> shall ensure everlast∣ing existence to the <HI>others.</HI> Innocence shall immortalize beauty and youth.</P>
<P>I am reasoning with an almost breaking heart, Berkley: while poor old Corbett, the survivor of his family, in all the solemn pathos of grief, forgets every pain of body, nursing that which is seated within.</P>
<P>The romance of youth may teach you to expect that I should summon to my assistance every infernal power — that I should tax heaven itself with cruelty, and take refuge from altercating man, amidst the friendly concealment of impenetrable woods. This may, perhaps, answer the purpose of the novellist, but it corres∣ponds not with the nature of your friend. No, Berkley. It is not in a moment like this that the truly touched and truly tender in∣dulge themselves in outrage. The first burst is past: that which began with loudness, with vehemence, and with vociferation, settles into the still, the solemn, and the affecting. The temper, stormy and headstrong, of Corbett himself, terminates in the elo∣quence of dumb distress.</P>
<P>The tears fall fast from me as I write. More <HI>impetuous</HI> periods I have felt: so <HI>awful</HI> and so <HI>affecting</HI> a crisis, never. You, who knew not Emma, and have not a regular though you have a worthy heart, cannot know what I have lost. The manner of her death — the motive — and the whole tenour of circumstances connected with it, throw over every passage of the scene, a colour so moving∣ly sad, that I sit wonder-struck in the room, and seem almost in my grave, with the world about me.</P>
<P>I have exerted myself to say thus much at the winding up of this solemn catastrophe, lest you, my dear Berkley, or any other per∣son, into whose hands these incidents may fall, should presume to question the ways of ALMIGHTY GOD, which a re-justifiable in every part of this pathetic story. Erroneous notions of punishment and reward are perhaps the leading steps to irreligion and infidelity.</P>
<P>The vile herd of novellists have done an essential injury to the cause of virtue, by sacrificing to the pleasure of the reader beyond
<PB N="43" REF="017678_0139_0FA21EA874CCD498"/>
the simplicity of truth. Difficulty, in the beginning of a narrative; love, in the middle; and marriage, at the end, make up, almost invariably, the recipe of a modern romance. This is called re∣warding virtue; a bad character or two, perhaps, drops off, and that is called punishing vice. False, foolish, conclusion!</P>
<P>Look into life. Doth not heaven's blessed beam shine equally on the just and the unjust? Are all rewards so mechanically con∣trived? Hath virtue no joys of her <HI>own?</HI>— joys, which generous sorrow only can produce? Is the sacred struggle of a good man <HI>altogether afflictive?</HI> To pass through a road perplexed and thorny — to travel through an hard and difficult life, without tearing the finer principles from the heart, doth it require no better conduct than moves in the machinery of those contemptible pages where all is given up to lettered art, and distorted imagination? Are there no sweets in the pensive sigh — the pious tear? Break they from the mourner without offering him <HI>any</HI> balm? Hath heaven born constancy no comforts? Consider the life of Emma! Hath death, at once virtuous and christian, nothing to lift the survivor's spirit above every care of vulgar being?</P>
<P>Oh Frederick, I am touched by a very tender example. In la∣menting as I <HI>now</HI> lament, say, my friend, are there <HI>no</HI> dear and welcome mitigations? Yes, I feel—I <HI>feel</HI> that there are. Would I part with this generous grief? Ah no! What would I take in exchange?—The universe should not buy it from me. I even an∣ticipate the holy satisfaction, when I shall steal from the shout and strife of society to the tomb of a virtuous woman. Think you I love her less because I no more shall see her? Hath she suffered in my esteem <HI>by her ascension into heaven?</HI> Shall she lose as an angel, what she acquired as a mortal? I love her better. The Omnipotent placed her in the path of my life, to fix and concentrate the best of passions. I am not of disposition or age to change again.</P>
<P>Oh that the daughter of Emma may live! Shall I be content with a parent's <HI>common</HI> duty —to cloathe, to feed, to educate? Con∣sider, Berkley, <HI>whose</HI> babe it is!</P>
<P>I have hurried down stairs to examine my treasure▪</P>
<P>— it lives, it sleeps▪ I have felt its gentle breath on my cheek.</P>
<P>God will spare it. <HI>Louisa</HI>'s orphan too is mine. <HI>Corbett</HI> too shall live. I have moved towards his bed-side often since I began to write. His face is hid—he will not yet endure existence, but the hours of resignation are at hand.</P>
<P>I conjure you then Berkley, to <HI>settle</HI> your opinions about Pro∣vidence.—Bring your piety to a point. Cultivate your tenderness. Love, like Emma; and if you meet with <HI>such</HI> a disappointment, do not transfer your affection, but turn it to a generous account. The <HI>vulgar</HI> effect of tender distress is dissipation or despair. Had I yielded to these, a poor old man would have wanted a friend: two lovely infants, a parent; and I, the self approving <HI>bosom-ray,</HI> which chears my spirit in this vale of sorrow. <HI>Circumscribe</HI> not, therefore, the rewards of Heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="017678_0140_0FA21EA934749AA8"/>The writer of a romance would paint me as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wretch without hope, who calls down the stroke of fate in pity to his aid.

<HEAD><HI>A SPEECH</HI> on the probability of a <HI>HAPPY MARRIAGE</HI> addressed By a <HI>FATHER</HI> to his <HI>DAUGHTER.</HI> From the French of <HI>JOHN JAMES ROUSSEAU.</HI></HEAD>
<P>YOU are now, Sophy, grown up to woman's estate; and you are not to remain always single. Your mother and I would have you happy, because our happiness depends on yours. The happiness of a virtuous young woman, is to make an honest man happy: we must therefore think of marrying you. We must think of this betimes, for your fate through life depends on your mar∣riage; and we cannot think too much upon it.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="017678_0142_0FA21EAB40FFC878"/>Nothing perhaps is more difficult than the choice of a good husband, except perhaps the choosing of a good wife. You, Sophy, will be this rare woman; you will be the pride of our lives, and our happiness in old age. But however great merit you may have, there are men who have still more. There is no man who ought not to think it an honour to obtain you: there are many whom it would do you honour to obtain. Among this number the business is to find one suitable to you, to get acquainted with him, and to make him acquainted with you.</P>
<P>The greatest happiness of marriage, depends on so many points of agreement, that it would be a folly to think to find them all; the most important must be made sure of, preferably to the rest; if the others can be procured too, so much the better; if they cannot, they must be overlooked. Perfect happiness is not to be found in this world; but the greatest of misfortunes, and that which may always be avoided, is to be unhappy by one's own fault.</P>
<P>There is a suitableness which may be called natural; there is also a suitableness arising from the institutions of men, and a sui∣tableness that depends wholly on opinion; of the two last, parents are the proper judges; of the first, the children alone can judge. In marriages made by the authority of parents, those suitablenesses that arise from civil institutions and opinion are alone minded; the matches are not between the persons, but between their rank and fortunes; but both these are subject to change: the persons alone remain the same, in all places, and at all times; the happiness or unhappiness of the marriage state depends, in spite of fortune, on personal and mental suitableness.</P>
<P>Your mother was a woman of family, I had a large fortune; these were the sole considerations that influenced our parents to join us together. I have lost my fortune, she has lost her rank; for∣got by her family. what doth it signify to her that she was born a lady? In the midst of our distress, the union of our hearts made up for every thing▪ the conformity of our tastes made us choose this retirement. We live happy in our poverty; each is to the other in∣stead of all. Sophy is our common treasure; we thank the Almighty for giving her, and taking away every thing else. You see, child, whither Providence hath brought us. Those considerations which occasioned our marriage are vanished, and that which was accounted as nothing makes all our happiness.</P>
<P>It is for man and wife to suit themselves. Mutual inclination ought to be their first tie; their eyes, their hearts ought to be their first guides; for as their primary duty, after they are joined to∣gether, is to love one another, and as to love, or not to love, doth not depend on us, this duty necessarily implies another, namely, to begin with loving one another before marriage. This is a law of nature which cannot be abrogated; these w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o have restricted it, by many civil laws, have had more regard to the appearance of order than to the happiness or the morals of the people. You see my
<PB N="47" REF="017678_0143_0FA21EABA1DF3BF0"/>
dear that the morality we preach to you is not difficult; it tends only to make you your own mistress, and to make us refer our∣selves entirely to you for the choice of your husband.</P>
<P>After giving you our reasons for leaving you at full liberty to make your own choice, it is proper to mention those which ought induce you to use it with prudence. Sophy, you have got good nature, and good sense, much integrity and piety, and those qualifications which a woman ought to have; and you are not dis∣agreeable, but you have no fortune; you have the best riches in∣deed, but you want those which are most valued by the world. Do not aspire, therefore, to what you cannot attain to; and regu∣late your ambition not by your own judgment, or your mother<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and mine, but by the opinion of men. If nothing were to be considered but merit equal to your own, I know not where I should set limits to your hopes; but never raise them above your fortune, which you are to remember is very small. You never saw our prosperity; you were born after we failed in the world. You have made our poverty pleasing to us, and we have shared in it without pain. Never, child, seek for that wealth which we thank Heaven for taking from us; we never casted happiness until we lost our riches.</P>
<P>You are too agreeable, Sophy, not to please somebody; and you are not so poor as to render you a burthen to an honest man. You will be courted, and perhaps by persons who are not worthy of you. If they show themselves what they really are, you will form a just estimate of them, their outside will not impose upon you long; but, though you have good judgment, and can discern me∣rit, you want experience, and know not how far men can disem∣ble. An artful cheat may study your taste, in order to seduce you, and counterfeit before you the virtues to which he is an absolute stranger. Such a one, child, would ruin you before you perceived it; and you would not see your error, untill it was past recovery. The most dangerous of all snares, and the only one from which reason can restrain you, is that into which the passions hurry one▪ if ever you have the misfortune to fall into it, you will see no∣thing but illusions and chimeras, your eyes will be fascinated, your judgment will be confused, your will, will be corrupted, you will cherish your very error; and when you come to see it, you will have no desire to leave it. It is to Sophy's reason, not to the bias of her heart, that we commit her; while passion hath no ascendency over you, judge for yourself; but whenever you fall in love, commit the care of yourself to your mother.</P>
<P>This agreement which I propose to you, shews our esteem for you, and restores the natural order. It is usual for parents to choose a husband for their daughters, and to consult her only for form's sake: We shall do just the contrary; you shall choose, and we shall be consulted. Make use of this right, Sophy, freely and wisely; the husband that is suitable for you ought to be your own choice, and not our's; but it is who must judge whether you
<PB N="48" REF="017678_0144_0FA21EAE1ACE6188"/>
are not mistaken in his suitableness for you, and whether you are not doing, without knowing it, what you have no mind to. Birth, fortune rank, or the opinion of the world, will have no weight with us. Take an honest man, whose person you like, and whose temper is suitable to you; whatever he be in other respects, we shall recieve him for our son-in-law: his income will be always large enough, if he hath hands, and good morals, and loves his family. His rank will always be high, if be ennobles it by virtue▪ If every body should blame us, what doth it signify? We seek not the approbation of the public; your happiness suffices to us.</P>
