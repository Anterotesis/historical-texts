<BIBL>HAGGAI II. 9.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>The glory of this latter House shall be greater than of the former, saith the LORD of Hosts.</HI>—</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN the Jews returned from the Babylonish Captivity, they (according to the direction and commandment of Cyrus the King of Persia) laid the foun∣dation of the house of God at Jerusalem, when some greatly rejoiced and others wept, as you may see in <HI>Ezra 1st and 2d Chapters.</HI> But the Samaritans▪ who were mortal Enemies to the Jews, by hiring Coun∣sellors and bribing some principal Persons at the Persian Court, greatly retarded the work:
<PB N="2" REF="004621_0003_100DAD492AC7B0D0"/>
So that from laying the foundation, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> seems to have been but little done to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> finishing the house until the second <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Darius, which probably included the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> about seventeen Years. When being <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> up by the Prophets Haggai and Zechariah, and encouraged by the decree of Darius in their favour, the work went on again. In∣deed, it seems as if the obstruction and opposi∣tion they met with from their enemies was not the only Reason of the works ceasing so long as it did. Its probable they had the common Excuse for not ingaging in and neg∣lecting to prosecute Expensive Underta∣kings, <ABBR>viz</ABBR> <HI>The difficulty &amp; hardness of the times</HI> Chap. 1. ver. 2. <HI>This people say, The time is not. come that the Lord's house should be built.</HI> But says the Prophet, ver. 4. <HI>Is it time for you to dwell in your cieled houses, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> housely wast?</HI> As if he had said, <Q>You complain of the times, yet they have not been so difficult, but that you have found means and oppor∣tunity to build fine Houses for your selves, tho' ye are content to let the House of God<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly in Ruins.</Q></P>
<P>There are three things more especially which the Prophet sets before the Jews to excite them to this work. As,</P>
<P N="1">1. That their neglecting of it so long al∣ready was the reason that they prospered no
<PB N="3" REF="004621_0003_100DAD492AC7B0D0"/>
better. They were blasted and the work of their hands not blessed. <HI>Ye have sown much</HI> says the Prophet, <HI>and bring in little, ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye cloathe you, but there is n<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne warm; and he that earneth wages, earneth wages to put them into a bag with holes. Ye looked for much, and lo, it came to little; and when ye brought it home I did blow upon it; Why? saith the Lord of hosts, because of mine house that is waste, and ye run every man unto his own house, &amp;c.</HI> Chap. 1. ver. 6, 9, 10, 11.</P>
<P N="2">2. He promises them God's assistance and blessing, Chap. 1. ver. 13. <HI>I am with you, saith the Lord.</HI> And Chap. 2. ver. 19 <HI>From this day will I bless you.</HI> That is from the day they in∣gaged vigorously to carry on the work of God's house.</P>
<P N="3">3. He encourages them to this work, by assuring them that the glory of this House should be greater than that of the former. They might be under discouragement, when they considered how far this house which they were about to build, would fall short of the first Temple in beauty and glory. Ver. 3. of Context, <HI>Who is left among you that saw this house <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n her first glory? And how do you see it now? Is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing?</HI></P>
<P>It was this that made the ancient men weep then the foundation of this latter house was <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that it was like to be so much less glorious
<PB N="4" REF="004621_0004_100DAD4B37D83808"/>
than the first Temple. But to remove this difficulty and discouragement, he assures them that the glory of this latter house should be greater than of the former, <HI>in our Text.</HI> But how this could or should be is the Question For the former house certainly exceeded the latter in Riches, magnificence of Building and external Ornaments, as well as divers tokens of the divine Favour, which the latter house was destitute of▪ But the Question admits an easie Solution from our Text &amp; Context; and is ob∣viously this, <HI>That Christ the desire of all Nations▪ should during the standing of this second Temple or latter House, come and honour it with his Presence</HI> Ver. 6, 7, 8, 9. <HI>For thus saith the Lord of hosts, Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the hea∣vens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come, and I will fill this house with glory saith the Lord of hosts. The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the Lord of hosts. The <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this latter house shall be greater than of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> saith the Lord of hosts;</HI>—</P>
<P>Which is as if he had said, <Q>I will stir <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all Nations, by Signs, by Prophecies, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mighty Wonders, a general expectation the Messiah, and in the fulness of time <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> send him who can answer all their wants wishes; who will be a Prophet to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them, a Priest to make Atonement, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

Advocate to make Intercession for them, and may therefore deservedly be stiled the De∣sire of all Nations; and I will fill this House with glory▪ For tho' the former Temple was very famous for many extraordinary things, for the Ark of the Covenant, the U<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im and Thummim, a vast profusion of Silver and Gold, and the Angelical appearance on the Mercy-seat: Yet all these shall be nothing in comparison of that Glory which shall re∣dound on the present Temple, when this divine Person shall vouchsafe to grace it with his Presence, as he certainly shall do, during its standing. In other Ornaments, saith the Lord, I could make the splendour of this Temple as well as <HI>Solomon's,</HI> consist: For gold is mine and silver is mine; but in this particular will I have it distinguished, and in this shall the glory of the latter House be greater than that of the former, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the Presence of the Messiah in it.</Q></P>
<P>So that it was Christ's Presence in the second Temple, that rendred it more glorious than <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> first.

<P><HI>Solomon</HI>'s Temple had the advantage of the latter Temple in many respects, its external Ornaments were more; its Workmanship was exceeding Curious, its Overlayings vast and prodigious; and there were also some Extra∣ordinary marks of the divine Favour in it, which were not in the latter, as the Ark of the Covenant, in which were put the Tables of the Law and the Mercy-seat, which was upon the Ark: There was also tho symbol of the divine Presence in a visible Cloud that rested over the Mercy-seat: The Urim &amp; Thummim, by which the high-Priest consulted God in difficult and momentous Cases relating to the publick Interest of the Nation, and also the holy Fire which came down from heaven upon the Altar, at the consecrating of the first Temple. I say these were things that tended
<PB N="7" REF="004621_0005_100DAD4CC5377EB8"/>
to render the first Temple glorious: But yet CHRIST's Presence in the latter, rendred it <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore glorious than the former. The Presence of this glorious Person, rendred the latter House (which in the eyes of some of the Jews was as nothing) far more glorious than the former.</P>
<P>But in the prosecution of the Doctrine, I shall consider and endeavour to shew,</P>
<P>I. <HI>In what manner we may expect CHRIST's Presence in a House of publick Worship.</HI> And,</P>
<P>II. <HI>How his Presence renders it truly glorious.</HI></P>
<P>I. I shall consider and shew, <HI>In what manner we may expect the Presence of CHRIST in a house of publick Worship.</HI> As it was foretold of Christ, That he should come into the Second Tem∣ple, so we read that he actually did; He was personally and bodily Present there: When he was but Twelve years of age, we read of his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eing there, sitting in the<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Luk.</HI> 2▪ 46, 47.</NOTE> midst of the Doctors, both hearing them and asking them Questions; and all that heard him were asto∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ished at his understanding and Answers: <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Luk. 19. 47. &amp; 20. 1.</HI></NOTE> of his teaching daily in the Temple and reaching the Gospel. But in this manner we <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not to expect him now in places or houses

of publick Worship: His bodily Presenc<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are not now to expect.

He assured his Disciples that he would be with them always to the end of the world, <HI>Mat</HI> 28. 20. And in Mat 18. 20. He says, <HI>Where two or three are gathered together in my Name, there am I in the midst of them.</HI> Tho' we are not now to expect his bodily Presence in our wor∣shipping Assemblies, yet his spiritual Presence we may, in houses set apart to honour &amp; wor∣ship this our Redeemer in. His Spirit is the Comforter, which before he left the world he promised should abide with his Disciples for¦ever, <HI>Joh.</HI> 14 16, 17, 26. Thus has Christ by his Spirit been present in places and houses o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> publick Worship in ages past; and thus his Pre∣sence may be expected in them yet, by them that are there gather'd together in his Name.</P>
<P>But I proceed,</P>
<P>II. To shew, <HI>How CHRIST's Presence render<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a House or place of publick Worship truly glorious.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="004621_0006_100DAD4EDE7E7908"/>
Its curious Workmanship and external Or∣naments may give it a splendid &amp; magnificent appearance, and render it in some respects glorious: But the true and greatest glory of it is the Presence of CHRIST in it. The pre∣sence of a Person of such Dignity, Excellency &amp; Glory, graces and adorns it, vastly beyond what the Art of man in its greatest perfection can do.</P>
<P>But particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>CHRIST's Presence renders a House of pub∣lick Worship glorious, as it assists and enables the Worshippers there, to worship God in an Acceptable manner.</HI> Its the honour and glory of a house of publick Worship, when the End and design of its Erection is obtained; when God is wor∣shipped in it in such a manner as is acceptable to him; that is, <HI>in spirit and in truth;</HI> for such it is that the Father seeks to worship him. But such a Worship will not be performed without the presence and assistance of Christ: <HI>For without</HI> Him we <HI>can do nothing,</HI> Joh. 15. 5. Without him all our acts of Worship will be of no significancy: But thro' him we may find acceptance; our offerings come up as a sweet savour before the Lord. That worship that is insincere, hypocritical, or on any account un∣acceptable unto God, is very far from doing any honour to a house of publick Worship: But that worship which God accepts and ma∣nifests
<PB N="10" REF="004621_0007_100DAD50811E54C8"/>
his approbation of, does honour to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Place where it is performed. But its owing <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to Christ's Presence and Assistance when it <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thus. By his Spirit we are assisted in Praye<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which is no small part of publick Worship Hence the house of God was wont to be stiled <HI>the House of Prayer.</HI> The teaching &amp; assistance of Christ, helps to an acceptable performance of this part of publick Worship. Sensible of their need of this, the Disciples of our Lord were desirous that he would <HI>teach them to Pray.</HI> Its thro' his Mediation, Merits &amp; Intercession, that our Prayers, Praises, and all other parts of publick Worship are accepted with the Fa∣ther; and when they are so, its an honour and glory to the Place where they are offered.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>CHRIST's Presence renders a House of publick Worship glorious, as it is by that, that the preaching of the word there is made Effectual for the Conviction and Conversion of Sinners and the Edi∣fying of Saints.</HI> Its owing to the Presence of Christ, by his Spirit, when the word of God dispensed in his House becomes like a fire and a hammer, breaking the rocky hearts of sinners in pieces: Its owing to this when it is quick and powerful, sharper than a two edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul &amp; spirit, joints &amp; marrow: When its mighty to the pulling down of strong holds, casting
<PB N="11" REF="004621_0007_100DAD50811E54C8"/>
down imaginations, and every high thing that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>alts it self against the knowlege of God, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ringing into captivity every tho't to the obe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ience of Christ. It contributes much to the glory of an house of publick Worship, when multitudes are Converted there; when many are taught the good knowlege of the Lord, and are brought to a saving acquaintance with Jesus Christ: When converts as a Cloud and as Doves to their windows are hastning thi∣ther: When of this and that man it may be said, <HI>That he was born there.</HI> Such a house then becomes a Seminary for Heaven, a Nursery of Plants for the Celestial Regions, a Garden of the Lord. Here the sinner is Converted, the saint Edified; here he finds spiritual Consola∣tion and that Refreshment that makes him grow in grace; and all this because Christ is there. And those happy and glorious Effects of the word preached there, renders such an house glorious in the sight of Angels &amp; Men: Put a lustre and beauty upon it, so that such as pass by and observe it will be ready to say as Jacob in another case, <HI>Surely God is</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gen,</HI> 28. 16, 17.</NOTE> <HI>in this place; this is none other but the house of God, and the gate of Heaven.</HI> From serving and praising God in such an House, many are frequently passing into Heaven, there to serve, glorifie &amp;
<PB N="12" REF="004621_0008_100DAD52F531FB20"/>
praise the same Almighty Being, whom they have loved and honoured here below. It re∣flects honour &amp; glory on a house when it thus serves as a place to fit many for the Inheritance of the saints in light: When many can say, <HI>Here were we first Awakened from security in Sin, here were we convinced of the Evil of it, here were our hearts broken for it: Here was that divine Light let into our minds which brought us out of darkness into marvellous light: By the power of di∣vine grace here were we redeemed from the power and dominion of sin, and brought into and established in the liberty of the Children of God. Here divine Instructions have edifi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d us; and here have we been qualifying for heavenly glory.</HI> Such glorious effects of the Word proceeding from the Power, Pre∣sence and Spirit of Christ, will contribute more to the honour and true glory of an house of publick Worship, than the most shining Orna∣ments of Gold, yea than the presence of the greatest Potentates or most dignified Persona∣ges on Earth.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Presence of CHRIST in a House of pub∣lick Worship renders it glorious, as it renders the Sacraments there administred, pleasant, desirable and beneficial.</HI> The Sacraments of Christs In∣stitution, are Baptism and the Lord's Supper. These are usually to be administred in Publick, in places set apart for God's worship; but the
<PB N="13" REF="004621_0008_100DAD52F531FB20"/>
influence and the efficacy, the benefit and ad∣vantage of them, depends upon Christ's Spirit <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere. The Baptism of Water will not of it <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elf wash away Sin: That must be done by the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enewing of the Holy Ghost, or else the Or∣dinance will be ineffectual. So the spiritual benefit and advantage of the Lord's Supper, is owing to the Presence of the Lord there▪ His Blessing and gracious Presence there, ren∣ders the Ordinance effectual, for the com∣forting and edifying the body of Christ, till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowlege of the Son of God, unto a per∣fect man, to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ. This renders it pleasant &amp; desirable, as well as advantagious and benefi∣cial. To Sit at the Table of the Lord, this causes his People to sit under his shadow with great delight▪ and makes his fruit sweet to their taste. They are refreshed edified and com∣forted by it, and improved in their fitness for Heavenly Glory▪ Here they receive some foretasts of the inexpressible pleasure of Com∣munion with Christ. This strengthens their hands and encourages their hearts to be sled∣fast &amp; unmoveable, always to abound in the work of the Lord; and causes them to wax stronger and stronger in the Lord and in the power of his Might, and to grow brighter and brighter Ornaments of Christ's Church;
<PB N="14" REF="004621_0009_100DAD55E2BBF7C0"/>
like those the Psalmist speaks of, that are plan∣ted in the house of the Lord, <HI>They will flourish in the courts of our God, they'll bring forth fruit in old age,</HI> Psal. 92. 13, 14.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The Presence of CHRIST in an House of pub∣lick Worship, renders it glorious, as that tends <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> inspire the Worshippers there with such Reverence and Devotion, and to dispose them to behave with such Gravity and Solemnity, as will be an honour and glory to the house where they Worship</HI> Reverence and devotion of spirit, Gravity and solemnity of behaviour in the Worshippers▪ gives lustre and glory to a worshipping Assembly: They are then some saint resemblance of the wor∣shipping Assembly above. They then adorn the house of Worship. Its worshippers thus influenced by Christ's Spirit, and not its curi∣ous Carving<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Painting and Colourings, are its O<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nament and honour: For that it composes them to this Reverence and devotion, Gravity and solemnity.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>CHRIST's Presence renders a House of publick Worship glorious, as it influenceth those that worship there to Peaceableness, Unity and Love.</HI> Says the Prophet in our Context, <HI>The desire of all Nations shall come, and I will fill this house with glory.</HI> And in our Text, <HI>Yea, the glory of this latter house shall be greater than the former; and in this place will I give Peace;</HI> Or as some render</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="004621_0009_100DAD55E2BBF7C0"/>
<HI>For in this place will I give Peace:</HI> Implying that the Peace he would give, or cause in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat House, would not only contribute to the glory of it, but would be one happy Effect of Christ's Presence in it. Christ is the Prince of peace; and he is stiled, <HI>Our Peace:</HI> And his gracious Presence with those that meet together in his Name, is happily influential to excite them to Peace, Unity and Love. Me<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k and quiet spirits are Ornamental to them, and adorn the House where they meet to Worship. They then obey Christ's Commands, imitate his Example, and shew that they are influen∣ced by his Spirit.</P>
<P>Thus then the Effects and Influences of Christ's gracious Presence, renders a House of publick Worship truly glorious.</P>
<P>What farther remains, is to make some <HI>IMPROVEMENT</HI> of what has been said.</P>
<P>I▪ <HI>From what has been said we may learn some∣thing of the Glory and Excellency of CHRIST.</HI> It is His Presence that beautifies and adorns, that renders honourable and glorious a house of publick Worship: Its His Presence that makes it shine more than any costly Orna∣ments that man can put upon it. How Ex∣cellent a Person then must this be, and how Glorious? Thi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should serve to Recommend

<P>▪II <HI>From what has been said, People should learn not to pride themselves in the Beauty or Ornaments of a house set apart for publick Worship.</HI> Not but that Houses built for publick Worship, should be decent, beautiful and comely. Its meet that we serve God with the best we have. The Best of beings should be served with our best, to manifest our great Regard to and high Esteem of him. When David resolved upon building God an House, he determined that
<PB N="17" REF="004621_0010_100DAD5885CD36D8"/>
it must be <HI>Exceeding magnificent, of fame and of glory,</HI> 1 Chron. 22. 5. And Solomon in his Let∣ter to Huram, said <HI>The house which I build is great, for great is our God above all gods,</HI> 2 Chron 2. 5. But then our aim in building such an house, should not be to feed our Vanity &amp; gratify our Pride. For if Christ be not in it; if his graci∣ous Presence be not there, the House is no bet∣ter than the man without Charity, <HI>as sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal.</HI> Its no better than <HI>a whited sepulchre, which appears beautiful outward, but is within full of dead mens bones &amp; all unclean∣ness.</HI> But yet the external Beauty and Orna∣ments of an house, is what vain minds are most desirous of and gratified with; little concern∣ing themselves about what is its true glory, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the Presence of Christ in it.</P>
<P>III▪ <HI>What has been said should Excite us all, to endeavour by all means to Engage CHRIST's gracious Presence with us in this House.</HI> This is the First Day of our Meeting here for publick Worship. This House is beautiful and mag∣nificent; much Labour and Cost has been Ex∣pended upon it: But unless Christ's gracious Presence be with us here, its all lost and to no purpose. If Christ be not present here, this House will be destitute of any true glory: Without that we shall not Worship God here Acceptably, neither will the Word preached
<PB N="18" REF="004621_0011_100DAD5A2DF7AB70"/>
be savingly beneficial to us, and the Sacrament<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of little significancy. Therefore if we would beautify and adorn this House; if we would have it rendred truly glorious, we should by all means endeavour to Engage the Presence o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Christ with us here.</P>
<P>And for this purpose be directed,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Heartily to accept of and submit to Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> your Lord and Saviour.</HI> Let every one in order to engage Christ's Presence with us here, spee∣dily accept of &amp; submit to Christ as their Lord and Saviour. Its not enough to Assent to the truth of the Revelation that is made of him in the Gospel, as the Saviour of the world; but you must Consent to Accept of Him as your Saviour: Not only as a Prophet to teach you, as a Priest to make atonement and inter∣cession for your acceptance; but also as a King to rule &amp; govern you. Here the insincerity of many, in the acceptance of &amp; submission to Christ, appears; Tho' they are willing to be saved by him, yet they will never submit to be ruled and governed by him: His Discipline is too strict, the Obedience he requires is too exact for them. They strangely delude them∣selves with hopes of being saved by him, tho' they are never govern'd by him But if ever you would have his gracious Presence here, or his glorious Presence hereafter, now receive and submit to Christ. Open the door of your
<PB N="19" REF="004621_0011_100DAD5A2DF7AB70"/>
hearts, that the <HI>King of Glory may come in;</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he be admitted into our hearts, we shall <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen have his Presence with us in this House.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Let us endeavour to Engage Christ's Presence with us here, by Meeting here in his Name.</HI> We are assured, That <HI>where two or three are gathered together in Christ's Name, he will be in the midst of them,</HI> Mat 18 20 Let us therefore when we come here to Worship come in Obedience to Christ; Let us come with a view &amp; aim to glorify him; to do honour to this our Lord and Master, Then may we expect his gracious Presence. Its not meerly our coming here that does ho∣nour unto Christ. Such as come only out of a vain curiosity of hearing or seeing some new thing, consult not the honour of Christ, nor the good of their own Souls: and are not likely to contribute any-thing towards engaging the Presence of the blessed JESUS with us here.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>We should earnestly Pray for Christ's Presence with us here.</HI> Our hearts desire and prayer to God, should be for the gracious Presence of Christ with us in this place; That by his Spi∣rit we may be enabled to Worship in an accep∣table manner; and that by the Influences and Operations of it, his Word may be made Ef∣fectual for the Awakening the Secure, Con∣verting the Unconverted; that the Doubting may be Resolved, the Weak and heavy laden
<PB N="20" REF="004621_0012_100DAD5C352A9880"/>
Comforted &amp; Supported. We should Earnestly pray for his presence in his Ordinances that may be here administred: That in them we may have Communion with our blessed LORD, as well as with one another.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>That we may Engage Christ's Presence with us in this House, we should be diligent, constant and devout in our Attend not upon his Worship &amp; Ordi∣nances here.</HI> We should be diligent and con∣stant in our attending the publick Worship in God's House. If we are slack, negligent and inconstant in our Attendance on the publick Worship, it shews that we have bu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> little Re∣gard to it, and are little concerned whether we have Christ's Presence or no. We should like∣wise be devent in our approaches to God in his House. Reverence and Devotion are very becoming, and likely means to Engage the Pre∣sence of our glorious Redeemer here.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>That w<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may Engage Christ's Presence with us in this House, we should set that our behaviour in it be Decent, Peaceable and Humble.</HI> As Christ has set before us an Example of <HI>Peaceableness</HI> and <HI>Humility,</HI> so he expects that his Disciples imitate it. And its not only their indispensible duty, but a prudent &amp; likely method to engage the <HI>Presence of Christ with them.</HI> Its the quiet &amp; hum∣ble that God's Spirit dwells with. <HI>To this man will I look, even to him that is poor &amp; of a contrite spirit and trembleth at my word,</HI> Isa, 66. 2. A peaceable
<PB N="21" REF="004621_0012_100DAD5C352A9880"/>
and humble Behaviour will recommend us to the Esteem and entitle us to the kind Regards of the blessed JESUS, and invite his <HI>gracious Pre∣sence</HI> among us.</P>
<P>IV. <HI>Is it Christ's Presence in a House of publick Worship, that renders it truly glorious? We should <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> very careful then that we do nothing to prevent our being favoured with his gracious Presence in this House, or that may cause him to withdraw it from us.</HI> If the glory of this House consists in our having the gracious Presence of Christ in it, then let us do nothing that may tend to prevent or de∣prive us of this Favour. The things that tend to prevent or deprive us of it, and which we should therefore endeavour that they may not be found with us, are some such as these.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Unbelief &amp; hardness of Heart.</HI> When per∣sons repeatedly refuse an offer'd Saviour; when they will not believe in him; tho' they have greater Evidence of his being the Messiah and Saviour of the world, than they would have should one rise from the dead and tell them so. When they will not believe his Promises nor Threatnings, nor his power to Renew, Sanctify and Save them. This causes him to with-hold or withdraw the gracious &amp; powerful Influence and Efficacy of his Spirit from them. He does not think fit to continue it where its so slighted &amp; disregarded. Thus we find that it was be∣cause of their Unbelief, that Christ did not many
<PB N="22" REF="004621_0013_100D83C951954438"/>
mighty works in his own Country, <HI>Mat.</HI> 13. 58. He did not think it fi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting to bestow his pains upon such persons, or to continue his gracious Presence in such places where they were gene∣rally hardned in Unbelief.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another thing that tends to prevent or deprive us of Christ's gracious Presence, and which we should therefore be careful that it be not found with us, is, <HI>An Unpeaceable &amp; Contentious, spirit.</HI> Christ is a Prince of peace, and has taught his followers to be at peace amongst themselves, To study to be quiet, and to do their own busi∣ness. But yet if they are Unpeaceable, Wrath∣ful &amp; Contentious; live in Envy, Variance, Ma∣lice &amp; Hatred: And especially if they discover such a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emper &amp; behaviour in the publick Wor∣ship of God's House it will be highly displeasing to Christ, and may provoke him to withdraw his Presence from them.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another thing of the like unhappy ten∣dency, &amp; which we should be watchful against, is, <HI>A spirit of I difference about, Carelessness, Levity and Rudeness in God's House in times of publick Wor∣ship.</HI> When persons are indifferent &amp; careless about the publick Worship, are little concern'd whether they attend it or no, it discovers want of love to Christ and a low esteem of his graci∣ous Presence: And when in the House and at the times of publick Worship, their behaviour is irreverent &amp; rude; when they indulge them∣selves
<PB N="23" REF="004621_0013_100D83C951954438"/>
in sporting and play, they deserve to be treated in the manner that Christ treated them that bought and sold in the Temple, when making a scourge of small cords he drave them out of it. For by such behaviour they defile the House of publick Worship &amp; provoke Christ to withdraw his <HI>gracious Presence</HI> from it Let us then be very careful that we don't by any of these things prevent <HI>Christ's gracious Presence</HI> coming in∣to this House, nor provoke him to withdraw it if once he vouchsafes to favour us with it.</P>
<P>V. <HI>From what has been said, we may learn in what manner every one may be Instrumental in ren∣dring this House glorious; and that is by their sincere and constant Endeavours to engage the Presence of Christ in it.</HI> It's that (as we have heard) that will render it truly glorious. They at whose Expence it has been Set up and rendred so Con∣venient for the publick Worship to be perfor∣med in, have done well, and God will, no doubt, think upon them for good according to all they have done for him; He will remember them concerning this, and not wipe out their good deeds that they have done for the House of their God. But in this Expence every one has not been Equally interested: But in their En∣deavours to render this House truly glorious, the Poor may do as much as the Rich, the Low as much as the High, the Young as much as the Old; all Ages, Sexes and Ranks may here unite
<PB N="24" REF="004621_0014_100DAD6229CADE28"/>
in their sincere Endeavours to engage the Pre∣sence of the King of Glory here, whose Pre∣sence will be its greatest Ornament and Glory.</P>
<P>VI. <HI>From what has been said we learn, That al∣though this House in outward respects, be much more beautiful &amp; glorious than the former House, in which we and our Fathers before us, were wont to Worship God, Yet unless Christ's Presence be with us in this, it will be far less glorious than that.</HI> It doubtless affects us with some degree of pleasure &amp; satis∣faction, to see how much this latter House Ex∣ceeds the former in External beauty &amp; glory; and may serve to wipe off the Reproach which some have been ready to cast upon us, <HI>As Ho∣nouring the Law more than the Gospel;</HI> by reason of the decayed and ruinous state in which the House of God for a long time lay. But yet if Christ be not with us here, the glory of this House will be far less than the glory of the for∣mer: For we have heard with our Ears and our Fathers have told us, how Christ was gra∣ciously Present with them there. Tho' they built that House in troublous times, When labouring under the pressing difficulties that a howling Wilderness exposed them to▪ and when encompassed with numerous &amp; barbarous Enemies: Yet there they found Christ was with them in his House and Ordinances, and in those Eminent Lights that shone among them, whose Praise is yet in the Churches. It should there∣fore
<PB N="25" REF="004621_0014_100DAD6229CADE28"/>
be our ambition and care, above all things to Engage the Presence of Christ with us here, as it was with them; lest it be said, <HI>That the glory of the former House was greater than that of the latter.</HI></P>
<P>VII. <HI>Let us all be Exhorted to Bless and Praise <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> GOD, for that he has now favoured us with so convenient and decent a House to Worship in.</HI> It is now some Months more than<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Reverend Mr. <HI>Thomas Hooker,</HI> and the Reverend Mr. <HI>Samuel Stone,</HI> Arrived in <HI>New-England Sept. 3d. 1633,</HI> They with their Congregation continued at a place called <HI>Newtown▪</HI> now <HI>Cambridge,</HI> in the Province of the <HI>Massachusetts-Bay,</HI> about Three Years: In the Month of <HI>June,</HI> 1636, they, with a∣bout an Hundred Persons in their Company, Re∣moved from <HI>Cambridge</HI> to <HI>Connecticut</HI>-River, and Sat down at a place now called <HI>Hartford:</HI> They were near a Fortnight in their Journey thither.

Three Years since the publick Worship of God was first set up in this Town, by our <HI>Pious Progenitors,</HI> who left Father and Mother, Brethren &amp; Sisters, Houses and a pleasant Land, and some of them Circumstances of ease and plenty with respect to the things of this world, and followed the Lord in a Wilderness, a Land not sown; that there they might serve him in peace, in the manner, they apprehended most agreeable to his Will: They are dead and bu∣ried and their Graves are with us: And the House<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">The first Meeting House here was Built in the Year 16<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7. which stood 99 Years; then taken down.</NOTE> which they, in the Infant State of the Town prepared to Worship God in, is also gone: And although we have reason to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> under a sense of our many Declensions, since our Fathers fell asleep, Yet blessed be God that there yet remains so much care and concern about Religion, that by his Blessing on our En∣deavours, we are now provided with another House<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Foundation of this New one laid, <HI>Sept.</HI> 8, 173<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> for publick Worship, more beautiful, comely &amp; decent, than the former: Its thro' the good hand of our God upon us that it is thus.
