<P>A Man whose Name was JEREMIAH FENWICK, was upon a Fair Trial brought in GUILTY of having Murdered his Neighbour with an <HI>Axe,</HI> which he took up, and Employed a Repeted Blow thereof, at the Person at whom his Anger was Enraged.</P>
<P>After he received the Sentence of DEATH for the Fact, the Great pains taken by the Ministers of BOSTON for his Instruction and Conversion, were not without some good Effects, and Symtoms of <HI>Re∣pentance</HI> upon him; One of which might be his Desire to have a SER∣MON of such a Tendency Prea∣ched; as is here Published, that so such Ends as did appear to be de∣sired by the poor Man, may be yet more generally answered.</P>
<P>For which purpose, his <HI>Dying Speech,</HI> is also annexed.</P>

<HEAD>A View of an Unseen World. Just before the Execution of JE∣REMIAH FENWICK for a Murder. 13. d. IV. m. 1717.</HEAD>
<P>WE have before us a poor <HI>Son of Death</HI> within Three or Four Hours of an Awful Eter∣nity, whose <HI>Condition</HI> is a most af∣fecting SERMON unto us. But that it may be so, I am desired by <HI>him,</HI> to Entertain you with a SER∣MON on a Text by himself assign'd unto me, than which the whole Bible affords not a more tremendous one. Give now, <HI>O All ye People, every one of you,</HI> Give a most Lively At∣tention to the Words of a <HI>Dying Man;</HI> yea, Attend unto the Word of the <HI>Ever-living GOD,</HI> in,</P>
<Q><PB N="2" REF="001910_0004_0FB9D29D59CBF930"/>
<BIBL>Matth. X. 28.</BIBL>
<HI>Fear not them which kill the Body, but are not able to kill the Soul; But rather Fear Him who is able to destroy both Soul and Body in Hell.</HI></Q>
<P>AMong the Visions of GOD, granted unto a Favourite of Heaven, we find an <HI>Angel</HI> of the Lord <HI>flying thro' the midst of Heaven, and saying with a loud Voice, Fear GOD, and give Glory to Him.</HI> Yea, But here we have the LORD of that <HI>Angel</HI> Himself coming down unto the Earth, and <HI>saying with a loud Voice, O Fear the glorious GOD!</HI> It is our Great SAVIOUR, who Himself is very GOD, that now speaks unto us. You are sensible, That our SAVIOUR was now sending forth His <HI>Apostles</HI> and His <HI>Ministers;</HI> to <HI>Reveal</HI> those Truths of the Gospel, which had hitherto been <HI>Covered.</HI> The Faithful Discharge of their
<PB N="3" REF="001910_0005_0FB9D2A30C603A68"/>
Ministry, would be Dangerous unto them; would bring even the Dan∣gers of nothing less than <HI>Death</HI> it self upon them. To fortify them against the <HI>Fear of Death,</HI> Our SAVIOUR warns them of a <HI>de∣struction after Death,</HI> which is more to be <HI>fear'd</HI> than any <HI>Death.</HI> Un∣faithfulness unto GOD and a Neg∣lect of our Duty to Him, will Expose us to a <HI>Destruction</HI> of <HI>Soul</HI> as well as of <HI>Body,</HI> in a dreadful HELL, after <HI>Death;</HI> A <HI>Destruction</HI> more dreadful than any▪ <HI>Death.</HI> From the Apprehension of this <HI>De∣struction</HI> we are to be quickned unto the <HI>Fear of GOD. The Fear of GOD</HI> will Quicken us unto all possible Fidelity, Intergrity, Acti∣vity in the Discharge of our Duty to Him; will set us above the <HI>Fear</HI> of what any Man on Earth, or even all the Men in the World, can do unto us.</P>
<P>This is the sum of the matter. This, This the DOCTRINE of GOD our SAVIOUR; and the
<PB N="4" REF="001910_0006_0FB9D2A6B27FA0A8"/>
<HI>Roaring of the Lion,</HI> at which they are more stupid than the <HI>Beasts of the Forrest,</HI> who tremble not</P>
<P>The Destruction of the Soul as well as of the Body, in HELL, is a Thing so much more Formidable than any Death, as that it Infinitely Obliges us all unto the Fear of the Glorious GOD; who can inflict it on us, and will inflict it on them who do not Fear Him.</P>
<P>Syrs, You are to stand, before a DOCTRINE provided by a Dying Man for your Entertainment, as the People did of old before the flaming Mountain, upon which there were <HI>Thunders and Lightnings,</HI> and <HI>the Voice of a Trumpet, Exceeding Loud,</HI> So that <HI>all the People that were in the Camp, trembled at it.</HI></P>
<P>There are first of all some very awful Truths of the Gospel, which must be <HI>known,</HI> and be <HI>spoken in the Light,</HI> and set in a true Light be∣fore you.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="001910_0007_0FB9D2AD0CA6DC70"/>
I. It is most certain, That SIN must be <HI>Punished</HI> in <HI>Destructive Mi∣series</HI> upon the Sinner; a <HI>Destructi∣on</HI> proceeding from the Just Reven∣ges of GOD The Holy GOD has given us a <HI>Law,</HI> which requires our Homage unto Him, and our Kind∣ness unto our Neighbour. And a <HI>Just Law</HI> it is! While the great GOD is what He is, and His Crea∣ture Man, is what He is, there will be such Things <HI>due,</HI> as His <HI>Law</HI> has thus required. We must for ever own, Psal. CXIX. 142. <HI>Thy Righteousness is an everlasting Righte∣ousness, and thy Law is the Truth.</HI> 'Tis a <HI>Law</HI> Originally written on the Tables of our Hearts; and upon the Defacing of those Writings in our Fall from GOD, we have it more fully Explained in the <HI>Sacred Scrip∣tures</HI> which the <HI>Prophetick Spirit</HI> has provided for us. In this <HI>Law</HI> there is a <HI>Punishment</HI> assign'd for the <HI>Trans∣gression</HI> of it. Indeed, it were not a <HI>Law,</HI> if it were not arm'd with a <HI>Penalty.</HI> And still there is <HI>Justice</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="001910_0008_0FB9D2B038DD0990"/>
in all of this. It is <HI>Just,</HI> That the <HI>Displeasure</HI> of the Holy GOD a∣gainst the <HI>Transgression</HI> of His <HI>Law,</HI> should be declared in the <HI>Punish∣ment</HI> of the Transgressor. It is <HI>Just,</HI> That when the <HI>Law</HI> of the Holy GOD has been <HI>Transgress'd,</HI> the Crime should be punished in those <HI>Destructive Miseries,</HI> which accor∣ding to it belong unto the Sinner. The <HI>Destructive Miseries</HI> of the Sinner, are the <HI>Just Revenges</HI> of GOD upon him, demanding a <HI>Sa∣tisfaction,</HI> and a <HI>Reparation,</HI> for the Violations of His <HI>Law.</HI> The <HI>Justice</HI> of GOD herein <HI>Vindicates</HI> His Vi∣olated Law; <HI>Magnifies it and makes it Honourable.</HI> And herein He as∣serts and exerts those His Excel∣lencies, which have been <HI>Denied,</HI> been <HI>Defied,</HI> been <HI>Reproached</HI> in our <HI>Sin;</HI> For every <HI>Sin</HI> does <HI>deny the GOD that is Above.</HI> Wherefore, from the <HI>Justice</HI> of GOD it now comes to pass, That no <HI>Sin</HI> can be <HI>committed,</HI> but it must be <HI>Punished.</HI> Either the Sinner must himself be
<PB N="7" REF="001910_0009_0FB9D2B7500E1B80"/>
<HI>miserable;</HI> or else, One must be found, that may be a <HI>Surety</HI> for the Sinner, and shall <HI>Smart</HI> for it. That word, Rom. VI. 23. <HI>The Wages of Sin is Death:</HI> and that word, Prov. XIII. 21. <HI>Evil pursueth Sinners;</HI>—'Tis a word that must be Executed. The Truth of a GOD <HI>that cannot lye,</HI> stands engaged for the Execu∣tion of it. Upon a <HI>Sin,</HI> the <HI>Justice</HI> of GOD will demand a <HI>Sacrifice;</HI> The Object is <HI>Destroy'd,</HI> that is made a <HI>Sacrifice.</HI></P>
<P>First, This is what Men have Naturally some <HI>Apprehensions</HI> of: Men are <HI>Naturally Apprehensive</HI> of it, and bring into the World with them a Principle in their Souls, which when it is awakened, gives them an Assurance of it; That <HI>Sin</HI> must and will be <HI>Punished,</HI> by the <HI>Justice</HI> of GOD. It is truly affir∣med, Rom. I. 32. <HI>They know the Judgments of GOD, that they which commit such Things are worthy of Death.</HI> The GOD who <HI>forms the Spirit of Man within him,</HI> and left on it some
<PB N="8" REF="001910_0010_0FB9D2B8BB430158"/>
Tendencies for a Re-Union, to Himself; has made some Indelible Impressions of His <HI>Justice</HI> on the Spirit of Man; Impressions, Con∣victions, Perswasions, That <HI>GOD will punish</HI> Sin; and, That the <HI>wrath of GOD will come on the Children of Disobedience,</HI> for doing such Things as are found in their <HI>Evil doings. Governours</HI> themselves do <HI>Tremble,</HI> when they hear of a <HI>Judgment to come. Emperours</HI> them∣selves are uneasy amidst all the Pleasures and Grandeurs of their Palaces; 'Tis because they know, There is One <HI>Higher than they,</HI> who will <HI>Punish</HI> their Misdemeanours, with <HI>Destructive Miseries</HI> upon them. The rude Pagans have not been without their Notions of such a thing. The Barbarous <HI>Maltese</HI> themselves, had their Notions of a <HI>Vengeance</HI> that would pursue Wic∣ked Men; such as <HI>Murderers.</HI> The Ancient Law-givers, were wont in the close of their Laws, to men∣tion the <HI>Vindictive Justice</HI> of GOD:
<PB N="9" REF="001910_0011_0FB9D2BA8E8D6338"/>
The clause was, <HI>Qui secus faxit, Deus ipse Vindex erit.</HI> The Old Pagans had a sense of a <HI>Nemesis,</HI> or a <HI>Vindictive Justice</HI> which ter∣rified them. And it was the dread of this, which kept them so close to the Task of <HI>Sacrificing;</HI> yea, the Dread of it brought them even to <HI>Humane Oblations.</HI> Our common Ad∣versary took such advantage thereof, as to push them upon such <HI>Horrid Oblations;</HI> To make them do like the King of <HI>Moab</HI> in his Anguish; To make them offer up no less than, <HI>The Fruit of their Body for the Sin of their Soul.</HI> A Desire to pacify the <HI>Vindictive Justice</HI> of GOD; This is the Origin of all the <HI>Severe Penances</HI> wherewith so many Superstitious People in the World have mortified themselves. The Belief of this <HI>Vindictive Justice;</HI> Oh! It has a strange Force on the minds of Men! <HI>Sinner,</HI> Thou canst not shake it off: It will haunt thee, as long as thou art in the World; It will seize thee in all the dire
<PB N="10" REF="001910_0012_0FB9D2BFB65E8888"/>
Effects of it, when thou hast left the World. I requst every ungod∣ly Man to make the Reflection; <HI>Friend,</HI> when thou hast been doing an <HI>Ill Thing,</HI> has not something within thee, told thee, <HI>A Just GOD will one day punish thee for this!</HI> Oh! Do not slight such unfailing, such amazing praesages; <HI>Fools!</HI> Do not any more <HI>make a mock of Sin,</HI> as you use to do!</P>
<P>Secondly. The Thing is yet more clearly and fully discovered, in the <HI>Book</HI> that is <HI>given by Inspiration of GOD.</HI> Our BIBLE has the Incon∣testible marks of such a <HI>Book.</HI> Now that <HI>Sin</HI> will be <HI>punished</HI> by the <HI>Justice</HI> of GOD in <HI>Destructive Miseries</HI> upon the Sinner; This is that unto which our <HI>Bible</HI> does a∣bundantly Testify. Of our <HI>Bible</HI> we may say, Rom. I. 18. Here <HI>The wrath of GOD is Revealed from Heaven against all Ungodliness and Unrighteousness of Men.</HI> The <HI>Book</HI> of GOD is Expanded like the Firmament of Heaven over the
<PB N="11" REF="001910_0013_0FB9D2C27B06DAE8"/>
Church of GOD. In this Firma∣ment <HI>the GOD of Glory thunders;</HI> That <HI>Powerful Voice</HI> of GOD is ever now and then, heard Thundering there; <HI>The Justice of GOD will not let Sin go unpunished!</HI> That Thunder∣ing Voice of <HI>Justice</HI> is here uttered from the Mouth of GOD, <HI>Wo to the Wicked, it shall go ill with him, for the Reward of his hands shall be given him;</HI> That Thundering Voice▪ <HI>GOD will render Tribulation &amp; Wrath, Indignation and Anguish, upon every Soul of Man which doeth Evil.</HI> In this Book, how often do we find Things of such an Aspect as this! <HI>I will punish you according to the Fruit of your Doings, saith the Lord.</HI> How often is the <HI>Anger</HI> of a Glorious GOD against <HI>Sin</HI> here told unto us! Yea, with Terms that carry the highest Indignation in them! We must not imagine any <HI>Passion</HI> in the Infinite GOD, like what there is in <HI>Angry Men!</HI> But such Expres∣sions are used, as <HI>Philo</HI> says well, <HI>For the Instruction of the Multitude.</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="001910_0014_0FB9D2C3F2629EE0"/>
There is no <HI>Perturbation of Mind</HI> like that of our <HI>Anger,</HI> in the Glo∣rious God. But it means, <HI>A Justice Resolved that Sin shall be punished.</HI> Thus tis that <HI>GOD is Angry every Day!</HI> These, These must be our <HI>Doxologies</HI> unto Him; O Lord, <HI>Thou art not a GOD that has pleasure in Wickedness; neither shall evil dwell with thee; The foolish shall not stand in thy sight; Thou hatest all workers of Iniquity.</HI></P>
<P>II. You have been told, That <HI>Sin</HI> must be <HI>Punished.</HI> But, <HI>when,</HI> and <HI>where,</HI> shall the <HI>Punishment</HI> be dis∣pensed? The Proposition, which you were called but now to <HI>come and see,</HI> was like the <HI>Pale Horse</HI> whereof you read in the <HI>Apocalypse.</HI> You have seen <HI>Death</HI> mounted, and com∣ing towards the Sinner; and <HI>Swal∣lowing the Ground with fierce Rage</HI> in the swift Advances of it. But now, <HI>HELL follows.</HI> I am now to tell you, That the <HI>Destructive miseries</HI> brought in the <HI>Punishment</HI> of Sin up∣on the Sinner; are chiefly reserved
<PB N="13" REF="001910_0015_0FB9D2CCEF908768"/>
for an HELL in a FUTURE STATE; And there will be a <HI>De∣struction</HI> brought both on the <HI>Soul</HI> and on the <HI>Body,</HI> of the Sinner, in that astonishing <HI>Punishment.</HI></P>
<P>It is very plain, That the <HI>Punish∣ment</HI> which the GOD of Truth has Threatened for <HI>Sin,</HI> is not inflicted in the <HI>Present State.</HI> The <HI>Threa∣tenings</HI> of GOD which are all <HI>True and Faithfull,</HI> and shall <HI>surely come to pass,</HI> are not fulfilled in the <HI>Pre∣sent State.</HI> The <HI>Sentence against e∣vil Works</HI> is not so <HI>speedily Executed,</HI> but that the <HI>Ungodly</HI> often <HI>Prosper in the World,</HI> neither are <HI>they plagued like others,</HI> nor are there any <HI>Bonds in their Death:</HI> At the same time, The Children of GOD, may say, <HI>All the Day long have I been plagued.</HI> But, O you that have your <HI>Hearts fully set in you to do Evil,</HI> From this very Thing you may Conclude, That there is a FUTURE STATE, wherein the <HI>Punishment of Sin,</HI> will be such that it shall be according to that word; <HI>Mine Eye shall not spare,
<PB N="14" REF="001910_0016_0FB9D2CE0B239000"/>
neither will I have pitty; I will recom∣pence thee,</HI> O Sinner, <HI>according to thy ways, and ye shall know, that I am the Lord, who smites you!</HI> The Argu∣ment lies thus; If there be a <HI>Just GOD</HI> it must be so! If there be a∣ny <HI>Justice in Heaven,</HI> there must be an HELL wherein there will be found, <HI>A strange Punishment reserved for the workers of Iniquity.</HI> O Epi∣curean Atheists, If you try to weaken the Foundation of this astonishing Argument, GOD has placed an Of∣ficer within you, who will <HI>tear you in pieces, and there shall be none to deliver you.</HI></P>
<P>They are such <HI>Important,</HI> but so very <HI>Terrible,</HI> Things which are now to be published among you, That you may well demand some un∣questionable, some ungainsayable, <HI>Demonstrations</HI> of them. Now, I call to mind a saying, Luk. XVI. 31. <HI>If they hear not Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be perswaded, though one Rose from the Dead.</HI> We have had <HI>coming to us from the Dead,</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="001910_0017_0FB9D2D14C335E08"/>
such Things among our selves, that a Man must render himself unwor∣thy of a Conversation among <HI>Men,</HI> who shall deny the <HI>matters of Fact,</HI> and the plain Consequences of them, <HI>That there is a World of Evil Spirits;</HI> and, therefore also, <HI>a World of good Ones.</HI> But I wave these Proofs; Nor indeed will Wicked People <HI>hear them.</HI> I will carry you to one who is Greater than <HI>Moses and the Prophets;</HI> even Him, who was by <HI>Moses and the Prophets</HI> com∣mended unto us; One also who is <HI>Risen from the Dead.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Resurrection</HI> of our Blessed JESUS from the Dead, has had such <HI>Infallible Proofs,</HI> that nothing but some <HI>Satanick Energy</HI> can make any <HI>Man</HI> such a <HI>Bruit,</HI> as to admit a∣ny Doubt upon it. Now the <HI>Re∣surrection</HI> of our Blessed JESUS from the <HI>Dead,</HI> is a Victorious <HI>De∣monstration,</HI> That He is the SON of GOD, and the <HI>CHRIST, the Sa∣viour of the World,</HI> and that what∣ever He has Declared in His Gos∣pel,
<PB N="16" REF="001910_0018_0FB9D2D242B4A850"/>
is to be relied upon. Well▪ We will now hear what our Blessed JE∣SUS has declared unto us; and not be so Criminally <HI>unreasonable</HI> as to ask for any further <HI>Demonstration. Speak, O Glorious LORD, and O thou True Witness, who art the Deliverer of Souls; we will hear all that thou shalt speak unto us. Lord, We will Believe; Help thou our Unbelief!</HI></P>
<P>First. Our SAVIOUR has assured us of this; <HI>The SOUL of Man dies not, when his Body dies.</HI> There are many Considerations, which render it more than probable, <HI>That the Soul of Man is an Immortal Spirit.</HI> The <HI>Appetites</HI> for <HI>Immortality,</HI> the <HI>Praesages</HI> of <HI>Immortality,</HI> by GOD implanted in the <HI>Soul,</HI> cannot be <HI>made by Him in Vain.</HI> The <HI>Soul</HI> is not in its Constitution a <HI>perishable sub∣stance.</HI> 'Tis evidently an <HI>Intellectual Being,</HI> of such a Constitution as to have no <HI>Seeds of Corruption</HI> in it. The Soul so <HI>Differs</HI> from the <HI>Body,</HI> as to make us Think (and this very Thing, <HI>To Think,</HI> is more than
<PB N="17" REF="001910_0019_0FB9D2D3B8D01CF8"/>
<HI>Body</HI> can do!) that it <HI>Survives</HI> after the <HI>Death</HI> of the <HI>Body.</HI> Being <HI>Spi∣rit and not Flesh, therefore they shall not fail together.</HI> But above all, there is this to put the point beyond all <HI>Probability.</HI> The Glorious LORD, who is the Creator and Redeemer of our Soul, has positively told us, <HI>They which kill the Body are not able to kill the Soul.</HI> No profane shuf∣flings can Evade the force of this Proof! <HI>Man,</HI> Thy <HI>Soul,</HI> is a <HI>Candle of the Lord.</HI> Thy SAVIOUR who has placed this <HI>Lamp</HI> in the <HI>Earthen Vessel,</HI> has affirmed unto thee, that it is not Extinguished by the Break∣ing of the <HI>Earthen Vessel.</HI> No, He will keep it in its Existance to Eter∣nal Ages. The <HI>Spring</HI> in my Watch, will not be stript of its <HI>Elasticity,</HI> and cease to be a <HI>Spring,</HI> when it shall be taken out of the <HI>Machine</HI> whereof it now causes the various <HI>Motions.</HI> Nor the <HI>Soul</HI> when ta∣ken out of the <HI>Body.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. Our SAVIOUR has as∣sured us of this; <HI>That the Body which
<PB N="18" REF="001910_0020_0FB9D2D9E85DD4F0"/>
is by Death parted from the Soul, shall by a Resurrection from the Dead, be Restored unto it.</HI> It is not a <HI>Final</HI> and <HI>Endless</HI> parting of them, when the <HI>Dust returns to the Earth as it was,</HI> and the <HI>Spirit returns to GOD that gave it.</HI> No; The <HI>Body</HI> and <HI>Soul,</HI> may say to one another at parting; <HI>We shall come together again.</HI> The Glorious LORD, who <HI>Rais'd His own Body from the Dead,</HI> has left us no Room to doubt of His <HI>Raising Ours,</HI> when He has peremp∣torily told us; Joh. V. 28, 29. <HI>The Hour is Coming, in the which, all that are in the Graves shall hear His Voice; And they shall come forth; They that have done good unto the Resurrection of Life; and they that have done evil, unto the Resurrection of Damnation.</HI> It is most certainly so! GOD In∣carnate and Enthroned in our SA∣VIOUR will one Day Return from Heaven, and in that notable Day, <HI>according to the working of His Migh∣ty Power, whereby He is able to sub∣due all things unto Himself,</HI> He will
<PB N="19" REF="001910_0021_0FB9D2DD586EA768"/>
fetch the <HI>Seeds</HI> of our dissolved <HI>Bo∣dies</HI> from the Chambers of <HI>Death;</HI> He will <HI>Fill the Dead Bodies;</HI> He will return them to our <HI>Souls;</HI> to be Re-animated, with marvellous alterations upon them.</P>
<P>Thirdly. Our SAVIOUR hath assured us of this; <HI>That after a Re∣surrection from the Dead, the Wicked shall in Body as well as in Soul, be Punished with very Destructive Mise∣ries.</HI> Be sure, The <HI>Soul</HI> of a Wicked Man cannot but be very miserable, from the Time of its going from the <HI>Body.</HI> 'Tis a <HI>Soul</HI> stript of all the <HI>Enjoyments,</HI> which it chuses instead of the Glorious GOD, from whom it has wretchedly wandred; It is a <HI>Soul</HI> full of <HI>Remorse</HI> for its past Follies, and full of <HI>Horror</HI> in the prospect of a <HI>Wrath to come;</HI> It is a <HI>Soul,</HI> Abhorred by GOD, and Ba∣nished from GOD, and Associated with <HI>Devils,</HI> which are <HI>Tormentors</HI> unto it. And, Oh! the <HI>Torments</HI> of it! Now, it cannot be supposed, that the <HI>Soul</HI> of a Wicked
<PB N="20" REF="001910_0022_0FB9D2E3F74809E0"/>
Man, will have its Condition mend∣ed by a <HI>Return</HI> to the <HI>Body.</HI> No; The Resurrection of the <HI>D</HI>ead will be, upon that Intention; [For so it is to be read;] 2 Cor. V. 10 <HI>We must all appear before the Judg∣ment-Seat of CHRIST, that every one may receive in the Body, according to what he hath done, whether Good or Bad.</HI> But, Oh! what will the <HI>Soul</HI> suffer in the <HI>Body,</HI> and what will the Raised <HI>Body</HI> suffer with and from the <HI>Soul,</HI> when GOD shall again unite them, on purpose to lay upon them the <HI>Punishment</HI> which belongs unto them! Syrs, Will you hearken to the <HI>Faithful sayings of GOD!</HI> The <HI>Gospel</HI> of our SAVI∣OUR, has given us all possible Assurance, <HI>That GOD has appointed a Day wherein He will Judge the World by Him;</HI> and <HI>That we shall all stand before the Judgment-Seat of CHRIST;</HI> and, <HI>That every one of us shall give an Account of himself unto GOD.</HI> The <HI>Gospel</HI> of our SAVIOUR, has given us an undoubted Assurance, <HI>That
<PB N="21" REF="001910_0023_0FB9D2E50AD6B438"/>
He will come to render unto all Men according to their works;</HI> and, <HI>That then the Wicked shall go away into an Everlasting Punishment.</HI> The <HI>Gospel</HI> of our SAVIOUR has given us a Repeted Assurance, That <HI>the Wicked shall be Punished with an Everlasting Destruction from the Presence of the Lord, and from the Glory of His Power;</HI> and, <HI>That the Angels shall come forth and cast them into a Fur∣nace of Fire; where shall be wailing and gnashing of Teeth.</HI> After this <HI>Gospel,</HI> there is no room for any <HI>Disquisition.</HI> The <HI>Gospel</HI> speaks these things; There is no want of any further <HI>Demonstration.</HI></P>
<P>III. Twice has the <HI>Trumpet</HI> sound∣ed; The sound must wax <HI>Louder and Louder. Behold, the Third</HI> Pro∣clamation of <HI>Wo</HI> unto the Wicked, now <HI>cometh quickly!</HI> You are to be now informed, That no <HI>Death</HI> can be so <HI>Formidable</HI> as the <HI>Punishment</HI> of Sin in <HI>Destructive Miseries</HI> upon the <HI>Soul</HI> as well as the <HI>Body</HI> of the Sinner, in the HELL that is
<PB N="22" REF="001910_0024_0FB9D2E69E6DEEA8"/>
to come after <HI>Death.</HI> Unto this Amazing <HI>Punishment,</HI> the Denomi∣nation given is that, Rev. XX. 14. <HI>This is the Second Death.</HI> But veri∣ly, There is nothing in the <HI>First Death,</HI> which may be compared un∣to the <HI>Destructive Miseries</HI> in that <HI>Second Death.</HI> DEATH is the <HI>King of Terrors;</HI> But in comparison of the <HI>Second Death,</HI> it is but a <HI>Shadow of Death;</HI> It has no <HI>Terrors</HI> compa∣rable to those of the <HI>Second Death.</HI></P>
<P>Unto this tremendous Assertion, there has been a mighty <HI>Army of Martyrs</HI> who have born a <HI>Testimony,</HI> which ought to be far from Con∣temptible with us. Come with me, to <HI>Mahanaim,</HI> and see the <HI>Hosts of GOD,</HI> and hear their <HI>Testimony.</HI> There have been Thousands of good and wise Men, who rather than Sin against the Glorious GOD have <HI>not loved their Lives unto the Death;</HI> but been willing to Dye be∣fore the Term to which in the course of Nature they might have <HI>lived.</HI> When these Men were put
<PB N="23" REF="001910_0025_0FB9D2E8644D80B8"/>
in mind of this thing, <HI>Death is Bit∣ter;</HI> One of them spoke the mind of all the rest, when he said, <HI>But HELL is more Bitter than any Death! Death</HI> in all the most hideous and horrible <HI>Forms</HI> of it, and with all the most Insufferable <HI>Tortures,</HI> has been set before them. This <HI>Death</HI> have they chosen, and unto all the Torturous Cruelties which that Cursed Monster <HI>Persecution</HI> could afflict them withal, have they Courageously and Cheerfully Ex∣posed themselves. Why, They have all said, <HI>No Death of the Body from the Hand of Man can be so formidable, as the Destruction of Soul as well as Body from the Hand of GOD, after Death, unto which our Sin against GOD would render us obnoxious.</HI> The Servants of GOD, who have suffered <HI>Martyrdom</HI> have been the <HI>Excellent of the Earth;</HI> and such a <HI>Spirit of GOD has rested on them,</HI> in their sufferings, that we cannot reasonably imagine them left unto a <HI>Delusion,</HI> in the Grand Prin∣ciple
<PB N="24" REF="001910_0026_0FB9D2ECCFCE2480"/>
that acted them. These <HI>Wit∣nesses</HI> of GOD, <HI>ascending up into Heaven in a Cloud,</HI> call with a Loud Voice from thence unto us; <HI>It was well worth all our Sufferings, to escape the Destructive Miseries of the Hell, from which we are now delivered!</HI></P>
<P>What will be the more <HI>special kinds</HI> of the <HI>Destructive miseries</HI> in the <HI>Punishment</HI> of the Damned in HELL; This is a Thing very much con∣cealed from us, as well as the more particular place of Torment. Our <HI>Saxon</HI> Word, HELL, signifies, <HI>a Pit,</HI> and one that is <HI>covered over.</HI> Doubt∣less, our Language wants Words to express the <HI>Destructive Miseries</HI> in that <HI>Pit of Destruction,</HI> and so it can be no other than very much <HI>covered over.</HI> And yet the <HI>Mouth</HI> of the <HI>Pit</HI> has been so much <HI>Dis∣covered</HI> unto us that we shall not fall into it, except with <HI>madness in our Heart while we live,</HI> we will <HI>go unto the Dead.</HI> You shall presently see the <HI>Mouth</HI> of the <HI>Pit</HI> opened, and the <HI>Smoak of the Torment</HI> come
<PB N="25" REF="001910_0027_0FB9D2EFDB8B8F38"/>
up, which is to <HI>ascend for ever and ever.</HI></P>
<P>The Name which our SAVI∣OUR uses for the HELL wherein <HI>GOD will destroy both Soul and Body</HI> of the Wicked, even, GEHENNA; This carries in it, what is very <HI>For∣midable.</HI> 'Tis as much as to say, <HI>The Valley of Hinnom.</HI> Tragical Things were done in <HI>the Valley of Hinnom,</HI> when the Diabolical Idola∣ters offered up their Children to <HI>Molock</HI> there; and employed the Noise of Drums to drown the dole∣ful Cry of the Infants while they were <HI>Burning Alive</HI> unto the Devil. It seems, the Ejulations of wret∣ches <HI>Burning Alive,</HI> [But, <HI>O Lord, How Long! How Long!</HI>] These, it seems, will give some <HI>Idea</HI> of the <HI>Punishment</HI> inflicted on the <HI>multitudes,</HI> alas, the <HI>multitudes!</HI>—in the Dis∣mal <HI>Valley of Destruction.</HI></P>
<P>But, you look for <HI>Demonstrations.</HI> I affirm to you, No <HI>Death</HI> so For∣midable, as the <HI>Destructive Miseries</HI> of that HELL, wherein the <HI>wicked</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="001910_0028_0FB9D2F1AFEAC8E0"/>
shall be <HI>punished.</HI> Now, Listen to the <HI>Demonstrations;</HI> yea, Tremble at them.</P>
<P>First. Let <HI>Righteousness, Cry,</HI> and <HI>Equity put forth her Voice.</HI> 'Tis thus that she <HI>cries at the Gates</HI> of Death. Such Things as <HI>Wicked Men</HI> have most <HI>Unrighteously</HI> done unto <HI>Godly Men,</HI> have they not been very <HI>For∣midable?</HI> Those Abominable Men, who have been, <HI>The Haters of GOD;</HI> What have they done to the <HI>Peo∣ple of GOD?</HI> The <HI>Best People</HI> in the World, falling into the Hands of the <HI>Worst,</HI> how barbarously have they been Tortured and Butchered? They have with <HI>Boots</HI> had the ve∣ry marrow forced out of their <HI>Bones.</HI> They have been stretch'd upon <HI>Racks</HI> till they have been left in a swoon with their <HI>Bones</HI> all out of Joint. They have been broken on <HI>Wheels,</HI> and many Hours have passed, before the <HI>Coup de Grace</HI> has been given them. Slow <HI>Fires</HI> have roasted them to Death. Authors who have written, <HI>De Crucia<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>
<PB N="27" REF="001910_0029_0FB9D2F4188E06A8"/>
Martyrum,</HI> have not a Page, but what is <HI>Formidable.</HI> What <HI>Formida∣ble</HI> Things have been done upon the <HI>Best of Men,</HI> by that First-born of Tyrants, the <HI>Vile Person</HI> lately at <HI>Versailles,</HI> and the rest of his Bre∣thren? What <HI>Formidable</HI> Things, in the Popish Inquisition? But now, We are taught of GOD; Cor. III. 25. <HI>He who doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done.</HI> The Question is, <HI>Whether there be a Righteous GOD?</HI> But GOD forbid, That ever this should be a <HI>Question!</HI> There were an Infandous Blasphe∣ming in the <HI>Question.</HI> Well; since there is a <HI>Righteous GOD,</HI> and, <HI>Verily, There is a GOD who Judges in the Earth,</HI> it necessarily follows, There must be an HELL in which there must be a <HI>Punishment</HI> for the <HI>Wicked,</HI> at least as <HI>Formidable</HI> as the worst Things which the <HI>Godly</HI> have suffered from them; at least <HI>Propor∣tion'd</HI> unto the <HI>Wrongs</HI> which the <HI>Wicked</HI> have done unto the <HI>Godly.</HI> But this will soon infer something
<PB N="28" REF="001910_0030_0FB9D2F7DB0D8980"/>
that shall be vet more <HI>Formidable!</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. We have seen HELL begun upon <HI>Earth;</HI> And from thence we may gather, how <HI>Formidable,</HI> and much more painful than any <HI>Death,</HI> will be the <HI>Punishment</HI> of the Wicked, in that HELL to which they are going down. If the <HI>Raised Bodies</HI> of the Wicked, must feel <HI>Pains</HI> at least <HI>Equal</HI> to what they gave unto the <HI>Bodies</HI> of others here, and be used no better than some <HI>In∣humane Caribbaeans</HI> do their <HI>Slaves,</HI> they will now be worse of it, be∣cause their <HI>Souls</HI> will feel, what the <HI>sufferers</HI> from them here, did not undergo. The Horrors raised in a <HI>Guilty Conscience,</HI> what are they but some sparkles of HELL shot into the Souls of Men? But these Hor∣rors, How Intolerable! How Into∣lerable! It was long since observed; Prov. XVIII. 14. <HI>A wounded Spirit, who can bear?</HI> Persons under the Horrors of a <HI>Guilty Conscience,</HI> how <HI>Formidably</HI> are they Cruciated? They <HI>Roar by Reason of the Disquiet∣ness
<PB N="29" REF="001910_0031_0FB9D2FA12ED98A8"/>
of their Heart.</HI> Yea, They <HI>chuse Strangling rather than Life.</HI> One a∣mong us, kept fearfully crying out, <HI>I am all on Fire under the Wrath of GOD!</HI> and went, and hanged him∣self. Some that have wounded their <HI>Conscience</HI> by sinful Compliances and Apostasies, have been so unable to bear the <HI>Wounds,</HI> that they have Retracted what they have done, and have gone and have told, the <HI>Tor∣mentors, No Death you can inflict, is a thousandth part so bad, as the wounds which we feel in our Souls!</HI> Yea, How often have People under the Hor∣rors of a <HI>Guilty Conscience,</HI> grown lean, and pale, and ghastly; and been meer <HI>Magor-Missabib's,</HI> a <HI>Terror</HI> to <HI>themselves, and all about them!</HI> How often, have they pro∣fess'd, That <HI>Burning in the Fire</HI> on the <HI>Hearth,</HI> would be a <HI>Mitigation of their Miseries!</HI> One of them over hearing People speak, about <HI>Burn∣ing in the Fire,</HI> cried out, <HI>Oh! That is but a meer Metaphor for what my <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Endures!</HI> Now, In HELL, the
<PB N="30" REF="001910_0032_0FB9D2FEEAE4F8E8"/>
Horrors of a <HI>Guilty Conscience</HI> do seize upon the <HI>Souls</HI> of the wicked, in the fullest Efficacy, and with a vast Enlargement of their <HI>Faculties,</HI> to receive the lashes of the <HI>Furies.</HI> GOD has an <HI>Instrument of His Ven∣geance</HI> in the <HI>Conscience</HI> of a Wick∣ed Man. And Oh! the Scourges, Oh! the Scorches, which it will give unto him, when the <HI>Vengeance of Eternal Fire</HI> falls upon him! Can any <HI>Death</HI> be so <HI>Formidable,</HI> as what is felt from a <HI>Conscience</HI> arm'd with <HI>Guilt,</HI> and in the Name of the Holy GOD upbraiding a Sinner with a <HI>Fiery Indignation?</HI></P>
<P>As an Appendix unto this Arti∣cle, I will offer to your View, the astonishing Distress into which our Blessed JESUS Himself was thrown, when <HI>GOD laid upon him the Iniqui∣ties of us all,</HI> and He underwent the <HI>Punishment,</HI> which was due for the Sins of His Elect. Syrs, Go to <HI>Gethsemane,</HI> and see the Blessed JE∣SUS prostrate in the Dust, and <HI>Blood</HI> mingled with the <HI>Sweat</HI> which
<PB N="31" REF="001910_0033_0FB9D300039FEEC8"/>
dropped from Him; See Him very Heavy, very Sorrowful, sore Ama∣zed, in most inexpressible perplexi∣ties crying out▪ <HI>Oh! My Father, let this Cup pass from me!</HI> Go to <HI>Golgo∣tha,</HI> and see the Blessed JESUS hanging on the Tree, with His Bones out of Joint; See Him with His <HI>Heart melted like wax in the midst of His Bowels,</HI> and crying out, <HI>My God, my God, Why hast thou for∣saken me?</HI> All this done, to the JE∣SUS, who was <HI>Holy, Harmless, Un∣defiled, and Separate from Sinners,</HI> when He was a sufferer for Sinners! And now, O Sinful ones, How will you bear the <HI>Punishment</HI> of your own Sin? Ye sorry <HI>Briars and Thorns,</HI> How will you stand before that <HI>Con∣suming Fire?</HI> The Cup which made that <HI>mighty One,</HI> our <HI>Immanuel,</HI> to stagger, will certainly be too strong for the miserable Sinner.</P>
<P>Thirdly. The <HI>Punishment</HI> of the Wicked in the <HI>HELL ordained of old by the King</HI> of Heaven for them; From whence will come the <HI>Princi∣pal
<PB N="32" REF="001910_0034_0FB9D302423F7C38"/>
Infliction</HI> of it? O Hearken to me! The <HI>Principal Infliction</HI> of the <HI>Punishment</HI> on the Damned, will be with an <HI>Immediate Impression</HI> from the wrath of an Infinite GOD upon the <HI>Soul</HI> that is fixed in an Aver∣sion for Him. O most <HI>Formidable Punishment!</HI> At the mention of it, will not our <HI>Souls</HI> Tremble, and our <HI>Hearts be removed out of their place?</HI> The <HI>Punishment</HI> of <HI>Sin</HI> in <HI>HELL,</HI> will be nothing less than the <HI>Wrath</HI> of an Almighty GOD, making a direful Impression on the <HI>Soul</HI> of the Sinner. The Sinner shall not be de∣livered over into the Hands of only <HI>Finite Executioners:</HI> But the Almigh∣ty GOD Himself, will take him into His own Hands, and make him feel such scalding strokes of His <HI>Wrath,</HI> as will be more torturous than flaming Sulphur, or than run∣ning Bell-Metal. What will be the <HI>Fire</HI> of the Damned? There is an awful Intimation; Heb. XII. 29. <HI>Our God is a consuming Fire.</HI> Oh! 'Tis GOD approaching to them, as
<PB N="33" REF="001910_0035_0FB9D305B8D679E0"/>
a <HI>Revenger,</HI> that will <HI>make their plagues wonderful.</HI> There will be wonder∣ful Dolours in the <HI>Punishment</HI> of Sin, which will not be inflicted by the Administration of Creatures; But they shall be <HI>Immediate Ema∣nations</HI> from a Provoked, Omnipo∣tent, Omniscient GOD, Penetrating like Hot Lightning into the Dam∣ned Soul; <HI>Immediate Coruscations</HI> from GOD, acting as a <HI>Consuming Fire.</HI> O Wicked Ones, <HI>I my self▪ will fight against you, with a strong Arm, even in great Wrath,</HI> saith the Lord. The great GOD Himself will shoot the Thunder of His <HI>Wrath</HI> into the Desolate Soul of the Sinner; GOD with His burning Wrath shall draw near to the Desolate Soul, and fill it with a Confusion that no words can describe unto them who are yet in the Flesh. <HI>Lord, Thou wilt make them as a Fiery Oven in the Time of thine Anger!</HI> The <HI>Lord will swallow them up with His wrath;</HI> so the <HI>Fire shall devour them. Arrows</HI> from the <HI>Wrath</HI> of GOD shall enter into
<PB N="34" REF="001910_0036_0FB9D3072BDD5EC0"/>
the <HI>Soul</HI> of the Sinner; the <HI>Poison</HI> thereof, Oh! how it shall Enflame and Enrage the <HI>Spirit!</HI> Oh! The Groans of the Malefactor, when the <HI>Wrath</HI> of GOD shall be breaking of him; <HI>O GOD, Thy-Wrath lies hard upon me; Thy Fierce Wrath, O GOD, is going over me!</HI> Can any <HI>Death</HI> be so <HI>Formidable? Can thy Heart En∣dure, or thy Hands be strong, when I shall deal with thee? saith the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Finally. There is this to render the <HI>Punishment</HI> of the Wicked in HELL beyond all Imagination <HI>For∣midable.</HI> Do you know of any <HI>Period</HI> for the <HI>Punishment?</HI> Only an <HI>Aking Tooth,</HI> holding One for a <HI>Month</HI> together, how grievous! But the Exquisite <HI>Miseries</HI> of the Dam∣ned, will they hold no more than a year? or will they come to a <HI>Pe∣riod</HI> in a <HI>Thousand years?</HI> or after as many Millions of years, as there are <HI>Leaves</HI> upon the Trees, or <HI>Drops</HI> in the Sea, or <HI>Sands</HI> on the Shore; will they then come to a <HI>Period?</HI> or, could a Scroul as wide as the
<PB N="35" REF="001910_0037_0FB9D30A86DF1FF0"/>
System of Our World, fill'd with Figures, contain the Number of years, which the Wicked are to see <HI>passing away in the Wrath of GOD!</HI> We know nothing of any <HI>Period.</HI> This we know, That our SAVI∣OUR has called it, Mat. XXV. 4<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>An Everlasting Punishment.</HI> And there is a consideration, which the mind of a <HI>Christian</HI> cannot hear proposed, but he must like <HI>Moses</HI> before the Burning Mountain of old, cry out, <HI>I exceedingly fear and quake, at the mention of it!</HI> It is this; 'Tis plain, That our <HI>Mediator</HI> unto whom <HI>GOD has committed the Judg∣ment,</HI> will adjudge the Wicked un∣to a <HI>Punishment</HI> which will be <HI>For∣midable.</HI> 'Tis plain, That our <HI>Me∣diator</HI> at the <HI>Time of the End,</HI> when <HI>He delivers up his Kingdom to His Father,</HI> Leaves the Wicked still under their <HI>Punishment.</HI> If ever the Wick∣ed be Released from their <HI>Punish∣ment,</HI> it must be after the <HI>Son of GOD,</HI> shall cease to act as a <HI>Mediator.</HI> Now, when the <HI>Mediator</HI> has left
<PB N="36" REF="001910_0038_0FB9D30CC46D7FC8"/>
them, in the <HI>Devouring Fire, and in the Everlasting Burnings,</HI> Who, who will there be to bring them out? Or, Is there any likelihood, that Souls, which have outstood their <HI>Time for Probation,</HI> and are fixed in all <HI>Malignity,</HI> should ever be chan∣ged, and brought back unto an un∣changeable GOD, who has finally Rejected them? O <HI>Punishment</HI> hope∣less of a <HI>Period?</HI> Certainly, No <HI>Death</HI> can be so <HI>Formidable?</HI></P>
<P>IV. But <HI>All have Sinned!</HI> And What? Is there <HI>no Remedy nor Es∣caping?</HI> Yes, my Friends; <HI>I bring you good Tidings of great Joy!</HI> An Improvement is now to be made of these <HI>Faithful sayings:</HI> Which are also how <HI>Fearful</HI> ones! The FEAR of GOD, is now to be praescribed unto you, as the only Method of your <HI>Deliverance</HI> from the <HI>Destruc∣tive Miseries</HI> which the <HI>Punishment</HI> Of <HI>Sin</HI> is big withal. Every One will take it for granted, That the GOD who is <HI>Able to Destroy both Soul and Body in Hell,</HI> is a GOD for¦ever
<PB N="37" REF="001910_0039_0FB9D30F140D8798"/>
to be <HI>Feared. Who shall not Fear thee, O Lord, and Glorify thy Name?</HI> Certainly, A sorry <HI>Worm</HI> crawling upon the Earth, urging us to Sin against Him, cannot be so worthy to be <HI>Feared,</HI> as He. Think of this, O all you, whom the <HI>Fear of Man,</HI> may be likely to draw in∣to any <HI>Snare of Sin.</HI> But I am now to advise you, That if you would be delivered from the <HI>Destruction of both Soul and Body in Hell,</HI> it must be by the <HI>Fear of GOD.</HI> So we are instructed, Prov. XIV. 27. <HI>The Fear of the Lord is a Fountain of Life, to depart from the Snares of Death.</HI> O our <HI>Gospellized People;</HI> You must come into the <HI>Fear of GOD</HI> Immediately, if you would not be <HI>destroy'd both Soul and Body in Hell,</HI> and if you would not <HI>perish wonder∣fully!</HI> We may justly make that Exclamation once made by the Man of GOD; Lord, <HI>Who so considers as to know what Power thy Anger has! Yea, ev'n according to thy Fear so is thy flaming Wrath.</HI> Souls, <HI>According</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="001910_0040_0FB9D3125ED4D280"/>
as the <HI>Fear of GOD</HI> is in you or not, so shall the <HI>Wrath of GOD</HI> be dispensed unto you. You are on every side surrounded with <HI>perswa∣sives</HI> to the <HI>Fear of GOD, perswa∣sives</HI> Enough to render your <HI>De∣struction</HI> as Demerited as Unavoida∣ble, if you continue the <HI>Children of Unperswadableness.</HI> But what is now insisted on is this; Oh! may you now be <HI>perswaded</HI> unto it, <HI>Knowing the Terror of the Lord.</HI> Come into the <HI>Fear</HI> of GOD, moved by this, <HI>De∣struction from GOD, is a Terror to me!</HI></P>
<P>There are Three Things to be more particularly in the <HI>Fear of GOD,</HI> now press'd upon you.</P>
<P>First. In the <HI>Fear of GOD,</HI> make your <HI>Flight</HI> unto your only SAVI∣OUR, that you may be delivered from the <HI>Wrath of GOD</HI> and from the <HI>Destructive Miseries</HI> in that HELL which your <HI>Sin,</HI> has deserved for you. This, This is the <HI>Fear of GOD,</HI> in the Evangelical Notion of it; Such a <HI>Dread</HI> of the Divine Displeasure whereto our Sin Exposes us, as to Compel our <HI>Flight</HI> unto the only
<PB N="39" REF="001910_0041_0FB9D31493470348"/>
SAVIOUR from <HI>Sin,</HI> that by Him we may be <HI>Saved</HI> from it, Thus we read, Psal. CXLVII. 11. <HI>The Lord takes pleasure in them that Fear Him, in them that hope in His Mer∣cies.</HI> Our <HI>Hope</HI> in a Glorious CHRIST, is our <HI>Hope</HI> in the <HI>Mercy</HI> of GOD. Without this <HI>Hope,</HI> there is no Genuine <HI>Fear of GOD.</HI> O People in Danger of a <HI>Damnation that slumbers not;</HI> You are to Re∣member, That there is a <HI>JESUS who delivers from the Wrath to come.</HI> You are to Remember, That we have a Great SAVIOUR who has willingly undergone the <HI>Essentials</HI> of that <HI>Punishment</HI> which was due to His chosen for their <HI>Sin.</HI> You are to Remember, That when the Blood of our Great SAVIOUR is applied unto his chosen, to rescue them from their <HI>Punishment,</HI> He always inclines and strengthens them, to <HI>Confess</HI> and <HI>Forsake</HI> their Sin, and Return unto GOD. Now, you must in the <HI>Fear of GOD,</HI> fall down before your Great SAVIOUR,
<PB N="40" REF="001910_0042_0FB9D315C4050D80"/>
and with a wondrous Importunity beg it of Him; <HI>O my SAVIOUR, Do thou Reconcile me, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> GOD, and Lead me in the Paths of Righteous∣ness.</HI> My Friend, Except thou dost <HI>Wrestle</HI> hard for this, and as it be∣comes an <HI>Israelite indeed, Weep and make Supplication</HI> to GOD for it, thou never shalt be <HI>Justified.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. The <HI>Fear of GOD,</HI> when 'tis wrought in a Soul, there is the <HI>Life of GOD</HI> begun in that Soul. O make out for, O make sure of, such a <HI>Vital Touch</HI> from GOD upon your minds, as will <HI>Quicken</HI> you to <HI>live</HI> unto Him. These always go together; Eccl. XII. 13 <HI>Fear GOD and keep His Commandments.</HI> The <HI>Fear of GOD</HI> infused into the <HI>Heart,</HI> will make a <HI>New Heart</HI> of it, and a clean One. Oh! Let that cry ascend from you with a matchless Agony, <HI>Create in me a Clean Heart, O GOD! The Fear of GOD,</HI> will dispose you to be afraid of every Thing which the <HI>Light of GOD</HI> within you, shall
<PB N="41" REF="001910_0043_0FB9D317312BCC90"/>
pronounce a sinful Thing. It will dispose you, to fill your Lives with continual <HI>Acknowledgments</HI> of GOD, and make it your main Design, to <HI>please</HI> Him, your main Business to <HI>Serve</HI> Him, and <HI>Acknowledge Him in all your ways.</HI> It will dispose you, to acquiesce in the <HI>Will</HI> of GOD, and behave your selves as under the <HI>Eye</HI> of God, and as those who must give unto Him an <HI>Account</HI> of your Behaviour. It will dispose you to follow the pattern of your SA∣VIOUR, and rejoyce in an <HI>Imita∣tion</HI> of Him, a <HI>Conformity</HI> to Him. It will dispose you to <HI>Love</HI> your <HI>Neighbour▪</HI> and still <HI>do to him,</HI> as you would own it Right for him to <HI>do unto you.</HI> Without these <HI>Dis∣positions,</HI> you cannot look for Ad∣mission into those <HI>Gates,</HI> which are set open for none but the <HI>Righteous Nation.</HI> If you cannot shew such <HI>Tokens of Salvation,</HI> you shall never be received unto the <HI>Feast</HI> in the mount of GOD. Should a Soul without these <HI>Dispositions</HI> be taken
<PB N="42" REF="001910_0044_0FB9D31E575E0E40"/>
into Heaven, that <HI>Holy Place</HI> would soon purge it out, clear it self of so disagreeable a Nusance. Wretched Soul, <HI>Heaven</HI> is a Soyl, that cannot bear such a venemous <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> in it. A Soul that has these <HI>Dispositions</HI> wro't in it, has <HI>Heaven</HI> it self in∣wrought into the very Temper of it; and if it were possible for such a <HI>Sanctified Soul</HI> to be thrown down into HELL, it would carry <HI>Heaven</HI> thither with it. Now, <HI>If any of you lack this wisdom let him ask it of GOD!</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE Dying Speech OF Jeremiah Fenwick, Who, after he had at the place of Execution, less audibly spoken the substance of these Things, then gave the ensuing Instrument <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a more full Declaration of his Dying Sentiments.</HEAD>
<P>I Consider my self as a dying Man, and I desire to dye giving Glory to God, before whom I am now to make my Appearance. I offer up my Praises unto God who has granted me such a space of Repentance, and so many helps and means to bring me to it.</P>
<P>I hope, the Faithful Servants of God, will with some comfort see
<PB N="2" REF="001910_0053_0FB9D33830FAAA70"/>
some Harvest of the great pains they have taken for my Good.</P>
<P>To all the other Sins of a Wicked Life, I have added this; That I have too much delayed my Repentance, even since my Imprisonment, while the Sentence against my evil work, was not yet certain to be Executed. Though I have hereby so affronted and provoked the good Spirit of Grace, that He might justly with∣draw for ever from me, yet such has been his Free and Rich Grace, as to continue still to visit me with his In∣fluences; and bring on a work of Repentance in my Soul.</P>
<P>I heartily mourn for all the Sins of my Life; and above all for the Fountain of all Sins, which I have in an Heart that is desperately wick∣ed. I most particularly confess and bewail my Blood-Guiltiness. I owe my Life to Justice, for having wrong∣fully taken away the Life of my Bro∣ther, whom I ought to have loved as my self. I own the Justice of the Government in their Proceeding a∣gainst me. <HI>But, Lord, there is For∣giveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="001910_0054_0FB9D339B19D6A80"/>
I behold the Infinite Mercy of a God ready to Pardon; and my Soul is amazed at it: I behold a great Saviour, shedding his Blood, which cleanses from all Sin. And I hear him saying to the chief of Sinners, <HI>Him that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out.</HI> With a distressed Soul I fly to him, to be reconciled unto God, and to be led into Paths of Righte∣ousness. I am not without Hope. And one fruit of my Hope, is, that it causes me to look on my Sins with more Sorrow for them, and Hatred of them; which till I had this Hope, I did not care or dare to think upon. Another fruit of it, is, that my Heart is melted, and filled with Desires to Glorify God:</P>
<P>And I know not how to glorify God more, than by solemn warnings unto all People to take heed of such Sins, as have brought me to such a Ruin as is now come upon me.</P>
<P>The first thing that lies heavy on my Heart is, My Prophanation of the Lords Day, and my frequently &amp; needlesly neglecting the Publick Wor∣ship of God. A Sin, which let all that love their Souls be afraid of▪
<PB N="4" REF="001910_0055_0FB9D341B2715480"/>
I have wounded my Soul sometimes by excessive Drinking. A Sin that leads to many others. I have been very vile in Swearing and Cursing. <HI>Lord, send me not among those whose Language I have been used unto!</HI> Un∣governed Anger has brought my Death. Beware, my Friends, of this deadly Evil. But I would especially bewail my Prayerless Life. I had no Prayers with my Family, nor in my Retirement, in the Morning of the Day, when I was left unto the Mur∣ther of my Neighbour. O my Friends, In the Day, which you don't begin with Prayers unto God, little do you know what God may leave you to.</P>
<P>Thus, I would as in the Presence of God, and as I am now in a short Time to appear before my great Judge, there to give up an Account of my Actions done in the Flesh, solemnly exhort and warn all that shall see or hear of my Tragical and Untimely End; But more particular∣ly Masters of Families, that they do not neglect Prayers in their Families, and a due Attendance on the Publick Worship of God, on his Holy Day,
<PB N="5" REF="001910_0056_0FB9D3432C6514F0"/>
and all other, Duties required in Gods Holy Word, as I to my great Grief have done. I desire all, that they look back on their past life, and seek to God, thorough Jesus Christ for Repentance, while there is a space given to them, least they mourn at last, and say, <HI>how have I hated In∣struction?</HI> and least God in His Holy Justice should say to them, <HI>when I called upon you, you would not hear, now you cry to me, I will not answer you.</HI> I desire yet more especially, to warn all young Persons, to seek un∣to God in their Youth and in the Morning of their Days, as believing that their whole Life is but a short Time to prepare for Eternity; and to live in an holy walk with God, lest they should provoke God to leave them to fall into the same Sins which have been my Ruin. Pray, let my Advice to you never be for∣gotten by you, but take Example from me; take it as the words of a dying Friend and Neighbour, that you may not run on in sinning a∣gainst the blessed God, but that you may take warning by me, and may hearken to the Calls of God in the
<PB N="6" REF="001910_0057_0FB9D3442D1A8240"/>

Thus lea∣ving you to the Mercy of the great God, as I do my self likewise, I hope through the Merits of my dear Redeemer, we may have a happy Meeting in the great Day of the Lord. Take these warnings of a dying Man. And now, <HI>O Father of Mercies, Let these warnings do Good in the World, and let me who am leaving the World, find favour with thee, through the blessed Jesus, my only Saviour.</HI> Amen.</P>
