<P>BE IT KNOWN AND MANIFEST to all Persons whom this doth, shall, or may Concern, That on this Twenty-second Day of September, in the Year of our Lord One Thousand Seven Hundred and Sixty-seven, PERSONALLY came and appeared <HI>Gabriel Manigault, John Neusville, John Chapman, John Gordon, Thomas Shirley,</HI> and <HI>Henry Laurens,</HI> Merchants, dwelling in Charles-Town, in the Province aforesaid, who being severally and duly sworn upon the Holy Evangelists of Almighty God, made Oath and declared, That on or about the Twenty-sixth Day of May last past, there having been divers Complaints among the Merchants in the said Place, of enhanced Fees and Exactions at the Custom-House, since the Arrival of <HI>Daniel Moore,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Collector of the Customs; several of which Com∣plaints were founded upon Circumstances and Facts, within their own Knowledge; and also having heard that the said <HI>Daniel Moore,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> had contrary to the Practice of his Predecessor in Office, the late <HI>Hector Berenger De Beaufain,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> demanded and received Fees for granting or signing Indico Certificates; and further, that he had particularly required and insisted upon every decked Boat and Schooner going to any of the neighbouring Rivers and Plantations within this Province, whether loaden or light, to take out Registers, and also Permits from him the said Collector, as well as to enter into Bond; for which Bond and Permit, a certain Sum of Money was to be paid to the said Collector, and One-third Part of the said Sum to the Comptroller of the Customs: They the said <HI>Gabriel Manigault, John Neusville, John Chapman, John Gordon, Thomas Shirley,</HI> and <HI>Henry Laurens,</HI> did then, and at the particular Desire of a great Majority of the Merchants and Traders in Charles-Town, (and understanding at the same Time, that it would also be particularly agreeable to the Collector to have an Interview and Ecclaircissement with the Merchants) wait upon him the said Collector at his own House, as a Committee from the Body of Merchants, to Address and Remonstrate to him, upon the gene∣ral Complaints abovementioned. At their first Visit, the Collector not being pre∣pared to receive them, they the said Committee retired, and waited upon him again, by his own Appointment, the Day following; and then <HI>Gabriel Manigault,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> speaking on Behalf of the Rest, informed the Collector of the general Com∣plaint of Merchants and Masters of Vessels, that the Fees taken at the Custom-House were of late greatly increased, and that it had been also alledged, that Fees for signing Indico Certificates, contrary to Law and Custom, had of late been demanded, and taken by him the said Collector: That the Merchants were very sorry that there was any ground for Complaint, and that it was their earnest Wish and Desire, to maintain a right Understanding, and to live in Harmony with him the said Collector, as they had heretofore had the Happiness of in the Time of the late Collector, Mr. <HI>Hector Berenger De Beaufain:</HI> To the first Complaint, the Collector replied, that he could not Account for the Advance of Fees in any other Way than the Multiplicity of Bonds and Certificates required by late Acts of Parliament: To the second Complaint, his Answer was by no means Satisfactory, INASMUCH as his Apology was only this, That upon a Demand made of Mr. <HI>James Poyas,</HI> by the Collector's Clerk, for a Fee upon an Indico Certificate, which the said Mr. <HI>Poyas</HI> had paid, but murmured at it, as being an Exaction, the Collector had called to him as he was going out of the Custom-House, and said, "don't pay it Mr. <HI>Poyas,</HI> don't pay it;" whereas it was remarked to the Collector, that if instead of calling to Mr. <HI>Poyas</HI> not to pay the Fee, he had forbid his Clerk to receive it, and Chid him for his Presumption, that would have been more effectual. FURTHER the said Committee say, That in order to be explicit with the Collector, in one other Instance of what they apprehended to be an Exaction of Fees, and which was mentioned by Mr. <HI>Henry Laurens,</HI> in the Case of the Ship <HI>Anne, George
<PB N="4" REF="010748_0003_0F81745EB8891D30"/>
Forten,</HI> Master, of which the said <HI>Laurens</HI> was One-fourth Owner, cleared out a few Days before, for which Ship no less than <HI>Fourteen Pounds</HI> had been paid to the Collector only; whereas in similar Cases, while Mr. <HI>Beaufain</HI> was Collector, no more than <HI>Eight,</HI> or <HI>Eight Pounds Ten Shillings</HI> was wont to be paid: To which the Collector replied, That if Mr. <HI>Laurens</HI> would send Captain <HI>Forten</HI> next Day, with all his Papers, that he the Collector would examine into that Affair, and by a particular Account of the Fees, give Satisfaction, that no more had been taken than was really due; but if it should appear otherwise, he would make a Return. The COMMITTEE being satisfied with the Equity of this Proposal, rested upon the Assurances of the Collector, and soon after retired from him.</P>
<P>THE said <HI>Gabriel Manigault, John Neusville, John Chapman, John Gordon, Thomas Shirley,</HI> and <HI>Henry Laurens,</HI> each for himself, doth severally and respectively declare, That it was always his Wish and earnest Desire, to live in Peace with the said Collector, and to have paid to him upon every Occasion that should occur, his full and just Fees, according to Custom, and agreeable to any Law, and all the Laws relative to the American Trade, passed since the Decease of the late Col∣lector, <HI>Hector Berenger De Beaufain,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> That he and they severally and respectively never had any Design, Intention or Wish, to curtail such due Fees, or to impede or obstruct in any Degree, the said Collector, in the due, full, and legal Execu∣tion of his Office as Collector of the Customs: And that to the best of their Knowledge and Belief, jointly and severally, every Merchant in Charles-Town, was, in like Manner, favourably disposed towards the Collector, and heartily in∣clined to pay Obedience to Acts of the British Parliament.</P>

<P>BE IT KNOWN AND MANIFEST to all Persons whom this doth, shall, or may Concern, That on this Twenty-eighth Day of September, in the Year of our Lord One Thousand Seven Hundred and Sixty-seven, PERSONALLY came and appeared <HI>Henry Laurens,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> one of the Committee of the Merchants, and others, Traders in Charles-Town, and who hath been a British Merchant TWENTY-THREE YEARS; who being duly sworn upon the Holy Evangelists of Almighty God, maketh Oath and declares, That the Collector <HI>Daniel Moore,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> often endeavoured to persuade him the Deponent, that there was a Necessity for every Coasting Schooner or Schooners that passed Fort <HI>Johnson,</HI> to enter into Bond to him the Collector, and take out a Permit for Six Months; that there was no Medium between regularly entering and clearing such Schooners, although in Ballast, and only going to some of the neighbouring Plantations every Voyage, and taking such Certificates as he proposed; that if they did not comply with one or other, Seizure and Forfeiture must inevitably follow; and therefore he desired the said <HI>Henry Laurens</HI> to use his Influence with other the principal Merchants, that they might comply with his, the Collector's Proposition; adding, that several low Persons had offered to take such Permits, but that he chose to begin at the other End, or with other Sort of People; to which the said <HI>Henry Laurens</HI> replied in general, that he by no means thought it improper that some Part of the Coasting Trade should be under due Regulation; but that in the extensive Manner that the Collector required, it would
<PB N="5" REF="010748_0003_0F81745EB8891D30"/>
Distress the Province in general; that it would be impossible to comply with it, and that it would answer no good End to the Public; and besides, that if the Collector's Permits were to guard them effectually against Seizures from the Custom-House Officers on board of his Majesty's Ships, he the Deponent was of Opinion that such Permits might have a dangerous Tendency, and be made a Cloak for illicit and irregular Trade; but that nevertheless, if there was any Act of Parlia∣ment obliging such small Vessels to take Certificates, he should for his own Part, pay due Obedience to it as far as possible, and should also recommend the same to his Friends. The Collector assured the Deponent, that it was in his Power to compel all such Vessels to enter and clear every Trip they made to and from the Plantations: To which the Deponent replied, that he believed the Collector might by an Extension of his Power, create a great deal of Trouble to the People in Carolina, but that he was likewise certain, the Collector might also avoid giving them such Trouble, and yet not relax from his Duty; and that in his Opinion a mere Exertion of Power would finally be attended with no real Service to the King, nor was it to be set in Competition with the Affections of a whole Province, or Words to that Effect: And about the same Time the Deponent asked the Collector to favour him with a Sight of any Act of Parliament from whence he derived such Power and Authority, and also to inform him what Price or Fee he would demand for such Half yearly Certificates: The Deponent has forgot what Answer the Collector gave to the first Question, but he knows that the Collector never shewed him his Authority by Law, in Support of his Demand: But to the second, the Collector asked him what he thought of <HI>Half a Guinea</HI> for the Bond and Certificate; this Deponent answered, that if the Case was really as the Collector had represented to him, he thought the Collector's Demand was rather Indulgent. This Deponent further declares, that on the same Day, he heard the Honourable <HI>John Drayton,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and his Son <HI>William Henry Drayton,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> severally ask the Collector what was to be the Fee for such Bond and Certificate; and that the Collector replied to one <HI>Three Pounds Fifteen Shillings</HI> Current Money, and to the other <HI>Seven Pounds</HI> Current Money: That about the same Time he was informed by <HI>John Wragg,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> that the Collector had demanded of him an <HI>English Guinea</HI> for such Bond and Certificate; and he was also further informed, and hath since found it to be true, that the Collector had granted several of his Certificates at various Prices, some at <HI>Thirty Shillings,</HI> some at <HI>Forty Shillings</HI> Currency, and so forth: That upon hearing the Collector himself vary so much in his Demand, and also his declining or omitting to shew this Deponent his Authority, derived from any Statute or Act of Parliament, as well as doubting the Legality of his Permits to pass Fort <HI>Johnson,</HI> he thought and said, that the Collector did not Tread upon firm Ground, and therefore doubted whether he had any Authority for the Demands which he had made: And the said <HI>Henry Laurens</HI> also declareth, that about that Time, while he was further conversing with the Collector on the Subject above∣mentioned in the Custom-House, the Collector informed him that Captain <HI>Hawker,</HI> of his Majesty's Sloop <HI>Sardcine,</HI> had siezed one of the Coasting Schooners belonging to this Province; adding, that if he was to join Captain <HI>Hawker,</HI> in an Information or Prosecution against the said Schooner, she would certainly be condemned as forfeited; to which this Deponent replied, that he hoped then that HE the Collector would not join Captain <HI>Hawker,</HI> because if there was any Trans∣gression, it must have been the Effect of Inadvertence and Ignorance, since it was evident no Fraud was designed, as the Vessel had actually come into this Port or Harbour, under the immediate View of the Custom-House Officers; the Collector answered no, by no Means would he join Captain <HI>Hawker</HI>; but at the same Time advised the Deponent very earnestly, to speak to other Merchants, and to comply with his forementioned Proposition and Demand, which he added would be their only, or best Way, and then said he, your Vessels may sail in Safety.</P>
<P>THIS Deponent further declareth, That in Consequence of the Invitation or Permission given by the Collector, he directed <HI>George Forten,</HI> Master of the Ship <HI>Anne,</HI> together with <HI>John Hopton,</HI> Clerk to this Deponent, to wait upon the Col∣lector at the Custom-House, with all his Papers received at the Custom-House, at the clearing out the said Ship, in order to obtain a particular Account of the several Items, making up the said Sum of <HI>Fourteen Pounds.</HI> And that the said <HI>George
<PB N="6" REF="010748_0004_0F8174605CC60338"/>
Forten,</HI> and <HI>John Hopton,</HI> did accordingly attend the Collector at the Custom-House; from whence being returned, they informed this Deponent that the Collector had received them very angrily, and said, that as the Merchants were so exact with him, he would be so to them, and that not one Indulgence should be granted to them after that Time; and that he the Collector then produced an Account of his Fees for the said Ship <HI>Anne,</HI> which amounted to <HI>Fourteen Pounds Two Shillings and Six-pence</HI>; that he demanded immediate Payment of the additional <HI>Two Shillings and Six-pence,</HI> Carolina Currency, and declared that not one of the Ship's Papers should go out of the Office until the same was paid: That they attempted to expostulate upon this new Account, in order to shew certain Over-charges therein; but that the Collector would not hear them, but very wrathfully dismissed them, saying he would not lose his Time in Disputes: Which several Particulars will appear more at large in a Protest made by the said <HI>George Forten, John Hopton,</HI> and <HI>Henry Laurens,</HI> on the first of June, 1767, and is hereunto annexed. [<HI>Vide No.</HI> 1] And the said <HI>Henry Laurens</HI> further saith, That notwithstanding the Behaviour of the said <HI>Daniel Moore,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> as last abovementioned, so contrary to his Promises made to the Committee of Merchants, as well as to himself in particular; and notwithstanding his own Conviction, that the Collector had exacted Fees more than was due to him in that Case abovementioned, by inserting some Charges that were Fictions, as well as by a Duplicity of others; yet willing as much as in him lay, to preserve Harmony, and keep up a good Understanding with the Collector, and also to shew all possible Respect to one of his Majesty's Officers, in so high a Rank as the Collector of the Customs, he went on the Day following, (to wit, the 29th of May) to the Custom-House, and there addressed the Collector in respectful Terms, and desired to Remonstrate upon the Subject of the Charges abovementioned; that the Collector went towards his Desk as if he meant to examine into the said Complaint, but suddenly turned about, and in some Warmth, said it was an Holyday, that he was busy, and should be more so presently: Whereupon the Deponent answered, that he saw the Custom-House open, and therefore came in, not merely to ask a Favour, but to apply for Redress in a Matter wherein he thought himself aggrieved, and that he now requested the Collector to inform him whether he would grant him such Redress or not: The Collector then desired him to defer the Business until the Saturday Afternoon following, and then if the Deponent would attend him at the Custom-House, he would Retrospect the Account aforementioned: And the said <HI>Henry Laurens</HI> further saith, That having other Busi∣ness to transact at the Custom-House, he went there on Saturday Morning, and that the Collector then told him he need not be at the Trouble of coming in the Afternoon according to Appointment, for he determined to return no Part of the Fees taken for clearing out the Ship <HI>Anne,</HI> and that he took that as an Opportunity to inform the Deponent; whereupon the said <HI>Henry Laurens</HI> thinking himself greatly injured, and oppressed by the said Collector, caused the Protest before referred to, to be extended on Behalf of himself and others, Owners of the said Ship <HI>Anne,</HI> (to wit, on the first of June, 1767). And the said <HI>Henry Laurens</HI> further saith, That some Days after the said Protest was made, <HI>Miles Brewton,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> in the Pre∣sence of a great Number of principal Merchants in Charles-Town, declared unto the said <HI>Henry Laurens,</HI> that he was authorized by the Collector to inform him, that he had further considered the Fees taken on the Ship <HI>Anne,</HI> and was convinced that they were too high by <HI>Forty Shillings</HI>; which <HI>Forty Shillings</HI> Mr. <HI>Laurens</HI> might receive whenever he would call for it: To which the said <HI>Henry Laurens</HI> answered, that he thought the Fees were too high by <HI>Four Pounds Ten Shillings</HI> at least, but that he was not contending for <HI>Forty Shillings,</HI> but for Right and Justice to the whole Trade, and therein as he conceived, to the whole Province; nevertheless, as he always preferred moderate Measures, if Mr. <HI>Brewton</HI> would promise that the Collector would make Restitution to other People who were in like Manner aggrieved, and also forbear to exact more Fees than were due to him in future, he the Deponent should take no further Notice of what had happened between the Collector and himself; but Mr. <HI>Brewton</HI> would not engage so extensively, not being thereunto authorized by the Collector: And the said <HI>Henry Laurens</HI> declares, that he has never since received, nor hath any offer been made to him, either of the <HI>Forty Shillings,</HI> or any other Sum by way of Restitution, in the Case aforemen∣tioned.
<PB N="7" REF="010748_0004_0F8174605CC60338"/>
The said Deponent further declareth, That on or about the Twenty-ninth Day of May last, he went to the Custom-House in order to clear out his Schooner <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbaw,</HI> for his Plantation in the River <HI>Alatamaha</HI> in <HI>Georgia,</HI> having Four hundred and fifty Bushels of Indian Corn on board, and to enter into Bond required for Non-enumerated Goods, declaring to the Collector, that his said Plantation was situated where there was no Port of Entry, nor any Custom-House within Forty Miles, or thereabouts; and that therefore he could not return a Certificate or other Documents strictly, according to Law: That the Collector upon that Repre∣sentation, declined taking the Bond required for Non-enumerated Goods; and as the said <HI>Henry Laurens</HI> apprehended, he the Collector acquiesced, and was satisfied as to the Return of the Vessel without regular Clearances, from a Place where they could not possibly be obtained: And this Deponent further declares, That after his said Vessel sailed for <HI>Alatamaha</HI> aforesaid, he went to the same Place, where he found that the Master of the said Schooner had taken on board her about Fifty Thousand Cypress Shingles, without the Knowledge or Consent of the said <HI>Henry Laurens,</HI> partly for Ballast, (as the said Master hath declared upon Oath, there being neither Stones nor Sand proper for Ballast in that Part of the Country, the whole Face of the River being Marsh and Swamp Mud) and partly in hopes of paying a small Part of the very heavy Expences attending such a Voyage, undertaken solely for the Purpose of carrying Provisions to a new settled Plantation, in a wild and unpeopled Part of his Majesty's Colony of <HI>Georgia</HI>; that finding the Vessel had taken such Shingles on board, the Deponent in order to shew all possible Obedience to British Acts of Parliament, directed the Master of the said Schooner <HI>Wambaw,</HI> to apply to two of the nearest Magistrates, and to enter into Bond, with one sufficient Surety, to our Sovereign Lord the King, in a Penalty of double the Value of the said Shingles, conditioned for Delivery of the said Shingles, agreeable to an Act of Parliament, from an Apprehension, that Shingles was one of the Articles spe∣cified as Lumber in the Statute of the viii. of GEORGE I. <HI>Ch.</HI> 12, <HI>S.</HI> 2; and which Article of Shingles had always been deemed as Lumber in the Custom-House at Charles-Town; and for Want of better Information in that wild and remote Part of the World, where Acts of Parliament are not; and that two Magistrates, viz. <HI>John Polson,</HI> and <HI>Donald Mc Kay,</HI> Esqrs. did grant the said Master a Certificate, setting forth, That he had delivered the Corn beforementioned; that he had entered into Bond, and also that there was no Custom-House nor Officers within many Miles of the said Place: And the said <HI>Henry Laurens</HI> further saith, That after taking such Steps, which were the best that he could take in those Circumstances, he directed the said Master, with his Schooner, to return to Charles-Town, and gave Orders immediately, upon Arrival of the said Schooner, to enter her at the Custom-House, and Report the said Fifty Thousand Shingles, the whole net Value of which was not above <HI>Six Pounds</HI> Sterling, when Cost and Charges were paid. And the Deponent further saith, That notwithstanding the said Collector had declined to take a Bond from him for Non-enumerated Goods on board the said Schooner <HI>Wambaw,</HI> at her Departure from Charles-Town, which tended to mislead and insnare the said <HI>Henry Laurens</HI>; and even to endanger his Schooner to Seizure, before and after her Departure from Charles-Town: That notwithstanding the Declaration made by the Deponent, that there was no Custom-House nor Officers at the Port or Place to which his Schooner was bound, and from whence she was to return; which FACT the Collector has admitted and acknowledged upon Oath, in the Court of Vice-Admiralty: And also notwithstanding the fair, candid, and open Procedure of the said <HI>Henry Laurens,</HI> and his Endeavours to comply with the Modes and Forms of Law, as far as the Nature of the Case would admit of; and that no Fraud or illicit Trade had been carried on or attempted by the said Schooner <HI>Wambaw,</HI> yet the said Collector refused to admit the said Schooner to an Entry, unless two particular Friends of the said <HI>Henry Laurens,</HI> (in his Absence) should go to the Custom-House, and there in Person, ask it as a great Favour; which Fact is well attested upon Record in the Court of Vice-Admiralty: And finally, because the said Persons declined or omitted to ask such Favour in the Way and Manner that he required, he gave Orders and caused the said Schooner <HI>Wambaw</HI> to be seized and libeled in the Court of Vice-Admiralty, where the said Schooner <HI>Wambaw</HI> hath since been condemned as forfeited.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="010748_0005_0F817460F6F7BF30"/>AND the said <HI>Henry Laurens</HI> declareth, that on or about the Seventeenth of June last, he went to the Custom-House with <HI>Peter Bachop,</HI> Master of another Schooner belonging to the Deponent, called the <HI>Broughton-Island Packet,</HI> in order to clear out the said Schooner for the same Plantation, with Provisions, Bricks, and a few other Necessaries for the Use of his said Plantation, exactly in the same Circum∣stances as the last mentioned Schooner <HI>Wambaw</HI>; and that the same Master tendered a Manifest, setting forth the Provision and other Articles on board, and that the Vessel was bound to <HI>Broughton-Island</HI> in the River <HI>Alatamaha,</HI> where there was no Port of Entry, or Custom-House, and from whence no Certificate could be returned. That the said <HI>Daniel Moore</HI> took up the Manifest, and without Preface or Reason assigned, insulted him the Deponent, alledging, that he could make his Plantation to be in <HI>Georgia</HI> or <HI>South-Carolina,</HI> as it should suit best his Purpose: The Deponent conscious of the Injustice of such a Charge, inasmuch as the Locality of the said Plantation had been declared upon Oath before the Collector, at clearing out the Schooner <HI>Wambaw</HI> Twenty-one Days before; replied in general, that he knew where he was, in the King's Custom-House; that he paid all Obedience to his Majesty, and due Respect to his Officers; but as to the Collector, as Mr. <HI>Moore,</HI> he heartily despised him, and that he had heard his Fame Twenty-five Years ago; that if he had presumed so to insult the Deponent in any other Place, he should have given him another, or proper Answer; that the Custom-House was not a Place for Quarrels, and therefore prayed that his Business might be dispatched, and he permitted to retire: But the Collector continued indiscreetly to Wrangle and Clamour at the Deponent, and at length called the Deponent aside in the Custom-House, and there gave him a formal Challenge, to fight at some Place in the Province of <HI>Georgia,</HI> which the Collector promised to appoint, and give him Notice of in writing; but the Deponent doth not charge the Collector with having sent him such Notice, as he never did receive any such.</P>
<P>AND this Deponent further saith, That after the said Schooner was cleared out, she proceeded to the said Plantation, and there delivered the Cargo before-menti∣oned; then took Ballast of Wood on board for want of Sand or Stones as aforesaid, and returned to Charles-Town immediately, where he applied to enter the said Vessel by Manifest, declaring that she was in Ballast only, having no Goods on board for Sale or Merchandize, and that she came from a Place where there was no Port of Entry, nor Custom-House Officers within many Miles; but the Collector refused to admit the Vessel, caused her to be seized, and libeled in the Court of Vice-Admiralty, in which Court the said Vessel has been acquitted, and Costs decreed against the Prosecutor: Yet nevertheless, the Deponent hath been put to very great Charges, Trouble, and loss of Time thereby. And lastly, this Depo∣nent declareth, That he paid to the Collector Fees for clearing out the Schooner <HI>Wambaw, Three Pounds Fifteen Shillings</HI>; and for clearing out the Schooner <HI>Broughton-Island Packet, Five Pounds Twelve Shillings and Six-pence,</HI> making a Difference of <HI>One Pound Seventeen Shillings and Six-pence</HI> in so small a Sum, and that there was no Difference in the Circumstances of the two Vessels, or in their respective Documents, save only, a Pond for Non-enumerated Goods, which was taken in the latter, and not in the former Case.</P>

<P>BE IT KNOWN AND MANIFEST to all Persons whom this doth, shall, or may Concern, That on this Twenty-third Day of September, in the Year of our Lord One Thousand Seven Hundred and Sixty-seven, PERSONALLY came and appeared <HI>John Edwards,</HI> of Charles-Town, Merchant, and who hath been Resident there for FIFTEEN YEARS last past, who being duly sworn upon the Holy Evan∣gelists of Almighty God, maketh Oath and declares, That on or about the Eleventh Day of June last past, he applied at the Custom-House for five Certificates for bondable Goods landed in Charles-Town from Great-Britain; that in Consequence thereof, after comparing the Marks and Numbers of the Packages of the said Goods, the Certificates were made out, and signed by <HI>Daniel Moore,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> the Collector, and delivered to the Deputy-Comptroller, to be signed by him: The Deponent then asked the Collector what was the Charge for said Certificates, and was referred by him to his Clerk. The Clerk informed him <HI>Ten Shillings</HI> each Certificate, which the Deponent was proceeding to pay, but the Clerk added, that he must also pay for searching the Cockets; to which the Deponent replied, that he imagined he the Clerk had no right to make him pay for that; whereupon the Collector, <HI>Daniel Moore,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> without saying one Word, came in a Passion from a distant Part of the Room, took up the five Certificates, tore them in Pieces, and told the Deponent that he should go and procure a Certificate from the Searchers before he would grant him any Certificates, and that he might seek his Remedy where he pleased. The said <HI>John Edwards</HI> further saith, That on the Twelfth Day of June last past, he went to the Custom-House to clear the Ship <HI>Fair American, John Minshall,</HI> Master, for <HI>Liverpool</HI>; that the Collector observing one Pipe of Wine inserted in the Manifest; he asked if the King's Duty was paid for it, and was answered that it was imported by Messrs. <HI>Brailsford</HI> and <HI>Chapman,</HI> of Charles-Town, Merchants, and the Duty secured; which was confirmed by Mr. <HI>Hatley,</HI> the Collector's Clerk, who assured him, more than once, that the Duty was secured; nevertheless, the Collector (merely as the Deponent believes, to impede his Business and to put him to Trouble) refused to clear the Ship before Messrs. <HI>Brailsford</HI> and <HI>Chapman</HI> were sent for to pay the said Duty. Whereupon Mr. <HI>Edward Blake,</HI> a Merchant in Charles-Town, being present, went to call the said <HI>Brailsford</HI> and <HI>Chapman,</HI> or one of them; and Mr. <HI>Chapman</HI> came, and complained that the Collector so much doubted their Credit, as to refuse clearing a Ship on Account of the Duty upon a single Pipe of Wine, when the Duty of the whole Cargo, and of which that was Part, was secured by their Note; and added, that he had brought Money with him to pay the said Note:—That the Collector denied that he had refused to clear the Ship on that Account.—The Fact being so plain, the Deponent, and the said Master, <HI>John Minshall,</HI> being detained upon that Account only, and the Deponent's Veracity questioned; he the Deponent did modestly assure the Collector, that he had said, the Ship should not be cleared before the Money was paid; to which the Collector hastily answered, "it is false." The Deponent then endeavoured to exculpate himself, by repeating the Collector's own Words, spoke in Presence of so many People as were then in the Custom-House; but the Collector interrupted, and threatened to turn him down Stairs out of the Custom-House; which the Deponent conceiving to be grievous and injurious Treatment to one of his Majesty's Subjects, who had always demeaned himself becomingly to all his Majesty's Officers; and also a great Impediment and Hinderance to Commerce, as well as a Discouragement to his Majesty's dutiful Subjects, British Merchants residing in America, did presume to Reply, That while he had Business to do in Office Hours, he had a good Right to be in the Custom-House, and that if the Collector turned him out, it must be at his own Peril. [<HI>To Coroborate the preceding Para∣graph,</HI> Vide <HI>the following Affidavit of</HI> John Chapman.]</P>
<P>AND this Deponent, <HI>John Edwards,</HI> further declares, That being so unkindly and unjustly treated by the Collector, as is before set forth, he did not attend minutely to the Sum paid by him to the Collector for clearing out the Ship <HI>Fair American</HI>; but he declareth, That on or about the Twentieth of May last past, he cleared out the new Ship <HI>Liberty, John Lesley,</HI> Master, for <HI>Bristol,</HI> and the Collector himself demanded of him <HI>Fourteen Pounds</HI> for his Fees; but upon the Deponent's desiring him to reconsider it, the Collector after whispering to his
<PB N="10" REF="010748_0006_0F817465F6E4FA80"/>
Clerk, replied <HI>Eight Pounds</HI>; which Sum the Deponent paid: The Deponent saith, that he knows of no Difference between that Ship's Circumstances and those of other Ships as to her Documents from the Custom-House, save only, that she was not entered Inward, being a new Ship, which might make a Difference of <HI>Two Pounds Ten Shillings,</HI> and no more, to the best of his Knowledge; and further, that from the Practices of the said Collector, ever since he has acted in that Office, he doth in his Conscience verily believe, that if he had paid him the first Sum of <HI>Fourteen Pounds</HI> demanded, that the Collector would not have returned him any Part thereof.</P>

he hath been well informed the Collector hath no Right to charge, by any Act of Parliament, or Precedent from the late Collector, <HI>Hector Berenger De Beaufain,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and more particularly, a Certificate that Bond for Non-enumerated Goods was given; which Certificate by an Act of the IVth of his present Majesty, entitled, <HI>An</HI> Act <HI>for granting certain Duties in the British Colonies and Plantations in America, &amp;c.</HI> is expressly required to be given without Fee or Reward. This Deponent further saith, That being almost a Stranger, and not long acquainted with such Business, he could not take upon him with any Assurance of Success, to controvert the above∣said Charge with the Collector, although he had good Reason to believe that he was aggrieved; but that as he was afterwards complaining to some of his Acquain∣tance of the great Difference in the Charges at the Custom-House since <HI>Daniel Moore,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> presided there as Collector, he discovered that the Sloop <HI>Elizabeth, James Gillchrist,</HI> Master, had been cleared out since the Sloop <HI>Henry,</HI> and that he paid the Collector only <HI>Ten Pounds</HI> Fees, although the Circumstances of Cargo, and loading the said two Sloops were alike, or nearly alike: For the Truth of which, he refers to a regular Protest, or Affidavit made by the said <HI>Gillchrist,</HI> in which the said <HI>Gillchrist</HI> likewise shews, that the Collector had exacted more Fees from him than were due.

<P>BE IT KNOWN AND MANIFEST to all Persons whom this doth, shall, or may Concern, That on this Twenty-fifth Day of September, in the Year of our Lord One Thousand Seven Hundred and Sixty-seven, PERSONALLY appeared <HI>George Smith,</HI> of Charles-Town, Merchant, who being duly sworn upon the Holy Evange∣lists of Almighty God, maketh Oath and declares, That he hath been in Trade up∣wards of SEVENTEEN YEARS, on his own Account, during which Time he has loaded and cleared upwards of Forty Vessels with Cargoes for Great-Britain and America; and that he hath observed of late, since <HI>Daniel Moore,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> has acted as Collector in the Custom-House, that the Fees paid to him for entering and clearing of Vessels are greatly enhanced beyond the Fees formerly paid to <HI>Hector Berenger De Beaufain,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> the late Collector; and particularly, that on the Thirtieth of April, 1767, the Collector demanded of him <HI>Twelve Pounds</HI> Currency, for clearing out the Brigantine <HI>Thomas, John Banfield,</HI> Master; to which Sum this Deponent objected, as being too high; and he finds on examining his Books, that he cleared out a Brigantine called the <HI>Roach,</HI> commanded by the said <HI>John Banfield,</HI> of and about the same burthen as the <HI>Thomas,</HI> viz. in May, 1764, nearly in the same Circum∣stances, when he paid only <HI>Eight Pounds</HI>; and if there was any Difference, such Difference was only of one Bond, <HI>(to wit)</HI> the <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ach</HI> was bonded for enumerated Commodities, but none for Lumber or Non-enumerated Goods; and for the Brigantine <HI>Thomas,</HI> Bond had been given for Lumber and Non-enumerated Goods but no Bond for enumerated Goods; but to the best of his Remembrance and Belief, only the Lumber Bond was given; which Difference, (if any) of one Bond he apprehends could not possibly Advance the Fees Fifty per Cent. After the said <HI>George Smith,</HI> this Deponent, (and who is Deaf and did not distinctly hear the Words of the Collector) had gone from the Custom-House, the said Captain

<HI>Banfield</HI> told him, that Mr. <HI>Moore,</HI> the Collector, replied, on the said Deponent's objecting to the Fees, if you don't chuse to pay that Sum, you may leave your Papers. This Deponent therefore, to avoid the manifest Losses and Hardships that must have attended the Delay of a loaded Vessel at that Season of the Year, when the Worms distroy Ship's Bottoms every Hour, the said <HI>George Smith</HI> sub∣mitted, and paid the said Sum of <HI>Twelve Pounds</HI> to the Collector, thinking himself greatly aggrieved thereby at the same Time.</P>

<P>BE IT KNOWN AND MANIFEST to all Persons whom this doth, shall or may Concern, That on this Twenty-fifth Day of September, in the Year of our Lord One Thousand Seven Hundred and Sixty-seven, PERSONALLY came and appeared <HI>John Logan,</HI> a British Merchant, residing in Charles-Town, and who being duly sworn upon the Holy Evangelists of Almighty God, maketh Oath and declares, That he hath been in Trade for NINE YEARS past, loaded many Vessels, and hath imported and exported Goods, Wares, and Merchandizes, lawfully, to a very considerable Amount: The said <HI>John Logan</HI> saith, That on or about the Sixth of June last, himself and <HI>Robert Cleiland</HI> went to clear out the Ship <HI>Nelson,</HI> of <HI>London,</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="010748_0007_0F817466A6FCBA68"/>
of which the said <HI>Robert Cleiland</HI> was Master, for <HI>Grenada</HI>; which Ship had been loaded on Account of Messrs. <HI>Nelson</HI> &amp; <HI>Burnet,</HI> Sir <HI>George Colebrook,</HI> and <HI>Archibald Stewart,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Owners of the said Ship; and that the Collector did then demand and take for clearing out the said Vessel, the Sum of <HI>Fourteen Pounds Ten Shillings,</HI> as doth appear by the Captain's Protest, and the Collector's Bill thereon, which are hereunto annexed; which Sum the said <HI>John Logan</HI> believing to be exorbitant, and being convinced thereof in his own Mind from Comparison of former nume∣rous Instances, of clearing out Ships in similar Circumstances, he applied to <HI>Daniel Moore,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Collector, desiring him to reconsider the said Charge of Fees; but receiving no satisfactory Answer, he the Deponent added, that he should be obliged to seek elsewhere for Redress; to which the Collector replied, that he might seek where he would for Redress; that he would not return the Deponent one Farthing of the said Sum of <HI>Fourteen Pounds Ten Shillings.</HI> And the said Deponent thinking it a Duty incumbent upon him, as well toward the Public, as to the Owners of the said Ship <HI>Nelson,</HI> to seek for Redress under such Oppression; he took Council, and was advised to inform against the said <HI>Daniel Moore,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and to prosecute him for Extortion, at the next Court of General Sessions, to be holden in Charles-Town, the third Monday in October next: And the Deponent saith, That in Consequence of that Advice, he did lodge an Information with the Clerk of the Crown, and one of the Assistant Judges of the said Court, and was himself bound, with two sufficient Sureties, in a Recognizance to prosecute the Collector at the said Court as aforesaid; and that he was then given to understand by <HI>Dougal Campbell,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Clerk of the Crown, that the said <HI>Daniel Moore</HI> was likewise to be bound over, to be and appear at the said Court of Sessions, to answer to the Information and Complaint aforesaid.</P>
<P>AND the Deponent further saith, That within Fourteen Days last past, hearing that <HI>Daniel Moore,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> had suddenly disappeared, and that it was supposed he had gone privately out of the Province, he applied to the said <HI>Dougal Campbell,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>
Clerk of the Crown and Pleas, to know if proper Security had been taken for the said Collector's Appearance at the Court as aforesaid; but he was referred by him to the Honourable <HI>Robert Pringle,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> one of the Assistant Judges in this Province, who had granted the Warrant against the Collector when the Information or Com∣plaint was first made. The Deponent then applied to the said <HI>Robert Pringle,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR>
and was informed by him, that the Collector had behaved very dishonorably in that Affair, having made several Promises verbally, and in writing, to call upon him, in order to enter into a proper Recognizance for his Appearance; that believing the said Collector to be a Gentleman, and a Man of Honor, he had too long relied upon his Promises, for that he found the said Collector had only intended to deceive him, and that therefore he the said Assistant Judge, had issued a Warrant to apprehend and take the Body of the said Collector; but that he could not yet be found: The Deponent further saith, That the said <HI>Robert Pringle,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> promised to give him a true State of the Case in writing; which when the Deponent receives, it shall be hereunto annexed.—[Vide <HI>Affidavit or Protest, No.</HI> 3, <HI>of</HI> Robert Pringle, <HI><ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and Declaration, No.</HI> 8, <HI>of Captain</HI> Cleiland.]</P>

<P>AND these Deponents further declare, That they have examined a certain Book, kept by the said <HI>Hector Berenger De Beaufain,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> put into their Hands by <HI>David Rhind,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Executor of his last Will and Testament; and that they have there seen, that for clearing Ships, Snows, and Brigantines, from the Fifteenth of May, One Thousand Seven Hundred and Forty-seven, to the Twenty-eighth Day of December, One Thousand Seven Hundred and Sixty-four, to any of the British Dominions, (entry Inwards included) one with another, did not exceed <HI>Eight Pounds Six Shillings and Nine-pence</HI>; Sloops and Schooners <HI>Six Pounds Twelve Shillings and Seven-pence,</HI> and for Ships, Brigantines and Snows, bound to Europe, Southward of <HI>Cape Finestere, Eleven Pounds Nine Shillings and Eight-pence,</HI> Current Money, for the said Collector's Fees; that in the Margin of the said Book, the following Words are written in Mr. <HI>De Beaufain</HI>'s own Hand, "THE REGISTERING OF SEAMEN WAS DISCONTINUED FROM THE TWENTIETH OF SEPTEMBER, ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY-FIVE:" And that from another Book, received from the said Mr. <HI>Rhind,</HI> it appears, that the said Collector received for entering in and clear∣ing out Ships, bound to Europe, Southward of <HI>Cape Finestere,</HI> from the Eleventh of March, One Thousand Seven Hundred and Sixty-five, to the Thirtieth of June, One Thousand Seven Hundred and Sixty-six, both inclusive, <HI>Nine Pounds Ten Shillings,</HI> Current Money; and during the same Period, for entering and clearing out for any Parts of the British Dominions, he took <HI>Eight Pounds</HI> for Ships, and <HI>Six Pounds Ten Shillings,</HI> like Money, for Sloops and Schooners, or not exceeding those Sums. And it appears to us, that such further or additional Fees or Charges as can or may be legally demanded and taken by the Collector, for
<PB N="23" REF="010748_0012_0F81746AB8574760"/>
Bonds and other Papers necessary or required by the Acts of Parliament passed in the Fourth and Fifth Years of his present Majesty's Reign, relating to the Entry or Clearance of Vessels ought not, in any Instance, to exceed <HI>Three Pounds</HI> Currency. And these Deponents do further declare, That it was always their earnest Desire and Wish, and they have the greatest Reason to believe ALSO, that it was the earnest Wish and Desire of the Merchants in Charles-Town, to have liquidated and establish∣ed with the present Collector, <HI>Daniel Moore,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> some such, or other reasonable and equitable, legal or customary Fees, for the Government both of the Collector and the Merchants. And in their Opinion, nothing on their Part hath been wanting to bring the same to Effect, as they are fully convinced, that they are sincerely disposed and willing to pay all lawful Duties and Customs; but too tender of their Rights and Liberties as British Subjects, to subimt tamely to repeated illegal Impositions.</P>

<P><HI>e</HI> This only when short is a Change of Masters.</P>
<P>If a Register is lost or mislaid, the Master must give Bond with proper Security for Licence to load; and for this he is to pay a Fee of <HI>Forty Shillings</HI> Currency.</P>
<P>It was Customary with Mr. <HI>Beaufain,</HI> when Vessels cleared out in Ballast, to take only half Fees; but this is optional in the Officers, whether to follow the same Practice or not.</P>

<P>BY THIS PUBLIC INSTRUMENT OF PROTEST, be it known to all whom it doth, shall, or may Concern, That before me FENWICKE BULL, one of His Majesty's Justices assigned to keep the Peace in <HI>Berkley</HI> County, and Notary-Public duly admitted and sworn, dwelling in Charles-Town, in the Province aforesaid, PERSONALLY appeared <HI>George Forten,</HI> Master of the Ship <HI>Anne,</HI> of <HI>Bristol; John Hopton,</HI> Clerk to <HI>Henry Laurens,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of Charles-Town, Merchant, and the said <HI>Henry Laurens,</HI> part Owner of the said Ship <HI>Anne,</HI> who being severally and duly sworn on the Holy Evangelists of Almighty God, each for himself, and not one for the other, did depose and declare upon Oath as follows, <HI>Scilicet.</HI></P>
<P>HENRY LAURENS, deposeth and saith, That on Saturday the Twenty-third Day of May last past, he sent his Clerk, the said <HI>John Hopton,</HI> with Captain <HI>George Forten,</HI> to clear out the said Ship <HI>Anne</HI> at the Custom-House, and other publick Offices, and gave him the said <HI>John,</HI> a certain Sum of Money, in order to pay the customary Fees: That upon the Return of his said Clerk, <HI>John Hopton,</HI> he brought him the Deponent an Account of the Money paid by him for clearing out the said Ship <HI>Anne</HI>; and among other Articles, he observed the Sum of <HI>Fourteen Pounds</HI> Currency, paid to the Collector <HI>Daniel Moore,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> which he the said <HI>Henry Laurens</HI> objected to, and asked how that could possibly be; and asked if he did not include the Comptroller's Fees also: To which his said Clerk replied, that it was only the Fees paid to the Collector; and that he had also paid <HI>Three Pounds Ten Shillings</HI> Currency, as a One-third Part of <HI>Fourteen Pounds</HI> to the Comptroller, over and above the said <HI>Fourteen Pounds:</HI> That he the Clerk complained to Mr. <HI>Hatley,</HI> who signed the <HI>Anne</HI>'s Clearances, as Deputy-Collector, that the said <HI>Fourteen Pounds</HI> was too high a Charge; and that Mr. <HI>Hatley,</HI> the Deputy, answered, "It is no more than is due upon so large a Ship." The said <HI>Henry Laurens</HI> further saith, That being one of a Committee, (appointed by the Body of British Merchants, residing and trading in Charles-Town, aforesaid) to wait upon <HI>Daniel Moore,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Collector of the Customs in Charles-Town aforesaid, in order to seek for Redress or Satisfaction, in divers Cases, wherein the said Body of Mer∣chants apprehended the Trade of this Province had been greatly aggrieved since
<PB N="27" REF="010748_0014_0F81746C844CCCB0"/>
the said <HI>Daniel Moore,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> came into the Exercise of his said Office.—He this Deponent, accompanied <HI>Gabriel Manigault,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Messieurs <HI>Thomas Shirley, John Neusville, John Gordon,</HI> and <HI>John Chapman,</HI> nominated to be of the said Committee, and did on the Twenty-sixth Day of May aforesaid, wait upon <HI>Daniel Moore,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Collector, by Appointment, at his own House in Charles-Town; where being met, divers Instances of late Charges in the Custom-House, which the Merchants apprehended were excessive and illegal, were produced by <HI>Gabriel Manigault,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> speaking on Behalf of the Merchants in general, to which such Answers were given by the Collector, as may or shall appear in due Time and Place: That he the said <HI>Henry Laurens</HI> took that Occasion and Opportunity to move in the most respectful Manner, to the said Collector, the Complaint that he (the Deponent) in particular had to make of <HI>Fourteen Pounds</HI> paid to the Collector, only for clearing out the Ship <HI>Anne,</HI> which he apprehended was an excessive Charge, because in similar Cases he had never paid the late Collector, <HI>Hector Berenger De Beaufain,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> in a Course of many Years, above <HI>Eight Pounds Ten Shillings</HI> Currency; and some∣times when a Paper or Document, less than ordinary was required, not above <HI>Seven Pounds Fifteen Shillings and Six-pence:</HI> To which the said <HI>Daniel Moore,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> replied in general, that he took no other Fees than such as he found by a List in the Custom-House had been formerly taken there; that he could Account for the late Difference of Charges on Ships, only from the Multiplicity of additional Papers, required to be taken or executed, by late Acts of Parliament; and par∣ticularly as to the Case of the Ship <HI>Anne.</HI>—That if Mr. <HI>Laurens</HI> would send Captain <HI>Forten,</HI> with all his Papers, to the Custom-House, he would make out an Account of the particular Items in the said <HI>Fourteen Pounds,</HI> and convince him that no more had been taken by the Collector than his legal Fees. And the said <HI>Henry Laurens</HI> further saith, That in Consequence of the Proposition made by the Collector as abovementioned, he ordered his said Clerk, <HI>John Hopton,</HI> to accom∣pany Captain <HI>George Forten</HI> to the Custom-House, there to produce all his Papers, and apply to the Collector for the particular Articles contained in the said <HI>Fourteen Pounds</HI> paid as aforesaid, and bring the same to him the said <HI>Henry.</HI></P>
<P>GEORGE FORTEN, Master of the Ship <HI>Anne,</HI> deposeth and saith, That he saw <HI>John Hopton</HI> pay <HI>Fourteen Pounds</HI> to the said Mr. <HI>R. P. H. Hatley,</HI> the Deputy, for the Collector's Fees only; that he heard him the said <HI>Hopton</HI> complain that the Charge was too high, and Mr. <HI>Hatley</HI>'s reply, that it was no more than was due. And he this Deponent further saith, That he signed no Bond at the Custom-House, received no Cockets from thence, nor did he apply for, or want any: That he registered no Seamen there, being not required thereunto, either by the Collector or his Deputy; nor as he conceives, by any Law whatsoever, nor by any late Practices in the Custom-House; and that all the Articles which he appre∣hends the Collector could legally, and according to Custom, charge him for on Account of his said Ship <HI>Anne,</HI> at the Time of clearing her out, <HI>viz.</HI> on the Twenty-third Instant, are,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1st. £. 5 0 0 For entering and clearing in general.</ITEM>

£. 7 17 6 The whole Amount of which, according to the stated Rules of the late <HI>Hector Berenger De Beaufain,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Collector as aforesaid, and his Predecessor in Office, <HI>Thomas Gadsden,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> as he hath also been well informed, would Amount only to <HI>Seven Pounds Fifteen Shillings and Six-pence,</HI> current Money, to the present Collector, or thereabouts, little more or less. And the said <HI>George Forten,</HI> further saith, That upon the Infor∣mation of the said <HI>Henry Laurens,</HI> that the Collector desired him to attend at the Custom-House, with all his Ship's Papers; he went thither accordingly on the
<PB N="28" REF="010748_0015_0F8174718319C320"/>
Twenty-eighth of said May last past, at Ten o'Clock in the Forenoon, in hopes of obtaining Redress whenever the Collector should be pleased to retrospect the Papers and Accounts before mentioned; and that <HI>John Hopton,</HI> who had paid the above∣mentioned <HI>Fourteen Pounds,</HI> accompanied him: That when the said <HI>Daniel Moore,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> came into the Custom-House, he the said <HI>George Forten</HI> addressed him the Collector in the following Words, or Words to the same Effect <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>Sir, I shall be much obliged to you to give me the particular Articles of your Charge of <HI>Fourteen Pounds,</HI> paid for clearing out my Ship the <HI>Anne</HI> Saturday last:</Q>
To which the said Collector in reply, asked, "if he had not a Bill of the Fees as usual from each Officer?" and the said <HI>George Forten</HI> answered, you misunder∣stand me, Sir,—I desire a particular Account of your own Charges making up <HI>Fourteen Pounds,</HI> 'tis a considerable deal more than I ever paid before in this Port to the Collector, for which Reason my Owners at <HI>Bristol</HI> will require me to explain that Article.—That the Collector with some warmth answered, I have no Objection to giving what you demand; but since the Merchants require so much Exactness in me, I shall use the same Method towards them, and whatever comes within the Verge of Acts of Parliament, shall be strictly complied with, and not one Indul∣gence shall be granted to them hereafter; perhaps your Fees may exceed my Charge, which I find they do by <HI>Two Shillings and Six-pence</HI>; and then producing an Account of Particulars, amounting to <HI>Fourteen Pounds Two Shillings and Six-pence,</HI> demanded Payment of the Deficiency of <HI>Two Shillings and Six-pence</HI> Currency, (equal to <HI>Four-pence</HI> Sterling) otherwise he the Collector declared not one of his Papers should go out of the Office.</P>
<P>JOHN HOPTON, deposeth and saith, That upon the Collector's speaking as last above-mentioned, he took up the said Account, of which the following is an exact Copy, and the Original hereunto annexed compared therewith, by me, the the said Notary, <HI>VIZ.</HI>

And said to the Collector, Sir, you have charged here to make up your Sum of <HI>Fourteen Pounds</HI> paid on Saturday, <HI>Twenty Shillings</HI> for a Post-Entry, which was not made, nor even thought of before Monday; therefore there still appears an over Charge of <HI>Seventeen Shillings and Six-pence</HI> for clearing out: The Collector angrily answered, that he knew, or could foresee on Saturday, that such an Entry must be made, therefore the whole was still right: That he <HI>John Hopton</HI> then observed to the Collector, that there was a Charge for Cockets, whereas none such were had or applied for, and therefore there was no Room for that Article to be charged: That the Collector then asked where is the Vessel bound to, is she not bound for <HI>Lisbon</HI>? he the said Deponent answered no, she is bound to <HI>Bristol,</HI> and therefore had no Cockets.—That the Collector then with great warmth, said it was no Matter, or he did not care for that, and added, "I again repeat, that I am entitled to the whole Sum which is set down, and if you cannot see the Propriety of my Charge, I cannot help you:" And the said <HI>John Hopton</HI> further saith, That the Collector's Answer being unsatisfactory, both to Captain <HI>Forten</HI> and himself, and being prompted thereto by a Sense of his Duty, he took the Liberty, but with all Deference to the Collector, to proceed and say unto him, I shall be glad, Sir, to have other Articles in the Account made plainer, some of which I think were ne∣ver had, nor even applied for: In Answer to which, the Collector continuing angry, said, "I have done, and will do no more in the Affair; I have no Time to lose, and will not have my Time taken up in Disputes of this Nature." Whereupon <PB N="29" REF="010748_0015_0F8174718319C320"/>
the said <HI>John Hopton,</HI> (having first paid the aforementioned odd <HI>Two shillings and Six-pence</HI> Currency, for which the Ship's Papers were detained) together with Captain <HI>Forten,</HI> retired from the Custom-House.</P>
<P>HENRY LAURENS, doth further declare, That after having heard the Re∣ception which Captain <HI>Forten</HI> had met with from the Collector, so contrary to his the Collector's Promises, when he desired that Captain <HI>Forten</HI> should wait upon him with his Papers; he the said <HI>Henry Laurens</HI> went on the Twenty-ninth of May aforesaid to the Custom-House, and then and there, in Presence of <HI>Isaac Mazyck,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and Mr. <HI>William Banbury,</HI> desired to Remonstrate to the said Collector upon the Subject above-mentioned; assuring the said Collector, that there were in his said Account certain Articles, which ought not to be charged therein; that the Collector seemed to be proceeding to examine into the said Complaint, but, on a sudden, said in some warmth, that it was a Holyday, that he was busy, and should be more so presently: Whereupon the said Deponent replied, that he thought himself aggrieved; that he did not come to ask any Favours, but applied for Redress, which he conceived he had a Right to apply for at the Collector's own House, or even in the Street, Holyday or no Holyday, and requested the Collector to inform him whether he would grant him such Redress or not: In Answer, the Collector desired him to defer the Business until next Day, and appointed Three o'Clock Saturday Afternoon for the Deponent <HI>Henry Laurens</HI> to attend him at the Custom House; at which Time and Place he promised to retrospect his said Account, in order, as the Deponent understood, to allow and return for any illegal Charges. And this Deponent, <HI>Henry Laurens,</HI> further saith, That having other Business at the Custom-House, he went there on the Morning of the said Saturday, about Eleven o'Clock, when the Collector informed him, that he had fully consi∣dered the Affair of his Fees on the Ship <HI>Anne,</HI> and was determined not to return any Part of the Sum of <HI>Fourteen Pounds,</HI> taken for clearing her out; and that therefore the Deponent need not be at the Trouble of coming at Three o'Clock, according to the former Appointment: Further the Deponent saith, That the Post-Entry before-mentioned was not foreseen, nor even expected by him when the Ship <HI>Anne</HI> was cleared out; that the Alteration in the Ship's Clearance, (called and charged upon this Occasion a Post-Entry) was on Account of twelve Barrels of Rice, taken from on board the Ship, in order to accommodate certain Passengers.</P>

<P>THIS is to Certify, to all whom it doth, shall, or may Concern, that upon the Fourteenth Day of July, One Thousand Seven Hundred and Sixty-seven, and about the Hour of Nine or Ten o'Clock in the Forenoon of the same Day, <HI>John Hapton,</HI> Clerk to <HI>Henry Laurens,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> called upon me <HI>Fenwicke Bull,</HI> Notary-Public, at my House on the Bay, and enquired of me the said Notary, whether or no I was going from Home, for that he <HI>John Hopton</HI> believed he should want me to wait upon the Honourable <HI>Daniel Moore,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Collector for the Port of Charles-Town, relative to a Schooner called the <HI>Wambaw,</HI> the Property of the said <HI>Henry Laurens,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> and that by the Desire of <HI>Gabriel Manigault, Miles Brewton,</HI> and <HI>James Laurens,</HI> Esqrs. there being some Kind of Impediment to the said Schooner <HI>Wambaw</HI> being permitted to be entered at the Custom-House: To which I the said Notary made Answer to the said <HI>John Hopton,</HI> that I would certainly be in the Way, and ready to attend as a Notary, if called upon for that Purpose. And that about Twelve Minutes before Twelve o'Clock at Noon, of the same Day, the said <HI>John Hopton,</HI> did call again upon me the said Notary, and informed me that the abovementioned Gentlemen, VIZ. <HI>Gabriel Manigault, Miles Brewton,</HI> and <HI>James

Laurens,</HI> Esqrs. were waiting for me at the Custom-House; whereupon I imme∣diately went to, and found them under the Piazza of the Custom-House, in Consultation.—I addressed and told them, that I was ready to wait on the Honourable <HI>Daniel Moore,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Collector, and require and demand any Answer or Answers that they should think proper to be obtained of and from him the said Collector: That they then replied to me,
<Q>That as the said Collector was already under several Prosecutions, that as my waiting on him as a Notary might appear like Persecution, they one and all, with great Delicacy and Tenderness, declined sending me in Form to the said Collector; also saying, that the said Collector had verbally assured <HI>Miles Brewton,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> that NO ADVANTAGE SHOULD BE TAKEN.</Q>
Upon which the said Mr. <HI>Brewton,</HI> desired that I would go Home and make a Minute of the Words which the Collector had used or promised to him upon this Occasion, which were to this Effect, VIZ.
<Q>That the Collec∣tor, <HI>Daniel Moore,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> told and informed him <HI>Miles Brewton,</HI> that <HI>William Brown,</HI> Master of the Schooner <HI>Wambaw,</HI> from the <HI>Alatamaha,</HI> and the Pro∣perty of <HI>Henry Laurens,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> had appeared at the Custom-House, and there produced, exhibited, and offered a Manifest and Certificate, rather out of the common Mode of Business; and that as the Case was new to him, and also that as he must of Course be at a loss, he the Collector begged to be indulged with the Liberty of consulting with the King's Attorney upon the Matter; and that he the Collector assured the said Mr. <HI>Brewton,</HI> that no Advantage should be taken of or against the said Schooner <HI>Wambaw,</HI> or her Cargo, in any Manner whatsoever.</Q>
Therefore, and by Reason of the above recited FAIR PROMISES from the said Collector, a Protest was not then extended.</P>

<P>BY this publick Instrument of Protest, be it Known and Manifest to all whom it doth, shall or may Concern, that upon this Sixth Day of August, One Thousand Seven Hundred and Sixty-seven, before me FENWICKE BULL, one of His Majesty's Justices assigned to keep the Peace for <HI>Berkley</HI> County, and Notary-Public, duly admitted and sworn, dwelling in Charles-Town, in the Province afore∣said, PERSONALLY appeared <HI>William Brown,</HI> Master of the Schooner <HI>Wambaw,</HI> the Property of <HI>Henry Laurens,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> who being duly sworn upon the Holy Evangelists of Almighty God, maketh Oath and declares, That he the Deponent did go to the Custom-House in Charles-Town, by Order of his Owner, the said Mr. <HI>Laurens,</HI> who told the Deponent that he would follow him there, in order to clear the Vessel <HI>Wambaw</HI>; that upon the Deponent's going there, (which was on the Twenty-ninth of May, or thereabouts) and informing the Collector that the Schooner <HI>Wambaw</HI> was bound to <HI>Alatamaha</HI>; he the Collector gave orders to his Clerk to write a Permit.—That then immediately came and appeared the said Mr. <HI>Laurens,</HI> who said that a Permit would not answer the Purpose, that his Plantation was in <HI>Georgia,</HI> and told the Collector, that he had and did pay Taxes and Quit-Rents in the Province of <HI>Georgia</HI> for the said Plantation, and desired that the Vessel <HI>Wambaw</HI> might be fully cleared, as being bound to another Colony; whereupon she was so cleared, except the giving Bond for Non-enumerated Goods; that a Bond was mentioned by the Collector, his Clerk, or his Owner <HI>Henry Laurens,</HI> (but the Deponent is not positive by which of the three Persons) that he understood a Bond was not required; that none was demanded from, or given by him or his Owner <HI>Henry Laurens.</HI> When cleared, he failed, with Orders from his said Owner, <HI>Henry Laurens,</HI> to wait at the <HI>Alatamaha</HI> until he should Arrive: That as he understood his Owner was detained by attending
<PB N="36" REF="010748_0019_0F81747537A70648"/>
upon the Commons House of Assembly, and afterwards by contrary Winds; he the Deponent in the mean Time wanting Ballast, and none being to be had in the Neighbourhood, he took a Parcel of Shingles on board, which not only ballasted, but loaded the Schooner, and then lay waiting for his Owner, <HI>Henry Laurens:</HI> In the mean Time, also apprehending that it might be necessary, having Shingles on board, to clear out; he made enquiry if there was any Custom-House or Officers in the Neighbourhood, when he was informed by several Persons that the nearest was at <HI>Sunbury,</HI> a Distance of between forty and fifty Miles; a very bad Road, and to which he was utterly a Stranger, besides Water Carriage fifteen or eighteen Miles, and against the Stream.—Immediately upon his Owner's Arrival, the Deponent was ordered to apply to the nearest Magistrates, <HI>John Polson,</HI> and <HI>Donald Mackay,</HI> Esqrs. at <HI>Frederica,</HI> to whom he entered into Bond, with one Surety, &amp;c. and obtained a Certificate from them, (Copy of which is hereunto annexed) which was the best Clearance that he could possibly obtain, and all that was in his Power to do in Compliance with the Law, and then sailed directly to and for Charles-Town. That he never received any Orders or Directions from his Owner, <HI>Henry Laurens,</HI> or any other Person, to do any Act contrary to, or elusive of any Act of Parlia∣ment; and that his Owner was very desirous of clearing the said Vessel <HI>Wambaw,</HI> in exact Conformity to Law, if it had been practicable: That he the Deponent has been Master of the said Schooner <HI>Wambaw</HI> about Twenty-one Months, and never was concerned in any illicit Trade or contraband Proceedings: That upon his Arrival at Charles-Town, he applied to Mr. <HI>John Hopton,</HI> Clerk to his Owner, the said Mr. <HI>Laurens,</HI> and went to enter the said Vessel <HI>Wambaw,</HI> at the Custom-House: That the Collector declined to enter her, notwithstanding that he produced a Certificate from <HI>Frederica,</HI> as herein before is mentioned; and after keeping him in suspence five Days, the said Schooner <HI>Wambaw</HI> was seized by <HI>George Roupell,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> as the Deponent believes, by the Collector's Orders.</P>
<P>THEREFORE I the said Notary, at the special Instance and Request of the said <HI>William Brown,</HI> as well on his Behalf as Master of said Vessel <HI>Wambaw,</HI> as on Account and for the Owner of the said Schooner, the said <HI>Laurens</HI>; do Protest against the Want of a Custom-House or Custom-House Officers at the <HI>Alata∣maba,</HI> there being none within forty Miles thereof: Also against <HI>Daniel Moore,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Collector, for omitting to take a Bond as was offered, and which tended to mislead and make the Deponent think it less essential; and also for refusing to admit his Vessel <HI>Wambaw</HI> to enter according to Law, as well as for causing the said Vessel to be seized and detained; and against the said <HI>George Roupell</HI> for seizing and detaining the same. And I do hereby Protest, and that solemnly, against the Want of Officers at the <HI>Alatamaha,</HI> against the said <HI>Daniel Moore,</HI> Collector, and also against the said <HI>George Roupell,</HI> for all Charges, Costs, and Damages, that have accrued, or that may accrue to the said <HI>William Brown,</HI> Master, and <HI>Henry Laurens,</HI> Owner, and all others concerned by Reason of the Premises.</P>

That upon his Arrival at <HI>Alatamaha,</HI> he landed his said Pro∣visions and other Goods, and by his Owner's Orders there refused to take on board any Kind of Goods, Wares, or Merchandizes, some such having been offered to him for Sale or Freight; and that he heard his Owner say he would not take any Goods, as the Schooner was a large Vessel, and that there might be Trouble and Difficulty attending for proper Clearances: That there being neither Stone nor Sand Ballast within Eighteen Miles of the Place where his Vessel did lay; and as his Vessel would be endangered in going so far light, be the Deponent took on board the said Schooner <HI>Broughton-Island Packet,</HI> a sufficient Quantity of rough Wood, cut in a Swamp, in lieu of Ballast: That he heard his Owner, Colonel <HI>Henry Laurens,</HI> often express his Wishes to clear out the Vessel properly, but that it was impossible; and that considering the Nature of his Manifest at Charles-Town, and the plain Declaration of his Owner to the Collector there, that the Vessel was bound to a Place where there was no Port of Entry nor Custom-House Officers, and having transacted all the before-mentioned and particular Matters in presence of Mr. <HI>Edward Head,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Isaac Peace,</HI> British Merchants, residing commonly in Charles-Town, but then the Deponent's Passengers, (who were no Way interested in the said Schooner) he considered his Return to Charles-Town in BALLAST ONLY, as a Continuation and Completion of his Voyage; and therefore did Return without Deviation or Fraud, and upon his Arrival he went to the Custom-House at Charles-Town, and produced and presented to the Collector a Manifest, of which the under-written is a Copy, and prayed to be admitted to enter.</P>

<P>AND having heard all Parties, by their Proctors and Advocates, relative to the Legality of the Seizure in this Case; I am of Opinion, upon a View of the several Acts of Trade respecting this Point, and particularly the 7th and 8th William III, Chapter 22d, Section 20th, and the Statutes made in the 3d, 4th, 5th and 6th Years of his present Majesty's Reign, that nothing, in these several Acts can be construed to lay any unnecessary Restraint upon the Trade and Correspondence of his Majesty's American Subjects, when any Goods or Commodities are carried merely for the Use and Suste∣nance of the said Colonies; or, in other Words, when such Goods are carried only from one Port or Place to another Port or Place in the same Colony. And forasmuch as it does appear manifest to me, from the se∣veral Proofs in this Cause, that the Vessel in Question has been constantly employed within the said Province, without putting further out to Sea than her Burthen, or the Coast made necessary for the Safety of her Navi∣gation to and from this Port; and there is not the least Shadow of Pretence, that the said Vessel has at any Time been employed in any illicit Trade whatsoever, or that any Fraud has been committed or intended, whereby his Majesty's Revenue can be diminished or affected, or the fair Trader undermined or prejudiced, contrary to any of the wise Provisions of any Revenue-Laws, or Laws of the Customs. I DO THERE∣FORE, under the particular Circumstances of this Case, ADJUDGE, ORDER, SENTENCE AND DECREE, That the said Vessel and Cargo are not liable, and ought not to be condemned and confiscated.</P>
