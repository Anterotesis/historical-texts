<P>ON Thursday last <HI>Rebekah Chamblit</HI> was Executed here, ac∣cording to a Sentence pass'd upon her at the Superiour Court holden here for the County of <HI>Suffolk</HI> in <HI>August</HI> last, being then found Guilty of <HI>Felony,</HI> in concealing the Birth of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> spurious Infant, which she was deliver'd of when alone, and was afterwards found dead; which Fact is a plain violation of a good and wholsome Law of this Province: Which Law is here inserted, for further spreading the Knowledge of it, and to prevent Lives being lost thro' Ignorance thereof.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE YOUNG READERS.</HEAD>
<P>YOU have now in your Hands a very serious and pa∣thetical SERMON, preach'd on a solemn &amp; awful Occasion, which it is wish'd and hop'd may, by the Efficacy of the Spirit of Grace, prove a means of Awakening, of Restraint, and of Conversion to many of you.</P>
<P>It is to be taken Notice of, That of the many Malefactors which have suffer'd Death among us within the Space of <HI>Six∣teen Years</HI> past, not above one of them was born in this Country. But now our GOD has humbled us by leaving a Child of the <HI>Town,</HI> one under the sacred <HI>Bonds of the Covenant,</HI> to those Ini∣quities, more especially the repeated Crimes of <HI>Unchastity,</HI> which have ripen'd her for the Vengeance of a Capital Execution; in which God has <HI>set</HI> her <HI>forth for an Example</HI> to the Children of <HI>New-England,</HI> to warn them not to Sin away their Convictions and Awakenings, and by rebelling against His Holy Spirit, provoke Him to take off His Restraints, and so leave them to those Courses that shall undo and destroy them.</P>
<P>It may be there is no Place in the World, where such Pains are taken with condemn'd Criminals to prepare them for their Death; that <HI>in the Destruction of the Flesh, the Spirit may be saved in the Day of the Lord Jesus.</HI> The compassionate <HI>Judges</HI> always allow a considerable Time (commonly a <HI>Month</HI> at least) after the Sentence is pronounc'd, before the Execution is proceeded in. All this while they are visited, it may be every Day, by some or other of the <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Town, to instruct them, direct them, and pray with them. They have also the Liberty to attend in our publick Assemblies, on <HI>Lecture-Days</HI> and on <HI>Lord's Days,</HI> that they may have the Benefit of those Ordinances which CHRIST has appointed, and by the Working of His Spirit makes to be the effectual Means of the Conversion and Salvation of Sinners; when both the <HI>Prayers</HI> and <HI>Sermons</HI> are adapted to their particular Case &amp; Circumstances, while it is at the same time endeavour'd to improve the Providence for the Benefit of the numerous Concourse of People, especially of the <HI>Younger Sort,</HI> which usually appear on such an Occasion</P>
<P>It was on the <HI>last Sabbath</HI> of her Life, that this poor <HI>Dau'ter of Death,</HI> and the great Assembly present, were entertain'd with
<PB N="ii" REF="003655_0004_10023E3AA1638410"/>
the following Discourse, on a Subject very sutably chosen, stu∣diously calculated, not to gratify an itching Ear, but to reach the Heart and awaken the Conscience; and therefore drawn up very much in Scripture Language, which carries a peculiar Force and Pungency with it; and is now publish'd with ad∣vantagious Enlargements in some Parts of the Application. The poor Creature her self afterwards spake of it, and of the publishing it, in such a Manner as gives some Reason to hope, it came <HI>with Power</HI> upon her Soul.</P>
<P>To this is added the Conference had with her in the Way to her Execution, by our <HI>worthy Brother</HI> who to gratify her own De∣sire attended her thither; and has now recollected the Substance of what occur'd in that Conversation, to gratify some of his Friends who requested it of him; by which it appears the last, &amp; there∣fore most precious Minutes of her Life, were improv'd to the best Advantage. Her Answers indeed were but short; as she never us'd to say much when we discoursed with her. But the Questions were the most proper &amp; sutable that could be, leading her, by a study'd &amp; regular, yet easy &amp; familiar Train of Tho't, into those grand Points, in which <HI>is the Life of our Spirit.</HI> Many will be pleas'd, and I hope profited, to see them. The Reader may place himself in the View of Death, and then put them to his own Soul, till he feels the Impression of them.</P>
<P>It appear'd to me one of the best Symptoms upon this poor Crimi∣nal, that she seem'd desirous her Example might be a Warning to others. She did therefore, of her own Accord, desire some of the Ministers, solemnly to caution Young People, not to have <HI>their Life,</HI> as hers had been, <HI>among the Unclean.</HI> So that in this Publication we do but come to you with a Message from the dead; Or, She her self does, as it were, come from the dead to warn you: tho', if you <HI>hear not Moses and the Prophets,</HI> Christ and his Apostles, and his ordinary Ministers, <HI>neither would you be perswad∣ed tho' one should</HI> indeed <HI>come from the dead</HI> and speak unto you. However <HI>that</HI> might terrifie you, it of it self would not, could no convert you, unless the Holy Spirit set in with His Almigh∣ty Influences, which are most likely to be afforded in the Use of those Means which are of his own Appointment.</P>
<P>How fit a Word is this, which GOD has directed his Ser∣vant to, wherewith to address the Young Sinner, the vain and lewd Youth? If this will not awaken your Fears, to hear of the <HI>Wrath of Almighty GOD</HI> which is incens'd against you, and of that <HI>Stroke</HI> of his powerful Vengeance to which you are every Moment expos'd, and which, when it is once given, will send you into that <HI>Place of Misery,</HI> from which there is <HI>no Redemp∣tion,</HI>
<PB N="iii" REF="003655_0005_10023E6574838310"/>
no, not thro'out the endless Ages of Eternity; if this, I say, will not alarm your Fears, and awaken in you a most sol∣licitous Concern how to escape the dreadful Danger you are in, and provide for the safety of your never-dying Soul, what will? If you can read such a Sermon as <HI>this,</HI> and still conti∣nue fearless and careless, and indulge your self in criminal Courses, in those Impurities which <HI>the Holy One of Israel</HI> cannot look upon without the utmost Abhorrence; may it not justly be fear'd, that God has in a judicial way, <HI>pour'd out upon you the Spirit of deep Sleep,</HI> and given you up to your own Hearts Lusts till by filling up the measure of your Sin, you become prepared for that amazing Stroke, in which these awful Words will be again fulfill'd, and which will make you a Warning to others, as others have been to you?</P>
<P>I know there is in your Hearts a cursed Principle of Infidelity, that will suggest to you, <HI>"I shall have Peace, tho' I walk in the Imagination of my Heart, and add Iniquity to Iniquity."</HI> You may be ready to think your selves as secure of your Lives, as if you had made a Bargain with Death, not to come till you send for him; not to <HI>take you away with a Stroke,</HI> but to let you stand till old Age gradually consumes you. So there were some of old who lull'd themselves asleep in carnal Security, say∣ing, <HI>"We have made a Covenant with Death, and with Hell we are at Agreement; when the overflowing Scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us."</HI> But they had this Answer from the Lord God, <HI>"Your Covenant with Death shall be disannulled, and your Agreement with Hell shalt not stand; when the overflowing Scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be troden down by it."</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isai. 28. 15, 18.</NOTE> Don't then <HI>make Lies your Refuge,</HI> or seek to <HI>cover your selves in hiding Places of Deceit.</HI> Has not the Justice of God, made quick Work with other Sinners? When they have cried, <HI>Peace, Peace; sudden Destruction has overtaken them.</HI> You see here, It was an Observation in the Days of <HI>Elihu, "They die in Youth,</HI> whose <HI>Lives are among the Unclean".</HI> And has not the Observation been verified all along, from that Day to this? For the <HI>Scrip∣ture</HI> is continually fulfilling in <HI>Providence.</HI></P>
<P>I could my self tell you of a <HI>Youth</HI> whom I knew that was once of very Promising Hopes, but as he grew to Manhood sadly disappointed the Expectations of those who before that <HI>beholding him loved him.</HI> Being ask'd by a religious Friend who was griev'd to see such an Alteration in him, "How he had laid out his Life, and intended to spend it"? He answer'd to this Purpose, "In <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sting the Pleasures of it as much as he could" Upon
<PB N="iv" REF="003655_0006_10023DC641F524F8"/>
which being seasonably put in Mind, That the Time of his Life might be shorter than he was aware of; He made this Reply. "That he doubted not but he shou'd see <HI>fourscore Years</HI> at least." But within that Number of <HI>Days,</HI> he was taken away with the stroke of a sudden &amp; immature Death, in such a Way as made the <HI>Ears of all that heard it to tingle.</HI> Behold now the Severity and goodness of God! Towards them who have been taken away by His Stroke, <HI>Righteous Severity;</HI> but towards thee, who art still spared and warned, <HI>Goodness,</HI> if thou dost not continue to despise and abuse it.</P>
<P>I have two Things to request of you before you read this Ser∣mon, and then I'll no longer detain you. The one is, That you would <HI>pray over it</HI> before you read it; that God would accompany the Reading of it with the Effectual Operation of his Spirit, with∣out which the most Powerful Words Man can use, will be but as <HI>a dead Letter,</HI> altogether ineffectual to Convert &amp; Sanctify you.</P>
<P>The other is, That after you have read it, You would allow your self Time to <HI>think on what you have read,</HI> and enter into a solemn Debate with your own Soul thereupon. Seriously ask your self then, "Whether you can think it safe to continue in your sinful Courses one Day longer?" "Whether it is not the Madness of Folly in you, to loose your Soul, your precious and immortal Soul, rather than part with a base Lust"? "Whether you had not better forego the Company of Sinners now, than have your Soul gather'd with them hereafter"? If any of you should still say, <HI>"I have loved Strangers, and after them I will go".</HI> "I must indulge my Lusts and enjoy my sinful Companions, tho' I forfeit the Favour of God, and expose my self to his Vengeance for ever". Then, Know it, You wilfully damn your own Soul: You <HI>chuse Death</HI> in the Causes of it. Your <HI>Part</HI> must be with <HI>the Unbelieving, and the Abominable, in the Lake that burns with Fire and Brimstone, which is the second Death.</HI> You <HI>shall go</HI> when you die, and that will be very soon, <HI>to the Generation of your Fathers,</HI> the unclean Sinners that have died before you, and are shut up in the Prison of Darkness; You <HI>shall never see Light: So shall thy Doom be, Thou thy self hast decided it.</HI></P>
<P>But that God may bless this Discourse to every <HI>one</HI> of you that shall read it, to preserve the <HI>Virtuous</HI> Youth, reclaim the <HI>Vicious,</HI> and establish the <HI>Pious;</HI> and so make the Preaching and Pub∣lishing it serve to heighten the Author's Joy, and brighten his Crown in the Day of CHRIST, is the hearty Prayer of</P>

<HEAD>A Lesson of Caution TO YOUNG SINNERS.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>JOB XXXVI. 14, and 18.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>They die in Youth, and their Life is among the Unclean. Because there is Wrath, beware lest He take thee away with his Stroke: then a great Ransom cannot de∣liver thee.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Text is very awful and affecting; deserves the serious Tho'ts of all, but especially challenges a more intense Consideration from our Young People. He that hath an Ear to hear, let him hear. Let these sayings sink down into your Ears, and be written on your Hearts. By discoursing on the Text, may I be so happy, by the Blessing of GOD, as to prevent the fulfilling of it among our Young People! Of whom I see so numerous a Concourse on the present solemn Occasion.</P>
<P>They are the words of <HI>Elihu,</HI> who having un∣dertaken to speak on God's behalf, in Vindica∣tion of his dealings with <HI>Job,</HI> first gives him (as in the preceeding Context) a brief account of
<PB N="2" REF="003655_0008_10023E0B069A2F80"/>
the various methods of Providence towards the Children of Men, suted to their different Tempers and Carriages towards God; and then gives him agreable Counsels and Admonitions thereupon. <HI>Elihu</HI> observes to him the design of God in bring∣ing Men under the Bonds of Affliction; that it is with a view to their spiritual Benefit, for the good of their Souls, <HI>ver.</HI> 8, 9, 10.—In the next place he observes the different Issue of a right Improve∣ment of Divine Corrections, and of Impenitence under the Hand of God, <HI>ver.</HI> 11, 12. He fur∣ther amplifies on the Case of impenitent Sinners, in the two next Verses, <HI>ver.</HI> 13, 14.</P>
<P>And then, after having made some particular Remarks on <HI>Job'</HI>s case, he proceeds to give him that solemn Caution, in the 18<HI>th. verse,</HI> not to make light of God's Wrath, but to fear lest he should fall a Sacrifice to the Divine Vengeance. Even good Men have enough amiss in 'em, to expose them to God's Wrath, if He should enter into Judgment with them. It was therefore a proper and seaso∣nable Caution: and if so holy and good a Man, as <HI>Job,</HI> needed such a Caution, surely impenitent Sinners much more have need of this solemn Warning. It is a Word more especially fit to ad∣dress secure Sinners withal: tho' 'tis also applicable to all others, good as well as bad; young and old.</P>
<P>'Tis the proper Use and Application of the Hint given in the 14<HI>th</HI> verse, concerning the miserable End of Impenitents: and therefore I've connect∣ed these two Verses, for the Subject of my present Discourse. <HI>They die in Youth, and their Life is a∣mong the Unclean: Because there is Wrath, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I shall speak to the Words under these Three distinct Heads.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="3" REF="003655_0009_10023E67D16EEFB8"/>
1. Mankind are sometimes taken out of the World by an <HI>early Death,</HI> even in the days of their <HI>Youth.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Of those, who die in Youth, many there be, <HI>whose Life is among the Unclean.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. These Reflections should <HI>awaken</HI> all, and particularly young People, to a <HI>Fear</HI> and <HI>Concern,</HI> lest God in his Wrath should <HI>take them away with a stroke,</HI> leaving them no Hope of Relief.</P>
<P>DOCT. I. <HI>Mankind are often taken out of the World by an</HI> Early <HI>and</HI> untimely <HI>Death.</HI>—It's the Case of many, <HI>They die in Youth,</HI> a premature Death.</P>
<P>I am aware, That some take <HI>Youth</HI> here in a figurative sense, and understand the Text to mean, They die in <HI>Ignorance</HI> and <HI>Folly.</HI> For he that has not yet learn'd to live as he ought, seems to die prematurely: and he that dies prematurely, seems to die as an Infant, that can't discern its right hand and its left. The old Man, that is a late Penitent, dies a very <HI>Child:</HI> and the Impenitent, though he may have been an hundred Years in the World, yet he has not truly <HI>lived</HI> so much as one day, if he at last dies in his Sins.</P>
<P>But others take the Word in a proper sense, as intending the Age of Youth, the Morning of Life. Nor see I any Occasion to depart from the literal Construction.</P>
<P>It is an obvious Truth, that Multitudes are taken out of the World by an early Death. There are Multitudes, who perish in the Womb, and never see the Light: Multitudes that die in Infancy; having breath'd a few days or months, they ex∣pire and vanish: Multitudes, that die in Child∣hood and Youth. Many are taken away in the
<PB N="4" REF="003655_0010_10023E1DD7D79B70"/>
midst of their Days; and many attain not to this; they scarce live out half their Days.</P>
<P>The longest Liver in these times may be said to die in Youth, if compared with those in the first Ages of the World. Many in primitive times attain'd to nigh a Thousand Years. But there has since been a wonderful Abbreviation of the Life of Man;—of which no Philosophical Ac∣count has yet been given, to the satisfaction of rational Inquirers: but we are oblig'd to content ourselves with Theological Reasons, and must re∣solve this mysterious Event into the sovereign Pleasure and Providence of God.—From <HI>Moses'</HI>s time the extent of human Life in general has been but about Seventy or Eighty Years. <HI>Psal.</HI> 90. 10. This is the common Boundary, which few exceed, and Multitudes fall short of.</P>
<P>Vast Numbers (as I said) are taken away in the midst of their Days, and yet more in the Be∣ginning of their Years. The Dispensation of early Death is common both to the Just and Unjust.</P>
<P>The early Death of the <HI>Righteous</HI> is a <HI>mysterious</HI> Dispensation, of which scarce any other Account can be given but that, <HI>Even so, Father, because it hath seemed good in thy sight!</HI>—However, many Things might be said to justify the Providence of God herein; and particularly this, that altho' God shortens the days of such in this World, yet he gives them length of Days and Life everlasting in a better: So that the Curse is turn'd into a Blessing, as to them. Untimely Death is in itself evil, and a fruit of the Curse: but to one in Christ, it becomes a surprising Mercy; for it turns to his Salvation, and hastens his eternal Happiness and Glory.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="003655_0011_10023DC93A0E26F0"/>
But to the Wicked this Dispensation is in <HI>Judg∣ment.</HI> Shortness of Days is often threaten'd in Scripture, as a Punishment of Sin. Prov. 10. 27. <HI>The Years of the Wicked shall be shortned.</HI> So Eccl. 8. 13. <HI>It shall not be well with the Wicked; neither shall he prolong his Days, which are as a shadow, be∣cause he feareth not before God.</HI>—And Psal. 55. 23. <HI>Thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the Pit of De∣struction: bloody and deceitful Men shall not live out half their Days,</HI> i. e. not half the ordinary Age of Man, not half so long as they might live in the usual Course of Nature.</P>
<P>But whether they be righteous or wicked, whe∣ther it be in Mercy or in Judgment, we often see very affecting Instances of early Death. How many are in their Youth cut off by pining Sickness How many by fatal Casualties! When God com∣missions Death to arrest any, he regards not the Beauty or the Vigour of Youth: that cannot bribe, nor this resist him. When the Death-Warrant is sign'd, the King of Terrors becomes inexorable, and spares not the ruddy Youth, any more than the hoary Head. He minds not Age or Quality, Sex or Rank: but every one, when his Hour is come, falls by the impartial Hand of this common Devourer. By the Greatness of his strength shall none prevail: nor will the pitiable Tenderness of any obtain a Reprieve for them. The Children and Sucklings he makes to pour out their Soul into their Mother's Bosom: He crushes the Young Men with a Rod of Iron, and treads the Daugh∣ters of Zion, as in a Wine-press. In how many Instances do we see that fulfilled, Job 21. 23, 24. <HI>One dieth in his full strength being wholly at ease and quiet, his Breasts full of Milk, and his Bones moist∣ned
<PB N="6" REF="003655_0012_10023E5837D7DA48"/>
with Marrow.</HI>—Them that bid fairest for long Life, how often do we see cut off by the stroke of Death: Some in the way of Nature, by a fatal Distemper; others in the way of Violence, by a sudden Accident, by the Hand of Malice, or the Sword of Justice.</P>
<P>Herein is the <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of God display'd: and his <HI>Righteousness</HI> is herein exalted. For every Death is an Execution of the primitive Curse, and an Exercise of the Divine Dominion over the Life of Man: and in particular early Death is eminently so. There is also the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of God to be seen in his ordering Death unto Mankind in all Periods and Ages of Life; inasmuch as their being at an Uncertainty about the Time of their dying, and not knowing but that they may die in Youth, tends to excite in 'em a Care of early Preparation for Death.</P>
<P>In a word, while we behold the severity of God to some in cutting them off by an untimely Death, We that survive should be more deeply affected with a sense of the distinguishing goodness of God to us, in preserving us hitherto; especially since we have forfeited our Lives by innumerable Pro∣vocations. We have been expos'd to the same Perils, as others; we are by Nature Children of Wrath, even as others; our Childhood and Youth has been Vanity, full of Sin and Folly, even more perhaps than many others were guilty of, that have been taken away before us.—And shall not these Considerations strike our Hearts; fill us with Ad∣miration of the Divine Patience towards us, and lead us to Repentance! O let us devote our re∣prieved Lives to the Honour of God; by whose Visitation out Spirits have been preserved. Let
<PB N="7" REF="003655_0013_10023E6A43992480"/>
him have the Service of our adult and advanced Age, to whose Mercy it's owing that we did not die in Youth or Infancy. Let that be the Tho't of our Heart, our Resolution and our Petition con∣tinually, Psal. 56. 12, 13. <HI>Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee. For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thou de∣liver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God is the light of the living!</HI></P>
<P>But I pass now to another Observation,</P>
<P>DOCT. II. Of those that die in Youth, many there be, <HI>whose Life is amongst the Unclean.</HI></P>
<P>There are different Constructions of this Passage: Some refer it to the present Life, and others to that which is to come.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) We may take it as respecting the <HI>present Life.</HI> The Word [<HI>is</HI>] not being in the Hebrew Text, our Translators have supply'd the Vacancy with that; as perhaps understanding <HI>Elihu</HI> to speak here of the Life future. But if it be understood of the Life, which now is, there may other Sup∣pletives be made use of; and accordingly, various Glosses may be made on the Words</P>
<P N="1">1. Thus, it may be read, <HI>Their Life</HI> is seen to have been <HI>among the Unclean.</HI> However they may have hid their Wickedness heretofore; yet now, when they come to die, they are detect∣ed, or confess; the Mask is pull'd or thrown off, and it appears they were but whited Se∣pulchres, fair without, but foul within. Now the Mouths of Men are open'd to speak what they know of their wicked Lives; the Providence of God strangely brings to Light their hidden Iniquities; or Conscience compels them to a Con∣fession.
<PB N="8" REF="003655_0014_10023DCC52354910"/>
The Hypocrite's Hope perishes in Death, and many times vanisheth at the Apprehension of Death approaching; so that the false Professor, tho' perhaps he formerly appear'd to have a sa∣cred Heat of Love and Grace in his Soul, yet now confesses himself to have been under the power of a fatal Cold in divine Things, &amp; to have possess'd no other Heat than that of fleshly Lusts, which war against the Soul: and he now numbers him∣self among the Unclean, calls himself a spiritual Adulterer, who made Pretensions of Love to Christ, as the Guide of his Youth, but yet only flatter'd him with his Mouth, while in Reality his Heart went a whoring after the World, led away with divers Lusts.</P>
<P N="2">2. Again, the Text may be read, <HI>Their Life</HI> is found <HI>among the Unclean,</HI> that is, they are found <HI>living in Uncleanness,</HI> when Death comes and takes them away. In a State of Sin, and it may be in the Act of Sin, Death surprizes 'em, and drives them away in their Wickedness. I might instance in wicked <HI>Er</HI> and <HI>Onan,</HI> those Brethren in Iniquity, whom the Lord slew for their abo∣minable Filthiness, that they died before their Time. So <HI>Nadab</HI> and <HI>Abihu,</HI> who profaned the Worship of God, there went out Fire from the Lord and devoured them, and they died before the Lord. So <HI>Korah</HI> and his Company, Wicked∣ness was amongst them &amp; in their Dwellings, and the Earth open'd her Mouth, and swallow'd them up, and they went down alive into the Pit.—Many are thus cut off by the more immediate hand of God. Others have been slain in Battel, or been cut off by the Sword of the civil Magistrate, who is a Revenger to execute Wrath upon them that

<P N="3">3. Again, The Text may be read, <HI>Their Life</HI> is taken away <HI>among the Unclean,</HI> i. e. in <HI>Company</HI> with them, or by a Death ignominious as theirs. They are in their Death <HI>number'd among the Transgressors:</HI> Cut off for their Sins, by a shameful Execution, as Criminals. They are cut off <HI>after the manner</HI> of unclean Persons, by an infamous Death. The original Word in our Text, for <HI>the Unclean,</HI> is in other places frequently render'd <HI>Sodomites:</HI> and some read it, Their Life <HI>is cut off after the same Manner as Sodomites</HI> are cut off, that are most hate∣fully unclean, abominably wicked, i. e. by a vile and shameful Death. As if it had been said, They die in Youth, and come to an ignominious End.</P>
<P N="4">4. Finally, If we read it thus, <HI>Their Life</HI> is taken away <HI>among the Unclean,</HI> it may intend, they die <HI>like</HI> the worst of Sinners, as to their <HI>Frame</HI> and <HI>Carriage.</HI> The Hypocrites in heart, of whom <HI>Elihu</HI> had been speaking, often make as poor a figure in the Approaches of Death, as the openly Profane: they behave no better than the most foul and scandalous Sinners; either dying under the power of brutish Stupidity, or else in hellish Despair. <HI>Balaam'</HI>s Wish was wont to be theirs, That they might die the <HI>Death of the Righteous:</HI> but alas! how often do we see, that the Hypocrite
<PB N="10" REF="003655_0016_100202625D1DF6D8"/>
dieth <HI>as the Fool dieth,</HI> either in sottish Security, or in miserable Anguish and desponding Rage?</P>
<P>Having thus consider'd the Words in various Lights, as they are understood to refer unto the present Life; I come now</P>
<P N="2">(2) To give you another Gloss upon the Text, which refers the Life here spoken of unto the <HI>future State.</HI> And I find some of the most judi∣cious Expositors understanding it in this Sense: <HI>Their Life is among the Unclean,</HI> i. e. their <HI>future</HI> Life is so: the Life of their Souls in the separate State is, and the Life of their Bodies in the Re∣surrection-State shall be, among the Unclean; among <HI>Sodomites,</HI> in the <HI>everlasting Fire</HI> The fil∣thy Sinners of <HI>Sodom</HI> who gave themselves over to Fornication, and went after strange Flesh, are said (<HI>Jude</HI> 7<HI>th</HI>) to be <HI>set forth for an Example, suffering the Vengeance of eternal Fire.</HI></P>
<P>The vain and lewd Youth, that dies in his Sins, yea the most moral and virtuous Youth, that dies out of Christ, unpardon'd and unrenew'd in the Spirit of his mind, must have his Portion with the unclean Spirits in Hell. <HI>When he giveth up the Ghost, where is he?</HI> Whither does he go? Not to Paradise, but to a Prison. We read of the <HI>Spirits in Prison,</HI> 1 Pet. 3. 19. It means damned Souls in Hell.—Heaven is a holy Place; and <HI>there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, nei∣ther whatsoever worketh Abomination, or maketh a Lie,</HI> Rev. 21. 27. Hell is the only fit Receptacle of impure Souls: thither, when such depart from the Body, they go, as to <HI>their own place,</HI> their proper Centre. <HI>Act.</HI> 1. 25. Now among them that die <HI>in Youth,</HI> as well as in other Ages of Life there are many that die in their Sins, and their Life

afterwards is among the Unclean. They lie down in Sorrow; and in Hell they lift up their Eyes, being in Torments.—There they bear the Re∣proach of their Youth. God in Anger now writes bitter Things indeed against them, &amp; makes them to possess the Iniquities of their Youth: these, which once were as sweet Morsels in their Mouth, are as the Gall of Asps to them now. Bitter, bit∣ter are their Reflections on lost Time, on the Mis∣spence of Youth, the golden Opportunity of Life, and the <HI>only</HI> Opportunity (as it prov'd) to them. Conscience now lashes terribly, and reads the most doleful Lessons to them. They see an amazing ETERNITY before 'em, &amp; have a certain fear∣ful looking for of Judgment and fiery Indignation to devour them for ever and ever. They were <HI>cut down out of Time</HI> (as the Phrase is <HI>Job.</HI> 22. 16) their Life was <HI>soon cut off,</HI> and their Souls flew a∣way: But alas! the days that were wanting on Earth, are made up in Hell. He that dies in Youth, with his Sins unpardon'd and unrepented of, enters immediately upon a never-expiring State of Woe &amp; Misery, Sorrow &amp; Despair. His short Life of Sin here is follow'd with a long (long) Eternity of Sufferings &amp; Torment. And in <HI>pro∣portion</HI> to their Guilt, is the future Punishment of Sinners greater or less. They that have perished from under the <HI>Gospel,</HI> shall have a more intolera∣ble Damnation, than even the Sinners of <HI>Sodom</HI> and the heathen World. And such under the Gospel as have contracted the greatest Degrees of Guilt, shall have the most aggravated Punishment. They that carry out of the World with them most of the Temper &amp; Complexion of Hell, shall have the greatest share of the Pains &amp; Torments of Hell.

The Sentence passed on the Scarlet Whore, the Mother of Harlots, will be the Language of the great Day, in regard to some Sinners, Rev. 18. 5, 6, 7 <HI>Her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembred her iniquities. Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double, accord∣ing to her works: in the cup which she hath filled, fill to her double. How much she hath glorified her self, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sor∣row give her.</HI></P>
<P>O let us all realise it, that when ever we shall die, whether in Youth or Age, if we be found in our <HI>Sins,</HI> if we go out of the World unpardoned &amp; im∣penitent, our Life in the future State must be <HI>a∣mong the Unclean,</HI> among filthy and abhorred Spirits, in a State of Punishment to everlasting. Devils and Unclean Spirits only will be fit Com∣panions for us: Hell only will be a fit Habitation for us:—And the most horrid Abodes there will be assign'd unto <HI>us,</HI> as being the Chief of Sinners.</P>
<P>And now being warned, shall we not be moved with Fear, and be in Concern of Soul that this may not be our miserable Lot, when we die, to have our Life among the Unclean! O let us be perswaded by the Terrors of the Lord, and hasten our Flight from impending Vengeance.—But to excite and direct your Care and Endeavour, in this Regard, will be my Business under the last Ob∣servation; which therefore I now come to.—</P>
<P>DOCT. III. <HI>These Reflections</HI> should awaken all, and in particular <HI>Young</HI> People, to a just <HI>Fear</HI> and <HI>Care,</HI> left GOD in Wrath should <HI>take them a∣way with his Stroke,</HI> beyond hope of Relief.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="003655_0019_10020260C22122B0"/>
<HI>They die in Youth, and their Life is among the Unclean: Because there is Wrath, beware lest he take thee away</HI> &amp;c. q. d. Because you see the Wrath of God signalized in terrible Judgments on <HI>others,</HI> cutting them down by Death, and sending them into the Pit; and because you have reason to ap∣prehend the Wrath of God kindled against you, by his present afflictive Dispensations: O beware, lest he proceed to cut <HI>you</HI> down also by an awful Death, and so you appear to die &amp; perish, even as the vilest Sinner by the hand of Vengeance.—Or it may mean, Because there is <HI>a Wrath to come,</HI> Treasures of Wrath reserv'd in Hell for impeni∣tent Sinners; Beware that you be not found in this unhappy Number, and so when you die, your Lot be among the Unclean.</P>
<P>Beware lest God in Wrath cut you off <HI>with his Stroke,</HI> in a Day that you look not for it, in an Hour that you are not aware of. Don't be cry∣ing Peace &amp; Safety to your self, lest sudden De∣struction come upon you, as Travail upon a Wo∣man with Child, and there be no Escaping. Boast not thy self of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a Day may bring forth.</P>
<P>And as a further Motive of Fear, consider, if God should cut you off with his Stroke, there will be no Hope of Relief; <HI>Then a great Ransom can∣not deliver thee:</HI> which may refer, either to a Re∣covery from the Grave, or a Redemption from Hell. When Men are <HI>once dead,</HI> there's no re∣turning into this Life and World: Do with Might therefore what your Hand findeth to do, lest Death surprize you in an unprepared State, and that Night come upon you unawares, in which no Man can work.—And when Sinners have once
<PB N="14" REF="003655_0020_10023E6BD39CC080"/>
shot the Gulph and are shut up in <HI>Hell,</HI> there's no Escaping, no Discharge for ever. <HI>O what shall a Man give in Exchange for his Soul?</HI> Had you the whole World at your Command, it would not be a sufficient Price for the Ransom of your Soul. Neither will all your Tears, Cries and Promises avail any thing: Divine Justice will be inexora∣ble to you. Neither will you have any Advocate to plead for you: He who is the only prevailing Advocate with the Father, will then be turned a∣gainst you; His Blood, which now speaks better Things than the Blood of <HI>Abel,</HI> will then plead a∣gainst you, and loudly imprecate divine Vengeance upon you to all Eternity.</P>
<P><HI>Now is the accepted Time; Now is the Day of Salvation:</HI> O see that you refuse it not. <HI>How will you escape, if you neglect so great Salva∣tion!</HI>—Tremble, lest God should cut you off with his Stroke, while you are delaying to ac∣cept this Salvation. <HI>Then a great Ransom cannot deliver you:</HI> Even the great and the only valuable Ransom, that which Christ paid down for the Re∣demption of Souls, will then be of no Benefit to you: for its saving Virtue is applicable only in this World; it reaches not to the Prison of Hell. Not that it is not in it self sufficient; for it has an infinite intrinsecal Value and Vertue: but in the Application 'tis limited by the Wisdom and Sovereignty of God, who has made this transient Life the Season of Probation for a future ever∣lasting State.</P>
<P>Surely then it is a matter of infinite Concern∣ment to us, that we now use the utmost Care to secure to our selves eternal Salvation, and make sure of being deliver'd from the Wrath to come.
<PB N="15" REF="003655_0021_10023E3CC66DE790"/>
We should work out our Salvation with Fear and Trembling. It may well be our fear, lest a Promise being left us of entring into Rest, we should after all come short of it.</P>
<P>I might say here,—We should beware of <HI>car∣nal Security</HI> and Presumption, and of every Thing that tends to nourish a careless Temper or false Hopes, which will hinder us in preparing for the future State.</P>
<P>We should beware of <HI>criminal Courses,</HI> and Ways of Sin and Wickedness, which tend to kin∣dle the Anger of God against us, and provoke him to bring everlasting Destruction upon us.</P>
<P>We should beware of <HI>Hypocrisy</HI> in Religion; which will make us a Loathing to the holy Heart-searching God, and provoke him to spue us out of his Mouth with Indignation.</P>
<P>In a Word, Whatever we do, we must be care∣ful to secure an Interest in Christ, who only saves from the Wrath to come; and therefore beware of <HI>an evil Heart of Unbelief.</HI> By reason of Sin, we are by nature Children of Wrath: and if ever we be reconciled to God, his Wrath must be ap∣peased toward us, by an Application of the Blood of Christ, which cleanseth from all Unrighteous∣ness: and this Application is thro' Faith. Hence then we must make it our Care to get and exer∣cise Faith in Christ. We must beware, that we don't miss of Life thro' Unbelief; beware that we don't deceive our selves with a dead Faith; beware of carnal Prejudices against Christ, and the way of Salvation by him. We must realise our Need of a Saviour, and the infinite Sufficiency and gracious Willingness of Christ to be our Sa∣viour: We must submit to and entertain him in
<PB N="16" REF="003655_0022_10023DEE5B522400"/>
all his Offices; Commit our Souls into his redeem∣ing Hands, to be cloath'd with his Righteousness, and adorn'd with his Image, to be washed, justi∣fy'd and sanctify'd, and sav'd for ever. So shall we find Christ a Refuge for us in the day of Death, a Security from the Wrath to come. For whoso∣ever believeth in the Son, hath everlasting Life: Whereas he that believeth not, <HI>shall not see Life, but the Wrath of God abideth on him,</HI> Joh. 3. 36.</P>
<P>I come now to the APPLICATION.</P>
<P>And here,</P>
<P>USE I. Is it so, that many <HI>die in Youth,</HI> whose Life is among the Unclean? O with what Astonishment should <HI>old Sinners</HI> reflect on the <HI>sparing</HI> Goodness of God <HI>to them:</HI> and what need have they to <HI>hasten</HI> their Repentance and Turn∣ing to God!</P>
<P>Are there not some of you, who may be right∣ly called (in respect of corrupt Practice, as well as a vitiated Nature) Transgressors from the Womb! Who have a Childhood and Youth to look back upon, that were full of Vanity, Sin and Folly; and as if this were not enough, have spent your maturer Years in Sin, and are even still going on in your Trespasses; Increasing in Sin, as you increase in Age. Are there not <HI>many</HI> Sins, which you have to reflect on; <HI>heinous</HI> Sins, Sins against the Light, against Warnings and Convictions, against Vows and Resolutions; Sins often repeated, long continued in, and dreadfully aggravated: And yet God has spared you hitherto! You have seen many fall on your right Hand &amp; on your left: and still <HI>you've</HI> been reprieved. You may well wonder,
<PB N="17" REF="003655_0023_10023E030DDAD448"/>
and be astonish'd, that you are as yet on this side the Grave, and out of Hell. Why did not you die, even as many others, in Youth! Is it not a merciful of God, that has made you to differ! O the Riches of Divine Patience toward you! Ad∣mire and magnify it: be affected with it, and improve it to Repentance, lest ere long abused Mercy turn into enraged Justice. The longest Liver surely must die at last: and thinkest thou this, O Man that art an old Practitioner in Sin, that thou shalt escape the Judgment of God? Or despisest thou the Riches of his Goodness &amp; For∣bearance; not knowing that the Goodness of God leadeth thee to Repentance? O do not af∣ter thy Hardness and impenitent Heart persist in Rebellions against God, and Neglects of thy Soul; treasuring up Wrath against the Day of Wrath. Hear that Divine Reproof and Warning, Eccl. 8. 11,—13. <HI>Because Sentence against an evil Work is not executed speedily, therefore the Heart of the Sons of men is fully set in them to do Evil:</HI> But <HI>tho' a Sinner do Evil an hundred times, and his Days be prolonged; yet surely it shall not be well with the Wicked</HI> in the End.—<HI>Eccl.</HI> 6. 3. If a man live many years, and his <HI>Soul be not filled with Good, I say that an untimely Birth is better than he.</HI> It is an awful Threatning, in Isai. 65. 20. <HI>The Sinner be∣ing an hundred years old, shall be accursed.</HI> O that this Word might strike an Awe and fasten upon the Heart of every foolish One, whose hoary Head is a Shame to him, being found in the way of Unrighteousness! Flatter not your self with the Thought of finding-Mercy and dying in Peace, tho' you go on a little longer in your Sins. <HI>Be∣cause there is Wrath,</HI> Treasures of Wrath heaped
<PB N="18" REF="003655_0024_10023E6E53506D70"/>
up by your long Life of Sin, <HI>beware lest God take you away with his Stroke: then a great Ransom can∣not deliver you.</HI> But his Anger will smoke against you, and all the Curses of his violated Law be pour'd on your guilty Head. If impenitent Sin∣ners, dying in <HI>Youth,</HI> have their Life among the <HI>Unclean;</HI> where shall the <HI>old</HI> Sinner appear? Can you expect any better Doom? Verily if you at last die impenitent, full of Days, and full of Sins, you will be of all Men the most miserable: the day of Death will be a day of Wrath, &amp; the day of Judgment, a day of terrible Vengeance, unto you above all others. O consider, before it be too late. It is high time to awake out of Sleep. Give glory to God, before your Feet stumble upon the dark Mountains. It is the Admonition of Heaven to you, Eccl. 11. 8. <HI>If a Man live many days, and re∣joyce in them all, yet let him remember the days of Darkness; for they shall be many.</HI>—O take Heed lest that come upon you, Job 20. 11, &amp; 27. <HI>His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust. The heaven shall reveal his iniquity: and the earth shall rise up against him.</HI></P>
<P>USE II. Do many die in Youth, whose Life is among the Unclean? Here then is a moving Argu∣ment to awaken <HI>Parents</HI> unto an <HI>early</HI> Care and fer∣vent Prayer for their <HI>Children,</HI> that they may be <HI>con∣verted betimes:</HI> and <HI>no Wonder,</HI> pious Parents are full of <HI>Sorrow</HI> and <HI>Fear,</HI> when they see their Chil∣dren <HI>hardning</HI> their Hearts &amp; growing in Sin, as they grow in Years, notwithstanding all their Pains and Prayers for and with them.</P>
<P>God has put into Parents a natural Affection to the Fruit of their own Body; so that they are ten∣derly
<PB N="19" REF="003655_0025_10023E5A99A22DF8"/>
concern'd for the Welfare of their Children. Tho' they be <HI>evil,</HI> they <HI>know how to give good Gifts to their Children:</HI> to nourish their Bodies, to defend 'em from Harms, and provide for 'em a Portion in this Life.—But now let me mind you, that are Parents, of the Duty you owe to the <HI>Souls</HI> of your dear Children. O let not all your Concern for 'em terminate on the outward Man, and centre on the low and mean Things of this transitory World. Remember, your Children are Children of <HI>Death,</HI> and Children of <HI>Wrath</HI> by Nature; They are bound for another World; They may die in <HI>Youth:</HI> They may, if let alone to go on in their Sins, come to an <HI>infamous</HI> End, and bring you to Shame: and if they die in their natural State, their Life in another World will be among the <HI>Unclean;</HI> not among the Saints in Light, not a∣mong the pure and blessed Spirits in Heaven, but among the filthy accursed Spirits in a miserable Hell.—And can you bear the Tho't of this! Do not your Bowels now yearn within you for 'em! Will not a Father pity his Children, or can a Mo∣ther forget to have Compassion on the Son of her Womb!—O pity the perishing Souls of your poor Children. Fear the Sin and Doom of <HI>Eli;</HI> who, when his Sons made themselves vile, restrain∣ed them not, and God judged his House by cutting off all the Increase of it in the Flower of their Age. O save your Children with fear: <HI>plucking them as Brands out of the Fire.</HI> Mourn their Sins: mourn their guilty, polluted, miserable &amp; exposed State by Nature. Realise their Need of a sanctifying Change: and let it be your first and great Care for them, that they may be born again; without which they can never see the Kingdom of Heaven.
<PB N="20" REF="003655_0026_10023E7008B7CFC0"/>
Let it be your Heart's Desire and Prayer to God for them, and your continual Endeavour, in the use of appointed Means, that they may be con∣verted betimes. Begin <HI>early</HI> with them, and fol∣low 'em incessantly with your pious Instructions, Counsels, Reproofs, and Warnings. Charge 'em, as <HI>David</HI> did his Son <HI>Solomon,</HI> 1 Chron. 28. 9. <HI>And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy fa∣ther, and serve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind; for the Lord searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the tho'ts: if thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.</HI> Set an holy <HI>Example</HI> before 'em; walking in your House with a perfect Heart.—And to enforce Means and Endeavours, Offer up fervent <HI>Prayers</HI> to the God of all Grace, that he would by his Spirit be∣get your Children to a new &amp; divine Life.—Thus <HI>Abraham</HI> pray'd, <HI>O that Ishmael might live in thy sight!</HI> Gen. 17. 18. So <HI>David,</HI> 1 Chron. 29. 19. <HI>Give un∣to Solomon my son a perfect heart to keep thy com∣mandments.</HI> And if you obtain this for 'em, you will have Joy in them, supposing they live to ma∣ture Years: or if they die in Youth, you will have this for your Consolation, the Hope that their Life in the World of Spirits, is not among the Unclean, but among the Perfected in Glory.</P>
<P>And as to you, who have Children adult or growing up, but cannot see them under any hope∣ful Impressions; <HI>no Wonder,</HI> if you are bow'd down with Sorrow for them and go mourning all the day. Ah! Your Hearts may well meditate Ter∣ror, when you think what miserable Circumstances they may bring themselves by Sin into even here, and that if they should die in Youth, unconverted
<PB N="21" REF="003655_0027_10023DF061BF2CE8"/>
and unpardon'd, they must be undone, for ever undone; must have their Life among the Unclean in a future State, and become a Prey to the worst of all Devourers. How can your Minds but be in Pain! How can you but be full of Anxiety and Anguish; to see your Children hardning their Hearts in Sin, careless of their Souls, &amp; taking Methods to hasten on themselves Destruction without a Re∣medy! Alas, What tender and serious Parent can see this without a weeping Eye, and bleeding Heart!—Yet let your Sorrow and your Fear be kept within due Bounds, and under a holy Regu∣lation. Duty is yours; the Event is God's. Whatever your Fears are, don't slacken your Pains or Prayers. I propound that Example of a de∣vout and watchful Parent to you, Job. 1. 5. <HI>And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt-offerings ac∣cording to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.</HI></P>
<P>USE III. Is it so, that many die in Youth, whose Life is among the Unclean? How astonish∣ing is the <HI>Stupidity</HI> and <HI>Security</HI> of wicked &amp; pro∣fane Young People! How <HI>foolish</HI> &amp; <HI>mad</HI> their pre∣sent Mirth and Jollity in ways of Sin! Sure I am, they have little Reason to rejoyce in Iniquity.</P>
<P><HI>Sin</HI> is the most unprofitable Thing in the World; yea, the most dangerous and injurious. It tends to wound the Name, ruin the Estate, destroy the Body, and damn the Soul.—However Fools may make a mock at Sin, and put far away the evil Day; however it may be an Abomination
<PB N="22" REF="003655_0028_10023E5DCF8AA728"/>
to Fools to depart from their wicked ways: yet surely Evil pursueth Sinners, and Wo to them that are at Ease in Zion. Wo to you that laugh now; for ye shall mourn at the last. The Plea∣sures of Sin are but for a Season: they are short in their Duration, brutish in their Nature, and bane∣ful in their Consequence. How often do we see the Wicked fall by their own wickedness; the Backslider in Heart filled with his own Ways, and Transgressors taken in their own Naughtiness! Oh how often do we see the Lamp of the wicked put out! the Simple pass on and are punished. How many lose their Lives in the Pursuit of sinful Pleasures! How many lose their Souls! How ma∣ny by this means bring Shame and Ruin on them∣selves in this World, and everlasting Contempt and Misery in the future!</P>
<P>And yet notwithstanding the Warnings given by others Harms; notwithstanding the Admoni∣tions given by God in his Providence, and in his Word; alas! Are there not many of our young People that have fellowship with the unfruitful Works of Darkness, serving divers Lusts &amp; Plea∣sures? O the Folly you are guilty of! We mourn your Folly: We pity you as Children void of Wisdom. You are your own Enemies: you are destroying yourselves, Soul and Body. You seem to love Death, and court Destruction. You are taking the surest Methods to shorten your Days in this World, and to hasten your Damnation in the next. And yet (amazing!) you dwell at Ease, as if you were in no Hazard. You appear lost to the Reflections of reasonable Creatures. Surely you have not the Understanding of Men: but may justly be compar'd to the Brutes, that have no
<PB N="23" REF="003655_0029_10023E4C983AA300"/>
Knowledge. Prov. 7<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 22, 23. <HI>He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaugh∣ter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks, Till a dart strike through his liver, as a bird hast∣eth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.</HI> That's the Censure pass'd upon secure Im∣penitents, Eccl. 9. 3. <HI>The heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.</HI> They bring themselves to a miserable End; often to an un∣timely &amp; ignominious Death: But that is not all; they throw themselves into a burning Hell; they bring everlasting Destruction on their Souls. Prov. 9. 17, 18. <HI>Stollen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant. But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her guests are in the depths of hell.</HI> Surely <HI>Madness</HI> is in their Heart while they live, who to enjoy the Pleasures of Sin, will expose their Souls, their precious and immortal Souls, to the Hazard of being gather'd with Sin∣ners in Hell, when they die.</P>
<P>How can you now think of this, and not be a∣fraid! Or are you more brutish than the Beasts that perish! Be astonish'd, O Heavens, at this! Be horribly afraid, O Earth!</P>
<P>USE IV. From what has been said, we may infer the <HI>Happiness,</HI> and the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of such as are <HI>cleansing their way</HI> and <HI>fearing</HI> God in their Youth.</P>
<P>Thro' the Grace of Christ, we trust, there is a Number of Young People of this Character a∣mong us:—tho' (alas) but a small Remnant. And to such I would bring this day the Consola∣tions of God, after the Lessons of Terror that have been uttered.</P>

Know it then, such of you as are indeed seek∣ing God and following after Righteousness, you are taking a happy method to obtain long Life in this World, and eternal Life in the next.—You are the most likely to live long on the Earth: for as we read Prov. 10. 27. The <HI>Fear of the Lord pro∣longeth Days.</HI> It hath a natural Tendency to do so, Chap 11. 19. <HI>Righteousness tendeth to Life.</HI> And Godliness hath the <HI>Promise</HI> of the Life, which now is. Prov. 14. 10. <HI>Receive my Sayings, and the Years of thy Life shall be many.</HI>—Chap 9. 10, 11. <HI>The Fear of the Lord is the beginning of Wisdom:—for by me thy Days shall be multiplied, and the Years of thy Life shall be increased.</HI>—However, if God should see good to take you away in Youth, you will be able by his Grace to resign chearfully to his Will; having overcome the World by Faith, you will be satisfy'd with Life, whether longer or shorter. And the earlier you die, you will but the sooner get to your Reward in Heaven. If you do but give Diligence in the Work of God, you may live long in a little Time: and tho' in re∣spect of Age, you may die a very Child, yet in respect of spiritual Attainments, you may be said to die an <HI>hundred years old.</HI> (Isa. 65. 20.) And the Promise of long Life shall be gloriously accom∣plish'd to you in a better World. When you die, you shall enter into Life; Life eternal; a Life as happy, as long: Not among the Unclean; but a∣midst holy Angels &amp; glorify'd Saints in Heaven: a Life of Communion with the blessed God in ful∣ness of Joy for evermore. O the <HI>Consolation,</HI> that this should be to you now, under all the Troubles of this mutable World, and under the Apprehen∣sions of hastning Death and Judgment! And the
<PB N="25" REF="003655_0031_10023E0DB07810D8"/>
<HI>Wisdom</HI> of your present Conduct from hence a∣bundantly appears. We read, Prov. 28 7. <HI>Whoso keepeth the Law is a wise son.</HI> He is truly a wise Child, that fears God, that seeks Christ <HI>betimes;</HI> whose Loving-kindness is better than Life. Such a Youth minds the one Thing needful; regards his truest Interest; has the best End in View, and the best Means in Use. He takes the surest Method to promote his own Usefulness and Comfort in the present, and secure his eternal Happiness in the coming World. Surely the Knowledge of the Holy is Understanding. Better is a poor &amp; <HI>wise Child,</HI> than an old and <HI>foolish King,</HI> however great and rich. O what Praises are due to the Grace of God in Christ, who has made you to differ, made you to excel! By his Grace alone it is, that you are what you are, in respect of every good thing found in you, towards the Lord your God.—And he expects singular Returns from you in ways of Gratitude, Love, and Obedience. Be much in meditating &amp; admiring the Distinction, sovereign Divine Mercy has put upon you; that while thou∣sands of others are made Pillars of Salt for the glory of vindictive Justice, you are among the bright Monuments of saving Grace, and belong to that happy Number, in whom Christ, when he comes, shall be glorify'd, and admired for ever. Let it be your solicitous Study now to bring all possible Honour to Christ, in a way of Obedience to his Gospel. Ye were sometimes Darkness, but now are Light in the Lord: walk as Children of Light. See that you walk circumspectly, not as Fools, but as wise. Beware that the way of Truth be not evil spoken of on your account: let not that worthy Name, by which you are call'd, be
<PB N="26" REF="003655_0032_10023E405336B380"/>
blasphemed thro' you at any time. Remember how <HI>David</HI> sinned in the matter of <HI>Uriah,</HI> by which he gave Occasion to the Enemies of the Lord to blaspheme, and for which God was displeased with him. Take Warning from his Example: Watch and pray, that ye enter not into Temptation. Falls into Sin will cost you a bitter Repentance, &amp; may draw down heavy Corrections upon you, in order to bring you to Repentance, that you may not be condemned with the World. Let the Life you now live in the flesh, be <HI>by the Faith of the Son of God:</HI> Trust in him to keep you from the Evil; and you may hope to be deliver'd from every evil Work, and preserved to his heavenly Kingdom.</P>
<P>I pass now to another Head.</P>
<P>USE V. Let it be a word of <HI>Warning</HI> &amp; <HI>Ex∣hortation</HI> to all our Young People, that they <HI>be∣ware of those dangerous</HI> and <HI>provoking Evils,</HI> which have so often been the Means of bringing others to an untimely End; lest they also die in Youth, and their Life be among the Unclean.</P>
<P>Attend to the solemn Caveat in our Text: <HI>Because there is Wrath, beware lest God take thee a∣way with his Stroke; then a great Ransom cannot deliver thee.</HI> There is Wrath <HI>secret,</HI> in his holy Breast; he is angry with the Wicked every day. There is Wrath <HI>revealed,</HI> in his Word and Provi∣dence. There is present Wrath in <HI>this</HI> World: and a Wrath to come in the <HI>eternal</HI> World. The Threatnings and the Judgments of God proclaim his Indignation against Sin, and speak Terror to Sinners. The Wrath of God is truly tremendous: <HI>Who knows the power of his Anger? Who can stand
<PB N="27" REF="003655_0033_10020264DE4E29D8"/>
before him, when once he is angry?</HI> O beware then of the Wrath of God: beware of every Thing that tends to kindle against you this consuming Fire.</P>
<P>You should be afraid of humane Justice, the Wrath of the civil Magistrate. <HI>For Rulers are a Terror, not to good Works, but to evil: wilt thou then not be afraid of the Power? If thou do that which is evil, be afraid: for he beareth not the Sword in vain: for he is the Minister of God, a Revenger to execute Wrath upon him that doth Evil,</HI> Rom. 13 3, 4.</P>
<P>But you should above all be afraid of Divine Justice, the Wrath of the supreme Ruler: into whose Hands it is a most fearful thing for any to fall. Job 19 29. <HI>Be ye afraid of the Sword; for Wrath bringeth the Punishments of the Sword, that ye may know there is a Judgment.</HI> It was the saying of <HI>Job,</HI> God knoweth the Way that I take; <HI>when I consider, I am afraid of him</HI> And <HI>David</HI> said, <HI>My Flesh trembleth for Fear of God; I am afraid of his Judgments.</HI> And will not <HI>you</HI> be afraid? Will not <HI>you</HI> tremble at the Presence of an holy God, who are in danger of the Judgment, in danger of Hell-fire! O consider, and beware. <HI>Because there is Wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his Stroke.</HI> Beware of every grievous and provoking Evil: beware of undoing Ignorance and Error, of Impiety and Profaneness, of Im∣morality and Vice, of carnal Security and Hypo∣crisy! Upon each of these Heads distinctly I shall now give some short and solemn Lectures of Caution: to which, in the Name of God, I de∣mand an awaken'd Attention.</P>
<P N="1">1. Beware of undoing <HI>Ignorance</HI> and <HI>Error.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="003655_0034_10023DF3B77D3340"/>
These are Snares of the Devil, by which many Souls are captivated, and held under the Power of Satan, until the Arrows of Death dispatch 'em out of the World, and send 'em down to the Chains of Darkness in Hell, without a Remedy. O be upon your Guard, study and watch and pray, that your Souls be not ensnar'd and undone by fatal Ignorance or Error.</P>
<P>Beware of undoing <HI>Ignorance.</HI> As you love your Souls, and wou'd save them from Destruction, be careful to get necessary Knowledge; I mean, in Things spiritual and Divine. <HI>That the Soul be without Knowledge, it is not good;</HI> it is not safe. Grosly ignorant Souls are capable of doing but little Good, and of getting but little Good. They are expos'd to innumerable Evils, and fall an easy Prey to the subtil Adversary of Souls. It was GOD's Complaint in old time, <HI>My People are de∣stroy'd for lack of Knowledge.</HI> Take heed that this be not <HI>your</HI> Ruin. It may be you think there's little danger of it, in this Land of Light: perhaps you are puffed up with a vain Conceit of your Attainments in Divine Knowledge. But I would mind you of that of the Apostle, <HI>If any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet, as he ought to know it.</HI> And may it not be com∣plain'd as to many, <HI>When for the Time,</HI> and the Ad∣vantages you've had, ye might be qualify'd to be <HI>Teachers, ye have Need that one teach you again which be the first Principles of the Oracles of God! Some have not the Knowledge of God: I speak this to your Shame.</HI> O take heed, lest ye be found <HI>worshipping ye know not what.</HI> Take heed, lest as concerning one Gospel-Truth or Precept and another, that Charge lie against you, <HI>Of this ye are willingly ig∣norant.</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="003655_0035_10023E5055A1EB08"/>
If you would escape the <HI>Pollutions</HI> of the World, it must be through the <HI>Knowledge</HI> of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ. He that is blind, cannot see afar off, to espy and avoid Dangers. He that walketh in Darkness, knoweth not whi∣ther he goeth, nor how to shun the Stumbling-blocks before him. Thro' Knowledge shall the Just be deliver'd: but he that hateth Knowledge, is brutish; and no wonder if the brutish Person pe∣rish. How often is shame the Promotion of Fools, and a miserable Death the Wages of affected Ig∣norance! O do not despise your Souls, by refu∣sing Instruction; lest it be your awful Punishment <HI>to die without Instruction,</HI> and go into Blackness of Darkness for ever. How long, ye simple ones, will ye love Simplicity, and Fools hate Knowledge? <HI>Be ye not as the Horse and the Mule, without Under∣standing:</HI> lest you be left in the greatness of your Folly to go astray, and run blindfold to an untime∣ly Death and eternal Destruction; as the <HI>Ox goeth to the Slaughter,</HI> or as a <HI>Bird hastneth to the Snare,</HI> and <HI>knoweth not that it is for his Life.</HI></P>
<P>I would earnestly caution you also against the dangerous Snare of <HI>Errors</HI> and false Opinions in Religion. You may be Masters of a great deal of Knowledge (Science, falsely so called) and yet have very <HI>wrong Notions,</HI> in divine matters of the greatest Importance. There are Errors, that strike at the Vitals of Christianity, and sap the Foundations of Religion: mortal and damning Errors, which many, even under the Light of the glorious Gospel, give an easy Entertainment to; being calculated to gratify the Pride, or indulge the Sensuality of corrupt Nature. None can be such a Stranger in Israel, as not to know that in
<PB N="30" REF="003655_0036_10023E0576B65130"/>
this day of abounding Errors, some of the most Soul-concerning Truths are by many call'd in Question, yea exploded with Derision: and the contrary <HI>ungodly Principles</HI> eagerly embrac'd and zealously disseminated; even such as may well make our Ears tingle to hear them. O <HI>beware that ye be not led away with the Errors of the Wicked,</HI> and make Shipwrack of Faith and a good Consci∣ence. I am jealous over you, O our Young Peo∣ple, in this giddy Period of your Life and in these Times of growing Infidelity and Heresy; I fear lest by any means as the Serpent beguiled Eve thro' his Subtilty, so your Minds should be cor∣rupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ, and be removed to another Gospel; which yet is not another:—for some are already turned aside af∣ter Satan, and they lie in wait to seduce others, to beguile unstable Souls. O take Heed, and let no Man deceive you with vain Words. Be not Children, tossed to and fro, and carry'd about with every Wind of Doctrine, by the slight of Men, and cunning Stratagems, whereby they lie in wait to deceive. Whatever Flouts you may hear at <HI>Orthodoxy,</HI> as a matter of no Significance; yet realise it, that, 'tis thro' Sanctification of the Spi∣rit and <HI>Belief of the Truth,</HI> we are chosen to Sal∣vation. Realise it, there are <HI>Doctrines of Devils,</HI> hellish Errors, impious, profane and malignant; which <HI>eat as doth a Canker,</HI> have a corrupt Influence into the Heart and Life, and are of fatal Consequence. Be exhorted then to take Heed of Seducers; mark them which cause Di∣visions and Offences contrary to the Doctrine which ye have learned, the Doctrine of Christ, the Faith once deliver'd to the Saints; mark such, and avoid
<PB N="31" REF="003655_0037_10023DF619A70440"/>
them.—Be not soon shaken in Mind, by the perverse disputings of Men of corrupt Minds. Beware lest any Man spoil you thro' Philosophy &amp; vain Deceit, after the Wisdom of this World, &amp; not after Christ. Beware of indulging your selves in carnal Reason∣ings against the Mysteries of Divine Revelation, however incomprehensible: Beware of indulging a secret Enmity to Gospel-Truths, however hum∣bling and mortifying to Flesh &amp; Blood, and how∣ever unreputable in an Age of prevailing Infide∣lity and Vice. Take heed that worldly Interest, or Applause with Men, do not bribe you in favour of any Error, when it is become fashionable or popular. Take heed, that you don't run into any Error grateful to a proud or worldly and sensual Mind, for the easing a wounded Conscience, and stifling of Convictions. In a Word, Beware of grieving the Holy Spirit by practically denying the Faith, lest He be provoked to give you up to a Spirit of Error; leave you to fall into <HI>damnable Heresies;</HI> and bring on your selves <HI>swift Destruction.</HI> As it is written, <HI>They received not the Love of the Truth, that they might be saved: and for this cause God shall send them strong Delusion, that they should believe a Lie; that they all might be damned, who believed not the Truth, but had Pleasure in Unrigh∣teousness.</HI> Take Heed lest that come upon you; <HI>Even as they did not like to retain God in their Know∣ledge,</HI> but became vain in their Imaginations, <HI>God gave them over</HI> to a reprobate Mind, and unto vile Affections, to do those things which are <HI>worthy of Death.</HI> O our young People, as you would avoid the <HI>ways of Death,</HI> as you wou'd shun the <HI>paths of the Destroyer,</HI> beware that you be not found walk∣ing in the paths of <HI>Error</HI> and <HI>Ignorance.</HI>—This was the first Caution.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="32" REF="003655_0038_10023E7346BD3070"/>
2. Beware of all <HI>Profanity,</HI> and <HI>Irreligion.</HI></P>
<P>Take good Heed unto your selves that ye love the Lord your God; that ye be Worshippers of God, and confess Christ before Men. However orthodox and knowing in Religion you may be; yet take Care that you do not satisfy yourselves with a mere speculative Belief of the Truth; separate from agreable Impressions on the Heart and practical Acknowledgments in the Life. Take heed lest that be fulfilled in you; <HI>They are without Excuse, because that when they knew God, they glorify'd him not as God, neither were thankful.</HI> Take heed that you do not cast off Fear, and restrain Prayer be∣fore God; that you don't neglect secret Prayer in particular, &amp; so live as without God in the World. Beware of those growing Sins of the Times, pro∣fane Swearing and taking the Name of God in vain, Sabbath-breaking, despising the Gospel of Christ, neglecting the Publick Worship of God, mocking at the Messengers of the Lord, deriding serious Devotion and a tender Conscience, and turning Sacramental Mysteries into Banter. <HI>O be ye not Mockers, lest your Bands be made strong;</HI> lest you provoke a holy God to lead you forth with the Workers of Iniquity, and hang you up in Chains, as Monuments of his just Severity. Take heed lest any of you be profane Persons, as <HI>Esau,</HI> and miss the Blessing. Beware lest a terrible and jealous God come forth in Indignation to plead the Cause of his despised Name, and smite you, as he did profane <HI>Nadab</HI> and <HI>Abihu,</HI> by Fire from Hea∣ven; lest he tear you in pieces by wild Beasts, as he did the Children that mocked <HI>Elisha;</HI> or lest he drown you in perdition, as he did the Scoffers of the old World; <HI>making them an Ensample unto
<PB N="33" REF="003655_0039_10023E60678B69C0"/>
all that after shou'd live ungodly.</HI>—Do you not often hear Malefactors, under Sentence of Death, confessing &amp; bewailing their <HI>Profaneness,</HI> as what led the way to all their fatal Wickedness? And will you not take Warning from their Example, to deny all Ungodliness, lest it be your Ruine in the end for both Worlds! <HI>Beware lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the Prophets, Behold, ye Despisers, and wonder, and perish.</HI> Hear this, O ye that say, When will the Sabbath be over, that we may sell Corn, may return to Business or Di∣version? that say, What a Weariness is it? that snuff at God's Altar, and call his Table contemp∣tible: <HI>Behold, He will cut off the man that doth this.</HI> The Lord hath sworn by the Excellency of <HI>Jacob,</HI> Surely I will not forget any of their Works. Shall not I visit for these Things, saith the Lord, and shall not my Soul be avenged on such as do these things!</P>
<P N="3">3. Beware of all <HI>Sensuality</HI> and <HI>Vice,</HI> and every <HI>criminal Course.</HI></P>
<P>You must not only deny Ungodliness, but <HI>worldly Lusts,</HI> &amp; live <HI>soberly</HI> &amp; <HI>righteously,</HI> as well as godlily in this present World, if you wou' descape the Wrath of God in the next. His Wrath is revealed from Heaven, as against all Ungodliness, so against all <HI>Unrighteousness</HI> of Men. What will it profit you, to have a Form of Godliness, if you deny the Power of it, by living in Vice? Thus saith the Lord, Trust ye not in lying Words, crying, The Temple of the Lord! Will ye steal, &amp; murder, &amp; commit Adultery; and come &amp; stand before me, and say, We are deliver'd to do all these Abominations! Behold, ye trust in lying Words, that cannot profit! Will ye provoke me to Anger, saith the Lord?
<PB N="34" REF="003655_0040_10023DD08F138710"/>
Will it not be to the Confusion of your own faces? Let not him that is deceived, trust in Vanity; for Vanity shall be his Recompence: <HI>it shall be ac∣complished before his time, and his Branch shall not be green.</HI></P>
<P>O our young People, hear that Divine Warn∣ing, Eccl 7. 17. <HI>Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou foolish: Why shouldest thou die before thy Time!</HI> There are many heinous Vices and Immoralities, and one of which if you indulge yourselves in, and besure then if in a Variety of them, you may be said to be <HI>wicked overmuch;</HI> may justly be rank'd among the <HI>Fools in Israel;</HI> and will be in danger of <HI>dying before your Time.</HI> Beware of these Things, as you would not <HI>die in Youth,</HI> and come to a mi∣serable End of a scandalous Life. O see that you <HI>flee youthful Lusts.</HI> These will but kindle the Fire of Hell in your Bosom, and prepare you for the e∣verlasting Burnings: and how often do they bring down the <HI>Wrath</HI> of God on the Children of Dis∣obedience, <HI>taking them away with a stroke,</HI> &amp; send∣ing 'em to the place of Torments, from whence <HI>a great Ransom cannot deliver them!</HI></P>
<P>I wou'd caution you particularly in a few Words.</P>
<P N="1">1 Beware of <HI>Disobedience</HI> to your <HI>Parents;</HI> whe∣ther natural, civil, or spiritual.—'Tis the Fifth Commandment in the sacred Decalogue, <HI>Honour thy Father and Mother,</HI> that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayst <HI>live long on the Earth.</HI> It implies a Curse upon the Disobedient, that they shall soon be cut off: And the Word of God ex∣presly threatens, That <HI>the Eye which mocketh at his Father, and despiseth to obey his Mother, the Ravens of the Valley shall pick it out, and the young Eagles
<PB N="35" REF="003655_0041_10023DD417E412D8"/>
shall eat it:</HI>—i. e such shall come to the Gallows, be hung up in Gibbets, &amp; their Carcases become Food for the Birds of the Air. And how often do we see this is the miserable End of undutiful Chil∣dren, of heady unruly Servants, &amp; rebellious Sub∣jects! O our Children, take heed that you do not walk in the paths of Disobedience; lest the Curse of the Fifth Commandment cut you off, as it did <HI>Absalom</HI> (the Son of <HI>David</HI>) who rose up in Re∣bellion against his Father, and was thrust out of the World as an Execration.</P>
<P N="2">2. Beware of the Sin of <HI>Pride.</HI></P>
<P>This is a lust that very early discovers itself in young ones; has a peculiar Power over them; and being not check'd in its Beginnings, quickly grows rampant in many, brings them into Mischief, and produces fatal Effects. It is written, <HI>God resisteth the Proud:</HI> and very often in his over-ruling Pro∣vidence he brings strange Punishments upon them. How frequently do we see that Proverb sadly veri∣fy'd in Young People; <HI>Pride goeth before Destruction, and a haughty Spirit before a Fall!</HI> Pride has made many Youths impatient of Family-Government, and by an Affectation of lawless Liberty bro't them into a Snare and Ruin. Pride, working by Envy or Resentment, has tempted many a young Man, to make or accept a Challenge to some bloody <HI>Duel,</HI> in which he has fallen by the Sword; or else has kill'd his Brother, &amp; so made way for his own ignominious Execution by the Halter. So Pride has tempted many a young Woman to destroy the Fruit of her own Body, that she might avoid the Scandal of a spurious Child; and the monstrous Fact being detected, has brought her to yet greater Shame, by an infamous Execution, as a Murderer.</P>

Hear ye then, O our Sons and Daughters, hear ye, and be not proud. Be not high-minded, but fear. Be ye clothed with Humility: let this be your Ornament &amp; Guard. Let our Sons take Warning from that wicked <HI>Haman,</HI> whom Pride bro't to the Gallows. And let our young Women be admonish'd by those Words of the Prophet; <HI>Moreover the Lord saith, Because the Daughters of Zion are haughty, &amp; walk with stretched forth Necks, and want a Eyes; therefore the Lord will smite with a Scab the Crown of the Head of the Daughters of Zion:</HI> and <HI>it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet Smell there shall be Stink; and instead of a Girdle, a Rent; and instead of well set Hair, Baldness; and instead of a Stomacher, a girding of Sackcloth; and Burning, in stead of Beauty.</HI>—Remember also the Words of <HI>Solomon; Favour is deceitful, &amp; Beauty is vain.</HI> How many that proudly valu'd themselves upon it, have been expos'd by it to such Temptations, as have been the Ruin of their Virtue, rob'd 'em of their Honour, cost 'em their Lives in the End, and destroy'd their precious Souls! Let every proud one look in <HI>Jezebel'</HI>s painted face; and take warning from her miserable Fall &amp; Ruine. <HI>Go, see now this cursed Woman,</HI> said Jehu, <HI>and bury her.</HI> I wou'd say, <HI>Go see her,</HI> &amp; in her see <HI>the End of a haughty Spirit;</HI> see the <HI>Folly,</HI> the <HI>Sin</HI> &amp; <HI>Danger</HI> of Pride: &amp; take Warning from this Example, which was put on Record for your Admonition.</P>
<P N="3">3. Beware of the Sin of <HI>Lying.</HI></P>
<P>Among the seven Things, which <HI>Solomon</HI> reckons up, as an Abomination to the Lord, those two stand in the front, <HI>A proud look, and a lying Tongue.</HI> But alas! how doth this Sin of Lying abound among us! 'Tis one of the earliest Sins of Youth. <HI>They go
<PB N="37" REF="003655_0043_10023E75ADE4FA48"/>
astray as soon as they be born, speaking Lies.</HI> And the evil Habit grows on many, as they advance in Years and Cunning.</P>
<P>But be warned, O our Children, to flee this youthful Lust; and beware lest <HI>lying Lips be the Snare of your Souls,</HI> the Ruin of your good Name, and the Loss of your precious Lives in the End.</P>
<P>Are you tempted to tell Lies for <HI>Diversion;</HI> making yourselves and others Merry with false Stories, as with <HI>slanderous</HI> Reports, or the like? Re∣member, Truth is too sacred a Thing to be trifled with; and the Reputation of your Neighbour too valuable to be treated in so ludicrous and abusive a manner. Will you, <HI>as Madmen, cast about Fire∣brands, Arrows and Death? and say, Am I not in Sport!</HI> Such Mirth surely it is mad. It is often as the piercings of a Sword to the abused Party: And what bloody Revenges do these merry Re∣vilings often produce! He that sportfully rolleth a Stone, often finds it return upon him to his Cost.</P>
<P>Or are you tempted to tell Lies for <HI>Flattery;</HI> speaking fair with the Mouth, while perhaps there are seven Abominations in the Heart? Take heed lest a <HI>flattering Tongue work Ruin</HI> to your selves, as well as your Neighbour. <HI>The Kisses of an Enemy are deceitful,</HI> and provoking: and often have no other Return but Hatred &amp; Indignation.—The Lord has threaten'd <HI>to cut off all flattering Lips.</HI> He has said, <HI>Whose Hatred is covered by Deceit, his Wickedness shall be shewed before the whole Congrega∣tion.</HI>—And how do you know, while you hide Hatred with lying Lips, &amp; let Anger rest in your Bosom, but that before you are aware the smother'd Fire may break out, beyond Controul, in Fury and Mischief, that shall prepare the way for your In∣famy &amp; Ruin!</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="003655_0044_10023E7827A65848"/>
Or, again, are you tempted to tell Lies for <HI>Pro∣fit;</HI> in matters of Trade speaking falsely, to get Gain by cheating others? O take heed that you deal not Treacherously, lest the Sin of your Mouth bring you into undoing Snares. Remember that Word; <HI>The getting of Treasures by a lying Tongue is a Vanity tossed to &amp; fro of them that seek Death: the Robbery of the Wicked shall destroy them:</HI> They that make no Conscience of telling a Lie, when there's anything to be got by it, do expose themselves to the Envy &amp; ill Will of Men, and to the Wrath and Curse of God. You had as good pick a Man's Pocket, as cheat him by a Lie: And as this leads to that, take heed lest you be punish'd for one by being left to the other, and so proceed from Evil to Evil, till you be undone, as to Name, Estate, and Life, and destroy your Soul for ever.</P>
<P>In a word, Are you tempted to Lying, from a <HI>Fear of Punishment;</HI> inventing Falsehoods to hide some Fault you have been guilty of? Remember, this is but to make two faults of one, and will ex∣pose you to double Punishment upon the Disco∣very. And then consider, this is an unhappy Me∣thod to harden you in your Sin, &amp; tends to draw you into a Snare by tempting you to other Sins. If once the Spirit of Lying takes possession of you, and especially if you find it a successful Means, in repeated Instances, to conceal your Faults, &amp; screen you from Punishment; it will prepare you and tempt you to other Sins, which there's any Hope of covering by a Lie. A Habit of Lying has a fatal Tendency to blind and stupify Conscience: It drives away the holy Spirit: it gratifies the De∣vil, the Father of Lies, &amp; emboldens him to tempt you to the worst of Crimes, until you fill up the
<PB N="39" REF="003655_0045_10023DD69B59F7E8"/>
measure of your Iniquity. O take Heed lest by this Snare he ruin your Soul: fear to indulge yourselves in Lying, lest Satan draw you on from this Sin to others; from Lying to Perjury; from Lying to profane Swearing and Cursing; to Blasphemy; to such Crimes as will bring the greatest Scandal, and perhaps a shameful &amp; untimely Death; but besure (without Repentance) an eternal Punishment.</P>
<P>Let the Fear of God restrain you from this Sin: for he has said, <HI>The mouth of Liars shall be stopped;</HI> and that <HI>all Liars have their part in the Lake, which burns with fire and brimstone.</HI> Will you not then put away Lying! O see you be Children that will not lie, as you would not ripen yourselves for a dreadful Vengeance.</P>
<P N="4">4. Beware of rash <HI>Anger, Envy, Malice,</HI> and a Spirit of <HI>Revenge.</HI></P>

<P>This makes Men Devils incarnate, &amp; has temp∣ted many (as <HI>Ahithophel</HI> and <HI>Judas</HI>) to the most unnatural &amp; monstrous Act of <HI>Self-Murder.</HI> Or it has so distracted their Minds, as to put them upon the barbarous Murder of <HI>others</HI> about 'em, even their dearest Friends: and so bro't them to die before their time by the civil Sword.

6. Beware of <HI>Covetousness,</HI> and <HI>a worldly Mind.</HI> The Love of Money is the <HI>Root of all Evil:</HI> 'tis an <HI>evil Disease,</HI> that has slain its Thousands. They that <HI>will be rich,</HI> fall into Temptation and a Snare, and into many foolish and hurtful Lusts, which often end in Destruction. This has made many to be <HI>Murderers of Fathers and Mothers,</HI> and Murderers of Brethren, that they might the sooner come to the Inheritance or possess it alone: but how often have they hereby bro't themselves un∣der the Wrath of Man, as well as the Curse of God, which has cut them off with a stroke, &amp; turn'd 'em at once out of the possession of their Estates and their Souls. Thus God rendred the Wickedness of <HI>Abimeleck,</HI> the Son of <HI>Jerubbaal,</HI> on his own head; the Wickedness he did unto his Father, in slaying his Seventy Brethren, that he might reign alone: and upon him came the Curse of <HI>Jotham.</HI>—How many have by Greediness after Gain, been tempted to dishonest Practices, to vicious Gaming, to Robbery, to Piracy, or the like; and it has hap∣pen'd to 'em according to the true Proverb, <HI>He that getteth Riches and not by Right, shall leave them in the midst of his days, and at his end shall be a Fool.</HI> Surely in such ways Men <HI>lurk privily for their own Lives.</HI> Take Heed then &amp; beware of Cove∣tousness. Remember <HI>Achan'</HI>s Folly and the un∣timely and accursed Death it bro't him to: and take Warning, that worldly Lusts be not your Ruin. Surely <HI>Whoso is Partner with a Thief, hateth his own Soul. Whoso robbeth his Father or his Mo∣ther,</HI> his Master or his Mistress, <HI>and saith, It is no Transgression, the same is the Companion of a Destroyer; is a Son that causeth Shame, and bringeth Reproach,</HI> and is in danger of having <HI>his Lamp put out in ob∣scure

<P N="7">7. Beware of <HI>Lasciviousness,</HI> &amp; all <HI>Uncleanness.</HI> This Sin of Unchastity is what the Heat of Youth will particularly dispose you to: but <HI>let it not be once named amongst you, as becometh Saints: for this ye know, that no Whoremonger, nor unclean Person</HI> (no unclean Person of any kind, whether Forni∣cator, or Adulterer, or Effeminate, &amp; Abusers of themselves) <HI>have any Inheritance in the Kingdom of God.</HI> Let no man deceive you with vain words: for <HI>because of these Things cometh the Wrath of God</HI> on the Children of Disobedience. Be ye not there∣fore partakers with them: lest you give your Years to the Cruel, &amp; you mourn at the last, when your Flesh is consumed, and your Soul destroy'd. Let our Sons remember &amp; take Warning from the aw∣ful Death of abominable <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an,</HI> the wretched Exit of adulterous <HI>Hophni</HI> &amp; <HI>Phinehas,</HI> &amp; of incestuous <HI>Amnon,</HI> &amp; the dreadful Overthrow of the accursed <HI>Sodomites.</HI> And let our Daughters remember and take Warning from the tragical Story of the <HI>Damsel</HI> of <HI>Bethlehem-Judah,</HI> who <HI>play'd the Whore,</HI> and was <HI>abused to Death</HI> by certain Sons of Belial.—O let our young People beware of indulging an unclean Spirit, &amp; resist it in its very minutest Beginnings: for <HI>Lust, when it hath conceived, bringeth forth Sin; and Sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth Death,</HI> as you see this day. Take Heed, lest a sovereign God say concerning you, <HI>He that is filthy, let him be filthy still:</HI> until you become <HI>hot as an Oven,</HI> and your Wickedness burn as the Fire, &amp; consume you. O take Heed: lest it happen that you <HI>bring forth Children to the Murderer;</HI> and it be said of thee, <HI>In

Will our young People be perswaded to take Direction and Warning from an inspired Apostle! 1 Cor. 7. 2, 5. <HI>To avoid For∣nication, let every Man have his own Wife, &amp; let every Woman have her own Husband:—that Satan tempt you not for your Incontinency.</HI> So 1 Tim. 5. 14, 15. <HI>I will that young</HI> Persons <HI>marry,—and give none Oc∣casion to the Adversary</HI> to speak reproachfully: <HI>for some are already turned aside after Satan.</HI> And he tells you, Heb. 13. 4. <HI>Marriage is honourable in all, and the Bed undefiled: but Whoremongers &amp; Adul∣terers God will judge.</HI>—Whoremongers, <HI>that is,</HI> Per∣sons in the single Life committing Fornication; and <HI>Adulterers,</HI> i. e. Persons in the marry'd Life committing Impurities with strange Flesh; All such <HI>God will judge:</HI> Either in <HI>this World,</HI> by their own Consciences, bringing them to a bitter Re∣pentance; or by his Providence, bringing them to Shame and Punishment among Men; Or if Im∣penitent, most certainly in <HI>another World,</HI> casting them away from his Presence, to have their Life among unclean Devils for ever.—Hear also that of the Wise Man, Prov. 5. 18.—<HI>Rejoyce with the Wife of thy Youth, and be thou satisfy'd always with her Love. Why wilt thou, my Son, embrace the Bosom of a Stranger? For the Ways of Man are before the Eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his Goings. His own Iniquities shall take the Wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the Cords of his Sins. He shall die without Instruction, &amp; in the greatness of his Folly he shall go astray.</HI>—Surely whoso hath Eyes full of Adultery, lacketh understanding; and every unclean Person sinneth against his own Body; yea,
<PB N="44" REF="003655_0050_10023E1054C38188"/>
they that walk after the Lusts of the Flesh, destroy their own Soul.—Read <HI>Matth.</HI> 5. 27, to 30. and 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 4. 1, to 7. Turn to those Scriptures, and think sadly upon 'em: and cease, my Son, to hear the Instruction, that causeth to err from the Words of Knowledge.</P>
<P N="8">8. Beware of <HI>Intemperance,</HI> Gluttony and Drunkenness.</P>
<P>Intemperance has slain its ten Thousands (per∣haps more than ever the Sword devoured) and has bro't Multitudes even of young Persons to an untimely &amp; miserable End. Hear thou, my Son, and be wise, be not among Wine-bibbers, amongst riotous Eaters of Flesh: for <HI>the Drunkard and the Glutton shall come to Poverty,</HI> be cloathed with Rags, live despis'd, &amp; die in Ignominy. <HI>Who hath Wo? Who hath Sorrow? Who hath Contentions? Who hath Wounds without Cause?</HI> And who <HI>dies before his Time?</HI> None so often as they that tarry long at the Wine; who feast themselves without Fear, and drink without Restraint; whose god is their Belly, and who often make very Beasts of them∣selves by intemperate Cups. They drink and <HI>for∣get the Law;</HI> and lay themselves open to all man∣ner of Temptations, and to all manner of Evils. At such a time they are <HI>as a Man that lieth down in the midst of the Sea, or as he that lieth upon the Top of a Mast;</HI> exposed to the greatest Hazards. And how often do the Intemperate drown them∣selves in Perdition! How often do they come to tragical Ends! Remember what a miserable Exit drunken <HI>Nabal,</HI> that Son of <HI>Belial,</HI> came to and how the Lord slew <HI>Belshazzar</HI> in the Night of his Pleasure, when his Heart had been merry with Wine. And forget not <HI>Elah,</HI> the Son of <HI>Baas<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a,</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="003655_0051_10023DD92064EC48"/>
whom his own Servant conspired against, and slew him <HI>as he was in</HI> Tir<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ah <HI>drinking himself drunk</HI> in the house of his Friend. From these Examples do you take Warning: and put a Knife to thy Throat, if thou art one given to Appetite, a Lover of Wine. <HI>Look not on the Wine,</HI> when it giveth it's pleasing Co∣lour in the Glass: for at last it bites like a Serpent, and stingeth like an Adder. Consider this, and watch, as you wou'd to shun any such venomous Creature.—<HI>Beware</HI> (says our Saviour) <HI>lest at any time your Hearts be overcharg'd with Surfeiting and Drunkenness; and that Day come upon you unawares.</HI> And the Apostle exhorts; <HI>Be not drunk with Wine, wherein is Excess</HI> [Intemperance virtually contains all manner of vile Enormities, and seldom goes a∣lone] <HI>but be ye filled with the Spirit:</HI> This will give you true Joy, Courage, and Vigour; which things you vainly expect that Wine should inspire you with. The Works of the <HI>Flesh</HI> (says he) are ma∣nifest, which are these, <HI>Drunkenness, Revellings, and such like:</HI> of the which I forewarn you, as I have also done in time past, that <HI>they which do such things, shall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</HI> Whereas the Fruit of the <HI>Spirit</HI> is Love, Joy, Peace, Goodness, Faith, Meekness, <HI>Temperance: against which there is no Law,</HI> no Prohibition of God or Man, no Curse or Penalty. But Drunkards are a Reproach among Men, &amp; the Abhorred of the Lord. Hath he not said, <HI>Wo to the Drunkards of Ephraim, whose glorious Beauty is a fading Flower, and as the hasty Fruit before the Summer.</HI> O our Children, be perswaded to refrain from all sensual Excesses: lest that Word be fulfilled in you, as in Myriads of others; <HI>They shall be as the Morning-Cloud that passeth away, as the Chaff that is driven

with a Whirlwind out of the Floor, and as the Smoke out of the Chimney,</HI> which is soon dissipated &amp; dis∣appears.</P>
<P>I add now in the last place under the third general Head,—</P>
<P N="9">9. Beware of <HI>Idleness,</HI> and <HI>evil Fellowship.</HI></P>
<P>These Sins and Snares are seldom separate, and therefore I put 'em together. The one leads to the other, and they both have a pernicious Influ∣ence to draw unwary Youths into a thousand other Snares and Sins.</P>
<P><HI>Idleness,</HI> behold this was the Iniquity of thy Sister <HI>Sodom:</HI> Abundance of Idleness was in her, &amp; in her Sons &amp; Daughters. It is very much a <HI>City</HI>-Sin, and a Sin of <HI>Youth.</HI> The Apostle remarks it of young Persons, <HI>They learn to be idle,</HI> wandring a∣bout from house to house, and not only idle, but <HI>Tatlers also, and Busy-bodies, speaking Things which they ought not.</HI>—Idleness is a common Inlet to many other Sins: it's seldom that those who are idle, are <HI>only</HI> idle: they are at Leasure to attend the <HI>Devil'</HI>s Motions, and often go of his Errands.</P>
<P>Let our young People, whose glory is their strength, be <HI>asham'd</HI> to eat the Bread of Idleness. Some seem to fancy it a piece of <HI>Gentility,</HI> the Sign of a polite Education, to be always at Leasure &amp; above Business; and therefore <HI>affect</HI> an idle Life: But I wou'd mind them of that Passage in the heathen Poet, quoted by the Apostle, <HI>The Cretians are evil Beasts, slew Bellies:</HI> and of that of <HI>Solomon, Go to the Ant, thou Sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:</HI> learn of her to redeem your Time.</P>
<P>And be <HI>afraid,</HI> lest by indulging a Humour for Idleness, which so leads to Wantonness and De∣bauchery, you fall into Reproach, &amp; the <HI>Snare of
<PB N="47" REF="003655_0053_10023E62231304E8"/>
the Devil.</HI> Be not ignorant of his Devices, lest he get an Advantage against you, to draw you on to wretched &amp; <HI>hellish Business,</HI> worse than simple Idle∣ness: and so bring you, with the Sinners of <HI>Sodom,</HI> to a miserable End before your time. O fear, lest with the slothful and unprofitable Servant, you be doom'd at last to be bound hand and foot, &amp; cast into the Dungeon of Hell.</P>
<P>Beware also of <HI>bad Company-keeping.</HI> Take Care how you contract unnecessary friendship and intimacy or partnership with vain Persons, lest you get a Snare to your Soul, &amp; learn their Ways; be inticed into Sin, and harden'd in Vice, by evil Counsels &amp; ill Examples: which have a peculiar force upon the giddy tho'tless Age of Childhood and Youth. He that walketh with the Wise, shall be wise: but <HI>a Companion of Fools shall be destroy'd;</HI> his religious Principles shock'd, his Virtue ruin'd, his Honour lost, &amp; his Estate consum'd, his Life perhaps cut short, &amp; which is worse, his Soul undone for ever. For how naturally does evil &amp; foolish Company lead to and cherish the Vices of Idle∣ness &amp; Extravagance, of Gaming, and Drinking, and Whoring? And how inevitably do these things work Death and Misery, to Body &amp; Soul! Will you not then, my Children, <HI>forsake the Foolish, and live.</HI> Depart, I pray you, from the Tents of these wicked Men, <HI>lest ye be consumed in all their Sins.</HI> O save your selves from this untoward, this adulterous &amp; voluptuous Generation.</P>
<P>Enter not into the path of the Wicked: avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, &amp; pass away. Let our young Women remember what came of un∣happy <HI>Dinah'</HI>s Gadding, when <HI>she went out to see the Daughters of the Land,</HI> to get Acquaintance with
<PB N="48" REF="003655_0054_10023E42B3309958"/>
the <HI>Canaanites;</HI> and take Warning, that Diversion and Company do not betray you into the Snares of Lust and Folly. The Apostle wou'd have the young women taught to be <HI>sober, discreet, Chast, Keepers at home, that the word of God be not blasphe∣med.</HI>—And let our young Men be admonish'd and take Warning from the tremendous Example of <HI>Ahaziah</HI> (the Son of <HI>Jehoshaphat</HI>) who was ruin'd by ungodly Company. It's said of him, <HI>He did Evil in the sight of the Lord, like the house of</HI> Ahab;<HI>for they were his Counsellers, after the death of his Father, unto his Destruction.</HI></P>
<P>Dear Children, if you would not have your <HI>Souls gather'd with Sinners</HI> in another World, abhor and fly their Company in this. <HI>Come out from a∣mong them, saith the Lord, &amp; be ye separate, i. e.</HI> in respect of Affection, Imitation, &amp; familiar Society: <HI>and I will receive you, and ye shall be my Sons and Daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.</HI></P>
<P>We proceed now to the other general Head of Caution.</P>
<P N="4">4. Beware of carnal <HI>Security,</HI> and <HI>Hypocrisy;</HI> of indulging any Sins under the notion of their be∣ing <HI>Little,</HI> &amp; of living in <HI>secret</HI> Sins under a Cloke of visible Religion &amp; external Sobriety.</P>
<P>Beware of sottish <HI>Security,</HI> and of every thing that tends to nourish spiritual Sloth, a Fearlesness of Death and Hell, and a Presumptuous Hope of Heaven; lest if God should <HI>take you away with his Stroke,</HI> you be found in a Christless graceless Con∣dition, and have your future <HI>Life among the Un∣clean.</HI> O beware of flattering yourselves in your own Eyes, and deceiving your Souls by resting in a dead Faith, a legal Repentance, &amp; unregenerate Morality; in a partial Reformation of Manners;
<PB N="49" REF="003655_0055_10023E7D9D3D1798"/>
in a formal Round of religious Duties; in a Spirit of Bigottry for certain Superstitions, or an empty noisy Zeal for Divine Institutions: as if such things intitled you to the favour of God, and would engage the Protection &amp; Smiles of Heaven upon you.—Be∣ware of imbibing loose Principles in Religion, or taking up light Thoughts of Sin: beware of indul∣ging a vain Dependence on pious Parentage and Covenant-Privileges; or a proud Conceit of your own Sufficiency, and Self-Righteousness; or un∣dervaluing Tho'ts of spiritual Blessings, &amp; an im∣moderate Opinion of this present World; or the fond Dream of a long Life on Earth:—Which things are often the fatal Impediments to Sinners Conversion, the Means of their hardning now, and perishing hereafter. God hath denounced, <HI>WO to them that are at Ease in</HI> Zion. <HI>Let us then not sleep, as do others,</HI> lest God awaken us with the Terrors of his Indignation; lest sudden Destruction arise, and break in upon us, as upon <HI>Laish,</HI> a Peo∣ple that were secure, &amp; dwelt carelesly: or as on the Sinners of the Old World, who knew not till the Flood came &amp; destroy'd them.</P>
<P>Beware of indulging yourselves in seemingly <HI>little</HI> Follies. No Sin indeed is absolutely little: but it's one Wile of the Devil to tempt unto some Sins by a pretence of their being small ones; and hereby he deceives many Souls into Ruin. But consider, the least Sin indulged tends to harden the Heart, is malignant in its Nature, and is pro∣voking to God; who often in righteous Displea∣sure gives Men up, when they will not be reform'd, to commit greater Sins, heinous Crimes, with the same Security. O then resist every Lust in its smallest Beginnings, and never allow yourselves,
<PB N="50" REF="003655_0056_10023DFC0F876338"/>
as the manner of some is, to live in any Sin under a vain Imagination of its being a little venial In∣firmity, that may safely be indulg'd.</P>
<P>And beware you be not tempted to commit grosser Sins by the delusive hope of <HI>Secrecy:</HI> which is another hellish Snare, by which Satan captivates Multitudes, especially of young People. <HI>It is a shame</HI> (as the Apostle observes) <HI>even to speak of those things that are done of them in Secret;</HI> even by many, who in the open Light and View of the World appear virtuous and modest. But beware, young ones, lest that Word be fulfilled in you; <HI>The Iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his Sin is hid: The Sorrows of a travelling Woman shall come upon him; he is an unwise Son.</HI> Take heed, for Instance, that you do not <HI>dishonour your own Bodies</HI> by un∣natural &amp; impure Abuses; lest from <HI>solitary</HI> Filthi∣ness you be left to pass on unto <HI>social;</HI> and from secret <HI>Fornications</HI> to secret <HI>Murders;</HI> and at length come to an untimely &amp; shameful Death.—Let it be consider'd; Secret Sins bewray the dreadful <HI>A∣theism</HI> of your Minds; and when cover'd over with a specious Shew of Piety, argue the wretched <HI>Hy∣pocrisy</HI> of your Profession. These secret Sins have a fatal Tendency in their nature, by blinding and searing the Conscience: and as they are a practical denying of the God that is above, whose Eyes pierce into the darkest Corner, and who re∣vealeth secrets, <HI>such</HI> Sins are a high Provocation to him, to call away his striving Spirit, &amp; take off the Restraints of common Grace; the inevitable fruit of which is the Sinner's growing bold in Sin, and his Corruptions breaking forth into heinous Crimes In a holy Indignation at that Atheism and that Hypocrisy, the <HI>secret Sinner</HI> is guilty of,
<PB N="51" REF="003655_0057_10023E452F566498"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> often leaves him to turn a <HI>scandalous Apostate;</HI> gives him up to work all Uncleanness with Gree∣diness; and sometimes leaves him to fall into ca∣pital Crimes, <HI>Iniquities to be punish'd by the Judge.</HI>—Beware then of secret Sins; of Pilfering &amp; secret Frauds &amp; Falshoods, of secret Impurities, of secret Profanities: lest a provoked God lay open your Sin before the World to your shameful Confusion, and avenge the Quarrel of his holy Covenant upon you, by terrible Things in Righteousness, in the or∣dinary Course of his Providence; or else smite you for your horrible Hypocrisy by his immediate Hand, as he did <HI>Ananias</HI> &amp; <HI>Sapphira.</HI>—It was our Savi∣our's repeated Caution to his Disciples, <HI>Beware of Hypocrisy. Beware ye of the Leaven of the</HI> Pharisees, <HI>which is Hypocrisy: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known</HI> Whatsoever ye have spoken or done in <HI>Darkness,</HI> shall appear in the <HI>Light;</HI> and that which ye have said or done in the <HI>Closet,</HI> shall be proclaim∣ed upon the <HI>House-Top.</HI>—It was a terrible Word to <HI>David,</HI> from the Mouth of the Lord, after he had sinned in the matter of <HI>Uriah;</HI> Behold, I will raise up Evil against thee: <HI>thou didst it secretly; but I will do this Thing before all Israel, &amp; before the Sun.</HI> And if even good Men may have their se∣cret Sins &amp; Hypocrisies thus expos'd &amp; punish'd; What will a Heart-searching and Sin-hating God do to false Professors, under the reigning power of Hypocrisy! What will he do to a <HI>Saul,</HI> that boasts of his Obedience, &amp; yet spares an <HI>Agag,</HI> and saves the Fatlings under a shew of Sacrificing to the Lord!—What, to an <HI>Absalom,</HI> that under the pretext of Vows &amp; Devotions, is only pursuing dark Designs of Ambition &amp; Rebellion! To a <HI>Jehu,</HI> that
<PB N="52" REF="003655_0058_10023E487AD07908"/>
boasts a Zeal for the Lord, only to colour over in∣trigues of Malice &amp; Envy! To a <HI>Judas,</HI> that betrays his Lord with a Kiss, &amp; is secretly a Thief under a Cloak of Compassion to the Poor!—Surely, as is said in the Verse preceeding my Text, <HI>The Hypo∣crites in Heart heap up Wrath:</HI> hence no Wonder it follows, <HI>They die in Youth, and their</HI> future <HI>Life is among the Unclean.</HI></P>
<P>Take Heed then lest there be in any of you an evil Heart of Unbelief, cover'd with specious Shews of Piety &amp; Virtue. Fear lest it be said to you at last, as to the Young Man in the Gospel, <HI>One thing thou lackest.</HI> O mind Religion in Earnest. See that you have <HI>Truth in the inward Parts;</HI> and so remember now your Creator in the days of your Youth, as that you may escape those <HI>evil Days</HI> of Wrath, which carnal Hypocrites must &amp; shall see, either in this or in a worse World.</P>
<P>USE VI. Let it be a Word of Exhortation to <HI>such</HI> of our <HI>Young</HI> People, as have <HI>already</HI> commit∣ted horrible <HI>Evils,</HI> &amp; been walking after their own Lusts in the Paths of the Destroyer: O <HI>repent</HI> and <HI>turn ye now,</HI> lest a Sin-revenging God <HI>take you away with his Stroke,</HI> &amp; thrust you down to Hell <HI>among the Unclean,</HI> without a Remedy.</P>
<P>It may be some of you have dreadfully polluted your Youth with the grossest Vices, even with <HI>Ca∣pital</HI> Crimes; which, had the Eye of Man seen them, &amp; Justice been done you, would have bro't you to be <HI>hung up before the Lord.</HI> O admire the Divine Forbearance toward you: and hasten your Repentance &amp; Reformation, lest your <HI>Iniquity find you out,</HI> &amp; bring you to <HI>Die before your time.</HI>—You have perhaps already felt something of God's
<PB N="53" REF="003655_0059_10023E55019A9560"/>
Wrath, in Afflictions, or in Terrors of Conscience: O <HI>sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto you:</HI> Even that, <HI>God shall cast upon him, &amp; not spare: Men shall clap their hands at him, &amp; hiss him out of his place.</HI> You are ready, it may be, to say as <HI>Agag,</HI> when <HI>Saul</HI> had repriev'd him, <HI>Surely the Bitterness of Death is past:</HI> But take heed, lest in a little time, like that unhappy Man, you be <HI>hewed in pieces before the Lord.</HI> I pray you, read &amp; ponder upon those awful Scriptures, <HI>Eccl.</HI> 11. 9. <HI>Prov.</HI> 29. 1. and <HI>Deut.</HI> 29. 19, 20. with <HI>Psal.</HI> 50. 16, to 22.</P>
<P>However, thro' the Grace of God, there is yet Room for Hope of a Pardon upon your Repent∣ance: and those are the compassionate Calls from Heaven to you this day, <HI>Turn &amp; live; turn ye, turn ye; why will ye die!—Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the Way.—Acquaint now thy self with him; thereby Good shall come unto thee.—Turn you at my Reproof; Behold, I will pour out my Spirit upon you.—Ask and it shall be given you.</HI></P>
<P>O Cry then to a merciful God, that he wou'd give you his holy Spirit, to renew you, unto saving Re∣pentance &amp; Faith. Plead with him your absolute Necessity, the Merits of Christ, &amp; the Glory of Di∣vine Grace. And be frequent in your Essays of active Conversion, with an intire dependence on a supernatural Power to effect it. O try, try to <HI>stretch out the withered Arm. Strive to enter in at the strait Gate.</HI> And never give over your Prayers and Efforts, until you happily experience a sensible Energy of the holy Spirit upon your Heart, working in you Repentance toward God &amp; Faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.—And so, being justify'd by Faith in his Righteousness, you shall have Peace with God in this World, and Life eternal in the next.</P>

I wou'd now (as doubtless it is expected from the I shou'd) apply the Exhortation more particularly to the unhappy <HI>Condemned Woman,</HI> at this time in the Presence of God with us, and in a few days to be cut off from among the Living.</P>
<P>Hearken, O Woman, to the Word of the Lord, and let it sink down into your Ears. Hear, and your Soul shall live. O seek the Lord, while he may be found: call upon him, while he is near. You have had your <HI>Life among the Unclean</HI> (I speak it not with any De∣light to upbraid you; for we pity and mourn for you: but still in Faithfulness we admonish you) and for your being wicked overmuch you are to <HI>die in Youth,</HI> to die before your time. O tremble and be afraid, lest also in the coming World your <HI>Life be among the Unclean,</HI> even among filthy Devils in the burning Lake.</P>
<P>Surely it becomes you to <HI>look back</HI> on your <HI>past Life</HI> with the deepest Shame and Regret. Has not that word been fulfilled in you, 1 Tim 5 6. <HI>She that liveth in Pleasure▪ is dead while she liveth!</HI> O reflect with Grief and Blushing on all your Gratifications of fleshly Lusts: and consider your Sins in all their <HI>aggravating</HI> Circumstances; as committed against the Light of Na∣ture and the known Commands of God in holy Scrip∣ture; against the Advantages of a pious Education; a∣gainst the Bonds of holy Baptism and a personal Pro∣fession of Religion; against the Warnings of Provi∣dence, and Checks of the Holy Spirit; against your own repeated Vows and Resolutions, the Reproofs of Friends, and the Calls and Admonitions of the Word of Christ; against the Riches of Divine Goodness and Pa∣tience, the Bounty of the Creator, and the Mercies of the Redeemer.—O look upon your Sins in all these and other their Aggravations: Realise the infinite Evil of <HI>all Sin,</HI> as it dishonours and displeases God, as well as wrongs the Soul of Man; and see the dreadful Ma∣lignity of <HI>your own</HI> Sins in particular, which have been very heinous in their Nature, and the Guilt of them amazingly heighten'd by the Circumstances attending them. Of your self guilty and polluted, exceeding∣ly so; and while you meditate your Sinfulness, let not
<PB N="55" REF="003655_0061_10023E12B8643FB0"/>
your Thoughts stop at external Life and Practice, but carry them up to the black Original, and see the secret Springs of all in an apostate guilty State of Soul, as you are a Child of fallen <HI>Adam.</HI> (<HI>Psal</HI> 51. 5.) O see how guilty you are by Nature &amp; Practice; and loath your self in your own Sight, repenting in Dust and Ashes.</P>
<P>When you consider the <HI>deplorable Condition</HI> Sin has reduced you to, surely you cannot but blush and tremble. I may say to you, as in <HI>Jer.</HI> 2. 17, &amp; 19 <HI>Hast thou not procured this unto thy self, in that thou hast for∣saken the Lord thy God? Know therefore and see, that it is an evil thing &amp; bitter, that thou hast forsaken the Lord.</HI> I may appeal to you, as in Rom. 6. 21. <HI>What Fruit had you in those things, whereof you are now ashamed? For the End of those things is Death</HI>—Thou hast consulted Shame to thy House, &amp; sinned against thine own Soul. Thou hast sinned away thy precious Life; and hast found by doleful Experience (as to Ruin for this World) the Truth of those awful Threatnings, <HI>A Companion of Fools shall be destroy'd;</HI> And <HI>Whoso pursueth Evil, pursueth it to his own Death.</HI> O adore the Patience of a merciful God, who has long been waiting that he might be gra∣cious. You may well wonder, when you call to mind your crying Sins, and abuses of the Divine Patience, that a provoked God did not by his own immediate Hand <HI>cut you off with a Stroke,</HI> in the acting of your Abomi∣nations. Give him the glory of his sparing Goodness; and affect your Heart with Reflections upon it, that you may thereby be <HI>led to Repentance.</HI> Acknowledge the <HI>Justice</HI> of God (as also of Man) in bringing you into your present Circumstances of Shame and Misery: and <HI>accept the Punishment of your Iniquity,</HI> without murmur∣ing against Man, or repining against God, whose over∣ruling Hand has been signally evident in bringing out your Guilt and a Sentence of Death against you—Yet you've Reason to stand amaz'd at the <HI>Mercy</HI> of God in laying an Arrest upon you, and stopping you in your Carreer to Hell; tho' it was by so dreadful Means. O beg that it may prove indeed in Mercy to you, &amp; turn to your eternal Salvation. O that that Word may be fulfil∣led in you: that wonderful Word, in our Context,

Job 36. 8, &amp;c <HI>If they be bound in Fetters, &amp; holden in Cords of Affliction; then GOD sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded. He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they re∣turn from iniquity.</HI> God has been indulging you (tho' under terrible outward Circumstances) with a precious Season of Grace; such as he has deny'd to Thousands of others, no worse Sinners than you: O take heed that you improve aright your short remaining Opportunity; lest that be your Condemnation from the Mouth of your just and holy Judge, when you (as in a little time you must) appear before his dread Tribunal, Rev. 2. 21, 22. <HI>I gave her a Space to repent of her Fornication, and she repented not: Behold, I will cast her into a Bed</HI> Ah! not a Bed of Lust and Pleasure, but of Travail &amp; Pain, a Bed of Fire &amp; Torment, without Deliverance for ever.</P>
<P>O with what Concern of Soul, with what Anxi∣ety and Fear, does it become you to be looking for∣ward to that <HI>eternal World</HI> you are hastning into! With what Diligence, with what awaken'd Applica∣tion of your whole Thought and Heart, should you be getting ready to die: since <HI>the Time is short,</HI> and the <HI>Work great</HI> and difficult, and unless <HI>now</HI> done, must ever remain <HI>undone,</HI> and your Soul lost without a Remedy. O fear and tremble, lest when the fatal <HI>Stroke</HI> is given, you perish under the Wrath of an <HI>unreconciled</HI> God, and with your Lusts <HI>unmortify'd</HI> go down to Hell, to have your Life for ever among unclean Spirits, and amidst Flames never to be quenched. Unhappy Crea∣ture, take heed, lest from <HI>hopes of Heaven</HI> you fall into the <HI>Flames of Hell,</HI>▪ without Recovery! I say not this, un∣necessarily to terrify you, but out of a tender Com∣passion to your Soul; I would perswade you by the Terrors of the Lord, to beware you do not put a fa∣tal Cheat upon your self by a presumptuous and delu∣sive Confidence of the good Estate of your Soul. It is a great Truth, <HI>Tho' genuine sincere Repentance be never too late, yet late Repentance is seldom sincere and genuine;</HI> is seldom free, and resulting from Evangelical Princi∣ples, but commonly forc'd and legal, no better than the Repentance of <HI>Judas.</HI> And the <HI>sudden Hopes</HI> of

late Penitents are therefore very <HI>warily</HI> to be encou∣rag'd. We are sure from the Word of God, there are many that rest their Souls on a false Bottom, which in the Storms of Death and Judgment▪ fail and sink from under them. Some self-deceiving Hypocrites, it may be, hold their Confidence to the End, and have no Bands in their Death; they die secure of Heaven in their own Conceit: but alas! to their dreadful Dis∣appointment receive that Doom, <HI>Depart from me, I know you not.</HI>—Will you therefore, O Daughter of Death, be jealous over yourself, and fear lest you should be de∣ceiv'd by rash Hopes into eternal Despair. You have formerly had your Convictions, which wro't some good Effects upon you: but in time they utterly wore off, and you return'd to Folly. And how know you that <HI>now</HI> you have any <HI>better Work</HI> wro't on you, than was <HI>then!</HI> O cry to God, that <HI>he wou'd search you;</HI> that he would open your State in a true Light before you, and save you from miscarrying in Conversion by undoing Mistakes. And be <HI>you</HI> very much in solemn <HI>Self-Examination</HI> day and night. <HI>Commune with your own Heart,</HI> and make diligent search into the State of your Soul: taking Heed, that you do not <HI>try</HI> your self by <HI>false Rules,</HI> nor <HI>rashly</HI> conclude by <HI>hopeful Signs.</HI> You may (in a sense) be in Charity with all Men, &amp; seem to love God; may have at times your Affections in Duty, your Convictions of Sin, your good Resolutions, your earnest Prayers, and your Hopes of Heaven too: but know it, for a sad Truth, <HI>Every Grace has it's Counterseit,</HI> and Satan often subtil∣ly imposes upon the unwary Sinner, drawing him into rash Conclusions of his good Estate by <HI>deceiving Ap∣pearances</HI> of Grace in Exercise. Read and tremble at that Scripture, <HI>Luk.</HI> 11. 24, 25, 26. The Parable of the <HI>unclean Spirit going out,</HI> &amp;c.

Work of Conversion, nothing short of the Washing of Regeneration, will stand you in any stead, when you come to die, &amp; appear before the Judgment Seat of Christ. Think solemnly of those Words of Christ, your Judge (I commend them particularly to your Consideration) and look upon 'em as spoken to you, Joh. 13 8 <HI>If I wash thee not, thou hast no Part with me.</HI> O Realise the Necessity of your being <HI>washed</HI> (that is, sanctify'd and justify'd) <HI>by Christ:</HI> and go to Christ by unceasing Prayer, begging that He would bestow this spiritual Washing upon you; that He would wash you from your Sins with his own Blood; that he would by his holy Spirit cleanse you from all your Filthiness, and purge your Conscience from dead Works, to serve the living God, the few days you have to tarry in this World, and to make you meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light. <HI>Believest thou that he is able to do this great thing for thee?</HI> O hear him calling to you, as in Hos. 13. 9. <HI>Thou hast destroyed thy self, but in me is thy Help.</HI> Hear him inviting you, as in Isa. 45 22. <HI>Look unto Me, and be saved.</HI> O then be thou <HI>looking unto JESUS,</HI> a once crucify'd, and now glorify'd Jesus. <HI>Look to him, whom you've pierced</HI> by your Sins, <HI>and mourn as</HI> a Woman <HI>for the</HI> Loss of <HI>her first born.</HI> Look unto him, as the Lord your Righteousness and your Strength: and fly for Re∣fuge to him: <HI>Blessed are all they, that</HI> with Faith un∣feigned <HI>put their Trust in Him</HI> See that you trust not in your Tears &amp; Sorrows, Confessions and Resolutions; they can't atone for Sin, nor cleanse the Soul 'Tis only the Blood of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ, that can do this. And lo, his <HI>Grace is sufficient</HI> for the chief of Sin∣ners. Read (both for your Awakening &amp; Encourage∣ment) 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6. 9, 10, 11—O put in for a Share in the Benefit of that precious Blood, which cleanses from all Sin, and has wash'd some of the foulest Sinners whiter than the Snow. <HI>Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> and according to his Mercy he will save you. Yet this you can't do as of yourself: You must be begotten to it by the Spirit of Christ. O beg, and cease not begging at the Throne of Grace, for an Experience of the New Birth.—And know it, if you are born of the Spirit,
<PB N="59" REF="003655_0065_10023E230F73FE60"/>
you shall certainly see the Kingdom of Heaven: if Christ wash you here, you shall partake with him in Glory for ever.—I shall only add, tho' you may be well asham'd to meet Death in those inglorious Circum∣stances, in which you are to die; yet remember, that just one the Lord Jesus Christ himself, was hanged on a Tree, died an accursed Death, not indeed for his own Sins, but for the Sins of his People: and so has sanctify'd all manner of Deaths, even the most ignominious, to them which believe on his Name. O be looking to Jesus, by an Eye of Faith: and so doing, you may <HI>lift up your Head,</HI> at the Approach of Death in its most hideous Shape and infamous Circumstances, with a humble hope of finding Mercy with him, thro' whose Mercy <HI>Rahab</HI> the Harlot perish'd not, and thro' whose Mercy <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> had her many Sins forgiven her.—O give Glory to the Lord, before you die, by making Confession to God, and giving Warnings to Men. Be unto the last committing your Soul, your never dying Soul, into the hands of a merciful Saviour, <HI>who knows how to have Compassion</HI> upon the Ignorant and the Unworthy.</P>
<P>We have been praying for you, and shall not cease doing it, so long as you are a Subject of Prayer; That Christ would receive your Spirit into his Custody and Presence, into his Kingdom of Grace here and of Glory hereafter.</P>
<P>With Tears and Prayers and Faith unfeigned <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> your own Soul to Christ continually: Live and die calling upon God, and saying, <HI>Lord Jesus, receive my Spirit.</HI>—And we pray God have Mercy on your Soul!</P>

<HI>I now turn me to the</HI> Congregation <HI>in a short Address on this affecting Occasion.</HI></P>
<P>O let us see to it that we sanctify the Lord in such amazing Dispensations. The sorrowful Spec∣tacle before us should make us all reflect most seriously on <HI>our own</HI> vile Nature; which the Falls of others are but a Comment upon: and should excite us to humble ourselves under a sense of the Corruption of <HI>our Hearts,</HI> which are naturally as bad as the worst. <HI>Matth.</HI> 15. 19—Let us admire the restraining Grace of God, whereby we have deen distinguish'd. Let us take Warning, &amp; tho' now we think we stand, let us take heed lest we fall. God in his Judgments upon others sounds in our Ears an awful Alarm, in such Language as that, Luk 13. 4, 5. <HI>Think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem? I tell you nay; but except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.</HI> Sinners cut off by divine Judgments are design'd as Ex∣amples (<HI>Jude</HI> 5, 6, 7.) not for Imitation, but Cau∣tion &amp; Admonition. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10. 6, 11, 12.—The <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> holy Severity against <HI>Jezebel,</HI> and her adulterous Lovers, is for Instruction to all the Churches, <HI>Rev.</HI> 2. 22, 23. So Christ warns Us, Luk. 17. 32. <HI>Remember Lot's Wife.</HI>—God has appointed the Execution of Justice on capital Offenders, with this View, that they may be Ensamples and Warn∣ings unto others, to deter them from the like Sins. (<HI>Deut.</HI> 17. 12, 13.) Smite a Scorner, says <HI>Solomon,</HI> and <HI>the Simple will beware. The Righteous shall see the Fall of the Wicked,</HI> and adore God's Goodness to themselves, his rectoral Holiness &amp; Faithfulness to his Threatnings, learn Humility, and receive Instruction: and Sinners should hear fear and do no more so wickedly.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="003655_0067_10023E18836A0600"/>
In the present Case, the Warning of Providence is particularly pointed to the DAUGHTERS of <HI>Zion.</HI> The loud Call of God to you is in that Language, Isa. 32. 9, 11. <HI>Rise up, ye women that are at ease, hear my voice, ye careless daughters, give ear unto my speech. Tremble, ye women that are at ease, be troubled ye careless ones: strip ye and make ye bare, and gird sackcloth on your loyns.</HI> O let it not be complain'd of any of you, as in Isa. 47. 7. <HI>Thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: so that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart, neither didst remember the latter end thereof.</HI> Your Obstinacy in evil Courses, after such awful Warnings, will ag∣gravate the Sorrow of your anxious Friends, and be an humbling Consideration to us your Ministers. 2 Cor. 12. 21. <HI>I fear lest when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many that have sinned already, and have not repent∣ed of the uncleanness, and fornication, and lascivious∣ness which they have committed.</HI> But what should most of all affect you is, that you will greatly pro∣voke God, by disappointing his just Expecta<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>.

So the Providence is expounded, Ezek. 23. 48. <HI>Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all Women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.</HI>—O that this may be the blessed Effect! And that we may see the Fulfilling of that, Isa. 4. 4, 5. <HI>When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion,</HI>—He will create upon every dwelling place a Cloud by day, &amp; a Fire by night: for upon all the Glory there shall be a Defence.</P>

<HEAD>The Declaration, DYING Warnings and Advice OF Rebekah Chamblit, A Young Woman aged near Twenty-seven Years, Executed at Boston, September 27th. 1733.</HEAD>
<P>BEING under the awful Apprehensions of my Executi∣on now in a few Hours; and being desirous to do all the Good I can, before I enter the Eternal World, I now in the fear of GOD, give this Declaration and Warning to the Living.</P>
<P>I Was very tenderly brought up, and well Instructed in my Father's House, till I was Twelve Years of Age; but a∣lass, my Childhood wore off in vanity. However, as I grew in Years, my Youth was under very sensible Impressions from the SPIRIT of GOD; and I was awakened to seek and obtain Baptism, when I was about Sixteen Years of Age; and lived for some time with a strictness somewhat answerable to the Obligations I was thereby brought under. But within two or three Years after this, I was led away into the Sin of Un∣cleanness, from which time I think I may date my Ruin for this World. After this, I became again more watchful, and for several Years kept my self from the like Pollutions, until those for which I am now to suffer.</P>
<P>And as it may be necessary, so doubtless it will be expected of me, that I give the World a particular account of that great Sin, with the aggravations of it, which has brought me to this Shameful Death: And accordingly in the fear of GOD, at whose awful Tribunal I am immediately to appear, I solemnly de∣clare as follows;</P>
<P><PB REF="003655_0076_10023E32E3531F10"/>
That on Saturday the Fifth Day of <HI>May</HI> last, being then something more than Eight Months gone with Child, as I was about my Houshold Business reaching some Sand from out of a large Cask, I received considerable hurt, which put me into great Pain, and so I continued till the Tuesday following; in all which time I am not sensible I felt any Life or Motion in the Child within me; when, on the said Tuesday the Eighth Day of <HI>May,</HI> I was Deliver'd when alone of a Male Infant; in whom I did not perceive Life; but still uncertain of Life in it, I threw it into the Vault about two or three Minutes after it was born; <HI>uncertain</HI> I say, whether it was a living or dead Child; tho', I confess its probable there was Life in it, and some Cir∣cumstances seem to confirm it. I therefore own the Justice of GOD and Man in my Condemnation, and take Shame to my self, as I have none but my self to Blame; and am sorry for any rash Expressions I have at any time uttered since my Condem∣nation; and I am verily perswaded there is no Place in the World, where there is a more strict regard to Justice than in this Province.</P>
<P>And now as a Soul going into Eternity, I most earnestly and solemnly Warn all Persons, particularly YOUNG PEOPLE, and more especially those of my own Sex, against the Sins which their Age peculiarly exposes them to; and as the Sin of Un∣cleanness has brought me into these distressing Circumstances, I would with the greatest Importunity Caution and Warn a∣gainst it, being perswaded of the abounding of that Sin in this Town and Land. I thought my self as secure, a little more than a Year ago, as many of you now do; but by woful Expe∣rience I have found, that Lust when it has conceived bringeth forth Sin, and Sin when it is finished bringeth forth Death; it exposes the Soul not only to Temporal, but to Eternal Death. And therefore as a Dying Person, let me call upon you to forsake the foolish and live: Do not accompany with those you know to be such, and if Sinners entice you do not consent. I am sen∣sible there are many Houses in this Town, that may be called Houses of Uncleanness, and Places of dreadful Temptations to this and all other Sins. O shun them, for they lead down to the Chambers of Death and Eternal Misery.</P>
<P>My mispending of precious Sabbaths, lies as a heavy burden upon me; that when I might have gone to the House of GOD, I have been <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>different, and suffer'd a small matter to keep me from it. What would I wow give, had I better improv'd the Lord's Day. I tell you, verily, your lost Sabbaths will sit hea∣vy
<PB REF="003655_0077_10023E2A6CD80AA0"/>
upon you, when you come into the near prospect of Death and Eternity.</P>
<P>The Sin of Lying I have to bewail, and wou'd earnestly cau∣tion against; not that I have took so great a pleasure in Lying; but I have often done so to conceal my Sin: Certainly you had better suffer Shame and Disgrace, yea the greatest Punishment, than to hide and conceal your Sin, by Lying. How much bet∣ter had it been for me, to have confess'd my Sin, than by hid∣ing of it to provoke a holy GOD, thus to suffer it to find me out! But I hope I heartily desire to bless GOD, that even in this way, He is thus entring into Judgment with me; for I have often thought, had I been let alone to go on undiscovered in my Sins, I might have provok'd Him to leave me to a course of Rebellion, that would have ripen'd me for a more sudden and everlasting Destruction; and am fully convinc'd of this, that I should have had no solid ease or quiet in my mind, but the Guilt of this undiscover'd Sin lying upon my Conscience, would have been a tormenting Rack unto me all my Days; whereas now I hope GOD has discover'd to me in some measure the evil of this, and all my other Sins, and enabled me to repent of them in Dust and Ashes; and made me earnestly desire and plead with Him for pardon and cleansing in the precious Blood of the REDEEMER of lost and perishing Sinners: And I think I can say, I have had more comfort and satisfaction within the Walls of this Prison, than ever I had in the ways of Sin among my vain Companions, and think I wou'd not for a World, nay for ten Thousand Worlds have my liberty in Sin again, and be in the same Condition I was in before I came into this Place.</P>
<P>I had the advantage of living in several religious Families: but alass, I disregarded the Instructions and Warnings I there had, which is now a bitterness to me; and so it will be to those of you who are thus favoured, but go on unmindful of GOD, and deaf to all the Reproofs and Admonitions that are given you for the good of your Souls. And I would advise those of my own Sex especially, to chuse to go into religious Families, where the Worship and Fear of GOD is maintained, and submit your selves to the Orders and Government of them.</P>
<P>In my younger Years I maintain'd a constant course of Se∣cret Prayer for some time; but afterwards neglecting the same, I found by experience, that upon my thus leaving GOD, He was provoked to forsake me, and at length suffer'd me to fall into that great and complicated Sin that has <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> this
<PB REF="003655_0078_10023DE90983B310"/>
Death: Mind me, I first left GOD, and then he left me: I therefore solemnly call upon YOUNG PEOPLE to cherish the Convictions of GOD's Holy SPIRIT, and be sure keep up a constant course of fervent Secret Prayer.</P>
<P>And now I am just entring into the Eternal World, I do in the fear of GOD, and before Witnesses, call upon our YOUNG PEOPLE in particular, to secure an Interest in the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and in those precious Benefits He has purchased for His People; for surely the favour of GOD, thro' CHRIST, is more worth than a whole World: And O what Comfort will this yield you when you come to that awful Day and Hour I am now arriving unto. I must tell you, the World appears to me vain and empty, nothing like what it did in my past Life, my Days of Sin and Vanity, and as doubtless it appears now to you. Will you be perswaded by me to that which will yield you the best Satisfaction and Pleasure here, and which will prepare you for the more abundant Pleasures of GOD's Right Hand for evermore?</P>
