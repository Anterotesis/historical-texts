<HEAD>After DEATH, the JUDGMENT.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>1. PETER IV. 5.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>WHO shall give Account to him that is ready to judge the Quick and the Dead.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Lord Jesus Christ is the best, and most perfect Pattern, most worthy of Imitation; he that saith, he abideth in him, ought also so to walk, as he walk∣ed, 1 <HI>John</HI> ii. 6</P>
<P>Wherefore the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> having in the for∣mer Chapter exhorted Believers to patient bear∣ing Afflictions by the Example of Christ, <HI>Ver.</HI> 18. He proceeds in this to perswade them to improve the Cross they have outwardly, to inward Mortifi∣cation. Christ's Death is proposed to us in Scrip∣ture as an Examplar both of external Mortification
<PB N="2" REF="004230_0004_1004243236D1B8D0"/>
in bearing Reproaches, Persecution, and all other Troubles; this the Apostle prosecutes in the for∣mer Chapter, and of internal in the destroying the Body of Sin; this he exhorts to in this Chapter, and draws his Argument from Christ's Death, not only as the Examplar, but efficient and meritori∣ous Cause of our Mortification, and which hath a real Influence upon it, in that Christ by his Death did not only merit the Pardon of Sin, but the gi∣ving the Spirit, whereby Corruption might be destroyed, and our Natures renewed. And being armed with this Mind, that we being dead with Christ to Sin, should not live any longer in it, or be seduced by the corrupt Desires, and sinful Ways of carnal Men, and make them the Rule of our Living: But the holy Will of God revealed in his Word, (which is the Rule by which we ought to walk) in Opposition to the Lusts of Men, we are to live not as Men would have us, but as God commands. Since every one of us shall give an Account, whether he be high or low, rich or poor, great or small, strong or weak, &amp;c. Of himself, of his own Actions, and not another's; he shall give an Account of himself in his natural Capacity, as a Man, and in his Capacity as a rich or great Man, and in his religious Capacity, as one that hath enjoyed such Education, such Means of Grace, &amp;c. I say with the Apostle in my Text, <HI>He shall give Account to him that is ready to judge the Quick and the Dead.</HI> Give Account, i.e. come to a Reckoning, and answer for his Offices, Relations and Behaviour in the World <HI>To him,</HI> i. e. to God and Christ <HI>That is ready,</HI> i. e. fit, prepared, well furnished and near at hand. <HI>To judge,</HI> &amp;c. i. e. to pronounce a righteous and true Sentence upon all Things and Persons.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="004230_0005_1004023009FD9A18"/>
From this Text, thus briefly opened, we observe the following Doctrine: Namely,</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCT. That it is a Matter of the highest Con∣cernment and Importance to Men, to be ready to give Account to him that is ready to judge the Quick and the Dead.</HEAD>
<P>That the Judge of all Things and Persons stands ready to call all Men to a strict Account of all their Actions and Deportments in this World, is undoubtedly true. The Apostle <HI>James</HI> witnes∣eth, Chap. v. Ver. 9. <HI>Grudge not one against ano∣ther, Brethren, lest ye be condemned: Behold, the Judge standeth before the Door:</HI> i. e. He is in a Readiness to bring those Evils upon Men, which they wish may fall upon others; or to give their Reward to them, <HI>who through patient Continuance in well doing seek for it,</HI> Rom ii. 7. And it is ob∣servable, that our Text is a Metaphor taken from Stewards giving Account to their Masters. <HI>Mat.</HI> xviii. 25 Luke xvi. 2. <HI>Give an Account of thy Ste∣wardship, for thou mayest be no longer Steward.</HI> If we carefully attend to the Design and Aim of the Parable of which the Text last mentioned is a Part, we shall easily see, that the main Things in which our Saviour seemeth desirous by this Parable to instruct us are two; the one, that we are but Stewards of the good Things God lends us, and must give an Ac∣count to our Master for them. And the other, That being no other than Stewards intrusted with some of our Master's Goods for a Time, it is our highest Prudence, while we have them in our Trust, to make such an Use of them, as may be for our Advantage, when we give up our Account.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="004230_0006_10042433C286E190"/>
In the handling of the Doctrine, I shall endea∣vour to shew,</P>
<P>I. That Men shall give an Account to God that is ready to judge the Quick and the Dead.</P>
<P>II. That it is of the highest Concernment &amp; Im∣portance to them to be ready to do it.</P>
<P>III. That God is ready to take an Account of all Men. And</P>
<P>IV. Make an Application sutable to the awful and affecting Occasion of this Day.</P>
<P>Of these in their Order. And</P>
<P>I. <HI>That Men shall give an Account to God that is ready to judge the Quick and the Dead</HI> This Men shall do immediately after the Separation of the Soul from the Body; and as it is <HI>appointed un∣to Men ouce to die, but after this the Judgment,</HI> Heb. ix. 27. After Souls by Death are separated from their Bodies, they come to Judgment; and thus every particular Man is handed over by Death to the Bar of God, the great Judge, and so is dis∣patch'd by his Sentence to it's particular State and Place with it's respective People, Rom. xiv. 12. <HI>So then every one of us must give an Account of himself to God.</HI> At the great and general Assize, the Day of Judgment, shall the general and universal One take Place. Acts xvii 31 <HI>Because he hath ap∣pointed a Day in the which he will judge the World in Righteousness by that Man whom he hath ordained, whereof he hath given Assurance unto all Men, in that he hath raised him from the Dead.</HI> When all Sinners in their entire Persons, Bodies and Souls united, shall be adjudged to their final unaltera∣ble and eternal State. Rom. xiv. 10. <HI>But why dost thou judge thy Brother? Or why dost thou set at nought thy Brother? for we shall all stand,</HI> or be set, <HI>before the Judgment seat of Christ.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="004230_0007_10042436F9A533C0"/>
There is a Variety of Scripture that leads us to the Knowlege, and should also lead us to the Acknowlegement of this necessary Point, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That every one assoon as his Spirit takes it's last Farewell of his Body, makes his Appearance be∣fore the impartial Tribunal of God, and that then a righteous and true Sentence is passed without any Delay, whereby their future State is unalter∣ably, and irrevocably determined. Luke xvi 22, 23. <HI>And it came to pass that the Beggar died, and was carried by the Angels into Abraham's Bosom: the rich Man also died and was buried. And in Hell he lift up his Eyes being in Torments.</HI> The parti∣cular Judgment of every single Man follows im∣mediately his Departure out of this Life. The Souls of wicked Men depart to go to their own Place, <HI>Acts</HI> i 25. The Souls of wicked Men are no less punished in Hell than the apostate Angels, <HI>Jude Ver.</HI> 6, 7. And the Spirits of them who in the Time of <HI>Noah</HI> were disobedient, are said to be in Prison. 1 Pet. iii. 19. <HI>And preached unto the Spirits in Prison:</HI> That is Souls of Men departed, which are frequently called Spirits. <HI>Eccles.</HI> xii. 7. <HI>Acts</HI> vii 59. In Prison, that is Hell. So it is ta∣ken, <HI>Prov.</HI> xxvii 20. compared with <HI>Mat.</HI> v. 25. This is the State of the Wicked to which their Souls are cast immediately after Death, where they remain in Torments and utter Darkness, re∣served to the Judgment of the great Day. But the Souls of the Righteous after Death are with Christ in Heaven, and enjoy that blessed Vision, <HI>Phil.</HI> i. 23. Christ promised that the Thief on the Cross should be with him in Paradise, that very same Day he died, <HI>Luke</HI> xxiii. 43. (And it will be a happy Exchange for thy Soul, when by and by it takes its Flight from thy Body, if this may be thy
<PB N="6" REF="004230_0008_1004243BA59CD478"/>
Lot.) The Spirits of just Men after Death return to God, and are received by God, <HI>Eccles.</HI> xii. 7. Though <HI>Solomon</HI> only may speak here of the Peo∣ple of God, yet some understand it of the Souls both of Believers, and Unbelievers, which are both sentenced by God as supream Judge, imme∣diately when a Man dieth, every Man to his Place, the Souls of Believers to Heaven, of Unbelievers to Hell. Thus I leave the first, and proceed to treat of the second Article of the Doctrine; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P>II. <HI>That it is of the highest Concernment and Im∣portance to Men, to be ready to give up their Account to him that is ready to judge the Quick &amp; the Dead.</HI> Our principal Concern and Business in this World, is to prepare for another. And this is to be done by improving all we are and have to God's Glory, which is the principal End of our Creation, and all the Blessings and good Things which our heaven∣ly Father freely, and undeservedly bestows upon us. It is a Justice due from us to God, to promote and maintain his Glory in the World. <Q>Do we swear, saith a Heathen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Arria</HI> in Epict</NOTE>, to prefer none before <HI>Caesar,</HI> and have we not greater Reason to prefer none before God.</Q> What we have, ought to be used for the Honour of God the Giver: He never divests himself of the Dominion and Lordship of his Creatures; he only grants us the Use, not the Abuse of them. We are but Stewards, not Pro∣prietors, in Regard of God who expects an Ac∣count from us how we have employed his Goods for his Honour and Praise in the World.</P>
<P>In Pursuance of this Part of the Doctrine, I have a fair Opportunity given me to enter upon
<PB N="7" REF="004230_0009_10042441DCF767C0"/>
the Consideration and Resolution of two Questi∣ons; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P>Quest. 1. <HI>How shall Men prepare to give an Ac∣count to him that is ready to judge the Quick and the Dead?</HI></P>
<P>Quest. 2. <HI>What makes it of so great Concernment and Importance to Men, to prepare to give Account to him that is ready to judge the Quick &amp; the Dead?</HI></P>
<P>These are Questions of great Moment, and de∣serve full and distinct Answers: But I must be as clear and comprehensive as I can in these, and the other Parts of the Doctrine, considering the scanty Measure of Time now left me. I resume the first Question which is,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>How shall Men prepare to give Account to him that is ready to judge the Quick and the Dead?</HI></P>
<P>This now is to be considered and resolved in this general Manner, <ABBR><HI>viz</HI></ABBR> They that will have the Crown of Glory determined for them at God's Tribunal, must run for it, they must so run as to obtain it, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> ix. 24. This is a Work which requires much Striving and Labour: Men must make it their Business not only to do Things in themselves lawful or good, but which are so cloath∣ed in all their Circumstances, and in the best Man∣ner for the Glory of God, and the Good of others. Forgetting those Things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those Things which are before. To be so intent upon this one Thing, as if there were not any thing else worthy of their Thoughts and Care. <HI>One Thing have I desired of the Lord,</HI> (saith <HI>David) that will I seek after, that I may dwell in the House of the Lord all the Days of my Life, to behold the Beauty</HI> (or the Delights, <HI>Marg) of the Lord, and to inquire in his Temple,</HI> Psalm xxvi. 4. Trusting that they shall through Grace,
<PB N="8" REF="004230_0010_1004244914755DA0"/>
be kept all along, Maugre all Difficulties in the Hand of Christ, till upon his Account they shall be possessed of all they aim at, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the purchased Inheritance eternally settled upon the Sons of God. <HI>Laying aside every Weight, and the Sin that doth so easily beset them, and running with Patience the Race that is set before them,</HI> Heb. xii. 1. Put∣ting off the old Man, the corrupt Nature which remained in every Christian, stiled by the Apostle <HI>Paul, The Body of Death,</HI> Rom. vii. 24. But es∣pecially every Christian his own personal, &amp; proper Iniquity, which cleaves nearer and closer to him than his Garments, improving daily holy <HI>David'</HI>s Care and Study in Psalm xviii. 23. <HI>I was also up∣right before him, and kept my self from mine own Iniquity.</HI> This they are to mortify in them, that how distant soever the Goal is, which finisheth the Race of a Christian's Life, yet the Way pas∣sing to it, though it be troublesome and long, and be set to us all by God himself, must be patiently, strenuosly and constantly run that they may obtain it. Psalm cxix 32, 33. <HI>I will run the Way of thy Commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my Heart. Teach me, O Lord, the Way of thy Statutes, and I shall keep it unto the End.</HI> In a Word, The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> gives us the Substance of this in a few Words, 2 Tim iv. 7. <HI>I have fought the good Fight, I have finished my Course, I have kept the Faith.</HI> The Life of a Christian, of him that would prepare for Death, and the Judgment which im∣mediately follows after it, should be a military Life, but they must not fight the evil Fights of ambiti∣ous or quarrelsome Men, but their Fighting should be the good and noble Fight of Faith, a daily Con∣flict with the World, the Flesh and the Devil, con∣tending for the Faith delivered to the Saints <HI>Ex∣ercising
<PB N="9" REF="004230_0011_1004244C5B160560"/>
themselves unto Godliness,</HI> 1 Tim. iv 7. Their constant Study should be Things that promote Godliness, imparting those Things unto others, and living up to them in their own Conversation; herein exercising themselves to have always Con∣sciences void of Offence, toward God, and toward Men, improving all their Care and Thought chief∣ly that they may not offend GOD or Men in any Thing, but that they may be without Blame at the Judgment of God, as well as of Man. They only are blessed and happy whose Belief concern∣ing another World, and the Account they have to give to God (who will bring every Work into Judgment, with every secret Thing) do make them endeavour after Holiness in this World. Thus have we considered and resolved the first Question, and proceed next to the second Question, which is,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>What makes it of so great Concernment and Importance to Men to prepare to give Account to him that is ready to judge the Quick and the Dead?</HI> Many are the forceable, &amp; cogent Arguments and Motives that might here be subjoined to support and resolve this Question I shall mention a few of them, and I must but just mention them.</P>
<P>As,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Certainty of the Account to be given by all Men to God</HI> The Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> in our Text as∣certains it, <HI>Who shall give an Account,</HI> &amp;c It is a Matter not to be doubted of, they shall not fail of doing it. <HI>I said in my Heart,</HI> (saith <HI>Solomon) God shall judge the Righteous and the Wicked,</HI> Eccl. iii. 17 <HI>So then, every one of us must give an Account of himself to God,</HI> Rom. xiv. 12. Men shall certainly give an Account to God▪ whether they be Supe∣riours, Inferiours, or Equals; and in whatsoever
<PB N="10" REF="004230_0012_1004244E155885F8"/>
Station and Relation, they stand in the World. Heb. xiii. 17. <HI>Obey them that have the Rule over you, and submit your selves, for they watch for your Souls, as they that must give Account,</HI> Not only Ministers, but Magistrates, yea all Men in their se∣veral Capacities, Relations &amp; Conditions in this Life, must do it, they must certainly appear before the Bar of God, who will call all Men unto Judgment.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Account to be given to God by Men, is very Extensive.</HI> It will reach unto all the Deportments, Degrees and Periods of a Man's Life; even their idle Words will be brought unto the Reckoning. Mat. xii. 36. <HI>But I say unto you, that every idle Word that Men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the Day of Judgment. Rejoyce O young Man in thy Youth,</HI> (saith <HI>Solomon) and let thy Heart cheer thee in the Days of thy Youth and walk in the Ways of thy Heart, and in the Sight of thine Eyes, but know thou that for all these Things God will bring thee into Judgment.</HI> The most secretoins shall not escape the Notice and Censure of the Judge: <HI>For God shall bring every Work into Judgment, with e∣very secret Thing, whether it be Good, or whether it be Evil.</HI> Eccl. xii. 14.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>It will be an impartial and critical Account. Unto thee, O Lord belongeth Mercy, for thou rendrest to every Man according to his Work,</HI> Psalm lxii 22. God will judge every Man according (not to what others have done, but) to what he himself hath done. His eternal Joy and Rejoycing, or Sorrow and Mourning shall be according to what he him∣self hath wrought, not according to what others hath wrought <HI>For every Man shall bear his own Burden,</HI> Gal. vi 5. If ever they enter into the Joy of Heaven, they shall rejoyce in their own Work, and if eternal Sorrow be their Portion, they shall
<PB N="11" REF="004230_0013_100424579DD40450"/>
groan under their own Burdens, they will not be the Sins of others, but their own Sins which will sink them into eternal Misery. For though Supe∣riours shall answer to God for the Sins of their In∣feriours, yet it shall not properly be for their In∣feriours Sins, but for their own Sins, in neglecting to warn &amp; reprove them, and to do what in them lay to have hindred them in their sinful Courses. For the Lord our God judgeth righteously, he try∣eth the Reins and the Heart, <HI>Jer.</HI> xi 20. He is a just God, who will deal with all according to their Works. He is a God that takes notice not only of overt Acts, that are scandalous and crimi∣nal, but of the secret Thoughts, Motions and De∣signs of Men's Hearts, Rev. ii 23. <HI>I will kill her Children with Death; and all the Churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the Reins and the Hearts, and I will give every one of you accord∣ing to your Works.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>The Account may be very sudden and unexpect∣ed.</HI> Many a Candle is extinguished before it be half burnt out, many a clear Morning is overcast and clouded before Noon. Oh, how many sud∣den &amp; untimely Deaths have we seen, and heard of in our Day? And how little do Men lay it to Heart? The Sun knoweth his going down, but no Man knoweth the Day or Hour of his Dissolution and Judgment. Good old <HI>Isaac,</HI> he <HI>knew not the Day of his Death,</HI> Gen. xxvii. 2 Nevertheless Man's <HI>Days are determined the Number of his Months is with God, who hath appointed his Bounds that he cannot pass,</HI> and Man <HI>shall accomplish as an Hireling his Day,</HI> Job xiv. 5, 6. Yet the particu∣lar Day of a Man's Death is uncertain▪ and may be very sudden with Respect to any Man. <HI>Boast not thy self of to-morrow,</HI> (saith <HI>Solomon) for thou
<PB N="12" REF="004230_0014_1004245924537810"/>
knowest not what a Day may bring forth,</HI> Prov. xxvii 1. Not only daily Observation and Expe∣rience, but many Scripture Records give Testimo∣ny to this Truth. <HI>Nadab</HI> &amp; <HI>Abihu</HI> offered strange Fire before the Lord, which he commanded them not, and there went out Fire from the Lord, and devoured them, &amp; they died before the Lord, <HI>Lev.</HI> x. 1, 2. Again, It was a sudden &amp; unexpected Death and Judgment, which the Lord's of the Philistines met with, when the House wherein they were feasting and rejoycing, fell upon them by the Hands of <HI>Samson, Judges</HI> xvi 30 And <HI>Job'</HI>s Chil∣dren, (though he was a very good Man) were overtaken with a very sudden and unlook'd for End; when they were rejoycing together, <HI>behold there came a great Wind from the Wilderness, and smote the four Corners of the House, and it fell upon the young Men, and they are dead,</HI> Job i. 19. How sudden and unexpected soever Death comes, so sudden the Judgment, <HI>for after this the Judgment,</HI> Heb. ix. 27.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>A joyful Sentence of endless Bliss and Glory shall at Death be pronounced on all them that are ready and prepared to give up their Account to him that is ready to judge the Quick and the Dead.</HI> They shall near a Voice from Heaven pronouncing their welcome Sentence upon them. Rev. xiv. 13. <HI>And I heard a Voice from Heaven, saying unto me, Blessed are the Dead which die in the Lord, from henceforth, yea saith the Spirit▪ that they may rest from their Labours, and their Works do follow them.</HI> They shall be at Rest from the Troubles of this Life, and their good Deeds and patient Sufferings, shall follow them as Witnesses for them before the Judge of the Quick &amp; the Dead. The Souls of the Righteous are made perfect in Holiness,
<PB N="13" REF="004230_0015_1004245C57759D80"/>
and received into the highest Heavens, where they behold the Face of God in Light and Glory▪ Good <HI>Asaph</HI> being hard put to it to understand and reconcile the Mystery of divine Providence, because of the Prosperity of the Wicked, and the many Troubles and Distresses of the Righteous; he satisfyeth and supports himself with the Consi∣deration of their different Ends. As to the Wic∣ked, saith he, <HI>Surely thou didst set them in slippery Places, thou castedst them down into Destruction,</HI> Psalm lxxiii. 18. But as to the Righteous, he as∣sures such, that God is their Guide here, and un∣changeable Portion hereafter, Ver. 24. <HI>Thou shalt guide me with thy Counsel, and afterward receive me to Glory.</HI> But</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>The Account will be terrible and surprising to such as are unprepared, and unprovided, to give Ac∣count to him that is ready to judge the Quick and the Dead.</HI> Their Sentence will be, <HI>Depart from me, ye cursed into everlasting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels,</HI> Mat. xxv. 41. The Judg∣ment of the Wicked is to eternal Misery; lying in two Things. (1.) In a Departure from God, so as never more to have any Favour from him. (2.) In a Sense of Pain and Misery, exceeding that which Fire causeth to a Body consuming with it. In this Life wicked Men are capable of some Pre∣sence of God with them. &amp; receive several Favours from God, in Gifts of common Providence, and com∣mon Grace, which might serve either as Incourage∣ments to allure them, or Means to help them in turn∣ing to God, but having abused these, the righteous God, in that Day, even the Day of Death, will totally depart from them, and they shall receive no more Tokens of Kindness and Favour from him; and whereas by the Advantages they had from such a
<PB N="14" REF="004230_0016_100424615A5224D8"/>
Presence of divine Providence as God was pleased in this Life to allow them, they lived in some De∣grees of Pleasure and Liberty which they were not thankful for, they shall at that Day, i. e. the Day of Death and Judgment, be adjudged to eter∣nal Torments.</P>
<P N="7">7. Lastly, <HI>The righteous Sentence that shall be pronounced by God the righteous Judge, upon every Man at Death, shall be derisive and irrevocable.</HI> Here there is left no Room for Abatement, Ap∣peal or Review. There can be no Evasion at God's Bar, for he is Judge alone, and is justified when he speaketh and clear when he judgeth, <HI>Psalm</HI> li. 4. Then every Man is ordered to the Place appointed for him, the Wicked to a State of endless Misery from which there is no Recove∣ry. <HI>Judas</HI> went to his own Place, <HI>Acts</HI> i. 25. And the Glutton is tormented forever in that Place without the least Hopes of Reprieve or Escape. The State of the Damned will be void of any De∣gree of Comfort or Satisfaction. But the Souls of good Men when they leave their Bodies, go into an unalterable Estate of eternal Bliss, where are <HI>Abraham, Isaac</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> and enjoy a Felicity, which we are not able to express, but is set out to us under the Notion of <HI>Abraham'</HI>s Bosom, to let us know that it is a Place of Rest and Communion with Saints, and the same Felicity which <HI>Abraham the Friend of God</HI> doth enjoy. <HI>For we know,</HI> saith the Apostle, 2 Cor. V. 1 <HI>that if our earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved, we have a Build∣ing of God, an House not made with Hands eternal in the Heavens.</HI> In such a State as that it shall be incorruptible, no more subject to any Corruption or Decay.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="004230_0017_1004246962C9A3C0"/>
Come we now to the third general Point in the Doctrine, which is,</P>
<P>III. <HI>That God is ready to take an Account of Men.</HI> He is always sit, prepared, furnished and well appointed, to sit upon his Judgment-Seat, and pronounce Sentence according to the various Cases and Suits of all that are summoned, to appear be∣fore him. <HI>Behold the Judge standeth before the Door,</HI> James v. 9 But some Men wish there were no God, no Judge to call them unto an Ac∣count. <HI>The Fool hath said in his Heart there is no God,</HI> Psalm xiv. 1. That is, he wishes there were no God, for he sees nothing but Matter of Fear, Terror and Amazement round about. As the Wicked here lived without the Bounds of God's Law, they are afraid to fall under the Stroke of his Justice: Fear wishes the Destruction of that which it apprehends hurtful: And the amazing Fear of the Wicked considers God as a God to whom Vengeance belongs, as the Judge of all the Earth, <HI>Psalm</HI> liv. 12.</P>
<P>That God is prepared, and incontestably well furnished to take an Account of Men, may in some measure appear from the few following Conside∣rations.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>His unaccountable Sovereignty. He is the bles∣sed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords,</HI> 1 Tim. vi 15. He is the only Potentate because he hath only Power in, and from himself, by him Kings reign, and he is the blessed Poten∣tate, because he is the Fountain of all Felicity, and Happiness, yea, he is the most mighty Being, and Lord, to whom all other Princes are Subjects, all other Lords are Vassals▪ he rules all as the Hea∣vens do over the Earth. He is King of Worlds, King of Ages, as the Word translated Eternal sig∣nifies,
<PB N="16" REF="004230_0018_1004246B6E75EFA8"/>
1 <HI>Tim.</HI> i. 17. God is Being of the invisible World, and the sensitive. Whatsoever is in Time is subject to the Sovereignty of the great God, who gave Being to all Things. <HI>The Lord hath pre∣pared his Throne in the Heavens: and his Kingdom ruleth over all,</HI> Psalm ciii 19 His royal Authori∣ty extends over Angels and Devils, over godly and ungodly, over rational and irrational Crea∣tures; all Things and Persons, at all Times, and in all Places, are swayed and governed by his mighty Scepter. Earthly Kings may step out of their own Country, into the Territory of a neigh∣bouring Prince, and as such leave their Country, they leave their Dominion behind them; but Heaven and Earth &amp; every particular Part of both is the Territory of God</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>His Power is great and incomprehensible. The Thunder of his Power who can understand?</HI> Job xxvi. 14. Infinite and unconceivable Power is es∣sential to the divine Nature. This is a Truth not to be doubted of: For though Goodness, Wisdom, Mercy &amp; Justice be essential, yet Power is more appa∣rently essential, because no Acts of Goodness, Wis∣dom, Mercy, Justice, can be exercised by him with∣out Power. Some have observed, That God is called Almighty seventy Times in Scripture<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssins</HI> de Perfect. div.</NOTE>. And tho' it be true that God hath given Evidences of his Power in all his Works, yet it is as true, that he hath a Power beyond the Expression of it in his Works; and as this is truly the Glory of the di∣vine Nature, so it is most certainly the Support and great Comfort of Believer. And to this very Purpose the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> expresses it by an ex∣cellent Periphrasis for the Honour and Glory of
<PB N="17" REF="004230_0019_100424716F1CB6F8"/>
Jehovah, Eph. iii. 20. <HI>Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or think, unto him be Glory in the Churches.</HI> By the exceeding Greatness of his Power, God works Faith, enables to bear Afflictions, and preserves to Salvation.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>His Knowlege is infinite. O Lord, How great are thy Works! and thy Thoughts are very deep,</HI> Psalm xcii. 5. God knows the Essence, Qualities and Properties of all his Creatures, he hath an u∣niversal Knowlege of Things, Persons, and all their Motions and Actions he knows all Things, whether they be possible, past, present or future. He knows all the Actions of Creatures. He counts in particular, all the Ways of Men. <HI>Doth he not see all my Ways, and count all my Steps,</HI> Job xxxi. 4. He discerns the Thoughts and Intents of the Heart, all that is in the Mind, all that is in the Affections, every Stirring &amp; Purpose; so that not one Thought can be withheld from him, yea, <HI>Hell and Destruc∣tion are before him: how much more then the Hearts of the Children of Men?</HI> Prov. xv. 11. All Things are naked and manifest unto the Eye of that God with whom we have to do, our secret Sins are not hid from his Eyes. Psalm xc. 8. <HI>We are consumed by thine Anger, and by thy Wrath we are troubled. Thou hast set our Iniquities before thee, and our secret Sins in the Light of thy Countenance.</HI> Yet the Cor∣ruption of Men doth still keep a contrary Notion, and Conceit in their Minds, that God hath forgot∣ten, that he hides his Face from Transgressions, and will not regard their Iniquity, <HI>Psalm</HI> x. 11. God therefore in his infinite Wisdom, will (in their Time &amp; Order) summon the Children of Men to Trial, that his most excellent Knowlege might be publickly manifested, and receive an universal
<PB N="18" REF="004230_0020_10042475B0DA8FB0"/>
Testimony, that no Secrecy can be a Cover from it. And at Death the Judgment will be set, and the Books opened, <HI>Dan.</HI> vii 10. as well as at the Day of Judgment, with respect to every individu∣al Person, the Book of God's Records, and Con∣science the Counterpart, will be fully opened and read before us, and out of those Books shall Men be judged according to their Works, <HI>Rev</HI> xx 12.</P>
<P N="4">4. Lastly, <HI>Consider his spotless Justice &amp; unbound∣ed Mercy. Justice and Judgment are the Habita∣tion of thy Throne; Mercy and Truth shall go be∣fore thy Face,</HI> Psal. lxxxix. 14 When the guilty Sinner, (bound in the Chains of both original and actual Transgressions of the righteous Law of God, whereby he is bound over to the Wrath of God, and the Curse of the Law, and made subject to Death, with all Miseries, temporal, spiritual and eternal,) I say when the guilty Sinner, this vile and wretched Criminal stands forth at the Bar of God's Tribunal, doubtless there are such Pleas as these suggested, <ABBR><HI>viz</HI></ABBR> Justice pleads against eve∣ry Son of <HI>Adam,</HI> thus, I arraign before thy Tri∣bunal a Rebel who was the glorious Work of thy Hands, the Center of thy rich Goodness <HI>Thou hast made him a little lower than the Angels, and hast crowned him with Glory and Honour. Thou madest him to have Dominion over the Works of thy Hands; thou hast put all Things under his Feet,</HI> Psalm viii. 5, 6. able is indeed Miserable where∣by to excite thy Compassion; but he is not mise∣rable without being criminal. He is a Rebel not by Necessity, but by Will. But Mercy steps in, and pleads in the behalf of the Offender, and most warmly urgeth, if Man be destroyed &amp; made Fuel for Hell Fire, the Creation is vain and to no Purpose: But then Justice answers, if Man be not
<PB N="19" REF="004230_0021_1004247D3B83E6A0"/>
condemned, the Law is insignificant, and will be intirely frustrated: Truth backs and supports Jus∣tice, and free Grace warmly urgeth Mercy! How can these Pleas be answered, this seeming Con∣tradiction accorded, and the Difference adjusted? The Reason of Man cannot reach this Case, nor his Ability provide a Salvo, but God in the Depth of his Wisdom found out an Expedient, by which Truth and Justice shall be satisfied in punishing, and Grace and Mercy most illustriously displayed in pardoning, by transferring the Punishment of our Crimes upon a Surety, even the Lord Jesus Christ, from whose precious Blood Justice exacts a Recompense, and for whose Blood, Life and Sal∣vation are conferred upon us by Mercy, without the Expence and Loss of one Drop of our own. This is the admirable Temperament found out in the unsearchable Wisdom of God, whereby his Justice is honoured in the Sufferings of Man's Sure∣ty, and his Mercy glorified in the Application of the Propitiation to the Offender, Rom iii. 24, 25. <HI>Being justified freely by his Grace, through the Re∣demption that is in Jesus Christ Whom God hath set forth to be a Propitiation through Faith in his Blood, to declare his Righteousness for the Remissi∣on of Sins that are past, through the Forbearance of God.</HI> Thus doth God freely justify those, whom he effectually calleth, not by infusing Righteous∣ness into them▪ but by pardoning their Sins, and by accounting, and accepting their Persons, as righ∣teous, not for any Thing wrought in them, or done by them, but for Christ's Sake alone, who by his Obedience and Death, did fully discharge the Debt of all those, who are thus justified, and did make a proper, real and full Satisfaction to the Father's Justice, in their Behalf.</P>

<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>In the Improvement of this Doctrine, I shall in the first Place address this numerous Assembly; and in the second Place, the poor Prisoner, who is the Occasion of so great an Assembly here at this Time. As to the Assembly, I might apply the Doctrine, and this melancholly Occasion many Ways to them, but that I must not intrude upon your Time, or Patience. Let then your Ears, and rather your Hearts, give diligent Attention to a few Words. As</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That it is a necessary Point of your Faith to believe that there is a God that will call us all (in our Time and Order) to an Account, and that with him there are future Rewards and Punishments.</HI> We should humbly and feelingly acknowlege with holy <HI>David, Verily there is a Reward for the Righteous, verily, he is a God that judgeth in the Earth,</HI> Psalm lviii. 11. I beseech you entertain, and improve this most certain Truth, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That it is no longer to be doubted, or questioned by a∣ny, that there is a God that inquires into, tries and discerns all Things &amp; Persons. <HI>The Lord's Throne is in Heaven, his Eyes behold, his Eye lids try the Children of Men,</HI> Psalm xi 4. And this he doth not as a Spectator only but to render to every one according to his Work, <HI>Psalm</HI> lxii. 12. To God the sovereign Being, the supream and universal Lawgiver and Judge, doth belong the universal Right and Power of vindictive Justice, it is his Propriety, as he will avenge all Injuries against his People, he will much more avenge the Sins and Injuries against his Son, and will actually return to Evil-Doers as a Recompence for their Sins the Evil of Punishment. He is not only just and
<PB N="21" REF="004230_0023_1004248ACF9D0648"/>
powerful, but actually manifesting both in his Re∣tribution on them. Deut. xxxii. 41. <HI>If I whet my glittering Sword and mine Hand take hold on Judg∣ment, I will render Vengeance to mine Enemies, and will reward them that hate me.</HI> If Men did be∣lieve, and constantly revere this Truth, it is im∣possible that they should allow themselves in so many Crimes as they are guilty of, and daily per∣petrating. But before I finish this Use, I must take leave to mention a few Errors and Ob∣jections alledged and maintained by some Adver∣saries to this Truth, and offer Scripture Confuta∣tion of them.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Arminians</HI> and some others say, the Souls of the Righteous are not presently after Death, admitted to enjoy Happiness, which consists in seeing of God, but are put into some Mansion, though it be not a heavenly one, yet a Place above Hell, where they enjoy, even until the Resurrection, some heavenly Delight and Re∣creation, without seeing God. And the <HI>Soci∣nians</HI> likewise tell us, that the Souls of the Righ∣teous after Death, until the Resurrection are (as it were) extinguished. These Errors are broach∣ed and maintained in Opposition to many express Texts of Scripture, as <HI>Eccles.</HI> xii. 7. where the wise Man declares that the Spirits of just Men af∣ter Death, return to God and are rewarded by him. And the Protomartyr <HI>Stephen</HI> died in the Belief of this Truth, and sealed it with his Blood, <HI>Acts</HI> vii. 59. <HI>And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus receive my Spirit.</HI> A∣greably the Author of the Epistle to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> assures us, That the Spirits of just Men are made perfect in Holiness, and placed in the heavenly Jerusalem, with the Angels, <HI>Heb</HI> xii. 22, 23. And
<PB N="22" REF="004230_0024_10040233CF7D8BB0"/>
a more excellent Author, namely, Jesus Christ the Lord of Glory intimates <HI>Luke</HI> xvi. 22, 25. That the Souls of the Righteous after Death are com∣forted, and carried into <HI>Abraham'</HI>s Bosom.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Greeks</HI> and others alledge and maintain that the Souls of the Wicked are not adjudged to the Torments of Hell, till after the Resurrection: And the <HI>Socinians</HI> go still farther, saying, that the Souls of the Wicked shall never be tormented in Hell. These Errors contradict the sacred Text, in sundry Places, and Instances, Heb. ix. 27. <HI>And as it is appointed unto Men once to die, but after this the Judgment.</HI> Which evidently sheweth, that the particular Judgment of every single Man follows immediately his Departure out of this Life: Of this also Instances shall now be produced, name∣ly, The Soul of the rich Glutton which was tor∣mented in Hell Flames after it left the Body, <HI>Luke</HI> xvi. 22, 23. And <HI>Judas</HI> was struck into his own Place, <HI>Acts</HI> i. 25.</P>
<P N="3">3 Very gross and absurd are the Errors which <HI>Papists</HI> have framed against this Doctrine, who (albeit the holy Scripture doth not acknowlege any other Place than Heaven and Hell for Souls, departed from their Bodies) yet have devised o∣ther four besides these two; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Limbus Patrum, Limbus Infantum, a most pleasant Meadow, and Purgatory.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Limbus Patrum,</HI> in which (say they) the faithful who died before Christ's Passion have been shut up as in a dark Prison under Ground, and be∣ing without Torment, and for the Time without Happiness, have been kept close there until Christ's Resurrection and Ascension into Heaven. In Answer hereto, we should remember what is already noted from <HI>Heb.</HI> xii. 22, 23. To which
<PB N="23" REF="004230_0025_10042490DB0FFA80"/>
we may add, that the Vertue of Christ's Sacrifice did no less extend it self to Believers under the old Testament, than the new. We are told, Rev. xiii 8. <HI>All that dwell upon the Earth shall worship him, whose Names are not written in the Book of the Lamb slain from the Foundation of the World.</HI> And the Example of <HI>Enoch,</HI> and <HI>Moses,</HI> and <HI>Elias,</HI> which two before the Passion of Christ were seen upon the Mount with him, <HI>Luke</HI> ix. 30, 31. is a Confutation of this wild Fancy, even to a Demon∣stration.</P>
<P N="2">2. Their <HI>Limbus Infantum</HI> hath no better Ground to support it, than their <HI>Limbus Patrum,</HI> because the Covenant belongs to the Children of Believers though not baptised: In which Covenant, Glory and Life eternal are promised. Acts ii. 39. <HI>For the Promise is unto you, and to your Children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.</HI> Likewise our compassionate Redeemer declared, that the Kingdom of Heaven belonged to little Children, though not baptised. <HI>Mat.</HI> xix. 14. And the Infants of the Israelites dying before the eighth Day, were not shut up in <HI>Limbus Infantum,</HI> as the Adversaries themselves confess. But the Nature and Essence of Baptism, under the new Testament, and the Nature and Essence of Circumcision under the old, are the same, according to the Apostle's Reasoning, <HI>Colos.</HI> ii. 11, 12.</P>
<P N="3">3. The third Device, is almost pleasant Mea∣dow; in which (say they) as in a royal or sena∣torian Prison, the Souls that are in it want Happi∣ness, yet suffer no Punishment of Sense, except what ariseth from the Delay of Happiness, but on∣ly of Loss. This Place seems to be the <HI>Elisian Fields,</HI> taken out of the sixth Book of <HI>Virgil'</HI>s
<PB N="24" REF="004230_0026_100424926202A270"/>
<HI>AEneids.</HI> The Folly of this idle Fancy is made evident by the Answer to the first Objection. And methinks the very Hearing or Reading of it will carry its own Confutation, yea Condemnation with it, to every thinking and judicious Christian.</P>
<P N="4">4. Lastly. <HI>Purgatory.</HI> The Notion of Purgato∣ry, devised by the popish Church, is built upon the tottering Foundation of Venial Sin. But there is no such Thing as Venial Sin, as it is explained by the Papists themselves. <HI>Rom.</HI> vi. 23. And the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> assures us that temporal Punishments do not extend themselves beyond this Life. <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 18. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> iv. 17, 18. For in this Life only the Godly receive their evil Things, as the Wic∣ked receive their good Things, <HI>Luke</HI> xvi. 25. They that die in the Lord, rest from their Labours, <HI>Rev.</HI> xiv. 13. And Christ's Satisfaction for the Sins of Believers, is most full, compleat and perfect, and doth not need our imperfect Satisfactions, whether for the Fault or the Punishment. <HI>Isai.</HI> liii. <HI>Chap.</HI> 1 John i. 7. <HI>And the Blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all Sin.</HI></P>
<P>USE 2. <HI>Be perswaded to employ your Thoughts and best Care, to be always ready to give up your Account to him that is ready to judge the Quick and the Dead Knowing the Terrors of the Lord, we perswade Men,</HI> saith the Apostle, 2 Cor. v. 11. We believing and being fully perswaded that there shall be such a great and terrible Day of the Lord, when there shall be such a narrow in∣quiry and Search into whatsoever Men have tho't spake or done in the Flesh. We perswade Men to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and to walk according to the Rule of the Gospel, to avoid e∣very dishonest and unwarrantable Behaviour a∣mongst Men, to decline not only openly dishonest
<PB N="25" REF="004230_0027_1004249B73FE3228"/>
Actions, but every secret and hidden dishonest Be∣haviour. There are those, who tho' they make a splendid Profession of Christianity, and behave themselves very speciously in their more external Conversation, yet it were a Shame to speak of the Things that are done of them in Secret; but yet in the Presence of God their Judge, who will e're long undoubtedly call them to an Account, to which Period, truly all of us are hastening. <HI>Man is like to Vanity, his Days are as a Shadow that passeth away,</HI> Psalm cxliv. 5. And therefore Men ought to employ and improve all their Pow∣ers, Talents, Time, Means and Seasons of Grace, all that they have, and all Occasions for this very great Purpose, namely, to prepare for Death, and the Judgment that immediately follows after it: <HI>Blessed is that Servant, whom his Lord when he cometh shall find so doing,</HI> Mat. xxiv. 46. And the present melancholly Occasion should profitably be improved by every one of us; we are not to be Spectators only, but Mourners on many Ac∣counts, which I cannot now stand to enumerate. We are to be warned and admonished, the poor Criminal in his Chains, is a Monitor to us all. This House of Prayer and Praise, is now turned in∣to an House of Mourning. Ye are anon to be Witnesses of a very affecting Tragedy, Death indeed is the End of Men, and who can be so Hardy as not to receive some Impressions from the natural &amp; timely Death of others: But more especially from the untimely End which some unhappily bring upon themselves, (as in the Case of this unhappy young Man, in his twenty-ninth Year,) who finds by sad Experience that there is no Discharge in that War, and that Wickedness shall not deliver those that are given to it, <HI>Eccl.</HI> viii. 8 Oh, that the Day of
<PB N="26" REF="004230_0028_1004249D02082C10"/>
his Death, may prove better to him than the Day of his Birth! and that every Soul in this Assem∣bly may find that Saying of the wise Man, expe∣rimentally accomplished in himself, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that <HI>it is better to go to the House of Mourning, than to the House of Feasting; for that is the End of all Men, and the Living will lay it to his Heart,</HI> Eccles. vii. 2.</P>
<P>Was the poor Spectacle before us, (I mean the Prisoner) now to speak to you, doubtless he would address you to this Effect: Take Warning by me every one of you, more especially young Men: Behold the woful Fruits of bad Courses, Disobedi∣ence to those that had the Care of my Education, and perhaps their sinful Neglect, Contempt of the Word and Sacraments, and of the Ministry, and Worship of God, Profanation of the Lord's Day, taking the Name of the glorious Jehovah often in vain, Idleness, Drunkenness, and Rioting, Lying, Stealing, and wasting of my Neighbour's Goods, whose Good and Quiet, I ought to tender and regard as my own. I have tasted the Pleasures of Sin, but now I drink deep of the bitter Fruits of it. My Companions in my ill Courses, have often (at the Cost of our innocent Neighbours) put a Cup of Pleasure, sweetned Draughts into my Hand, but mixed with the Poyson of Sin, which now is become a Cup of Shame and Bitterness unto me. Oh! Pity me, and pity your selves, by guarding betimes against an ignorant and ill spent Life. And pray earnestly to be protected by divine Mercy from coming to my sad Case, and so shameful an End as I have brought my sinful Life to. To think that this poor Object suffers only for the Sin of Burglary is impertinent: No, his many other E∣normities, were as so many Ingredients in the
<PB N="27" REF="004230_0029_100424A0143FAB88"/>
Provocation given to a just God, to leave him to perpetrate the last Act upon which his Conviction is grounded, and by which his Measure is filled up. May all of you then be careful to shun sin∣ful and vicious Courses, which sooner or later will bring Shame, and make so good Improvement of this Occasion, as to induce you to beg of God dai∣ly in the Stile of holy <HI>David,</HI> Psalm cxix. 133. <HI>Order my Steps in thy Word, and let not any Iniqui∣ty have Dominion over me.</HI></P>
<P>I have already hinted at sundry Motives to en∣gage Men to study to be always in a Readiness to give up their Account unto God, which is to be done by them immediately after Death. As to the Certainty of the Account to be given, it is very extensive, it will be impartial and critical, it may be very sudden and unexpected: Endless Joy and Comfort shall be to those that are found ready, but endless Sorrow &amp; Misery to such as are found unprepared, and the Sentence that is passed upon every Man at Death, will be decisive and irrevo∣cable. Moreover, there are many special Advan∣tages and Privileges which doth undoubtedly re∣dound to those that are constant and faithful in the Prosecution of this necessary Work; Glory, Ho∣nour and Peace to every Man that worketh good, saith the Apostle, <HI>Rom.</HI> ii. 10. The Word Peace, according to the usual Acceptation of it amongst the Hebrews, is comprehensive of all Good and Happiness, both here and hereafter. But Time would fail me, if I should attempt to give a List of Particulars here. I have therefore fixed upon three general Heads, under which (I think) they are all couched. As</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an Evidence of their Title to the Privi∣leges of God's Children.</HI> Yea, they are truly such,
<PB N="28" REF="004230_0030_100424A55536E498"/>
(as far as we can and ought to judge.) <HI>The Tree is known by his Fruit,</HI> saith our Saviour, Mat. xii. 33. If the Fruit be good, the Tree must be good. And the Branch cannot bear Fruit, except it be in the Vine, <HI>John</HI> xv. 4 God graciously giveth unto such a Place and a Name better than of Sons and Daughters; he will give them an everlasting Name that shall not be cut off. This shall be the high Privilege, most excellent Dignity and Ad∣vantage of all those that chuse the Things that please him, and take hold of his Covenant; yea, all those that join themselves to the Lord to serve him, and to love him, shall in their Persons and Services be accepted with him; he will bring them to his holy Mountain, and make them joyful in his House of Prayer, <HI>Isai.</HI> lvi. 4, to 8. Doubtless the Lord God is their Father, and they the Tribes of his Inheritance, and the People of his Holiness, <HI>Isai.</HI> lxiii. 16, 17, 18.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>If they are the Children of God, they are Christ's near Relatives, they are his Brethren. If Chil∣dren, then Heirs, Heirs of God, and joint Heirs with Christ;</HI> united to him by Faith and Holiness. And <HI>there is no Condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus; for the Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus hath made them free from the Law of Sin and Death.</HI> So great and inconceivable are their Advantages and Privileges, that the Tongue of the eloquent, evangelical Prophet could not express them. Isai. lxiv. 4. <HI>Since the beginning of the World, Men have not heard, not perceived by the Ear, neither hath the Eye seen, O God besides thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him</HI> The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> citeth this Text, <HI>Rom.</HI> ii. 9. And shews in the 8th Verse, what is meant by the Things prepared for them that wait for and
<PB N="29" REF="004230_0031_100424AB693C51F8"/>
love God, namely, Christ and his Benefits, which are set out as Things not obvious to Sense, and not to be comprehended by Reason. It could never have entred into the Heart of Man to conceive, that God should give his only begotten Son out of his eternal Bosom, to take upon him the Nature of Man, and to die upon the Cross: or, that Christ should so far humble himself and become obedient unto Death, to redeem and rescue lost Man, from eternal Death, reconcile him to his eternal Father, and by the Sacrifice of himself secure his Happi∣ness, and Glory. <HI>Blessed are they that do his Com∣mandments, that they may have Right to the Tree of Life, and may enter in through the Gates into the City,</HI> Rev. xxii. 14. Thus,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>They are begotten unto a lively Hope, to an In∣heritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fa∣deth not away, reserved in Heaven for them. He that doth the Will of God abideth for ever,</HI> 1 John ii. 17. He that unites himself with the supream eternal Good, by a Will that is guided by and con∣formed to the divine Will, abideth for ever, par∣takes of a Felicity Co-eternal with the Object and Rule upon which his Heart was set, and which it was guided by. They shall walk with God their Saviour in white, be cloathed in white Raiment, be Pillars in the Temple of the living God; yea, they shall be continually before the Throne of God, and serve him Day and Night in his Temple. And he that fitteth on the Throne shall dwell a∣mong them, they shall hunger no more, nor thirst any more; neither shall the Sun light on them, nor any Heat▪ for the Lamb which is in the midst of the Throne shall feed them, and God shall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes, <HI>Rev</HI> vii. 9. 13, to 18 Surely such excellent Privileges and
<PB N="30" REF="004230_0032_100424AEE67F7FD0"/>
Advantages are not to be slighted, but industrious∣ly and constantly to be sought for, with Perseve∣rance in the Work to the End.</P>
<P>It might be proper here to add some Directions, but I must refer you in this Matter to the Answer given to the first Question, under the second Branch of the Doctrine, and hasten to say a few Words to the distressed Prisoner. Poor Man, We pity you, and we have frequently and fervently prayed to God for Mercy to your immortal Soul: And I hope that our Prayers and Labours have not been in vain. I trust that you remember that I have heretofore directed you in publick &amp; pri∣vate, as to the Nature of Gospel Faith, and Re∣pentance, and that God is ready to shew Mercy to penitent believing Sinners I hope I need not in∣sist at this Time upon these Points. Now, now, is the only Time left you to improve these special Graces with the greatest Importunity. Nor do I think it convenient at this critical Hour to load you with Variety of Matter or Phrases; but very affectionately move you to the following Medita∣tion and Inquiry with your self.</P>
<P N="1">1. Consider, <HI>That you are in a few Minutes to give an Account to him that is ready to judge the Quick and the Dead. Behold, the Judge standeth before the Door.</HI> Your Case is as it were called, and the Sentence preparing ready to be pronounced upon you this, <HI>Give an Account of your Steward∣ship, for thou shalt be no longer Steward.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Consider, <HI>the present State of your Soul</HI> How you are furnished to receive and entertain the righ∣teous Sentence to be pronounced upon you at the Tribunal of God, at the Expiration of a few Mo∣ments. What are your Convictions? What are your Supports and Comforts? Hath the Spirit of

God by its inward Influence upon your Heart, so convinced you of Sin, in not believing in Christ, that you now believe in him to the saving of your Soul? If so, you very sensibly feel these two Ef∣fects of it. One, a godly Sorrow of Heart for Sin, as it is displeasing to a holy God, judging and condemning thy self before God. Are you ready to say with the Thief on the Cross, that you re∣ceive the due Reward of your Deeds? <HI>Luke</HI> xxiii. 41. Most earnestly beseeching the almighty Crea∣tor of all Persons &amp; Things, which made Waters flow out of the Rock to smite thy flinty Heart, to take thy stony Heart out of thy Body, to open thy Heart as he did <HI>Lydia</HI>'s, to put a new Spirit within thy Bowels, to anoint thine Eyes with Eye-Salve, that so thou mayest now see and feel thine own Wretchedness, and mayest feelingly acknow∣lege with <HI>Paul,</HI> Rom vii. 18 <HI>That in thy Flesh there dwelleth no good Thing.</HI> With holy <HI>David, Psalm</HI> xxxviii. 4 That thine Iniquities are as a weighty Burden unto thee, yea too heavy for thee. With <HI>Jacob,</HI> That thou art less than the least of God's Mercies. With <HI>Daniel,</HI> That open Shame belongeth unto thee. With <HI>Job,</HI> That thou canst not answer for one of a thousand, <HI>Chap.</HI> ix. 3 That so thou mayest have, (if it were possible) a Glimpse of that woful Score, which the Lord hath against thee in this thy Day of Reckoning The other is a justifying of God now, under the manifest Effects of his holy &amp; just Displeasure against thy Sins; saying in Humility &amp; Sincerity of thy Soul, O Lord thou art just in all that is brought upon me, for thou hast done right, but I have done wickedly, <HI>Neh</HI> ix 33. Thus will the Mercy of God be sweet unto thee, when thou feelest the intolerable Burthen of a wounded Spirit; thy Soul will thirst after Righte∣ousness,
<PB N="32" REF="004230_0034_100424B6DEAE9570"/>
&amp; all Things will be as Dung to thee; that thou mayest win Christ, and obtain the Favour of God through him. The Tidings of Christ in the Sequel of the Discourse, will make thy very Heart to leap within thee, as the Salutation of <HI>Mary</HI> did the Babe in the Womb of <HI>Elisabeth:</HI> They will come down upon thy perplexed Soul, like the Rain upon the mown Grass, &amp; as the Showers that water the Earth, <HI>Psalm</HI> lxxi. 6 And this leads to the next Meditation and Inquiry <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P N="2">2. What are your <HI>Supports?</HI> Where do you find Comfort? Do you find them wholly in Christ? Can you with Humility, and most sincere Affection take your good Deeds, and your bad Deeds, &amp; lay them all in a Heap at the Feet of a glorious Christ, and say in the Warmth &amp; Ardour of your Soul, Blessed Jesus, in thee alone I find Rest, Comfort &amp; Support▪ Lord, there is no Salvation in any other, <HI>Acts</HI> iv 12. In the Lord have I Righteousness &amp; Strength. The Righteousness which God hath set forth for Justi∣fication is not my own, but a Righteousness which is of God, <HI>Phil</HI> iii. 9, 10. Of God's appointing, and of God's performing; appointed by the Father who is God, and performed by the Son, who is one with the Father, a Righteousness infinitely excell∣ing that of all the glorious Angels, since it is an un∣changeable Righteousness which can never fail, <HI>Dan</HI> iv. 24. A Righteousness wherein the Holiness of God can acquiesce, as considered in it self, because it is a Righteousness of one equal with God Know this then, that the holiest Man on Earth, highly dis∣honours the divine Majesty, when he insists upon his own imperfect &amp; impure Righteousness for his Justification, as if a mortal Man were as just as God, &amp; a Man as pure as his Maker, <HI>Job</HI> iv 17. So then you highly honour the Purity of God's Nature,
<PB N="33" REF="004230_0035_100424B9ED12F0C0"/>
when you charge your self with Folly, acknowlege your self unclean, and accept of that Righteousness which alone gives a full contentment to God's Infinite Purity, even the Righteousness of Jesus Christ in whom all the Promises of God, are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> i. 20. Who is able to save them to the uttermost, that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them. <HI>Heb.</HI> vii. 25. And who of God is made unto every one that believeth, (and so to you, if now without any reserve you clasp about Him with the arms of a lively active Faith, and canst with <HI>Peter</HI> appeal to him, saying, <HI>Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee.</HI> Joh. xxi. 17) wisdom, righteousness, sanctifi∣cation, and eternal Redemption. Well then, hop∣ing the best, (as in Charity it behoveth me) of you. I now bid you farewell, with my earnest wish, and fervent prayer to God for you, in the language, and manner of the apostle <HI>Peter,</HI> 2 Pet. i. 2, 3, 4. 11. <HI>Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord, According as his divine power hath given unto us all Things that pertain unto life and godliness: Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and pre∣cious promises; that by these you might be partaker of the divine nature.</HI> And <HI>so an entrance be mini∣stred to you abundantly, into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus-Christ.</HI> To whom be glory for ever. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Confession and Dying Warning of Hugh Henderson, Sign'd by him in the Presence of four of the Ministers, the Morning of the Day of his Execution.</HEAD>
<P>I <HI>Hugh Henderson</HI> otherwise through my Wickedness called <HI>John Hamilton,</HI> of about 28 or 29 Years of Age, was born in <HI>Armagh</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Ire∣land,</HI> received Baptism in the Manner of the Presbyte∣rians, &amp; was brought up by my Uncle, who was obliged to give me suitable Learning, but did not; which Neglect, to∣gether with my own neglect of learning the Word of God afterwards, was a great Reason of my taking to such wicked Courses as have brought me to my unhappy▪ untimely End.</P>
<P>I began with smaller Sins while I was Young; with but stealing Pins; against which I received Warning often∣times, but persisted in it, and was very disobedient, till <HI>I</HI> increased further in Sin.</P>
<P>I came into this Country about nine Years ago, &amp; pre∣sently took to <HI>Drinking;</HI> and when I had been about a Year here, I took to <HI>Stealing,</HI> which I have followed from that Time, except too or three Years intermission; and have liv'd in profane <HI>Cursing, Swearing,</HI> and <HI>Lying,</HI> and <HI>breaking</HI> the <HI>Sabbath,</HI> and <HI>Gameing,</HI> especially whilst I was in <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> Government; to which I have added <HI>Whoreing</HI> also: So that my Sins have been very many and hainous in the Sight of God and Man; but particu∣larly I confess my <HI>House-breaking,</HI> for which I must justly die, and am righteously expos'd to the Wrath of God for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="004230_0037_100424C8173AC700"/>
But I have my Hope and Dependance upon the Lord Jesus Christ for the Pardon of my many &amp; great Sins, and for eternal Salvation: For He has come into the World to bear the Sins of Men, has suffered upon the Cross, and made Atonement by his Blood: In Him I desire to be∣lieve with my whole Soul, repenting bitterly of all my Sins, and forsaking and renouncing them all; begging and hoping for Pardon at the Hands of God only for the sake of Jesus Christ</P>
<P>I also entreat Forgiveness of all Persons whom I have wronged and injured by my Acts of Unrighteousness and Violence, or other Wickedness.</P>
<P>I desire to bless God he has given me such a Sight and Sense of my Sins, and has granted me such a Space for my repenting, and affording me the precious Means of Grace, when he might have justly cut me off suddenly in the midst of my Wickedness.</P>
<P>I thank God also for the many Favours and Kindnesses of his People and Ministers, and the Helps and Assistances afforded me during my Imprisonment.</P>
<P>I thank his Excellency the Governour for his Compassi∣on towards me in granting me a <HI>Reprieve,</HI> and am sorry that I have not improv'd the whole Time of it better than I have; but trust it has been a Mercy to <HI>my</HI> Soul.</P>
<P>And being that my Sins have brought me to these mise∣rable Sufferings, I would solemnly <HI>Warn</HI> all Persons <HI>in General</HI> that they beware of sinning against an holy God as I have done; and I pray God to keep them from the Sins I have been guilty of; from <HI>Whoring</HI> and Drinking, breaking the Sabbath, Cursing and Swearing, and Lying and Gaming; and from Stealing especially.</P>
<P>I would <HI>particularly</HI> warn all <HI>Parents</HI> &amp; <HI>Heads of Families</HI> that they neglect not Prayer in their Houses, and that they do not fail to bring up the Children under their Care in suitable Learning, and in the Knowledge and Fear of God and Practice of Religion, that they may not fall into such pernicious Courses as I have done.</P>
<P>I would solemnly Warn all <HI>Children</HI> and <HI>Servants</HI> that they be sure to be obedient to their Parents, and Masters and Mistressess: Disobedience being a dangerous Inlet to much other Wickedness</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="004230_0038_100424D36A302008"/>
And I solemnly warn all <HI>Young Persons</HI> that they espe∣cially beware of the foremention'd heinous Sins, and they do not by any Means neglect the Care of their Souls, but see that they be busy with God in their Youth, ac∣quaint themselves with Christ and the way to Salvation by Him, accept of Him, and rely upon Him for eternal Happiness.</P>
<P>I would earnestly Warn and Charge all <HI>Tavern Keepers</HI> that they mind and give good Weight and Measure, there being much Iniquity through the neglect thereof, and see that they keep good Orders, and do not let Persons have too much Drink, being that by those Means they become in a great Measure chargeable with the Sins which others commit when depriv'd of their Senses thereby. I pray the Tavern Keepers of this Town of <HI>Worcester</HI> that they would beware of suffering any Disorders in their Houses, letting the young Persons, or the younger or elder Per∣sons of the Place continue in their evil Practices of drink∣ing to Excess.</P>
<P>And while I remember what pass'd with me in <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> Government, I can't but warn them against their rudeness, viciousness, irreligiousness, and breaking the Lord's Day.</P>
<P>Having given this Warning, I desire to commend my self to the Charity and Prayers of all God's People for me, and that you would lift up your Hearts to God for me, for the Pardon of my Sins, an Interest in Christ, and that I may be sanctified by the Spirit of God: But above all I commend my self to the infinite Mercy of God, in my dear Redeemer, begging and beseeching that through the Merits of his Blood I may this Day be with Him in Paradise.</P>
