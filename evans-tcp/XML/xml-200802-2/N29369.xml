<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT TO THE BOSTON EDITION.</HEAD>
<P>TO prevent disease by so simple and intel∣ligible an expedient, as a due attention to <HI>Diet</HI> and <HI>Regimen,</HI> should become the most universal as it surely is the most rational pur∣suit of every man who values health, and is desirous of prolonging life. A judicious book, calculated to assist him in that pursuit, is therefore entitled to preeminence in every man's library.</P>
<P>Books are not wanting which profess to teach us how to become our own physicians, when we are sick:—Indeed were we to cred∣it implicitly the numerous <HI>nostrums</HI> and <HI>spe∣cifics,</HI> so strongly commended by many writ∣ers on medical subjects, we might almost ven∣ture to question the ordinary principle of hu∣man infirmity, or man's mortality. Authors of that description have given great encour∣agement to art, by discountenancing the sug∣gestions of nature; and have furnished the means of creating diseases, instead of assisting in the purpose of <HI>cure</HI> or <HI>prevention.</HI> Before the present, no author had expressly under∣taken to instruct mankind in the faculty of shunning disease by means so simple as the regulation of Diet. This omission has prob∣ably been owing to an opinion, that the sub∣ject is too trivial and ordinary to authorize.
<PB N="vi" REF="039111_0004_10139E3CD23D0588"/>
grave discussion, and that a man must first be acquainted minutely with the animal func∣tions, before he should hazard an attempt to preserve them in order, or to rectify their de∣rangements. The fallacy of such an opinion is most clearly exposed in the present produc∣tion; and we may here be convinced, that the best and most effectual means of prolong∣ing life, and securing the blessings of health, are not only comprehensible, without the aid of great investigation, but practicable with∣out the necessity of great inconvenience or restraint. The rules contained in the present volumes are deduced from the most simple and obvious view of the subject; and al∣though they may exhibit nothing very mys∣terious or abstruse, we presume they are not therefore entitled to less credit or attention. In these sentiments, we would not be consid∣ered to doubt the profundity of the healing art; we only admire the simplicity of our author's plan, for rendering the intervention of that art superfluous and unnecessary.</P>
<P>It is true, indeed, the brute creation have no factitious guide to direct them in the per∣formance of their animal office; but nature, their only monitor, hath long since ceased to be the guide of man. She forsook him when he abandoned her, to pursue the enjoyments of society, on the road of excess and intem∣perance.</P>
<P>In the present highly improved state of society, when the efforts of talents are on the stretch, to discover new pleasures, new
<PB N="vii" REF="039111_0005_10139DFF5A40C3A0"/>
gratifications, it is not surprising that the line of sober enjoyment should be overlooked.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Much time, learning, and talent has been bestowed on the re∣searches, made into the causes of the late epidemic or endemic, or contagious fever, which has for a few years past desolated the cap∣itals of the United States. Hypotheses were broached, opinions formed, parties raised, but no cause found. What would the Amer∣ican faculty think, if, after so many inquiries, this mighty cause should be found resolvable in the <HI>vicious diet</HI> and <HI>incautious regimen</HI> peculiar to the Americans? Such are however the grounds of a very judicious treatise, written in French, and sent to the President of the United States, that he might render it pub∣lic. The author, who has resided several years in America, paints in strong colours the abuses of <HI>American diet,</HI> compares it minutely with the mode of living of other nations, especially those who live in the same latitudes, attributes all the autumnal diseases of the Americans, and namely their yellow fever, to that cause; and is surprised that it does not produce still greater and more frequent evils, in the capitals of America, where the abuse cannot be ex∣ceeded. Nor is the conclusion rash, when we find all foreigners, who visit this country, Frenchmen, Germans, and even Englishmen, exclaiming against <HI>our copious</HI> and <HI>everlasting</HI> dinners. Not that feasts and sumptuous entertainments are unknown in Europe, at which the rules of sobriety are trampled upon, but they are given on particular occasions only, whereas the ordinary of an American is an every day feast. Americans who have travelled abroad, know the truth of this observation. To indulge in a party, where excess must follow, once or twice a month, may hurt us; but to overload the stomach every day, must kill us in a very short time.</NOTE> Custom fortifies itself by appetites; it there∣fore requires no small degree of sagacity to discern, and firmness to abstain from those ex∣cesses, where reason, already seduced by the allurement of new dainties, readily yields to the fascinating form in which they are present∣ed to our senses. If it be an object of magni∣tude to correct the present perverted taste of mankind, and to revest pain with the power of self-defence, against a numerous train of mere artificial maladies, then may we venture to declare, that this work is justly entitled to more encomiums than we have faculty
<PB N="viii" REF="039111_0006_10139E3E581F3F48"/>
to bestow. Our Author, unlike many others of his profession, seems to have been less desirous to discover the occult prop∣erties of the various articles of sustenance, than to determine their effects, when applied to the human constitution.</P>
<P>It is, moreover, a circumstance, adding not a little to the value and utility of these volumes, that they are furnished with a minute and copious index, referring par∣ticularly to almost every substance, vege∣table or animal, in use among men, so that the reader may discover, almost by a single glance, the best rules by which to control his appetite, and the precise limits within which the inclination of his senses may be indulged with impunity.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>On the present State of Medicine as a Science.</HEAD>
<P>WE apparently live in an age, when every branch of human knowledge is reduced to a popular system; when the most important sciences lay aside the garb of pedantry and mysticism; when, in short, the sources of information are open to every rank, and to both sexes. An improvement, which is so conspicuous, must ultimately be attend∣ed with the most desirable and extensive effects.</P>
<P>Among other beneficial pursuits to render the comforts of life more numerous and per∣manent, we have occasion to observe, that Natural Philosophy and Chemistry contribute a principal share in spreading useful knowl∣edge among all ranks of society.</P>
<P>Since Medicine, considered as a science, which rests upon practical rules of experience, is in a great measure founded upon Natural Philosophy and Chemistry, it will be allow∣ed that with the daily progress of the lat∣ter, Medicine also must necessarily partake
<PB N="2" REF="039111_0032_10139E5F4033C5E8"/>
of their improvements, and continually re∣ceive accessions conducive to its further per∣fection.</P>
<P>With the progressive increase of refinement and luxury, a certain weakness and indispo∣sition, whether real or imaginary, has infest∣ed society in the character of a gentle epi∣demic. It cannot properly be called a dis∣ease, but rather an approximation to an in∣firm state, which almost involuntarily compels man to reflect upon the relative situation of his physical nature, to acquire correct ideas on health, disease, and the means of preven∣tion or relief, and thus imperceptibly to be∣come his own guide.</P>
<P>Every individual of any penetration now claims the privilege of being his own physician: It is not unfashionable to form a <HI>certain</HI> system concerning the state of our own health, and to consider it as the criterion, by which we may judge of ourselves and others, of patients and their physicians.</P>
<P>Formerly, people were not accustomed to think of the physical state of their body, until it began to be afflicted with pain or debility: In which case, they intrusted it to the practi∣tioner in Physic, as we deliver a time-piece to a watchmaker, who repairs it according to the best of his knowledge, without appre∣hending, that its owner will be at the trouble of thinking or reasoning upon the method, which he judged to be most proper.</P>
<P>In our times, we frequently undertake the charge of prescribing medicines for ourselves:
<PB N="3" REF="039111_0033_10139E231B8CE6F8"/>
And the natural consequence is, that we sel∣dom are able to tell, whether we are healthy or diseased; that we trust as much, if not more, to ourselves than to the physician, who is only sent for occasionally; and that we cannot conceive him to be perfectly free from the systems of the schools, from self-interest or professional motives. Thus, by an ac∣quaintance with medical subjects, which of it∣self is laudable, not only the skill of the phy∣sician is frequently thwarted, but the recov∣ery of the patient unhappily retarded, or at least rendered more difficult.</P>
<P>No disease is now cured without demon∣stration; and he who can neither discover nor comply with the peculiar system of health adopted by his patient, may indeed act from motives dictated by reason and humanity; but his success as a <HI>practical physician,</HI> in the common acceptation of that phrase, must ev∣er remain problematical. Yet this general pro∣pensity to investigate medical subjects, if it were properly directed and gratified might be at∣tended with very happy effects. For the medical art ought not to be subject to an im∣perious and fascinating demon, whose labours are chiefly carried on in the dark recesses of mystery, whom we know only from his bane∣ful influence, as he spares no objects of prey, and holds his votaries in a perpetual state of dependence!</P>
<P>"The veil of mystery," says a modern popular writer, "which still hangs over Med∣icine, renders it not only a conjectural, but even a suspicious art. This has been long ago
<PB N="4" REF="039111_0034_10139E61D96FF680"/>
removed from the other sciences, which in∣duces many to believe, that Medicine is a mere trick, and that it will not bear a fair and can∣did examination. Medicine, however, needs only to be <HI>better</HI> known, in order to secure the general esteem of mankind. Its precepts are such as every wise man would choose to observe, and it forbids nothing but what is incompatible with true happiness."</P>

<HEAD>Observations on the general Laws of Nature.</HEAD>
<P>IF we reflect upon the admirable uniformi∣ty which prevails through the works of na∣ture, both in the production and dissolution of matter, we find that she invariably moves in a circle; that in the perpetual construc∣tion, as well as in the subsequent demolition of bodies, she is always equally new and equally perfect; that the smallest particle, though invisible to our eyes, is usefully em∣ployed by her restless activity; that death itself, or the destruction of forms and figures, is no more than a careful decomposition and a designed regeneration of individual parts, in order to produce new substances, in a man∣ner no less skilful than surprising. We fur∣ther observe, that in the immense variety of things, in the inconceivable waste of elemen∣tary particles, there nevertheless prevails the strictest economy; that nothing is produced in vain, nothing cousumed without a cause. We clearly perceive that all nature is united
<PB N="5" REF="039111_0035_10139E24B8723DB8"/>
by indissoluble ties; that every thing exists for the sake of another, and that no one thing can exist without its neighbour. Hence we justly conclude, that man himself is not an insulated being, but that he is a necessary link in the great chain, which connects the universe.</P>
<P>Nature is our safest guide, and she will be so with greater certainty, as we become bet∣ter acquainted with her operations, especially with respect to those particulars which more nearly concern our physical existence. Thus, a source of many and extensive advantages will be opened; thus we shall approach to our original destination—namely, that of living long and healthy.</P>
<P>On the contrary, as long as we move in a limited sphere of knowledge; as long as we are unconcerned with respect to the causes which produce health or disease, we are in danger, either of being anxiously parsimoni∣ous, or prodigally profuse of those powers, by which life is supported. Both extremes are contrary to the purpose of nature. She teaches us the rule of just economy:—we, being a small part of her great system, must follow her example, and expend neither too much nor too little of her treasures.</P>
<P>Although it be true that our knowledge of nature is still very imperfect, yet this cir∣cumstance ought not to deter us from inves∣tigating the means which may lead to its im∣provement.</P>
<P>We are assisted by the experience of so many industrious inquirers, of so many sound
<PB N="6" REF="039111_0036_10139E646562C530"/>
philosophers, that we may flatter ourselves with the hopes of discovering some of her hidden secrets, and of penetrating still fur∣ther into her wonderful recesses. This, how∣ever, cannot be accomplished, without much patience and perseverance in the student.</P>
<P>All men, it is true, have not sufficient time and opportunities to acquire an accurate and extensive knowledge of nature; but those are inexcusable, who remain entire strang∣ers to her ordinary operations, and particu∣larly if they neglect to cultivate a proper ac∣quaintance with the constitution of their own frame. If, indeed, we were fixed to the earth like the trees by their roots, or if from mere animal instinct we were stimulated to inquire into the causes of our physical life, we then should vegetate, or live like plants or irrational animals. But, in the character of creatures, who ought to choose and to reject agreeably to the dictates of reason, a more as∣siduous and minute study of nature, as well as of our own frame, is indispensable; be∣cause the human body cannot subsist, unless we second her intentions and co-operate with her beneficent efforts.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Difference of Opinions on Medical Subjects.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not unfrequently objected, that Med∣icine itself is an uncertain, fluctuating, and precarious art. One medical school, for in∣stance, considers the mass of the fluids as the
<PB N="7" REF="039111_0037_10139E286E38AFF8"/>
primary cause of all diseases; another as∣cribes them to the irregular action of the sol∣ids, and particularly the nerves; some again consider that as the cause of the disorder, which many are inclined to represent as the effect. Thus, different schools propagate dif∣ferent tenets relative to the origin of dis∣eases; though ultimately, with respect to mat∣ters of fact, they must all necessarily agree. Nor is this diversity of opinions in the least degree detrimental to the practical depart∣ment of Medicine; provided that we do not regulate the mode of treatment altogether by hypothetical notions. Of what conse∣quence is it to the patient, whether his phy∣sician imagines the nerves to be fine tubes, filled with a subtle fluid, or not? whether he believes that catarrhs arise from noxious particles floating in the air, or from catching cold?—or whether he is prejudiced in favour of this or that particular theory of fevers?—It is a sufficient security to the patient, if his physician be thoroughly acquainted with the symptoms of the disease, and be able to dis∣tinguish them from those of any other mal∣ady. In this respect, the medical art is truly excellent, and without a rival; for the na∣ture of diseases remains invariably the same. The accurate observations made by Hippoc∣rates, two thousand years ago, on the pro∣gress and symptoms of diseases, recur to the medical practitioner of the present day, in a manner sufficiently regular and uniform.—And, in fact, how should it be otherwise; when nature always pursues the same path,
<PB N="8" REF="039111_0038_10139E66FB51F578"/>
whether in a healty or diseased state of the body?</P>
<P>Here again it will be asked, whence does it happen that two physicians seldom agree in opinion, with regard to the case of the same patient? This question may be briefly answered, by claiming the same right for the medical profession, which is assumed by theo∣logians in contested points of divinity; by lawyers in arguing any part of their code, which is not perfectly plain; and by philos∣ophers who maintain different opinions on the same subject in metaphysics; for instance, that of <HI>space</HI> and <HI>time.</HI> But there are more forcible reasons which enable us, in some measure, to account for this diversity of opin∣ions in Medicine. One of the physicians, perhaps, is in the habit of visiting fifty pa∣tients in a forenoon, so that he has not suf∣ficient time to investigate minutely the na∣ture and origin of the disease; while anoth∣er of less extensive practice is enabled to do more justice to his patients, by attending to their complaints with proper leisure and ac∣curacy. One of them shall distinguish some of the leading symptoms, and without hesi∣tation pronounce, that he has discovered the true seat of the malady; but as many diseas∣es of a different nature are attended with sim∣ilar and common symptoms, there is no small danger of confounding the one with the oth∣er. Another shall enter the patient's room with a pre-conceived opinion on the subject of some prevailing epidemic, or with his head probably full of the case which occupied his
<PB N="9" REF="039111_0039_10139E2C51A50F30"/>
attention in the last visit. With these im∣pediments, how difficult will it be to institute a cool and unbiassed inquiry? If, again, both should happen to be called in at different stages of the disorder, each of them would pre∣scribe a different method of cure, and the judgment of him who was last consulted, would in all probability be the most correct. Or lastly, a physician may be sent for, who, having commenced his studies about the mid∣dle of this century, has not (from want of time or inclination) sufficiently attended to the more recent discoveries of this inquisitive age; how can it then be expected, that he should agree in opinion with those, whose knowledge has been improved by the num∣berless new facts and observations lately made in physics, particularly in Chemistry?</P>

<HEAD>Origin and Causes of Disease.</HEAD>
<P>MAN is subject to the same destructive agents from without, by which the lower an∣imals are affected; but there is no doubt, that he is more easily and frequently exposed to diseases than these. <HI>First,</HI> The inferior crea∣tures are unquestionably provided with a more active instinct, by which nature teach∣es them, from their very birth, to avoid eve∣ry thing that may prove hurtful, and to choose whatever may have a salutary influ∣ence on their mode of living. Few traces of this beneficial instinct can be discovered in
<PB N="10" REF="039111_0040_10139E6AB4530CD0"/>
the human race. Our own experience, or the instructions of others, which are likewise founded upon experience, must gradually teach us the wholesome or pernicious quali∣ties of the objects of the material world.—Reason, indeed, that peculir faculty of man, indemnifies him, in a great measure, for the want of this instinct; it directs his choice in pursuing what is useful, and in avoiding what is injurious. Yet at the same time, the want of instinct in man, is the source of ma∣ny sufferings in the earlier years of his life.—He is born without covering, to withstand the effects of climate; without arms, to de∣fend himself in his helpless state, and without instinct, if we except that of sucking. He remains much longer incapable of providing, for his self-preservation, and stands in need of the assistance of his parents for a much greater number of years, than any other an∣imal with which we are acquainted. Al∣though his parents, in general, acquit them∣selves of this charge with much greater so∣licitude and tenderness than the lower ani∣mals, yet our imperfect instinct is productive of much mischief to children, from ignorance and ill directed tenderness in parents and nurses. Children are frequently furnished with articles of food and dress which, at a more advanced age, nourish the seeds of dis∣ease and dissolution. Thus, many infants are indebted for their obstructions in the mesen∣tery, and the consumptive habit attending them, to their uninformed and over anxious parents or friends, who commit daily errors
<PB N="11" REF="039111_0041_10139E2DD7AB72C0"/>
with regard to the quantity and quality of the aliment, which in many instances they so liberally administer to the objects of their care; even though it be of an indigestible nature.</P>
<P>In the <HI>second</HI> place, it is a fact universally admitted, that mankind, especially in large and populous towns, have much degenerated in bodily strength, energy of mind, and in their capacity of resisting the noxious agency of powers which affect them from without.</P>
<P>The progressive cultivation of the mind, together with the daily refinements of habits and manners, are ever accompanied with a proportionate increase of luxury. But as this change, from a robust to a more relaxed state of life, has produced no difference in the <HI>causes</HI> generating disease, to which we are even more subject than formerly, we must necessarily suffer by the concomitant <HI>effects.</HI> For though luxury has assisted us in prevent∣ing the temporary effects of external agents, such as cold, heat, rain, &amp;c. and we can oc∣casionally guard ourselves against their sever∣ity, we are, upon the next return of them, attacked with much greater violence, than if we had been more habituated to their influ∣ence. And this state of things has imper∣ceptibly introduced the use of many articles, both of dress and aliment, which in their consequences often prove detrimental to health. Hence we find, that in proportion as the refinements of luxury increase in a na∣tion, the number and variety of diseases also
<PB N="12" REF="039111_0042_10139E6C5D3B0840"/>
increase. On the contrary, the more unciv∣ilized a people continue, and the more their habits and customs approximate to a state of nature, the less are they affected by the causes of disease.</P>
<P>In the <HI>third</HI> place, we observe among the human race a greater number of prevailing passions, and man is more violently, and, for the time of their duration, more obstinately governed by them, than any other living creature. These emotions variously affect the human body. But the most noxious and oppressive than any other of all the passions, are <HI>terror</HI> and <HI>grief:</HI> The former of which is sometimes so violent as to threaten immedi∣ate destruction. Controlled by their power∣ful influence, and hurried away by the im∣pulse of the moment, the mind is rendered incapable of judging, and of properly select∣ing the means of allaying those passions.—Hence the remedies, to which we have re∣course during the prevalence of passion, and which then appear to us the most proper, frequently lay the foundation of innumera∣ble disorders, both of body and mind.</P>
<P>A <HI>fourth</HI> source of diseases among mankind, are various specific contagions; and perhaps the greater number of these originate in the atmosphere which surrounds us. This is highly probable, at least with respect to marshy exhalations, and the effluvia of re∣gions rendered unwholesome by different manufacturing processes. Another class of contagious miasmata consists of those which cannot be traced to any certain origin. In∣deed,
<PB N="13" REF="039111_0043_10139E316F55B8B8"/>
we daily observe their migrations; we perceive them moving from one individual to another, without fixing any stationary res∣idence: Yet they have hitherto frustrated ev∣ery attempt made towards their extirpation. Of this unsettled nature are, the small pox, the measles, the hooping cough, the influen∣za, and many other epidemics. The first of them, namely the small pox, has of late years been very successfully treated; and it is well known that some of the most ingenious practitioners in Italy and Germany are, at this moment, employed in a serious attempt, wholly to extirpate this contagion from the Continent of Europe; an object which has formerly been accomplished in the cases of the plague and leprosy.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The means employed by our ancestors, in subduing the viru∣lence of these malignant disorders, consisted chiefly in separating ev∣ery infected person from the healthy, and preventing all intercourse between them. For this purpose, many thousand houses of recep∣tion were then established and supported at the public expense, in every country of Europe; the diseased were instantly and carefully removed to those houses, and not permitted to leave them till per∣fectly cured. A measure somewhat similar to this has lately been proposed, and laid before the Plenipotentiaries of the Continental Powers assembled at Rastadt, by Professor Junker, Dr. Faust, and other German Physicians. This proposal, however, differs essen∣tially from the former method of extirpating contagious disorders: as, according to the modern plan, we understand every individual, whether willing or not, must submit to be inoculated for the small-pox.</P>
<P>To deprive this loathsome disease of its destructive power, ano∣ther method, perhaps more plausible and less compulsory, has been lately attempted in this country, and strongly recommended by Drs. JENNER, PEARSON, WOODVILLE, and other practitioners. I allude to the inoculation for the <HI>cow-pox.</HI> It is sincerely to be wished, that their humane efforts may be crowned with success: and if it be true that persons inoculated for the cow-pox are <HI>forever</HI> ex∣empt from the infection of the <HI>small-pox,</HI> and that this artificial translation of morbid matter from the brute to the human subject is not attended with danger, it is of little consequence whether the cow-pox originate from any cutaneous disease of the milker, or from the grease of horses. For my part, I am not very sanguine in my expectations, which have often been disappointed on similar occa∣sions; and till I can persuade myself of the perfect analogy subsist∣ing between the two diseases, nay of their homogeneous nature, I shall patiently wait for a greater number of facts tending to con∣firm the truth of the hypothesis. This, however, in my opinion, can be decided only, when the <HI>small-pox</HI> should appear as the <HI>pre∣vailing epidemic.</HI></P></NOTE></P>

<HEAD>On the Doctrine of Temperaments.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE it is established by numberless facts, that the temperaments, as well as the dis∣eases, of whole nations, are in a great meas∣ure influenced by their ordinary articles of food, it will no longer be doubted, that the most important consequences result from our aliment, whether of food or drink.</P>
<P>As the <HI>doctrine of temperaments</HI> is in itself highly curious and interesting, I think this a proper place for introducing some practi∣cal remarks, tending to illustrate that sub∣ject, and presenting a concise view of it, chiefly derived from the learned annotations of the celebrated Professor Sömmering of Mayence.</P>
<P>"The doctrine of temperaments," says he, "in the general acceptation of that term, must be allowed to have greatly misled the ancient physicians, and particularly those who lived before the time of <HI>Galen.</HI> We are not, however, to infer from this, that
<PB N="15" REF="039111_0045_10139E32F4F6A3B8"/>
the doctrine itself is without foundation.—They erred not, by admitting the existence of temperaments; for that seems now to be fully established; but by too great a fond∣ness for <HI>generalization;</HI> by limiting the num∣ber of them to <HI>four,</HI> and fixing their atten∣tion in this division simply on the nature and composition of the blood, instead of re∣garding the whole animal economy. Thus, for instance, they knew many parts of the human body scarcely by their names, and were little, if at all, acquainted with the great influence of the nerves; while our modern physicians pay an almost extravagant homage to these fashionable co-operators in diseases, and frequently forget, in their attention to their favourites, the more important, at least more obvious, parts of the fluids.</P>
<P>"There is a certain line observable in all the more perfect animals, by which nature is regulated in performing the functions of body and mind; in preserving or impair∣ing the health, and in exerting all those en∣ergies of life, on which the happiness of the creature depends. This line is various in different individuals, and the variety cannot be completely explained on the principle of the ancients, by a difference in the qualities of the blood alone; though a human body of moderate size contains not less than thir∣ty pounds weight of that fluid. Other terms must therefore be substituted for their <HI>san∣guine, choleric, phlegmatic,</HI> and <HI>melancholy</HI> tem∣peraments; but before we attempt them, it
<PB N="16" REF="039111_0046_10139E717A3A6EE0"/>
will be necessary to take a more extensive view of the economy of man.</P>
<P>"The causes of the difference of temper∣aments are various: <HI>First;</HI> a difference in the nervous system, with respect to the num∣ber of the nervous fibres, their strength, and sensibility. A large brain, coarse and strong nerves, and great general sensibility, have always been found to be the marks of a <HI>choleric</HI> or <HI>cholerico-sanguine</HI> disposition. Hence proceeds the quickness of perception and capacity of knowledge in persons of this class, accompanied with great acuteness and strength of judgment, from the multitude of their ideas of comparison. These quali∣ties are, however, in some measure counter∣balanced by a violent propensity to anger, and impatience under slight sufferings of body or mind. Medicines ought, therefore, to be cautiously administered to them, and in small quantities only. A diminutive brain and very delicate nerves have generally been observed to be connected with dull senses, and a phlegmatic languor—sometimes with a taint of melancholy. To affect the organs of such persons, the impression of external objects must be strong and permanent. Their judgments are often childish from the want of ideas, and hence they are seldom able to make great progress in science. They are, however, more fit to endure labour, and the injuries of climate; consequently their med∣icines should be strong, and administered in large quantities.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="039111_0047_10139E3577E72840"/>
"<HI>Secondly:</HI> Difference of irritability is another cause of difference of temperament. When the fibres are excited by the slightest stimulus to quick and permanent contrac∣tion, we may justly infer the existence of a choleric disposition; while a phlegmatic tem∣per displays itself by opposite symptoms; the muscles being slowly contracted, and excit∣ed with difficulty by the most powerful stim∣ulus.</P>
<P>"<HI>Thirdly:</HI> The fibres and membranes of a phlegmatic person are remarkably soft to the touch; those of a melancholic person hard and dry, with greater tone and facility of contraction.</P>
<P>"<HI>Fourthly:</HI> There appears to be sufficient reason for the opinion, that an <HI>electric</HI> prin∣ciple is dispersed through the atmosphere, which is communicated to the body, in dif∣ferent degrees, by respiration; which sup∣plies the fibres with their natural tone; gives a more lively motion to the vessels; and increases the serenity of the mind. This principle does not exist in the atmosphere in equal quantities in all countries, nor even in the same country at different seasons or hours of the day. Thus, during the influ∣ence of the <HI>Sirocco</HI> in <HI>Sicily,</HI> all the fibres are oppressed by languor; but when the air be∣comes more serene and elastic, the natural energy of body and mind returns. All men do not inspire this electric matter in equal quantities, and thus a remarkable difference of temperament is produced.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="039111_0048_10139E7411B0B790"/>
"<HI>Fifthly:</HI> To these causes must be added the different nature and quantity of the blood. Thus, when the blood is highly stimulant, the heart is excited to more vio∣lent action; an increased secretion of bile promotes the vermicular motion, and a su∣perfluity of mucus disposes to catarrh, &amp;c. From these considerations it is evident, that there are causes sufficiently powerful to pro∣duce, at a very early period of life, an unal∣terable predisposition to a certain tempera∣ment. That a complete change is ever ef∣fected, from a choleric habit, for instance, to a phlegmatic, cannot be consistently ad∣mitted, at least while the laws of nature re∣main unalterable. I will, however, admit that the temperaments, though not com∣pletely changed, may be modified;—that the vehemence of some, and the languor of others, may to a certain degree be lessened; but this must be done by remedies suited to the class of the causes productive of a partic∣ular temperament. Of these the principal are:</P>
<P N="1">1. A different regimen. Thus animal food imparts the highest degree of strength to the organs, enlivens the senses, and often occasions a degree of ferocity; as is evident in cannibals, in carnivorous animals in gen∣eral, in butchers and their dogs, in hunters, particularly when aided by the frequent use of spices, wines, and stimulating medicines. Vegetable diet, on the contrary, diminishes the irritability and sensibility of the system;
<PB N="19" REF="039111_0049_10139EB622E90300"/>
in a word, renders it phlegmatic.—Some authors indeed have considered potatoes as being the means of contributing to that end; but I am not inclined to subscribe to this doctrine; since I have had occasion to ob∣serve the lively temperament of the common people in Ireland.—Yet attention to this is highly necessary in those, who have the charge of children; as by the use of animal food, additional energy may be given to the fibres, and when their irritability is too great, it may be diminished by an opposite regimen.</P>
<P N="2">"2. Education, both physical and moral, is another cause of alteration in the temper∣ament of man. Its power is almost un∣bounded, especially in the more early peri∣ods of life; and hence it often happens, that whole nations seem to possess one com∣mon temperament.</P>
<P N="3">"3. Climate, in its most extensive sense, comprehending atmosphere and soil, is a third cause of alteration. The activity and acuteness of a choleric habit are seldom to be found in a region of perpetual fog; as for instance, in Holland. They are the natural produce of a warm climate, and require a gentle elevation of surface, with a moderately moist soil, and a serene, equal atmosphere.</P>
<P N="4">"4. I have often observed an astonishing degree of activity communicated to the whole system, by an ardent desire of learn∣ing; so that the temperament seemed to re∣ceive new life from every accession of knowl∣edge.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="20" REF="039111_0050_10139E77A9760768"/>
"5. The want of the necessaries of life, on the one hand, or possession of the means of luxury on the other, variously modify the disposition;—and the liveliness of the temperament is also observed to rise or fall, according to the degree of political freedom.</P>
<P N="6">"6. Age, company, and professional du∣ties greatly affect the temperament. Hence we seldom find any one who, at 56 years of age, retains the activity of that choleric or sanguine habit which he possessed at 36.</P>
<P>"Those who follow nature, and not a plausible hypothesis, will be sensible how dif∣ficult it is to classify and fix the characteristic marks of the different temperaments; and it is rather a matter of doubt, whether the following rude sketch will be more success∣ful than the attempts of others.</P>
<P>"All the modifications of temperaments appear to be varieties of the <HI>sanguine</HI> and <HI>phlegmatic.</HI></P>
<P N="1">"1. The sanguine is variable. It is mark∣ed by a lively complexion; the vessels are full of blood; and persons of this habit are seldom able to bear great warmth; they are predisposed to inflammations, and possess a high degree of irritability and sensibili∣ty. All is voluptuous in this temperament. They are sickle in every thing they under∣take; are affable, and soon become acquaint∣ed, but as soon forget their friends, and are suspicious of every body. Whatever re∣quires industry they abhor, and hence make little progress in science, till they advance in age.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="21" REF="039111_0051_10139EB8B269F1E0"/>
"2. The sanguineo-choleric enjoys all the health and serenity of the sanguine, with all the perseverance of the choleric.</P>
<P N="3">"3. In the choleric, the body is soft and flexible, without being dry and meagre as in the melancholic; the skin has a teint of yel∣low; the hair is red; the eyes dark and moderately large, with a penetrating expres∣sion, and frequently a degree of wildness; the pulse full and quick; the muscular con∣tractions in walking, speaking, &amp;c. are rapid; the bile is copious and acrid, and hence the vermicular motion is active, and the body not liable to costiveness. Persons of this class are particularly fond of animal food. They possess great magnanimity, are fitted for laborious undertakings, and seem born to command.</P>
<P N="4">"4. He whose temperament is hypochon∣driacal, is a burthen to himself and others. Persons of this class are subject to diseases of the liver, and hence have a sallow complex∣ion. They are never content with their sit∣uation, and are a prey to envy and sus∣picion.</P>
<P N="5">"5. The melancholic temperament is marked by a gloomy countenance, small, hol∣low, blinking eyes, black hair, a rigid or tough skin, dry and meagre fibres. The pulse is weak and languid, the bile black, the vermicular motion slow. The percep∣tions of persons of this disposition are quick; they are fond of contemplation, and are slow in the execution of labour, which they pa∣tiently undertake. They bear with resolu∣tion
<PB N="22" REF="039111_0052_10139E7A432F46F0"/>
the troubles of life; and, though not ensily provoked, are nevertheless vindictive.</P>
<P N="6">"6. The <HI>Boeotic</HI> or rustic temperament has many of the qualities of the sanguine, in common with many of those of the phleg∣matic. The body is brawny, the muscles have but little irritability, the nerves are dull, the manners rude, and the powers of apprehension weak.</P>
<P N="7">"7. The gentle temperament is a combi∣nation of the sanguine, choleric, and phleg∣matic. Universal benevolence is the distin∣guishing character of this class. Their man∣ners are soft and unruffled. They hate talk∣ativeness; and if they apply to science, their progress is great, as they are persevering and contemplative. Lastly,</P>
<P N="8">"8. The phlegmatic class is marked by a soft, white skin, prominent eyes, a weak pulse, and languid gait. They speak slowly, are little hurt by the injuries of the weather, submit to oppression, and seem born to obey. From their little irritability, they are not easily provoked, and soon return to their natural state of indifference and apathy."</P>

<HEAD>On Patent or Quack Medicines.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH there is but one state of perfect health, yet the deviations from it, and the genera and species of diseases, are almost in∣finite. It will hence, without difficulty, be understood, that in the classes of medical re∣medies
<PB N="23" REF="039111_0053_10139EBA37185EC0"/>
there must likewise be a great varie∣ty, and that some of them are even of oppo∣site tendencies. Such are both the warm and the cold bath, considered as medical remedies. Though opposite to each other in their sensible effects, each of them mani∣fests its medical virtue, yet only in such a state of the body as will admit of using it with advantage.</P>
<P>It is evident from these premises, that an universal remedy, or one that possesses heal∣ing powers for the cure of <HI>all</HI> diseases, is in fact a nonentity, the existence of which is physically impossible, as the mere idea of it involves a direct contradiction. How, for instance, can it be conceived, that the same remedy should be capable of restoring the tone of the fibres, when they are relaxed, and also have the power of relaxing them when they are too rigid; that it should coagulate the fluids when in a state of re∣solution, and again attenuate them when they are too viscid; that it should moderate the nerves in a state of preternatural sensibil∣ity, and likewise restore to them their prop∣er degree of irritability, when they are in a contrary state.</P>
<P>Indeed, the belief in an universal remedy appears to lose ground every day, even among the vulgar, and has been long ex∣ploded in those classes of society, which are not influenced by prejudice, or tinctured with fanaticism. It is, however, sincerely to be regretted, that we are still inundated
<PB N="24" REF="039111_0054_10139E7BC84733A0"/>
with a flood of advertisments in almost ev∣ery newspaper; that the lower and less en∣lightened classes of the community are still imposed upon by a set of privileged impos∣tors, who frequently puzzle the intelligent reader to decide, whether the boldness or the industry with which they endeavour to establish the reputation of their respective poisons, be the most prominent feature in their character.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>To illustrate this proposition farther, I shall quote the sensible remarks of a late writer, Mr. JAMES PARKINSON, who expresses himself, in his "<HI>Medical Admonitions,</HI>" when treating on the subject of Catarrh, in the following pertinent words:</P>
<P>"Most of the Nostrums advertised as <HI>cough drops,</HI> &amp;c. are prepa∣rations of opium, similar to the paregoric elixir of the shops, but disguised and rendered more deleterious, by the addition of aro∣matic and heating gums. The injury which may be occasioned by the indiscriminate employment of such medicines, in this disease, may be very considerable; as is well known by every person possessing even the smallest share of medical knowledge.</P>
<P>"It would undoubtedly be rendering a great benefit to society, if some medical man were to convince the ignorant of the pernicious con∣sequences of their reliance on advertised Nostrums: but, unfortu∣nately, the situation in which medical men stand is such, that their best-intentioned and most disinterested exertions for this purpose would not only be but little regarded, but frequently would be even imputed to base and invidious motives. Those to whom they have to address their admonitions are unhappily those on whom reason has least influence. "Prithee, Doctor," said an old acquaintance to a celebrated empiric, who was standing at his door, "how is it that you, whose origin I so well know, should have been able to obtain more patients than almost all the regular-bred physicians?"—"Pray," says the Quack, "how many persons may have passed us whilst you put your question?"—"About twenty."—"And, pray, how many of those do you suppose possessed a competent share of common sense?"—"Perhaps one out of twenty."—"Just so," says the Doctor; "and that one applies to the regular physician, whilst I and my brethren pick up the other nineteen."—P. 327 and 328.</P></NOTE>—It was justly observed by the sagacious and comprehensive Bacon, "that a reflecting physician is not directed
<PB N="25" REF="039111_0055_10139EBCE8FBF568"/>
by the opinion which the multitude entertain of a favourite remedy; but that he must be guided by a sound judgment; and conse∣quently he is led to make very important distinctions between those things, which only by their name pass for medical remedies, and others which in reality possess healing pow∣ers."</P>
<P>I am induced to avail myself of this quota∣tion, as it indirectly censures the conduct of <HI>certain</HI> medical practitioners, who do not scru∣ple to recommend what are vulgarly called Patent and other Quack medicines, <HI>the compo∣sition of which is carefully concealed from the pub∣lic.</HI> Having acquired their ill-merited repu∣tation by mere chance, and being supported by the most refined artifices, in order to de∣lude the unwary, we are unable to come at the evidence of perhaps nine-tenths of those who have experienced their fatal effects, and who are now no longer in a situation to com∣plain.</P>
<P>The transition from <HI>Panaceas,</HI> or universal remedies, to <HI>Nostrums</HI> or <HI>Specifics,</HI> such, for in∣stance, as pretend to cure the <HI>same</HI> disease in <HI>every</HI> patient, is easy and natural. With the latter also, impositions of a dangerous tenden∣cy are often practised. It will probably be asked here, how far they are practically ad∣missible, and in what cases they are wholly unavailing. It is not very difficult to answer this question. In those diseases, which in ev∣ery instance depend upon the same cause, at in agues, the small-pox, measles, and many other contagious distempers, the possibility of
<PB N="26" REF="039111_0056_10139E7E539BDA08"/>
specifics, in a limited sense, may be rationally, though <HI>hypothetically,</HI> admitted. But in other maladies, the causes of which depend upon a variety of concurrent circumstances, and the cure of which, in different individuals, fre∣quently requires very opposite remedies, as in the Dropsy, the various species of Colic, the almost infinite variety of Consumptions, &amp;c. &amp;c. a specific remedy is an impudent burlesque upon the common sense of mankind. Those who are but imperfectly acquainted with the various causes from which the same disorder originates in different individuals, can never entertain such a vulgar and dan∣gerous notion. They will easily perceive, how much depends upon ascertaining with precision the seat and cause of the affection, before any medicine can be prescribed with advantage of safety:—even life and death, I am concerned to say, are too often decided by the <HI>first steps</HI> of him, who offers or intrudes his advice upon a suffering friend.</P>
<P>The following instances will shew the dan∣ger attending the precipitate application of the same medicine in similar disorders.—A person violently troubled with the colic took a glass of juniper spirits, commonly called Hollands, from which he received almost in∣stantaneous relief, as the affection proceeded from flatulency. Another person, who found himself attacked with similar pains, was in∣duced by the example of his friend to try the same expedient; he took it without hesita∣tion, and died in a few hours after.—No wonder that the consequences here were fatal,
<PB N="27" REF="039111_0057_10139EC06D4F1348"/>
as the colic in the latter case was owing to an inflammation in the intestines.—A third person was afflicted with a colic, arising from poisonous mushrooms, which he had inad∣vertently swallowed; the immediate admin∣istration of an emetic, and after it, some di∣luted vegetable acid, restored him to health. A fourth person had an attack of this malady from an <HI>encysted hernia</HI> or inward rupture. The emetic, which relieved the former pa∣tient, necessarily proved fatal to the latter; for it burst the bag of inclosed matter, pour∣ed the contents within the cavities of the ab∣domen, and thus speedily terminated his exist∣ence. Again, another had by mistake made use of arsenic, which occasioned violent pains, not unlike those of a common colic. A large quantity of sweet oil taken internally was the means of his preservation; whereas the rem∣edies employed in the other cases would have been totally ineffectual. Here I willingly close a narrative, the recital of which cannot but excite the most painful sensations. To lengthen the illustration would lead me too far beyond my prescribed limits: for cases of this nature happen so frequently, that it would be easy to extend the account of them, by a long catalogue of interesting but fatal acci∣dents.</P>
<P>What is more natural than to place confi∣dence in a remedy, which we have known to afford relief to others in the same kind of af∣fection? The patient anxiously inquires after a person who has been afflicted with the same malady. He is eager to learn the remedy
<PB N="28" REF="039111_0058_10139E80F52F5B40"/>
that has been used with success. His friend or neighbour imparts to him the wished-for intelligence. He is determined to give it a fair trial, and takes it with confidence. From what has been stated, it will not be difficult to conceive, that if his case does not exactly correspond with that of his friend, any <HI>chance remedy</HI> may be extremely dangerous, and even fatal.</P>
<P>The physician is obliged to employ all his sagacity, supported by his own experience, as well as by that of his predecessors; and, nevertheless, is often under the temporary necessity of discovering from the progress of the disease, what he could not derive from the minutest researches. How then can it be expected, that a novice in the art of healing should be more successful, when the whole of his method of cure is either the impulse of the moment, or the effect of his own credu∣lity? It may be therefore truly said, that life and death are frequently intrusted to chance.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The late Dr. HUXHAM, a physician of great celebrity, in speak∣ing of <HI>Asclepiades,</HI> the Roman empiric, says: "This man from a <HI>de∣claimer</HI> turned <HI>physician,</HI> and set himself up to oppose all the physicians of his time; and the novelty of the thing bore him out, as it fre∣quently doth the <HI>Quacks</HI> of the present time; and ever will, <HI>whilst the majority of the world are fools.</HI>"</P>
<P>In another place, Dr. Huxham thus curiously contrasts the too timid practice of some regular physicians, with the hazardous treat∣ment, which is the leading feature of Quacks; "The timid, low, in∣sipid practice of some, is almost as dangerous as the bold, unwarranted empiricism of others; time and opportunity, never to be regained, are often lost by the former; whilst the latter, by a <HI>bold push,</HI> sends you off the <HI>stage</HI> in a moment."</P></NOTE></P>
<P>From what has been premised, it may be confidently asserted, that a nostrum or an universal remedy is as great a <HI>desideratum</HI> as
<PB N="29" REF="039111_0059_10139EC304199B38"/>
the philosopher's stone. The absurd idea of an universal medicine can only obtain credit with the weak, the credulous, or the igno∣rant.</P>
<P>One of the most unfortunate circumstances in the history of such medicines, is the insin∣uating and dangerous method, by which they are <HI>puffed</HI> into notice. And as we hear little of the baneful effects which they daily must produce, by being promiscuously applied, peo∣ple attend only to the extraordinary instan∣ces, perhaps not one in fifty, where they have afforded a temporary or apparent relief. It is well known, that the more powerful a remedy is, the more permanent and danger∣ous must be its effects on the constitution; especially if it be introduced like many Patent. Medicines, by an almost indefinite increase of the doses.</P>
<P>There is another consideration, not apt to strike those who are unacquainted with the laws of animal economy.—When we intend to bring about any remarkable change in the system of an organized body, we are obliged to employ such means as may contribute to produce that change, without affecting too violently the <HI>living powers;</HI> or without ex∣tending their action to an improper length. Indeed, the patient may be gradually habitu∣ated to almost any stimulus, but at the expense of palsied organs, and a broken constitution.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>An Italian Count, uncommonly fond of swallowing medicines, found at length that he could take no more. Previous to his death he ordered the following inscription to be placed on his tomb:</P>
<P>"<HI>I was once healthy; I wished to be better; I took medicine, and died.</HI>"</P></NOTE>
<PB N="30" REF="039111_0060_10139E84933E8380"/>
Such are the melancholy effects of imposture and credulity! Were it possible to collect all the cases of sacrifices to this mysterious infat∣uation, it is probable that their number would exceed the enormous havoc made by gun-powder or the sword.</P>
<P>A popular writer, Dr. BUCHAN, makes the following just remark on the subject in ques∣tion: "As matters stand at present," says he, "it is easier to cheat a man out of his life, than of a shilling, and almost impossible either to detect or punish the offender. Notwith∣standing this, people still shut their eyes, and take every thing upon trust, that is adminis∣tered by any pretender to Medicine, with∣out daring to ask him a reason for any part of his conduct. Implicit faith, every where else the object of ridicule, is still sacred here."</P>

<HEAD>Analysis of Fashionable Complaints.</HEAD>
<P>If these abuses of medicine be of conse∣quence, how much more so are certain man∣ners, habits, and customs, which the united efforts of the Faculty will never effectually remove or suppress, unless assisted by the fe∣male guardians of helpless infancy. That I may not be misunderstood with respect to the real intention of this address to the fair sex, I beg leave previously to observe, that the fol∣lowing remarks apply chiefly to certain class∣es of the community, among whom a due degree of attention is but rarely paid to the skin of their offspring.</P>
<P>The greater number of our fashionable complaints and affections are nearly related
<PB N="31" REF="039111_0061_10139EC489314580"/>
to each other. The gout, formerly a regular but rare disease, which attacked only the ex∣ternal parts of persons advanced in years, has now become a constitutional indisposition, a juvenile complaint, torturing the patient in a thousand different forms. The famous <HI>Poda∣gra</HI> and <HI>Chiragra</HI> of our ancestors are now nearly obsolete, and instead of the gout in the <HI>feet</HI> or <HI>hands,</HI> we hear every day of the nerv∣ous gout, the gout in the <HI>head,</HI> and even the fatal gout in the <HI>stomach.</HI> No rank, no age, no mode of life seems to be exempt from this fashionable enemy.—The next and still more general malady of the times, is <HI>an extreme sen∣sibility to every change of the atmosphere; or rath∣er, a constantly sensible relation to its influence.</HI> We are not only more subject to be affected with every current of air, every change of heat and cold, but the feelings of some are so exquisitely delicate, that in a close apartment, nay in bed, they can determine with accura∣cy the state of the weather, as well as the di∣rection of the wind. By consulting their bodily sensations, these <HI>living barometers</HI> an∣nounce more correctly than the artificial ones, not only the present, but even the future changes of the weather. I could never have believed, that this additional sense, which is only of modern origin, could be so much im∣proved, had I not frequently witnessed the sensations of certain patients, when a cloud is floating over their heads:—a talent so pe∣culiar to our age, that it would undoubtedly excite surprise, but no envy, in our less refined forefathers. In a climate, where the weather
<PB N="32" REF="039111_0062_10139E8618E058E0"/>
changes every day, and almost every hour, it may be easily imagined, how dependent, frail, and transitory, must be the health of the wretched possessors of this <HI>new</HI> sense; and that beings so organized cannot warrant, for a single hour, their state of health, their good-humour, or their physical existence. Is it not then very probable, that many strange and in∣consistent events of our days may have their secret foundation in this dependence on the weather?—In judging of man and his actions, we ought first to observe the state of the ba∣rometer; as our more superstitious ancestors made the celestial constellations the criterion in their prognostics.</P>
<P>Not less characteristic of the present gener∣ation, but more painful, are the fashionable nervous and hypochondriacal diseases. These are formidable, insidious tormentors, which not only destroy our physical well-being, but also envenom our tranquillity and content∣ment, and cloud our fairest prospects of hap∣piness. Without depriving us of life, they render it an insupportable burthen; without inducing death, they make him a welcome visitor.</P>
<P>It is unnecessary to detail the diversified shapes, in which these maladies present them∣selves. Let it suffice to observe, than however intimately the mind appears to be connected with these phenomena, we can nevertheless account for them from physical causes. They have rapidly increased with the propagation of the gout, and experience shews, that they frequently alternate with it, in the same in∣dividual
<PB N="33" REF="039111_0063_10139EC71B66C158"/>
patient. It is highly probable, there∣fore, that they are of a similar nature with the gout; and that they originate from the same source, which is peculiar to our age. Closely connected with the gout, and likewise with the hypochondriasis, how frequently do we observe the haemorrhoids, formerly a dis∣ease of the aged, now the companion of youth, and almost a general complaint.</P>
<P>The last class of our fashionable diseases in∣cludes all those affections of the skin, which are known by the name of <HI>eruptions, discolora∣tions, efflorescences, scorbutic taints,</HI> &amp;c. Of late, these have alarmingly increased, and appear daily to spread every where, like noxious weeds. Even in the higher ranks, where neither a poor diet, nor want of attention to cleanliness, can be assigned as causes, we fre∣quently observe persons, whose skin announces bad health, and on whom medicine can have no effect. Physicians of different countries complain of new and unheard-of cutaneous disorders, of an extremely malignant tenden∣cy; and if the spreading of them be not check∣ed in time, Europe will perhaps once more be visited with that malignant and filthy dis∣ease, the Leprosy.</P>
<P>It is however not sufficient to give a bare catalogue of these singular affections. I shall, therefore, attempt to trace them to their source; to shew that they can be easily pre∣vented; and to point out the most likely means by which so desirable an event may be accomplished.—It is to you, guardians of fu∣ture, and I hope hardier races, that I now ap∣peal

<HEAD>On the Nature and Functions of the Skin.</HEAD>
<P>Much as we hear and speak of <HI>bathing,</HI> and of the great attention at present paid to clean∣liness, I am bold to affirm, that the greater number, if not the whole of our fashionable complaints, originate from the want of care and proper management of the <HI>skin.</HI> Through unpardonable neglect in the earlier part of life, especially at the age of adolescence, the surface of the body is so unnaturally enervat∣ed by constant relaxation, that it oppresses, and, as it were, confines our mental and bod∣ily faculties; promotes the general disposition towards the complaints above alluded to; and, if not counteracted in time, must pro∣duce consequences still more alarming and deplorable.</P>
<P>We often hear people complain, that <HI>their skin is uneasy;</HI> a complaint, which I fear is but too prevalent among those, who give them∣selves little trouble to inquire into its origin.—But how is it possible, I hear many persons ask, that the skin, which is a mere covering of the body, to shelter it from rain and sun∣shine, can have such influence over the whole frame? I shall venture to explain this problem, and hope to impress such as are inclined to be sceptical, with more respect for that part of the human body.</P>
<P>The skin unites in itself three very essential functions. It is the organ of the most exten∣sive
<PB N="35" REF="039111_0065_10139EC9E8D90030"/>
and useful sense, that of <HI>touch;</HI> it is the channel of <HI>perspiration,</HI> the principal means which Nature employs to purify our fluids; and through the most admirable organization, is enabled to <HI>absorb</HI> certain salutary parts of the surrounding atmosphere, and to guard us against the influence of others of an injurious tendency. For this purpose, innumerable nerves and vessels are dispersed throughout the skin, which are in the continual act of feeling, and at the same time of secreting and volatilizing noxious particles, and absorbing those containing vital principles. It has been proved by accurate calculations, that the most healthy individual daily and insensibly per∣spires upwards of three pounds weight of su∣perfluous and hurtful humours. It may therefore be confidently asserted, that no part of the body is provided with so many and important organs, by which it is connected with almost every operation performed in an∣imal life, as the skin. It is this, which places us in the most immediate connexion with the surrounding atmosphere, which through that channel particularly affects us, and exerts its influence on our health:—we further feel, directly through the skin, the qualities of the air, heat, cold, pressure, rarefaction, &amp;c.: and hence we experience, at least in their influ∣ence, other much more subtle and less known qualities, of which I shall only mention the electric and magnetic fluids. From the spir∣itual and highly penetrating nature of these fluids, we may easily conjecture, how consid∣erable a share they must have in the princi∣ple
<PB N="36" REF="039111_0066_10139E8C47BABAB0"/>
of vitality, and of what important use the organ is, through which they affect us.</P>
<P>Important as the skin is to external life, it is no less so to the internal economy of the body, where it appears to be peculiarly de∣signed to preserve the great equilibrium of the different systems, by which the human frame is supported in its vital, animal, and sexual functions.—If any stagnation, accumu∣lation, or irregularity arise in the fluids, the skin is the great and ever-ready conductor, through which the superfluous particles are separated, the noxious volatilized, and the fluids, stagnating in their course, set at liber∣ty; a canal being at the same time opened for the removal of those humours which, if they should get access to the vital parts, such as the heart and the brain, would cause inev∣itable destruction. By the proper exercise of this organ, many diseases may be suppressed in their early stages; and those which have already taken place may be most effectually removed. No disease whatever can be re∣moved without the co-operation of the skin. The nature and constitution of this organ most certainly determine either our hope or ap∣prehension for the safety of the patient. In the most dangerous inflammatory fevers, when the prospect of recovery is very faint, a beneficial change of the skin is the only effort, by which Nature, almost overcome, relieves herself, and ejects the poison in a surprising manner, fre∣quently in the course of one night. The greatest art of a physician, indeed, consists in the proper management of this extensive or∣gan,
<PB N="37" REF="039111_0067_10139ECD7679E088"/>
and in regulating its activity, where oc∣casion requires. To mention only one cir∣cumstance; it is well known to those who have experienced the beneficial effects of a simple blister, that its stimulus, like a charm, has frequently relieved the most excruciating pains and spasms in the internal parts.</P>
<P><HI>Cleanliness, flexibility</HI> and <HI>activity</HI> of the skin are, according to the observations premised, the principal requisites to the health of indi∣viduals, as well as of whole nations. But in∣stead of contributing to its improvement, we generally pay very little attention to it, ex∣cept to the skin of the face and hands, which are too often made the <HI>fallacious</HI> index of health. I am convinced, however, that most of the patients and valetudinarians, who take so much pains to refresh and fortify the <HI>inter∣nal</HI> parts of their body, by invigorating pota∣tions, rarely, if ever, pay any regard to their <HI>external</HI> surface;—an object of equal impor∣tance, and perhaps standing in much greater need of corroborants than the former. Hence it happens, that the skin of convales∣cents is observed to be particularly relaxed and obstructed; that they are liable to con∣tinual colds, upon the least change of temper∣ature; and that every day of their recovery renders them more subject to relapses.</P>
<P>In this country, the children of people in the middling and lower ranks are perhaps bet∣ter managed, than in most of the countries upon the Continent; because frequent and daily bathing is, to my certain knowledge, no where so generally practised as in England.
<PB N="38" REF="039111_0068_10139E8ED22DC348"/>
As soon, however, as children attain a certain age, this practice is again as generally neglect∣ed: after the tenth or twelfth year of age, the surface of the body is very little attended to. Thus a foundation is laid for numberless evils, and particularly for that scorbutic taint in the human system, which now almost uni∣versally prevails, and which is more or less connected with other and more fashionable complaints.—As we advance further in years, this disposition of the skin increases still more, particularly from the mode of life pursued in the higher ranks. We then begin to accus∣tom ourselves to sedentary habits, to think, and to partake of the pleasures of life. The lady, the man of fortune, and the ill-fated man of letters, all of them require <HI>more active</HI> exercise, than they actually take, which alone can promote a free perspiration, and enliven the surface of the body; but, by their indo∣lent habits, the whole machine stagnates, and the skin becomes contracted and debilitated.</P>
<P>The husbandman, indeed, labours diligent∣ly; and though, by the sweat of his brow, his skin preserves more life and activity, it is neither kept sufficiently clean, nor prevented from being obstructed by perspirable matter. The artist and manufacturer carry on their pursuits in a sedentary manner, and in a con∣fined, impure air; the latter, in the duties of his occupation, generally employs unwhole∣some articles, so that at length he loses the use of this organ entirely, in some parts of the body. The voluptuary and the glutton do not suffer less than the former, as they impair the

energy of the skin by excesses of every kind, and take no precautions to preserve its elastic texture.—Our usual articles of dress, flannel excepted, are not calculated to promote a free perspiration;—our coal-fires, and still more the large potations of <HI>warm</HI> liquors, contri∣bute greatly to relax the skin. If we add to this list of predisposing causes, our inconstant climate, which at one hour of the day braces, and at another relaxes the surface of the body, which alternately heats and cools it, and con∣sequently disturbs its uniform action; it will be easily understood, that the skin must for these reasons be almost generally vitiated, and that it really is a leading source of many of our fashionable indispositions.</P>
<P>When the sensation of the surface is im∣paired; when the myriads of orifices, that are designed for the continual purification and renovation of our fluids, are obstructed, if not closed; when the subtle nervous texture is nearly deprived of its energy, so that it be∣comes an <HI>impenetrable coat of mail,</HI> is there any reason to wonder, that we are so often harass∣ed by a sense of constraint and anxiety, and that this uneasiness, in many cases, terminates in a desponding gloom, and at length in complete melancholy?—Ask the hypochon∣driac, whether a certain degree of cold, pale∣ness, and a spasmodic sensation in the skin, do not always precede his most violent fits of mental debility; and whether his feelings are not most comfortable, when the surface of his body is vigorous, warm, and perspires freely? In short, the degrees of insensible per∣spiration
<PB N="40" REF="039111_0070_10139E90581EDDA0"/>
are to him the safest barometer of his state of mind. If our skin be disorganiz∣ed, the free inlets and outlets of the electric, magnetic, and other matters, which affect us at the change of the weather, are inactive. Thus the origin of extreme sensibility towards the various atmospheric revolutions, is no longer a mystery. For, in a healthy surface of the body, no inconvenience will follow from such changes.—If we further advert to those acrimonious fluids which, in an imper∣fect state of perspiration, are retained in our body, and which settle upon the most sensible nerves and membranes,—we shall better ap∣prehend, how cramps or spasms, the tortur∣ing pains of the Gout and Rheumatism, and the great variety of cutaneous diseases, have of late become so obstinate and general.</P>
<P>The equilibrium of the fluids, and the cir∣culation of the blood, are also determined in no small degree by the skin; so that if these fluids become thick and languid, the whole momentum of the blood is repelled towards the interior parts. Thus a continual plethora, or fulness of the blood, is occasioned; the head and breast are greatly oppressed; and the external parts, especially the lower ex∣tremities, feel chilly and lifeless.</P>
<P>In warm climates, in Italy for instance, the haemorrhoids, a very distressing com∣plaint, are but rarely met with, notwithstand∣ing the luxurious and sensual mode of life of the inhabitants; because perspiration is al∣ways free and unchecked: while among us persons are found, who devote the whole of
<PB N="41" REF="039111_0071_10139ED19D3AAE68"/>
their attention to the cure of that troublesome disorder.</P>
<P>May we not infer, from what I have thus advanced, that the use of baths is too much neglected, and ought to be universally intro∣duced? It is not sufficient, for the great pur∣poses here alluded to, that a few of the more wealthy families repair every season to wa∣tering-places, or that they even make use of other modes of bathing, either for their health or amusement. A very different method must be pursued, if we seriously wish to re∣store the vigour of a degenerated race. I mean here to inculcate the indispensable ne∣cessity for <HI>domestic baths,</HI> so well known among the ancients, and so universally established all over Europe, a few centuries ago, and which were eminently calculated to check the fur∣ther progress of the leprosy;—a disease which, though flower in its effects, is not less distress∣ing than the plague itself.</P>
<P>Much has been said and written upon the various methods, and the universal medicines, proposed in different ages, by different ad∣venturers, professedly to diminish the inhe∣rent disposition to disease, and to give a new and renovating principle to the human frame. At one time they expected to find it in the philosophic and <HI>astralian salis,</HI> at another in Magnetism and Electricity;—some fanatics pretended to have discovered it in the light of the moon, others in celestial beds;—but, if I may venture to deliver my opinion, we may search for it most safely and conveniently
<PB N="42" REF="039111_0072_10139E92E84D3AF0"/>
in every clear fountain—in the bosom of ever young, ever animating nature.</P>
<P><HI>Bathing</HI> may be also considered as an excel∣lent specific for alleviating both mental and bodily sufferings. It is not merely a cleanser of the skin, enlivening and rendering it more fit for performing its offices; but it also re∣freshes the mind, and spreads over the whole system a sensation of ease, activity, and pleas∣antness. It further removes stagnation in the larger as well as in the capillary vessels; it gives an uniform free circulation to the blood, and preserves that wonderful harmony in our interior organs, on the disposition of which our health and comfort so much depend. A person fatigued, or distressed in body and mind, will derive more refreshment from the luxury of a lukewarm bath, and may drown his dis∣quietude in it more effectually, than by in∣dulging in copious libations to Bacchus. The bath may be equally recommended as an ad∣mirable retiring place, to evade, for a time, the influence of the atmosphere; and persons that have the misfortune to be too susceptible of external impressions, would find no small benefit, were they to repair in thick and sul∣try weather to the bath, where they breathe in an element less loaded with noxious parti∣cles.</P>
<P>The wish to enjoy perpetual youth, is one of the most predominant and pardonable. Though it cannot be rationally asserted, that bathing will confer continual youth, yet I will hazard an opinion, that it has a very un∣common and superior tendency to prolong
<PB N="43" REF="039111_0073_10139ED426119EE8"/>
that happy state; it preserves all the solid parts soft and pliable, and renders the joints of the body flexible. Hence it powerfully counteracts, what I presume to call an insidi∣ous disease, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>age,</HI> which operates by grad∣ually exhausting the humours, and depriving the constituent parts of the human frame of their elasticity. It is no less certain, that bath∣ing is one of the most efficacious means of preserving beauty; and that those nations, among which bathing is a prevailing practice, are usually the most distinguished for elegance of form and beauty of complexion.</P>
<P>A moderate desire to improve and beautify the surface of the body, is far from being a frivolous pursuit. It excites as much interest, and is productive of as beneficial consequences, as the exertions of many a pseudo-philos∣opher, who devotes the toil of years, to ar∣range his notions in a certain systematic form, and who yet is not fortunate enough to at∣tain the great object of his wish. I have had frequent opportunities to observe, that the desire of beauty, when not inordinate, may prove the source of many virtuous and laud∣able pursuits, and that it may be greatly in∣strumental to the preservation of health. I am also persuaded, that this desire is often pursued by methods not the most proper, and that from not having a just knowledge of beauty, we make many valuable sacrifices, not only of things relating to health, but sometimes of life itself. Instances are not un∣common, of young persons attempting to bleach their skins, and beautify their persons,
<PB N="44" REF="039111_0074_10139E96C01F6710"/>
by avoiding a free air, using a mild and weak∣ening diet, long fasting, long sleeping, warm∣ing their beds, &amp;c. &amp;c.; but, alas! the event does not answer their expectation,—they lose both health and bloom!—Eating chalk, drink∣ing vinegar, wearing camphorated charms, and similar destructive means have been re∣sorted to, by other more daring adventurers, but with no better success. Those I have last enumerated, may be called the <HI>minor cosmetics:</HI> others of a more formidable nature, I almost hesitate to mention, as they are unquestiona∣bly the most deleterious substances we are ac∣quainted with. <HI>Mercury</HI> and <HI>lead,</HI> manufac∣tured in various forms, are unhappily too common ingredients in many of our <HI>modern</HI> cosmetics, whether they consist of lotions, creams, powders, paints or ointments. That these substances can be communicated to the circulating fluids, through the skin as well as by the stomach, requires, I should suppose, no further proof, after the doctrines already advanced on this subject. <HI>Lead,</HI> in particular, if once introduced into the system, though in the smallest proportions, cannot be removed by art, and never fails to produce the most deplorable effects; such as palsy, contraction and convulsion of the limbs, total lameness, weakness, and the most excruciating colic pains. Besides these more obvious effects, the frequent external use of lead and mercu∣ry, as cosmetics, occasions cramps in every part of the body, faintings, nervous weakness, catarrhs, tubercles in the lungs and intestines, which occur together or separately, according
<PB N="45" REF="039111_0075_10139ED7C92EAD70"/>
to the different circumstances, till at length a consumption, either pulmonary or hectic, closes the dreadful scene.</P>
<P>Beauty of the skin, the subject under con∣sideration at present, is but another term for a found and healthy skin;—a pure mirror of the harmony of the internal parts with their surface, or, if I may be allowed the expression, "<HI>it is visible health.</HI>"</P>
<P>There subsists so intimate a relation between our interior and exterior vessels, that almost every error or irregularity in the organs within, shows itself first of all on the surface without, and particularly on the face.—How often are we struck at the countenance of a person, who thinks himself in perfect health, but whose illness, the result of some morbid cause concealed in the body, justifies in a few days the serious apprehensions we entertained at our last interview. Nature has wisely or∣dained, that the first appearance of internal irregularities is indicated by the countenance; but to what use do we generally apply this index?—We refuse to avail ourselves of her beneficent intimation; and the continued use of pernicious substances, instead of promoting the object we have in view, ultimately tar∣nishes and impairs that beauty, which we meant to adorn and preserve. We imagine it in our power to improve the skin, without attending to the purity of the fluids, although it is indebted to them for its very existence; and yet should smile at a person, who attempt∣ed to cleanse an impure tongue, by constantly scraping it, when a disordered stomach was the real cause of that impurity.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="039111_0076_10139E9843F605D8"/>
From the tenor of the preceding positions, I hope for indulgence, when I venture to pro∣nounce every cosmetic, whose composition is kept a secret from the public, false and fraud∣ulent ware. The three great and really effec∣tual SUBSTITUTES FOR COSMETICS,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To such readers, whether male or female, as are <HI>determined</HI> to make use of <HI>cosmetics,</HI> instead of attending to the more effectual means to preserve the bloom of the skin, it may be of service to point out one or two <HI>external applications,</HI> in order to prevent them from resort∣ing to the dangerous and destructive contrivances of Quacks.—Ac∣cording to Dr. WITHERING, a physician of great eminence at Bir∣mingham, an infusion of horse-radish in milk makes one of the safest and best cosmetics. Another preparation for clearing the skin of pimples and <HI>recent eruptions,</HI> if assisted by gentle aperient medicines, is the fresh expressed juice of house-leek, mixed with an equal quan∣tity of sweet milk or cream.—Yet all contrivances whatever, to an∣swer this purpose, are absurd and nugatory, if the <HI>inward</HI> state of the body be neglected, or if they be looked upon as <HI>specifics of themselves.</HI> Such things do <HI>not</HI> exist in nature; and we might as well try to bleach the face of a Negro, as to remove any scorbutic or other erup∣tions from the face, without bestowing proper attention on the whole state of the body, and particularly the fluids, from which these irreg∣ularities derive their origin.</NOTE> which I would recommend, are the following: <HI>First;</HI> due attention to <HI>insensible perspiration;</HI>—an important process, by which nature, if duly assisted, will not fail to expel all acrimonious or useless particles. By this, too, the surface of the body will be kept in a constant atmos∣phere of softening exhalations,—a species of volatile vapor-bath, and the most efficacious means of preserving it soft and plaint, and of animating it with the colour of life. The next circumstance to be attended to, is the <HI>purity of the fluids;</HI> this depends equally on a free <HI>perspiration,</HI> and on a vigorous state of <HI>digestion.</HI> The third requisite to a fair, health∣ful complexion, is an <HI>uniform</HI> distribution of the fluids; or in other words, <HI>a free and un∣restrained
<PB N="47" REF="039111_0077_10139ED94E22C640"/>
circulation of the blood;</HI> as the very purest fluids, when profusely propelled to the face, are productive of disagreeable consequen∣ces, such as unnatural redness, flushings, tu∣mid appearances, &amp;c. of which ladies of a sed∣entary life are so apt to complain.</P>
<P>To these three general observations, I think, it may be necessary to subjoin a few particular injunctions, relative to the improvement of the skin, as connected with a state of good health.—Carefully avoid all <HI>immoderate</HI> and <HI>vi∣olent dancing,</HI> as the sudden alternations of heat and cold, not only impair the general state of the skin, but are likewise of the greatest detri∣ment to beauty.—Abstain from the too fre∣quent and too copious use of heating liquors of every kind, particularly punch and strong wines. There is scarcely any thing which is, in my opinion, more destructive of the bloom of youth and manhood, than this <HI>liquid fire,</HI> which fills the blood with inflammable particles, pro∣pels them towards the face, parches the skin, renders it spotted, and lays the foundation of that incurable disease, which is sometimes fig∣uratively called <HI>copper in the face.</HI> Neither su∣gar, nor any additional ingredient to gratify the palate, can deprive these liquors of their noxious qualities, so that even the most agree∣able of these seductive potions is attended with considerable danger.</P>
<P>Avoid, likewise, every excess in <HI>hot</HI> drinks, as coffee, chocolate, and tea, particularly the last, in which the people of this country are given to indulge, more than in any other beverage. I scarcely dare venture to impeach
<PB N="48" REF="039111_0078_10139E9AD0549E48"/>
this favourite <HI>solace</HI> of our morning and even∣ing hours; but with all due deference to the comforts of the domestic circle, I consider it as my duty to denounce the too liberal use of this liquor, as not a little prejudicial to the fairness and purity of the skin. Tea taken hot, and in immoderate quantities, not only has a tendency to weaken the organs of diges∣tion, but causes fluctuations and congestions in the humours of the face, and frequently brings on a degree of debilitating perspiration. Let us conceive the stomach inundated with a portion of warm water, just at the time of digestion; its concoctive powers are literally drowned, at the very instant when their assist∣ance is most required; and, instead of a pure balsamic <HI>chyle,</HI> or alimentary fluid, it prepares crude, and acrimonious humours, which can only generate an unhealthy mass of blood. Here, I cannot impress upon the attentive read∣er, in terms sufficiently strong, the following truth: <HI>that a healthy stomach only can produce healthy and uncontaminated fluids;</HI> and that two thirds of what we call acrimony, or sharpness of humours in the system, proceed from a languid stomach, and irregular digestion.—If therefore the tea be made too weak, it will operate merely as warm water, and like it will greatly relax the coat and membranes of the stomach;—if made too strong, it will give an unnatural heat to the body, prove a dan∣gerous stimulus to the nerves, occasion palpi∣tations of the heart, universal trembling, cramps, and a number of other complaints, which it is needless to enumerate. That these
<PB N="49" REF="039111_0079_10139EDBE142EC50"/>
effects do not take place, during the first months or years of indulging ourselves in the intemperate use of hot and strong tea, is no argument to controvert this position; they will, either sooner or later, unavoidably fol∣low.</P>
<P>I shall but slightly touch here, on another subject, scarcely of less importance than the former; namely, the various articles prepared by the pastry-cook and confectioner. These dainties would be less objectionable, if any method could be devised of baking them without the pernicious ingredients of yeast and fat, substances which load the stomach with a glutinous slime and rancid matter, which obstruct the glands of the abdomen, particularly those of the mesentery, and which have a strong tendency to produce the cuta∣neous diseases before mentioned.</P>

<HEAD>On the Physical Education of Children.</HEAD>
<P>THE physical education<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To some readers it may be necessary to explain, that by <HI>physical education</HI> is meant the bodily treatment of children: the term <HI>physical</HI> being applied in opposition to <HI>moral.</HI></NOTE> of infants unques∣tionably forms an object of the first impor∣tance. The great disproportion subsisting be∣tween healthy and diseased children, together with the deplorable mortality which occurs among the latter, too plainly evince, that their <HI>bodily</HI> welfare is not sufficiently attend∣ed to.</P>
<P>There is little room to doubt, that by a more rational mode of nurture, during the
<PB N="50" REF="039111_0080_10139E9C55C8EB68"/>
first years of infancy, many subsequent diseases might either be wholly prevented, or at least greatly mitigated. Nothing perhaps would contribute more to meliorate education in general, than, what has been long and much wanted, a serious and minute attention of the Faculty to this particular branch of medical study: which at present, I am concerned to say, is almost totally neglected.</P>
<P>The few books extant on this subject are neither written on scientific principles, nor calculated, by their manner and style, to af∣ford plain and popular instruction. It is not enough for professional men to plan systems of education in their study-rooms;—let them also demonstrate in practice, that they are familiarly acquainted with the <HI>true</HI> method of educating children;—a method which; in my opinion, implies somewhat more than merely prescribing and administering medi∣cines.</P>
<P>So long as the nursing of children remains exclusively in the hands of common midwives and nurses, it is rather a matter of surprise, that so many infants should survive the age of childhood.—We ought therefore, above all things, to inquire into the monstrous preju∣dices prevailing in this essential part of domes∣tic management, as the first step towards their extirpation.</P>
<P>How great would be my satisfaction, if, by the following strictures, I should be able to prevail upon some intelligent mothers, who possess sufficient fortitude, to throw off the bondage of old customs, or modern fashions,
<PB N="51" REF="039111_0081_10139EDFB2E65988"/>
and to return to the path of simple nature!—In a system of practical education, it is a judi∣cious precept, which cannot be too much in∣culcated, <HI>to omit rather than to undertake, or be too officious, in the physical treatment of infants.</HI></P>
<P>From the difficulty of discovering the true cause and seat of the complaints of children, especially if accompanied with any particular symptoms in the excretory vessels, it is very usual to administer a <HI>gentle laxative</HI> or <HI>emetic,</HI> upon the slightest occasion.—It would lead me too far to examine, in detail, the many bad consequences resulting from so absurd and detrimental a practice. I cannot, however, forbear from remarking, that by dealing con∣stantly in aperient medicines (a strange infatu∣ation among the vulgar!) the future diseases of the child assume a particular character of the <HI>gastric</HI> kind—the juice of the stomach, which serves to concoct our food, being vitiated. As the operation of the laxatives is in a manner mechanical, by impelling the fluids, and partic∣ularly those of the mucous kind, towards the stomach and bowels, and causing them to ac∣cumulate in a greater degree than usual, it will be easily understood, that by the frequent repetition of this stimulus, the gastric juice will be rendered unfit to effect the proper so∣lution of food in the stomach. For the same reason, persons subject to frequent costiveness soon begin to complain of indigestion, when they once habituate themselves to take AN∣DERSON'S or any other aperient pills: for by them the stomach is converted, as it were, into a field of battle, where all the ir∣regularities,
<PB N="52" REF="039111_0082_10139E9EF21C3388"/>
that take place in the system, are left to fight their way; where the limits of disease and health, nay the alternative of life and death, are to be finally determined. That this however is not the most proper place for such a contest, requires no demonstration. The stomach is appointed by nature for very different purposes; it is the only organ of nourishment and digestion; the source of res∣toration and health. But how can it effec∣tually answer this end, if it serves, at the same time, as the constant laboratory of diseases? As it is always in a state of impurity, it can∣not act with uniform energy and a sufficient degree of elasticity, to prevent frequent irreg∣ularities in digestion;—hence arise bad hu∣mours, hypochondriac affections, and nervous debility; all of which, I have reason to fear, are, more or less, consequences of tampering with medicines, especially in the period of childhood. I am further induced to think, though it may to some appear rather a bold idea, that more children are destroyed by the absurd practice of loading their tender stom∣achs with every sort of trash, and afterwards relieving them by repeated doses of physic, than by any <HI>natural</HI> process. This likewise accounts for the great number of children who die <HI>in towns,</HI> at an early age, before they become inured to such severe attacks made on their digestive organs.</P>
<P>In order to check, and, if possible, to pre∣vent, this general tendency to diseases; to meliorate the constitution of children, by producing a regular circulation of the fluids;
<PB N="53" REF="039111_0083_10139EE137A46668"/>
and to direct the exuding morbid matter more universally and uniformly through the pores of the skin, a more effectual remedy cannot be suggested, than that of <HI>frequent bath∣ing,</HI> and a very limited use of aperient medi∣cines.</P>
<P>These observations are not conjectural, but founded on experience, and it gives me pleas∣ure to add, that they are confirmed by many physicians of eminent abilities, and extensive practice.</P>
<P>Frequent bathing in infancy is a powerful mean of counteracting and suppressing the disposition to stomachic and bilious com∣plaints, which, in our days, are uncommonly prevalent among children and adults, and which are frequently accompanied with diver∣sified nervous symptoms. By the efforts of nature, to throw off malignant humours by the surface of the body, in consequence of a proper use of the bath, many infantile diseases may be safely prevented, catarrhs suppressed, or greatly mitigated, teething rendered easy, and the whole physical condition of the child considerably improved.</P>
<P>It becomes here a question, which is the most proper degree of heat in using the bath for children.—I shall venture to pronounce, upon the authority of the best modern authors, confirmed by my own experience and obser∣vation, that the <HI>lukewarm bath,</HI> between 84 and 96° of Fahrenheit's thermometer, rather more than new-milk warm, is, upon an aver∣age, the most suitable temperature. An er∣roneous notion too much prevails, that the
<PB N="54" REF="039111_0084_10139EA38AB2A9A8"/>
good effects of bathing are principally to be ascribed to the <HI>cold bath.</HI> The use of any bath, indeed, whether cold or warm, that is, the stimulating impression excited by the water, is, of itself, an excellent tonic, serving to brace and invigorate the whole system. Not to mention the comfortable sensations, that must necessarily attend the cleansing and opening so many millions of pores, with which the skin is provided, it is farther re∣markable, that water, formerly considered as a <HI>simple</HI> element, is now pretty generally un∣derstood to be a <HI>compound</HI> body, consisting of <HI>oxygen</HI> and <HI>hydrogen,</HI> or vital and inflammable air, the former of which, it is well known, promotes the process of <HI>respiration,</HI> and lite∣rally feeds the vital principle in the human body. Although this assertion rests chiefly on an hypothetical foundation, so much is certain, that a lukewarm bath, used for the legs alone, is found by experience to commu∣nicate new spirits to the weary traveller, al∣most instantly to remove the sense of languor, and to re-animate all his faculties. <HI>Bruce,</HI> the Abyssinian traveller, remarks, that in the intense heat of that country, a lukewarm bath afforded him more refreshment and vig∣our, than a cold one. We ought farther to consider, that infants are accustomed scarcely to any other than a <HI>warm</HI> temperature. The cold bath belongs to the class of <HI>heroic reme∣dies,</HI> and in its sudden and vehement effects nearly resembles electricity. It is moreover an axiom in medicine, that the means of stimulating and corroborating the system,
<PB N="55" REF="039111_0085_10139EE3CED76488"/>
should be in proportion to the degree of vital power in the individual; that a faint spark may be extinguished rather than kindled by too violent a concussion of air; and that a degree of stimulus and invigoration, which agrees with a firm and robust body, may prove destructive to one that is weak and ten∣der. It might therefore be extremely haz∣ardous to employ a remedy, in the delicate frame of infants, which even adults should not resort to without the greatest precaution. I presume to go a step farther, and do not hes∣itate to say, that the use of the cold bath, as far as relates to the treatment of children, is even DANGEROUS. Its principal mode of op∣eration is by contracting the whole surface of the body, and by causing a general repul∣sion of the fluids towards the internal parts. Hence in a young and infirm body, which has very little internal <HI>reaction,</HI> the necessary con∣sequence of cold bathing will be an unequal distribution of the fluids, a partial or local stagnation of them; and, what is worst of all, an accumulation of humours in the head, by which infants are frequently injured, before it is in their power to complain.—The lukewarm bath, on the contrary, produces an uniform revolution and salutary purification of all the fluids. For these reasons, I consider the tepid bath as in every respect preferable, since it may be used somewhat cooler for strong chil∣dren, or warmer for those of a weakly consti∣tution, and the requisite degrees of heat be regulated according to the increasing age and strength of the child. In summer, the water
<PB N="56" REF="039111_0086_10139EA6239008D0"/>
intended for bathing ought to be exposed the whole day to the rays of the sun, which will impart to it an agreeable and congenial warmth. Rain, or river-water, is the most proper for this purpose; but if there be a ne∣cessity for using spring or well-water, it should be previously softened with a small quantity of boiled water, in which a quarter of an ounce of soap has been dissolved, with the ad∣dition of a little bran or oatmeal; or if milk can be had, it will be found a still more use∣ful ingredient. Here I would particularly rec∣ommend not to boil the <HI>whole</HI> quantity of the water to be used for bathing; as it would in that case be deprived of its aërial constituents, which are not without their importance in the bath.—During the first weeks and months, the child should not be suffered to remain in the bath longer than five minutes, which time may be gradually increased to a quarter of an hour. During the whole process of bathing, the body should not remain inactive, but be gently rubbed with the hand, and af∣terwards cleaned with a soft spunge. It is of consequence to attend to the point of time, when the child is taken out of the bath; for in almost every instance where warm bathing disagrees with the child, it will be found ow∣ing to neglect in not wiping and drying the body with sufficient expedition at this partic∣ular period. Hence it is highly necessary to keep warm cloaths in readiness, in which the child should be wrapped up, and dried, the very moment it is taken out of the bath. Every one in the habit of bathing must have
<PB N="57" REF="039111_0087_10139EE559709E78"/>
observed, that the evaporation of water on the skin excites penetrating and uncomfortable sensations of cold; and there is an astonish∣ing difference of temperature between actu∣ally being in the water, and having water on the skin after quitting the bath. If, there∣fore, a child, from want of due precaution, be kept for several minutes with a naked, wet body, it will be liable to contract a cold, the more dangerous in its consequences, as it immediately succeeds a state, in which the body is warm and the skin open.</P>
<P>It should be further observed, that bathing, immediately after a meal, or with a full stom∣ach, is highly improper, if not dangerous, both in children and adults; nor is it advis∣able, in rough weather, to carry a child into the open air too soon after bathing. The most proper time for using the bath is the evening, when the child can be removed to bed, as soon as it is completely dried.</P>
<P>There is another species of bath, equally indispensable, which I will call the <HI>Air-bath;</HI> or the daily enjoyment of fresh air. This is usually considered as a promenade, or walk of pleasure; and as children cannot judge of its great utility, and the weather is not always favourable for excursions, parents are sometimes guilty of unpardonable neglect, in confining infants for whole days and weeks together within their rooms. But if air be essentially requisite to animate the most subtle powers of man, it follows, that it is as neces∣sary to the organs of life as food and drink; and that its salutary influence on the consti∣tution
<PB N="58" REF="039111_0088_10139EA7E6CE7E78"/>
does not so much depend on the state of it with respect to pleasantness and serenity, as on its freshness and constant renewal. Hence I would impress it on the reader, as a rule not to be departed from, <HI>to let no day elapse, without affording the child an opportunity of imbibing the salubrious qualities of fresh air.</HI> In the first months great precaution is neces∣sary, and children born in spring or summer have in this respect no small advantages, as there is less danger in exposing them to the open air during the warm months, than there is in autumn and winter. In the milder sea∣sons, too, violent winds, and moist weather, cannot be too carefully avoided. After the two first months of its existence, if the child has been duly habituated to fresh air, it may be safely carried out in <HI>any</HI> state of the weath∣er: this ought to be regularly done every day, if it be only for half an hour, as it is one of the most nourishing cordials that can be given. I shall just notice here, in a cursory way, the great benefit which the eyes of chil∣dren derive from this practice, and which, particularly at a time when complaints of weak and sore eyes are heard in almost every family, is of the utmost importance. It is an unquestionable fact, that the shortness of sight, and weakness of the eyes, so prevalent among the inhabitants of towns, is chiefly owing to the injudicious custom of confining children, during the first years of their lives, almost constantly within four walls; so that the eye, being accustomed to <HI>near</HI> objects only, becomes organized for a narrow view, and at length

is rendered incapable of forming the focus properly for <HI>distant</HI> objects. On the other hand, it is equally certain, that by an early and daily exertion of the organs of sight, in be∣holding remote objects, in the open air, the circle of vision is enlarged, the power of sight increased, and a solid foundation laid for ac∣quiring a clear and comprehensive discern∣ment of objects.</P>
<P>From the preceding observations, it will be readily admitted, that the proper and daily airing of the nursery, <HI>in winter as well as in summer,</HI> is of no small importance to the well∣being of children. It has been proved by many fatal instances, that a confined and im∣pure air is of itself capable of exciting the most violent convulsive symptoms, and consequent∣ly is one of the principal causes, that so many infants die of convulsions, during the first months of their lives. Would it not be more eligible, to select the most airy apartment in the house for a nursery, than low and con∣fined garrets, as is too frequently the case in large families? The room, in which children breathe, should at least be capacious and lof∣ty, and exposed to the cheering rays of the sun, which not only influence the temper and spirits of children, but serve to purify the corrupted air in their apartments.</P>
<P>Persons unaccustomed to reflect on this sub∣ject, can scarcely conceive, what salutary ef∣fects the simple means here recommended, namely, the early habit of washing, bathing, and daily airing, produce on the constitution, and physical formation of the child. The
<PB N="60" REF="039111_0090_10139EAAA7829408"/>
habit of body, growth, and appearance of children, properly educated in this respect, will be totally different from those, who are reared like foreign plants in a ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-house. To point out still more forcibly the peculiar ad∣vantages attending the regimen here recom∣mended, I shall exhibit a picture of such chil∣dren, not taken from fancy, but authorized by facts, and according with the experience of many modern observers, as well as my own, and that of a respectable physician in Germany, Professor Hufeland of Jena, to whom I am greatly indebted for the following observations:</P>
<P N="1">1. A child thus treated is more hardy and less affected by the vicissitudes of climate and weather.</P>
<P N="2">2. Its body is straight and robust; its limbs are uniformly muscular, and well propor∣tioned.</P>
<P N="3">3. The stages of evolution, in its different organs, take place in regular succession;—no power, no capacity, outstrips another; its teeth do not appear too soon, nor at irregular periods; the child does not begin to walk too early nor too late; and the same order is observable with regard to its speaking. Even the mental faculties expand themselves more regularly, that is, not too rapidly, but after the most important bodily changes have been effected. Every period of its progress to ma∣turity comes on in a natural and gradual manner, so that the child, in a physical sense, longer remains a child;—he does not shoot up into manhood, before he has completed
<PB N="61" REF="039111_0091_10139EECA49474C8"/>
the proper term of youth; and thus every stage, as well as the whole career of his ex∣istence, is considerably prolonged.</P>
<P N="4">4. By this treatment the circulation of the fluids, and all internal motions, particularly of the lungs and intestines, together with the usual evacuations, are beneficially promoted. Of no less advantage is the bath to those chil∣dren, that are subject to habitual costiveness; a distemperature which cannot be too much guarded against, not only during the age of childhood, but also through the whole life. Infants accustomed to the bath, and fresh air, are scarcely ever known to suffer from this complaint.</P>
<P N="5">5. The texture of their muscular flesh be∣comes solid, the colour blooming, and the body neither appears tumid and spungy, nor parched and meagre. The complexion is lively and fresh;—the head and lower belly are in just proportion to the rest of the body, and the disposition to rickets, so common in children, is not perceived in them.</P>
<P N="6">6. Neither are such children as enjoy the benefit of the bath affected by that excessive sensibility and diseased irritability of the nerv∣ous system, which in many instances so fatal∣ly degenerates into spasms, fits, and convul∣sions. These irregularities, in early life, are chiefly instrumental in bringing on that piti∣able state, in which some unhappy persons, through the whole of their lives, are little better than <HI>loco-motive nervous machines</HI>—organ∣ized beings, that exist apparently for the sake of <HI>feeling only, not for acting.</HI></P>
<P N="7"><PB N="62" REF="039111_0092_10139EAE4272C138"/>
7. Diseases of the skin, eruptions, catarrhs, coughs, obstructions of the first passages, &amp;c. are rarely observed to attack a child properly treated; and if they do, their duration will be short, and the <HI>crises</HI> easy and natural.</P>
<P N="8">8. Those diseases in children, which are commonly called dangerous, as the small-pox, measles, scarlet fever, &amp;c. and which are ulti∣mately diseases of the skin, are greatly allevi∣ated in their symptoms, and more easily over∣come, when the skin is in full health and vig∣our;—but as the usual management of chil∣dren deprives the skin of those properties, we need not be at all surprised at the danger and subsequent mortality of children, in the above∣mentioned diseases.</P>
<P N="9">9. The early practice of washing and bath∣ing may be also recommended, as tending to strengthen that sense of cleanliness, which is so praiseworthy and useful in itself; and which is not sufficiently cultivated among those nations, where the bath is in disuse.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Russians, notwithstanding their ignorance, and rusticity of manners, take the lead of the more relined French and Germans, both in a delicate sensibility of cleanliness, and in the practical use of the bath. I lately read of a foreign gentleman, travelling in Russia, who had hired one of the natives as his groom or postillion. After hav∣ing travelled several days together in very sultry weather, the semi∣barbarian upon his knees requested his employer to grant him leave of absence for two or three hours, to refresh himself with the luxury of a bath, which to him was indispensable, and the want of which he had long felt. The <HI>peasants</HI> in that country possess a refinement of sense, with respect to the surface of the body, with which the most elegant <HI>ladies</HI> in other countries seem totally unacquainted.</NOTE></P>
<P>If the means above stated are expected to produce their full effect, it should not be for∣gotten, that the <HI>whole</HI> management of the child ought to correspond and keep pace with
<PB N="63" REF="039111_0093_10139EEE2B3F3678"/>
the preceding practice. Without attending to this condition, constant washing and bath∣ing may not only prove of little service, but may in some instances be productive of mis∣chief. Hence it is absolutely necessary to pro∣hibit the use of feather-beds, cumbersome dresses, &amp;c. and to avoid all suffocating rooms, whether occasioned by too great heat, or an offensive corrupted atmosphere.</P>
<P>There is no practice more detrimental to the powers and energy of man, in the first period of his evolution, than that of immedi∣ately sinking the tender infant in a soft feath∣er-bed. In this situation, all the organs be∣come extremely relaxed, and we lay the foun∣dation of a very serious malady, a <HI>sweating-skin;</HI> the source of constant colds, tooth-achs, head-achs, catarrhs, and innumerable other complaints.</P>
<P>For these and similar reasons, I would ad∣vise parents to lay their children, from the very hour of their birth, on soft and cooling mattresses, under thin blanket covers, or cot∣ton quilts, which do not incommode the body, lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the hands and arms at liberty, and are not liable to excite too great a degree of heat. In the intense cold of winter, an additional blanket may be used, which, how∣ever, should be removed when the weather turns milder, and the child grows stronger. But the greatest mischief arises from bolsters or pillows filled with feathers; which must, after a certain time, produce uncleanliness and a disagreeable smell. Such a pillow is calcu∣lated to collect and retain mephitic vapours;
<PB N="64" REF="039111_0094_10139EAFC7BC4538"/>
and for this obvious reason it cannot but be unsafe to sleep for a whole twelvemonth wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> one's head reposed on such a mass of acrid ex∣halations. This inconvenience may be easily avoided, by furnishing children with cushions filled with horse-hair, or with the softest bran, previously well beaten; the best for this pur∣pose is the bran of oats. The great advan∣tage of these pillows is, that they admit mois∣ture to pass through them, consequently they will always remain dry; and may from time to time be renewed, while they preserve a moderate and regular degree of warmth.</P>
<P><HI>Cleanliness,</HI> in domestic life, is one of the cardinal virtues, and an essential requisite to the proper physical education of children. Indeed, I cannot help remarking, that this is perhaps the <HI>only</HI> province of parental care, in which we <HI>never</HI> can do <HI>too much.</HI> For this end, we ought not to neglect the article of linen, as the frequent change of it is of more consequence than many parents are aware of. A child is much more liable to perspire than an adult; the natural effect of which is, that its linen is more readily soiled and rendered unfit for wearing. I would therefore advise all parents, who can afford it, to give their children clean, dry linen <HI>every day.</HI> An un∣doubted proof of the utility of this practice is, that instances have occurred of children being cured of the rickets, when, from the first appearance of that complaint, they have been daily furnished with clean linen, well dried, and occasionally smoked with juniper∣berries, frankincense, or other perfuming sub∣stances,
<PB N="65" REF="039111_0095_10139EF0B3D73D80"/>
in order to expel the moisture, which is absorbed by linen. But if a clean change cannot be conveniently had every day, the night-shirt as well as that of the day, ought to be regularly dried, and perfumed if neces∣sary.</P>
<P>Lastly, let the dress of children be light; the head and breast during the first months may be covered, though very slightly; but as soon as the hair is sufficiently strong to af∣ford protection, there is scarcely any necessity for hats or caps, unless in rainy or cold sea∣sons. The breast and neck too acquire more firmness, and are rendered hardier, by keep∣ing them uncovered; as our frequent colds and sore throats chiefly originate from the absurd habit of wearing bosom-friends and stiffened cravats.</P>
<P>I shall conclude these observations with an historical account from HERODOTUS, which clearly illustrates the advantage attending the cool regiment of the head. This judicious and learned writer informs us, that after the battle fought between the <HI>Persians,</HI> under CAMBYSES, and the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> the slain of both nations were separated: and upon ex∣amining the heads of the Persians, their skulls were found to be so thin and tender, that a small stone would immediately perforate them: while on the other hand, the heads of the Egyptians were so firm, that they could scarcely be fractured by the largest stones. The cause of this remarkable difference Hero∣dotus ascribes to a custom the Egyptians had of shaving their heads from the earliest infan∣cy,
<PB N="66" REF="039111_0096_10139EB14D7A8BD8"/>
and going uncovered in all states of the weather; whereas the Persians always kept their heads warm, by wearing heavy turbans.</P>
<P>I sincerely wish, that the rules and obser∣vations, here submitted to the candid reader, were more generally understood and practi∣sed, so far at least as they are found to accord with reason and experience. I am not how∣ever disposed to imagine, that plans of <HI>sudden</HI> improvement are the most likely to succeed; and I am well aware of the difficulties we must expect to encounter, when we attack old and rooted prejudices, with the hope of vanquishing them <HI>all at once.</HI> For though I should be fortunate enough to substitute sounder opinions and better practices, in lieu of those already established, yet, unless the mind be prepared for such changes, by a proper philosophic culture, nothing is more probable, than that a speedy relapse into for∣mer errors will be the necessary consequence. The history of our own time has, in some re∣cent instances, evidently confirmed the truth of this observation. We find even the man∣dates of arbitrary power insufficient to pro∣duce a thorough reform in the manners and customs of a superstitious people. The phi∣lanthropic but weak emperor JOSEPH II. was obliged to yield to the torrent of popular prejudice; and, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n spite of his better reason, frequently to repeal measures dictated by the enlightened genius of philosophy. His obsti∣nate and infatuated subjects were not fully ripe for such salutary innovations. Our age is scarcely docile enough to pursue those im∣provements,
<PB N="67" REF="039111_0097_10139EF46CCE2378"/>
which a rapid and continual pro∣gress in the sciences is daily suggesting. Up∣on this ground alone we can explain the fre∣quent and obvious contrast between the pre∣vailing theories and practices, both in the higher and lower walks of life. A great ma∣jority of the common people, from their ha∣bitual indifference to literature, and their aversion to serious reflection, still manifest their ancient prejudices to every thing which falls under the description of novelty or im∣provement. More than one generation will probably elapse, before even a part of the use∣ful hints can be realized, which lie dispersed in the later writings on subjects of health and domestic economy. Whatever benefits can be attained by popular instruction, both with regard to the treatment of children and adults, must be introduced in a gradual manner. The ancient treatment of children, being con∣secrated by time, must not be rudely and pre∣cipitately rejected; but old customs may be changed by prudent and moderate manage∣ment; and thus we may proceed from one step to another, in extending the boundaries of truth and reason. A gradual transition from a faulty to a better state of things, is commonly the most permanent. Let us com∣bat, at first, the most dangerous notions and prejudices: the conquest over a <HI>single</HI> preju∣dice, if it be completely extirpated, is a tri∣umph of no little moment; inasmuch as it will shake the foundation of many others, more or less connected with it.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="039111_0098_10139F3802212698"/>
In my earnest endeavours to caution the reader against inveterate prejudices, I do not mean to insinuate, that a perfect and perma∣nent state of health is compatible with the delicate organization and complex functions of the human body: I am well aware, that its most healthy condition closely borders on disease, and that the seeds of distempers are already planted in the very fulness or luxu∣riance of our fluids. Hence no <HI>absolute</HI> per∣fection is to be found among mortals, whether we consider them in a physical or moral state. CICERO illustrates this position, when speak∣ing of man as a moral agent, with equal truth and energy, in the following words: "He is not," says this philosophical orator, "the most virtuous man, who commits <HI>no</HI> faults; but I consider him as the most virtuous, whose conscience reproaches with the <HI>fewest.</HI>"</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>A Practical Inquiry into the means and plans adopted among different nations, with a view to prolong human life.—An historical survey of this interesting subject, in different ages; together with the success which has attended the respec∣tive efforts made by nations and individuals.—A brief statement of the conditions requisite to the attainment of a long and healthy life.—Ob∣servations, rules, and cautions deduced from the experience of ages.—Symptoms of actual dissolu∣tion.—Summary account of a dietetic system; explanation of its design, and the vast diversity of objects comprehended under this popular science.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>AS the enjoyment of 'a sound mind in a sound body' is one of the greatest of terrestrial blessings, it is incumbent on ev∣ery rational inquirer, to devote some portion of his time and industry to the research of such useful and practical objects, as may con∣tribute to improve and insure so desirable a state.</P>
<P>As long as the various functions of the hu∣man body, the voluntary as well as the invol∣untary motions, are performed with ease, and suffer no interruption, we usually pronounce the body to be in a state of health; in the contrary case we call it diseased. I shall ad∣vance a step further, and assert, that when we do not feel ourselves encumbered with the
<PB N="70" REF="039111_0100_10139F39C324E2C8"/>
weight of our own frame, and when we are not disposed to reflect, with uneasiness and so∣licitude, upon its physical condition, then we have a right to consider our health as being in a perfect state.</P>
<P>Although we are liable to suffer from the attacks of disease, in a variety of shapes, yet we have abundant reason to contemplate with satisfaction the chequered condition of human life: for, even in the present imperfect state of things, we find comforts more than suffi∣cient to counterbalance our sorrows. Con∣sidering the innumerable accidents, to which we are daily and hourly exposed, it is a mat∣ter of just surprise, that frail, imbecile man should remain in health during the greater part of his life; and still more so, that, upon an average, the number of healthy individu∣als should be found far to exceed those in a contrary state. If we further advert to the want of thought and circumspection, which marks the conduct of man in general, in the treatment of his body, our astonishment will necessarily increase, that he so often escapes the dangers prepared by his own hands. But pa∣rental Nature frequently repairs the injury, though we are not conscious of her salutary efforts. She powerfully co-operates, when art is called in aid, to restore that harmony and order in the system, which had been im∣prudently or inadvertently disturbed. To her healing powers we are principally indebt∣ed, if the sufferings resulting from ignorance or obstinacy are less severe, than the extent of the mischief seemed to portend.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="039111_0101_10139EF88D72EAB8"/>
It cannot be expected, that persons unac∣quainted with the economy of the human frame should be able to discriminate between internal and external causes, and their effects. Where a competent share of this knowledge is wanting, it will be impossible to ascertain, or to counteract, the different causes by which our health is affected; and should a fortunate individual ever fix upon a suitable remedy, he will be indebted to chance alone for the discovery.</P>
<P>This has been the case in all ages, and alas! it is still deplorably the case. Remedies have from time to time been devised, not merely to serve as <HI>Nostrums for all diseases,</HI> but also for the pretended purpose of <HI>prolonging human life.</HI> Those of the latter kind have been ap∣plied with a view to resist or check many op∣erations of nature, which insensibly consume the vital heat, and other powers of life, such as respiration, muscular irritability, &amp;c. Thus, from the implicit credulity of some, and the exuberant imagination of others, observations and experiments, however discordant with sound reason and philosophy, were multiplied, with the avowed design of establishing proofs or refutations of this or that absurd opinion. In this manner have fanaticism and imposture falsified the plainest truths, or forged the most unfounded and ridiculous claims; so that one glaring inconsistency was employed to combat another, and folly succeeded folly, till a fund of materials has been transmitted to posterity, sufficient to form a concise history of this subject.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="039111_0102_10139F3D5CF0E7B0"/>
Men, in all ages, have set a just value on long life; and in proportion to the means of enjoying the same, this value has been felt in a greater or less degree. If the gratification of the sensual appetite formed the principal object of living, the prolongation of it would be, to the epicure, as desirable, as the prospect of a life to be enjoyed beyond the limits of the grave, is to the moralist and the believer.</P>
<P>In the Old Testament, the promise of a long life was held up as one of the most im∣portant sources of consolation: and, conform∣ably to the principles of Christianity, a patient continuance in well-doing, or, in other words, a long life rich in good works, can best insure the hope of a more happy state in a future world. Hence the wish of a speedy termina∣tion of our existence here, is one of those ec∣centricities, into which only persons deprived of reason are liable to be drawn, either from extreme anxiety, or the want of mental forti∣tude. The desire of longevity seems to be inherent in all animal life, and particularly in human nature: it is intimately cherished by us, throughout the whole of our existence, and is frequently supported and strengthened, not only by justifiable means, but also by va∣rious species of collusion.</P>
<P>The possibility of prolonging human life was never doubted by the Orientals, even in the earliest ages. One of the most ancient methods on record, is that of placing the aged and decrepit in the vicinity of an atmosphere, replete with the exhalations of blooming youth. It is not improbable, that a certain
<PB N="73" REF="039111_0103_10139EFB519C1650"/>
custom then prevailing in the East, by alluring the fancy with beautiful images, and by im∣posing upon the understanding through poet∣ical fictions, first induced man to entertain this singular notion. The bloom of a juve∣nile age, and particularly the healthful virgin, was compared, by the Orientals, with roses, lilies, and other elegant flowers; she was in∣troduced in allegorical description, to repre∣sent odoriferous spices, balms, and oils, and was made the subject of pastoral and other poems. How easy, then, the transition from fancy to belief, that the exhalations of vigor∣ous and healthy persons must be highly con∣ducive to the support of exhausted age; that they were capable, like the fragrant balms of the East, of softening the rigidity of the fibres, of exciting the vital spirits, and, in short, of supplying the aged with a fresh stock of health. The history of KING DAVID furnishes us with a striking illustration of this renovat∣ing process.</P>
<P>In the writings of the ancient physicians, we meet with various accounts, from which we learn, that this method has ever been a favourite resource of invalids, worn out with age. Modern physicians also mention the practice, and the celebrated BOERHAAVE in∣forms us, that he advised an old and decrepit burgomaster at Amsterdam to sleep between two young persons; and that his patient, who before was sinking under the weight of infirmities, obviously recovered strength and cheerfulness of mind.</P>
<P>The great age of some schoolmasters has
<PB N="74" REF="039111_0104_10139F3FEE8A1000"/>
likewise been ascribed to the benefit they de∣rive from breathing, almost constantly, among young and healthy children. It has been far∣ther observed, that young persons, if they sleep in company with the aged, become lean and enfeebled.—Upon more accurate inqui∣ries, however, it is pretty evident, that most of the benefits (perhaps all of them) which the aged derive from this expedient, may be placed to the account of the imagination, and its surprising effects on the body. It is this power which, in my opinion, renews the lan∣guishing flame of the aged, and which may preserve them for some time longer in that renovated state, provided it be supported by a proper attention to diet and other circum∣stances.—We frequently see a debilitated and peevish old man assume a complacent smiling aspect, when a sprightly maiden addresses him in the language of courteous pleasantry. The most charming images recur to his stimulated imagination; and the powers of life are, as it were, again roused, and directed to one object. That such means of reanimating old age, may have a favourable effect on health, cannot be disputed.</P>
<P>To imagine, however, that the vigour of health and the bloom of youth can be trans∣fused by insensible perspiration, or exhala∣tion, into the body of the aged, is to labour under a very palpable mistake. I shall prove, in the next Chapter "On Air and Weather," that every living being necessarily corrupts the air more or less by its respiration; and that the atmosphere, thus impregnated, be∣comes
<PB N="75" REF="039111_0105_10139EFEDE129008"/>
unfit for other beings to breathe in; because every expiration contains certain par∣ticles, which are separated by the lungs, as be∣ing useless and noxious to the body. How then is it conceivable, that matters or sub∣stances should be hurtful to one body, if re∣tained in it, and useful to another, if commu∣nicated to it? Or was it supposed, that the <HI>watery parts</HI> of insensible exhalation from the young body, could moisten and refresh the parched fibres of the aged? To accomplish this purpose, we are possessed of remedies much purer and more effectual. Natural warmth or heat is the only means competent to produce such a salutary effect; as that alone is capable of exciting the slumbering energy of life. And in this respect, I appre∣hend, we ought to do justice to the above-de∣scribed method practised by the ancients.</P>
<P>When young persons live or sleep with old people, and are observed to grow thin and infirm, (which however is not always the case) that proceeds from another circum∣stance, namely, that the former absorb or in∣hale the noxious particles of the latter; but from this it by no means follows, that the aged body attracts the vital principle from the younger. Although free <HI>caloric,</HI> or mat∣ter of heat, may probably pass over from the young body into that of the aged; yet this transfusion, under certain circumstances, would be rather to the advantage than disad∣vantage of the former; inasmuch as this de∣privation of superfluous caloric is not unfre∣quently found to be serviceable and whole∣some.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="039111_0106_10139F4174BA2B40"/>
From the preceding remarks we may con∣ceive, that a school-room filled with the va∣rious exhalations of children, cannot conduce to the prolongation of life; and, consequent∣ly, that the great age of certain schoolmasters must be ascribed to some other cause. An accurate account of the mortality prevailing among that class of men would satisfactorily demonstrate, that the age of schoolmasters is in a just proportion to that of other classes of society.</P>
<P>I shall now consider several other plans, that have been adopted for the prolongation of human life.</P>
<P>The Egyptians, who lived in a country rendered unwholesome by intense heat and frequent inundations, could not long remain ignorant of the comparative longevity of their northern neighbours, the Greeks. Af∣ter many fruitless attempts to discover the true cause of their short life, and to provide the means of removing that cause, they at length became fanatical enough to imagine themselves possessed of the grand secret for prolonging life—in the constant use of sudo∣rifics and emetics. The air of Egypt, being impregnated with aqueous and putrid parti∣cles, not only checked the process of perspira∣tion, but also generated various epidemic dis∣tempers. In such cases, sudorific medicines were necessary and proper; and even emet∣ics, by exciting a forcible commotion through the whole system, not unfrequently restored the activity of the cutaneous vessels, and thus produced a favourable effect in those mala∣dies.
<PB N="77" REF="039111_0107_10139F016B1E73C0"/>
Farther, the heat of the climate in∣spissated their fluids; this circumstance, con∣nected with their usual mode of life, and their crude articles of food, necessarily brought on an excess of bile, which overflowing the stom∣ach upon the least occasion, could not fail, sooner or later, to occasion very obstinate dis∣eases. The emetics, therefore, being emi∣nently qualified to evacuate the bile, would of course obtain general reputation among the Egyptians. These and the sudorifics were for a long time considered as specific remedies; from their tendency to expel the matter so dangerous to life; and because in those ages diseases were considered the <HI>only</HI> enemies to longevity: the Egyptian physi∣cians and philosophers not being able to dis∣tinguish between effects and their causes, the latter of which existed in the pestilential va∣pours of a hot climate.</P>
<P>Thus it became a custom to take at least two emetics every month; to inquire of ac∣quaintances and friends, how those medicines had operated, and to wish each other joy up∣on these occasions. I need not observe, that this singular method of prolonging life is not to be recommended as worthy of imitation; that the periodical custom of taking medici∣nal remedies renders their frequent repeti∣tion necessary, while it destroys their occa∣sional efficacy; and that it therefore chiefly belongs to the department of the physician to determine, when, and in what degree, such medicines are to be administered.</P>
<P>The Greeks lived in a more romantic and
<PB N="78" REF="039111_0108_10139F430096E8D0"/>
picturesque country; their conceptions with regard to the structure and functions of the human frame were more correct and con∣formable to nature. Their philosophers and physicians were more enlightened and less prejudiced than those of Egypt; they were not, like the latter, under the capricious in∣fluence of a wild imagination, too frequently disordered by the effects of BLACK BILE. Na∣ture, displayed in all her charms, in the sub∣lime and beautiful scenery of their country, every where invited them to the enjoyment of free and pure air; the effects of this on their susceptible nerves, combined with an excellent system of bodily exercise, proved the best specific for counteracting the effects of time, and thus prolonging their active, healthful lives. For this great and beneficial purpose, particular methods and rules were contrived, in order to give the body the most varied and effectual, yet gentle motions;—these athletic exercises were judiciously adapt∣ed to the different constitutions, situations, and ages of life, so that the sagacious Greeks arrived at an extraordinary degree of perfec∣tion in the <HI>gymnastic art.</HI></P>
<P>The great advantage of such a course of bodily exercise cannot be disputed, when we consider how many individuals in all coun∣tries die prematurely from want of activity, motion, and nervous energy; though their organization may be in no respect faulty. Besides, a body inured to frequent and labo∣rious exercise, will not be easily affected by external causes of disease; being secured, as
<PB N="79" REF="039111_0109_10139F02F26EF320"/>
it were, by a coat of mail, against the attacks of many acute disorders.</P>
<P>The Greeks carried, to a still greater de∣gree, the system of gymnastic motions. By the same method they attempted to cure dis∣eases in their first stages, not excepting such as were already formed, and to put a stop to their further progress. They caused the pa∣tient to move in various positions; they ap∣plied gentle friction to the whole surface of the body; and used different methods to overcome the languor of the muscles, by ex∣citing and stimulating the muscular energy.</P>
<P>In relaxed, weakly individuals, whose or∣ganization is deficient in the proper degree of tension or elasticity, this method must be allowed to possess great advantages; but I do not conceive it necessary to prove here, that it cannot be consistently applied to <HI>all</HI> diseases. It is not to be supposed, that the weary traveller can be either strengthened or refreshed by additional exercise.</P>
<P>The modern methods of bracing the hu∣man body, such as frequent bathing in cold water, exposing the body to all the vicissi∣tudes of climate and weather, the various modes of supporting bodily fatigue, as trav∣elling on horseback and on foot, &amp;c. which are so indiscriminately recommended to our aspiring youth, cannot in every instance for∣tify and render the human frame indestruc∣tible:—on the contrary, <HI>all such violent efforts</HI> have a tendency to bring on the symptoms of age, at a much earlier period than it ought to appear; as the joints and muscles are there∣by
<PB N="80" REF="039111_0110_10139F479AFB0F08"/>
rendered liable to contract an uncommon degree of stiffness and rigidity.—To load ten∣der youth with burthens disproportionate to their age, and to impose upon them the task of men, can never be the most proper means of hardening and preparing them for a long and active life.</P>
<P>A distinction, however, should be made here, between bracing the <HI>fibres,</HI> of which all solid parts of the body consist, and bracing the sense of <HI>touch</HI> or <HI>feeling.</HI> The animal fi∣bres may be solid, but should not be so rigid as to become insensible; a certain degree of irritability is necessary to the proper exercise of their contracting and relaxing power. If, further, there should exist in the body a dis∣position towards rigidity and insensibility, any artificial modes of bracing it will be of dangerous tendency. If, on the contrary, the fibres should be too irritable, the Grecian method may, in that case, be resorted to with safety and advantage. A striking instance of this occurs in the history of Captain Cook. On his arrival in the Friendly Islands, he was seized with an acute rheumatism, attended with excruciating pains. He was soon reliev∣ed from this torturing situation, by the easy and instinctive process of gentle friction, which the Islanders generally followed on such occasions. Thus a few untutored per∣sons completely effected what could not have been sooner, nor more easily accomplished by the systematic art of the learned.</P>
<P>From these considerations we may safely infer, 1. That the cold bath, gymnastic exer∣cises,
<PB N="81" REF="039111_0111_10139F059175E4F8"/>
bodily fatigue of any kind, and all ex∣pedients to brace and invigorate the consti∣tutions, ought only to be adopted under cer∣tain limitations, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> with a proper regard to particular cases and circumstances: and, 2. That these severe remedies cannot and ought not to be universally nor indiscriminately recommended, as methods of prolonging life.</P>
<P>Let us not, however, disparage the merits of that ingenious race of men, whom we only know from their inimitable works. For, al∣though the method of the Greeks cannot be safely introduced among us, without many and great exceptions, we must do them the justice to allow, that in their operations of hardening the human body, they proceeded in a more cautious, gradual, and judicious manner, than the moderns seem willing to submit to. Sudden changes of any kind pro∣duce a sort of revolution in the body, and this is necessarily attended with a waste of strength, proportionate to the violence of the shock.</P>
<P><HI>Plutarch</HI> possessed clear and rational ideas on the subject of preserving and prolonging human life; the truth of which he confirm∣ed by his own experience, during a series of many happy years. He advises to keep the head cool and the feet warm, not immediate∣ly to take medicines on every slight indispo∣sition, but rather to let Nature relieve herself by fasting a day, and, in attending to the mind, never to forget the body. Much learning is compressed in these golden pre∣cepts, which will be valuable as long as hu∣man
<PB N="82" REF="039111_0112_10139F4A3414FE18"/>
nature remains the same. The atten∣tion bestowed upon the mind, however lau∣dable, should not authorise us to neglect the care of the body; the intimate connexion subsisting between both requires a due pro∣portion of care and attention to be paid to each. In the same degree, as a diseased body sympathetically torments the mind, so does an infirm mind agitate and harass the body; and such tortures and reciprocal affections are unavoidably attended with the consumption of animal life.—What Plutarch enjoins, with respect to keeping the head cool and the feet warm, is agreeable to reason and experience; we should not, however, imagine, that the grand secret of prolonging life consists in the sole observance of these maxims. The head and feet are not the only points, in which life is concentrated; they may indeed have a beneficial or pernicious influence on the whole body, and in this respect they demand a shore of our attention; but no other part ought on that account to escape our notice.</P>
<P>I now enter upon a very unpleasant task, namely, that of reviewing a period of dark∣ness, during the barbarity of the middle ages, when the progress of true knowledge was obstructed by the most absurd fancies and childish conceits; when conjectures, caprices and dreams supplied the place of the most useful sciences, of the most important truths. Chemistry, so essentially requisite to explain the phenomena of known and unknown sub∣stances, fell into the hands of jugglers and fa∣natics;—their systems, replete with philo∣sophic
<PB N="83" REF="039111_0113_10139F0927DA4D10"/>
nonsense, and composed of the most crude, heterogeneous materials, served rather to nourish superstition than to establish facts and illustrate useful truths. Universal rem∣edies, in various forms, met with strenuous advocates and deluded consumers. The path of accurate observation and experiment was forsaken; far from penetrating into the mys∣terious recesses of Nature, they bewildered themselves in the labyrinth of fanciful specu∣lation; they overstepped the bounds of good sense, modesty, and truth, and the blind led the blind.</P>
<P>The prolongation of life, too, was no longer sought for in a manner agreeable to the dic∣tates of Nature; even this interesting branch of human pursuits was rendered subservient to Chemistry, or rather to the confused sys∣tem of Alchemy. <HI>Original matter</HI> was looked upon to be the elementary cause of all beings; by this they expected literally to work mira∣cles, to transmute the base into noble metals, to metamorphose man in his animal state by chemical process, to render him more dura∣ble, and to secure him against early decline and dissolution. Millions of vessels, retorts, and phials were either exposed to the action of the most violent artificial heat, or to the natural warmth of the sun; or else they were buried in some dunghill, or other fetid mass, for the purpose of apprehending this <HI>original matter,</HI> or obtaining it from putrescible sub∣stances.</P>
<P>As the substance called Gold always bore the highest value among metals, these mon∣grel
<PB N="84" REF="039111_0114_10139F4BB9584470"/>
philosophers concluded, from a ridicu∣lous analogy, that its value, with respect to the preservation of health, and the cure of diseases, must likewise surpass that of all oth∣er remedies. The nugatory art of dissolv∣ing it, so as to render it potable, and to pre∣vent it from being again converted into met∣al, employed a multitude of busy idiots, not only in concealed corners, but in the splendid laboratories of the palaces of the great. Sov∣ereigns, magistrates, counsellors, and impos∣tors, were struck with the common frenzy, entered into friendship and alliance, formed private fraternities, and sometimes proceeded to such a pitch of extravagance, as to involve themselves and their posterity in ruinous debts. The real object of many was, doubt∣less, to gratify their avarice and desire of ag∣grandisement, although this sinister motive was concealed under the specious pretext of search∣ing for a remedy, that should serve as a tinc∣ture of life, both for the healthy and diseased; yet some among these whimsical mortals were actuated by more honourable motives, zealous only for the interests of truth, and the well∣being of their fellow-creatures. The com∣mon people in some countries, particularly Italy, Germany, and France, often denied themselves the necessaries of life, to save as much as would purchase a few drops of the tincture of gold, which was offered for sale by some superstitious or fraudulent chemist: and so thoroughly persuaded were they of the efficacy of this remedy, that it afforded them in every instance the most confident and
<PB N="85" REF="039111_0115_10139F0AAEB8D4A8"/>
only hope of recovery. These beneficial ef∣fects were positively promised, but were look∣ed for in vain. All-subduing Death would not submit to be bribed with gold, and Dis∣ease refused to hold any intercourse with that powerful deity, who presides over the trade and commerce of nations.</P>
<P>As, however, these diversified and almost numberless experiments were frequently pro∣ductive of useful inventions in the arts and manufactures; and as many chemical reme∣dies of real value were thereby accidentally discovered, the great and general attention to those bold projectors, was constantly kept alive and excited. Indeed, we are indebted to their curious operations, or rather perhaps to chance, for several valuable medicines, the excellence of which cannot be disputed, but which, nevertheless, require more precaution in their use and application, and more perspi∣cacity and diligence in investigating their na∣ture and properties, than the original prepar∣ers of such articles were able or willing to af∣ford.</P>
<P>All their endeavours to prolong life, by artificial means, could not be attended with beneficial effects; and the application of the remedies thus contrived, must necessarily, in many cases, prove detrimental to the health of the patient. In proof of this assertion, it will be sufficient to give a slight sketch of the different views and opinions of the Goldma∣kers, Rosencrucians, manufacturers of Astra∣lian Salts, of the Drops of Life, and Tinctures of Gold, hunters after the Philosopher's Stone,
<PB N="86" REF="039111_0116_10139F4D4AE22200"/>
&amp;c. &amp;c. Some of these enthusiasts fancied life to resemble a flame, from which the body derived warmth, spirit, and animation. This flame they endeavoured to cherish and to in∣crease by their remedies, supplying the body with materials to feed the same, as we pour oil into a burning lamp.</P>
<P>Others imagined they had discovered some∣thing invisible and incorporeal in the air, that important medium in supporting the life of man. They pretended to catch, to refine, and so to reduce and <HI>materialize</HI> this undefin∣able something, that it might be swallowed in the form of powders or drops; that by its penetrating powers it might insinuate itself into the whole animal frame, invigorating and qualifying it for a longer and healthier duration than usual.</P>
<P>Others again were foolish enough to cher∣ish a notion, that they could divest themselves of the properties of matter during this life; that in this manner they might be defended against the gradual approaches of dissolution, to which every animal body is subject; and that thus fortified, without quitting their ter∣restrial tabernacle, they could associate at pleasure with the inhabitants of the spiritual world.</P>
<P>The Sacred Volume itself was interpreted and commented upon by the Operators and Alchemists, with a view to render it subser∣vient to their interested designs. Indisputable historical facts, recorded in this invaluable book, were treated by them as hieroglyphical symbols, which contained chemical processes:
<PB N="87" REF="039111_0117_10139F0D4047DE70"/>
and the fundamental truths of the Christian religion were applied, in a wanton and blas∣phemous manner, to the purposes of making Gold, and distilling the Elixir of Life.</P>
<P>The productions of Alchemy, far from an∣swering the purpose of prolonging life, have rather a contrary tendency. All the remedies which it affords, are of a heating and stimu∣lating nature. The person who takes them will feel himself more cheerful for some time, and on that account he may fancy himself more vigorous and juvenile; as they certain∣ly give an additional impulse to the sensations of life, like wine, spirits, and all other stim∣ulants. But this increase of the <HI>sensation of life</HI> should by no means be confounded with an increase of the <HI>power of life.</HI> It may be even safely affirmed, that by the increase of vital sensations, the career of life itself is ac∣celerated, and the consumption of it sooner exhausted; consequently the duration of the body is necessarily shortened.</P>
<P>I should not omit to mention, that these remedies strongly increase the sensitive power of man, they predispose him to sensual pur∣suits, stimulate him to commit excesses of every kind, incite him to take continual or excessive exercise, as dancing, and the like, and thus by inevitable consequence hasten the waste and dissolution of the body. That, for instance, which, according to the natural course, ought to be expended or consumed in three days, is dissipated perhaps in as many jovial hours. This premature loss is attend∣ed with relaxation, irksomeness, and even
<PB N="88" REF="039111_0118_10139F528D510EC0"/>
aversion to life, till a new dose of stimulants reproduces the former false vivacity. It fares with the patient here, as it does with the hard drinker, who trembles in the morning that follows his nightly debauch, feels his whole frame relaxed, inactive and torpid, and is in a manner obliged to take a fresh dram of his favourite liquor, before he can enter on any serious business, with pleasure or effect.</P>
<P>These famous essences, balms, tinctures of life, &amp;c. are farther dangerous, as they con∣tract the small vessels, so necessary to the preservation of life, as well as to the repara∣tion of the losses sustained, and thus render them unfit to perform their offices. Hence arise rigidity or stiffness, and exsiccation; the body shrivels, and the symptoms of old age appear at an earlier period than they would otherwise have done. Man is seldom un∣provided with the supplies of vitality;—every draught of air we inhale, and every particle of food we swallow, is a fresh accession to the stock of life. But as soon as the <HI>susceptibility</HI> or <HI>power of receiving</HI> those supplies becomes languid, we then may be considered as unfit to perform the functions of life; and all the medicaments of nature and art will be found insufficient to relieve us. He who searches for the supplies of life in alchemical produc∣tions, elixirs, balsamic essences, &amp;c. will soon∣er or later, but always prematurely, experi∣ence the want of susceptibility. Even that impudent boaster and celebrated <HI>insurer of lives,</HI> THEOPHRASTUS PARACELSUS, although he pretended to have in his possession the
<PB N="89" REF="039111_0119_10139F0FD0622B08"/>
stone of immortality, died—in his fiftieth year! His vegetable sulphur was a heating and stimulating remedy, partly similar to the Anodyne Liquor of Hoffmann.</P>
<P>The world of spirits also was invaded, and summoned, as it were, to contribute to the prolongation of human life. Spirits were supposed to have the rule of air, fire, earth, and water; they were divided into particu∣lar classes, and particular services ascribed to each. The malevolent spirits were opposed and counteracted by various means of pre∣vention: the good and tutelary were oblig∣ed to submit to a sort of gentle, involuntary servitude. From invisible beings were ex∣pected and demanded visible means of assist∣ance—riches—health—friends—and long life. Thus the poor spirits were profanely mal∣treated, nay they were sometimes punished, and even miserably flogged in effigy, when they betrayed symptoms of disaffection, or want of implicit loyalty.</P>
<P>As men had thus, in their weakness and folly, forsaken the bounds of this terrestrial sphere, it will easily be believed, that with the help of an exuberant imagination, they would make a transition to the higher re∣gions—to the celestial bodies and the stars, to which indeed they ascribed no less a power than that of deciding the destinies of men, and which, consequently, must have had a considerable share in shortening or prolonging the duration of human life. Every nation or kingdom was subjected to the dominion of its particular planet, the time of whose
<PB N="90" REF="039111_0120_10139F552D4D55F8"/>
government was determined; and a number of ascendant powers were fictitiously con∣trived, with a view to reduce under its in∣fluence every thing which was produced and born during its administration.</P>
<P>The professors of astrology appeared as the confidants of these invisible rulers, and the interpreters of their will; they very well un∣derstood the art of giving a respectable ap∣pearance to this usurped dignity. Provided they could but ascertain the hour and minute of a person's birth, they confidently took up∣on themselves to predict his mental capacities, future vicissitudes of life, diseases, together with the circumstances, the day, and the hour of his death. Not only the common people, or the less informed classes of society, but the most respectable men for learning and abilities, nay even those of the highest rank and station, did homage to those "gods of their idolatry," and lived in continual dread of their occult powers. With anxious coun∣tenances and attentive ears, they listened to the effusions of those self-appointed oracles, which prognosticated the bright or gloomy days of futurity. Even physicians were so∣licitous to qualify themselves for an appoint∣ment no less lucrative than respectable:—they forgot, over the dazzling hoards of Mam∣mon, <HI>that they were peculiarly and professedly the pupils of Nature.</HI> The curious student in the Universities found every where public Lecturers, who undertook to instruct him in the profound arts of divination, chiromancy, and the famous <HI>cabala.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="039111_0121_10139F135FF52AE8"/>
Not to mention other instances, I shall cite that of the noted <HI>Thurneisen,</HI> in the last century, who was invested at Berlin with the respective offices of Printer to the Court, Bookseller, Al∣manack-maker, Astrologer, Chemist, and First Physician. Messengers daily arrived from the most respectable houses in Germany, Poland, Hungary, Denmark, and even from England, for the purpose of consulting him respecting the future fortunes of new-born infants, ac∣quainting him with the hour of their nativity, and soliciting his advice and directions as to their management. Many volumes of this singular correspondence are still preserved in the Royal Library at Berlin. The business of this fortunate adept increased so rapidly, that he found it necessary to employ a num∣ber of subaltern assistants, who, together with their master, realized considerable fortunes. He died in high reputation and favour with his superstitious cotemporaries; and Thur∣neisen's Astrological Almanack is yet publish∣ed in some of the less enlightened provinces of Germany. But it may be asked, how it hap∣pens, that an art which determines the fate of mortals, and ascertains the impassable lim∣its of human life, can at the same time serve as the means of prolonging it? This I shall now proceed to account for. The teachers of divination maintained, that not only men, but all natural bodies, plants, animals, nay whole countries, including every individual place and family, were under the government of some particular planet. As soon as the masters of the OCCULT SCIENCE had discov∣ered,
<PB N="92" REF="039111_0122_10139F56B3F748A0"/>
by their tables, under what constellation the misfortune or distemper of any person originated, nothing further was required, than that he should remove to a dwelling ruled by an opposite planet, and confine him∣self exclusively to such articles of food and drink, as were under the influence of a dif∣ferent star. In this artificial manner; they contrived to form a system, or peculiar clas∣sification of plants, namely, lunar, solar, mer∣curial, and the like—and hence arose a con∣fused mass of dietetic rules, which, when con∣sidered with reference to the purposes of health, cleanliness, exercise, &amp;c. form a re∣markable contrast to those of the Greeks.</P>
<P>Neither was this preventive and repelling method confined merely to persons suffering under some bodily disorder. In the case of individuals who enjoyed a good state of health, if an unlucky constellation happened to forebode a severe disease, or any other misfortune, they were directed to choose a place of residence influenced by a more friend∣ly star; or to make use of such aliment only as, being under the auspices of a propitious star, might counteract the malignant influ∣ence of its adversary.</P>
<P>It was also pretty generally believed and maintained, that a sort of intimate relation or sympathy subsisted between metals and plants; hence the names of the latter were given to the former, in order to denote this supposed connexion and affinity. The corresponding metals were melted into a common mass, un∣der a certain planet, and were formed into
<PB N="93" REF="039111_0123_10139F15F265CB60"/>
small medals or coins, in hopes, and with the firm persuasion, that he who carried such a piece about his person, might confidently ex∣pect the whole favour and protection of the planet thus represented.</P>
<P>The transition from one degree of folly to another is easy; and this may help us to ac∣count for the shocking delusions practised in the manufacturing and wearing of metallic amulets of a peculiar mould, to which were attributed, by a sort of magic influence, the power and protection of the planet, to whom they related: these charms were thought to possess virtue sufficient to overrule the bad effects presaged by an unlucky hour of birth, to promote to places of honour and profit, and to be of potent efficacy in matters of commerce and matrimony. The German soldiers, in the dark and superstitious ages, believed, that if the figure of Mars, cast and en∣graved in the sign of the Scorpion, were worn about the neck as an amulet, it would render them invulnerable, and insure success to their military enterprizes: hence amulets were found upon every soldier, either killed in bat∣tle or taken prisoner.</P>
<P>But let us quit a subject which excites dis∣gust, as it exhibits such glaring deviations from reason and truth. It is much more pleasant to dwell upon examples, which af∣ford satisfactory proof, that the human mind has never been <HI>entirely and universally</HI> debased, and that there have always existed some in∣dividuals, though few in number, who would not submit their necks to the yoke of popu∣lar
<PB N="94" REF="039111_0124_10139F583A57F190"/>
prejudice, and whose superior talents and virtues rescued them from the impositions of general folly or depravity. A memorable in∣stance of this rare merit is to be found in the noble Venetian LEWIS CORNARO, whose his∣tory illustrates this agreeable and instructive truth, that nature, left to herself, or, in other words, a property chosen mode of life and di∣et, regularly persisted in, will achieve great things; and that a frame, disordered and even reduced to a state bordering on the grave, may yet be re-established, and preserve its health and vigour for a great number of years.</P>
<P>Cornaro had been a professed epicure and libertine, till he entered into the fortieth year of his age. His constitution was so far reduced by the colic, rheumatic pains, fevers, &amp;c. that his physicians at length gave him up, assuring him he could not survive much longer than two months; that no medicines whatever could avert this catastrophe, and that the only possible means of preserving his life would be a regular adherence to a frugal diet. He punctually followed this advice, perceived symptoms of convalescence within a few days after entering on his plan of ref∣ormation, and, after the lapse of twelve months, was not only completely restored, but found himself in a better state of health than he had ever been during any period of his life. He resolved therefore to confine himself to a still more parsimonious regimen, and to take nothing more than what he judg∣ed to be absolutely requisite for his support.
<PB N="95" REF="039111_0125_10139F1776BD0020"/>
Thus, during <HI>sixty</HI> years, he confined himself to exactly twelve ounces of food a day, (bread and other nourishment included) with thir∣teen ounces of beverage. It should be also observed, that during this long period he carefully avoided violent heat, cold, passions, and extremes of every kind; and by rigidly and uniformly adhering to this moderate diet, not only his body, but his mind also, acquired so determined a tone, that no com∣mon incidents could affect them. At a very advanced age he lost a law-suit, which involv∣ed pecuniary concerns of great importance, and on account of which two of his brothers died of broken hearts; but he still retained his pristine health and tranquillity. His car∣riage happening on some occasion to be over∣set, he was dragged by the horses, in conse∣quence of which his arms and legs were dis∣located. He caused them, however, to be reduced again, and, without taking any med∣icines, we find him in a short time restored.</P>
<P>A striking instance of the dangerous ef∣fects likely to attend the slightest deviation from long custom and habit, is the following: When Cornaro had reached his eightieth year, his friends prevailed upon him to add a small portion to his daily quantum of food; alleging that his advanced age neces∣sarily called for additional support. Although he was not convinced by this argument, be∣ing of opinion, that, with the general decrease of strength, our powers of digestion are like∣wise impaired, and that we ought to dimin∣ish rather than to increase our food, in pro∣portion
<PB N="96" REF="039111_0126_10139F5D29C9DC58"/>
to the decay of nature; yet he yield∣ed to the solicitations of his friends, and in∣creased his food from twelve to fourteen, and his drink from thirteen to sixteen ounces. "Scarcely," to quote the words of our die∣tetic veteran, "had I proceeded in this alter∣ed mode of living for ten days, before I found my spirits visibly affected; a fretful, peevish temper succeeded to my former cheer∣fulness and gaiety, so that I became a burden to myself and others. This change of tem∣per was followed by other symptoms still more alarming. On the twelfth day, I was attacked with a pain in my side, which con∣tinued for twenty-four hours together, and soon after found myself oppressed by a fever that raged with unabating fury for thirty-five days, so that my life was at times despaired of. By the blessing of God, however, on re∣turning to my former regimen, I recovered from this shock, and now enjoy, in my eigh∣ty-third year, perfect health of body and se∣renity of mind. I can mount my horse with∣out assistance; I can climb steep precipices, and but lately I wrote a comedy, abounding with traits of innocent mirth and raillery. When I return home, after being engaged in my private affairs, or from attending the councils of state, I feel inexpressible satisfac∣tion in the company of my grandchildren, eleven in number, whose education, amuse∣ment, and songs, are the comfort of my age. I frequently join them in singing, as my voice is now stronger and clearer than I ever knew it to be in my youth, and as my happiness is
<PB N="97" REF="039111_0127_10139F1915AF73E0"/>
not disturbed by the complaints, the morose∣ness, and discontented humours, so frequent∣ly the lot of intemperate old age."</P>
<P>In this happy frame of body and mind, Cornaro attained to his hundredth year; his virtuous and memorable example, however, has hitherto had but few followers. He found by <HI>actual observation</HI> and <HI>experience,</HI> that a strict and uniform regimen, or a regular daily allowance of food and drink, ascertained by weight, was the best method <HI>he</HI> could pur∣sue, for the purpose of prolonging his life. He did not wish however to be understood, nor does it follow in general, that this or any other precise portion of nutriment is to be held out as a proper standard, by which <HI>all persons</HI> are to regulate their diet. His advice, that we should take no more food than what is absolutely necessary to our subsistence, may be thus explained; namely, that the restora∣tion of strength, derived from supplies of nu∣triment, ought to bear an exact proportion to the losses sustained by the body. He, for in∣stance, who spends little of his time in bed, and much in the open air, takes frequent ex∣ercise, is constantly employed in some labo∣rious occupation, makes long journies on foot or horseback, or the like, will feel himself re∣freshed and strengthened after partaking of a plentiful meal, and cheering beverage; and such a repast is even indispensable to him, to recruit the sources of his muscular strength and activity. If, on the other hand, a person who lounges away half of his time in bed, or upon the sofa, were to consume a quantity of
<PB N="98" REF="039111_0128_10139F5EAFB808B0"/>
food equal to the former, he would no doubt feel himself heavy and uncomfortable. Yet here too, the consequent loss of strength may vary in degree, in different sedentary persons; and this circumstance will afford me an op∣portunity, in the sequel, to apply to individ∣ual cases the doctrine suggested by the expe∣rience of Cornaro.</P>
<P>There was another period, during which <HI>blood-letting</HI> came into general use, and obtain∣ed great credit, as one of the most effectual means of prolonging life: the superfluity and vitiated state of the blood, or what physicians term a <HI>plethoric habit,</HI> being looked upon, at the same time, as a principal means of short∣ening life. Through the veins thus regular∣ly opened, at certain seasons, the superfluous or vitiated blood was supposed to be emitted, while that of a more salubrious quality was left behind. Considered as a medical reme∣dy, phlebotomy must certainly be allowed to possess its uses, and it is sometimes a necessary expedient, to produce an immediate diminu∣tion in the fulness of the blood, particularly when the time is too short, and the danger too pressing, to admit of any other method for effecting that purpose. As there can be no doubt, that blood-letting is an invaluable remedy in many disorders, it is the more pe∣culiarly incumbent on the practical physician, to distinguish with care those cases, in which imminent danger may be averted, and health restored by the use of it. I am of opinion, that there are two cases, and only two, in which venesection is likely to be attended
<PB N="99" REF="039111_0129_10139F1DB7C1E918"/>
with real advantage; 1st, When it is requir∣ed to prevent the fluids gaining access to the parts more essential to life; and, 2dly, Where means must be speedily used, to counteract a threatened inflammation in the intestines. But, even in these two cases, the intelligent physician is at no loss for other remedies, which may be frequently administered with a greater probability of success. In the treat∣ment of every disorder, it is necessary to single out that remedy, which is found most suitable to the stage of the complaint. And here we have no occasion to start the question, Whether the method and the means, by which the disease is checked and health restored, are, in the end, best calculated to prolong the life of the patient? Physicians professionally look upon every disease as an evil, which cannot be too speedily removed; and it would be to hazard the recovery of their patients, in ma∣ny cases, were they to waste time in reflecting upon the consequences of the remedy with respect to its influence on the duration of life. Hence the art of prolonging life, strictly speaking, is not a distinct branch of medicine, but rather forms a separate art, and as such is the common property of all: it should therefore constitute a part of the education and studies of every rational individual, what∣ever be his other engagements and occupa∣tions. The absurd notion, that blood-letting is useful and necessary to the prolongation of human life, is still pretty generally received among the common people of all countries. Neither the <HI>good</HI> nor the <HI>bad</HI> days, supersti∣tiously
<PB N="100" REF="039111_0130_10139F61474ADA10"/>
marked in the almanacks for amusing the vulgar, can palliate or justify the mis∣chiefs, with which this dangerous error is pregnant. Bleeding can be of service only, when it is performed at a proper time; and to express my opinion of it, in a few words, <HI>it is always noxious to the healthy.</HI></P>
<P>The blood contains and affords to the bones, ligaments, tendons, membranes, mus∣cles, nerves, vessels, in short, to the whole or∣ganized body, all the parts, which form the bones, ligaments, tendons, &amp;c. Each of these parts is evolved from the blood, and adapted to its proper place, in so artificial a manner, that the human mind is totally at a loss to comprehend, how this operation is perform∣ed; neither have the researches of the most acute and attentive observers been able to ac∣count for it. And as the blood serves to re∣plenish the diminution, and to make up the losses, which those parts occasionally sustain, it may be considered as the original source of our whole organization. By its stimulating powers it also causes the heart and the arte∣ries to contract; and by that means preserves the circulating motion, by which it is pro∣pelled through all the parts of the body, for the purposes designed by nature.</P>
<P>Now, it requires little reflection to perceive, that he who wastes this vital fluid, thereby obstructs, and, as it were, cuts off the sources of his support and regeneration. And though it be true, that the blood evacuated by pe∣riodical bleedings is soon re-produced by the activity of the vital powers, yet this restora∣tion
<PB N="101" REF="039111_0131_10139F1F42BA8C20"/>
is not effected without considerable ef∣forts, and at the expense of the whole ma∣chine. As this exertion, therefore, is a great pressure upon the vital powers, it must of course be attended with a proportionate de∣gree of their consumption. It is too well known, that the corrupted part of the blood cannot be separated from the mass, so that the sound and uncorrupted particles alone may remain behind. If the quality of the blood ever become vitiated and diseased; if it be too thick and viscous, or too acrid, and dissolved, the whole mass participates in the infectious taint; neither is it in the power of art, to contrive any method, by which the corrupted part may be kept asunder, from that which is in a sound state. It would be equally unreasonable to expect, that a spoiled cask of wine could be cured of its tartness, by drawing or tapping the acid and corrupt∣ed portion from the top, and leaving the sweet and wholesome part behind. Lastly, experience has shewn in numberless instances, collected from different observations, that per∣sons accustomed to frequent blood-letting are not only rendered more delicate in their con∣stitutions, and thereby more subject to dis∣eases, but also that they die, for the most part, at an earlier age than others; and al∣though cases have occurred of some persons, who, having been bled twice or four times a year, have nevertheless arrived at a consider∣able age, they can only prove, that venesec∣tion was to them a proper medical remedy, perhaps adapted to their peculiar habit of
<PB N="102" REF="039111_0132_10139F64FAEC8C88"/>
body; or that the activity of their vital pow∣ers, their mode of life, and other favourable circumstances, internal and external, may have been sufficient to counterbalance the dangerous consequences, resulting from the frequent loss of this essential fluid.</P>

<HEAD>On the Doctrine of Transfusion.</HEAD>
<P>AT a time, when the shortness of life was imputed to a distempered state of the blood; when all diseases were ascribed to this cause, without attending to the <HI>whole</HI> of what re∣lates to the moral and physical nature of man, a conclusion was easily formed, that a radical removal of the corrupted blood, and a com∣plete renovation of the entire mass, by sub∣stitution, was both practicable and effectual. The speculative mind of man was not at a loss to devise expedients, or rather attempts, for effecting this desirable purpose; and this undoubtedly was one of the boldest, most ex∣traordinary, and most ingenious attempts ever made to lengthen the period of human life. I allude here to the famous scheme of <HI>transfusion,</HI> or of <HI>introducing the blood of one an∣imal body into that of another;</HI> a curious discov∣ery, attributed to ANDREAS LIBAVIUS, Pro∣fessor of Medicine and Chemistry in the Uni∣versity of Halle, who, in the year 1615, pub∣licly recommended experimental essays to as∣certain the fact. Libavius was an honest and spirited opposer of the Theosophic Sys∣tem,
<PB N="103" REF="039111_0133_10139F21D8EA7AA0"/>
founded by the bombastic Paracelsus, and supported by a numerous tribe of cred∣ulous and frantic followers. Although Li∣bavius was not totally exempt from the fash∣ionable follies of that age, since he believed in the transmutation of metals, and suggested to his pupils the wonderful powers of <HI>potable gold;</HI> yet he distinguished rational Alchemy from the fanatical systems then in vogue, and zealously defended the former against the disciples of Galen, as well as those of Para∣celsus. He made a number of important dis∣coveries in Chemistry, and was unquestiona∣bly the first professor in Germany, who read Chemical Lectures, upon pure principles of affinity, unconnected with the extravagant notions of the Theosophists.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>As this remarkable sect was founded upon the doctrines of Par∣acelsus, during the latter part of the sixteenth and the beginning of the seventeenth centuries; and as the society known by the name of Rosecrucians, or Rosencrucians, has not been without its followers and propagators, in different shapes, even to the present time, I shall here present the reader with a concise account of the origin and ten∣ets of that fanatical sect.</P>
<P>We find this order fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> publicly announced to the world, in a book published in the German language, at Regensburg, in the year 1614, with the following title: "<HI>The Universal and General Reformation of the World, together with an Account of the famous Fraternity of the Rosencrucians.</HI>" In the work is an intimation, that the members of the society had been secretly at work, for a century preceding, and that they had come to the knowledge of many great and important secrets, which, if communicated to the world, would promote the happiness of man. An adventurer of the name of CHRISTIAN ROSENKREUZ is said to have founded this order, in the fourteenth century, after being previously initiated into the sublime wisdom of the East, during his travels in Egypt and Fez. According to what we can learn from this work, the intention of the founder, and the final aim of the society, appear to have been to accumulate wealth and riches, by means of secrets known only to the members; and by a proper distribution of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se treasures among princes and poten∣tates, to promote the grand scheme of the society, by producing "<HI>a general revolution of all things.</HI>" In their "Confession of Faith" are many bold and singular dogmas; among others, that the end of the world is at hand; that a general reformation of men and manners will speedily take place; that the wicked shall be expelled or sub∣dued, the Jews converted, and the doctrine of Christ propagated over the whole earth. The Rosencrucians not only believed that these events must happen; but they also endeavoured to accelerate the same by their exertions. To their faithful votaries and followers they promised abundance of celestial wisdom, unspeakable riches, exemp∣tion from disease, an immortal state of ever-blooming youth, and, above all, <HI>the Philosopher's Stone.</HI> Learning and culture of the mind were, by this order, considered as superfluous, and despised. They found all knowledge contained in the Bible: this however, has been supposed rather a pretext to obviate a charge, which has been brought against them, of not believing in the Christian religion. The truth is, they consider themselves as superior to Divine Revelation, and be∣lieve every useful acquisition, every virtue, to be derived from the influence of the Deity on the soul of man. In this, as well as many other respects, they appear to be followers of Paracelsus, whom they profess to revere as a messenger of the Divinity. Like him, they pre∣tend to cure all diseases, through <HI>Faith</HI> and the power of imagina∣tion;—to heal the most mortal disorders by a touch, or even by sim∣ply looking at the patient. The Universal Remedy was likewise a grand secret of the order, the discovery of which was promised to all its faithful members.</P>
<P>I think it unnecessary to enumerate any more of such impious fan∣cies, if the founder of this still lurking sect, now partly revived, had not asserted with astonishing effrontery, that human life was capable of prolongation, like a fire kept up by combustible matter, and that he was in the possession of a secret, which could verify his assertion. It is evident, however, from the testimony of the above mentioned Libavius, a man of unquestionable veracity, that this doughty cham∣pion in Medical Chemistry, or rather Alchemy, Paracelsus, notwith∣standing his vaunting assurances, died at Salzburg in Germany, in the Hospital of St. Stephen's in 1541; and that his death was prin∣cipally brought on by the irregular and dissolute mode of life, which he had for a long time pursued.</P></NOTE></P>

The first experiments relative to the trans∣fusion of the blood, appear to have been made, and that with great propriety, on the lower animals. The blood of the young, healthy, and vigorous, was transfused into the old and infirm, by means of a delicate tube, placed in a vein opened for that purpose. The effect of this operation was surprising and important: the aged and decrepit animals were soon ob∣served to become more lively, and to move
<PB N="105" REF="039111_0135_10139F2472A98B20"/>
with greater ease and rapidity. By the inde∣fatigable exertions of LOWER, in England, of DENIS, in France, and of MORITZ HOFFMAN, and others, in Germany, this artificial mode of renovating the life and spirits was success∣fully followed up, and even brought to some degree of perfection. The vein usually open∣ed in the arm of a patient was resorted to for the purpose of transfusion; into this a small tube was placed in a perpendicular direction; the same vein was then opened in a healthy individual, but more frequently in an animal, into which another tube was forced in a re∣clining direction; both the small tubes were then slided into one another; and in that po∣sition the delicate act of transfusion was safely performed. When the operation was com∣pleted, the vein was tied up in the same man∣ner as in blood-letting. Sometimes a quan∣tity of blood was discharged from the patient, previous to the experiment taking place. As few persons however were to be found, who would agree to part with their blood to oth∣ers, recourse was generally had to animals, and most frequently to the calf, the lamb, and the stag. These being laid upon a table, and tied so as to be unable to move, the opera∣tion was performed in the manner before de∣scribed.</P>
<P>In some instances, the good effects of these experiments were evident and promising, while they excited the greatest hopes of the future improvement and progress of this new art. But the increasing abuses, to which it led bold and inexpert practitioners, together
<PB N="106" REF="039111_0136_10139F6917314180"/>
with the great number of cases, wherein it proved unsuccessful, induced the different governments of Europe to put an entire stop to the practice, by the strictest prohibitions. And, indeed, so long as the constitutions of men differ from each other materially as they now do, this is, and ever will be, a hazard∣ous, if not a desperate remedy. The blood of every individual is <HI>sui generis,</HI> or of a pecu∣liar nature, and suits or accords, as it were, with that body <HI>only,</HI> to which it belongs, and in which it is generated. Hence our hopes of prolonging human life, by artificial evac∣uations and injections, must necessarily be dis∣appointed.</P>
<P>We are not however to suppose, that these and similar pursuits, during the times of which we treat as well as those which succeeded, were solely or chiefly followed by mere ad∣venturers and fanatics. No; the greatest wits and geniuses of those times, together with the most learned and eminent men, deemed them objects worthy of their sedulous attention. LORD BACON, that sagacious explorer of the ar∣cana of Nature, that luminary of science and talents, represents life as a flame, which is continually wasted by the surrounding atmos∣phere, and asserts that <HI>all the fluids</HI> of the body may from time to time be renovated, and re∣quire such renovation. The remedies, which he prefers and prescribes, are conformable to this hypothesis. To prevent the <HI>external</HI> con∣sumption produced by the circumambient air, he recommends the bath, and, after quitting it, friction with oils and salves, with a view
<PB N="107" REF="039111_0137_10139F274DA149D0"/>
to fortify the pores, and exclude the influence of the external air. As means to counteract the <HI>internal</HI> waste of the body, he inculcates the propriety of a cooling, moderate diet, and, above all, extols the narcotic or soporific rem∣edies, as the true balm of life, and the best adapted to attain the desired effect. Tran∣quillity of mind, and a cooling diet, may no doubt be very necessary in some cases, where there is too great an irritability of tempera∣ment, and where the circulation of the blood is too rapid. But to a phlegmatic habit, they will rather be injurious than serviceable. Nar∣cotic remedies, too, are but ill qualified to cool and to moderate the body, since they never fail to act as a certain stimulus, are at∣tended with heat and relaxation, and there∣fore must accelerate the consumption of the vital powers: that sleep, also, which is artifi∣cial, and which they have a tendency to pro∣cure, cannot upon the whole be salutary. It is no less evident, that the vital power sup∣plied by heat or <HI>caloric</HI> (which is principally evolved from the air,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We shall have occasion to institute a particular inquiry into the properties of <HI>air,</HI> in the next Chapter, from which it will appear, that one species of air is more noxious to the vital power than an∣other, and that there is a greater consumption of it in one, than in the other.</NOTE> and introduced into the body by means of respiration) must be much less considerable during sleep, than while we are awake.</P>
<P>For improving the fluids of the aged, and renovating the dry and corrupted part of them, Lord Bacon thinks nothing can be put in competition with powerful laxatives, and
<PB N="108" REF="039111_0138_10139F6BB3C73020"/>
advises the use of a full course of them, every two or three years at least. These remedies are, in his opinion, the best qualified to evac∣uate vitiated humours, and afterwards to pro∣duce, in lieu of them, milder and more heal∣thy juices. The exhausted, and, as it were, thirsty vessels may be replenished and strength∣ened, according to his ideas, by a refreshing and nourishing diet.</P>
<P>However plausible this theory may appear, the execution of it is impracticable, and the basis on which it rests, merely conjectural. If it were possible to withdraw the corrupted part of the fluids from the body, by means of evacuants, and at the same time to remove the <HI>causes,</HI> which produce this tendency to corruption, then the doctrine laid down by Lord Bacon would deserve every praise, and the most minute attention to its merits. But it ought to be observed, that the activity and energy of <HI>the whole</HI> organized system is indis∣pensably necessary in the process of separating the noxious or useless particles. As, there∣fore, laxatives remove only the more watery fluids; as they have a bad effect on the stom∣ach and intestines, by rendering them too ir∣ritable, and consequently less tonic or vigor∣ous; as the bile, a fluid so essential to the concoction of food and assimilation of ali∣mentary matter, is thereby uselessly wasted; as the balance between the solid and fluid parts of the body is in this manner destroy∣ed; and as, upon the whole, the vital powers must sustain a considerable degree of diminu∣tion in affording supplies, to repair what is
<PB N="109" REF="039111_0139_10139F2AF767A7A0"/>
lost;—the precarious nature of <HI>evacuants,</HI> as the means of prolonging human life, appears too evident to require further illustration.</P>
<P>It is not, therefore, in such remedies as these, which can only be employed with safe∣ty, where a judicious attention is paid to the case and circumstances of the patient, that we ought to confide, as the most proper to pro∣long the period of our existence: we must search for means less dangerous and more ef∣fectual.</P>
<P>There is a pretty numerous class of men, who profess to calculate the length of their lives, not so much by the number of years or days they have lived, as by the use they have made of them, or, to speak more plainly, by the quantum of sensual pleasure they have en∣joyed. Persons of this cast, though fully sen∣sible of the unavoidable consequences, are not averse to what is called <HI>fast living.</HI> Accus∣tomed to reckon only upon the enjoyments of life, they wish to attain these in a shorter period of time, and in more rapid success<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, rather than slowly and by degrees; especially as the duration of our life ever remains un∣certain. Men of this sanguine character may be aptly compared to a plant forced in a hot∣house, which will indeed grow up suddenly, but, if contrasted with a plant of flower growth, or any kind of fruit which gradu∣ally ripens to maturity, will be found much degenerated, neither possessing the solidity and strength of stalk, nor the astringent, aro∣matic, and other properties, in that vigour and perfection, which we find in vegetables
<PB N="110" REF="039111_0140_10139F6D831DED88"/>
raised in the open air. Many similar hot∣house plants are discoverable among men, in the different stages of society. In childhood, they display the premature acquirements of youth; in youth, they show the sense, am∣bition, and other qualifications of manhood; and before they have well passed through the prime of virility, they are either snatched away by untimely death, or their faculties become blunted and impaired.</P>
<P>It is the unalterable plan of Nature, to pro∣ceed, in every one of her operations, by de∣grees; all outrage and extravagance militate against her established laws. The <HI>true</HI> enjoy∣ment of life does not consist in the hasty pur∣suit of pleasure, nor in the intemperate indul∣gence of our sensual appetites. The epicure is soon laid up by dangerous surfeit, resulting from indulgence in a variety of highly-fla∣voured dishes, and is obliged to spend that time in reluctant confinement, which he pro∣posed to devote to his bottle, to his debauch∣ery, or to some scene of gaiety; he is com∣pelled to lead as it were a vegetable life, scarcely pitied by his friends, and, in the fullest sense of the word, to <HI>exist</HI> rather than to <HI>live.</HI></P>

<P>"This zeal for knowledge is truly edifying, especially as the trac∣tors are generously presented to the public at <HI>only</HI> five guineas a pair; and it is clear that one pair would suffice to cure all the burns and scalds of a large parish. Why are not such luculent experiments repeated here? If Mr. P. or any admirer of the discovery, would submit to have a red-hot poker run into some part of his body not necessary to life (into <HI>that part where honour's lodged,</HI> according to Butler, for example,) in any public coffee-house within the bills of mortality, and would afterwards heal the wound in presence of the company, in ten minutes, or in half as many hours, by means of the tractors, the most stony-hearted infidel could not resist such a dem∣onstration. Why trifle with internal inflammations, when such an outward and visible sign might be afforded?</P>
<P>"Mr Perkins has taken some pains, in the first part of his pam∣phlet, to shew that the operation of his rods is not derived from an∣imal magnetism. In our opinion, this is an unnecessary piece of trouble in England, where there is a constant succession of similar pretensions. The <HI>virgula divinator<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a,</HI> and the <HI>baguette</HI> of the juggler, are the genuine prototypes of this mystery.

<P>The visionary system of JACOB BÖHMEN has lately been revived in some parts of Ger∣many.

New and unheard-of prophets an∣nounce their Divine mission, and, what is worse, find implicit believers! The inventors of secret medicines are rewarded by patents, and obtain no small celebrity; while some of the more conscientious, but less fortunate adepts, endeavour to amuse the public with <HI>popular systems of medicine!</HI> These, however,
<PB N="113" REF="039111_0143_10139F2F1C3509F0"/>
are harmless, in comparison with the daring experiments, of which I shall briefly sketch the history.</P>
<P>One of the most dazzling and successful In∣ventors in modern times was MESSMER, who began his career of Medical Knight-errantry at Vienna. His house was the mirror of high life; the rendezvous of the gay, the young, the opulent, enlivened and entertained with continual concerts, routs, and illuminations. At a great expense he imported into Germa∣ny the first <HI>Harmonica</HI> from this country; he established cabinets of natural curiosities, and laboured constantly and secretly in his chem∣ical laboratory; so that he acquired the repu∣tation of being a great Alchemist, a philoso∣pher studiously employed in the most useful and important researches.</P>
<P>In 1766 he first publicly announced the ob∣ject and nature of his secret labours:—all his discoveries centered in the <HI>magnet</HI>—which, according to his hypothesis, was the greatest and safest remedy hitherto proposed against all diseases incident to the human body. This declaration of Messmer excited very general attention; the more so, as about the same time he established an hospital in his own house, into which he admitted a number of patients <HI>gratis.</HI> Such disinterestedness pro∣cured, as might be expected, no small addition to his same. He was, besides, fortunate in gaining over many celebrated physicians to espouse his opinions, who lavished the greatest encomiums on his new art, and were instru∣mental in communicating to the public a
<PB N="114" REF="039111_0144_10139F7515B918A0"/>
number of successful experiments. This seems to have surpassed the expectations of Messmer, and induced him to extend his original plan farther than it is likely he first intended. We find him soon afterwards assuming a more dogmatical and mysterious air, when, for the purpose of shining exclusively, he appeared in the character of a <HI>Magician</HI>—his pride and egotism would brook neither equal nor com∣petitor.</P>
<P>The common Loadstone, or Mineral Mag∣net, which is so well known, did not appear to him sufficiently important and mysterious: he contrived an unusual and unknown one, to the effect of which he gave the name of '<HI>Animal Magnetism.</HI>' After this he proceeded to a still bolder assumption, every where giv∣ing it out, that the inconceivable powers of this subtle fluid were centered in his own person. Now the Mono-drama began; and Messmer, at once the hero and chorus of the piece, performed his part in a masterly man∣ner. He placed the most nervous, hysteric, and hypochondriac patients opposite to him; and by the sole act of stretching forth his fin∣ger, made them feel the most violent shocks. The effects of this wonderful power excited universal astonishment; its activity and pen∣etrability being confirmed by unquestionable testimonies, from which it appeared, that blows, resembling those given by a blunt iron, could be imparted by the operator, while he himself was separated by two doors, nay even by thick walls. The very looks of this Prince of Jugglers had the power to excite painful cramps and twitches.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="039111_0145_10139F30BAA45058"/>
This wonderful tide of success easily insti∣gated his indefatigable genius to bolder at∣tempts, especially as he had no severe criti∣cisms to apprehend from the superstitious multitude. He roundly asserted things, of which he never offered the least shadow of proof; and for the truth of which he had no other pledge to offer, but his own high repu∣tation. At one time he could communicate his magnetic power to paper, wool, silk, bread, leather, stones, water, &amp;c.—at another he pro∣nounced, that certain individuals possessed a greater degree of susceptibility for this power than others.</P>
<P>It must be owned, however, to the honour of his cotemporaries, that many of them made it their business to encounter his ex∣travagant pretensions, and to refute his dog∣matical assertions with the most convincing arguments. Yet he long enjoyed the triumph of being supported by blind followers; and their too great number completely overpow∣ered the suffrages of reason.</P>
<P>Messmer perceived at length, that he should never be able to reach, in his native country, the point which he had fixed upon, as the term of his magnetical career. The Germans began to discredit his pompous claims; but it was only after repeated failures in some im∣portant promised cures, that he found him∣self under the necessity of seeking protection in Paris. There he met with a most flattering reception, being caressed, and in a manner adored, by a nation which has ever been ex∣travagantly fond of every thing new, whim∣sical,
<PB N="116" REF="039111_0146_10139F769C73B8D0"/>
and mysterious. Messmer well knew how to turn this national propensity to his own advantage. He addressed himself partic∣ularly to the weak; to such as wished to be considered men of profound knowledge, but who, when they are compelled to be silent from real ignorance, take refuge under the impenetrable shield of mystery. The fashion∣able levity, the irresistible curiosity, and the peculiar turn of the Parisians, ever solicitous to have something interesting for conversa∣tion, to keep their active imagination in play, were exactly suited to the genius and talents of the inventor of Animal Magnetism. We need not wonder, therefore, if he availed him∣self of their moral and physical character, to insure easy entrance to his doctrines, and suc∣cess to his pretended experiments: in fact, he found friends and admirers, wherever he made his appearance.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His first advertisement was couched in the following high-sound∣ing t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rms: "Behold a discovery which promises unspeakable advan∣tages to the human race, and immortal same to its author! Behold the dawn of an universal revolution! A new race of men shall arise, shall overspread the earth, to embellish it with their virtues, and ren∣der it fertile by their industry. Neither vice, nor ignorance, shall stop their active career; they will know our calamities only from the records of history. The prolonged duration of their life will en∣able them to plan and accomplish the most laudable undertakings. The tranquil, the innocent gratifications of that primeval age will be restored, wherein man laboured without toil, lived without sorrow, and expired without a groan! Mothers will no longer be subject to pain and danger during their pregnancy and child-birth; their pro∣geny will be more robust and brave; education's now rugged and difficult path will be rendered smooth and easy; and hereditary com∣plaints and diseases will be for ever banished from the future auspi∣cious race.

Messmer, the greatest of philosophers, the most virtuous of men, the physician and saviour of mankind, charitably opens his arms to all his fellow-mortals, who stand in need of comfort and assistance. No wonder that the cause of Magnetism, under such a zealous apostle, rapidly gained ground, and obtained every day large additions to the number of its converts. To the gay, the nervous, and the dissipated of all ranks and ages, it held out the most flattering promises. Men of the first respectability interested them∣selves in behalf of this new philosophy; they anticipated, in idea, the more happy and more vigorous race to proceed, as it were by enchantment, from the wonderful impulsive powers of Animal Magnetism. Nay, even the French Government was so far seduced by these flattering appearances, as to offer the German Adventurer <HI>thirty thousand livres</HI> for the communication of his secret art. He ap∣pears, however, to have understood his own interest better than thus to dispose of his hy∣pothetical property, which upon a more ac∣curate investigation might be excepted against, as consisting of unfair articles of purchase. He consequently returned the following an∣swer to the credulous French Ministers:—
<PB N="118" REF="039111_0148_10139F792A6ACB90"/>
"That Dr. M. considered his art of too great importance, and the abuses it might lead to, too dangerous for him at present to make it public; that he must therefore reserve to himself the time of its publication, and mode of introducing it to general use and observa∣tion; that he would first take proper mea∣sures to initiate or prepare the minds of men, by exciting in them a susceptibility of this great power; and that he would then under∣take to communicate his secret gradually, which he meant to do without hope of re∣ward."</P>
<P>Messmer, too politic to part with his secret for so small a premium, had a better prospect in view; and his apparent disinterestedness and hesitation served only to sound an over∣curious public; to allure more victims to his delusive practices; and to retain them more firmly in their implicit belief. Soon after this, we find Messmer easily prevailed upon to institute a private society, into which none were admitted, but such as bound themselves by a vow to perpetual secrecy. These pupils he agreed to instruct in his important myste∣ries, on condition of each paying him a fee of <HI>one hundred louis.</HI> In the course of six months, having had not fewer than three hundred such pupils, he realized a fortune of <HI>thirty thousand louis.</HI> It appears, however, that his disciples did not long adhere to their engage∣ment: we find them separating gradually from their professor, and establishing schools for the propagation of his system, with a view, no doubt, to reimburse themselves for their
<PB N="119" REF="039111_0149_10139FB7E94231E0"/>
expenses in the acquisition of the magnetising art. But few of them having clearly under∣stood the enigmatic terms and mysterious doctrines of their foreign master, every new adept exerted himself to excel his fellow-la∣bourers, in additional explanations and inven∣tions: others, who did not possess, or could not spare the sum of one hundred louis, were industriously employed in attempts to discov∣er the secret by their own ingenuity; and thus arose a great variety of magnetical sects. At length, however, Messmer's authority be∣came suspected; his pecuniary acquisitions were now notorious, and our <HI>humane</HI> and <HI>dis∣interested philosopher</HI> was assailed with critical and satirical animadversions from every quar∣ter. The futility of his process for medical purposes, as well as the bad consequences it might produce in a moral point of view, soon became topics of common conversation, and at length excited even the apprehensions of Government. One dangerous effect of the magnetic associations was, that young volup∣tuaries began to employ this art, to promote their libidinous and destructive designs.</P>
<P>As soon as matters had taken this serious turn, the French Government, much to its credit, deputed four respectable and unpreju∣diced men, to whom were afterwards added four others of great learning and abilities, to inquire into, and appreciate the merits of the new discovery of animal magnetism. These phi∣losophers, among whom we find the illustrious names of Franklin and Lavoisier, recognized indeed very surprising and unexpected phe∣nomena
<PB N="120" REF="039111_0150_10139F7BCB38C998"/>
in the physical state of magnetised in∣dividuals; but they gave it as their opinion, that the power of imagination, and not ani∣mal magnetism, had produced these effects. Sensible of the superior influence, which the imagination can exert on the human body, when it is effectually wrought upon, they perceived, after a number of experiments and facts frequently repeated, that <HI>Contact</HI> or Touch, <HI>Imagination, Imitation,</HI> and <HI>excited Sensi∣bility,</HI> were the real and <HI>sole</HI> causes of those phenomena, which had so much confounded the illiterate, the credulous, and the enthusi∣astic; that this boasted magnetic element had no real existence in nature; consequently that Messmer himself was either an arrant Impos∣tor, or a deceived Fanatic.</P>
<P>In the mean time, this magnetising business had made no small progress in Germany; a number of periodical and other publications vindicated its claims to public favour and at∣tention; and some literary men, who had rendered themselves justly celebrated by their former writings, now appeared as bold and eager champions in support of this mystical medley. The ingenious LAVATER undertook long journies for the propagation of Magnet∣ism and Somnabulism<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Somnabulism</HI> is the art of exciting sleep in persons under the in∣fluence of Animal Magnetism, with a view to obtain, or rather ex∣tort, during this artificial sleep, their verbal declarations and direc∣tions for curing the diseases of body and mind. Such was the rage for propagating this mystical nonsense, that even the pulpit was oc∣casionally resorted to, in order to make—not fair penit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s, but fair proselytes to the system.</NOTE>—and what manipula∣tions and other absurdities were not practised on hysterical young ladies in the city of Bre∣men?
<PB N="121" REF="039111_0151_10139FBBCF153C90"/>
It is further worthy of notice, that an eminent physician of that place, in a recent publication, does not scruple to rank magnet∣ism among medical remedies! Yet it must be confessed, that the great body of the learned, throughout Germany, have endeavoured, by strong and impartial criticism, to oppose and refute Animal Magnetism, considered as a medical system. And how should it be other∣wise, since it is highly ridiculous to imagine, that violent agitations, spasms, convulsions, &amp;c. which are obviously symptoms of a dis∣eased state, and which must increase rather than diminish the disposition for nervous dis∣eases, can be the means of improving the con∣stitution, and ultimately prolonging human life? Every attentive person must have ob∣served, that too frequent intercourse between nervous and hypochondriac patients is infec∣tious; and, if this be the case, public assem∣blies for exhibiting persons magnetised can neither be safe nor proper. It is no small proof of the good sense of the people of this country, that the professors of this fanatical art could not long maintain their ground; that they were soon exposed to public ridi∣cule on the stage; and that the few who are still left, are banished to dark alleys and ob∣scure cellars of the metropolis.</P>
<P>Some other plans for the prolongation of life deserve to be mentioned, though scarcely less absurd than the preceding.</P>
<P>The French Count of ST. GERMAIN made large sums, by vending an artificial Tea, chiefly, composed of Yellow-Saunders, Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>na-leaves,
<PB N="122" REF="039111_0152_10139F7F705379A8"/>
and Fennel-seed; passing it off by the specious name of <HI>Tea for prolonging life.</HI> It was once swallowed with great avidity all over the continent; but its celebrity was short-lived, and its promised beneficial effects were never realized.</P>
<P>Another impudent adventurer, the <HI>Cheva∣lier</HI> D'AILHOUD, presented the world with a Powder, which met with so large and rapid a sale, that he was very soon enabled to pur∣chase a whole <HI>Comté.</HI> Instead, however, of adding to the means of securing health and long life, this famous powder is well known to produce constant indisposition, and at length to cause a most miserable death; be∣ing compounded of certain drugs, which are clearly of a poisonous nature, although slow in their operation. And yet there are on the continent, even to this day, several re∣spectable families, who persist in the use of this deleterious powder, from an ill-judged partiality for its inventor.</P>
<P>COUNT CAGLIOSTRO, that luminary of modern Impostors and Debauchees, prepared a very common stomachic Elixir, which he sold at an enormous price, by the name of "<HI>Balm of Life;</HI>" pretending, with unparallel∣ed assurance, that by the use of this medicine he had attained an age exceeding 200 years, and that he was thereby rendered invulnera∣ble to all attempts by poison. These bold as∣sertions could not fail to excite very general attention. During his residence at Strasburg, while he was descanting, in a large and re∣spectable company, on the virtues of his an∣tidote,
<PB N="123" REF="039111_0153_10139FBD53FF4EF8"/>
his pride was mortified by a severe check. A Physician who was present, and had taken part in the conversation, quitting the room privately, went to an Apothecary's shop, where having ordered two pills to be made of an equal size, and agreeably to his directions, he suddenly appeared again before Cagliostro, and addressed him as follows: "Here, my worthy Count, are two pills; the one contains a mortal poison, the other is perfectly innocent; choose one of these, and swallow it, and I engage to take that which you leave. This will be considered as a de∣cisive proof of your medical skill, and enable the public to ascertain the efficacy of your extolled Elixir." Cagliostro took the alarm, made a number of apologies, but could not be prevailed upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o touch the pills. His opponent swallowed both immediately, and proved by his Apothecary, that they might be taken with the most perfect safety, being on∣ly made of common bread. Notwithstanding the shame of this detection, Cagliostro still retained numerous advocates and partisans, by circulating eccentric notions, and conceal∣ing his real character by a variety of tricks.</P>
<P>The inspired FATHER GASSNER, of Bava∣ria, ascribed all diseases, lameness, palsy, &amp;c. to diabolical agency, contending from the history of Job, Saul, &amp;c. recorded in Sacred Writ, that Satan, as the grand enemy of man∣kind, has a power to embitter and shorten our lives by diseases. Vast numbers of cred∣ulous people flocked to this fanatic, for, the purpose of obtaining relief. Whole cargoes
<PB N="124" REF="039111_0154_10139F80F5CC6278"/>
of patients, afflicted with nervous and hypo∣chondriac complaints, besieged him as it were in his quarters every day; all stimulated and heated with a wild imagination, all eager to view and to acknowledge the works of Sa∣tan! Men of literary character, even the Natural Philosophers of Bavaria, were hurri∣ed away by the stream, and completely blind∣ed by this sanctimonious Impostor.</P>
<P>It is no less astonishing than true, that in the year 1794, a COUNT THUN, at Leipzig, pretended to perform miraculous cures on gouty, hypochondriac, and hysterical patients, merely by the imposition of his sacred hands. He could not, however, raise many disciples in a place, that abounds with Sceptics and Unbelievers.</P>
<P>It would be trespassing too much on the limits I have proposed to myself, were I to enumerate the various remedies advertised in the daily papers, both British and foreign, under the fictitious and fraudulent pretence of prolonging life. I shall therefore only re∣mark, in general, that all these celebrated specifics are obviously composed upon wrong principles; inasmuch as their inventors pro∣ceed on the hypothetical idea, that <HI>disease is the only cause of shortening life;</HI> and, being thus mistaken, it is no wonder that they carry the <HI>strengthening</HI> or <HI>bracing</HI> system to an extrav∣agant degree.</P>
<P>The highest point of bodily vigour and health may of itself contribute to shorten life; although no external causes should ap∣pear as co-operating to hasten the consump∣tive
<PB N="125" REF="039111_0155_10139FBFF0E23C88"/>
process. Nay, the very remedies we use, and the regimen we attend to, for the pre∣vention or cure of diseases, may be of such a nature as to promote that consumption.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Absurdity of Specific Remedies.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the doctrines now laid before the reader, I hope I shall not be thought unrea∣sonable, in drawing this conclusion:—That the plans for prolonging human life are gen∣erally erroneous and injudicious; that all <HI>ar∣tificial</HI> means have rather a tendency to short∣en than to prolong it; and that we can nev∣er safely expect the accomplishment of this great object, unless we pursue methods more consonant to nature, more verified by ex∣perience.</P>
<P>The truth of this inference will be more evident, when we come to inquire into the <HI>conditions,</HI> which are essentially requisite to the attainment of a long life.</P>
<P>The <HI>first</HI> of these is a certain bodily and mental disposition to longevity, not easily de∣fined, yet sufficiently known and understood. In whatever this disposition may consist, it is a matter of astonishment, and inexplicable by the laws of animal economy, that many indi∣viduals, frequently under the most unfavoura∣ble circumstances, and in the most unwhole∣some climates, have attained to a great and hap∣py age. It may indeed be confidently affirmed, that, without this principal requisite, all other
<PB N="126" REF="039111_0156_10139F82B1A14E98"/>
advantages are often of no avail; the most salubrious country air, a district abounding with aged inhabitants, a rigid adherence to the diet of Cornaro, a regular course of exer∣cise and recreations, with the best art of the physician, are not alone sufficient to insure the felicitous prospect of a long and healthy life.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If these rational means be unavailing to insure longevity, still more so are those miraculous remedies introduced by superstition. The ancients conceived the idea of a <HI>principle of life,</HI> which they com∣pared to a radical fluid;—the Alchemists expected to find this <HI>orig∣inal entity</HI> in <HI>gold,</HI> by the use of which they pretended that the hu∣man body might acquire the solidity and durability of that metal. Others traced the germ of life in bodies of considerable duration; in plants and animals; in the wood of the Cedar, and in the flesh of the Stag. BOERHAAVE has made a facetious remark upon the subject: "This notion," says he, "is just as ridiculous as that of the man, who, in order to prepare himself for the business of a running footman, is said to have lived for some time entirely on the flesh of hares; hoping thus to surpass all his fellows in agility."</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Secondly:</HI> It is certain that there is, in most cases, a sort of hereditary disposition to lon∣gevity; an innate principle or quality, which, like many family diseases, is propagated from one generation to another. Perhaps nine out of ten old persons could make it appear, that their parents and ancestors also lived to a great age; a reason which may be admitted without having recourse to any material sub∣stance, as the cause or effect of this inherent virtue.</P>
<P>The <HI>third</HI> requisite to longevity is a <HI>perfect birth</HI> of the child, and a proper subsequent conduct in the mother; upon which subject it is not my intention to expatiate in this place. That acute physiologist, Lord Bacon, somewhere remarks, "that children partake more of the nature of the mother, the longer
<PB N="127" REF="039111_0157_10139FC176ACCBB0"/>
time she has nursed them; and that those children which most resemble the mother, will be generally found to have a claim to longevity."</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly:</HI> A gradual, and not too precipi∣tate culture of the physical and mental facul∣ties may be properly considered as an excel∣lent preliminary step towards prolonging life. The age of man bears a certain proportion to the growth of his various powers; and the longer we can protract the different stages of life, the more extended will be the whole compass of our existence. As it is evidently the design of nature, that man should live longer than most of the lower animals, he of course requires a greater space of time, to de∣velope the faculties both of mind and body. Animals, which arrive soon at the perfection of their nature and form, live but a short time. Man requires upwards of twenty, and accord∣ing to some, twenty-five years, before he at∣tains to full maturity; and if it be a rule of nature, that animals in general live eight times the number of years, which is requisite to the attainment of their perfect growth, a strong presumption arises, that the age of man might be extended to nearly two hundred years. In the works of the illustrious Bacon, and parti∣cularly in his "Historical View of Life and Death," are given many strong arguments to confirm this assertion. Surprising as it may appear to some, there is a possibility at least, if not a probability, that the term of human life might be still further extended, if man∣kind could by any means be persuaded to re∣turn
<PB N="128" REF="039111_0158_10139F876D3F2CF8"/>
to that primeval state of nature, from which history and tradition have furnished us with such astonishing and almost incredible instances of longevity. It is not my inten∣tion here to inquire into the degree of credit, which may be due to the accounts of some ex∣traordinary facts of individual longevity, re∣corded by the sacred historian; as the learn∣ed vary much in their opinion, relative to the mode of computation, and whether the Solar, the Arabic, or the Lunar year, or a still short∣er measure of time, is alluded to. This, at least, seems to be generally admitted, that the antediluvians enjoyed an enviable, uninter∣rupted state of health; that their vegetable aliment, and general mode of living, were ex∣tremely simple and no wise prejudicial; that the constitution and temperature of the globe itself must have been greatly affected and de∣teriorated, in consequence of the Flood, or other causes of which we are ignorant; and, lastly, that those impetuous and inordinate appetites and passions, which, like flames, may now be said to consume the powers of life, were then either less violent, or exerted their baneful influence at a much later period of life.</P>
<P>Nature resents every outrage committed on her treasures, and seldom fails to punish the transgressors with lingering disease, or early dissolution. This observation may be applied to the moral as well as the physical faculties of man. It is commonly said, and not with∣out some degree of truth, that very forward
<PB N="129" REF="039111_0159_10139FC51CA5EC60"/>
children seldom live to any age; and that too early an exertion of mental powers is in most cases destructive. The same remark holds good in what relates to the body. The inhabitants of hot climates, who frequently marry at the age of ten and twelve, or twelve and fourteen, begin to be old at thirty, and rarely survive the sixtieth year. Every thing which hastens the evolution of the natural powers, every exertion of strength, dispropor∣tionate to the ability of the individual, should be carefully avoided, as of a dangerous ten∣dency. Hence the great art of education, the great art of living, consists in following the path of nature.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly;</HI> We should constantly inure our∣selves to the habits of supporting and resisting the various impressions of external agency.—Some persons who have paid a very rigid at∣tention to diet, have notwithstanding been unable to reach even a middling age; while others, who have been addicted to the most irregular and extravagant courses, have been observed to live to one very advanced. Hence arise contradictory maxims in dietetics, which can only be reconciled by deciding chemically between the two extremes, and ascertaining pretty nearly the absolute and relative salu∣brity of things. All deviations from the rules of diet are in a certain degree hurtful; al∣though these may, in most cases, have only a limited value. Many epicures have been known to reach their seventieth and eightieth year, if they have once survived a certain
<PB N="130" REF="039111_0160_10139F8A07AA3C08"/>
critical period of their lives.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Experience shows, that there is a particular term of life which, if we can pass in the fullness of health and vigour, leaves the greatest probability of living to a considerable age. In the female sex, this period generally arrives at, or before, the fiftieth year; in the male, it is about the sixtieth year. GELLIUS, a medical author of credit, asserts, from observations founded on long experience, that the sixty∣third year is, to most constitutions, a critical and dangerous one.—The Egyptians called this epocha <HI>Androclos,</HI> because man begins from that time to experience a rapid decay of strength and energy. Others, rather more superstitiously, maintained that, about this period, many individuals die, or at least are subject to severe attacks of disease.—The Emperor AUGUSTUS received the congratulations of his friends, on having survived this trying period.</NOTE> As soon as the body becomes accustomed to the use of certain things, at first disagreeable and perhaps hurt∣ful, the noxious tendency will not only be re∣moved, but we shall find our frame hardened and strengthened by the habit of using them. Nature must stand many a shock, if she would familiarize herself to the vicissitudes of climate and opposite modes of life, but every victory she gains in these encounters, will be a means of rendering her more vigorous and uncon∣querable. How could the sublime mind of FREDERIC THE GREAT have remained so long in its earthly vehicle, if he had not improved, by constant culture and discipline, his original disposition to a long life? A thousand other men, who have endured as much exercise of body and exertion of mind in their younger years, have yet not attained to any remarka∣ble age.—Severe and obstinate diseases have also been thought, in many instances, to con∣tribute to the prolongation of life: this is at best, however, but a doubtful point; although it cannot be denied, that many sick persons have, to all appearance, acquired additional
<PB N="131" REF="039111_0161_10139FC8B5813C30"/>
strength and spirits, after having recovered from a distressing quartan ague, or some threatening pulmonary disorder.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly:</HI> We may take notice of a certain <HI>steady and equal progress through life,</HI> as highly conducive to the great object in view, wheth∣er it flows in the manner of a gentle stream, or resembles the more active course of a rap∣id river. The mind, when accustomed to certain situations and pursuits, which almost constantly affect it in an uniform manner, is most likely to preserve its reasoning powers unimpaired and strong. He whom neither violent joy convulses, nor deep melancholy corrodes, whose drama of life is not chequer∣ed by too sudden vicissitudes, may, with some probability, expect a long enjoyment of that life, to which he has become so habituated. There are many whose days quietly glide away, like those of a simple rustic, in contin∣ual sameness: such persons, it is observed, generally live to a great age.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly:</HI> A very necessary cause of the at∣tainment of an advanced age, is a sound state of digestion. In very old persons, we gen∣erally find the digestive organs in excellent condition; nor is there a surer symptom of approaching dissolution, than complaints in the stomach, or frequent returns of indiges∣tion. The Swiss are indebted, it is thought, to the vigorous tone of their digestive pow∣ers, for the long preservation of their lives, in general, and for the great number of aged persons among them. Milk and vegetable food seem remarkably well adapted to invig∣orate
<PB N="132" REF="039111_0162_10139F8B8D7F8160"/>
the stomach. To effect the same pur∣pose, Lord Bacon advises old people to have recourse to strengthening baths, fomentations, and similar <HI>external</HI> remedies, which operate upon the absorbent system. At the same time, a thin but nourishing and moderate di∣et should be observed, in order to spare the organs of digestion.</P>
<P><HI>Eighthly,</HI> and lastly: We may recommend equanimity, or that state of the mind, when, from the happy nature of its pursuits, it is not disquieted by too violent exertions. In the literary professions, and particularly among such individuals as are placed in easy circum∣stances, we discover as many instances of lon∣gevity, as in the more laborious occupations. It was remarked by the Ancients, that gram∣marians and rhetoricians commonly attained a great age. The mind being engaged in sci∣entific pursuits, and other objects in which it finds pleasure, such as conversation on literary and mixed topics, collecting the productions of nature, a continual series of mental research, diversifying the pursuits or amusements, yet gradually and constantly persevering in exer∣tions towards the attainment of some princi∣pal object—all supply the vital power, as it were, with materials, like the cruse of oil, which proved a never-failing support to the widow of <HI>Sarepta.</HI> On the other hand, it is a general remark, that deep thinkers, specu∣lative philosophers, and those whose powers are continually absorbed in abstruse inquiry, soon feel the effects of age, from the great ex∣ertions of their mental powers. This must
<PB N="133" REF="039111_0163_10139FCA40438910"/>
be understood, however, with exceptions, as in the cases of SIR ISAAC NEWTON, HALLER, EULER, and the pride of his nation and age, the profound and venerable KANT, still living at Koenigsberg.</P>
<P>I venture to say thus much on the various rules and precautions requisite to attain a long and healthful life. Some of the particulars are, no doubt, found united in a certain pro∣portion of the individuals, who arrive at a re∣spectable age. It is commonly remarked al∣so, that the inhabitants of mountainous coun∣tries, for the most part live to a greater age than those of plain and, particularly, marshy districts. This is in part true; yet we are not to consider the lofty regions in the Alps and Pyrenees as possessing these salubrious qualities; for it is only upon moderate heights, and in hilly rather than mountainous coun∣tries, that we so frequently meet with people of an unusual age. Persons who are con∣stantly travelling, are likewise said to enjoy a long and healthful life; and Lord Bacon fur∣ther includes, in the list of long livers, such as are of a melancholy temperament. It is a questionable point, whether the great age of many Turks is to be ascribed to the serenity of their climate, their daily use of the bath, or their uncommon temperance in eating and drinking. For, as to their copious use of opium, which is considered by them almost as necessary as food, we have already shown the noxious tendency of such practice; opium generating, in a remarkable degree, a disposi∣tion of the fluids, in many respects resembling
<PB N="134" REF="039111_0164_10136E2A7369BA58"/>
that of hypochondriasis. There is scarcely an instance of any person, that has attained to uncommon longevity, who has not been par∣ticular in his diet and manner of living. But in this respect we cannot hope to derive ad∣vantage from excessive solicitude:—for, as when in want of sleep, the more we think of it, the more it shuns us; so those who are most anxious for longevity, are the least likely to attain it. Age is a gift, which Heaven frequently bestows upon mortals, when they are asleep, or in other words, when they are scarcely sensible of it!</P>

<HEAD>On the Symptoms of actual Dissolution.</HEAD>
<P>THAT many unfortunate individuals are consigned to the grave, before they are actu∣ally dead, is a truth too well attested to re∣quire demonstration. If this were not, or never had been the case, it could not have ex∣cited that degree of attention on the Conti∣nent, and particularly in Germany, which of late years has been bestowed on this impor∣tant subject. The most respectable Physicians have proved by incontrovertible facts, that sick persons have often been hastily buried, or to speak more properly, smothered in their coffins, either from accidental mistake, or from the most detestable motives. But, as many false and scandalous reports are generally cir∣culated, in addition to those founded on truth, we need not wonder, that this business has
<PB N="135" REF="039111_0165_10139FCCC7809010"/>
not been conducted, hitherto, with that de∣gree of calm and patient attention, to which it is justly entitled. Houses for the reception of persons apparently dead have been, at length, erected in various parts of Germany, in Berlin, Jena, Coburg, &amp;c. This idea, at the first view of it, may to some appear whim∣sical; but those who know the extent of the power of vitality, and the almost infinite modifications of which that power is suscepti∣ble, will not ridicule a proposal, which origi∣nated in motives of prudence and humanity. Into these houses every inhabitant of the town, or district, has a right to send the body of a deceased person, on paying a trifling sum per night, towards the expenses of the insti∣tution. Here the body i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> deposited on a couch, lightly covered, and provided with a string fastened to the hand, which pulls a bell on the top of the house. A watchman is ap∣pointed to receive and register the bodies brought into the house, and to give the alarm, if necessary. This, to say the least of it, is no small convenience to families in a large city, crowded into narrow apartments, with a number of children, who must necessarily suf∣fer from the pestiferous exhalations of dead bodies. But this is not the principal advan∣tage attending such establishments: it is un∣questionably a great satisfaction to the rela∣tives of the deceased, to be assured that every means have been used to preserve from the most dreadful of all deaths, a friend whose memory they revere.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="039111_0166_10139F8E1CFFA138"/>
The cases, in which death can be clearly as∣certained, are nearly the following:</P>
<P N="1">1. When putrefaction has actually taken place over the whole animal frame; as in∣stances are common, in which a partial mor∣tification of an arm or a leg is by no means mortal.</P>
<P N="2">2. In the nervous apoplexy of the aged; as such persons generally die in consequence of slowly wasting disorders, various species of palsy, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3. If the patient expires after a long stand∣ing consumption, hectic fever, or ulcerations of the breast and lungs, diseases now very common.</P>
<P N="4">4. If any of the larger blood-vessels, or other parts essential to life, have received ex∣ternal injury, by violent blows, bruises, or cuts, attended with great loss of blood, which could not be stopped by artificial means. If we are unable to supply the loss of this vital fluid, and to restore the organization of the parts thus destroyed; particularly if the brain, the lungs, the heart, the stomach, or any of the intestines, have suffered from a severe wound, a speedy dissolution may be considered as inevitable.</P>
<P N="5">5. After chronic disorders of the intes∣tines, obstructions of the abdominal vessels, and dropsy thence arising—or if an incurable weakness in the breast has occasioned the or∣ganic destruction, or ossification of the pecto∣ral vessels, there is little prospect of the re∣covery of such a person; as these complaints of asthmatic sufferers, in general, are not in a

just proportion to the whole state of the body; for instance, if their appetite and digestion have been unimpaired previous to their dis∣ease, or if their muscular strength has not suf∣fered from the like affections.</P>
<P N="6">6. In persons of tender and debilitated nerves, who have been long subject to spasms or epileptic fits, particularly if they die in child-bed, in consequence of violent hemorr∣hages, or after repeated and oppressive agita∣tions of mind;—in such cases there is no hope left, as it is too late to think of changing or improving the constitution of the nervous system.

In these in∣stances it is not in the power of the medical art to restore the shrivelled vessels to their proper tension and energy; consequently all our ef∣forts to reanimate the body will be unavail∣ing.</P>
<P>There remains now to be stated also, in what cases and situations the symptoms of apparent death are less certain, so that some hope of recovery is still left to the disconso∣late friend and relative. These are principally the following: after faintings, sudden loss of blood from diseased intestines,—in certain cases of repelled morbid matter, for instance, in the small-pox, measles, poisons, and the like, which frequently produce a spurious kind of apoplexy;—after hysteric and hypo∣chondriac spasms and colics of a transitory kind, which have not too often recurred; af∣ter
<PB N="138" REF="039111_0168_10139F90CC5355A0"/>
mental anxiety, perturbation, terror, and other oppressive passions, where every thing depends on a speedy removal of the causes. To this list we may likewise add the cases of drowned, hanged, and otherwise suffocated persons, or those who appear to be dead, in consequence of a fall from high scaffoldings, without any external injury. In such acci∣dents, an internal pressure or stoppage of the vital functions, as breathing, and circulation of the blood, often produces a state of appar∣ent death.—Even the suppressed pulse in the arteries, imperceptible respiration, the cold∣ness and rigidity of the limbs, the want of contractibility in the pupil of the eye, the in∣voluntary loss of excrementitious substances,—all these symptoms of approaching dissolution should not discourage us from trying the prop∣er means of recovering the patient's life. In children and young persons, in particular, we must not too hastily decide, whether they be absolutely dead or not;—<HI>teething</HI> is frequently attended with diversified convulsive symp∣toms, and the <HI>tape-worm</HI> is capable of produc∣ing the most alarming effects, which the in∣experienced by-standers may unwarily ascribe to very different causes. Hence every possi∣ble degree of precaution is requisite in man∣aging the bodies of infants apparently dead, and above all things not to remove them from the warm temperature of the sick-room, before the last lingering spark of life is extin∣guished. Indeed, it must strike even super∣ficial observers, that the hasty removal of a body from a warm to a colder temperature
<PB N="139" REF="039111_0169_10139FD433EF5960"/>
is highly improper and dangerous. And here the excellent rules, published by the Royal Humane Society of London, for the recovery of persons apparently dead, cannot be recommended in too strong terms; al∣though some of the more violent methods detailed in their plan, such as inflation of the bowels with the <HI>fumes</HI> of <HI>tobacco, clysters</HI> pre∣pared of this herb, violent <HI>agitation,</HI> and too <HI>early</HI> and <HI>indiscriminate</HI> application of the <HI>elec∣tric shock,</HI> might well bear a few modifications and improvements.</P>

<HEAD>Summary of Dietetics.</HEAD>
<P>THE knowlede of those objects which re∣late to the preservation of the human body, in its natural state, may be called the <HI>Doctrine of Health.</HI> Life and Health are, therefore, the proper objects of this doctrine; as the second department of Medicine solely relates to the preternatural states of man, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Disease and Death, and forms that branch of professional study, which we call '<HI>Pathology.</HI>'</P>
<P>The compass of the former science, or an investigation of the objects included in the doctrine of health, must be very extensive. It furn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>es us with rules and cautions as to every thing we ought to do, or to avoid, in order to remain healthy. This useful science is properly denominated DIETETICS, or a <HI>sys∣tematic view of all objects relative to health in gen∣eral, and to food and drink in particular.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="039111_0170_10139F94679E1318"/>
The following Chapters will, therefore, be exclusively devoted to Dietetics. My princi∣pal object will be, to lay a solid foundation for that important science, by investigating and combating the chief prejudices, which have hitherto retarded the progress of this branch of knowledge. Hence, a <HI>System of Di∣etetics</HI> must not only contain all those rules, which are requisite to guide us in the preser∣vation of health, together with such as relate to the choice of a proper mode of life, but should likewise inform us with regard to the beneficial or hurtful influence, which <HI>external objects</HI> produce on the health and life of man, and teach us the just application, or practical use, of these objects.</P>
<P>DIETETICS include the whole of what the Ancients understood by the singular name of the SIX NON-NATURALS; namely, <HI>Air, Ali∣ment, Exercise and Rest, the Passions and Affec∣tions of the Mind, Wakefulness and Sleep,</HI> and <HI>Repletion and Evacuation.</HI> Although these gen∣eral heads do not comprise, strictly speaking, every thing that relates to the different func∣tions of the human body; yet they contain all such conditions of life, as are absolutely necessary, and the greatest part of those cir∣cumstances, which are connected with the health and well-being of the individual. In each of these particulars we are liable to com∣mit errors, either by intemperate use, or an improper application. I propose, therefore, to lay down a System of Rules, by which we may be assisted to choose, according to par∣ticular circumstances, the best and most ra∣tional
<PB N="141" REF="039111_0171_10139FD5B91432A8"/>
means of insuring heath, and of avoid∣ing whatever may have a contrary tendency.</P>
<P>Our mode of life is no longer that natural and simple one, which prevailed in the prim∣itive ages of mankind; in the present state of society such habits are scarcely conceivable. Man in a state of nature had little occasion to attend to his health; he wanted no rules for the preservation of it; for, as the seeds of dis∣eases are rarely scattered in such a state, instinct would be to him in most cases a sufficient guide. It now seems to be impossible to re∣turn to that primeval state, without return∣ing, at the same time, from our present de∣gree of mental improvement to that of pris∣tine barbarity. We have, to all appearance, purchased our improved state of mental cul∣ture, by sacrificing to it a considerable share of our bodily welfare;—happy, however, we may still consider ourselves, if we have actu∣ally gained in moral and intellectual improve∣ment.</P>
<P>Innumerable are the causes, which have con∣spired to render the <HI>true</HI> knowledge of the means conducive to health, difficult in the acquisition, and uncertain in its application. The chief of these are probably the following, which include most of the subordinate partic∣ulars:—the present very artificial method of living; the prodigious number of the em∣ployments of mankind; the different modes of dwelling and dressing; the endless variety of articles used as food and drink; the great diversity of national customs and manners; and the difference of climate and situation;—
<PB N="142" REF="039111_0172_10139F95EE4663C8"/>
all these circumstances have greater or less in∣fluence, conjointly or separately, not only on the passions, inclinations, and instinctive desires of individuals, but also on the general state of the health and physical welfare of a people. By the present mode of living we are exposed to diseases wholly unknown in the first ages of the world, and we suffer from a variety of complaints, originating either in artificial hab∣its, or the constraint under which we labour, in consequence of blindly complying with the caprices of custom, or fashion, without perhaps apprehending any ill consequences from such pernicious practices.</P>
<P>Many ingenious writers have lately endeav∣oured to point out the disadvantages arising from causes apparently trivial. Thus the fash∣ion of using paint, hair-powder, and pomatum; of wearing ill-shaped shoes, laced stays, &amp;c. have deservedly incurred severe ridicule and pointed censure. The custom of applying lead to earthen vessels has not escaped their attention: the danger, however, resulting from the use of that substance, has been great∣ly exaggerated. Writers, with the best in∣tentions, have sometimes, from an excess of zeal, descanted on the worst side of the ques∣tion only, by attributing to certain things many dangerous qualities, which in fact are owing to a great diversity of circumstances.</P>
<P>This partial method of inquiring into the sources of the evil, is, generally speaking, a serious error; as it not only leads to false conclusions, but also draws our attention from other pressing injuries, to which, in a more
<PB N="143" REF="039111_0173_10139FD743AA56D8"/>
dispassionate state of mind, our care might be directed.</P>
<P>Many, and perhaps the greater number, of dietetic writers have fallen into another er∣ror of an equally bad tendency. They judge of every thing, according to the agreeable or disagreeable effect it produces on their own palates and constitutions, and hence recom∣mend their favourite articles to others; al∣though what is salutary in particular cases, may have a pernicious tendency, if prescribed indiscriminately.</P>
<P>The multiplicity of our-wants, all deserving attention in a Dietetic System, has also con∣siderably multiplied the rules of health. Of all living beings, indeed, none require such rules more than those, who servilely submit to the arbitrary mandates of luxury and fashion.</P>
<P>Many are the open and secret enemies to the health and prosperity of man. Even the most healthy, and those who rigidly adhere to the rules of Diet and Regimen, cannot al∣together evade their attacks. Hence we should make it our study, to acquaint our∣selves minutely with every thing, so as to be enabled to judge of its good or bad qualities. Whatever we are obliged to have more im∣mediately about and around us, ranks in this class: the arrangement of our dwelling places, beds, clothes, furniture, &amp;c. in the choice of which we are less accustomed to consult what nature requires, or to contrive what may be most likely to promote the welfare of the body, than to follow fashion, vanity, or our own habits.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="039111_0174_10139F988D6F8788"/>
Some of our organs of sense, and other fa∣culties of the body, must unavoidably suffer from inattention to a proper mode of living in general. From the great exertions, to which we often subject them (the eyes, for instance, in reading) they are liable to a vari∣ety of accidents, and frequently become de∣bilitated and impaired. It appears, therefore, perfectly consistent with the plan of this work, to treat of the management of the eyes, teeth, and other individual parts of the body.</P>
<P>In a complete System of Rules for preserv∣ing the health of man, attention must be paid to the separate wants of individual constitu∣tions; provided they be not too minute and trivial. Such a system must contain more than what relates to the first and most sim∣ple rules of living;—its precepts must not ap∣ply to the healthy alone, or those whose life is regulated by the simplicity of nature,—it should also lay down instructions, how, in all contingent circumstances, we may be secured from danger and bodily injuries. It is not, however, proposed to treat of diseases after they have taken place, if the removal of them requires any thing more than a strict adher∣ence to temperance, and the other rules laid down in these Lectures.—But to prevent any misapplication of those rules which are estab∣lished by the accumulated observations of ages, it may not be improper to introduce here some previous <HI>general remarks,</HI> relative to the individual use and advantage to be derived from a connected view of <HI>Dietetics.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="039111_0175_10139FD8C79ED610"/>
It may be laid down as a preliminary ob∣servation, that the rules contained in this work are not to be considered as strictly ap∣plicable, in every instance, to the particular situation of any individual, or as essentially necessary to the preservation of his health.—It is not so much the healthy, as the valetu∣dinary and infirm, who stand in need of mi∣nute precepts for their conduct; and even the latter ought not to engage too solicitous∣ly in their compliance with them; since it is only a very limited number that require such accurate attention.</P>
<P>A vigorous and persevering method of in∣uring ourselves to the unavoidable difficulties and diversified accidents of life, is of greater importance to the preservation of health, than any dietetical rules whatever. Man is capa∣ble of undergoing all the vicissitudes and in∣conveniences of air, weather, and climate; he can digest any articles of food, if his stom∣ach has not been wantonly indulged; he can sustain the severest bodily exercise and labour, without paying too minute attention to time or regularity, when his employment or duty renders exertion necessary. But he who from his infancy has been treated with extreme tenderness, or who, after having been previ∣ously accustomed to a hardy mode of life, is seized with the whim of bestowing too much care on his health, will suffer from the most trivial hardships, and catch cold at every change of the air; every heavy or high-seas∣oned dish will be oppressive, and the smallest deviation from the rules of temperance indis∣pose
<PB N="146" REF="039111_0176_10139F9C31E986E0"/>
him. Yet, by the same rules, every healthy person will learn, that the grand se∣cret for preserving himself in that state, con∣sists principally in the art of moderating his desires and enjoyments. We may thus ar∣rive at the knowledge of such things, as are <HI>generally</HI> conducive to the welfare of the body; and more than this ought not to be expected. Rules of health, <HI>universally</HI> applicable to the state of every individual, are not discoverable in nature; nor can they be derived from any experimental knowledge we possess of corpo∣real objects.—The best general precept is, that every one study himself, and his own partic∣ular constitution; that he choose and regu∣late his mode of life accordingly; and that he make his own experience his guide in what∣ever he finds most suitable and convenient.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of AIR and WEATHER; their influence on the Human Body; the means of improving the former, and diminishing the pernicious effects of the latter.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Air in general.</HEAD>
<P>AS soon as an infant enters into the world, the air of the atmosphere penetrates into his lungs, filled up till then with aqueous mucus, and renders them fit for the circula∣tion of the blood, which immediately com∣mences. From that moment the alternate ex∣tension and contraction of the breast and lungs, the inspiration and expiration of the air, or in other words, the function of <HI>respi∣ration,</HI> becomes indispensably necessary to the preservation of animal life. While the child remained within its mother, it required no external air. As soon, however, as it has drawn breath, as soon as the lungs are open∣ed, the act of respiration begins, is constantly renewed through life, and can never absolute∣ly cease, but with death. As, therefore, air is the principal medium by which animal life is supported, it becomes highly import∣ant to acquire correct ideas of this refined substance, that pervades all the parts of ani∣mate and inanimate matter, and is so essen∣tial to man, for the preservation of both his life and health.</P>
<P><HI>Air</HI> is that colourless, transparent, compres∣sible, heavy, and elastic fluid, which every
<PB N="148" REF="039111_0178_10139F9ECD071158"/>
where surrounds our globe, and which gen∣erally receives the name of <HI>Atmosphere.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>"Our bodies are equally pressed upon by the incumbent at∣mosphere, and the weight they sustain is equal to a cylinder of the <HI>air,</HI> whose base is equal to the superficies of our bodies.—Every foot square of this superficies sustains a quantity of <HI>air</HI> equal to 2660lb.; so that if the superficies of a man's body was to contain 15 square feet, which is pretty near the truth, he would sustain a weight equal to 39,900lb. The difference of the weight of the air, which our bodies sustain at one time more than at another, is also very great; that between the greatest and the least pressure of air upon our bod∣ies has been proved to be equal to 3902lb. Hence it is so far from being a wonder, that we sometimes suffer in our health by a change of weather, that it is the greatest miracle we do not always do so. For when we consider, that our bodies are sometimes pressed upon by near a ton and a half weight more than at another, and that this variation is often very sudden, it is surprising that every such change should not entirely break the frame of our bodies to pieces. And the vessels of our bodies, being so much strained by an increased pressure, would stagnate the blood up to the very heart, and the circulation would quite cease, if Nature had not wisely contrived, that when the resistance to the circulating blood is greatest, the <HI>impetus,</HI> by which the heart contracts, should be so too. For upon increase of the weight of the air, the lungs will be more forcibly ex∣panded, and thereby the blood more intimately broken and divided; so that it becomes fitter for the more fluid secretions, such as that of the (supposed) nervous fluid, by which the heart will be more strongly contracted, and the blood's motion towards the surface of the body being obstructed, it will pass in greater quantity to the brain, where the pressure of the air is taken off by the <HI>cranium,</HI> up∣on which account also more spirits will be separated, and thus the heart too more enabled to carry on the circulation through all pass∣able canals, while some others towards the surface are obstructed."</P>

It contains <HI>water</HI> in a state of solu∣tion; by means of water it combines with salts; in many places we find it impregnated with <HI>sulphur,</HI> with putrid exhalations, and the like; nay, frequently we even meet with earthy particles floating in this element.—When all foreign ingredients are separated from it, the subtle aërial body still remains of
<PB N="149" REF="039111_0179_10139FE01DE22D50"/>
a compound nature, and is by no means a simple elementary substance, as was formerly believed.</P>
<P>According to the late discoveries in chemis∣try, the aërial basis of the atmosphere consists of <HI>three</HI> different species of air, namely, of pure, respirable, or dephlogisticated air; of azotic, or phlogisticated air; and of fixed, aërial, or carbonic acid air.—The proportion of the first, namely, pure or vital air, consists, accord∣ing to the French Chemists, who have given it the name of <HI>Oxygen,</HI> of 27 or 28 in the hundred parts; the second, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the <HI>Azote</HI> of the French, of 72 or 73 in the hundred; and the third, namely, the <HI>Carbonic acid air,</HI> of about one part only in the hundred.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The accurate experiments made by the late SCHEELE and BERG∣MAN, in Sweden, do not much differ from those of the French Chem∣ists, with respect to these proportions. For, according to Scheele and Bergman, the common proportion of vital air, or oxygen, in the atmosphere, is about one fourth; that of azote about five eighths; and that of carbonic acid nearly one sixteenth; the last of which, by the French, is computed only at one hundredth part, that is, five parts in the hundred less than the Swedish philosophers maintain.</P>
<P>The following is a concise history of <HI>Oxygen:</HI>—In August, 1774, Dr. PRIESTLEY, and much about the same time Mr. SCHEELE, in Sweden, discovered this respirable part of atmospheric air, or rather they exhibited it, for the first time, in a pure state. This elastic sub∣stance was first called <HI>dephlogisticated air,</HI> agreeably to the hypothesis of <HI>phlogiston;</HI>—afterwards it went under different names, as pure air, fire-air, vital air, until the late hypothesis of <HI>Oxygen,</HI> or the acidify∣ing principle, has procured it the name of <HI>oxygen gas.</HI>—But still more diversified than these names, are the theories which have been proposed on the nature and properties of this species of air, during the last twenty years. With <HI>Priestley,</HI> it is the purest air freed of all phlogiston; with <HI>Scheele,</HI> it is the nitrous acid deprived of its wa∣ter; according to <HI>Bergman,</HI> it is one of the unknown constituents of nitrous acid; with <HI>Fontana,</HI> it is the dephlogisticated nitrous acid; <HI>Forster</HI> considers it as air united with fire; Mr. <HI>Watt,</HI> of Birming∣ham, thinks to find in it elementary fire combined with hydrogen or inflammable gas; <HI>Achard</HI> and <HI>Gren</HI> formerly believed it to be water combined with much Caloric, or the principle of heat; but <HI>Gren</HI> latterly maintained, in his System of Chemistry, that it is the un∣known basis of vital air combined with Caloric;—if we believe <HI>Westrumb,</HI> it is elementary air in a state of combination with Caloric, but the basis of the former cannot be discovered; according to <HI>Fourcroy,</HI> it is an unknown elementary matter united with inflam∣mable air; in the opinion of <HI>Lavoisier,</HI> it contains the acidifying principle, OXYGEN, and the principle of Heat, CALORIC; Mr. <HI>Cav∣endish</HI> maintains that it is dephlogisticated water; and according to <HI>De la Metherie,</HI> it is an unknown substance combined with water and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire; &amp;c. &amp;c.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="039111_0180_10139FA16A7746E0"/>
<HI>Oxygen</HI> is much better adapted to the respi∣ration of animals, than common atmospheric air. If two animals be inclosed in vessels, one of which contains pure oxygen, and the other common atmospheric air, in proportions equal to the size of the animals, the former in the oxygen will be found to live from six to sev∣en times longer, than the latter in common air. It is properly this oxygen which we in∣spire, and which is the grand support of an∣imal life. Persons apparently dead, or in a state of suffocation, have been instantly re∣stored to life by its influence, and from the corresponding testimony of several respectable physicians, it appears to have been employed with advantage in many obstinate diseases.—The celebrated INGENHOUZ therefore gave it the name of <HI>vital air.</HI> It promotes com∣bustion in a very high degree. A candle will burn in it from six to seven times longer than in common air, with a much greater degree of heat, and a more brilliant flame. Bodies in a glowing state, are immediately inflamed, when put into oxygen gas; and even metals, which are not very fusible, are melted in it, and converted into oxyds, or calces, with the greatest facility.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="039111_0181_10139FE1D6EFB828"/>
<HI>Azote,</HI> by others called phlogisticated, me∣phitic, corrupted, or suffocative air, is abso∣lutely irrespirable, and not miscible with wa∣ter. It arises from the change which atmos∣pherical air undergoes in every process of combustion, putrefaction, and respiration, whether produced by nature or art.</P>
<P>Azote enters into no combination with wa∣ter, but may be rendered less hurtful by shak∣ing it with that fluid: this accounts in some measure for the salubrity of the sea-air. It greatly promotes the growth of plants, and readily accumulates in apartments filled with people, or containing articles fresh-painted with oil-colours, or in which strongly frag∣rant flowers are kept, without having any access of fresh air. We should be extremely cautious in entering such places; as diseases of the breast and lungs are too frequently the consequences of neglect, obstinacy, or igno∣rance.</P>
<P>The <HI>Carbonic acid</HI> of the French is the <HI>fixed air</HI> of Dr. BLACK, and the <HI>Aërial acid</HI> of BERG∣MAN. This species of air is miscible with wa∣ter; but in its pure state equally irrespirable as the Azote. It derives its origin, partly from the vinous fermentation of vegetables, and some animal substances, and partly from the mild alkaline salts and earths combined with acids. Much of this air is found in mines, where it frequently distresses the workmen by its suffocating qualities. It is also observed in most mineral waters, where a stratum of it sometimes swims upon the surface of the well. These waters, as well as fermented liquors
<PB N="152" REF="039111_0182_10139FA3201E9860"/>
which contain a considerable portion of fixed air, receive from it the well known pungency so agreeable to the palate. Hence flat and spoiled beer, or wine, may be corrected and restored to its former briskness, by the addi∣tion of fixed air evolved from chalk and vit∣riolic acid, or by mixing it with new beer or wine in a state of fermentation.</P>
<P>This species of air quickly extinguishes fire, and strongly attracts the fumes arising from candles. As it is unfit for respiration, ani∣mals cannot live in it. The warm-blooded animals die in it much sooner than any other; those of an amphibious kind somewhat later; insects are not irrecoverably killed by it; ir∣ritability is suddenly destroyed, and the heart of an animal so deprived of life, though still warm, no longer exhibits any signs of mo∣tion.</P>
<P>There is another species of mephitic air, which is not miscible with water, which burns with a flame, and if mixed either with atmos∣pheric air, or oxygen gas, instantly catches fire, and is exploded: this has received the name of inflammable air,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This air may be obtained in a great variety of ways, from all substances liable to inflammation, or containing combustible matter, by means of heat, fermentation, acids, and the like; nay, even from metals, by directing the steam of boiling water through a red-hot metallic tube.—It is the spontaneous production of nature; through∣out her <HI>three</HI> kingdoms. In mines, in subterraneous caverns, and particularly in coal-pits, it is known by the name of <HI>choak-damp.</HI> It is copiously generated in the intestines of living animals, and is fre∣quently met with in common sewers, burying grounds, and places where dead animal bodies are exposed to putrefaction.</P>
<P>The white Dittany, (<HI>Dictamnus albus,</HI> LIN.) when in flower, gen∣erates so great a quantity of inflammable air, that the atmosphere around it has been observed to catch fire. In swamps, pools, and other stagnant waters, where a number of plants, particularly sage, calamus, and the like, are putrifying, we find a species of inflam∣mable gas, which is known by the name of <HI>marsh-air,</HI> or more com∣monly, the <HI>ignis fatuus,</HI> or <HI>Will-o' the-Wisp.</HI></P></NOTE> and deserves to be
<PB N="153" REF="039111_0183_10139FE4602FFD80"/>
mentioned here, although it cannot be con∣sidered as a constituent part of the atmosphere.</P>
<P>With respect to the <HI>specific gravity</HI> of the different airs before enumerated, it is in this place only necessary to observe, that the heav∣iest is the fixed air, or carbonic acid gas; next to this comes the azote and oxygen, both of which are heavier than the common air of the atmosphere; and lastly, hydrogen, or in∣flammable gas, which is the lightest of all; for it is even lighter than the purest atmos∣pheric air.</P>
<P>When the atmosphere is too much impreg∣nated with any of the mephitic gases, its in∣fluence on the human body is extremely nox∣ious. Thus we see many of the workmen in lead-mines dying in the prime of life, of an obstinate and incurable colic, which is attend∣ed with the most painful obstructions.—Paint∣ers, glaziers, potters, and manufacturers of glazed carthen ware, are from a similar cause exposed to the same dreadful disease; being obliged to make use of great quantities of lead<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Whether this insidious and deleterious metal be communicated by inhaling its vapours through the lungs, or by absorbing them through the pores of the skin, the effects of it are equally dangerous and fatal. The internal use of sulphur, and both the internal and external use of vegetable oils, or animal fats, are the only antidotes hitherto discovered against this virulent bane of the manufacturer and the artist.</P>
<P>Most trades and occupations are subject to peculiar diseases; in some the materials of the manufacture have a pernicious influence on the body, and in others the nature of the employment is hurtful, either from requiring a sedentary life, a reclined, stooping, or stand∣ing posture, or from being performed in a confined air, or at a great fire, and the like. Hence <HI>millers, hair-dressers,</HI> and <HI>stone-masons,</HI> fre∣quently die of a consumption of the lungs, in consequence of the mi∣nute particles of dust which they are continually obliged to inhale.—Manufacturers of wool, and particularly hatters, are much troubled with obstinate cutaneous diseases; and all those whose business is at∣tended with grease and dust, suffer more or less from the consequen∣ces of uncleanness.</P></NOTE> in different forms.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="039111_0184_10139FA4AAB80130"/>
It is almost unnecessary to mention the fre∣quent and sudden deaths that have taken place from the explosion of inflammable air in mines, or from the opening of pits, deep wells, and other confined places. Neither is any thing so much calculated to corrupt and poison the air, to fill it with noxious vapours, and to generate diseases, as the <HI>burying-grounds</HI> established within the walls of populous cities, where human bodies are deposited, as if with an apparent design to produce an atmosphere, which is particularly fatal to the tender lungs of children, and in no small degree hurtful to adults.</P>
<P>As the mass of atmospheric air is incessantly corrupted by the respiration of men and ani∣mals, by the burning of so many natural and artificial fires, by the dissolution and putrefac∣tion of innumerable substances, and by vari∣ous other phlogistic or desoxygenating pro∣cesses, it would at length become altogether incompetent for its original designation, if Nature had not provided effectual means for its improvement and restoration. Among the most powerful of these, we may place the growth and vegetation of plants.—For this very important discovery we are indebted to Dr. PRIESTLEY, who was so fortunate as to hit upon it, after he had long employed him∣self

in fruitless attempts, to improve and re∣store corrupted air, by artificial means. He found that air, rendered mortal by the breath∣ing of animals which had expired in it, was again so completely restored by the vegetation of plants, that, after the lapse of some days, an animal could live in it with equal ease, and for the same length of time, as in a similar quantity of common atmospheric air.</P>
<P>These experiments, indeed, did not succeed with some Naturalists; and Priestly himself, upon repeating them with different plants, found the results rather varying and doubt∣ful: but Dr. INGENHOUZ removed the great∣er part of these difficulties, by his book, "Ex∣periments upon Vegetables, 8vo. London, 1779." This ingenious philosopher remark∣ed, 1st, That most plants have the property of correcting bad air within a few hours, when they are exposed to the <HI>light of the sun;</HI> but that, on the contrary, <HI>during the night,</HI> or in the <HI>shade,</HI> they corrupt the common air of the atmosphere;—2d, That plants, from their own substance, afford a very pure dephlogis∣ticated air, or Oxygen, when exposed to the rays of the sun; but a very impure air or Azote at night, or in the shade;—3d, That not all the parts of plants, but only the green stalks of leaves, particularly through the sides opposite to the soil, produce this beneficial ef∣fect;—4th, That the disengagement of pure or vital air does not commence until the sun has been some time above the horizon; that it ceases altogether with the termination of day-light; and that the disadvantage arising
<PB N="156" REF="039111_0186_10139FA953537E98"/>
from the impure exhalation of plants, during the night, is far exceeded by the great advan∣tage they afford during the day; insomuch, that the impure air, generated by a plant dur∣ing the whole night, scarcely amounts to a hundredth part of the pure vital air or Oxy∣gen, exhaled from the same plant in two hours of a serene day.—Thus we discover a most striking phenomenon in the oeconomy of na∣ture; since the vegetation of plants continu∣ally counteracts the noxious effects of respira∣tion, combustion, and putrefaction.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It should be recollected here, that when the growth of plants is interrupted by the cold of winter, so that they no longer generate a beneficial air to purify the atmosphere, Nature has ordained it, that this very cold of the winter itself contains the most effectual virtues to stop the progress of putrefaction. We further find, that in the most unwholesome, and particularly in marshy countries, those very plants appear to be very profusely distributed, which most em∣inently possess the property of purifying the air. And as the pure air, or oxygen, is of greater specific gravity than the common air of the atmosphere, it is perfectly consistent with the operations of nature, that the oxygen should settle towards the lower side of the leaves of plants.</P></NOTE> In this manner, the atmosphere is constantly preserv∣ed in that necessary state of purity and tem∣perature, which is the most salutary both to animals and vegetables.</P>
<P>We have learnt the effects produced on the human body by the atmosphere and the changes of the weather, partly from observations made by ourselves and others, and partly from their influence on inanimate matter, by which we can judge in some measure of its analogous effects on the human frame; but we should not thence conclude that our knowledge, in this respect, is either complete or infallible. Ob∣servations may frequently deceive us, since the
<PB N="157" REF="039111_0187_10139EF7081A10F0"/>
human body, besides the weather, is incessant∣ly exposed to the effects of other external agents, which may easily elude our attention. Further, the atmosphere surrounding us, be∣sides the properties cognizable by our senses, or discoverable by the assistance of particular instruments, may also be impregnated with substances which have hitherto escaped our researches, and which nevertheless may have the power to effect important changes. Last∣ly, we ought not to consider the arguments deduced from analogy as strictly conclusive; we should remember, that the effects of ex∣ternal objects on the living animal fibre are, in many instances, totally different from those which they produce on lifeless or inanimate bodies.</P>
<P>Recommending these general remarks to the consideration of the reader, I proceed to consider those particular and positive effects, which the different states of the atmosphere produce on our frame, and in what manner they influence our health.</P>
<P><HI>Warm air</HI> relaxes the solid parts of the body, and occasions a stronger circulation of the flu∣ids. <HI>Heat</HI> is chiefly oppressive to the Nerves; hence the tender and infirm suffer severely in hot weather; hence arise hysteric and hypo∣chondriac complaints, convulsions, and diar∣rhoeas. <HI>Cold</HI> renders bodies more compact, particularly the solid parts of the animal struc∣ture, such as the muscles, nerves, bones, &amp;c. They become more elastic in winter; the ap∣petite for food is stronger, and digestion easier and quicker. On the contrary, the resistance
<PB N="158" REF="039111_0188_10139FAAD84C2378"/>
of the fluid parts becomes so great, that even the increased powers of the solids cannot over-come it, if the cold be too violent. In winter the blood is much disposed to inflammations; hence stitches in the side, inflammatory sore throats, rheumatisms, &amp;c. In persons who take little exercise, the fluids are apt to stag∣nate, and the solids to chill during the win∣ter;—upon the whole, however, the effects of cold weather may be rendered less hurtful, and even salutary to the body, if proper ex∣ercise be not neglected.</P>
<P><HI>Damp</HI> or <HI>moist air</HI> suddenly relaxes and de∣bilitates; it occasions a slowness in the cir∣culation of the fluids, which gives rise to ob∣structions, and impedes both the circulation of the blood and the secretion of humours, by checking insensible perspiration. If the moisture of the air increases, we experience an unaccountable torpor and <HI>ennui;</HI> with the loss of energy we lose our gaiety, and the mind is depressed with the body. Damp places and districts are always unwholesome, but more particularly so in cold weather. Mois∣ture, by diminishing perspiration, produces disorders of the throat, the breast, and the abdomen. But the most dangerous and fatal effects on the human body have been observ∣ed to arise from moist air accompanied with hot weather; for, when moisture has impair∣ed our energy, heat increases the evil in a great degree, by opening the pores through which the moisture penetrates into the body, and predisposing every part of it to putrefac∣tion and dissolution. This accounts for the
<PB N="159" REF="039111_0189_10139FEB0798E688"/>
great mortality prevalent during the hot sea∣son at Batavia, and some of the West India islands.</P>
<P><HI>Dry</HI> and <HI>cool air,</HI> from possessing a due de∣gree of elasticity, promotes in an extraordi∣nary degree the serenity and alertness of mind and body; hence it is found uncommonly salubrious to hypochondriacs. But a dry and very cold air generates inflammatory diseases; because it inspissates the blood. Dry and hot air affects us like heat, and enervates the body. But a dry air, which is not too warm, is both agreeable and healthy.</P>
<P>Great and <HI>sudden changes</HI> from a warm to a cold, or from a light to a heavy air, are high∣ly injurious to valetudinarians, and even to the healthy. Soldiers in camp, and, some∣times, travellers, feel very severely the bad effects of cold and moist night air, after long marches and journeys. Weakly and infirm persons have frequently ominous sensations, previous to any remarkable change of the air.</P>
<P>A moderately heavy and elastic air is the most agreeable and salutary to the human bo∣dy; hence nature has not assigned us our con∣stant residence on the summits of mountains. Yet a light and rarefied air, such as is felt on the highest mountains, is not so unfit for res∣piration, nor does it manifest so noxious an influence on the human body, as was formerly believed. The latest travellers assure us of the contrary, and speak in decisive terms of the salutary effects of the air, during a short stay in those elevated regions.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="039111_0190_10139FADA56CBFE0"/>
Among the different WINDS—which are nothing else but strong commotions of the air—the long continued <HI>North wind</HI> is compara∣tively the most wholesome; it purifies the at∣mosphere of noxious vapours, renders the air serene and dry, and thus imparts to the hu∣man body elasticity, vigour, activity, and a lively colour. It is, however, troublesome to persons of delicate habits, and occasions in them coughs, inflammation of the throat, pains in the side, obstructions, and febrile dis∣eases. The <HI>South wind</HI> weakens and relaxes the body, and is very apt to produce catarrhal affections. The <HI>Morning wind</HI> is very drying; but <HI>Evening winds</HI> are cool and moist, being frequently accompanied with rain and change∣able weather. All these winds differ materi∣ally in their qualities, from local circumstan∣ces, and accordingly as they blow over a Con∣tinent, over the Ocean, or over high moun∣tains and icy regions, from which they carry along with them more or less <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cold and hu∣mid particles. But upon the whole, too dry weather is always more healthy, than that which is too moist.</P>
<P>Of the four SEASONS of the year, the <HI>Au∣tumn</HI> is the most unhealthy; because then the particles of perspiration not only remain on the body, but are in a state inclining to pu∣trefaction. This disadvantage, however, may be easily obviated by guarding ourselves with proper dress and choosing a suitable diet. Too light a dress, and too thin stockings, are not advisable at this season. The <HI>Spring sea∣son</HI> is, in general, the most healthy. Spring,
<PB N="161" REF="039111_0191_10139FEEB58D3698"/>
and the beginning of <HI>Summer,</HI> are most saluta∣ry to children and young persons; while the Summer, and the beginning of <HI>Autumn,</HI> agree best with the aged. The latter end of Au∣tumn, and the beginning of <HI>Winter,</HI> are com∣monly the most healthy seasons to persons of a middle age.</P>
<P>It has been remarked by medical men, that certain diseases appear and disappear accord∣ing to the different seasons. Thus, putrid and bilious disorders prevail in Summer; in∣flammatory diseases in Winter, and the ca∣tarrhal, mucous, and gastric or stomachic af∣fections, in Spring and Autumn. It has been further observed, that in Spring the blood usually circulates more freely; hence proba∣bly arose the ancient practice of blood-letting, and taking laxatives at certain regular peri∣ods; both of which I have already pointed out, in the preceding Chapter, as dangerous in their tendency, and always hurtful to the healthy.</P>
<P>As the vegetable kingdom is renewed in Spring, and as vegetation, in general, is most lively in that season, there can be little doubt, that the pure vital air is then most copiously evolved, by means of the solar light and heat. Hence it follows, that the vernal air is more wholesome than that of Autumn, which is saturated with corrupted and putrifying par∣ticles. Still the cold of Autumn, and the frequent winds then prevalent, prove ex∣tremely efficacious in counteracting the bane∣ful effects of corruption and putrefaction.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="039111_0192_10139FAF2AC53418"/>
If the temperature of the air correspond with the natural constitution of the season, we may expect what is called a healthy year, and that the prevalent diseases will be of a mild nature; but if the weather does not agree with the general laws of the season; if, for instance, the Winter prove warm, or at least moderate, or the Spring cold and severe, with sudden alternations of heat, we may ex∣pect to find the year pretty generally marked with serious and obstinate diseases.</P>
<P>The temperature of the air depends not a little on the natural situation of the country, whether it lie high or low; whether its moun∣tains oppose or give a free passage to the winds; whether it contains flowing or stagnant wa∣ters or morasses, and whether it is open or covered with woods.—Country air, upon the whole, is always purer than that of towns, narrow streets, and crowded buildings.</P>
<P>All <HI>strongly-scented bodies</HI> are more or less pernicious; as well those of a disagreeable smell, as the greater number of fragrant per∣fumes. The latter, if too strong, are more particularly dangerous, as a sense of disgust does not naturally incline us to avoid them. Among these may be comprehended all veg∣etable odours strongly volatile and pungent, and which thereby stimulate and stupify the nerves. Hence people, who carry large nose∣gays in the hot days of summer, are apt to feel themselves variously and strongly affected, particularly with drowsiness. From this ap∣parently innocent cause, head-achs, vertigoes, fainting-sits, and apoplexies have frequently
<PB N="163" REF="039111_0193_10139FF29320F130"/>
been produced in persons of a plethoric habit. These, as well as people of a delicate constitu∣tion, are liable to such affections, from the fragrance of many balsamic plants, but par∣ticularly from the strong scent of lilies, roses, pinks, the blossoms of oranges, hyacinths, and the like.—Many flowers emit a more power∣ful fragrance in the night than in the day-time, and the effluvia of several trees and other vegetable bodies are peculiarly dangerous, and sometimes mortal. Of this nature are the walnut and yew trees, under whose shades persons have actually died, who had fallen asleep; and likewise the deadly <HI>Upas</HI> of Suri∣nam, and the no less poisonous <HI>Manchineel</HI> tree of the West Indies.</P>
<P>Aromatics of every kind taint the air in a similar manner, introducing into the human body particles foreign to its nature, all exciting more or less an inclination to sleep. Saffron and hops have sometimes proved fatal; the former in particular has often produced a sleep terminating in death, in those incautious indi∣viduals, who had lain down in the ware-houses or upon the bags, in which it was packed. Ambergris and musk are also, on account of their powerful fragrance, very hurtful to per∣sons of an irritable and nervous temperament.</P>
<P>Dwellings in the vicinity of lakes, fens, and marshes, are exposed to all the noxious effects of a moist atmosphere, namely, to the various species of intermittent fevers or agues;—on the other hand, it has been observed, that persons living on the banks of rivers, though at times subject to these, are not very liable to
<PB N="164" REF="039111_0194_10139FB3CE505A38"/>
other diseases, and that running water has a tendency to purify the air, when it is saturated with inflammable particles.</P>
<P>Too sudden a transition from warm to cold air, or the reverse, is pernicious; but to ex∣change, however suddenly, an unhealthy at∣mosphere for a healthier, is at all times safe and highly advisable. Numberless instances have proved, that such as were constantly in∣disposed in the corrupted air of a town very quickly recovered their health, on removing to the purer atmosphere of the country. Yet the question, <HI>Which air is the most wholesome to live in?</HI> will admit only of a conditional an∣swer. We must attend not only to the par∣ticular constitution of the air, but also to the nature and habits of the individual. Neither should we too hastily pronounce every air unwholesome, that does not appear to agree <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>with us. The air of every climate, whether hot, cold, or temperate, may be called healthy, provided it be pure and clear, and occasionally agitated by wind: but a gross atmosphere, and one loaded with animal or vegetable ex∣halations, is certainly deleterious. After all, perhaps the longevity of the inhabitants may be considered as the best evidence of a healthy district. Thus we find uncommonly long-lived persons in high countries, or such as are visited by frequent winds, and also in small sea-port towns. In villages and places thinly inhabited, the proportion of aged people is considerably greater than in cities or populous towns. This may be ascribed partly to a less degree of corruption in the air, and partly to
<PB N="165" REF="039111_0195_10139FF418C63190"/>
a more simple mode of life prevailing in such places: for wealth and riches, the concomi∣tant effects of which are greater luxury and extravagance in living, usually keep pace with the increase of population; and if the numer∣ous chimney-fires of our populous cities did not serve as so many well-contrived machines for rarefying the atmosphere, incalculable mischiefs must inevitably ensue.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Improvement of Air in Dwelling-Houses.</HEAD>
<P>A HOUSE built on a rising ground, on a healthy soil, in an open, dry country, and neither exposed to the greatest degree of cold in winter, nor to the highest point of heat in summer, may be said to stand in a healthy sit∣uation. Hence those apartments are the most healthful as well as comfortable to the indi∣vidual, which enjoy a pure and free circula∣tion of air in summer, and the cheering rays of the sun in winter: the heat of summer be∣ing considerably tempered by the former, and the severity of winter much abated by the latter. Farther, a proper size and height are requisite to constitute a healthful apartment; for low rooms are detrimental to health, par∣ticularly when inhabited by large families, and seldom aired, or rather, which is fre∣quently the case, when all air is carefully ex∣cluded by close doors, shutters, curtains, &amp;c. The most proper place of residence in winter is one with a southern aspect, not only as be∣ing
<PB N="166" REF="039111_0196_10139FB664253838"/>
more dry, but also more cheerful, and therefore attended with a favourable influence on the spirits. In summer, the situation of a room may be chosen either to the North or to the East, the latter of which is preferable, because it admits the first enlivening rays of the Sun.</P>
<P>Although it is not in every person's power to choose his habitation agreeably to the laws of health; yet this choice of a pure and healthy air is not sufficiently attended to, and it cer∣tainly deserves as much consideration in pur∣chasing an estate or country-house as the qual∣ity of the soil or other lucrative advantages.</P>
<P>The local constitution of the air depends not merely on the exhalations of the soil itself, but likewise on the different vapours, con∣ducted to and blended with it by the winds, from adjoining places. Thus in a dry and sandy country, considered of itself as healthy, the air may be rendered extremely unwhole∣some from the vicinity of marshes or other stagnant waters.</P>
<P>The better to judge of the salubrity of the air in any district, we should examine the properties of the wells and springs; for both <HI>air</HI> and <HI>water</HI> absorb the saline and mineral particles of the soil. We may pretty certainly conclude, that a country producing good wa∣ter, enjoys likewise a salubrious air; and as the best water is tasteless, so the purest air is free from any smell whatever.</P>
<P>The most certain marks, by which to dis∣tinguish whether the air in rooms be damp or not, are the following: the walls or tapes∣try
<PB N="167" REF="039111_0197_10139FF6B62CF520"/>
change their colour; bread in closets ac∣quires a mouldy surface; spunges in the rooms retain their moisture; loaf-sugar turns soft; iron rusts; brass and copper acquire a green colour, or verdigris; and wooden fur∣niture moulders and crumbles to pieces.</P>
<P>The sitting-room ought, if possible, to be above the ground floor, or in the second story; it should be so constructed as to admit a free current of air; but if this cannot be done, it should be frequently aired by opening the windows in dry weather, or by fumigating the room, either with vinegar dropped upon warm stones, or evaporated in a bason over a lamp, or with sugar, juniper-berries, and the like.</P>
<P>Every room is filled with <HI>three</HI> different <HI>strata</HI> of air: 1. The lower part of the room contains the heaviest species of air, namely, fixed or carbonic acid gas, particularly in apartments situated on the ground-floor, or even under ground; 2. The middle part of the room is filled with the lighter atmospheric air; and 3. The uppermost stratum contains the lightest or inflammable air, the most cor∣rupted of the three, in consequence of the processes it has undergone by respiration and combustion. In lofty apartments this con∣taminated species of air is not inspired by the lungs; because the middle stratum, or the most wholesome of the three, extends to a height above that of a man.</P>
<P>A continual change of the air, by opening the doors and occasionally the windows, how∣ever advisable, is yet not sufficient to preserve
<PB N="168" REF="039111_0198_1013A0381F97E400"/>
a healthy atmosphere in an apartment. For this important purpose the following improve∣ments may be suggested as useful: 1st, Small apertures in the ceiling of the room, or through the walls close to the ceiling, in an oblique direction, so that the rain and snow cannot penetrate into it; 2d, Ventilators, that is, small moveable wheels made of brass or sheet-iron, which are applied to some part of the window-panes, and set in motion by the pressure of the external air. This is an ex∣cellent contrivance to introduce fresh atmos∣pheric air into a room, by occasionally open∣ing and shutting the door. The most proper height for placing these ventilators is about seven feet from the floor; 3d, Air-tubes run∣ning in a straight direction from the door to the fire-place, or rather to the wall of the chimney, and concealed under the floor of the room. As such tubes, however, are very expensive, and appear better calculated to con∣vey the smoke up the chimney, after all means have been tried in vain, than to conduct the corrupted air from the upper part of a room, I shall mention a better and much easier me∣thod of effecting this purpose. It is a late discovery of a physician in France, who con∣trived it with a view to save the great expense of ventilating or airing large wards in hospit∣als, filled with patients who laboured under putrid distempers, particularly in the heat of summer. He caused a number of small holes to be made in the uppermost part of the win∣dow-frames; into these holes he placed from without an equal number of funnels, present∣ing
<PB N="169" REF="039111_0199_1013A0E479682EA8"/>
an aperture of nine or twelve inches di∣ameter, and terminating in the inside almost in a point, or at least in an opening not ex∣ceeding the size of a small quill. By means of these simple machines, the air in the sick rooms was so effectually renewed, by the great and constant pressure of atmospheric air from without, that any other artificial process for correcting the putrid air in a large hospital was judged to be unnecessary.</P>
<P>Above all things, the windows and doors of sitting and bed-rooms, when it can be done conveniently, ought to be left open for a cer∣tain space of time, every day. This, howev∣er, requires to be done at the proper time, neither too early in the morning, nor when it grows dark in the evening, during the ver∣nal and autumnal months; nor at the time when the horizon is overspread with a thick fog. The windows should be opened, when the air is pure and serene; or, in general, when there is less danger to be apprehended from the external air than from that within. Sometimes it may be proper to make use of what is called <HI>pumping</HI> the room, or moving the door backward and forward for some minutes together; but in spring and autumn, our sitting-rooms, and even in winter, bed-rooms, ought to be perflated every clear day, by currents of fresh air, for a considerable time.</P>
<P>In the hot days of summer, the windows may be opened early in the morning and in the evening, in order to cool and refresh the heated air of the room by that from without.
<PB N="170" REF="039111_0200_1013A03BC9900750"/>
It is however not safe (and has sometimes proved fatal) to leave the windows of a bed-room open at night during the summer-months, as there is no small hazard of check∣ing perspiration by the cool night-air; the susceptibility of the pores being then very much increased by the heat of the day, and the warmth of the bed. Rooms which we inhabit in the day-time may be safely left open during the night. In summer-houses, or such as are surrounded with plants and trees, it will be proper not to open the windows of bed or other rooms, till some time after sun-rise, and to shut them at sun-set; they require also to be opened and shut sooner in hazy than in serene weather.</P>
<P>The airing of apartments should not be ne∣glected even in winter, as coal-fires alone are not sufficient to carry off the corrupted parti∣cles of air, unless they be assisted by ventila∣tors.—Here I must oppose and contradict a prevailing, yet mistaken notion, that fire in a room where the windows are open, introdu∣ces moist air. On the contrary, the most proper time for opening the windows is after lighting up a brisk fire; as the warmer air of the room will then be powerfully attracted by the colder atmospheric air, and the cor∣rupt particles of the air within most speedily dissipated.</P>
<P>In <HI>moist</HI> and <HI>cold</HI> air, the dress should be somewhat warmer than usual: Flannel may then be worn with double advantage next the skin, and the rooms we inhabit should be warmed, or at least fumigated, with the ber∣ries
<PB N="171" REF="039111_0201_10139FF8444B22E8"/>
of Juniper or similar shrubs. Fumigation is likewise attended with this advantage, that it contributes to dry and in some degree to warm the air.</P>
<P>In <HI>moist</HI> and <HI>warm</HI> air the explosion of a lit∣tle gunpowder will be of use, or vinegar may be evaporated with greater safety, and the floor and walls sprinkled over with this ex∣cellent antiseptic.</P>
<P><HI>Hot</HI> and <HI>dry</HI> air may be tempered by pla∣cing vessels filled with cold water in different parts of a room; or, as is often practised in hot climates, by sprinkling water over the floor. The greater or less degree of corrup∣tion of the air, in an apartment, depends very much on the kind of labour or exercise per∣formed in it: Six watchmakers will not cor∣rupt the air nearly so much as two carpenters would do in the same space and time; hence appears the necessity of appropriating lofty rooms instead of low garrets, for the work∣shops of mechanics.</P>
<P>Green plants and flowers placed before the windows are both an agreeable and useful or∣nament, if not of too strong a fragrance. In serene weather, it may be expedient to strew fresh plants (not flowers) in a dwelling-room, exposed to the rays of the sun, taking care, however, to remove them as soon as the sun withdraws. This method of exposing plants, or even the branches of trees with green leaves, in apartments, may have a beneficial influence on valetudinarians, and particularly on asthmatic persons, as vital air, or <HI>oxygen</HI> is
<PB N="172" REF="039111_0202_1013A03D4FBB4C48"/>
thereby generated, and introduced very grad∣ually into the lungs.</P>
<P>Large trees with thick foliage should not be placed very near the windows of a house; for, besides that they obstruct the access of day-light and fresh air, and have thus a ten∣dency to make the rooms damp, their exha∣lations in the evening, and during the night, are by no means wholesome. Trees planted at the distance of eight or ten yards from the house, do not prevent the free access of air; they present an agreeable object to the eye, and cannot be too much recommended, both on account of their cooling shade in summer, and the salutary exhalations they emit during the day.</P>
<P>It has been already mentioned, that the burning of candles corrupts the air; for which reason the custom of illuminating assembly or other large rooms, with a <HI>superfluous</HI> number of candles, must be very detrimental. This extravagance becomes still more dangerous in places where, beside the crowd of people, great quantities of provisions, dressed with the rich∣est spices of the East and West, contribute to saturate the air with the most heterogeneous particles. And as persons of tender lungs must suffer extremely in such an atmosphere, it would be proper to provide all public rooms with a competent number of conic ventilators, of the description before mentioned.</P>
<P>Strictly speaking, we ought not to sit in the room where we dine, or take victuals, until it be aired again: those who can afford this luxury, should be careful not to stay for hours
<PB N="173" REF="039111_0203_10139FFDEDDFA700"/>
together over their bottle in the dining-room: the bad effects of such contaminated air are not perceived by the persons continuing their libations after dinner, but are very sensibly felt by any one coming in from the fresh air.</P>
<P>It is no less unhealthy to sleep in a room where a quantity of <HI>green fruit</HI> is kept, a cir∣cumstance not attended to in country places, particularly by those who deal in fruit. From its fragrance a portion of inflammable matter exhales, which soon impregnates the air. Hence females of delicate habits have been known to faint, in approaching places where a few quinces were kept. For the same rea∣son, store-rooms and pantries are extremely unwholesome, if provisions of all kinds, ani∣mal as well as vegetable, be kept in them; es∣pecially oil, candles, fat, flesh meat, whether raw, boiled, or roasted, pastry, and the like.</P>
<P>As foul linen readily imbibes the perspira∣ble matter of the skin, it should never be suf∣fered to remain any time in a bed-room, or sitting-room.</P>
<P>If possible, we should not sit through the day in a room in which we have slept; as the bed-clothes, and particularly feather beds, very slowly part with the exhalations they have imbibed during the night, neither is it suffi∣cient for purifying the air of the room, that it has been ever so well aired in the morning.</P>
<P>The vapour of <HI>charcoal</HI> produces, particu∣larly in close apartments, dangerous and fre∣quently fatal effects. It fills the atmosphere with sulphuric particles which may be inspir∣ed, but cannot be expired:—they retard the
<PB N="174" REF="039111_0204_1013A03FE3700D50"/>
motion of the blood-vessels, stagnate the blood itself, penetrate into the head, and produce an acute pain, vertigo, and torpor. Hence the greatest precaution is necessary, where char∣coal is used, as innumerable fatal accidents have happened from this source. Dyers, who employ it for drying their cloth upon frames, seldom fail to experience great injury to their health.</P>
<P>All employments, in which persons work among impure wool, oil, colours, and the like, are to a certain degree detrimental to health. Washing, ironing, dressing the hair with greasy curling-irons, burning lamp oil, fre∣quent painting of the walls, all saturate the air of a room with pernicious damp and sul∣phuric vapours. From the change, which oil and candles in a state of combustion pro∣duce in the colour of a white wall and white curtains, we may infer, that this fetid steam must also penetrate into the human body, and if so, must materially affect it.</P>
<P>It farther deserves to be remarked, that all damp vapours are prejudicial, although they should not in themselves have a tendency to corrupt the air. Hence the keeping of wet linen, or even wet clothes, umbrellas, and the like, in dwelling-rooms, should by all means be avoided. Mechanics and others, who are obliged to dry wet things in their strongly heated apartments—joiners, turners, potters, bookbinders, &amp;c. are particularly liable to swellings, and other disagreeable affections in the relaxed vessels of absorption.</P>

<HEAD>Of Heat and Cold.</HEAD>
<P>As observation and experience inform us, that immoderate heat relaxes the body, over∣heats the blood, and exsiccates or consumes the other fluids; and that the people who live in temperate regions are more hardy and vigorous, and attain to a greater age, than the inhabitants of warmer climates; it fol∣lows from these premises, that we ought not to enervate the human body by keeping it immoderately warm, by dressing it with a su∣perfluity of clothes, by plunging it unneces∣sarily into hot baths, by using too strong fires in temperate weather, or least of all, by sleep∣ing in warm rooms, and perhaps on the most heating of all substances, feather beds. The temperature of a sitting-room should not ex∣ceed 60° of Fahrenheit's thermometer; that of a bed-room may be about 50°, as the me∣dium temperature of our climate is between 50 and 55°.</P>
<P>Although man is, no doubt, capable of in∣uring himself to a very great degree of heat as well as of cold, yet sudden changes can be supported only by the few who possess very hardened constitutions. The gradual changes of the seasons prepare us in the safest manner to sustain all the alternations of cold and hot weather. It is therefore an error, and of no small consequence, in the modern system of education, that we generally endeavour to habituate our children to the support of cold weather only. Persons who cannot bear the heat of the sun, or strongly heated rooms, are,
<PB N="176" REF="039111_0206_1013A043D77BFA68"/>
from their excessive delicacy, frequently ex∣posed to the most violent, nay to mortal acci∣dents. Hence children ought to be slowly and gradually accustomed to these inconve∣niencies, which indeed occur frequently, and are more dangerous than those arising from sudden transitions to a colder temperature: for the effects of the latter may, in a great measure, be obviated by exercise and muscu∣lar action.</P>
<P>In the sultry days of summer, we should be particularly on our guard against violently overheating the body;—in autumn, we should not dress too lightly, and in the mornings and evenings always somewhat warmer;—in short, we ought to avoid every thing that appears likely to check and repel perspiration. The baneful custom of accommodating our dress to the almanack and the fashion, rather than to the vicissitudes of the weather, in this inconstant climate, must necessarily be pro∣ductive of many disagreeable consequences. Above all things, we ought to change our summer-dress pretty early in autumn, and to clothe ourselves gradually warmer, according to the variations of the weather. Yet after all, perhaps it would be most advisable to ac∣custom ourselves to one kind of dress only for all seasons. The propriety of this custom I shall more particularly consider in the fourth Chapter.</P>
<P>With respect to the proper time for heat∣ing rooms in autumn, it has been supposed, that early fires are unwholesome and produc∣tive of frequent catarrhs. This assertion is
<PB N="177" REF="039111_0207_1013A000F8A724B0"/>
certainly ill founded; for in warming a room, as well as in clothing the body, we should not so much be regulated by the particular time of the year, as the state of the weather, and the degrees of actual heat and cold: in at∣tending to this circumstance, we cannot easily mistake. If, in the temperate days of autumn, the room should feel colder than the external air, it is time to make a moderate fire: in damp and cold weather this is an useful pre∣caution, even in summer. Those who from caprice, parsimony, or prejudice, would rather shiver on some weeks longer, than consult their sensations, often feel the consequence of a violent cold. The Dutch and German stoves certainly afford more uniform heat in a room, though they might not be considered cheerful enough for an English company.</P>
<P>As we can neither breathe nor live without fresh air, we ought not to withdraw our bod∣ies too much from the bracing effects of cold. In this respect, we should act conformably to nature, that is, in the same degree as the warmer weather changes to a colder state, we should gradually expose ourselves to the various changes of temperature. The cold will then neither feel unpleasant, nor impede the necessary perspiration; especially if we oppose it with vigour and bodily exercise. We ought also to take more solid sustenance in winter than in summer; because, by the longer continued motion or digestive process of the stomach, the circulation of the blood is accelerated, from which the natural heat of the body is produced. Nature herself dictates
<PB N="178" REF="039111_0208_1013A0455D9CF2A8"/>
a compliance with this precept, as she has pro∣vided us with more substantial articles of food during the former season than the latter.</P>
<P>Lastly, as every sudden change of the weath∣er from heat to cold, and the reverse, is preju∣dicial to the body, we ought to guard against every circumstance by which <HI>perspiration</HI> may be suddenly checked. Hence we never should remove from a strongly heated apartment in∣to a fresh and cold air, unless we are provided with a warmer dress;—in hot days, or after violent exercise, we should not frequent vaults, cellars, or ice-houses, undress immediately af∣ter overheating the body, nor take rest upon a damp soil or upon stones, nor bathe in cold water. Such transgressions have often been punished with instant death, or, what is still worse, have brought on a painful and linger∣ing species of consumption, which has hither∣to baffled the united efforts of the Faculty, and which annually makes dreadful havoc among people of a middle age.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">According to the statement given by the Bills of Mortality, the total number of deaths in London, during the three spring months of 1799, amounted to 5271. Among these, no less than 1353, or <HI>upwards of one fourth,</HI> were carried off by <HI>consumption!</HI>—Although consumption and <HI>decline</HI> are terms often used to express many other <HI>chronic</HI> diseases, as well as <HI>pulmonary consumption,</HI> so that the above stated number probably includes various species of decline, yet, even with these allowances, the number of victims to <HI>general consumption</HI> is truly terrific. Let the reader reflect, for a moment, on the fol∣lowing melancholy inference:—If the population of the country consist of between nine and ten millions, of whom the 30th or the 33d part, that is, about 300,000, die annually, it follows that this merciless disease, CONSUMPTION, cuts off about 80,000 persons ev∣ery year, in Great Britain alone, and these generally in the prime of life, when Society ought to be benefited by their mental and bod∣ily exertions!!</NOTE> It is devout∣ly to be wished, that the experiments, now
<PB N="179" REF="039111_0209_1013A002823640F0"/>
pursued with factitious airs or gases, and with the fox-glove, may afford some remedy against this formidable destroyer of the human spe∣cies, which cuts off incredible numbers in the bloom of life, and spares neither age, rank, nor sex. And, as there is so much reason to believe, that a great proportion of consump∣tive cases originate from the sudden transi∣tions above mentioned, no language can be strong enough to deprecate practices, as inju∣dicious as they are destructive.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Cleanliness in general.</HEAD>
<P>THIS domestic virtue ought to extend its influence to every object connected with the human frame; to the preparation and consumption of food and drink; to dress, habitation, household furniture, and all our physical wants; in a word, cleanliness should not be confined merely to the interior do∣mestic economy; it claims our attention in every place which we occupy, and wherein we breathe.</P>
<P>Let our clothes, linen, beds, covers, blank∣ets and sheets, be clean and dry; as all these substances absorb perspirable matter, and check the process of perspiration. Articles of dress which are soiled, and come into contact with the skin, being placed immediately over the pores, reimbibe the humours already per∣spired, and return them to the body by the absorbents. Dirty linen will never attract the useless or noxious matter, which is secreted from the blood, and ejected from the body; it remains on the pores of the skin, and is ei∣ther again absorbed by the vessels, or clogs those emunctories which require always to be kept open. For a similar reason, it is highly
<PB N="181" REF="039111_0211_1013A0082BB44738"/>
improper and dangerous to wear the clothes of sick persons, especially in contagious dis∣tempers.</P>
<P>Let the body, and particularly the joints, be frequently washed with pure water, espe∣cially in summer, when the perspirable mat∣ter, being of an unctuous, clammy nature, obstructs the excretion by the pores. The face, neck and hands, being most exposed to the air, dust, and the like, ought to be daily washed, both morning and evening. Atten∣tion should also be paid to the ears, by clean∣ing them occasionally; so that the sense of hearing may not be impaired by an accumu∣lation of wax, which from its acrid nature may prove unpleasant as well as injurious. The whole head ought to be frequently wash∣ed and cleaned, even though no hair-powder be used; as it perspires very much, and is be∣sides exposed to dust and other particles in the atmosphere. Washing opens the pores, while the comb, by its close application to the skin, dissolves the viscid humours, and ren∣ders them fluid.</P>
<P>The mouth should be rinsed every morn∣ing, after dinner, and at night, with cold wa∣ter, but in winter the chill should be taken off. The frequent washing of the mouth is otherwise necessary, because the viscid slime, and small particles of food which settle about the interstices of the teeth, are very apt to putrify, and, if not removed, will infect the breath, and gradually injure the teeth them∣selves. Besides, this slime settles on the tongue,
<PB N="182" REF="039111_0212_1013A049755123B0"/>
covers the papillae by which food is tasted, and renders the palate less sensible.</P>
<P>It is scarcely necessary to observe, that the nose also should not be overlooked, as by neg∣lecting to remove the secreted moisture in due time, the effects may become troublesome and detrimental to the organs of smell. In chil∣dren, the nose ought to be occasionally wash∣ed; it having been found that the unpleasant smell, peculiar to some infants, is owing to the habitual neglect of cleaning that organ.</P>
<P>The tongue should be cleaned every morn∣ing, either with a small piece of whalebone, or with a sage leaf. This leaf is likewise use∣ful for polishing the teeth. To clean the throat, we should gargle it with fresh water, and swallow a mouthful of water every morn∣ing—the latter, however, must not be at∣tempted too hastily▪ but, when we once ac∣custom ourselves to the practice, we shall find it attended with advantage.</P>
<P>It is necessary, particularly in hot weather, to wash the feet frequently; as they perspire much, and are more exposed to dust than any other part of the body. The water should be warm, but not too much so, because hot water thus used relaxes the fibres, drives the blood upwards, and occasions head-achs. The proper degree of heat for young persons to wash in, between 96 and 98° of Fahrenheit, and for the aged between 98 and 100°, or somewhat more than milk-warm.</P>
<P>The removing of the beard and nails is no insignificant matter in the care of health, By shaving, we promote perspiration. Long
<PB N="183" REF="039111_0213_1013A009B1562080"/>
nails, especially as they were in fashion some years ago, disfigure the hands, and prevent the feet from expanding properly: but the nails ought not to be cut too close, otherwise the toes will be obstructed in their pressure on the ground, and the fingers in feeling. They may also be easily wounded; and wounds under the nails are generally attended with disagreeable consequences, on account of the many nerves running in that direction. Too long nails on the toes are apt to grow into the flesh, to become an obstacle in walking, and sometimes to occasion considerable pain.</P>
<P>In the vessels used for preparing food and drink, we ought likewise to pay proper atten∣tion to cleanliness. Every particle of filth in∣troduced into the stomach may prove hurtful to it, to the tender intestines, to the blood, and consequently to the whole body. For the same reason, it is not only indelicate, but also unwholesome, to dine or take any food in places where an offensive smell prevails.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>On the management of the Teeth.</HEAD>
<P>THE principal requisite for the preservation of the teeth is, never to retire to rest without having cleaned them: for this prevents the viscous matter of food, collected during the day, from corrupting them in the night. The tooth-ach, now so common, is frequently ow∣ing to a hollow state of the teeth, but still more frequently originates in a want of clean∣liness.
<PB N="184" REF="039111_0214_1013A04C0AE62940"/>
The cleaning of the teeth, however, requires precaution. What is called the Tar∣tar of the Teeth, is of a corrosive nature, and should be removed with the greatest care. The manner in which most Dentists treat the teeth, as well as their powders, tinctures, and other dentifrices, although highly puffed off and strongly recommended, are obviously pernicious. They deprive the teeth of their enamel, make them loose, and spoil the gums. The various dentifrices, whether <HI>Royal</HI> or <HI>Im∣perial,</HI> advertised in the public papers, are at least of doubtful, if not injurious effect. It is an astonishing instance of credulity and infat∣uation, that people will take external and in∣ternal <HI>medicines upon trust,</HI> when they would hesitate to take any <HI>food,</HI> with which they are unacquainted.</P>
<P>If there be too much tartar, so that it ad∣heres like a cement between two teeth, its be∣ing incautiously removed will deprive the teeth of the tartarous cohesion, and conse∣quently of their support; thus, from the constant contact of the tongue, lips and food, they will be shaken and loosened. The same will happen, should the tartar be allowed to eat away the gum from the root of the tooth. If in this case the foundation of the tooth be injured, it will necessarily be rendered loose, the gums being no longer able to retain a tooth, which is deprived of its intermedi∣ate cement.</P>
<P>The tartar therefore must not be broken, all at once, with iron or glass instruments; but may be gradually scraped away with a
<PB N="185" REF="039111_0215_1013A00B36A5F998"/>
blunt or broad cut quill, or some similar sub∣stance, from which the enamel of the teeth can suffer no injury. Most kinds of dissolvent drops, especially those sold as specifics for whitening the teeth, are made up of vitriolic acid, diluted with some distilled waters—They are of no service, but, on the contrary, remove the enamel with the tartar, and thus spoil the teeth for ever. The common tooth-brushes are liable to the same objection.</P>
<P>To prevent the tartar from settling on the teeth, they ought to be kept clean, by wash∣ing them every morning and evening. Cer∣tain articles of food and drink should likewise be mentioned, as having a tendency to pro∣duce and accumulate the tartar—such are all viscous and saline substances, as salted and smoked meat, cheese, roasted eggs, the flesh of tame and wild animals kept too long for the sake of making it more tender and pala∣table, truffles, and all species of mushrooms; beans, peas, chesnuts, vinegar, tart wines, and all kinds of acid fruit.</P>
<P>An expedient equally safe and effectual, for removing the tartar, is, to cover the teeth with a fine powder of <HI>Gum Tragacanth,</HI> or with soft wax, and by that means to extract the tartar at once, together with this adhe∣sive covering.</P>
<P>Although it does not enter into the plan of these Lectures to treat of the various diseases to which the teeth are subject, or to describe the different methods pursued in curing them, yet I judge it necessary to point out some of the most simple and approved remedies in that
<PB N="186" REF="039111_0216_1013A050F26FE550"/>
very painful affection, the tooth-ach. If the complaint proceed from a hollow and carious tooth, some soft extract of the Peruvian Bark may be placed in the cavity of the tooth; if this should not remove the pain, a few drops of <HI>Cajeput oil</HI> upon cotton may be applied to the hollow tooth, or rubbed externally upon the painful side of the cheek. THUNBERG, the Swedish Traveller, introduced the use of Cajeput oil into Europe, having often wit∣nessed its powerful and almost instantaneous effects in the East Indies, where it is the last and only comfort of gouty and rheumatic sufferers.</P>
<P><HI>Dr. Richter,</HI> an eminent Physician of Göt∣tingen, informs us that he has frequently re∣lieved the most violent tooth-ach, by applying externally the essence of <HI>pimpinella,</HI> or Burnet-saxifrage, with an equal quantity of lauda∣num, adding to it a drop or two of the essen∣tial oil of cloves. Though external remedies are not likely to effect a radical cure of this malady, yet in urgent cases they may be safe∣ly resorted to, especially if applied so as not to injure the skin of the face; for they will often produce a temporary relief. If, how∣ever, the tooth-ach proceed from <HI>no local</HI> cause; if, for instance, it be owing to a corrupted stomach, to catarrhal, rheumatic, hysteric, venereal, or other affections; all the specifics ever discovered cannot remove the pain, until the cause also be, wholly or in part, removed. In my own practice, I have found the oil of Savin, or Juniper oil, preferable to laudanum, in its effects on a hollow tooth; the latter is at best an uncertain remedy.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="039111_0217_1013A00F258DFBB0"/>
In scorbutic affections of the teeth and gums, a vegetable diet, consisting chiefly of ripe fruit, and mucilaginous vegetables, will be found the best corrective. Beside these, a fine powder, made of three parts of double-re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ined sugar, and one part of burnt alum, may be employed with advantage for the pur∣pose of rubbing them. Sugar is an excellent antiseptic; and IMBERT DE LONNES, a French Physician, reports, that a whole ship's com∣pany was once cured of an alarming scurvy, by living for some time, from necessity, upon sugar alone. We should also consider the connexion subsisting between the teeth and the stomach; if the former be unequal to the purposes of mastication, the digestive powers will be gradually impaired, and the soundest stomach corrupted. To neglect the teeth, therefore, is to neglect the stomach; and if the stomach be weakened, the whole mass of the fluids, and particularly the blood, will ul∣timately be tainted with crude, unassimilated, and acrimonious humours.</P>
<P>To dissolve and wash away the superfluous, slimy, and unctuous matters which produce the tartar, fresh water is sufficient; or it may be rendered a little more acrid by the admix∣ture of a small quantity of common salt. Acids and alkalies, so frequently employed as dentifrices, are of too corrosive a nature; and alkalies in particular injure the gums, perhaps the teeth themselves, while acids deprive them of their enamel, and thus occasion a speedy external corruption and inevitable gangrene within.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="039111_0218_1013A053954A7C38"/>
The most simple dentifrice is a crust of bread hard toasted, and reduced to a fine powder. This is fully calculated to absorb the viscid, oleaginous particles, and to remove the stony or tartarous matter. The bread, how∣ever, should not be toasted too black, as in that case it would evolve an acrid alkaline salt, which might prove hurtful. A still better dentifrice is a moderately fine powder of the Peruvian Bark, particularly of the genuine red species, which strengthens the gums, without inflaming them.</P>
<P>In cleaning the teeth we ought not to make use of brushes or sponges, but of the finger, which being provided with the finest papillary vessels, is a much better and more proper in∣strument, and precludes the necessity of re∣sorting to artificial means. Besides, the fin∣ger has the advantage of being soft and plia∣ble, and of feeling any immoderate pressure too sensibly, to permit us to do injury to the teeth or gums:—hence, it is an ill-judged delicacy alone which can prevent us from making use of it, preferably to even the best tooth-brushes.</P>
<P>For cleaning the interstices between the teeth, we should not employ pins or needles, whether made of gold, silver, or steel; for all metallic substances are apt to canker the teeth. If toothpicks be at all advisable, they should be made of soft wood, or quills cut in a blunt point. In my own opinion, none should be used; for, of whatever materials they are made, they open, loosen, and injure the teeth, by making room for the tartar and
<PB N="189" REF="039111_0219_1013A010A99700D0"/>
other matters, to prey upon the teeth and gums. To answer every purpose of tooth∣picks, a thick and soft cotton cloth should be used, to rub the teeth over gently after eve∣ry meal: but if people have once accustomed themselves to regularly picking their teeth, then indeed the cotton frictions may perhaps be too late.</P>
<P>Lastly, the cleaning and brushing of the teeth, however useful and necessary, is insuf∣ficient to prevent the settling of the tartar, and the consequent injury to the teeth; for the source of both evils does not exist in the mouth, but really proceeds from the stomach, and a corrupted state of the fluids. For this reason, the medical treatment of the teeth re∣quires a particular regimen and diet, accord∣ing to the individual case of every patient.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Use of Baths.</HEAD>
<P>THIS important branch of dietetic regimen is of excellent use and efficacy, both in the cure and prevention of diseases. Though the ancients could less dispense with the use of the bath, on account of the frequently of their athletic exercises, as well as from the want of linen, which was then much less in use than at present, yet in our times it would be of great service, if the use of baths were more general and frequent, and this beneficial practice not confined to particular places or seasons, as a mere matter of fashion. Con∣sidered
<PB N="190" REF="039111_0220_1013A0552F160420"/>
as a species of universal domestic rem∣edy, as one which forms the basis of cleanli∣ness, bathing, in its different forms, may be pronounced one of the most extensive and beneficial restorers of health and vigour. I am not so sanguine, however, in my expecta∣tions, as to think that the cure of all mala∣dies and diseases may be effected by the bath, as was lately promised by a noted empiric in this country, who most sagaciously impreg∣nated his vapour baths with the collective produce of the vegetable kingdom. Such a general remedy is just as chimerical as the most famous panaceas, the tincture of gold not excepted.</P>
<P>Bathing, whether in warm or cold water, produces the most salutary effect on the ab∣sorbent vessels; which would otherwise re∣conduct the impurities of the skin through the pores, to the no small injury of health. To those in a perfect state of vigour, the fre∣quent use of the bath is less necessary than to the infirm; as the healthy possess a greater power to resist impurities, by means of their unimpaired perspiration, the elasticity of their minute vessels, and the due consistence of their circulating fluids. The case is very dif∣ferent with the infirm, the delicate, and the aged. In these, the slowness of circulation, the viscidity or clamminess of the fluids, the constant efforts of nature to propel the im∣purities towards the skin, combine to render the frequent washing of their bodies an essen∣tial requisite to their physical existence.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="039111_0221_1013A0133B46AAD8"/>
Baths, considered as the means of curing diseases and restoring health, if judiciously applied, are likewise of peculiar advantage; and though, in this respect, they do not prop∣erly make part of a regular system of dietetics, yet I shall request the indulgence of the read∣er, while I make a few necessary remarks rel∣ative to the proper application of the bath, it being so frequently used as a mere dietetic remedy. Much depends on a clear and ac∣curate knowledge of the properties and effects of the different baths. I shall therefore di∣vide them into two principal classes, the <HI>warm</HI> and the <HI>cold</HI> bath.</P>
<P>The <HI>warm,</HI> that is, the tepid or lukewarm bath, being about the temperature of the blood, between 96 and 98° of Fahrenheit, has usually been considered as apt to weaken and relax the body; but this is certainly an ill-founded notion. It is only when its heat exceeds that of the human body (as in the <HI>Hot Bath</HI> and <HI>King's Bath</HI> at BATH, both of which are from 18 to 20 degrees higher than blood-heat) that the warm bath <HI>can</HI> produce a debilitating effect. Indeed, baths of the above immoderate heat ought not to be used in their natural state, that is, without redu∣cing their temperature by cold water, except in particular cases, and under the immediate advice of a physician. On the contrary, the lukewarm or tepid bath, from 96 downwards to 85, is always safe; and is so far from re∣laxing the tone of the solids, that it may just∣ly be considered as one of the most powerful and universal restoratives with which we are
<PB N="192" REF="039111_0222_1013A057D0197D90"/>
acquainted. Instead of heating the body, it has a cooling effect; it diminishes the quick∣ness of the pulse, and reduces it in a greater proportion, according as the pulse has been more quick and unnatural, and according to the length of time the bath is continued. Hence tepid baths are of eminent service, where the body has been over-heated, from whatever cause, whether after fatigue from travelling, or severe bodily exercise, or after violent exertion and perturbation of mind; as they allay the tempestuous and irregular movements of the body, and consequently, in the strictest sense, invigorate the system. By their softening, moistening, and tumify∣ing power, they greatly contribute to the formation and growth of the body of young persons, and are of singular benefit to those, in whom we perceive a tendency to arrive too early at the consistence of a settled age; so that the warm bath is particularly adapted to prolong the state of youth, and retard for some time the approach of full manhood. This effect the tepid baths produce in a man∣ner exactly alike, in the coldest as well as in the hottest climates.</P>
<P>From what has been advanced, it will not be difficult to discover, in what particular dis∣orders the tepid bath may be of the greatest service, and the reason why they prove so eminently useful (particularly in a parched and rough state of the skin) in paralytic, spas∣modic, bilious, consumptive, hypochondriac, hysteric, and insane cases, as well as in an ac∣rimonious and corrupted state of the fluids,
<PB N="193" REF="039111_0223_1013A014C65761F0"/>
such as scorbutic and leprous eruptions, lues, &amp;c. One obvious effect of the habitual use of the bath, particularly the tepid, is, that it soft∣ens and renews the external integuments of the body. It considerably increases the pressure on the body from without; hence breathing, particularly on entering the bath, is frequent∣ly somewhat difficult, until the muscles have by practice become inured to a greater degree of resistance. Yet this effect, which in most instances is of small importance, requires the greatest precaution in some particular cases, so far as to prevent the use of the bath alto∣gether; for instance, in persons of a full hab∣it, who are in danger of breaking some of the internal blood-vessels, by the precipitate use of the bath, whether warm or cold.</P>
<P>These few hints will be sufficient to deter∣mine the cases, in which the lukewarm bath may be resorted to with safety and advan∣tage, as a <HI>dietetical</HI> remedy. Its application in the treatment of diseases is foreign to the object of this Chapter, and demands the most minute inquiry into the nature of the cases which indicate the use of it, as it is of itself a potent remedy, which, if improperly used, may produce a contrary effect.</P>
<P>Bathing in rivers, as well as in the sea, is effectual for every purpose of cleaning the body; it washes away impurities from the surface, opens the cutaneous vessels for a due perspiration, and increases the activity of the circulation of the blood. For these reasons, it cannot be too much recommended, not only to the infirm and debilitated, under cer∣tain
<PB N="194" REF="039111_0224_1013A05B76262308"/>
restrictions, but likewise to the healthy. The apprehension of bad consequences from the coldness of the water, is in reality ill-founded; for, besides that it produces a strengthening effect, by its astringent property, the cold sensation is not of itself hurtful.</P>
<P>The same precaution, however, is requisite in the use of the cold as that of the tepid bath; for after having overheated the body, especially in the hot days of summer, it may prove instantly fatal, by inducing a state of apoplexy. Hence the plethoric, the asthmatic, and all those who perceive a great determina∣tion of the blood to the head, should be very circumspect in its use. For although the con∣sequence may not prove immediately fatal, yet the too great strain and pressure may easily burst some of the smaller blood-vessels in the head or breast, and thereby lay the foundation of an incurable disorder. To such as are of a sound and robust constitution, bathing may be rendered an agreeable exercise, by swim∣ming against the stream; for, the fibres and vessels being obliged to resist the power of the undulating waves, the nerves are thereby ex∣cited into action.</P>
<P>Before I proceed to lay down dietetical rules for the use of the bath, I shall premise a brief historical narrative of this excellent prac∣tice, and generally explain its sensible effects.</P>
<P>Among the Greeks, and particularly the Spartans, bathing was not intrusted to the ca∣price of individuals, but considered as a pub∣lic institution, being governed and arranged agreeably to the express laws of the State. We
<PB N="195" REF="039111_0225_1013A01874FE0A40"/>
learn also from Sacred History, that among the Jews, at a much earlier period, persons under certain circumstances were pronounced unclean, and consequently unfit to hold any intercourse or communion with others, until they had performed the appointed ablutions. The Greeks, according to their own histori∣ans, learnt this practice from the Egyptians, and the Romans from the Greeks. With those celebrated nations, public and private baths formed an important branch of useful and ornamental architecture. Many opulent individuals courted the favour of the people by lavishing their treasures in the establish∣ment and decoration of public baths; and to this day we frequently discover the valuable remains of these national edifices. Among the Romans, the baths were in time convert∣ed into regular and luxurious dwelling-places, in which the sons of the patricians and of the wealthy were educated; a circumstance suffi∣ciently ascertained in the history of CHARLES the Great.</P>
<P>The changes which the contact of cold wa∣ter produces on the body, naturally lead us to inquire into the physical nature and properties of the cold bath. The lightest water is at least 800 times heavier than air; from which it has been concluded, that the former presses upon the human body with a force propor∣tionally great. If, therefore, the column of air, which presses upon our body with a force equal to 39,900lb. could be converted into water, the whole weight of that pressure would amount to 31,920,000lb. Yet, as our health
<PB N="196" REF="039111_0226_1013A05D00DB8F08"/>
is affected by a difference in the pressure of the air, occasionally varying from 3 to 4000lb. we may easily understand, that the human body is not calculated to sustain, for any length of time, the great pressure of water. From this cause, the most experienced negro divers dare not venture beyond a certain depth of the sea; well knowing it would be impossible to rise up against the additional weight of wa∣ter incumbent upon their bodies.</P>
<P>The sensible <HI>properties</HI> of the <HI>Cold Bath,</HI> in general, consist in its power of contracting the solid parts, and of inspissating the fluids. Any part of the body, which is exposed to the sudden contact of cold water, experiences at the same instant a degree of tension and contraction, and becomes narrow and smaller. Not only the blood-vessels, but likewise the small capillary tubes, are liable to this con∣traction and subsequent relaxation. What is vulgarly called <HI>goose-skin</HI> is an effort of the cu∣taneous fibres, a contraction of the orifices of the absorbent and exhalant vessels, occasioned by mental perturbation, spasms, or the effect of cold.—Hence it happens, that by the cold bath all the blood-vessels of the skin, and of the muscles in immediate contact with it, are so constricted and diminished, that at the time of this violent exertion they are unable to re∣ceive the usual quantity of blood. The small∣er vessels of the skin are likewise closed, and press upon the humours contained in them, so as to prevent all perspiration during this pressure. Thus all the fibres of the skin and muscles are brought into close contact; and
<PB N="197" REF="039111_0227_1013A01C1A240828"/>
if the humours contained in these tubes had no other outlets, by which to discharge them∣selves, they would become thick or inspissa∣ted, and lose their natural warmth. Were this inspissation of the fluids really to take place, it would be attended with dangerous stagnations and obstructions. That it does not, however, produce these fatal effects, may be ascribed to the following cause. As soon as the pressure is made against the external vessels, the blood retreats from them, in search of places where it may find less resistance. All the great vessels within the body afford receptacles, into which it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> flows, till the principal arteries, and the veins of the intes∣tines, being filled, extended, and enlarged, it rises to the heart. Although the effect con∣sequent on the cold bath may be considered as altogether mechanical, yet this simple ope∣ration is frequently productive of the most important and beneficial effects.</P>
<P>All other strengthening remedies, opera∣ting, in general, only on the fluid parts of the body, require to be previously dissolved by the fluids, blended with the mass of blood, and thereby conducted to the solid parts. The cold bath, on the contrary, acts almost instan∣taneously on the solid parts themselves, and produces its bracing effect, before a single drop of blood has been commuted. From which remedy, therefore, is it most likely we should derive the desired effect, that which imme∣diately answers the purpose, or that which must pass through so many canals, and under∣go so many changes, before it arrives at the
<PB N="198" REF="039111_0228_1013A05FAB974D40"/>
place where it is to exert its efficacy? The sudden changes arising from the application of the cold bath contribute in various ways to brace the human body. The relaxed fibres of the skin and the muscles acquire more solidi∣ty and compactness from contraction. Their elasticity is increased, and thus a considerable defect removed: the nerves are stimulated and incited to those powerful exertions, on which the ease, vigour, and habitual spright∣liness of the body so much depend. From that degree of irritability which the nerves possess, when in a debilitated state, arise all hysteric, spasmodic, and convulsive symptoms and affections. These may be mitigated or removed by the cold bath; because it greatly affects and alters the state of the nerves; it shakes and animates them, and by its forcible operation overcomes their tendency to preter∣natural rigidity and other disagreeable sensa∣tions. Here then we have two causes, which illustrate the excellent effects of this remedy: there remains, however, a third, more im∣portant and powerful, yet to be explained.</P>
<P>The blood, which by external pressure is driven into the internal vessels, extends and enlarges them, without diminishing that con∣tractile force or tendency which is peculiar to every artery. At the moment when the ex∣ternal pressure ceases, all the internal vessels exert their powers of self-contraction more forcibly than usual, as they are more strongly extended, and consequently enabled to exer∣cise a greater force. The blood returned to the cutaneous and muscular vessels, finds its
<PB N="199" REF="039111_0229_1013A01D9FE06A68"/>
reservoirs contracted and invigorated; it flows through muscles, the fibres of which have acquired greater elasticity and power of resistance. It is accelerated in its new motion by these improved fibres and veins, and the result of the collective powers is a fresh im∣pulse and rapidity given to its circulation. Although, at the first immersion, the uniform course of it is somewhat interrupted, this tem∣porary stoppage serves afterwards to re-estab∣lish and promote it. The blood can now penetrate with ease into the smallest capillary vessels; and it can circulate freely through every part of the animal machine, without affecting or relaxing the solids.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Such are the advantages which the theory of bathing holds out. I shall, however, quote a respectable authority, which may be of use to remove some erroneous notions hitherto very prevalent, in the practice of cold bathing.</P>
<P>"In the earlier stages of exercise, (says Dr. CURRIE, of <HI>Liverpool,</HI>) before profuse perspiration has dissipated the heat, and fatigue debil∣itated the living power, nothing is more safe, according to my expe∣rience, than the cold bath. This is so true, that I have for some years constantly directed infirm persons to use such a degree of exer∣cise, before immersion, as may produce some increased action of the vascular system, with some increase of heat, and thus secure a force of reaction under the shock, which otherwise might not always take place. The popular opinion, that it is safest to go perfectly cool into the water, is founded on erroneous notions, and sometimes pro∣ductive of injurious consequences. Thus persons heated and begin∣ning to perspire, often think it necessary to wait on the edge of the bath, until they are perfectly cooled, and then plunging into the wa∣ter, feel a sudden chilliness that is alarming and dangerous. In such cases the injury is generally imputed to going into the water too warm, whereas in truth it arises from going in too cold.</P>
<P>"But though it be perfectly safe to go into the cold bath in the earlier stages of exercise, nothing is more dangerous than this prac∣tice, after exercise has produced profuse perspiration, and terminated in languor and fatigue; because in such circumstances the heat is not only sinking rapidly, but the system parts more easily with the por∣tion that remains.</P>
<P>"In his Essay on Smimming, FRANKLIN makes the following ob∣servation:—<HI>'During the great heats of summer, there is no danger in bathing, however warm we may be, in rivers which have been thoroughly warmed by the sun. But to throw ourselves into cold spring water, when the body has been heated by exercise in the sun, is an imprudence which may prove <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tal. I once knew on instance of four young men, who, having worked at harvest in the heat of the day, with a view of refreshing them∣selves, plunged into a spring of cold water; two died on the spot, a third the next morning, and the fourth recovered with great difficulty.'</HI> The authority of the American Bacon is of great weight in Medicine, as in every branch of science, and particularly in what respects immer∣sion in water; for doubtless he spent more time in this element, than any philosopher of modern days. It may, however, be easily sup∣posed, that he adopted the commonly received opinion, that the in∣jury arose from the persons in question going in <HI>when hot,</HI> instead of from going in <HI>when cooling, after having been heated;</HI> to which last circumstance it can hardly be doubted; that the fatal accident he re∣lates was to be imputed."</P>
<P>These remarks are worthy of the learned Dr. Currie;—at the same time, instead of advising any person to use the <HI>cold bath</HI> after ex∣ercise, I would certainly prefer the <HI>tepid</HI> or <HI>lukewarm bath,</HI> both on account of the greater safety attending the use of it, and because it possesses nearly all the advantages of the cold bath, without being li∣able to so many strong objections. Besides, the cold bath is alto∣gether improper in a weak state of the lungs, in all complaints of the breast, in dropsies, in plethoric habits, and for very corpulent indi∣viduals; in all which cases the lukewarm bath may, if duly modifi∣ed, produce effects highly beneficial.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="039111_0230_1013A062776D83A0"/>
The healthy and the vigorous, who resort to the cold bath, on account of its cleansing and bracing effects, may continue in it, with safe∣ty, for a considerable time. But to strengthen and to give elasticity to the solid parts, every thing depends upon the sudden impression of the cold. This primary effect will be weak∣ened or frustrated by remaining in the bath till the water feels warm, whereby the pres∣sing or vibrating action on the nerves at length ceases. The most proper time of bathing is, when the stomach is not employed in diges∣tion; as in the morning or forenoon, or from three to four hours after dinner.</P>
<P>The cold bath, between 65 and 32° of Fahrenheit, is not, strictly speaking, a dietetic
<PB N="201" REF="039111_0231_1013A02044AC9438"/>
remedy;—its effects are not so much calcu∣lated for the healthy and robust, as for the in∣firm and diseased, under peculiar circumstan∣ces. The external use of cold water is of sin∣gular benefit, when applied to particular parts of the body, where its use may be much long∣er continued without danger, and where we may accomplish the intended effects, in a man∣ner, by compulsion and perseverance.</P>
<P>Of all the parts of the body, the head re∣ceives most benefit from the affusion of cold water; this is a simple and effectual remedy against too great an impulse of the blood to∣wards the head, where persons are threatened with apoplexy; in disorders of the brain and cranium; in wounds and other complaints, to which the head is subject. In these instan∣ces, its effects may be still farther improved by frigorific or cooling salts. The affusion of water upon the abdomen has likewise been employed with great advantage, in cases of obstinate costiveness, affording almost instan∣taneous relief, when internal remedies have produced no effect. This should not, how∣ever, induce any person to try that remedy indiscriminately, or without proper advice.</P>
<P>On the contrary, in all those cases where the cold bath might repel certain eruptive humours, which Nature determines towards the surface of the body, it cannot be resorted to without danger. Apoplexies have been the frequent consequences of an unwary use of the cold bath; more frequent, indeed, than is generally suspected. And yet the popular opinion still prevalent, is, that there can be no
<PB N="202" REF="039111_0232_1013A0662816CD58"/>
better practice, than to plunge into the cold bath at all times, and in all states of the body, in order to strengthen the nerves. Children, in particular, are indiscriminately accustomed to it from their infancy, to restore them to that degree of bodily vigour, for which our ancestors were so famed. That many chil∣dren, by the daily practice of bathing them in cold water, grow and continue healthy and strong, proves as little, as that many infants become vigorous and robust in the most un∣wholesome climates, and under the most un∣favourable management.—Some think to for∣tify the body, by the use of the cold bath, against the vicissitudes of the weather; but it can be proved that children, who from their infancy have been bathed in cold water, are as much exposed to coughs and catarrhs, as those who have not been habituated to this violent practice, provided they have not been mismanaged by effeminating indulgence. In general, all artificial plans of hardening and bracing the bodies of children, are commend∣able only, when the child shows no strong and lasting aversion to them.</P>
<P>It should be considered that, as the cold bath powerfully contracts the fibres by its frequent use, it imparts to the juvenile body an unnat∣ural degree of solidity and compactness, whereby it too early acquires the properties of an adult. The skin of such children as have been too frequently bathed, is generally much drier and harder than it ought to be at their age. It is a remark of GALEN, that the cold bath does not agree with a growing per∣son,
<PB N="203" REF="039111_0233_1013A022E2862A50"/>
and he advises young people not to bathe at all till the body be completely formed. Is it not inconsistent, that by cold bathing we expect to bring the body of youth to the vig∣our of age, and that afterwards, when age ap∣proaches, we should wish to render it softer, and restore its energy, by lukewarm bathing? Hence the cold bath, for the purpose of strengthening children, must ever be consid∣ered as a doubtful remedy.</P>
<P>We now proceed to lay down some rules for the use of the cold bath, in the cases where it may be of service. 1st, Every cold bath applied to the whole body ought to be of short duration; all depends upon the first impres∣sion the cold makes on the skin and nerves, it being this impression which hardens us against the effects of rough and cold weather:—2d, The head should be always first wetted, either by immersion, or by pouring water up∣on it, or the application of wet cloths, and then plunging over head into the bath:—3d, The immersion ought always to be sudden, not only because it is less felt than when we enter the bath slowly and timorously, but likewise because the effect of the first impres∣sion is uniform all over the body, and the blood in this manner is not driven from the lower to the upper parts. Hence the Shower Bath possesses great advantages, as it pours the water suddenly upon the whole body, and thus in the most perfect manner fulfils the three rules above specified:—4th, The due temperature of the cold bath can be ascertain∣ed only in relation to individual cases: as it
<PB N="204" REF="039111_0234_1013A067AD42F1D0"/>
extends from 33 to 56° of Fahrenheit, except in <HI>partial</HI> bathings, where, as has been already observed, the degree of cold may, and often ought to be, increased by ice, nitre, alum, salt, sal ammoniac, or other artificial means:—5th, Gentle exercise ought to precede the cold bath, to produce some reaction of the vascular sys∣tem in entering into it; for neither complete rest nor violent exercise are proper, previous to the use of this remedy:—6th, The morn∣ing or forenoon is the most proper time for cold bathing, unless it be in a river,—then the afternoon, or towards the evening, when the water has been warmed by the sun, and the dinner has been digested, are the most eli∣gible periods of the day. A light breakfast will not be detrimental before using the bath:—7th, While in the water, we should not re∣main inactive, but move about, in order to promote the circulation of the blood from the centre of the body to the extremities:—8th, After immersion, the whole body ought to be wiped, as quickly as possible, with a dry and somewhat rough cloth. Moderate exercise out of doors, if convenient, is proper, and in∣deed necessary.</P>
<P>To specify the various situations, in which the cold bath may be used with perfect safety and advantage, would lead me too far, and does not belong, strictly speaking, to the sub∣ject of this book. I shall, however, enumerate generally certain cases, in which we must ab∣solutely refrain from the cold bath. 1. In a general plethora or full habit of body, and in the febrile disposition which attends it; in he∣morrhages
<PB N="205" REF="039111_0235_1013A02690D74398"/>
or fluxes of blood, and in every kind of inflammation. 2. In constipations or obstructions of the abdominal intestines. 3. In diseases of the breast, difficult breathing, and short and dry coughs. 4. In an acrimo∣nious state of the fluids, bad colour of the face, difficult healing of the flesh, and the scurvy, properly so called. 5. In gouty and rheumat∣ic paroxysms. 6. In cutaneous diseases. 7. In a state of pregnancy. And lastly, 8. In a deformed or ill-shaped state of the body, ex∣cept in some particular cases to be determined by a physician.</P>
<P>The best method of cold bathing is in the sea or a river. Where, from necessity, it is done in the house, I recommend the <HI>Shower Bath,</HI> for which a proper apparatus is to be had at the tinman's. Where the saving of expense is an object, it may be effectually sup∣plied by the following easy expedient: Fill a common watering-pot with cold water; let the patient sit down undressed upon a stool, which may be placed in a large tub; and let the hair, if not cut short, be spread over the shoulders as loosely as possible; then pour the water from the pot over the patient's head, face, neck, shoulders, and all parts of the body progressively down to the feet, till the whole has been thoroughly bathed. Let the patient then be rubbed dry, and take gentle exercise, as has been already recommended, until the sensation of cold be succeeded by a gentle glow all over him. When we first resort to this kind of bath, it may be used gently, and with water having some degree of warmth,
<PB N="206" REF="039111_0236_1013A06934925BD8"/>
so as not to make the shock too great; but, as the patient becomes accustomed to it, the degree of cold may be increased, the water may be allowed to fall from a greater height, and the holes in the pan may be made larger, so as to make the shower heavier. A large sponge may, in some measure, be substituted for a watering-pot.</P>
<P>Although the Shower Bath does not cov∣er the surface of the body so universally as the usual cold baths, this circumstance is rather favourable than otherwise: for those parts, which the water has not touched, feel the impression by sympathy, as much as those in actual contact with it. Every drop of wa∣ter becomes a partial cold bath in miniature, and thus a stronger impression is excited than in any other mode of bathing. The Shower Bath, for the following reasons, possesses ad∣vantages superior to all others. 1. The sud∣den contact of the water, which in the com∣mon bath is only momentary, may here be prolonged, repeated, and made slow or quick, or modified at pleasure. 2. The head and breast, which are exposed to some inconve∣nience and danger in the common bath, are here at once secured, by receiving the first shock of the water; the blood is consequent∣ly impelled to the lower parts of the body; and the patient finds no obstruction in breath∣ing, or undulations of blood towards the head. 3. The heavy pressure on the body occasioned by the weight of the water, and the free cir∣culation of the blood in the parts touched by it, being, for some time at least, interrupted,
<PB N="207" REF="039111_0237_1013A0292E2D4DE8"/>
make the usual way of bathing often more detrimental than useful. The Shower Bath, on the contrary, descends in single drops, which are at once more stimulating and pleas∣ant than the immersion into cold water, and it can be more readily procured, and more easily modified and adapted to the circumstan∣ces of the patient.</P>
<P>I shall conclude this Chapter with some account of what is called the <HI>Aërial</HI> or <HI>Air Bath.</HI> This is a late invention, the effects of which have not yet been sufficiently ascer∣tained. Experience informs us, that by ex∣posing the naked body for a short time to an agreeable cool, nay to a cold air, we perceive effects somewhat similar to those produced by the cold bath; particularly that of a pleasant sensation of heat diffused over the whole body, after having again dressed. There is little danger of catching cold upon this oc∣casion: for in a place where we already feel a certain degree of cold in our usual dress, the sensation of it will not be much increased, if we undress altogether. It may also be re∣marked, that with the <HI>whole</HI> body naked, we have much less to apprehend from the effects of cold, than by exposing or keeping one part of it less covered than another.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lord M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nboddo,</HI> the author of "<HI>Ancient Metaphysics,</HI>" who died in May 1799, in his 90th year, till very lately accustomed him∣self to take violent exercise, when quite undressed, in the open air. He also anointed his body, like the ancients, with aromatic oils, especially in certain states of the atmosphere: in the severest weath∣er he never would enter a carriage, which he looked upon as an un∣justifiable effeminacy; but annually rode from Edinburgh to Lon∣don, and took other long journeys on horseback. And this venera∣ble judge and amiable man found himself, long after the age of 70 as hale, and in many respects as vigorous, as he had been at 30 or 40.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="039111_0238_1013A06AB85284A0"/>
This species of bath certainly deserves far∣ther trials. A spacious apartment, with open windows, may serve every purpose of moving in the free air. And here I would recom∣mend to all who are engaged in sedentary and literary pursuits, to walk with their heads uncovered in an open, and even in the coldest air, as being a simple and excellent means to strengthen the head, and to remove those complaints which arise from intense thought and close mental application.</P>
<P>To rub the body with woollen cloths, or with soft brushes, is of great advantage, by gently stimulating the fibres, increasing the circulation of the fluids to the external parts, and promoting a free perspiration, together with all the other evacuations. Persons of a delicate habit, of a sedentary life, and those who are liable to sudden twitches of the ten∣dons, cramps, and lameness, may effectually relieve, or rather prevent these complaints, by causing the whole body, particularly the limbs, to be rubbed every morning and evening, for about half an hour, with rough cloths or soft brushes, till the skin becomes red. This fric∣tion is still more beneficial to the aged than to the young; and it may in a great meas∣ure produce the salutary effects of bodily ex∣ercise.</P>
<P>Frequent cutting the hair is of advantage to the eyes, the ears, and to the whole body. So the daily washing of the head with cold water, is an excellent remedy against periodi∣cal head-achs. In coryzas, or defluxions of the humours from the head, and in weak eyes,
<PB N="209" REF="039111_0239_1013A02AB43EC950"/>
the shaving of the head often affords im∣mediate relief; while at the same time it opens the pores, and promotes perspiration. It is altogether a mistaken idea, that there is a danger of catching cold from the practice of washing the head, or leaving it exposed to the free air, after having been washed. The more frequently the surface is cleansed of scurvy and scaly impurities, the more easy and comfortable we feel. The oftener the hair is cut, the more quickly it grows again; and this easy operation supplies the place of a constant blister or artificial issue.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>All secret compositions or pomatums for making the hair grow long and thick, are little better than fraud and imposition, and gen∣erally consist of noxious ingredients. In place of them, I recommend a simple mixture of olive oil and spirits of rosemary; to which may be added, a few drops of oil of nutmeg. With this mixture let the hair be anointed every night; but sparingly at first.</P>
<P>To change the hair to a darker colour, the liquid remedies sold by the perfumers are generally dangerous, as consisting of lead, antimo∣ny, and other metallic solutions. The only method to be pursued with safety is, to cut the hair pretty close to the head, and comb it morning and evening with a leaden comb, which simple process can∣not injure or check the perspiration of the head.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>Friction of the soles of the feet is very ad∣vantageous; but, on account of the great number of highly sensible nerves in them, such practice must not be carried to excess. A proper degree of warmth and perspiration in the feet is always a favourable symptom of health. Besides, they should often be bathed in cold, or, still better, in lukewarm water, well rubbed, and the nails cautiously cut. There will then be no danger of the nails growing into the flesh, or of corns or other callosities arising in the feet. All the methods hitherto discovered of extracting corns, afford only
<PB N="210" REF="039111_0240_101466CE4702BD20"/>
<HI>temporary</HI> ease; and it is very dangerous to cut them too deep, on account of the many nerves running in every direction of the toes. Easy shoes, frequent bathing the feet in luke∣warm water, with a little salt and pot-ashes dissolved in it, and a plaster made of equal parts of Gum Galbanum, Saffron, and Cam∣phor, are the only remedies I can recommend against this troublesome complaint.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of DRESS;—the advantages and disadvantages of the usual mode of Clothing considered, together with proposals for remedying its defects.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>IN considering the various articles of Dress, attention must be paid both to their <HI>sub∣stance</HI> and <HI>form.</HI> Our mode of clothing may occasion trouble, disease, and death—1. When we attempt by it to improve some supposed defects of the body, which cannot be done without injury; and, 2. When it consists of improper substances, whether used from ne∣cessity, or in compliance with fashion and ca∣price.</P>
<P>To avoid ridicule, we comply with the pre∣vailing fashions of the day; but, if this com∣pliance be prejudical to health, it shows great weakness to allow ourselves to be carried away with the stream; and although a deviation from the mode may, for the moment, excite the ridicule of the thoughtless, yet those who have the boldness to oppose the Tyrant, when his dictatorial mandates are injurious to health, will in the end triumph, and they may them∣selves have the satisfaction to introduce dress∣es, at once healthful and elegant. Happily, in this respect, people begin in some degree to think for themselves; that rigid adherence to the mode, which heretofore dressed both men and women as much in uniform suits as a regiment of soldiers, does not now dis∣gust us.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="039111_0242_1013A0706CE26310"/>
The general properties of a good dress are the three following:—1. That it be not so hard and unpliable, as to obstruct the free and easy motion of the joints, and be uncomfort∣able, either from its weight or tightness:—2. That it preserve the body in that degree of temperature which is most agreeable, as well as most suitable to the different functions and motions in a healthy state;—and, 3. That it do not produce any detrimental effects, by in∣creasing perspiration in an unnecessary degree, or too much absorbing the vapours of the at∣mosphere.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>On the Materials used for Articles of Dress.</HEAD>
<P>THE property of receiving, repelling, and emitting heat and cold, depends not only on the substance from which our dress is made, and its shape or form, but also on the colour. Clothes of a light colour have the least attrac∣tion for heat, and therefore are the most prop∣er in hot weather. Substances of a very smooth and shining surface strongly reflect the rays of the sun, which cannot penetrate through them; hence the advantage, in hot climates, of hats covered with oil-skin, partic∣ularly of a green or white colour, of smooth and shining shoes, glazed gowns, and the like. Dazzling colours are offensive, and a person who suffers from weak eyes will injure them still more by wearing crimson or scarlet, or being much in company with others thus dressed. For a similar reason, splendid white
<PB N="213" REF="039111_0243_1013A03007406648"/>
dresses, steel buttons, gold and silver lace, and all ornaments of this sort, are detrimental to vision.</P>
<P><HI>Animal Wool</HI> produces a moderate warmth, on account of the stimulus and gentle friction it occasions on the skin. By its use, animal electricity is elicited, perspiration promoted, the perspired humours are absorbed, and again easily evaporated, on account of the porous nature of this substance.</P>
<P><HI>Linen Cloth,</HI> by diminishing the elasticity of the skin, increases the internal warmth, and at the same time, from its compactness, retains too readily the perspirable humours, and does not part with them so readily as wool. Soil∣ed shirts therefore produce a disagreeable cool∣ing sensation, and stop perspiration, especially if made of thick strong cloth, and not regu∣larly changed every day.</P>
<P><HI>Silk</HI> occasions a gentle stimulus, but does not sufficiently promote perspiration, though it attracts less humidity from the atmosphere than linen.</P>
<P><HI>Oil-skin,</HI> or wax-cloth, increases perspiration in an uncommon degree, but does not admit it to evaporate again, and is therefore appli∣cable only in certain diseases.</P>
<P><HI>Cotton</HI> stands in the middle between animal wool and linen; it increases warmth and per∣spiration, imbibes and retains the perspired humours, to the injury of the wearer, and like wool readily attracts infectious matter.</P>
<P>All kinds of <HI>Fur</HI> are more noxious than use∣ful, both with respect to their structure and constituent parts. They contain many alka∣line
<PB N="214" REF="039111_0244_1013A071F2C15CC8"/>
and oily particles; they are generally too compact and unequal on the surface; they too much stimulate and increase perspiration, by promoting the access of humours to the skin; they do not allow the perspirable matter to escape, soon acquire an intolerable smell, and, more than any other substance, attract and retain contagious effluvia. Experience in∣forms us, that nations who dress in fur, par∣ticularly in hot countries, are frequently ex∣posed to diseases, owing to a want of cleanli∣ness and free perspiration; such are the putrid fevers of Hungary, the plague among the Turks, and the singular disease of the hair in Poland, called <HI>plica polonica,</HI> which curls the whole hair into a number of twists, that have the appearance of so many greasy strings, and afford a ghastly spectacle.</P>
<P>We ought, therefore, to choose a dress agreeable to the season and weather, as well as to the constitution of the body. Woollen clothes are the most proper in spring, autumn, and winter; because they moderately warm the body, do not weaken it by the abstraction of too many exhalations, and have the fewest points of contact, or, in other words, do not attach so close to the body, as any other ma∣terials of dress.</P>
<P>In summer, most people are accustomed to wear thin clothes, which are scarcely proper in our changeable climate. It is not, in that season, advisable to take much exercise in thin dresses, particularly in the heat of the day. Nor should we venture to wear such clothes early in the morning, when the air is cool,
<PB N="215" REF="039111_0245_1013A033038CDFE0"/>
and the pores of the skin have been dilated by the warmth of the bed;—but still less in the evening, when the heat of the day has so much opened them, that perspiration may be easily checked, and health materially injured.</P>
<P>In our variable climate, it would be prefer∣able to adopt a species of dress, which is near∣ly uniform in all seasons; for as thin clothes are more immediately pervaded by heat, dur∣ing the least exercise, it certainly would be more prudent and rational to wear a dress that is calculated to withstand the effects both of cold and heat. That there is no danger in adopting a general dress for all seasons; that, on the contrary, it is the most beneficial plan of managing the body, with regard to the most important function, namely, that of per∣spiration, I shall endeavour to prove in the next Section.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>On the immediate Covering of the Skin.</HEAD>
<P>THE first and principal rule with respect to this subject is, that <HI>the covering of the skin ought to be always the same, and not be changed accord∣ing to the season and the weather.</HI> The usual consequence of this change is, in the first place, an uneasy and painful sensation. A skin ac∣customed to fine linen only, cannot endure the sensation occasioned by a coarser kind; and cotton is still more disagreeable, but, most of all, animal wool or flannel. In the next place, to change the dress according to the weather,
<PB N="216" REF="039111_0246_1013A0748AED5530"/>
occupies more time, and requires more ex∣pense, than is convenient to the great mass of the people.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, there are many who, from mistaken maxims of health, accommodate the covering of their skins to the seasons: they dress themselves in winter in flannel, towards spring and autumn in cotton, and in summer in linen; a method as absurd as it is danger∣ous. Notwithstanding the difficulties, which each of these changes must produce, while we undergo this new trial on our skin, we expose ourselves at the same time, in every such change, to all possible dangers arising from cold and repelled perspiration. This custom is the more dangerous, as it is usually prac∣tised by the infirm, the tender, and the aged, who regulate themselves less by the tempera∣ture of the weather, than by the days of the almanack, when they are periodically accus∣tomed to change their dresses.</P>
<P>The question, then, which is the <HI>most proper covering of the skin,</HI> is easily answered. <HI>Animal wool</HI> seems to recommend itself to us by the very circumstance, that hair is the general covering of those animals which most resem∣ble man in their structure. If men were ha∣bituated to go naked in the colder climates, the human body would, no doubt, also be bet∣ter covered with hair. Animals, in winter as well as in summer, have the same coat, except that in the coldest season their hair is uni∣formly somewhat thicker and longer, conse∣quently also warmer than in summer, especially in the northern countries.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="039111_0247_1013A0359915BCD8"/>
Not only analogy, but experience also proves, that wool worn next the skin has indisputa∣ble advantages over all other substances. For, 1. Flannel is but a slow conductor of <HI>external</HI> heat to the body, and it the more easily at∣tracts <HI>internal</HI> heat, and allows it to evaporate the more readily, as it is more porous than any other texture. 2. A sultry atmosphere is extremely troublesome, particularly where great heat is combined with moisture, the hu∣midity checking perspiration, and at the same time conducting too many aqueous particles to the absorbent vessels from without. Here then flannel is of incomparable service, since it keeps the vessels of the skin constantly open, causes them to perspire freely, and admits but a very small degree of external moisture.</P>
<P>The principal good effect of flannel, how∣ever, consists in its gentle and beneficial stim∣ulus, or that friction which it occasions on the skin, and by which it opens the pores. We must not imagine, that flannel <HI>of itself</HI> heats more than linen or cotton; for it is not the heat which occasions inconvenience, but the circumstance of the perspirable matter adher∣ing to the skin. In flannel, we may perspire without danger, and undertake any exercise of the body, without disagreeable sensations; not so, when linen remains wet on the skin. If we taken violent exercise in flannel, perspi∣ration is necessarily increased, but the perspired matter is communicated through the flan∣nel to the atmosphere, and the skin remains dry, warm, and comfortable. If we take the same exercise in linen shirts, perspiration is
<PB N="218" REF="039111_0248_1013A07717D5F590"/>
indeed also increased, but the perspired matter is not imparted to the atmosphere, but is in∣spissated in a fluid state, clogs the linen, and remains in contact with the skin.</P>
<P>Another advantage which flannel possesses over linen and cotton is, that people perspiring profusely in flannel shirts, may safely ven∣ture into the open air, and will not easily catch cold, because flannel does not absorb the per∣spired humours. If we do the same in linen shirts, the skin will soon be wetted by perspi∣ration, which will occasion a sensation of cool∣ness and shivering; in most cases a violent cold, and very frequently an inflammation of the lungs, will be the consequence. This dan∣ger arises from the fluid matter settling on the skin; and we may be still more severely injured, if we at the same time expose our∣selves to the action of the wind, or a current of air.</P>
<P>Numberless writers, both ancient and mod∣ern, confirm the good effects of flannel next the skin: of these I shall only quote COUNT RUMFORD, who says, in one of his earlier Es∣says, that he is convinced of the utility of flannel shirts in all seasons; that he has worn them in all climates, in the warmest apart∣ments, and in the most fatiguing exercise, without the least difficulty; that he was re∣lieved, by the use of flannel, from a pain in his breast he had been frequently subject to, and never since knew an hour's illness; and that nothing exceeds the agreeable sensation of this dress, when people have been once ac∣customed to it.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="039111_0249_1013A0B4658DB948"/>
Indeed after the praises bestowed upon flan∣nel, by so many respectable authorities, and by men who from long experience have as∣certained its beneficial effects, it is surprising that any individual, however great his repu∣tation, should be whimsical or hardy enough to dispute its <HI>general</HI> salubrity, merely with a view to establish a favourite hypothesis.</P>
<P>It has been objected, that flannel worn next the skin is debilitating, because it too much increases perspiration; but this is not found∣ed on truth, since perspiration, <HI>as long as the skin remains dry,</HI> never can be hurtful, nor im∣moderate. Such mistaken notions have been propagated, from the circumstance, that flan∣nel is frequently ordered by physicians, to in∣crease perspiration in some diseases, where it is necessary to the recovery of the patient: <HI>but the copious perspiration is then the effect of the disease, and not of the flannel.</HI></P>
<P>The uneasy sensation occasioned by flannel is of very short duration. That it may make the skin red and inflamed, if it be too much rubbed and scratched, cannot be denied; but it is a palpable falsity that it produces cutane∣ous eruptions. It has quite a contrary effect; as it preserves the pores open, increases per∣spiration, and thus removes the cause of cu∣taneous diseases, which arise chiefly from a checked and irregular state of excretion by the pores.</P>
<P>In answer to another objection against the wearing of flannel, it is certain, that a flannel shirt or waistcoat may preserve the body as
<PB N="220" REF="039111_0250_1013A07AB1197928"/>
clean, and much cleaner, than linen, <HI>if as fre∣quently changed.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This preliminary condition, I presume, sufficiently answers the objection of a learned writer, according to whom a flannel dress re∣quires a more frequent change than linen, <HI>to promote cleanliness,</HI> and consequently would produce a contrary effect among the lower class∣es of people. Yet, in other respects, I fully agree with the celebra∣ted HUFELAND, who lays down the following conditions and limita∣tions in what relates to the use of flannel:—"Upon the whole, says he, I am of opinion that it would not be advisable, at least to chil∣dren and young persons, <HI>universally</HI> to adopt a woollen texture for the covering of the skin. It is, however, a <HI>salutary</HI> dress to these who, in all probability, have commenced the second half of their life; to all cold or phlegmatic temperaments; to all who lead a sedentary life; to individuals subject to catarrhs, or frequent colds, gout, diar∣rhoea, and partial congestions of the blood; to all nervous patients and convalescents from severe chronic disorders; to persons who are too susceptible of the impressions of the atmosphere; and, lastly, in such climates and pursuits of life as are exposed to frequent and sud∣den changes of air.—It is, on the contrary, <HI>hurtful</HI> to all those, with∣out exception, who are already subject to violent perspiration, or troubled with cutaneous eruptions, and who cannot afford to change their under dress as often as is consistent with cleanliness."</P>
<P>Professor Hufeland, doubtless, meant to say that the wearing of flannel next the skin is <HI>then only hurtful,</HI> if none of the conditions be∣fore specified reconcile its use; for, even in cases apparently doubtful, the temporary wearing of flannel is not attended with such danger as might perhaps result from neglecting its application. But although it he obviously conducive to health, the Professor recommends only such a texture of wool, as is sufficiently porous, and neither too rough nor too thick. Coarse woollen stockings in winter, and thin ones in summer, ought in his opinion to be more generally worn. Those persons, lastly, who are in a good state of health, and have no partic∣ular reason for wearing flannel, or whose skin is too irritable, may find it, he thinks, beneficial to wear a cloth fabricated of a mixed tex∣ture of cotton and linen.</P>

<P>Wool, on account of its rough surface, is more calculated to absorb infectious morbid matter, than a more smooth substance; but we have nothing to apprehend from flannel on the skin, and under the usual dress. I am rather of opinion, that it is a better preven∣tive against contagion than any other; because, while it encourages perspiration, it at the same
<PB N="221" REF="039111_0251_1013A0B91876A260"/>
time removes the inhaled poisonous particles, particularly if, in cases of danger, perspiration be increased by other suitable means. Hence people wearing flannel on their skin, never suffer from cold. I have been informed, that the manufacturers in the different founderies of Birmingham, as well as at the iron-works of Colebrook-Dale and Kettley, in the most intense heat, wear no other but flannel shirts; and that without these it would be impossible to prevent continual colds, and the most fa∣tal diseases. With this beneficent intention, the British soldiers upon the Continent, some years ago, were furnished with flannel waist∣coats, by the liberal subscriptions of individu∣als, which, I am convinced, saved many lives that must otherwise have fallen victims to the effects of a cold and moist climate.</P>
<P>These advantages strongly recommend the use of flannel to every one anxious to preserve his health, but particularly to those who are exposed to all kinds of weather, as husband∣men, fishermen, mariners, soldiers, and trav∣ellers. As flannel is suitable to all seasons; as it requires no great changes in the under dress; and as it is a tolerable substitute for a defi∣ciency of upper dress; it deserves every atten∣tion among those who provide for orphan and poor-houses, as well as for the indigent of eve∣ry description. Many desperate diseases in the legs of the common people, many inflam∣mations of the throat, breast and lungs, might be prevented, and many lives saved, both of children and adults, if flannel were more gen∣erally worn.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="039111_0252_1013A07C35715DB0"/>
Those who complain of cold legs and feet, are never comfortable nor healthy; if they could be prevailed upon to wear worsted stockings and flannel drawers, they would acquire a quicker circulation of the blood in the lower extremities, and prevent many trou∣bles and indispositions, from which, without this precaution, they cannot escape. Most valetudinarians and patients slight this advice, because they imagine that the wearing of flan∣nel is attended with uneasy sensations. This idea, however, ought not to prevent them from giving it a fair trial; for the uncom∣fortable feeling continues only for a few days, as I have myself experienced; and this trifling sacrifice cannot be compared with the saluta∣ry effects, which flannel next the skin almost uniformly produces. By continuing it suffi∣ciently long, and changing it frequently, the most obstinate gouty and rheumatic com∣plaints have often been removed, and many other imminent dangers averted. Children afflicted with rickets, cannot be better reliev∣ed than by a proper diet, and flannel shirts, which may be daily fumigated with amber, petroleum, or other fragrant substances; a process, which has been frequently productive of the most beneficial effects.</P>

<HEAD>Of Stockings.</HEAD>
<P>COTTON stockings, which are so generally worn at present, are highly objectionable.—
<PB N="223" REF="039111_0253_1013A0BA9DDAFD78"/>
There is no part of the human frame, which perspires so much as the feet. The disagree∣able sensation cold feet produce is well known; for the connexion between the feet and head, the stomach, the uterus, and many other im∣portant parts of the human system, is so inti∣mate, that gout, suppression of the critical evacuations, pain in the excretory organs, nay cancer, inflammation of the uterus, and abortion, may be the consequence of cold feet and legs, which are the necessary effects of wearing cotton and silk stockings. Cotton and linen worn next the skin, if once filled with perspirable matter, do not admit any more to pass through them; a glutinous and cooling moisture accumulates, and it is not easy to keep the feet thoroughly clean in this dress. Those who alternately wear cotton and worsted stockings, must soon observe the difference in the exhalation and moisture pe∣culiar to each. Cotton, though somewhat better than linen, is still much inferior to wool, which is alone calculated to absorb and exhale the noxious humours emitted by the pores.</P>
<P>The reciprocal effect of the perspiration of the feet, and of the leather of the shoes, is greater than is commonly believed. Hence those, who wear cotton stockings, ought, from respect to cleanliness, as well as health, to change them according as their exercise increases perspiration.</P>
<P>Although the feet are the principal sources or conductors of exhalation from the body, little attention has been paid to them, with a
<PB N="224" REF="039111_0254_1013A07ED113C3E0"/>
view of promoting this salutary secretion. Instead of pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iting by this hint of nature, mankind have been imprudently and unac∣countably studious to stop that canal; imag∣ining this to be the safest way of preserving the feet dry, and free from all disagreeable smell. Dry feet are certainly preferable to moist: but the means of promoting perspira∣tion are also the only means capable of keep∣ing the feet dry, and free from any unpleas∣ant fetor. It is also improper and unhealthy to wear any other but woollen gloves, which ought to be worn by all females, who wish to improve the skin of their hands and arms; no cosmetics OF washes are so certain and so powerful in their effects: on the contrary, all external applications, unless assisted by inter∣nal remedies, are attended with the positive ruin of skin, bloom, and health.</P>
<P>Persons who have a great tendency to per∣spire in their feet, and who increase this ex∣udation by much walking or dancing, will no doubt be sensible, that their cotton, thread, or silk stockings, instead of removing the transpired matter, actually absorb it; bring it in contact with the skin; preserve it in a state of heat favourable to putrefaction; and check all farther perspiration.</P>
<P>That the feet are more exposed to the ef∣fects of cold, and to stagnations of the fluids, than any other part of the body, is unques∣tionable: 1st, because they are the most re∣mote parts from the heart, and the quickness of the circulation of the blood decreases in proportion to that distance; and 2d, the
<PB N="225" REF="039111_0255_1013A0BD2E477D08"/>
blood circulating downwards makes its way to the heart somewhat slower, on account of its own gravity. By this slowness in the cir∣culation, more watery particles are deposited by the blood. It is therefore necessary to keep the feet somewhat warmer than the rest of the body, in order to encourage the mo∣tion of the fluids to the upper parts. Wool∣len stockings are excellently adapted for that purpose, and they ought to be chosen rather thicker than those flannels used for shirts and drawers. For the same reason, it is proper to prevent all moisture from without, by means of water-proof shoes, provided with thick cork soles for the winter, or with elastic socks of horse-hair.</P>
<P>The most disagreeable sensation produced by the feet in perspiring, is between the toes: this can only be prevented by wearing stock∣ings made with toes, like the fingers of gloves; because these alone can absorb and prevent the viscid and fetid particles from fettling there. But as this proposal is not likely to meet with the approbation of the votaries of fashion, I shall substitute an easier method of remedying the unpleasant effects of violent perspiration in the feet. A powders of burnt alum will overcome this fetor, by neutraliz∣ing the acrid particles; and, at the same time, will not obstruct the necessary perspiration.</P>

<HEAD>Of Dress, as to its Form.</HEAD>
<P>ALL coverings of the head, of whatever kind, produce more mischief than benefit.
<PB N="226" REF="039111_0256_1013A08161FBD058"/>
The well known and excellent rule of keep∣ing the head cool and the feet warm, is too much neglected, especially by the lower classes of the people in many countries, as in Scot∣land, Holland, and Germany, and likewise among people of a certain age and description in this country. The Scotch peasant wears his heavy bonnet, the Dutchman his cap, and the Turk his turban, without considering that such heavy loads are stupifying, and that, while no attention is paid to keep their feet warm and dry, their heads are virtually con∣verted into vapor-baths. In all countries, the man who lives at his case, carefully covers his head with a warm night-cap; he spends per∣haps one half of the day in this unnatural dress, and prepares his head for frequent colds, at every sudden change in the atmosphere. Besides, weakness of the head, pains, erup∣tions, local plethora or fulness of blood, loss of the hair, lethargy, and at length stupor or insanity are often the effects of this impru∣dence.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For some years the ladies, instead of those horrid masses of friz∣zled hair, which used at once to injure their health, and disfigure their faces, happily returned to beautiful and elegant nature; having their hair hanging down in graceful ringlets, while the only artificial covering was a simple turban, or an ornamental bandeau. Of late, however, this tasteful style of decoration has been succeeded by un∣natural, disgusting, and unhealthful <HI>wigs;</HI> a fashion probably in∣troduced by some ugly and bald woman, to reduce her gay and beautiful imitators to her own standard of deformity.</NOTE></P>
<P>In our moderate climate, we might safely accustom our youth to go with the head un∣covered; as Nature has already provided it with hair for that purpose. In very cold and hot countries, however, the head must be
<PB N="227" REF="039111_0257_1013A0C0D836E9E0"/>
slightly covered, to shelter it from cold, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from the still more dangerous vertical rays of the sun.</P>
<P>It is an instance of improvement in the edu∣cation of children in England, that their ten∣der heads are not so much shut up in close caps, and fur bonnets, as those upon the Con∣tinent. A practice so injudicious and hurtful deserves no imitation; and yet there are ad∣vocates for <HI>warm</HI> night-caps and wigs; they would starve their feet, while the head is en∣closed in an artificial stove, which enfeebles their mental faculties, and diminishes their bodily vigour.</P>
<P>New-born children, and those who are most tender, require only an easy and moderately warm covering for the head, and this chiefly during the first weeks, on account of the soft∣ness of their cranium, then but imperfectly ossified. Yet such a cap should be loosely tied, that it may not press the head, nor cripple the muscles of the ears.</P>
<P>That the ear is naturally capable of some motion, is proved by the muscles with which it is provided. Its form, resembling a shell, is admirably adapted to receive and convey sound. In the vain conceit, that a projecting ear, so as the Author of nature has created it, is a deformity, nurses and overwise matrons endeavour to press the child's ear, from its first appearance, close to the head. Thus they render the shell of the ear immovable, and diminish the capacity of hearing. A properly-expanded ear not only strengthens the acute∣ness of hearing, but likewise preserves this
<PB N="228" REF="039111_0258_1013A0850C0A7560"/>
useful sense to a great age, when the muscles of the internal organs of hearing become re∣laxed.</P>
<P>To go with the head uncovered, in sunshine, is certainly improper, both for children and adults; but our common black hats are ill calculated to avert the mischief, as they do not reflect the heat, but rather concentrate it in the most sensible manner upon the head. Hats of a white, or any other light colour, made of straw or similar light materials, would be far preferable, particularly for peo∣ple labouring in the fields, soldiers, and trav∣ellers. In very hot weather, a piece of white paper may be fastened with advantage on the crown of the hat.</P>
<P>As the hat ought likewise to shelter the eyes from too vivid a light, the brim should be broad enough to protect them, and the in∣ner side of a green or blue, but not of a black, nor a dazzling colour. From the present mode, however, it appears that both ladies and gentlemen think a brim almost, if not al∣together unnecessary, even when the power of the sun is most oppressive.</P>
<P>Persons suffering from periodical head-achs, or whose heads are otherwise unhealthy, should have their hair cut short. By this petty sacrifice, they will promote the neces∣sary perspiration, the head will remain cool, and the cold bathing of it can be practised with more advantage. In this point of view, wigs cannot be <HI>altogether</HI> condemned, as long as hair-dressing, artificial braids, and other or∣naments, form an essential part of fashionable
<PB N="229" REF="039111_0259_1013A0C36CEB92A0"/>
dress. Besides, the wearers of wigs are, in a great measure, exempt from many inconve∣niences and evils attending the use of pow∣der and pomatum. Lastly, if we must choose one of the two maladies of the times, it is most rational to adopt the least noxious to health: and so far I think a <HI>light wig</HI> is justly preferable to a head enveloped in an artificial paste of powder and pomatum. Those, how∣ever, who are once accustomed to wear a wig, should not upon any account again let their hair grow in order to have it dressed, pasted, and powdered anew.</P>
<P>With respect to <HI>Shirts,</HI> the most proper sub∣stance having been before investigated, I shall only add, as to their form—that they may be seriously prejudicial to health, if too narrow in the collar, and in the wristbands. I have seen several instances of people attacked with shortness of breath and difficulty of speech, from this reason only, because the blood can∣not circulate freely, if the neck and wrists be tied or buttoned up too closely. I was once present where a young man, playing at rack∣ets, was suddenly seized with an apoplectic fit, the cause of which seemed at first inexplicable. As soon, however, as his shirt-collar, wrist∣bands and garters were loosened, he recov∣ered.</P>
<P>Neckcloths, cravats, ribands, and necklaces of all sorts, <HI>when they are too tight,</HI> stop the ac∣cess and retreat of the blood to and from the head, occasion accumulations of the blood and other fluids, head-achs, faintings, stu∣por, apoplexy, corrosive ulcers of the skin,
<PB N="230" REF="039111_0260_1013A086902A4288"/>
and innumerable other maladies. All cover∣ings of the neck ought therefore to be con∣stantly worn loose. People who are liable to sore throats, and diseases of the breast, might gradually accustom themselves, in mild and dry weather, to go with their necks as slightly covered as possible, and if fashion would per∣mit it, to have no other covering but the col∣lar of the shirt. In cold and moist weather, a thin handkerchief might be added. But the modern cravats, filled with a stiffening of cotton or wool, are extremely injurious to the part which they are intended to protect. For, by occasioning too great heat, they ren∣der the neck unnaturally sensible to every change of the atmosphere. It is rather sur∣prising, that from a due sense of their perni∣ciousness, we have rejected all coverings of the neck in children, as being troublesome and useless; and yet, in defiance of reason and experience, we continue to incumber our own necks with such bandages.</P>
<P>Necklaces and ribands, likewise, are gen∣erally tied so close, as to press with violence on that supposed deformity of the throat, vulgarly called the <HI>Adam's apple,</HI> which pro∣jects less in the female than in the male sex. These ribands and necklaces, when worn tight, are the more inconvenient and dangerous, if they be narrow and edged. Upon taking them off, which is too frequently neglected at night, they leave an impression on the neck, clearly proving the impediment they are to free muscular action, and what stagna∣tions, pain, and dangerous consequences they
<PB N="231" REF="039111_0261_1013A0C4F4F4A018"/>
may occasion. The neck and throat, being alternately expanded and contracted, in speak∣ing, chewing, and swallowing, it is the high∣est degree of imprudence to obstruct its mo∣tion, for the sake of appearance, vanity, or fashion.</P>
<P>Equally objectionable are those black stocks, that were formerly much in fashion, and are still worn by some old beaux and military men. The latter indeed deserve our compas∣sion, from being obliged to wear these uncom∣fortable collars; but the former ought to consider, that they expose themselves to dan∣gers, increasing as they advance in age, and rendering them every day more liable to ap∣oplexy. I knew a regiment of soldiers on the Continent, whose Colonel was so excessive∣ly fond of what he considered a martial ap∣pearance, that he caused his officers and men to have every article of their uniform remark∣ably tight, particularly the stocks, waistbands, and knee-garters. The consequence was, that in the course of a few months above the half of his regiment became subject to very obsti∣nate cutaneous diseases, and other obstruc∣tions, so that they were unable to perform duty. Other regiments in the vicinity also suffered from this destructive custom; but the proportion of their disabled soldiers was like one to ten in the former. The late Dr. FOTHERGIL asserts, that these tight stocks are productive of apoplexy, if a person look for some time, with his head turned, without moving his body. By this alone, he believes, people have brought on apoplectic symptoms.
<PB N="232" REF="039111_0262_10136E353084F988"/>
For such a turn of the neck, when the body stands fixed, diminishes the diameter of the jugular veins so much, that a proportionate quantity of blood cannot return to them, from the vessels of the head and the brain.</P>
<P>Neckcloths or cravats, loosely tied, and not too thick, are therefore the only proper ones for <HI>Men;</HI> but as to <HI>Women</HI> and <HI>Children,</HI> it cannot be disputed, that they would be bet∣ter without any.</P>
<P><HI>Laced Stays</HI> are, among the better ranks of society, at present out of fashion; since the Grecian form is justly preferred to all artifi∣cial shapes. Yet, when we have adopted an useful habit ourselves, it is our duty to rec∣ommend it to those also who are still follow∣ing a destructive practice. And with this in∣tention I cannot but reluctantly observe, that nine tenths of the community still wear these oppressive <HI>strait jackets,</HI> merely because their mothers and grandmothers have done the same. I shall therefore briefly state a few of the consequences, arising from this unnatural part of female dress, namely, diseases of the breast, external callosities, and cancer itself; the ribs are comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ed; the spine is bent out of its place; the free expansion of the lungs is prevented; hence shortness of breath, in∣durations and tubercles of the lungs, cramp of the stomach, defective digestion, nausea, irregularities in the secretory and other or∣gans, and the like: in short, the list of the maladies thus produced is too long to be here detailed; and both married and unmarried ladies, for the sake of compassion, should ex∣ert
<PB N="233" REF="039111_0263_1013A0C78498AA90"/>
all their influence, to convince the com∣mon people of the injuries occasioned by stiff laced stays. If any such part of dress be at all admissible, it ought to consist of soft and pli∣able materials, such as fine chamois leather, hatter's felt, or, what is still better, the knit∣ted and more elastic texture used for gloves and stockings.</P>
<P>All that has been said, with regard to laced stays, is also applicable to small waists, and tight coverings of the breast and the abdo∣men.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fashion delights in extremes. No sooner had the fair sex aban∣doned the unnatural and unhealthful custom of long taper waists, than they in a manner concealed the waist altogether. Instead of the cincture round the middle of the body, as nature and taste di∣rected, they bound themselves over the breasts,—a custom not less preposterous than injurious to health.</NOTE></P>
<P>Narrow sleeves in gowns and coats, tight wristbands in shirts, and bracelets, occasion a swelling of the veins on the back of the hand, rigidity, weakness of nerves, and incapac∣ity of bending the arm. If the arms be in this manner twisted from infancy, their growth and formation are impeded; and it is probably owing to this cause, that we see so many persons with short, thin, and ill-formed arms.</P>
<P>Women suffer much more by this bandage than men, whose arms possess more muscular strength, and have not the interstices of the muscles filled with fat, like the former. In this respect, the modern fashion of tying the sleeves of ladies' gowns close to the elbow, de∣serves particular censure; as the circulation of the blood, together with the motion of the

arms, is thus obstructed, and many disagreea∣ble consequences wantonly induced. Farther, the female arm is naturally somewhat fuller from the shoulder downwards, and again be∣comes smaller towards the joints of the hand: but in man, it is always more muscular a lit∣tle below the elbow. From this difference in the structure, it is obvious, that the sleeves in a female dress lie close to the whole arm, while those of a man's coat but partially at∣tach to it.</P>
<P>Many of the remarks already suggested, respecting the form and substance of other parts of dress, are likewise applicable to the article of <HI>breeches.</HI> If these be made of im∣proper materials, or too tight in the waist∣band, they must occasion both uneasiness and injury to the body. Yet the ingenious ob∣servations, lately published on this subject by Dr. FAUST, an eminent physician in Germa∣ny, are by no means so conclusive, as to in∣duce us to abandon an article of dress, not on∣ly rendered necessary by the laws of decorum, but which, when properly constructed, is even of considerable service; inasmuch as breeches, by their moderate pressure, tend to strengthen the relaxed parts of the body, particularly at a tender age.</P>
<P>The most proper form of this vestment is, upon the whole, that of <HI>pantaloons;</HI> but they ought to be sufficiently wide, of a thin cool∣ing substance in summer, and of a warm elastic woollen cloth in winter. Tight and contracting leather breeches, purposely con∣trived to display an elegant shape of the limbs,
<PB N="235" REF="039111_0265_1013A0CB28407950"/>
are extremely inconvenient, occasion numb∣ness and chilliness all over the hip and thigh, and a painful pressure of the <HI>pudenda.</HI> Leath∣er is also an improper substance for this part of dress; as, on account of its close texture, it is apt to check insensible perspiration. If the waistband be too strait, the free mo∣tion of the internal parts of the abdomen will be obstructed, the absorbent vessels of the in∣testines prevented from performing their of∣fices, and hypochondriacal complaints be easily induced. This inconvenience may be entire∣ly avoided, by the use of <HI>braces,</HI> now almost generally adopted, and which, as they render a tight cincture altogether unnecessary, can∣not be too much recommended, both to men and women, for the sake of health as well as comfort.</P>
<P>There are many reasons, which delicacy for∣bids me to mention, why it would be highly beneficial to the physical and moral condition of females, to wear some kind of drawers, at least after a certain age. This additional piece of dress would effectually prevent several in∣conveniencies to which women are subject.—There are other circumstances attending their usual dress, which contribute to bring on a premature sexual impulse, and are apt to in∣duce them to habits equally irregular and in∣jurious to health. This hint cannot be mis∣understood by judicious mothers, and, it is humbly presumed, will not be totally disre∣garded;—especially as young females but too readily accustom themselves to sit in an im∣proper posture.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="039111_0266_1013A08CEDC8FA50"/>
Concerning the clothing of the legs, I must in the first place censure the use of tight <HI>garters,</HI> particularly in men, to whom they are altogether unnecessary. Whether females can do without them, is scarcely fair to ques∣tion: but if any substitute or contrivance can be adopted in their place, it will amply com∣pensate any little trouble or inconvenience: the stockings can easily be tied to some tape fastened to the waistband. This apparently trifling improvement is of greater moment, than many are inclined to imagine; for garters are undoubtedly the cause of much mischief, whether tied below or above the knee. The part to which they are applied, acquires an unnatural hardness; they dispose the thighs and legs to dropsy, induce great fatigue in walking, and are very probably the cause, that certain persons so frequently stum∣ble, fall, and dislocate or break the knee-pan. The great difference in walking, with and without garters, I have myself sufficiently ex∣perienced. Many years ago, when in com∣pliance with early habits and prejudices, I was accustomed to the use of garters, I could not walk or ride half a dozen miles without fa∣tigue; which inconvenience I found immedi∣ately remedied, on abandoning those improp∣er ligaments.</P>
<P>The advantages of woollen <HI>stockings</HI> have been already pointed out. Upper stockings of silk, cotton or linen, will be no impediment; and they may be chosen of thicker or thinner quality, according to the weather and season. But the best stockings may become hurtful, if
<PB N="237" REF="039111_0267_1013A0CDC66350A0"/>
too short in the feet, and may bring on a spasmodic rigidity, and distortion of the toes. If, on the other hand, the feet of the stockings are too wide, so that they make folds in the shoes, they will injure the skin by their fric∣tion, and be attended with painful consequen∣ces. The stockings of children ought neither to cover the knees, nor be tied in any other manner, than by fastening them with strings to the waistband; otherwise they will increase the size of the knees, render them preternat∣urally thick, and may produce white swell∣ings, and other dangerous maladies.</P>
<P>Boots, if too tight, and made of thick leather, are so injurious to health, and so troublesome in walking, that no reasonable being will be inclined to force his feet and legs into them. The consequences of a prac∣tice, as hurtful as it is injudicious, are obvi∣ous from the preceding observations.</P>
<P>The constant use of boots contracts the size of the legs, particularly the calves, as may be daily observed in military men, and the fash∣ionable loungers of Bond-street and Pall-Mall.</P>
<P>I now proceed to the last, but not the least important part of our dress, namely, <HI>Shoes.</HI> The celebrated Dutch anatomist, CAMPER, did not consider this subject unworthy of his attention, as he published a particular work, "<HI>On the proper Form and Size of Shoes,</HI>" as late as the year 1781. The shoes ought to be of the size of the foot; they should be also ac∣commodated to the degree of motion or exer∣cise, and to the nature of the soil and place, in which we wear them; circumstances that
<PB N="238" REF="039111_0268_1013A08F85AF4E98"/>
are at present too little attended to. A shoe that is bigger than the foot, prevents a firm step; while one which is too narrow occa∣sions pain and troublesome corns. Many volumes have been written on the Art of Shoeing that noble and useful animal, the Horse:—it is considered as a fundamental rule in Farriery, that the shoe must be nei∣ther smaller nor larger than the hoof; and yet mankind can submit to screw their feet into a narrower compass than is intended by Nature. How frequently do we smile at the Chinese, who, from a tyrannical custom, squeeze and compress their feet, that they may remain small and crippled. Yet these feeble Orientals proceed more rationally in this practice, than their European rivals. <HI>They</HI> begin with it gradually, and from the earliest infancy. <HI>We</HI> do not think of con∣tracting the feet of our children, till they have almost attained the natural size, and thus en∣deavour to counteract the progress of Nature, when it is too late to do it with impunity. Who then are the greater slaves of fashion, the Chin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se, or their enlightened antipodes?—It is pitiable to see the young and old, of both sexes, advancing into an assembly or ball-room, with the most painful sensations. Without consulting Lavater's Physiognomy, it is easy to discover, by their distorted features and compressed lips, what many whimsical persons suffer from too tight, or, what is still worse, from short shoes. Our knees would be more flexible, and our toes more pliable, more use∣ful, and better adapted to perform the various
<PB N="239" REF="039111_0269_1013A0CF4BD2FE28"/>
motions of the feet, if they were not contin∣ually pressed and palsied by this improper <HI>case∣work.</HI> Nature has designed the toes to be as moveable as the fingers. Those unfortunate beings, who are born without hands, learn to perform with the toes the most astonishing tasks, to write and cut pens, to sew, to draw; in short, to supply almost completely the want of their hands.</P>
<P>Our feet, no doubt, would be more com∣fortable, easy, and useful, if we were not at the greatest pains to deprive, them of their elasticity and vigour. The numerous nerves, crossing the feet in every direction, plainly evince that Nature has endowed them with peculiar powers, of which we can scarcely form an adequate conception. The untutor∣ed Indian, or the wild African, excels not only the enlightened European, but likewise the lower animals, in running, leaping, and, in short, in swiftness and agility of every kind, where muscular motion is required. Either of them would heartily laugh at us, when we are obliged to employ professional operators for extracting corns, and to contrive oint∣ments and plasters for the cure of those evils, which we have wantonly brought on our∣selves.</P>
<P>The judicious BUCHAN says: "Almost nine tenths of mankind are troubled with corns; a disease that is seldom or never occa∣sioned but by strait shoes;" and I presume to add, that the remaining tenth part do not envy their fellow-creatures for this modern improvement. Our ancestors, even within
<PB N="240" REF="039111_0270_1013A0910B9DB1A0"/>
my memory, wore their shoes with broad toes, which showed at once their good sense, and due attention to health and comfort. He who is regardless of the pain and trouble oc∣casioned by warts, excrescences, and callosities of various forms; he who wishes to convert his feet and toes into so many barometers, to indicate the present state, and to foretel the fu∣ture changes of the weather, will ever agree with his shoemaker, to save as much leather as possible; and he is scarcely to be pitied for his imprudence. Such a person will not un∣frequently be disappointed in his excursions, when his crippled feet require temporary rest. I am further persuaded, that such cessations of exercise are extremely detrimental to health in general, and that they may be registered among the predisposing causes of the gout, rheumatism, and dropsy. Many people are thus almost deprived of the use of their legs; and the pain of the more virulent species of corns, as well as of the nails, when grown in∣to the flesh, is excruciating.</P>
<P>For these obvious reasons, the soles of the shoes ought to be sufficiently broad, especially under the toes, where we are accustomed to see them so pointed, that they appear to be intended for weapons of attack or defence. If, for instance, the greatest breadth of the foot be four inches, the shoe should not be three and a half, but rather four and a half inches broad, since the bulk of the foot, and the seam of the leather, require an allowance of half an inch. The soles also ought not to be bent hollow, as is frequently done in wo∣men's
<PB N="241" REF="039111_0271_1013A0D0CFB85290"/>
shoes; for since the foot is not so con∣structed as to present a spherical surface, it is improper to deprive it of that firm hold, which Nature has given it by a nearly flat form. The foot must necessarily suffer from this ill-contrived shape, which deprives it of its flexion, occasions difficulty in walking, and renders every step unpleasant and unsafe.</P>
<P>In the same manner as some persons strange∣ly endeavour to diminish the breadth of the foot, others are equally dissatisfied with its length. Hence we see them make use of an instrument, to force their feet into shoes per∣haps an inch shorter than is requisite for an easy motion. This custom is the most de∣structive of any, and, though not much prac∣tised at present, since a long and narrow pointed shoe is the most fashionable, yet the inconvenience and danger is not thereby re∣moved. Instead of bending the toes with their nails inwards, as was formerly the case with short shoes, we now squeeze them to∣gether, and often lay them crossways over one another, so as to carry them about with∣out motion, like a mere insensible mass of matter. Upon striking the foot against a stone, we feel the punishment due to such outrage. Shoes of this kind may be aptly compared to the wooden boxes worn by the Dutch and French peasants, from necessity, in wet seasons, and which admit of quite as much motion as the long and sharp pointed machines, in which our beaux and belles cramp their feed from choice.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="039111_0272_1013A093983386B0"/>
A convenient shoe, therefore, ought to be somewhat round at the toes, sufficiently long, with thick soles, and the upper leather soft and pliable. If it be deficient in any of these requisites, the skin will be rendered callous; the perspiration indispensable to these parts will be stopped; warts and corns will appear in numbers; the nails will grow into the flesh, and various complicated maladies be produced, which not only affect the feet, but the whole body. Beside these more serious consequences, a person walking with narrow shoes will be much sooner and more sensibly fatigued, than he whose shoes are sufficiently wide and easy.</P>
<P>The poor, as well as country people, who wear shoes sufficiently large, have not only a much safer step, but their feet are less subject to the multiplicity of complaints, with which ours are annoyed. Those who, either from inclination or frugality, go barefooted in summer, have not even to plead the reason of the Ancients, who considered it as a mark of chastity; and I cannot help remarking, that it is both indecorous and unwholesome, as well as an injudicious species of economy. The shoe, in our climate and mode of life, is a necessary defence against many accidental in∣juries, to which the foot is liable; and it is likewise a crime against decency, to expose any part of the human body to dust and mire.</P>
<P>With respect to the <HI>substance</HI> of which shoes should be made, no other general rule can be given, than that it ought to be sufficiently com∣pact,
<PB N="243" REF="039111_0273_1013A0D4887901A0"/>
to prevent the water from penetrating it; so elastic and soft, as to admit an easy motion of the whole foot; and accommodated to the weather, exercise, and soil in which it is used. To those who have not the means or opportu∣nity of procuring the patent water-proof leath∣er, I shall suggest a method of preparing this species of leather, at a very small expense. One pint of <HI>drying oil,</HI> two ounces of <HI>yellow wax,</HI> two ounces of <HI>spirit of turpentine,</HI> and one ounce of <HI>Burgundy-pitch,</HI> are to be carefully melted together, over a slow fire. Those to whom the smell of pitch and turpentine is un∣pleasant, may add a few drachms of some cheap essential oil, as of <HI>lavender, thyme,</HI> and the like. With this composition new shoes or boots are rubbed, either in the sun, or at some distance from a fire, with a sponge or soft brush: this operation is to be repeated as often as they become dry again, until they be fully saturated. In this manner, the leather at length becomes impervious to wet; the shoes or boots made of it last much longer than those made of common leather, acquire such softness and pliability, that they never shrivel nor grow hard and inflexible, and, thus prepared, are the most effectual preservatives against cold and chilblains.</P>
<P>To conclude, I shall only remark, that it is not advisable to change the shoes from one foot to the other. Let us rather tread one of the shoes somewhat crooked, than injure our feet and health, by an adherence to a cus∣tom, which has nothing but custom to recom∣mend it. If it be our serious wish to avoid
<PB N="244" REF="039111_0274_1013A0975170FB28"/>
corns and other painful accidents, to which the rage of fashion subjects the feet of its vo∣taries, we should persuade the shoe-makers to provide us with a particular shoe for each foot; and this can be done only by keeping <HI>separate double lasts,</HI> for every wearer. Is it not in∣judicious and absurd, to have both shoes made of the same size and form, when Nature has not formed both feet alike, or at least not in the same direction?</P>
<P>It gives me great satisfaction to add, that since the first edition of these Lectures was published, the rational practice of having sep∣arate shoes purposely made for each foot, has already been adopted among the more en∣lightened classes of society. From a full con∣viction of its great utility, I sincerely wish that it may soon become universal!</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of EXERCISE and REST; their occasional advan∣tages and disadvatages explained; their manner and limits ascertained; together with directions for regulating both.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MOTION, or bodily exercise, is necessary to the preservation of health, which is thereby promoted, while the bounds of mod∣eration are not exceeded. Too violent exer∣cise, and a total want of it, are attended with equal disadvantages. Much also depends on the kind of motion, and the various postures of the body.</P>
<P>The essential advantages of exercise are the following: bodily strength is increased; the circulation of the blood and all other fluids promoted; the necessary secretions and ex∣cretions are duly performed; the whole mass of the blood is cleared and refined, so that it cannot stagnate in the minutest capillary ves∣sels; and if any obstruction should begin to take place, it will be effectually relieved.</P>
<P>That exercise is enjoined by nature, we may learn from the whole structure of the human body, from the number of muscles formed for motion, and from the mechanism in the circulation of the blood itself. There are, indeed, no healthier people than those who have continual strong exercise. Man in a state of health is instinctively induced to muscular exertion; and children that are per∣fectly
<PB N="246" REF="039111_0276_1013A098D7513918"/>
healthy are constantly running about, and in almost uninterrupted motion.</P>
<P>But if exercise, either by its violence, or too long duration, exceed the proper limits, it nat∣urally quickens both respiration and the circu∣lation of the blood, which may occasion the bursting of small blood-vessels, miscarriages, in∣flammations, and collections of blood towards certain parts of the body, such as the heart and the brain. The saline acrimony of the fluids is thus more disengaged; the fat is dis∣solved; and inflammatory fevers, hemorrha∣ges, and palsies, may be the consequences.</P>
<P>Violent exercise is particularly hurtful to those who are unaccustomed to it, or who have committed excesses in drinking, and, what is still worse, in eating more than is nec∣essary: and those whose bodies have not been sufficiently nourished by food and drink, may also be injured by too much exercise.</P>
<P>The sudden transition from a state of rest, to violent action, is likewise hurtful, and still more so in hot than in cold weather. After strong emotions of the mind, every species of bodily exercise ought to be avoided, till the tranquillity of mind return with the rest of the body; yet we ought to guard against the effects of cold, as it may prove extremely prejudicial in such a state.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="039111_0277_1013A0D9C10A7EA8"/>
WITH respect to the manner of taking ex∣ercise, three principal points are to be attend∣ed to:</P>
<P N="1">1. As to the <HI>kind</HI> of exercise,—the various species of which may be aptly divided into <HI>active</HI> and <HI>passive.</HI> The active are of a very diversified nature; <HI>walking, running, leaping, swimming, riding, fencing,</HI> the <HI>military exercise,</HI> different sorts of <HI>athletic games,</HI> as well as every other kind that requires muscular exertion.—<HI>Passive</HI> exercise comprises <HI>riding</HI> in a carriage, <HI>sailing, friction, swinging,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The more active species of exercise are ben∣eficial to youth, to those of a middle age, to the robust in general, and particularly to the corpulent, the plethoric, and those whose evacuations are not in due proportion to their supplies. The passive kinds of exercise, on the contrary, are better suited to infants, to old, dry, and emaciated persons, to the deli∣cate and debilitated, and particularly to the asthmatic and consumptive.</P>
<P N="2">2. As to the <HI>time</HI> in which exercise is most proper to be taken—this depends on so great a variety of concurrent circumstances, that the rules by which it may be regulated, can∣not be universal, and must therefore be col∣lected from the preceding observations on the properties and effects of Air, Food, Drink, and so forth. Other particulars, such as re∣late to greater or less degrees of fatigue attend∣ing the different species of exercise, and the utility of it, in certain states of the mind and body, must determine this, as well as</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="248" REF="039111_0278_1013A09C6F190990"/>
3. The <HI>duration</HI> of it;—for it is almost impossible to lay down positive rules, how long every individual, in every particular sit∣uation, may continue a certain species of ex∣ercise, so as to derive advantage. These rules, as far as they can be established, may be col∣lected from the subsequent remarks, and then applied to the particular kinds of exercise, by which we may be benefited in different cases and situations.</P>
<P>It is necessary first to observe, that any kind of exercise which we are accustomed to take, with a view to brace the body, is far prefera∣ble to an unusual one, which may be attended with a contrary effect. We ought always to begin gently, and to finish gradually, never abruptly. Exercise in the open air has great advantages over that in houses and close apart∣ments. Besides, strong bodily exertions, such as dancing, fencing, turning, and the like, if practised in small and confined places, on ac∣count of the increased perspiration, soon vi∣tiate the air, and render it unfit for breathing.</P>
<P>If we take exercise for the sake of health, we ought to employ ourselves during that time with some agreeable object, and not per∣form any labour nor seriously occupy the mind. Hence certain kinds of exercise cannot be un∣conditionally recommended to every individ∣ual, as means conducive to health; though they should of themselves be proper, and in other respects agree with the constitu∣tion. He who forces himself to any exercise, or performs it with reluctance, will thence de∣rive more injury than benefit: motions or
<PB N="249" REF="039111_0279_1013A0DC564A5C20"/>
tasks, therefore, which we impose upon our∣selves, as recreations after work, or after sit∣ting and long thinking, ought to be strictly relaxations, not toilsome exertions.</P>
<P>Persons of an active mind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind a species of relaxation, and even satisfaction, in a change of their pursuits, and particularly in the tran∣sition from hard and difficult, to more pleas∣ant and easy avocations. To such individu∣als any exercise is frequently of great advan∣tage, especially if it answer, or appear to them to be conducive to any useful purpose. To one who has habituated himself to grave and serious pursuits, it should not be recommend∣ed to join in amusements requiring bodily ex∣ertion, and attended with dissatisfaction and irksomeness; for his health will not be im∣proved by exercise, at once unusual and un∣pleasant.</P>
<P>To continue exercise until a profuse perspi∣ration, or a great lassitude, take place, cannot be wholesome. In the forenoon, when the stomach is empty, or at least, not too much distended, muscular motion is both most agree∣able and healthful; it stregthens digestion, and heats the body less than with a full stom∣ach. A good appetite after it, is a proof that it has not been carried to excess. But it is not advisable to take violent exercise imme∣diately before a meal; as this might occa∣sion a deficiency of those humours, which are necessary to promote digestion. If we sit down to a substantial dinner or supper, imme∣diately after a fatiguing walk, when the blood is heated, and the body is in a state of perspi∣ration,
<PB N="250" REF="039111_0280_1013A09F0B78FB30"/>
the worst consequences may ensue, es∣pecially if we begin with the most cooling dishes, or with salad, or a glass of cold drink.</P>
<P>Exercise is likewise hurtful directly after meals; since it obstructs digestion, and pro∣pels those fluids too much to the surface of the body, which are designed for the stom∣ach, to promote the solution of food, and without which many crude and undigested particles are forced to enter, and to mix with the blood. The old rule of the <HI>Salernitan School, "Post coenam stabis, seu passus mille mea∣bis,"</HI> (i. e. after supper stand, or walk a mile) is as frivolous as it is absurd; for experience sufficiently informs us, that most persons, par∣ticularly the nervous and irritable, are liable to the heartburn, eructations, and even vom∣iting, when they are obliged to move about or to take any exercise immediately after meals. The instinct of the lower animals al∣so contradicts this rule; because the wildest creatures are inclined to rest after food.</P>
<P>Persons who are under the necessity of mov∣ing immediately after their meals, or who have no other spare time for walking, must endeavour to overcome these inconveniencies by custom, and a more rigid temperance: they should first take the most gentle kind of exercise, and gradually increase it; and, as the late hours of dining, now so generally in fashion, have in a manner abolished heavy suppers, a moderate walk after a slight even∣ing's repast cannot be injurious. But at all events, fatiguing exercise, after a full meal, should be delayed till the stomach has digest∣ed
<PB N="251" REF="039111_0281_1013A0DF2705AB78"/>
and assimilated the food, which generally takes place in the third or fourth hour after eating. The most proper occupations after dinner, are such as can be performed without trouble, or great efforts of reflection and bod∣ily exertion, and such as afford a kind of amusement.</P>
<P><HI>Walking,</HI> the most salutary and natural ex∣ercise, is in the power of every body; and we can adapt its degree and duration to the various circumstances of health. By this ex∣ercise, the appetite and perspiration are pro∣moted; the body is kept in a proper temper∣ament; the mind is enlivened; the motion of the lungs is facilitated; and the rigidity and contraction of the legs, arising from too much fitting, is relieved. The most obstinate diseases, and the most troublesome hysteric and hypochondriacal complaints, have been frequently cured by perseverance in walking.</P>
<P>The most proper walk for health, is in an agreeable country, in a healthy, pure, dry air, amidst social and cheerful conversations, in a mild sunshiny day, whether in spring, autumn or winter; in the summer mornings and af∣ternoons, but by no means in the oppressive heat of the sun. To walk in towns, although it gives exercise, is less conducive to health; because the atmosphere is generally filled with vapours arising from impure exhalations.</P>
<P>Those who are not hardened against the vi∣cissitudes of the weather, must avoid not on∣ly hail and rain, but also the cold mornings and evenings, and ought, therefore, in rough and moist cold weather, rather to take exercise
<PB N="252" REF="039111_0282_1013A0A0942F53F0"/>
within the house, but without preventing the access of air. Violent wind should also be avoided; and if we are obliged to face it, we ought not to walk too fast, particularly in winter, when the small pores of the skin are compressed by the air.</P>
<P>In walking, the proper choice of places is a matter of much importance. Marshy and damp fields should be avoided; and in au∣tumn, when the foliage is decaying, it is not advisable to choose woods, groves, and damp meadows, for our pleasure-walks. In sum∣mer, on the contrary, a walk in the forests or meadows is both agreeable and healthful. Hills and elevated situations deserve particu∣larly to be visited, not only on account of the purer air we breathe, but also of the body en∣joying a variety of exercise, in ascending and descending.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of towns require longer walks for the preservation of their health than country people. The latter, even with less exercise, derive vigour of body and serenity of mind, from a purer air, and more simple manners. Regular and daily walking, there∣fore, cannot be too much recommended to the citizen, who in the present age is so much harassed with nervous and hypochondriacal complaints; but, though this be an useful and excellent species of exercise, yet some rules ought to be observed, if we expect to derive from it the wished-for advantages.</P>
<P N="1">1. We should contrive to procure as much pleasure and recreation after serious occupa∣tions,
<PB N="253" REF="039111_0283_1013A0E2F33D9978"/>
as is possible and consistent with our sit∣uation in life.</P>
<P N="2">2. To read during a walk, whether the subject be of a grave or amusing nature, is a custom improper in itself, and detrimental to the eyes, besides the danger it occasions of falling: this practice not only deprives a per∣son of the principal advantages of a walk, but people easily accustom themselves to an unsafe and ungraceful manner of carrying the body. It is attended with the worst consequences to the eyes, because the focus is continually shift∣ed, and the retina is thus excessively fatigued.</P>
<P N="3">3. We should not frequent the same, per∣haps often a dull and unvaried walk, though most convenient. It is better to change the walk occasionally, and gradually to extend the distance. The most agreeable prospects should be chosen for variety; otherwise the perpet∣ually uniform walk will excite melancholy and unpleasant sensations, as much as the closet or the study.</P>
<P N="4">4. We ought to accustom ourselves to a steady and regular, but not a quick pace.</P>
<P N="5">5. An agreeable companion contributes much to serenity of mind: but let us rather go alone, than in dull or frivolous compa∣ny, if we at all possess the art of profiting by solitude.</P>
<P N="6">6. In the choice of our companions, we should attend not only to congeniality of character and taste, but should also, in this exercise, associate with those whose pace ac∣cords with ours; for if the heavy and corpu∣lent man make a lean and light-footed person
<PB N="254" REF="039111_0284_1013A0A4299222B8"/>
the companion of his walks, he will remain behind, or be overheated and fatigued, if he endeavour to keep pace with his partner, who must likewise suffer from the constraint of slower motion.</P>
<P N="7">7. Some people cannot speak or converse in walking, without frequent stops, and thus make little progress. From this singularity, they are generally much fatigued at their re∣turn, without having reaped any benefit from their exercise.</P>
<P><HI>Running</HI> not only shakes the body with greater violence than walking, but it heats the head and face, and too much quickens the circulation of the fluids. Soon after a meal, it prevents digestion, mixes the pure fluids with the impure, and obstructs the secretion of humours. If long continued, it is hurtful to every one, particularly to those unaccus∣tomed to it, to the plethoric, to those subject to hemorrhages, gravelly complaints, and fre∣quent nervous head-ach, and to sedentary per∣sons employed in mental labour. To run up a hill, too much fatigues and strains the mus∣cles; and to run against the wind, produces giddiness in the most robust, and makes them liable to various accidents, that may be at∣tended with danger.</P>
<P><HI>Dancing,</HI> considered in itself, and under proper limitations, is an admirable exercise, especially in winter, when the heavy atmos∣phere, much rest, and sitting, render the blood thick, and dispose persons to hypochondriasis. Moderate dances have every advantage of a gentle exercise, besides the beneficial effects
<PB N="255" REF="039111_0285_10136E2C13C62DF8"/>
produced on the mind by cheerful company and music. On the other hand, the more vi∣olent dances may be, and frequently are, at∣tended with the most pernicious effects. The exertion of so many muscles, the quick in∣spiration of a warm atmosphere in a crowded assembly, impel the blood to circulate with a rapidity equal to that in the hot stage of a fe∣ver, and propel it to the head and breast, so that the vessels seldom possess a sufficient pow∣er of resistance. If we add to this, the effect of heating liquors, of too sudden an access of the cold air, so eagerly, courted, of exposing the face, head and breast, suddenly to its in∣fluence, together with the imprudent use of cooling drink, and ice itself, we can no longer be surprised, that spitting of blood, consump∣tion of the lungs, and inflammatory disor∣ders, are the frequent consequences of such excesses.</P>
<P>This violent species of exercise is particu∣larly dangerous to females; and the use of fans, in order to cool themselves, and thus check perspiration, (which is wisely designed by nature to produce the same effect, in a more salutary degree, if not wantonly repel∣led) is extremely imprudent. Delicate per∣sons ought, for their own sakes, to join in no other but the shorter and less fatiguing dances, especially in summer.</P>
<P>A dancing-room ought to be cool, but without admitting currents of air, and with∣out too much smoke from candles. It would be advisable for the whole company, after dancing is over, and before they venture into
<PB N="256" REF="039111_0286_1013A0A5AFC86430"/>
the open air, to change their linen, and after∣wards to wait a quarter or half an hour be∣fore they return home. During that time, they may be refreshed by tea, and thus en∣counter the open air without danger. Every dancing assembly ought to conclude with min∣uets. Persons of an indisposed and debili∣tated body, such as the consumptive, those troubled with ruptures, gravelly and similar complaints, should not attempt to dance. Lastly, this exercise is hurtful to every person in the hot and sultry days of summer, when nature renders cooling drink indispensable, and when we are much inclined to perspire, without any additional inducement.</P>
<P><HI>Riding in carriages</HI> is an exercise the more conducive to health, that the gentle jolts tend to resolve stagnations in the intestines of hy∣pochondriacs, corpulent people, convalescents, and the consumptive. But, if the motion of the carriage be too rapid, it is hurtful, as it not only accelerates perspiration before the matter of it is properly prepared, but also in∣jures the solid parts, especially the kidneys, generates congestions of the blood towards the head, and consequently head-ach, giddiness, vomiting, and obstructions. If, however, we wish to derive all the good effects from riding in a carriage, the body of it ought not to be too nicely suspended in straps and springs, nor should the motion be too slow. One of the windows, at least, ought to be kept open, that the perspiration and breath of several persons, inclosed in so narrow a place, may not too much vitiate the air.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="039111_0287_1013A0E70D5698B8"/>
The infirm, who cannot enjoy the free air in bad weather, should take exercise upon rocking horses, or similar contrivances, in halls and spacious apartments, while the upper part of the windows is kept open, guarding, how∣ever, against a current of air. Lastly, the fu∣rious driving in open carriages, in sultry weather, may be indeed pleasant, on account of the agreeable current of air; but it may also become dangerous to persons subject to violent perspiration.</P>
<P><HI>Leaping, fencing,</HI> the fashionable <HI>military ex∣ercise,</HI> and <HI>manoeuvring with horses,</HI> are violent kinds of exercise, which cannot be recom∣mended to those who are not in a perfect state of health, or to the corpulent and ple∣thoric, whose blood-vessels may be so over∣strained as to burst, by motions which require the muscular exertion of the whole body.</P>
<P>To those who are otherwise healthy, but cannot afford to take sufficient exercise, either by their particular situation in life, or from want of time, I would recommend a <HI>new</HI> spe∣cies, which; in its salutary effects <HI>on the whole body,</HI> is equal if not superior to any other. It simply consists in moving the whole body, in the middle of a room, (and, if convenient, with open windows) and let the operator, while he inclines forward upon his toes, raise his arms, and drop them with the alternate motion backward on his heels. Thus the <HI>whole</HI> muscular system will be duly exercised, without confining the motion to one partic∣ular part. This is even preferable to the <HI>dumb-bells,</HI> which, like every other species of
<PB N="258" REF="039111_0288_1013A0A84BDB1090"/>
<HI>partial</HI> exercise, if persevered in, are so far ob∣jectionable, as they require the uncommon exertion of certain muscles, while the due and uniform circulation of the blood to those parts is disturbed, to the detriment of others which are at rest.</P>
<P>To persons who are deprived of the use of their limbs, and are weak and delicate, the motion of a sedan chair is of great benefit, if it be continued for a sufficient time; for it disposes the body to a free perspiration. Of the same nature is the failing in barges or boats, either on lakes or rivers.</P>
<P>A much more active kind of bodily mo∣tion is produced by short voyages at sea. Those who are unaccustomed to it, generally experience giddiness of the head, nausea, and vomiting: hence it is beneficial to an impure stomach. To consumptive patients it fre∣quently is the last resource; but it is wrong to delay it, till all other remedies have failed. For it is not in the last stage of consumption, when the lungs are already ulcerated, or when an abscess has already burst in the thorax, and the ichorous matter has been communicated to the blood, that we can expect any benefit from voyages. The changes of scene and climate, indeed, powerfully co-operate in ef∣fecting changes in the human system; but, if the disease has preyed too much on the vitals of a patient, or if he is spitting blood, the motion of the vessel must necessarily prove injurious. On the other hand, the debilitat∣ed, the nervous, and particularly the hypo∣chondriac,
<PB N="259" REF="039111_0289_1013A0EAB6C2AD40"/>
cannot resort to a better remedy than a short voyage.</P>
<P><HI>Riding on horseback</HI> is, in a certain respect, an excellent medical remedy, by which all the muscles, from the toes to the head, are in re∣ciprocal motion, and which manifests its prin∣cipal effects on the intestines of the abdomen. It clears the intestinal canal, promotes the evacuation of crude substances, strengthens the stomach and bowels, improves digestion, prevents or resolves incipient obstructions, and facilitates the perspiration of the whole body. To the hypochondriac it is an inesti∣mable remedy; but, if the obstructions should be too far advanced, riding ought either not to be attempted at all, or practised in as slow a pace as the horse can walk. In short, it is to be undertaken with the same precaution as sailing, in those stages of consumption which admit of these remedies.</P>
<P>Farther, riding is not advisable in cases of hemorrhoids, ruptures, and gravel. The fee∣ble and relaxed ought to begin with a gentle pace, and to increase it gradually; for a mod∣erate trot is the proper medicinal mode of riding: and, if they expect to derive real ad∣vantage from riding on horseback, they must neither trot too fast, nor make use of a heavy and jolting horse. Such patients as are unac∣customed to this exercise, particularly hypo∣chondriacs, generally ride with great timidity. Their lives are, as it were, in continual dan∣ger; by the awkward posture of their bodies on horseback, they are frequently hurt in parts accessible to injuries; stitches in the
<PB N="260" REF="039111_0290_1013A0AC3B15BB80"/>
side, congestions of blood in the head, and vi∣olent perspiration, counterbalance every ad∣vantage received from their excursions. To most of these patients, if they can afford it, the riding-school cannot fail to be extremely useful; for the regular manner of training the horses there, their uniform and steady motion, the attention paid to the proper pos∣ture of the rider, by keeping his breast and abdomen erect, and the legs properly extend∣ed; all are circumstances very favourable to the patient and convalescent. But, even here, it is the moderate kind of exercise only, that promises real benefit in a medicinal sense;—continued furious driving and hard trotting are always extremely dangerous.</P>
<P>For similar reasons, riding on horseback, as well as in carriages, immediately after a meal, is still more dangerous than walking. The most proper time for riding is the morning, when the stomach is empty. It should, how∣ever, not be long continued; one hour, in general, is quite sufficient; and in this respect, riding is preferable to any other exercise, as it can be practised by persons, whose business does not permit them to devote much of their time to that purpose.</P>
<P><HI>Swimming</HI> is likewise an useful exercise, which at the same time has the additional ad∣vantage of a cold bath. The motions and muscular exertions, which it requires, increase its utility: some rules and precautions, how∣ever, must be attended to. They have been stated at considerable length in CHAP. III. "On the use of Baths." I shall, therefore,
<PB N="261" REF="039111_0291_1013A0ED55307428"/>
at present only remark, that we should not enter with the feet, but with the head, into a cold bath; that the body should be neither too warm nor too cold in applying this bath; and that we should not choose dangerous riv∣ers, or ponds, nor enter the water before the rays of the sun have in some degree warmed it, and rendered it more temperate. The sen∣sation produced by cold water is indeed less to be apprehended, than the consequences arising from imprudently plunging into it, when the body is either too much cooled or heated.</P>
<P><HI>Playing</HI> at <HI>Hand-ball, Cricket,</HI> and the like, have a more powerful effect on the muscles than the abdomen; and are therefore, in one respect, unavailing to sedentary people, and on the other hand unnecessarily fatiguing. <HI>Caroussels,</HI> or riding on machines in a circle, are movements which require too much mus∣cular exertion of the debilitated, whose strength admits only of a moderate exercise. These, as well as <HI>swinging machines,</HI> and the lately contrived <HI>swinging cars,</HI> moving on a wheel with perpendicular pivots, are the least proper for those who are inclined to giddi∣ness, and nervous symptoms in general, on account of the fear, and sometimes the dan∣gerous accidents attending them. But, at the same time, both species of exercise are ex∣tremely favourable in such states of health, as require an uniform and gentle motion of the whole body, in the pure and open air, particularly in the high swinging cars, which are well calculated for that purpose.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="039111_0292_1013A0ADC483C6E8"/>
<HI>Speaking,</HI> is one of the most healthful and necessary species of exercise; and, without any ludicrous idea, I may assert, that this practice, is particularly salutary to the female sex, who are more confined at home than men. Here, however, as in other cases, ex∣cess is prejudicial. Loud reading and speak∣ing are of singular advantage to literary men, affording them good substitutes for other kinds of exercise, for which they seldom have suf∣ficient leisure or opportunities. It is to this cause we may justly ascribe the longevity of many schoolmasters, and teachers in univer∣sities, who, notwithstanding their sedentary employments, and the vitiated air which they daily breathe in school-rooms, attain to a long and healthy life. To speak very loud, and to exercise the voice immediately after a meal, is pernicious to the lungs, as well as to the organs of digestion.</P>
<P><HI>Singing</HI> promotes the lively circulation of the blood through the lungs, and all parts of the body; the lungs, as well as the abdominal intestines, are shaken by the vibrating motion of the air, in a manner very conducive to their salubrity. The phlegm, and other nox∣ious matter, collected about the pulmonary vessels, are thereby resolved and carried away, so that they cannot mix with the blood, and the most dangerous stagnations in the smaller vessels are thus prevented: the blood is uni∣formly distributed and driven to the larger veins and arteries. For the same law of na∣ture, by which river-water is preserved sweet and fresh, while that of pools and ditches stag∣nates
<PB N="263" REF="039111_0293_1013A0EEDAF876F8"/>
and putrifies, is also fully applicable here. The air inhaled in singing is of similar service to us, as the current to the water: perspiration is thereby promoted, and the mind is enlivened with the body. Those sedentary artificers or mechanics, who from habit almost constantly sing at their work, unintentionally contribute much to the pres∣ervation of their health.</P>
<P>All <HI>Wind Instruments</HI> are more or less hurt∣ful; for, as much air is thereby introduced into the lungs, and as it is but gradually and partially emitted, that organ soon becomes debilitated. Hence persons of weak lungs, who are very fond of playing the flute, haut∣boy, or French horn, are frequently afflicted with spitting of blood, cough, shortness of breath, and pulmonary consumption. Be∣sides, blowing checks the circulation of the blood through the lungs, accumulates it to∣wards the head, and disposes such musicians to apoplexy. By the violent expulsion of the air, the abdominal muscles are contracted, all the parts of the abdomen are compressed, the circulation of the fluids is retarded, and many unpleasant and frequently fatal consequences are induced.</P>
<P>There are other kinds of <HI>musical instruments,</HI> which, in a dietetical view, deserve to be con∣demned. Such is the <HI>Harmonica,</HI> which, by the rotation of the glasses on the singers, (a kind of negative electricity) induces a great degree of nervous weakness. And this effect is much accelerated by the acute and vibrat∣ing sounds of this instrument, by which the
<PB N="264" REF="039111_0294_1013A0B04E045548"/>
organs of hearing are intensely affected. Per∣haps all stringed instruments, which are play∣ed by the touch of the fingers, such as the harp, the guitar, and the violin, produce a similar effect on the nervous system; espe∣cially if it be true, that the <HI>papillae,</HI> or the points of the fingers, are the strongest con∣ductors of the supposed nervous fluid. It is at least probable, that to be able to play on such instruments, with expression, requires a more than common sensibility of the nerves, which indeed may be sometimes artificially acquired, but to the detriment of health. For it cannot be doubted, that a local excite∣ment of irritability may be gradually propa∣gated over the whole nervous system; and that, from raising some parts of the body to a preternatural state of sensibility, the common character of those who are called <HI>Virtuosi,</HI> is generally marked with nervous debility. Ev∣ery body knows in how extraordinary a man∣ner music may influence the mind; that the passions of persons of sensibility may be most effectually roused and allayed by it; nay, that in some individuals, every feeling of the mind can be affected at pleasure, by the various mod∣ifications of harmony. As, therefore, sadness, grief, and other depressing passions, may be alleviated by appropriate music, it is an exer∣cise deserving every commendation. Yet we must neither expect to cure by it diseases of the mind, nor their concomitant bodily disor∣ders: this is beyond the power of music, which acts as a palliative only, or as a nerv∣ous stimulus, the effect of which is instanta∣neous,
<PB N="265" REF="039111_0295_1013A0F166E0DD98"/>
but of short duration. For, as soon as the exciting cause ceases, it is succeeded by an uncomfortable sensation of debility and re∣laxation. It is even probable, that music, like all other anodyne and soothing remedies, may in the end increase the disposition to nervous weakness, by its too frequent repetition.</P>
<P>Lastly, the posture of the body, in practis∣ing music, also deserves attention; as the breast and abdomen may be compressed by stooping, so as to cause very serious com∣plaints; and as the eyes may be injured by reading the notes, at too great or short a dis∣tance, especially for the double keys of the harp and harpsichord: indeed, reading music is in general more fatiguing to the eyes, than any other kind of exertion.</P>
<P><HI>Friction</HI> of the body, which can be perform∣ed either by the naked hand, a piece of flan∣nel, or still better by a flesh-brush, is one of the most gentle and useful species of exercise. The whole body may be subjected to this mild operation, but principally the abdomen, the spine, the arms, and legs. It clears the skin, resolves stagnating humours, promotes per∣spiration, strengthens the fibres, and increases the warmth and energy of the whole system. In rheumatism, gout, palsy, and green-sick∣ness, it is an excellent remedy.</P>
<P>Daily friction of the whole body was with the ancients, and still is in the East Indies, considered one of the most indispensable requi∣sites of a people, who by their indolent man∣ner of life seem to have adopted it, more with a view of indulging in sensual pleasures, than
<PB N="266" REF="039111_0296_1013A0B1D7046908"/>
as the means of preserving health. It is, how∣ever, one of the most salutary expedients, by which the whole body receives nearly as much benefit as from a tepid bath, and which, as being in the power of every person, ought to be more frequently and more generally used. To the sedentary, the hypochondriac, and persons troubled with indigestion, who cannot afford leisure to take sufficient exer∣cise, the daily friction of the belly, in particu∣lar, cannot be too much recommended as a substitute for other means, in order to dis∣solve pituitous stagnations, which may be forming in the abdomen, and to re-invigorate the vessels. And though it be not attended with all the advantages enjoyed from exercise in the open air, it still produces a powerful effect on the organs of digestion; for the moderate exercise of a whole day will scarcely invigorate the abdominal vessels, and particu∣larly the stomach, so much as the friction of these parts, continued for half an hour. But, if it be intended for these beneficial purposes, it should be performed in the morning, on an empty stomach, or in bed before we rise, gently and steadily, in a circular direction, and at least for five or ten minutes at a time.</P>
<P>In a weak state of the abdomen, and the nerves in general, we may derive still more salutary effects from friction, if the stomach and the whole abdomen be rubbed every morning, and at night, before going to bed, with a sponge, or a piece of flannel dipped in cold water. This possesses still greater advan∣tages over internal medicines, because it can
<PB N="267" REF="039111_0297_1013A0F521BB2D78"/>
be safely employed, even in cases where the alimentary canal, from its obstructed state, scarcely admits of any other remedies, while friction, and the affusion of cold water, gen∣erally relieve these obstructions, and even habitual costiveness.</P>
<P>Motion or exercise ought to be continued only till we feel an agreeable lassitude, and a sensible degree of perspiration. If it be car∣ried farther, it weakens instead of strength∣ening the body, and leaves behind disagreea∣ble consequences to the lungs, filled with heated blood. Even the robust man will ex∣perience some, though less unpleasant effects than the debilitated, if he has committed an excess of this nature.</P>
<P>After having taken exercise, we should not venture to rest in a cool place, nor upon a green plot; still less should we expose ourselves to a current of air; but rather frequent a place warmed by the mild rays of the sun in summer, or a moderately warm apartment in winter, so that the sudden change of temper∣ature may not injure us, by suppressing per∣spiration.</P>
<P>For the same reasons, the thirst we gener∣ally feel after exercise, ought not to be in∣stantly satisfied by cooling drink. It is how∣ever allowable to drink some warm or diluent liquors, if we cannot wait till the natural warmth be restored. The late Dr. Fothergill very properly advised, that people in a state of perspiration should, to avoid all danger, eat a mouthful of bread, with a little salt, and thus gain time, till the blood and the liquor
<PB N="268" REF="039111_0298_1013A129B9BB30A8"/>
to be drunk had acquired a more equal tem∣perature. A small quantity of vinegar, or the juice of lemons in water, is well calculated to quench thirst, and at the same time to pro∣mote perspiration. Travellers on foot ought to be upon their guard against too much drink; for, the more liquids they take, the more they will perspire, and the greater will be the subsequent relaxation and danger of cathing cold, when their clothes are saturated with perspirable matter. They should also abstain from drink productive of a laxative effect, which would cause debility, and even faintings. The most suitable of all substances to mix with water, is the pure or essential acid of tartar, with a small quantity of sugar. This affords a cooling and refreshing beverage, without relaxing the bowels, like lemonade. Persons with whom vitriolic acid agrees, may take a tea-spoonful of a mixture, consisting of six or eight parts of spirits of wine, and one part of vitriolic acid, to a pint of water. A beverage made of a weak acidulated wine and water is cooling and strengthening. In the very cold weather of winter, people ought to avoid all heating liquors, such as ardent spirits and strong wines. Warm diluents, such as tea and coffee, are equally improper, and a poor protection against cold; for their warm∣ing property is of short duration; they are productive of debility, a more torpid circula∣tion of the blood, and consequently of an in∣crease of cold. It is much better to eat pre∣viously some solid meat, by which the diges∣tive organs may be exercised, such as cold
<PB N="269" REF="039111_0299_1013A1486A46A990"/>
animal food and bread, and to drink after it some bitter ale or beer. On the other hand, when we suffer from intense cold, or have been exposed to the wind and weather, a few cups of strong tea, with plenty of cream and sugar, is then the best and safest refreshment: and it is equally invigorating in summer after extreme heat and fatigue. Feeble individu∣als, whose stomachs generate much acid, and who are frequently troubled on their journies with a sudden voracious appetite, are liable to the most painful attacks of weakness on the road, and on that account they ought al∣ways to be provided with some kind of solid food in their excursions. Such persons should carefully abstain from the use of wine, brandy, or other heating and stimulating cordials, while travelling, especially in the morning: they might with more advantage eat some bread and butter, warm or buttered ale, strong broth, gruel, or the like nourishing substances.</P>
<P>We are now to consider the consequences arising from the <HI>want of exercise.</HI> This, indeed, is still more debilitating than too violent mo∣tion. The solid parts of the human frame are relaxed by it; the circulation of the flu∣ids is retarded; they gradually stagnate in the smaller capillary vessels; the secretions are diminished; and abundance of moisture or fat is generated, which renders the body, as well as the mind, more indolent and lifeless:—relaxation of the muscles, obstructions of the intestines, hemorrhoids, apoplectic fits, various species of dropsy, and at length a pre∣mature
<PB N="270" REF="039111_0300_1013A12B45110328"/>
death, are the sad consequences. Men of letters are the most unhealthy of all human beings, because their bodies have scarcely any other exercise but the imperceptible motion of the arms. Want of appetite, flatulency, anxiety, at one time obstructions, at another diarrhoea, and the most diversified nervous symptoms, are their attendants. Sleep is be∣yond their reach; a thousand tormenting in∣conveniencies, hypochondriasis, and at length a complete state of melancholy, is too frequent∣ly their lot. Temperance alone will not remedy all these evils; for since we cannot remain vigorous and healthy for two days together, with the same mass of blood, a new access of the purest and most subtle parts of our fluids must daily support the nervous sys∣tem, in order to preserve its regular functions. If this be not continually restored, weakness and relaxation of body and mind are the in∣evitable consequences; with this difference only, that in a state of debility, from too much bodily exercise, the thick and coarse particles of the fluids are carried into circula∣tion with the others, and the next meal, or the first sleep after it, very soon supplies the deficiency: in mental labour, on the contrary, digestion is interrupted, the crude and viscid parts of food remain unassimilated, and the body is prevented from receiving its proper nourishment. In like manner, the sedentary mechanics and artificers are affected; partic∣ularly shoe-makers, taylors, and weavers. They experience hardships similar to those, to which men of letters are subject; and it has
<PB N="271" REF="039111_0301_1013A0F93730A1B0"/>
been frequently observed, that they are very liable to diseases of the mind, and especially to religious fanaticism.</P>
<P><HI>Standing,</HI> though useful as a change after long sitting, is apt to occasion accumulations of blood, or rather of the serous part of it, in the lower extremities. Swelled legs are there∣fore common among printers. It is a posture little calculated to relieve the studious, and the body is at the same time more fatigued by standing than sitting. If we sit much, we must attend to the two following rules: 1. that no part of the body be compressed: and 2. that it be not too long continued at one time. The common manner of sitting, with the head reclined, is extremely perni∣cious; for the circulation of the fluids in the abdomen is thus checked; the intestines are compressed, and the vessels of the breast con∣tracted. The head also suffers by bending it too much forward; as the blood is thereby impelled to circulate towards it more copi∣ously than is consistent with health. The studious, especially, would do well, not to perform all their avocations in a sedentary posture, but occasionally to relieve at once their body and mind, by standing, or walking about the room. The mode of sitting ought also to be made as convenient as possible, so that both the body and head may be kept in an almost perpendicular posture; that the breast and abdomen may not be obstructed in their alternate expansion; and lastly, that the arms and legs may not be held in a crooked and unnatural position: all this should be
<PB N="272" REF="039111_0302_1013A12E025B7848"/>
particularly attended to, by those who teach children to read and write. The pressure of the abdominal muscles may in a great meas∣ure be prevented by high tables and desks, and by raised stools or chairs, upon which a person rather stands than sits.</P>
<P>To lie or rest horizontally is attended with a cessation of all exercise. If the head be placed low, and this too long continued, there may arise head-ach, by the increased pressure of the blood on the brain. Here, likewise, a frequent change of posture is nec∣essary, in order to obstruct none of the bodily functions, and to prevent the stagnation of humours.</P>
<P>Finally, the <HI>faculties of the mind</HI> deserve no less attention than those of the body.</P>
<P>Alternate changes of tranquillity and activ∣ity are equally beneficial to the mind, as rest and exercise to the body. Too long contin∣ued, too frequent, and too profound reflec∣tions, are alike injurious to both. The same powers are diminished here as in bodily la∣bour, and in a still greater proportion; for muscular exertions, though fatiguing, are re∣productive of new vigour. This may indeed be also applied to mental labour, by which the mind improves in capacity, but the body is a sufferer from every unusual exertion of the mind; and, with the body, the mind by degrees also becomes diseased:—in profound meditations the vital spirits are, as it were, withdrawn from the organs of sense; the body is for the time almost deprived of sensa∣tion; and we frequently become in a manner
<PB N="273" REF="039111_0303_1013A0FBC5526D40"/>
absent. Reflection always directed to one ob∣ject, not only debilitates, but also suppresses the other faculties of the mind, and does not per∣mit it to deviate from its favourite pursuit. Thus we sometimes see melancholy, nay mad∣ness itself, overwhelm persons devoted to the contemplation of oue particular object. In∣tense and abstruse thought, in general, if not checked in time, may be attended with stu∣por or insanity.</P>
<P>To enable us to reflect seriously upon an important subject, time and place ought to be so chosen that the mind may be diverted by no other object; for two ideas cannot be conceived at one time. Hence we should study in an apartment which is not too light, and where we are undisturbed by noise:—the muscles should not be actively employed during study: it is therefore improper and pernicious, immediately after meals, or before digestion be completed. The morning, in∣deed, is the most profitable time for study; though necessity and custom make many ex∣ceptions; so that some persons, from gradual practice, are able to perform their mental tasks during the greatest noise, and in a room full of children.</P>
<P>Much and frequent inactivity of mind agrees, indeed, well with the body, which in that state fully performs its functions, but it becomes unwieldy, insomuch as at length to stupify the mental powers: the ideas become obscure and confused; and a total loss of memory, or oblivion of the past, is but too often the consequent effect of such indolence.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of SLEEPING and WAKING: their just propor∣tion with regard to age, the constitution of the body, mode of life, and other circumstances.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>SLEEP and wakefulness are nearly in the same relation to each other as exercise and rest. Waking always presupposes a certain degree of activity; all the <HI>natural</HI> functions, digestion, the preparation of the chyle and blood, assimilation, secretion and excretion, are then more vigorously performed, and would soon exhaust their powers, if sleep did not restore to them the beneficial and indis∣pensable supplies.</P>
<P><HI>Sleep</HI> is therefore necessary to existence and health, and it is an improper and fruitless at∣tempt, to deprive ourselves, by an ill-direct∣ed activity, of the requisite portion of this refreshment; for Nature will maintain her rights, in spite of our efforts to subvert them: and both body and mind suffer, without at∣taining any real advantage from an extrava∣gant watchfulness.</P>
<P>Before I proceed to inquire into the conse∣quences arising from either too much or too little sleep, it will be useful to premise a con∣cise theory, or the physiology of this suspen∣sion of the mental powers.</P>
<P>When the body is fatigued, when the sen∣ses, together with the voluntary motions of the muscles, have been for some time active, we stand in need of the alternation of rest,
<PB N="275" REF="039111_0305_1013A0FF5E2BE468"/>
which is obtained by sleep. During a sound sleep, the senses, and the voluntary muscular motions, are not exercised; but the <HI>vital</HI> functions, such as respiration, and the circu∣lation of the blood, as well as most of the nat∣ural functions aforementioned, are regularly though more slowly performed. During sleep, therefore, the motion of the heart and the blood-vessels, even the action of the brain and the nervous system, as likewise the peristaltic or vermicular motion of the stomach and the intestines, and the secretion of the fluids, are performed in an uniform and steady manner. Previous to sleep, we perceive a languor of the senses, and of the muscles which are sub∣ject to our will, and of those also which keep the body in an erect posture; the head in∣clines downwards, the upper eye-lid and the lower jaw-bone likewise sink, the venous blood accumulates towards the heart, and compels us to yawn, in order to facilitate the transi∣tion of the blood into the lungs, by the deep breathing which takes place: finally, the brain itself, as the organ of the mind, appears to be fatigued; hence our ideas become irregular, and there arises a kind of faint imbecility of the understanding. That the motions of the heart are stronger during sleep, and that per∣spiration is more active, must be ascribed to the warmth of the bed-clothes, by which the insensible perspiration softens and relaxes the skin. But a person, who sleeps in his usual dress, will feel chilly; and those animals that sleep long, as the hedge-hog, the murmur-deer
<PB N="276" REF="039111_0306_1013A13431F40A48"/>
(<HI>Marmota Alpina,</HI> L.) suffer an extraordinary degree of cold.</P>
<P>As the senses are inactive during sleep; as the nervous energy is less exhausted, and its secretion continued, a new supply of it is col∣lected, and the organs of sense, as well as the muscles, receive additional vigour. This oc∣casions us to awake, particularly if roused by any stimulus. While we are asleep, the nu∣tritive particles can more easily attach them∣selves to the fibres, and fat also is more read∣ily generated, from the retarded circulation of the blood. After we have slept sufficiently, we are apt, on awaking, to stretch the limbs and joints of the body, and sometimes to yawn: the latter, with an instinctive desire of promoting the circulation of blood through the lungs, which was retarded during sleep; the former, namely stretching, in order to as∣sist the extensor muscles, which, by the flex∣ion of the limbs in sleep, had been more ex∣tended, and in order to expand again the flexor muscles, that had been moderately con∣tracted.</P>
<P>The proximate cause of sleep appears to be an impeded motion of the nervous fluid in the brain. This motion is produced by a kind of collapse of the subtle insertions of the nerves, as well as by a mechanical compres∣sion of them. Hence we can explain, how things so totally opposite are able to produce sleep, when they either exhaust or compress the tubes of the nerves. Of the former kind is every violent and fatiguing species of la∣bour, a considerable loss of blood, perspiration
<PB N="277" REF="039111_0307_1013A101F5AE4388"/>
increased by external heat, and every thing that withdraws the blood from the head; for instance, warm baths of the lower ex∣tremities, a stomach filled with much food, &amp;c. Of the latter kind of incitements to sleep, namely, those that act by compression, is every mechanical pressure on the brain, whether it proceed from water accumulated in its ventricles, from a local depression or fracture of the cranium, or from extravasated blood:—in like manner, the impeded regress of the blood from the brain, or the increased access of it to that organ, may effect such a pressure, by distending the blood-vessels, as is the case in using narcotics, or wine and other spirituous liquors; and, lastly, an intense de∣gree of cold, as well as the state of an approaching apoplexy. Sleep is promoted by tranquillity of mind; by the absence of every stimulus to the body; by silence and dark∣ness around us; by a complete rest of the senses; by gently and uniformly affecting one of the senses, for instance, by music or read∣ing; and, lastly, by a gentle external motion of the whole body, as by rocking or sailing. On the other hand, every painful sensation, a great noise, a bright light, strong exertions of mental powers, and particularly violent pas∣sions, are calculated to prevent sleep. Thus likewise sleep may be impeded by hot, spicy, and other kinds of drink, which are said to occasion a more speedy secretion of the ner∣vous fluid.</P>
<P><HI>Dreams</HI> are vagaries of the imagination, and in most instances proceed from external sen∣sations.
<PB N="278" REF="039111_0308_1013A136CD479CC8"/>
They take place only, when our sleep is unsound, in which case the brain and nervous system are capable of performing the motions above described. We seldom dream during the first hours of sleep; perhaps, be∣cause the nervous fluid is then too much ex∣hausted; but dreams rather occur towards the morning, when this fluid has been, in some measure, restored. Every thing capable of interrupting the tranquillity of mind and body, may produce dreams. Such are the various kinds of grief and sorrow, exertions of the mind, affections and passions, crude and undigested food, a hard and inconvenient posture of the body. Those ideas which have lately occupied our mind, or made a lively impression upon us, generally constitute the principal subject of a dream, and more or less employ our imagination, when we are asleep. Animals are likewise apt to dream, but sel∣dom; and even men living temperately, and enjoying a perfect state of health, are seldom disturbed with this play of the fancy. Nay, there are examples of lively and spirited per∣sons who never dream. The great physiol∣ogist, HALLER, considers dreaming as a symp∣tom of disease, or as a stimulating cause, by which the perfect tranquillity of the <HI>sensorium</HI> is interrupted. Hence, that sleep is the most refreshing, which is undisturbed by dreams, or, at least, when we have no clear recollection of them.</P>
<P>I have before observed, that most of our dreams are sports of fancy, and derive their origin chiefly from external impressions: al∣most
<PB N="279" REF="039111_0309_1013A1037A6EFFE8"/>
every thing we see and hear, when awake, leads our imagination to collateral notions or representations, which, in a man∣ner spontaneously, and without the least ef∣fort, associate with external sensations. The place where a person whom we love former∣ly resided, a dress similar to that which we have seen her wear, the objects that employed her attention, no sooner catch our eye, than she immediately occupies our mind. And, though these images, associating with exter∣nal sensations, do not arrive at complete con∣sciousness, within the power of imagination, yet even in their latent state they may become very strong and permanent. I have been in∣formed, for instance, of a young man, who was attacked with convulsions, every time he heard the name of <HI>Jesus</HI> repeated; owing, it seems, to the circumstance of his mother hav∣ing once invoked the name of Jesus in a ter∣rific voice and manner, when she, as well as the boy, were much frightened by a tremen∣dous peal of thunder. But this is only an indirect demonstration of the existence of a faculty, which is very active in dreams, and which may be aptly called the <HI>subreasoning fac∣ulty,</HI> or the power of abstracting similarities. The conclusions, thus formed, are more fre∣quent and active, than in the waking state; because they are seldom controlled by the re∣flections of reason. I shall make use of one illustration only.</P>
<P>Very frequently we find, that in a dream a series of representations is suddenly interrupt∣ed, and another series of a very different kind
<PB N="280" REF="039111_0310_1013A1385338FD70"/>
occupies its place. This happens, as soon as an idea associates itself; which, from what∣ever cause, is more interesting than that im∣mediately preceding. It then becomes the prevailing one, and determines the association. Yet by this, too, the imagination is frequent∣ly re-conducted to the former series. The in∣terruption in the course of the preceding oc∣currences is remarked, and the power of ab∣stracting similarities is in search of the cause of this irregularity. Hence, in such cases, there usually happens some unfortunate event or other, which occasions the interruption of the story. The representing power may sud∣denly again conduct us to another series of ideas, and thus the imagination may be led by the subreasoning power before defined, from one scene to another. Of this kind, for instance, is the following remarkable dream, as related and explained in the words of Prof. MAASS, of <HI>Halle:</HI> "I dreamed once," says he, "that the Pope visited me. He commanded me to open my desk, and he carefully exam∣ined all the papers it contained. While he was thus employed, a very sparkling dia∣mond fell out of his triple crown into my desk, of which, however, neither of us took any notice. As soon as the Pope had with∣drawn, I retired to bed, but was soon obliged to rise, on account of a thick smoke, the cause of which I had yet to learn. Upon examina∣tion, I discovered, that the diamond had set fire to the papers in my desk, and burnt them to ashes."</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="039111_0311_1013A106154DACA0"/>
This dream deserves a short analysis, on account of the peculiar circumstances which occasioned it. "On the preceding evening," says Prof. Maass, "I was visited by a friend, with whom I had a lively conversation upon Joseph II.'s suppression of monasteries and con∣vents. With this idea▪ though I did not be∣come conscious of it in the dream, was asso∣ciated the visit which the Pope publickly paid the Emperor Joseph at Vienna, in consequence of the measures taken against the clergy; and with this again was combined, however faint∣ly, the representation of the visit, which had been paid me by my friend. These two events were, by the subreasoning faculty, compounded into one, according to the es∣tablished rule—that things which agree in their parts, do also correspond as to the whole;—hence the Pope's visit was changed into a visit made to me. The subreasoning faculty, then, in order to account for this ex∣traordinary visit, fixed upon that which was the most important object<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in my room, namely, the desk, or rather the papers locked up in it. That a diamond fell out of the triple crown, was a collateral association, which was owing merely to the representa∣tion of the desk. Some days before, when opening the desk, I had broken the glass of my watch, which I held in my hand, so that the glass fell among the papers. Hence no farther attention was paid to the diamond, being a representation of a collateral series of things. But afterwards, the representation of the sparkling stone was again excited, and
<PB N="282" REF="039111_0312_1013A13B373E3258"/>
became the prevailing idea; hence it deter∣mined the succeeding association. On account of its similarity, it excited the representation of fire, and was indeed confounded with it. Hence arose fire and smoke. But, in the event, the writings only were burnt, not the desk itself, to which, being of comparative∣ly less value, the attention was not at all di∣rected."</P>
<P>It is farther undeniable, that there are in the human mind certain obscure representa∣tions, and that it is of great advantage to be convinced of the reality of these images, if desirous of perceiving the connexion subsist∣ing among the operations of the imagination. Of the numerous phenomena, founded on obscure ideas, and which consequently prove their existence, I shall only remark the fol∣lowing. It is a well known fact, that many dreams originate in the impressions made on the body during sleep; that they consist of analogous images, or such as are associated with sensations that would arise from these impressions during a waking state. Hence, for instance, if our legs are placed in a perpen∣dicular posture, we are often terrified by a dream, that implies the imminent danger of falling from a steep rock or precipice. The soul must represent to itself these external impressions in a lively manner, otherwise no ideal picture could be thus excited. But, as we do not become at all conscious of them, they are but faintly and obscurely represented.</P>
<P>If we make a resolution of rising earlier in the morning than usual; and if we imprint
<PB N="283" REF="039111_0313_1013A109DC535BA8"/>
this determination on our mind, immediately before going to bed, we are almost certain to succeed. Now it is self-evident, that this suc∣cess cannot be ascribed to the efforts of the body, but altogether to the mind; which probably during sleep perceives and computes the duration of time, so that it makes an im∣pression on the body, whereby we are enabled to awake at an appointed hour. Yet all this takes place, without our consciousness, and the representations remain obscure.</P>
<P>Many productions of art are so complicated, that a variety of simple conceptions are re∣quisite to lay the foundation of them; yet the artist is almost entirely unconscious of these individual notions. Thus, a person per∣forms a piece of music, without being oblig∣ed to reflect, in a conscious manner, on the signification of the notes, their value, and the order of the fingers he must observe; nay even without clearly distinguishing the strings of the harp, or the keys of the harpsichord.—We cannot attribute this to the mechanism of the body, which might gradually accustom it∣self to the accurate placing of the fingers.—This could be applied only where we play a piece of music, frequently practised; but it is totally inapplicable to a new piece, which is played by the professor with equal facility, though he has never seen it before. In the latter case, there must necessarily arise an ideal representation, or an act of judgment, pre∣vious to every motion of the singers.</P>
<P>These arguments, I hope, sufficiently evince the occurrence of such obscure notions and
<PB N="284" REF="039111_0314_1013A13EF205BD88"/>
representations, as lay the ground-work of all our dreams. That among the thousands and millions of fanciful and supposed ominous dreams, some are occasionally realized, is not a matter of astonishment; but many people, particularly the victims of the lottery, too frequently find reason to regret, that these omens are not always to be depended upon; if those deluded visionaries would permit themselves to reason, and to calculate, they would discover, that there are as many chances against their dream being realized, as there are against their ticket turning up a twenty thousand pounds prize.</P>
<P>Before I quit this subject, I shall relate an extraordinary dream of the celebrated Italian, GALILEO. When this great man, at a very advanced age, had lost the use of his eyes, he was once conducted in his walks over a beau∣tiful plain, by his pupil, TORICELLI. "Once," said the aged sage, "my eyes permitted me to enjoy the charms of these fields. But now, since their light is extinguished, these pleas∣ures are lost to me for ever. Heaven justly inflicts the punishment which was predicted to me many years ago. When in prison, and impatiently languishing for liberty, I began to be discontented with the ways of Provi∣dence; COPERNICUS appeared to me in a dream; his celestial spirit conducted me over luminous stars, and, in a threatening voice, reprehended me for having murmured against him, at whose <HI>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at</HI> all these worlds had pro∣ceeded from nothing. "A time shall come," said he, "when thine eyes shall refuse to as∣sist thee in contemplating these wonders."</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="039111_0315_1013A10C6D230DC0"/>
After this long, though I hope not unin∣teresting digression, I proceed to state the con∣sequences arising from too much or too little sleep.</P>
<P>To continue in a waking state, beyond a proper time, consumes the vital spirits, disor∣ganizes the nerves, and causes so many un∣easy sensations, that a considerable while must elapse before we can fall asleep, namely, until their greatest violence has abated. The flu∣ids of the body become acrid, the fat is con∣sumed, and there arises at length an inclina∣tion to vertigo, violent head-ach, anxiety, ac∣tions without connexion, without design, and without consistency. Those who indulge themselves in much sleep, are seldom liable to very strong passions. Persons, on the con∣trary, who sleep too little, frequently con∣tract a violent and vindictive temper. Long-continued wakefulness is capable of changing the temper and disposition of mind of the most mild and gentle; of affecting a complete al∣teration of their features, and, at length, of occasioning the most singular whims, the strangest deviations in the power of imagina∣tion, and, in the end, absolute insanity.</P>
<P>Excess of sleep, however, is not less preju∣dicial. The whole body sinks gradually un∣der a complete state of inactivity, the solid parts become relaxed, the blood circulates slowly, and remains particularly long in the head: perspiration is disordered, the fluids are incrassated, the body increases in fat and thick humours, and is rendered incapable of being the medium of mental exertion, the
<PB N="286" REF="039111_0316_1013A140784E4A98"/>
memory is enfeebled, and the unhappy sleep∣er falls into a thoughtless lethargic state, by which his sensibility is, in a great measure, de∣stroyed.</P>
<P>Persons troubled with hypochondriasis and hysterics do themselves much injury by sleeping too long, especially in the morning, when the body is much weakened by its too long continuance in a heated and unwhole∣some atmosphere. To such individuals, it is also dangerous to remain for a length of time in a state of inactivity. Indeed, excess in sleeping is detrimental to the muscular pow∣ers of every person; to the phlegmatic, espe∣cially, whose fluids will thus soon be univer∣sally corrupted; and sanguine temperaments thereby acquire a superabundance of blood. The melancholy, whose blood circulates slow∣ly, must suffer inconveniencies in their secre∣tions and excretions by this indulgence; and we generally find, that long sleepers are af∣flicted with costiveness and obstructions.—Early rising, and timely going to bed, may a∣lone render them more healthy and vigorous.</P>
<P>If it can be advantageous to any description of persons, to sleep beyond the usual portion of time, it is to the choleric. To sleep im∣mediately after supper, is apt to occasion the night-mare, or a stagnation of the blood, which, by its pressure, produces the sensation or idea of this troublesome bed-fellow. It is principally the nervous, the debilitated, and those of an impaired digestion, who are visit∣ed by such terrifying dreams.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="039111_0317_1013A10DF3D3F1C0"/>
The proper duration of sleep, in youth and adults, is usually settled at six or seven hours; in children and the aged, from eight to nine hours. Yet the individual deviations in the constitution of the body, and its various wants, scarcely admit of any accurate rules. The more bodily weakness we feel, the more we may indulge in sleep, provided it be re∣freshing. If people in a state of health are perfectly cheerful in mind and body, when they first awake, this is the most certain cri∣terion, that they have slept sufficiently.</P>
<P>We should, however, be on our guard, not to confound the natural wants of the body with a blameable custom. For most persons habitually sleep too much, or remain longer in bed than they ought. The principal cause of this destructive custom undoubtedly arises in infancy; when children are permitted to sleep in very soft and heating beds, and en∣couraged to lie longer than is proper, from a mistaken notion that they cannot sleep too much. From this injudicious treatment, they cannot attain a solid texture of the body, and a foundation is laid for many subsequent dis∣eases. The rickets, so very common in many families, in the present age, often originate in such indulgencies, since the general relaxation of the body, and the tendency to profuse per∣spiration, is thus promoted in an extraordi∣nary degree. At the age of puberty, this ef∣feminacy of the body, and the inclination to sleep, together with the pleasant sensation, which a soft and warm bed affords in a wak∣ing state, are certainly the first and most fre∣quent
<PB N="288" REF="039111_0318_1013A14312B3D398"/>
causes of a vice, that might be effectual∣ly prevented by early rising.</P>
<P>The custom of sleeping long, when contin∣ued to the state of manhood, becomes so habit∣ual that it cannot be relinquished without great struggles, and a firm resolution. Those, then, who are not possessed of this firmness, instead of attaining a strong constitution, will acquire a phlegmatic, relaxed, and cold temperament, which will render them ir∣resolute, and incapable of energetic efforts; and from which the mind, by degrees, becomes as indifferent towards every object, as the body is unfit for muscular exertion.—Hence, to listen to the voice of Nature, in this respect, will contribute more to our happiness, than to shorten our repose by many of the usual but violent means of excitement, when the body is in want of rest.</P>
<P>To children, at a very early period of life, no limits of sleep can be prescribed; but, af∣ter the sixth or seventh year of age, some re∣gulations become necessary, to habituate them to a certain regularity. The just proportion of sleep can be ascertained only, by their more or less lively temperament, by their employ∣ments, exercise and amusements through the day, and according to the more or less healthy state of their bodies. In pursuing this measure, however, we must not attempt to awaken children from their sleep, in a violent or ter∣rifying manner, which is frequently done, and is extremely pernicious.</P>
<P>In great disquietude of mind, and after vi∣olent passions, sleep is the more necessary, as
<PB N="289" REF="039111_0319_1013A110E1DC2AC8"/>
these agitate and exhaust the frame, more than the most fatiguing bodily labour. Hence, many persons never sleep so sound, as when they are afflicted with grief and sorrow. A fretful and peevish temper, as well as a fit of the hypochondriasis, cannot be more effectu∣ally relieved, than by a short sleep. Frequent∣ly, after a sleep, of a few minutes only, we awake refreshed, we can reflect on our diffi∣culties with a calm mind, and again recon∣cile ourselves to the troubles of life. In such situations, though we should not be able to sleep, even a quiet posture of the body, with the eyes closed, is of some advantage.</P>
<P>There is scarcely any misfortune so great, that it cannot be relieved or alleviated by sleep; as, on the contrary, we should inevitably sink under its pressure, if this beneficent balm did not support us. Yet, frequently too, unea∣siness of mind, by its continual stimulus on the <HI>censorium,</HI> prevents all sleep: hence the unquiet repose and even whole sleepless nights of those, whose heads are filled with cares or important schemes. As mental labours ex∣haust our strength more than those of the bo∣dy, literary men, who employ themselves in long and profound reflections, require more sleep than others. Though some persons, whose body and mind are equally indolent, have a greater inclination to sleep, than the lively and laborious, yet it is not so beneficial to them; since they are destitute of the es∣sential requisites to health, namely, activity and vigour.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="039111_0320_1013A144CB610A48"/>
The most healthy, and those who lead the most regular lives, frequently have an uneasy and very short sleep: they also require less rest at one time than another. He who di∣gests easily, stands less in need of sleep than others. After taking aliment difficult of di∣gestion, Nature herself invites to the enjoy∣ment of rest, and to sleep in proportion to the time which is required for the concoction and assimilation of food.—Excessive evacuations of whatever kind, as well as intoxication by strong liquors, render additional sleep neces∣sary. In winter and summer, we require somewhat more time for sleep than in spring and autumn; because the vital spirits are less exhausted in the latter seasons, and the mass of the blood circulates more uniformly, than in the cold of winter or heat of summer, when it is either too much retarded, or accel∣erated.</P>
<P>It is very improper to sit up too late in the long winter evenings, whether at the desk or the bottle, either of which is then more hurtful than in summer, because the want of sleep is greater. Those who wish to spend the winter in good health, and useful labour, should retire to bed at eight o'clock in the evening, and rise at three or four o'clock in the morning. A winter morning, indeed, is not very charming, but the evening is <HI>natur∣ally</HI> still less so; and there is no doubt, that we can perform every kind of work, with more alacrity and success, in the early part of the day than at night, and that our eye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would likewise be benefited by this regula∣tion,
<PB N="291" REF="039111_0321_1013A11371E53D38"/>
after sleep has enabled them to under∣take any task in the morning; but they are fatigued at night, from the exertions of a whole day.</P>
<P>Every stimulus may interrupt sleep, or at least render it uneasy, and often occasion dreams, the cause of which is generally owing to an irritation in the stomach, or in the intes∣tinal canal. Dreams are, as it were, a middle state between sleeping and waking, and gen∣erally indicate some defect in the body, un∣less they give representations which originate in the occurrences of the preceding day.</P>
<P>An uneasy sleep, which is obvious from starting up, or speaking in it, and from a fre∣quent change of the posture in bed, is at no time a good symptom; it is as frequently a forerunner, as it is the effect of disease, and may be owing to the following causes:</P>
<P N="1">1. Emotions of the mind and violent pas∣sions always disorder the vital spirits;—at one time they increase, at another diminish, and sometimes altogether check their influence, the consequences of which extend to the whole circulation of the blood. Sorrows and cares produce a similar effect. Hence the nocturnal couch is a very improper place to prosecute moral researches, or to recollect what we have done, spoken, and thought through the day.—To read interesting letters, received late in the evening, usually too oc∣casions an unquiet sleep.</P>
<P N="2">2. A bad state of digestion, and especially hard or corrupted food, on account of the connexion of the brain with the stomach.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="292" REF="039111_0322_1013A0F7B1038FC8"/>
3. A repelled perspiration, if we have not covered ourselves conformably to the climate, season, and weather.—In this case, a current of air is still more hurtful than intense cold.</P>
<P N="4">4. An apartment or bed to which we are not accustomed may also occasion an uncom∣fortable sleep, as travellers frequently experi∣ence. It is therefore an essential part of a good and healthful education, to accustom children to sleep alternately upon different, and harder or softer couches, in various parts of the house, more or less temperate, which consequently enables them to sleep comfort∣ably in a simple but clean bed, in whatever place or situation they may find it.</P>
<P>Debilitated persons injure themselves much by sleeping during the day, against the order of Nature, and keeping awake the greater part of the night. Day-light is best adapted to ac∣tive employments; and the gloom and still∣ness of the night to repose. The evening-air which we inhale soon after sun-set, and night-air in general, which is vitiated in the coun∣try by the exhalations of plants, is very detri∣mental to the delicate. The forced watchful∣ness of those who apply themselves in the night to mental pursuits, is exceedingly pre∣judicial. A couple of hours sleep before mid∣night is, according to old experience, more refreshing than double the quantity after that period.</P>
<P>The question, whether to <HI>sleep after dinner</HI> be advisable, must be decided by a variety of concurrent circumstances; custom, bodily con∣stitution, age, climate, and the like.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="039111_0323_1013A1174E715B70"/>
In a weak and slow state of digestion, after having taken hard or solid food, we may in∣dulge ourselves in a short sleep, rather than after a meal consisting of such nourishment, as by its nature is easily concocted. But de∣bilitated young people especially should not sleep too much, though their weakness incline them to it; for the more they indulge in it, the greater will be their subsequent languor and relaxation.</P>
<P>Individuals of a vigorous and quick con∣coction may undertake gentle, but not violent exercise, immediately after meals, if they have eaten food that is easily digestible, and which requires little assistance, but that of the stom∣ach and its fluids. And even such persons, if they have made use of provisions difficult to be concocted, ought to remain quiet after din∣ner, and may occasionally allow themselves half an hour's sleep, in order to support di∣gestion.</P>
<P>To rest a little after dinner, is farther use∣ful to dry and emaciated persons, to the aged, and persons of an irascible disposition; to those who have spent the preceding night un∣easily and sleepless, or have been otherwise fa∣tigued, in order to restore regularity in the insensible perspiration; but in this case the body must be well covered, that it may not be exposed to cold. Such as are fond of sleep∣ing at any time of the day, are usually more indolent and heavy after it than before. A sleep after dinner ought never to exceed one hour; and it is also much better sitting than lying horizontally; for, in the latter case, we
<PB N="294" REF="039111_0324_1013A14C11427118"/>
are more subject to fluctuations of the blood towards the head, and consequently to head-ach.</P>
<P>Much depends upon the manner of lying in bed, and on the posture to which we accus∣tom ourselves. To lie on the back, with the arms over the head, prevents the circulation of the blood to the arms, and is not unfre∣quently productive of serious consequences. It is equally pernicious to lie in a crooked pos∣ture, or with the breast very low and bent inwards; for the intestines are thereby com∣pressed and obstructed in their motions, and the blood cannot easily circulate downwards; whence may arise giddiness and even apoplexy. Lying on the back is equally improper, and produces frightful dreams, together with ma∣ny other inconveniencies; the reverse posture is likewise noxious, as the stomach is thus vi∣olently oppressed, the free respiration much impeded, and the whole circulation of the fluids in the chest and abdomen wantonly prevented, to the great injury of health.</P>
<P>The most proper posture, then, is on one side, with the body straight, the limbs slight∣ly bent (not stretched, because they ought to rest) so that the body may lie somewhat high∣er than the legs. When the head is laid high, a short sleep is more refreshing than a longer one when it is reclined too low. To healthy people it is a matter of no consequence on which side they lie, and they may safely, in this respect, follow their own choice. Some dietetical observers allege, that it is better to lie in the evening on the right, and in the
<PB N="295" REF="039111_0325_1013A118D359A4D0"/>
morning on the left side; that in the even∣ing the food may more readily leave the stom∣ach, and that afterwards this organ may be better warmed by the liver.</P>
<P>In the evening we should eat light food on∣ly, and that sparingly, wait for its digestion, and consequently not lie down till two or three hours after supper. The mind ought to be kept quiet and cheerful, previous to going to rest: we should then, as much as possi∣ble, avoid gloomy thoughts, which require reflection and exertion. It is therefore a pernicious and dangerous practice to read ourselves asleep in bed. We would do much better, to exercise ourselves a little before bed-time, by walking up and down the room.</P>
<P>Sleep without dreams, of whatever nature they may be, is more healthful than when at∣tended with these fancies. Yet dreams of an agreeable kind promote the free circulation of the blood, the better concoction of food, and a due state of perspiration. The contra∣ry takes place in unpleasant dreams, which excite anxiety, terror, grief, fear, and the like. In the latter case▪ they are of themselves symp∣toms of irregularity in the system, of an ap∣proaching disorder, or of an improper posture of the body. The functions of the body be∣fore mentioned are impeded by such dreams; and the vital spirits, which ought to be re∣stored and cherished, are again dissipated by violent emotions, insomuch that the body and the mind continue unrefreshed.</P>
<P>In order to preserve the body warm, we make use of feather-beds and covers:—in
<PB N="296" REF="039111_0326_1013A14D94D6E278"/>
summer, at least, we ought to sleep upon mat∣tresses. It is a most essential requisite to every person, who wishes to lead an agreeable, ac∣tive, and useful life, to provide himself in time with a <HI>proper</HI> couch. To insure all the advantages which may be derived from this quarter, nothing is better than a mattress filled with horse-hair, or, if cheapness be an object, with dry moss, at least six inches thick. Sev∣eral of such mattresses may be placed one above another; the bolster ought to be well stuffed and elastic; in winter with feathers, and during the summer with horse-hair, more or less high, according to circumstances, but always so that the head may lie considerably more elevated than the breast and the rest of the body.</P>
<P>The cover should never be tucked in too closely, that the access of external air may not be altogether excluded. If we make use of a bedstead or a sofa provided with steel springs, one of the mattresses above described, with a similar bolster, and the light cover of a dou∣ble blanket, will be found sufficient. These beds are not only the most convenient for early risers, but also the most conducive to health. The higher classes of society in Ire∣land appear to be so well convinced of the salu∣brity of this mode of sleeping, that their chil∣dren, instead of being placed on enervating feather-beds, are habituated to sleep upon bags filled with cut straw, with blankets laid over the bags for softness, and but slightly covered. I understand, that this praise-wor∣thy practice is every day▪becoming more general.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="039111_0327_1013A11B66C8B600"/>
Indeed, there is no doubt that the muscles and nerves are more braced by a proper elas∣tic couch, than either by the most exquisite down of Norway, or the most powerful tonic or strengthening remedies taken internally. Yet these remarks are applicable only to the healthy state of the body, when Nature re∣quires no additional aid or precaution, in managing the organs of perspiration—Every bed ought to be so regulated, that it may slope down imperceptibly towards the feet; and if the particulars before stated be attend∣ed to, a healthy person will never sleep too long: he will generally awake in six hours, feel himself refreshed, rise with cheerfulness, and be fit to undertake any exertions, either of body or mind.</P>
<P>What has been remarked in a former Chapter on Dress, and the advantages derived from covering the skin with animal wool, particularly in enervated and infirm people, is likewise applicable here, with respect to the dress, and the immediate covering of the skin, when in bed. Though we usually undress ourselves as far as the shirt, partly for the sake of cleanliness, and partly with the view of re∣lieving the body from every pressure and in∣cumbrance, and of promoting a free circula∣tion of the blood; yet we should be cautious, lest we materially hurt ourselves by a sudden exposure to the air, when undressing, espec∣ially after the hot and sultry days of summer. A long and commodious night-gown of flan∣nel would be a proper night dress; especially for those who retire to their bed immediately
<PB N="298" REF="039111_0328_1013A15025D3F1D8"/>
after the bath, in order to preserve a gentle degree of perspiration.</P>
<P>The head should not be covered with a warm flannel or worsted night-cap, as it were to make it a vapour-bath; the thinnest cot∣ton or linen cap being fully sufficient. The consequences resulting from the pernicious practice of keeping the head too warm, have been explained on a former occasion. The shirt-collar should be loose, the wristbands open; and if from a bad habit we have been accustomed to wear neckcloths during sleep, they should be tied as loosely as possible. Per∣sons who are naturally chilly in the lower ex∣tremities, or are liable to pains of the stomach and abdomen, would do well to sleep in wool∣len stockings, but not in the same which they have worn through the day.</P>
<P>The <HI>feather-beds,</HI> in which we usually sleep, are certainly hurtful in many diseases, some of which they may even produce. For they ab∣sorb or imbibe the perspired vapours thrown out of the body, without our being able to cleanse them of these impurities, which are again re-absorbed and re-conducted through the pores, to the great injury of health. For this reason, mattresses filled with horse-hair, or moss, are in every respect preferable. But, as many individuals have not sufficient reso∣lution to use these, or are apprehensive of the consequences attending a sudden change, they may at least cause their feather-beds to be fre∣quently and carefully shaken, aired in the sun, and provided with a new covering. For the same reason, the bed ought not to be made
<PB N="299" REF="039111_0329_1013A11F58E94220"/>
immediately after rising, as is generally prac∣tised; but the clothes should be taken off, spread out, and not laid on the bed, until the time of going to rest draws near. Far∣ther, it is highly improper to sleep in beds overloaded with clothes▪ they heat the blood more than is consistent with health, and produce an immoderate and enervating pers∣piration, which still more weakens the organs already relaxed by sleep.</P>
<P>The custom of sleeping with the curtains drawn close, is pernicious to health, because the copious exhalations which then take place, cannot be properly dissipated, and are conse∣quently again absorbed. It is also imprudent to hide the head almost entirely under the bed-clothes. Persons who cannot sleep with∣out curtains, should tuck up the lower ends of them, or place them over chairs, so that they may not lie close to the bed, but admit a more free access of air; that side alone, which is next the wall, ought to be entirely covered with the curtain.</P>
<P>For similar reasons, the large common sleep∣ing halls, or wards in public schools, as well as in hospitals, are extremely prejudicial to health; though they may be necessary evils, and cannot be easily remedied in the great se∣minaries of education. Neither the most healthy situation, with high, lofty, and spa∣cious apartments; nor the daily practice of airing and cleaning them, are sufficient to counteract the bad effects arising from this baneful custom of crowding so many persons together to breathe in a common and con∣fined atmosphere.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="039111_0330_1013A152D1A2B5A0"/>
From these considerations, as well as in ma∣ny other respects, the sleeping together in one bed, whether children or adults, is at best a disgusting and immoral custom; besides the positive disadvantages it has with respect to health. Unless poverty or necessity render this custom unavoidable, it ought not to be practised, either among married or other per∣sons, and still less among children. It has been remarked, even in the domestic econo∣my of barbarous nations, that, in general, ev∣ery individual has a separate couch.</P>
<P>The old custom of warming the bed also deserves to be condemned; as it has a direct tendency to produce weakness and debility. This will be still more dangerous, if it be done with a charcoal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire, which, by its poi∣sonous vapours, may prove very pernicious. A person who is accustomed to sleep in a cold bed, will not feel much inconvenience in the severest cold; for, after being a short time in bed, the natural warmth of the body will overcome it: as, on the contrary, those who sleep in a warmed bed, will be the more lia∣ble to feel cold, as soon as this artificial heat is dissipated.</P>
<P>If it can be avoided, the bed-room ought not to be on the ground floor, nor towards the North. Many people prefer this situation in summer, on account of the cool air; they should, however, consider that, in such an apartment, the morning as well as the night-air, is damp and unwholesome. A bed-cham∣ber ought to be exposed to the early rays of the sun, which awake man in a state of health
<PB N="301" REF="039111_0331_1013A120DCCDB3F8"/>
at a proper time, and enliven, strengthen, and incite him to leave the bed, after having been refreshed by rest. It is, farther, more advisable to endure a moderate degree of heat, which may be modified at pleasure, by vari∣ous means, than to inhabit damp and low-sit∣uated apartments, from which the moisture cannot be easily dried up in summer.</P>
<P>A spacious and lofty room should always be chosen for a bed-chamber; for small closets and, above all, concealed beds are extremely objectionable.—The windows should never be left open at night; and as damp rooms are very prejudicial to health, we ought to pay particular attention, that the bed may not be placed near a damp wall. It is in every case preferable to place the bed so, that all the sides of it stand free. This meth∣od of placing the bedstead, in or about the middle of the room, has another advantage which, with timorous persons, is perhaps of importance. It it well known, that a flash of lightning, if it accidentally enter through a window, will take its direction along the walls, and not touch any thing placed in the middle of a room.</P>
<P>Lastly, no candle or rush-light should be kept burning during the night in a bed-room; for it not only vitiates the air in a very con∣siderable degree, but it disturbs and prevents the rest of those whose sleep is uneasy, partic∣ularly the aged. In a dark apartment, sleep generally comes without much invitation;
<PB N="302" REF="039111_0332_1013A15673411BE8"/>
as, on the other hand, the light of a candle stimulates the brain, consequently the whole nervous system; and the approaching com∣forter, whose arrival we so fondly wish, is thereby prevented, or easily interrupted, and banished to calmer regions.</P>

<P>THESE Lectures, with the exception of the Eighth and Ninth Chapters, were delivered last winter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the months of January and February, 1798.</NOTE> at Bath, and in the spring at Bristol, to numerous and re∣spectable audiences. The Author had no intention, at that time, to publish them; but as he found no Work, in the English language, comprehending such a systematic view of the various and important objects which came more immediately under his consideration, and con∣ceived that the dissemination of the rules selected by him might be generally useful, he was induced to alter his res∣olution, and submit them to the candour of the Public.</P>
<P>To many English and German writers he must ac∣knowledge his obligations, in the composition of his Work. Among the former, he has occasionally availed himself of the excellent Writings of PRIESTLEY, on the subject of <HI>'Air and Weather;'</HI> of FOTHERGILL and VAUGHAN, on <HI>'Dress,;'</HI> and of ARMSTRONG, CULLEN, and FALCONER, on <HI>'Food and Drink.'</HI> To Dr. FOTHERGILL also, on the subject of <HI>'Sleeping and Waking,'</HI> he is much indebted, as well as to Mr. ADAMS'S useful Treatise on the <HI>'Treat∣ment and Preservation of the Eyes.'</HI></P>
<P>Beside the valuable observations drawn from all these sources, he has been greatly assisted by the opinions of sev∣eral German writers, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> INGENHOUZ, HAHNEMANN, HUFELAND, MARCARD, SOEMMERING, UNZER, ZIMMER∣MANN, and others; having derived considerable advan∣tage from the general result of their respective inquiries on the subject of Diet and Regimen.</P>
<P>Although it can scarcely be expected that a Work of this nature should be perfect, or free from inaccuracy, the Author has spared no pains to render it deserving of the public favour, and trusts it will be found a domestic guide both to families and individuals.</P>
<P>Should the rules and cautions, interspersed throughout, tend, in the smallest degree, to increase the knowledge of the inquisitive, dissuade the unwary from injurious habits, or rescue the sensualist from the brink of destruction, the exertions of the Author will be amply compensated.</P>

<P>THE first Edition of these Lectures having met with a degree of approbation beyond the most sanguine hopes of the Author, he has testified his grateful sense to a dis∣cerning Public, not only by correcting and improving ev∣ery page of the Work, but likewise by enlarging and ren∣dering it as complete as the limits of a single volume would admit.</P>
<P>Many important and useful articles have been added, especially in the Fifth Chapter, "Of Food and Drink." The principal <HI>new subjects</HI> the Reader will, on consulting the Alphabetical Index, find under the terms—<HI>Arrow∣root—Artichokes—Asparagus—Barley—Beans—Beet-root—Cow-pox—Consumption—Exercise—Figs—Game—Lob∣sters—Manna-grass—Metallic Tractors—Millet—Oats—Oil—Olives—Parsnips—Rice—Sago—Salsafy—Salt—Skirret-root—Small-pox—Tamarinds—Vinegar,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>The quotations translated from Dr. Mead's "Medical Precepts," and inserted in the conclusion of these Lec∣tures, will be deemed interesting by every reflecting mind.</P>
<P>To this edition the Author has added a "<HI>Postscript,</HI>" to which he refers the Reader with respect to the limited design of the present book, and the practical tendency of a new work, "On the Dietetic Treatment and Cure of Diseases;" which will contain the farther application of these Lectures in a diseased state of the body.</P>
<P>With this view, he has thought proper to subjoin a se∣ries of <HI>Queries,</HI> addressed to those patients who are anx∣ious to give an accurate and satisfactory account of their disorder, when consulting medical men, especially if they cannot have the benefit of an interview.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of FOOD and DRINK;—their Quantity, Quali∣ty, Proportion to each other, Time of taking them, &amp;c.—Of SPICES.—A Classification of the most usual alimentary Substances, according to their individual Effect on Health.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>ALTHOUGH it be certain, that animal life could not be supported without food and drink, few individuals give themselves the trouble of reflecting, how the very important function of assimilating our aliment is accom∣plished. That office of the stomach, by which all living creatures are supported, deserves the attention of every inquisitive mind. Were I not confined in my plan to the relative salubri∣ty of Food and Drink, without entering into physiological disquisitions, how the digestive organs prepare and conduct the food from one stage to another, till it is converted into chyle, and from that into blood, I might amuse my readers with a variety of speculations and
<PB N="14" REF="039111_0337_1013A24C779F6140"/>
theories, none of which are fully established; but such digressions, however entertaining or gratifying to curiosity, would be of little ser∣vice, either in making the proper choice of al∣iment, or in ascertaining its wholesome or pernicious qualities.</P>
<P>If, in the early periods of society, when men subsisted upon roots, plants, and animal food, as they were promiscuously found, people did not reflect upon the relative salubrity of things, we have no right to censure them; as they often might have been starved, before they could have discovered their qualities. But if we, in our present state of knowledge, neglect such inqui∣ries; if we indiscriminately <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eed on whatever is presented to our palate; such conduct de∣serves severe animadversion. For, if man as∣sume the right of calling himself Lord of the Creation, it is a duty incumbent on him, to make himself acquainted with the nature and properties of those substances, which so essen∣tially contribute to animal existence.</P>
<P>Hence it may be justly asked, what are the constituent parts of aliment—how are they to be distinguished—are they of different kinds, or do they, with all the difference of form and taste, still manifest the same properties, powers, and effects—do they promiscuously supply all the parts of the human body, or are particular kinds of food more or less adapted to supply the wants of different parts of the body—and lastly, have all substances, we make use of as food, an equal share in this <HI>nutritive principle?</HI></P>
<P>Such are the questions, which must arise in every reflecting mind; and as the preservation
<PB N="15" REF="039111_0338_1013A19939D6CB10"/>
of the body depends so much on the manner in which the continual waste is supplied, it is a matter of the first consequence, to choose the substances which are most congenial to the different states and conditions of the body.</P>
<P>An eastern Dervise was once asked by a wealthy Mahometan, <Q>Of what service to society is an order of men, who employ themselves in speculative notions of divinity and medicine?—If you were more cau∣tious and temperate in your meals, an∣swered the Dervise; if you would learn to govern your passions and desires, by a due attention to abstinence, you all might be sages, and have no occasion for Dervises a∣mong you. But your appetite and aliment impair your understandings!</Q></P>
<P>In the consumption of food and drink we are liable to commit errors, both as to their quan∣tity and quality. The error in the quantity, however, is generally the most detrimental. A small portion of food can be better digested and more easily prepared into chyle, or that alimentary fluid, from which the blood derives its origin, than a large portion of food, which injures the coats of the stomach, and prevents them from exerting their force. Hence every satiety, or superfluity, is noxious.</P>
<P>It is in infancy, and early age, that the foun∣dation is laid for the many diseases arising from indigestion, which are now found in al∣most every family. If children are fed immod∣erately, and beyond the real wants of nature, the first passages become too much distended, and their stomach by degrees acquires an un∣natural
<PB N="16" REF="039111_0339_1013A15B9C4A62C8"/>
craving for food, which must be satis∣fied, whatever be the consequence. These ex∣cessive supplies not only are unnecessary, but produce the most serious and fatal disorders. There is a certain relation subsisting between what is taken in, and what is lost by the body: if we eat and drink much, we likewise lose much, without gaining any more by it, than we might do by moderate meals. For that which affords the alimentary particles, is as it were drowned by the current; and muscular energy is not only decreased, but in a great measure destroyed. Yet eating too little would be going to the opposite extreme, weaken the growth to bodily perfection, and eventually diminish the digestive power of the stomach, by depriving it of its due share of exercise and support.</P>
<P>Nature is easily satisfied, and is always best provided, if we do not intrude upon her more than she is accustomed to. If we have, for some time, taken little nourishment, nature be∣comes so habituated to it, that we feel indispo∣sed, as soon as the usual measure is transgress∣ed; and both the stomach and its digestive powers are thereby impaired.</P>
<P>The hardy countryman digests the crude and solid food, at which the stomach of the luxu∣rious citizen recoils. In order to strengthen the stomach, we ought not to withhold from it what keeps it in proper exercise. But, for this purpose, we should rather improve the quality, than increase the quantity of alimen∣tary substances. It is with this organ as with all other parts of the body: the more exercise
<PB N="17" REF="039111_0340_1013A19BDF2D1058"/>
we give it, the more strength and vigour it ac∣quires. Hence, it is highly improper to leave off eating food of difficult digestion, as some people are apt to do; for this is not the way of improving the energy of the body.</P>
<P>It would be a fruitless and impracticable at∣tempt, to lay down fixed rules, by which the respective salubrity or perniciousness of every species of aliment might be determined, in its application to the individual. It has been be∣fore observed, that such rules do not exist in nature; and that the particular state and con∣dition of the person, time, and circumstances, must serve as our guide. Hence it may be considered as a general rule, that all incon∣gruous mixtures and compositions, for instance milk and vinegar or other acids, or milk and spirits, are hurtful, by generating an acid and acrid whey in the stomach, and at the same time producing an indigestible coagulated mass.</P>
<P>Having premised these introductory re∣marks, I proceed to treat</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Food in particular.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. <HI>As to its quantity.</HI> A much greater num∣ber of diseases originate, upon the whole, from irregularities in eating, than in drinking; and, in the latter respect, we commit more frequent errors with regard to quantity, than quality: otherwise the heterogeneous mixture of provisions, with which we load our stom∣achs, would disagree with all. This indeed but too often happens. One who eats slowly,
<PB N="18" REF="039111_0341_1013A15D21EEAD10"/>
and a little only of a variety of dishes, will less injure his stomach than another, who eats immoderately of one or two favourite articles, and partakes of the others only for the sake of custom, or as a compliment paid perhaps to a fair hostess.—The gastric juice which is generated in the stomach, is capable of dis∣solving and digesting the most diversified ma∣terials, provided they be not unsuitably mix∣ed; and a perfectly healthy stomach can pre∣pare a chyle, or a milky fluid, of the same nourishing principle, from all eatable sub∣stances whatever.</P>
<P>The general rule then is, <HI>to eat as much as is necessary to supply the waste suffered by the body;</HI> if we transgress this measure, we produce too much <HI>blood;</HI> a circumstance as detrimental, though not so dangerous to life, as that of having too little. If we were never to tres∣pass the due limits of temperance, our natural appetite would be able accurately to deter∣mine, how much food we might consume, without diminishing our vivacity. But, from the usual physical education of children, this can scarcely be expected in adults. We ought therefore to pay strict attention to the state of those intestines, which serve to prepare the ali∣mentary fluid; and when these are in a relax∣ed or diseased state, we should instantly begin to be more moderate in eating.</P>
<P>There are three kinds of <HI>appetite:</HI> 1st, The <HI>natural</HI> appetite, which is equally stimulated and satisfied with the most simple dish, as with the most palatable; 2d, The <HI>artificial</HI> appetite, or that excited by stomachic elixirs, liqueurs,
<PB N="19" REF="039111_0342_1013A19F74714330"/>
pickles, digestive salts, &amp;c.; and which remains only as long as the operation of these stimu∣lants continues; 3d, The <HI>habitual</HI> appetite, or that by which we accustom ourselves to take victuals at certain hours, and frequently with∣out a desire of eating.—Longing for a particu∣lar food is likewise a kind of false appetite.—The <HI>true</HI> and <HI>healthy</HI> appetite alone can ascer∣tain the quantity of food proper for the indi∣vidual; if in that state we no longer relish a common dish, it is a certain criterion of its not agreeing with our digestive organs. If after dinner we feel ourselves as cheerful as before it, we may be assured, that we have taken a <HI>diet∣etical</HI> meal. For, if the proper measure be ex∣ceeded, torpor and relaxation will be the ne∣cessary consequence; our faculty of digestion will be impaired, and a variety of complaints gradually induced.</P>
<P>The stomach being distended by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>uent and violent exertions, will not rest sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>fied with the former quantity of food;—its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> will increase with indulgence in excess; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> temperance alone can reduce it to its natu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> state, and restore its elasticity. Fulness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> blood, and corpulency, are the disagreeable ef∣fects of too much eating; which progressively relaxes the stomach, and punishes the offender with headach, fever, pain in the bowels, diar∣rhoea, and other disorders.</P>
<P>The more suddenly this expansion takes place, the more forcibly and dangerously it affects the stomach; and its fibres, being too much extended, are the more sensible of the subsequent relaxation. Slow eating, therefore,
<PB N="20" REF="039111_0343_1013A160D4223C60"/>
preserves the fibres in a due state of elasticity. Hence, <HI>to eat slowly,</HI> is the first maxim in Di∣etetics: the stomach suffering in this case but a very gradual distension, as the food has suf∣ficient time to be duly prepared by mastication. He who observes this simple rule, will feel himself satisfied, only when he has received a due proportion of aliment. But he who swal∣lows his food too quickly, and before it is per∣fectly chewed, will imagine he has eaten enough, when the unmasticated provisions oc∣casion a sense of pressure on the sides of the stomach.—The teeth are designed by nature to grind our food, and to mix it with the sal∣iva, produced by innumerable glands, and destined to promote its solution.</P>
<P>A healthy appetite is also determined by the season, to the influence of which the stomach is exposed, in common with the other viscera. Hence heat, in general, relaxes and exhausts the body, from its tendency to dissipate the flu∣ids, or to diminish their quantity; and conse∣quently the stomach cannot digest the same portion of food in summer, which it does in winter. There are however persons, who have the strongest appetite, and possess the most vigorous digestive powers, in the extreme heat of summer. The bile of such individuals is of a watery consistence, and too sparingly se∣creted; a defect, which is best remedied by heat. Those who take more exercise in winter than in summer, can also direst mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> food. But as individuals leading a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> life usu∣ally suffer in winter from a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> state of diges∣tion, owing to a want of exercise, they ought to take less food in that season.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="039111_0344_1013A1A0FA3E5AC8"/>
We call those substances <HI>nutritive,</HI> which re∣store and supply what has been wasted. They conduct to the body homogeneous or assimi∣lated parts, by means of the intestinal canal, and by changing these parts into muscular substance or flesh, or into the fluid form of blood. Since some alimentary articles com∣municate their nutritive element sooner than others, as they contain coarser or more delicate particles, which according to their nature are more or less apt to be assimilated with the body, it follows, that all of them cannot be equally nourishing.</P>
<P>Too little aliment debilitates the body, which thereby acquires less than it loses by respiration; it hastens the consumption of life; the blood becomes inert and rarefied; or is rendered acrid and liable to putrefaction. Af∣ter long fasting the breath is fetid, and the an∣imal body becomes disposed to putrid fevers.—We can more easily digest a heavy meal, in four hours of accelerated respiration and mus∣cular action during the day, than in eight hours of sleep. This circumstance has led mankind to make their principal meal about the middle of the day. A person who sits up five or six hours after supper, will feel himself much more inclined to take a second <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to go to bed.</P>

<PB N="22" REF="039111_0345_1013A16259B2ACA0"/>
the vessels are not sufficiently supplied; their action on the whole mass of the blood, and of the blood on the several vessels, is interrupted; its free circulation is checked; and the small∣er vessels corrugate, so that the thinnest blood is no longer capable of pervading them, as is the case in old age. When a person has suf∣fered so much from extreme hunger, that his fluids are already in a putrescent state, much food must not be given him at once; for his contracted stomach cannot digest it. Such a body must be supported with liquid nourish∣ment, in small quantities, and be treated alto∣gether like a patient in a putrid or nervous fe∣ver. Hence, no animal food of any kind, but subacid vegetables alone, can be given with propriety.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>As to the quality of aliment,</HI> we must here investigate the nature of <HI>Digestion.</HI> This func∣tion may be aptly divided into two different▪ processes: <HI>Solution</HI> and <HI>Assimilation.</HI> Solution takes place in the stomach, where the food is changed into a pulp, where it is dissolved ac∣cording to its greater or less solubility, and where its nourishing particles are absorbed. Assimilation only begins, when the solution has already taken place in the stomach, when the nutritive substance, or the alimentary juice, is inhaled by the absorbent vessels, and con∣ducted to the blood, by means of the lacteals. Assimilation, therefore, is that function, by which the aliment is as it were animalized: and hence it has been conjectured, that animal food is easier digested than vegetable, as being more analogous to our nature, and more easily converted into animal fluids.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="039111_0346_1013A1A38E1FEBC8"/>
There are articles of easy and of difficult di∣gestion, in the animal as well as in the vegeta∣ble kingdom: in both we find some substances, which are completely indigestible, and which pass through the alimentary canal, without af∣fording any nourishment.</P>
<P><HI>The most simple dishes are the most nourishing.</HI> The multiplied combinations of substances, though they may please the palate, are not con∣ducive to health. All substances containing much jelly, whether animal or vegetable, are nourishing; for this alone affords nutriment; and the hard, watery, and saline particles of food cannot be assimilated or converted into chyle. Nourishing substances would, indeed, be more conformable to Nature; but, as our appetite generally incites us to eat somewhat more than is necessary, we should acquire too much alimentary matter, and become too full of blood, if we were to choose only such articles of food as contain a great quantity of jelly.</P>
<P>Dr. BUCHAN very justly observes, that <Q>the great art of preparing food is to blend the nutritive part of the aliment with a sufficient quantity of some light farinaceous substance, in order to fill up the canal, without over∣charging it with more nutritious particles than are necessary for the support of the ani∣mal. This may be done either by bread or other farinaceous substances, of which there is a great variety.</Q> Those, who are not employed in hard labour or exercise, do not require such nourishing food as those, whose nutritive fluids are in part consumed by mus∣cular exertions and violent perspiration.
<PB N="24" REF="039111_0347_1013A164ECDA8758"/>
Such as have suffered frequent losses of blood, from whatever cause, will best restore it by strong aliment; which, on the contrary, ought to be avoided by the plethoric. Those, lastly, whose frame is weakened and emaciated by irregularities and dissipation, should not at∣tempt to eat much at a time, but rather repeat their meals more frequently, at proper and regular intervals.</P>
<P>Whether we ought to make use of articles of easy or difficult digestion, cannot be deter∣mined by general rules: every person must attend to the effects, which substances of dif∣ferent degrees of digestibility produce on his stomach. The chyle, when prepared of sub∣stances not easily digestible, is solid and con∣centrated, and consequently affords a substan∣tial muscular fibre▪ but such substances as the stomach cannot digest, ought never to be used as food.</P>
<P>It is an important rule of diet, <HI>to eat if pos∣sible of one kind of meat only,</HI> or, at all events, <HI>to eat of that dish first which is the most palata∣ble.</HI> The stomach is enabled to prepare the best chyle from simple substances, and will thence produce the most healthy fluids. And if we follow the second part of this rule, we are in no danger of overloading the stomach. At a table dietetically arranged, we ought to begin with those dishes which are most diffi∣cult to be digested, and finish our meal with the most easy; because the former require stronger digestive powers, and more bile and saliva, all of which become defective towards the end of a heavy meal. The power of di∣gestion
<PB N="25" REF="039111_0348_1013A1A64D84C8F0"/>
in the stomach is undoubtedly most vigorous and active, when that organ is not too much distended; and the more coarse sub∣stances also require a longer time for being duly assimilated.</P>
<P>To begin meals, as the French, Germans, and Scots generally do, with <HI>soups</HI> or <HI>broths,</HI> is highly improper and noxious. These liquid dishes are ill calculated to prepare the stomach for the reception of solid food; as they not only weaken and swell it by their bulk and weight, but also deprive it of the appetite for the succeeding part of the dinner. Every tension is attended with relaxation, so that we imagine ourselves satisfied sooner than we are in reality. Besides, broths and soups require little digestion, weaken the stomach, and are attended with all the pernicious effects of oth∣er warm and relaxing drinks. They are ben∣eficial to the sick, to the aged, and to those who, from the want of teeth, have lost the power of mastication; but for such persons they ought to be sufficiently diluted, and not too much heated with spices;—otherwise they will be digested with some difficulty.</P>
<P>Many individuals are accustomed to spend the whole forenoon without breakfast, and feel no inconvenience from it, while others of a more delicate stomach could not bear such abstinence, without unavoidable cravings and debility. The business of digestion is usually accomplished within three or four hours after a meal; hence the stomach is empty at rising in the morning, and the body often enfeebled by long fasting. Our breakfast should there∣fore
<PB N="26" REF="039111_0349_1013A16686DE02C8"/>
consist of more solid and nourishing sub∣stances, than are now generally used for that meal; especially if our dinner is to be delay∣ed till the late hours which modern fashion prescribes. We should breakfast soon after we get up, dine about mid-day, and not pro∣tract the hour of supper till the time which Nature points out for rest.</P>
<P>A principal rule of diet is to take food with an easy and serene mind; hence it is prefera∣ble to dine or sup in company: our food has thus more relish, it agrees better with us, and we eat more slowly and cheerfully. But we ought not to indulge ourselves in sitting too long at table, which is a ways pernicious to health. For digestion takes place, even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we sit at table; and as the stomach, when gradually supplied, craves for additional quan∣tities of food, especially when a variety of pal∣atable dishes stimulates the appetite, we ought to be much on our guard against these seduc∣tions. Hence it is most advisable to make our dinner on one or two dishes; because we can eat more of a plurality of dishes than of one or two only, and do not so easily perceive when the stomach is overloaded.—To read, or otherwise exercise the mind, during the time of eating, is likewise improper.</P>
<P>Gentle exercise, before dinner or supper, is very conducive to increase our appetite, by pro∣moting the circulation of the blood. But too violent exercise impairs the appetite, and weakens the powers of the stomach, by means of its sympathy with the other parts of the body. In proof of this, we seldom see peo∣ple
<PB N="27" REF="039111_0350_1013A1A9F2A243D8"/>
worn out with fatigue able to partake of their usual repasts. The exercise, however gentle, ought to be over at least half an hour before dinner; because it is hurtful to sit down to table immediately after great fatigue.</P>
<P>As to our conduct <HI>after dinner,</HI> it is scarcely possible to give rules that are generally appli∣cable, and much less so to every individual. From the contradictory opinion of the most esteemed authors, they appear not to have discriminated between the various states and conditions of animal life; and as exercise was found to agree with some constitutions, and to disagree with others, a diversity of opinions necessarily arose among those who were so passionately fond of reducing every thing to general rules. In order then to remove these difficulties, I think it necessary to observe, that though it be apparently consistent with the instinct of nature to rest some time after dinner, according to the example of ani∣mals, yet this time, as well as other concur∣rent circumstances, deserves to be more pre∣cisely determined.</P>
<P>As soon as the food has entered the stom∣ach, the important office of digestion begins: the vigour of the organs exerted on this occa∣sion ought certainly not to be abridged by vio∣lent exercise; but muscular and robust people feel no inconvenience from gentle motion about <HI>one</HI> hour after the heaviest meal. On the con∣trary, it is highly probable that the abdominal muscles receive additional impetus, by exer∣tions of a moderate kind. But as the whole process of digestion is of much longer duration
<PB N="28" REF="039111_0351_1013A16A15BF90E0"/>
than is generally imagined, the afternoon hours cannot be employed advantageously to health, in any labor requiring strong exer∣tions.</P>
<P>The transition of the alimentary fluid into blood, which takes place in the third or fourth hour after a meal, and in some people of a weak and slow digestion much later, is always attended with some increase of irritability, which, in persons of great sensibility, may de∣generate into a painful sensation or illness. At this time, therefore, nervous and hypochon∣driac persons are frequently troubled with their usual paroxysms; they are seized with anguish, oppression, and an inclination to faint, without any external cause. Persons in this condition of body, as well as all febrile patients, and especially those who are troubled with stomachic complaints, would act ex∣tremely wrong and imprudent, to undertake any exercise whatever, before their victuals be completely digested; as during digestion all the fluids collect towards the stomach. In violent exercise, or in an increased state of perspiration, the fluids are forced to the ex∣ternal parts, and withdrawn from the stomach, where they are indispensable to assist the proper concoction.</P>
<P>As to the propriety of <HI>sleeping after dinner,</HI> we may learn from those animals, which sleep after feeding, that a little indulgence of this kind cannot be hurtful. Yet this again can∣not be established as a general rule among men. For the animals which sleep after food, are for the most part supplied with articles of
<PB N="29" REF="039111_0352_1013A1AB77EF5218"/>
so very difficult digestion, and so hard in their nature, that great digestive powers are required to convert them into alimentary matter. Hence this practice can be recommended only to the nervous and debilitated, to weakly persons in general, who are much employed in mental exercise, and are past the middle age—es∣pecially after a heavy meal, in hot weather, and warm climates.</P>
<P>Experience, however, teaches us, that, in this respect, a short sleep, of a few minutes only, is sufficient and preferable to one of longer duration; for, in the latter case, we lose more by an increase of insensible perspira∣tion, than is conducive to digestion.—But the position of the body is far from being a matter of indifference. The best is a reclined and not a horizontal posture, from which head-ach may easily▪ arise, when the stomach presses upon the subjacent intestines, and the blood is thereby impelled to the head. The old practice of standing or walking after dinner is so far improper, as it is hurtful to take exercise, while the stomach is distended by food, the sensation of which lasts at least for one hour.</P>
<P>In the primitive ages, people subsisted chiefly upon plants and fruits. Even to this day, many sects and whole nations, the Bra∣mins for instance, abstain from the use of an∣imal food. The ancient Germans, also, who were so renowned for their bodily strength, lived upon acorns, wood apples, four milk, and other productions of their then unculti∣vated soil. In the present mode of life, here as well as on the Continent, a great propor∣tion
<PB N="30" REF="039111_0353_1013A16DA3909188"/>
of the poorer class of country-people sub∣sist chiefly on vegetables; but although they duly digest their vegetable aliment, and be∣come vigorous, yet it is certain, that animal food would answer these purposes much better. Hence in countries where the labouring class of people live principally upon animal food, they far excel in bodily strength and duration of life.</P>
<P>A popular writer observes, that <Q>ani∣mal food is less adapted to the sedentary than the laborious, whose diet ought to consist chiefly of vegetables. In∣dulging in animal food renders men dull and unfit for the pursuits of science, espe∣cially when it is accompanied with the free use of strong liquors.</Q> This is so far true, but Dr. Buchan ought to have added, that the infirm, and those who labour under complaints of indigestion, will suffer still more from the use of vegetable substances, which by their pe∣culiar nature produce too much acid, and re∣quire stronger digestive organs, in order to be changed into a good alimentary fluid.</P>
<P>Dr. Buchan farther observes, that <Q>con∣sumptions so common in England, are in part owing to the great use of animal food.</Q> To this assertion no one will give his assent, who is acquainted with that class of men, who carry on the business of butchers, among whom it is as rare to hear of a consumptive person, as it is to find a sailor troubled with the hypochondriasis. I must quote another observation of this gentleman, to which I cannot implicitly subscribe. Having remark∣ed,
<PB N="31" REF="039111_0354_1013A1AE07AD02F8"/>
that the most common disease in this coun∣try is the scurvy; that we find a taint of it in almost every family, and in some a very deep taint, he says,—<Q>that a disease so general must have a <HI>general cause,</HI> and there is <HI>none so obvious,</HI> as the great quantity of animal food devoured by the natives. As a proof, that scurvy arises from this cause, we are in possession of no remedy for that disease equal to the free use of fresh vegetables.</Q> He likewise remarks, <Q>that the choleric dispo∣sition of the English is almost proverbial, and if he were to assign a cause of it, it would be their living so much on animal food;</Q> and finally, that <Q>there is no doubt but this induces a ferocity of temper un∣known to men, whose food is chiefly taken from the vegetable kingdom.</Q></P>
<P>There is much truth mingled with much fallacy in these assertions. I will allow, that animal food predisposes people to scorbutic complaints, and that it renders men more bold and sanguinary in their temper; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> there are a variety of other causes which produce a sim∣ilar effect. Nor are the English <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> choleric a people as the Italians and Tur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, both of whom, though sparing in the use of animal food, are uncommonly vindictive. It is farther not to be imputed to the consumption of flesh∣meat, or the want of vegetables alone, that the scurvy is so frequent in this country, both on land and at sea. There appears to me to exist a powerful cause, to which people pay very little attention, and from which the scurvy more frequently derives its origin than from
<PB N="32" REF="039111_0355_1013A170320E7400"/>
any other; the difference of food being in fact only a concurrent cause.</P>
<P>If we consider the very sudden and frequent changes of temperature in our climate; if we compare the present mode of living with that of our ancestors, who did not interrupt the di∣gestion of one meal by another, such as our rich luncheons in the forenoon, and our tea and coffee in the afternoon, when the digestive organs are, as it were, drowned in these favour∣ite liquids;—if, farther, we reflect upon the irregular manner in which our time of repose is arranged, so that we spend a great part of our life in the unwholesome night-air, partly at late suppers, and partly in the modern practice of travelling at night;—if all these cricumstanc∣es be duly weighed, we cannot be at a loss to dis∣cover a more general cause of scorbutic com∣plaints, than that of eating too much animal food.</P>
<P>After these reflections, it will not be diffi∣cult to comprehend, that the most important of the human functions is materially injured, by these habitual irregularities. I allude to the <HI>insensible perspiration</HI> which is so far from being encouraged and supported by such conduct, that the noxious particles, which ought to be evaporated, are daily and hourly repelled, a∣gain absorbed by the lacteals, and reconducted to the mass of the circulating fluids. Here they can produce no other effect than that of tainting the humours with acrimonious par∣ticles, and disposing them to a state of putres∣cency and dissolution, which is the leading symptom of scurvy. Upon the minutest in∣quiries among sea-faring people, as well as the
<PB N="33" REF="039111_0356_1013A1B10C0E1EE0"/>
inhabitants of the country, I have been in∣formed, that those individuals, who pay due attention to the state of their skin, by wearing flannel shirts and worsted stockings, and by not exposing themselves too often to night-air, or other irregularities, are seldom, if ever, trou∣bled with scurvy.</P>
<P>To return to the subject of animal food and its effects, it deserves to be remarked, that a too frequent and excessive use of it disposes the fluids to putrefaction, and, I believe in some sanguine temperaments, communicates to the mind a degree of ferocity. Nations living chiefly upon the flesh of animals, like the Tar∣tars, are in general more fierce than others; and the same effect is manifest in carnivorous animals: they emit a very disagreeable smell, and both their flesh and milk has an unpleasant and disgusting taste. Even a child will refuse the breast, when its nurse has eaten too much animal food. Those who eat great quantities of meat, and little bread or vegetables, must necessarily acquire an offensive breath. It ap∣pears, therefore, to be most suitable and con∣ducive to health, to combine animal with vege∣table food, in due proportions. This cannot be minutely ascertained, with respect to every individual; but, in general, two thirds or three fourths of vegetables, to one third or fourth part of meat, appears to be the most proper. By this judicious mixture, we may avoid the diseases arising from a too copious use of either. Much, however, depends on the peculiar prop∣erties of alimentary substances, belonging to one or the other of the different classes, which we have now to investigate.</P>

<HEAD>Of Animal Food.</HEAD>
<P>It may serve as a preliminary rule, that <HI>fresh meat</HI> is the most wholesome and nourishing. To preserve these qualities, however, it ought to be dressed so as to remain tender and juicy; for by this means it will be easily digested, and afford most nourishment.</P>
<P>The flesh of <HI>tame</HI> animals is, upon the whole, preferable to <HI>game;</HI> and although the latter be, in general, more mellow, and easier of diges∣tion, it does not contain the sweet jelly, and mild juices, with which the former is almost uniformly impregnated.</P>
<P>By the usual mode of dressing victuals, they lose a considerable part of their nutritious qual∣ity, and become thereby less digestible. <HI>Raw meat</HI> certainly contains the purest and most nourishing juice. We do not, however, eat raw flesh, but there are some substances which are frequently consumed in a state nearly ap∣proaching to that of rawness. Such are the Westphalia hams, Italian sausages, smoked geese, salted herrings, and the like.</P>
<P>Various modes of preparing and dressing meat have been contrived, to render it more palatable, and better adapted to the stomach. By exposure to the air, flesh becomes more soft, which obviously is the effect of incipient putrefaction; for, by this process, the volatile particles of ammoniacal salt are disengaged, and it is rendered more agreeable to the taste.
<PB N="35" REF="039111_0358_1013A1B4B2B80628"/>
Pickled and smoked meats,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is remarkable, that <HI>smoked meat</HI> is more readily digested in a <HI>raw</HI> than boiled state. Experience affords ample proof of this assertion, especially in the articles of smoked hams and sausages; for the soft gelatinous fluids which, by the joint processes of pick∣ling and smoking, have been effectually decomposed, or converted into a neutral substance consisting of ammoniacal salt combined with animal jelly, are completely extracted by boiling, so that lit∣tle more than the dry fleshy fibres remain behind.</NOTE> so commonly used in the northern and eastern countries of Eu∣rope, acquire an unnatural hardness, and com∣municate a great degree of acrimony to the flu∣ids of the human body. By <HI>boiling,</HI> flesh is de∣prived of its nourishing juice, as the gelatinous substance of the meat is extracted, and incor∣porated in the broth; and it is thus converted into a less nutritive and more oppressive bur∣den for the digestive organs; because the spirituous and balsamic particles are too much evaporated during the boiling. The <HI>broth</HI> indeed contains the most nourishing part of it, but it is too much diluted to admit of an easy digestion. A better mode of dressing meat is <HI>roasting,</HI> by which its strength is less wasted, and the spirituous particles prevented from evaporating; a crust is soon formed on its surface, and the nutritive principle better pre∣served. Hence, one pound of roasted meat is, in actual nourishment, equal to two or three pounds of boiled meat.</P>
<P>The boiling of animal food is frequently per∣formed in open vessels; which is not the best method of rendering it tender, palatable, and nourishing: close vessels only ought to be used for that purpose. The culinary process called <HI>stewing</HI> is of all others the most profitable and nutritious, and best calculated to preserve
<PB N="36" REF="039111_0359_1013A17460C0F6C8"/>
and to concentrate the most substantial parts of animal food.</P>
<P>When we expose articles of provision to the fire, without any addition of moisture, it is call∣ed <HI>baking.</HI> That such articles may not be too much dried by evaporation, they are usually covered with paste. Thus the meat, indeed, re∣tains all its nutritive particles, becomes tender and easily digestible; but the paste is the more detrimental to the stomach, as it generally con∣sists of an undue proportion of butter, which cannot be readily digested in that state. When meat is <HI>fried,</HI> it is in some degree deprived of its substance; but, if the fire be strong enough, a solid crust will soon be formed on its surface, by which the evaporation will be checked, and the flesh rendered mellow: the butter, or other fat used to prevent its adherence to the pan, gives it a burnt or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> taste, and renders its digestion in the stomach rather difficult.</P>
<P>Vegetables are, in general, not so readily di∣gested, as even hard and tough animal sub∣stances; which from their nature are more speedily assimilated to the body; but the flesh of young animals, with a proportionate quan∣tity of wholesome vegetables, is the diet best adapted to our system. The flesh of fattened cattle is by no means wholesome; these ani∣mals lead a sluggish and inactive life, and as they are surrounded in their dungeons by a bad and putrid air, they consequently do not afford fluids salutary for the stomach.</P>
<P>Though fat meat is more nourishing than lean, fat being the cellular substance of animal
<PB N="37" REF="039111_0360_1013A1B74434CC28"/>
jelly, yet to digest this oily matter, there is re∣quired, on account of its difficult solubility, a good bile, much saliva, and a vigorous stom∣ach. To prevent any bad effects, we ought to use a sufficient quantity of salt, which is an excellent solvent of fat, and changes it into a saponaceous mass.</P>
<P>Luxury has introduced an unnatural ope∣ration, which makes the flesh of certain ani∣mals at once delicate and nutritious; but the flesh of the same animals is still more whole∣some in their unmutilated state, before they have been suffered to copulate. The mucil∣aginous and gelatinous parts of animals alone afford nourishment; and according to the pro∣portion of these contained in the meat, it is more or less nourishing. We find mucilage to be a principal constituent in vegetable, and jelly or gluten in animal bodies: hence far∣inaceous substances contain the most of the former, and the flesh of animals most of the latter. A substantial jelly, as for instance that of calf's feet, is more nourishing than a thin chicken broth; but it is more difficult to be digested.</P>
<P>In summer, it is advisable to increase the proportion of vegetable food, and to make use of acids, such as vinegar, lemons, oranges, and the like; the blood being in that season much disposed to putresency. The man who contin∣ually takes nourishing food, is liable to become fat and plethoric; while on the contrary the parsimonious, or the religious fanatic, from their abstinence, become thin and enfeebled: hence the medium, or a proper mixture of both
<PB N="38" REF="039111_0361_1013A176EB0E6660"/>
vegetable and animal nutriment, seems to be most conducive to health. I cannot sufficient∣ly recommend the following caution to those who are frequently troubled with a craving appetite: the more food the stomach demands, it ought to be the more sparingly furnished with strongly nourishing substances, in order to avoid obesity, or fatness; and much vegetable food is in this case required, to counteract that disposition to putrescency, which the frequent eating of nutritive substances necessarily occa∣sions.</P>
<P>There are people who feel the sensation of hunger in a painful degree, which generally arises from too much acid being generated in the stomach. A vegetable diet would be prej∣udicial to such individuals; they ought to in∣crease the proportion of animal food; and dishes containing oily substances, in general, agree well with them. Bread and butter is useful to such persons, in order to neutralize their acid acrimony, and at the same time, to change the fat into a more soluble saponaceous substance. The cause of this acid is frequent∣ly a weakness in the stomach, which cannot be cured in any other manner, than by strengthening bitters, and articles of nourish∣ment that are mildly astringent, and promote warmth in the intestines; and in this respect, cold meat, as well as drink, is preferable to hot.</P>
<P>The jelly of animals being the very sub∣stance, which renovates the solid parts, is ob∣viously serviceable and necessary to nourish the human body. As, however, each kind of an∣imal
<PB N="39" REF="039111_0362_1013A1B8CB45F4B0"/>
has its peculiar jelly and fat, which can be nourishing only when assimilated to our na∣ture by the digestive organs; and as the differ∣ent parts of animals require different degrees of digestion, it will be necessary to enter into more minute inquiries, respecting these par∣ticulars.</P>
<P>Experience informs us, that the flesh and intestines of young animals afford a thin, easi∣ly digestible, and nutritive jelly. Old ani∣mals, hard and tough flesh, cartilages, sinews, ligaments, membranes, membranous thick in∣testines, and the sinewy parts of the legs, pro∣duce a strong and viscid jelly, which is diffi∣cult to be digested and assimilated to our flu∣ids. The more healthy the animal is, the stronger will be the jelly, and the more nour∣ishing its fluids. The most nutritious flesh is that of animals living in the open air, having much exercise and a copious mass of blood, and particularly, if they are kept in dry and warm places. The alkali contained in the flesh of carnivorous animals is the cause of the bad nourishment it affords, and of the injurious consequences attending its use. From the similarity in the structure of quadrupeds to that of man, it may be conjectured, that their jelly is similar to ours; that such as are fed upon milk give the best nourishment; and that the flesh of female animals is more easily digested, but less nutritious than that of the castrated males, which in every respect deserves the preference. After quadrupeds, we may class birds, in point of nourishment; then fishes; next to them amphibious animals; and lastly insects.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="039111_0363_1013A179C6939800"/>
As animal food is strongly nourishing, it generates blood, fat, and spirituous particles, in a much greater quantity than vegetable ali∣ment. The activity and courage of carnivo∣rous animals prove, that the feeding upon flesh gives spirit and strength, heats the body, and preserves the muscles in a lively state. For these reasons, much animal food is improper for those of a full habit and abundance of blood, for febrile patients, and those who are disposed to hemorrhages or losses of blood. The phlegmatic, on the contrary, and those of thin watery fluids, and a weak digestion, may with safety eat more animal than vegetable food.—Of the different kinds of flesh, game is most heating; that of young domestic ani∣mals least; for instance, of calves and chickens, particularly when they are eaten with vegetable substances containing an acid, such as sorrel, asparagus, &amp;c. That animal food disposes to putrescency, I have before re∣marked; hence it ought to be sparingly used in summer, and in hot climates. Persons, whose fluids already show a putrid tendency, and who are reminded of it by frequent erup∣tions of the skin, or who are already corpulent, should abstain from a too copious use of ani∣mal food.</P>
<P>I have also observed, that the flesh of carnivo∣rous animals has an extraordinary tendency to putrefaction, as is obvious from their fetid per∣spiration; that it contains an acrimony and al∣kalescency foreign to our nature; and that it does not afford mild nutriment. The flesh of gra∣nivorous animals, partaking more of the vegeta∣ble

principle, is less subject to putrefaction; and though it be less nourishing, and less abounding in spirituous particles than that of the former, yet it supplies us with a milder and more congenial aliment.</P>
<P>The flesh of fishes, being, like the element in which they live, most distinct from the nature of man, is of all others the least whole∣some and nutritive.</P>
<P>The tame quadrupeds that suck the moth∣er's milk, if they rest too much and are quick∣ly fed, do not afford a good and well-prepared food. In animals, which have tender mus∣cles and little exercise, those parts are probably the most wholesome which are more in motion than others, such as the legs and head.</P>
<P>Poultry furnishes us with the most valuable aliment, as it has excellent and well-digested fluids, from its more frequent exercise and constant residence in the open and pure air. Some animals, when young, have tough and spongy flesh, which is mollified and improved by age, and can be eaten only after a certain time, such as eels and carp. Others are hard when young, and must be used early, because that hardness increases with their age; as the haddoc, and many other species of fish. The flesh of old animals, that have less muscular parts than the young ones of the same spe∣cies, is indigestible; and we may lay it down as a general rule, that the more the flesh of an animal is disposed to putrefaction, it is the more unwholesome.</P>
<P><HI>Veal,</HI> although affording less nutriment than the flesh of the same animal in a state of ma∣turity,
<PB N="42" REF="039111_0365_1013A17D6B827D20"/>
contains many nourishing and earthy particles, and produces little or no disposition to flatulency: it ought, however, not to be brought to market, till the calf is at least six weeks old, and fed, if possible, on the mother's milk. Veal is not of a heating nature, and may therefore be allowed to febrile patients in a very weak state, especially with the addition of some acid;—it is also the most proper food for persons who have a disposition to hemorrha∣ges. On account of the great proportion it contains of viscidity, persons disposed to phlegm and complaints of the abdomen, ought to ab∣stain from its use. For these reasons, we rec∣ommend veal-broth, especially in pectoral and inflammatory diseases. The lungs, the liver, and the tongue of veal, are less viscous than the flesh; and being easily digested, soft, and mild, they are very proper for sick persons and convalescents. No animal fat is lighter than this; it shows the least disposition to putres∣cency; and it may therefore be used, in pref∣erence to any other, by persons of a scorbutic taint. The fat of veal should not be boiled; the operation of boiling softens its fibres too much, dissolves the jelly, and renders it unfit for digestion. But, by roasting, it becomes drier, and somewhat more solid; both the se∣rous and thick parts of the blood are incrassated in the external vessels, the fibres are dried up, and a crust is formed, beneath which the flu∣ids are moved, and changed into vapour, by the continued application of heat. In this op∣eration all the fibres lie, as it were, in a vapour∣hath, and are perfectly softened without losing
<PB N="43" REF="039111_0366_1013A1BEF91B1C30"/>
any of the jelly. Roasting, therefore, may be considered as the best mode of preparing this meat. Baking also forms a crust over it like roasting, but the fat incrassated by heat may occasion inconvenience, as it possesses an oily acrimony, and is with difficulty digested. For the same reason, it is improper to eat the burnt crust of any meat, of which some people are particularly fond, though it contains an empy∣reumatic oil, highly pernicious, and altogether indigestible by the stomach. For roasting, the mellow and juicy kidney-piece, or the breast of veal, deserves the preference: the leg is too dry and fibrous; it requires good teeth to be well chewed, renders the use of tooth-picks more necessary than any other dish, and is fre∣quently troublesome to the stomach. In short, veal does not agree well with weak and indolent stomachs, which require to be exercised with a firmer species of meat. When boiled, it is but slightly nourishing, and when we make a meal upon veal alone, we soon feel a renewal of the cravings of the appetite. For removing the acid from the stomach, veal is the most im∣proper article of diet. But to patients recov∣ering from indisposition, first may be given veal-broth, then roasted veal, and lastly beef; the properties of which we shall now consider.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A horrid custom has been introduced by luxury, of feeding calves cooped up in boxes so small as to prevent all motion, and from which light is totally excluded: by this cruel refinement their flesh is, by epicures, thought to be rendered more white and delicate; but if humanity does not revolt at this practice, those who have any regard for health should avoid the use of the flesh of an animal reared in this unnatural and putrescent state.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Beef</HI> affords much good, animating, and strong nourishment; and no other food is
<PB N="44" REF="039111_0367_1013A18000BB2240"/>
equal to the flesh of a bullock of a middle age. On account of its heating nature it ought not to be used, where there is already an abun∣dance of heat; and persons of a violent tem∣per should eat it in moderation. It is pecu∣liarly serviceable to hard-working men; and its fat is nearly as easily digested as that of veal.</P>
<P>It deserves, however, to be remarked, that the tongue, the intestines or tripe, and the sau∣sages made of beef are more difficult of diges∣tion than the muscular part; and that it would be extremely improper to give them to nurses, children, or lying-in women.</P>
<P>The meat of old bullocks, fed and kept in the stall, when unfit for labour, is scarcely di∣gestible; it is burdensome to the stomach, and contains, as well as that of old cows, (which is still worse) no wholesome fluids. Though beef be more frequently eaten boiled, yet it is more nourishing and digestible when roasted. Finally, beef is almost the only species of an∣imal food, with which the stomach is not ea∣sily surfeited, and which is in proper season throughout the whole year.</P>
<P><HI>Pork</HI> yields a copious and permanent nour∣ishment, which does not disagree with the ro∣bust and laborious, but which, from its abund∣ance of acrid fat, is not wholesome to persons of a weak stomach or sedentary life; as these animals live and are fed in sties without exer∣cise, and in an impure air. From the want of clean water, their flesh acquires a tough and strong consistence, and is indigestible but by a strong and healthy bile. Persons who have
<PB N="45" REF="039111_0368_1013A1C0835EF9E0"/>
impure fluids, and a tendency to eruptions, as well as those who have wounds or ulcers, should refrain from the use of pork; for this food will dispose them to inflammation and gangrene: it is equally improper in a catarrh∣al state of the breast, in weak stomachs, coughs, and consumptions.</P>
<P>The antient physicians considered pork as the best and most nutritious meat, if supported by proper digestive powers. But they were cer∣tainly mistaken in this supposition; for, al∣though its quality is such as renders a smaller quantity of it necessary to satisfy the cravings of the stomach, yet veal and beef, taken in in∣creased proportions, afford equal, if not more nourishment, and doubtless a more wholesome supply of animal jelly, than pork, under simi∣lar circumstances of the individual, would produce. By allowing these animals clean food, and the enjoyment of pure air and ex∣ercise, their flesh might be much improved in salubrity; but the farmer is little anxious about the quality of the meat, if he can pro∣duce it in greater quantity, which he is certain to obtain from the present unnatural mode of feeding swine. People of delicate habits may sometimes eat pork sparingly; but it is an er∣roneous notion that it requires a dram to assist its digestion; for spirituous liquors may in∣deed prevent, but cannot promote its solution in the stomach. It would be much better to drink nothing after pork for a short time, as it is usually very fat, and this fat is more subtle and soluble than any other, and has nothing in it of the nature of tallow.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="039111_0369_1013A18185AA3200"/>
Pork, eaten in moderation, is easily digested. With those whose digestive organs are weak, no other species of meat agrees in general so well, as a small quantity of this. Hence the objections made against it relate more to the quantity than to the quality or substance; for if it be eaten in too great quantity, it is apt to corrupt the fluids, and to produce acrimony. We ought therefore to eat it seldom and spar∣ingly, and the appetite which many people have for this food should be kept within mod∣erate bounds. The most proper additions to pork, are the accidulated vegetables, such as gooseberry or apple-sauce; which not only gratify the palate, but correct its properties, neutralize, in a manner, its great proportion of sat, and thus operate beneficially on the alimentary canal.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is little to be apprehended from the worms in swine, which, according to a late discovery of the celebrated Naturalist GÖTZE, in Germany, are natural to these animals. They reside in the cartilaginous vesicles of the liver, and when these vesicles burst in very hot weather, while the worms are yet extremely small, they pass into the blood with other fluids, and gradually increase in size. But there is no instance, that they have produced diseases, unless arising from disgust. Should it however, be found, that these animalculae become visible externally, and in great quantities, the butchers ought not to be permitted to kill such hogs, as the flesh easily a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ires an uncommon acrimony, is much disposed to putrify, and consequently, improper to be used as food.</NOTE></P>
<P>The flesh of <HI>wild hogs,</HI> as they have more exercise than the tame, and do not live upon substances so impure and corrupted, is more palatable, more easily digested, less tough, not so fat, and on account of their residence in the open air, is, like all game, purer, but more li∣able to putrefaction.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="039111_0370_1013A1C20750C5B0"/>
<HI>Smoaked hams</HI> are a very strong food. If eaten at a proper time, they are a wholesome stimulus to the stomach; but boiling them ren∣ders the digestion still more difficult.—In <HI>salt∣ing</HI> any kind of meat, much of its jelly is wash∣ed away, the fibres become stiff, and thus heavier for the stomach. The salt penetrates into the jelly itself, prevents its solution in the alimentary canal, and consequently makes it less conducive to nutrition.—By <HI>smoaking,</HI> the fibres of meat are covered with a varnish, the jelly is half burnt, the heat of the chimney oc∣casions the salt to concentrate, and the fat be∣tween the muscles to become rancid; so that such meat, although it may stimulate the palate of the epicure, cannot be wholesome.</P>
<P><HI>Sausages,</HI> whether fried or boiled, are a sub∣stantial kind of nourishment; they require, therefore, a strong bile to dissolve them, and a good stomach to digest them. They are not of an acrid nature, provided they have not too much pepper in their composition, and be close∣ly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illed, so as to contain no air. <HI>Blood Sau∣sages,</HI> usually called Black Puddings, consisting of bacon and coagulated blood, which is to∣tally indigestible, are a bad and ill-contrived article of food; and still more so, if they have been strongly smoked, by which process the blood becomes indurated, and the bacon more rancid: thus prepared, nothing can be more pernicious and destructive to the best fortified stomach. The spices usually added to sausa∣ges, correct, in some degree, their hurtful prop∣erties, but are insufficient to counteract the
<PB N="48" REF="039111_0371_1013A1840B8AC9C8"/>
bad and highly disagreeable effects of rancid substances.</P>
<P><HI>Bacon</HI> is chiefly hardened fat, accumulated in the cellular texture under the skin, and is of all meat the most unwholesome; it easily turns rancid in the stomach, or it is so already by long hanging, and is particularly pernicious to those who are subject to the heartburn.</P>
<P><HI>Lard,</HI> a softer fat collected from the entrails and the mesentary of hogs, becomes easily ran∣cid, and is otherwise relaxing to the digestive organs: for which reasons, it is seldom used in English cookery.</P>
<P>The <HI>mutton</HI> of sheep fed on dry pastures is a better and more nourishing food than that of others reared in moist places. Those also fed upon the sea-shore are excellent meat, the sa∣line particles which they imbibe giving at once consistency and purity to their flesh. The flesh of rams is tough and unpleasant, but that of ewes and still more that of weathers, is of a rich, viscous nature. Young mutton is juicy and easily digested, but it is rather tough, and has not that balsamic alimentary juice peculiar to sheep above a certain age. The best mut∣ton is that of sheep not less than three, and not above six years old. Under three years of age, it has not attained its perfection and flavour.</P>
<P>A roasting piece of mutton ought to be ex∣posed to the open air for several days, according to the weather and season; it affords then a palatable dish, which is easily digested, and agrees with every constitution. But the fat of mutton is almost indigestible; for it easily co∣agulates
<PB N="49" REF="039111_0372_1013A1C5B1CD2D10"/>
in the stomach, and oppresses that or∣gan: hence the lean part of mutton is more nourishing and conducive to health.—The feet of this animal are nourishing, on account of their jelly, and are of great service for injec∣tions, in those diseases which originate from acrimony in the intestines.</P>
<P><HI>Lamb</HI> is a light and wholesome food, not so nutritious as mutton, but extremely proper for delicate stomachs. The vegetables most prop∣er to be eaten with lamb are those of an acid∣ulated nature, as gooseberries, forrel, and the like. It is fashionable to eat this meat when very young; but a lamb that has been allowed to suck six months, is fatter and more muscu∣lar, and in every respect better, than one which has been killed when two months old, and be∣fore it has had time to attain its proper con∣sistency.</P>
<P><HI>House Lamb</HI> is a dish, prized merely because it is unseasonable. Like all animals reared in an unnatural manner, its flesh is insipid and detrimental to health.</P>
<P>The flesh of <HI>Goats</HI> is hard, indigestible, and unwholesome; hence the meat of kids only is esculent, being more easily digested, and yield∣ing a good nourishment.</P>
<P>The flesh of <HI>Deer (Venison),</HI> and that of <HI>Hare,</HI> contain much good nutriment; but, to the detriment of health, these animals are generally eaten when half putrified, though they are naturally much disposed to putrescen∣cy. When properly dressed, they afford a mellow food, and are readily assimilated to our fluids. But as wild animals, from their
<PB N="50" REF="039111_0373_1013A1869AE36088"/>
constant motion and exercise, acquire a drier fort of flesh than that of the tame, it should never be boiled, but always ought to be roast∣ed or stewed. From the same cause, the fluids of wild animals are more heating, and more apt to putrify, than those of the domestic. Persons, therefore, who already have a pre∣disposition to scurvy or other putrid diseases, should not eat much game, particularly in sum∣mer. This pernicious tendency of game may be corrected by the addition of vinegar, acid of lemons, or wine; salad also is very proper to be eaten with it. Those parts of wild ani∣mals, which have the least motion, are the most juicy and palatable: the back, for in∣stance, is the best part of a hare.</P>
<P>The <HI>lungs</HI> of animals contain nothing but air and blood-vessels, which are very tough, solid, difficult to be digested, and afford little nourishment. Besides, on account of the en∣cysted breath, and the mucus contained in them, they are in reality disgusting. The <HI>liv∣er,</HI> from its dry and earthy consistence, pro∣duces a vitiated chyle, and obstructs the ves∣sels; hence it requires a great quantity of drink, and ought never to be used by the plethoric: the blood-vessels and biliary parts adhering to it, are particularly disagreeable. The <HI>heart</HI> is dry, scarcely digestible, and not very nourishing. The <HI>kidneys</HI> also are acrid, hard, tough, and not easily digested by the delicate. These intestines, however, of young animals, such as calves and lambs, produce aliment sufficiently wholesome.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="039111_0374_1013A1C95C368CA8"/>
The <HI>fat</HI> and <HI>marrow</HI> of animals afford, in∣deed, solid and elastic alimentary juice, in∣crease the blood and fluids, but are difficult to be digested; they require a powerful stomach, perfect mastication, sufficient saliva and bile, and agree best with persons who take much bodily exercise. If not duly digested, they occasion diarrhoea, weaken the stomach and the bowels, stimulate too much by their un∣common acrimony, and easily turn rancid, especially when eaten together with meat much disposed to putrefaction. They are apt to de∣stroy the elastic power of the first passages, as well as of the whole body, to produce the heart-burn, cramp of the stomach, and head-ach, particularly in irritable habits, and, at length, to generate an impure and acrimoni∣ous blood.</P>
<P>The <HI>blood</HI> of animals is completely insoluble, consequently in no degree nourishing.</P>
<P>The <HI>milk</HI> is of very different consistence and properties, not only according to the different kinds and species of animals, but also in the same species, in consequence of the difference in feeding, constitution of body, age, time of milking, and so forth. Milk takes the lead among the articles of nourishment. It affords the best nutriment to persons whose lacteals and blood-vessels are too weak for deriving nourishment from other provisions; because it is already converted into an alimentary fluid in the intestines of an animal.</P>
<P>Nature has appointed this nutritive sub∣stance, milk, as the food of children; because infants, on account of their growth, require
<PB N="52" REF="039111_0375_1013A18A481EA8B8"/>
much nourishment. From this circumstance, we may also conclude, that milk is easily di∣gested by healthy stomachs, since at this early age the digestive powers are but feeble. Milk-porridge, however, as well as those dishes in the composition of which milk and flour are used, have a manifest tendency to obstruct the lecteals or milk-vessels of the intestines and the mesentary; a circumstance which renders them extremely unwholesome, particularly to chil∣dren. Milk, although an animal production, does not readily undergo putrefaction; as it is possessed of the properties of vegetable ali∣ment, and turns sooner <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> than putrid. It affords a substantial alimentary fluid; and hence it is of service to persons enfeebled by dissipation of disease.</P>
<P>As the milk of animals contains more cream than that of the human breast, it ought to be diluted with water, when given to infants. It combines both saccharine and oily particles, and is a very serviceable article of diet, in a putrescent state of the blood, in inveterate ul∣cers, and in the scurvy. It is well calculated to assuage rigidity, cramps, and pains, being a diluent and attenuating remedy, <HI>especially in the state of whey;</HI> it promotes perspiration and evacuation in general, and is highly beneficial in spitting of blood, hysterics, hypochondriasis, dysentery, inveterate coughs, convulsive affec∣tions, the putrid sore throat, and in complaints arising from worms. Milk is also used for fo∣mentations, baths, emollient injections, and washes for inflamed and fore parts. If intend∣ed as a medicine, it should be drunk immedi∣ately
<PB N="53" REF="039111_0376_1013A1CAE19B9B70"/>
or soon after it comes from the cow. Through boiling, and even by long standing, the best and most nutritious balsamic particles evaporate.</P>
<P>The milk to be employed for diet in diseases ought to be taken from healthy and well-nour∣ished animals; for we see in children how much depends on the health of the mother, and how suddenly they suffer from an un∣healthy or passionate nurse. In Spring and Summer, the milk is peculiarly good and whole∣some, on account of the salubrious nourish∣ment of herbs. In Winter it is much inferior. It is farther necessary, that the animal furnish∣ing the milk should be kept in the free air, and have daily exercise. In order to obtain good milk, it would be adviseable, for persons who have the opportunity, to keep a cow; for, be∣sides the adulteration of that which is sold, cows are frequently milked at an improper time, by which the milk is much injured, and cannot be wholesome.</P>
<P>The best milk is obtained from the cow at three or four years of age, about three months after producing the calf, and in a serene Spring morning. Good cow's milk ought to be white, without any smell; and so fat, that a drop be∣ing allowed to fall on the nail will not run down in divisions. It is lighter, but contains more watery parts than the milk of sheep and goats; while, on the other hand, it is more thick and heavy than the milk of asses and mares, which come nearest the consistence of human milk. Ewe's milk is rich and nour∣ishing; and it yields much butter, which is so
<PB N="54" REF="039111_0377_1013A18BCE12AD28"/>
unsavory, that it cannot be eaten. Both this and goat's milk produce much cheese, which is tough, strong, pungent, and difficult to be digested.</P>
<P>As goats are fond of astringent herbs, their milk is superior in strength to that of other animals; hence it has been sometimes used with the most happy success in hysteric cases. Goat's whey and ass's milk are chiefly used in pulmonary consumptions; where ass's milk cannot be got, that of mares may be used as a substitute.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Artificial ass's milk,</HI> not inferior in its properties to the natural, may be made by the following process▪—Take of eryngo-root or sea-holly, and pearl barley, each half an ounce▪ liquorice-root three ounces; water two pounds or one quart; boil it down over a gentle fire to one pint, then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ain it, and add an equal quantity of new cow's milk.</NOTE></P>
<P>Milk consists of caseous, butyraceous, and watery parts; that which contains a well-pro∣portioned mixture of the three, is the most wholesome. But this mixture is not always met with in due proportion—frequently the two first, namely, cheese and butter, predom∣inate; and in this case it affords indeed a strong food, but is difficult of digestion. If the water form the greatest proportion, it is then easily digested, but less nourishing. This is particularly the case with ass's milk, which, more than any other, affects the urine and stool, while it has a tendency to purify the blood.</P>
<P>On account of the warmth, and the mechan∣ical process of the digestive organ, joined to the chemical properties of the acid generated in it, milk necessarily coagulates in every stom∣ach. The caseous part is dissolved, and dilut∣ed
<PB N="55" REF="039111_0378_1013A1CC65C18AE8"/>
by the admixture of the digestive liquors, and thus prepared for being changed into a pure chyle or milky fluid. Indeed, it makes no difference, whether we take cream, cheese, and whey in succession, or whether we consume them united in the mass of the milk: in the former case, the separation takes place without, and in the latter within the stomach.</P>
<P>It is however improper to eat acid substan∣ces together with milk, as this mass would oc∣casion fermentation and corruption: while, on the contrary, the natural coagulation is on∣ly a separation of the constituent parts, not a transition of this mild fluid into the stage of acid fermentation; for this is prevented by the saponaceous digestive liquors, though the milk itself be coagulated.</P>
<P>Yet milk is not a proper food for the debil∣itated, in all cases; nay, under certain cir∣cumstances, it may even be hurtful. It does not, for instance, agree with hypochondriacs; as it occasions cramp of the stomach, cholic, heartburn, and diarrhoea. Febrile patients, whose weak organs of digestion do not admit of nutritive food, and whose preternatural heat would too easily change the milk into a rancid mass, must abstain from it altogether. It disagrees also with the plethoric, the phleg∣matic, and the corpulent; but particularly with tipplers, or those addicted to strong spir∣its. Its butyrous and cheesy parts may ob∣struct digestion and oppress the stomach.</P>
<P>Lastly, <HI>sour milk</HI> is unfit for use, on account of the chemical decomposition which has taken place in its constituent parts, and because it
<PB N="56" REF="039111_0379_1013A18EA3A37D48"/>
can hardly be digested by the most powerful stomach: even sweet milk ought not to be eaten together with flesh meat, and in most cases the whey is preferable to the milk.</P>
<P>With these exceptions, milk is an excellent species of diet, which does not require strong digestive organs, unless a variety of other sub∣stances be eaten along with it. On the con∣trary, persons much reduced in bodily vigour have received benefit, and in a great measure been cured, by eating milk only. We daily observe that children at the breast, with the natural inclination to acidity and viscosity, feel its bad effects only, when, together with milk, they are fed upon cakes, pastry, ginger∣bread, and other trash. Milk being free from all acrimony, produces wholesome, light, and sweet blood. Sugar and salt are almost the only proper spices to be added to it.</P>
<P><HI>Cream</HI> is exceedingly nourishing, but too fat and difficult to be digested, in a sedentary life.</P>
<P><HI>Butter</HI> possesses at once all the good and bad properties of expressed vegetable oils; it is the sooner tainted with a rancid bitter taste, if it be not sufficiently freed from the butter∣milk, after churning,—Bread and butter re∣quire strong and well-exercised powers of di∣gestion.—It is a most pernicious food to hot∣tempered and bilious persons, as well as to those of an impure stomach. The good qual∣ity of butter is marked by a very fat shining surface, yellow colour, agreeable flavor, and sweet taste.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am disposed to think it would be beneficial to society, if▪ the making of <HI>butter</HI> were strictly prohibited, as well as the impor∣tation of salt butter into every civilized country, where the hurt∣ful properties of it are sufficiently understood.—<HI>Melted fat,</HI> or the <HI>drippings</HI> of baked and roasted meat, is equally, if not more per∣nicious to the stomach, than even stale butter, and both ought to be used only for greasing cart wheels, and not for injuring human organs.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="039111_0380_1013A1D03AFF4D50"/>
<HI>Butter-milk</HI> is a species of whey, but con∣tains a great number of butyrous particles. If we drink it while new and sweet, it is refresh∣ing and cooling.</P>
<P>Before I quit the subject of milk, I cannot omit remarking, that this fluid, besides the qualities before enumerated, contains some spirituous parts, <HI>in a latent-state,</HI> with which our chemists are little acquainted. And al∣though these parts cannot be disengaged from the milk, and exhibited in a separate form, yet it is certain, that the Persians, and other inhabitants of the East, prepare a kind of wine from milk, which possesses all the prop∣erties of intoxicating liquors. Such is the report of respectable travellers; but I am in∣clined to suspect, that these Orientals make some addition to the sweet whey, after the caseous parts are separated from it, by which they induce a vinous fermentation. Wheth∣er they add honey, sugar, or any mucilagi∣nous vegetable, containing the saccharine principle, I shall not attempt to decide: but it is well known, that the Chinese ferment and distil a liquor from a mixture of rice and veal, which is not unpleasant when new.</P>
<P><HI>Cheese</HI> is obtained from the tough part of the milk, which subsides in coagulation, and which must be completely freed from the whey. All cheese is difficult to be digested,
<PB N="58" REF="039111_0381_1013A1903960D7C0"/>
being the coarsest and most glutinous part of the milk, which the healthy and laborious on∣ly can concoct in their stomach. To others, it is too heavy; it imparts a thick and acrid chyle to the blood; it hardens in a weak stomach, and accumulates an indurated earthy lump. When eaten new, in any considerable quantity, it corrupts▪ the fluids; and if old, it becomes putrid. In small quantities after dinner, it can do no great harm, but it is ab∣surd to suppose that it assists digestion; its effects, at best, being of a negative kind, that is, by producing a temporary stimulus on the stomach: and even this is the case only with sound old cheese which is neither too fat, nor too far advanced in the process of putrefaction.</P>
<P>Toasted cheese, though more agreeable to some palates than raw, is still more indigesti∣ble. Cheese, if too much salted, like that of the Dutch, acquires, when old, a pernicious acrimony. The green Cheese of Switzerland, which is mixed with a powder of the wild Melilot, or the <HI>Trifolium Melilotus,</HI> L., and the milder Sage-Cheeses prepared in Eng∣land, are the almost only kind which may be eaten without injury; and even these should be used in moderation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To show the strongly viscid quality of cheese, and what powers of digestion it must require to assimilate it to our fluids, I shall mention a composition which may be useful, as the strongest cement yet contrived, for mending china cups, glasses, and the like. A piece of Cheshire or Gloucester cheese is boiled in three or four different waters, till it form a soft and elastic mass, freed of the whey and other extraneous ingredients. After having ex∣pressed all the water from this mass, and while yet warm, it must be gradually rubbed upon a piece of marble, such as is used by colour-men; and as much unslacked or quick-lime in powder must be added, as will be absorbed by the cheese, without making it too hard. This compound forms the strongest possible ce∣ment; if allowed to dry slowly, it is able to withstand fire as well as water.</NOTE></P>

<HI>Birds,</HI> as they move in the purest and most healthy atmosphere, possess the best prepared and most wholesome alimentary substance; yet the flesh of birds, though more easily di∣gested, is less nourishing than that of quadru∣peds; as on account of their constant exercise the whole winged tribe have drier muscles, consequently a less nutritious juice. Those birds particularly, which subsist upon worms, insects, and fishes, are not wholesome; and if they frequent swampy and filthy places, their flesh will afford meagre and impure nourish∣ment.</P>
<P>Some parts of fowls are less wholesome than others. The wings of those whose prin∣cipal exercise is flying, and the legs of those that generally run, are the driest parts of their bodies: hence the breast is, in all, the softest and most nutritive part. Young poultry is preferable to that of some years old, which have very tough muscles, and are heavier to the stomach.</P>
<P>Birds living upon grain and berries are in all respects the best; next, those feeding upon insects; and last of all, that class of birds which preys and subsists upon fishes. These indeed, like all other animals, whose proper food is flesh, are eaten only by savage nations, wild and tame ducks and geese excepted; which, by their strong flesh, and the inclina∣tion
<PB N="60" REF="039111_0383_1013A21A0864C9D8"/>
of their fluids to putrescency, are less wholesome than any other bird. Water fowl afford the least beneficial food. In general we find winged animals out of season in Spring; partly because most of them are then pairing, and partly on account of the long journeys of those that are birds of passage, by which they become leaner than at any other time of the year; yet some birds of passage do not arrive in this climate till towards Autumn.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that most birds, when tak∣en from their wild state, and fed in captivity, such as partridges, larks, and others, lose much of their peculiar flavour, which is also the case with wild quadrupeds. Yet those tame and domesticated fowls and animals, that are well fed in yards and stalls, are gen∣erally more fat and muscular than those which are obliged to seek their own food. Old fowls are the most serviceable for broth; or they might be boiled in close vessels, where they can macerate for some hours, till they are com∣pletely softened by the steam. Fowls lose much of their fine flavour, if boiled; they are therefore best roasted, except the smaller kinds, which ought to be baked.</P>
<P>All birds living upon grain and berries afford good nutriment, except geese and ducks. The flesh of the goose is unwholesome, especi∣ally when fed in small inclosures, without exercise; which practice is sometimes carried so far, as cruelly to n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il the animal to a board through the feet, to prevent its motion. Its fat is almost totally indigestible: its flesh pro∣duces a very obvious and bad effect upon
<PB N="61" REF="039111_0384_1013A1D582B26248"/>
wounds and ulcers. It is also pernicious to those who are disposed to inflammatory diseases, and to cutaneous eruptions.—A young hen, or chicken, is a very wholesome dish; its veg∣etable aliment produces a mild and sweet chyle; and the whiteness of its flesh shows its excellent quality. As it is easily digested, it is a dish to be recommended to the weak and de∣bilitated; and it agrees best with individuals of an acrid and mucous tendency, or such as are troubled with biliary and stomachic disorders.</P>
<P>The Capon is one of the most delicate dish∣es; if eaten when young, he yields a strong and good chyle; his flesh is not of a heating nature, is not disposed to putrescency, and the fat itself is easily digested. Turkeys, as well as Guinea or India fowls, yield a strong ali∣ment, but are more difficult of digestion than the capon; particularly the legs, wings and fat. These birds, when roasted, are usually filled with some kind of heavy pudding, which is a favourite morsel with many, but requires the strongest digestive powers.—The old prej∣udices, that the flesh of capons is productive of the gout, and that of sparrows brings on epileptic fits, are too absurd to require refuta∣tion.</P>
<P>Among the birds subsisting on insects, there are few eaten, except the various kinds of snipes and starlings. All of them, without ex∣ception, consist of hard, unsavoury, and scarce∣ly digestible flesh.</P>
<P>It would be useless to enumerate the vari∣ous birds living upon fish, which are eaten in other countries. They all have a taste of fish,
<PB N="62" REF="039111_0385_1013A21CBAA17DB0"/>
and afford a poor aliment. The ducks and geese only are eaten in Britain: of these the former afford the better nourishment, as they are generally not so abundantly fat as the lat∣ter, and are permitted to move about in the open air. But they ought not to be suffered to repair to stagnant waters, which they swal∣low, and which taint their fluids and flesh with qualities detrimental to health.</P>
<P>Next to milk, no nutriment is so simple and salutary as that of bird's <HI>eggs,</HI> among which those of hens justly deserve the preference, in respect of nourishment, taste, and digestion. The albumen, or the white of eggs, corres∣ponds to our serum, or the water of the blood; it is dissolved in a warm temperature, but considerable heat makes it hard, tough, dry, and insoluble. The yolk of eggs is more soluble, contains much oil, and is uncommon∣ly nourishing, but has a strong tendency to putrefaction: hence eggs must be eaten while fresh. People of a weak stomach ought to eat no kind of food easily putrescible, consequent∣ly no eggs. To those, on the contrary, who digest well, a fresh egg, boiled soft, (or rath∣er stewed in hot water, from five to ten min∣utes, without allowing it to boil) is a very light, proper, and, at the same time, nour∣ishing food.</P>
<P>Hard-boiled eggs, fried eggs, pan-cakes, and all artificial preparation of eggs, are heavy on the stomach, corrupt our fluids, and are unwholesome. The eggs of ducks and geese ought not to be eaten, but by persons of the most active and powerful stomachs. All eggs
<PB N="63" REF="039111_0386_1013A1D80DDFB648"/>
require a sufficient quantity of salt, to promote their solution in the digestive organ; yet but∣ter renders them still more difficult of di∣gestion: hence it is equally absurd and perni∣cious to use much butter, with a view to soften hard boiled eggs. We cannot be too circum∣spect in the use of eggs, as to their freshness; for there are examples, of persons, after hav∣ing used corrupted, or only tainted eggs, being seized with putrid fevers.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Various modes of preserving eggs have been contrived in domestic life. To prevent the external air from pervading the egg, is the principal requisite. With this intention some smear them with butter, others pack them in bran or common salt; the farmers in Germany suspend them in fresh river-water, by means of a net; but all these methods are troublesome and uncertain. The best way of preserving them to any length of time, is to place them in a very strong lime-water, to leave some lime at the bot∣tom of the vessel, and if the water should become turbid, to pour it off and supply it with a fresh infusion. This may be done with boiling water, to dissolve more of the lime; but it must be allowed to become perfectly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old before the eggs are placed in it.</P>
<P>I shall here take notice of a method lately contrived to preserve animal and vegetable substances, to almost any length of time, without salting or pickling. A Mr. DONALDSON has obtained his Majesty's Letters Patent, for inventing a powder, which is said to possess the extraordinary virtues of preserving the flesh of ani∣mals, as well as vegetable roots, to an indefinite length of time. If this be true, (though I am much inclined to doubt it) it is easy to conceive how the Egyptian mummies could be preserved for several thousand years. Our East and West India vessels may now save themselves the trouble of taking live stock on board.</P>
<P>In order to afford an opportunity of judging of the merits of Mr. Donaldson's powder, or of giving it a fair trial, I shall briefly state its component parts, as recorded in the Patent—Any quan∣tity of vegetable gum, such as Gum Arabic, or that of cherry-trees, in fine powder, is mixed with an equal quantity of fine flour of wheat or barley: this is made into a paste, and baked in an oven, contrived for that purpose, with a very gentle heat, so as to pre∣vent it from forming a crust. The dry mass is again reduced to a sine powder, and this is the great and astonishing <HI>preservative.</HI>—Either animal or vegetable substances surrounded with this pow∣der, and packed in close boxes in that state, according to the pro∣fessions of the Patentee, keep fresh, and free from corruption, for almost any length of time.—<HI>Relata refero.</HI></P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="039111_0387_1013A220A4962E30"/>
<HI>Fish,</HI> though of a tender flesh, afford upon the whole but a weak nourishment. They are more or less difficult to digest, according to the different kinds of water in which they live. Being of all animal substances the most pu∣trescible, they are much inferior in quality to birds and quadrupeds, on which account they ought not to be eaten by febrile patients and convalescents. Their fat is still more in∣soluble and indigestible than that of other an∣imals, and readily turns rancid. On account of their indifferent qualities, no satiety is more noxious than that of fish.</P>
<P>Acid sauces and pickles, calculated to resist putrefaction, render fish somewhat better, and more wholesome for the stomach, while butter has a tendency to prevent digestion, and to promote the corruption of their flesh. On the contrary, spice and salt, used in moderate quantities, stimulate the fibres of the stomach to exert their action, and facilitate the digest∣ive process.</P>
<P>Fish dried in the open air, and afterwards boiled soft, are easily digested; but all <HI>salted</HI> sea-fish, as well as smoked fish, are injurious to the stomach, and afford little nutrition. The same remark, though in an inferior de∣gree, applies to fish preserved in vinegar and spice. In general, the heads and tails con∣taining the least fat, are the lightest parts for digestion, as on the contrary the belly is the heaviest. Such as have a tender flesh are sooner digested than those of a hard and tough consistence.</P>
<P>The soft and mucilaginous fishes, like the eel, are partly composed of an oily slime, part∣ly
<PB N="65" REF="039111_0388_1013A1DBEAA3EC90"/>
of tough fibres, and are consequently not easily digested. Those living in ponds, ditch∣es, and other standing waters, are certainly less wholesome than river fish, whose exercise is greater, and whose natural element is purer. For standing water easily putrifies, and the fish lodging in the mire of such reservoirs, contin∣ually feed upon the putrid parts. But the same kind of river fish is also of different qual∣ities, according to their different nourishment. Thus, those caught in rivers contiguous to great towns, are less salubrious than others; because they necessarily receive great quanti∣ties of the impurities thrown into such rivers.</P>
<P>Salt-water fish are perhaps the best of any, as their flesh is more solid, more agreeable and healthy, less exposed to putrescency, and less viscid. These excellent qualities they possess when fresh; when salted, they have all the properties of salt-flesh, and consequently its disadvantages. With respect to <HI>herrings,</HI> it is certain, that of all the sea-fish they are most easily digested: and salt-herrings, in particu∣lar, if eaten in small quantities, dissolve the slime in the stomach, stimulate the appetite, create thirst, and do not readily putrify by long keeping.</P>
<P>Among the <HI>amphibious animals,</HI> the legs of frogs are in some countries esteemed a delicate dish; yet, as they contain a large portion of fat, the stomach cannot easily digest them, without the addition of much salt. The same observation applies to the Turtle, as well as the West-Indian Guana, a species of Lizard, two or three feet long, of a most forbidding ap∣pearance;
<PB N="66" REF="039111_0389_1013A22273048430"/>
but its flesh is delicate and salu∣brious, much resembling that of a chicken.—We also eat lobsters and crabs, which are species of water-infects: as both of them, how∣ever, generally arrive at a stage approaching to putrefaction, before they are sold in inland towns, their consumption is attended with con∣siderable danger. Besides, the flesh of lobsters, in particular, is not easily digested, as it pos∣sesses a peculiar acrimony, which in swallow∣ing sometimes occasions pain in the throat. Some people, it is said, have been affected with eruptions of the skin, pain in the stom∣ach, and rheumatisms, arising from the use of lobsters. Their jelly, however, is mild and nourishing.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The flesh of <HI>river lobsters</HI> is more delicate than that of the sea-lobster; but it is at the same time more subject to putrefac∣tion, and ought therefore to be used in a fresh state, with much salt or vinegar. In Germany and other parts of the Continent, lake and river-lobsters are always boiled alive, and generally in milk: a dish much esteemed in families, and of which children are particularly fond.—The Germans cook various species of fresh-water-fish in milk: and although palatable dishes may thus be prepared, yet, on account of the incongruous variety of sub∣stances, I cannot approve of the mixture. There is, however, a method of obtaining from lobsters a very excellent and wholesome jelly, the particulars of which I shall here communicate to the reader, upon the authority of a respectable physician at Ham∣burgh. "Take the flesh of about thirty river-lobsters sufficiently boiled; cut it in small pieces, and place it in a capacious earthen vessel, over a gentle fire, with one ounce of fresh butter. After the butter is completely absorbed, add the clean flesh and skin o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> two calves' feet, and four quarts of pure soft water. These in∣gredients must be simmered over a moderate fire, till the whole of the mass amount to rather more than one quart. In that state, half a drachm of powdered nutmeg, and a handful of chervil, must be added; and after having allowed it to boil up again, the purest part of this mass is to be pressed through a strong linen cloth. When placed, for some hours, in a cellar or some other cool place, it forms a strong jelly, two of three spoonfuls of which will impart uncommon richness and flavour to a basonful of com∣mon veal or chicken broth."—I make no doubt that a similar jel∣ly may be prepared of small sea-lobsters, if they can be had alive.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="039111_0390_1013A1DD6F8DA908"/>
Oysters are eaten both raw, and dressed: when raw, they are in every respect preferable; for, by cooking, they are deprived of the salt-water which promo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> their digestion in the hu∣man stomach, as well as of a great proportion of their nourishing jelly. Raw oysters are easily digested, and may be eaten, with great advantage, by the robust, as well as by the weak and consumptive; as this shell-fish pos∣sesses more nutritive animal jelly than almost any other. They farther are generally at∣tended with a laxative effect, if eaten in any quantity: hence they afford an excellent sup∣per to those liable to costiveness.</P>
<P><HI>Snails,</HI> though seldom eaten in this coun∣try, are equally nourishing and wholesome. On account of their gelatinous nature, they have lately been much used against consump∣tions; and as these complaints are now very frequent in Britain, it were to be wished that such patients may give this remedy a fair tri∣al, by boiling a dozen of the red garden∣snails every evening in a quart of sweet milk or whey, for half an hour, then straining the liquor through a coarse cloth, and drinking it with sugar every morning gradually upon an empty stomach; and repeating these draughts for a month or two, if required. This red garden-snail (or the <HI>Helix Pomatia,</HI> L.) has also been used externally in the open hem∣orrhoids, where fresh snails were applied, every two or three hours, in a raw state, with remarkable success.</P>
<P>Muscles are of a more solid texture, and therefore not so easily digested as oysters. The sea-muscles afford a hard, indigestible,
<PB N="68" REF="039111_0391_1013A22524B32058"/>
and, as some imagine, poisonous food. Al∣though the examples of their deleterious na∣ture be very rare, yet they ought not to be eaten without vinegar, or some other vegeta∣ble acid, acting as a corrector of their bad qualities, or, in the opinion of others, as an antidote.</P>

<HEAD>Of Vegetable Aliment.</HEAD>
<P>The various articles of nourishment we derive from the Vegetable Kingdom, may with propriety be divided into five orders:</P>
<P>1st, The different species of farina, or grain, such as wheat, rye, barley, and oats.</P>
<P>2d, The legumes, or pulse, such as peas, beans, &amp;c.</P>
<P>3d, The various kinds of salads and pot∣herbs.</P>
<P>4th, All the different roots; and,</P>
<P>5th, Fruit, or the production of trees and shrubs.</P>
<P>The first of these, namely the farinaceous, are very nourishing, on account of the copious mucilage they contain; but they are likewise difficult to digest. Bread itself, though justly called <HI>the staff of life,</HI> if eaten too freely, or to serve as a meal, produces viscidity or slime, obstructs the intestines, and lays the founda∣tion of habitual costiveness. All dishes pre∣pared of flour, are not only nourishing, but are emollient, attenuating, and correct acrimony. Leavened bread, or such as has acquired an acidulated taste by a slow fermentation of the dough, is cooling and antiseptic; a circum∣stance
<PB N="69" REF="039111_0392_1013A1DEF4FF7970"/>
well established by experience. By this process of preparing the dough, all the tough parts are most intimately mixed with the drier parts of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>our, and the fixed air is expelled in baking. New-baked bread always contains much of an indigestible paste, which is reme∣died, either by allowing it to dry for two or three days, or by toasting it. This ought to be done regularly, particularly in times of scarcity, both on account of health and econo∣my. Stale bread, in every respect, deserves the preference: and persons troubled with flat∣ulency, cramp of the stomach, and indigestion, should not upon any account eat new bread, and still less hot rolls and butter. Indeed, all pastry whatever is unwholesome, especially when hot. Those who devour hot pies with avidity, should consider, that they contain an uncommon quantity of air, which distends the stomach, and produces the most alarming and dangerous cholics, and incurable obstructions, insomuch that the stomach and bowels have been known to burst. The porous quality of bread arises from the fixed air having been ex∣pelled in baking; and the more spongy the bread, it is the more wholesome. But new∣baked bread, and rolls in particular, require a sound stomach; because they contain much mucilage, not having parted with all their moisture; and wheat-flour is more viscid than that of rye, which is the bread-corn of most nations on the Continent.</P>
<P>Bread and butter, together with cheese, as they are eaten in Holland and Germany, form a mass scarcely digestible. The external sur∣face
<PB N="70" REF="039111_0393_1013A227C21376B0"/>
of bread, or the crust, which has been more dried by the heat of the oven, is easiest digested; it contains the empyreumatic part, expelled by fire from the flour; it produces an emollient effect on the bowels; but, at the same time, is more heating and less nourishing than the softer part, or crumb.</P>
<P>The great difference in bread is owing, partly to the different species of grain from which it is made, partly to the time the flour has been kept; for, when new, it is more dif∣ficult to deprive it of its tenacity; partly to its being more or less cleaned from the bran; partly to the different methods of fermenting and baking it; to the difference in the water with which the flour has been kneaded; and lastly, to the various ingredients of which the paste has been compounded. The softness of the mill-stones used in grinding the flour, may also vitiate the bread, by introducing particles of sand and marble, so as to make it equally noxious to the teeth, and oppressive to the stomach. Well-baked, and thoroughly dried bread, is easily dissolved by water, without rendering it viscid or gelatinous: hence it is well adapted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or the use of the debilitated, as well as for every age or temperament.</P>
<P>Hasty-pudding, on account of its tenacity, and the quantity of mucilage it contains, is not so easily digested as people, who feed their infants upon this dish, are apt to imagine. Porridge made of oatmeal, the common food of children and the lower class of adults in Scotland, is not so heavy as that of wheat flour; though both of them require vigorous diges∣tive
<PB N="71" REF="039111_0394_1013A1E18D41F778"/>
organs, robust constitutions, and strong exercise, in order to produce a proper nutri∣ment.</P>
<P>The <HI>vermicelli,</HI> and <HI>macarone</HI> of the Italians, as well as all the different dishes made of flour mixed up into paste, and either boiled in water or stewed in butter, are ill calculated for patients and convalescents, to whom they are frequently administered. A paste, when it is so elastic that it can be formed into balls, is extremely difficult to be digested. All unfermented pastry is excessively trying to the stomach; and instead of wondering that the lovers of such dainties are continually troubled with indigestion and other stomachic com∣plaints, it would be against the order of things if it were otherwise.</P>
<P>Bread ought not to be eaten with every dish; it is more useful and necessary with those articles that contain much nourishment in a small bulk, in order to give the stomach a proper degree of expansion. Besides, the addition of bread to animal food has another advantage, namely, that of preventing the disgust attending a too copious use of flesh, and its strong tendency to putrefaction. But if we accustom ourselves to eat new baked bread, to provisions already indigestible in themselves, such as fat geese, bacon, blood-sausages, and the like, we make them still more insupportable to our digestive organs. Of the different kinds of grain, from which bread is prepared, that of rye is by far the most whole∣some for people of a sedentary life, as well as the delicate and nervous. For though it be
<PB N="72" REF="039111_0395_1013A22A588CE598"/>
less nourishing, it is likewise less tenacious, and more easily digested, than bread made of wheat.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A few years since, when serious apprehensions of an ap∣proaching famine were entertained, in consequence of the scarci∣ty, or rather the high price of flour in this country, the minds of men were sedulously employed in researches tending to avert the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pending calamity. Compositions of various substances to serve as substitutes for bread, such as grey-peas, horse-beans, potatoes▪ and many other farinaceous vegetables, were repeatedly tried. And although a very nourishing and palatable bread was form∣ed of flour mixed with rice and potatoes, yet the prejudices of the lower, as well as the higher classes of the people, in favour of wheaten bread, were too great and inveterate, to admit so useful and beneficial an innovation.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Rice</HI> contains a thin, unelastic, and easily soluble mucilage. It is one of the popular prejudices, that rice has a tendency to produce costiveness: this is only so far true as the use of it, by persons of languid and debilitated constitutions, is sometimes attended with flat∣ulency, which sufficiently accounts for its sec∣ondary effect. To avoid such unpleasant con∣sequences, rice ought to be eaten with the addition of some spice, such as cinnamon, fen∣nel, carraway, annis-seed, and the like; par∣ticularly by those of a phlegmatic habit, and slow digestion.—In India, where this plentiful grain is almost the only food of the natives, it is regularly eaten with such quantities of pepper, and other strong spices, that Europe∣ans, on their first arrival, cannot partake of this high-seasoned dish. From a custom so beneficial in its physical effects, we may con∣clude, that the Indians, though directed more by instinct than scientific induction, are not altogether unacquainted with the rules of diet.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="039111_0396_1013A1E669FC1F88"/>
One of the best preparations of rice is the mucilage, or jelly, which is obtained by boil∣ing two ounces of it ground to fine powder, and a quarter of a pound of loaf-sugar in one pint of water, until it becomes a transparent thick broth: this, when expressed through a cloth, and allowed to cool, is a palatable and wholesome jelly.</P>
<P><HI>Oats,</HI> when hulled or deprived of the husk, and reduced to groans, are used as the common dish for the infirm and sick in England, France, and Germany. They impart to the water a thick mucilage, which, with the addition of a few currants boiled in it, is of a nourishing and slightly aperient quality.</P>
<P><HI>Barley,</HI> or rather pearl-barley, may be used with a similar intention, and is perhaps still more nutritive; but, after decoction, the gross∣er parts which remain ought not to be eaten.</P>
<P><HI>Millet,</HI> or hirse, is inferior to either oats or barley; it possesses too crude a mucilage for relaxed or inactive stomachs.</P>
<P><HI>Manna-grass</HI> (the <HI>festuca fluitans</HI>) is so called in Germany and Poland, because its seeds have a remarkably sweet and agreeable taste, particularly before the plant comes to its full growth. It excels in richness and nutriment all the other vegetable productions of Europe; and, boiled in milk, it affords excellent soups as well as puddings. Two ounces of this manna, properly cooked in milk and water, would be a sufficient meal for the most robust and laborious man. Boiled in water alone, in the proportion of one ounce to three pints of water evaporated to one quart, with the
<PB N="74" REF="039111_0397_1013A22CF1F2C228"/>
addition of some sugar and white wine, it makes an agreeable and nourishing dish for lying-in women, and other patients for whom animal food is improper, and whose situation requires the occasional stimulus of wine.</P>
<P>The <HI>second</HI> order of vegetable aliment in∣cludes all the leguminous productions, as beans, peas, lentils, and the like; these con∣tain a solid gluten or mucilage, and afford a rich and strong nutriment, which best agrees with a vigorous stomach. They also have a considerable proportion of crude particles, which cannot be assimilated to our fluids, and must therefore remain undigested in the bow∣els, to the great detriment of the alimentary canal. The <HI>meal</HI> of the leguminous class is digested with more difficulty than that of grain; besides, it contains much fixed air; on which account it is extremely flatulent, is apt to pro∣duce costiveness, and to communicate various kinds of acrimony to the blood. These effects, however, it produces only when it is eaten too frequently and copiously. Hence bread, made of peas or beans, either alone or mixed and ground together with wheat, is improper for daily use.</P>
<P>Yet we must not imagine, that even the most wholesome articles of food are altogether free from air: this element is a necessary and use∣ful ingredient, to promote the digestion of alimentary substances. The proportion of fix∣ed air varies extremely in different vegeta∣bles:—all the leguminous plants particularly
<PB N="75" REF="039111_0398_1013A1E7EF0E8628"/>
abound with it; and even persons with whom they agree well, must have experienced flatu∣lency and torpor, after a copious use of peas or beans. Those who are fond of peas-soup, would better consult their health, by boiling the peas whole, than split and deprived of their husks; for these promote the grinding of the peas, and prevent them from turning acid in the stomach, which split peas readily do, while they are apt to occasion oppression in the bow∣els, and a very troublesome heart-burn.</P>
<P><HI>Green peas,</HI> as well as <HI>French beans,</HI> boiled in their fresh state, are equally agreeable and wholesome; for they are less flatulent, and more easy of digestion, than in their ripe state. It deserves to be remarked, in general, that all vegetables of the pulse kind, as they advance in growth, become more oppressive to the stomach, and consequently less salutary in their effects.</P>
<P>The <HI>third</HI> order of Vegetables comprises the various kinds of salads and herbs used in cooking, such as greens, cabbage, spinage, and the like. These contain a great propor∣tion of water, and little nourishment: they serve to fill the stomach, resist putrefaction, and may therefore be eaten more freely in summer than in winter; being, besides, of a softening, laxative, saponaceous, and conse∣quently solvent nature, they are well calcu∣lated to relieve the bowels. On account of their watery consistence, they are of peculiar service to lean people, to those who lose much
<PB N="76" REF="039111_0399_1013A22F88BDCEE8"/>
moisture by perspiration, or who are troubled with flushings and undulations of the blood (in which case animal food is improper)—and as these vegetables assist insensible perspira∣tion, they are cooling, and assist all the emunc∣tories of the body. Their nourishment is in proportion to the mucilage contained in them; but as this is in a very diluted state, the ali∣ment they afford is inconsiderable. They are further distinguished by the earthly, acrid, and aërial particles which they contain, both with respect to their nutriment, and their ef∣fects upon the first passages. They become soft by boiling, many of the aërial particles are expelled, and they are thus rendered more digestible. But the practice of boiling them in large quantities of water, which is afterwards poured off, is extremely absurd and injudicious; for, with the water, their best and most nutritious parts are consequent∣ly thrown away: hence these vegetables ought to be thoroughly washed, and, cabbage ex∣cepted, stewed in a small quantity of water, which will so far be reduced by slow boiling, that it may be brought to the table, together with the vegetables. To improve their relish, as well as to render these vegetables less flatu∣lent, we generally add spices, which also assist digestion. And for the same reason, in a raw state, they are eaten with vinegar, salt, pepper, and the like.</P>
<P><HI>Salads,</HI> being in general eaten with oil and vinegar, call for all the powers of the stomach, to digest these liquids, together with the raw herbs. <HI>Baked</HI> vegetables with paste and milk,
<PB N="77" REF="039111_0400_1013A1EA8C3CF710"/>
as they are prepared in some countries, lose all their principal virtues, and readily acquire an empyreumatic oil upon the crust, which is indigestible, and taints the fluids with a dan∣gerous acrimony.</P>
<P><HI>Asparagus</HI> is an excellent article of nu∣triment, although somewhat flatulent and di∣uretic in its effects. The young shoots of this plant are not only the most palatable, but at the same time the most salutary.—As a good substitute for sparrowgrass, I can from experi∣ence recommend the <HI>young buds of hops,</HI> which are more easily procured, scarcely inferior to the former in taste, and, on account of their aromatic quality, very grateful and wholesome.</P>
<P><HI>Artichokes</HI> afford a light and tender food, perhaps still more nutritive but less diuretic than asparagus; for this reason, they are pref∣erable for culinary uses.</P>
<P><HI>Spinage,</HI> a favourite dish with many, affords no nutriment, passes quickly through the sto∣mach and bowels, almost undigested; and, being usually dressed with butter, it weakens the alimentary canal, produces looseness, and consequently is not proper food for the weak and debilitated.—In languid stomachs, spinage is apt to produce acidity and the heart-burn.</P>
<P><HI>Sorrel</HI> possesses an acrid acidity, which de∣prives the teeth of their enamel, and ought to be avoided by those who are already troub∣led with an acid taste in the mouth.</P>
<P><HI>Red Cabbage</HI> is one of the most indigestible vegetables, particularly as the French and Germans eat it, with ham and chesnuts; it is thus rendered heating, flatulent, and laxative,
<PB N="78" REF="039111_0401_1013A233290C25F0"/>
and contains no nourishment.—More digesti∣ble, cooling, and less hurtful to the bowels, are the young sprigs of cauliflower; but the most indigestible of all is the Colewort (<HI>Caulis ra∣picius.</HI>) What has been said with respect to cabbage, is applicable also to the Orach, or <HI>Atriplex,</HI> and the Lettuce, when eaten boiled or stewed.</P>
<P><HI>White Cabbage</HI> is possessed of excellent prop∣erties; it is less flatulent than the common greens, and, being full of water, it is diuretic, and somewhat laxative.—It is remarkable, that all herbs and plants, in general, are more or less flatulent, according to their digestibil∣ity, and are disposed to putrescency; in pro∣portion to the time they remain in the ali∣mentary canal.</P>
<P>Of White Cabbage sliced or cut in thin shreds, and afterwards seasoned and salted, the Germans make <HI>Sauer Kraut;</HI> which is easily digested, on account of the salt mixed with it, and the acetous fermentation it has undergone, before it is used, and by which the greatest part of its fixed air is expelled. Sauer Kraut may be preserved fresh for a long time; it operates powerfully on the first pas∣sages, being one of the most excellent antisep∣tics; it has proved of singular service at sea, in resisting the ravages of the scurvy, and curing it in the most alarming stages. We are indebted to Capt. Cook, for introducing this salutary dish among the sailors, in spite of all prejudices, and thus preserving the health of many brave mariners. Lastly, Sauer Kraut has been found the best preventive
<PB N="79" REF="039111_0402_1013A1EC16812F48"/>
against epidemic distempers, particularly a∣gainst the dysentery, and the putrid and pe∣techial fevers, which it has even frequently cured.</P>
<P><HI>Lettuce</HI> contains many nitrous particles, is very cooling, and useful in the evening to those who cannot sleep, from the too great heat and undulations of the blood. But the copi∣ous addition of oil and the yolk of eggs ren∣ders it less digestible than when eaten in its simple state; but if these must be used it is better to add some sugar, which decomposes these substances. The most suitable ingredi∣ents of Salads, besides the Lettuce, are the va∣rious Cresses, Chervil, (<HI>Chaerophyllum bulbo∣sum, Linn.</HI>) and the scurvy-grass, which, to∣gether with other cooling herbs, produce the effect of cleansing the humours, or, as some say, of purifying the blood, and are at the same time diuretic; especially if eaten in Spring, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and upon an empty stomach.</P>
<P>The <HI>fourth</HI> order of Vegetables consists of all the esculent roots, or such as are used at our tables. They are either of the mild, or of the astringent and acrid kind. The former are much more nourishing and less flatulent than the latter, which however possess some medic∣inal powers, such as the various species of rad∣ishes, onions, garlic, and the like.</P>
<P>Roots are neither so nourishing, nor so easily digested as animal food. Yet we may consid∣er it as a certain rule, that any kind of ali∣ment,
<PB N="80" REF="039111_0403_1013A234AF172918"/>
for which we feel a natural and perma∣nent appetite, is conformable to our nature. Of this kind is that beneficial root, the potato, which, in the most simple preparation, and without any addition, affords an agreeable and wholesome food to almost every person, and particularly to children. It is one of the light∣est alimentary substances, occasioning neither viscidity nor flatulence, and can be hurtful only, when immoderately used. But, being a dry vegetable, and containing many earthy particles, it requires a proper quantity of drink to prevent obstructions. Its excellent nour∣ishment is sufficiently obvious in the healthiness of those country people, whose principal food is potatoes, as well as animals that are fattened upon these roots.</P>
<P>The quickness with which the chyle made from potatoes is assimilated to the blood, leaves no doubt that they are easily digested; for it is a general remark, that labouring people sooner feel a renewal of their appetite, after potatoes, than any other species of food. It is a groundless assertion, that they generate a thick and crude chyle, and consequently a gross and viscous blood. It is an equally un∣founded supposition, which is amply refuted by experience, that the potato is a narcotic root, and that it is apt to stupify the powers of the mind. This effect is produced only from a too copious use of it, together with want of exercise; in which cases any other food would be attended with similar conse∣quences.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="039111_0404_1013A1EFCA48A120"/>
The stimulating powers ascribed to potatoes appear to me merely fanciful. Those of a farinaceous consistence are much more easily digested, than the heavy and gelatinous kind. The flour made of potatoes is more wholesome for pastry, and for all those dishes prepared of meal, than any other. The French have late∣ly contrived a method of preparing a granula∣ted flour from this root, which is grateful to the palate, and very nourishing. It is per∣formed by a machine of simple construction, a representation of which, together with a de∣scription, was given, some time ago, in the Repertory of the Arts and Manufactures;—and it has also been used successfully, when mixed with wheat flour, in making bread.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whatever has been formerly said against the use of potatoes, it is now well understood that they are wholesome nourishing, and light to the stomach, even in the weakest constitutions.—M. <HI>Parmentier,</HI> of Paris, lived for several weeks on potatoes only, without experiencing any ill effects on his health.</NOTE></P>
<P>The <HI>Beet-root</HI> contains a large proportion of saccharine matter. By the latest experiments of M. Achard, of Berlin, it has been proved, that about fourteen pounds weight produced one pound of raw sugar, exceedingly sweet, and without the intermixture of any other taste. Independent of this consideration, the beet is a valuable root, both in an economical and culinary respect; it is possessed of mild aperient qualities, and ought to be eaten more frequently, for supper, by those who are of a costive habit. Although it is not difficult of digestion, yet some less flatulent root, such as parsley, celery, or even potatoes, ought to be used together with the beet; which addition
<PB N="82" REF="039111_0405_1013A23743704B78"/>
will render it not only more palatable, but al∣so more suitable to the stomach and bowels.</P>
<P><HI>Carrots</HI> are extremely flatulent, and there∣fore an improper food for the weak, and those inclined to acidity; by such individuals they can scarcely be digested, unless taken with the addition of spice, and a proper quantity of salt; by which means their fermentation and corruption in the stomach will be in a great measure prevented. In other respects, they contain a good and copious alimentary fluid, at the same time powerfully affect the kidneys, and are likewise anthelmintic, or destructive of worms.</P>
<P><HI>Parsnips,</HI> besides their sweet mucilage, con∣tain somewhat of the aromatic principle, be∣ing more nourishing and less flatulent than carrots. To deprive them entirely of the latter quality, they ought to be boiled in two different waters; but by this precaution they partly lose their sweet taste, and become less nourishing.</P>
<P><HI>Turnips</HI> are nutritive, but flatulent, and not easy of digestion; they become still more in∣digestible with age.—The least flatulent and most nourishing of these roots are the long kind, or Swedish Turnip, lately introduced into this country.</P>
<P><HI>Parsley,</HI> as well as <HI>Smallage,</HI> are of a sweet, stimulating, and aromatic nature. The for∣mer, especially, was by the older physicians supposed to purify the blood; an effect which modern medical observers would not only doubt, but even ridicule. So much, howev∣er, is certain, that parsley is a mild aperient
<PB N="83" REF="039111_0406_1013A1F369413010"/>
and diuretic. Yet, for these salutary pur∣poses, it ought not to be eaten in a raw but boiled state.</P>
<P><HI>Celery</HI> is one of the most fragrant roots we possess in our climate, though its shoots and leaves are more commonly used for salads, than the root itself. There are two species of celery known among gardeners, both of which are estimable: one produces thick knobby roots, not unlike the size and figure of a short pine-apple; the other has a variety of small white, tender, and odorous roots. The latter species is more common in this country, while the former is much esteemed in France and Germany, where it is eaten in thin slices, previously soaked in vinegar; a preparation which, in summer, affords a cool∣ing and wholesome dish. In a raw state, cele∣ry is digested with some difficulty, which may be removed by boiling it in water, or soaking it, as before observed, for a short time in vine∣gar.—The Germans prepare an artificial cof∣fee from this root, by cutting it into small square pieces, which are dried and roasted in the usual manner. Dr. UNZER occasionally recommends this native coffee to his patients, particularly to nurses and lying-in-women, as a wholesome substitute for either tea, or the real coffee of the shops.</P>
<P>The <HI>Skirret-root,</HI> and the <HI>Scorzenera</HI> of Spain, possess more spicy and stimulating than nutritive qualities. Both these roots, as well as the three preceding, are diuretic, and con∣sequently in a slight degree stimulating. The skirret, in particular, has an agreeably sweet
<PB N="84" REF="039111_0407_1013A239E48CE730"/>
and spicy flavor, and is so tender, that it can scarcely bear to be boiled. For this reason, it is most properly eaten when raw, like fruit, or may be used as an excellent ingredient in soups and broths.—The Scorzenera, on the contrary, ought to be deprived of its black skin, and only eaten boiled: by soaking the raw root for half an hour in cold water, it loses its bitter taste, and is likewise rendered less flatulent.</P>
<P>The <HI>Salsafy,</HI> or Goat's-beard, is a root con∣taining still more of the saccharine principle, than the scorzenera: being a good substitute for sparrowgrass, and more easily reared in this climate, it certainly deserves to be more generally cultivated in our gardens.</P>
<P><HI>Onions, Garlic, Shallot,</HI> and <HI>Chives,</HI> are stimulants: they assist digestion, relieve the bowels, expel flatulency, dissolve slime or mu∣cus, and are therefore beneficial in diseases which proceed from too much viscidity; be∣sides, they increase the appetite, and ought to be used principally as spices, or medicines. They are powerful expectorants, but must be avoided by very hot, irritable, and choleric temperaments. Although these roots are eaten in quantities by whole nations, yet from their penetrating and volatile smell, which they communicate to the human breath, it is certain they agree best with individuals of a cold and phlegmatic habit, and those whose stomachs require so powerful a stim∣ulus.</P>
<P>All kinds of <HI>Radishes</HI> may be considered as medicinal roots; they are peculiarly calculat∣ed
<PB N="85" REF="039111_0408_1013A1F4EF681008"/>
to dissolve slimy humours, to generate, and also to expel flatulency; moving the air in∣closed in the intestines, and expelling it, by the copious air contained in themselves. They are salubrious to strong and active stomachs; but in those which are deficient in elasticity, radishes increase flatulency to the highest and most troublesome degree. The small salad∣radishes are more readily digested than the large root; they propel all the alimentary fluids towards the stomach, increase the ap∣petite, and are therefore proper to be eaten before a meal. Old radishes are altogether indigestible, and the whole genus, like onions and garlic, occasion a very offensive breath.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arrow-root powder,</HI> lately imported in∣to this country from the East Indies, appears to afford a larger proportion of nutritive mu∣cilage than any vegetable hitherto discovered: but it is to be regretted that the exorbitant retail-price (eight shillings the pound weight) will preclude many invalids and convales∣cents from using this excellent root in broths and jellies.</P>
<P>The <HI>fifth</HI> and last order of Vegetable sub∣stances comprehends the <HI>Fruit,</HI> or productions, of the different trees and shrubs.</P>
<P>Fruit, in general, possesses strongly resolv∣ent powers, and it is the more beneficial, as it comes to maturity at a time when the body is relaxed by the heat of summer, and when the blood has a strong tendency to inflamma∣tion.
<PB N="86" REF="039111_0409_1013A23DDBECDD60"/>
It is besides of great service in attenua∣ting the thick bilious impurities collected dur∣ing the summer, and of evacuating them by its laxative virtues. The acid contained in most kinds is as useful to quench thirst, as to resist putrefaction. In weak stomachs, how∣ever, or such as are filled with impurities and slime, it is apt to ferment, and occasion some inconvenience; but this may be avoided by a temperate use, and especially by eating it boiled.</P>
<P>The more sap or juice we meet with in fruit, it will prove the more flatulent; and as the juicy, cooling, and watery species of fruit require strong digestive organs, to prevent them from producing fermentation, flatulen∣cy, and diarrhoea, a glass of old wine is very proper to promote their digestion. A gentle diarrhoea, brought on by eating ripe fruit, in summer, has frequently a salutary effect.—Acrid and astringent fruit, being rather a med∣icine than food, is less hurtful to the healthy, and to children, than is commonly imagined. Instead of being noxious, as some imagine, in inflammatory disorders, it is of the greatest service. Persons of a thick and black blood cannot eat any thing more conducive to health than fruit, as it possesses the property of atten∣uating and putting such blood in motion; but those of a watery and phlegmatic constitution ought carefully to avoid it.</P>
<P>Fruit preserved with sugar is antiseptic and nourishing, but at the same time flatulent; and if preserved with sugar and spices, it is heating and drying. It is most wholesome when eat∣en
<PB N="87" REF="039111_0410_1013A1F77795C450"/>
on an empty stomach, which can exert all its power to dispel the air disengaged from it, and to remove it, before it begins to ferment. Boiling, as well as drying, corrects the flatu∣lent tendency of fresh fruit, so that, thus pre∣pared, it will agree with every body. By ei∣ther of these methods it is deprived of its superfluous humidity, as well as of its fixed air; whence it becomes more nourishing, but less cooling, than in the fresh state.</P>
<P><HI>Sago</HI> is the medullary part, or marrow, col∣lected from a species of palm-tree growing in the Mulucca and other islands of the East-In∣dies. This substance, although not strictly the fruit of a tree, well deserves the first place here; for it is used as bread by the natives of India, who macerate it in water, and form it into cakes. The grains of sago, sold in the shops, are obtained by a more artificial process: they furnish a nourishing and agreeable jelly with water, milk, or broth; but require to be previously cleaned of the dust, mould, and sea-water. To make a complete solution of sago, the first decoction ought to be strained, and afterwards boiled a second time, for about half an hour. Prepared in this manner, it is a proper dish for the consumptive and con∣valescent, as well as those whose digestion is weak or impaired.</P>
<P><HI>Cherries</HI> produce the effects now stated, in a very pre-eminent degree; they are excellent in scurvy, in putrid fevers, and in dysentery; they correct the blood when inclined to pu∣trescency, and by their saponaceous and mel∣liferous juice, they powerfully resolve obstruc∣tions
<PB N="88" REF="039111_0411_1013A23F604C5F20"/>
in the intestines. Those who use them with this intention, may eat them at any time of the day, though they operate most effectu∣ally in the morning, on an empty stomach. Even the sweet species contain a stimulating acid, which, in proportion to their juicy con∣sistence, disagrees more or less with the weak and debilitated; for this sap or juice easily ferments in the stomach, and produces flatu∣lency, diarrhoea, and acidity. On account of these peculiar effects, persons whose stomachs are bilious and vitiated, who are troubled with putrid eructations, and an offensive breath, ought to eat them freely, to counteract that disposition to putridity.</P>
<P>Cherries are divided into the aqueous-sweet, aqueous-acid, and the dry pulpous kinds. The Spanish cherries are the most difficult to digest, but are also the most nourishing. The aqueous-sweet kind, as our early common cherries, are unwholesome; because their juice easily ferments, and occasions colic and diar∣rhoea. The watery-acid sort are the best of any; their juice strengthens the stomach, pu∣rifies the blood, and is the least flatulent. Dried cherries are in many diseases an excel∣lent article of diet, on account of their cooling and antiseptic properties. The swallowing of cherry-stones, however, is highly perni∣cious, as these stones have sometimes been found to accumulate in the intestines, to form lumps cemented together by viscid phlegm, and thus to produce the most violent and fa∣tal symptoms.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="039111_0412_1013A1FB4C909938"/>
<HI>Plums</HI> also possess medicinal virtues; they are nourishing and attenuating. Prunes, or dried plums, are of peculiar service to costive habits, affording an agreeable and nutritive dish; but, as they are apt to produce flatulency, it would be adviseable to eat them either when the stomach is empty, or for supper, without mixing them with other aliment. Under this limitation, they are both aperient and cooling, and agree with almost every constitution; but plums eaten fresh, and not quite ripe, espe∣cially in large quantities, are very apt to oc∣casion looseness, colics, and other maladies of the stomach and intestines. The larger sort of plums are in general more dangerous, in this respect, than the small ones, as they (par∣ticularly the green and yellow kind) are sel∣dom allowed to grow perfectly ripe.</P>
<P><HI>Tamarinds</HI> are more frequently employed for medicinal purposes, than as an article of diet. The pulp of this fruit is one of the most grateful acids; which, if taken in the quanti∣ty of from half an ounce to an ounce or more, proves gently purgative. By its acidity, it is well calculated to quench thirst and allay im∣moderate heat.</P>
<P><HI>Peaches</HI> abound with juice, and though not very nourishing, they are not productive of diarrhoea. This salutary fruit was formerly decried as unwholesome; but it is rather ser∣viceable in obstructions and bilious disorders. Sugar, wine, and the like, diminish the good qualities of peaches; and even when preserv∣ed in brandy, they are not so wholesome as when fresh; since they become hard by all ar∣tificial
<PB N="90" REF="039111_0413_1013A241F844E070"/>
preparations. The kernels likewise of peaches are a wholesome bitter, and are clean∣sing, on account of their astringent properties.</P>
<P>As there are various kinds of peaches, of an inferior quality, it will be useful to point out the distinguishing marks of that fruit, in a mature state. The best sort of peaches have a delicate thin skin, which is easily separated from the pulpous part. Those which are not naturally smooth ought to be covered with only a small quantity of down; for too much down or wool on the surface is a sign of their inferior quality. They are likewise not to be depended upon as being wholesome, if they are of a size either too small or preternatural∣ly large. Their pulp ought to be delicate, yet solid, somewhat fibrous, and full of juice; it should not adhere to the stone or kernel, and readily melt in the mouth.</P>
<P><HI>Apricots</HI> are more pulpy than peaches, but perhaps less nutritive: their juice readily fer∣ments and turns acid in weak stomachs; yet, when ripe, and used with moderation, they are cooling and antiseptic, particularly for bil∣ious and plethoric individuals.</P>
<P>Of <HI>Pears,</HI> some are extremely hard, astrin∣gent, and difficult of digestion; but the more juicy pears have a saponaceous, nourishing, and readily digestible fluid; in their effects they resemble the sweet kind of apples, ex∣cept that they are less relaxing to the bowels. Pears are of a more flatulent tendency than any of the fruits before mentioned, and es∣pecially the hard winter-pears, which are eaten
<PB N="91" REF="039111_0414_1013A1FCD146F558"/>
at a time when the stomach requires stimulat∣ing more than cooling food.</P>
<P><HI>Apples</HI> are, in their general effect, similar to other fruit, and, besides their aromatic virtues, are possessed of laxative properties. They are serviceable in diseases of the breast, to remove spasmodic contractions, to neutral∣ize acrimony, and to attenuate viscid p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>gm. With this intention, apples are most bene∣ficial when eaten either roasted or boiled. The common people in Germany are so sensible of their excellent properties, in inflammatory diseases, that they boil even the wild apples, and drink the water. This process deserves imitation, especially when apples become scarce in Spring.</P>
<P>Apples may be divided into the spicy, the acidulated, and the watery species. The first, the various kinds of rennet, for example, have the most delicate flavor, and are certainly the best; they do not contain a superfluity of wa∣ter, and, from their vinous nature, are not apt to excite flatulency. Other kinds of apples, like the pippins, are too hard, consequently heavy to the stomach, though somewhat more nourishing than the former. Stewed apples are easily digested and wholesome.</P>
<P>The kernels or seeds of apples are bitter and aromatic; Nature seems to have intend∣ed the seeds for correcting the watery and fermentable fluids of this and all other fruit, apricots excepted. Hence the kernels of ap∣ples and pears, as well as those of plums and cherries, ought to be eaten with the fruit, and not be thrown away as useless.—The but∣ter
<PB N="92" REF="039111_0415_1013A245C16B28C0"/>
in the paste of apple-pies may be consid∣ered as an useful addition, on account of its tendency to prevent fermentation, though the pastry itself always disagrees with weak and irritable stomachs.</P>
<P>Of <HI>Quinces</HI> we have two species, namely, the apple and pear-quince: the latter are the most wholesome, particularly those of Portu∣gal. They are an excellent antiseptic, and in this respect the best kind of fruit, contain∣ing an acid and much mucilage. They are not productive of obstructions; but their pulp, like that of all other fruit, is digested with some difficulty. They are generally eat∣en boiled with sugar, and are excellent in dysentery, on account of their copious mu∣cilage.</P>
<P>In <HI>Lemons, Oranges,</HI> and other fruit of that kind, we meet with three different substances. The external rind contains an essential oil, strongly astringent and heating; the second or white rind is without taste; the third part of them is a salubrious, cooling, and acid pulp, highly efficacious in counteracting the putrid tendency and dissolution of the blood. The juice of lemons and limes is one of the strongest vegetable acids;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If the objections started against the use of these acids, by a late physician in Germany, Dr. UNZER, be well founded, we ought to guard against their use. He maintains that, although lemons and limes may be wholesome and refreshing fruits in their native country, yet as they are packed up and sent to us in an unripe state, they possess an acrid and unnatural acid; from not having undergone the vinous and acetous fermentations, and which consequently cannot be wholesome. The juice, especially, which is obtained from the middle of those fruits, having acquir∣ed, an highly astringent though not unpleasant taste, from the styptic quality of the bitter kernels, is extremely unwholesome. It is, according to the observations of Dr. Unzer, very apt to im∣pair digestion, and to occasion either diarrhoea or constipation of the bowels.—Such effects, however, will be produced only when these acids are <HI>immoderately</HI> used; in which case the most whole∣some substances will be attended with bad consequences, and ever form exceptions from the general rule. Yet I must agree with Dr. U. that the peel of lemons and oranges contains an inflamma∣ble and heating oil, which, if rubbed on sugar, for making punch, lemonade, &amp;c. is apt to produce dangerous effects.</NOTE> and that of oran∣ges
<PB N="93" REF="039111_0416_1013A1FF777013E0"/>
and shaddocks, though milder, is not less salutary.</P>
<P>These acids are of a very saponaceous con∣sistence; they attenuate the fluids, remove obstructions, encourage digestion, stimulate the appetite, quench thirst, cool the blood, counteract putrefaction, are a principal reme∣dy in pectoral, bilious, and inflammatory dis∣eases, as likewise in scurvy, in all affections of the kidneys, and an antidote against the narcotic vegetable poisons. Hence the larg∣est dose of opium may be checked in its nar∣cotic effects, if a proper quantity of the acid of lemons be taken with, or immediately af∣ter it. Four grains of pure opium, for in∣stance, or one hundred drops of laudanum, is a very powerful and sometimes fatal dose; yet if one ounce of the pure acid of lemons, or two ounces of orange juice, be added to every grain of opium, or to twenty-five drops of laudanum, it will produce a very different effect. Instead of stupifying the person who takes it, and of being attended with painful costiveness, it will not only prove laxative, but induce first a cheerfulness, not attainable by the use either of opium or strong liquors, and afterwards bring on a gentle and refresh∣ing sleep.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="039111_0417_1013A24851046E18"/>
Of these effects I can speak from my own experience, as well as that of others. Opium, used with this addition, is one of the most sal∣utary and beneficial substances with which we are acquainted. I am farther inclined to be∣lieve, that the Turks, who eat very little ani∣mal food, could not bear the large quantities of opium they swallow, were it not for the copious use of vegetable acids. And that these form a principal part of a Turkish sum∣mer diet, every traveller knows, who has visited the eastern climates.</P>
<P>For these reasons, I cannot sufficiently rec∣ommend the use of acids to persons, who are either accustomed, or obliged, to take opiates in large doses. In choleric, bilious, and pleth∣oric habits, in those liable to obstructions, whose alimentary canal is unclean, and lastly, in those who feel a determination of the blood to the head, opium is an uncertain, and even dangerous medicine, without the addition of vegetable acids. The want of the acid of lemons may be effectually supplied by an in∣digenous production:—barberries afford an acid fully as strong, and nearly as agreeable, as that of lemons.</P>
<P>The juice of the various species of <HI>Raisins</HI> is not unlike that of <HI>ripe</HI> lemons in its properties, but less efficacious. There are various kinds of that excellent fruit. Among the larger sort, those of a blueish colour, imported from Marseilles, are the best; while the Spanish raisins, of a light brown colour, are inferior to those of any other species. Both kinds, as well as <HI>Currants,</HI> contain much nutriment,
<PB N="95" REF="039111_0418_1013A202325D9DA0"/>
but cannot be recommended for frequent use, as they all tend to produce flatulency, partic∣ularly in individuals of relaxed habits and a sedentary life. On this account, they ought to be eaten with other food, in which case they are emollient, gently laxative, and some∣times anodyne.</P>
<P><HI>Gooseberries,</HI> having less of the acid than either raisins or currants, are perhaps more wholesome, especially if their skin and other impurities are not swallowed together with the juice. When used in a green state, for sauces and pies, they are cooling and refreshing; and, when ripe, possess similar properties with cherries.</P>
<P><HI>Figs</HI> abound with saccharine matter, and are uncommonly nutritive, though at the same time of a flatulent nature, unless eaten with bread or other mealy substances.—Of similar effects are mulberries and raspberries: the former have a more mucilaginous and nourish∣ing juice, while that of the latter is more of a vinous nature, and one of the best cordials for allaying thirst and affording refreshment.</P>
<P><HI>Grapes</HI> and <HI>Strawberries</HI> are both excellent fruits. They are uncommonly resolvent, lax∣ative without debilitating, and promote all the natural evacuations; but at the same time, grapes are in a high degree flatulent.</P>
<P>The quality of grapes depends much on climate and soil. Those of a sweet taste, and aromatic flavour, only ought to be used. They agree best when eaten on an empty stomach, with a small quantity of bread. Besides their slightly nourishing quality, it is affirmed by
<PB N="96" REF="039111_0419_1013A249D5CFA610"/>
some writers, that they cool the blood and an∣imate the nerves.</P>
<P>Strawberries, if eaten plentifully, have been found a safe preventive against the stone in the kidneys; as is attested by the experience of the celebrated LINNAEUS. Yet the small stones contained in strawberries, as well as in grapes, are said to accumulate in the intestines of some individuals, and to give rise to the most obstinate constipations, nay even to the iliac passion. The best method of eating straw∣berries is with pure water, and sweetened with a little sugar; they are more heating with wine, but less wholesome; with milk or cream they are an agreeable but improper compo∣sition. As a medicine, the wild strawberry is far preferable to any other.</P>
<P><HI>Cucumbers</HI> are a wholesome, gently opening, and cooling fruit, which may be of consider∣able service to the consumptive, as it has the property of sweetening acrid humours. They show a tendency to ferment, and produce diar∣rhoea; but this may be prevented by the ad∣dition of vinegar and pepper, which also coun∣teracts their natural coldness. Prepared with oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper, they are insup∣portable to some weak stomachs, and occasion frequent eructations and flatulency. But properly pickled, they are an excellent anti∣septic, though unfit to be given to children and wet-nurses.</P>
<P>Much of the same nature with cucumbers are <HI>Melons;</HI> but they are more aromatic, and, in this respect, more wholesome. <HI>Water-melons</HI> require more spice and wine than <HI>Musk-melons;</HI>
<PB N="97" REF="039111_0420_1013A2060D16E808"/>
as they partake more of the nature of Cucum∣bers.</P>
<P><HI>Gourds,</HI> a fruit of the melon-kind, but less sweet, and of a much larger size, if boiled in milk, after the first water has been poured off, and with the addition of salt and popper, af∣fords sufficiently wholesome and nutritive food.</P>
<P><HI>Olives,</HI> in their natural state, are bitter, acrid, and exceedingly disagreeable; though their taste is much improved when pickled, as we receive them from abroad, particularly in the smaller kind, or Lucca olives. On ac∣count of the abundance of oil which they con∣tain, they are unfit for delicate stomachs, and are pernicious, especially when eaten for de∣sert, after a heavy dinner.</P>
<P><HI>Almonds, Walnuts, Hazlenuts,</HI> and <HI>Nuts</HI> in general, are extremely difficult of digestion, on account of the oil they contain, which readily turns acrid and rancid o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the stomach, and occasions the heart-burn. Bilious indi∣viduals should by no means eat them; and there is nothing so absurd as to administer <HI>al∣mond-milk</HI> as a common diet-drink to febrile patients. This milk consists altogether of oily and almost insoluble parts, which heat and vi∣tiate the stomach, stimulate the bile, and are easily decomposed from the water with which they are mixed. It quickly spoils; frequent∣ly, indeed, before it is introduced into the stomach: it is not in the least degree cooling, and its nourishing quality is very improperly employed in fevers, and all those diseases which are attended with debility of the ali∣mentary canal.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="039111_0421_1013A157F7A47608"/>
Nuts and almonds ought to be eaten only while fresh, and when the skin, which is ex∣tremely astringent and hurtful, can be re∣moved. They should be well chewed, and eaten with salt; for every piece swallowed entire is indigestible, and the salt renders them miscible with our fluids as a saponaceous mass. If eaten in large quantities, they remain in the stomach, cannot be expelled by any med∣icines, and produce alarming and sometimes fatal disorders. In general, they occasion dif∣ficult breathing, vomiting, and complaints in the bowels, which have been observed to be very common in those autumns that were pro∣ductive of great quantities of nuts.</P>
<P>Last among the vegetable productions, we may class the various species of <HI>Mushrooms.</HI> They are all of a tough, leathery consistence; and being almost indigestible, they afford little nutriment, notwithstanding they, in a great measure, resemble animal food.</P>
<P>Several kinds of mushrooms are said to con∣tain a narcotic and acrimonious poison. And as those of a harmless kind cannot be easily distinguished from the bad ones, this might be a sufficient reason to abstain from the use of them altogether. But if they must appear at our tables, vegetable acids, or vinegar, are the best antidotes, to counteract their pernicious effects. Pickled with vinegar, or salted, mush∣rooms become still more tough; and roasted with butter, they are an indigestible mass, and extremely liable to turn rancid in the stomach.</P>

<HEAD>Of Drink in particular.</HEAD>
<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>I. With respect to its Quantity.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Drinking</HI> is perhaps more necessary to the support of animal life than <HI>Eating;</HI> for drink is indispensable to the solution and digestion of food. Those who drink too little, people, for instance, of a sedentary life, and particularly women, are subject to complaints of indi∣gestion. Sufficient drink prevents the incras∣sation of the blood, and the obstruction of the smaller vessels; it tends to clear the blood of the acrid particles generated in it; and it pro∣motes the necessary secretions, such as the bile and the gastric juice of the stomach.</P>
<P>We ought to drink only when we are thirsty, and to desist when thirst is quenched: but this is seldom the case, because many of our liquors stimulate the palate. Pure water, therefore, is an inestimable beverage, as it will not induce us to drink more than is necessary. We should drink in a greater proportion than we eat; for the quantity of our fluids by far exceeds that of the solids, and consequently there must be secreted more fluids than solids. The general rule may be given, to take about double the proportion of liquid to the dry food; but this cannot be accurately observed, nor is it applicable in all cases.</P>
<P>The season, the weather, cold, heat, the na∣ture of our food, and the greater or less degree of our exercise, require more or less drink at one time than at another. Thirst, however,
<PB N="100" REF="039111_0423_1013A20A30B5A290"/>
is as good, if not a better guide than hunger; and he who is accustomed to drink water only, will not easily transgress the measure, if he drink as often as nature calls upon him. With a proper choice of food, every one would drink conformably to his wants. Hence it is needless to recommend water as a beverage to persons who will not be persuaded to change their irregular mode of eating.</P>
<P>The more we eat in quantity, and the drier our victuals are, the more we ought to drink. The phlegmatic have less inclination to drink than those of a sanguine and choleric tempera∣ment. The laborious ought to drink more than the sedentary, and still more in summer than in winter, to supply the humours lost by insensible perspiration.</P>
<P>In the morning when we rise, we generally feel an inclination for drink, which is relieved by tea, coffee, or other warm liquors. Water would unquestionably be a more proper bev∣erage at this time; and I venture to say, it would be disagreeable to those only, whose stomachs are spoiled by the habitual use of warm liquors and hot rolls. A glass of pure fresh water, and a while after it, a piece of bread with some fruit, or even butter, would afford a very wholesome breakfast, by which the stomach and the intestines might be clear∣ed, the blood and humours refreshed, and the whole body strengthened. If the stomach be not loaded with mucus, or relaxed by tippling, a bason of sweet cow's milk, with a piece of stale bread, is an excellent breakfast in Spring and Summer.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="039111_0424_1013A20BB79F8468"/>
To drink immediately before a meal, is im∣proper, because the stomach is thereby swelled, and rendered less fit for the digestion of food. Hence, to avoid the necessity of drinking, it is advisable, not to take any violent exercise immediately before dinner. To drink much at night, previous to our going to bed, is likewise hurtful. But the drinking before a meal is more noxious than at any other time; because the stomach is filled with the liquid we swallow; the bile and the gastric juice there collected are too much diluted; and consequently the important office of diges∣tion is checked.</P>
<P>To drink much during the time of taking food is also objectionable, as the stomach is thus rendered incapable of receiving the due portion of aliment. Cold beer or water does not well agree with warm victuals; and the teeth are injured by taking hot and cold sub∣stances in immediate succession. In the hot weather of Summer, it is scarcely possible to delay drinking till the dinner be finished; and it is the more necessary, or rather less hurtful, at this time, as the bile which serves to dissolve the victuals, then requires greater dilution. In Winter, unless we eat very dry and salted provisions, we feel less inclined to drink at table. But if we must drink in the intervals of eating, it would be most conducive to di∣gestion to drink water only, and in small quan∣tities; as pure water is more proper during the time of eating, because it agrees with all dishes without exception. Yet a glass or two of wine, during dinner, particularly for the aged
<PB N="102" REF="039111_0425_1013A250171B5050"/>
and debilitated, is proper and conducive to digestion.</P>
<P>Some advise us never to drink without eat∣ing something; but he who drinks only when nature requires it, has no occasion to eat every time he drinks. Persons, on the contrary, who are once accustomed to drink more than is ne∣cessary, or to make use of hot, stimulating, and intoxicating liquors, would do well to eat al∣ways some bread or other solid food along with them. Indeed we ought to begin to drink only after our appetite for food is satis∣fied, and then it should be done gradually during digestion. This function may be dis∣turbed by large draughts of liquor, which oc∣casion fermentation and flatulency.—Glass is the most proper substance for drinking-vessels; for no other but the fluoric acid will affect it.—For the sake of delicacy, as well as health, every person at table ought to be furnished with a separate glass or other vessel for his drink.</P>
<P>Much drink loads and oppresses the stomach, as it distends it too much; but it is not nearly so hurtful as too much food. Every beverage relaxes the stomach; and persons whose bow∣els are not sufficiently classic, should be careful in the quantity they drink; for an immoderate proportion of it may weaken digestion, dilute the fluids too much, and conduct the food too quickly through the alimentary canal. An undue portion of drink renders the mass of the blood too thin and watery; from a thin blood arises also a weak alimentary fluid, con∣sequently a general debility of the body, and relaxation of the urinary and other passages.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="039111_0426_1013A20F61FA2E60"/>
On the other hand, too little drink is equal∣ly improper; digestion is weakened; many parts of victuals remain undissolved, and are not conducted to the lacteals, because the proper means of diluting them are wanting; the blood becomes thick and viscid; and fi∣nally, the secretions and excretions are not duly performed, because the different canals are too dry and contracted.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>II. With respect to its Quality.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is as great a diversity among the kinds of beverage, as there is among those of food: water itself is of very different qualities, according to the particles with which it is im∣pregnated, and the places from which it is ob∣tained. That of wells, springs, rivers, lakes, swamps, and the various mineral waters, all differ in their sensible properties. Even cold and warm water produce different effects. The former, when moderately used, strength∣ens the stomach, and proves debilitating only when it is drunk in too large quantities. Warm water is always relaxing, and still more so when taken in a large quantity; it remains longer in the stomach than cold water, and con∣sequently is more oppressive; cold liquor stim∣ulates the stomach, but warm drink diminish∣es its elasticity.</P>
<P>If the stomach be overfilled with drink, and its elasticity weakened, a glass of strong wine, or other spirituous liquor, may remedy this inconvenience.—Water can only so far be called nourishing, as it supplies the aqueous parts we continually lose. It is the basis of
<PB N="104" REF="039111_0427_1013A252A2E2C940"/>
all other liquids, and the greater proportion of water they contain, the more fit they are to promote digestion.</P>
<P><HI>Spring-water</HI> originates partly from that of the sea, which has been changed into vapours by subterraneous heat, and partly from the atmosphere. As it is dissolved, purified, and filtered in a variety of ways, before it becomes visible to us, it is lighter and purer than other waters.</P>
<P><HI>Well-water</HI> is more or less pure, according as it passes over beds of earth, which contain soluble, or minute particles. Wells opened in a sandy soil are the purest, because the wa∣ter is there most completely filtered. The more frequently a well is used, the better its water, provided that no impure substances are introduced into it; for, the longer water stands unmoved, it turns the sooner putrid. Well-water, finally, may be most effectually purified by filtering it through a quantity of sand and small pebbles; and still more con∣veniently by means of filtering-stones.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The filtering machines lately invented by Mr▪ Joseph Collier, of London, promise to be very useful for domestic purposes, as they are applicable to all fluids, but more particularly water.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>River-water</HI> is more pure and wholesome, if it flows over a sandy and stony soil, than if it pass over muddy beds, or through towns, vil∣lages, and forests, from which it receives many impure substances: the water is rendered foul by fishes, amphibious animals, and plants. Lastly, the more rapid the course of the river, the easier it clears itself of feculent particles, and the water becomes purer.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="039111_0428_1013A21307BD7200"/>
<HI>Lake-water</HI> much resembles that of rivers in its properties, but being less agitated, it is more impure, and better adapted to washing than cooking.</P>
<P>The water, which in cases of necessity is ob∣tained from <HI>swamps</HI> or <HI>ditches,</HI> is the worst of all; because a great variety of impurities are collected in it, which in a stagnant water and a soft soil readily putrify. And, as the mere exhalations of such waters produce a pestilen∣tial atmosphere, it may be easily conceived, that the use of them must be attended with pu∣trid and other dangerous diseases.</P>
<P><HI>Rain-water</HI> is also impure, as it contains many saline and oily particles, soon putrifies, and principally consists of the joint exhalations of animals, vegetables, and minerals, of an im∣mense number and variety of small insects and their eggs, seeds of plants, and the like.—Rain-water is particularly impure in places filled with many noxious vapours, such as marshy countries, and large manufacturing towns, where the fumes of metallic and other substances are mixed with rain. In high and elevated situations, at a distance from impure exhalations, if no strong winds blow, and after a gentle shower, rain-water is then purest; be∣cause the vapours of the atmosphere have al∣ready subsided. In Summer, however, on ac∣count of the copious exhalations, rain-water is most objectionable.</P>
<P><HI>Snow-water</HI> possesses the same properties as rain-water, but it is purer: both are soft, that is, without so many mineral and earthy parti∣cles as spring, well, and river waters. Still
<PB N="106" REF="039111_0429_1013A25428334280"/>
purer is <HI>hail-water,</HI> as being produced in the higher regions of the atmosphere, and having a form, in which it cannot easily partake of im∣purities. Lastly, <HI>Dew,</HI> as it arises from the evaporations of various bodies of the vegeta∣ble and animal kingdoms, is more or less im∣pure, according to the different regions and seasons.</P>
<P>As the health of man principally depends on the purity and salubrity of the water he uses, we ought, where necessary, to deprive it of its pernicious qualities; and this can be done by boiling, filtering, and most effectually by dis∣tillation. The putrid substances in the water may be corrected by the addition of an acid. Thus, half an ounce of alum in powder, will make twelve gallons of corrupted water pure and transparent in two hours, without impart∣ing a sensible degree of astringency. By the addition of a very small quantity of quick lime, water may be preserved from corruption in long voyages: or, to prevent water from putrescence at sea, add a small quantity of alkali and vitriolic acid to every cask, which will preserve it pure and wholesome for a twelve month. Charcoal-powder has also been found to be excellently adapted to check the putrid tendency of water, and for this reason the slaves of the casks, used on shipboard, ought to be well burnt in the inside, to keep the water from corrupting. Vinegar, or other strong acids, are also well calculated to cor∣rect putrid water; and may be either mixed with it, or drunk immediately after, to pre∣vent its bad effects.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="039111_0430_1013A2148C9C8FB8"/>
<HI>Wine,</HI> that salutiferous liquor to the infirm and the aged, may be divided into <HI>five</HI> prin∣cipal classes:</P>
<P>1st, The <HI>sweet wines,</HI> for instance, those of Hungary, Spain, Italy, Greece; the Mala∣ga, Malmsey, Madeira, and Cape wines. If these be genuine; if they have not been adul∣terated by the addition of sugar or honey, &amp;c. if they have been properly fermented, they af∣ford a true medicine to the weak and con∣valescent.</P>
<P>2d, The <HI>weakly acidulated wines;</HI> such as old Rhenish, Champaign, those of the Mosel. of the Neckar, Franconia, and Austria; of these the Rhenish, Mosel, and Champaign wines are the best.</P>
<P>3d, The <HI>acid</HI> and <HI>tart wines;</HI> among which are most of the wines of Franconia, Thuringia, Saxony, Silesia, and some parts of Branden∣burg. These wines, in general, are apt to occasion head-achs, complaints of the stomach, and are besides of an unpleasant taste.</P>
<P>4th, The <HI>acidulated sweet wines,</HI> particu∣larly those of France, as the common white wine and claret, are wholesome, provided that they be neither too old nor too new; and</P>
<P>5th, The <HI>sharp</HI> and <HI>astringent wines,</HI> such as Port wine, Burgundy, the dry or hard kinds of Madeira, Sherry, and the like, which, on account of their heating and binding nat∣ure, ought to be used chiefly for medicinal purposes.</P>
<P>There are a great variety of fruit-wines, which are fermented like wines from the grape; for instance, the currant and raisin∣wines:
<PB N="108" REF="039111_0431_1013A255ADBADD08"/>
but the artificial wines of this country are, in general, liable to many strong objec∣tions. Among our home-made, wines may be reckoned Cyder and Perry, which are prop∣erly wines of Apples and Pears. Cyder and Perry are, it is said, generally fermented and kept in leaden vessels, or at least the Apples and Pears are passed through leaden tubes; and the lead being readily dissolved by the acid, is gradually introduced into the body, which produces painful and dangerous colics, and frequently gives rise to the most desper∣ate and incurable obstipations, among those habituated to the free use of these liquors.</P>
<P>With respect to the constituent parts of wine, I shall only remark, that every kind consists of three principal ingredients, <HI>water, alcohol,</HI> or a pure spirit, and <HI>sugar.</HI> If these three substances could be so intimately com∣bined as they are in wines, and if afterwards the proper aromatics were added, to impart to them the particular flavour, there is no doubt, but we could perfectly imitate every wine whatever. But the greatest obstacle to this speculation is the length of time, which wines require to arrive at a proper state of maturity, and which, in made wines, ought to be still further prolonged.</P>
<P>The more water the wine contains, it is the more suitable beverage at table, and, when weak, it is in some degree calculated to quench thirst. The strong wines, on the contrary, excite thirst, as they are drying, and affect the organs of secretion. As every kind of wine contains a greater or less quantity of acid, it
<PB N="109" REF="039111_0432_1013A21765325E90"/>
is an excellent antiseptic remedy, and hence it is given copiously in putrid ulcers and ma∣lignant fevers. Moderately used, it increases the circulation of the fluids, and dilates the blood-vessels, promotes both the secretions and excretions, and invigorates all the functions of the body. Every motion is performed with greater vivacity, as is obvious from the addi∣tional lustre of the eyes. But the strength and vigour which wine imparts to the body, is of no longer duration, than while it remains in the stomach, before it enters into the mass of the blood, and while the stimulus received by the nerves of the stomach, is propagated to the brain. This explains the cause, that strong liquors are so intoxicating, when drunk upon an empty stomach.</P>
<P>That wine operates on and through the stomach, is clear from experience; for an emetic taken immediately after it, will soon make a drunken man sober. But if its spir∣ituous parts be communicated to the blood, so as to occasion fluctuations, the body be∣comes disordered, weak, and relaxed. It is only a stimulant, and not a permanently strengthening cordial; for most wine-drink∣ers, who indulge in excess, die of relaxation and debility. There may, however, be cases in which an occasional excess of this kind will be salutary; for instance, to a person who has been long sitting at study, or whose mind is depressed, and whose fluids are nearly stag∣nating: as passions sometimes conduce to an∣imate the mind, and tempests to purify the atmosphere.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="039111_0433_1013A347D15D9650"/>
The <HI>state of intoxication</HI> is in every respect similar to that of incipient apoplexy or palsy.—Drunken men stagger in various directions, their tongue loses its power of speech; they stammer, and see things double and moving circularly. The mind is equally affected, and imbecility is the concomitant effect. All these partial palsies arise from the pressure of the blood-vessels on the brain, which are then sur∣charged with blood. If the intoxication has arrived at its utmost height, there is no longer any difference between this and the true apo∣plexy; all the other organs are paralised, ex∣cept the heart, which continues its action, and breathing is not suppressed. The imprudent sufferer is deprived of sensation, and if one of the smaller blood-vessels, that press on the brain with an unusual weight, should accident∣ally burst, he is in danger of instant death. But still more frequently does one of the pulmonary vessels burst, and occasion spitting of blood.</P>
<P>In drinking, also much depends on the bod∣ily constitution and other circumstances.—Thus, people are soonest intoxicated in a cold place, where perspiration is checked, and when the blood is moving from the external to the internal parts. The same is the case on an empty stomach, but this may be pre∣vented by eating a little at intervals, especial∣ly fat or oily substances. Individuals of much sensibility and irritability, and persons after having taken violent exercise, are more liable to intoxication, than those of a calm and a phlegmatic temperament.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="039111_0434_1013A295A54EC800"/>
For these reasons, a person much inebriated ought to be carried without delay into a tem∣perate room, and placed in a bed between the blankets, with his head raised, in order to promote the circulation of the blood, from the head and the internal organs towards the sur∣face of the body and the lower extremities. All close bandages of the shirt and garters must be loosed, and the feet should be bathed in luke∣warm water, not exceeding the ninety-eighth degree of Farenheit. Plenty of tea or other diluent drink ought to be given, and a gentle emetic is frequently of great service.</P>
<P>After a good sleep, which has overcome the intoxication, the whole body feels weak and tremulous; and the stomach disordered. In this state, persons are generally troubled with much acid in the digestive organ, which may be removed by the absorbent earths, such as magnesia; after which, some sedative and strengthening remedies may be given, such as hot red-wine negus, warm ale with ginger, strong coffee, and the like.</P>
<P>The copious use of wine, though not to a degree of inebriation, is exceedingly debilita∣ting to the stomach, checking digestion, excit∣ing diarrhoea, if white-wine, and obstructions, if port-wine be the favorite liquor; it makes the fibres dry and rigid; the cheeks and the whole surface of the body turn sallow, a symp∣tom of bad digestion; the powers of the body and mind are enfeebled, and dropsy or gout, and sometimes sudden death, are the conse∣quences. Plethoric young men, and such as have weak stomachs and lungs, should not ac∣custom
<PB N="112" REF="039111_0435_10136E3F2B69D888"/>
themselves to the use of wine. To give it to infants or children, is a practice highly pernicious, except in very small quantities in∣deed. In short, wine should be used as a med∣icine only, if intended to produce salutary ef∣fects. To the phlegmatic, to the aged, and to those who are disposed to flatulency, and after fat meat, it is highly beneficial, if used with prudence and moderation.</P>
<P>As wine encourages perspiration, it dries the body, makes it lean, and may therefore be of service to cold and phlegmatic constitutions. It stimulates the bile, and excites the appetite to a repetition of excess, so that persons once habituated to drinking can but gradually re∣linquish this seductive practice. To drink wine copiously every day, is as improper and perni∣cious as to take medicines by way of diet: nothing is so much calculated to occasion hab∣itual indigestion. And as wines are frequent∣ly adulterated with sugar of lead, and other poisonous ingredients, to render them more agreeable to the palate, I propose to bestow some attention on this important subject, in order to enable the reader to detect such per∣nicious mixtures, which may expose his health, and even life itself to the greatest danger.</P>
<P>Some of the adulterations of wine are rather harmless, others extremely dangerous. The common red-wines are frequently made of new, tart, and half-spoiled white wines, by tinging them with red sumach, or other woods and berries. In order to make wines stronger and more pungent, a variety of spices are employ∣ed, such as galangal, cardamom, mace, and
<PB N="113" REF="039111_0436_1013A2984778CFB0"/>
the like; or an unfermented must, wort, or the mash for distilling spirits, are occasionally added, and allowed to ferment together with impure wines. To impart to wine the flavor of muscadel, the leaves of the <HI>Horminum,</HI> a spe∣cies of Sage (<HI>Salvia Horminium,</HI> L.) are often used; though it be a plant of a strong stupify∣ing smell, and very pernicious effects.</P>
<P>All adulterated wines, and what we call British wines, if drunk in any quantity, are more or less detrimental to health. For, even by the most innocent mode of preparing them in large quantities, the manufacturers are in∣duced to season them with spices of a heating and stimulating nature. But the most deleteri∣ous of all adulterations of wine, is that with the various preparations of lead, to give it a sweet taste. This infamous practice was carried on, some years ago, in Paris, to such an extent, that the Excise-office could not account for the prodigious increase of Vinegar entered at the city-gates. But it was at length discover∣ed, that this vinegar consisted only of tart and adulterated wines, imported under the pre∣tended character of vinegar, in order to avoid the high duty imposed upon wines, on their entrance into Paris: and sugar of lead, joined to some absorbent earths, was employed to change these vinegars into sweet wines, which destroyed the lives of many thousand persons. This secret of the utmost importance to health and life, was confessed by a rich old wine-mer∣chant, on his death-bed, to relieve in some de∣gree his tortured conscience.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="039111_0437_1013A25839CA9DE0"/>
Such adulterated wines operate like slow poisons; they first occasion head-ach, con∣traction of the throat, pain of the stomach, uneasiness, cough, difficulty of breathing; af∣terwards colics, and particularly the dry bel∣ly-ach, with continual obstipations, and at length palsy, convulsions, consumption, and death.—The brass cocks also, which are by some people used to draw of wine or cyder, are of the most dangerous tendency; as they easily yield and mix their verdigrise with the liquor.</P>
<P>To detect adulterated wines, we must at∣tend to the following particulars: every white or straw-coloured wine of a sweetish taste, af∣terwards astringent, and at the same time new; every wine that has an unusually high colour, not in proportion to its strength and age, or if it has the flavour of brandy, penetrates the tongue, or lastly, if it has an uncommonly strong flavour, may be justly suspected of adul∣teration.—Red wines, either of a very deep or a very faint colour; of a woody or tart taste; and those which cover the inner surface of the glass, as well as the bottom of the bot∣tles, with a red sediment, are generally tinged with some colouring substances. If such a wine be passed through filtering paper, the colouring particles will remain behind on the paper.</P>
<P>By the following method, we may easily discover, whether wines be adulterated, or col∣oured, with burnt sugar, raisins, whortle-ber∣ries, and the like. A small phial must be fill∣ed with the suspected wine; the opening is
<PB N="115" REF="039111_0438_1013A29BD8DEC688"/>
stopped with the finger, and the phial, being inverted, is plunged into a tumbler of water; the finger being withdrawn from the mouth of the phial, if the wine be adulterated the substance with which this is done, will visibly escape from the phial, and mix with the wa∣ter; in so far at least, as the addition is heav∣ier than water, which is generally the case.</P>
<P>These adulterations, however, are of little detriment to health, if they contain no <HI>metallic</HI> particles. In order to discover these, we are possessed of an excellent chemical test, contriv∣ed by Prof. HAHNEMANN, in Germany, and known by the name of <HI>Liquor vini probatorius.</HI> It is prepared as follows: One drachm of the dry liver of sulphur, and two drachms of cream of tartar, are shaken in two ounces of distilled water, till it be completely saturated with he∣patic air: the liquor is then filtered through blotting paper, and kept in a close stopped phial. From sixteen to twenty drops of this liquid are dropped into a small glass, filled with wine that is suspected to have been adul∣terated. If the wine turn only thick with white clouds, and deposit no other but a white sediment, we may be certain that it contains no metallic ingredients whatever; but if it turn black, or even dark, if its colour ap∣proach that of a dark red, if it have first a sweet, and then an astringent taste, it is cer∣tainly impregnated with sugar of lead, or some other preparation of that metal equally de∣structive. If, however, the dark colour be of a bluish cast, not unlike that of pale ink, we may suspect the wine to contain iron in its

composition. Lastly, if the wine be impreg∣nated with copper or verdigrise, it will deposit a sediment of a blackish grey colour. This experiment ought to be made with a fresh-prepared test, and in the open air.</P>
<P>It further merits attention, that white wines are very frequently coloured with burnt sugar and other vegetable bodies; they acquire a darker colour by being kept in oak casks, or by containing much tartar; and in all these cases they will be made somewhat darker by the above described test; but the sediment will not be of an uniform colour, and will consist only of some brown streaks.—It is well known, that all white wines must be impreg∣nated with a small quantity of sulphur, in or∣der to preserve them: if this be done in mod∣eration, it is not detrimental to health; but if too great a proportion of sulphur be used, such wine occasions great heat and thirst, it soon intoxicates, produces eruptions of the skin and face, head-ach, trembling of the limbs, and palpitation of the heart, hemor∣rhoidal complaints, gout, and a variety of nervous symptoms. Nothing is so easily dis∣covered as sulphur; for by putting a piece of silver, or even the shell of an egg, into an over∣sulpherated wine, it will instantly turn black.</P>
<P>Wines are sometimes adulterated by mixing quick-lime with them, in order to produce a beautiful ruby-colour. If such a wine be poured into a tumbler, and allowed to stand for a day or two, a thin crust or pellicle will be formed on the top, by which the lime held in solution will be detected. It is affirmed
<PB N="117" REF="039111_0440_1013A29D5C948F10"/>
that such wines, if used for any length of time, bring on gouty and gravelly complaints.</P>
<P>The most innocent adulteration of wine, and perhaps the most frequent, is that with water. If a small quantity of wine be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on quick∣lime, and if the lime be slackened by it, the wine then certainly contains water. But if the lime continues whole, the wine is pure and unmixed.</P>
<P><HI>Ardent spirits</HI> comprise all those liquors ob∣tained by fermenting vegetable, and particu∣larly farinaceous substances, to a certain de∣gree, and afterwards subjecting them to distil∣lation. All distilled liquors consist of a great proportion of alcohol or pure spirit, a greater or less quantity of water, and generally of a very small proportion of an empyreumatic oil, especially if distilled once only, or if this pro∣cess be carried on too quickly. Pure spirits are perfectly free from this oil, which, from its burnt and acrid nature, is altogether indi∣gestible. Proof spirits ought to consist of 55 parts of alcohol, and 45 of distilled water in 100: but rectified spirits of wine ought to have only 5 parts of water in the hundred: the specific gravity of the former being as 930, and that of the latter as 835, to 1000.</P>
<P>The intoxicating effects of spirits are but too well known; if they be distilled over pepper∣mint, balm, anniseed, or carraway, their strength is not much increased; but if over cinnamon, cloves, mace, or other hot spices, they are rendered still more heating, and per∣nicious to health.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="039111_0441_1013A25F895DEB30"/>
If drunk in hot weather, or after violent perspiration, they check this function, by con∣tracting the vessels of the skin, and closing the pores. On account of this contracting power, they are sometimes of service to a person whose stomach is overloaded with beer or water, to assist their passage through the proper emunc∣tories. After violent exercise and heat, a dram of spirits is more proper than cold water or beer, though a cup of tea or other diluent drink is preferable. After fat or strong food, spirits are exceedingly improper: for, instead of promoting the solution and digestion of food in the stomach, they rather tend to re∣tard it. We may be convinced of this, by attending to the effects they produce on inan∣imate substances: for these are preserved from dissolution and putrefaction more effectually in spirits, than in any other liquid. Thus we may learn, that spirits will impede diges∣tion, and render strong food taken into the stomach still more indigestible. Many persons are accustomed to take a dram as a remedy against flatulency: if the stomach be clean and undepraved, they will certainly be relieved by it; but, in the contrary case, their expecta∣tions will be disappointed.</P>
<P>Ardent spirits are rendered still more con∣tracting, and prejudicial to the stomach, when combined with acids, as in punch; and, for the same reason, the habit of taking drams after fruit, or any acid vegetable, is absurd. Notwithstanding the frequent abuse of spirits, they afford one of the most excellent antisep∣tics; but, if the human body be already re∣plete
<PB N="119" REF="039111_0442_1013A29FF6126840"/>
with vitiated humours, and troubled with frequent eructations, it is too late to cure it with gin or brandy. These liquors, however, are of considerable service in pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nting the bad effects of a moist and cold atmosphere, of pes∣tilential vapours, of very unclean occupations, of a damp military camp, and occasionally too, of a temporary abstinence from food.</P>
<P>To persons of relaxed fibres, distilled liquors may, under certain limitations, be useful, as they increase the elasticity and com∣pactness of the vessels. But to those, whose fibres are already rigid, spirits are obviously pernicious, and have a tendency to bring on a premature old age. They stop the growth of, and are otherwise very improper for, young persons.</P>
<P>That spirituous liquors incrassate and coag∣ulate the fluids, we may easily discover in those who are addicted to the use of them: they have a thick blood, are troubled with con∣stant obstructions of the intestines, and their unavoidable consequences; such as a gradual deprivation of the nervous system, loss of mem∣ory, debility of mind, hypochondriasis, jaun∣dice, dropsy, and at length consumption of the lungs. The throat and stomach of habitual tipplers are rendered callous, and at length al∣most closed, the glands are indurated, and con∣sequently digestion is in the highest degree impaired.</P>
<P><HI>Beer,</HI> considered according to its ingredi∣ents, consists of water, malt, and hops;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Besides these ingredients, Brewers are apt to add a number of other substances, some of which are extremely noxious, and all prohibited by law. These are <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ulus Indus,</HI> Coriander Seeds, Alum, Liquorice and Liquorice Root, burnt Sugar, Treacle, Cap∣sicum, Ginger, Copperas, &amp;c. &amp;c.—An useful pamphlet has late∣ly been published, called "<HI>Every Man his own Brewer,</HI>" detailing this manufacture, and, at the same time, shewing practically, how any private family, or even lodgers, may make Porter and Ale in the smallest quantities, at less than half the expense at which these articles are purchased.</NOTE> and
<PB N="120" REF="039111_0443_1013A2611162BEA0"/>
in proportion to the quantity, quality, and man∣ner of compounding them, it has received differ∣ent names, and is possessed of various degrees of salubrity. The more water there is used in brewing beer; it is the better calculated to quench thirst; but less so, if it contain a great proportion of the mucilaginous and saccharine principle of the grain. Strong beer, there∣fore, is very nourishing, and may be employ∣ed with advantage as a medicine, in emaciated habits.</P>
<P>The greater or less addition of hops to the malt, furnishes us with bitter or sweet beer. The former kind is preferable as a medicine; the latter is more used as a common beverage; but it is apt to excite flatulency and diarrhoea. Hops, like other bitter substances, preserve beer in its, vinous state, strengthen the stom∣ach, and dissolve viscid phlegm. Beer made of a great proportion of hops, and a small quantity of malt, is a good beverage, and well calculated to allay thirst.</P>
<P>There are great varieties in beer, accordingly as it is fermented; some kinds, such as those made of oats, in some parts of Germany, which are scarcely allowed to ferment at all, are very cooling in summer, but soon spoil; others are only half-fermented, such as the Dantzig spruce or black beer; others again
<PB N="121" REF="039111_0444_1013A2A1AD393988"/>
to a sufficient degree, like our porter and ale; and lastly some, which are more than suffi∣ciently fermented, such as Burton ale, and most of the strong home-brewed ales. All these are different in their effects, according to the various degrees of fermentation.</P>
<P>Every kind of beer is inclined to ferment, on account of its constituent parts. If it be not properly fermented, this takes place in the stomach itself; the fixed air, being disen∣gaged within the body, distends the stomach and bowels, and occasions flatulency and loose∣ness. However, when drunk in small quan∣tities, it is not attended with any great incon∣venience, particularly in summer, or in hot climates. It is used with great advantage at sea, against that great enemy of the mariner, the scurvy; those persons who have corrupt∣ed gums, that are painful and bleed on the least touch, ought to drink half a pint of wort, or unfermented beer, every morning and eve∣ning, keeping this liquor for a good while in their mouth; and they may promise them∣selves great benefit from this simple remedy.</P>
<P>Many consider beer or porter as excellent, when it foams much and makes a head, as it is called, on the top of the vessel; which is drunk by some tipplers with avidity, before it disappears. But this froth is not a proof of its good quality; but rather of its imper∣fect fermentation, which is continued and completed in the stomach. It is likewise of∣ten artificially increased, by the addition of improper ingredients. The volatile vapour, or gas, disengaged from such beer in the sto∣mach
<PB N="122" REF="039111_0445_1013A262A29F9238"/>
and bowels, produces a quantity of stim∣ulating and contracting air, by which the ali∣mentary canal is almost at the same time ex∣panded and contracted, so that the most dan∣gerous spasms and colics may thence arise. Such beer likewise emits a quantity of sulphu∣reous vapours; and for this reason it is dan∣gerous to go into cellars, where it is kept in a state of fermentation. A candle will often be extinguished by the vapour of cellars, which is sometimes so noxious as to suffocate per∣sons on their entrance.</P>
<P>If bottles filled with beer, ale, or porter, are not soon enough corked, it turns flat or sour, acquires an unpleasant taste, produces flatulency, colics, and spasms. If bottled and corked in proper time, the gas which it ought to contain is not dissipated; its agree∣ably pungent taste is preserved, and it is then a very excellent and nourishing liquor, which allays thirst, and does not affect digestion, like wine.—A person who has a good appetite, and takes nourishing food, requires no beer for its digestion; and, by drinking it, he is exposed to plethora, or a full habit, and all its concomitant complaints. Those, on the contrary, who take a great proportion of veg∣etable food, and have a weak stomach, will find a strong and bitter beer salutary.</P>
<P>As every new sort of beer is not equally grateful to the stomach, we would do well to desist from using that kind, to which we can∣not habituate ourselves in the course of two or three weeks. On account of the great variety of this liquor we meet with in travel∣ling,
<PB N="123" REF="039111_0446_1013A2A65F386A98"/>
it is much better to drink no beer at all on journeys, and instead of it to use lemonade, in hot weather, and wine or spirits mixed with water, when we travel in a damp and cold season.</P>
<P>Beer, in general, is nourishing, and has a tendency to fatten such individuals, as are of dry and rigid fibres, and whose bile is good. Hence the inhabitants of countries, in which beer is the principal beverage, are commonly more phlegmatic and indolent than those of wine-countries. Many sorts of beer, howev∣er, in which a greater than usual proportion of grain is used, contain much spirit, and are of a heating and inebriating nature. Such is, for instance, our Burton and several oth∣er ales, and all the strong kinds of foreign beer.</P>
<P>Light and well-fermented beer is a whole∣some and, at the same time, diluent species of nourishment. With persons already plethoric, or disposed to become corpulent, the lightest beer generally agrees best. Think and nour∣ishing beer is of service to wet-nurses and the debilitated. Sweet beers are only nourishing, but all the bitter kinds are strengthening also. The latter are beneficial in a weak state of digestion, and to people troubled with acid in the stomach; yet sweet beer is more whole∣some for daily use, and at the same time less exposed to dangerous adulterations. In short, beer is no proper beverage for people of a thick, black-bilious blood, and with a dispo∣sition to melancholy: it is the most useful species of drink to the weak, the lean, and the
<PB N="124" REF="039111_0447_1013A26771FB9BC8"/>
laborious; provided they are not very subject to flatulency, nor troubled with diseases of the breast. In both of these cases, I have found it uniformly to disagree, and to be much in∣ferior in salubrity to water.</P>
<P>A moderate use of fermented or distilled spirituous liquors is far less prejudicial to the constitution, than the habitual and excessive drinking of warm liquors. <HI>Tea,</HI> the common favourite among all ranks, if taken regularly twice a day, and in large quantities, is attend∣ed with bad consequences. It thoroughly re∣laxes the coats of the stomach, weakens the bowels, predisposes them to flatulency upon the least occasion, and destroys all the energy of the digestive organ. These effects, how∣ever, are not so frequent, nor indeed to that extent, if the tea be drank strong, sufficiently diluted with milk, and sweetened with sugar: it is chiefly the warm water, which renders the tea of the common people so destructive to the constitution, as they generally make up for the indifferent quality of the tea, by the quan∣tity of water.</P>
<P>The tea-leaf, which has employed the pens of so many eminent writers, still deserves some attention; as the nature and properties of it are but imperfectly understood. It certainly is an aromatic, slightly astringent, and some∣what narcotic plant. Whether it possess any diuretic, diaphoretic, and other virtues, for which it has been celebrated, is rather doubtful; as these may be in part owing to the great quantities of warm water, with which the infusions of it are made. Good tea, par∣ticularly the black sort, in moderate quantity,
<PB N="125" REF="039111_0448_1013A2A7E40BA558"/>
and made strong, is antispasmodic and refresh∣ing. It is, therefore, calculated to relieve the cramp of the stomach, and pains of the abdo∣men, if they proceed from flatulency. But, according to circumstances, it may even in∣crease spasmodic contractions; for instance, if it arise from a vitiated bile, from worms, or from hysteric and gouty complaints; in all which cases tea will most certainly not re∣lieve, but rather prolong the spasmodic con∣traction of the vessels. The relaxation which tea occasions in the first passages, renders it peculiarly hurtful to females of lax fibres, a thin blood, and irritable habits. To enumerate the great diversity of nervous symptoms, at∣tending its abuse in such constitutions, would lead me too far from the prescribed limits; but so much is certain, that the vapours arising from liquors drunk very hot like tea, weaken the lungs, and dispose their votaries to frequent colds and cararrhs, which readily make a transi∣tion into consumptions.</P>
<P>Individuals of a rigid and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>, of a dry and firm body, may be allowed to drink tea in moderation, as it will not easily hurt them. By adding a table-spoonful of old Rhenish wine, or ardent spirits, to every cup of tea, it may be so far improved, as to make it less flatulent; but the frequent repetition of it, even in this form, must be detrimental to the body. A moderate use of tea may sometimes be of service to persons in a perfect state of health; yet, for daily use, it cannot be recom∣mended. It doubtless occasions a gentle stim∣ulus, and rouses the mind for a short time;
<PB N="126" REF="039111_0449_1013A268F758F5E8"/>
hence it is perhaps the best and safest refresh∣ment after violent heat and fatigue of the body. As the means of increasing perspiration, tea is an useful beverage to travellers in cold weather, when insensible perspiration is liable to be checked.</P>
<P>Hypochondriac and hysteric people, how∣ever, are much deceived in the efficacy of tea, as a diluent drink; for all the evils arising from relaxation, a weak stomach, and flatulency, under which such persons usually labour, are, by the habit of drinking tea, increased to the most alarming degree. The <HI>cold</HI> stomach, which they propose to <HI>warm</HI> by it, is a mere phantom of the brain; for this sensation of cold is nothing but relaxation, which cannot be removed by <HI>hot</HI> liquors, but is increased by every repetition of them.</P>
<P>It would be a great proof of a patriotic spirit in this country, if the use of this exotic drug were either altogether abandoned, or, at least, supplied by some indigenous plants of equal flavour, and superior salubrity. The Chinese have good reason to smile at our degenerate taste, when they are informed, that we actu∣ally possess an immense variety of the most valuable aromatic plants, much better calcu∣lated by nature to invigorate our stomachs, and to revive our spirits, than tea, which we purchase from them at great expense. These sentiments may be ungrateful to tea-dealers, or East-India merchants, but every honest truth should be candidly told to an unbiassed public.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="039111_0450_1013A2AA8BE3F9D0"/>
It would undoubtedly be more conducive to our health, if we could altogether dispense with the use of warm liquors, at least when in a state of health. But, if this practice must be indulged in, we ought to choose the herbs growing in our own meadows and gardens, in∣stead of making ourselves tributary to distant nations. With this intention, the late Dr. Solander introduced his <HI>Sanative Tea;</HI> not with a view of making it a secret or quack∣medicine, under which character it is now sold in this country, but of recommending the use of it to those individuals who require dilu∣ent liquors, and to the heavy, sluggish, and phlegmatic. Dr. Tissot had previously recom∣mended the stalks of cherries, and the leaves of peach and almond trees, to the poor people of Switzerland, as substitutes for tea; but we possess a variety of plants infinitely superior to these, of which I have myself occasionally made trial. I shall divide these into three classes; namely,</P>
<P>1st, The strong, spicy, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> plants, such as balm, peppermint, sage, and the like.</P>
<P>2d, The strongly aromatic flowers, among which those of the <HI>Rosa pimpinellae folia</HI> (or the rose whose leaves resemble those of the Burnet-saxifrage) and the <HI>wood-roof,</HI> or the <HI>Asperula odorata,</HI> L., deserve the first place, and far excel in flavour all the teas imported from China; and lastly,</P>
<P>3d, The mild aromatic leaves and blossoms of trees and shrubs, for instance, the blossoms of the lime-tree and the black thorn, the leaves of the peach and almond-trees, and particu∣larly
<PB N="128" REF="039111_0451_1013A26BCFEAA948"/>
the first tender leaves of the <HI>whortle-berries,</HI> or the <HI>Vaccinium Myrtillus,</HI> L., which cannot be distinguished from real tea, when properly gathered, and dried in the shade.</P>
<P>After having pointed out the best substitutes for Indian Tea, I cannot suppress my earnest wish, that even these indigenous vegetables may not be abused by decocting them in too much water, which, when swallowed hot, must be detrimental to the stomach, the lungs, the nerves, and the whole human frame. I cannot better conclude this important article, than by quoting the prophetic words of an ex∣perienced physician.—"Tea," says he, "will induce a total change of constitution in the people of this country. Indeed it has gone a great way towards effecting that evil already. A debility, and consequent irritability of fibre, are become so common, that not only women, but even men are affected with them. That class of diseases, which, for want of a better name, we call nervous, has made almost a complete <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the one sex, and is mak∣ing hasty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> towards vanquishing the other." And Dr. Buchan emphatically con∣cludes: "Did women know the train of dis∣eases induced by debility, and how disagreea∣ble these diseases render them to the other sex, they would shun tea as the most deadly poison. No man can love a woman eaten up with va∣pours, or washed down with diseases arising from relaxation."</P>
<P><HI>Coffee</HI> is a decoction of the well-known bean or berry of that name, roasted and ground into a powder. The bitter and astringent
<PB N="129" REF="039111_0452_1013A2ADCAA455B0"/>
powers of the beans, in some measure, correct the bad properties of warm water; but if they be too much roasted, their empyreumatic oil is expelled, and they acquire an insipid taste. If, on the other hand, they be not sufficiently roasted, this burnt oil is not evolved to the sur∣face of the bean, and the coffee acquires a bit∣ter and unpleasant flavour. This beverage is generally considered as strengthening to the stomach. It promotes digestion, dispels flatu∣lency, removes vertigo and torpor, exhilarates the mind, increases the circulation of the blood and insensible perspiration, attenuates viscid humours, is diuretic, and sometimes gently aperient. These properties of Coffee being, in a great measure, confirmed by ex∣perience, justly make it a valuable medicine, which is eminently qualified to cure the most troublesome head-achs, provided they origin∣ate from the stomach, or from a bad state of concoction. Coffee drunk after dinner pro∣motes digestion; and agues, diarrhoeas, and giddiness, have been frequently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>moved by it. Its subtle oil stimulates the solids, rarefies the blood, and consequently is of particular service to females of a sedentary life, and to those who suffer from phlegmatic and catarrhal dis∣eases. If drank too strong, it affects the nerves, and by its penetrating property often occasions sleeplessness, and tremor of the hands; but, in some phlegmatic and indolent individuals, it is apt to excite sleep.</P>
<P>If coffee be not used merely as a diluent for relaxing the fibres, it ought to be made strong. The best proportion is, one ounce of
<PB N="130" REF="039111_0453_1013A26E58FBC080"/>
well-roasted and ground coffee to one pound or one pint of water, which should be just allowed to boil up: for the longer it is boiled, it loses the more of its volatile and aromatic particles, and consequently becomes weak and insipid.—As coffee is possessed, of excellent antispasmodic virtues, it is a favourite bever∣age with the hypochondriac and the hysteric; and according to early observation, it is also the best and most effectual remedy in spas∣modic asthma.</P>
<P>The steam of boiled coffee has frequently been beneficial to weak eyes. If drunk in the morning, and immediately after dinner, of a proper strength, and not above one or two small cups, it is a wholesome substitute for tea or spirits, particularly to persons in a good state of health, and to such as are not habitual wine-drinkers, or of a very irritable temper∣ament.—Lastly, the coffee of the Levant far excels that imported from the West Indies, which is frequently steeped in sea-water, in or∣der to make it weigh heavier. This fradulent practice may be easily detected, by soaking the raw coffee in water, and examining its taste.</P>
<P>An <HI>immoderate</HI> use, however, of this decoc∣tion is prejudicial to the healthy, and destruc∣tive to the diseased: it debilitates the latter still more, by causing great undulations in the blood, tremor of the limbs, giddiness, and a certain insupportable timidity. It leads peo∣ple of a sanguine temperament, and particu∣larly females, to the long train of all the fash∣ionable nervous diseases. It frequently occasions a disagreeable eruption in the face, and brings
<PB N="131" REF="039111_0454_1013A2B1767377E8"/>
on many troublesome disorders, occasions bleedings of the nose, and sometimes spitting of blood, induces frequent hemorrhoids, a hectic cough, and at last consumption and death.—If coffee be drunk after dinner, with a view to promote digestion, it requires no milk to dilute it, and render it weaker: but, if it be used for breakfast, some milk or cream is necessary, to sheath or neutralize the empy∣reumatic oil it contains, which fires the blood, and occasions violent flushings, accompanied with choleric sensations.</P>
<P>All the kinds of mock coffee, made of rye, wheat, peas, dried carrots, beet, the succory-root, and the like, have little resemblance to it, except what they acquire by their burnt taste and empyreumatic oil. A coffee made of acorns is much recommended in asthmatic and spasmodic complaints; but as it contains an uncommon quantity of oil, which is dan∣gerous and heating to the blood, too much circumspection cannot be employed in the use of it. From my own experience, I recom∣mend to begin with adding about one eighth, then one sixth, and gradually a greater part of the burnt acorns to the coffee, till at length they may be used in equal quantities.</P>
<P><HI>Chocolate,</HI> especially when boiled with milk and eggs, is exceedingly nourishing: but the spices with which it is mixed, such as cinna∣mon, cloves, musk, vanilla, and the like, make it more heating and less wholesome. Vanilla, which we always find in the Spanish Chocolate, is an extremely volatile and pungent aromatic; even its flavour is frequently insupportable to
<PB N="132" REF="039111_0455_1013A272067048F0"/>
hysteric and hypochondriac persons; it occa∣sions violent head-ach, trembling, giddiness, and other symptoms, occurring in these com∣plaints. The common chocolate, prepared with sugar, eggs, milk, and water, is the most nutritive and wholesome; but a too frequent and immoderate use of it is always hurtful, particularly to the individuals before alluded to, as the cacao is too fat and indigestible to them, and creates a false or forced appetite. <HI>Cacao,</HI> of itself, is less heating and lighter than if made into chocolate, but it is not so nour∣ishing. The immoderate use of this oily bev∣erage is apt to induce a febrile state in young people, and to supply the sedentary with su∣perfluous nourishment; while it frequently brings on, like coffee, a state of irritability and uneasiness. To the corpulent and weak it is improper; and if they be immoderate eat∣ers, they are hastening to contract inflamma∣tory diseases and apoplexies. It also disagrees with persons much employed in mental pur∣suits; and those who imagine that it will sup∣ply their losses, sustained by nocturnal debauch∣eries of whatever kind, will find themselves disappointed in their hopes: by continually drinking chocolate, and using other nutritive substances, they will, indeed, be stimulated to new irregularities, but eventually at the expense of their palsied nerves, and their broken frame. In children threatened with a wasting, or <HI>tabes dorsalis,</HI> as likewise in some kinds of consump∣tion in adults, Chocolate, with a sufficient quantity of milk, may be beneficial; but even in these cases a strong decoction of roasted
<PB N="133" REF="039111_0456_1013A2B2FAA6C540"/>
oatmeal in milk, with a small addition of choc∣olate, is much better calculated to effect a cure.</P>
<P><HI>Punch</HI> is a well-known beverage, the com∣position of which requires no description, as it may be made of every kind of spirituous liquor, diluted, with water, acid and sugar. If a proper quantity of acid be used, it is an ex∣cellent antiseptic, and well calculated, to sup∣ply the place of wine, in resisting putrefaction, especially if drunk cold and with plenty of sugar: it also promotes perspiration; but, if drunk hot and immoderately, it creates acidi∣ty in the stomach, weakens the nerves, and gives rise to complaints of the breast. After a heavy meal it is improper, as it may check digestion, and injure the stomach.</P>
<P><HI>Negus</HI> is one of the most innocent and whole∣some species of drink, especially if Seville or∣anges be added to red Port wines, instead of lemons; and drunk moderately, it possesses considerable virtues in strengthening the stom∣ach; but, on account of the volatile and heat∣ing oil in the orange-peel, negus, if taken in great quantities, is more stimulant and drying than pure wine itself. Persons troubled with the hemorrhoids, and diseases of the breast, should not indulge themselves in this, nor in the pre∣ceding species of drink.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude this section without men∣tioning vinegar and oil, two substances which partly belong to the department of drink, and partly to that of spices.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="039111_0457_1013A2738D4892E0"/>
<HI>Vinegar</HI> is an excellent preservative of ani∣mal substances from putrefaction, especially in a warm temperature; and I cannot but regret that this invaluable liquor is too little used in our kitchens, as well as upon our tables. It promotes digestion, and is perhaps never com∣municated to the blood in its acid state: hence it is an erroneous notion, that vinegar is detri∣mental to the secretion and quality of the milk in wet-nurses. In some individuals, however, it is apt to produce a sudorific effect, and even laxity of the bowels, on account of its astrin∣gent property. Used with moderation, as an article of seasoning rather than drink, especial∣ly in warm weather and with animal food, it is both savoury and wholesome. But we ought to be careful to obtain <HI>good</HI> vinegar; for vari∣ous kinds of it, which are made of sloes, the husks of nuts, and other strong astringents, certainly are pernicious to health. The best and most palatable vinegar is that obtained from white wines, raisins, and sugar.</P>
<P><HI>Oil</HI> is preferable to animal fat, but ought to be fresh, mild, and of a sweetish taste. It sel∣dom or never agrees with weak stomachs; for in them, even in its mildest state, it easily gen∣erates a rancid acrimony, extremely injurious to digestion. It should be eaten with much bread, when used in salads or otherwise, as it requires a powerful and active bile to assimilate it to alimentary matter. Olives and almonds yield the greatest quantity of oil; and next to Province oil, that expressed from walnuts and chesnuts, is the sweetest, and easiest of digestion.</P>

<P>Spices, of themselves, are not nourishing, but are used merely to improve the taste and flavour of substances, to prevent flatulency, and to promote digestion. Some spices, being extremely volatile, and occasioning too strong a stimulus, do more harm than good. As they are apt to heat the blood, to increase perspiration, occasionally to affect the head, and to stimulate the nerves, spices, in general, should be used only by persons possessing a strong constitution, or by those of a lax fibre, and cold phlegmatic habit: as, on the contra∣ry, individuals naturally lean and dry, as well as the choleric and phlegmatic, ought to be sparing and cautious in the use of heating spices. The most conducive to health would be the indigenous spices, though some of the foreign kind have now become indispensable in our present mode of living. The most com∣mon, and perhaps the most useful, are:</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Salt.</HI> It corrodes the fibres of plants and animals, disorganizes the connection of parts too firm for the solution of the stomach, dis∣solves the glutinous parts, and prepares them for being better digested by the stomach. Pro∣visions of a tough and viscid consistence, there∣fore, require much salt; for instance, beef, mutton, fish, peas, beans, fat, &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is little danger of using too much salt with <HI>fresh</HI> vict∣uals, as the only consequence arising from excess would be a slight laxity of the bowels.—In order to obtain salt as pure as possible, and free from the bitter magnesia, which is the great promoter of putrefaction, I take this opportunity of recommending an inge∣nious and simple process lately invented by <HI>Lord Dundonald,</HI> one of the most zealous and able cultivators of the useful arts; Dis∣solve as much common salt in a given quantity of boiling water as it is capable of containing in solution. Take another quanti∣ty of salt not larger than the former, and put it into a glass fun∣nel, or similar vessel of wood or earthen-ware, which ought to be lined with coarse thick lin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n cloth. While the strong brine is hot, pour it over the dry salt, of which it will not dissolve a particle, but merely wash away the magnesia and other impuri∣ties adhering to its surface; and by repeating this effusion sever∣al times, the washed salt will become tolerably pure. The whole of this process depends on the principle, that water can dissolve only a certain quantity of salt, and that the magnesia may be washed away by such a supersaturated solution, while the salt to which it adheres remains insoluble. Salt thus purified will doubtless be more wholesome, and more effectual for all the pur∣poses of salting and pickling provisions; as the magnesia contain∣ed in the common salt renders double, perhaps triple the quanti∣ty necessary, which would be required, were it in a pure state, or deprived of the magnesia.</NOTE>—Hence
<PB N="136" REF="039111_0459_1013A276214ADF78"/>
salt beef and herrings agree so well with veg∣etables, because the abundance of salt in the former, seasons the latter. But too copious a use of salted provisions is extremely prejudi∣cial; they weaken the solids, and the blood becomes thin, acrid, and disposed to putres∣cency; hence arise scurvy in all its stages, eruptions of the skin, consumptions, and other diseases.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Sugar</HI> is at present one of the first neces∣saries of life. It is an unfounded conjecture, that sugar renders the blood thick or viscid; on the contrary, it is possessed of diluent and attenuating properties. But the immoderate use of sugar, especially the moist and coarse sort, may in a considerable degree prevent di∣gestion, by consuming the oleaginous part of our fluids, impeding the assimilation of food, and generating mucus and acidity in the ali∣mentary canal.</P>
<P>It has frequently been asserted, that sugar injures the teeth: this, however, is not strictly
<PB N="137" REF="039111_0460_1013A2B8A594F8C0"/>
true; for it is only by its vitiating the stomach, and generating impure blood, that the teeth become sympathetically affected. Hence per∣sons of weak digestion, those with debilitated nerves, the hypochondriac, hysteric women, and especially children subject to complaints arising from worms, ought to use this luxuri∣ous substance sparingly, and only occasionally. If moderately used, it promotes digestion, being a gently solvent and stimulating salt. But, where people take it without moderation, su∣gar may prevent digestion, not on account of its substance, but by obstructing the assimila∣tion of food, so that it produces slimy and acid matters in the alimentary canal. The acid which sugar contains, renders it an excellent remedy against putrescence. The finest sort of sugar being freed of all impurities, is the best and most wholesome. Yet, in sore throats and other catarrhal affections, I would prefer sugar-candy or moderately fine loaf-sugar, to that which is double refined, on ac∣count of some particles of lime and clay, ne∣cessarily remaining in the latter, from the manner in which it is prepared.—Other sweet substances, such as honey, cannot altogether supply the place of sugar, as they are not pos∣sessed of the same properties; but there have been already made some very successful exper∣iments with the American maple-tree, (<HI>Acer saccharinus</HI>) which afford great hopes that we may obtain this valuable and indispensable salt, in future times, from that quarter of the globe, in sufficient quantities, and at a reason∣able price, when the most flagitious of all

trades, that in human flesh, shall have been entirely abolished.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I must on this occasion refer the reader to the account I have given of the <HI>beet-root,</HI> (p. 81.) which promises to become an invaluable, copious, and perma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent substitute for sugar.</NOTE></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Honey,</HI> like sugar, contains an acid, but many more inflammable particles; it easily ferments, and therefore occasions flatulency. In some particular habits it is apt to occasion gripes and looseness: as a medicine, it is use∣ful to the asthmatic, to promote the expecto∣ration of tough phlegm; and so far it is an useful detergent and aperient. But, as a part of diet, when immoderately used, it is hurtful to weak stomachs, and ought to be avoided by people who are troubled with a superabun∣dance of bile, and whose humours incline to putrefaction.</P>
<P N="4">4. The different species of <HI>Pepper,</HI> being strongly heating and stimulating, should be used with precaution. Yet its peculiar warm∣ing and stomachic virtues make it an excellent spice, and proper to be used with fat, tough, and smoked meat, with flatulent vegetables, with the cooling cucumbers and melons, as well as with fish and other substances difficult of digestion. Pepper ought, for these purpo∣ses, to be coarsely ground. If taken in whole grains, it imparts to the stomach only a small part of its virtues, and cannot be reduced in digestion. In this form it is an old and ef∣fectual domestic remedy of the Germans, a∣gainst viscidity in the stomach, flatulency, weak digestion, and consequent giddiness. For these purposes, from six to ten pepper-grains
<PB N="139" REF="039111_0462_1013A2BC509B82B8"/>
should be swallowed in the morning, on an empty stomach. Yet I would not ad∣vise this practice to be followed, except to some very vitiated stomachs, which have been accustomed to spices and spirituous liquors, and with whom the pepper may serve as a sub∣stitute for drams.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Cubebs, Cardamoms, Vanilla</HI> and <HI>Cloves,</HI> are hot, pungent, and consequently improper for daily use.—<HI>Cubebs</HI> are much inferior in pungency to pepper.—<HI>Cardamoms</HI> are a warm and grateful aromatic; they do not, like those of the pepper kind, immoderately heat and inflame the bowels; hence they certainly de∣serve the preference for common use.—<HI>Vanil∣la</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vanilla is the pod of the <HI>Epidendron,</HI> L. growing in Cayenne and some parts of Spanish America. The largest pods are some∣times six inches long, narrow, and almost triangular, soft, oleaginous, externally of the appearance of leather, and internally filled with a dark brown pulp, in which we find a great number of small black or brownish red and shining seeds. These have a pun∣gent aromatic and oily taste, and a strongly balsamic odour, much resembling that of the Peruvian balsam. A very small propor∣tion of these seeds, for instance, a grain to an ounce, is sufficient to impart to the Chocolate the very agreeable flavour which we generally meet with in that imported from Spain and Milan.</NOTE> is warming, resolvent, strengthening to the stomach, and a remedy for flatulency. In chocolate, it assists the digestion of the oily substance of the cacao.</P>
<P><HI>Cloves</HI> are hot and stimulant aromatics, but formerly seldom obtained genuine in this coun∣try, as the Dutch frequently mixed them with other cloves, previously deprived of their es∣sential oil by distillation.—<HI>Mace</HI> and <HI>Nutmeg</HI> are less heating, and therefore preferable for common use; but the former is still more

so than the latter, which is supposed to have an astringent virtue, and is employed with that intention in diarrhoeas and dysenteries.—<HI>Cinnamon</HI> is undoubtedly the most delicate spice, but is seldom obtained pure from the mercenary Dutch, who were accustomed to send us more Cassia than real cinnamon. The <HI>Cassia</HI> bark, though resembling that of cinna∣mon in taste, is much less heating, and cer∣tainly more beneficial for common use than cinnamon, which is better calculated to an∣swer medicinal purposes. The bark of cas∣sia is thicker and coarser; it breaks short and smooth, while the cinnamon breaks fibrous and shivery.—<HI>Pimento,</HI> or Jamaica pepper, re∣sembles in its smell a mixture of cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg, whence it has received the name of <HI>all-spice;</HI> it is milder than the East-India pepper, and is an useful addition to broths and stewed dishes, when used, as it ought to be, in whole grains.—<HI>Ginger</HI> is one of the most agreeable and wholesome spices, espe∣cially boiled whole in beer, and drunk by people moving in the open air, and in cold weather. But this spice, as employed by the bakers for gingerbread, does a great deal of mischief, especially to the stomachs of chil∣dren; though it may occasionally be service∣able to travellers, early in the morning, and on an empty stomach.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If the bakers knew what the substance is, with which they gild its outside, to invite children to eat their ill-contrived ginger∣bread, I venture to hope they would desist from so pernicious a practice. This gold leaf, or Dutch gold, is actually manufac∣tured of brass or copper, one of the most virulent metallic poisons. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/>.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="039111_0464_1013A2BDD5076858"/>
The indigenous, spicy, and balsamic herbs, such as <HI>parsley, marjoram, thyme, sage,</HI> and the like, cannot be too much recommended for culinary use, especially in broths; as they are well calculated, by their aromatic virtues, to assist the digestion of many strong articles of food, which daily cover our tables; and these excellent herbs are not liable to the adultera∣tions with which most of the foreign spices are vitiated.</P>
<P N="6">6. Among all the native spices, there is none, in my opinion, which excels, in medicinal virtues, the common <HI>Caraway.</HI> The seeds of this plant are the mildest and most useful car∣minative we possess. To people of a weak digestion, troubled with flatulency and colics, they afford the most certain relief, if used in sufficient quantity; for instance, a table-spoon∣ful at a time, early in the morning, and one hour before a meal: or still better, if these seeds are plentifully used in bread, and among cooked victuals. Yet here I must caution those of a hot and bilious temperament, as likewise individuals liable to obstructions and habitual costiveness, not to use these seeds in∣discriminately, and without consulting a pro∣fessional man.</P>
<P>Caraway-seeds, finely pounded, with a small proportion of ginger and salt, spread upon bread and butter, and eaten every day, espe∣cially early in the morning, and at night be∣fore going to bed is successfully used in Ger∣many as a domestic remedy against hysterics, and will, no doubt, effectually cure the dis∣ease, provided it does not arise from improper
<PB N="142" REF="039111_0465_1013A27DEF0E3808"/>
diet, obstructions of the intestines and other vessels, passion, bile, acrid humours, and the like; in all which cases the caraway and ginger will certainly do more harm than good; as each of these causes must be removed by the apposite means.</P>
<P>If, however, caraway be kept in a pounded state, for the purpose of overcoming the dis∣position to flatulency and indigestion, it soon turns rancid, and may prove hurtful, on ac∣count of the strong oil it contains.—The plant of caraway is one of the early spring-herbs, and makes an excellent addition to salads. The seeds, when distilled with ardent spirits, yield a very heating and pernicious oil, which ren∣ders such spirits still more detrimental to health, than when they are in a pure state.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of EVACUATIONS;—their different species, as well as their peculiar nature investigated; to∣gether with the necessary directions for their management, according to the different states of the body.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>THE evacuations of the body, from its su∣perfluous, impure, and noxious parti∣cles, are no less necessary than its nourishment. The same power which changes and assimilates our food and drink, likewise effects the due and timely evacuation of what is secreted. It is an object of the first consequence, that nothing remain in the body, which ought to be evacuated; and that nothing be ejected, which may be of use to its preservation.</P>
<P>How many persons do we find complaining of bad health, notwithstanding every attention they pay to the air they breathe, to aliment, exercise, sleep, &amp;c.; while others enjoy a good state of health, though totally careless with regard to these particulars. Indeed, much depends on a proper state of the evacu∣ations.—If these be disordered, the most rigor∣ous observance of dietetic rules is insufficient to insure our health; while, on the contrary, most of those rules may be neglected, for some time, without any injurious consequen∣ces, if the evacuations be duly attended to.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="039111_0473_1013A28833399DF0"/>
Nature removes not only the noxious mat∣ter, or such as is in a state of corruption, but likewise the useful fluids, if they become su∣perabundant; for instance, the milk, the semen, the blood. In such cases, therefore, these must be considered as objects of evacua∣tion, equally natural and salutary.</P>
<P>By <HI>stool,</HI> the thick and feculent remains of assimilated food are evacuated; for every ar∣ticle of aliment contains more or less dregs, and their smallest particles only can be changed into the milky fluid, or chyle.</P>
<P>By <HI>urine,</HI> we eject the oily and saline parti∣cles secreted from the blood, in a diluted state; which prevents these particles from injuring the external membranes, by their irritating acrimony.</P>
<P>By <HI>insensible perspiration,</HI> which is carried on through the smallest orifices of the pores, the most subtile and noxious particles of the fluids are evaporated; which, if they were retained within the body, would lay the foun∣dation of its total corruption.</P>
<P>Nature expels all crude and acrid substances by these three principal emunctories; and ac∣cordingly as they are disordered, diseases of different degrees of malignity and duration will necessarily ensue.—Nature also frequently relieves herself by more unusual channels; such are, the bleeding of the nose in plethoric young men, the hemorrhoids with which per∣sons of a middle age are sometimes troubled, the various ulcers common to those whose fluids are in an impure state, the excretions of saliva, and the expectorations of others, &amp;c.
<PB N="151" REF="039111_0474_1013A2CD8411CF20"/>
By a premature suppression of these trouble∣some but salutary efforts of nature, great mis∣chief may be produced to the individual.</P>
<P>Many persons perspire much under the arm∣pits, others in their hands or feet; others again are subject to eruptions in the face or other parts of the body; such canals, howev∣er, if Nature be once accustomed to eject by them certain useless and hurtful particles, can∣not be hastily stopped, without occasioning greater and more dangerous inconveniences; cleanliness, in the strictest sense of the word, is almost the only safe remedy to counteract their fatal effects.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Evacuations by Stool.</HEAD>
<P>As the food and drink we consume every day, necessarily deposits useless matter, a daily opening by stool is extremely salutary; par∣ticularly to persons subject to costiveness and the many disagreeable consequences thence arising. Of these I shall only enumerate fre∣quent head-achs, difficult breathing, flatu∣lency, eructations, and spasms: hence peev∣ishness of temper, general lethargy, and at length, hypochondriasis;—the abdomen of such persons feels tumid; the circulation of the blood in the intestinal vessels is retarded; and, consequently, the general circulation in∣terrupted. These complaints, sooner or later, certainly attend habitual costiveness; especial∣ly if no other kind of evacuation, as that by urine, or insensible perspiration, be in an uncommon degree increased.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="039111_0475_1013A28AF667A490"/>
In healthy individuals, the evacuation by stool usually takes place once or twice a-day; and, according to the habits of the person, either in the morning or evening. Those who are troubled with costiveness should visit the customary retreat, regularly every morn∣ing at a fixed hour, and thus endeavour to pro∣mote this necessary evacuation by proper ef∣forts, though they may not, at the moment, feel much inclination; for it is well founded on experience, that Nature at length will be habituated, by perseverance, to observe a cer∣tain regularity in this respect. The most proper time for these attempts is early in the morning, or late in the evening.</P>
<P>Whatever dietetic means may be adopted to promote stool ought to be employed either from three to four hours previous to the time we wish to succeed, or immediately before go∣ing to bed. If in the morning, we ought to rise early, to take first a slice of bread with much fresh butter; then eat some boiled prunes; drink two or three cups of the decoc∣tion; and, if necessary, assist the operation of the whole with a tea-spoonful or two of cream of tartar in treacle. Thus prepared, we ought to walk a little in the open air, or, if the weather be unfavourable, about the room; to rub the lower belly with the palm of the hand; and, when we sit down, to re∣tain the breath, by frequently, though mod∣erately, inspiring; and, lastly, to change the posture of the body, from a straight to a crooked and sidelong direction, till we suc∣ceed in the attempt.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="039111_0476_1013A2CBE970CF78"/>
Although these trials should repeatedly fail, we must not be discouraged from persevering in them; nor ought we, without absolute necessity, to choose any other than the wonted hour to attain the end proposed; so that this, at length, may become the only time, when Nature shall spontaneously assist our endeav∣ours. During these practices, however, the choice of our diet is of the greatest moment; as we can powerfully promote the desired end, by living chiefly upon rye-bread, spinage, boil∣ed fruit, particularly prunes, decoctions of currants, the sweet and emollient vegetables, especially the beet-root, and occasionally salted meat; the last of which should be assisted with much drink, not of the spirituous kind, but rather of a mild and aperient nature, such as sweet table-beer, whey, infusions of malt, ap∣ples, pears, and the like.</P>
<P>It deserves to be remarked, that if every effort of this kind prove abortive, the volun∣tary exertions in promoting stool should not be carried to an extravagant degree; as by such unnatural pressure we may bring on rup∣tures, the bursting of veins in the rectum, or the piles. Hence it is more adviseable to ab∣stain, for some time, from all crude and solid aliment, and to use only such articles of food and drink as have been before pointed out. And if this also should not be attended with the desired effect, we may then have recourse to the mild purgatives, such as rhubarb, senna, cream of tartar, and the neutral salts.</P>
<P>While too much rest, and a sedentary life, prevent this species of daily evacuation, gentle
<PB N="154" REF="039111_0477_1013A28DCB1F3AA0"/>
exercise, accompanied with serenity of mind, almost certainly promote it. In many fami∣lies, costiveness is an habitual and hereditary distemper. Sometimes too it originates from a weakness of the intestinal canal brought on by diseases, but more frequently from the hab∣itual use of certain substances of food and drink; for instance, the lean flesh of quadrupeds, game, the leguminous vegetables, red Port wine, strong and bitter malt liquor, and the like. Hence the pre-disposing cause of the complaint should always be attended to. If it arise from weakness, red wine, bitter ale, and other cor∣roborants, are well calculated to effect a cure. In every instance, frequent exercise in the open air is extremely useful. Persons living sparingly on animal food, and who are other∣wise temperate in their passions and desires, are seldom deprived of this natural benefit; and even though they should be without it for two or three days together, they have little to apprehend from such irregularity; for, as they do not wantonly overload their stomach, the accumulation of impurities cannot be con∣siderable.</P>
<P>Where weakness and atony, or laxity of the intestines, are the causes of a costive habit, the external use of cold water, by affusion on the lower belly or merely washing it with that fluid, is frequently preferable to all other dietetic remedies. This is one of the most simple means of preventing painful costiveness; though it ought not to be applied indiscrimi∣nately, and least of all in those cases where
<PB N="155" REF="039111_0478_1013A2D13A202C38"/>
the use of the cold bath is improper and hurt∣ful.—If debility and relaxation of the intestin∣al canal be the cause of costiveness, clysters of cold water alone are generally productive of singular benefit; yet these also cannot be used without many exceptions—not, for instance, by females, during the menses, by persons af∣flicted with the piles, or having weak lungs, nor in certain kinds of colics and spasms.</P>
<P>The discharges by stool ought to be neither in too liquid nor too dry a state. Strong labour, heating drinks, and long fasting, ren∣der them disagreeably hard, even in the health∣iest individuals; from the feces remaining too long in the region of the lacteals, so that the nutritious or milky part of the concocted mass is exhausted to the last drop, and there re∣mains behind no other but dry, excrementi∣tious matter. These stools, therefore, are frequently a symptom of good digestion, such as attends sound constitutions in general.</P>
<P>Too dry excrements, in the form of balls, especially in delicate individuals, occasion head-ach, inflammation of the eyes, febrile complaints, hemorrhoids, ruptures, paralytic affections, and frequently produce flatulency and spasms, in persons subject to hysterics and hypochondriasis: nay, even the suppression of flatulency is extremely dangerous. Those who are apt to delay going to stool, expose them∣selves to many serious inconveniences. When this sensation is lost, it does not usually return for some time. The feces collected in the intestinal canal powerfully distend it, give rise to the blind hemorrhoids, and sometimes even
<PB N="156" REF="039111_0479_1013A291738CF5E0"/>
to a falling down of the anus; the excrements become dry, and their re-absorbed fluid parts irritate and vitiate the blood, and produce many obstinate distempers. If a person has been costive for several days, the inclination to go to stool is sometimes lost, until restored by artificial means.</P>
<P>Loose and too frequent stools are common with those, who take more aliment than their stomach can digest; for the food, from the stimulus occasioned by its corruption in the alimentary canal, is too soon ejected, without being duly assimilated. Hence debilitated per∣sons, who eat immoderately, generally are thinner and less muscular than others, who observe a regular and temperate diet. The stools are a tolerable criterion of the quantity and quality of the food we have taken, and whether the digestive powers be adequate to its concoction. For, in weak intestines, the unassimilated matter of food turns acrid, and contributes nothing to the nourishment of the body. Thus it happens, that debilitated indi∣viduals, and such as are of a phlegmatic hab∣it, continue lean and emaciated, whatever quantity of food they consume. For this rea∣son, they ought to live principally on milk, eggs, broths, tender meat, emollient vegetables; and to eat only when they feel a true appetite, and after moderate exercise.—It is not the man who takes comparatively little food, that can be called temperate; but rather that per∣son who makes use of no more aliment, than he is able to digest. Thin and copious stools, therefore, are a certain proof of indigestion.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="039111_0480_1013A2D2C41739D8"/>
Some persons are accustomed to go to stool more than once a-day, others only every second day, and yet enjoy a good state of health. It is, however, more desirable and wholesome to have a regular evacuation every day; and children especially ought to have two or three discharges daily. Aged persons, in general, have but one stool in a day. The air we breathe, makes, in this respect, a re∣markable difference. The more we perspire in summer, the fewer are the evacuations; and, on the contrary, moderate exercise is pro∣ductive of more regular excretions, than that which is too violent. Robust and muscular individuals perspire more than the weak and enervated; hence the evacuations of the for∣mer, by other emunctories, are more limited; while the latter, whose fluids are not duly de∣termined to the surface of the body, have more frequent openings by stool.</P>
<P>Obstructions and costiveness, of which ma∣ny persons now complain, are owing to a vari∣ety of causes, but chiefly to our luxurious mode of living, and to the custom of making too many meals through the day. The time requisite to the digestion of a meal cannot be well ascertained, as some stomachs concoct quickly, and others slowly; and there is a re∣markable difference in the degrees of digesti∣bility, among the various species of food; the nature and properties of which have been already pointed out in the fifth Chapter. But this may serve as a general rule, that we ought never to take a new supply of food, till the preceding meal be digested.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="039111_0481_1013A292F8B384A8"/>
Some moderate livers, after having deviated from their usual temperance, do not feel any inconvenience till after two or three days, when they are troubled with copious evacua∣tions, head-ach, uneasiness and dejection of mind. Such excesses are frequently accom∣panied with serious consequences, of which costiveness is only the forerunner. Neither the emetics, or laxatives, to which the glutton has recourse, nor the fashionable stimulants and strengthening bitters, can prevent or rem∣edy the ultimate effects of such brutal habits. The emetics and purgatives inevitably weaken the first passages, and lay the foundation of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nstant obstipations; while the stimulants deprive the intestines still more of the neces∣sary humours, and render the evil much great∣er. The most proper means of preventing these hurtful consequences, are the following:</P>
<P N="1">1. A due degree of bodily exercise, by which the muscular power will be invigorated, the nervous system strengthened, and the cir∣culation of the blood promoted.</P>
<P N="2">2. We ought to take a proportionate quan∣tity of drink to our victuals; a circumstance not always sufficiently attended to, by persons of a sedentary life. Drink dilutes the food, and softens the bowels. A weak, well-fer∣mented, and well hopped beer, is an excellent beverage: so is water with the addition of a little wine. Warm diluents, on the contrary, have a manifest tendency to increase obstruc∣tions, by the relaxation they produce in the intestines.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="159" REF="039111_0482_1013A2D55850B758"/>
3. Let us choose the quality of our food, according to our constitutional wants. Those who cannot digest well, ought to avoid all thick, mealy dishes, pastry, onions, warm and new bread, and such as is not thoroughly bak∣ed. Costive persons frequently complain of an acid generated in their stomach; while others, on account of this acid, are subject to loose and very frequent stools. Vinegar and tart wines are but rarely the cause of this acidity; never, indeed, except when they disagree with the stomach. New wines on the contrary, as well as vegetables of an acescent kind, and particularly long kept and roasted fat meat, have the strongest ten∣dency to produce acidity, the heart-burn, and, at length, obstructions in some constitutions, and diarrhoeas in others. The proper species of food, in such cases, are herbs, carrots, su∣gar-peas, french-beans, parsley-roots, the scor∣cenera, artichokes, horse-radish, mustard-leaves, and similar plants, boiled soft in broth, sufficiently salted, and without the addition of sat, or butter. Besides these, only a small quantity of meat ought to be used, and this should be tender; but no fat fish, nor game kept too long, for the purpose of rendering it mellow; and lastly, all kinds of fruit ought to be eaten boiled rather than raw.</P>
<P N="4">4. We should not too much indulge in sleep, which, particularly after dinner, is hurtful to persons whose digestion is languid, and whose evacuations are preternaturally slow. During sleep, all the motions in the system are per∣formed with less vigour, and more tardily:
<PB N="160" REF="039111_0483_1013A319C2C14AB0"/>
and, in this respect, to keep awake may be considered as a spe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es of exercise; as the nerves, in that state, are more active, and the circulation of the blood is carried on with greater energy.—Evacuations by stool can be suppressed, by sleeping an improper length of time, for instance, ten or twelve hours instead of seven or eight; and we may prevent these salutary discharges, by sitting down to any inactive employment, previous to the usual in∣clination to retire to stool.</P>
<P>If it be our wish to preserve health, we ought not only to guard against costiveness, but likewise to prevent, by all proper means, to frequent excretions. Copious evacuations of this kind exsiccate the body, and deprive it of that strength, which is necessary to sup∣port its exertions. Persons subject to diar∣rhoea, cannot be too cautious in the use of watery, saline, and easily fermentable articles of food and drink, and in avoiding violent fits of anger and other passions. On the contrary, they will promote their health, by using pro∣visions of a drying nature, drinking a well-fermented, bitter beer or ale, or, if they can afford it, good old wine:—all of which have the beneficial tendency to promote perspira∣tion, and thus prevent superfluous humidity in the body.</P>
<P>If too copious evacuations proceed from a relaxed state of the intestines, daily exercise is of considerable efficacy; for the fibres of the whole body are thereby invigorated; and, if irritating or peccant humours should be the cause of the complaint, nothing is better cal∣culated
<PB N="161" REF="039111_0484_1013A2D92BC8D108"/>
to expel them by perspiration, urine, or stool, than spirited and persevering muscu∣lar motion, until the body be tolerably fa∣tigued. But, in this case, we must not at∣tempt to remove or suppress this material stimulus by astringent remedies; for, instead of evacuating the noxious matter by the proper emunctories, such medicines will necessarily produce dangerous, and often fatal diseases.</P>
<P>It would be a desirable object, in houses which are not provided with water-closets, that every individual were furnished with his own night-chair; as most of the common places of retirement are literally ventilators, where some parts of the body are exposed to a cur∣rent of air, which is frequently the cause of disorders, particularly in persons subject to colds, and all other complaints originating from suppressed perspiration; accidents, which may injure still more those, whose lungs are unsound. Men who are troubled with the piles, and, above all, women during the menses, ought to be very cautious in resorting to such places.—In the usual privies, there generally prevails in summer a pestilential fetor; so that it becomes almost impossible to wait for the proper evacuation, both because of the disagreeable smell, and the danger of being infected with disease.</P>
<P>After every stool, there is a slight bearing down of the anus; a circumstance which ren∣ders some precaution in the cleaning of it ne∣cessary. The substance used for that purpose ought to be previously examined, whether its surface contain any rough and loose particles,
<PB N="162" REF="039111_0485_1013A31C5E353720"/>
which would be immediately communicated to the anus, and might gradually produce the blind hemorrhoids.—Lastly, all unnatural for∣cing and straining of costive persons, is not only useless, but may also be attended with dangerous consequences. It is, therefore, more advisable to use all proper means of keeping, if possible, this important excretion in due regularity; and, to attain that desira∣ble end, it is further necessary to abandon all strait garments, especially laced stays, and tight waistbands.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Urine.</HEAD>
<P>IN a state of health, this discharge takes place oftener than once in a day. The urine of those who live moderately, and take proper exercise, if examined in the morning after rising, and after having spent a quiet and com∣fortable night, is thin, clear, of a straw colour or inclining to yellow, with a white, loose, and uniform sediment rising in the middle; it makes no foam, but what immediately van∣ishes, and has no unusually disagreeable smell. If it correspond to this description, it is a symp∣tom of good digestion, and of the body being free from impurities. The quantity of this evacuation, in healthy persons, depends on their constitution, the season and the weather. It is less in warm than in cold climates, on account of the increased perspiration. In win∣ter,
<PB N="163" REF="039111_0486_1013A2DAB2132338"/>
we generally eject more urine than in sum∣mer; and this nearly in proportion to the de∣gree of insensible exudation. In spring and autumn, it is probably voided in an equal proportion.</P>
<P>We may judge (not prognosticate) respect∣ing the state of the body, from the appearance of the urine in the morning only; for, during the day, this would be a fallacious criterion, from the nature and quantity of food and drink we consume. The ancients were ex∣tremely fond of predicting the different states of health and disease in the human body, from the appearances observed in the urine. Among the moderns, who are better acquainted with the animal economy, these appearances are not implicitly attended to, as they have fre∣quently been found to mislead the observer; yet, the early morning urine, if allowed to stand for an hour or two, exhibits some phe∣nomena, which render it an object worthy the attention of the medical practitioner. Thus, a thin, pale urine, which is voided by the hy∣pochondriac, the hysteric, and persons afflict∣ed with spasms in the abdomen, indicates great weakness, or the approach of cramps, originating from a contraction of the smaller secretory organs. It is likewise of a whitish colour, after taking much weak drink. In debilitated individuals, the urine is foamy, and this froth remains on the top for a consi∣derable time; because it abounds in tough and viscid particles. The health of such persons, however promising in appearance, is by no means permanently established.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="039111_0487_1013A31DE48AD008"/>
The urine is of a red colour, after too little drink, or after drinking spirituous liquors, af∣ter violent exercise, profuse perspiration, and after having spent a restless night. It yields a sediment resembling brick-dust, when the stomach is impure, and the tongue white with a yellowish taint, and covered with viscous matter. According to the higher or paler colour of the urine, in an ordinary state of health, the body may be considered as being more or less vigorous. If, after long standing, no sediment be deposited in it, great weakness is indicated: yet the conclusion is more favour∣able, although the urine be thick and sandy, if a cloud be observed swimming in the middle.</P>
<P>Indeed it is less dangerous to suppress the evacuations by stool, than those by urine; for, if this remain too long in the bladder, it be∣comes acrid and corrosive. If the inclination to make water is accompanied with a discharge of a few drops only, it is called a <HI>strangury;</HI> if the difficulty of voiding it is attended with pain, a <HI>dysuria;</HI> and, if a total suppression of it takes place, it is then called an <HI>ischuria.</HI> These diseases are frequently the effects of some malt-liquors, or of certain articles of food, particularly vegetables containing much acidity. In the beginning of such painful complaints, relief can be given by fomenting the patient, about the genitals, with flannel∣cloths, as hot as he can bear them, by keep∣ing him sufficiently warm, and allowing him plenty of warm, diluent drink.</P>
<P>Although the quantity of the urine to be voided through the day cannot be accurately
<PB N="163" REF="039111_0488_1013A2DD521BAA78"/>
ascertained, yet this evacuation ought always to be proportionate to the drink we have taken, and to the greater or less degree of perspiration. If we perceive a deficiency in this discharge, we ought to take moderate ex∣ercise, to drink light, thin, and acidulated diluents, and to eat a variety of such herbs and fruits, as possess diuretic virtues: of this nature are, parsley, asparagus, celery, juni∣perberries, strawberries, cherries, and the like. We should be careful, not to retain the urine too long; a practice which would occasion relaxation and palsy of the bladder, and which might at length produce the gravel or stone.</P>
<P>Many maladies may arise from voiding too small a quantity of urine; hence the necessity of attending to this excretion, from which we may frequently discover the cause of the dis∣ease. The relative state of vigour or debility in the individual, the mode of life, more or less drink, dry or damp weather—all produce a difference in the quantity of this evacuation. Robust persons eject less urine than the debili∣tated: a copious emission of it is always a symptom of a relaxed body, which is not pos∣sessed of sufficient energy to expel its noxious particles by transpiration through the cuta∣neous vessels.</P>
<P>The more exercise we take, the less we lose by the urinary passage; since they are drain∣ed by the pores. Cold and moist air checks perspiration, but promotes the excretion by urine. When this canal is suppressed, the bladder sometimes becomes so much distended that it bursts, as may easily happen to parturi∣ent
<PB N="166" REF="039111_0489_1013A322CAEA2C98"/>
women; and hence arise incurable <HI>fistulae;</HI> or, if the passages be obstructed, the urine re∣treats into the cellular texture of the whole body, and penetrates even into the cranium. Women, however, are able to retain it longer than men.—Too copious an evacuation of urine constitutes a peculiar disease, known by the name of <HI>diabetes,</HI> which not unfrequent∣ly proves fatal to the sufferer, after he has dis∣charged several gallons a day, for a consider∣able length of time.</P>
<P>Among the rules and cautions for the prop∣er management of this evacuation, it deserves to be remarked, that it is hurtful to make wa∣ter too often, or before a proper quantity of it be accumulated in the bladder. By such practice, this vessel gradually contracts into a narrower compass than is assigned by nature, and cannot again be easily distended. Too long a retention of urine, on the contrary, preternaturally enlarges the bladder, weakens its muscular power, and may, with the ad∣vancement of age, occasion <HI>ischuria</HI> or a total suppression; besides which it promotes the deposition of mucus and sand in the bladder, and inevitably leads to that troublesome and painful complaint, the stone.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of insensible Perspiration.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the natural evacuations, none is so important and extensive, none is carried on with less interruption, and none frees the
<PB N="167" REF="039111_0490_1013A2DED955EA88"/>
body from so many impurities, particularly from acrid and thin humours, as insensible perspiration. The health of man chiefly de∣pends on the proper state of this function: the irregularities occurring in it, occasionally produce peevishness of temper, head-ach, dis∣turbed sleep, heaviness in the limbs, &amp;c.; and, on the contrary, we find ourselves most lively and vigorous, when it is duly and uniformly performed.</P>
<P>A person of a middle stature, and in perfect health, perspires, according to the calculation of some, from three to four pounds weight, according to others, about five pounds, within twenty-four hours. The exudation by the pores is most essential during the night; the noxious particles only being then separated; which, on account of the disturbances we are exposed to through the day, cannot be so well effected, as the circulation of the blood is thereby interrupted, while at night it is com∣paratively more calm and regular;—besides which, the nocturnal perspiration is more co∣pious, from the greater uniformity of the sur∣rounding atmosphere.</P>
<P>Most of the febrile diseases arise from a sup∣pressed perspiration; as the exuded matter is of an acrid and irritating nature. To transpire beneficially, means, that the impure and per∣nicious particles only be ejected, in which case the perspiration is invisible and imperceptible. This is so essential a requisite, that without it the health of the individual cannot long subsist. The reciprocal connection between the func∣tions of the stomach, and of perspiration, is
<PB N="168" REF="039111_0491_1013A3244F81C1D0"/>
so obvious, that if the latter be checked, the former is immediately affected; and the re∣verse takes place, if the stomach be disordered.</P>
<P>The more vigorously a person perspires, (it ought to be well remarked, that the question here is not of <HI>sweating</HI>) the more active are the powers of the body, in the regular con∣coction of the alimentary juices; and the more certain it is, that no fluids will superabound: for the fluids though refined and subtile, far exceed in weight the more compact and solid parts of the system, so that they would oppress the machine like a heavy burden, if not evac∣uated by the pores of the skin. Most individ∣uals; however, are accustomed to direct their attention only to evacuations of a more gross nature, or such as are more obvious to the senses. But <HI>insensible</HI> perspiration is of greater moment than all the other excretions; and by paying due regard to that function, if it should be accidentally disturbed, we may frequently discover the lurking cause of a distemper, and remove it, before it has materially injured the body.</P>
<P>Yet, even in the most healthy, this perspira∣tion is not at all times, nor at all hours of the day, equally active. It is weaker after a plen∣tiful meal, but as soon is the food is digested, we again perspire with increased energy; for the new chyle being changed into blood, im∣parts additional efficacy to the vital powers, as well as to the circulation of the blood itself. As we perspire considerably more in summer than in winter, our mode of life, with respect to sleep, as well as to food and drink, ought to be regulated
<PB N="169" REF="039111_0492_1013A2E3D435B0D8"/>
accordingly. We know from accurate obser∣vation, that if we retire to bed immediately after supper, the process of perspiration is checked in a remarkable degree: we also know, that it is highly conducive to health, that this important function of the body be preserved in the most uniform state; hence it necessarily follows, that, after supper, we ought to sit up at least two hours; and to afford this benefit both to the organs of digestion and perspiration, our suppers should not be delay∣ed to the late hours now so absurdly in fashion.</P>
<P>According to the experiments made by dif∣ferent inquirers into the nature of insensible perspiration, this process is most forcibly af∣fected, and sometimes totally suppressed, by the following circumstances:</P>
<P N="1">1. By violent pain, which in a remarkable degree consumes the fluids of the body, or propels them to other parts.</P>
<P N="2">2. By obstructions of the cutaneous vessels, which are frequently occasioned by the use of salves, ointments, and cosmetics.</P>
<P N="3">3. By severe colds, particularly those con∣tracted at night, and during sleep.</P>
<P N="4">4. When nature is employed with other ob∣jects. Thus perspiration is weaker during the time of concoction, particularly after using food difficult of digestion. This is likewise the case, when nature endeavours to promote any other species of evacuation, which more engages the attention of the senses; for in∣stance, vomiting, diarrhoeas, considerable hemorrhages, and the like: farther, when the efforts of Nature are too weak; hence the
<PB N="170" REF="039111_0493_1013A326DC4405E0"/>
aged, the debilitated, and poor persons, una∣ble to supply the wants of the body, or to pay due attention to cleanliness, perspire less than others: lastly, the same must happen to indi∣viduals of a sedentary life, who neglect the necessary exercise of the body; and those like∣wise who wear too tight garments, and im∣proper ligatures about the joints.</P>
<P>Perspiration, on the contrary, is promoted:</P>
<P N="1">1. By stretching or expanding the limbs; as, by such means, the lungs and muscles acquire an additional impulse, and the fluids circula∣ting too slowly in the smaller vessels, are pro∣pelled to the larger veins and arteries, and thus forwarded to the heart; so that this prin∣cipal muscle is then impelled to extend and contract its ventricles with greater force, and consequently to quicken the whole circulation of the blood.</P>
<P N="2">2. By the lukewarm bath, which is well calculated to soften the skin, and thus to open the pores for a better perspiration.</P>
<P N="3">3. By moderate bodily exercise.</P>
<P N="4">4. By mild sudorific remedies;—and for this reason it is extremely proper, in case of a recent cold, to drink two or three cups of tea, especially previous to going to bed.</P>
<P>If perspirable matter collect in drops, it <HI>should</HI> then be called <HI>Sweat,</HI> and is no longer a natural and necessary evacuation; on the contrary, we find very healthful and robust persons who seldom or never sweat. By means of this exudation, both noxious and useful particles are at the same time ejected from the surface; the body is enfeebled; the blood is
<PB N="171" REF="039111_0494_1013A2E67325DB58"/>
rendered impure; and the secretion of bad humours is prevented by every violent effort of the cutaneous vessels.</P>
<P>If sweating be carried to excess, it is ex∣tremely noxious, and may even be productive of consumption. By insensible perspiration, on the contrary, the superfluous particles only are expelled; because the circulation of the fluids is slower, and more calm and uniform. This important purification of the blood ought never to be checked: if, therefore, we wish to take a bracing exercise, it should by no means be continued till profuse perspiration take place.</P>
<P>Cold then only checks perspiration, when it occasions an unusual stimulus on the skin, and if we too suddenly remove from a warm to a cold atmosphere. Hence the necessity of ac∣customing ourselves, from early youth, to the vicissitudes of heat and cold, of walking ev∣ery day in the open air, and of washing the whole body, at least once a week, with luke∣warm, or still better, with cold water. By this practice the pores are braced, and inured to undergo the different changes of the weather and seasons, without suffering (as most people now do, upon the slightest occasion) by severe cold and catarrhs.</P>
<P>It is never too late to begin this strengthen∣ing process, by frequently washing and rub∣bing the whole surface of the body with cold water; for, if cautiously managed at first, it cannot fail to invigorate young persons and adults, as well as the aged.—To sleep on feath∣er-beds occasions a constant vapour-bath at
<PB N="172" REF="039111_0495_1013A3296EA85DD0"/>
night, which again destroys the beneficial ac∣quisitions of the day.—To remove from a cold temperature to a still colder one, is not nearly so prejudicial, as to exchange suddenly the air of a warm room, for that of a moist and cold atmosphere. This accounts for the frequent colds caught in summer, even by going from the burning rays of the sun to the cooling shade; and hence too the first cold of autumn is most sensibly felt, because we are then un∣accustomed to that impression.</P>
<P>Much also, as has been before observed, de∣pends on the nature and properties of our food and drink, in respect to the state of insensible perspiration. The subtile and rarefied fluids only, not those of a coarse and oily consistence, can pervade the skin. Too many oleaginous, viscous, and crude articles of nourishment, such as fat meat, pastry, boiled mealy dishes, smoked hams, sausages, &amp;c. have a strong ten∣dency to obstruct the free perspiration of the body, and consequently to affect the serenity of the mind.</P>
<P>All the depressing passions and emotions are a powerful check to insensible perspiration; while, on the contrary, those of an exhilarating nature may promote and increase it to such a degree, as sometimes to prove the pre-dispos∣ing, though distant cause of consumptions. Moderate daily exercise is eminently calculat∣ed to support this function, and to strengthen the whole body. Cleanliness produces a sim∣ilar effect; for some impurities continually set∣tle on the surface of the body; and these, if not removed in time, clog the pores, and are

so detrimental to health, that they may occa∣sion many obstinate distempers, which might be easily prevented, or at least checked in their progress, by a proper and constant attention to the skin.</P>
<P>Too violent a perspiration indicates great debility of the body, or a laxity of the cutane∣ous vessels, which may frequently be removed by cold bathing or washing. When persons are troubled with unusual night-sweats, they may receive benefit (if it be not a symptom of hectic fever) by taking, immediately before go∣ing to bed, two or three drachms of cream of tartar, in either beer or water. But if this simple remedy, after repeated trials, should prove ineffectual, a professional man ought to be consulted; as long-continued night-sweats may in the end produce great weakness, and even consumption.</P>
<P>In most of the common colds, the popular stimulant remedies, such as heating liquors, and particularly sudorifics, are ill calculated to relieve the complaint. If the patient, at the same time, be troubled with pain in the bowels, head-ach, a foul tongue, &amp;c. a gentle laxative will be of greater service than the diaphoretics. But if the stomach be peculiarly affected, if the tongue be clean and the appetite good; two or three cups of warm diluent drink, a tepid bath of the legs, a moderately warm room and dress, gentle exercise, and friction of the skin with warm cloths, are the most proper and generally effectual means of relief.</P>
<P>As the retention of useless and superfluous matter is hurtful, it is not less detrimental to

health, if substances not ready to be evacuated are ejected from the body.—Of this kind are bleedings from the nose, the mouth, and the vessels of the anus: though these are not nat∣ural evacuations, yet they may occasionally be beneficial, as Nature sometimes makes an ef∣fort to expel noxious matter in an unusual manner. But these parts or fluids ejected as pernicious, strictly speaking, ought not to exist in the body; and though the evacuation of them be beneficial, it is a symptom of disease. If, therefore, such preternatural discharges take place too violently or frequently, they ought to be checked with judgment and circumspec∣tion; and we should endeavour to lead (but not to force) Nature to a more salutary canal, than that she has chosen, either by accident or wanton compulsion.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Saliva.</HEAD>
<P>THE saliva should not be confounded with mucus, or slime; the former is a fluid, not in∣tended by Nature to be evacuated, as it serves the important purpose of mixing and prepar∣ing the food for the stomach; hence it ought not to be unnecessarily wasted by frequent spit∣ting; the latter, mucus, may be safely thrown out as burdensome and offensive. The absurd custom of smoking tobacco is extremely prej∣udicial, as it weakens the organs of digestion, deprives the body of many useful fluids, and
<PB N="175" REF="039111_0498_1013A2EA8FE07BD0"/>
has a direct tendency to emaciation, particular∣ly in young persons, and those of lean and dry fibres. To these it is the more detrimental, that it promotes not only the spitting of saliva, but likewise other evacuations. This plant is pos∣sessed of narcotic properties, by which it pro∣duces in those who first begin to smoke it, gid∣diness, cold sweats, vomiting, purging, and, from its stimulus on the salival glands, a copi∣ous flow of the saliva.</P>
<P>Frequent and much smoking makes the teeth yellow and black; the clay-pipes are apt to canker the teeth to such a degree as to in∣fect the breath, and produce putrid ulcers in the gums. Delicate persons especially suffer from this nauseous habit; as it has a direct tendency, not only to exsiccate their bodies, by contaminating the fluids, rendering them acrid, and vitiating the digestion and assimilation of food, but likewise to impair the mental facul∣ties. These effects, however, are less to be ap∣prehended from smoking tobacco, if it has be∣come habitual, and is not carried to excess. To persons of a middle age, or those of full growth, particularly the corpulent, the phleg∣matic, and such as are subject to catarrhal com∣plaints, it may occasionally be of service, if used with moderation, especially in damp, cold, and hazy weather. Yet such persons ought never to smoak immediately before or after a meal, as the saliva is materially requisite to assist the concoction of food, which is not accomplished till about three or four hours after a meal;—they should smoke slowly; frequently drink small draughts of beer, ale, tea, or any other
<PB N="176" REF="039111_0499_1013A3302B264B90"/>
diluent liquors, but neither spirits nor wine; and, lastly, they should use a clean pipe with a long tube; for the oil of tobacco, settling on the sides of the pipe, is one of the most acri∣monious and hurtful substances, and may thus be accidentally absorbed, and mixed with the fluids of the body.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Mucus of the Nose.</HEAD>
<P>THE secretion of this humour is intended by Nature to protect the olfactory nerves: hence every artificial mean of increasing that secre∣tion is preposterous, unless required by some particular indisposition of the body. The re∣marks, then, made with respect to the saliva and smoking, are also applicable to the mucus of the nose, and the habit of taking snuff. The question here is not of that catarrhal se∣cretion of viscid slime, which is ejected as use∣less. Snuff stimulates the mucous membrane of the nose, and, sympathetically, the whole body; by which the mental powers are in a degree affected. If used as a medicine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By the persuasion of some friends, who were anxious to see the farcical performance of an empiric, whose name does not de∣serve to be recorded here, I this day (September 25th, 1798) join∣ed a party, to witness the pretended effects of a certain <HI>snuff-powder,</HI> together with what he calls his <HI>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> which are at best but a clumsy imitation of <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>r's Animal Magnetism; (vid.</HI> page 113 Vol. 1.) and, as such, have not even the merit of originality.

and on occasions that require such a stimulus, it may be productive of some advantage; but a liquid sternutatory deserves every preference to a powder, which, though at first stimulating and occasioning a flow of viscous matter, in the end always obstructs the nostrils. And if this stimulus be too violent; it may bring on so profuse a discharge of matter from the deli∣cate membrane lining the nose, as to relax and corrode it, and to produce a <HI>polypus,</HI> or a con∣cretion of clotted blood in the nostrils.</P>
<P>In several diseases of the head, eyes, and ears, however, the taking of snuff may occa∣sionally supply the place of an artificial issue; though an extravagant use of it will most cer∣tainly produce a contrary effect; namely, ac∣cumulation of matter in the head, bleeding of the nose, and other complaints. Farther, it would be extremely injudicious to advise the use of snuff to persons of a phthisical constitu∣tion, or those afflicted with internal ulcers, and subject to spitting of blood; as, by the violent sneezing it at first occasions, such individuals might expose themselves to imminent danger.—Public speakers of every kind, as well as teachers of languages, and, in short, all those
<PB N="178" REF="039111_0501_1013A331B15B5870"/>
to whom a clear and distinct articulation is of consequence, ought to avoid this habit, which, when carried to excess, is, in this respect, ex∣tremely prejudicial. Those, too, who have a regard for cleanliness will not accustom them∣selves to this hurtful practice. In short, the continual use of snuff gradually vitiates the or∣gans of smell; weakens the faculty of sight, by withdrawing the humours from the eyes; impairs the sense of hearing; renders breath∣ing difficult; depraves the palate; and, if taken too copiously, falls into the stomach, and in a high degree, injures the organs of digestion.</P>
<P>Besides the many bad effects already men∣tioned, taking snuff may be attended with an∣other consequence, equally dangerous to the alimentary canal. While the nose is continu∣ally obstructed, and a free respiration is imped∣ed, the habitual snuff-taker generally breathes through the mouth only; he is always obliged to keep his mouth partly open, and conse∣quently to inspire more frequently and with greater efforts. Thus, by inhaling too much air, he probably lays the foundation of that troublesome flatulency, which is common a∣mong those hypochondriacs who habitually take snuff. Hence every person, unless good reasons can be assigned in favour of it, ought to be seriously dissuaded from the use of snuff, as well as of tobacco: and it deserves to be remarked, that both these practices may be safely, and cannot be too suddenly relinquish∣ed, as soon as reason prevails over sensual grat∣ifications.</P>

<HEAD>Of Wax in the Ears.</HEAD>
<P>IF the ears be seldom, or not properly clean∣ed, there sometimes accumulates a species of wax, which grows tough and hard, diminishes the acuteness of hearing, obstructs the passage to the ear, and may at length produce total deafness. Copious ear-wax, if it become thin and acrid, may occasion pain, and sometimes a running or suppuration in the ears. Daily washing with cold water strengthens these or∣gans, and is an excellent preservative of the sense of hearing.—If it be apprehended, that insects have made their way into the cavity of the ear, it may be useful to introduce some sweet oil into the orifice, and to repose on that side, the ear of which is the seat of the com∣plaint.</P>

<P>THESE are fluxes of blood, salutary to both sexes, when required and regulated by Na∣ture; but, if suppressed, they may be productive of serious and fatal consequences. The <HI>menses</HI> are irregular in their appearance and disap∣pearance; being much influenced by climate, and the constitution of the body: the <HI>hemorr∣hoids,</HI> on the contrary, originate from the mode of living, joined to a particular temper∣ament of the individual. <HI>Bleeding of the nose</HI> arises either from a superabundance of blood,
<PB N="180" REF="039111_0503_1013A33458569B28"/>
and its impetuous circulation, or from the bursting of one of the small arteries.—As long as these fluxes continue within proper limits, and do not exhaust the strength of the person subject to them, there is not the least necessity to employ any artificial means of suppressing them; because Nature must not be rudely checked in her beneficent efforts. Nay, even the affections and passions of the mind ought to be duly regulated, particularly by females of an irritable temper, during the recurrence of the menses; for these may, according to circumstances, be either preternaturally in∣creased, or totally suppressed, to the great in∣jury of health.</P>
<P>Lastly, it is extremely imprudent for young women to expose their feet and legs to danger∣ous colds, in washing the floors of rooms and passages upon their knees, at a time when they ought particularly to guard against the access of damp and cold.

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the SEXUAL INTERCOURSE; its physical consequences with respect to the Constitution of the Individual;—under what circumstances it may be either conducive or hurtful to Health.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>A <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ECT of such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ensive importance, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to our physical and moral welfare, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> consequences resulting from either a too <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or extravagant intercourse between the sexes, deserves the strictest inquiry, and the most serious attention of the philosopher.</P>
<P>The inclination to this intercourse, and the evacuation connected with it, are no less in∣herent in nature, than other bodily functions. Yet, as the semen is the most subtile and spir∣ituous part of the human frame, and as it serves to the support of the nerves, this evacuation is by no means absolutely necessary; and it is besides attended with circumstances not com∣mon to any other. The emission of semen en∣feebles the body more than the loss of twenty times the same quantity of blood, more than violent cathartics, emetics, &amp;c.: hence ex∣cesses of this nature produce a debilitating ef∣fect on the whole nervous system, on both body and mind.</P>
<P>It is founded on the observations of the ablest physiologists, that the greatest part of this re∣fined fluid is re-absorbed, and mixed with the blood, of which it constitutes the most rarefied
<PB N="183" REF="039111_0506_1013A2F4E8A94188"/>
and volatile part; and that it imparts to the body peculiar sprightliness, vivacity, and vi∣gour. These beneficial effects cannot be ex∣pected, if the semen be wantonly and improv∣idently wasted. Besides, the emission of it is accompanied with a peculiar species of ten∣sion and convulsion of the whole frame, which is always succeeded by relaxation. For the same reason, even libidinous thoughts, with∣out any loss of semen, are debilitating, though in a less degree, by occasioning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> of the blood to the genitals.</P>
<P>If this evacuation, however, be pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ted only in a state of superfluity, and within <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> bounds, it is not detrimental to health. Nature, indeed, spontaneously effects it, in the most healthy individuals, during sleep; and, as long as we observe no difference in bod∣ily and mental energy after such losses, there is no danger to be apprehended from them. It is well established, and attested by the ex∣perience of eminent physicians, that in certain indispositions, both of men and women, this is the only permanent remedy that can be ad∣vised, to restore their languishing health. It is not uncommon to find, that melancholy, in∣curable by any other means, has been happily removed, in persons of both sexes, by ex∣changing a single state for that of wedlock.</P>
<P>There are a variety of circumstances, by which either the utility or the insalubrity of the sexual intercourse is, in general, to be de∣termined.—It is conducive to the well-being of the individual, if Nature (not an extrava∣gant
<PB N="184" REF="039111_0507_1013A33A94882E08"/>
or disordered imagination) induces us to satisfy this inclination, especially under the following conditions:</P>
<P N="1">1. In young persons, that is, adults, or those of a middle age; as, from the flexibility of their vessels, the strength of their muscles, and the abundance of their vital spirits, they can the better sustain the loss occasioned by this indulgence.</P>
<P N="2">2. In robust persons, who lose no more than is almost immediately replaced.</P>
<P N="3">3. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>prightly individuals, and such as are particularly addicted to pleasure; for, the stronger the natural desire, the safer is its grat∣ification.</P>
<P N="4">4. In persons who are accustomed to it;—for Nature pursues a different path, according∣ly as she is habituated to the re∣absorption, or to the evacuation of this fluid.</P>
<P N="5">5. With a beloved object; as the power an∣imating the nerves and muscular fibres is in proportion to the pleasure received.</P>
<P N="6">6. After a sound sleep; because then the body is more energetic; is provided with a new stock of vital spirits; and the fluids are duly prepared:—hence the early morning ap∣pears to be designed by Nature for the exer∣cise of this function; as the body is then most vigorous; and, being unemployed in any other pursuit, its natural propensity to this is the greater: besides, at this time, a few hours sleep can be readily obtained, by which the ex∣pended powers are, in a great measure, reno∣vated.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="185" REF="039111_0508_1013A2F89E103678"/>
7. With an empty stomach; for the office of digestion, so material to the restoration of bodily strength, is then uninterrupted. Lastly,</P>
<P N="8">8. In the vernal months; as Nature, at this season in particular, incites all the lower animals to sexual intercourse; as we are then most vigorous and sprightly; and as the spring is not only the safest, but likewise the best time, with respect to the consequences result∣ing from that intercourse. It is well ascertain∣ed by experience, that children begotten in spring are of more solid fibres, and consequent∣ly more vigorous and robust, than those gen∣erated in the heat of summer, or cold of winter.</P>
<P>It may be collected from the following cir∣cumstances, whether or not the gratification of the sexual impulse has been conducive to the well-being of the body; namely, if it be not succeeded by a peculiar lassitude; if the body do not feel heavy, and the mind averse to re∣flection: all which are favourable symptoms, indicating that the various powers have sustain∣ed no essential loss, and that superfluous mat∣ter only has been evacuated.</P>
<P>Farther, the healthy appearance of the urine, in this case, as well as cheerfulness and viva∣city of mind, also prove a proper coction of the fluids, and sufficiently evince an unimpaired state of the animal functions, a due perspira∣tion, and a free circulation of the blood.</P>
<P>There are, however, many cases in which this gratification is the more detrimental to health, when it has been immoderate, and with∣out the impulse of Nature, but particularly in the following situations:</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="186" REF="039111_0509_1013A33C1A4CE518"/>
1. In all debilitated persons; as they do not possess sufficient vital spirits; and their vigour, after this enervating emission, is consequently much exhausted. Their digestion necessarily suffers, perspiration is checked, and the body becomes languid and heavy.</P>
<P N="2">2. In the aged, whose vital heat is diminish∣ed, whose frame is enfeebled by the most mod∣erate enjoyment, and whose strength, already reduced, suffers a still greater diminution, from every loss, that is accompanied with a violent convulsion of the whole body.</P>
<P N="3">3. In persons not arrived at the age of ma∣turity:—by an early intercourse with the other sex, they become enervated and emaciated, and inevitably shorten their lives.</P>
<P N="4">4. In dry, choleric, and thin persons: these, even at a mature age, should seldom indulge in this passion, as their bodies are already in want of moisture and pliability, both of which are much diminished by the sexual intercourse, while the bile is violently agitated, to the great injury of the whole animal frame.—Lean per∣sons generally are of a hot temperament; and the more heat there is in the body, the great∣er will be the subsequent dryness. Hence, likewise, to persons in a state of intoxication, this intercourse is extremely pernicious; be∣cause in such a state the increased circulation of the blood towards the head, may be attend∣ed with dangerous consequences, such as burst∣ing of blood-vessels, apoplexy, &amp;c.;—the plethoric are particularly exposed to these dangers.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="187" REF="039111_0510_1013A2FA22F2BB48"/>
5. Immediately after meals; as the powers requisite to the digestion of food are thus di∣verted, consequently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he aliment remains too long unassimilated, and becomes burdensome to the stomach.</P>
<P N="6">6. After violent exercise; in which case it is still more hurtful than in the preceding, where muscular strength was not consumed, but only required to the aid of another function. After bodily fatigue, on the contrary, the nec∣essary energy is in a manner exhausted, so that every additional exertion of the body must be peculiarly injurious.</P>
<P N="7">7. In the heat of summer, it is less to be in∣dulged in than in spring and autumn; because the process of concoction and assimilation is effected less vigorously in summer than in the other seasons, and consequently the losses sus∣tained are not so easily recovered. For a sim∣ilar reason, the sexual commerce is more de∣bilitating, and the capacity for it sooner ex∣tinguished, in hot than in temperate climates. The same remark is applicable to every warm temperature combined with moisture, which is extremely apt to debilitate the solid parts. Hence hatters, dyers, bakers, brewers, and all those exposed to steam, generally have relaxed fibres.</P>
<P N="8">8. In a posture of body, which requires great muscular exertion, it is comparatively more enfeebling; as, in this case, various powers are exhausted at once.</P>
<P>It is an unfavourable symptom, if the rest after this intercourse be uneasy; which plain∣ly indicates, that more has been lost, than
<PB N="188" REF="039111_0511_1013A33EC17D5518"/>
could be repaired by sleep: but if, at the same time, it be productive of relaxation, so as to affect the insensible perspiration, it is a still stronger proof that it has been detrimental to the constitution.—There are, as has been be∣fore observed, two principal causes, from which the indulgence in this passion has a de∣bilitating effect on the constitution, particu∣larly in men:—1. by the convulsive motion of the whole frame, combined with the im∣passioned ecstacy of the mind; and, 2. by the loss of this essential fluid, more than by any other circumstance. But, if it be not emitted, the subsequent relaxation is inconsiderable, and not much increased even on the following day, if the semen should be ejected, upon a repetition of the intercourse.—It certainly is ill-founded, that swellings of the scrotum may arise from a stagnation of the seminal fluid: such swellings, if they really take place, are not attended with any danger; as experience informs us, that they are either again absorbed, to the benefit of the body, or if the accumu∣lation of the semen become too copious, it is spontaneously evacuated by Nature.</P>
<P>The relaxation of those who keep within the bounds of moderation, in this respect, does not continue long; one hour's sleep is generally sufficient to restore their energy. Such temperance is highly beneficial to the whole body, while it serves to animate all its powers, and to promote insensible perspira∣tion, as well as the circulation of the blood. The semen can be emitted without injuring the body, is Nature alone demand it, that is,
<PB N="189" REF="039111_0512_1013A2FCAE449EA8"/>
when the reservoirs are full, and a material stimulus occasions it, without the active con∣currence of imagination.</P>
<P>As it is principally this fluid which affords vivacity, muscular strength, and energy to the animal machine, the frequent loss of it cannot but weaken the nerves, the stomach, the in∣testines, the eyes, the heart, the brain—in short, the whole body, together with the men∣tal faculties; it in a manner destroys the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣dour for every thing great and beautiful, and surrenders the voluptuary, in the prime of his life, to all the terrors and infirmities of a pre∣mature old age, from which even the conju∣gal state cannot save him. The most certain consequence of excess in venery is hypochon∣driasis, frequently accompanied with incurable melancholy: the unhappy victim endeavours to exhilarate himself by a repetition of these convulsive exertions of his vital spirits, and thus precipitates himself into still greater mis∣ery.—Many of the diseases of the eyes origin∣ate from such intemperance; and these votaries of pleasure are not unfrequently attacked with <HI>tabes dorsalis,</HI> or consumption of the back, which generally proves fatal.</P>
<P>Here likewise, every individual ought to pay proper regard to his constitution. Some are provided by Nature with an uncommon portion of bodily vigour, while others are but sparingly supplied: the former, therefore, overcome slight transgressions of this kind, without much danger, while the latter cannot commit excesses with impunity. The natural instinct ought always to be consulted, in what∣ever
<PB N="190" REF="039111_0513_1013A34061E379E0"/>
relates to this function; but it should not, as is frequently the case, be confounded with the artificial stimulus. Hypochondriacs, indeed, as well as those who make use of ma∣ny nourishing species of food and drink, are sometimes stimulated merely by a certain ac∣rimony in the abdominal vessels; such a stimulus, however, is totally unconnected with the impulse of Nature.</P>
<P>Frequent and copious emissions, during sleep, are productive of equally bad effects; they bring on the frailties of age at an early period of life, and soon prepare the exhausted sufferer for the grave. But infinitely more dangerous is the secret vice of Onanism, which debilitates the body more than any other spe∣cies of debauchery. By this execrable practice, a greater quantity of semen is evacuated, than by the natural commerce between the sexes; the vital spirits cannot operate so uniformly, as to counterbalance the convulsive effects which agitate the whole animal frame; and the circumstances, which render this hateful vice so destructive to both sexes, particularly at a tender age, are, that the opportunities of committing it are more frequent than those of the sexual intercourse, and that it but too of∣ten becomes habitual.</P>
<P>The imagination which, by the natural u∣nion of the sexes, is in a certain degree gratifi∣ed, becomes with every repetition of Onanism more disordered, and is continually filled with libidinous images: and although the frequent loss of semen, is, for a considerable time, sup∣plied, by a fluid of an inferior quality, yet,
<PB N="191" REF="039111_0514_1013A2FE50575598"/>
even by this imperfect supply, the body is drained of the spirituous and most valuable parts of its fluids.</P>
<P>All kinds of evacuation, when immoderate, are prejudicial to health; but that of the se∣men is particularly so; for it is an established fact, that every stimulus increases the secretion of humours, and that Nature is necessarily forced to make irregular efforts, to restore the losses sustained, in the most speedy, though in its consequences, the most ruinous manner.</P>
<P>As most female animals refuse to receive the males, while they are in a state of preg∣nancy, the connection with pregnant women appears to be physically improper. Although the dangerous consequences thence arising, both to the mother and child, may have been exaggerated, yet the embrace of women far advanced in pregnancy is certainly not con∣formable to the laws of Nature, and ought not to be considered as a matter of indiffer∣ence. Such females as wantonly submit to it may readily miscarry; for the fetus is thus much compressed, and an additional flow of humours is thereby occasioned. If, however, in married life, this intercourse, notwithstand∣ing its impropriety, should be indulged in, it ought to be practised with precaution, and not too frequently; as such excesses may not only enfeeble the mother, but likewise be attended with effects very hurtful to the child. Nay, it is asserted by some authors, that the frequent cases of <HI>hydrocephalus,</HI> or dropsy in the head, are to be ascribed chiefly to this practice

among <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>—a conclusion which, though hypothetical, is not unreasonable.</P>
<P>A connection with females suckling chil∣dren, is not less improper; as the milk is thereby vitiated, and the health of the infant affected.—Nor is it justifiable to gratify this passion during the menses; which may be ei∣ther thus suddenly suppressed, or, by the in∣creased access of the fluids, may terminate in an hemorrhage of the womb: besides which, the sexual intercourse during this period, as well as for some days immediately preceding, cannot answer the purpose of generation; because the ovum of the female, being but slightly attached, is again separated by the periodical discharge. Hence the congress of the sexes is most generally crowned with fer∣tility, after the catemenia have ceased; for then the female is in the most proper state for fecundation, because that the ovum has suf∣ficient time to be consolidated, before the next menstrual evacuation.</P>
<P>Not with a view to satisfy idle curiosity, but for the information of the judicious read∣er, I shall give some particulars, relative to the nature of the seminal fluid. The semen in men, as it is emitted, consists of various compound humours. Besides the real sem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n prepared in the scrotum, and deposited in the proper vesicles, it is mixed with the peculiar moisture contained in the latter, with the li∣quor secreted by the prostrate gland, and probably also with some mucus or phlegm from the urethra. It is of a greyish colour, inclining to white, is glutinous and tough;
<PB N="193" REF="039111_0516_1013A301F8C5A548"/>
has a very volatile, penetrating smell, and is of considerable specific gravity. In water, the thicker part, which in all probability is the pure semen, sinks to the bottom; another part appears in fine threads, and forms a thin pellicle on the surface of the water. In per∣sons not arrived at the age of maturity, and likewise in enervated adults, it is of a thin and serous consistence.</P>
<P>In the fresh semen of those who are capable of procreating, we find a great number of an∣imalculae, which can be perceived only by means of the most powerful microscopes: these do not appear to be mere vesicles filled with air; as they are formed irregularly, one extremity being somewhat spherical, the other smaller and rather pointed; their supposed use will be mentioned towards the conclusion of this chapter, when treating on the different theories of generation.</P>
<P>As part of the small artery, through which the blood is propelled into both testicles, runs immediately under the skin, and consequently the blood is conducted from a warmer to a much colder place; as the seminal tubes in the testicles are very delicate and long, and take throughout a serpentine course—the ca∣nal traversing the upper testicle (<HI>epididymis</HI>) being alone thirty feet long and upwards; as, lastly, the narrow seminal tubes pass over into the wider canal of the epididymis, and this again into the still wider seminal passage: it is obvious, that the secretion and evacuation of the semen not only takes place very slowly, but also in very small quantities.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="039111_0517_10136E3C2582F378"/>
Nature seems to employ a considerable time in preparing and perfecting a fluid, which is indispensably necessary to the propagation of the species. The quantity, therefore, which is emitted in every intercourse between the sexes, and which is computed to be equal to half an ounce weight,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This assertion, as well as that immediately following, rest up∣on the authority of Prof. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>na; and I here refer to his excellent work: "<HI>Elements of Medical Anthropology, &amp;c.</HI>" (in German,) p. 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. second edition. 8vo. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> 1793.</NOTE> can be but gradually replaced. Hence it happens, that even men of strong constitutions cannot indulge in ve∣nery more than once in three or four days, for any considerable time, without impairing their health, and diminishing their strength. These remarks, however, apply chiefly, and almost exclusively, to the male sex; for, with regard to women, it is an erroneous notion, that they secrete any semen;—what has for∣merly been considered as such, consists merely of a pituitous liquor, proceeding from the womb and the vagina.</P>
<P>To return from this short digression, I shall farther observe, that, where it may be other∣wise proper, it is an excellent and healthful rule, (however ludicrous it may appear to the sensualist) to gratify the inclination for the sexual commerce only at regular stated peri∣ods, so that nature may become habituated to it, without making unusual and hurtful ef∣forts. This might be attended with the ad∣ditional advantage, that persons, in a conjugal state, would not be so apt to commit excesses, which, in the end, are productive of satiety
<PB N="195" REF="039111_0518_1013A305AE5BBCA0"/>
and indifference towards the object of former affection, and which are undoubtedly the fre∣quent cause of a feeble and degenerate off∣spring.</P>
<P>No irregularities whatever are more certain∣ly punished than those of venery; and, though the consequences should not immediately take place, they unavoidably follow, and generally at a time when they are most severely felt; sometimes in the organs of generation alone, and sometimes over the whole body. Even the connection with the most beloved object, the possession of whom has been long and anx∣iously wished for, does not exempt the volup∣tuary from these prejudicial effects, if the bounds of moderation be exceeded: the ima∣gination at length becomes disordered; the head is filled with libidinous images; and the predominating idea of sensual enjoyment ex∣cludes the reflections of reason. Thus Nature becomes in a manner forced to conduct the fluids to the parts of generation, so that such unfortunate persons cannot relinquish this de∣structive habit; they are troubled with invol∣untary emissions of the semen, which are ex∣tremely debilitating, and which either deprive them entirely of the faculty of procreating, or destroy the elasticity of the parts, and exhaust the semen to such a degree, as to produce only feeble and enervated children.</P>
<P>In those who lead a life of debauchery, spasmodic affections, and even ruptures, are not uncommon: women are afflicted with the <HI>fluor albus,</HI> violent fluxes of the menses, bear∣ing down of the vagina, and innumerable oth∣er
<PB N="196" REF="039111_0519_1013A349D92B38D8"/>
maladies of a disagreeable nature. These destructive effects on the body are at first man∣ifested by a general relaxation of the solids: the whole nervous system is reduced to a state of extreme debility, which is seldom, if ever, removed by the most rigorous adherence to diet, and the most apposite medical remedies. Hence necessarily arise, as has been already observed, the almost infinite varieties of hy∣pochondriasis, and imbecility, to so alarming a degree, that persons of this description cannot direct their attention to one object, for a quar∣ter of an hour together: their spirits are ex∣hausted; their memory as well as their judg∣ment are greatly impaired; and in short, all the faculties of mind, all its serenity and tranquillity, are so much affected, that they scarcely enjoy one happy moment.</P>
<P>The external senses do not suffer less upon these occasions: the eyes, especially, become weaker, imaginary figures are continually floating before them, and frequently the power of vision is entirely destroyed.—The stomach also, on account of its intimate connection with the nerves, in a great measure partakes of these infirmities: whence arise diseases of various degrees of malignity;—the lungs too become disordered; hence the many lingering and incurable consumptions, which destroy such numbers in the prime of life. If, how∣ever, they survive the baneful effects of their intemperance, their bodies become bent from absolute weakness, their gait sluggish and tot∣tering, and the residue of their days is marked with painful debility.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="039111_0520_1013A30732A34990"/>
Young persons, as well as those whose em∣ployments require much muscular exertion, are in an uncommon degree weakened by fre∣quent debauches. Indeed, the sexual inter∣course, even within the limits of moderation, is more hurtful to some individuals than to others. Thus, a person born of strong and healthy parents is not nearly so much hurt by occasional extravagance as another, whose par∣ents were weak and enervated, or who is him∣self threatened with consumption; and, lastly, those also ought to be abstemious in this re∣spect, who feel an unusual lassitude and weak∣ness, after the least indulgence.</P>
<P>There are people who, from ignorance, have long been in the habit of committing ex∣cesses, and who wish at once to reform their mode of life; the consequence of this sudden change generally is an increased debility; and they become very liable to fits of the gout, hysteric and hypochondriacal complaints. As they are sensible of their growing weakness, they expect to relieve themselves by strength∣ening remedies, which render their situation still worse, being apt to occasion involuntary emissions of semen in the night, to relax and destroy the stomach, and at length to produce an irritating acrimony in the intestines, which is the frequent cause of such emissions. Even the mild corroborants cannot be used here with any hopes of success; as the body is overload∣ed with pituitous phlegm, from which readily arise jaundice and dropsy. Hence it is more advisable, and, at least in a physical respect,
<PB N="198" REF="039111_0521_1013A34B60154990"/>
more salutary, to return from such irregulari∣ties by gradual steps, than by a too sudden and dangerous change.</P>
<P>It is further remarkable, that most persons, especially in the higher ranks, do not marry at a proper period of life; partly from caprice and family-considerations; partly on account of the difficulty to maintain a family, in the present more expensive mode of living; and partly from other causes which are best known to bachelors. Thus they enter into the con∣jugal state, when their frame is enervated by dissipation of every kind; but such debauchees ought not to be permitted by the State to en∣cumber the world with a degenerate offspring.</P>
<P>On the contrary, to be married too early, and before a person has attained the age of maturity, is likewise improper and hurtful. Every candidate for matrimony should en∣deavour to obtain the most accurate intelli∣gence, whether the object of his affection be qualified for the various duties of that state, or whether she be subject to phthisical, hyster∣ic, and nervous complaints, all of which ought to be guarded against; as, besides the misfor∣tune of being united to a valetudinary partner, healthy women only will produce sound and vigorous children.</P>
<P>Those who do not marry for the sake of wealth and family-interest, should choose a well formed and agreeable partner, as deform∣ed mothers seldom bring forth handsome chil∣dren. The natural disposition of a woman likewise, deserves to be investigated, previous to the union; for it is the opinion of accurate
<PB N="199" REF="039111_0522_1013A309DAEBCCC8"/>
observers, that children most generally inherit the propensities and passions of the mother. There ought to be no remarkable difference between the age of the married couple; and the most proper time in life for matrimony, in our climate in general, appears to be that be∣tween the age of eighteen and twenty in the female, and from twenty-two to twenty-four in the male sex.</P>
<P>Lastly, women who are hump-backed, or who have had the rickets in their infancy, ought not to enter the state of wedlock; the former, in particular, (according to the rules of sound state-policy) should by no means be allowed to marry; until examined by profes∣sional persons, whether there be any impedi∣ment to child-bearing from the preternatural structure of the <HI>pelvis:</HI>—this frequently ren∣ders the Caesarean operation necessary; or the artificial separation of the pelvis is connected with imminent danger of life. For the same reason, even elderly women should not be en∣couraged to engage in matrimony, as they ei∣ther remain barren, or, if not, they experience very difficult and painful parturition.</P>
<P>In some rare instances, however, too great abstinence may be the cause of serious distem∣pers. A total retention of the semen is not indeed always hurtful; but it may be so, occa∣sionally, to persons naturally lascivious, and to those of a corpulent habit. These are gener∣ally provided with an abundance of the seminal fluid, which, if too long retained in the body, causes involuntary evacuations, plethora, swellings, pain and inflammation of the semi∣nal
<PB N="200" REF="039111_0523_1013A3500F39EF18"/>
vessels, the inspissation and at length cor∣ruption of the stagnating semen—and some∣times priapisms, convulsions, melancholy, and at length furious lewdness.</P>
<P>The female sex are not less liable to diseases from inevitable abstinence: loss of strength, <HI>chlorosis, fluor albus,</HI> hysterics, and even <HI>furor uterinus,</HI> may sometimes be the consequence. Yet, I cannot upon this occasion omit to re∣mark, that these effects seldom, if ever, take place in those who live regularly, and do not encourage libidinous ideas; and that both males and females would undoubtedly derive greater benefit from total continence, till mar∣riage, than by an unlimited indulgence in ven∣ery: in the former case, they would not only in a great measure contribute to their vigour of body and mind, but also to the prolonga∣tion of life.—Young women of an habitually pale colour, may be justly suspected of being troubled with the <HI>fluor albus;</HI>—or of having an ardent desire to change their state.</P>
<P>To repair the injuries brought on by an ex∣cessive indulgence in the sexual commerce, such means ought to be employed, as are calculated to remove the irregularities which have taken place in the functions of digestion and perspir∣ation, and to give new energy to the solid parts. With this intention, the quantity of food is not of so much consequence as its qual∣ity; hence the diet should be nourishing, of easy digestion, and have a tendency to promote insensible perspiration: in all states of debility, a light and spare diet is the most suitable to re∣store strength, without exerting too much the
<PB N="201" REF="039111_0524_1013A30C7390E1C8"/>
digestive organs. Rich nourishment, there∣fore, as well as tough, flatulent, and crude victuals, or those which are liable to ferment in the stomach, would, in such cases, be ex∣tremely pernicious.—But, above all, a rigid degree of abstinence from the intercourse which has occasioned the weakness, cannot be too seriously recommended; as this alone in gen∣erally sufficient to restore muscular vigour, es∣pecially where youth and soundness of consti∣tution are in favour of the individual.</P>
<P>Although we are possessed of no specifics, strictly deserving the appellation of <HI>aphrodisiacs,</HI> yet there certainly are means, which tend to promote the desire, as well as the capacity, of carrying on the sexual intercourse; these are either such as contribute to increase the seminal fluid, or stimulate the genital organs. Of the former kind are those, which afford a rich chyle and salubrious blood, which conduct this fluid more abundantly to the parts of gen∣eration, and are on that account mildly diu∣retic; for instance, milk, eggs, tender and nourishing meat, herbs and roots of a mild, spicy nature, and such as promote the secre∣tion of urine, moderate bodily exercise, partic∣ularly on horse-back, &amp;c. Merely stimula∣ting remedies, however, should not be employ∣ed without great precaution, especially by the infirm, and those beyond a certain age; for the emission of semen, in these, is generally attended with debility and disgust: while in young and robust persons there is no necessity to increase the secretion of that fluid by artifi∣cial means.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="039111_0525_1013A351940B35D8"/>
There are likewise remedies of an opposite tendency, more effectually answering the pur∣pose of moderating, or rather checking a too violent propensity to venery, than those before stated, with a view to promote it. In the pres∣en state of society, and particularly among maritime nations, where a great proportion of men and women are obliged to lead a single life, the means conducive to diminish this pas∣sion, deserves every attention. Of this nature are:</P>
<P N="1">1. A laborious and rigid life, much bodily exercise, little sleep, and a spare diet; so that the fluids may be more easily conducted to other parts, and that they may not be pro∣duced in a greater quantity, than is requisite to the support of the body. For the same reason, it is advisable, as soon as the desire of committing excesses rises to any height, im∣mediately to resort to some serious avocation, to make use of less nutritious food and drink, to avoid all dishes peculiarly stimulating to the palate, and to abstain from the use of wine, and other spirituous liquors.</P>
<P N="2">2. To shun every species of excitement; such as intimacy with the other sex, amorous conversations, libidinous narratives, seductive books, pictures, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3. A cool regimen in every respect:—hence Plato and Aristotle recommended the custom of going barefoot, as a means of check∣ing the stimulus to carnal desire; so that this indecorous practice was considered by the an∣cients as a symbol of chastity. The cold bath was likewise suggested for the same purpose;
<PB N="203" REF="039111_0526_1013A310200B3388"/>
others again, among whom may be reckoned Pliny and Galen, advised to wear thin sheets of lead on the calves of the legs, and near the kidneys.—With the same intention, and prob∣ably with better effect, may be used the cool∣ing species of nourishment, such as lettuce, water-purslane, cucumbers, &amp;c.—for common drink, mere water; and, if the impulse of passion should increase, a small quantity of ni∣tre, vinegar, or vitriolic acid, may occasional∣ly be added to the water, to render it more cooling.—Yet all these and similar remedies are of little or no advantage to the habitual voluptuary, especially if subject to hypochon∣driasis. The exciting cause in such persons not unfrequently proceeds from a diseased abdomen, which, as has been before observed, may be so much obstructed, that all other remedies are in vain, until the material stimu∣lus of such obstructions be removed.—Lastly,</P>
<P N="4">4. The various <HI>extenuants,</HI> such as spices of all kinds, and the smoking of tobacco, vio∣lent exercise, &amp;c. are equally improper; as these would inevitably impair the health of persons naturally lean, sanguine, and choleric; while in cold and phlegmatic temperaments, they would rather tend to increase than to abate the stimulus.</P>
<P>Having now, as far as was consistent with the plan of this work, investigated both the beneficial and detrimental consequences of the sexual intercourse, I propose to conclude this subject with a concise view of the principal <HI>theories of generation,</HI> which have been offered by the ablest physiologists, and which I have
<PB N="204" REF="039111_0527_1013A354247A7870"/>
extracted from the afore-mentioned work of Dr. Loder.</P>
<P>"The origin of the first germ of the em∣bryo, (says the learned Professor) and the manner of its formation, are so obscure, that of all the conjectures made by the most atten∣tive and ingenious observers, none has yet obtained general credit, or arrived at any de∣gree of certainty. The sexual function ap∣pears to belong to those secrets of Nature, to the developement of which the powers of the human understanding are altogether inade∣quate. Yet it is not undeserving the attention of a reflecting mind, to become acquainted with the diversified hypotheses that have pre∣vailed on this subject, and particularly those which have the greatest share of probability in their favour.</P>
<P>"Some of the ancient naturalists have searched for the first germ of the embryo, not within the bodies of the parents, but absolute∣ly in external objects; while they maintained, that it is introduced from without, either by the air, or particular articles of nourishment; and, if it happen to meet with a body qualifi∣ed to effect its formation, it then receives life, and grows; but, in the contrary case, it pass∣es away unchanged. This whimsical con∣jecture is undeservedly transmitted to our times, by the name of <HI>panspermia;</HI>—it is un∣worthy of refutation, as it is unfounded, and totally inconsistent with experience.</P>
<P>"By another hypothesis (<HI>generatio aequivo∣ca</HI>) it was asserted, that a variety of insects, and even of the smaller animals, may originate
<PB N="205" REF="039111_0528_1013A311A3B51148"/>
from extraneous substances, by mere fermen∣tation and putrefaction, without previous generation, or any intercourse of males and females.—Thus maggots were said to arise from putrifying meat, and in wounds; fleas to grow in urine and feces, &amp;c. But by more accurate observations we have learnt, that such vermin are only generated in putrescible bodies, when the eggs of those insects, which feed upon putrid substances, have been previ∣ously deposited in them.—Yet there is a cer∣tain kind of minute animals, which seem to receive life merely from the vivifying powers of Nature, being bred, by infusion, in substan∣ces foreign to their species; and to these per∣haps the preceding theory is so far applicable, as their origin is involved in obscurity.</P>
<P>"Other naturalists have ascribed the first germ of the embryo exclusively to the semen of the male. Hence arose the singular opinion, that the small embryo, with all its parts, is al∣ready deposited visibly in the semen; or that it may be produced from this humour by mere fermentation, or chemical process, without the co-operation of the animal body. Hence also the hypothesis formerly maintained by several eminent writers, that the animalculae of the semen are to be considered as germs of em∣bryos; that, with every intercourse between the sexes, an innumerable quantity of these is introduced into the female parts of generation; that only one or two of such animalculae arrive at the ovaria, from these return to the womb, and progressively grow there; but that all the
<PB N="206" REF="039111_0529_1013A355AD0B2890"/>
others necessarily perish.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ludwig von Hammon,</HI> a young man, born at Dantzig, during the time of his studying medicine at Leyden, and in the course of his microscopical pursuits, discovered, in the month of August, 1677, in a drop of the semen of a cock recently dissected, a kind of ocean, in which swam thousands of little, lively, active animals. The same phenomenon was also observed in the mature semen of other male animals; and in these animalculae were immediately thought to be seen the germs of subsequent perfect animals. By this discovery, a key was supposed to be sound, which would un∣lock the whole mystery of generation.</NOTE>—This bold conjec∣ture is not only incompatible with the wisdom of the Creator, but, besides other strong ar∣guments against it, in a manner refutes itself by this circumstance, that in very different creatures, for instance, in men and in asses, there are found animalculae exactly similar, while in animals of the greatest resemblance in other respects, we meet with animalculae al∣together different. For this reason, they ought to be considered as little creatures inherent in the animal body, and which indeed may form an essential part of a fruitful semen, but the use of which is yet unknown.</P>
<P>"Another sect of natural philosophers, who attributed to both sexes an equal share in the procreating function, maintained, that the germ of the embryo originates in a mixture of the male and female semen, the latter of which proceeds from the ovaria. Among later nat∣uralists, the celebrated BUFFON was the prin∣cipal supporter of this opinion. He endeavour∣ed to establish this hypothetical notion, by conjoining with it the idea of certain <HI>internal forms,</HI> which were requisite to the formation of the parts of the body; in consequence of which he maintained, that the sex of the em∣bryo
<PB N="207" REF="039111_0530_1013A3132996E960"/>
is determined by the circumstance of its consisting of a greater quantity of male or fe∣male semen.—But, as the supposed female se∣men does not proceed from the ovaria, and as the ovaria are not connected with the womb by any tubes, but merely by solid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, it follows that women secern no semen, and what is improperly so called, is only, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I have already observed, a pituitous liquor secreted from the uterus and the vagina. It is farther inconceivable, that the embryo could be en∣dowed with corporeal parts, different from those of father and mother, if it originated merely in the mixture of the seminal fluids of both, and if these should comprehend all the individual parts of the body. Besides, the fanciful internal forms of Buffon cannot be proved by any argument or observation.</P>
<P>"Again, others have ascribed the germ of the embryo to the mother alone, while they granted to the male semen no other power than that of vivification. These philosophers, among whom we find HALLER and BONNET, seriously asserted, that the whole body of the embryo lies already prepared in the ovary of the mother, so that it requires only to be de∣veloped, and that the male semen communi∣cates merely the first impulse to this develope∣ment. They certainly went too far in this as∣sertion; yet it is highly probable, that the crude matter already exists in the ovary, and that it is first animated by the semen of the male, and thus qualified for its gradual for∣mation.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="039111_0531_1013A35AA8AD5C50"/>
"Respecting the manner in which the em∣bryo is formed, there prevail two principal theories, namely, that of <HI>evolution,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>"According to this theory, (says the facetious <HI>Prof.</HI> BLU∣MENBACH, <HI>of G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttingen,</HI>) we, and indeed all the children of Adam, were at one time, <HI>ipso facto,</HI> pent up in the two ovaria of our com∣mon mother, Eve. There we lay, as it were, asleep; and, though astonishingly little creatures, yet completely organized bodies, and perfect miniatures of the forms we have since attained; for, says HALLER, <Q><HI>All our viscera, and the bones themselves were then already formed, although in a kind of fluid state.</HI></Q> That which we call im∣pregnation, is nothing else than the action of awakening the germ from its lethargic state, by means of the male semen, which stimulates the little creature's heart to the first pulsation; and so on.</P>
<P>"The same kind of idea has lately induced a very celebrated naturalist of Geneva, and a warm advocate of this theory, to plan out for us a history of organized bodies previous to the state of impregnation; from which we learn, 1. that we are all much older than we suppose ourselves to be: 2. that all mankind are exactly of the same age, the great-grandfather being not a second older than the youngest of his great-grandchildren; 3. that this res∣pectable age of ours may be about six thousand years. The same natural historian also entirely agrees in opinion with Bazin; that since this charming long series of years, when we were all packed together, along with Cain and Abel, and the other two hundred thousand millions of men, which, according to the best calcula∣tions, have since that period gone—<HI>quo pius AEneas, quo Tullus di∣ves, et Ancus;</HI> in a word, since the first creation, during which time we have been in a kind of lethargic sleep, though not entirely mo∣tionless; that during the whole fifty-seven centuries, I say, pre∣vious to our being awakened by the above-mentioned stimulus, we were, according to Bazin's opinion, always growing by im∣perceptible degrees; for instance, we were most probably rather a little bigger at the time we lay beside Cain's nieces, than when all their uncles and aunts were of the party, as it is very nat∣ural to suppose, that we must then have been considerably more straitened for room. In this manner, our apartment became gradually more easy and commodious, in proportion as our fore∣fathers were evolved; and we kept continually expanding our∣selves more and more, until the succession of evolution at last came to our turn!!"</P>
<P>Such is the ludicrous account of a theory which, though lead∣ing to the most extravagant and romantic conclusions, was sup∣ported by the great Baron HALLER, and the late Italian philoso∣pher, SPALLANZANI. These eminent men have endeavoured to support the doctrine of the pre-existence of complete organized <HI>moleculae</HI> in the ovaria of females before impregnation, by many experiments and observations, which at first sight, appeared to be so far conclusive, that they obtained full and general credit for more than thirty years. Prof. Blumenbach himself not only be∣lieved in the truth of this absurd doctrine, but defended it in many of his earlier writings. At length, however, the success he unexpectedly met with, in an experiment with a species of a green-armed polypus (<HI>conferva fontinalis,</HI>) and its astonishingly rapid powers of reproduction, induced this candid philosopher to acknowledge his former errors and to publish an '<HI>Essay on Generation,</HI>' in which he boldly attacks all former theories; at∣tempts to refute them, partly by argument, partly by his pecu∣liarly humorous mode of exposing the inconsistencies they lead to; and, at the same time, proposes a new hypothesis, the sub∣stance of which I shall insert in a subsequent page, when the the-of <HI>gradual formation</HI> will be considered.</P></NOTE> and that
<PB N="209" REF="039111_0532_1013A31836534D88"/>
of <HI>gradual formation (epigenesis.)</HI> Agreeably to the former, it was conjectured, that all or∣ganic bodies, which have already originated, or which may at any future time originate from one another, have been combined, or inclosed one within another as germs, from the first creation of the world; and that they required only a gradual evolution, to bring them to a state of perfection. The supporters of this theory alleged the instance of the vine∣fretter, which evidently contains in itself several generations, as likewise that of the butterfly, which lies already formed in its case, and va∣rious other plausible examples; but, above all, they endeavoured to explain their hypo∣thesis by the origin of the chicken in the egg;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>To such readers as are desirous to become more fully ac∣quainted with the particulars of this extraordinary conjecture, it may be useful to illustrate it with the following account, extracted from the Essay before quoted, from the pen of Prof. Blumenbach.</P>
<P>"Mr. Paul," says he, "a natural historian of great reputation, has (in his preface to the 8th vol. of the <HI>Collection Academique,</HI> p. 22. &amp; seq.) objected to Haller's demonstration, that, allowing the membranes of the yolk with its invisible vessels to have pre∣existed in the hen, yet it is possible that the embryo is only formed during incubation, and that its blood-vessels afterwards unite with the blood-vessels of the membranes of the yolk, and thus form an <HI>anastomosis.</HI></P>
<P>"Baron von Haller immediately declared loudly against this objection, and denied it, as a thing altogether <HI>impossible,</HI> that the tender vessels of the microscopic embryo should be capable of anastomosing with the large blood-vessels of the giant yolk.</P>
<P>"But what is rather singular is, that this very ingenious and meritorious author, who denies the possibility of such an anasto∣mosis, supposes without any hesitation, and in the same work, when explaining human conception, that the very minute germ, as soon as it has arrived at the cavity of the uterus, forms an adhesion with it, by means of the placenta;—And how?—Just in the same way that he denies it to the embryo of the hen; that is to say, by an anastomosis taking place between the microscopic and ten∣der branches of the umbilical vessels, and the giant ones of the maternal uterus.</P>
<P>"The modern advocates for the theory of evolution have taken this observation of the yolk of the egg, as the prop of their hy∣pothesis.—Long before this, however, the spawn of the frog had been employed for the same purpose.</P>
<P>"Nearly a century indeed before that period, SWAMMERDAM announced the wonderful discovery, that the black points in the spawn of a frog were so many perfectly-formed little frogs, and that they pre-existed in the ovaria, although not discoverable by the naked eye.</P>
<P>"The good man seemed to have had a <HI>presentiment</HI> of the un∣certainty and instability of all vain worldly honours; and he therefore, as is well known, soon after betook himself to a more solid enjoyment, in which Mademoiselle Bourignon participated. And, indeed, it happened as he appears to have foreseen; for the ungrateful world now ascribe the merits of that discovery to the celebrated Abbe SPALLANZANI, who has maintained it in sev∣eral of his writings, but more particularly in the second volume of his "<HI>Dissertazioni di fisica animale e vegetabile.</HI>" Tom. xi. in Mo∣dena, 1780, 8vo.</P>
<P>"He calls the little black points of the fecundated spawn of frogs, tadpoles, or young frogs; and, as this little black point ex∣actly resembles the same in the unfecundated spawn, he reasons agreeably to his logic, that the tadpoles must have existed in the mother.—I do not know what would be thought of a chemist who should assert that the <HI>Arbor Dianoe</HI> pre-existed in a mass of amal∣gam of silver, because, when a weak solution of silver was poured on it, a little tree seemed to spring out of it.—One ought to be ashamed of wasting much tune in the refutation of an assertion, of the falsity of which any unprejudiced person, who is not alto∣gether unaccustomed to observations of the kind, may convince himself, every spring.</P>
<P>"Whoever has taken the trouble accurately to examine the spawn of the frog, must confess, that the idea of demonstrating the little black points it contains to be so many completely form∣ed tadpoles, resembles Brother Peter's method of reasoning in the <HI>Tale of a Tub,</HI> where he demonstrates to his brothers, that a brown loaf is a piece of excellent roast mutton.—But the abettors of the theory of organized germs have gone a step farther in support of their opinions. They refer to cases where even young girls, in all their maiden chastity, have become pregnant, from the untimely and premature evolution of one of these organized germs.</P>
<P>"The concurrence of facts is sometimes most wonderful. It happened, that in the very same year, in which Swammerdam an∣nounced his discovery in the spawn of the frog, a case was pub∣lished in the <HI>Ephem. rerum nat. curios.</HI> delivered to the society by a celebrated court-physician of those times. Dr. CLAUDIUS, which exactly suited, as a confirmation of Swam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>dam's opinion.—A miller's wife was delivered of a little girl, whose belly seemed of an unusual size. Eight days afterwards this big-bellied child was seized with such violent pains and restlessness, that every one who was present thought it could not outlive the next instant. The sick infant, however, in the mean time, actually bore a well-form∣ed, elegant, lively little daughter, about the size of one's middle finger, which was regularly baptized. During the time, and af∣ter the birth, the waters, placenta, and other impurities were duly discharged; but both the little mother and daughter died early on the following day!!!" (Prof. Blumenbach says, in a note sub∣joined to this account, that he has made use of the very words of a contemporary physician, Dr. OTTO, who was consulted by the grandmother (the miller's wife) during her pregnancy. His nephew has vindicated and illustrated the whole history in a most learned and ingenious manner: <HI>'D. C. J. Aug. Ot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onis Epistola de foetu puer∣pera, sive de foetu in foetu.'</HI> Weissenfels, 1740, 8vo.)</P>
<P>"Baron von Haller very judiciously classes this case with an∣other from the Transactions of the Academy of Sciences at Stockholm, where, on dissecting a young girl, bones, teeth, and hairs, were found in a tumour of the mesentery. These two cases he looks upon as principal evidences for the truth of the doctrine of germs pre-existing in the mother.</P></NOTE>
<PB N="210" REF="039111_0533_1013A4444298B7F8"/>
which, however, is a direct demonstration of the contrary. The objections which have been started against this opinion, concerning the
<PB N="211" REF="039111_0534_10136E61F75A9010"/>
minuteness of the germs, and the production of monsters, or bodies of preternatural shape, may be easily removed; but a more weighty objection made against this theory is that which relates to the restoration of parts lost from the body, and which appears to be irrefutable.
<PB N="212" REF="039111_0535_10136E7A4986BC68"/>
Besides these considerations, many arguments may be produced to shew the futility of that doctrine.</P>
<P>"More probable than the former, unques∣tionably is the theory of <HI>gradual formation:</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Another definition of <HI>Epigenesis</HI> deserves to be inserted here, as it is more concise, and as its author, Prof. Blumenbach, has not only embraced this doctrine as the most rational on a subject of so mysterious a nature, but has likewise been at great pains to elucidate the gradual formation of animate bodies by an addition∣al hypothesis—his <HI>nisus formativus (Bildungs-trieb),</HI> or the sponta∣neous effort of Nature in forming homogeneous substances.—"It is supposed," says he, "that the prepared, but at the same time unorganized rudiments of the foetus, first begin to be gradually organized, when it arrives at its place of destination, at a due time, and under the necessary circumstances. This is the doc∣trine of Epigeresis." And with a view to corroborate this sup∣position, the learned Professor makes the following categorical declaration: "<HI>That there is no such thing in nature, as pre-existing or∣ganized germs; but that the unorganized matter of generation, after be∣ing duly prepared, and having arrived at its place of destination, acquires a peculiar action, or nisus, which nisus continues to operate through the whole life of the animal, and that by it the first form of the animal, or plant, is not only determined, but afterwards preserved, and when de∣ranged, is again restored. A nisus, which seems therefore to depend on the powers of life, but which is as distinct from the other qualities of liv∣ing bodies, (sensibility, irritability, and contractility,) as from the common properties of dead matter: that it is the chief principle of generation, growth, nutrition, and reproduction; and that to distinguish it from all others, it may be denominated the</HI> FORMATIVE NISUS."</P>
<P>I shall only add, that this is, at present, the prevailing theory in the German Universities; though, in reality, it leaves us as much in the dark as any other.</P></NOTE> according to which it is supposed, that previ∣ous to generation there exists no real germ, but crude matter only, from which the parts of the organic body are gradually formed. The power by which this formation is accomplish∣ed, is a certain formative effort pervading all nature, (NISUS FORMATIVUS; <HI>vis plastica, vis essentialis</HI>) manifesting its activity according to equal and determinate laws, although in a dif∣ferent
<PB N="213" REF="039111_0536_10136ED1F249F660"/>
manner, in the functions of nutrition and generation, as well as in the restoration of parts accidentally lost. It may be safely asserted, that this is a mere modification of the universal power of vitality; if no obstacle be opposed to this plastic effort, the young organic body then receives its proper form; but, in the contrary case, there arise various unnatural shapes and monsters. By the influence of cli∣mate, aliment, mode of living, and other in∣cidental circumstances, this effort of Nature may, in the course of life, be variously modi∣fied; nay, it is liable to changes in the very first crude matter, or in the plastic lymph, by the different constitution of the male semen.—But the principal arguments in favour of the theory of gradual formation are justly derived from the first origin of plants, from the for∣mation of the chick in the egg, and from the reproduction of such parts of the body as have been lost, either by accident or necessity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the AFFECTIONS and PASSIONS of the MIND;—their relative good and bad effects on Health.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE boundless ocean does not exhibit scenes more diversified, than the various affections and passions of the human mind. They arise partly from the mind itself, and partly from the various constitutions and tem∣peraments of the individual. While no other remedies but rational arguments can influence the mind, the disposition of the body may be changed and improved, by an infinite variety of means.</P>
<P>It is, indeed, principally from bodily causes, that many persons are violently affected from the most insignificant motives, and others are little, if at all, influenced by the most calamit∣ous events. It is, for instance, obviously from a physical cause, that violent medicines, poi∣sons, the bite of mad animals, &amp;c. produce timidity, or fits of anger and rage;—that ac∣cumulations of black bile in the abdomen make people reserved, peevish, melancholy, and stupid. What we wish to think, and in what manner to continue the operations of the mind, frequently does not depend upon our∣selves. The thoughts of the sober are very different from those of the man in a state of
<PB N="215" REF="039111_0538_10136ED7057B5200"/>
intoxication. A certain dish, a particular drink, may suspend the powers of reason.</P>
<P>The temperament of man is, as it were, the source of his mental operations. Affections and passions are different one from another in degree only. The former imply the inclina∣tion or propensity to a passion; the latter, the realized affections, whether simple or com∣pound; or in other words, they constitute an actual and perceptible degree of sensual desire or aversion. According to Lord KAIMES, passions are active and accompanied with de∣sires; affections are inactive and destitute of passion. He also distinguishes between wish∣es and desires: the former he calls the high∣est activity of the affections. Compassion and wishes for the better, are in his idea <HI>affections:</HI> pity, and a desire after what is better, he calls <HI>passions.</HI></P>
<P>Passions operate upon the body either sud∣denly, or slowly and gradually. Sudden death, or imminent danger of life, may be the con∣sequence of the former: a gradual decline and consumption, that of the latter. The passions, as such, may be aptly divided into two principal classes, those of an agreeable and of a disagreeable nature. Men of strong imagination chiefly suffer from passions of the violent kind, while those of more understanding, and less fancy, are subject to slow emotions of the mind. Indolent persons, whose sensations are dull, and less passionate, than those who combine acute feelings, and a lively imagina∣tion, with a clear understanding. The great∣est minds are generally the most impassioned</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="039111_0539_1013A35C2E602D58"/>
All passions, of whatever kind, if they rise to a high and violent degree, are of a danger∣ous tendency; bodily disease, nay death itself, may be their concomitant effects. Fatal apo∣plexies have frequently followed sudden dread or terror. Catalepsy and epileptic fits some∣times accompany immoderate affliction, or dis∣tressing anxiety. Hypochondriasis, hysterics, and habitual dejection, may indeed arise from a variety of physical causes; but they are as frequently generated by the passions or suffer∣ings of the mind alone, in individuals other∣wise healthy.</P>
<P>Diseases of the mind, after some time, pro∣duce various disorders of the body; as diseases of the body occasionally terminate in imbecil∣ity. In either case, the malady must be op∣posed by physical, as well as moral remedies.</P>
<P>It is only by the management of the consti∣tution and education of the individual, that the passions may be rendered useful; for, if un∣controlled and left to themselves, they affect us as a tempest does the ocean, without our being able to counteract their pernicious influ∣ence. Since all affections whatever consist in desire or aversion, they must necessarily be ac∣companied with representations of so lively a nature, as to induce the individual to perform the corresponding voluntary motions. Con∣sequently the affections must also be accompa∣nied by <HI>sensible</HI> motions within the body, not only by voluntary actions, but by those also, which contribute to the support of life, and which are more or less violent, according to the degree of the affection. Joy, for instance,
<PB N="217" REF="039111_0540_1013A35ED8569B28"/>
enlivens all the corporeal powers, and, as it were, pervades the whole animal frame. Hope has nearly a similar effect; and these two affections contribute to the preservation of health and life, more than all the medicines that can be contrived. But of the other affec∣tions of the mind, we can, in most instances, observe scarcely any other effect, than that of irregular motions, which, not unlike medi∣cines, in a limited degree, and under certain circumstances, may be occasionally useful. <HI>Hence the dominion over our passions and affec∣tions is an essential and indispensable requisite to health.</HI> Every individual, indeed, is at his birth provided with a certain basis of inclina∣tions, and with his peculiar moral tempera∣ment: the most tender infant, even before he is capable of speaking, discovers by his fea∣tures and gestures the principal inclinations of his mind. If these be fostered in his suscepti∣ble breast, they will grow up with him, and become so habitual, that the adult cannot, without the greatest exertion, overcome them by the power of reason.</P>
<P>The physical state of the body is most hap∣py, when the mind enjoys a moderate degree of gaiety, such as is generally met with in healthy and virtuous persons. The circula∣tion of the fluids and perspiration are then car∣ried on with proper vigour; obstructions are thereby prevented or removed; and by this lively and uniform motion, not only digestion, but likewise all the other functions of the body, are duly performed.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="039111_0541_1013A3606266BB70"/>
<HI>Joy</HI> is that state of the mind, in which it feels extraordinary pleasure; in which it en∣joys a high degree of contentment and happi∣ness. The activity of the whole machine is enlivened by it; the eyes sparkle; the action of the heart and arteries is increased; the cir∣culation of all the fluids is more vigorous and uniform; it facilitates the cure of diseases in general, and forwards convalescence. The different degrees of this affection are, <HI>Gaiety, Cheerfulness, Mirth, Exultation, Rapture,</HI> and <HI>Ecstacy.</HI>—Habitual joy and serenity, arising from the perfection, rectitude, and due subor∣dination of our faculties, and their lively exer∣cise on objects agreeable to them, constitute mental or rational happiness.</P>
<P>Evacuations which are moderate, a proper state of perspiration, and all food of an aperi∣ent quality and easy digestion, may be consid∣ered as contributing to a joyful state of mind. A pure, dry air, and every thing that invigo∣rates the functions of the body, on the well-be∣ing of which the serenity of mind greatly de∣pends, has a tendency to obviate stagnations. Joy farther is more salutary, when combined with other moderate affections: and the vari∣ous bodily exertions, as well as the employ∣ments of the mind, in reflecting upon different objects, are then successfully performed.—A moderate degree of joy removes the noxious particles of the body, and in this respect is equal, nay superior in salubrity, to bodily ex∣ercise; but excess and too long duration of this passion attenuate and carry away not only the superfluous, but likewise many useful flu∣ids,
<PB N="219" REF="039111_0542_1013A3655E729610"/>
and more than the natural functions can re∣store. Hence, this too violent motion and dis∣sipation of humours is attended with relaxa∣tion and heaviness; and sleep also is prevent∣ed, which alone can re-invigorate the nerves, that have suffered from too great tension. On this account, the celebrated SANCTORIUS dis∣suades persons from gambling, who cannot control their passions; because of the joy which accompanies their success, being follow∣ed by restless nights, and great abstraction of perspirable matter. Sudden and excessive joy may prove extremely hurtful, on account of the great waste of energy, and the lively vibra∣tion of the nerves, which is the more noxious after long rest. Nay, it may become dangerous, by causing expansion or laceration of the ves∣sels, spitting of blood, fevers, deprivation of understanding, swooning, and even sudden death. If we have anticipated any joyful event, the body is gradually prepared to un∣dergo the emotions connected with it.—For this reason, we ought to fortify ourselves with the necessary share of firmness, to meet joyful as well as disastrous tidings.</P>
<P><HI>Laughter</HI> is sometimes the effect or conse∣quence of joy; and it frequently arises from a sudden disappointment of the mind, when directed to an object which, instead of being serious and important, terminates unexpected∣ly in insignificance. Within the bounds of moderation, laughter is a salutary emotion; for, as a deep inspiration of air takes place, which is succeeded by a short and frequently repeated expiration, the lungs are filled with
<PB N="220" REF="039111_0543_1013A366E32DB108"/>
a great quantity of blood, and gradually emp∣tied, so that its circulation through the lungs is thus beneficially promoted. It manifests a similar effect on the organs of digestion. Pains in the stomach, colics, and several complaints that could not be relieved by other means, have been frequently removed by this. In many cases, where it is purposely raised, laugh∣ter is of excellent service, as a remedy which agitates and enlivens the whole frame. Expe∣rience also furnishes us with many remarkable instances, that obstinate ulcers of the lungs and and the liver, which had resisted every effort of medicine, were happily opened and cured by a fit of laughter artificially excited.</P>
<P><HI>Hope</HI> is the anticipation of joy, or the pre∣sentiment of an expected good. It is attended with all the favourable effects of a fortunate event, without possessing any of its physical disadvantages; because the expectation of hap∣piness does not affect us so excessively as its enjoyment. Besides, it is not liable to those interruptions, from which no human pleasure is exempt; it is employed principally with ideal or imaginary objects, and generally keeps within the bounds of moderation; lastly, the sense of happiness contained in hope far ex∣ceeds the satisfaction received from immediate enjoyment, consequently it has a more benefi∣cial influence on health than good fortune re∣alized. Although hope is, in itself, merely ideal, and presents its flattering and embellish∣ed images to the fancy in a borrowed light, yet it is, nevertheless, the only genuine source of human happiness. Hope, therefore, is the
<PB N="221" REF="039111_0544_1013A36985DDD8A8"/>
most favourable state of mind to health, and has frequently preserved the serenity and pro∣longed the existence of those, whose situation appeared to be forlorn.</P>
<P><HI>Love,</HI> viewed in its most favourable light, presents to us a picture of permanent joy, and is attended with all the good effects of that passion. It enlivens the pulsations of the heart and arteries, promotes the operations of the different functions of the body; and it has frequently been observed, that a strong at∣tachment to a beloved object has cured in∣veterate disorders, which had resisted all me∣dicinal powers, and which had been consider∣ed incurable. The changes which this passion can effect on the powers and the whole dis∣position of the mind, are equally remarkable. For the extraordinary exertions, made to ob∣tain possession of the object of our wishes, ex∣cite a sensation and consciousness of strength, which enables man not only to undertake, but also to perform the greatest achievements. In that exalted state, he sets all difficulties at defiance, and surmounts every obstacle.</P>
<P><HI>Sorrow</HI> is the reverse of joy, and operates either suddenly or slowly, according as the cause of it is of greater or less importance and duration. The lowest degree of it is called <HI>Concern;</HI>—when it arises from the disappoint∣ment of hopes and endeavours, it is <HI>Vexation;</HI>—when silent and thoughtful it settles into <HI>Pensiveness</HI> or <HI>Sadness;</HI>—when it is long in∣dulged in, so as to prey upon, and possess the mind, it becomes habitual, and grows into
<PB N="222" REF="039111_0545_1013A36B0A4F2CE8"/>
<HI>Melancholy.</HI>—Sorrow increased and continu∣ed, is called <HI>Grief;</HI>—when tossed by hopes and fears, it is <HI>Distraction;</HI>—when all these are drowned by sorrow, it settles into <HI>Despair.</HI>—The highest degrees of sorrow are called <HI>Agonies.</HI></P>
<P>Sorrow seldom proves suddenly fatal; for, though it injures the nervous energy, it does not hasten the circulation of the blood, with the rapidity of other passions, but rather re∣tards its course. Yet there are examples of its speedy and fatal effects.—Not unlike a slow poison, sorrow corrodes the powers of mind and body; it enfeebles the whole nervous sys∣tem; the heart beats slower; the circulation of the blood and other fluids becomes more inert; they frequently stagnate in their chan∣nels, and generate evils more serious than sad∣ness itself. Farther, the face at first turns pale, then yellow and tumid; the body and mind are worn out; the course of the blood through the lungs must be assisted by frequent sighing; the appetite and digestion become vitiated; and thus arise obstructions, hysteric and hypochondriacal complaints, and, at length, consumption, which is inevitable de∣struction to the body, frequently in the prime of life, and in spite of the healing art. Per∣sons who indulge themselves in peevishness, very soon lose their appetite, together with the power of digestion; their mouth has a bitter taste; flatulency, colic, spasms, faint∣ings, and the long list of stomachic complaints necessarily follow. Men become subject to the blind hemorrhoids; and women to sup∣pression
<PB N="223" REF="039111_0546_1013A36FE1BF2130"/>
or other irregularities of the menses, costiveness, or chronic diarrhoea. The bile, on account of the retarded circulation, either grows hard and produces indurations of the liver, or it is mixed with the blood, and gen∣erates jaundice or dropsy. Such persons in time become very irritable and peevish; and with the frequent return of grief, the mind, at length, is totally employed in contemplat∣ing its wretched situation, so that it finds new food for increasing it in almost every object it beholds. Hence the whole imagination is by degrees obscured, and the most usual con∣sequences of it are, the deepest melancholy—succeeded either by a nervous fever, or insani∣ty—sometimes cancer, and at other times a speedier dissolution, by what is then called <HI>a broken heart.</HI></P>
<P>Solitude and idleness are not only the re∣mote causes of many passions, but also sup∣port and foster them, without exception: they collect and fix the attention of the mind on the favourite objects, and make us reflect the more keenly on the causes of the passions, the less we are interrupted in these fond rev∣eries by other sensations. Though it is cer∣tain, that it is not in our power to avert grief, from which even sages and heroes are not al∣ways exempt, yet we can do much to allevi∣ate it, by denying ourselves the enjoyment which this indulgence in certain situations af∣fords. Moral arguments of consolation, if properly adapted to the capacity and mental disposition of the sufferer, have in these cases generally a powerful influence. Those whose
<PB N="224" REF="039111_0547_1013A37166CAC940"/>
minds are affected by sorrow, ought to avoid as much as possible the company of persons, who are fond of relating their calamities, and recounting their misfortunes. On the contra∣ry, whatever has a tendency to cheer the mind, and to divert it from disagreeable objects, ought to be instantly resorted to. Of this na∣ture are, company, business, cheerful music, and the social affections.—The body should be frequently rubbed with dry cloths, perfumed with amber, vinegar, sugar, and the like; the lukewarm bath may be employed with great advantage; and, if circumstances permit, the patient should remove to a warmer and drier climate.—If temperately used, a weak and mild wine is of excellent service, but an immoder∣ate indulgence in wine may disorder the sto∣mach, by the quantity of acid it produces.</P>
<P><HI>Weeping</HI> generally accompanies sorrow, if it be not too intense: tears are the anodynes of grief, and ought not to be restrained by adults. We feel in weeping an anxiety and contraction of the breast, which impedes respiration; prob∣ably, because then a superfluous quantity of air is contained in the lungs, which is forcibly expelled by sobbing. By this obstruction in breathing, the blood, which ought to be re∣conducted from the head, accumulates in the lungs, and consequently in the veins: hence arise redness, heat of the face, and a flow of tears, which are regulated in quantity by the degree of sadness that produced them. Their principal good effects are, their preventing the danger to be apprehended from grief, by di∣minishing the spasmodic motions in the breast
<PB N="225" REF="039111_0548_1013A37427302678"/>
and head, and by restoring regularity in res∣piration, as well as in the circulation of the blood: hence persons find themselves much relieved after a plentiful flow of tears, which however are extremely prejudicial to the eyes.</P>
<P>Grief arising from an ungratified desire of returning home and seeing our relations, is productive of a disease very common among the Swiss, and which sometimes, after a short state of melancholy, trembling of the limbs, and other symptoms apparently not very dan∣gerous, hurries the unhappy sufferer to the grave, but more frequently throws him into a consumption, and generates the most singular whims and fancies. Persuasions, punishments, medicines, are here of no service; but a sud∣denly revived hope, or gratification of the pa∣tient's wishes, have a powerful effect; provi∣ded that an incurable consumption, or insani∣ty, have not already taken place.</P>
<P>There is also a singular hysteric or nervous fever, which affects many unfortunate sufferers in mental disorders, and which was first ac∣curately described by RICHARD MANNING∣HAM. Debilitated persons, and those of great sensibility, of both sexes, after melancholy af∣fections and other exhaustions of strength, are particularly subject to this disorder. It begins with irregular paroxysms, and manifests itself by an undefinable indisposition, a dry tongue without thirst, anxiety without a visible cause, want of appetite, a low, quick, and unequal pulse, a pale and copious urine, occasional sen∣sations of cold and shivering, sometimes clam∣my sweats, sometimes colic, sleeplessness, and
<PB N="226" REF="039111_0549_1013A376BB4C38B8"/>
insanity. According to the experience of Manningham, this fever generally terminates, in the course of thirty or forty days, by faint∣ings, silent reveries, and death; unless it be removed in the beginning, by bracing and strengthening remedies.</P>
<P>Among the mournful passions we may also include an <HI>extravagant degree of love,</HI> or such as transgresses the bounds of reason. It is then no longer a pleasure, but a disquietude of mind, attended with the most irregular emo∣tions; it disorders the understanding; grad∣ually consumes all the vital powers, by a slow fever; prevents nutrition, and reduces the body to a skeleton. All the passions, indeed, may in their more violent degrees occasion a depravation of the understanding; but sorrow and love are peculiarly calculated to produce so fatal an effect. This mental disorder, to which both sexes, but especially women, are subject, should be opposed in time, by physical as well as moral remedies.—Much may be done here by education, and a proper choice of society. The imagination should be with∣drawn from such images, as may encourage inordinate and excessive love; and it cannot be denied, that young females particularly are frequently precipitated into this weakness, merely by reading improper novels. This imbecility of mind becomes the more danger∣ous in young people, as it is generally increas∣ed by solitude, and their ignorance of the re∣al world.—Exalted ideas of virtue, of magna∣nimity, and a generous self-denial, are excel∣lent antidotes; but, if the body sink under
<PB N="227" REF="039111_0550_1013A37A8E36CB40"/>
the weight of passion, even these exertions are insufficient to support the energy of the mind. The physical remedies to be resorted to in these situations are, rigid temperance, a fru∣gal and less nourishing diet, constant employ∣ment, and much exercise; but the most suc∣cessful of all, is a happy marriage.</P>
<P>Of all the passions that can aid the medical art, there is none from which we may expect greater benefit, than from a rational gratifica∣tion of love. On the contrary, a too ardent passion is attended with the most dangerous physical consequences: it is nearly related to disappointed love, and usually shews itself by a reserved melancholy, a general distrust, and a gloomy misanthropy, which, however, ex∣ternally appears only under the character of lassitude and depression. It is apt to be fol∣lowed by a suppression of the menses, con∣sumption of the lungs, and even insanity.</P>
<P><HI>Disappointed love</HI> is extremely detrimental to health, and gradually destructive to the bo∣dy; it sometimes produces <HI>furor uterinus</HI> in females of an irascible temper and romantic turn of mind, unless the passion itself be radi∣cally cured.</P>
<P>The most dangerous effect of love is <HI>jeal∣ousy;</HI>—this pitiable passion, like disappointed love and pride, is very liable to terminate in madness.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the houses appropriated to the unhappy victims of insani∣ty, we generally meet with three different classes. The first con∣sists of men deprived of their understanding, by pride; the sec∣ond of girls, by love; and the third of women, by jealousy.</NOTE>—In sanguine temperaments, the excess of this affection is productive of conse∣quences

most prejudicial to the body; their fluids are impelled to a more rapid circula∣tion, and secrete, with preternatural velocity, that valuable fluid which stimulates them to venery. Such persons are much addicted to ease, pleasure, and every species of gratifica∣tion, which suits their irritable nerves: their skin and muscles being soft, and accessible to every stimulus, and their fluids thin and rare∣fied, it may be easily conceived, that their hu∣mours circulate with rapidity to the parts of generation, and that their nerves are thus con∣stantly excited to desire. The dreadful con∣sequences are but too frequently visible in young persons, whether single or married, who have too early indulged in such exces∣ses. Hence originate <HI>tabes dorsalis,</HI> wasting of the limbs, spitting of blood, pulmonary consumption, hectic fever, and the whole train of undefinable nervous diseases, so called for want of more proper names; besides a host of other disorders, mostly incurable.</P>
<P>In order to prevent, or at least to oppose, the torrent of these and similar passions, man must not only be seriously apprised and con∣vinced of his danger, and the dreadful misery attendant on intemperance and excess, but he must also submit to a strictly temperate mode of life, if he aspire to rise to the dignity of his nature, and above the rank of the lower ani∣mals. He is a rational being, though his sen∣sitive faculties every where remind him of his animal nature. Hence the following rules cannot be too rigidly adhered to: a constant and useful employment; salutary exercise of
<PB N="229" REF="039111_0552_1013A37EB21BF8F0"/>
the body, till it be moderately fatigued; temperance in eating and drinking; absti∣nence from strong and heating food and liq∣uors; avoiding the habits of effeminacy, soli∣tude, and too much rest; and lastly, a strict attention, from early youth, to the most rigid modesty and purity of manners.</P>
<P><HI>Envy</HI> arises from self-love or self-interest, particularly in such individuals as have ne∣glected to cultivate their own talents, or to whom Nature has denied certain qualifica∣tions of body or mind, which they cannot avoid seeing in others: it is principally ex∣cited, when they are witnesses of the prosper∣ity of persons who possess such superior en∣dowments. People of a narrow mind, and those of a confined education, are most sub∣ject to this mean passion. Envy deprives those addicted to it of an appetite for food, of sleep, of every enjoyment, and disposes them to febrile complaints; but in general it is hurt∣ful to those only who brood over and indulge in this corrosive passion. For the world con∣tains vast numbers, who show their envy at almost every event productive of good fortune to others, and who yet often attain a very great age. Joy at the misfortunes, or the discovered foibles of others, self-love, calum∣ny against their neighbours, satire and ridi∣cule, are the never-failing resources of their malignant dispositions. Medicines cannot cure a disease so odious; education and improve∣ment of morals are its only antidotes. Envi∣ous persons commonly give too much impor∣tance to trifles: hence they ought to be in∣structed
<PB N="230" REF="039111_0553_1013A3816A68E348"/>
to employ themselves in more useful pursuits; to judge of things according to their true value, and to accustom themselves to a philosophic calmness; they ought to learn how to overcome, or at least to moder∣ate, their selfishness; to counterbalance their expectations with their deserts, and to equal or surpass others, in their merits rather than in their pretensions.</P>
<P><HI>Fear</HI> or <HI>anxiety,</HI> is the apprehension of evil. Fear weakens the powers of the mind, relaxes and congeals every part of the human body, retards the pulse, hinders respiration, obstructs the menses, sometimes also perspiration; hence it produces tremor and dread; frequently too it excites perspiration, since it disorganizes ev∣ery thing linked to the body by means of the nerves. It is apt to occasion diarrhoea, and, in some individuals, an involuntary discharge of semen. Some persons of a relaxed habit are, by great fear, thrown into a perspiration resembling the agonies of death; and others cannot retain their urine. Timorous persons are more readily infected by epidemical disor∣ders than those possessed of courage; because fear not only weakens the energy of the heart, but at the same time promotes the absorption of the skin, so as to render the timid more lia∣ble to contagion. In short, fear increases the malignity of diseases; changes their natural course; aggravates them by a thousand inci∣dental circumstances, so that they resist all remedies; and suppresses the efforts of Na∣ture so as to terminate in speedy dissolution. The usual consequences of violent and super∣stitious
<PB N="231" REF="039111_0554_1013A3853197C148"/>
fear, produced by a disordered imagi∣nation, are eruptions in the face, swellings, cutaneous inflammations, and painful ulcers. In some instances, too, fear has produced pal∣sy, loss of speech, epilepsy, and even madness<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One instance of this effect I have myself witnessed, in a gen∣tleman, now living in Edinburgh, who was at Lisbon in the awful earthquake of 1755; and who, from the great fright which seized him upon seeing whole streets and churches tumble down before him, has been deprived of his understanding ever since.</NOTE> itself.</P>
<P><HI>Bashfulness</HI> is an inferior degree of fear, which retains the blood in the external ves∣sels of the breast, and the whole countenance. Hence, in females of a delicate constitution, and transparent skin, we observe the blush not only overspread the face but also the bosom. If carried to a greater degree, it is attended with dangerous consequences, particularly in the individuals before-mentioned: it may stop the flux of the menses and prove fatal, if an attack of a fever should accelerate the catastro∣phe.—A very high degree of bashfulness may generate a dangerous fever, even in men; though, from modern education, instances of this latter kind become every day more rare. An extravagant degree of bashfulness closely borders on fear: if it does not proceed from vice or corrupted manners, it may be corrected by social intercourse with persons of a cheer∣ful disposition.</P>
<P><HI>Terror,</HI> or the dread of an evil surprising us, before we are able to prevent it, is of all pas∣sions the most destructive, and the most diffi∣cult to be avoided, because its operation is un∣foreseen and instantaneous. To shun all occa∣sions
<PB N="232" REF="039111_0555_1013A386B700CF80"/>
that may produce it, is perhaps the only remedy. Persons who are feeble and possessed of much sensibility, are most subject to terror, and likewise most affected by it. Its effects are, a sudden and violent contraction of almost every muscle, that serves to perform the vol∣untary motions. It may farther occasion polypous concretions of the heart, inflamma∣tions of the external parts of the body, spasms, and swoons; at the same time, it may stop sal∣utary evacuations, particularly perspiration and hemorrhages; it may repel ulcers and cutane∣ous eruptions, to the great detriment of health, and danger of life. The menses are sometimes instantaneously suppressed: palpitation of the heart, trembling in the limbs, and in a more violent degree, convulsions and epileptic fits, or a general catalepsy, and sudden death itself, are the subsequent effects of terror.</P>
<P>As terror quickly compels the blood to re∣treat from the skin to the internal parts, it for∣cibly checks the circulation of all the fluids. If anger accompany terror, there not unfre∣quently arise violent hemorrhages, vomiting, and apoplexy. Terror has been known sud∣denly to turn the hair grey.—An inattentive and injudicious mode of educating children of∣ten lays the foundation of this infirmity, which is difficult to be eradicated at a more advanced age. Persons under the influence of this pas∣sion, should be treated like those who suffer from any other spasmodic contraction. Tea, a little wine, or spirits and water may be given to them; vinegar, lavender-drops, or spirits, of hartshorn, may be held to the nostrils;
<PB N="233" REF="039111_0556_1013A389517B0578"/>
warm bathing of the feet, and emollient injec∣tions may be of advantage; and, lastly, the different evacuations ought to be promoted;—but, above all, the mind ought to be duly composed.</P>
<P><HI>Anger</HI> arises from a sense or apprehension of suffered injustice, and an impetuous desire of revenge. Its different degrees depend upon the impressions made by the injury, or the ar∣dour of the disposition to vengeance. In the former case, namely, when the sense of injus∣tice is the prevalent feeling, anger affects us like terror, and produces spasmodic contrac∣tions and stagnations in the liver and its vessels, sometimes so considerable as to change the bile into a concrete mass; from this cause alone often arise the gravel and stone of the bladder. The more usual consequences of anger, if join∣ed to affliction, are paleness of the face, palpi∣tation of the heart, faltering of the tongue, trembling of the limbs, and jaundice.</P>
<P>If, on the contrary, the hope of revenge be the predominant feature in anger, violent com∣motions take place in the whole system; the circulation of all the fluids, as well as the pul∣sations of the heart and arteries, are perceptibly increased; the vital spirits flow rapidly but ir∣regularly, through the limbs; the muscles make uncommon efforts, while some appear almost palsied; the face becomes red; the eyes sparkle; and the whole body feels elated and inclined to motion. This species of anger is by far the most common.</P>
<P>Anger and terror are, therefore, particular∣ly injurious, to the tender bodies of infants,
<PB N="234" REF="039111_0557_1013A38D14725C18"/>
who are possessed of extreme sensibility, easily affected, and consequently much exposed to these passions, on account of the proportiona∣bly greater size of their nerves, and their ina∣bility to restrain passion by the influence of reason. They are liable to be so severely af∣fected, that they may die suddenly in convul∣sions, or retain during life an imbecile body and mind, liable to be terrified upon the slight∣est occasion. When children are apt to cry in sleep, when they start up and make motions indicating fear or terror, it must not be always ascribed to actual pain, but frequently to dreams, which fill their young minds with ter∣rible images, especially if they have often been frightened while awake. All parents know how much some children are addicted to anger and malice, and how difficult it is to suppress the ebullition of these passions. Hence we ought to beware of giving the most distant en∣couragement to such destructive emotions. For it is certain, that both men and women of an irascible temper generally die of a consump∣tion of the lungs.</P>
<P>Persons of an irritable disposition are more frequently exposed to anger than others; they are more easily affected by every passion. Hence the tendency to anger is particularly visible in individuals troubled with hysterics and hypochondriasis, as well as in debilitated and disappointed men of letters. Persons of a hot and dry temperament, of strong black hair, and great muscular strength, are likewise much subject to fits of anger.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="039111_0558_1013A38E997643C8"/>
A moderate degree of this passion is fre∣quently of advantage to phlegmatic, gouty, and hypochondriac individuals, as it excites the nerves to action; but, if too violent and raging, it dissipates the more volatile part of the fluids, and is productive of the most hurt∣ful consequences. In the epileptic, scorbutic, choleric, and such as have open wounds, it causes fever, spitting of blood, convulsions, inflammations, throbbing pains in the side, jaundice, apoplexy, &amp;c.</P>
<P>No fluid is more affected by anger than the bile, which by its violent influx into the <HI>duo∣denum</HI> produces a fixed spasmodic pain in the region of the navel, flatulency, vomiting, a bitter taste in the mouth, anxiety and pressure about the pit of the stomach, and, at length, either obstructions or diarrhoea.—Wine or other heating liquors, drank immediately af∣ter a fit of anger, and strong exercise or labour, are attended with consequences still more per∣nicious, as are also emetics, laxatives, and blood-letting.</P>
<P>The propensity to anger is increased by want of sleep, by heating food and drink, bit∣ter substances, much animal food, rich soups, spices, and by all things that have a tendency to inflame the blood. Persons subject to this passion should use diluent, acidulated, and gently aperient drink, and observe in every re∣spect the most rigid temperance. Such per∣sons ought to sleep more than others; and employ the lukewarm bath, gentle cathartics of cream of tartar or tamarinds, fruit, butter∣milk, whey, vegetable aliment, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="039111_0559_1013A3913216C8D0"/>
Among other arguments against anger, young people, especially females, should be informed, that besides the physical dangers attendant on this passion, it deforms the face, and, like all the impetuous emotions of the mind, deprives the passionate of every charm, and induces a strong aversion to such compan∣ions. Those who feel the approach of anger in their mind, should, as much as possible, di∣vert their attention from the objects of provo∣cation; for instance, by reciting a passage they have learnt by heart; or, as Julius Caesar did, by repeating the Roman alphabet.</P>
<P>Inward fretting, in which sadness is com∣bined with anger, is the more destructive, that it does not vent itself in words, or external actions. There may arise from it giddiness, inclination to vomiting, sudden pain in the side, great anxiety, and similar complaints. Somewhat related to this infirmity is, what Dr. WEIKARDT, a German author, calls the "<HI>mal de cour;</HI>" a cruel malady, which com∣prehends anger, avarice, envy, and sadness.—From a sense of neglect and unmerited injury, whether real or imaginary, which torments courtiers, the habitual peevishness of a great proportion of men leads them to avenge their disappointment, by oppressing and ill-treating their dependants. To accustom themselves to consider the physical and moral vicissitudes of life, and the perishable nature of all terrestrial happiness, with becoming firmness, and to enlarge their minds by the acquisition of use∣ful knowledge, are the best remedies for this mental disease.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="039111_0560_1013A392B7381FA8"/>
When sadness or fear have so overpowered the heart and the understanding, that all hopes of averting the apprehended evils are extin∣guished, the mind sinks into <HI>Despair.</HI> We then see no comfort in futurity, and our ideas of approaching misery become so intolerable, that we think ourselves incapable to sustain it, and seek no other remedy but death. There are attacks of despair, and an inclination to suicide, in which people are, upon any unfore∣seen event, suddenly deprived of their under∣standing, and reduced to temporary insanity. This precipitate species of despair more nearly resembles terror. Others are solitary and re∣served; continually brooding over their mis∣fortunes, till at length all their hopes and re∣solution fail. Their despair, consequently, is more nearly allied to melancholy, than any other passion.</P>
<P>A sudden fit of despair is owing to very irri∣table muscular fibres, which are quickly exci∣ted to the most irregular motions, and from which arises confusion in the senses and the imagination. In profoundly thoughtful and melancholy individuals, the solid parts are weakened, the fluids become thick, heavy, and stagnating; and this weakness of the solids gives them a sensation of peculiar debility. They are dispirited and dejected; their stag∣nating, or, at best, slowly circulating fluids, occasion in them a sense of anxiety and timid∣ity; whence gloomy representations are but too easily impressed on their mind. This is very apt to be the case with persons who eat more animal than vegetable food, which pro∣duces
<PB N="238" REF="039111_0561_1013A397D27D7988"/>
very rich and substantial blood. From this source some authors derive the choleric disposition of the British in general; but I have endeavoured to prove, in the fifth Chap∣ter, on Food and Drink, p. 31 and foll. that this observation cannot be maintained on ra∣tional principles, and that it is inconsistent with actual experience. It is also said of the Negroes, that they are more subject to melan∣choly, and even to suicide, because their blood is more compact, florid, and substantial, than that of the Europeans.</P>
<P>The ambitious are likewise frequently seized with this affection, when they meet with any thing to give them offence or obstruct their projects. Prodigals, and those who are stran∣gers to the troubles and difficulties of life, are subject to fits of despair, whenever they are re∣duced to a state of adversity. Too rigid con∣ceptions of virtue have also, though seldom, been the occasion of this infatuated passion. The cautions and rules for preventing despair and suicide are the same which must be employ∣ed to counteract such other passions as depress the suffering mind; but they must be modified according to the temperament of the individ∣ual; and the cure of such evils ought to be directed principally to the body, and partly also to the mind.</P>
<P>Nothing, indeed, is better adapted to pro∣tect us against all the uneasy and turbulent emotions of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e mind, than a temperate and active life: as, on the contrary, intemper∣ance unavoidably occasions irregular commo∣tions in the fluids, and may be the source of
<PB N="239" REF="039111_0562_1013A39958770408"/>
disease and imbecility. Hence PYTHAGORAS advised his pupils to abstain from animal food, which excites wrath, with all the other pas∣sions and desires. Idleness and want of exer∣cise are not less productive of many malignant propensities.</P>
<P>It cannot be doubted, that those who, at an early, docile age, combine solid principles of virtue with a sober and active life, and who are by frequent examples reminded of the tur∣pitude and disadvantages attending violent pas∣sions in others, will of themselves repress these enemies to human life. Yet it is much more difficult to suppress passions that have already made some progress; in which cases censure and rational remonstrances are seldom avail∣ing. To those, however, who have not reach∣ed such a pitch of obstinacy, as to be above taking advice, the following hints may not be unprofitable:</P>
<P N="1">1. To remove, without delay, the object that gave rise to the passion, or at least to de∣prive it of its nourishment, so that it may die of itself; by going to some other place, which presents a different scene.</P>
<P N="2">2. One affection frequently assists in subdu∣ing another of an opposite nature; such as to inspire the timorous with courage; the angry, with fear; the too violent lover, with hatred, and so forth.—This, however, is seldom prac∣ticable.</P>
<P N="3">3. Let us direct our thoughts to other ob∣jects of pursuit, such as public amusements, the chace, travelling, agreeable company, or other
<PB N="240" REF="039111_0563_1013A39C0712C2B0"/>
favourite employments of an useful and assua∣sive nature.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Music.</HI> Nothing is so well calculated to moderate and calm the nerves, to quiet the mind, and to assuage the passions; provided that the hearer possess a musical ear and feel∣ing, and the kind of music be adapted to his particular taste and situation. Hence we can∣not be too much on our guard in the choice of music, as certain kinds of it have a tend∣ency rather to increase than to allay the par∣oxysm of passion.</P>
<P N="5">5. The state of perspiration deserves par∣ticular attention. For it is confirmed by numberless experiments, that passions decrease in the same degree as perspiration is increased, particularly if they be of such a nature as to check insensible perspiration; for instance, melancholy, terror, fear, and the like. In∣deed, all the different evacuations are benefi∣cial in this case. Lastly,</P>
<P N="6">6. Let us make use of no medicines imme∣diately after a fit of passion. The most advis∣able regimen consists in temperance in eating and drinking, especially in abstaining from hard, indigestible food, cold drink, and cold air. We should better consult our health, after any such emotions, by keeping ourselves moderately warm, and drinking tea, or some similar beverage.</P>
<P>After a very violent paroxysm of anger it is sometimes necessary to open a vein, in order to prevent inflammation; or to cause the evacuation of the bile by an emetic; which cases, however, are to be determined only
<PB N="241" REF="039111_0564_1013A39D8CA30028"/>
by professional men.—The saliva should not be swallowed in such a situation; for it is supposed to have a slightly poisonous quality. Persons under the influence of terror sometimes stand in need of a cordial; but the melan∣choly will find in wine and other strong li∣quors rather an uncertain remedy, or which, at best, is only palliative: and, if immoderate∣ly used, they must necessarily promote sadness, as well as every other passion, which these sup∣posed anodynes, in the end, always increase by their alternately stimulating and relaxing effects.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the different ORGANS OF SENSE, and their respective functions.—Of the supposed Seat and Operation of the Soul—Motion—Muscular Action.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BEFORE we proceed to investigate the pe∣culiar functions of the different senses, it will be useful, if not necessary, to premise a short analysis of <HI>sensation,</HI> or in other words, of the seat and operation of the soul.</P>
<P>The ancients imagined the seat of the soul to be in the stomach, because of the acute feel∣ing of this organ, and the multitude of nerves with which it is provided, and by which it is connected with other parts. But it is now universally admitted by physiologists and anat∣omists, that the operations of the mind are carried on principally in the brain; that this is the point of union, in which all the nerves meet, and which is to be considered as the as∣semblage of all sensations, or the <HI>sensorium com∣mune.</HI> The brain is in the most immediate connection with the perceptive faculty; and here all the nerves are as it were concentrated into one point.</P>
<P>Prof. SOEMMERING, of Mayence, has lately endeavoured to prove in a very ingenious pub∣lication, that the ventricles of the brain prop∣erly contain the more immediate cause of the various operations of the soul; that there is
<PB N="243" REF="039111_0566_1013A3A4DD4D1940"/>
a fluid, or at least a subtile vapour, secreted from these parts, in consequence of the activi∣ty of the mind exercised in the ventricles of the brain; and that all the varieties of intellect, in human beings, depend upon the diversity of the structure of these ventricles, and the va∣rious states of vigour and mental energy there exerted.</P>
<P>Without attempting to decide upon a ques∣tion so remote from human investigatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, I may be allowed to observe, that all conjectures respecting the seat of the soul are in reality frivolous and unsatisfactory, until we have as∣certained, in what manner the important func∣tions of the brain, which is intimately connect∣ed and thoroughly blended with the nerves, are affected within the cranium; whether this be done by vibrations, by secretions of hu∣mours or vapours; or by the peculiar manner in which the numerous blood-vessels are dis∣posed in the brain, so as to allow the blood to exert its influence, and to produce all the changes there, by the force and momentum of its own circulation;—all these particulars must be ascertained, before we can form a decisive opinion respecting the situation of the soul.</P>
<P>This much, however, is certain, that one of the principal offices of the nerves consists in communicating to the brain those impressions, which are made on the body by external ob∣jects. As soon as, by means of this commu∣nication, a certain change takes place in the brain, the mind becomes conscious of it. But every perception must be acquired through
<PB N="244" REF="039111_0567_1013A3A6618275F0"/>
the senses; because the impressions, of what∣ever kind, must previously strike the organs of sense, before they can be communicated to the nerves.</P>
<P>Although it be established and admitted, that the nerves are the medium of all the opera∣tions between body and mind; yet no phi∣losopher has hitherto been able to discover the ultimate chain or link by which they are connected, or the exact point in which they meet. Much, however, depends here upon our idea of the mind. It appears, from the contradictory opinions which, from time to time, have prevailed on this interesting subject, that the inquirers have been too much in the habit of evading the materiality of the soul; and yet they assigned it a certain place of resi∣dence in the body, which to this day is imag∣ined to be in either one or other part of the brain. I conceive the soul to be the primary animating power and the maximum of all pow∣ers in the animal body. And why should we hesitate to consider matter (of the <HI>primary</HI> prop∣erties of which we are but little informed) as perfectly simple and yet extremely operative?</P>
<P>The mind, then, is probably not confined to any particular part of the body, neither exclu∣sively to the brain, to the stomach, nor to the blood; but distributed through the whole sys∣tem, always one and the same power, save that it is sometimes more, sometimes less concen∣trated; and, if I may be permitted to say so, it is a pure, elementary, ethereal agent. In the <HI>brain</HI> it displays its principal energies: here are seated consciousness, the capacity of
<PB N="245" REF="039111_0568_1013A3A7F021EE10"/>
thinking and judging, memory, and all the higher faculties of the mind. But again, it must be observed, that different parts of the brain seem to contain different faculties; so that memory, probably, occupies more the ex∣ternal crust, and the power of thinking, the in∣terior substance of the brain.</P>
<P>With respect to memory, it is remarkable, that nervous and epileptic patients are usually deprived of that faculty, before any other of their mental powers are impaired. Perhaps the efficient cause of the disease has not pene∣trated the brain deep enough, so as to affect the seat of the understanding and judgment; till at length, with the progress of the disease, the higher powers of the mind become affected.</P>
<P>Even the lower faculties, the emotions of the mind, and the various passions, appear to be situated in different organs. Thus, the seat of terror and anger seems to be in the stom∣ach, and in the biliary system; the more ami∣able feelings, as philanthropy, compassion, hope, love, &amp;c. seem to be situated in the heart; fear and surprise, in the external sur∣face of the head and back; and sudden pain, in the breast.</P>
<P>The next question arises, how are these pow∣ers put in motion? Has the assemblage of these faculties, or the <HI>sensorium commune,</HI> an original and independent capacity of receiving ideas; of forming new ones from its own materials; of being conscious of these internal sensations, and of comparing them, so as to reproduce others, through itself, and from its own origin? I am inclined to answer these questions in the
<PB N="246" REF="039111_0569_1013A3AD0B7BCDD8"/>
affirmative. For, as soon as the senses are stimulated, the sensation is communicated to the sensorium, where it makes a real, corpore∣al, and sensible impression. All this is accom∣plished by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the nerves, because the nervous energy appears to be more nearly al∣lied to the mind, than any other power. The more frequently, therefore, the same stimulus and impression is repeated, the more firmly the idea of it is imprinted, and the longer we retain the impression. If the stimulus be too violent and permanent, or if an impression of too many objects be at once made on the brain, our nerves experience the same relaxation as the chords of an instrument, after a strong and repeated tension.</P>
<P>Man, when he is without clear conscious∣ness, and in the moment of confusion, feels as if his mental powers were palsied, or had suffer∣ed a temporary suspension. In a severe disease, and previous to death, we perceive the ideas of early life vanish first; we lose the impres∣sions of such ideas on the brain more readily, in proportion to the distance of time when they were made, or accordingly as they have been more or less frequently repeated. If eventually the patient recover, he may with∣out difficulty observe, how progressively the suppressed ideas re-appear in the head, exactly as if they had been stored up there, and re∣mained in a latent state, till the soul attained sufficient energy to use them.—From this in∣dubitable fact, I am disposed to deduce a stronger argument for the immortality of the soul, than from any other physiological source.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="039111_0570_1013A3AE905DCDD8"/>
The organs by which the sensitive powers of the nerves can be excited from without, are called the senses; in contradistinction to the <HI>internal</HI> faculties, such as imagination, mem∣ory, attention, and the various affections of the mind. The latter we exclude from the present inquiry, which is directed to the <HI>exter∣nal</HI> senses alone. The number of these has been hitherto limited to <HI>five,</HI> or, it may be said with more propriety, that they are five modifications of <HI>one</HI> sense.</P>
<P>This universal sense, which in a manner forms the basis of all others, is that of <HI>Touch.</HI> If we abstract from the difference subsisting in the structure of the organs, the other senses are subservient to that of touch, and little more than a variety or modification of it. All the senses agree in this, that they may be improved by exercise, or depraved and blunt∣ed by neglect: Nature has not formed them to the same degree of perfection in every in∣dividual. The loss of one sense is, in general, partly supplied by the greater perfection of another; yet it is equally true, that exercise and attention are the principal sources of this improvement.</P>
<P>In the most perfect state of our senses, we are liable to be misled by them into many errors and mistakes; but the sense of touch or feeling is least liable to deceptions, while that of sight is the most uncertain. The or∣der in which we shall consider the five senses, hitherto admitted as being distinct from one another, is the following: <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> 1. <HI>Touch;</HI> 2. <HI>Sight;</HI> 3. <HI>Hearing;</HI> 4. <HI>Smell;</HI> and 5. <HI>Taste.</HI>
<PB N="248" REF="039111_0571_1013A3B121198A90"/>
—Beside these, there are perhaps several oth∣ers, which deserve to be added to that num∣ber; such as hunger and thirst, and the sen∣sations peculiar to the different sexes. If these be not admitted as distinct from the five oth∣ers, we may still discover a <HI>sixth</HI> sense in the animal oeconomy. And though this addi∣tional sense is chiefly manifested in diseases, and scarcely perceptible in a healthy state of the body, yet its existence is so obvious to pa∣tients in chronic disorders, and particularly in palsy, gout, and rheumatism, that they are thereby enabled to ascertain, with wonderful accuracy, not only the present state, but also to predict the impending changes of the at∣mosphere.</P>
<P>Without losing time in abstruse disquisitions respecting these occult senses, I proceed to examine those which are more generally known.</P>
<P>The <HI>first,</HI> namely, that of <HI>Touch,</HI> compre∣hends not only the sensation which is excited by any particular impression, but also that change which external objects produce on the skin, and particularly on the ends of the fin∣gers. It is in the latter, and more limited meaning, that I now consider the sense of touch. In order to understand more clearly the great importance of this sense, I shall pre∣mise a concise description of the external in∣teguments of the human body. For there is no doubt, that the skin is the medium of all the senses, and, if I may be allowed the ex∣pression, it is the most unerring guide, and least subject to the illusions of the imagination.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="039111_0572_1013A3B2A5C82268"/>
The whole human body is inclosed in cer∣tain integuments or covers: they consist of <HI>three</HI> different layers, each of which is wisely designed by Nature for protection, benefit, and ornament. The uppermost, that is, the scarf-skin, or <HI>epidermis,</HI> is the thinnest of the three, and is nearly transparent. It covers the whole body, both externally and internal∣ly, not only the mouth, stomach, and bowels, but also every cavity and protuberance of the body; as it forms the upper skin of most of the intestines, the lungs, the heart, the liver, the spleen, &amp;c. This covering is of great ser∣vice to the whole frame, by protecting the parts inclosed in it from external injury, by preventing them from growing together in∣ternally, and by keeping every thing within the body in its proper situation. It is desti∣tute of sensation, which even children know, since they run pins between it, without feel∣ing pain. But it is possessed of the admirable property, that it is very quickly renewed, af∣ter it has been destroyed by accident, or by the measles, scarlet-fever, and similar diseases.</P>
<P>Immediately under this universal and up∣permost covering of our body, there lies a second, reticular, and mucous membrane, which has received from anatomists the name of <HI>rete mucosum.</HI> It is in most parts of the body extremely thin, but it grows considera∣bly thicker in others, for instance, on the heels and the palms of the hand.</P>
<P>This second skin deserves particular atten∣tion, as it is the seat of the colour in different nations; though the cause of this diversity has
<PB N="250" REF="039111_0573_1013A3B7D73F9190"/>
not yet been discovered:—in the Negroes it is black; in the American Indians nearly of copper colour; and in the Europeans gener∣ally white. That the colour of the human body is altogether contained in this second or middle skin, is sufficiently ascertained; for not only the third or true skin of the Ne∣groes is as white as in the Europeans, but the uppermost, or scarf-skin too, though rather of a greyish tint, is scarcely darker in blacks than in white people; and in the latter also the middle skin frequently is of a yellowish, brown, or blackish colour; in which case the whole external skin exhibits a similar appear∣ance.</P>
<P>This variety of colour has led some au∣thors to suppose, that there is a variety in the origin, as well as in the mental capacities of different nations. So palpable an error, how∣ever, could not long remain unrefuted: and it is now almost universally admitted, that there was originally but one species of man, though diversified by the climate, the air, the sun, and the mode of living, which produce all the difference in the colour, as well as in the structure of man. Thus we know that those Americans, who live in the calmer west∣ern and mountainous regions, are not of so deep a copper-colour as those who are more exposed to winds and other contingent causes; that the inhabitants of the northern bank of the river Senegal are of a diminutive size, and of an ash-colour, while those of the oppo∣site bank are black, and at the same time tall and robust. We farther know, that after
<PB N="251" REF="039111_0574_1013A3B95D9FB1C8"/>
some generations, the Negroes are bleached, and people of a white colour become black, when the former emigrate to the cold north∣ern, and the latter to the torrid southern cli∣mates. This difference is also discoverable in our climate, where people moving much in the open air and sunshine acquire a dark col∣our, somewhat resembling that of the swarthy Portuguese.</P>
<P>That there may be also a colouring sub∣stance in the blood, whether owing to the iron said to be contained in this fluid, to the bile, or to an excess of what the old chemists call∣ed <HI>phlogiston</HI> (or what would now be termed the want of <HI>oxygen</HI>)—all of which may have a share in the modification of colours, I am much disposed to admit; because the blood, bile, brain, nay the very vermin on the bo∣dies of the AEthiopians, partake of their native colour.</P>
<P>The <HI>third</HI> and innermost of the integuments of our body is the true skin, or the <HI>cutis vera,</HI> which immediately covers the fat and the muscles. It is of a compact, interwoven, cel∣lular texture, which is very thick and smooth on its upper surface, of a white colour in all nations, loose or pliable on its inner surface, and furnished with more or less fat. It not only possesses a considerable degree of expan∣sibility, and contractility, but is also provided with numberless pores. Its thickness varies in different individuals. It is traversed by a great number of fine arteries, interwoven in the form of a net, and which may be exhibit∣ed to the eye by injecting them with a red flu∣id,
<PB N="252" REF="039111_0575_1013A3BBF299B470"/>
so that the skin then has the appearance of being thoroughly coloured. It is likewise fur∣nished with an equal number of veins, and delicate absorbent vessels.</P>
<P>From the many nerves which pervade the true skin, it possesses an uncommon degree of sensibility, especially in those parts where we can perceive the <HI>papillae</HI> of the nerves. These are small portuberances of different figures, of a reticular structure, and a pulpy consistence. In some places, as the lips, they are not unlike flakes, though they generally resemble little warts, such we observe on the points of the fingers and toes, as well as on many of the most sensible parts of the body, but particular∣ly the tongue. They are most visible on the ends of the fingers in delicate persons; they can be traced, with the naked eye, by the spi∣ral lines terminating almost in a point, and are protected and supported by nails proceeding from the skin which grows over them. It is in these papillary extremities, that every ex∣ternal impression is most distinctly and forcibly perceived, on account of the number of nerves lying almost exposed to view in these places.</P>
<P>The sense of touch can be improved, by practice, to an astonishing degree. There are many examples of blind people having attain∣ed so great a perfection of this sense, that they could with accuracy distinguish the difference of coins, of metals, and even of colours, mere∣ly by the touch. I myself knew a blind man, who had learnt to take a watch to pieces, to clean it perfectly, and to put it together again, without any other assistance, but that of the
<PB N="253" REF="039111_0576_1013A3BD8596C558"/>
instruments commonly used, and the exquisite feeling of his fingers.</P>
<P>I have now only to describe the operation or mechanism of this sense.—When the nervous papillae are pressed against external objects, the nerves receive a kind of vibration, which is communicated to their branches, and thence to the brain. Thus we are enabled to feel the hardness, roughness, moisture, warmth, gravi∣ty, figure, size, and even the distance of bodies. But, that this feeling may not become painful, Nature has provided another cover, namely the scarf-skin, which serves the important pur∣poses of secluding the air from the true skin, and preventing the body from being too much dried.—The nails increase the energy of touch, and render the sense of it more acute, as they resist the pressure of external objects.</P>
<P>The <HI>second</HI> of our senses, though less essen∣tial to animal life, is more conducive to our welfare and happiness. Without <HI>Sight</HI> we can∣not justly contemplate the wonders of Nature, and existence is deprived of its greatest charms. An anatomical description of the eyes would lead us too far from the object of these inquir∣ies, and would not be intelligible without a more particular analysis and demonstration than our limits allow.</P>
<P>In the sense of sight, we are far excelled by most of the lower animals. Eagles and hawks, in particular, descry their prey, when beyond the reach of our sight, though aided by a tel∣escope. Yet in men, also, this sense may be wonderfully improved, and I remember to have heard the celebrated <HI>Baron Trenk</HI> assert,
<PB N="254" REF="039111_0577_1013A3C033125B28"/>
that during his long captivity in the state dun∣geon at Magdeburg, he had so much improved his sight, that he could see the mice traversing his gloomy cell in the middle of the darkest night—whether this assertion was exaggerated, I do not pretend to decide.</P>
<P>The operations of sight are performed in the most accurate manner. By the structure of the eye, no rays of light can pass into it, unless emitted within an angle not exceeding 90 degrees. Every thing here is regulated upon optical principles, sensation excepted. This is situated in the <HI>retina,</HI> a membrane hav∣ing the form of a net, and being, as it were, the mirror by which external objects are rep∣resented to the mind. If this mirror be de∣stroyed, as is the case in <HI>amaurosis,</HI> or <HI>gutta se∣rena,</HI> our sight is irrecoverably lost.</P>
<P>All vision consists in the refraction of the rays of light, by means of the crystalline hu∣mour, till all the rays are concentrated into one distinct image on the retina. The rays of light, while they pass through the arched surface of the <HI>cornea,</HI> or the horny skin, are broken and brought in contact with each other; and this is still farther promoted, while they pass through the more dense crystalline lens. They then converge at the spot where the vitreous hu∣mour is contained: here they again diverge, once more come in contact, and finally collect in as many points as are represented by the ex∣ternal object. This image, which is depicted on, and stimulates the retina, is communica∣ted to the mind, and produces the sensation of sight.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="039111_0578_1013A3C4E9483CC0"/>
It is partly owing to the above-mentioned refraction, partly to the constant and uniform reference to the internal sense, that in the act of vision we see objects in an upright posture before us, though they are properly imprint∣ed on the retina, in an inverted posture. By this admirable mechanism, all objects are in∣vertedly presented to the eye, so that we can∣not err in this respect, since the relation and proportion of things uniformly remain the same.</P>
<P>But it will be asked, how does it happen, that with two eyes, we see only one object? This question is easily answered by those, who inform us, that with two nostrils we are sensi∣ble of only one particular smell, and with two ears we hear but one distinct sound; that a similar external stimulus, in similar nerves, will always produce the same internal sensation, and that accidental deviations, or diseases on∣ly, can affect this principle. Yet the expla∣nation now given is altogether insufficient, as it proceeds from analogical reasoning.</P>
<P>If we wish to form a clear conception of this faculty, we must above all things direct our at∣tention to the <HI>axis</HI> of vision, or that imagina∣ry line, which we draw in a straight direction from the centre of the eye to the object, and which is prolonged before and behind that or∣gan. We must next advert to the situation in which the eyes are placed. They do not lie perfectly straight in their sockets, but some∣what in an oblique direction towards the nose. If, then, we prolong, for a short space only, the axis beyond the eye, we shall soon find,
<PB N="256" REF="039111_0579_1013A3C66F4F01F8"/>
that the two imaginary lines meet in a certain point. This is called the <HI>Focus,</HI> or the point of vision—the termination of the external rays of light.</P>
<P>If a person be able to see to a great distance, his lines of vision intersect each other at a greater distance from the eye, and consequent∣ly his focus is farther removed from it. This defect is called <HI>presbyopia,</HI> or far-sightedness, and may be remedied by means of convex glasses; but, if from the too great convexity, or an extraordinary converging power of the eye, the rays of light too soon unite in one point, and, as this point is placed before the retina, from whence the rays of light again diverge, vision becomes indistinct, till the ob∣ject be brought nearer to the eye; in order to place the point of union, as it were, farther behind the eye—this deficiency of vision is called <HI>myopia,</HI> or short-sightedness, and may be relieved by concave glasses. Of these, as well as other defects of the eye, and the most proper methods of preventing and curing them, I shall treat in the next Chapter.</P>
<P>It farther deserves to be remarked, that the optic nerves cross each other in the brain, and that we are accustomed, from our infancy, to see only one object at a time. Hence chil∣dren should be so placed in bed, that they may not learn to squint, or that the eyes may not be directed upwards and outwards, but rather downwards and inwards, in order to habituate them properly to form the axis above describ∣ed. That custom has great influence, in this respect, is obvious from the circumstance, that
<PB N="257" REF="039111_0580_1013A3C8F851B1B0"/>
those who squint, not unfrequently see two objects at once; and that such eyes, as by ac∣cident or disease have become double-sighted, may, by continued exertions, be again habit∣uated to view objects distinctly.</P>
<P>Every one must have observed, that upon en∣tering suddenly from a very dark place into bright sunshine, he could scarcely see any ob∣ject, has felt pain in the eyes, shed involuntary tears, or sneezed. This temporary deprivation of sight is owing to the pupil of the eye being dilated in a dark place, and contracted again at the approach of light. The dilatation and contraction of the pupil is in proportion to the darkness or brightness of the place. If the change from a dark to a bright place be in∣stantaneous, the pupil cannot dilate and con∣tract quickly enough; it is, as it were, palsied, together with the retina, and we cannot see at all. The pain of the eyes, and the flow of tears under these circumstances, must be as∣cribed to similar causes. Every stimulus wheth∣er occasioned by heat, cold, winds, colours, and the like, excites a sensation, which is agreeable, if it be moderate and not too long continued; but which becomes painful and disagreeable, as it increases in violence and du∣ration. There remains another curious phe∣nomenon to be explained, namely, that of <HI>sneezing,</HI> which often takes place, when we suddenly go from darkness to a strong light. Here the same cause operates, though under different circumstances. The optic nerves consist of the second pair of the nerves of the
<PB N="258" REF="039111_0581_1013A3CCAE3ED248"/>
brain; with these are united the third pair, the fourth pair, and some branches of the fifth and sixth pair. Yet the second pair, or the peculiar optic nerve, has the most important share in vision. It proceeds from the brain straight to the pupil of the eye, pervades this almost through the middle of its posterior in∣ternal part, where it terminates and dilates it∣self, or, as it were, melts into a soft, downy skin, forming the <HI>retina,</HI> which covers a great part of the posterior internal eye.—Now, from the fifth pair of nerves there proceeds but one branch into the eyes, while another takes its direction to the nose. When the eye is sud∣denly impressed with the rays of light, that branch of the fifth pair which extends to the eyes, is stimulated in common with the other branch of the same pair proceeding to the nose. If the stimulus be violent, it is communicated to both branches, that of the nose is likewise stimulated, and we are compelled to sneeze.</P>
<P>To conclude the account of the sense of sight, I must remark, that the representations of the mind scarcely display their influence on any other of the senses, to so extensive a de∣gree, as they do upon this: hence it happens, that we sometimes imagine we see images be∣fore us, in the clearest manner, though the rep∣resentation of them be merely a phantom of the brain. The impression forcibly made on the retina, remains there for some time, even after the object itself has vanished; thus we imagine we see a fiery ring, when a burning coal is swiftly moved in a circle.—That we be∣lieve we see many bright colours, when we
<PB N="259" REF="039111_0582_1013A3CF47CC1800"/>
rub and press the closed eye with the fingers, is owing to this cause, that the same kind of effect is produced on the nerves of the eye by friction, as usually accompanies the view of the colours themselves. But whether colours, in general, depend on the different degrees of vibration of the air, or on the elements of the rays of light, which, by their division, appear singly and distinctly in the prism, is a problem not yet, and which perhaps never will be, sat∣isfactorily solved.</P>
<P>By the next sense, namely, that of <HI>Hearing,</HI> we perceive the vibrations of the air which oc∣casion sound. For this purpose our ears are formed partly of cartilages, and partly of bones, in order to communicate these vibra∣tions to the auditory nerves, and thence to the brain. This sense also is more acute in the lower animals, than in the human species. The hare, for instance, is warned against ap∣proaching danger, by her exquisitely fine ear; and the owl, being sensible of the softest sounds, makes use of her acute ear to assist her in the discovery of prey.</P>
<P>The warm-blooded animals have an external and an internal ear; but in almost every species it is of a different structure. Most animals can move their ears—an advantage not enjoyed by man; though it was not Nature which formed our ears immoveable, but an absurd custom, continued for many centuries, grad∣ually produced this effect. That the ears were not naturally designed to lie flat on the head, is sufficiently obvious from the number of muscles with which they are provided, and
<PB N="260" REF="039111_0583_1013A3D0CC7FEBB0"/>
each of which is designed to perform different motions.</P>
<P>The manner in which the sense of hearing is produced, is shortly this. The vibrations of the air, which take place by the concussion of any elastic body, first strike the external ear; hence the sound agitates the <HI>tympanum.</HI> But that the vibrations may not become too violent, and the tympanum may not burst, as is to be apprehended from a very loud and near sound, the ear is provided with a siphon, which anat∣omists call the <HI>Eustachian tube,</HI> and through which the air collected on the tympanum again escapes. But the vibration of the tympanum is also communicated through the four little bones of the ear; it is forwarded through what is called the <HI>stapes,</HI> or stirrup, to the vestibule, or the first entrance, and through the mem∣brane of the <HI>fenestra rotunda,</HI> as far as the in∣nermost cavity of the ear, which resembles the shell of a snail, and is therefore called <HI>coch∣lea.</HI> The whole labyrinth of the ear being fill∣ed with a subtile water in small quantity, this fluid gently agitates the substance of the audi∣tory nerve; in consequence of which sound is communicated to the brain. The humour contained in the labyrinth of the ear obviously serves the purpose of preventing the soft, pap∣py substance of the auditory nerve from being too violently agitated.</P>
<P>The use of the cochlea, which is very arti∣ficially constructed, cannot be easily deter∣mined; it is probably rather designed for the more accurate distinction of the varieties of tones, than for the perception of sounds in
<PB N="261" REF="039111_0584_1013A3D257FE1318"/>
general; for we may consider the delicate nerves, that run along the spiral line of this cochlea, as a number of chords growing pro∣gressively shorter, and which, in a manner, re∣peat the external vibrations of the air, in the internal parts of the ear. This repetition ap∣pears to be performed according to a geomet∣rical scale, since the same vibrations of the air take place here in a reduced proportion. Hence sounds, which are too loud and pene∣trating, offend our ears, because they shake the auditory nerves too quickly and violently, so that these may even be lacerated, and pro∣duce deafness; but this is not the case, when the tympanum is broken by accident.</P>
<P>Some persons, who are defective in this sense, are obliged to make use of ear-trumpets, and to turn their ear to the quarter whence the sound proceeds; to place the hand at the side of the ear; to open their mouth, or use some other assistant means. All this is done with a view to supply the motion of the ears, of which we have been deprived by habits contrary to the laws of Nature: these motions the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> animals perform, by pointing their ears in the direction from which the sound proceeds. In this manner, the ear receives a greater pro∣portion of sound; and many divisions of it, which might otherwise escape, are conveyed to the nerves.</P>
<P>By means of the teeth, and other bones of the head, sounds may be conducted to the au∣ditory nerves, so as to communicate the neces∣sary vibrations to the internal ear, though we can hear more easily and distinctly, when the
<PB N="262" REF="039111_0585_1013A3D4ED993BA8"/>
sound comes through the organ itself. There is, however, a method of communicating sounds to the deaf, with better success than by the common ear-trumpets, which instruments, at length entirely destroy that sense. This is effected by means of a cylindrical rod or tube of ivory, or any similar hard substance: the rod may be from six to twelve inches long and upwards, and from a quarter to half an inch in diameter; if it be made hollow through∣out, the part which is placed in the mouth between the front teeth ought to have a much smaller aperture than the other extremity. This tube is well calculated to assist those deaf persons, who wish to enjoy the music of a harp, harpsichord, or other instrument. I once knew a gentleman, who was quite deaf, but with the assistance of a cylinder, such as I have described, was enabled to hear the softest notes distinctly, and to enjoy all the pleasures of music.</P>
<P>Lastly, it is a false assertion, that there is al∣ways a hole in the tympanum; for it is owing to the double opening of the Eustachian tube, that many jugglers can cause the liquor they drink to flow out of the ear, in the same man∣ner as they discharge the smoke of tobacco through the nose and ears.</P>
<P>Our <HI>fourth</HI> sense is that of <HI>Smell.</HI> It is near∣ly related to the sense of taste, probably from the great similarity of structure in the organs of these two senses, and their vicinity to each other. This is attended with the manifest ad∣vantage, that man and animals are generally enabled to discover, without danger, any un∣wholesome
<PB N="263" REF="039111_0586_1013A3D994EC56A8"/>
food. The functions of this sense are exercised by the nose, and chiefly by the mucous membrane which lines that organ. The whole inside of the nose is covered with this membrane, which is a continuation of the general integuments of the body, but much softer, more mucous and porous, full of ves∣sels, exquisitely sensible, and covered with hair towards the lower part of the nostrils, to prevent any impurities from ascending too far.</P>
<P>Of all the parts of the mouth connected with the nose, the most remarkable is the cavity of the jaw-bone, or the <HI>sinus maxillaris,</HI> which extends over the whole breadth of the two up∣per jaw-bones, and opens itself into the nose between the middle and lower shell. In new∣born children, all these cavities are not yet formed, and this is the cause of their imper∣fect smell. In order to moisten the membranes, which otherwise would become too dry, by the air we inhale through the nostrils, there de∣scends a nasal canal from each cavity of the eyes, which communicates with the lower shell, in order to conduct the tears continually into the nose.</P>
<P>If we make an effort to smell, we draw up the air filled with the volatile, oily, and saline particles of odorous substances: these particles come in contact with the fine branches of the olfactory nerves, which have the capacity of receiving impressions, and thus the sensation is imparted to the brain. These nerves rise immediately from the brain, and are larger in many animals than in man. The bigness of the nerves, however, is no proof of the great∣er
<PB N="264" REF="039111_0587_1013A3DC2A381EE8"/>
degree of sensation in the animal, or of the superior abilities of the mind. On the con∣trary, it is now pretty generally believed, that the mental capacities of organized beings are in an inverted proportion to the size of the nerves rising out of the brain, and the medul∣lary substance of the spine. Thus, for instance, the amphibious animals have strong nerves, in proportion to their small brain, and yet they are, in general, extremely insensible and stupid. Lean people, and ricketty children, on the contrary, have very thin and fine nerves to a large brain; and who has not ob∣served their sensibility of mind, as well as their quick and acute feelings?</P>
<P>But to return from this digression.—The saline and oily particles which affect the smell, are more volatile and subtile than those dis∣tinguished by the taste; yet this difference may in a great measure arise from the nerves of the tongue being covered with thicker membranes than those of the nose.—In many animals, the sense of smelling is more acute than in man, who would probably be much incommoded by too refined a perception of this kind. But it may be much improved by exercise, or depraved by neglect. Hence the American Indian can discover the footsteps of man and other animals by smell alone;—while persons who live in a bad and fetid at∣mosphere, are scarcely sensible of the differ∣ence between the most fragrant and offensive substances.—It is remarkable, that most ma∣niacs and inveterate hypochondriacs, are ex∣cessively
<PB N="265" REF="039111_0588_1013A3DDB1332378"/>
fond of snuff, and every thing that stimulates the nose.</P>
<P>Of all the quadrupeds we know, the dog excels in the acuteness of this sense; and there are many extraordinary instances record∣ed of his peculiar and astonishing powers of smell; with one of which, as well authenti∣cated as it is extraordinary, I shall conclude this subject.—In the year 1582 <HI>Leonhard Zol∣likofer</HI> set out from his Chateau Altenklingen, in Switzerland, for Paris; the distance of which is upwards of five hundred English miles. A fortnight after his departure, his faithful dog, who had till then been confined, also set out alone for Paris; where he ar∣rived in the course of eight days, and discov∣ered his master in the midst of a crowd, af∣ter having searched for him in vain at his lodgings.</P>
<P>We are now arrived at the <HI>fifth</HI> and last of our senses, the <HI>Taste,</HI> which is so distinguished a favourite of a great number of persons, that it appears, as if they wished to live only for the sake of its gratification. I have in former parts of this work endeavoured to in∣culcate the propriety and absolute necessity of attending to the effects produced on this sense by food and drink, without which animal life cannot be long supported. In this place, therefore, there remains to be described only the mechanism and the functions of this sense.</P>
<P>The principal organ of taste is the tongue, which in very few animals is as sensible as in man. The former choose, indeed, among the
<PB N="266" REF="039111_0589_1013A3E066698EA0"/>
herbs upon which they feed, by accurately distinguishing the useful from the noxious plants; but this appears to be more in conse∣quence of their acute smell, than from the guidance of their taste. To describe the fig∣ure and shape of the tongue, is not consistent with my plan; but I shall briefly observe, that this organ is provided with innumerable nerves, which terminate in certain warts, or papillae, of a different size and figure, some of them pointed, others oblong, and others fungous.</P>
<P>These nervous papillae are the peculiar seat of the sense of taste, or the palate. But, to taste any thing whatever, either the tongue should be moist, or the substance applied to the tongue should contain moisture. In as∣certaining the difference of taste, the little warts are, in some degree, dilated: every substance we can taste, contains a greater or smaller proportion of saline and oily particles, which must be soluble by the tongue. If the sensation of the saline particles be acrid, the taste is strong, disagreeable, and at length be∣comes painful: this is also the case, if the tongue, by burning or other accidents, be deprived of any part of the epidermis, or scarf-skin.</P>
<P>Such bodies as contain no saline particles, as pure water, excite no kind of taste what∣ever. The difference of taste cannot be ac∣counted for from the variety of figure in the crystals of the different salts, but appears to arise from the chemical properties inherent in saline bodies.—It may be laid down as a gen∣eral
<PB N="267" REF="039111_0590_1013A3E453760E40"/>
rule, that every substance, which affords an agreeable taste to a healthy person of an undepraved palate, is wholesome: as, on the contrary, substances of an acrid and disagree∣able taste are commonly pernicious.</P>
<P>The different degrees of taste depend on the greater or less sensibility of the nervous papillae before described, as well as on the quality of the saliva, in a more or less healthy state of the body. If our nerves be blunted and weakened by smoaking tobacco, by too strong and highly-seasoned food, by the copious use of spirituous liquors, by age, or other causes, we cannot reasonably expect to possess the same degree of sensibility of taste, as if we had been more attentive to the ordinances of Na∣ture.—The more simple our usual aliment is, the less it is seasoned by hot spices and the less we stimulate the palate by wine and ardent spirits, we shall the better preserve our taste, together with the nerves of the tongue; and we shall have a greater relish for rich dishes, when they are but occasionally presented to our palate.</P>
<P>The senses, then, are those organs, by means of which the mind perceives or feels external objects. They may be considered as the satellites of the mind; and although some animals enjoy particular senses more acutely than man, yet his senses are more comprehen∣sive, and he is amply compensated by the ex∣tensive use he can make of them, while the inferior creatures possess a more intensive ap∣plication of their sensitive faculties.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="039111_0591_1013A3E5D8AEA250"/>
We have now considered the mode in which the senses operate; we have seen that every thing depends upon a nervous stimulus, which, by the most diversified organs, is communi∣cated to the mind: there remain to be added only a few remarks and explanations, relative to animal motion, or muscular action.</P>
<P>The machine of the human body is put in motion by a great diversity of powers.—Of these, the highest and most energetic is that of the <HI>mind;</HI> the next subordinate power is that of the <HI>nerves,</HI> immediately after which fol∣lows the most operative of the corporeal pow∣ers, that is, <HI>muscular irritability,</HI> or the peculiar faculty of the muscles to contract, in conse∣quence of any stimulus applied to them. I pur∣posely omit in this place, what physiologists have called the vital power, the peculiar pow∣er of life, or BLUMENBACH's <HI>vita propria;</HI> and the healing power of Nature, or <HI>vis medi∣catrix naturae</HI> of the ancient physicians. All these powers are, in a great measure, hypo∣thetical, though their frequent operations in a diseased state of the body cannot be denied. And, as the muscular powers of men and ani∣mals are the most obvious to the senses, I shall content myself with stating what has a refer∣ence to these.</P>
<P>A <HI>muscle</HI> is a bundle of thin and parallel plates of fleshy threads or fibres. These are connected by a loose and generally fat cellular membrane; they separate into greater bundles, till at length several portions of a muscle lying parallel, or inclining towards one another, are again surrounded by a tender membrane of
<PB N="269" REF="039111_0592_1013A3E880D1DE90"/>
a cellular texture, which forms one substance with the collateral partitions; and these, be∣ing again separated from the contiguous flesh, by a somewhat thicker cellular texture, are then considered as one distinct muscle.</P>
<P>The human body has a considerable num∣ber of muscles, yet many of the lower animals are provided with a much greater proportion of them. The caterpillar (<HI>Phalaena Cossus,</HI> L.) has about 3500 muscles, while the human body can count scarcely 450. The muscles of an∣imals, in general, are more powerful than those of man. What astonishing power, for instance, is the leaping chafer, or the grasshopper, o∣bliged to employ, in order to make jumps, which extend to several hundred times the length of their own bodies! Another small in∣sect, the flea, excels all other animals in its pro∣digious leaps, and is able to carry a weight 80 times heavier than its body. All these appa∣rent wonders are accomplished by means of the muscles. The figure of them, in man, is very irregular; those only, which are design∣ed to perform certain <HI>valvular</HI> motions, such as the muscles of the mouth, the eye-lids, the bladder, the anus, &amp;c. are of a circular or round figure.</P>
<P>All the muscles contract in the direction of their fibres; the middle part or the belly of the muscle swells, hence it gets shorter, and both ends approach one another. Most of our mus∣cles operate in the manner of a lever; the two ends of every muscle, in the extremities of an∣imals, are fastened to the bones, by means of
<PB N="270" REF="039111_0593_1013A3EA1A652FD8"/>
tendons or sinews; one of these extremities only being moveable, while the other remains fixed. Hence, in the contraction of the mus∣cles, the moveable bone is drawn according to the direction of their fibres. If a muscle be contracted, it necessarily swells in thickness, as may be distinctly felt by placing the hand up∣on the <HI>masseter,</HI> a muscle of the lower jaw, and compressing the back teeth. As soon, how∣ever, as the nerve of the muscle is cut, or tied only, the contracting or swelling power instant∣ly ceases, whence we are inclined to suppose, that the nerves have the principal share in reg∣ulating the powers of contraction, extension, and loco-motion. Whether this be done by the influx of a fluid into the nerves, or by some other latent power, has not yet been discovered.</P>
<P>The energy of muscular action is remarka∣ble in every healthy individual, but particularly in very strong men, and frequently too in ma∣niacs. With the assistance of a few muscles on∣ly, they are enabled to raise a weight, often much exceeding that of the whole human frame.—In order to support the pressure of the lever, which is accomplished with a great loss of power, and to preserve and consolidate the muscles in their situation, they run at one time under cross ligaments, as is the case on the fingers; at another time they move in rollers, for instance, in the eye; and, again, in other places, they are supported in their position by the peculiar structure of the bones, as we find on the upper part of the shoulders.</P>
<P>If a computation could be made of all the losses of power which the muscles experience,
<PB N="271" REF="039111_0594_1013A3ECE67273F8"/>
partly by their frequent insertion at very acute angles, partly by their being extended as a chord, and drawing a weight opposite to its fixed point; partly by passing over certain joints which break the force to be applied to a particular joint; and, lastly, by their fleshy fibres being obstructed by the angles they make with the tendons;—if all these impediments could be reduced to an accurate calculation, we should be astonished at the contractile force exerted by the muscles, as it would exceed any amount of powers raised upon mechanical principles. It is confidently asserted, that the effect is scarcely 1/60th part of that force which the muscles employ; and yet a small number of them, the substance of which is equal in weight to a few pounds only, possess the power of lifting, or at least moving, several hundred weight, and this with inconceivable facility and swiftness. It would be presumptuous to ascribe the great losses of muscular power to any defect in the animal economy: for, if we had the full use of our muscles, the just sym∣metry or proportion of the parts would be de∣stroyed, and it might otherwise be attended with many physical evils, the consequences of which we cannot comprehend.</P>
<P>As an ample compensation for the want of this unnecessary strength, Nature has provided the upper ends of the muscles, which bend the joints, and chiefly those of the knees, with certain bags, <HI>bursae mucosae,</HI> which contain a lubricating mucus, to facilitate the motion of the tendons. And to this beneficent arrange∣ment we owe the ability of exercising the power
<PB N="272" REF="039111_0595_1013A3F08D0DA8D8"/>
of the muscles with such extraordinary activ∣ity, and without feeling them rigid and inflex∣ible, after violent and long-continued exercise.</P>
<P>Being now acquainted, in some degree, with the <HI>nerves</HI> and <HI>muscles;</HI> it will also be necessary to say a few words relative to the <HI>blood;</HI> espe∣cially as the doctrine of <HI>temperaments,</HI> already treated of in the Introduction, was principally founded on the nature of these three substances.</P>
<P>The quantity of blood in a human body of full growth, is generally computed at 30 lb. This liquid apparently consists of two parts on∣ly, namely, the <HI>serum,</HI> or water, and the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rassamentum,</HI> or the thick and coagulable part of the blood. But, as the latter can be again separated into two parts, namely, the <HI>cruor,</HI> or the thick and red part, and the coagulable <HI>lymph,</HI> the blood consequently consists of three principal constituents: the serum, the cruor, and the lymph. Besides these, there is also a considerable quantity of air contained in the blood, which is, as it were, the medium of combination in all vegetable, animal, and mineral bodies; for, when the air is expelled, whether by combustion, fermentation, putre∣faction, or any other process, they hasten to∣wards their inevitable dissolution.</P>
<P>There is further contained in the blood, much water, a small proportion of oil, some salt, earth, and a little iron, which, together with the heat produced by respiration, is sup∣posed to impart the red colour to that fluid. The red colour is confined to the <HI>cruor,</HI> which consists of very minute red globules, nearly re∣sembling in shape the eggs of silk-worms.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="039111_0596_1013A3F32B0DBA80"/>
Much remains to be said on the properties of the blood, and its wonderful circulation in the human body; but, as this subject, from want of room, cannot be satisfactorily discus∣sed here, I am under the necessity of conclu∣ding this Chapter with the following remark: that the variety of temperaments in man ap∣pears to be owing to the different mixture of the fluids, and the diversified structure of the solids, particularly of the nerves and muscles. This is so true, that the whole picture of his physical life, together with his moral charac∣ter, depend chiefly on the various combination of these parts. Yet there are different means by which peculiar temperaments are genera∣ted;—the first of these is <HI>climate,</HI> which forms the national character;—the second is a certain <HI>hereditary disposition,</HI> which we derive from our parents;—and the third is the peculiar <HI>organization</HI> of the individual.</P>

<HEAD>I. On the importance of bestowing proper care on these organs.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is scarcely any part of the sensitive faculties, which contributes more to our physical enjoyments than the unimpaired power of vision. Hence the management of the eyes deserves the care and attention of every person, who wishes to preserve them in a sound and perfect state, and to retard, although we can∣not altogether avert, the natural consequences which accompany the advance of years. By our mode of life, this infirmity is much accel∣erated, and the eyes are weakened and worn out, or at least rendered too irritable. Such is particularly the case in those classes of peo∣ple, who are much employed in sedentary oc∣cupations, who work by candle-light, or are much exposed to dust, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="039111_0598_1013A3F96D7D5ED8"/>
The remarks, rules, and observations of this Chapter will relate chiefly to the treatment, both of sound and weak eyes, and occasionally also to the regimen of them in a diseased state.</P>
<P>More accuracy and attention is required in this respect, than inexperienced persons gen∣erally imagine. Till of late years, proper at∣tention has not been paid, to lay down and es∣tablish well-founded and practical rules on the subject of the eyes, and their treatment. Some modern physicians and oculists, however, have usefully devoted much time and labour to in∣quiries into the maladies of this organ. The fruits of these researches, as well as my own experience, on this point, I now proceed to lay before the reader.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>II. Of short-sightedness, and the reverse.</HEAD>
<P>MAN probably enjoys his sight to a later period of life than any of the lower animals, and might preserve it still longer, if he were better informed respecting its preservation. Those who are naturally short-sighted, are en∣titled to expect an improvement of vision with the advancement of age; for their eyes then gradually begin to lose that uncommon round∣ness which produces this defect, and thus to arrive at a greater enjoyment of the beauties of Nature. Persons who can see objects distinctly at a great distance only, cannot, however, be considered as less unfortunate; as they stand
<PB N="276" REF="039111_0599_1013A3FAF18834D0"/>
in need of glasses, chiefly for the better dis∣tinguishing of more minute objects.</P>
<P>The nursery, or the room appropriated to the use of children, is generally the smallest, if not the lowest apartment in the house; so that the infant, having the opportunity to ex∣ercise its eyes on near objects only, often be∣comes more short-sighted than it is naturally. Hence children ought at least to be frequently carried to the window, and have their eyes di∣rected to a distant view. On this account, a nursery enjoying an extensive prospect is much preferable to one where the view is confined. Many persons who see well at a distance in their infancy, injure their sight by reading and writing by candle-light, but particularly fe∣males, by fine needle-work; as the eye is there∣by too much accustomed to near and minute objects.</P>
<P>One of the bad consequences of short-sight∣edness is, that people get into a habit of mak∣ing use of one eye only. The effort of direct∣ing both pupils to the object before them is attended with too much trouble; hence they look at it sideways. It would be less detrimen∣tal, if they were to use the eyes alternately; but here too it is equally easy to acquire a bad habit; for the eye, which is spared or not ex∣ercised, becomes inert and useless. Still worse is the use of a magnifying or reading glass, by which people accustom themselves to shut the eye then unemployed. The other, which is thus unduly exerted, somewhat shifts its posi∣tion, it becomes progressively less flexible in its internal parts, and persons who take advan∣tage
<PB N="277" REF="039111_0600_1013A3FD95754170"/>
of this temporary aid, do not find their powers of vision improve with the advance∣ment of age.</P>
<P>To prevent these bad habits, the following advice may be useful:—Children suspected of being short-sighted, should have their eyes di∣rected to an object held close to them; and if they appear to make use of one eye only, that eye should be occasionally closed, so that they may be obliged to exercise the other. When they learn to read, they should be taught to hold the book straight before their eyes; thus they will exert themselves to discover the printed letters at the greatest distance at which they are made to place it. The eyes, by de∣grees, become accustomed to the necessary in∣ternal change of their posture, and the child will, in time, certainly improve in the exten∣sion of its sight. Many persons indeed have, at a juvenile age, got rid of their short-sight∣edness; but there cannot be found one in∣stance of this improvement among those who have, either from fashionable indulgence or necessity, habituated themselves to use only one eye.</P>
<P>It is to be regretted, that in short-sighted individuals the breast and abdomen suffer much from compression during sedentary oc∣cupations, so that they are frequently troubled with hypochondriasis, and, what is still worse, are sometimes thrown into a consumption of the lungs. Though standing at intervals agrees with employments that do not require great mental exertion; yet, in the contrary
<PB N="278" REF="039111_0601_1013A3FF256E36E0"/>
case, it consumes more strength than is gen∣erally imagined; and, in acute reflections, the mind ought not to be fatigued by the body. In this case, well-chosen <HI>concave spectacles</HI> may be used with advantage, so that the body may be placed, while reading or writing, in the most convenient posture: for such glasses will oblige the wearer to remove the object some∣what farther from the eyes.</P>
<P>After severe diseases of the eyes, one of them frequently becomes short-sighted, while the other is scarcely, if at all, affected. The consequence is, that we employ the sound eye alone, while the weak one is totally impaired by this neglect. In such a situation, we ought to use glasses in reading or writing, one of which should be carefully selected for the short-sighted eye, (according to the rules hereafter to be specified) and the other of plain, clear glass, chiefly for the sake of affording an equal degree of light to both eyes. If, by this pre∣caution, the weaker eye has perceptibly gained strength, we may employ a less concave glass instead of that first used, so that in time it may be similar with the other, and at length the patient be enabled to do without this assistance.</P>
<P>Eyes which form too extensive a focus, re∣quire no aid, unless they be extravagantly so. Then, indeed, we should not hesitate to make use of convex glasses. It is, however, a vul∣gar prejudice, that by such glasses the eye is too much indulged, and rendered still more <HI>far-sighted.</HI> On the contrary, it is generally improved during the use of these spectacles,
<PB N="279" REF="039111_0602_1013A401CD30B968"/>
and, after the lapse of several years, they may again be dispensed with.</P>
<P>It is a consolation in many diseases of the eyes, that a long-continued weakness is seldom the forerunner of total blindness. This fatal event generally happens by sudden accidents, and is speedily decided.—Adults are not very subject to external complaints of the eye, or such as deprive the <HI>cornea</HI> of its transparency.</P>
<P>Small round spots, hovering before the eyes like strings of hollow little globules connected with one another, are defects of no great con∣sequence, and of which, perhaps, no eye is completely free.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>III. General Rules for the Preservation of the Eyes.</HEAD>
<P>IN all employments whatever, let us attend as much as possible to this circumstance, that the eyes may have an uniform and sufficient light, so as to affect the <HI>retina</HI> on all sides alike.—The eyes materially suffer, when the rays of the sun are strongly reflected from the opposite wall or window.</P>
<P>In children, many disorders of the eye, which would never have had so fatal an issue, have terminated in total blindness, when pa∣rents have neglected to provide the cradle or window with proper curtains. For this rea∣son, we ought to be extremely cautious in the choice of an apartment appropriated to the
<PB N="280" REF="039111_0603_1013A406780F74A8"/>
labours of the day. We should not place ourselves directly opposite to the light, in reading and writing; we ought rather to take the light in a lateral direction.</P>
<P>A great obstacle to this arrangement is the change of light in the same apartment, by the progress of the sun. Where the sun dazzled in the morning, we find in the middle of the day the most uniform light, which again in the afternoon, particularly in towns, becomes reverberatory, and extremely hurtful. This inconvenience should be remedied, if possible, by a frequent change of the room; or, at least, we might produce more uniformity in the light by means of window curtains, or blinds; and it may be observed, that blinds of green or whited-brown linen are best adapted for this purpose.</P>
<P>It is an useful practice to protect weak eyes from the descending rays by means of shades; because the vivid light striking them from above, is thus intercepted. But we ought to consider, that the lower part of the eye is by such means completely shaded; while the up∣per part of this organ is stimulated by the light it receives from below;—a practice which can∣not be productive of good consequences. If the malady be situated in the upper part of the eye, this conduct is still more improper: for the healthy part is in this manner protected, and that already relaxed is still more weaken∣ed.</P>
<P>Darkness, or shade, is then only beneficial to the eyes, when they are unemployed, when the obscurity is natural, and consequently
<PB N="281" REF="039111_0604_1013A4091BF804D8"/>
every where extended. To rest a little during the twilight, is very suitable to weak eyes. No artificial darkness during the day is ever so uni∣form, but that the eye must exert itself at one time more than at another, and necessarily suffer by this change. Persons with weak or diseased eyes, who spend the whole day in an apartment darkened with green curtains, injure their sight still more by this pernicious practice. It is far more prudent to repair to clear day-light and the fresh air, and to direct the eyes to distant prospects, than to confine them to the close atmosphere of a room, and to the sight of near objects.</P>
<P>Lastly, it is an error, that weak eyes, when employed in minute vision, ought to have a faint light; for by this practice they are cer∣tainly still more weakened. Thus green spec∣tacles are very hurtful to some eyes, as they deprive them of that light which is necessary to a distinct perception of objects.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>IV. Of the Conduct to be observed in Weak Eyes.</HEAD>
<P>THE artificial light of candles and lamps is detrimental to weak eyes; not, as some imag∣ine, on account of the light being too strong for the eyes, but because the flame of a candle too powerfully illumines the eye in one point, and does not uniformly stimulate the <HI>retina.</HI></P>
<P>The means used to prevent the great stimu∣lus from the rays of light are, in general, so
<PB N="282" REF="039111_0605_1013A40ADA7F2C30"/>
regulated, that the screen may not only cover the flame, but also concentrate the greatest part of the light. Thus the room is darkened, and only a small spot above and below the ap∣paratus is illumined; a practice highly inju∣dicious. The study lamps, with large round screens, seem to be purposely contrived to im∣pair the soundest eyes, by their continued use.—The green parchment screens formerly used were likewise objectionable; for, though they admitted the free access of light on both sides, yet they produced too great a shade before the eyes. The best and most proper defence of weak eyes by candle-light is a flat screen, projecting about two or three inches over the forehead; or even a round hat, with a brim of a proper size.</P>
<P>Those who are afflicted with weak eyes should always make use of two candles, placed so that their flame be neither too low, nor too high for the eye. This is a circumstance of great importance, as the light, when placed too low, is uncommonly stimulating and fa∣tiguing. Candles have this advantage over lamps, that their light is less offensive to the eye and less pernicious to the lungs; as they do not, in general, emit so much smoke. But, on the other hand, all candles have the follow∣ing disadvantages: 1. that, by their burn∣ing downwards, the fatigued eye is progres∣sively more strained in the later hours of can∣dle-light; 2. that the unequal light they give is attended with the additional trouble of snuffing them; and, 3. that by the least com∣motion of the air, or, if made of bad materials,
<PB N="283" REF="039111_0606_1013A40ED91AE140"/>
they offend the eye by their flaring light.—Hence a clear chamber-lamp, burning with the least possible smoke and smell, is far prefera∣ble and more soothing to the eye, than even wax-candles. Some of the lately-improved Patent-lamps, originally contrived by M. D' ARGENT, in Switzerland, are well calculated to answer every useful purpose; but, instead of the common round screens, I would re∣commend another, immediately to be de∣scribed.</P>
<P>Those <HI>screens</HI> are the best, which are appli∣ed to one side of the light only, which are not larger than is necessary to cover the flame, and which still admit a small quantity of light to pass through them. This is obtained by a simple contrivance of taffety, slightly gummed, and folded so that it can be carried about in the pocket. These little screens are very con∣venient in travelling, and are possessed of the essential advantage, that they overshade only the small angle formed for the individual who is affected with weak eyes, without depriving the rest of the company of light. In the day∣time, on the occasion of sealing letters, for instance, the light of a candle or taper is more prejudicial to the eye than in the evening.</P>
<P>In the morning we should not too much exert the eyes immediately after rising. Hence it is adviseable to remove the candle to some distance and under shade in the long winter mornings, till the eye be gradually accustom∣ed to it. For the same reason, the window-shutters ought not to be suddenly opened in very bright day-light. This immediate change,
<PB N="284" REF="039111_0607_1013A4105E0C7D58"/>
from darkness to the clearest light, occasions sensible pain even to the strongest eye.</P>
<P>Writing fatigues the eyes less than reading; for the letters we form on paper are pre∣viously imprinted on the imagination, and consequently require much less acuteness of sight, than the series of letters and words we read. It is, for the same reason, much easier to the eye to read our own hand-writing, than that of a stranger, however distinct. Besides, the letters and lines in writing are more distinguishable by the lower part of the blank paper, than the lines in a printed book, or on a manuscript; in both of which they appear to flow together, and can be kept asun∣der only by great exertion of the eye. The case is considerably changed, when we en∣deavour to write remarkably well; when we make use of a glossy white paper, and particu∣larly when we copy the writing of another person with great accuracy—in all which instances the sight is more impaired than in reading, especially by changing the direction of the eyes too frequently to papers, or books of different types.</P>
<P>The extravagant elegance in the letter-press of many modern books, the splendid whiteness and smoothness of vellum paper, or of hot-pressed woven paper, and the broad margin injudiciously contrasted with the printer's glossy ink, are ill calculated to preserve our eyes. And if the lines be too close to each other, the columns too long, as in our news∣papers, the ink too pale, as is now becoming fashionable, and the paper of a bluish cast—
<PB N="285" REF="039111_0608_1013A412EDD761D0"/>
the eyes are then in a fair way of being total∣ly blinded.</P>
<P>I read in the <HI>Gentleman's Magazine</HI> for April, 1794, a proposal, to print on dark blue paper with white letters, or on green pa∣per with yellow letters. This plan certain∣ly deserves a fair trial, though it might meet with great difficulties in the execution.—The eyes would also be greatly preserved, by mak∣ing use of a fine light blue writing-paper, rather of a greenish tint, instead of the fash∣ionable white or cream-coloured paper.</P>
<P>Every exertion of the eyes is most hurtful immediately after a meal, as well as at any time when the blood is in great agitation.—In the dawn, in twilight, and in moonshine, we ought not to read or write, nor direct our sight too attentively to objects.</P>
<P><HI>Refracted rays</HI> afford an unpleasant light, and oblique rays are particularly painful. When we take exercise in a long, irregularly-lighted apartment; we feel sensible vibrations in the pupil of the eye. The most suitable apartment, in this respect, is one forming a regular square, with large windows to the east, in which there is an uniformly-divided light, or still better by means of sky-lights. Garret windows afford a bad light; it being general∣ly introduced, as it were, by a funnel, and il∣lumining only one part of the room, while the rest remains dark.</P>
<P>A sitting-room is best adapted to preserve the eyes, the walls of which are pale green, without paintings; two or three uniformly high windows, so as to give an equal light; (yet so contrived as to prevent its being too
<PB N="286" REF="039111_0609_1013A4148965F9B0"/>
strong) close and moveable green blinds; a green carpet on the floor; and, lastly, such shutters as may occasionally leave the upper part of the window uncovered, in order to admit sufficient light—To sit with the back to the window, occasions a shade which forms a disagreeable contrast to the surrounding light. The writing-desk, therefore, ought to be placed so, that the last window may be on the left hand, and that the right hand may throw no shade on the paper, and not too near a corner of the room, as this generally has an unfavour∣able light. A space sufficiently broad, between two windows, is a still more convenient situa∣tion for a desk; but we should not sit too near the wall; a custom which is excessively hurtful to the eyes.</P>
<P>An oblique position of the desk is the most proper; for it presents to us the writing ma∣terials in that position, in which we are habit∣uated to place a book, when we hold it in our hands, and from which the rays of light di∣verge more gradually than from a horizontal table. It is less hurtful to the breast, to the abdomen, and also to the eyes, to use a desk of this form, and to write standing rather than sitting; provided that the height of the desk be proportionate to the length of the body, that it stand firm, and that both arms rest upon it, without being fatigued by raising them too high—In <HI>standing</HI> before a desk, we have this additional advantage, that there is less occasion to direct the eyes upwards, than in sitting. Hence the conversation between tall persons and those of a low stature is most
<PB N="287" REF="039111_0610_1013A417171B63D8"/>
troublesome to the latter, as they are constant∣ly obliged to look upwards.—Those with whom we converse ought not to stand between our body and the light, as it is both rude, and prejudicial to our eyes.</P>
<P>At night we ought to place the candle so that we may receive light from it in the same direction as we do from the window in the day-time. Even if it be provided with a green screen, as before described, a weak eye will not long be able to support its glare in a straight line. Were the candle to be elevated at our back, so as to allow the light to come down over our shoulders, we should then ex∣perience the same inconvenience, which at∣tends that posture in day-light. Hence it is necessary to place it sideways, and to keep the book or paper in a lateral direction.</P>
<P>We should not expose ourselves in a straight direction to objects strongly illumined by the flame of a candle, or fire from a grate. Thus the highly-polished senders and other fire-irons are injurious to sight; and not less so is a smooth and shining wax-cloth over a table, as refracting too much the rays of light: a green cloth is preferable. In all cases, the light should at least be of equal height with the fore∣head; not close to a white wall, and still less before a looking-glass or other polished body. To walk up and down a room lighted with a single candle, so that at one time we have the light full in our eye, and at another are nearly in darkness, is very prejudicial to weak eyes. It is better to place the candle in the middle of the room, in order to illumine it more uni∣formly,
<PB N="288" REF="039111_0611_1013A41ACD82A228"/>
or, what is still preferable, to hang it higher than the shade of our own body.</P>
<P>Where persons must have a light during the night, it ought to be placed in the next room, or at least within the chimney, that it may be entirely out of sight. If neither of these methods be convenient, we should place it be∣hind or at the side of the bed, rather than in an opposite direction. For, if this be not at∣tended to, the light may produce very noxious effects during sleep, even through the closed eye-lids. The same attention is required, to prevent the rays of the sun or moon, either directly or by reflection from the opposite wall, from striking the eyes of the person asleep.—As some men are known to sleep with their eyes open, it would be advisable to employ somebody to shut them, that they may not suffer by the accidents before mentioned.</P>
<P>Those who have weak eyes should carefully avoid strong fires and even hot rooms; for heat still more dries the eyes already suffering from want of moisture. Indeed, it is highly probable, that the weakness of sight and early blindness, so common in this country, are in a great measure owing to the bad custom of hastening to the fire-side, whether coming from the cold air, or from the dark streets.</P>
<P>Weak eyes must be indulged with shady places, and protected against every dazzling object. But green arbours should be avoided, on account of the twinkling light occasioned by the agitation of the leaves. The exercise of the eyes ought never to be suspended for any considerable length of time: too much rest
<PB N="289" REF="039111_0612_1013A41E6359DDA0"/>
is hurtful; and to sit whole hours of the eve∣ning without candle-light, is extremely perni∣cious. It is, however, very soothing to the eyes, to let them rest for half an hour during twilight. This should teach us to adopt the general and salutary rule, to rise with the dawn, and gradually to accustom ourselves to the artificial light of the evening. For a sim∣ilar reason, those who complain of weakness of sight, ought not to resort to places artificial∣ly lighted in the day-time, such as theatres, &amp;c. Even the soundest eyes must inevitably suffer by a sudden change from light to darkness, or from darkness to strong light.</P>
<P>If it become necessary to let the eyes rest, we should by no means press the eye-lids too closely together, which if long continued, is very hurtful. So is strong and frequent fric∣tion, which powerfully stimulates the nerves and injures the eyes. If we sit for any length of time with closed eyes, we are easily overta∣ken by sleep, which, though beneficial, ought to be of short duration, that the eyes may not be overheated. As a protection against inju∣ry from external causes, it is most useful to wear a shade at such a distance, as may allow the ey<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> free motion, and not keep it too warm. The green veils worn by ladies are, in this res∣pect, well calculated to prevent the dust from entering the eye, as well as to protect it against cold winds, and the burning rays of the sun.</P>
<P>The common eye-cases, used by travellers, and by artificers who work in substances a∣bounding with dust, are, for the following rea∣sons,
<PB N="290" REF="039111_0613_1013A41FEDF83810"/>
improper: 1. the glass in the case stands too prominent, and diminishes the horizon; hence, as those who wear them cannot see sideways and downward, but only straight for∣ward, they travel unsafely on an uneven road; 2. the glass in these cases being easily covered with vapour, both from internal perspiration and external cold, prevents distinct vision. These eye-cases might be much improved by making the brim somewhat narrower, and substituting a fine silken gauze, or rather a thin plate of ivory, dyed green, with a small horizontal incision, in preference to glass.</P>
<P>All glasses used to assist vision appear to re∣quire some effort of the eyes, and, unless they be indispensable, they should never be employ∣ed by persons at an early time of life. In proof of this assertion, I shall only remark, that by looking through a window of the finest glass, we feel our eyes much more fatigued, than if the window had been open. This is particu∣larly the case in locking through coach-win∣dows, where additional injury is occasioned to the eyes, by the motion of the carriage, and the impure air arising from respiration. Green curtains in coaches are, therefore, judicious and proper.</P>
<P>Of all the remedies for preserving weak eyes (for diseased eyes require professional assist∣ance,) bathing them in pure cold water is the most refreshing and strengthening. But this ought not to be done above three or four times a day; otherwise it has a tendency to give an unnecessary stimulus to the eyes. Nor should it be done immediately after rising in the morn¦ing,
<PB N="291" REF="039111_0614_1013A4228715EB48"/>
but only when the moisture, which dur∣ing sleep is deposited even in the soundest eyes, is nearly evaporated. This partial cold bath may be repeated after dinner and supper, at which times the eyes stand as much in need of it as in the morning. Not only the eyes, but also the brow, the region behind the ears, sometimes the whole head, and particularly the upper lip, which is closely connected with the optic nerves, should be bathed or washed as well as the eyes. In the morning, the eye ought not to be precipitately, but gradually exposed to the water: and the washing should be expeditiously performed. In drying or wiping the eye, we should proceed gently and with caution; and immediately after washing, we should particularly guard against any rays of light, as well as every kind of exertion.</P>
<P>A large piece of sponge, containing a good deal of water, so that it may not too soon be∣come warm, is far preferable in these partial bathings, to the warm, smooth hand, or towel. The sponge should be frequently dipped into cold water, and occasionally allowed to lie for a few moments on the eye, with the head bent backward while the eye is generally moved and a little opened during the operation.</P>
<P>The bathing of the eyes, in small glasses, is less advantageous, as the water very soon turns luke-warm, and is perhaps too cold, when sud∣denly renewed. These glasses occasion an∣other disagreeable sensation, as their edges will, in some degree, attach themselves to the skin, not unlike cupping-glasses.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="039111_0615_1013A42524398388"/>
The cold bath, under certain restrictions, is useful; as it invigorates the whole body, and consequently strengthens the eyes; but in some cases it may injure them, by propelling the blood too forcibly to the head. This may, in a great measure, be prevented by not only washing the eyes and the whole head previ∣ously to entering the bath, but also by diving the whole face and head under water.</P>

<HEAD>V. Dietetical Precepts respecting the Eyes in general.</HEAD>
<P>ABOVE all things, we must observe the old rule; to try carefully what best agrees with us, and to attend to moderation and regular∣ity in our manner of living.</P>
<P>Smoking tobacco, and taking snuff, are in∣jurious; as by either practice the eye is too much stimulated. It is a vulgar error, that people cannot resign these improper habits, without injury to their health. They may be safely abandoned at once, though occasionally prescribed as medicines.—Tobacco<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The tobacco▪plant was first discovered growing wild in South-America; in the year 1496 it was also found in Saint Domingo; in 1520 in Jucatan; from which last place the first seeds were brought over to Portugal in 1560, by the French Ambassador <HI>Nicot,</HI> who gave it its present name from the Island of <HI>Tobago,</HI> where it grew in great abundance. Hence <HI>Linnaeus</HI> calls it by the compound name of <HI>Nicotiana T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um.</HI></NOTE> has only been known in Europe since the beginning of the seventeenth century, and was long merely
<PB N="293" REF="039111_0616_1013A42B62D59658"/>
used as a luxury. This plant is now much abused; and those who are once accustomed to it, cannot leave it off without great resolu∣tion. To such persons it does not afford relief as a medicine; their olfactory nerves having become almost insensible to its stimulus. As a medicinal remedy, it serves to draw superflu∣ous humours from the head; but in those who use it extravagantly, especially in snuff, it imperceptibly weakens the nervous system, and especially the memory.</P>
<P>After meals, and the above-stated bathings, it is beneficial to the eyes to remain in the open air, to direct our looks to a grass-plat, or to divert them with some amusing employ∣ment.—Some have observed, that their eyes are not so strong after they have eaten weak soups or broths, as after solid food: they further affirm, that their sight is stronger after a meal consisting entirely of vegetable aliment, than after a very moderate portion of animal food. These observations are far from being unimportant, and, if fully confirmed by ex∣perience, they may throw some light on the dietetical treatment of the eyes—a branch of medicine that has hitherto been too much neg∣lected.</P>
<P>A short sleep after dinner can only be bene∣ficial to the eyes of those, with whom this practice does not disagree; at all events, the eyes ought to be protected from day-light, which would hurt them more than they can be refreshed by a short slumber.—The particu∣lar rules respecting this practice, I have stated
<PB N="294" REF="039111_0617_1013A42B62D59658"/>
in the Seventh Chapter.—The steam of boiled coffee, gently applied, has also been recom∣mended after dinner to persons afflicted with weak eyes; but nothing has a more salutary tendency, in this respect, than to go to bed at an early hour; for most people impair their sight by heavy suppers and heating liquors, so that their eyes remain inflamed till next day. The same, indeed, is also the case with those who indulge too much in sleep.</P>
<P>A pure, serene air is an essential requisite to the preservation of the eyes. Fetid exhalations sometimes instantaneously affect the eye; hence we should avoid the putrid effluvia from marshes and ditches, or other places in which the air is filled with noxious vapours; for instance, the vicinity of colour-shops, hartshorn-distil∣leries, and the like. It is, perhaps, unneces∣sary to point out every species of mephitic va∣pours to be shunned as the enemies of sight; yet it deserves to be remarked, that the exha∣lations of stables are injurious, while the stalls, and other places where cattle are kept, are far less hurtful. Lastly, the galleries of churches, as well as the higher boxes and galleries of playhouses, are most pernicious places; for the exhalations, ascending from a great num∣ber of people assembled below, are extremely detrimental to sight.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the frequent enjoyment of a pure and fresh air, the occasional resort to elevated situations, nay, even the exposure to a moderate wind, are means of improvement. The more vigorous species of bodily exercise also, are in a certain degree useful; provided
<PB N="295" REF="039111_0618_1013A42CE7880E60"/>
we do not exert the eye by reading, writing, &amp;c. before the circulating fluids are reduced to their proper medium.—The application of electricity, which has benefited many weak eyes, by its fluid being conducted through a wooden point, is somewhat analogous to the going and standing against the wind; as it probably operates more by the gentle vibrations of the air, than by the communication of the electric fluid itself.</P>
<P>To read in the open air is hurtful to sound, and still more to weak eyes, unless the light of a clear day be modified at least by the foliage of a tree from above; yet even here the vivid light surrounding the book is fatiguing.</P>
<P>The greater or less interest we take in our employments, is of considerable importance to the organs of sight; particularly if they be in a weak state. The more alluring a book or any other amusement is, the longer we are in∣duced to continue it. Hence the important rule: to reserve the most interesting labours for the half-wearied eyes; yet, with prudent severity, always to appoint a task; for, with∣out this precaution, the sight, though at a later period, will inevitably experience more or less injury from such practices.</P>
<P>The state of the weather has great influence on the power of vision; hence persons troubled with weak eyes should not be alarmed, if in a tempest or thunder-storm, in rainy, or foggy weather, their sight be less acute, or even much impaired.—Such individuals are easily affected by standing too long on cold or damp ground, by a too light dress, and particularly by a too thin covering of the legs and feet.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="039111_0619_1013A42F76D25510"/>
Riding on horseback is beneficial to weak eyes, as is also walking and riding in carriages. The principal advantage in all these exercises is, perhaps, derived from employing the eye with a great variety of objects, none of which occupies the attention too long.</P>
<P>Lastly, persons having black eye-lashes gen∣erally possess greater powers of vision, than those whose eye-lashes are of a light colour; be∣cause the former are a better screen for the eye, and reflect no light from their outside, by which the image on the retina would be ren∣dered weaker and more indistinct.</P>
<P>MONTALDUS gives an account of a person whose eye-lids and eye-lashes were completely white; who consequently saw but indifferent∣ly in the day-time, but much better in the evening and at night. This man happened to be taken prisoner by the Moors, who dyed his eye-lids black, by which his sight was much improved: but, as soon as the colour was lost, his vision also became weaker.</P>
<P>Dr. RUSSELL mentions, in his "<HI>History of Aleppo,</HI>" that the Turkish ladies usually dye the inner side of their eye-lids black, not so much for the sake of ornament, as with a view to strengthen their sight.—It has farther been observed, that when we lose the eye-lash∣es, as is often the case in the small-pox, the sense of vision is thereby considerably weaken∣ed. For a similar reason, the hair combed down the forehead, if of a dark colour, will assist the sight, as well as any other contriv∣ance over the brow.</P>

<HEAD>VI. Some additional Rules, addressed to those who are obliged to make use of Eye-glasses.</HEAD>
<P>THE cases in which eye-glasses may be used with advantage, are nearly the following: 1. when we are obliged to hold small objects at a considerable distance, before we can distin∣guish them: 2. when, in order to discern ob∣jects, we require more light than usual; for instance, when we are obliged to place a can∣dle between the eye and the object; for this is one of the most destructive practices, by which the optic nerves and muscles are much injured;—and, as the eye employs itself with the object in proportion to the degree of light reflected upon it, the pupil ought to dilate accordingly; instead of which, it is forced to contract, on account of the too powerful light produced by the intermediate candle: 3. when a near object, upon accurate and attentive ex∣amination, becomes obscure, and begins to appear covered, as it were, with a mist or fog: 4. when, in reading or writing, the letters seem to flow into one another, and look as if they were double or treble: 5. when the eyes are easily fatigued, and we are obliged from time to time to shut them, or to direct them to fresh objects, for temporary relief.</P>
<P>In the choice of spectacles we need not at∣tend so much to their magnifying power, as to the circumstance of their agreeing with our sight; that is, when they enable us, clearly and without exertion, to see at the same dis∣tance, in which we formerly were accustom∣ed to read or work. Hence we ought out of
<PB N="298" REF="039111_0621_1013A43288DA7EA8"/>
a number of glasses to choose those, which afford the best and clearest light in every state of the eye. But, if a person be short-sighted, he should choose a second glass, magnifying a little more than the other, but somewhat less distinct, yet so that it may not obscure the ob∣ject. This is unpleasant at first, but the eyes in time become accustomed to it, and daily im∣prove. If, after some time, we make use of less concave glasses, there is no doubt, that in the course of a few years, according to partic∣ular circumstances, the defect of short-sight∣edness may be gradually removed.</P>
<P>He who observes this regular gradation with his spectacles, may preserve his eyes to the latest period of life. But we should not make these changes too suddenly, lest the aid of art be too soon exhausted, and the wearer of glasses perhaps be unable to find any of sufficient magnifying powers. It is farther a hurtful practice, to use any other but our own glasses, to which the eye has been accustomed;—every irregularity is injurious, and the pres∣ervation of the eyes depends chiefly on uni∣formity, with respect to glasses as well as to the light, in which the organs of sight are exercised.</P>
<P>In using one glass only, people accustom themselves to neglect one of the eyes; and, on this account, spectacles are preferable. Yet both glasses must be separately fitted to each eye, and by no means indiscriminately used; for this would increase the disease.—If, how∣ever we make use of one glass only, each of the eyes ought alternately to be habituated to it.</P>
<P>Many persons wear glasses in the evening, and can dispense with them in day-light. This
<PB N="299" REF="039111_0622_1013A4396796B078"/>
is rather an imprudent practice; and, if it be not too late, they should choose a second pair of glasses, somewhat more magnifying, and to be used by candle-light only. In this man∣ner, the retina would receive an equal propor∣tion of light, at one time as well as another, and the eye longer preserve its vigour.</P>
<P><HI>Green glasses</HI> are said to be most suitable to the eye, since they modify the impression of light on the retina. Though this be in a great measure true, they cannot be indiscriminately recommended, and certainly not to such as have weak eyes. Green is indeed pleasing to the eye, more than any other colour, but, at the same time, it somewhat obscures objects, especially at first. Those of a vigorous sight only should make use of them as preservatives, especially against the fire or candle-light. But, if white or light-coloured objects appear red, after having used green glasses for a short time, we should discontinue their use; as this phe∣nomenon is a certain proof, that they will in the end destroy the eyes. If the green colour does not in two or three days become imper∣ceptible, but appears constantly upon the pa∣per as it did at first, it is a farther criterion that the use of them is improper.</P>
<P>Many give the preference to large reading-glasses; in order to avoid wearing spectacles. It is however obvious, that it must be a per∣nicious practice, to keep the eyes in constant exertion, as is the case here, where every mo∣tion of the hand and the head necessarily al∣ters the distance. In addition to this inconve∣nience, the dazzling splendour of the rays, reflected from the surface of the glass, weak∣ens
<PB N="300" REF="039111_0623_1013A43AECDF4630"/>
the eye to such a degree, as to render the use of spectacles ultimately indispensable, with this only difference, that the eyes require greater magnifying powers, than might have been necessary without this depravation.</P>
<P>Hence spectacles are in every respect pref∣erable, as they are not only more conformable to the nature and mechanism of the eye, but also more convenient: they are uniformly placed before the objects by the imperceptible motion of the head; they leave the space be∣tween the object and the eyes open and free; and being generally thinner, and lying at an uniform distance before the eye, they present the objects more clearly and distinctly than reading-glasses.</P>
<P>Those who have weak eyes, ought not to employ themselves, even occasionally, in a manner that may be fatiguing to the sight. Particularly hurtful are those occupations, in which one eye only is exerted, and must con∣sequently be placed in positions, different from those of the other eye, which is at rest. For this reason, the use of magnifying glasses, of whatever kind, is more pernicious to weak eyes, if we always use the same eye and pur∣posely shut the other, than if we alternately make use of either. On this account, micro∣scopical investigations are less hurtful, if, while one eye be employed, we can keep the other open.</P>
<P>We should not make too frequent trials to discover, whether we have improved in sight, or not; for the exertion necessary upon these occasions, is uncommonly stimulating and fatiguing</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="039111_0624_1013A43C8C4CBA38"/>
Spectacles ought to be used only for the pur∣poses for which they are designed; namely, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> such employments as require the assistance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> art, and where the eye is always kept at an equal distance; for instance, in reading or writing. We should not without a full trial make choice of a pair of glasses, nor be satis∣fied with those which, at first, exhibit the ob∣jects clearly and distinctly. For objects will not always be at the same distance before us as they appear at the first experiment. It would be proper to try a pair of glasses for a short time, especially by candle-light; to use them in that posture of the body to which we are accustomed; and, if with the usual kind of labour, we do not feel our eyes fatigued, but rather somewhat relieved, we then ought to adopt these glasses. But, as it is almost impossible to meet with a pair of glasses in the shops, which fit both eyes, there is nothing more absurd, than to purchase spectacles ready made. Certain as it is, it may not be gener∣ally known, that there is perhaps not one per∣son among thousands, whose eyes are both of an equal size and constitution. For this rea∣son, different eyes should be accommodated with different glasses; and, if we consult our interest in an affair of such consequence, we shall be cautious in selecting for each eye a proper glass. The following advice is sub∣mitted to those who have no optician at hand:</P>
<P>Short sighted persons, who wish for a prop∣er concave or magnifying glass, may take the exact focus, or point of vision, by presenting the smallest print very close to the eye, and
<PB N="302" REF="039111_0625_1013A43E10A75228"/>
gradually removing it, as far as they can read the letters distinctly, and without much ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>on. When they have accurately ascer∣tained the focus, after frequent trials, let them employ another person to take the measure of this distance, with a slip of paper, in the ni∣cest possible manner. An optician, on re∣ceiving this measure, and being informed at what distance the glasses are intended to be used, will be able to judge, in a certain degree, although by no means so accurately as by a per∣sonal conference with the short-sighted person.</P>
<P>Such as observe their eyes to be inclined to far-sightedness, may proceed exactly in a sim∣ilar manner. But all eye-glasses ought to be furnished with double joints or springs; as those with single joints are not only inconve∣nient on the nose, but what is worse, they are apt to shift the point of vision with every motion of the head, and consequently injure the eyes.</P>
<P>Lastly, in such occupations as require a more or less extended view of the objects, for instance, in playing at cards, where the dis∣tance of the objects must be frequently varied, it would be extremely injudicious to use spec∣tacles; as no eye whatever can bear such ex∣ertions, without uncommon fatigue. For a similar reason, it is hurtful to these important organs, to keep the spectacles on the head at close work, when by some accident we are obliged to search for something dropt, or mis∣laid. Thus we force the eye to make uncom∣mon efforts, in seeing farther than it is ena∣bled to do, by the construction of the specta∣cles. I need not observe, that many good eyes are spoiled by such imprudent practices.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>THE preceding Chapters contain the prin∣cipal outlines, relative to the treatment of the human body in a healthy state, so far as the limits of this work would admit, without transgressing too much on the indulgence of the reader.</P>
<P>I shall conclude with a few general reflec∣tions, and recapitulate, in a concise manner, several useful precepts, which have been more fully laid down in former parts of this work.</P>
<P><HI>Moderation,</HI> in every respect ought to be the first and leading maxim of those who wish to live long and enjoy health. Extremes, in the most opposite things, frequently border on each other. The greatest joy may occasion the most acute pain; and, on the contrary, moderate pain is often accompanied with feel∣ings not altogether disagreeable. The highest animal gratification, indeed, is closely con∣nected with disgust, and it is difficult to avoid the latter, after the enjoyment of the former. Hence prudence enjoins us to restrain violent sensations and affections, before they have at∣tained the highest degree.</P>
<P>The illustrious MEAD, in his "Medical Precepts and Cautions," originally written in Latin, when treating of the affections of the mind, makes the following remarks, the truth of which has induced me to insert them:</P>
<P>"All mankind," says that medical philoso∣pher, "have a natural desire for the enjoy∣ment
<PB N="304" REF="039111_0627_10136E4FE5AC1E88"/>
of pleasures, which are of two different kinds, namely, the sensual and mental.—The former engross the greatest part of men, while those few only "whom kind Jove has be∣friended," are captivated with the charms of intellectual pleasure. The reason why so great a proportion of thinking beings indulge in sensuality is obvious: it proceeds from be∣ing unacquainted with the serenity of mind re∣sulting from a dignified conduct, and the joy that animates a good man, when his reason presides over his passions. But the sensualist, being devoted to grovelling enjoyments, is in∣capable of relishing the real charms of Virtue, and the superior beauties of Nature. The man who wishes to enjoy true happiness should habituate his mind to cherish Virtue, and care∣fully avoid the opportunities which excite and inflame the passions.</P>
<P>"CICERO illustrates this by a sentiment of CATO, which he received from the great ARCHYTAS, of Tarentum;—"that Nature never afflicted mankind with a more destruc∣tive disease than the pursuit of bodily pleasure, which stimulates to enjoyment with ungovern∣able rashness."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>De Senectute,</HI> cap. xii.</NOTE> Indeed, the perusal of that great philosopher's writings, on this subject, must delight the mind of every rational man: and Virtue's exclamation, in SILIUS ITALI∣CUS, is equally just and impressive:—
<Q><L>Pleasure, by gliding on the minds of men,</L>
<L>More mischiefs hast thou wrought than hostile arms,</L>
<L>Than all the wrath of Gods!"</L>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Punicorum,</HI> lib. xv. v. 94.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>"As the rational subjugation of the passions strengthens the mind, so <HI>temperance in diet</HI>
<PB N="305" REF="039111_0628_1013A44714CAF7B0"/>
renders the body less subject to these turbulent emotions. And this observation is applicable not only to individuals who are naturally of a hot constitution, but even to those who con∣trol their appetites; because moderation is a great means of tranquillising the mind."</P>
<P><HI>Cleanliness</HI> is a principal duty of man, and an unclean or filthy person is never completely healthy. It is better to wash ourselves ten times a day, than to allow one dirty spot to remain on the skin. On a place where impu∣rities are suffered to clog the pores, not only insensible perspiration, but likewise the absorp∣tion by the skin is entirely suppressed; and if the whole body be, as it were, covered with a varnish formed of perspirable matter, it is im∣possible that a person in such a state can possess sound blood, or enjoy good health.</P>
<P>Many diseases originate from an impure <HI>at∣mosphere,</HI> but a still greater number from the sudden changes of the temperature of the <HI>air.</HI> Hence the necessity of exposing ourselves daily to such changes, and of renewing the air in the house and apartments we inhabit, by open∣ing the doors and windows every clear morn∣ing, or during the day, as often as convenient. Indeed, to encounter cold weather, however intense, has the effect of bracing the fibres of the system in general, and is attended with danger only, when we suddenly remove to a warmer temperature. For this reason, it is extremely injudicious, and a bad compliment paid to a visitor, to invite him to the fire-side, upon his first entering a house; we should bet∣ter consult his health, by conducting him to a
<PB N="306" REF="039111_0629_1013A449ADEDACD8"/>
cold room, or to some distance from the fire, till the temperature of his body be more equal to that of the apartment.</P>
<P>Every thing calculated to remove or cure diseases may also produce them; for, whatev∣er has a tendency to accomplish useful changes in the body, may, under different and op∣posite circumstances, be attended with the con∣trary effect. Hence no <HI>medicine</HI> whatever ought to be used as daily food—a favourite practice among invalids, valetudinarians, and the votaries in quack medicines.</P>
<P>Feeble individuals ought to eat frequently, and but little at a time: the number of meals should correspond with the want of strength;—for it is less hurtful to a debilitated person to eat a few mouthfuls every hour, than to make two or three hearty meals in one day; yet this observation is liable to exceptions, re∣specting those persons who have naturally weak stomachs.</P>
<P>There is no instance on record of any person having injured his health, or endangered his life, by <HI>drinking water</HI> with his meals; but wine, beer, and spirits have produced a much greater number and diversity of patients, than would fill all the hospitals in the world. Such are the effects of intemperance in diet, par∣ticularly in the use of drink; for neither beer, wine, nor spirits, are of themselves detrimental, is used with moderation, and in a proper habit of body.</P>
<P>It is a vulgar prejudice, that water disagrees with many constitutions, and does not promote digestion so well as wine, beer, or spirits: on the contrary, <HI>pure water</HI> is preferable to all
<PB N="307" REF="039111_0630_1013A44C424EAAF0"/>
brewed and distilled liquors, both for bracing the digestive organ, and preventing complaints which arise from acrimony, and fulness of the blood.</P>
<P>It is an observation not less important than true, that by attending merely to a <HI>proper diet,</HI> a phlegmatic habit may frequently be changed into a sanguine one, and the hypochondriac may be so far altered, as to become a cheerful and contented member of society.</P>
<P>The duration of <HI>work</HI> or <HI>exercise</HI> cannot be easily ascertained, with regard to every indi∣vidual. Generally speaking, we ought to work only when we feel a natural inclination to ei∣ther literary or mechanical labours. To force ourselves to any exertions, particularly those of the mind, is productive of imperfect per∣formances.—It is better to exercise the mind in fine than in bad weather; but those who are continually making excursions in the for∣mer, cannot usefully employ themselves in the latter.</P>
<P>Of the twenty-four hours of a day, we ought, in a good state of health, to devote upon an average twelve hours to useful occu∣pations, six to meals, amusements, or recrea∣tions, and six to sleep. This would be at once a natural and arithmetical proportion. It is, however, to be regretted that the hours cannot be thus accurately divided.—An in∣dustrious person frequently counts but twenty-three hours in a day; as one and sometimes even two hours slide away imperceptibly.</P>
<P>"Sleep," says Dr. MEAD, in the sequel of the work abovementioned, "is the sweet

soother of cares and restorer of muscular en∣ergy, which is wasted by bodily and mental exertions during the day. But excessive sleep has its inconveniences; for it blunts the senses, stupifies the mental faculties, and renders both less fit for performing the duties of active life. The proper time for sleep is the night, when darkness and silence invite and cherish it; but sleep during the day is less refreshing. The observance of this rule, if proper for the mul∣titude, is still more necessary for persons devot∣ed to literary pursuits, whose bodies and minds are more susceptible of injuries."</P>
<P>The modern inventions for promoting lux∣ury and effeminacy are really surprising. It were to be wished, that the ingenious contri∣vers could be persuaded, that their pernicious arts resemble those of the Quacks, whose poi∣sonous productions gradually, though ulti∣mately consume the vital spirits of their vic∣tims.—Every new expedient we use, with a design to diminish the labour of man, and en∣courage indolence, is an additional proof that our age is not in a state of improvement, but rather on the decline. Wretched is the man who requires the aid of Art, more than of Nature, to prolong his life, and to support so precarious an existence!—Conveniency leads to effeminacy; effeminacy to general relaxa∣tion; and this is eventually attended with total enervation and imbecility.</P>
<P>"Although pleasure, riches, power, and other things (concludes the author before quoted), which are called the gifts of Fortune, seem to be dealt out to mankind with too

much partiality, yet there is a greater degree of equality of those things which constitute real happiness, than is generally imagined. People in the lower ranks enjoy the common advantages of existence more intensely than those in the higher walks of life. Wholesome food is acquired by moderate labour, which improves the appetite and digestion: hence sound sleep, uninterrupted by corroding cares, refreshes the wearied limbs; a healthy progeny fills the cottage; and the sons perform their father's labour, making his hoary locks sit comfortably on him. How vastly inferior to these blessings are the delicacies of the affluent, which are ever accompanied with real evils. Their appetites, in order to relish their food, must be stimulated by poignant sauces, which heat and vitiate the blood, and render the body liable to distempers. Their excesses dis∣turb their repose; and as a punishment for their vices, their sons, who ought to be the ornament and support of their families, con∣tract diseases from their mother's womb, and are afflicted with infirmities through the course of a languid life, which seldom reaches to old age. They are frequently tortured with anx∣ieties for obtaining honours and titles, inso∣much that they lose the advantages of their possessions, by the vain desire of new acquisi∣tions:

supplying the body with superabundant nour∣ishment, the faculties of the soul are stupified, and the passions inflamed; while the sparing and homely diet of the laborious poor neither oppresses the bodily functions, nor fosters a propensity to vice. Hence, unless prudence be a constant attendant on opulence, it is, in these respects, better and more conducive to the preservation of health and prolongation of life, to live on a small fortune.</P>

<P>"Whoever investigates the imperfections of human nature will find, that as some men are vastly superior to others in the endowments of the mind, yet, mournful reflection! even the best minds are blended with some degree of de∣pravity; so the healthiest bodies are often af∣flicted with diseases; and these, being the seeds of death, ought to remind us of the shortness of this life, and that, in the words of LU∣CRETIUS,

<P>A LUXURIOUS life, and dissolute manners, not only impoverish a people, but ultimately depopulate the country itself. Such mischiev∣ous consequences can be averted only by laws wisely enacted, duly administered, and expe∣rimentally adapted to the natural capacity and disposition of a people: for, if their artificial propensities and desires be not controlled in time, and directed to useful ends, the citizen must degenerate into a feeble and irresolute slave, and his progeny will gradually wither away, like a plant in a foreign soil.—Thus Rome was subdued, when she departed from her ancient simplicity of manners, when she adopted foreign and effeminating refinements, and when her feasts and public amusements became too frequent.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been frequently and justly remarked, that popular books on medical subjects are generally deficient in their practical applica∣tion; insomuch that they leave the reader doubtful, <HI>whether</HI> and <HI>when</HI> he is to apply for professional advice. As my design, in these Lectures, has not been to lay down particular rules for the distinction and treatment of dis∣eases, but rather for their prevention, and consequently for the preservation of health, I think it my duty to remark here, that a work seems to be wanting, which should impart in∣struction to general readers, how to distinguish diseases, and how to treat them by a due and strict attention to diet and regimen, as well as to regulate the habits, peculiarities, tempera∣ment, and, in short, the whole state of the patient's mind and body:—such a work being a desideratum of the present age.</P>
<P>When I began the revisal of these Lectures, for the second edition, I had it in contempla∣tion to give the outlines of a treatise correspond∣ing with this description: but being confined within the limits of a single volume, and con∣scious that a mere sketch of so extensive and important a work could be of little if any <HI>prac∣tical</HI> benefit, I have purposely delayed the pub∣lication
<PB N="313" REF="039111_0636_1013A459625D2268"/>
of the whole to another year, when a separate volume shall conclude my dietetical labours.</P>
<P>Having treated, in the present volumes of almost every subject that relates to the man∣agement of the human body, in its <HI>healthy</HI> state, my next work shall be entirely appropriated to its treatment in a <HI>diseased</HI> state.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Editor has for some time expected this second volume, with a view to propose it to the public as soon as it is received.</NOTE> It shall com∣prehend an accurate and clear description of Diseases, together with a plan founded on the rules of experience, how to treat and eventu∣ally to cure them, especially those of a chronic nature. The administration of medicine ought, in such a work, to be only a secondary mean of removing disease, as it will be admitted by the most enlightened and candid of the Pro∣fession, that, by strictly medical remedies, we can cure <HI>symptoms,</HI> and afford occasional alle∣viation of pain; but that we cannot effect a favourable change in the nature and progress of a disease, whether chronic or acute, with∣out due attention to food, drink, air, sleep, exercise, or rest, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Hence I hope to be exempt from the charge of presumption, when I venture into a larger field of inquiry than has hitherto been explored by practitioners; for, as novelty is not my object, though I think that too little has been done by professional men, in guid∣ing the unhappy sufferer, and assisting him with those simple remedies which are placed more immediately around him, I shall enter upon
<PB N="314" REF="039111_0637_1013A45D14C92AC0"/>
my proposed work with the confidence arising from the importance and utility of the under∣taking in which I am engaged.</P>
<P>It is much to be regretted, that the boun∣daries between safety and danger cannot be perspicuously ascertained in a popular book, without deviating from the usual terms and definitions adopted by medical writers: but I shall not hesitate to avail myself of such famil∣iar phrases and expressions as will render my works intelligible to the generality of readers. To afford a short specimen of this deviation, for which I allege the respectable authority of the late Dr. TISSOT, I have subjoined a few Queries, which ought to be distinctly answered by individuals who consult a physician, whether personally or by letter. Indeed, it is not al∣ways an easy or practicable task to form an ac∣curate judgment of the state of a patient, with∣out an interview, let his case be ever so accu∣rately and circumstantially described: yet most of the difficulties will be removed, if the fol∣lowing questions be answered with candour and precision. For, as the success of the medicine entirely depends on a previous knowledge of the disease, this knowledge can, in such cases be derived only from a clear and faithful ac∣count communicated to the physician.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="questions">
<HEAD>General Questions.</HEAD>
<P>Of what age is the patient?</P>
<P>Had he previously enjoyed perfect health?</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="039111_0638_1013A45E9F6F8028"/>
In what manner has he lived—frugally or luxuriously?</P>
<P>How long has he been ill?</P>
<P>How did the disease commence?</P>
<P>Is he disposed to be feverish?</P>
<P>Does the pulse beat strongly or weakly?</P>
<P>Has the patient still muscular strength, or is he much debilitated?</P>
<P>Does he remain the whole day in bed, or alternately walk about?</P>
<P>Is his state the same at all hours of the day?</P>
<P>Is he uneasy or quiet?</P>
<P>Is he troubled with heats or shiverings?</P>
<P>Is he afflicted with pains in the head, throat, breast, stomach, abdomen, thighs, or the ex∣tremities?</P>
<P>Is his tongue dry, accompanied with thirst; disagreeable taste in the mouth; nausea; and has he an aversion to, or appetite for food?</P>
<P>Has he any stools, and how often?</P>
<P>Of what appearance and consistence are the excrements?</P>
<P>Does he evacuate urine freely and copiously?</P>
<P>Of what colour and consistence is the urine—is there any sediment in it?</P>
<P>Is he troubled with night-sweats?</P>
<P>Does his skin feel soft and pliable, or dry and parched?</P>
<P>Is there any expectoration, and what?</P>
<P>How is his sleep—quiet or disturbed?</P>
<P>Does he breathe with or without difficulty?</P>
<P>To what mode of diet and regimen has he been accustomed since the commencement of the present complaint?</P>
<P>What remedies has he used, and with what effect?</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="039111_0639_1013A46027EEEE50"/>
Has he ever before been attacked with the same malady?</P>
<P>In female and infantile diseases, there occur circumstances peculiar to the sex and age;—these, as well as the preceding general ques∣tions, require to be attended to, in consulting a medical man.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="questions">
<HEAD>Queries relative to Females.</HEAD>
<P>Do the menses appear regularly and in mod∣eration?</P>
<P>Is the patient pregnant, and how long?</P>
<P>If in child-bed, how was the delivery—suc∣cessful, or attended with difficulty?</P>
<P>Were the discharges easy and regular?</P>
<P>Has the patient a good breast of milk?</P>
<P>Does she suckle the child herself?</P>
<P>Is she subject to <HI>fluor albus,</HI> hysteric fits, &amp;c.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="questions">
<HEAD>Queries relative to Children.</HEAD>
<P>What is the exact age of the child?</P>
<P>How many teeth has it, and has it suffered much pain in teething?</P>
<P>Is it ricketty?—Is it of a stature correspond∣ing with its age?</P>
<P>Has it had the small-pox—natural or inoc∣ulated?</P>
<P>Has it a large and hard belly, with strong, or emaciated limbs?</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="039111_0640_1013A463D10475E8"/>
Does it sleep quietly, or start up, grind the teeth, scream, &amp;c.?</P>
<P>Does it discharge worms, and of what kind?</P>
<P>If worms are suspected to exist in the child (and the same observation will apply to adults), it ought to be examined whether some of the following, that is, at least four or five of the principal symptoms (marked with <HI>italics</HI>) con∣cur, which warrant such a conclusion:—<ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Slight cholic pains—frequent discharge of water from the mouth—<HI>fetid breath—itching of the nose</HI>—a swollen or chaped upper lip and nose—a ravenous appetite for, or aversion to food—oppression at the stomach—vomiting—<HI>an effort to swallow during sleep</HI>—costiveness, or diarrhoea—<HI>bloody excrements—sudden and frequent inclination to go to stool</HI>—a large belly and thin limbs—continual thirst—occasional debility, and sadness—<HI>frequent change of colour</HI>—languid eyes, with a livid hue around them, and standing half open during sleep—terrify∣ing dreams—frequent startings of the tendons—<HI>grinding the teeth</HI>—uneasiness and anxiety—<HI>a milky urine</HI>—palpitation of the heart, faint∣ing fits, convulsions—<HI>a profound and long sleep—cold sweats, appearing and vanishing suddenly</HI>—temporary dimness—dumbness, or difficulty of speech—weakness or lameness of the joints—<HI>corroded gums—frequent hiccough</HI>—a small and irregular pulse—delirious fits—<HI>a slight and dry cough—evacuation of thick, slimy matter</HI>—worms discharged from fistulous ulcers, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Besides the general questions which ought to be made and answered in all diseases, those likewise must not be neglected which more im∣mediately
<PB N="318" REF="039111_0641_10136E57F1ED0D38"/>
relate to the present affection of the patient. For instance, in a quinsey, we ought to be informed of the particular state and con∣dition of the throat:—in diseases of the breast, the seat of the pain, the straitness of the chest, the nature of the cough, and expectoration, should be distinctly mentioned. It would be useless here to enter into farther particulars, as the intention of these questions must appear self-evident to every intelligent reader: and although the queries appear numerous, they may be easily answered, and in as few words as they were formed.</P>
<P>The immortal Tissot observes, in his valuable work "On the Diseases of Country-people," that it would be a desirable object, if persons of all ranks, in their letters to physicians, were to adopt a plan similar to that above specified, as this would be the means of insuring satisfacto∣ry answers, and preventing the necessity of re∣peating their applications, and explaining the contents of former letters.</P>
