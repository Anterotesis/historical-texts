<P>TO the judicious Ladies, in these United States, whose honourable employment it is to lead the virtuous daughters of Columbia, to honour, to useful∣ness and to happiness.</P>
<P>To you, Ladies, is committed an important trust, and it is with pleasure that the parents and guardians of the <HI>fair sex,</HI> view the happy emulation that many of you raise in the br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asts of your amiable pupils, to the love of virtue, useful and ornamental knowledge.</P>
<P>The favourable reception of my Young Gentleman and Lady's Assistant, and Columbian Monitor, by <HI>some</HI> of you, and your receiving them into your Schools, merits my warmest acknowledgments.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT will be readily acknowledged, that the minds of youth are greatly attracted by <HI>novelty</HI> and <HI>variety;</HI> and that the most judicious Collections, however entertaining they may be at first, become less pleasing by being frequent∣ly perused.</P>
<P>I have, for a number of ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs, taken considerable pains to collect▪ a variety of delightful and useful materials for this work. Great care has been token, to avoid the inser∣tion of such pieces as have appeared in former compilations for the use of Schools.</P>
<P>That a collection of this kind, appropriated solely to the benefit and amusement of the <HI>fair sex,</HI> would be exceeding∣ly useful to Schools, has been frequently suggested by a number of literary friends, and likewise by several judi∣cious females who conduct the education of young Ladies.</P>
<P>Having been about twenty years engaged in the profes∣sion of a Teacher, I have had many opportunities of noti∣cing the dispositions of children; they naturally love read∣ing, but cannot relish dry or profound subjects, however excellent in their kind;—they want something to delight the fancy, and fix their volatility: How far this Collec∣tion is calculated to answer these ends, is left to a discern∣ing Public to decide.</P>
<P>It may be proper to observe here, that some alterations have been made in a number of the following pieces, with a view of adapting them to the present undertaking; but as the original sentiments are still retained, I trust, the Authors, from whom they are selected, will readily par∣don this necessary freedom.</P>
<P>Having neglected to distinguish the different pieces in this work, at the time they were selected, with the names of the respective Authors,—as I then designed them only for the use of the young Ladies under my care,—I regret that it is not now practicable wholly to remedy the omission.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTORY HINTS, RELATIVE TO <HI>POETRY</HI> AND THE <HI>MUSES.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<P>A <HI>POEM</HI> is a complete and finished piece of poetry:—The sort of verses that are chiefly used in our poetry, are those of <HI>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, eight</HI> and <HI>seven</HI> syllables.</P>
<P>There are various kinds of poetry in use; the most considerable are—</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Pastoral,</HI> that describes a shepherd's life, or that of rural nymphs and swains.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Elegy,</HI> is a mournful poem, or funeral song.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Lyric poetry,</HI> is generally used in the composition of odes and songs.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Pindaric,</HI> is a sort of poetry which consists of loose and free numbers, and unequal measure.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Satire,</HI> is a free, jocose, witty and sharp poem, severely inveighing against vice and all corrupt man∣ners and persons.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Comedy,</HI> is an agreeable imitation of the actions, humours and customs of common life.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Tragedy,</HI> in which the calamities of illustrious persons are represented, and their actions acted over again.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Epic or Heroic Poem,</HI> is a poetical narrative of some illustrious and important actions of the hero cel∣ebrated in the poem.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>Epigram,</HI> is an inferior kind of poem, whose pe∣culiar character is brevity, beauty, and a sharp turn of wit at the end.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE <HI>MUSES.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Muses</HI> had several names given them by the ancient poets, according to the different places where they dwelt, Sometimes they were called <HI>Pierides,</HI> on
<PB REF="037446_0006_100D0C9E32B24D50"/>
account of the forest <HI>Pieris</HI> in <HI>Macedonia,</HI> where they were said to be born; sometimes <HI>Heliconi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>des,</HI> from <HI>Mount Helicon,</HI> which was near their beloved PAR∣NASSUS; and sometimes by other names, according to the pleasure of the Mythologists, in their fabulou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> accounts of the <HI>Heathen Deities:</HI> They were called the daughters of <HI>Jupiter</HI> and <HI>Mnemosyne.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hesiod</HI> named them, <HI>Calliope, Clio, Erato, Thalia▪ M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pomene, Terpsichore, Euterpe, Poly<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ymnia,</HI> &amp; <HI>Urania.</HI> 1. <HI>Calliope,</HI> is the goddess of heroic poetry: 2. <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>io,</HI> of history: 3. <HI>Erato,</HI> of amorous poetry: 4. <HI>Thalia,</HI> of comedy: 5. <HI>Melpomene,</HI> of tragedy: 6. <HI>Terpsichore,</HI> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance: 7. <HI>Poly<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ymnia,</HI> of the ode: 8. <HI>Euterpe,</HI> of mu∣sic and musical instruments:—and 9. <HI>Urania</HI> of astro∣nomy.</P>
<P>They are represented by the poets—as very young, v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry handsome, and adorned with garlands of flowers.</P>
<P>The <HI>Muses</HI> were winged, to shew the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <HI>good wilts,</HI> and the quickness of p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etry and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, in moving the <HI>affections:</HI>—they bore <HI>pal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, to shew that they conquered mens' <HI>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssions.</HI></P>
<P>The muses are represented as all dancing in a ring▪ to shew the agreement and harmony among the <HI>liberal sciences:</HI> and the graces were joined with them, to shew the solid joy that is the constant attendant on LEARNING and VIRTUE.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>To recite verse with propriet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, it will be necessary to ob∣serve the few following rules:</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. All the words should be pronounced exactly the same as in prose.</P>
<P N="2">2. The movement of the voice should be from <HI>ac∣cent</HI> to <HI>accent,</HI> laying no stress on the intermediate syl∣lables.</P>
<P N="3">3. There should be the same observation of <HI>emphasis,</HI> and the same change of notes on the emphatic sylla∣bles, as in reading prose.</P>
<P N="4"><PB REF="037446_0007_100D0CA0532CA548"/>4. The pauses relative to the sense only, which I call sentential, are to be observed in the same manner as in prose; but particular attention must be given to those two peculiar to verse, the <HI>censural</HI> and <HI>final,</HI> which I call <HI>musical pauses.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. The usual faults of introducing sing-song notes, or a species of chanting i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>to poetical numbers, is dis∣agreeable to every ear, but that of the chanter himself.</P>
<P>Readers of verse ought to consider, that they are doing great injustice to the poet's music, when they substitute their own in its place.—The tune of the poet can then only be heard, when his verses are re∣cited with such notes of the voice as result from the sentiments: and a due proportion of time observed, in the feet and pauses, the constituent parts of verse.</P>

<P N="1">1. INDEED, my dear Nancy, I love to indulge innocent simplicity; with that single view, I now comply with your request.

<L>I esteem'd you a cleverer fellow, I own,</L>

A wise and virtuous young lady can never be proud; nor can she be exalted in her thoughts at any advantages she has above others, because she is con∣scious of her own weakness and inability to become either wise or virtuous, by any thing she finds in her own power; and her sense of the goodness of the bountiful God in bestowing upon her more abundant∣ly, what he has been pleased more sparingly to vouch∣safe to others, will inspire her soul with humility, thankfulness and adoration.</P>
<P N="23">23. If happiness be founded upon riches, it lies at the mercy of theft, deceit, oppression, war and tyran∣ny;—if upon fine houses, and costly furniture, one spark of fire is able to consume it; if upon husband, wife, children, friends, health or life, a thousand dis∣eases, and ten thousand accidents, have power to de∣stroy it; but, if it be founded upon the infinite bounty and goodness of God, and upon those virtues that e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> title to his favour, its foundation is unmovable, and its duration eternal.</P>
<P N="24">24. No trees bear fruit in autumn, unless they blos∣som in the spring. To the end that our age may be profitable, and laden with ripe fruit, let <HI>all</HI> endeavor, that our youth may be studious, and flowered with the blossoms of learning and observation.</P>
<P N="25">25. A constant habit of unprofitable amusement, relaxes the tone of the mind, and renders it totally incapable of application, study, or virtue.</P>
<P>Of all the virtues, there are none ought more to be inculcated into the mind of a young girl, than modesty and meekness. Vanity and pride are perpetually en∣deavoring to force their way into the heart; and too much care cannot be taken to repulse their efforts.</P>
<P N="26"><PB N="45" REF="037446_0046_100D0D096628DC20"/>26. Every appearance of amiable simplicity, or of honest shame, nature's hasty conscience, will be dear to so sensible hearts; they will carefully cherish every such indication in a young female; for they will per∣ceive, that it is this temper, wisely cultivated, which will one day make her enamored of the loveliness of virtue and beauty of holiness; from which she will acquire a taste for the doctrines of religion, and a spi∣rit to perform the duties of it.</P>
<P N="27">27. To piety join modesty and docility, reverence of your parents, and submission to those who are your superiors in knowledge, in station, and in years. De∣pendance and obedience belong to youth. Modesty is one of its chief ornaments; and has ever been deemed a presage of rising merit.</P>
<P N="28">28. Endeavor to acquire a temper of universal can∣dour and benevolence; and learn neither to despise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> condemn any person on account of their particular modes of faith or worship; remembering, always, that goodness is confined to no party:—that there are wise and worthy men among all the sects of christians —and that to his own master, every one must stand or fall.</P>
<P N="29">29. Dost thou ask a torch to discover the brightness of the morning?—Dost thou appeal to arguments for proofs of divine perfection?—Look down on the earth on which thou standest, and lift up thine eyes to the worlds that roll above thee:—thou beholdest splendor, abundance and beauty:—is not he who produced them mighty? Thou considerest—is not he who formed thy understanding, wise? Thou enjoyest—is not he who gratifies thy senses, good? Can aught have li∣mited his bounty, but his wisdom? or can any defects be therein discovered by thy sagacity?</P>
<P N="30"><PB N="46" REF="037446_0047_100D0CD38D075F78"/>30. She who values not the virtue of <HI>modesty</HI> in her words and dress, will not be thought to set much price upon it in her actions.</P>
<P>Simplicity, the inseparable companion both of ge∣nuine grace, and of real modesty, if it doth not always strike at first sight (of which it seldom fails) is sure, however, when it does strike, to produce the deepest and most permanent impressions.</P>
<P N="31">31. Every thing, overdone, is liable to suspicion. Innocence, in women, wants not the aid of ostenta∣tion; like integrity in men, it rests on its own con∣sciousness.</P>
<P N="32">32. Be very cautious of speaking or believing any ill of your neighbors; but be much more cautious of making hasty reports of them to their disadvantage.</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS ON POETRY.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1 PROPERLY to direct the human faculties, was certainly the immediate object of this sublime, beautiful and useful art. We are sufficiently inform∣ed, that in the earliest ages morality was inculcated by Bards:—They civilized the world.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let us pursue this divine art to other eras <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and we shall find, that science and morality have been con∣veyed to us through the medium of verse. That the leader of the Hebrews was a poet, is undeniable. He embellishes religion with all the sublimity of imagery, and all the graces of diction. Every prophet resound∣ed his prediction in sublime verse.—Thus the song of Moses was a prototype of the elegant psalms of David, and the sublime strains of Isaiah. It cannot be deni∣ed, that poetry is highly conducive to rational pleasure in every department of life; and is as capable of in∣nocently amusing the fancy, as of improving the mind.</P>

<HEAD>ON MODERN FASHION.</HEAD>
<L>SOME few years ago, when stays, corsets, and bodice</L>
<L>Displayed the fine shapes of our fair British belles,</L>
<L>Each female possess'd the bright form of a goddess,</L>
<L>With roses and lilies, and dimples and dells:</L>
<L>Then grandams were guided by prudence and reason,</L>
<L>And wives were all modest, yet lovely and gay;</L>
<L>Old maidens resembled the wane of the season,</L>
<L>And miss in her teens a sweet blossom in May.</L>
<L>Now such is the rapid transitions of fashion,</L>
<L>That folly can govern the world at her will;</L>
<L>And each wither'd prude, like a child in a passion,</L>
<L>Thinks age may be ground into youth by a mill:</L>
<L>For since the fine waist hath mov'd up to the shoulder,</L>
<L>Our tabbies and grandmothers look so uncouth,</L>
<L>One would think they'd transplanted, asham'd to grow older,</L>
<L>Antiquity's head to the shoulders of youth.</L>
<L>But dress tho our ladies now cut such a dash in,</L>
<L>Pray could they the impulse of laughter controul,</L>
<L>To view an old sheep garnish'd up in lamb fashion,</L>
<L>Or the plumes of a peacock adorning an owl?</L>
<L>Reflect then, ye fair, on the words of the poet,</L>
<L>Whose classical talents we proudly may boast,</L>
<L>That, "Beauty needs no foreign patches to show it,</L>
<L>For unadorn'd beauty adorn'd is the most."</L>

<HEAD>ON RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>Having in the former part of this work, attempted to re∣gale my fair readers, with a variety of pleasant flowers, —I would now beg leave to invite them to partake of a more solid repast.</P>
<P N="1">1. THROUGH all the vicissitudes of life, from the cradle to the grave, religion proves the never-failing friend of man. Launched on a tempestuous ocean, and buoyed up with the phantom hope, we vainly think ourselves secure, till the fanciful picture is withdrawn from our sight, and we find the need of a more solid comfort and companion. In prosperity, when every thing around us wears a pleasing aspect, and mirth and conviviality attend our ways, conscience, that intruder on sensual delights, interposes betwixt us and ruin, and shews us the danger of weaning our mind from heaven. It is then we view the design of those comforts of which we are possessed; and the re∣al use, and the too frequent abuse, is exhibited to our view.</P>
<P N="2">2. Diversify this scene with the more melancholy idea of adversity, and all the complicated woes of life. View an aged father and a declining mother, tortured by the pangs of their suffering little ones, for that sus∣tenance, which, alas! they are unable to afford; and yet, amongst all this accumulation of misery, the beau∣ties of religion impart animation to their dejected souls. They are consoled in the remembrance of be∣ing participants of the benignity of that Providence who supported Elijah in the wilderness, and who is able to alleviate the horrors of their situation.</P>
<P N="3">3. Nor is the superior excellence of religion more conspicuous in this, than in the common occurrences of life. A mind deprived of the idea of responsibility,
<PB N="62" REF="037446_0063_100CDAC5893E8FD8"/>
is regardless of its conduct here; and tho' the faith∣ful monitor may sometimes suggest an alarm, yet they proceed in a careless indifference, till at last they sink into the abyss of ruin.</P>
<P>Religion may be justly called the greatest enjoyment of man. It is a never-failing source of delight to those who happily embrace its ways, as its tendency is ul∣timately and securely to possess felicity.</P>
<P>If such, then, appears the consolations resulting from this divine perfection, how egregiously stupid do they appear, who, satisfied with present enjoyment, are regardless of the future!</P>
<P N="4">4. In the hour of dissolution, when all the plaudits of the world shall be found ineffectual to quiet the pangs of remorse, religion would administer the most soothing ideas to their perturbed hearts. To look back on their past existence, is a vacuum so replete with dismay, and time so infamously perverted, that they are petrified with horror at the awful retrospect. An∣ticipation of the future still heightens their melancho∣ly; and what would they now give, could but one hour be recalled, to make peace with that being whom they have so long wantonly despised.</P>
<P>Could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ught soar beyond the boundaries of mor∣tality, and pourtray to imagination the realms of in∣finity, it could not sufficiently shew the matchless beauties of religion.</P>
<P N="5">5. Dr. Gregory has justly observed that, the scenes of distress, in which women are very frequently in∣volved, religion is their only solace and support. They cannot, when oppressed by sorrow, or harrassed by worldly cares, fly to business or those tumultuous plea∣sures which dissipate, if they do not calm, the mind: condemned to fight on even ground and listen to the very echo of their grief, piety alone can still the mur∣murs of discontent, and give stability to their princi∣ples:
<PB N="63" REF="037446_0064_100D0D4F3A67FEF0"/>
but piety is not to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> acquired in the hour of trouble; it must have been a cherished inmate of the soul, or it will not not afford consolation when every other source fails.</P>
<P N="6">6. The general opinion of mankind, that there is a strong connection between a religious disposition and a feeling heart, appears from the universal dislike which all men have to infidelity in the <HI>fair sex.</HI> We not on∣ly look upon it as removing the principal security we have for their virtue, but as the strongest proof of their want of that softness and delicate sensibillty of heart, which peculiarly endears them to us, and more ef∣fectually secures their empire over us, than any qua∣lity they can possess.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI></BIBL>
<P N="7">7. If young ladies, says the ingenious Mr. Cress∣wick, would listen to me a few moments, I would endeavour to prove to them that the most sedulous at∣tention to the person will never improve it, whilst a cultivated mind renders the most graceful form more pleasing:—What do I say?—there is no grace with∣out it; nor any beauty, that will charm for half an hour, which does nor arise from an artless display of virtue or sense. But it is not necessary to speak, to display mental charms—the eye will quickly inform us if an active soul resides within; and a blush is far more eloquent than the best turned period.</P>
<P N="8">8. There is something peculiarly soothing and com∣fortable in a firm belief that the whole frame of na∣ture is supported and conducted by an eternal and om∣nipotent being, of infinite goodness, who intends, by the whole course of his providence, to promote the greatest good of all his creatures; a belief that we are acquainted with the means of conciliating the divine favour, and that in consequence of this we have it in our power to obtain it; a belief that this life is but the infancy of our existence, that we shall survive the
<PB N="64" REF="037446_0065_100CDAC756F428E0"/>
seeming destruction of o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> present frame, and have it in our power to secure our entrance on a new state of eternal felicity.</P>

<HEAD>ON THE RESURRECTION.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. I HAVE seen the flower withering on the stalk, and its bright leaves spread on the ground.—I looked again, and it sprung up afresh; the stem was crowned with new buds, and the sweetness thereof filled the air.</P>
<P>I have seen the sun set in the west, and the shades of night shut the wide horizon: there was no colour, nor shape, nor beauty, nor music; gloom and dark∣ness brooded around. I looked; the sun broke out again from the east, and gilded the mountain tops; the lark rose to meet him from her low nest, and the shades of darkness fled away.</P>
<P N="2">2. I have seen the insect, being come to its full size, languish, and refuse to eat; it spun itself a tomb, and was shrowded in the silken cone; it lay without feet, or shape, or power to move. I looked again; it had burst its tomb; it was full of life, and sailed upon coloured wings through the soft air; it rejoiced in its new being.</P>
<P>Thus shall it be with thee, O man! and so shall thy life be renewed.—Beauty shall spring up out of ashes, and life out of the dust.—A little while shalt thou lie on the ground, as the seed lieth in the bosom of the earth:—but thou shalt be raised again; and, if thou art good, thou shalt never die any more.</P>
<P N="3">3. Who is he that cometh to burst open the doors of the tomb; to bid the dead awake, and to gather his redeemed from the four winds of heaven? He de∣scendeth on a fiery cloud; the sound of a trumpet go∣eth before him; thousands of angels are on his right hand:—It is JESUS, the son of GOD; the saviour of

men; the friend of the good▪ He cometh in the glo∣ry of his father; he hath received power from on high! —Mourn not, therefore, child of immortality! for the spoiler, the cruel spoiler that laid waste the works of God, is subdued:—JESUS hath conquered death.— Child of immortality, mourn no longer.</P>

<HEAD>ON TRUE POLITENESS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. POLITENESS is the first medium between form and rudeness. It is the consequence of a be∣nevolent nature, which shews itself to general ac∣quaintance in an obliging unconstrained civility, as it does to more particular ones in distinguished acts of kindness. This good nature must be directed by a justness of sense, and a quickness of discernment, that knows how to use every opportunity of exercising it, and to proportion the instances of it to every charac∣ter and situation.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is a restraint laid by reason and benevolence upon every irregularity of the temper, which, in obe∣dience to them, is forced to accommodate itself even to the fantastic cares which custom and fashion have established, if by that means it can procure in any de∣gree the satisfaction or good opinion of any part of mankind; thus paying an obliging deference to their judgment, so far as it is not inconsistent with the high∣er obligations of virtue and religion.</P>
<P N="3">3. This must be accompanied with an elegance of taste, and a delicacy observant of the least trifles which tend to please or oblige; and though its foundation must be rooted in the heart, it can scarce be perfect without a complete knowledge of the world. In so∣ciety it is the medium that blends all different tempers into the most pleasing harmony, while it imposes si∣lence on the loquacious, and inclines the most reserved to furnish their share of the conversation.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="66" REF="037446_0067_100D0D1AE7FE4418"/>4. It represses the desire of shining alone, and in∣creases the desire of being mutually agreeable. It takes off the edge of raillery, and gives delicacy to wit. It preserves a proper subordination among all ranks of people, and can reconcile a perfect ease with the most exact propriety. To superiors it appears in a respectful freedom; and no intimacy can sink it into a regardless familiarity.</P>
<P N="5">5. To inferiors it shews itself in an unassuming good nature. Its aim is, to raise them to you, and not to let you down to them. It at once maintains the dignity of your station, and expresses the goodness of your heart. To equals it is every thing that is charming; it studies their inclinations, prevents their desires, attends to every little exactness of behaviour, and all the time appears perfectly disengaged and careless.</P>
<P N="6">6. Such and so amiable is true politeness: by peo∣ple of wrong heads and unworthy hearts disgraced in its two extremes: and by the generality of mankind confined within the narrow bounds of mere good breeding, which, in truth, is only one instance of it.</P>
<P N="7">7. True politeness, whose great end is giving real pleasure, can have its source only in a virtuous and bene∣volent heart. Yet this is no tall; it must observe pro∣priety too. There is a character of perfect good na∣ture, that loves to have every thing about it happy and merry.—This is a character greatly to be loved, but has little claim to the title of politeness. Such per∣sons have no notion of freedom without noise and tu∣mult: and by taking off every proper restraint, and sinking themselves to the level of their companions, even lessen the pleasure these would have in the com∣pany of their superiors,</P>

<HEAD>RATIONAL LOVE.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. WE all know the power of <HI>beauty,</HI> but to ren∣der it permanent and make human life more happy and agreeable, it must have the beauties of the mind annexed. For, as Dr. Blair very justly observes, "Feeble are the attractions of the fairest form, if no∣thing <HI>within</HI> corresponds to the pleasing appearance <HI>without." Love</HI> and <HI>marriage</HI> are two words much spoken of, but seldom found united. To be happy in the choice of the fair one we admire, is to cultivate that regard we experience for her, into lasting esteem.</P>
<P N="2">2. Love is a tender and delicate plant; it must be guarded from all inclement blasts, or it will droop and die. To enliven our hours, to pass our life agreeably, let us enrich our mental soil; for this, joined with love, will for ever adorn the marriage state. A young lady, being asked her opinion of <HI>love,</HI> said—"If youth and beauty are the objects of your regard, <HI>love,</HI> found∣ed on youth and beauty, cannot possibly endure longer than youth and beauty last. Love should be sincere and generous, as heaven first inspired it, and court <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> void of mean dissimulation. But love, at this time of day, is raising the imagination to expectations above nature, and thereby laying the sure foundation of dis∣appointment on both sides, when Hymen shifts the scene." Love then according to this sensible young lady's opinion, is a <HI>passion founded on esteem:</HI> A sincere regard for the object of our affections, joined with a love, the most pure, and rational.</P>

<HEAD>EXTRACT.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THOSE principles of freedom, those maxims of education, which embrace only half mankind, are only half systems, and will no more support the burden of humanity, than the perpendicular section of an arch will support a column. Our daughters are

<P N="2">2. The first moulding of the human mind, falls so naturally upon the sex, that the voice of nature would have induced us to fit them for the task, if the voice of nature had not been drowned in the clamour of our other prejudices. How shall our children learn forti∣tude from mothers who scream at the appearance of a spider? How shall they learn that they are formed for their country and mankind, from mothers who know nothing of the history of either? How shall they learn that "the mind is the standard of the man," from teachers who are forever directing their attention to their persons? How shall they acquire habits of labour, and independence of spirit, from those whose debility of both mind and body, unfits them for either?</P>

<HEAD>The following judicious remarks are selected form a tract entitled, "<HI>Thoughts upon Female Education,</HI> ac∣commodated to the present state of society, manners, and government, in the United States." Addressed to the Visitors of the young ladies' Academy, in Philadelphia, by that eminent patron of the fair sex, <HI>BENJAMIN RUSH, M. D.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE first remark that I shall make upon this subject, is, that female education should be accommodated to the state of society, manners, and government of the country, in which it is conducted.</P>
<P>There are several circumstances in the situation, employments, and duties of women, in America, which require a peculiar mode of education.</P>
<P>The early marriages of our women, by contracting the time allowed for education, render it necessary to contract its plan, and to confine it chiefly to the more useful branches of literature.</P>
<P N="2">2. The state of property, in America, renders it ne∣cessary for the greatest part of our citizens to employ themselves, in different occupations, for the advance∣ment of their fortunes. This cannot be done without
<PB N="70" REF="037446_0071_100D0D1FE1EC20B8"/>
the assistance of the female members of the community. They must be the stewards and guardi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns of their hus∣bands' property. That education, therefore, will be most proper for our women, which teaches them to discharge the duties of those offices with the most suc∣cess and reputation.</P>
<P N="3">3. The branch of literature most essential for a young lady, in this country, appears to be, —a know∣ledge of the English language. She should not only read, but speak and <HI>spell</HI> it correctly.</P>
<P>Pleasure and interest conspire to make the writing of a fair and legible hand, a necessary branch of female education. For this purpose she should be taught not only to shape every letter properly, but to pay the strictest regard to points and capitals.</P>
<P>I once heard of a man who professed to discover the temper and disposition of persons by looking at their hand-writing. Without enquiring into the probabili∣ty of the story; I shall only remark, that there is one thing in which all mankind agree, upon this subject, and that is, in considering writing that is blotted, crooked, or illegible, as a mark of vulgar education: I know of few things more rude or illiberal, than to obtrude a letter upon a person of rank or business, which connot be easily read.</P>
<P N="4">4. Some knowledge of figures and book-keeping is absolutely necessary to qualify a young lady for the duties that await her in this country. There are certain occupations in which she may assist her hus∣band with this knowledge; and should she survive him, and agreeable to the custom of our country be the executrix of his will, she cannot fail of deriving immense advantages from it.</P>
<P N="5">5. An acquaintance with geography, and some in∣struction in chronology will enable a young lady to read history, biography and travels, with advantage;
<PB N="71" REF="037446_0072_100D0D59CED0ADC8"/>
and thereby qualify her not only for a general inter∣course with the world, but, to be an agreeable com∣panion for a sensible man.</P>
<P>Dancing is by no means an improper branch of edu∣cation for an American lady. It promotes health, and renders the figures and motions of the body easy and agreeable.</P>
<P N="6">6. The attention of our young ladies should be di∣rected, as soon as they are prepared for it, to the reading of history, travels, poetry, and moral essays. These studies are accommodated, in a peculiar man∣ner, to the present state of society, in America, and when a relish is excited for them, in early life, they subdue that passion for reading novels, which so ge∣nerally prevail among the fair sex.</P>
<P N="7">7. There have been many controversies upon the subject of public and private education. The princi∣pal objection to the former has always been derived from its mischievous influence upon the morals and manners of young people. The folly and vice of eve∣ry scholar, it has been said, are disseminated; so that in a little while, each scholar possesses the follies and vices of the whole. But is there no remedy for these evils? yes there is—the <HI>principles and precepts of chris∣tianity</HI> are a sovereign antidote to them. Let, there∣fore, all the branches of education, which have been mentioned, be connected with regular instruction in the christian religion.</P>
<P N="8">8. For this purpose the principles of the different sects of Christians should be taught and explained, and our pupils should early be furnished with some of the most simple arguments in favour of the truth of Chris∣tianity. A portion of the Bible (of late improperly banished from our schools) should be read by them ev∣ery day, and such questions should be asked, after read∣ing it, as are calculated to imprint upon their minds the interesting stories contained in it.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="72" REF="037446_0073_100D0D2209262DA8"/>9. <HI>Rosseau</HI> has asserted, that he great secret of edu∣cation consists in "wasting the time of children pro∣perly." There is some truth in this observation. I believe that we often impair their health, and weaken their capacities, by imposing studies upon them, which are not proportioned to their years. But this objec∣tion does not apply <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> religious instruction. There are certain simple propositions in the Christian reli∣gion, that are suited in a peculiar manner, to the in∣fant state of reason and moral sensibility.</P>
<P N="10">10. A clergyman of long experience i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the instruc∣tion of youth,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Rev. Dr. Nicholas Collin, minister of the Swe∣dish church in Wincocoe.</NOTE> informed me, that he always found children acquired religious knowledge more easily than knowledge upon other subjects; and that young girls acquired this kind of knowledge more readily than boys. The female breast is the natural soil of Chris∣tianity; and while our women are taught to believe its doctrines, and obey its precepts, the wit of Vol∣taire, and the style of Bolingbroke, will never be able to destroy its influence upon our citizens.</P>
<P N="11">11. I cannot help remarking in this place, that Christianity exerts the most friendly influence upon science, as well as upon the morals and manners of mankind. Whether this be occasioned by the unity of truth, and the mutual assistance which truths upon different subjects afford each other, or whether the fa∣culties of the mind be sharpened and corrected by em∣bracing the truths of revelation, and thereby prepared to investigate and perceive truths upon other subjects, I will not determine, but it is certain that the great∣est discoveries in science have been made by Christian philosophers, and that there is the most knowledge in those countries where there is the most Christianity.</P>
<P N="12"><PB N="73" REF="037446_0074_100D0D5C09F1D278"/>12. By knowledge I mean truth only; and by truth I mean the perception of things as they appear to the divine mind. If this remark be well founded, then those philosophers who reject christianity, and those christians, whether parents or school-masters, who neglect the religious instruction of their children and pupils, <HI>reject</HI> and <HI>neglect</HI> the most effectual means of promoting knowledge in our country.</P>
<P N="13">13. If the measures that have been recommended for inspiring our pupils with a sense of religious and moral obligations be adopted, the government of them will be easy and agreeable. I shall only remark un∣der this head, that <HI>strictness</HI> of discipline will always render <HI>severity</HI> unnecessary, and that there will be the most instruction in that school where there is most order.</P>
<P N="14">14. A philosopher once said, "Let me make all the ballads of a country, and I care not who makes its laws."—He might with more propriety have said, let the ladies of a country be properly educated, and they will not only make and administer its laws, but form its manners and character. It would require a lively imagination to describe, or even to comprehend the happiness of a country, where knowledge and vir∣tue were generally diffused among the female sex.</P>
<P N="15">15. Our young men would then be restrained from vice by the terror of being banished from their com∣pany. The loud laugh, and the malignant smile, at the expence of innocence, or personal infirmities— the feats of successful mimickry—and the low-priced wit, which is borrowed from a misapplication of scrip∣ture phrases, would no more be considered as recom∣mendations to the society of ladies. A double enten∣dre, in their presence, would then exclude a gentle∣man forever from the company of both sexes, and
<PB N="74" REF="037446_0075_100D0D2431B357C8"/>
probably oblige him to seek an asylum from contempt, in a foreign country.</P>
<P N="16">16. The influence of female education would be still more extensive and useful in domestic life. The obligation of gentlemen to qualify themselves by know∣ledge and industry to discharge the duties of benevo∣lence, would be increased by marriage; and the pat∣riot, the hero, and the legislator, would find the sweet∣est reward of their toils, in the approbation and ap∣plause of their wives.—Children would discover the marks of maternal prudence and wisdom in every sta∣tion of life; for it has been remarked that there have been few great or good men who have not been blessed with wise and prudent mothers.</P>
<P N="17">17. <HI>Cyrus</HI> was taught to revere the gods, by his mother <HI>Mandane—Samuel</HI> was devoted to his prophetic office be∣fore he was born, by his mother <HI>Hannah—Constantine</HI> was rescued from paganism by his mother <HI>Constantia</HI>—&amp; <HI>Edward</HI> the sixth inherited those great and excellent qualities, which made him the delight of the age in which he lived, from his mother lady, <HI>Jane Seymour.</HI> Many other instances might be mentioned, if necessa∣ry, from anci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt and modern history, to establish the truth of this proposition.</P>
<P>The Doctor concludes his excellent address to the visitors, with the following interesting remarks to the young ladies of the seminary.</P>
<P N="18">18. Young Ladies—An important problem is com∣mitted for solution; and that is, whether our present plan of education be a wise one, and whether it be calculated to prepare you for the duties of social and domestic life. I know that the elevation of the female mind, by means of moral, physical and religious truths, is considered by some men as unfriendly to the domes∣tic character of a woman. But this is the prejudice of little minds, and springs from the same spirit which
<PB N="75" REF="037446_0076_100D0D5D969DE2F0"/>
opposes the general diffusion of knowled<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e among the citizens of our republic. If men believe that igno∣rance is favourable to the government of the female sex, they are certainly deceived; for a weak and ig∣norant woman will always be governed with the great∣est difficulty. I have sometimes been led to ascribe the invention of ridiculous fashions in female dress, entirely to the gentlemen,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The very expensive prints of female dresses, which are published annually in France, are invented and executed wholly by <HI>GENTLEMEN.</HI></NOTE> in order to divert the ladies from improving their minds, and thereby to secure a more arbitrary and unlimitted authority over them.</P>
<P N="19">19. It will be in your power, Ladies, to correct the mistake and practice of our sex upon these sub∣jects, by demonstrating, that the female temper can only be governed by reason, and that the cultivation of reason, in women, is alike friendly to the order of nature, and to private as well as public happiness.</P>

<HEAD>OF BAHAVIOUR IN COMPANY.</HEAD>
<P N="12">12. In seating yourself take care you leave the best places for the company, and never sit with your back to any one. Study your exercise when alone; and never read or look upon a book, in company. If other children are in company never whisper with them.— Never laugh at what the company does not know, for it will seem as if you laughed at them!—This is too common a custom, with some ladies, though a mani∣fest breach of good manners!</P>
<P>Look in the face of the person you speak to, and the same when he speaks to you: but do this modestly and decently. Appear always easy and placid when you are in company, and in return you will be amply rewarded by the company being pleased with you.</P>
<P N="13">13. Speak slow and not too loud. Take care to pronounce your words distinctly. Use few words, and know when to hold your tongue. Wait the reply of the person that speaks, and whatever it be, hear it with good temper: if he contradicts you, do not think of arguing with him; for more years must undoubt∣edly have made him wiser than yourself. For the same reason, never do you contradict an elderly per∣son. If any one says a thing that you know to be wrong, do not contradict him or her—Modesty and humility are the best things a young lady in company can practise. When you are going to retire from any company, rise gracefully and slowly from your seat; address your eyes modestly to the principal person in the company, and courtesy retiring—make a general courtesy to the rest. Never make any more courtesies than here directed, for they are vulgar and troublesome.</P>

<HEAD>Some rules and observations necessary for young Ladies.</HEAD>
<P N="20">20. A young lady of virtue and good sense, will ne∣ver think it beneath her care and study to cultivate the graces of her outward mien and figure, which contri∣bute so considerably toward making her behaviour ac∣ceptable: for as from the happy disposition of the hands, feet, and other parts of the body, there arises a genteel deportment; so where we see a young lady standing in a genteel position, or adjusting herself pro∣perly, in walking, standing, or sitting, in a graceful manner, we never fail to admire that exterior excel∣lence
<PB N="82" REF="037446_0083_100D0D2E5C765C98"/>
of form, and regular disposition, suited to the rules of decency, modesty, and good manners.</P>
<P N="21">21. To accomplish these, I shall first recommend it to my readers, whether in company or out, to avoid all particular or affected motions of the head, all wan∣ton or oblique glances of the eyes, all ogling or wink∣ing, dimpling of the cheeks, or primming of the lips: and in walking, remember to let your carriage be ea∣sy, but not loose, regular, but not precise; and void of conceit in all your gestures: let your mien be free, and your air without the least affectation.</P>
<P N="22">22. But these accomplishments in carriage, I must here observe to my little scholars, are only the beau∣ties of your person, which, though extremely pleasing to all outward appearance, will never render you per∣fectly agreeable, unless accompanied with a strict re∣gard to modesty; which banishes every thing that is indecent or uncomely in your looks, words or actions; it tunes and refines every thing you say, moderates the tone, and never admits earnest or loud discourse.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I. FROM PORTIA TO HER DAUGHTER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Sophy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHILE you lived under my immediate care and inspection, I endeavoured to set before you a good example, and to instil into your, tender mind such maxims of virtue and prudence, as were suitable to your age and capacity. But now that you are settled in Mrs. Bromley's boarding-school, I can no longer follow this method of instruction. However, what I cannot perform in person, I will endeavour to supply by letters. For, though you are removed out of my sight, you are not, for all that, banished from my though<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. On the contrary, you are more in them now than ever.</P>
<P N="2">2. I feel my concern for your happiness rather in∣creased than diminished by absence; and I confess, that nothing in this world would give me so much pleasure, as to see you, one day, prove an accomplish∣ed woman To enable you to become such, no ad∣vantages of education shall be wanting Mrs. Brom∣ley is a woman of such approved abilities and fidelity, that there is no danger of any neglect on her part; and the best advice and directions I can give, you shall re∣ceive in a series of letters, which I propose to write to you from time to time; and, I hope, I shall have the pleasure of seeing the good effect they have upon you, by your daily improvement in knowledge and virtue.</P>
<P N="3">3. First of all, then, my dear Sophy, let me advise you to obey Mrs. Bromley in every thing she com∣mands. She is a gentlewoman of so much good sense, that she will desire you to do nothing but what is rea∣sonable; and, I know, she will explain to you the
<PB N="94" REF="037446_0095_100D0D3D078D9800"/>
reasonableness of all her injunctions, where you are able to comprehend it: and, where you are not, you must take it for granted, that they are for your real interest and advantage. In a word, you must behave to her with all the respect and obedience of a child; as, I am confident, she will treat you with all the af∣fection and tenderness of a parent. Your next care must be to procure the love and esteem of your school-fellows, by an inoffensive and obliging behaviour.— Hurt nobody; speak ill of nobody; tell no lies of any body; but do to every one all the kind and civil of∣fices you can. Lying, indeed, is a vice I never found you guilty of; and, I believe, I might have spared my advice on that head.</P>
<P N="4">4. But there is another vice, against which I would caution you, I mean tale bearing? not that I ever perceived you more inclined to this vice than any oth∣er, but because you will now, perhaps, be under strong∣er temptations to the commission of it; and because, of all others, it will render you most odious to your companions. The nature and limitations of this vice I shall explain to you more fully in some succeeding letter, when you will be more capable of understand∣ing me. As many of your companions are much old∣er than you, and farther advanced in their learning, take care to pay them that respect and deference which is due to their superior age and knowledge; especial∣ly, if, at any time, they are employed by the gover∣ness or teachers to direct you in your tasks.</P>
<P N="5">5. I have got a thousand things besides to say to you, but these must be the subjects of some future letters. Let me advise you, however, before I conclude, to be punctual in saying your prayers every morning and evening. You know I gave you peremptory instruc∣tions on this head at parting, and, I hope, you will not forget them. I expect to hear a good account of
<PB N="95" REF="037446_0096_100D0D73DC326DF8"/>
your behaviour and improvement from Mrs. Bromley, who has promised to write to me now and then.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Sophy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P N="1">1. I HAD lately the pleasure of hearing from Mrs. Bromley that you make great progress in learn∣ing your English, and that she expects you will soon be one of the best readers in the school. To be able to read with propriety is certainly a very genteel ac∣complishment, and not so easy to be acquired as most people imagine; and, perhaps, you will not find one woman in five hundred that is possessed of it. There are so many faulty ways of reading, which young people, are apt to run into, that it is difficult to avoid them all; and when once a bad habit is contracted, it is almost impossible to correct it.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is your aunt Filmer, who reads with such a canting tone as grates the ears of the whole com∣pany. She has frequently almost sung me to sleep, though reading one of the most diverting books in the world. Your cousin Pulteney, you know, reads with such hurry and rapidity, and such neglect of the proper stops and pauses, that the most attentive hearer cannot understand one sentence she pronounces; whilst Mrs. Dashwood reads in such a slow and slovenly manner, and draws out the words to such an immo∣derate length, that nobody has patience to follow her. Mrs. Nugent reads with such a loud shrill voice as stuns the ears of the whole audience. It might do ve∣ry well in a public assembly, but is altogether unfit for a tea-tale; whereas Miss Littleton's accent is so
<PB N="96" REF="037446_0097_100D0D3F33B48E98"/>
faint and feeble, that you must apply your ear almost to her mouth, before you can understand the subject.</P>
<P N="3">3. I would therefore, have you form yourself upon the example of your governess, who indeed, is one of the best readers I ever heard. She reads with the same easy natural voice as she uses in conversation. She observes the stops and pauses with great exactness. She reads so slow as to be easily understood by any per∣son, who will give a proper attention, and is not ab∣solutely dull; and yet so fast, as not to disgust those of the quickest apprehension. Her voice she carefully adapts to the number and extent of her audience.</P>
<P N="4">4. When she reads to a large company, her voice is high without being shrill; when to a small one it is low, but withal distinct. In a word, she is a com∣plete mistress of the art of reading; and you cannot fail to become so too, if you imitate her manner, and follow her directions. There are, besides, some niceties in reading; which I am afraid are above your comprehension at present; but when you are farther advanced in your learning, I will explain them to you in some future letter. Your papa, your brothers, and sisters join me in offering our love to you.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III. FROM SOPHIA TO HER MOTHER PORTIA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Mamma,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE all your letters lying by me: I read them carefully every morning. I am obliged to you for the good advice you give me; and I will endeavour to follow it. I am not able to tell you, Mamma, how I was affected, when I read the love and affection you express for me: all I can say is, that I wept for joy.
<PB N="97" REF="037446_0098_100D0D774CBC9EC0"/>
God grant I may prove as good a woman as you wish me to be! it shall always be my endeavour to become such. I live very happily; my school fellows are ve∣ry fond of me, and Mrs. Bromley is very kind and careful. I am learning English, sewing, writing, cyphering, and dancing: and Mrs. Bromley says I shall soon begin to learn French.</P>
<P N="2">2. I would have written to you before now; but, you know, you forbade me, at parting, to send you any letters, till I could write a pretty good hand. I am afraid you will think it still very indifferent; but I have written as well as I could, and, I hope I shall improve daily. I have followed your directions in spelling; for I have scarce written one word without looking for it in the dictionary which you sent me, and for which I am obliged to you: but if I have made any mistakes, you will be so good as to let me know in your next letter. Please to offer my duty to my papa, and my kind love to my brothers and sisters.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Mamma,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P N="1">1. IT is now more than a month, I think, since I received your last letter. I am glad that Mrs. Bromley gives you so favourable an account of the pro∣gress I make in music: perhaps it is more than I de∣serve. I can only say, that I shall do all that lies in my power to learn this and every other thing you de∣sire me. I am greatly obliged to you for the good ad∣vice and directions you have given me in your several letters; it shall always be my constant endeavour to observe them. As you are pleased to say, that no∣thing
<PB N="98" REF="037446_0099_100D0D40C05AF140"/>
gives you greater pleasure than to hear of my improvement: so, you may be assured, nothing gives me so great pleasure as to receive your approbation.</P>
<P N="2">2. For, though I am sensible of the usefulness and importance of all the different accomplishments, which you recommend to me; yet if I know my own heart, I think it is rather from a prospect of making you happy, than from any regard to my own interest, that I apply to my learning with so much pleasure and dil∣ligence. How happy am I in having a mother, who places her chief delight in the welfare of her children! God grant I may never render myself unworthy of so good a parent! I hope I never shall.</P>
<P N="3">3. I have been learning French for a considerable time past, and my master seems to be very well satis∣fied with my progress. He has lately put into my hands Gil Blas and the Diable Boiteux, both which, I think, are highly entertaining and improving. Be so good as to write me your opinion of the matter, and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her you think the advantages I may reap from a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ledge of this language, will be sufficient to re∣ward the time and labour which are necessary to ac∣quire it; for I would not willingly throw away more time upon any part of my education than it really de∣serves.

<HEAD>LETTER V. FROM PORTIA TO HER DAUGHTER SOPHIA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Sophy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P N="1">1. I HAD, lately, the pleasure of hearing from Mrs. Bromley, that you are daily improving in all the different branches of your education, and particularly
<PB N="99" REF="037446_0100_100D0D78D447B620"/>
in geography, which, she says, you have been learn∣ing for some months past. This is an accomplish∣ment equally useful and genteel; but in which, I am sorry to say it, most of our sex are shamefully defici∣ent; as I could prove by a variety of examples. Your aunt Delaval has frequently asked me whether Con∣stantinople lay in Asia or Africa, and a thousand other questions no less ridiculous. Miss Fenton, whose wit is greater than her knowledge, and her vanity greater than both, is perpetually committing blunders of this kind.</P>
<P N="2">2. Mr. Grenville happened, the other day, to be reading the news-papers to a large company, and, among other articles one from Warsaw, giving an ac∣count of a certain nobleman, who, for some slight cause, had divorced his lady. He had no sooner finish∣ed, than Miss, with her usual forwardness, observed that these Spaniards were the worst husbands in the world. Some of the company smiled, others blushed, and the rest remained demurely grave. Miss, pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣ving her error, was confounded and abashed. B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e gentleman, out of his great humanity, endeavoured to apologize for her, as well as he could, by adding, that the young lady's remark was very just; that, tho the place mentioned in the news-papers was the chief city of Poland, he believed there was a town of the same name somewhere in Spain, and it was a very easy matter to mistake the one for the other.</P>
<P N="3">3. Into such shameful blunders do young ladies fre∣quently fall, from their ignorance of geography; and to such pitiful shifts must their friends have recourse to save them the blush of confessing their ignorance. But the knowledge of geography will effectually pre∣vent your committing any blunders of this kind, as it will teach you the names of all the principal towns in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orld. Nor is this all; it will further acquaint
<PB N="100" REF="037446_0101_100D0D42E5CD5E40"/>
you with the climate, the soil, and produce of all the different parts of the earth; and with the customs, manners, government, and religion of the several in∣habitants; by which means you will be enabled to talk pertinently on most subjects that occur in conversation.</P>
<P N="4">4. But there is still a higher part of geography, which, however, I dont think to be above the capa∣city of a young lady; I mean that which treats of the figure of the ear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h; of its turning round its own axis once in twenty-four hours, which occasions the suc∣cession of day and night; and round the sun once a year, which causes the regular changes of the seasons: besides a variety of other truths, equally curious and entertaining, which will greatly open and enlarge your mind, and free it from a thousand prejudices, that cloud the minds of the ignorant.</P>
<P N="5">5. What an infinite pleasure it is for a lady to sit in her own room, and, by the use of the globe or maps, to examine all the various parts of the earth, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> travel, as it were, in the space of a few hours, ove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e whole world!

<P N="1">1. SOME weeks ago, I received a letter from Mrs. Bromley, in which she commends you for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="101" REF="037446_0102_100D0D7ABB0348D8"/>
sweetness of your temper, and your great improve∣ment in the needle. To say that I was glad on this occasion, is flat and unmeaning: I was over-joyed: I felt an emotion of pleasure, known only to those who have a daughter whom they love with the same warmth of affection. Go on, my dear Sophy, thus to increase the happiness of your mother, by consult∣ing your own interest; and, indeed, you cannot con∣sult it more effectually, than by making yourself a complete mistress of the needle.</P>
<P N="2">2. For though there are many other female accom∣plishments more showy and specious, yet there is not any one more useful; nay, I may venture to say, there is none equally so. What an infinite number of the female sex, and, perhaps, the most virtuous part of it too, live by the needle! How greatly does it con∣tribute to render our persons more decent, more agree∣able, and more beautiful! What a surprising differ∣ence is there between the appearance of Lady Morton whom you have often seen at church, &amp; Dol Comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the cinderwench. And yet this difference is chiefly owing to dress; and dress depends chiefly on the needle. Be∣sides, as you advance, you will have such patterns set you for sewing, as will, at once, entertain and im∣prove your fancy, and enable you the better to learn the art of drawing, which is one of the highest parts of your education.</P>
<P N="3">3. After all, my dear, I do not desire you to apply to your needle so as to hurt your eyes, or weaken your constitution: far from it. On the contrary, I would have this, and all your other studies, carried on in a perfect consistency with your health, which is never to be sacrificed to any consideration whatever. All I mean is, that you should not neglect this qualification as useless, nor despise it as mean, or beneath a gentle∣woman. Useless it cannot be, for there is no station

of life in which a woman can be placed, where it is not highly serviceable, and, for the most part, abso∣lutely necessary. And it is so far from being mean and unworthy the character of a gentlewoman, that I will venture to say, there never was an accomplished woman without a competent skill in this art. Of the truth of this I may, perhaps, endeavour to convince you in some other letter. Mean while I conclude, by recommending you to the divine protection, and am</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Mamma,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P N="1">1. I HAVE received several letters from you of late; and indeed nothing gives me so much pleasure; as they contain an account of your own welfare, and that of the rest of the family, with the most tender ex∣pressions of love, and the best directions for pursuing my studies. How shall I ever repay the obligations you are daily laying upon me! I never can; nor do you expect it. The only return, I know, which you desire, is, that I should, at last, become a virtuous and accomplished woman; and, if I do not, I must certainly be reckoned the most inexcusable creature in the world; as few are blessed with so many advanta∣ges. But, I hope, you shall never have reason to complain of my negligence: I am sure you never shall of my want of duty and obedience.</P>
<P N="2">2. I enjoy a very good state of health, and am as happy as I could wish in every respect. Mrs. Brom∣ley is very agreeable in her behaviour, and very rea∣sonable in her commands, except that, I think she is rather too strict and peremptory with regard to the ar∣ticle of cleanliness: for we must, every day, appear

at dinner, as neat and clean as if we were going to church. Now this consumes a great deal of time, which, I imagine, might be employed to better pur∣pose. Please to give me your advice on this subject in your next letter. I have no more to add, but to offer my duty to my papa and you, and my love to my brothers and sisters.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VIII. FROM PORTIA TO HER DAUGHTER SOPHIA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Sophy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P N="1">1. YOUR last letter, which I received some weeks ago, gave me the greatest pleasure. You are as much improved in your writing as I could have wished; and more indeed than I could have expected. Your expressions of duty and obedience are extremely agreeable: they, at once, discover a good heart and a clear head. Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear, because you can never repay the favours I have done you. I am repaid already. I enjoy as much pleasure in bestowing, as you can possibly do in receiving them; and, if I should have the additional happiness to see you become a polite and virtuous woman, I shall be doubly rewarded.</P>
<P N="2">2. To receive favours from a stranger, indeed, which we can never return, is always disagreeable, and sometimes dangerous. But, with parent and child, the case is very different. The connexion between them is so close by nature, that all the good offices in the world can hardly make it closer. I am glad to hear that you live so happily. It is no more than I had reason to expect, from the sweetness of your own disposition, and the prudence of your governess; and I should be sorry if you considered her orders, with
<PB N="104" REF="037446_0105_100D0D47635FAA00"/>
regard to cleanliness, as any diminution of your hap∣piness; for she is certainly in the right.</P>
<P N="3">3. Cleanliness, my dear, is a habit, I had almost said a virtue, which you cannot learn too soon, nor retain too long, both from a regard to yourself, and to the world around you. It will, at once, contribute to the ease and health of your body, and be the means of introducing you into polite and genteel company; at least, the opposite extreme of dirtiness will certain∣ly deprive you of that advantage; it will either make your company to be shunned; or, if that cannot be done, it will always render your presence disagreeable.</P>
<P N="4">4. But beware, my dear, that you do not confound cleanliness with finery; nor mistake the one for the other. They are as distinct in their nature as any two things can well be; and, though not inconsistent, are frequently found to be separated. A woman may be very neat and clean, in a plain and simple dress; and she may be very dirty and tawdry, in a fine and costly one. There is Miss Molesworth: She never wears any thing above a plain silk gown; but that, and all the other parts of her dress, which are equally simple, she puts on and adjusts with such elegance and propri∣ety, as pleases the eye of every one that beholds her: whilst Lady Dormer, on the contrary, though drest in the richest satin brocade, and loaded with a profusion of jewels and pearls, is, after all, so slovenly and taw∣dry, that she may rather be said to <HI>carry</HI> her clothes like a porter, than to <HI>wear</HI> them like a well-drest lady.</P>
<P N="5">5. I therefore expect you will obey your governess's orders in this, and in every thing else, because I am confident she will never order you to do any thing but what is just and reasonable, But you say, it consumes a great deal of time: I am persuaded you will always find as much as you ought to bestow (in order to be near) between the time that is usual for leaving off
<PB N="105" REF="037446_0106_100D0D7FB18B8090"/>
school, and that of going to dinner. Besides, it will, every day, require less, for the more you practise it, the easier it will become; and a twelve month hence, I dare say, you will be able to dress yourself as well in half an hour, as you can do, at present, in a whole one. You may likewise consider it as a kind of di∣version or relaxation from more serious business; and diversions, you know, of one sort or other, you must have. Your papa, your brothers and sisters join in love to you.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Mamma,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P N="1">1. I RECEIVED your very kind letter, and am greatly obliged to you for your good advice, which I shall ever consider in the light of a command. I think myself bound in duty to obey all your orders; whether I understand the reasonableness of them or not; tho ever since I was capable to distinguish right from wrong, you have always had the good-nature and condescension to convince me, that whatever you desired me to do was for my own interest and advantage.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is still another particular, in which I must beg your advice; as I am resolved to do nothing with∣out your permission. What I mean is the choice of my friends: for, though we are commonly all in the same room, yet I have no more than a general ac∣quaintance with any one of my fellow boarders. I have not contracted a friendship and intimacy with any one of them. I might indeed have done it long ago. I have had frequent opportunities. I have been invited, and even importuned to it. But, sensible of my own incapacity to judge for myself, I have decli∣ned

all their offers of friendship, and still kept myself on general terms with them. Some say I am spirit∣less; some call me shy; and others think I am proud▪ But I am the less concerned what they either think or say, if you approve of my conduct.</P>
<P N="3">3. I do not choose to find fault with the behaviour of any of my companions. They are all as good, per∣haps they are better than I am; and, I know, you would condemn any thing that had the least appearance of detraction.

<HEAD>LETTER X. FROM PORTIA TO HER DAUGHTER SOPHIA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Sophy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P N="1">1. HOW shall I express the joy I received from the perusal of your last letter! how happy am I in having a daughter, who, at an age, when most young ladies imagine they can think and act for them∣selves, is so humble and dutiful, as to undertake no∣thing without the permission and advice of her mother! But can't I conceal my joy within my own breast?— Or, if it must have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent, can't I be satisfied with im∣parting it to others? Why tell it to my daughter? Why, my dear, I tell it to you for two reasons; both
<PB N="107" REF="037446_0108_100D0D81906FBBB0"/>
because I like to think of you, and talk to you, and also because I am persuaded it will be an additional mo∣tive to your persevering in the same virtuous course. For, I believe, you have such a tender regard for my happiness, that, when once you know how greatly it depends on your good behaviour, you will never lessen it by a contrary conduct.</P>
<P N="2">2. And now, after this flow of parental affection, I come to give you my best advice with regard to the choice of your friends. This, my dear, is one of the most important steps in life, and should be conducted with the greatest prudence; otherwise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead of be∣ing a source of happiness and pleasure, as it may and ought to be, it will prove the occasion of much pain and uneasiness.</P>
<P N="3">3. The first thing then, and indeed the principal thing, to be considered, in the choice of your friend, is, that she be entirely free from all manner of vice, and from foibles too, as much as possible; for if she is not, you will be in danger of being corrupted by her bad example. We naturally, and, as it were, in∣sensibly contract the manners of those with whom we converse. In a vicious example, especially, there is a kind of contagion, which rages like a plague, and insects all those who are within the reach of its bale∣ful influence. It undermines our virtue impercepti∣bly. It steals upon us unawares, and takes us by sur∣prise.</P>
<P N="4">4. There is an old proverb to this purpose, which is not the less true for being common, viz. "that birds of a feather flock together▪" by which I think is ge∣nerally understood, that persons of the same sentiments and character are apt to associate with one another. But, I apprehend, it will likewise bear this construc∣tion, which is not so commonly attended to, that, let their tempers and dispositions be ever so different when
<PB N="108" REF="037446_0109_100D0D4B34050828"/>
they meet, yet, by a long and intimate acquaintance, they will, in the end, become nearly alike.</P>
<P N="5">5 But, lest you should not be able to apply gene∣ral rules to particular cases, I shall point out some of the vices and foibles, which you ought chiefly to guard against in the choice of a friend. Above all things, then, let her be free from falsehood and deceit, from hypocrisy and dissimulation. Let her be open, honest and sincere, in all her actions. Sincerity is the foun∣dation, it is the soul of friendship; without this it cannot possibly exist. For how can you cultivate a friendship with one who is always endeavoring to de∣ceive you? Upon whom you cannot depend for the truth of any word she speaks, or the sincerity of any action she performs? A friendship with such a per∣son, if indeed there could be any, would be alarmed and disturbed by perpetual fears and suspicions, which are utterly inconsistent with the nature of this sacred union.</P>
<P N="6">6. Flattery is another vice, nearly a-kin to the for∣mer, and no less an enemy to friendship. It consists in praising us for accomplishments which we do not possess, and in concealing or extenuating the faults of which we are, unhappily, guilty. By the former we are puffed up with a ridiculous pride; by the latter we are lulled into a dangerous, and often fatal securi∣ty. It is the part of a true friend, on the contrary, to inform us of all our foibles and imperfections, and to give us all the assistance in her power to correct and amend them. For how else can we acquire a thorough knowledge of ourselves?</P>
<P N="7">7. The vice directly opposed to flattery is calumny and detraction. It is, of all others, the most odious in its nature, the most pernicious in its effects, and the most inconsistent with friendship. A friend! can that honourable name be bestowed upon one, whose
<PB N="109" REF="037446_0110_100D0D83302DA228"/>
whole life is spent in the low and dirty arts of scandal and defamation? whose greatest pleasure it is to black∣en and sully the reputation of every person she knows. To contract a friendship with one of this temper, would argue the height of folly. You might then ex∣pect to have all your foibles and weaknesses exposed to the view of the whole world, and your character loaded with a thousand blemishes, from which, per∣haps, it is entirely free: like the silly clown in the fable, who finding a snake in the fields, chill'd and benumb'd with cold, put it in his bosom; but no sooner was it recruited by the genial warmth of his body, than it stung him to the quick, and made him pay dear for his ill-judged humanity.</P>
<P N="8">8. Your friend should likewise be free from pride, vanity, and self-conceit. For one that is immoderate∣ly fond of herself, is not likely to be very fond of an∣other; she that has a high opinion of her own accom∣plishments, will probably have but a very low opinion of yours. There is nobody, she imagines, so virtuous as to deserve her affection, or so sensible as to merit her esteem; and without esteem and affection there can be no friendship.</P>
<P N="9">9. Let her have nothing awkward, ridiculous, or affected in her manner. If she has, besides the dan∣ger of being infected by her example, you will fre∣quently be put to the blush on her account. For one blushes for her friend almost as naturally as for herself.</P>
<P>And now, my dear, having thus mentioned some of the principal vices and foibles, from which your friend ought to be free, I should next proceed to consider those virtues and good qualities, which she ought to possess: but this shall be the subject of another letter. In the mean time I conclude, by recommending you to the divine protection, and am,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XI.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Sophy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P N="1">1. AS I would not wish to leave you long undeter∣mined in a matter of so much consequence as the choice of a friend, I have taken the first opportu∣nity, you see, of resuming the subject; and shall now endeavour to point out those virtues and good qualities which you ought chiefly to regard in her character.</P>
<P>First of all, then, my dear, let her be one who is dutiful to her parents: for she that is undutiful to her parents, will never be faithful to you. She that is deficient in this most important of all duties, is not likely to be very observant of any other. And, in∣deed, from a young lady's behaviour in this respect, you may form a pretty just notion of her character in general; for one that is so ungrateful, so unnatural, as to have thrown off all respect and deference to her parents, may, and probably will, run into every other kind of vice and wickedness. Such a person, I hope, you will never make your friend. With such a one I would not even have you to keep company. If you do, you may be worse for it: it is impossible you can ever be the better.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another essential ingredient in the character of a true friend, is humanity and good nature; a certain sweetness of disposition and equality of mind, not to be ruffled by every trifling accident, nor soured by any misfortune. A person, blessed with this happy tem∣per, possesses within herself a perpetual fund of cheer∣fulness and good humour, and diffuses joy and gladness wherever she comes. Pleased with herself, she is the more apt to be pleased with those around her. Slow to anger, she is not provoked by slight offences; and ready to forgive, she never harbours resentment in her breast. As she is happy in her own mind, she delights to communicate happiness to others; and, therefore,
<PB N="111" REF="037446_0112_100D0DBBDAE72178"/>
is willing to cultivate a friendship with any person, that seems deserving of her confidence. And, as she is steady and uniform in her conduct, she never for∣sakes her old friends, unless, by their folly or wick∣edness, they have forfeited all claim to any further regard.</P>
<P N="3">3. In a word, without good-nature, there can be no such thing as friendship. The ill-natured, the peevish, and the passionate, are utterly unqualified for this virtuous intercourse. A heart over-run with these vicious passions, is not susceptible of such fine and delicate feelings. Friendship is a tender plant, and will not grow in such a coarse and uncultivated soil. A passionate person; in the violence of her anger, or rather madness, will say and do a thousand things which are intirely inconsistent with all the laws of friendship; and the misfortune is, that every trifle is sufficient to rouse her passion. The breaking of a Chi∣na dish, the treading on a lap-dog, any thing will do▪ the fuel is within her, and the least spark will kindle the fire, and blow it up into a flame.</P>
<P N="4">4. Secresy, my dear, is another quality, which your friend ought to possess. She that cannot keep a secret, can never be a true friend. For what is a friend? It is one to whom we can unbosom ourselves without reserve; to whom we can impart all our se∣cret thoughts, wishes and designs, without the least fear of being betrayed, or having them exposed to the view of the world. Secrets are of two sorts; those which we would not disclose from the motives of shame, and those which we would not discover from the dictates of prudence. Of the former kind, I am persuaded, you have none as yet; I hope you will never have any. Of the latter, I suppose, you have some already, and the longer you live, you will have the more. But to betray either the one or the other
<PB N="112" REF="037446_0113_100D0D88DFF077C8"/>
is equally unworthy the character of a friend, and e∣qually injurious to us; and she that has acted so base∣ly once, should never have it in her power to deceive us again.</P>
<P N="5">5. The next thing, my dear Sophy, to be consider∣ed in the choice of a friend, is, that her sentiments and dispositions be nearly the same with your own▪ otherwise you can never agree. If you are fond of business, and she of diversions if you love to stay at home, and she to be always gadding abroad; if you delight in plainness and simplicity, and she in pomp and splendour; if you are pleased with sensible and serious conversation, and she with nothing but fun and frolic; if you are fond of reading, and she of ga∣ming; if you are happy in peace and quietness, and she only in crowds and company.—In a word, if you love what she hates, and if she likes what you abhor, there can be no concord and agreement, no sympathy of temper, no harmony of sentiment, no mutual hap∣piness; and without mutual happiness, friendship can not exist</P>
<P N="6">6. After all, my dear, a perfect similarity of taste and sentiment is not to be expected (our minds being as different as our faces) nor, indeed, could it be ob∣tained, do I think it ought to be desired. The fairest characters are stained with many spots and blemishes. The most virtuous persons have many foibles and im∣perfections hanging about them, which they are not likely ever to correct, by conversing only with those of their own cast and complexion. Should the grave converse only with the grave, would they not some∣times be in danger of sinking into dullness? If the gay and sprightly keep company with none but those of the same humour, will they not frequently be apt to soar into—mad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s? By the same practice, the frugal would probably become avaricious, and the ge∣nerous,
<PB N="113" REF="037446_0114_100D0DBE0C6BEE80"/>
prodigal and profuse. It is therefore, my dear, an instance of the greatest wisdom, to cultivate a friendship and acquaintance with those, who are possessed of such virtues and good qualities as are most opposite to our own weaknesses and foibles. Are we subject to melancholy and low spirits? let our friend be a person of cheerfulness and good humour. Are we, on the other hand, too much addicted to levity and mirth? let our friend be more serious and sedate. Are we naturally hot and passionate? let us choose a friend of a cool and calm disposition.</P>
<P N="7">7. Let me, therefore, beseech you, my dear Sophy, by the regard you have for your own happiness, and what, I believe, you value no less, by the regard you have for mine, to be very cautious and careful in the choice of your friend. As you have a great deal of spirit and vivacity, let her be something more compo∣sed and sedate. As, I know, you are very generous and open hearted, let her be more frugal and prudent. In a word, let her possess, as much as possible, all those virtues and good qualities, which you are con∣scious that you yourself most want. Your papa, your sisters and brothers, join me in wishing you all man∣ner of happiness.</P>

<P N="1">1. I HAVE all your letters on the subject of friend∣ship lying by me, and have read them so fre∣quently and so carefully, that, I believe, I could al∣most repeat them by heart. I am greatly obliged to you for the good advice and directions you have given me, and will endeavour to conduct myself according∣ly.

I never imagined that so many qualifications were necessary to form the character of a true friend; but, upon reflection, I am fully convinced it must be so, and that every thing you have said is founded in reason and good sense.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is one young lady here, and indeed but one, who seems to answer the character you have drawn. She is, I think, free from all the vices and foibles, and possessed of all the virtues and good qua∣lities, which you have described. Besides, she has always taken a particular pleasure in my company and conversation, as, indeed, I have ever done in hers. We have a mutual regard and esteem for each other, which it shall not be my fault if I do not soon improve into a settled and confirmed friendship. And, what is a very lucky circumstance, she is to leave the board∣ing-school, and come to town much about the same time with me, which you said would be in a few months. This, however, I don't mention from any desire of changing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> situation sooner than you think proper; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w you, that, by this means, I shall have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in my power to continue and cultivate that friendship in town, which I can only begin here.</P>

<P>I remember, when I was at the boarding-school. I

fondly imagined, that, by the time I was sixteen or seventeen years of age, my education would be entire∣ly finished, and I should have nothing to mind but pleasure and diversion. But what a vain and foolish conceit has it been! I find, on the contrary, that the longer I live, I have the more to learn. I cannot say that I am disappointed in this, as it gives me no pain nor uneasiness; I am rather pleased and delighted wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h it, as it shews that, when we arrive at the years of discretion, we are capable of so many rational ex∣ercises and employments, which we had not the least notion of, whilst we were young and inexperienced.</P>
<P N="2">2. Indeed, it should seem from the conversation of my aunt, that my education is very far from being completely finished: for she says, that, besides re∣viewing the several qualifications and accomplishments I have already acquired, there are many new virtues which I have still to learn. She is perpetually read∣ing lectures to my cousin and me on temperance, chas∣tity, modesty, humility, charity, benevolence, and I don't know how many other virtues, which, she says are the glory and ornament of the female sex. It is true, she is pleased to compliment us by saying, that we seldom transgress against any of these virtues, but alleges, at the same time, that we do not sufficiently understand their real nature and importance, nor how absolutely necessary it is to possess and practise them. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n order to make us happy in ourselves, and agreeable to the world.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIV. FROM PORTIA TO HER DAUGHTER SOPHIA</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Sophia,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P N="1">1. I RECEIVED and read your letter with great, pleasure and satisfaction. As you advance i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> years, your sense of duty and obedience, instead of being diminished, as is too frequently the case with young people, seems rather to be heightened and in∣creased. I am glad to see, that you are sensible <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the folly and vanity of your childish fancies and ima∣ginations, when you was at the boarding-school. The sense of our own folly and ignorance is the best symp∣tom of our wisdom and knowledge, and the surest pledge of our further progress and improvement; but a fond conceit, and high opinion of our own wisdom and knowledge, is the most effectual bar in the way of our ever acquiring either of these excellent quali∣ties. For how should she, who vainly thinks she is wise and learned enough already, ever endeavour to become more so? How should she, who fondly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣agines she wants nothing, put herself to the trouble and labour of procuring what she does not want?— The truth is, a young lady, who fancies that she i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> very wise and very learned, is likely to continue a fool and a dunce all her life.</P>
<P N="2">2. What was your expectation, however, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you was at the boarding-school, is, I dare say, the expectation of ninety-nine in a hundred at that time of life; and 'tis well if they don't conduct themselves accordingly, when they arrive at what are usually
<PB N="117" REF="037446_0118_100D0DC40E52FA18"/>
called, and what indeed ought to be, the years of dis∣cretion. 'Tis very well if they don't imagine, that they have already learned all that can or need be learn∣ed; that they are now women, and accomplished too, and therefore may devote their whole time and atten∣tion to dress, visiting, and diversions. But this, I would fain think, is the fate of very few; and I am confident it will never be yours: you have already giv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n sufficient proofs of your superior sense and pru∣dence▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have already made some progress in those higher kinds of learning which are proper for a lady, and I hope you will continue to go on with the same spirit and alacrity, with which you have begun.</P>
<P N="3">3. Your aunt's lectures, my dear (as you are plea∣sed to call them) on temperance, chastity, modesty, humility, charity, benevolence, and the like, are ex∣tremely proper and necessary. These are virtues, which it is the duty of every young lady distinctly to understand, and carefully to practise: they are, as your aunt justly observes, the glory and ornament of the female sex: they add an inexpressible grace and lustre to all our other qualifications and accomplish∣ments; and without them, wit, beauty, knowledge, and learning are not only useless and insignificant, but what is still worse, pernicious and destructive.</P>
<P N="4">4. A beautiful person, with a vicious mind, is no better than a painted sepulchre, fair and comely with∣out, but ugly and deformed within. A wit, without humanity and good-nature, is a pest and nuisance; like a venomous wasp, or poisonous serpent, she stings and bites every one she meets, without distinction of friend or foe. And a person of knowledge and learn∣ing, without humility and modesty, is generally a va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, conceited, and prattling pedant.</P>
<P N="5">5. On the other hand, a beautiful young lady, if she in virtuous at the same time, becomes by that means,
<PB N="118" REF="037446_0119_100D0D8E742A5EC0"/>
at once more virtuous and more beautiful: more vir∣tuous, because her temptations to vice are more fre∣quent and strong; and every time she resists these temptations, she gives the most convincing proof of her untainted chastity and unspotted honour: more beautiful; for what is beauty? It is not a set of fea∣tures formed with the nicest symmetry and propor∣tion; it is not a complexion composed of the purest red and white: no; but it is both these informed, in∣spired, lighted up, and animated by the emanations of a virtuous mind: it is chastity, modesty, good-nature, compassion, benevolence, and all the other virtuous dispositions and tender affections streaming forth from the eyes, those windows of the soul, and playing in every lineament of the face. Unless these virtuo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> prevail in the soul, and are strongly marked and ex∣pressed in the countenance, the finest features and complexion are little better than the face of a painted baby, or lifeless statue: all is dull, dead, and inani∣mated; or, what is still worse, gloomy, sour, and sullen.</P>
<P N="6">6. Hence the graceful blush of modesty, and the pleasing smile of good-nature, so frequently and so awkwardly affected by those who are possessed of nei∣ther of these virtues, but perhaps are remarkable for the opposite vices: no matter, they are paying a com∣pliment to virtue; they confess, by their hypocr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sy and dissimulation, that the appearance of it is amiable and lovely; and if the appearance of it be lovely, how much more must the reality be so? The truth is, virtue is the only thing that is good and amiable:— sense, wit, knowledge, and learning, are in their own nature, indifferent; they are either good or bad, just as they are well or ill employed. In the hands of a virtuous person, they may be the means of much good, in the hands of a vicious person, they may be the
<PB N="119" REF="037446_0120_100D0DC5966AE058"/>
means of much ill: but, virtue, in its own nature and consequences, is certainly and infallibly productive of happiness, as well to the person possessed of it in par∣ticular, as to the world in general.</P>
<P N="7">7. Hence too, my dear, you will easily perceive what, I believe, you never dreamed of before, that no young lady can be beautiful without virtue. This opinion; I dar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> say, will m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e you stare.—What! are there not several ladies in London, who have for∣feited all title to virtue and honour, and notwithstand∣ing are reckoned among the greatest beauties of the age? are courted, caressed, and almost adored, by crowds of young gentlemen. But softly, my dear, and don't be in such a hurry; allow me only to ask you a single question: what is the character of these same young gentlemen? are they men of sense, judg∣ment, taste, learning, knowledge, and virtue? or, are they not rather the vain, the ignorant, the silly, and foolish, a parcel of empty coxcombs, and abandoned debauchees?</P>
<P N="8">8. Why, as for that, you'll say, you can't answer. But if you cannot answer for that, my dear, how can you be sure, whether these ladies are beautiful or not? For if the young gentlemen, that admire and adore them so much, are not proper judges of beauty, all their praises and compliments go for nothing; they are but mere empty sound, without sense or meaning.</P>
<P>Suppose, my dear, a deaf person were to tell you, that Miss Manley had a charming voice: or a blind one, that Lady Aston had a fine complexion; would you believe them, pray? No, you'll reply; because the one having lost the sense of hearing, can be no judge of sounds; and the other, having lost the sense of seeing, can be no judge of colours: and so far you are right.</P>
<P N="9">9. Now, what if I should undertake to prove that
<PB N="120" REF="037446_0121_100D0D91DEC24098"/>
these young gentlem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n are almost as improper judges of beauty, as the deaf person is of sounds, or the blind one of colours? that they have either lost entirely, or at least greatly corrupted and depraved, those fine and delicate feelings, which alone can distinguish true and genuine beauty, from that which is false and spurious. I don't pretend, my dear, to be a philosopher, and tho I were, I know it would be extremely improper to entertain you with abstruse and refined speculations: which, perhaps, you could not understand, or, if you did, could be of no real use to you in the conduct of life. But this, I imagine, is a thing, which is obvi∣ous to common sense: and, besides, it may be of ser∣vice to you, as it will teach you what opinion to form of these empty fellows, and to pay no greater defer∣ence to their judgment than it deserves.</P>
<P N="10">10. Allow me, therefore, to ask you a few ques∣tions, and you'll find that your own answers will prove the point in dispute. First of all then, my dear, do you think it possible for a person, who has lost all sense of chastity and modesty himself, to be a proper judge of the expressions of these virtues in others? 'Tis absolutely impossible!</P>
<P N="11">11. For it may be affirmed in general, that every deviation from the paths of virtue, every indulgence in criminal pleasure, has a natural tendency to vitiate the taste, to corrupt the heart, and to stifle and extin∣guish all the finer feelings and affections of the mind. A person immersed in sensual pleasure, grows less and less rational every day: he degenerates by quick de∣grees, till at last he sinks down into a mere animal▪ and loses all relish for every thing that is virtuous, noble, and manly.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XV.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Sophy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P N="1">1. MY time for some months past has been so en∣tirely engrossed with company and business, that I have been obliged, in some measure, to inter∣rupt my epistolary correspondence. But now being somewhat more at leisure, I shall resume the subject of your education.</P>
<P>In my two last letter, you know, I endeavoured to explain to you, as well as I could, the nature of temperance, and to convince you of the great utility and importance of that virtue. In this I shall give you my sentiments of another virtue, which is, no less, or rather, which is infinitely more necessary; nay, I will venture to say, which is the most necessary and indispensible of all others, and without which, wit, beauty, sense, knowledge, and every other female ac∣complishment, are not only useless, but even perni∣cious and destructive.</P>
<P N="2">2. You will easily guess, my dear, that the virtue I mean is chastity, the greatest glory and ornament of our sex, and what most effectually recommends us to the love and esteem of the other. Perhaps I may be accused of indelicacy, in entertaining a lady, so very young as you are, with a discourse on such a tender subject; though, I think, the character I bear as your mother, and consequently the concern I must have for your happiness, may well free me from any imputa∣tion of that kind: for I do not see how any thing can be called indelicate, which a virtuous mother can write to a virtuous daughter. Besides, as it will be allowed to be extremely difficult, and, perhaps, even impossible, to fix the precise time when a young lady should receive instructions on this head, every mother of consequence is left, in a great measure, to follow her own judgment; and, I must confess, it is my o∣pinion,
<PB N="122" REF="037446_0123_100D0D9382E15DA0"/>
that it is much better to be a whole year too early, than one day too late: the inconveniences of the former method, if indeed there be any, are very trifling and inconsiderable; but the bad effects of the latter are always dangerous, and frequently fatal and irreparable.</P>
<P N="3">3. Young as you are, my dear, you cannot be ig∣norant of what I mean by the virtue of chastity: and therefore I shall observe the rules of delicacy so far, as not to explain the nature of it more particularly. Al∣low me only to mention a few things, which may serve to convince you of its inestimable value; and to give you a few plain directions, by the observance of which, you may easily preserve it pure and untainted.</P>
<P>Whilst a young lady is possessed of this virtue, she is blessed with the approbation of her own conscience, beloved and caressed by her friends and relations, es∣teemed and respected by all her acquaintance. But if, by some unlucky and fatal accident, she is once de∣prived of this precious jewel, that moment she loses all inward peace and tranquility of mind; she is for∣saken and abandoned by her nearest friends and rela∣tions; she is despised and contemned, hissed and hoot∣ed by all the world.</P>
<P N="4">4. Yow know, my dear, the once happy, but now wretched Miss Grey. She was possessed of wit, beau∣ty, sense, knowledge, character, and fortune, in as high a degree, as most young ladies in England; but she was—my heart bleeds when I think on her mi∣serable fate—she was decoyed, deceived, and at last abandoned by a perfidious and inhuman villain. Ba∣nished from her father's house, deserted by her friends, shunned by her acquaintance, and thrown on the wide world! what could she do? or whither could she go? Poverty, shame, infamy, and disgrace, in their most hideous and ugly forms, stared her in the face, and
<PB N="123" REF="037446_0124_100D0DCA49E74358"/>
drove the poor desponding and distracted creature into a course of life, at the very thoughts of which she would once have shuddered with horror. Her father stript her of her fortune, the world deprived her of her character, her wit degenerated into obscenity, her beauty was changed into deformity, and her sense and knowledge served only to render her more dexterous and expert in the ways of vice and wickedness.</P>
<P N="5">5. In this picture, my dear, which is as true as it is terrible, you see the dangerous and destructive con∣sequences of lewdness and debauchery: tremble at the very thoughts of such an abominable vice; and learn, from the folly and misery of others, to be wise, vir∣tuous, and happy yourself.</P>
<P>Do not imagine, my dear, that what I have now said is only my own private opinion: no; it is, and ever has been, the opinion of the wise and good, in all ages and nations of the world. In some particular countries especially, this virtue of chastity has been held in such high repute and estimation, that rather than lose it, or survive the loss of it, some have even chosen to be deprived of life itself.</P>
<P N="6">6. It is reported of one Lucretia, a Roman-lady, that having been ravished by Sextus, eldest son to Tarquin, the king of that country, she took a dagger in her hand; and, after having publicly exhorted her relations to revenge her injury on the barbarous ravish∣e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, she plunged it in her bosom, at once putting an end to her life and to her disgrace. And such was the opinion which the Romans entertained of the heinous nature of this crime, as well as of the fatal consequen∣ces which followed the commission of it, that the whole nation rose in arms, and not only dethroned the king, and banished the royal family, but even, if I may speak so, banished kings in general, making a decree, that, for the future, no king should ever sway
<PB N="124" REF="037446_0125_100D0D9525BF9AD0"/>
the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eptre over the Roman people, but that their go∣vernment, instead of a monarchy, should thencefort<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> become a republic.</P>
<P N="7">7. I dare say, my dear, you have heard the common observation, that chastity is as necessary and ornamen∣tal in a woman, as courage is in a man: but, in fact, it is infinitely more so. For though perhaps a coward may be as contemptible among the men, as a prosti∣tute is among the women, still there is this material difference between the two cases, that if a man loses his character for want of courage, in one instance, he may, by some extraordinary effort of valour, recover i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in another; but a woman's character once lost, can never be regained: like a fallen star, she sets to rise no more. Not floods of tears,—not whole years of sorrow and repentance,—not the most constant prac∣tice of all the other virtues of a good life,—not even the most rigid observance of the rules of chastity for the future,—nothing will avails; they can never re∣store her lost reputation, nor replace her in the rank of pure vestals.</P>
<P N="8">8. And this single consideration, methinks, were i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but deeply impressed on the minds of young ladies, might of itself be sufficient to preserve their chastity incorrupted, and to make them tremble and shudder at the most distant apprehensions of losing a treasure, which is so precious in the possession, and so irrecover∣able when lost. But, as our best and firmest resolu∣tions are frequently overpowered by the strength and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umber of temptations, I shall point out some of the principal incentives to lewdness, which you ought carefully and constantly to avoid.</P>
<P N="9">9. First of all then, my dear, let me advise you to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hun all kind of luxury and intemperance, which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bly an enemy to this virtue of chastity. For it not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y inflames the blood, and raises the passions; but▪
<PB N="125" REF="037446_0126_100D0DCC7A9208A8"/>
at the same time, darkens and clouds the mind, and renders it less capable to resist and regulate the inferi∣or appetites. It deb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and corrupts the heart: it gives us too strong a relish for the pleasures of sense, and too great a disgust for those of a rational nature▪ It takes off from that purity of thought, that delicacy of sentiment, that fine sensibility, if I may speak so, which recoils and starts back at the least appearance of any thing that is gross, indecent, or immoral. But temperance has a quite contrary effect: it keeps all the inferior appetites in due subordination to the di∣rection and government of reason, and preserves the faculty of reason itself clear and strong; clear, to perceive the most distant approaches of danger<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and strong, to repel the most violent assaults.</P>
<P N="10">10. Shun likewise, my dear, with the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and diligence, every thing that can offend a modest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or a chaste ear; all indecent pictures and representa∣tions, all lewd and immodest language. Indeed the first part of this advice, it will be no easy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to observe; for it is a melancholy truth, that the dining and drawing rooms of many people, even sometimes of the most virtuous and religious, are adorned, or rather disgraced, with such paintings and engravings, as are fit only for houses of bad fame.</P>
<P N="11">11. With regard to the other part of the advice there is no less danger. It is true, you will never hear any lewd or indecent language from the chaste and modest part of your own sex; and with such only, I hope you will converse. Nor, indeed, will you ever hear any thing of this kind from the sensible and virtuous part of the other sex; but of these how inconsiderable is the number! What a small proportion do these bear to the foolish and the vicious! to the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ley her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of empty fops, vain fribblers, shallow coxcombs, and abandoned rakes! who, recommended, forsooth, ei∣ther
<PB N="126" REF="037446_0127_100D0D96EA5DDEF8"/>
by their rank or fortune, or supported, perhaps, by more impudence, intrude themselves into almost every company, where they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fall to shock and offend the chaste and delicate ear, by their lewd and immodest language. 'Tis ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to say, whether these empty fellows are most the objects of pity, contempt, or detestation.</P>
<P N="12">12. These, my dear, are the pests and plagues of all genteel company, from which, therefore, they ought to be expelled and banished without form or ceremony: without regard to rank, family, fortune, or any other consi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eration whatever: let them first learn to behave like gentlem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, and then they may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pect to be treated as such.</P>
<P>You will think, my dear, that I express myself <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> warmth and severity against th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se debauch∣ed and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> rake<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and no wonder that I do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> frequently been obliged myself, and I have know<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> many others obliged to leave several agreeable companies, merely to shun their rude and impertinent language.</P>
<P N="13">13. Another great preservation of chastity is, care∣fully to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tain from reading all plays, novels, or ro∣mances, that have the least tendency to corrupt and debauch the heart. What those are, I will not take upon me to say; for having never read any of them myself, I don't so much as kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w their names. But, as in this respect I have already advised you to con∣duct yourself by the direction of your aunt, I need not be more particular.</P>
<P>I might mention several other methods, which are very conducive to the preservation of chastity; but these will come to be considered more properly under the article of modesty.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, however, let me entreat you, my dear Sophy, to implore the aid and assistance of
<PB N="127" REF="037446_0128_100D0DCEADE9B920"/>

<HEAD>LETTER XVI. FROM SOPHIA TO HER MOTHER PORTIA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Mamma,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P N="1">1. YOUR letters on temperance and chastity I re∣ceived in due course. My aunt, I believe, who carefully inspects every part of my conduct, will do me the justice to acknowledge, that I have always been pretty observant of both these virtues. The rules of temperance, I think, I have never transgressed in any material instance; and, I am sure, I never had the least inclination, nor ever discovered the least propen∣sity to violate those of chastity. But, I must confess at the same time, that till the receipt of your letters, I never understood the nature of these virtues so di∣stinctly, nor was so fully convinced of their great va∣lue and importance. Your last letter, especially, has made such a deep impression upon my mind, that me∣thinks I could now sacrifice every thing to the preser∣vation of my chastity: rather than lose my honour, I would cheerfully lose my life.</P>
<P N="2">2. Poor Miss Grey, mamma, I remember extreme∣ly well, and had formerly heard some indistinct ac∣count of her misfortune; but never knew that her condition was so deplorable and desperate as you re∣present it. The short but affecting history you wrote me of her miserable fate, pierced me to the very heart,
<PB N="128" REF="037446_0129_100D0D99B648CA20"/>
and made the tears gush into my eyes: I am sure I shall never forget it so long as I live.</P>
<P>But, my dear mamma, what I have chiefly to beg of you at present, is, that you will be so good as to write me your sentiments of the virtue of modesty, which I think you gave me some reason to expect by what you said in the close of your last letter. I am the more anxious to have your opinion of this matter, as it is a subject on which my aunt has lately lectured my cousin and me pretty severely.</P>
<P N="3">3. She alleges, that we are very often faulty in this respect, but owns, at the same time, that our faults seem chiefly to proceed from ignorance. This, how∣ever, she will not allow to be a sufficient apology; for though ignorance, she says, be less criminal than impudence, yet it is far from being excusable in young ladies of our age and education. Besides, she assures us, the world will be more apt to impute such faults to want of modesty than to want of sense; for that, when the same action may proceed from different mo∣tives, few people have the humanity and good nature to ascribe it to the best. Please to give my duty to my papa, and my kind love to my sisters and brothers. My aunt presents her compliments to you and the rest of the family.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVII. FROM PORTIA TO HER DAUGHTER SOPHIA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Sophy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P N="1">1. YOUR last letter, which I received a few weeks ago, gave me the greatest satisfaction. I was particularly pleased to hear you express such a noble resolution of preserving your chastity pure and untaint∣ed. May God Almighty assist you in this, and in ev∣ery
<PB N="129" REF="037446_0130_100D0DD04319DE78"/>
other virtuous undertaking. Agreeably to my own promise, and in compliance with your desire, I shall now give you my sentiments of modesty, and some other female virtues. Modesty, my dear, is the outward expression of a pure and chaste mind: and therefore, every w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you speak, every action you perform, every gesture of your body, every look of your eyes, every part of your dress; in fine, every thing, by which the inward dispositions of the mind can be expressed and discovered, comes under the re∣gulation of this virtue.</P>
<P N="2">2. Modesty, as it relates to dress, has already been considered under that article: as it relates to conver∣sation, it has been, in some measure explained, in treating of that and the subject of chastity. After the advice I then gave you, to shun the lewd and immo∣dest conversation of others, it would certainly be un∣necessary to use any other arguments to dissuade you from running into the same error yourself. There is something in this practice so base and vulgar, as well as so, indecent and abominable, that I will not even suppose you capable of a thing at once so unpolite and immoral.</P>
<P N="3">3. But, my dear, modesty regards not only the mat∣ter of your conversation, but also the manner of it; not only what you say, but likewise how you say it. And, indeed, this is such an essential part of modesty, that it frequently appears more visibly in the manner of expressing a thing than in the nature of the thing itself. There is Lady Langley; she returns thanks for a favour, and to people as good as herself too, with such a careless and indifferent, and sometimes indeed with such a haughty and overbearing air, that a by∣stander, who only observes her manner, would be apt to conclude, that she was rather bestowing one upon some of her dependants, or giving orders to her foot∣man:

whilst Miss Boo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hby, on the other hand, even bestows a favour with that engaging and winning ad∣dress, with that humility and condescension, that one wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld really imagine, she was rather receiving, than conferring an obligation.</P>
<P N="4">4. Nothing, my dear, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> inconsistent with modesty, than to talk with a loud, shrill, and harsh tone of voice. This is very unbecoming even in a man, but much more in a woman, and most of all in a young woman, whose accent should be low, smooth and gentle, an emblem of the inward softness and de∣licacy of her mind. It is no less inconsistent with the rules of modesty, to talk in a positive and peremptory strain. This is scarce tolerable, even when you are talking of things that cannot be contradicted; but i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> absolutely intolerable, when you are speaking of mat∣ters that are of a doubtful nature, as indeed most sub∣jects of conversation are. 'Tis the duty of a young lady to talk with an air of diffidence, as if she propo∣sed what she said, rather with a view to receive infor∣mation herself, than to inform and instruct the com∣pany.</P>
<P N="5">5. Modesty, as it regards the countenance, and es∣pecially the expression of the eyes, is no less worthy of your attention, because, perhaps, it appears more in this than in any one thing whatever. Young as you are, my dear, you cannot be ignorant, that all the different passions of the mind may be painted and expressed in the countenance. Anger and meekness, joy and sorrow, love and hatred, pride and humility, impudence and modesty, have each a particular air of the face, naturally adapted to express them; and what∣ever passion happens to be uppermost in the mind, the countenance will take its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and complexion from thence. Thus joy is expressed by a pleasing smile, sorrow by a dejected look, pride by a superci∣lious
<PB N="131" REF="037446_0132_100D0DD1E335A818"/>
frown, humility by an unassuming air, impu∣dence by a wanton glance, modesty by a chastifed mien, and so of the rest. And though I am no great friend to physi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gnomy, or the judging of people's characters by their looks, yet, I believe, there is something in it. Tho I know the face is sometimes a false glass, still I am persuaded it is as often, and much oftener, a true one; and that the countenance is frequently a faithful picture of the mind.</P>
<P N="6">6. In a word, my dear (for I must repeat it to you again) the only way to have a modest look, a modest gait, or a modest behaviour in general, is to have a modest mind. Without this, all the formality, gra∣vity, and grimace in the world, will signify nothing: for, though by this means you may be able to impose upon the thoughtless and ignorant, yet the sensible and judicious observer will always see through the mask, and perhaps but despise you the more for your hypo∣critical solemnity. But, my dear, do not mistake me, While I advise you to be modest, I do not advise you to be sheepish and bashful; far from it. Modesty and sheepishness, however alike they may be in appear∣ance, are as different in their nature, as any two things can well be. A modest person will not talk too much or too high in company, because she knows it is im∣proper: a sheepish person will hardly talk at all, or at least not so as to be understood, because she is afraid. A modest person looks with a decent assurance: a sheepish one is abashed, and blushes at she don't know what. A modest person will never contradict the ge∣neral taste of the company, unless it be inconsistent with decency and good manners: a sheepish person will hardly contradict it, even when it is. The one acts from principle, the other from mere instinct: the one is guided by the rules of right reason, and there∣fore is consistent in her conduct: the other is guide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="132" REF="037446_0133_100D0D9D9896E048"/>
by no rules at all, and consequently has no uniformi∣ty of character.</P>
<P N="7">7. This sheepishness naturally leads to, and com∣monly ends in, a kind of false modesty, which is such an extreme degree of complaisance, such a yielding sostness of nature, as is not able to refuse any thing. A person of this character has no choice of her own: she resigns her own judgment, and is content to be di∣rected by the judgment, or rather by the humour and caprice, of other people. When any thing is propo∣sed, she never examines whether it be reasonable, but only whether it be fashionable; and if it is, she is satisfied: she asks no more: she will comply with it, let the consequence be what it will. She is ashamed to refuse any thing that is fashionable, however vi∣cious; or to do any thing that is unfashionable, how∣ever virtuous. Should it ever become unfashionable to go to church, or to be obedient to parents, or even to observe the rules of modesty, it is ten to one but she would be ashamed to perform any of these duties; so that, from an excess of modesty, she perhaps might be tempted to violate the laws of modesty itself.</P>
<P N="8">8. Let me, therefore, advise you, my dear Sophy, carefully to guard against false modesty, which is one of the greatest enemies of virtue, and perhaps has be∣trayed young people into as many vices as the most a∣bandoned impudence. Never be so extremely modest as to comply with any thing that is bad, how much soever it may be in vogue; nor ever be ashamed to follow what is good, however singular and uncommon. True modesty, my dear, is meant to be the preserver, not the betrayer of your virtue: it will be a kind of guard and protection to your chastity; it will secure you from the rudeness and impertinence of the impu∣dent and abandoned part of the other sex. There is such a dignity and majesty in a modest behaviour, as
<PB N="133" REF="037446_0134_100D0DD5A138AB50"/>
never fails to command respect: it confounds and a∣bashes even the most profligate, and makes them either ashamed or afraid of giving vent to their low and ob∣scene ribaldry, when they are sure it will be received with a blush or a frown, with contempt or aversion.</P>
<P N="9">9. After all, my dear, I don't mean to recommend to you a stiff, formal, and precise behaviour, no: this is not modesty; it is prudery, which is as far re∣moved from modesty on the one hand, as coquetry is on the other. Modesty does not need any foreign gloss to set it off: it appears most amiable in its own native colours. The prude affects an appearance of more modesty than she really has: the coquette affects an appearance of less. The former will not probably gain credit: the latter certainly will: The prude will not be believed to possess so much modesty as she pretends to, perhaps not even so much as she actually has: the coquette will readily be allowed to have no more than she seems, and possibly even less. Since she is so very anxious to convince the world, that she has little regard for modesty, the world, if she pleas∣es, will be so complaisant, as to believe that she has none at all; whereas they will punish the presump∣tion of the prude, for putting on the appearance of more modesty than she has, by even suspecting the reality of what she actually possesses.</P>
<P N="10">10. The prude is so extremely nice and delicate, that she is offended at every thing: the coquette is so very easy and indifferent, that she is offended at no∣thing. The prude startles at the most innocent ex∣pressions, as rude and indecent: the coquette hears what are really the most rude and indecent, without any concern. The prude has frequently a grave and demure look, when her heart is light and cheerful: the coquette has frequently a gay and sprightly coun∣tenance, when her heart is heavy and sorrowful. The
<PB N="134" REF="037446_0135_100D0D9FCBEDFC50"/>
prude is often silent when she ought to speak: the coquette often speaks, when she ought to be silent. The prude frequently stays at home, when her heart is at the play or opera: the coquette frequently goes to the play or opera, when her heart is at home. In a word, the prude studies to be singular; the coquette to be fashionable: the former wants to pass for a la∣dy of the most rigid virtue; the latter for an agreeable companion. The prude despises the coquette as a giddy fool: the coquette laughs at the prude as a con∣ceited hypocrite; and the lady of true modesty pities them both, as well meaning, perhaps, but mistaken creatures. And objects of pity they certainly are;— for their error proceeds rather from the weakness of their heads, than the badness of their hearts.</P>
<P N="11">11. The one imagines, that a prude is the most ri∣diculous character in the world, and that therefore the farther she is from it, so much the better; the other thinks the character of a coquette still more contempt∣ible, and endeavours to shun it with the same care. Hence the one naturally becomes a coquette, and the other a prude; not so much from a love to the cha∣racter they have assumed, as from a hatred to the cha∣racter they have avoided. Thus, like all fools, while they fly from one vice, they run into its opposite, ne∣ver remembering, that in this, as in most other cases, virtue lies in the <HI>golden mean;</HI> that modesty is the mid∣dle point between coquetry and prudery, both of which are equally ridiculous and contemptible.</P>
<P N="12">12. But, my dear, though the prude and the co∣quette be characters equally ridiculous, still, it mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> be acknowledged, they are not equally dangerous.— The prude has at least the appearance of modesty but the coquette has not even that: and though ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> may be an appearance of virtue, where there is no re∣ality; yet 'tis hardly possible there can be any reality
<PB N="135" REF="037446_0136_100D0DD728300278"/>
where there is no appearance, or (what is worse) where there is an appearance of vice: at least the world will always judge so, because it is only by ap∣pearances they can judge.</P>
<P>Hence it is, that a prude frequently preserves her reputation, after having lost her innocence; whilst a coquette sometimes preserves her innocence after she has lost her reputation. Besides, the coquette is ex∣posed to many temptations, from which the prude is, in a great measure, free. The behaviour of the prude keeps the men at a proper distance; the behaviour of the coquette admits, and even invites them to impro∣per familiarities▪ and how very dangerous these fami∣liarities are, is more easily conceived than expressed: indeed it is from this quarter that our greatest danger arises, as perhaps I may take occasion to shew you in some other letter.</P>
<P N="13">13. But, though the prude be exposed to fewer dan∣gers than the coquette, still she is exposed to some, and to many more than she would be, were she but simply and unaffectedly modest. For, as the world sees that her modesty is partly counterfeit, they will be apt to conclude that it is entirely so, and that it is assumed only to save appearances; and, upon this sup∣position, many attempts will be made on her virtue, which never would have been made, but for her pru∣dery and affectation. And, from a general review of the history of our sex, I imagine, it will appear, that the arts of designing and deceitful men have ruined as many prudes as coquettes; and that almost all those who have been thus ruined, have been remarkable for one or other of these foibles.</P>
<P N="14">14. Let me therefore advise you, my dear Sophy, carefully to shun both these characters, as they are not only ridiculous, but (what is still worse) as they are dangerous. Never affect an appearance of great∣er
<PB N="136" REF="037446_0137_100D0DA290EDBD80"/>
gaiety on the one hand, nor of greater solemnity on the other, than true and unaffected modesty requires. Endeavour to possess your mind with a deep sense and a sincere love of this virtue, and then look and act as nature directs. This, in my opinion, is the only in∣fallible method of having a modest deportment. With∣out this, indeed, your behaviour may be composed, sedate, formal, ceremonious, and what not; but it can never be truly and unaffectedly modest.</P>

<P N="1">1. DOROTHY SCHLOZER, is the daughter of Augustus Lewis Schlozer, professor of Phi∣losophy in the University of Gottengen, and well known as an able politician and historian. She was born August 10, 1770, and in her earliest years, dis∣covered an uncommon share of understanding, which has been since improved by extraordinary application. Her father encouraged perhaps by the success he met with in the care of the education of his present Lady, whom he instructed when only eight years of age, hath had the sole direction of her studies. The pro∣gress she made in her infancy was very rapid. She soon learned to articulate, and at the age of two years and eight months, was taught low German, a lan∣guage almost foreign to her own, and plain needle
<PB N="139" REF="037446_0140_100D0DDB4AD48988"/>
work. Soon afterwards she began the French, not by burthening her infant mind with Grammar rules, but by habituating her to converse with a female ser∣vant a native of France, whom her mother engaged for that purpose.</P>
<P N="2">2. In her fifth year she was taught to read German in its present purity, by books composed for her amuse∣ment by her father. When she was only five years and a quarter old, she received some lessons in Geometry. This deviating from the common way of commencing with arithmetic; but her father wished to try the ex∣periment, and succeded so well, that in a fortnight's time, before she had received ten lessons, she was able to answer very difficult questions. Her progress in the acquirement of modern languages was really a∣stonishing.</P>
<P N="3">3. She soon learned both to read and speak English, Italian, Swedish and Dutch. Having taken a jour∣ney with her father to Rome; in less than five months she was able to talk Italian as fluently as her native tongue—According to the evidence of the <HI>Abbe Denina</HI> in his <HI>Lettere Brandenburghen,</HI> printed at Berlin in 1786. Besides her knowledge of languages, she ap∣plied them to their proper uses, and made herself ac∣quainted with almost every branch of polite literature. Her father has not confined her to the study of any sci∣ence in particular, but she has been led by choice to pay the greatest attention to the Mathematics.</P>
<P N="4">4. Miss Schlozer, though highly celebrated for her erudition, does not neglect what are esteemed the first female accomplishments. She plays upon the harpsicord, and sings with as much taste as she draws and works.</P>
<P>Her person is pleasing, and her dress as unaffected∣ly easy as her deportment. Her knowledge of histo∣ry, and other literary acquirements render her very
<PB N="140" REF="037446_0141_100D0DA603E86590"/>
agreeable in company, for she has too much good-na∣ture to be reserved, and too much sense to be pre∣suming.</P>
<P N="5">5. Her surprising talents and accomplishments be∣coming the general topic of conversation, she was proposed by the great <HI>Orientalist, Michaelis,</HI> as a pro∣per subject for Academical honors. The philosophi∣cal faculty, of which Professor Michaelis is dean, was judged to be the fittest, and the 25th of August was fixed upon, at her own request, for examination. The examination was held at the Dean's house, in the presence of the Professors—Kaestner, Neyne, Gatterer, Meister, Feder, and Kulenkamp.</P>
<P N="6">6. She was introduced by Michaelis himself, and distinguished as a lady, with the highest seat.</P>
<P N="7">7. Several questions were first proposed to her in mathematics, all of which she answered to their sa∣tisfaction.—After this she gave a free translation of the thirty-seventh ode of the first book of <HI>Horace,</HI> and explained it. The examination lasted from five o'clock till half past seven, when she was desired to withdraw for a few minutes, and in her absence unanimously pronounced worthy of the degree of <HI>Doctor of Philo∣sophy!</HI></P>
<P N="8">8, When she was desired to return, and received the hearty congratulations of her examiners, she thanked them for the honor, and told them, she fear∣ed it was conferred too early; but that she hoped to be deserving of it in five years time As soon as she was declared successful, Miss Michaelis, one of the Professor's daughters, presented her with a wreath of laurel, with which, at the request of the Professors, she returned crowned, to her father. Her degree was publicly conferred in the University Church, and her Diploma presented to her, on the grand day of the jubilee, September 17, 1787.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="biography">
<HEAD>LIFE OF MADAME DU CHATELET.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. GABRIELLA-EMILA, Marchioness du Cha∣telet, was descended from a very ancient fa∣mily, of Picardy. She was the daughter of the Baron de Breteuil, introducer of foreign Princes and Ambas∣sadors at court, and was born on the 17th of Decem∣ber, 1706. At a very early age she displayed great strength of genius, and vivacity of imagination. She shewed a peculiar fondness for the Belles Lettres, and deuoted great part of the early period of her life to the study of the ancients. Virgil, above all, was her favorite author. She applied also to the foreign lan∣guages; and, in a little time, made herself so far ac∣quainted with the English and Italian, as to be able to translate <HI>Milton</HI> and <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sso,</HI> with ease.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="142" REF="037446_0143_100D0DA794FF7D00"/>2. Madame du Chatelet, however, did not confine herself to the study of the Belles Letters. Metaphy∣sics and Mathematics were objects also of her pursuit; and Leibnitz, a philosopher equally profound and in∣genious, was the guide whom she chose to direct her in this new path. By close application, she was soon enabled to write an explanation of that celebrated German's Philosophy, under the title of "Institutions of Physics," which she composed pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cipally for the use of the Count Chatelet-Lelomont, her son:— Among other things she requests him to attend to the early improvement of his mind—"You must accus∣tom your mind early, says she, to think; and to find resources in itself; you will be sensible, throughout life, what comfort and consolation arises from study; and you will even see that it can afford pleasure and delight."</P>
<P N="3">3. Madame du Chatelet had too much judgment, and was too ardent in the pursuit of truth to dwell long on the Chimeras of metaphysics; she readily quitted, therefore, the imaginations of Leibnitz, in order to giue herself up to the clean and perspicuous doctrines of Newton. Having by close application, gained a complete knowledge of that eminent Philosopher's principles, she undertook the arduous task of making a translation of them from the original Latin, into French, which published, with an admirable com∣mentary, and by this enterprize rendered an essential service to science; This commentary, which is far superior to the translation, is composed of two parts, and is preceded by a short history of <HI>Astronomy,</HI> from <HI>Pythagorus</HI> to the present time.</P>
<P>When we reflect on the dryness of the subject, and the little analogy it has with the delicacy and vivacity of the fair sex, we cannot help admiring the abilities of the Authoress, and calling to mind the following

</LG>
<P N="4">4. Madame du Chatelet's manners were no less es∣timable than her talents. Though formed by her figure, her rank, and her knowledge, to be distin∣guished from the greater part of those among whom she lived, she seemed never to be sensible of those ad∣vantages which she enjoyed. She was fond of glory without ostentation. A woman, who has no other merit than that of being learned, is certainly wanting in her duty to society: No reproach of this kind can be justly thrown out against Madame du Chatelet, on this head. Her fondness for books never made her forget what she owed to her family; she did not think it below her, to enter into all those details which are required in the management of a family. Instead of delighting in slander, or ridicule, she often became the advocates of those who in her presence, were made the object of either.</P>
<P>She died at Lunneville, in the year 1749, some time after she had been delivered of a child.—She was a member of several foreign academies.</P>

<P>I thought I saw a little girl with you: I hope I have not sent her away.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>N.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but pray let her come again; I would not have her go upon my account; she will be angry perhaps.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>So let her, if she will, I don't care: for, to tell you the truth, I don't love she should come; but my papa has some acquaintance with her father and mo∣ther, and he says they are very good people, and she is a pretty civil child, so will have her here often:— <HI>but,</HI> they are poor folks, and I don't think her fit company for me. However, as to affronting her I cannot easily do it; for if I could, I should have done it long ago.</P>
</SP>

<P>Fanny, I am loth to be always finding fault with you; but you took what I said last time to you so well, that I would fain hope I shall not offend you if I am free in speaking again.</P>

<P>No, Nancy, I will not be angry; for I am sure you speak to me for my good.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>N.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then indeed, Fanny, I am truly sorry to see so much of a haughty temper, as you have discovered towards this child; you know pride is very unbecom∣ing in any person, as well as sinful.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not proud, not I: but I think it is beneath a gentleman's daughter to keep company with such poor children.</P>
</SP>

<P>Then I can assure you, I very often act beneath myself, as you call it; for there's Flora—I suppose you know her; don't you?</P>

<P>Yes, 'tis her; and I can assure you, some of the most pleasant hours I spend, is in that girl's com∣pany.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot tell what you admire in her, indeed, Nancy, I thought you had a better taste, I know her by sight only.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>N.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know her only by sight: and the plain though decent appearance she makes, renders her contemptible in your estimation; but I know her by intimate acquaintance; and a handsome carriage, good temper, wit, and above all, her goodness, renders her an agreeable companion to me, at all times.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not know what she may be, but, in gen∣eral, I hope you'll allow it most proper to keep com∣pany with such as ourselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>N.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I grant 'tis best, when we can to have such for our intimates; on this account, because we are most likely to learn of them a behavior suitable to the rank in which we are placed. But then, when we are with those that are below us, in point of for∣tune, we should treat them with a great deal of ci∣vility and kindness; which by your own account you have not this child we were speaking of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am civil enough to her, I think. Surely you would not have me behave to her in all respects, as if she was a rich man's daughter; would you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>N.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would have you behave towards her as a crea∣ture of the same rank of beings as yourself: and as consi∣dering, that it is God alo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e who made a difference in the outward circumstances of your parents and her's: but pray, before we go any further, what are her pa∣rents? For I thought by the glimpse I had of her she looked pretty well dressed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her father wae designed for a lawyer, and I be∣lieve had a liberal education; but his father through unavoidable misfortunes, not being able to maintain
<PB N="148" REF="037446_0149_100D0DAE69149618"/>
him till he got into business, he was compelled to seek for maintenance in another way, which brings him in scarcely enough to keep them. As to her dress, in∣deed she generally goes neat enough: for her mother was a gentleman's daughter, and she endeavors to have her make as genteel an appearance as she can, with what she has, which is chiefly what her mother pro∣cures from her own relations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>N.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Fanny, <HI>now</HI> I think you more to blame, than I did before I heard this part of your story.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>N.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because, for aught I can find, she came of as good a family as you or I.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>What if she did? I tell you they are very poor now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>N.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, according to your notion, I understand, if my papa should lose his money, and grow poor, you would not care to keep me company any longer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, indeed, I should, Nancy. Why should you entertain such a thought of me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>N.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I can think no otherwise, by what you say yourself. At first I thought you only meant, that you did not like to keep company with the ordinary set of children; but now I find, the chief of your ob∣jections lies in their parents not having just so much money as yours, and not being able to keep them so fine. Now I would only have you consider how you would like it, supposing your papa should lose the most of what he has, as many opulent men have done, (by the unavoidable changes in life) if you found your∣self slighted and despised on that account, and thought unfit company for any of your old acquaintance: what think you of it Fanny, make the case your own?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>F.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess I should think it very hard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>N.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I hope you will see reason to alter both your opinion and conduct, and beware of such a tem∣per
<PB N="149" REF="037446_0150_100D0DE66C4E8F50"/>
and behaviour for the future: for Solomon has told us, that <HI>pride goes before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall.</HI> And so changeable and uncertain is eve∣ry thing in this world, that we know not how soon we who make so great a figure, through our parents p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>osperity, may by their death or losses, be reduced to as low or perhaps much lower condition, than this child is in now; and she may, by providence, be raised to the height from which we fell. My mamma has frequently told me of such instances, to teach me humility, and guard me against a vain boasting of what I at present enjoy.</P>

<P>I was reading in the 2d book of Kings, chap∣ter 2d, about the chiildren that mocked the Prophet Elisha, and how two she bears came out of the wood, and forty-two of them.</P>

<P>That is a very remarkable story indeed; what did you think when you read it?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> made it so wicked in them to say so? For it is to be thought, it was true that the Prophet was bald.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>K.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose it was because they spake it to deride and mock him; did they not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, to be sure they did. They could not think what to say to express their scorn and contempt of this holy man; and so mocked him on account of a natu∣ral defect, which he could not help. And sure, this should be a caution to all children for the future, ne∣ver to express their contempt of others, by mention∣ing any natural, or accidental infirmity or defect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>K.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not think of this use of the story before; but, as you say, it is indeed a very common thing, when we would show our spite against any, to call them crooked, hump backed, bald headed, one eyed, and flat nosed, or whatever other imperfections they
<PB N="154" REF="037446_0155_100D0DB540282558"/>
may have; which this story fully convinceth me is wrong, and very cruel, and displeasing to God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ch.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is indeed; and as my papa told me, when I read it to him, I should consider, that it is both fool∣ish and wicked: it is very base and silly to reflect on any one, for what he cannot help; and it is truly wicked, as it is indeed reflecting on God himself who made us all, and, for wise reasons, only known to him, permitted those defects in nature, or suffered those accidents to befall them, by which they came: and the dreadful lot of these children, methinks, should be enough to check us, whenever we find any inclination, so much as to entertain a thought of this nature; much rather ought we to turn our minds to thankfulness and praise to our beneficent God, who has formed us so perfect, and preserved us from being maimed and deformed by sad disasters.</P>

<SPEAKER>N.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Mamma, I saw several graves that must have been made for children, that were about my size, and are now, very probably, reduced to dust; and I could not help reflecting with myself, that this might have been my case, as well as poor Miss Anthony's, the sight of whose grave, as one of my late dear play fellows, drew tears from my eyes plentifully.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, my dear, you should rather have acknow∣ledged the distinguished mercy and goodness of God, that when he sent that grievous distemper the yellow fever, under which poor Miss Anthony languished, groaned, and died, he did not at the same time, by the same fatal disease, call you to the dark regions of the grave! as he has power to do, my dear, whenever he thinks fit: he can arm death with a thousand darts; and reduce his creatures to dust by various unforeseen and unavoidable accidents and distempers.</P>

<P>Pray, Mamma, what do these two Latin words <HI>Memento meri,</HI> which I observed written upon several tomb-stones, mean?</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why those words, child, have no relation to the sleeping dust; but are designed as an admonition to the living, and to such girls as you, while you are playing in the church yard, and trampling on the dead, to tell you, that you must <HI>remember</HI> death; and, con∣sidering how apt we all are to forget that awful hour, it is necessary we should be often reminded of it.</P>

should have a power of preventing what that God that gave us life and being has decreed for us, and all the human race; do not you remember what your bible tells you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>N.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is that the bible says?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>That it is appointed for all once to die! And surely, he that made us, knows best how to dispose of us, and what time is fittest for our state of trial here! And you may farther remember that the judge of all the earth must do right: he that made us, and brought us first into being, has surely a right to dispose of us as he pleases; and 'tis our great happiness, that we are at the disposal, not only of a being of infinite pow∣er and wisdom, but also of a gracious, benevolent, and merciful God, that is willing to bestow happiness on all his creatures, that act consistent wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h the <HI>rea∣sonable powers</HI> and <HI>opportunities</HI> he has given them, and are not wilfully obstinate and disobedient to his laws. Consider, child, that your thinking of death is not de∣signed to make you unhappy, but quite the contrary; they that often think of it, are most likely to be pre∣pared for it, by not committing any of those sins and iniquities that make them afraid of dying. The child that is disobedient to its parents, that steals, tells lies, breaks the sabbath, or is guilty of any bad actions, is not only afraid, but ashamed to be brought into their presence, either to implore their pardon or to be pu∣nished for his crimes: and is it not a thousand times worse to die in your sins, and be brought into the pre∣sence of God, and there to be sentenced to punish∣ment and misery? For though God is merciful, he is also just; and will certainly appoint such a degree of punishment to all his rational creatures, that die without repentance and remission of their sins, by the blood of his son <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> as is the exact demerit of their iniquities. If you often think of death, you
<PB N="157" REF="037446_0158_100D0DEFB6C7D1A8"/>
will be afraid of sin, as 'tis that alone can make you unhappy in dying. The honest, the faithful, the obe∣dient and the good (such as I hope your play-fellow was that you have so much lamented the loss of) have nothing to fear: they enter upon a state of rest un∣known to us, and shall, at the great day of resurrec∣tion, have their happy souls reunited to their new rai∣sed bodies, and enter upon a state of everlasting hap∣piness, in the glorious society of God, the holy angels, and as the scriptures tell you, the spirits of the just, that are made perfect: and associate again (perhaps) with their <HI>dear departed friends,</HI> in the blessed man∣sions of eternal felicity!</P>

<P>When you talk of the resurrection, Mamma, it seems truly strange to me, how all the scattered dust, that has been dispersed from place to place, and all these rotten bones, that are quite lost and gone, and, perhap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have so for several thousand years, should be all brought together, and every part united into its proper place, as I have been often told they will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>This, child, is quite beyond your comprehen∣sion of mind; but the same Almighty God, who had a power to create us at first, and who breathed into us the breath of life, by which we became living souls, has certainly a power of doing this. And as our bles∣sed Redeemer <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> is become the first fruits of them that slept; as your bible tells you, so certainly, at the last day, he will, by his almighty power, awa∣ken all the sleeping dead, in order to demonstrate, in the face of the whole world, the equity of his proceed∣ings; when the wicked shall be sentenced to misery, and the just and faithful received into mansions of hap∣piness, where they shall be forever with the Lord:— Thus, Nancy, you see, what encouragement you have to pray often to God for his grace, to support you a∣gainst temptations; and to use your utmost endeavors
<PB N="158" REF="037446_0159_100D0DB9B19056D8"/>
to serve him acceptably, and do nothing that may of∣fend him: if you do this, you will always have a hap∣piness in view, that will support you against the fears of death.</P>

<P>WHAT knowledge is the most ne∣cessary?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Master.</SPEAKER>
<P>That of Religion: because nothing but re∣ligion can make us perfectly happy, and without it we must be very miserable, in regard we are subject in this life to divers evils, both of soul and body, and at the last to death: against all which misfortunes, Re∣ligion is our only comfort and remedy, as it supports us under trouble, gives us peace of mind, f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> us from sin and the fear of death, and affords a certain hope of a future eternal life of happiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>In what does Religion consist?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the knowledge of the one true God, and in worshipping and serving him acceptably, and we must believe that God is: that he hath given us laws and commandments to keep; that he will reward all such as observe and do what he hath commanded, and punish those who disobey him, both in this world and in the next.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is God?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>God is a perfect being, greater and more ex∣cellent than all other beings; he is a spirit not of shape parts or body, but invisible, eternal, unchangeable, every where present; he is infinite in power, know∣ledge, wisdom, goodness, justice, holiness, mercy and truth; he is one, and his essence is incomprehen∣sible; he is the maker, preserver and governor of the
<PB N="159" REF="037446_0160_100D0DF1E86C8E78"/>
universe, and of all things therein; these are his at∣tributes, properties or perfections that belong or are ascribed to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>What proofs are there of a God?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>We may prove the being of a God, by the light of reason and conscience, by the general acknow∣ledgment and consent of all nations, and by the holy scriptures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you thus prove there is a God?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>First, by reason, the heavens declare the glo∣ry of God, and the firmament sheweth his handy work. The sun, the moon, and stars; the birds in the air, the fish in the sea, the beast in the field, the herbs, grass and flowers, which grow therein, do all mutu∣ally demonstrate this great truth; for these could not make themselves, nor be the product of chance; but were effected by a divine power who is the first cause of all things, and on whom they solely depend. Se∣condly, By conscience, this is a witness established by God in every man's breast, to preserve the notice and memory of him. We never do our duty, but we perceive a pleasing satisfaction in our minds; and we never transgress, but conscience severely corrects and rebukes us; the truth of this every one knows by ex∣perience. Thirdly, By the consent of all nations; the belief of a God is as ancient as the world, and ac∣knowledged in all ages by all men, both learned and unlearned: and fourthly, by the scriptures: God hath not left himself without good and sufficient witnesses of his having made heaven and earth, the sea, and all things therein, Acts xiv: 15, 17. The invisible things of God from the creation of the world are clear∣ly seen, being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and God-head: Rom. 1, 20. Whatever we observe in nature, in the heavens and upon the earth; and whatever is supernatural, as
<PB N="160" REF="037446_0161_100D0E55529CA218"/>
miracles and prophecies, do all conspire to prove that there is a God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>But might not the world be eternal?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; for we find in the beginning of all things the origin of nations, arts and sciences, the erection of Empires, the time when the several parts of the world were first inhabited; and there is no history a∣bove six thousand years, which proves the world was not eternal, but had a beginning; it must therefore be created by an Almighty Power, and none could do this but God; a being infinite and self existent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is God to us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is our creator, father and lord, and we are his creatures, sons, and servants: and he made us to honor, serve, and obey him, that we may by that means become happy, and attain eternal life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>How many religions are there in the world?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Four; the Christian; the Religion of the Jews, who worship the true God, but do not believe in Jesus Christ; the Religion of the Pagans, who wor∣ship false Gods; and that of the Mahometans, which was set up by the pretended prophet six hundred years after Christ.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which is the true Religion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Christian Religion, which consists in the true God, and in Jesus Christ, John 17, 3. This is life eternal, that they might know the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom he sent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who was this Jesus Christ?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>He was the son of God, the <HI>Messiah</HI> whom God promised to send into the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can this be clearly proved?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; for we find in the birth, life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, the characters of the Mes∣siah which the prophets had foretold, accomplished, in him; that he also wrought many miracles, and
<PB N="161" REF="037446_0162_100D0E285464B018"/>
prophesied many things that afterwards came to pass, and being crucified by the Jews, he raised himself from the dead.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>What proofs are there for this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Jews and other enemies of the Christian Religion agree, that there was formerly in Judea, a man named Jesus, who said he was the son of God; and the histories of Jews and Pagans inform us, that it was in his time, and by him, that this Religion was first set up; and the Jews confess he wrought many miracles, and foretold many things which came to pass after his death, particularly the destruction of Jerusa∣lem, and the establishment of his church throughout the world: and as to his resurrection from the dead, we shall speak of that hereafter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>By whom was the Christian Religion preached?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>By the Apostles; who did not constrain men to embrace it by force, but only had recourse to their preaching and miracles, even when force was made use of against them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>How does it appear that the Christian Religion is true?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>From the very nature of it; for all that it teaches and commands men to believe and do is perfect∣ly agreeable to right <HI>reason</HI> and justice. The Chris∣tian Religion requires nothing but what is reasonable, just, and worthy of God and man; it tends to make order, justice and peace reign amongst men; it sancti∣fies, comforts, and procures them the greatest happi∣ness they can enjoy in this world, and in a future state.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then is there so little religion and piety among men?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because the greatest part do not know the re∣ligion of Jesus Christ, not being well instructed there∣in when young; so that their passions and love to the world have hindered them from considering its beauty
<PB N="162" REF="037446_0163_100D0DF390DC7B88"/>
and excellence: but whoever fairly and candidly exa∣mines, will find, that there is nothing more true, ex∣cellent, or necessary than this holy religion; and if we believe what it teaches, and perform what it com∣mands, we shall be everlastingly happy, or if we fail therein, we shall be eternally miserable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you prove the scriptures to be true?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>By the persons who wrote them, and the things they contain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who are the authors of the Scriptures?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Moses and the Prophets wrote the Old Testa∣ment, the Apostles and Disciples of Christ the new<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and that those men were the authors of those books, is a truth that has been ack<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>wledged by Jews and Pagans, as well as Christians. It is most evident they were men of integrity and piety, and reported what they knew to be true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>But might not the Apostles and Prophets de∣ceive the world?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; because they were inspired by God; and besides, there were a great number of persons who knew that what they wrote was true; and had it been false, their writings would not have been received as divine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you prove the truth of scripture by the things it contains?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>By the histories it relates, by the doctrines it teaches, and by the commandments it prescribes. The sacred history agrees as to time, events, persons and circumstances, with other credible histories, even with the Pagans, who wrote before and after Christ. The doctrines agree with the light of reason, and the na∣tural sentiments of men, such as that there is a God, and future punishments for the wicked, and rewards for the good. The commands are also agreeable to that which nature, reason, and conscience dictate;
<PB N="163" REF="037446_0164_100D0E2AAA813DA8"/>
for that we should fear the deity, be just and tempe∣rate, and not to do to others what we would not have them do to us, are points all men in all ages have be∣lieved and agree in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you prove the scriptures came from God?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because we find several things therein which could come from none but God. As 1st, A doctrine most holy, sublime, and perfect. 2dly, It is accom∣panied with the power of the spirit of God, which sanctifies the heart, and produces inward consolation and joy. 3dly, The miracles which the prophets and apostles wrought, clearly demonstrate that God sent them, and spoke by them. 4th, The prophecies or predictions of things to come, prove it with the great∣est evidence. Many ages before Christ, the Jews had the predictions of the prophets in the Old Testament as we now have; and the three first gospels were pub∣lished long before the destruction of Jerusalem, and other events therein foretold, came to pass.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why were the scriptures given us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>To instruct us in God's will, as to what is necessary for us to do and know in order to be saved: so that it is the only rule of our faith, the only foun∣dation of our Religion, and we ought carefully to read and meditate upon it with an attentive mind, a hum∣ble heart, and a sincere intention to do God's will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>How many parts are there in the Christian Re∣ligion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Two; the first treats of faith, or the truth a Christian ought to believe; the second of our duty, as to what we ought to do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is faith?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>A belief and firm persuasion of the truth which God has revealed in his word; in particular that Je∣sus Christ is the Son of God and Saviour of the world;
<PB N="164" REF="037446_0165_100D0DF5DFF2AA48"/>
that he died for our sins, and hath promised eternal life to all who believe in, and obey him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is the certain mark of true faith?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Obedience to God's commandments; for he that does so, has necessarily the true faith.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where do you find what Christians ought to believe?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the Creed commonly called the Apostles, though not composed by them, nor yet in the form it now is, till long after their death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then do they call it the Apostles Creed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because it is an abridgement of the doctrines they preached, which may be proved from scripture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>How many parts are there in the Creed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Three; in the first, we believe in God the father, who created the world; in the second, in Je∣sus Christ who redeemed us; and in the third, in the Holy Ghost who sanctifies us: and though the name of God is ascribed to each of these persons, yet there is but one only God, for in the divine <HI>nature</HI> there are three persons, the father, son and holy ghost, and these three are all of them but one and the same God: thus we must believe, though we cannot understand it, because it is impossible a finite being should compre∣hend the nature of one that is infinite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why should we believe in the <HI>Trinity;</HI> or, that there are three persons in the Godhead?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because the scriptures reveal it to us, Matth. xxviii, 29. 2 Cor. xiii, 14. John xiii, 14. 1 John, v, 7. 1 Cor, viii, 4.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which is the first article of the Creed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>To believe in God, the maker of heaven and earth, and of all things therein; for on this belief, all Religion is founded.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is it to believe in God?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is 1st, to believe that there is a God, and
<PB N="165" REF="037446_0166_100D0E2D85613A50"/>
but one; 2dly, to serve and worship him, and expect happiness from him alone. In these two, faith and religion do consist. Heb. xi, 6, He that cometh to God, must believe that he is, and that he is a reward∣er of them that diligently seek him. Deuter. vi▪ 4. The Lord our God is one Lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>What doth faith in God oblige us to?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>To acknowledge that we ought to depend on him, to worship, love, and reverence him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is the second article in the Creed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>That God made the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>How did God make it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>He made it by his word, in six days: the or∣der in which God made it, is related in the beginning of Genesis.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is the third thing to believe of God?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>That God governs and preserves the world, and all creatures therein; by his <HI>providence,</HI> and in such a manner, as, that nothing happens without his permission.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it necessary to believe a providence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; because without this belief there would be no Religion among men; for they would neither worship God, thank, nor trust in him: neither fear his judgments, nor hope in his promises.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>What proofs are there of a providence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>First, by this, that there is a God who crea∣ted the world, and which is no less worthy of his no∣tice, that he should govern it. Secondly, The won∣derful order we see in the world obliges us to acknow∣ledge a providence. Thirdly, The extraordinary things that have happened, as the <HI>flood, miracles,</HI> and other events prove, that there is a cause free and al∣mighty, which rules and directs all things. Fourthly, The holy scriptures teach us this great truth: Lastly, The prophecies clearly prove, that God knows and disposes of all events.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="166" REF="037446_0167_100D0DFA2CD78DA0"/>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>What should the doctrines of <HI>providence</HI> teach us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>That we are obliged to God for all the good things we enjoy; that he is privy to and sees all our actions; that we must one day give an account of all ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thoughts, words, and deeds, and therefore we should live <HI>soberly, righteously</HI> and <HI>godly,</HI> that we ought to trust in God, and believe he will grant us whatever is necessary for our souls and bodies; and be thankful to him in prosperity, and patient in adversity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is further to be known?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>That all men were sinners, and therefore Je∣sus Christ came into the world to save them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>In what state did God create the first man Adam?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>He was created good and righteous, pure and innocent, after the image of God; but he did not long continue in this state of innocence, for he fell into sin, by disobeying an easy commandment, which God gave him as a trial of his obedience, viz. Not to eat of the tree of knowledge, of good and evil, in the garden of Eden.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>What were the consequences of Adam's fall?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>It made him and his posterity subject to sin and death▪ by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men; for that all have sinned. Rom. v, 12.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did God leave the world in this condition?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; he taking pity on his creatures, promis∣ed Adam, Abraham, and the Patriarchs, that of the seed of the woman he would raise up a <HI>Saviour</HI> and <HI>Redeemer,</HI> to rescue men from sin, death, and damna∣tion—to which Adam's fall had made them liable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>How did he perform his promise?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>By sending Jesus Christ, to take upon him our nature, to die for our sins, to become our Lord, and
<PB N="167" REF="037446_0168_100D0E2FAFA0B020"/>
the author of <HI>holiness, life,</HI> and <HI>salvation</HI> to mankind; which brings me to the second part of the creed, that of faith in Jesus Christ.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is it to believe in Jesus Christ?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>That there was such a person, who taught us our Religion, and from whom we are called Christi∣ans; that he is the son of God, the promised <HI>Messiah,</HI> the <HI>Saviour</HI> of the world; and that we ought to pro∣fess his doctrine, and obey his commands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>How did Jesus Christ save us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>By his holy and humble life, and by dying a painful death for us upon the cross.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is Jesus Christ God?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; in the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and <HI>the word was God,</HI> John 1, 1. He says of himself, before Abraham was I am, John 8, 58. And the scriptures in many places attri∣bute the perfections of the divine nature to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>What benefits do we receive by the life and death of Christ?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are instructed by his doctrine encou∣raged by his example, and reconciled to God by his death; he hath also in the gospel given us an excellent law and glorious promises, which he has absolute power to perform.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are those promises?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>He hath promised all things necessary for us, namely, to grant us his grace and holy spirit, to ena∣ble us to perform our duty; to forgive us our sins, to hear our prayers, to take from us the sting of death, to raise our bodies from the grave, and unite them to our souls, and to give us life eternal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>How doth Jesus Christ convey these blessings to us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>As being mediator between God and man; and herein we are to consider him as our prophet,
<PB N="168" REF="037446_0169_100D0DFBB4910800"/>
priest, and king; as Christ is a prophet, he taught us his father's will; as a priest, he offered himself a sacrifice to make atonement for our sins, by his most precious blood; and as king, he reigns over all things and is our Lord, patron and judge: we ought there∣fore to trust in him as our only savior, to believe the doctrine he has taught us, and to serve him faithfully, that he may grant us salvation and life eternal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why did Christ humble himself to death?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>That he might expiate and make atonement for the sins of men, and fully satisfy the justice of God; and herein we see the infinite mercy of God, and his hatred of sin, which should make us fear him, and lead holy lives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it necessary to believe that Christ rose again from the dead?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; because the truth of the Christian re∣ligion depends upon it: if Christ is not risen, our faith is vain, 1 Cor. 15, 17.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>How are we sure that he is risen?</P>

<P>Yes; for if the dead rise not, Religion is vain, 1 Cor. xv. and our Lord says, the hour is coming in which all that are in their graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life, and they that have done <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vil, unto the resurrection of damnation, John v, 28, 29.

<P>Why do you call him the Holy Ghost?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because he is most holy in himself, and pro∣duces holiness in the hearts of men: he inspired the prophets and apostles of Jesus Christ, and by his pow∣er the christian religion was established in the world; namely, by communicating to the apostles the gift of working miracles, and of speaking all sorts of langua∣ges, to the end that they might preach the gospel eve∣ry where, and confirm their doctrine by the miracles they wrought; which are now ceased, as the gospel is sufficiently confirmed.</P>

<P>How do you prove this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>The same reasons which prove there is a God and a Providence; that Jesus Christ is the son of God, and Savior of the world; that the holy scriptures are divinely inspired, and that the christian religion is true, do equally prove a future judgment; for had we nothing to fear or hope for after death, all these things would be false: besides, the consciences of men do prove that there is a difference between virtue and vice, by exciting in their minds, fears and remorse when they do evil, affording pleasure and satisfaction when they do well; which would not be so, were there not rewards and punishments after this life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is the belief of a future judgment peculiar to christians?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>The heathens believed that after death there were rewards for the good, and punishments for the wicked; but this doctrine is more clearly described by the gospel; we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done,
<PB N="171" REF="037446_0172_100D0E3388BFE610"/>
whether it be good or evil, 2 Cor. v.10. And then all wicked men, and every worker of iniquity, Christ will condemn to everlasting destruction, from the pre∣sence and glory of God, in the lake that burneth with fire unquenchable; but all virtuous good men, and just, righteous, and religious persons, who have sin∣cerely endeavored to obey the commandments of God, shall be then rewarded with glory unspeakable in the kingdom of heaven, which is the life everlasting.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>How will Christ judge the world?</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>He will judge all mankind, both the dead and living, and punish or reward them according to the good or evil that they have done: when the righteous shall go into life eternal, and the wicked be sentenced to eternal torments, Mat. xxv.</P>

<HEAD>HINTS WITH REGARD TO MAKING PENS FOR DIFFERENT KINDS OF WRITING, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. FOR large text, make a long slit, for it will write free; a point nearly as broad as the shade you intend it for; make the shoulders high, that it may carry a quantity of ink; and, if a large quill, at a considerable distance from the point, to give it a great∣er degree of elasticity:—when you make the point, a perpendicular cut is the best: when you make the slit, hold the edge of the nail of your left thumb upon the back of the quill, where you want to stop at:</P>
<P N="2">2. For running hand, the same directions will an∣swer, only you may make the point a little finer, yet broader than the stroke you intend it for.</P>
<P N="3">3. For very nice writing, make the slit short, little or no shoulder, and the point according to the size of the writing intended.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="instruction">
<HEAD>ATTITUDE FOR WRITING.</HEAD>
<P N="4">4. Do not stoop much; for your breath will damp your paper; and, by contracting your chest, endan∣ger your health, and soon tire you.</P>
<P>Lean mostly upon your left arm, and keep it out from your body upon the desk, let the right be closer to your side, but as much at liberty as possible. Do not move your head from side to side, when you write; for it is not only ungraceful, but tends to deceive you

<HEAD>OF HOLDING THE PEN.</HEAD>
<P N="5">5. Point the pen, in writing the round hand, up to your right shoulder; and always let both sides of the pen have an equal strain upon them in coming down; for this will prevent any of the sides from wearing sooner than the other: but, in writing the square hands, keep it more perpendicular.</P>
<P>Lean the weight of the hand which writes upon the tip of the little finger; keep the ring-finger lying within the little one; keep the fore and mid fingers nearly straight, and the two first joints of the fore fin∣ger lying mostly upon the back of the pen. Keep the first joint of the thumb bending outwards, and the point against the pen opposite to the first joint of the fore finger.</P>

<HEAD>A HYMN IN PROSE.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE spring is pleasant, but it is soon past:—</P>
<P>The summer is bright, but the winter destroy∣eth the beauty thereof.</P>
<P>The rose is sweet, but it is surrounded with thorns: The lily of the valley is fragrant, but it springeth up amongst the brambles.</P>
<P>The rainbow is very glorious, but it soon vanisheth away; life is good, but it is quickly swallowed up in death.</P>
<P>There is a land, where the roses are without thorns, where the flowers are not mixed with b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ambles.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="037446_0208_100D0E5BF515B4D8"/>In that land there is eternal spring, and light with∣out any cloud.</P>
<P>The tree of life groweth in the midst thereof▪ ri∣vers of pleasures are there, and flowers that never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ade.</P>
<P>Myriads of happy spirits are there, and surround t throne of God with a perpetual hy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.</P>
<P>The angels with their golden <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rps sing praises continually, and the cherubims fly on wings of fire!</P>
<P N="2">2. This country is Heaven: It is the country of those that are good; and nothing that is wicked must inhabit there.</P>
<P>The toad must not spit its venom amongst turtle doves, nor the poisonous hen bane grow amongst the sweet flowers.</P>
<P>Neither must any one that doeth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll, enter into that good land.</P>
<P>The earth is pleasant, for it is God's earth, and it is filled with many delightful things.</P>
<P>But that country is far better; there we shall not grieve any more, nor be sick any more, nor do wrong any more; there the cold of winter shall not wither us, nor the heats of summer scorch us.</P>
<P>In that country there are no wars nor quarrels, but all love one another with dear love.</P>
<P N="3">3. When our parents and friends die and are laid in the cold ground, we see them here no more; but there we shall embrace them again, and live with them, and be separated no more.</P>
<P>There we shall meet all good men whom we read of in holy books.</P>
<P>There we shall see Abraham, the called of God, the father of the faithful; and Moses, after his long wanderings in the Arabiah desert; and Elijah the pro∣phet of God; and Daniel, who escaped the lion's den; and there the son of Jesse, the shepherd's king, the sweet singer of Israel.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="208" REF="037446_0209_100D0E26CB8B75A8"/>4. They loved God on earth; they praised him on earth; but in that country they will praise him better, and love him more.</P>
<P>There we shall see Jesus, who is gone before us to that happy place; and there we shall behold the glory of the high God.</P>
<P>We cannot see him here, but we will love him here: We must be now on earth, but we will often think on heaven.</P>
<P>That happy land is our home; we are to be here but for a little while, and there forever, even for ages of eternal years.</P>
