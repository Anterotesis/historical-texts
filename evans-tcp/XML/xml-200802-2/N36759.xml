<HEAD><HI>THE</HI> AFFECTING HISTORY, of the Dreadful Distresses of Fred∣eric Manheim's family, who was taken prisoners by the Indians, in 1779.</HEAD>
<P>FREDERIC Manheim, an industrious German, with his family, consisting of his wife, Catharine, a daughter of eighteen years of age, and Maria and Christina, his youngest children (twins,) about sixteen, resided near the river Mohawk, eight miles writ of Johnston. On the 19th of October, 1779, the father being at work at some distance from his habitation, and the mother and eldest daughter on a visit at a neigh∣bour's, two hostile Canasadaga Indians rushed in, and captured the twin sisters.</P>
<P>The party to which those savages belonged, consisted of fifty warriors, who after securing twenty-three of the inhabitants of that neighbourhood, (among whom was the unfortunate Frederic Manheim) and firing their houses, retired for four days with the utmost pre∣cipitancy, till they were quite sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e from pursuit. The place where they halted on the evening of the day of rest, was a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hick pine swamp, which rendered the dark∣ness of an uncommonly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>omy night, still more dread∣ful, The Indians kind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fire, which they had not done before, and ordered their prisoners, whom they keep together, to refresh themselves with such provi∣sions as they had. The Indians ate by themselves. In∣stead of retiring to rest after supping▪ the appalled cap∣tives observed their enemies busi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in operations which b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ded nothing good. Two saplings were pruned clear of branches up to the very top, and all the brush clear∣e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> away for several rods around them. While this was doing, others were splitting pitch pine billers into small splinters about five in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hes in length, and as small as one's little finger, sharpening one end, and dipping the other in melted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</P>
<P>At length, with countenances distorted by infernal fury, and with hideous yells, the two savages who had captured the hapless Maria and Christina, leaped into the midst of their circle, and dragged those ill-fated maidens, shrieking, from the embraces of their com∣panions.
<PB REF="048110_0003_1024FBB2B5EA4AB8"/>
These warriors had disagreed about whose property the girls should be, as they had jointly seized them; and, to terminate the dispute, agreeably to the abominable usage of the savages, it was determined by the chiefs of the party, that the prisoners, who gave <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ise to the contention, should be destroyed; and that their captors should be the principle agents in the exe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rable business. These <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uries ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d by their comrades, stripped the forlera girls, already con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulsed with ap∣prehensions, and tied each to a sapling, with their hands as high extended above their hands as possible; and then pitched them from their knees to their shoul∣ders, with upwards of six hundred of the sharpened splinters above described, which, at every puncture, were attended with screams of distress, that echoed and re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>echoed through the wilderness. And then to com∣plete the infernal tragedy, the splinters, all standing erect on the bleeding victims, were every one set on fire, and exhibited a scene of monstrous misery, beyond the power of speech to describe, or even the imagination to conceive. It was not until near three hours had elap∣sed from the commencement of their torments, and that they had lost almost every resemblance of the hu∣man form, that these helpless virgins sunk down in the arms of their deliverer, Death.</P>

<HEAD><HI>REMARKABLE</HI> encounter of a white man with two Indians. In a letter to a gentleman of Philadelphia.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Westmoreland, <DATE>April 26, 1779.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WROTE you a note a few days ago, in which I promised you the particulars of an affair between a white man of this county, and two Indians: now I mean to relate the whole story, and it is as follows:</P>
<P>The white man is upwards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sixty years of age; his name is David Morgan; he had, through fear of the Indians, fled to a tort about twenty miles above the province line, and near the east side of Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ela river. From thence he sent some of his younger chil∣dren
<PB REF="048110_0004_1024FBB4C64B86C8" MS="y"/>
to his plantation, which was about a mile distant, there to do some business in the field He afterwards thought fit to follow, and see how they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ared. Get∣ting to his field▪ and seating himself upon the sence, within view of his children, where they were at work, he esp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed two Indians making towards them; on which he called to his children to make their escape. The Indians immediately bent their course towards him. He made the best haste to escape away, that his age and consequent infirmity would permit; but soon found he would be overtaken, which made him think of defence. Being-armed with a good rifle, he faced about, and found himself under the necessity of running four or five perches towards the Indians, in order to obtain shelter behind a tree of sufficient size.</P>
<P>This unexpected in manceuvre obliged the Indians, who were close by, to st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p where they had but small tim∣ber to shelter behind, which gave Mr. Morgan an op∣portunity of shooting one of them dead upon the spot. The other, taking the advantage of Morgan's empty gun, advanced upon him, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut him to flight a se∣cond time, and being lighter of foot than the old man, soon came up within a few paces, when he fired at him, but fortunately missed him. On this Mr. Morgan <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aced about again, to try his fortune, and clubbed his fire∣lock. The Indian, by this time, had got his tomahawk in order for a throw, at which they are very dextrous. Morgan made the blow, and the Indian the throw, al∣most at the same instant, by which the little finger was cut off Morgan's left hand, and the one next to it al∣most off, and his gun broke off by the lock. Now they came to close grips. Morgan put the Indian down; but soon found himself overturned, and the Indian up∣on him, feeling for his knife, and yelling most hideous∣ly, as their manner is, when they look upon victory to be certain. However, a woman's apron, which the In∣dian had plundered out of a house in the neighbourhood, and tied on him, above his knife, was now in his way, and so hindered him getting at it quickly, that Morgan got one of his fingers fast in his mouth, and deprived him of the use of that hand, by holding it; and discon∣certed him considerably by chewing it; all the while observing how he would come on with his knife▪
<PB REF="048110_0005_1024FBB8AEF92580"/>
length the Indian had got hold of his knife, but so far towards the blade, that Morgan got a small hold of the hinder end; and as the Indian pulled it out of the scab∣bard, Morgan giving his finger a severe screw with his teeth, twitched it out through his hand, cutting it most grievously. By this time they were both got partly on their feet, and the Indian was endeavouring to disen∣gage himself; but Morgan held fast by the finger, and quickly applied the point of the knife to the side of its savage owner; a bone happening in the way prevent∣ed its penetrating any great depth, but a second blow directed more towards the belly, found free passage into his bowels. The old man turned the point upward<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, made a large wound, burying the knife therein, and so took his departure instantly to the fort, with the news of his adventure.</P>
<P>On the report of Mr. Morgan, a party went out from the fort, and found the first Indian where he had fallen; the second they found not yet dead▪ at one hundred yards distance from the scene of action, hid in the top of a fallen tree, where he had picked the knife out of his body, after which had come out parched corn, &amp;c. and had bound up his wound with the apron aforemen∣tioned; and on first sight he saluted them with, How do do, broder, how do do, broder? but alas! poor savage, their brotherhood to him extended only to tomahawking, scalping, and, to gratify some peculiar feelings of their own, they skinned them both.</P>

<HEAD><HI>A SURE METHOD</HI> To know whether it will be a long Winter, and what weather it will be.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are some things proper to be known by the husbandman, that will be of great use to him, &amp; s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve for a good precau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion against the rig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s of the winter; and he may take this for a certain presage of a very severe winter, when there is a great plenty of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ns.</P>
<P>A shepherd should take care to observe whether the ewes, after they have taken ram, seek after them again; and by that they may guess that the next winter will be a hard one.</P>
<P>Take notice of the 24th of Nov. and as that day is, so the winter is like to prove; and as you find the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5th of the same month, so will the month of January be.</P>
<P>Y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> may easily know what sort of a winter it will be, by observing the last days of the moon between Novem∣ber and December; for as they prove, so will the win∣ter.</P>
<P>And to know what sort of a summer you will have, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se who are nice observers of the seasons say, that the three last days of the moon between April and May, are infallible presages how it is like to prove.</P>
