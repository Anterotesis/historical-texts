<P>SCHOOL OF WISDOM: OR, AMERICAN MONITOR. CONTAINING A COPIOUS COLLECTION OF SUBLIME AND ELEGANT EXTRACTS, FROM THE <HI>MOST EMINENT WRITERS,</HI> ON <HI>MORALS, RELIGION &amp; GOVERNMENT.</HI></P>
<Q>We frequently fall into error and folly, not because the true principles of action are not known, but because, for a time, they are not remembered. He may therefore justly be numbered among the benefactors of mankind, who contracts the great rules of life into short sentences, that may be easily impressed on the memory, and taught by frequent recollection to recur habitually to the mind.

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE selections of lessons for reading in schools now in use, are numerous, and many of them contain excellent essays of various kinds. But in general, those essays are too long, to be read at once; and when they are divided into parts, and read at different times, it is obvious that the connection is entirely broken, and that a great part of the advantages proposed to be derived from reading are lost.</P>
<P>To obviate this objection, the volume now offered to the public, is principally composed of short passages, each com∣plete in itself, and independent of the rest. When children read in classes, each may have an entire subject.</P>
<P>To some of the extracts, it may perhaps be objected, that they are above the understanding of youth: But it is believed their capacities are too frequently under-rated; and that it often happens, through such a pernicious mistake, that they spend their time in reading idle tales and stories, when they might be employed in treasuring up a store of useful maxims to guide them through the thorny path of life with safety and honour to themselves and advantage to the community.</P>
<P>In making the selection, considerable pains have been taken. Many of the works of the most celebrated writers have been carefully examined—and numerous passages adorn the work from Shakespeare, Dryden, Milton, Pope, Young, Watts, Rowe, Addison, Swift, Brooke, Fielding, Hervey, Johnson, Price, Montesquieu and others of equal reputation. To familiarize the rising generation with the perusal of such illustrious writers, can hardly fail to prove salutary.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="037099_0003_100C4BE7B1E8B3F0"/>
The introduction of political sentiments into a work intended principally for youth, will probably be censured by some persons. It may not therefore be improper to offer the reasons that led to the adoption of this plan.</P>
<P>In countries where the established form of government is monarchy, most of the elementary books used to instruct children in their native language, are calculated to impress on their youthful minds, a prejudice in favour of the ex∣isting order of things. National glory, (which means the spreading havoc and destruction among other nations), the splendor of monarchy, and the advantages of conquest, are displayed in the most captivating and glowing colours. <HI>This system is the result of profound policy.</HI> An early bias is thus given to the mind, which in most cases "grows with its growth," and often retains its influence to the last stage of decrepitude.</P>
<P>And is not such a system at least as proper and necessary in this country as elsewhere? Should not endeavours be used to impress on the rising generation, a respect and reverence for the forms of government under which we live? Our constitutions are all grounded on the rights of the citizens to liberty and the security of property, and on the grand principle, that the officers of government, legis∣lative as well as executive, are all the agents of the people, deputed to perform for them those functions which they cannot execute themselves. In every one of them are recognised those grand and sublime truths, the defence of which has rendered so many men illustrious in the English annals—those principles for which
<Q><L>a Hampden struggled, and a Sydney bled—</L></Q>
those principles, in fine, which are to be found in a greater or less degree, through the writings of the best men of all ages and nations.</P>
<P>On this ground, it is presumed that vast advantages must accrue from subjecting to the perusal of youth, such a variety of elegant passages, tending to shew in the strongest light the advantages of liberty, of peace, of good order—the dignity of human nature—to inspire an abhorrence of war—and to display its tremendous consequences, in all
<PB N="iv" REF="037099_0004_100C4BEAD26CF6F8"/>
their native deformity, stripped of the imposing gloss which artful and interested men have spread over them.</P>
<P>The names of the writers are generally given, partly as a tribute of gratitude towards those whose writings have served to complete this work—partly to facilitate a comparison between the sentiments of men in different ages—and partly with a view of exciting the reader's curiosity to search into their works complete. It is not pretended that a sublime truth can receive any corrobo∣ration from the celebrity of the man who wrote it. The sentiment, that
<Q><L>The purest treasure mortal times afford,</L>
<L>Is spotless reputation. That away,</L>
<L>Men are but gilded loam or painted clay,</L></Q>
is an eternal axiom, and, whether sanctioned with the name of a Shakespeare or a Dennis, must carry conviction to every correct mind. In like manner, the position in page 240,—<Q>No man is better born than another, unless he is born with better abilities, and a more amiable dispo∣sition,</Q> needs not the prop of Seneca's name to com∣mand assent.</P>
<P>With these few remarks this small work is submitted to the candour and indulgence of the public, whose deci∣sion on its utility shall be acquiesced in by the editor. He may have estimated too high the probable beneficial effects of his labours. This is so common an error as to be perhaps a venial one. But whatever may be its tendency or its success, he can never be deprived of the solid satis∣faction arising from a perfect consciousness of having used his most earnest endeavours to promote the best interests of his fellow men.</P>

<HEAD>OF ELOCUTION.</HEAD>
<P>ELOCUTION is a branch of oratory, the pow∣er and importance of which is greater than is generally thought; insomuch that eloquence takes its name from it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eloquentia ab eloqui. I use the word Elocution here in its common and vulgar sense, to signify utterance, delivery, or pronunciation, in which sense we frequently use it in the English language, and which its Latin etymology very well justifies; tho' I know some good writers apply to it a different idea, in conformity to the sense in which the Latin orators used the word elocutio. But it is no uncommon thing for derivative words in one language to be taken in a different sense from that, in which the words they are derived from are taken in another.</NOTE></P>
<P>It was much cultivated by Quintilian, and before him by Cicero, and before him by M. Antonius; but before his time, it was too much neglected by the Roman orators: Which made him say, "he had seen many men famous for eloquence, but not one of them that understood elocution."</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="037099_0014_100C4C006B2092B8"/>
But what stress was laid upon it by the Greek orators, appears from that celebrated saying of Demos∣thenes; who being asked, what was the first principal thing in oratory? answered, Pronunciation; being asked again, what was the second? replied, Pronunci∣ation. And what was the third? Pronunciation. Denoting that in his judgment the whole art, spirit, and power of oratory consisted in this.</P>
<P>Cicero, and after him Quintilian, divided oratory into five parts: 1. Invention—by which we pro∣vide ourselves with suitable and sufficient materials for a discourse. 2. Disposition—by which they meant the division of their subject into parts and sentences, according to the most natural order; and consequently the proper distribution and arrangement of their ideas. 3. Elocution—by which they always meant, what we call Diction; which consists in suiting our words to our ideas, and the style to the subject. 4. Memory, or a faculty of clearly discerning and retaining our ideas, and of calling to mind the properest words by which to express them. 5. Pronunciation; or the art of ma∣naging the voice and gesture in speaking.</P>
<P>So that by pronunciation, the antients understood both Elocution and Action; and comprehended in it the right management of the voice, looks, and gesture. To the former of these, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the right management of the voice in reading or speaking; which is indifferently called by us, Elocution and Pronunciation, I shall here confine myself.</P>
<P>The great design and end of a good pronunciation is, to make the ideas seem to come from the heart; and then they will not fail to excite the attention and affections of those that hear us: from which the great benefit and usefulness of this too much neglected art may be seen.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="lesson">
<PB N="7" REF="037099_0015_100C4C050EEF5958"/>
<HEAD>OF BAD PRONUNCIATION.</HEAD>
<P>The several faults of pronunciation are these following:</P>
<P N="1">1. When the voice is too loud.</P>
<P>This is very disagreeable to the hearer, and very in∣convenient to the speaker.</P>
<P>It will be very disagreeable to the hearers, if they be persons of good taste: who will always look upon it to be the effect either of ignorance or affectation.</P>
<P>Some will impute it to your ignorance, and suppose that you were never instructed better since you left the reading school; where children generally get a habit of reading in a high-pitched key, or a uniform elevated voice, without any regard to emphasis, cadence, or a graceful elocution.</P>
<P>Others will impute it to affectation; or a design to work upon their passions; which will immediately de∣feat the design, if you had it. For if you would effec∣tually move the passions, you must carefully conceal your intention so to do; for as soon as the mind perceives you have such a design upon it, it will be u∣pon its guard. However, none but the most low, weak, and mechanical minds will be affected with mere dint of sound and noise. And the passions so raised, leave no lasting or valuable effects upon the mind, and answer no good purpose or end; because the understanding hath nothing to do with such impressions, and the memory no handle by which to retain or recall them. Not to say, it often answers a bad end; affects the mind in a wrong place, and gives it a false bias. However this may be thought to become the stage or the bar, it least of all befits the pulpit; where all ought to be solemn, serious, rational, and grave as the subjects there treated of.</P>
<P>It is false oratory then to seek to persuade or affect by mere vehemence of voice. A thing that hath been often attempted by men of mean furniture, low genius,
<PB N="8" REF="037099_0016_100C4C0708B2B710"/>
or bad taste, among the antients as well as the moderns. A practice which formerly gave the judicious Quin∣tilian great offence; who calls it not only clamouring, but furious bellowing; not vehemence, but downright violence.</P>
<P>Besides, an overstrained voice is very inconvenient to the speaker, as well as disgustful to judicious hearers. It exhausts his spirits to no purpose; and takes from him the proper management and modulation of his voice according to the sense of his subject; and, what is worst of all, it naturally leads him into a tone.</P>
<P>Every man's voice indeed should fill the place where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eaks; but if it exceed its natural key, it will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sweet nor soft, nor agreeable, because he will not be able to give every word its proper and distin∣guishing sound.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another fault in pronunciation is when the voice is too low.</P>
<P>This is not so inconvenient to the speaker, but is as disagreeable to the hearer, as the other extreme. And inde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to the generality of hearers a too low voice is much more displeasing than a too loud one; espe∣cially to those who are troubled with an impediment in hearing, and those who are best pleased with a lively and pathetic address, as most are. It is always offensive to an audience to observe any thing in the reader or speaker that looks like indolence or inatten∣tion. The hearer will never be affected whilst he sees the speaker indifferent.</P>
<P>The art of governing the voice consists a good deal in dexterously avoiding these two extremes: at least, this ought to be first minded. And for a general rule to direct you herein, I know of none better than this—carefully to preserve the key, that is, the command of your voice; and at the same time, to adapt the eleva∣tion and strength of it to the condition and number of the persons you speak to, and the nature of the place you speak in.—It would be altogether as ridiculous in
<PB N="9" REF="037099_0017_100C32916CA8F3F0"/>
a general who is haranguing an army to speak in a low and languid voice, as in a person who reads a chapter in a family to speak in a loud and eager one.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another fault in pronunciation is a thick, hasty, cluttering voice.</P>
<P>This is, when a person mumbles, or clips, or swal∣lows his words, that is, leaves out some syllables in the long words, and never pronounces some of the short ones at all; but hurries on without any care to be heard distinctly, or to give his words their full sound, or his hearers the full sense of them.</P>
<P>This is often owing to a defect in the organs of speech, or a too great flutter of the animal spirits; but oftener to a bad habit uncorrected.</P>
<P>Demosthenes, the greatest orator Greece ever produ∣ced, had, it is said, nevertheless, three natural impedi∣ments in pronunciation; all which he conquered by invincible labour and perseverance. One was a weakness of voice; which he cured by frequently declaiming on the sea-shore, amidst the noise of the waves. Another was a shortness of breath; which he mended by repeating his orations as he walked up a hill. And the other was the fault I am speaking of; a thick mumbling way of speaking; which he broke himself of by declaiming with pebbles in his mouth.</P>
<P N="4">4. Another fault in pronunciation is when persons speak too quick.</P>
<P>There is scarce any fault more common than this, especially among young persons, who imagine they can read very well, and are not afraid of being stopped in their carreer by the unexpected intervention of any hard word. And scarce any bad habit of the voice is con∣quered with more difficulty; tho' one would imagine nothing is more easy.</P>
<P>This manner of reading may do well enough when we are examining leases; perusing indentures; or reciting acts of parliament, where there is always a
<PB N="10" REF="037099_0018_100C4C0C6A044D48"/>
great superfluity of words; or in reading a newspaper, where there is but little matter that deserves our atten∣tion; but is very improper in reading books of devo∣tion and instruction, and especially the sacred scriptures, where the solemnity of the subject or the weight of the sense demands a particular regard. But it is most of all inexcusable to read forms of prayer in this manner as acts of devotion.</P>
<P>The great disadvantage which attends this manner of pronunciation, is, that the hearer loses the benefit of more than half the good things he hears, and would fain remember, but cannot. And a speaker should al∣ways have a regard to the memory, as well as the under∣standing, of his hearers.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is also a fault to speak too slow.</P>
<P>Some are apt to read in a heavy, droning, sleepy way; and through mere carelessness make pauses at improper places. This is very disagreeable. But to hem, hauk, sneeze, yawn, or cough, between the pe∣riods, is vastly more so.</P>
<P>A too slow elocution is most faulty in reading trifles that do not require attention. It then becomes tedious. A person that is addicted to this slow way of speaking should always take care to reward the hearer's patience with importan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sentiments, and compensate the want of words by a weight of thoughts; and give his discourse its proper quantity of solid sense, that, as we say, what it wants in length it may make out in breadth.</P>
<P>But a too slow elocution is a fault very rarely to be found, unless in aged people, and those who naturally speak so in common conversation. And in these, if the pronunciation be in all other respects just, decent, and proper; and especially if the subject be weighty or intricate, it is very excusable.</P>
<P N="6">6. An irregular or uneven voice, is a great fault in reading.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="037099_0019_100C4C0EB51BCF58"/>
That is, when the voice rises and falls by fits and starts, or when it is elevated and depressed unnaturally, or unseasonably, without regard to sense or stops; or always beginning a sentence with a high voice, and concluding it with a low one, or <HI>vice versa;</HI> or always beginning and concluding it with the same key. Opposite to this is.</P>
<P N="7">7. A flat, dull, uniform tone of voice, without emphasis or cadence, or any regard to the sense or sub∣ject of what is read.</P>
<P>This is a habit, which children who have been used to read their lessons by way of task, are very apt to fall into, and retain as they grow up, such a monotony as attorney's clerks read in, when they examine an en∣grossed deed. This is a great infelicity when it becomes habitual; because it deprives the hearer of the greatest part of the benefit or advantage he might receive by a close attention to the most weighty and interesting parts of the subject, which should always be distin∣guished or pointed out by the pronunciation—For a just pronunciation is a good commentary.</P>
<P>Lastly, the greatest and most common fault of all is reading with a tone.</P>
<P>No habit is more easy to be contracted than this, or more hard to be conquered. This unnatural tone in reading and speaking is very various; but whatever it be, it is always disgustful to persons of delicacy and judgment.</P>
<P>Some have a womanish squeaking tone; which, persons whose voices are shrill and weak, and over∣strained, are very apt to fall into.</P>
<P>Some have a singing or canting tone, which En∣thusiastic speakers generally much affect, and by which their hearers are often much affected. Others affect a high, swelling, theatrical tone; who being ambiti∣ous of the fame of fine orators, lay too much emphasis on every sentence, and thereby transgress the rules of true oratory.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="037099_0020_100C4C109E5307F0"/>
Others affect an awful and striking tone, attended with solemn grimace, as if they would move you with every word, whether the weight of the subject bear them out or not. This is what persons of a gloomy or melancholy cast of mind are most apt to give into.</P>
<P>Some have a set uniform tone of voice; which I have already taken notice of.—Others, an odd, whimsical, whining tone, peculiar to themselves, and not to be described—only that it is laying the emphasis on words which do not require or deserve it.</P>
<P>It must be acknowledged, there are some kinds of tone which, though unnatural, yet, as managed by the speakers, are not very disagreeable—and the mind must be much on its guard that can remain unmoved thereby.</P>
<P>When I have been affected with hearing orators de∣liver common or obscure sentiments in such a striking tone, I have endeavoured carefully to examine into the true reason of that emotion, or what it was that excited that affection in my mind; and have found that it could not arise from the mere tone of the speaker—which of itself was unnatural and disagreeable—nor from the weight of the subject—which was no more than common—but from the earnestness, life and so∣lemnity with which he spake, and his appearing him∣self to be much affected with what he delivered; which two things will never fail to move an audience. And why they may not be as well observed and prac∣tised without a tone as with one, I cannot conceive. And without these a tone itself would have no power to move; as it hath no other subserviency to raise the passions than as it solemnizes the subject, and seems to shew the speaker's heart engaged. Pity that those two ends <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not be answered by a better means! and that a bad habit in the speaker, indulging a false taste in the hearers, should secure one great end of ora∣tory by that which is the greatest abuse of it!</P>
<P>Our next enquiry is</P>

<PB N="13" REF="037099_0021_100C4C1246C82520"/>
<HEAD>HOW TO AVOID A BAD PRONUNCIATION.</HEAD>
<P>To this end the few following rules may be of ser∣vice.</P>
<P N="1">1. If you would not read in too loud or too low a voice, consider whether your voice be naturally too low or loud; and correct it accordingly in your ordi∣nary conversation: by which means you will be better able to correct it in reading. If it be too low, con∣verse with those that are deaf; if too loud, with those whose voices are low. Begin your periods with an even moderate voice, that you may have the command of it, to raise or fall it as the subject requires.</P>
<P N="2">2. To cure a thick confused cluttering voice, accus∣tom yourself, both in conversation and reading, to pro∣nounce every word distinct and clear. Observe with what delib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ration some converse and read, and how full a sound they give to every word; and imitate them. Do not affect to contract your words, as some do, or run two into one. This may do very well in conversation, or in reading familiar dialogues, but is not so decent in grave and solemn subjects; especially in reading the sacred scriptures.</P>
<P>It appears from Demosthenes's case, that this fault of pronunciation cannot be cured without much diffi∣culty, nor will you find his remedy effectual without pains and perseverance.</P>
<P N="3">3. To break a habit of reading too fast, attend dili∣gently to the sense, weight, and propriety of every sen∣tence you read, and of every emphatical word in it. This will not only be an advantage to yourself, but a double one to your hearers; for it will at once give them time to do the same, and excite their attention when they see yours is fixed. A solemn pause after a weighty thought is very beautiful and striking. A well timed stop gives as much grace to speech as it does to music. Imagine that you are speaking to persons of
<PB N="14" REF="037099_0022_100C4C1556A35960"/>
slow and unready conceptions; and measure not your hearer's apprehension by your own. If you do, you may possibly out-run it. And as in reading you are not at liberty to repeat your words and sentences, that should engage you to be very deliberate in pronouncing them, that their sense may not be lost. The ease and advantage that will arise both to the speaker and hear∣er, by a free, full, and deliberate pronunciation is hard∣ly to be imagined.</P>
<P>I need lay down no rules to avoid a too slow pro∣nunciation; that being a fault which few are guilty of.</P>
<P N="4">4. To cure an uneven, desultory voice, take care that you do not begin your periods either in too high or too low a key; for that will necessarily lead you to an unnatural and improper variation of it. Have a careful regard to the nature and quantity of your points, and the length of your periods; and keep your mind intent on the sense, subject, and spirit of your author.</P>
<P>The same directions are necessary to avoid a mon∣otony in pronunciation, or a dull, set, uniform tone of voice. For if your mind be but attentive to the sense of your subject, you will naturally manage and mod∣ulate your voice according to the nature and importance of it.</P>
<P>Lastly, To avoid all kinds of unnatural and disa∣greeable tones, the only rule is to endeavour to speak with the same ease and freedom as you would do on the same subject in private conversation. You hear no body converse in a tone; unless they have the uncouth accent of some other country, or have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> into a habit of altering the natural key of their voice when they are talking of some serious subject in religion. But I can see no reason in the world, that when in common conversation we speak in a natural voice with proper ac∣cent and emphasis, yet as soon as we begin to read, or talk of religion, or speak in public, we should imme∣diately assume a stiff, aukward, unnatural tone. If we are indeed deeply affected with the subject we read
<PB N="15" REF="037099_0023_100C4C16DA6D9C18"/>
or talk of, the voice will naturally vary according to the passion excited; but if we vary it unnaturally, only to seem affected, or with a design to affect others, it then becomes a tone, and is offensive.</P>
<P>In reading then attend to your subject, and deliver it just in such a manner as you would do if you were talking of it. This is the great, general and most im∣portant rule of all; which, if carefully observed, will correct not only this but almost all the other faults of a bad pronunciation; and give you an easy, decent, graceful delivery, agreeable to all the rules of a right elocution. For however apt we are to transgress them in reading, we follow them naturally and easily enough in conversation. And children will tell a story with all the natural graces and beauties of pronunciation, however aukwardly they may read the same out of a book.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="lesson">
<HEAD>OF GOOD PRONUNCIATION.</HEAD>
<P>A good pronunciation in reading, is the art of managing and governing the voice so as to express the full sense and spirit of your author in that just, decent and graceful manner, which will not only instruct but affect the hearers; and will not only raise in them the same ideas he intended to convey, but the same passions he really felt. This is the great end of reading to others, and this end can only be attained by a proper and just pronunciation.</P>
<P>And hence we may learn wherein a good pronunci∣ation in speaking consists; which is nothing but a natural, easy, and graceful variation of the voice, suitable to the nature and importance of the sentiments we deliver.</P>
<P>A good pronunciation in both these respects is more easily attained by some than others; as some can more readily enter into the sense and sentiments of an author, and more easily deliver their own, than others can;
<PB N="16" REF="037099_0024_100C4C19F700E6F0"/>
and at the same time have a more happy facility of expressing all the proper variations and modulations of the voice than others have. Thus persons of a quick apprehension, and a brisk flow of animal spirits (setting aside all impediments of the organs) have generally a more lively, just, and natural elocution than persons of a slow perception and a flegmatic cast. However, it may in a good degree be attained by every one that will carefully attend to and practice those rules that are proper to acquire it. Which leads me therefore to consider</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="lesson">
<HEAD>HOW A GOOD PRONUNCIATION IS TO BE ATTAINED.</HEAD>
<P>To this end the observation of the following rules is necessary.</P>
<P>Have a particular regard to Pauses, Emphasis, and Cadence.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="lesson">
<HEAD>OF PAUSES.</HEAD>
<P>WITH respect to pauses, you will in a great measure in reading be directed by the common stops or points, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Comma (,)—Semi-colon (;)—Colon (:)—Period (.)—Interrogation (?)—and Admiration (!).</P>
<P>These points serve two purposes—to distinguish the sense of the author, and—to direct the pronunciation of the reader.—A comma stops the voice, while we may privately tell one—a semi-colon, two—a colon, three—and a period, four.</P>
<P>To break a habit of taking breath too often in read∣ing, accustom yourself to read long periods, such as the sixteen first lines in Milton's Paradise Lost.</P>
<P>After some weighty and important sentiment, it will be proper to make a longer pause than ordinary; and especially towards the close or application of a discourse:
<PB N="17" REF="037099_0025_100C4C1B82008ED8"/>
—these long pauses are very proper; as they at once compose and affect the mind, and give it time to think. It will also be very helpful to the speaker's voice; and give his pronunciation the advantage of variety, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> always pleasing to the hearers.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="lesson">
<HEAD>OF EMPHASIS.</HEAD>
<P>THE next thing to be regarded in reading is the Emphasis; and to see that it be always laid on the emphatical word.</P>
<P>When we distinguish any particular syllable in a word with a strong voice, it is called Accent; when we thus distinguish any particular word in a sentence, it is called Emphasis; and the word to distinguished the Emphatical word. And the emphatical words (for there are often more than one) in a sentence, are those which carry a weight or importance in themselves, or those on which the sense of the rest depends; and these must always be distinguished by a fuller and stronger sound of voice, wherever they are found, whether in the beginning, middle, or end of a sentence. Take for instance those words of the satirist.
<Q><L>Get plàce and weàlth, if possible, with gràce,</L>
<L>If not, by àny means get weàlth and plàce.</L>
<BIBL>POPE.</BIBL></Q>
In these lines the emphatical words are accented; and which they are, the sense will always discover.</P>
<P>Some sentences are so full and comprehensive, that almost every word is emphatical: For instance, that pathetic expostulation in the prophecy of Ezekiel,
<Q>Why will ye die!</Q>
In this short sentence, every word is emphatical, and on which ever word you lay the emphasis, whether the
<PB N="18" REF="037099_0026_100C4C1E6BBE4DA0"/>
first, second, third, or fourth, it strikes out a different sense, and opens a new subject of moving expostulation.</P>
<P>Some sentences are equivocal, as well as some words; that is, contain in them more senses than one; and which is the sense intended can only be known by observing on what word the emphasis is laid. For instance—"Will you ride to town to-day?"—This question is capable of being taken in four different sen∣ses, according to the different words on which you lay the emphasis. If it be laid on the word <HI>you,</HI>—the answer may be—"No, but I intend to send my servant in my stead."—If the emphasis be laid on the word <HI>ride</HI>—the proper answer might be—"No, I intend to walk it."—If you place the emphasis on the word <HI>town</HI>—it is a different question; and the answer may be—"No, for I design to ride into the country"—And if the emphasis be laid upon the words <HI>to-day</HI>—the sense is still something different from all these; and the proper answer may be—"No, but I shall to-morrow"—Of such importance oftentimes is a right emphasis, in order to determine the proper sense of what we read or speak.</P>
<P>The voice must also express, as near as may be, the very sense or idea designed to be conveyed by the em∣phatical word; by a strong, rough, and violent, or a soft, smooth, and tender sound.</P>
<P>Thus the different passions of the mind are to be expressed by a different sound or tone of voice. Love, by a soft, smooth, languishing voice;—Anger, by a strong, vehement, and elevated voice;—Joy, by a quick, sweet, and clear voice;—Sorrow, by a low, flexible, inter∣rupted voice;—Fear, by a dejected, tremulous, hesita∣ting voice;—Courage hath a full, bold, and loud voice;—and Perplexity, a grave, steady, and earnest one. In Exordiums the voice should be low;—in Narrations, distinct;—in Reasoning, slow;—in Persuasion, strong; it should thunder in Anger—soften in Sorrow—trem∣ble in Fear—and melt in Love.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="037099_0027_100C4C20D97F3CA8"/>
The variation of the emphasis must not only distin∣guish the various passions described, but the several forms and figures of speech in which they are expressed.</P>
<P>In a Prosopopae<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a, we must change the voice as the person introduced would.</P>
<P>In an Antithesis, one contrary must be pronounced louder than the other.</P>
<P>In a Climax, the voice should always rise with it.</P>
<P>In Dialogues, it should alter with the parts.</P>
<P>In Repetitions, it should be loudest in the second place.</P>
<P>Words of quality and distinction, or of praise or dispraise, must be pronounced with a strong emphasis.</P>
<P><HI>No</HI> emphasis, is better than a wrong or misplaced one. For that only perplexes; this always misleads the mind of the hearer.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="lesson">
<HEAD>OF CADENCE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is directly opposite to emphasis. Emphasis is raising the voice, cadence is falling it; and when right∣ly managed is very musical. Beside cadence of voice, there is cadence of stile—That is, when the sense being almost expressed and perfectly discerned by the reader, the remaining words, which are only necessary to com∣plete the period, gently fall of themselves, without any emphatical word among them. If our author's lan∣guage be pure and elegant, his cadence of stile will naturally direct the cadence of voice.</P>
<P>Cadence generally takes place at the end of a sen∣tence; unless it closes with an emphatical word.</P>
<P>Every parenthesis is to be pronounced in cadence; that is, with a low voice, and quicker than ordinary; that it may not take off the attention too much from the sense of the period it interrupts. But all apostrophes and prosopopaeias are to be pronounced in emphasis.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>IF you would acquire a just pronunciation in read∣ing, you must not only take in the full sense, but enter into the spirit of your author: For you can never convey the force and fulness of his ideas to another, till you feel them yourself. No man can read an author he does not perfectly understand and taste.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The great rule which the masters of rhetoric so much press, can never enough be remembered; that to make a man speak well, and pronounce with a right emphasis, he ought thoroughly to understand all that he says, be fully persuaded of it, and bring himself to have those affections which he desires to infuse into others. He that is inwardly persuaded of the truth of what he says, and that hath a concern about it in his mind, will pronounce with a natural vehemence that is far more lovely than all the strains that art can lead him to. An orator must endeavor to feel what he says, and then he will speak so as to make others feel it.</NOTE></P>
<P>The same rules are to be observed in reading poetry and prose: Neither the rhyme nor the numbers should take off the attention from the sense and spirit of the author. It is this only that must direct the pronunci∣ation in poetry as well as prose. When you read verse, you must not at all favor the measure or rhyme; <HI>that</HI> often obscures the sense and spoils the pronunciation: For the great end of pronunciation is to elucidate and heighten the sense; that is, to represent it not only in a clear, but a strong light. Whatever then obstructs this is carefully to be avoided, both in verse and prose. Nay, this ought to be more carefully observed in read∣ing verse than prose; because the author, by a constant attention to his measure and rhyme, and the exaltation of his language, is often very apt to obscure his sense; which therefore requires the more care in the reader to discover and distinguish it by the pronunciation. And if when you read verse with proper pause, emphasis, and cadence, and a pronunciation varied and governed
<PB N="21" REF="037099_0029_100C4C24EB343228"/>
by the sense, it be not harmonious and beautiful, the fault is not in the reader but the author. And if the verse be good, to read it thus will improve its harmony; because it will take off that uniformity of sound and accent which tires the ear, and makes the numbers heavy and disagreeable.</P>
<P>Another important rule to be observed in elocution is—study Nature.—By this I mean your own natural dispositions and affections. And those subjects that are most suitable to them, you will easily pronounce with a beautiful propriety: and to heighten the pronuncia∣tion, the natural warmth of the mind should be per∣mitted to have its course under a proper rein and regulation.</P>
<P>Study the natural dispositions and affections of others. For some are much more easily impressed and moved one way, and some another. And an orator should be acquainted with all the avenues to the heart.</P>
<P>Study the most easy and natural way of expressing yourself, both as to the tone of voice and the mode of speech. And this is best learned by observations on common conversation—where all is free, natural, and easy—where we are only intent on making ourselves understood, and conveying our ideas in a strong, plain, and lively manner, by the most natural language, pronunciation and action. And the nearer our pro∣nunciation in public comes to the freedom and ease of that we use in common discourse—provided we keep up the dignity of the subject, and preserve a propriety of expression—the more just, natural, and agreeable it will generally be.</P>
<P>Above all things, then, study nature—avoid affecta∣tion—never use art, if you have not the art to conceal it. For whatever does not appear natural, can never be agreeable, much less persuasive.</P>
<P>Endeavor to keep your mind collected and compo∣sed—Guard against that flatter and timidity of spirit,
<PB N="22" REF="037099_0030_100C4C285EFD6920"/>
which is the common infelicity of young, and especially bashful persons, when they first begin to speak or read in public. This is a great hindrance both to their pronunciation and invention; and at once gives both themselves and their hearers an unnecessary pain. It will by constant opposition wear off—and the best way to give the mind a proper degree of assurance and self-command at such a time, is to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e entire master of the subject—and a consciousness that you deliver to your audience nothing but what is well worth their hearing, will give you a strong degree of courage.</P>
<P>Endeavor to be wholly engaged in your subject; and when the mind is intent upon and warmed with it, it will forget that awful deference it before paid to the audience, which was so apt to disconcert it.</P>
<P>If the sight of your hearers, or any of them discom∣pose you, keep your eyes from them.</P>
<P>Be sure to keep up a life, spirit, and energy in the expression; and let the voice naturally vary according to the variation of the stile and subject.</P>
<P>Whatever be the subject, it will never be pleasing, if the style be low and flat; nor will the beauty of the style be discovered, if the pronunciation be so.</P>
<P>Cicero observes there must be a glow in our style if we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> warm our hearers. And who does not ob∣serve how ridiculous it is to pronounce the <HI>ardens verbum</HI> in a cold lifeless tone?—The transition of the voice must always correspond with that of the subject, and the passions it was intended to excite.</P>
<P>To attain a just and graceful pronunciation, you should accustom yourselves frequently to hear those who excel in it, whether at the bar or in the pulpit—where you will see all the sore-mentioned rules exem∣plified, and be able to account for all those graces and beauties of pronunciation which always pleased you, but you did not know why.</P>
<P>Indeed, the Art of Pronunciation, like all others, is better learned by imitation than rule: But to be first
<PB N="23" REF="037099_0031_100C4C2AB02735A0"/>
acquainted with the rules of it, will make the imitation more easy. You will observe a certain agreeableness of manner in some orators, that is natural to them, not to be reduced to any rule, and to be learnt by imi∣tation only; nor by that, unless it be in some degree natural to you.</P>
<P>You should frequently exercise yourself to read aloud according to the foregoing rules.—It is practice only that must give you the faculty of an elegant pro∣nunciation. This, like other habits, is only to be attained by often repeated acts.</P>
<P>Orators, as well as poets, must be born so, or they will never excel in their respective arts: But that part of oratory which consists in a decent and graceful pro∣nunciation, provided there be no defect in the organs of speech, may be attained by rule, imitation, and practice; and, when attained, will give a beauty to speech, a force to thoughts, and a pleasure to the hearers, not to be expressed; and which all will admire, but none can imitate, unless they are first prepared for it by art and nature—In short, the great advantage of a just pro∣nunciation is, that it will please all, whether they have no taste, a bad taste, or a good taste.</P>

<HEAD>OF ACTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE action should be as easy and as natural as the elocution; and, like that, must be varied and directed by the passions.</P>
<P>An affected violence of motion is as disgustful as an affected vehement of voice; and <HI>no</HI> action, as bad as <HI>no</HI> emphasis—when two faults commonly go together, as do the other two, just before mentioned.</P>
<P>Those parts of the body that are to be principally employed in oratorical action, are the head, the face, the eyes, the hands, and the upper part of the whole body.</P>

<HEAD>THE HEAD.</HEAD>
<P>THIS should generally be in an erect posture; turning sometimes on one side, and sometimes on the other, that the voice may be heard by the whole audience, and a regard paid to the several parts of it.</P>
<P>It should always be on the same side with the action of the hands and body, except when we express an abhorrence, or a refusal of any thing, which is done by rejecting it with the right-hand, and turning away the head to the left.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="lesson">
<HEAD>THE COUNTENANCE.</HEAD>
<P>IN this is the seat of the soul and the very life of action. Every passion, whilst uttered with the tongue should be painted in the face. There is often more eloquence in a look than any words can express. By this we are awed, charmed, incensed, softened, grieved, rejoiced, raised, or dejected, according as we catch the fire of the speaker's passion from his face.—There is no end in recounting the force and effects of this dumb oratory; which nature only teaches, and which persons of low passions lose all the advantages of.

them—For tho' an orator should always be animated, he should never be overcome by his passions.</P>
<P>In all appeals to heaven, and sometimes at the so∣lemn mention of the name of the great God, the eyes and the head should be turned upwards.</P>
<P>In adoration, the hands and eyes should be lifted up, and the head and body bowing down.</P>
<P>In solemn vows, exclamations and appeals to heaven, the hands, head, and eyes should all be lifted up; but in humiliation and confession bowed down.</P>
<P>The language of the eye is inexpressible. It is the window of the soul—from which sometimes the whole heart looks out at once, and speaks more feelingly than all the warmest strains of oratory; and comes effectually in aid of it, when the passion is too strong to be uttered.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="lesson">
<HEAD>THE HANDS</HEAD>
<P>THE left hand should never be used alone, unless it be to attend the motion of the head and eyes in an address to the audience on the left side.</P>
<P>The right hand may be often used alone.</P>
<P>When you speak of the body, you may point to it with the middle finger of the right hand.</P>
<P>When you speak of the soul or conscience, you may lay the right hand gently on the breast.—It should be often displayed with an easy motion to favour an em∣phasis; but seldom or never be quite extended.—All its motions should be from the left to the right.</P>
<P>Both the hands displayed, and the arms extended, is violent action, and never just or decent unless the audience be noisy, and part of them at a distance from the speaker, and he is labouring to be heard; and then they should never be extended higher than the head, unless pointing at something above the audience.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Raphael's cartoon, representing St. Paul preaching at Athens.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="037099_0034_100C4C31A9108AF0"/>
The motion of the hand should always correspond with those of the head and eyes; as <HI>they</HI> should with the passions expressed.</P>
<P>In deliberate proof or argumentation, no action is more proper or natural than gently to lay the first finger of the right hand on the palm of the left.</P>
<P>Of what great use the proper motion of the hand is in assisting pronunciation, and how many passions may be strongly indicated thereby, when attended with that of the head and eyes, is not easy to be described, but is soon observed in common conversation.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="lesson">
<HEAD>THE POSTURE OF THE BODY.</HEAD>
<P>THIS should be usually erect; not continually changing, nor always motionless; declining in acts of humiliation; in acts of praise and thanksgiving, raised.</P>
<P>It should always accompany the motion of the hands, head, and eyes, when they are directed to any particu∣lar part of the audience; but never so far as to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et the back be turned to any part of it.</P>
<P>But let it suffice just to hint at these things. They who desire to see them more largely treated of, may consult Quintilian.</P>
<P>But after all, with regard to action, the great rule is the same as in pronunciation—to follow nature, and avoid affectation.—The action of the body, and the several parts of it, must correspond with the pronunci∣ation, as that does with the style, and the style with the subject. A perfect harmony of all these completes the orator.</P>

<BIBL>MALLET.</BIBL>
<P>There are but few men who are not ambitious of distinguishing themselves in the nation or country where they live, and of growing considerable among those with whom they converse. There is a kind of grandeur and respect which the meanest and most in∣significant
<PB N="28" REF="037099_0036_100C4C36DF465CE8"/>
part of mankind endeavor to procure in the little circle of their friends and acquaintance. The poorest mechanic, the man who lives upon common arms, gets him his set of admirers, and delights in that superiority which he enjoys over those who are in some respect beneath him. This ambition, which is natu∣ral to the soul of man, might methinks receive a very happy turn; and, if it were rightly directed, contribute as much to a person's advantage, as it generally does to his uneasiness and disquiet.</P>
<BIBL>SPECTATOR.</BIBL>
<P>If we look abroad upon the great multitude of man∣kind, and endeavor to trace out the principles of action in every individual, it will, I think, seem highly probable, that ambition runs through the whole spe∣cies, and that every man, in proportion to the vigor of his complexion, is more or less actuated by it. It is indeed no uncommon thing to meet with men, who by the natural bent of their inclinations, and without the discipline of philosophy, aspire not to the heights of power and grandeur; who never set their hearts upon a numerous train of clients and dependen∣cies, nor other gay appendages of greatness; who are contented with a competency, and will not molest their tranquility to gain an abundance. But it is not there∣fore to be concluded, that such a man is not ambitious. His desires may cut out another channel, and deter∣mine him to other pursuits; the motive may be, how∣ever, still the same; and in those cases, likewise, the man may be equally pushed on with the desire of distinction.</P>
<P>Though the pure consciousness of worthy actions, abstracted from the views of popular applause, be to a generous mind an ample reward; yet the desire of distinction was doubtless implanted in our natures as an additional incentive to exert ourselves in virtuous excellence.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="037099_0037_100C4C3975821AD8"/>
This passion, like all others, is frequently perverted to evil and ignoble purposes; so that we may account for many of the excellencies and follies of life upon the same innate principles; to wit, the desire of being remarkable. For this, as it has been differently cul∣tivated by education, study, and converse, will bring forth suitable effects, as it falls in with an ingenious companion, or a corrupt mind: it does also express itself in acts of magnanimity or selfish cunning, as it meets with a good or weak understanding. As it has been employed in embellishing the mind, or adorning the outside, it renders the man eminently praise-worthy or ridiculous. Ambition, therefore, is not to be con∣fined only to one passion or pursuit; for as the same humours, in constitutions otherwise different, affect the body after different manners, so the same aspiring principle within us sometimes breaks forth upon one object, sometimes upon another.</P>
<P>It cannot de doubted, but that there is as great a desire of glory in a ring of wrestlers or cudgel-players, as in any other more refined competition for superiority. No man, that could avoid it, would ever suffer his head to be broken, but out of a principle of honor.</P>
<P><HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>Ambition raises a secret tumult in the soul; it in∣flames the mind, and puts it into a violent hurry of thought. It is still reaching after an empty imaginary good, that has not in it the power to abate or satisfy it. Most other things we long for can allay the cravings of their proper sense, and for a while set the appetite at rest: but same is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so wholly foreign to our na∣ture, that we have no faculty in the soul adapted to it, nor any organ in the body to relish it; an object of de∣sire placed out of the possibility of fruition.</P>
<P><HI>ibid.</HI></P>
<P>There is scarce a man living, who is not actuated by ambition. When this principle meets with an
<PB N="30" REF="037099_0038_100C4C3BE9BB6150"/>
honest mind and great abilities, it does infinite service to the world; on the contrary, when a man only thinks of distinguishing himself, without being thus qualified for it, he becomes a very pernicious or a very ridicu∣lous creature.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI></BIBL>
<P>The great are deceived if they imagine they have appropriated ambition and vanity to themselves. These noble qualities flourish as notably in a country church, or church-yard, as in the drawing-room, or in the clo∣set.—Schemes have been laid in a vestry, which would hardly disgrace a conclave.—Here is a ministry, and here is an opposition—here are plots and circumven∣tions, parties and factions, equal to those which are to be found in courts.</P>

<P>GOLDSMITH.</P>
<P>Of all the impertinent wishes which we hear expressed in conversation, there is not one more un∣worthy a gentleman, or a man of liberal education, than that of wishing one's self younger. It is a certain sign of a foolish or a dissolute mind, if we want our youth again only for the strength of bones and si∣news which we once were masters of. It is as absurd in an old man to wish for the strength of a youth, as it would be in a young man to wish for the strength of a bull or a horse. These wishes are both equally out of nature, which should direct in all things that are not contradictory to justice, law, and reason.</P>
<P>Age in a virtuous person of either sex carries in it an authority, which makes it preferable to all the pleasures of youth. If to be saluted, attended, and consulted with deference, are instances of pleasure, they are such as never fail a virtuous old-age. In the enumeration of the imperfections and advantages of the younger and later years of man, they are so near in their condition, that methinks it should be incredible we see so little commerce of kindness between them.</P>
<P>If we consider youth and age with Tusly, regarding the affinity to death, youth has many more chances to be nearer it than age; what youth can say, more than an old man, "I shall live till night?" Youth catches distempers more easily, its sickness is more violent, and its recovery more doubtful. The youth, indeed, hopes for many more days; so cannot the old man. The youth's hopes are ill grounded; for what is more foolish than to place any confidence upon an uncertain∣ty? But the old man has not room so much as for hope; he is still happier than the youth; he has already en∣joyed
<PB N="32" REF="037099_0040_100C4C3FECA06488"/>
what the other does but hope for: one wishes to live long, the other has lived long. But, alas, is there any thing in human life, the duration of which can be called long? There is nothing, which must end to be valued for its continuance. It hours, days, months, and years, pass away, it is no matter what hour, what day, what month, or what year we die. The applause of a good actor is due to him at whatever scene of the play he makes his <HI>Exit.</HI> It is thus in the life of a man of sense; a short life is sufficient to manifest himself a man of honour and virtue; when he ceases to be such, he has lived too long; and, while he is such, it is of no consequence to him how long he shall be so, provided he is so to his life's end.</P>

<P>We should cast all our actions under the division of such as are in themselves good, bad, or indifferent; and to direct them in such a manner, that every thing we do, may turn to account at that great day when every thing we have done will be set before us.</P>
<P>A good intention, joined to a good action, gives it its proper force and efficacy; joined to an evil action, extenuates its malignity, and in some cases may take it wholly away; and joined to an indifferent action, turns it into a virtue, and makes it meritorious, as far as human actions can be so.</P>

same reason, every one is eager to instruct his neigh∣bours. To be wise or to be virtuous, is to buy dignity and importance at a high price: but when nothing is necessary to elevation but detection of the follies or the faults of others, no man is so insensible to the voice of fame as to linger on the ground.</P>

<P>There is nothing which we receive with so much reluctance as advice. We look upon the man who gives it us, as offering an affront to our understanding, and treating us like children or idiots. There is no∣thing so difficult as the art of making advice agreeable: the pens of the ancients and moderns have been exercis∣ed upon this occasion. How many devices have been made use of to render this bitter potion palatable! Some convey their instruction to us in the best chosen words; others in the most harmonious numbers; some in points of wit, and others in short proverbs.</P>
<P>But among all the different ways of giving coun∣sel, that which pleases the most universally, is <HI>fable:</HI> it excels all others, because it is the least shock∣ing, and therefore the most delicate. This will ap∣pear, if we reflect, that upon the reading of a fa∣ble we are made to believe we advise ourselves. We peruse the author for the sake of the story, and con∣sider the precepts rather as our own conclusions than his instructions. This is confirmed by the examples of the wise men of old, who chose to give council to their princes in this method; an instance of which we have in a <HI>Turkish</HI> tale, which informs us, that the Sultan <HI>Mahamoud,</HI> by his perpetual wars abroad, and his tyranny at home, had filled his dominions with ruin and desolation, and half unpeopled the <HI>Persian</HI> empire. The Visier to this cruel Sultan pretended to have learned of a certain Dervise, to understand the language of birds; so that there was not a bird that could open his mouth, but the Visier knew what it said. As he was one evening with the Emperor, in their return from hunting, they saw a couple of
<PB N="36" REF="037099_0044_100C4C497298DD98"/>
owls upon a tree that grew near an old wall out of a heap of rubbish. <HI>I would fain know,</HI> says the Sultan, <HI>what these two owls are saying to one another; listen to their discourse, and give me an account of it.</HI> The Visier approached the tree, pretending to be very attentive to the two owls. Upon his return to the Sultan, <HI>Sir,</HI> says he, <HI>I have heard part of their conversation, but dare not tell you what it is.</HI> The Sultan would not be satis∣fied with such an answer, but forced him to repeat, word for word, every thing the owls had said. <HI>You must know then,</HI> said the Visier, <HI>that one of these owls has a son, and the other a daughter, between whom they are now upon a treaty of marriage. The father of the son said to the father of the daughter, in my hearing: Bro∣ther, I consent to this marriage, provided you will settle up∣on your daughter fifty ruined villages for her portion. To which the father of the daughter replied; instead of fifty, I will give her five hundred, if you please. God grant a long life to Sultan</HI> Mahamoud; <HI>whilst he reigns over us, we shall never want ruined villages.</HI></P>
<P>The story says, the Sultan was so touched with the fable, that he rebuilt the towns and villages which had been destroyed, and from that time forward consulted the good of his people.</P>

Since the circulation of the blood has been found out, and many other great discoveries have been made by our modern anatomists, we see new wonders in the human frame; and discern several important uses for those parts which the ancients knew nothing of. In short, the body of man is such a subject, as stands the utmost test of examination. Though it appears formed with the nicest wisdom, upon the most superficial survey of it, it still mends upon the search, and produces our surprise and amazement in proportion as we pry into it.

<P>Our natures are so perverse and corrupt, that it is very hard for us to give a loose to any angry passion against men, without running into some sentiments of malice or revenge, and thereby sinning against God.

<P>It is therefore with the utmost caution that this passion should ever be suffered to arise; and unless we quickly suppress it again, we shall be in great danger of bringing guilt upon our souls.

<P>He who proposes the satisfaction of his own pride from the admiration of others, and will not lower himself to those who cannot rise to him, will never gain his point equal to him who accommodates his talents to times and occasions. In the company of the former, every one is rendered uneasy, laments his own want of knowledge, and longs for the end of the dull assembly. With the latter, all are pleased and con∣tented with themselves, in their knowledge of matters which they find worthy the consideration of a man of sense. Admiration is involuntarily paid the former; to the latter it is given joyfully. The former receives it with envy and hatred; the latter enjoys it, as the sweet fruit of good-will. The former is shunned, the latter courted by all.</P>

<HEAD>ATTENTION.</HEAD>
<P>A student should labour by all proper methods to acquire a steady fixation of thought. Attention is a very necessary thing in order to improve our minds. The evidence of truth does not always appear imme∣diately, nor strike the soul at first sight. 'Tis by long attention and inspection that we arrive at evidence, and it is for want of it we judge falsely of many things,
<PB N="51" REF="037099_0059_100C4C6DF7F9B640"/>
We make haste to judge and determine upon a flight and sudden view; we confirm our guesses which arise from a glance; we pass a judgment while we have but a confused or obscure perception, and thus plunge our∣selves into mistakes. This is like a man, who, walk∣ing in a mist, or being at a great distance from any visible object, (suppose a tree, a man, a horse, or a church) judges much amiss of the figure and situation and colours of it, and sometimes takes one for the other; whereas if he would but withhold his judgment, till he come nearer to it, or stay till clearer light comes, and then would fix his eyes longer upon it, he would secure himself from those mistakes.</P>

<P>Mathematical studies have a strange influence to∣wards fixing the attention of the mind, and giving a steadiness to a wandering disposition, because they deal much in lines, figures and numbers, which affect and please the sense and imagination. Histories have a strong tendency the same way; for they engage the soul by a variety of sensible occurrences; when it has begun, it knows not how to leave off; it longs to know the final event, through a natural curiosity that belongs to mankind. Voyages and travels and accounts of strange countries and strange appearances will assist in this work. This fort of study detains the mind by the perpetual occurrence and expectation of something new, and that which may gratefully strike the imagina∣tion.</P>

<HEAD>AGREEABLE MAN.</HEAD>
<P>The desire of pleasing makes a man agreeable or un∣welcome to those with whom he converses, according to the motive from which that inclination appears to flow. If your concern for pleasing others arise from innate benevolence, it never fails of success; if from a vanity to excel, its disappointment is no less certain.
<PB N="52" REF="037099_0060_100C4C70854336B8"/>
What we call an agreeable man, is he who is endowed with the natural bent to do acceptable things, from a delight he takes in them merely as such; and the af∣fectation of that character is what constitutes a fop. Under these leaders one may draw up all those who make any manner of figure, except in dumb show. A rational and select conversation is composed of per∣sons who have the talent of pleasing with delicacy of sentiments, flowing from habitual chastity of thought. Now and then you meet with a man so exactly formed for pleasing, that will make him gain upon every body who hears or beholds him. This felicity is not the gift of nature only, but must be attended with happy circumstances, which add a dignity to the familiar be∣haviour which distinguishes him whom we call the a∣greeable man. It is from this that every body loves and esteems <HI>Polycarpus.</HI> He is in the vigor of his age, and the gaiety of his life; but has passed through very conspicuous scenes in it: though no soldier, he has shared the danger, and acted with great gallantry and generosity, in a decisive day of battle. To have those qualities which only make other men conspicuous in the world, as it were supernumerary to him, is a cir∣cumstance which gives weight to his most indifferent actions; for as a known credit is ready cash to a tra∣der, so is acknowledged merit immediate distinction, and serves in the place of equipage to a gentleman. This renders <HI>Polycarpus</HI> graceful in mirth, important in business, and regarded with love in every ordinary occurrence.</P>

what we ordinarily call a good companion, but essen∣tially is such, and in all parts of his conversation has something friendly in his behaviour, which conciliates men's minds more than the highest sallies of wit or starts of humour can possibly do. The feebleness of age, in a man of this turn, has something which should be treated with respect even in a man no otherwise ve∣nerable. The forwardness of youth, when it proceeds from alacrity, and not insolence, has also its allowan∣ces. The companion who is formed for such by na∣ture, gives to every character in life its due regard, and is ready to account for their imperfections, and receive their accomplishments, as if they were his own. It must appear that you receive saw from, and not give it to, your company, to make you agreeable.</P>

<P>The mourner was sitting on a stone bench at the door, with the ass's pannel and its bridle on one side, which he took up from time to time—then laid them down—look'd at them—and shook his head He then took the crust of bread out of his wallet again, as if to eat it; held it some time in his hand—then laid it upon the bit of his ass's bridle—look'd wistfully at the little arrangement he had made—and then gave a sigh.</P>

The simplicity of his grief drew numbers about him, and <HI>La Fleur</HI> among the rest, whilst the horses were getting ready; as I continued sitting in the post-chaise, I could see and hear over their heads.</P>
<P>—He said he had come last from <HI>Spain,</HI> where he had been from the furthest borders of <HI>Franconia;</HI> and had got so far on his return home, when his ass died. Every one seemed desirous to know what business could have taken so old and poor a man so far a journey from his own home.</P>
<P>It had pleased heaven, he said, to bless him with three sons, the finest lads in all <HI>Germany:</HI> but having in one week lost two of them by the small-pox, and the youngest falling ill of the same distemper, he was a∣fraid of being bereft of them all; and made a vow, if Heaven would not take <HI>him</HI> from him also, he would go in gratitude to <HI>St. Jago,</HI> in <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>When the mourner got thus far on his story, he stopp'd to pay nature her tribute—and wept bitterly.</P>
<P>He said Heaven had accepted the conditions, and that he had set out from his cottage, with this poor creature, who had been a patient partner of his journey—that it had eat the same bread with him all the way, and was unto him as a friend.</P>
<P>Every body who stood about, heard the poor fellow with concern—<HI>La Fleur</HI> offered him money—the mourner said he did not want it—it was not the value of the ass—but the loss of him—The ass, he said, he was assured, loved him,—and upon this, told them a long story of a mischance upon their passage over the <HI>Pyrenean</HI> mountains, which had separated them from each other three days: during which time the ass had sought him as much as he had sought the ass, and they had scarce eat or drank till they met.</P>
<P><Q>Thou hast one comfort, friend, said I, at least, in the loss of the poor beast; I'm sure thou hast been a merciful master to him.</Q>—<Q>Alas! said the mourner, I thought so when he was alive—but now

<HEAD>APPREHENSIONS, (Rules for Moderating.)</HEAD>
<P><HI>First,</HI> What we fear may not come to pass. No human scheme can be so accurately projected, but some little circumstance intervening may spoil it. He who directs the heart of man at his pleasure, and un∣derstands the thoughts long before, may, by ten thou∣sand accidents, or an immediate change in the incli∣nations of men, disconcert the most subtle project, and turn it to the benefit of his own servants.</P>
<P>In the next place, we should consider, though the evil we imagine, should come to pass, it may be much more supportable than it appeared to be. As there is no prosperous state of life without its calamities, so there is no adversity without its benefits. Ask the great and powerful, if they do not feel the pangs of en∣vy and ambition. Enquire of the poor and needy, if they have not tasted the sweets of quiet and content∣ment. Even under the pains of body, the infidelity of friends, or the misconstructions put upon our lau∣dable actions, our minds (when for some time accus∣tomed to these pressures) are sensible of secret flowings of comfort, the present reward of a pious resignation. The evils of this life appear like rocks and precipices, rugged and barren at a distance; but at our nearer ap∣proach we find little fruitful spots and refreshing springs, mixed with the harshness and deformities of nature.</P>
<P>In the last place, we may comfort ourselves with this consideration, that, as the thing feared may not reach
<PB N="56" REF="037099_0064_100C4C7A5845C690"/>
us, so we may not reach what we fear. Our lives may not extend to that dreadful point which we have in view. He who knows all our fallings, and will not suffer us to be tempted beyond our strength, is often pleased, in his tender severity, to separate the soul from its body and miseries together.</P>
<P>If we look forward to him for help, we shall never be in danger of falling down those precipices, which our imagination is apt to create. Like those who walk upon a line, if we keep our eye fixed upon one point, we may step forward securely; whereas an imprudent or cowardly glance on either side will infallibly destroy us.</P>

<HEAD>CLEANLINESS</HEAD>
<P>Is a mark of politeness. It is universally agreed upon, that no one, unadorned with this virtue, can go into company without giving a manifest offence. The easier or higher any one's fortune is, this duty rises proportionably. The different nations of the world are as much distinguished by their cleanliness, as by their arts and sciences. The more any country is civilized, the more they consult this part of polite∣ness. We need but compare our ideas of a female Hottentot and an English beauty, to be satisfied of the truth of what hath been advanced.</P>
<P>In the next place, cleanliness may be said to be the foster mother of love. Beauty indeed most com∣monly produces that passion in the mind, but cleanli∣ness preserves it. An indifferent face and person, kept in perpetual neatness, has won many a heart from a pretty slattern. Age itself is not unamiable, while it is preserved clean and unsullied: like a piece of metal constantly kept smooth and bright, we look on it with more pleasure than on a new vessel which is cankered with rust.</P>
<P>I might observe farther, that, as cleanliness renders us agreeable to others, so it makes us easy to ourselves;
<PB N="68" REF="037099_0076_100C4C97327DA4D8"/>
that it is an excellent preservative of health; and that several vices destructive both to mind and body, are inconsistent with the habit of it. But these reflections I shall leave to the leisure of my readers, and shall observe in the third place, that it bears a great analogy with purity of mind, and naturally inspires refined sen∣timents and passions.</P>

<P>Suppose we have freed ourselves from the younger prejudices of our education, yet we are in danger of having our mind turned aside from truth by the influ∣ence of general custom. Our opinion of meats and

drinks, of garments and forms of salutation, are in∣fluenced more by custom, than by the eye, the ear, or the taste. Custom prevails even over sense itself; and therefore no wonder if it prevail over reason too. What is it but custom, that renders many of the mix∣tures of food and sauces elegant in Britain, which would be aukward and nauseous to the inhabitants of China, and indeed were nauseous to us when we first tasted them? what but custom could make those salutations polite in Muscovy, which are ridiculous in France and England? We call ourselves indeed the po∣liter nations: but it is <HI>we</HI> who judge thus of ourselves; and that fancied politeness is oftentimes more owing to custom than reason. Why are the forms of our pre∣sent garments counted beautiful, and those fashions of our ancestors the matter of scoff and contempt, which in their days, were all decent and genteel? It is custom that forms our opinion of dress, and reconciles us by degrees to those habits which at first seemed very odd and monstrous. It must be granted, there are some garments and habits which have a natural congruity or incongruity, modesty or immodesty, gaudiness or gravity; though for the most part there is but little rea∣son in these affairs; but what little there is of reason, or natural decency, custom triumphs over it all. It is almost impossible to persuade a young lady that any thing can be decent which is out of fashion.</P>

He is never out of humour at being interrupted, because he considers that those who hear him, are the best judges whether what he was saying could either divert or inform them.</P>
<P>A modest person seldom fails to gain the good will of those he converses with, because nobody envies a man who does not appear to be pleased with himself.</P>
<P>We should talk extremely little of ourselves. Indeed what can we say? It would be as imprudent to disco∣ver our faults, as ridiculous to count over our fancied virtues. Our private and domestic affairs are no less improper to be introduced in conversation. What does it concern the company how many horses you keep in your stables? Or whether your servant is most knave or fool?</P>
<P>A man may equally affront the company he is in by engrossing all the talk, or observing a contemptuous silence.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="037099_0085_100C4CAC80648278"/>
Before you tell a story, it may be generally not amiss to draw a short character, and give the company a true idea of the principal persons concerned in it; the beauty of most things consisting not so much in their being said or done, as in their being said or done by such a particular person, or on such a particular occa∣sion.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding all the advantages of youth, few young people please in conversation; the reason is, that want of experience makes them positive, and what they say is rather with a design to please them∣selves than any one else.</P>
<P>It is certain that age itself shall make many things pass well enough, which would have been laughed at in the mouth of one much younger.</P>
<P>Nothing, however, is more insupportable to men of sense, than an empty formal man who speaks in pro∣verbs, and decides all controversies with a short sen∣tence. This piece of stupidity is the more insuffera∣ble, as it puts on the air of wisdom.</P>
<P>Whenever you commend, add your reasons for do∣ing so: it is this which distinguishes the approbation of a man of sense from the flattery of sycophants, and admiration of fools.</P>
<P>Raillery is no longer agreeable than while the whole company is pleased with it. I would least of all be understood to except the person rallied.</P>
<BIBL>GUARDIAN.</BIBL>
<P>Observe this rule in general; whensoever it lies in your power to lead the conversation, let it be directed to some profitable point of knowledge or practice, so far as may be done with decency; and let not the dis∣course and the hours be suffered to run loose without aim or design, and when a subject is started, pass not hastily to another, before you have brought the present theme of discourse to some tolerable issue, or a joint consent to drop it.</P>

There is scarce any lot so low, but there is something in it to satisfy the man whom it has befallen; Provi∣dence having so ordered things, that in every man's cup, how bitter soever, there are some cordial drops—some good circumstances, which, if wisely extracted, are sufficient for the purpose he wants them—that is, to make him contented, and, if not happy, at least resigned.</P>
<BIBL>STERNE.</BIBL>
<P>There are thousands so extravagant in their ideas of contentment, as to imagine that it must consist in hav∣ing every thing in this world turn out the way they wish—that they are to sit down in happiness, and feel themselves so at ease at all points, as to desire nothing better and nothing more. I own there are instances of some, who seem to pass through the world as if all their paths had been strewed with rose buds of delight;—but a little experience will convince us, 'tis a fatal ex∣pectation to go upon.—We are born to trouble; and we may depend upon it whilst we live in this world we shall have it, though with intermissions—that is, in whatever state we are, we shall find a mixture of good and evil; and therefore the true way to contentment is to know how to receive these certain vicissitudes of life,—the returns of good and evil, so as neither to be ex∣alted by the one, or overthrown by the other, but to bear ourselves towards every thing which happens with such ease and indifference of mind, as to hazard as lit∣tle as may be. This is the true temperate climate fitted for us by nature, and in which every wise man would with to live.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI></BIBL>
<P>The foundation of content must spring up in a man's own mind; and he who has so little knowledge of human nature as to seek happiness by changing any thing but his own disposition, will waste his life in fruitless efforts, and multiply the griefs which he pur∣poses to remove.</P>

Enquiries after happiness, and rules for attaining it, are not so necessary and useful to mankind as the arts of consolation, and supporting one's self under afflic∣tion. The utmost we can hope for in this world, is contentment; if we aim at any thing higher, we shall meet with nothing but grief and disappointment A man should direct all his studies and endeavours at making himself easy now, and happy hereafter.</P>
<P>The truth of it is, if all the happiness that is dis∣persed through the whole race of mankind in this world were drawn together, and put into the possession of any single man, it would not make a very happy being: though, on the contrary, if the miseries of the whole species were fixed in a single person, they would make a very miserable one.</P>

All the real pleasures and conveniences of life lie in a narrow compass; but it is the humour of mankind to be always looking forward, and straining after one who has got the start of them in wealth and honour.</P>

<HEAD>CREDULITY.</HEAD>
<P>The credulous man is ready to receive every thing for truth, that has but the shadow of evidence; every new book that he reads, and every ingenious man with whom he converses, has power enough to draw him into the sentiments of the speaker or writer. He has so much complaisance in him, or weakness of soul,
<PB N="89" REF="037099_0097_100C4CC880C017C8"/>
that he is ready to resign his own opinion to the first objection which he hears, and to receive any sentiments of another that are asserted with a positive air and much assurance. Thus he is under a kind of necessity, through the indulgence of this credulous humour, either to be often changing his opinions, or to believe inconsistencies.</P>
<P>The man of contradiction stands ready to oppose every thing that is said: he gives but a slight attention to the reasons of other men, from an inward scornful presumption, that they have no strength in them. When he reads or hears a discourse different from his own sentiments, he does not give himself leave to con∣sider, whether that discourse may be true; but employs all his powers immediately to confute it. Your great disputers, and your men of controversy, are in contin∣ual danger of this sort of prejudice: they contend often for victory, and will maintain whatsoever they have asserted, while truth is lost in the noise and tumult of reciprocal contradictions; and it frequently happens, that a debate about opinions is turned into a mutual reproach of persons.</P>
<BIBL>WATTS.</BIBL>
<P>The prejudice of credulity may in some measure be cured, by learning to set a high value upon truth, and by taking more pains to attain it; remembering that truth often lies dark and deep, and requires us to dig for it as hidden treasure; and that falshood often puts on a fair disguise, and therefore we should not yield up our judgment to every plausible appearance. It is no part of civility or good breeding to part with truth, but to maintain it with decency and candor.</P>
<P>A spirit of contradiction is so pedantic and hateful, that a man should take much pains with himself to watch against every instance of it: he should learn so much good-humour, at least, as never to oppose any thing without just and solid reason for it: he should abate some degrees of pride and moroseness, which are
<PB N="90" REF="037099_0098_100C4CCC526532B0"/>
never-failing ingredients in this sort of temper, and should seek after so much honesty and conscience, as never to contend for conquest or triumph; but to re∣view his own reasons, and to read the arguments of his opponents, if possible, with an equal indifferency, be glad to spy a truth, and to submit to it, though it appear on the opposite side.</P>

<P>Let us take a survey of the world, and see what a mix∣ture there is of amiable and hateful qualities among the children of men. There is beauty and comeliness; there is vigour and vivacity; there is good humour and compassion; there is wit, and judgment, and in∣dustry, even among those that are profligate and abandoned to many vices. There is sobriety, and love, and honesty, and justice, and decency amongst men that "know not" God, and believe not the gos∣pel of our "Lord Jesus." There are very few of the sons and daughters <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Adam, but are possessed of something good and agreeable, either by nature or acquirement; therefore when there is a necessary occa∣sion to mention the vices of any man, we should not speak evil of him in the gross, nor heap reproaches on him by wholesale. It is very disingenuous to talk scan∣dal in superlatives, as though every man who was a sin∣ner, was a perfect villain, the very worst of men, all over hateful and abominable.</P>

<HEAD>CHARITY.</HEAD>
<P>Though the goodness of a man's heart did not in∣cline him to acts of <HI>charity,</HI> one would think the desire of <HI>honour</HI> should. For as building fine houses, purchas∣ing fine clothes, pictures and other such like articles of expense, shows nothing more than an ambition to be respected above other people: would not one great act of charity, one instance of redeeming a poor family from all the miseries of poverty, or restoring an unfortunate tradesman to the means of procuring a livelihood by his industry, acquire more real respect and more lasting-honour? The former are the works of other people's hands—the latter the <HI>acts of his own heart.</HI></P>

<P>Charity is a virtue of the heart, and not of the hands, says an old writer. Gifts and alms are the expressions, not the essence of this virtue. A man may bestow great sums on the poor and indigent without being charitable, and may be charitable when he is not able to bestow any thing. Charity therefore is a habit of good-will or benevolence in the soul, which disposes us to the love, assistance, and relief of mankind, es∣pecially of those who stand in need of it. The poor man who has this excellent frame of mind, is no less entitled to the reward of this virtue, than the man who founds a college. For my own part, I am charitable to an extravagance this way: I never saw an indigent person in my life, without reaching out to him some of this imaginary relief. I cannot but sym∣pathise with every one I meet that is in affliction, and if my abilities were equal to my wishes, there should be neither pain nor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the world.</P>

<P>There are many arts of graciousness and conciliation which are to be practised without expence, and by which those may be made our friends, who have never received from us any real benefit.

The universal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in which an complaisance is included, and from which flow all the formalities which custom has established in civilized nations, is, "That no man should give any preference to himself," a rule so comprehensive and certain, that perhaps it is not easy for the mind to imagine an incivility without supposing it to be broken.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Wisdom and virtue are by no means sufficient, without the supplemental laws of good breeding, to se∣cure freedom from degenerating into rudeness, or self-esteem from swelling into insolence. A thousand incivilities may be committed, and a thousand offices neglected, without any remorse of conscience, or re∣proach from reason.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Complaisance renders a superior amiable, an e∣qual agreeable, and an inferior acceptable. It smooths distinction, sweetens conversation, and makes every one in the company pleased with himself. It pro∣duces good-nature and mutual benevolence, encou∣rages the timorous, soothes the turbulent, humanizes the fierce, and distinguishes the society of civilized persons from a confusion of savages. In a word, complaisance is a virtue that blends all orders of men together in a friendly intercourse of words and actions, and is suited to that equality in human nature which every one ought to consider, so far as is consistent with the order and economy of the world.</P>
<P>If we could look into the secret anguish and affliction of every man's heart, we should often find, that more of it arises from little imaginary distresses, such as checks, frowns, contradictions, expressions of contempt, and (what <HI>Shakespeare</HI> reckons among other evils under the Sun)

than from the more real pains and calamities of life. The only method to remove these imaginary distresses as much as possible out of human life, would be the universal practice of such an ingenuous complaisance as I have been here describing, which, as it is a virtue, may be defined to be, <HI>a constant endeavour to please those whom we converse with, so far as we may do it innocently.</HI></P>

<PB N="95" REF="037099_0103_100C4CD1CB21C310"/>
the great author of our being, it will not a little re∣commend itself on each of these accounts. The man who is possessed of this excellent frame of mind is not only easy in his thoughts, but a perfect master of all the powers and faculties of his soul▪ his imagination is always clear, and his judgment undisturbed: his temper is even and unruffled, whether in action or in solitude. He comes with a relish to all those goods which nature has provided for him, tastes all the pleasures of the creation which are poured about him, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not feel the full weight of those accidental evils which may befall him.</P>
<P>If we consider him in relation to the persons whom he converses with, it naturally produces love and good∣will towards him. A cheerful mind is not only disposed to be affable and obliging, but raises the same good-humour in those who come within its influence. A man finds himself pleased, he does not know why, with the cheerfulness of his companion. It is like a sudden sunshine that awakens a secret delight in the mind, without her attending to it. The heart rejoices of its own accord, and naturally flows out into friendship and benevolence towards the person who has so kindly an effect upon it.</P>
<P>When I consider this cheerful state of mind in its third relation, I cannot but look upon it as a constant habitual gratitude to the great author of nature. An inward cheerfulness is an implicit praise and thanks∣giving to providence under all its dispensations. It is a kind of acquiescence in the state wherein we are placed, and a secret approbation of the divine will in his conduct towards man.</P>

<HEAD>CAUSES OF WAR.</HEAD>
<P>Sometimes the quarrel between two princes is to de∣cide which of them shall dispossess a third of his do∣minions, where neither of them pretend to any right. Sometimes one prince quarreleth with another, for fear the other should quarrel with him. Sometimes a war is entered upon because the enemy is too strong; and sometimes because he is too weak. Sometimes our neighbours want the things which we have, or have the things which we want; and we both fight till they take ours, or give us theirs. It is a very justifiable cause of war, to invade a country after the people have been wast∣ed by famine, destroyed by pestilence, or embroiled by factions among themselves. It is justifiable to enter into a war against our nearest ally, when one of his towns lie convenient for us, or a territory of land, that would render our dominions round and compact. If a prince sends forces into a nation, where the people are poor and ignorant, he may lawfully put half of them to death, and make slaves of the rest, in order to civilize and reduce them from their barbarous way of living.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="037099_0105_100C4CD77B5D3C30"/>
It is a very kingly, honourable, and frequent practice, when one prince desires the assistance of another to se∣cure him against an invasion, that the assistant, when he hath driven out the invader, should seize on the dominions himself, and kill, imprison, or banish the prince he came to relieve. Alliance by blood or mar∣riage is a frequent cause of war between princes; and the nearer the kindred is, the greater is their disposition to quarrel. There is likewise a kind of beggarly prin∣ces in Europe, not able to make war by themselves, who hire out their troops to richer nations, for so much a day to each man, of which they keep three fourths to themselves, and it is the best part of their maintenance.</P>
<BIBL>SWIFT.</BIBL>
<P>A genealogist sets forth to a prince that he is descend∣ed in a direct line from a count, whose kindred, three or four hundred years ago, had made a family compact with a house, the memory of which is extinguished. That house had some distant claim to a province, the last proprietor of which died of an apoplexy. The prince and his council instantly resolve that this province belongs to him of divine right. The province, which is some hundred leagues from him, protests that it does not so much as know him; that it is not disposed to be governed by him; that before prescribing laws to them, their consent at least was necessary: these allega∣tions do not so much as reach the prince's ears; it is insisted on that his right is incontestible. He instantly picks up a multitude, who have nothing to do and no∣thing to lose; clothes them with coarse blue cloth; puts on them hats bound with coarse white worsted; makes them turn to the right and left; and thus marches away with them to glory.</P>
<P>Other princes, on this armament, take part in it to the best of their ability, and soon cover a small extent of country with more hireling murderers, than Gengis Kan, Tamerlane and Bajazet had at their heels.</P>

People at no small distance, on hearing that fighting is going forward, and that if they would make one, there are five or six <HI>sous</HI> a day for them, immediately divide into two bands, like reapers, and go and sell their servi∣ces to the best bidder.</P>
<P>These multitudes furiously butcher one another not only without having any concern in the quarrel, but without so much as knowing what it is about.</P>
<P>Sometimes five or six powers are engaged, three against three, two against four, sometimes even one against five, all equally detesting one another, and friends and foes by turns, agreeing only in one thing, to do all the mis∣chief possible.</P>

<P>Oppressed with gloomy melancholy, I threw my∣self on my bed, in order to forget what I had seen, and still more what I had read. Sleep soon invaded my senses.

fall on thy head. Power supported thy iron arm, that crushed mankind; thou destroyedst my laws by firing of towns; thou didst oblige terrified mortals to erect altars to thee; thou didst stab the bosom of friendship; the scandal of thy victories has led kings astray, who, taking example by thee, have been unjust. Approach, cruel Caesar, thou who wept before the statue of this murderer, ambitious of deserving such another. Nothing could stop thy career, neither the genius of Rome, nor the tears of thy country. Armed with a poniard, thou stabbedst her whilst she invited thee to her arms. Thou de∣stroyedst the wisdom of six ages of glory, in order to establish on their ruins horrible despotism. Get thee gone, thy name begins to be as detestable as those of Tamerlane, Attila, Charles the XIIth, and Gengiskan.—Wise men have proscribed their odi∣ous and destructive genius; it is only the blind mul∣titude who are still seduced, and who, in their low ideas, cannot discriminate between the powerful criminal who escapes punishment, and the obscure guilty who suffers justly.</P>
<P>Princes, conquerors, generals, warriors, whate∣ver pompous titles you bear, vile ambitious wretch∣es, bloody men, shudder!—You have accustomed mankind to destroy each other; you have made war an habitual scourge, and ever growing trade; you have dared to embellish murder with the pompous name of glory; it is you, undoubtedly, will be an∣swerable for the crimes you have made them com∣mit;—but who ever comes to offer you the hand stained with blood, he that could put a stop to cru∣elty, or avoid being an accomplice in it, or has been a volunteer to serve your wrathful purposes for base interest; he, I say, will be as guilty as yourselves. By what authority dare a mortal inflict death? Does not his existence belong to God who created him? Destruction is an outrage against the Divine Being.

<P>I am not of your opinion, with regard to despotism and despots. It appears to me horrible and absurd to the last degree, that a whole people should blindly sub∣ject themselves to the caprice of one man, even if he were an angel. For my own part, I would not live under him a single day. This angel may become in a moment a monster thirsting after blood. Despotism is to me the most abominable and disgustful of all bad governments; man is perpetually crushed, debased and degraded by it.

Despotism delights in war. It is its element. As the bull knows, by instinct, that his strength is in his horns, and the eagle trusts in his talons; so the despot feels his puissance most, when surrounded by his sol∣diery arrayed for battle. With the sword in his hand, and his artillery around him, he rejoices in his might, and glories in his greatness. Blood must mark his path; and his triumph is incomplete, till death and destruction stalk over the land, the harbingers of his triumphant cavalcade.</P>
<BIBL>Spirit of DESPOTISM.</BIBL>
<P>What are the chief considerations with despots, previ∣ously to going to war, and at its conclusion? Evidently the expence of <HI>money.</HI> Little is said or thought of the lives lost, or devoted to be lost, except as matters of pecuniary value. Humanity, indeed, weeps in silence and solitude, in the sequestered shade of private life; but is a single tear shed in courts, and camps, and cabi∣ners? When men high in command, men of fortune and family, fall, their deeds are blazoned, and they figure in history; but who, save the poor widow and the or∣phan, enquire after the very names of the rank and file? There they lie, a mass of human flesh, not so much regretted by the despots as the horses they rode, or the arms they bore. While ships often go down to the bottom, struck by the iron thunderbolts of war, and not a life is saved; the national loss is estimated by the despot, according to the weight of metal wasted, and the magnitude and expence of the wooden castle.</P>

I would laugh at all thy extravagancies, thy solemn mummery, thy baby baubles, thy airs of insolence, thy finery and slippery, thy impotent insults over virtue, genius, and all personal merit, thy strutting, self-pleasing mien and language!

<BIBL>DRYDEN.</BIBL>
<P>Physical knowledge is of such rare emergence, that one man may know another half his life without being able to estimate his skill in hydrostatics or astronomy; but his moral and prudential character immediately appears. Those authors, therefore, are to be read at school, that supply most axioms of prudence, most principles of moral truth, and most materials for con∣versation; and these purposes are best served by poets, orators, and historians.</P>
<BIBL>Life of MILTON.</BIBL>
<P>It ought always to be steadily inculcated, that vir∣tue is the highest proof of understanding, and the only solid basis of greatness; and that vice is the natural consequence of narrow thoughts; that it begins in mistake, and ends in ignominy.</P>
<BIBL>RAMBLER.</BIBL>
<P>I consider an human soul without education, like marble in the quarry, which shews none of its inherent beauties, till the skill of the polisher fetches out the colours, make the surface shine, and discovers every ornamental clould, spot, and vein that runs through the body of it. Education, after the same manner, when it works upon a noble mind, draws out to view every latent virtue and perfection, which, without such helps, are never able to make their appearance.</P>

<HEAD>ERROR.</HEAD>
<P>It is incumbent on every man who consults his own dignity, to retract his error as soon as he discovers it, without fearing any censure so much as that of his own mind. As justice requires that all injuries should be repaired, it is the duty of him who has seduced others by bad practices, or false notions, to endeavour that such as have adopted his errors should know his retrac∣tation, and that those who have learned vice by his ex∣ample, should, by his example, be taught amendment.</P>

<HEAD>FREEDOM.</HEAD>
<P>Countries are generally peopled in proportion as they are free, and are certainly happy in that propor∣tion; and upon the same tract of land that would maintain a hundred thousand freemen in plenty, five thousand slaves would starve. Liberty naturally draws new people to it, as well as increases the old-stock; and men as naturally run, when they dare, from slavery and wretchedness. Hence great cities, losing their li∣berties, become desarts; and little towns by liberty grow great cities.</P>
<BIBL>GORDON.</BIBL>
<P>Civil freedom is not, as many have endeavored to persuade us, a thing that lies hid in the depth of ab∣struse science. It is a blessing and a benefit, not an abstract speculation; and all the just reasoning that can be upon it, is of so coarse a texture, as perfectly to suit the ordinary capacities of those who are to enjoy, and of those who are to defend it. Far from any resemblance to those propositions in geometry and metaphysics, which admit no medium, but must be true or false in all their latitude; social and civil freedom, like all o∣ther things in common life, are variously mixed and modified, enjoyed in very different degrees, and shaped
<PB N="122" REF="037099_0130_100C4D10CF806628"/>
into an infinite diversity of forms, according to the temper and circumstances of every community. The <HI>extreme</HI> of liberty (which is its abstract perfection, but its real fault) obtains no where, nor ought to obtain any where. Because extremes, as we all know, in every point which relates either to our duties or satis∣factions in life, are destructive both to virtue and en∣joyment. Liberty too must be limited in order to be possessed. The degree of restraint it is impossible in any case to settle precisely. But it ought to be the con∣stant aim of every wise public counsel, to find out by cautious experiments, and rational, cool endeavors, with how little, not how much of this restraint, the community can subsist.</P>

Faction and violence are despotic in the extreme. They bring all the evils of tyranny, without any consolation, but that they are usually transient; whereas tyranny is durable. They destroy themselves, or, are destroyed by force in the hands of a superior power. In either case, much is <HI>lost</HI> to the cause of liberty; because the persons who have been betrayed by their passions into excesses, were probably <HI>sincere;</HI> and if they had been also <HI>discreet</HI> and moderate, would have been effectual as well as zealous promoters of the public good. It is certain, that very honest men are very apt to be betrayed into violence by their warmth of temper. They mean good and do ill. They become the instruments of dispas∣sionate knaves; and are often led into extravagances by the very party against whom they act, in order that they may be exposed, and become obnoxious to censure.</P>
<P>Wisdom is gentle, deliberate, cautious. Nothing violent is durable. I hope the lovers of liberty will shew the sincerity of their attachment by the wisdom of their conduct. Tumultuary proceedings always exhibit some appearance of insanity. A blow struck with blind violence may inflict a wound or a bruise, but it may fall in the wrong place; it may even injure the hand that gives it, by its own ill-directed force.</P>

A treacherous friend is the most dangerous enemy; and both religion and virtue have received more real discredit from hypocrites, than the wittiest profligates, or infidels could ever cast upon them; nay, farther, as these two in their purity, are rightly called the bands of civil society, and are indeed the greatest of blessings; so when poisoned and corrupted with fraud, pretence, and affectation, they have become the worst of civil cur∣ses, and have enabled men to perpetrate the most cruel mischiefs to their own species.</P>
<BIBL>FIELDING.</BIBL>
<P>The firmness and constancy of a true friend is a circumstance so extremely delightful to persons in any kind of distress, that the distress itself, (if it be only temporary, and admit of relief) is more than compen∣sated, by bringing this comfort with it.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI></BIBL>
<P>So many qualities are necessary to the possibility of friendship, and so many accidents must concur to its rise and its continuance, that the greatest part of man∣kind content themselves without it, and supply its place as they can with interest and dependence.</P>
<BIBL>RAMBLER.</BIBL>
<P>Many have talked in very exalted language of the perpetuity of friendship: of invincible constancy and unalienable kindness; and some examples have been seen of men who have continued faithful to their ear∣liest choice, and whose affections have predominated over changes of fortune and contrariety of opinion. But these instances are memorable, because they are rare. The friendship which is to be practised or ex∣pected by common mortals, must take its rise from mutual pleasure, and must end when the power ceases of delighting each other.</P>
<BIBL>IDLER.</BIBL>
<P>The most fatal disease of friendship is gradual decay, or dislike hourly increased by causes too slender for
<PB N="136" REF="037099_0144_100C4D314E51D138"/>
complaint, and too numerous for removal. Those who are angry may be reconciled. Those who have been injured may receive a recompense; but when the desire of pleasing, and willingness to be pleased, is si∣lently diminished, the renovation of friendship is hope∣less; as when the vital powers sink into languor, there is no longer any use of the physician.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI></BIBL>
<P>There are few subjects which have been more writ∣ten upon, and less understood, than that of friendship. To follow the dictates of some, this virtue, instead of being the assuager of pain, becomes the source of every inconvenience. Such speculatists, by expecting too much from friendship, dissolve the connection, and, by drawing the bands too closely, at length break them. Almost all our romance and novel-writers are of this kind; they persuade us to friendships, which we find impossible to sustain to the last; so that this sweetner of life, under proper regulations, is by their means, ren∣dered inaccessible or uneasy. It is certain, the best method to cultivate this virtue is by letting it, in some measure, make itself; a similitude of minds or studies, and even sometimes a diversity of pursuits, will pro∣duce all the pleasures that arise from it. The current of tenderness widens, as it proceeds; and two men imperceptibly find their hearts warm with good-nature for each other, when they w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re at first only in pursuit of mirth or relaxation.</P>
<P>Friendship is like a debt of honour; the moment it is talked of, it loses its real name, and assumes the more ungrateful form of obligation. From hence we find, that those who regularly undertake to cultivate friend∣ship, find ingratitude generally repays their endeavours. That circle of beings, which dependence gathers round us, is almost ever unfriendly: they secretly wish the term of their connexions more nearly equal; and, where they even have the most virtue, are prepared to reserve all their affections for their patron, only in the
<PB N="137" REF="037099_0145_100C4D3496EA8BF0"/>
hour of this decline. Increasing the obligations which are laid upon such minds, only increases their burthen; they feel themselves unable to repay the immensity of their debt, and their bankrupt hearts are taught a latent resentment at the hand that is stretched out with offers of service and relief.</P>

To soften the obdurate, to convince the mistaken, to mollify the resentful, are worthy of a statesman; but it affords a legislator little self-applause to consider, that where there was formerly an insurrection, there is now a wilderness.</P>
<BIBL>JOHNSON.</BIBL>
<P>The general story of mankind will evince, that law∣ful and settled authority is very seldom resisted when it is well employed. Gross corruption or evident im∣becility, is necessary to the suppression of that reverence, with which the majority of mankind look upon their governors, or those whom they see surrounded by splendor, and fortified by power.</P>
<BIBL>RAMBLER.</BIBL>
<P>All government, indeed every human benefit and enjoyment, every virtue, and every prudent act, is founded on compromise and barter. We balance in∣conveniencies; we give and take; we remit some rights, that we may enjoy others; and, we chuse rather to be happy citizens, than subtle disputants. As we must give away some natural liberty, to enjoy civil ad∣vantages; so we must sacrifice some civil liberties, for the advantages to be derived from the communion and fellowship of a great empire. But in all fair dealings, the thing bought, must bear some proportion to the purchase paid. None will barter away the immediate jewel of his soul.</P>

To meliorate the condition of human nature, can be the only rational end of government. It can∣not be designed to favor one description of men, a <HI>mi∣nority,</HI> at the expence of all others; who, having re∣ceived life from him who alone can give it, received at the same time a right to enjoy it in liberty and secu∣rity. This was the charter of God and nature; which no mortal, however elevated by conquest or inheri∣tance, can annul or violate without impiety. All gov∣ernment which makes not the advancement of human happiness, and the comfort of the individuals who are subject to its control, the <HI>prime</HI> purpose of its opera∣tions, partakes of despotism.</P>
<BIBL>Spirit of DESPOTISM.</BIBL>
<P>The majority of men are poor and obscure. To them all party attachments to names and families, little known as public benefactors, must appear at once absurd and injurious. They are the per∣sons who stand in most need of protection and assistance from the powerful. The rich under all gov∣ernments, have a thousand means of procuring either comfort or defence. It is the mass, the poor and middling ranks, unknown to, and unknowing courts or kings, who require all the alleviation which men enlightened by knowledge, furnished with opulence, elevated by rank, can afford to lessen the natural evils of life, aggravated by the moral and artificial. Govern∣ment possesses the power of alleviating, and sometimes of removing, that moral and physical evil which em∣bitters existence. How deplorable, when government becomes so perverted, as to increase the evil it was de∣signed to cure. Yet this has been, and is now the case on a great part of the globe; insomuch that the learn∣ed and judicious Dr. Prideaux, whose integrity is as well known as his ability, used to say, "that it was a doubt with him, whether the benefit which the world receives from government, was sufficient to make a∣mends
<PB N="148" REF="037099_0156_100C4D4EF5F0A3B8"/>
for the calamities which it suffers from the fol∣lies, mistakes, and mal-administration of those who manage it."</P>

<P>Few and evil are our days, even when they proceed to their natural extent, and are attended with the com∣mon portion of health and prosperity. Yet, as if a <HI>superfluity</HI> of years and happiness were lavished on men, the chief business of the greatest part of governments on the whole earth has been to abbreviate life, to poi∣son and embitter its sweetest pleasures, and add new pungency to its anguish. Yet see the false <HI>glitter</HI> of happiness, the pomp and parade which such govern∣ments assume; observe the gravity and insolence of su∣periority which their ministers, their statesmen, and their warriors, assume, and you would imagine them a commissioned regency, lord lieutenants sent by hea∣ven to rule this lower world, and to rectify all disor∣ders which had escaped the vigilance of the Deity. The time has been when they have actually claimed the title of God's vicegerents, and have been literally worshipped as gods by the servile crew of courtiers; men gradually bowed down by despotism from the e∣rect port of native dignity, and driven by fear to crouch under the most degrading of all superstition, the poli∣tical idolatry of a base fellow-creature.</P>

<P>I lay it down as an incontrovertible axiom, that all who are born into the world have a right to be as happy in it as the unavoidable evils of nature, and their own disordered passions, will allow. The grand object of all good government, of all government that is not an usurpation, must be to promote this happiness, to as∣sist every individual in its attainment and security. A government chiefly anxious about the emoluments of office, chiefly employed in augmenting its own power and aggrandizing its obsequious instruments, while it neglects the comfort and safety of individuals in mid∣dle
<PB N="149" REF="037099_0157_100C4D51568DFCA0"/>
or low life, is despotic and a nuisance. It is found∣ed on folly as well as wickedness, and, like the freaks of insanity, deals mischief and misery around, with∣out being able to ascertain or limit its extent and dura∣tion. If it should not be punished as criminal, let it be coerced as dangerous. Let the straight waistcoat be applied; but let <HI>men,</HI> judging fellow men, <HI>always</HI> spare the axe.</P>
<P>For what rational purpose could we enter into life? To vex, torment, and slay each other with the sword? To be and to make miserable? No, I firmly believe, that the great King of kings, intended every son and daughter of Adam to be as happy as the eternal laws of nature, under his control, permit them to be in this sublunary state. Execrated and exploded be all those politics, with Machiavel, or the Evil Being, their au∣thor, which introduce systems of government and man∣ners among the great, inconsistent with the happiness of the majority. Must real tragedies be forever act∣ing on the stage of human life? Must men go on for∣ever to be tormentors and executioners of men? Is the world never to profit by the experience of ages? Must not even <HI>attempts</HI> be made to improve the hap∣piness of life, to improve government, though all arts and sciences are encouraged in their progress to per∣fection? Must the grand art, the sublimest science, that of meliorating the condition of human nature, be stationary? No; forbid it reason, virtue, benevolence, religion! Let the world be made more and more com∣fortable, to all who are allowed the glorious privilege of seeing the sun and breathing the liberal air.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI></BIBL>
<P>The principal objects of all rational government, such as is intended to promote human happiness, are two; to preserve <HI>peace,</HI> and to diffuse <HI>plenty.</HI> Such government will seldom tax the necessaries of life. It will avoid <HI>wars;</HI> and, by such humane and wise poli∣cy, render taxes on <HI>necessaries</HI> totally superfluous.
<PB N="150" REF="037099_0158_100C4D53C0DE5210"/>
Taxes on <HI>necessaries</HI> are usually caused by war. The poor, however, are not easily excited to insurrection. It is a base calumny which accuses them. They are naturally quiescent; inclined to submission by their ha∣bits, and willing to reverence all their superiors who behave to them justly and kindly. They deserve to be used well. They deserve confidence. But oppression and persecution may teach them to lift their gigantic arm, and then vain will be resistance. Let not wars then be wantonly undertaken, which, besides their in∣justice and inhumanity, tend more than any thing else, by increasing taxes, to compel insurrection. The poor man hears great praises bestowed on the govern∣ment he lives under, and perpetual panegyrics on the constitution. He knows little of general politics. He judges from the <HI>effects</HI> he <HI>feels.</HI></P>

<BIBL>CHIPMAN'S Principles of Government.</BIBL>
<P>By the force of habit, and inveterate national preju∣dices, abuses are rendered sacred, and not unfrequent∣ly, come to be considered as rightful privileges; and those institutions, which were the offspring of chance or violence, to be extolled as the most perfect produc∣tions of reason, sounded in the original and unalterable principles of nature. Such was the British government, and such has been the force of habitual prejudice upon the people of that kingdom. That government has, indeed, received many improvements, with the im∣provements of the age; but they have generally been wrested by force from the reigning powers, or interpo∣sed in a revolution of the crown. Many respectable characters long considered them as so many violations of the most sacred rights. The greater part of the na∣tion
<PB N="151" REF="037099_0159_100C4D55A4A38828"/>
appear fully persuaded, that all farther improve∣ments are impracticable, and that because their gov∣ernment was once the best, perhaps, which existed in the world, it must, through all the progressive advan∣ces in knowledge, in morals, and in manners, con∣tinue the best, a pattern of unchanging perfection, though, in its principles, it is much too limited for the present state. It is probable that all improvements in the government, will be opposed and prevented by those in power, who are interested in the present or∣der of things, till the improvements of an enlightened age, shall produce a violent concussion in the combat with ancient prejudices, and struggle through a scene of tumult, outrage, and perhaps civil war, to arrive at some inconsiderable amelioration, in their constitu∣tion.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI></BIBL>
<P>The government of the United States of America exhibits a new scene in the political history of the world; a number of integral republics, each claiming and exercising all the powers of internal sovereignty, within the limits of their respective jurisdictions, formed into one general government, with powers of legislation for all national purposes, and the power of executing all their laws, within the several states, on the individual citizens, and that independently of the local authority. The experiment was new, and the success has, hitherto, exceeded the most sanguine ex∣pectation of its advocates. A situation so complicated, so different from that of simple governments, which have been the subject of these sketches, will have an effect, if not upon the laws of nature, from which the general principles are ultimately derived, yet to give a different modification to those principles, owing to the different combinations and relative circumstances of the constituent parts; and will have an influence on its organization, and the execution of its laws.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI></BIBL>
<P><PB N="152" REF="037099_0160_100C4D58282DB4A0"/>
That government, that constitution of society, the principles of which dictate those laws, and those only, which are adapted to the present-state of men and man∣ners, and tend to social improvement, which are in∣fluenced by a sense of moral obligation, and sanction∣ed by the laws of nature, not of savage solitary nature, but of social nature, in its improved and improvable state, is incontrovertibly good. So far as it deviates, it is clearly faulty. Upon a candid examination, up∣on a fair comparison, it will be found, that a democra∣tic republic is alone capable of this pre-eminence of principle.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Guarantee to every man, the full enjoyment of his natural rights. Banish all exclusive privileges; all perpetuities of riches and honors. Leave free the ac∣quisition and disposal of property to supply the occa∣sions of the owner, and to answer all claims of right, both of the society, and of individuals. To give a sti∣mulus to industry, to provide solace and assistance, in the last helpless stages of life, and a reward for the at∣tentions of humanity, confirm to the owner the power of directing who shall succeed to his right of property, after his death; but let it be without any limitation, or restraint upon the future use, or disposal. Divert not the consequences of actions, as to the individual actors, from their proper course. Let no preference be given to any one in government, but what his con∣duct can secure, from the sentiments of his fellow ci∣tizens. Of property, left to the disposal of the law, let a descent from parents to children, in equal pro∣portions, be held a sacred principle of the constitution. Secure but these, and every thing will flow in the channel intended by nature. The operation of the e∣qual laws of nature, tend to exclude, or correct every dangerous excess.</P>

<P>Surely nothing can be more unreasonable than to lose the will to please, when we are conscious of the power, or shew more cruelty than to choose any kind of influence before that of kindness and good-humour.

<HEAD>The HANDSOME and DEFORMED LEG.</HEAD>
<P>There are two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orts of people in the world, who with equal degrees of health and wealth, and the other comforts of life, become the one happy, and the other miserable. This arises very much from the different views in which they consider things, persons, and e∣vents; and the effect of those different views upon their own minds.</P>
<P>In whatever situation men can be placed, they may find conveniencies and inconveniencies: in whatever company, they may find persons and conversation more or less pleasing: at whatever table, they may meet with meats and drinks of better and worse taste, dishes better and worse dressed: in whatever climate, they will find good and bad weather: under whatever gov∣ernment, they may find good and bad laws, and good and bad administration of those laws: in whatever po∣em, or work of genius, they may see faults and beau∣ties: in almost every face, and every person, they may discover fine features and defects, good and bad qualities.</P>
<P>Under these circumstances, the two sorts of people above-mentioned, fix their attention—those who are disposed to be happy, on the conveniencies of things, the pleasant parts of conversation, the well dressed dishes, the goodness of the wines, the fine weather, &amp;c. and enjoy all with chearfulness. Those who are to be unhappy, think and speak only of the contraries. Hence they are continually discontented themselves,
<PB N="165" REF="037099_0173_100C4D799A240058"/>
and, by their remarks, four the pleasures of society; offend personally many people, and make themselves every where disagreeable. If this turn of mind was founded in nature, such unhappy persons would be the more to be pitied. But as the disposition to criticise, and to be disgusted, is perhaps taken up originally by imitation, and is, unawares, grown into a habit, which, though at present strong, may nevertheless be cured, when those who have it are convinced of its bad effects on their felicity: I hope this little admonition may be of service to them, and put them on changing a habit, which, though in the exercise it is chiefly an act of imagination, yet has serious consequences in life, as it brings on real griefs and misfortunes. For as many are offended by, and nobody loves this sort of people; no one shews them more than the most common civili∣ty and respect, and scarcely that; and this frequently puts them out of humour, and draws them into dis∣putes and contentions. If they aim at obtaining some advantage in rank or fortune, nobody wishes them suc∣cess, or will stir a step, or speak a word to favour their pretensions. If they incur public censure or disgrace, no one will defend or excuse, and many join to aggra∣vate their misconduct, and render them completely odious: if these people will not change this bad habit, and condescend to be pleased with what is pleasing, without fretting themselves and others about the con∣traries, it is good for others to avoid an acquaintance with them; which is always disagreeable, and some∣times very inconvenient, especially when one finds one's self entangled in their quarrels.</P>
<P>An old philosophical friend of mine was grown from experience, very cautious in this particular, and carefully avoided any intimacy with such people. He had, like other philosophers, a thermometer to shew him the heat of the weather; and a barometer, to mark when it was likely to prove good or bad; but there be∣ing
<PB N="166" REF="037099_0174_100C4D7B1DEA10D8"/>
no instrument invented to discover, at first sight, this unpleasing disposition in a person, he, for that purpose, made use of his legs; one of which was re∣markably handsome, the other, by some accident, crooked and deformed. If a stranger, at the first inter∣view, regarded his ugly leg more than his handsome one, he doubted him. If he spoke of it, and took no notice of the handsome leg, that was sufficient to deter∣mine my philosopher to have no further acquaintance with him. Every body has not this two legged instru∣ment; but every one, with a little attention, may ob∣serve signs of that carping, fault-finding disposition, and take the same resolution of avoiding the acquaintance of those infected with it. I therefore advise those critical, querulous, discontented, unhappy people, that if they wish to be respected and beloved by others, and happy in themselves, they should <HI>leave off looking at the ugly leg.</HI></P>

As pride is sometimes hid under humility, idleness is often covered by turbulence and hurry.

<P>Perhaps every man may date the predominance of those desires that disturb his life, and contaminate his conscience, from some unhappy hour when too much leisure exposed him to their incursions; for he has lived with little observation, either on himself, or others, who does not know that to be idle is to be vicious.</P>

Converse much with those men, and those books, and those parts of learning, where you meet with the greatest clearness of thought, and force of reasoning. The mathematical sciences, and particu∣larly arithmetic, geometry, and mechanics, abound with these advantages: and if there were nothing valu∣able in them for the uses of human life, yet the very speculative parts of this sort of learning are well worth our study; for by perpetual examples they teach us to conceive with clearness, to connect our ideas and pro∣positions in a train of dependence, to reason with strength and demonstration, and to distinguish between truth and falshood. Something of these sciences should be studied by every man who pretends to learn∣ing, and that, as Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> expresses it, "not so much to make us mathematicians, "as to make us reasonable creatures."</P>

</LG>
<BIBL>WALLER.</BIBL>
<P>There is no virtue so truly great and god-like as justice. Most of the other virtues are the virtues of created beings, or accommodated to our nature as we are men. Justice is that which is practised by God himself, and to be practised in its perfection by none but him. Omniscience and Omnipotence are requi∣site for the full exertion of it. The one to discover every degree of uprightness in thoughts, words, and actions. The other, to measure out and impart suita∣ble rewards and punishments.</P>
<P>As, to be perfectly just is an attribute in the divine nature, to be so to the utmost of our abilities is the glory of man. Such a one who has the public administra∣tion in his hands, acts like the representative of his maker, in recompensing the virtuous, and punishing the offender.</P>
<P>When a nation once loses its regard to justice; when they do not look upon it as something venerable, holy, and inviolable; when any of them dare presume to lessen, affront or terrify those who have the distribution of it in their hands; when a judge is capable of being influenced by any thing but law, or a cause may be recommended by any thing that is foreign to its own merits, we may venture to pronounce that such a nation is hastening to its ruin.</P>
<P>I always rejoice when I see a tribunal filled with a man of an upright and inflexible temper, who, in the execution of his country's laws, can overcome all pri∣vate fear, resentment, solicitation, and even pity itself. Whenever passion enters into a sentence or decision, so far will there be in it a tincture of injustice. In short, justice discards party, friendship, kindred, and is there∣fore always represented as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that we may suppose her thoughts are wholly intent on the equity of a cause,

<HEAD>JUDGMENT.</HEAD>
<P>Nothing is more unjust than to judge of a man by too short an acquaintance, and too slight inspection; for it often happens, that in the loose and thoughtless, and dissipated, there is a secret radical worth, which may shoot out by proper cultivation. That the spark of heaven, though dimmed and obstructed, is yet not extinguished, but may, by the breath of counsel and ex∣hortation be kindled into a flame. To imagine that every one who is not completely good, is irrevocably abandoned, is to suppose that all are capable of the same degree of excellence; it is, indeed, to exact from all, that perfection which none ever can attain. And since the purest virtue is consistent with some vice, and the virtue of the greatest number, with almost an equal proportion of contrary qualities, let none too hastily conclude that all goodness is lost, though it may for a time be clouded and overwhelmed; for most minds are the slaves of external circumstances; and conform to any hand that undertakes to mould them, roll down any torrent of custom in which they happen to be caught, or bend to any importunity that bears hard against them.</P>

<HEAD>JEALOUSY OF TYRANNY.</HEAD>
<P>It may be said, that a too great jealousy of liberty is equally dangerous with a too great confidence; that as the latter may plunge us into slavery, the former may into anarchy: I should allow some weight to this objection, if in the whole course of our history, a re∣sutation, in a single instance, could be produced of these positions; that the spirit of liberty is slow to act, even
<PB N="188" REF="037099_0196_100C4DB0846601D0"/>
against the worst princes, and exerts itself in favour of the best with more effect than any other spirit what∣soever. I must therefore repeat that the keeping alive the jealous spirit of liberty is a common cause; that a detestation of tyrants, or even of those who lean to ty∣ranny, is inseparable from this spirit; that Charles the First was a tyrant in principle and in action; that those who labour to reconcile us to his conduct and character, would destroy the spirit of liberty, and ulti∣mately establish the principle of non-resistance; that a junto of mercenaries and court retainers do labour to these purposes; that it is, therefore, the duty of every common citizen, who has the interest of his country at heart, to exert continually whatever force he has to defeat their purposes; or, at least, weaken their influ∣ence; for in mechanics, the smallest force continually applied will overcome the most violent motions com∣municated to bodies.</P>

Kings who have weak understandings, bad hearts, and strong prejudices, and all these, as it often happens, inflamed by their passions, and rendered incurable by their self-conceit and presumption; such kings are apt to imagine, and they conduct themselves so as to make many of their subject; imagine, that the king and the people in free governments are rival powers, who stand in competition with one another, who have different interests, and must of course have different views: that the rights and privileges of the people are so many spoils taken from the rights and prerogative of the crown; and that the rules and laws, made for the ex∣ercise and security of the former, are so many diminu∣tions of their dignity, and restraints on their power. A patriot king will see all this in a far different and much truer light. He will make one and but one dis∣tinction between his rights and those of the people: he will look on his to be a trust, and theirs a property; and that his people who had an original right to the whole by the law of nature, can have the sole indefea∣sible right to any part.—</P>

<P>Kings are naturally lovers of low company.—They are so elevated above all the rest of mankind, that they must look upon all their subjects as on a level. They are rather apt to hate than to love their nobility, on

account of the occasional resistance to their will, which will be made by their virtue, their petulance, or their pride. It must indeed be admitted, that many of the nobility are as perfectly willing to act the part of flat∣terers, tale-bearers, parasites, pimps, and buffoons, as any of the lowest and vilest of mankind can possibly be. But they are not properly qualified for this object of their ambition. The want of a regular education, and early habits, and some lurking remains of their dignity, will never permit them to become a match for an Ita∣lian eunuch, a mountebank, a fidler, a player, or any regular practitioner of that tribe.

<P>If kings were republicans in the proper sense, all the people would be royalists. But when brilliant
<PB N="194" REF="037099_0202_100C4DF415A59C58"/>
honors and ministerial employments are bestowed on fools and knaves, because they were begotten by ances∣tors whom they disgrace, or possess riches which they abuse, government becomes a nuisance, and the people feel an aristocracy to be little better than an automaton machine, for promoting the purposes of royal or minis∣terial despotism.</P>
<BIBL>Spirit of DESPOTISM.</BIBL>
<P>Instead of wondering that so many kings, unfit and unworthy to be trusted with the government of man∣kind, appear in the world, I have been tempted to wonder that there are any tolerable, when I have con∣sidered the flattery that environs them most commonly from the cradle, and the tendency of all those false no∣tions that are instilled into them by precept and by ex∣ample, by the habits of courts, and by the interested selfish views of courtiers. They are bred to esteem themselves of a distinct and superior species among men, as men are among animals.</P>
<P>Louis the Fourteenth was a strong instance of the effect of this education, which trains up kings to be tyrants, without knowing that they are so. That op∣pression under which he kept his people, during the whole course of a long reign, might proceed, in some degree, from the natural haughtiness of his temper; but it proceeded, in a greater degree, from the principles and habits of his education. By this he had been brought to look on his kingdom as a patrimony that descended to him from his ancestors, and that was to be considered in no other light: so that when a very considerable man had discoursed to him at large of the miserable condition to which his people was reduced, and had frequently used this word, <HI>l'etat,</HI> [the state;] though the king approved the stubstance of all he had said, yet he was shocked at the frequent repetition of this word, and complained of it as of a kind of inde∣cency to himself.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="037099_0203_100C4DB975B30648"/>
This capital error, in which almost every prince is confirmed by his education, has so great extent and so general influence, that a right to do every thing iniqui∣tous in government may be derived from it. But, as if this was not enough, the characters of princes are spoil∣ed many more ways by their education.</P>

<P>I am not at all surprised that in monarchies, espe∣cially in our own, there should be so few princes wor∣thy of esteem. Incircled by corrupters, knaves, and hypocrites, they accustom themselves to look upon their fellow creatures with disdain, and to set no value on a∣ny but the sycophants, who caress their vices, and live in perpetual inactivity and idleness. Such is generally the condition of a monarch. Great men are always scarce, and great kings still more so.</P>

<P>Louis XIV. at once the greatest and meanest of mankind, would have excelled all the monarchs in the universe, if he had not been corrupted in his youth by base and ambitious flatterers. A slave during his whole life to pride and vain glory, he never in reality loved his subjects even for a moment; yet expected at the same time, like a true despotic prince, that they should sacrifice themselves to his will and pleasure. Intoxicated with power and grandeur, he imagined the whole world was created solely to promote his happi∣ness. He was seared, obeyed, idolized, hated, morti∣fied, and abandoned. He lived like a sultan, and died like a woman.</P>

The self-interested wretches that surround him rejoice to perceive that he is inaccessible; and a prince that is inaccessible to men is inaccessible to truth. Those who avail themselves of his blindness are busy to ca∣lumniate or to banish all that would open his eyes. He lives in a kind of savage and unsociable magnifi∣cence, always the dupe of that imposition which he at once dreads and deserves. He that converses only with a small number of men, almost necessarily adopts their passions and their prejudices: and from passions and prejudices the best are not free. He must also receive his knowledge by report, and therefore lie at the mercy of tale-bearers, a despicable and detestable race, who are nourished by the poison that destroys others; who make what is little great, and what is blameless crim∣inal, who, rather than not impute evil, invent it; and who to answer their own purposes, play upon the causeless suspicion and unworthy curiosity of a weak and jealous prince.</P>

<P>Experience teaches that the sword, the faggot, exile, and proscriptions, are better calculated to irritate than to heal a disease, which, having its source in the mind, cannot be relieved by remedies that act only on the body.

<P>What the stoics have so vauntingly ascribed to their philosophy, religion has a higher claim to. Torments appear trivial to those who are animated by religious zeal: the firmness with which it inspires them, dead∣ens the sentiment of pain; nothing they are obliged to suffer for its sake, however aggravated, occasions them surprize; the knowledge of their own strength enables them to bear every thing, while they are per∣suaded

<P>If Epicurus, whose system has been so much decried by other philosophers, has said of the sage, that if he were shut up in the brazen bull of Phalaris, he would not fail to declare: "this fire affects me not, it is not I that burn:" do we imagine that less courage was conspicuous in those who by various torments were put to death a century ago, or that less will be displayed by future martyrs, if persecution be contin∣ued? What was said and done by one of them, when he was fastened to the stake in order to be burned, is worthy our notice. Being upon his knees, he began to sing a psalm, which the smoke and the flame could scarcely interrupt; and as the executioner, for fear of terrifying him, lighted the fire behind, he turned and said: "come and kindle it before me: if fire could have terrified me, I should not be here; it depended on my∣self alone to avoid it"</P>

They are the natural enemies of error, and of error only.</P>

<P>Reason and experiment have been indulged, and error has fled before them. It is error alone which needs the support of government. Truth can stand by itself. Subject opinion to coercion: whom will you make your inquisitors? Fallible men; men governed by bad passions, by private as well as public reasons. And why subject it to coercion? To produce unifor∣mity. But is uniformity of opinion desirable? No more than of face and stature. Introduce the bed of Procrustes then, and as there is danger that the large men may beat the small, make us all of a size, by lop∣ping the former and stretching the latter. Difference of opinion is advantageous in religion. The several sects perform the office of a censor morum over each other. Is uniformity attainable? Millions of inno∣cent men, women, and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been burnt, tortured, fined, im∣prisoned; yet we have not advanced one inch towards uniformity. What has been the effect of coercion? To make one half of the world fools, and the other half hypocrites; to support roguery and error all over the earth.</P>

The experiment was new and doubtful when they made it. It has answered beyond conception. They flourish infinitely. Religion is well supported; of va∣rious kinds, indeed, but all good enough; all sufficient to preserve peace and order: or if a sect arises, whose tenets would subvert morals, good sense has fair play, and reasons and laughs it out of doors, without suffering the state to be troubled with it. They do not hang more malefactors than we do. They are not more disturbed with religious dissentions. On the contra∣ry, their harmony is unparalleled, and can be ascribed to nothing but their unbounded tolerance, because there is no other circumstance in which they differ from every nation on earth. They have made the happy discovery, that the way to silence religious disputes, is to take no notice of them. Let us too give this experiment fair play, and get rid, while we may, of those tyrannical laws. It is true, we are as yet secured against them by the spirit of the times. I doubt whether the people of this country would suffer an execution for heresy, or a three years imprisonment for not comprehending the mysteries of the Trinity. But is the spirit of the peo∣ple an infallible, a permanent reliance? Is it govern∣ment? Is this the kind of protection we receive in return for the rights we give up? Besides, the spirit of the times may alter, will alter. Our rulers will be∣come corrupt, our people careless. A single zealot may commence persecutor, and better men be his vic∣tims. It can never be too often repeated, that the time for fixing every essential right on a legal basis is while our rulers are honest, and ourselves united. From the conclusion of this war we shall be going down hill. It will not then be necessary to resort eve∣ry moment to the people for support. They will be forgotten, therefore, and their rights disregarded. They will forget themselves, but in the sole faculty of making money, and will never think of uniting to effect a due respect for their rights. The shackles, therefore, which
<PB N="206" REF="037099_0214_100C4E00736E2728"/>

And it came to pass, after these things, that Abra∣ham sat in the door of his tent, about the going down of the sun. And behold a man bent with age, was coming from the way of the wilderness, leaning on a staff. And Abraham arose, and met him, and said unto him, turn in, I pray thee, and wash thy feet, and tarry all night, and thou shalt arise early in the morn∣ing, and go on thy way. And the man said, nay, for I will abide under this tree. But Abraham pressed him greatly: so he turned, and they went into the tent; and Abraham baked unleaven bread, and they did eat. And when Abraham saw that the man blessed not God, he said unto him, wherefore dost thou not worship the most high God, creator of heaven and earth? And the man answered and said, I do not worship thy God, neither do I call upon his name; for I have made to myself a god, which abideth always in my house, and provideth me with all things. And Abraham's zeal was kindled against the man, and he arose and fell up∣on him, and drove him forth with blows into the wil∣derness. And God called unto Abraham, saying, A∣braham, where is the stranger? And Abraham answer∣ed and said, Lord, he would not worship thee, neither would he call upon thy name; therefore have I driven him out from before my face into the wilderness. And God said, have I borne with him these hundred and ninety and eight years, and nourished him, and clothed him, notwithstanding his rebellion against me: and could'st not thou, who art thyself a sinner, bear with him one night?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The circumstance which gave rise to the above elegant and instructive <HI>morceau,</HI> was, it is said, as follows: Dr. Frank∣lin being once in company where the discourse turned on the folly of intolerance and persecution, he took up a bible, which was at hand, and opening at Genesis, he delivered this parable extempore, in confirmation of what he had advanced.

is not the cold reluctant result of terror; but the livery, cheerful, and spontaneous effect of love.

<P>We shall conclude this subject, with observing the falsehood of the common opinion, that no large state could ever be modelled into a commonwealth, but that such a form of government can only take place in a city or small territory. The contrary seems probable. Though it is more difficult to form a republican gov∣ernment in an extensive country than in a city; there is more facility, when once it is formed, of preserving it steady and uniform, without tumult and faction.—In a large government, which is modeled with master∣ly skill, there is compass and room enough to refine the democracy from the lower people who may be admit∣ted into the first elections or first concoction of the commonwealth, to the higher magistrates, who direct all the movements. At the same time, the parts are so distant and remote, that it is very difficult, either by intrigue, prejudice, or passion, to hurry them into any measures against the public interest.</P>

The princes of Europe have found out a manner of rewarding their subjects, by presenting them with a∣bout two yards of blue ribbon, which is worn about the shoulder. They who are honoured with this mark of distinction are called knights, and the king himself is always the head of the order. Should a nobleman happen to lose his leg in battle, the king presents him with two yards of ribbon, and he is paid for the loss of his limb. Should an ambassador spend all his pater∣nal fortune, in supporting the honor of his country a∣broad, the king presents him with two yards of ribbon, which is to be considered as equivalent to his estate. In short, while an European king has a yard of blue or green ribbon left, he need be under no apprehension of wanting statesmen, generals, and soldiers.</P>

<HEAD>LICENTIOUSNESS.</HEAD>
<P>Those who are possessed of exorbitant power, who pant for its extension, and tremble at the apprehension of losing it, are always sufficiently artful to dwell with emphasis, on the evils of licentiousness; under which opprobrious name, they wish to stigmatize liberty. They describe the horrors of anarchy and confusion, in the blackest colors; and boldly affirm, that they are the necessary consequences of entrusting the people with power. Indeed, they hardly condescend to recog∣nize the idea of the people; but whenever they speak of the mass of the community, denominate them the mob, the rabble or the swinish multitude. Language is at a loss for appellatives, significant of their contempt for those who are undistinguished by wealth or titles, and is obliged to content itself with such words as reptiles, scum, dregs, or the many-headed monster.</P>
<BIBL>Spirit of DESPOTISM.</BIBL>
<P>Licentiousness and despotism are more nearly allied than is commonly imagined. They are both alike in∣consistent with liberty, and the true end of government; nor is there any other difference between them, than that one is the licentiousness of great men, and the other the licentiousness of little men; or that by one, the persons and property of a people are subject to outrage and in∣vasion from a king, or a lawless body of grandees; and that by the other, they are subject to the like outrages from a lawless mob. In avoiding one of these evils, mankind have often run into the other. But all well-constituted governments guard equally against both.
<PB N="217" REF="037099_0225_100C4DD30B5C2460"/>
Indeed of the two, the last is, on several accounts, the least to be dreaded, and has done the least mischief. It may truly be said, if licentiousness has destroyed its thousands, despotism has destroyed its millions. The former having little power, and no system to support it, ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ssarily finds its own remedy; and a people soon get out of the tumult and anarchy attending it. But a despotism, wearing a form of government, and being armed with its force, is an evil not to be con∣quered without dreadful struggles. It goes on from age to age, debasing the human faculties, levelling all distinctions, and preying on the rights and blessings of society. It deserves to be added, that in a state distur∣bed by licentiousuess, there is an animation which is favourable to the human mind, and puts it upon exerting its powers; but in a state habituated to despotism, all is still and torpid. A dark and savage tyranny stifles every effort of genius, and the mind loses all its spirit and dignity.</P>

<HEAD>LIBERTY OF THE PRESS.</HEAD>
<P>The liberty of the press is essential to the security of freedom in a state: it ought therefore to be inviolably preserved.</P>
<BIBL>Constitution of NEW-HAMPSHIRE.</BIBL>
<P>The people have a right to freedom of speech, and of writing and publishing their sentiments, concerning the transactions of government—and therefore the free∣dom of the press ought not to be restrained.</P>

<P>As long as there are such things as printing and writing, there will be libels: it is an evil arising out of a much greater good.—However it does not follow that the press is to be sunk for the errors of the press:—for it is certainly of much less consequence that an innocent man should now and then be aspersed than that all men should be enslaved.</P>
<P>Many methods have been tried to remedy this evil. In Turkey and the Eastern monarchies, all printing is forbid; which does it with a witness; for if there can be no printing at all, there can be no libels printed; and by the same reason there ought to be no talking, lest the people should talk treason, blasphemy, or non∣sense; and for a stronger reason yet, no preaching, be∣cause the orator has an opportunity of haranguing often to a larger auditory than he can persuade to read his lu∣cubrations: but I desire it may be remembered, that there is neither liberty, arts, sciences, learning, or know∣ledge in these countries.</P>
<P>But another method has been thought on in these western parts of the world, much less effectual, and yet more mischievous than the former, namely, to put
<PB N="222" REF="037099_0230_100C4E10CF8269C8"/>
the press under the protection of the prevailing party, and authorise libels on one side only, and deny the other side the opportunity of defending themselves.</P>
<P>What mischief is done by libels to balance all these evils? They seldom or never annoy an innocent man, or promote any considerable error, Wise and honest men laugh at them, and despise them, and such ar∣rows always fly over their heads, or fall at their feet. Most of the world take part with a virtuous man, and punish c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lumny by their detestation of it. The best way to prevent libels is not to deserve them. Guilty men alone fear them, or are hurt by them, whose act∣ions will not bear examination, and therefore must not be examined. 'Tis fact alone which annoys them; for if you tell no truth, I dare say you may have their leave to tell as many lies as you please.</P>
<P>The same is true in speculative opinions. You may write nonsense and folly as long as you think fit, and no one complains of it but the bookseller. But if a bold, honest, and wise book sallies forth, and attacks those who think themselves secure in their trenches, then their camp is in danger, and they call out all hands to arms, and their enemy is to be destroyed by fire, sword, or fraud. But 'its senseless to think that any truth can suffer by being thoroughly searched, or exam∣ined into; or that the discovery of it can prejudice right religion, equal government, or the happiness of society in any respect: she has so many advantages above er∣ror, that she wants only to be shown to gain admiration and esteem; and we see every day that she breaks the bonds of tyranny and fraud, and shines through the mists of superstition and ignorance: and what then would she do, if these barriers were removed, and her fetters taken off?</P>

Nothing is so effectual to this purpose as the liberty of the press, by which all the learning, wit and genius of the nation may be employed on the side of freedom, and every one be animated to its defence. As long therefore as the republican part of our govern∣ment can maintain itself against the monarchical, it will naturally be careful to keep the press open, as of importance to its own preservation.</P>

When I reflect upon man; and take a view of that dark side of him which represents his life as open to so many causes of trouble—when I consider how oft we eat the bread of affliction, and that we are born to it, as to the portion of our inheritance—when one runs over the catalogue of all the cross reckonings and sor∣rowful items with which the heart of man is over∣charged, 'tis wonderful by what hidden resources the mind is enabled to stand it out, and bear itself up as it does, against the impositions laid upon our nature.</P>

<P>Men are gregarious in their nature; they form to∣gether in society, not merely from necessity, to avoid the evils of solitude, but from inclination and mutual attachment. They find a positive pleasure in yielding assistance to each other, in communicating their thoughts and improving their faculties. This disposi∣tion in man is the source of morals; they have their foundation in nature, and receive their nourishment from society. The different portions of this society, that call themselves nations, have generally established the principle of securing to the individuals who com∣pose a nation, the exclusive enjoyment of the fruits of their own labour; reserving however to the governing power the right to reclaim from time to time so much of the property and labour of individuals as shall be deemed necessary for the public service. This is the general basis on which property, public and private, has hitherto been founded. Nations have proceeded no farther. Perhaps in a more improved state of so∣ciety, the time will come, when a different system may be introduced; when it shall be found more con∣genial to the social nature of man to exclude the idea of separate property, and with that the numerous evils which seem to be entailed upon it.</P>

with dangers on all sides, and may become unhappy by numberless casualties, which he could not foresee, nor had prevented had he foreseen them.</P>
<P>It is our comfort, while we are obnoxious to so many accidents, that we are under the care of one who directs contingencies, and has in his hands the manage∣ment of every thing that is capable of annoying or offending us; who knows the assistance we stand in need of, and is always ready to bestow it on those who ask it of him.</P>
<P>The natural homage, which such a creature bears to so infinitely wise and good a being, is a firm reliance on him, for the blessings and conveniencies of life, and an habitual trust in him for deliverance out of all such dangers and difficulties as may befall us.</P>
<P>The man who always lives in this disposition of mind, has not the same dark and melancholy views of human nature, as he who considers himself abstractedly from this relation to the Supreme Being. At the same time that he reflects upon his own weakness and im∣perfection, he comforts himself with the contemplation of those divine attributes, which are employed for his safety and his welfare.

He reaps the benefit of every divine at∣tribute, and loses his own insufficiency in the fulness of infinite perfection.</P>
<P>To make our lives more easy to us, we are com∣manded to put our trust in him, who is thus able to relieve and succour us; the divine goodness having made such a reliance a duty, notwithstanding we should have been miserable had it been forbidden us.</P>

<P>The militia of this country must be considered as the palladium of our security, and the first effectual resort, in case of hostility. It is essential, therefore, that the same system should pervade the whole; that the for∣mation and discipline of the militia of the continent, should be absolutely uniform; and that the same spe∣cies of arms, accoutrements, and military apparatus, should be introduced in every part of the United States. No one, who has not learned it from experience, can conceive the difficulty, expence, and confusion, which result from a contrary system, or the vague arrange∣ments which have hitherto prevailed.</P>

<HEAD>MILITARY POWER.</HEAD>
<P>There is one circumstance in the conduct of the <HI>tory</HI> friends to <HI>absolute sway,</HI> truly alarming to the champions of liberty. They are always inclined, on the smallest tumult, to call in the military. They would depreci∣ate the civil powers, and break the constable's staff to introduce the bayonet. In their opinion, the best ex∣ecutive powers of government are a party of dragoons. They are therefore constantly sounding alarms, and ag∣gravating every petty disturbance into a riot or rebel∣lion. They are not for parleying with the many-head∣ed monster; they scorn lenient measures; and while their own persons are in perfect safety, boldly com∣mand the military to fire. What is the life or the limb of a poor man, in their opinion? Not so much as the life or limb of a favorite pointer or race-horse. They are always eager to augment the army. They would build barracks in every part of the country, and be glad to see a free country over-run, like some of the enslaved nations of the continent, from east to west, from north to south, with men armed to overawe the saucy advocates of charters, privileges, rights, and re∣formations.</P>
<P>Against principles so dangerous in public life, and odious in private, every friend to his country, every lover of his fellow creatures, every competent judge of those manners, which sweeten the intercourse of man with man, will shew a determined opposition.

<P>I told him, that a chief or first minister of state, who was the person I intended to describe, was a creature wholly exempt from joy and grief, love and hatred, pity

and anger; at least makes use of no other passions, but a violent desire of wealth, power, and titles; that he applies his words to all uses, except to the indication of his mind; that he never tells a truth but with an in∣tent that you should take it for a lie: nor a lie, but with a design that you should take it for a truth; that those he speaks worst of behind their backs, are in the surest way of preferment; and whenever he begins to praise you to others, or to yourself, you are from that day forlorn. The worst mark you can receive is a promise, especially when it is confirmed with an oath; after which every wise man retires, and gives over all hopes.</P>
<BIBL>SWIFT.</BIBL>
<P>Ministers and favorites are a sort of people who have a state prisoner in their custody, the whole man∣agement of whose understanding and actions they can easily engross. This they completely effect with a weak and credulous master, nor can the most cautious and penetrating elude their machinations.</P>
<P>Ministers become a sort of miniature kings in their turn. The king has been used to hear those things only which were adapted to give him pleasure, and it is with a grating and uneasy sensation that he listens to communications of a different sort. He has been used to unhesitating compliance; and it is with difficulty he can digest expostulation and opposition. The tem∣porising politician expects the same pliability in others that he exhibits in himself; and the fault which he can least forgive is an ill timed and inauspicious scru∣pulosity.</P>
<P>Expecting this compliance from all the coadjutors and instruments of his designs, he soon comes to set it up as a standard by which to judge of the merits of all other men. He is deaf to every recommendation but that of a fitness for the secret service of government, or a tendency to promote his interest, and extend the sphere of his influence. The worst man with this argument

in his favor will seem worthy of encouragement; the best man who has no advocate but virtue to plead for him will be treated with superciliousness and neglect.—To obtain honor, it will be necessary to pay a servile court to administration, to bear with unaltered patience their contumely and scorn, to flatter their vices, and render ourselves useful to their private gratification. To obtain honors, it will be necessary, by assiduity and intrigue, to make to ourselves a party, to procure the recommendation of lords and the good word of women of pleasure and clerks in office. To obtain honor, it will be necessary to merit disgrace. The whole scene consists in hollowness, duplicity, and falsehood. The minister speaks fair to the man he despises, and the slave pretends a generous attachment, while he thinks of nothing but his personal interest.</P>

<P>If you ask me where to look for those beautiful shi∣ning qualities of prime ministers and the great favorites of princes, that are so finely painted in dedications, addresses, epitaphs, funeral sermons, and inscriptions? I answer, there, and no where else. Where would you look for the excellency of a statue, but in that part which you see of it? It is the polished outside only that has the skill and labour of the sculptor to boast of; what is out of sight is untouched. Would you break the head or cut open the breast to look for the brains or the heart, you would only shew your ignorance and destroy the workmanship. This has often made me compare the virtues of great men to your large china jars; they make a fine show, and are ornamental to a chimney; one would, by the bulk they appear in, and the value that is set upon them, think they might be very useful, but look into a thousand of them, and you will find nothing but dust and cobwebs.</P>

Nor will they ever return, notwith∣standing the efforts of petty despots, (fearing the loss of those distinctions which they know they never earned,) to keep the people in the grossest ignorance.</P>
<P>God Almighty, who gives his sun to shine with as much warmth and radiance on the cottage as on the palace, has dispensed the glorious privilege of genius and virtue to the poor and middle classes, with a bounty perhaps seldom experienced in any of the proud pre∣tenders to hereditary or official grandeur. Let us call to mind a few among the worthies who have adorned the ages that have elapsed: Socrates; was he <HI>noble</HI> in the sense of a king at arms? Would he have conde∣scended to be bedizened with ribands, and stars, and garters? Cicero; was he not a <HI>novus homo?</HI> a man unconnected with patricians, and deriving his glory
<PB N="241" REF="037099_0249_100C4DF166AB79A0"/>

<P>The greatest scholars, poets, orators, philosophers, warriors, statesmen, inventors and improvers of the arts, arose from the lowest of the people. If we had waited till courtiers had invented the art of printing, clock-making, navigation, and a thousand others, we should probably have continued in darkness to this hour. They had something else to do, than to add to the comforts and conveniencies of ordinary life. They had to worship an idol, with the incense of flattery, who was often much more stupid than themselves, and who sometimes had no more care or knowledge of the people under him, or their wants, than he had of arts or literature.</P>
<P>The education of the middle classes is infinitely bet∣ter than the education of those who are called <HI>great people.</HI> Their time is less consumed by that vanity and dissipation which enfeebles the mind, while it precludes opportunity for reading and reflection.

These are their stars, and these their coronets. They are for the most part attached to their religion. They are temperate, frugal, and industrious. In one particular, and that one adds a value above all that <HI>courts</HI> can give, they greatly excel the great, and that particular is sin∣cerity. They are in earnest in their words and deeds.

<P>Nature does nothing in vain; the creator of the universe has appointed every thing to a certain use and purpose, and determined it to a settled course and sphere of action, from which if it in the least deviates, it becomes unfit to answer those ends for which it was designed. In like manner it is in the dispositions of society; the civil economy is formed in a chain as well as the natural; and in either case the breach but of one link puts the whole in some disorder. It is, I think, pretty plain, that most of the absurdity and ridicule that we meet with in the world, is generally owing to the impertinent affectation, of excelling in characters men are not fit for, and for which nature never designed them.</P>
<P>Every man has one or more qualities which may make him useful both to himself and others; nature never fails of pointing them out, and while the infant continues under the guardianship, she brings him on in his way, and then offers herself for a guide in

what remains of the journey; if he proceeds in that course, he can hardly miscarry: nature makes good her engagements; for as she never promises what she is not able to perform, so she never fails of performing what she promises. But the misfortune is, men des∣pise what they may be masters of, and affect what they are not fit for; they reckon themselves already posses∣sed of what their genius inclines them to, and so bend all their ambition to excel in what is out of their reach. Thus they destroy the use of their natural talents, in the same manner as covetous men do their quiet and re∣pose; they can enjoy no satisfaction in what they have, because of the absurd inclination they are possessed with for what they have not.</P>

<P>While good faith reigned upon the earth, a simple promise was sufficient to insure confidence. Oaths owe their origin to perfidy. Man was not required to call upon the God that heard him to witness his veraci∣ty, till he deserved no longer to be believed. Magistrates and sovereigns, to what do your regulations tend? You either oblige the man of probity to lift up his hand, and call heaven to witness, which with him is a requisition as injurious as it is useless; or you compel an oath from the mouth of a reprobate. Of what value can the oath of such a man appear to you? If the oath be contrary to his own security, it is absurd. If it be consonant with his interest, it is superfluous. Does it argue a knowledge of the human heart, to give the debtor his choice between his ruin and a falsehood; or the criminal his option between death and perjury? Will the man whom motives of revenge, interest, or wickedness, have determined to give a false testimony, be deterred by the fear of committing one crime more? Is he not apprised, before he is brought up to the tri∣bunal of justice, that this formality will be required of him? And has he not from the bottom of his heart

despised it, before he complied with it? Is it not a species of impiety to introduce the name of God in our wicked disputes? Is it not a singular mode of making heaven, as it were, an accomplice in the guilt, to suffer that heaven to be called upon, which never has contra∣dicted nor ever will contradict the oath? How intrepid, therefore, must the false witness become, when he has with impunity called down the divine vengeance on his head, without the fear of being convicted?

<P>It is the great privilege of poverty to be happy un∣envied, to be healthful without physic, and secure without a guard; to obtain from the bounty of na∣ture what the great and wealthy are compelled to pro∣cure by the help of artists, and the attendance of flat∣terers and spies.</P>
<BIBL>RAMBLER.</BIBL>
<P>There are natural reasons why poverty does not easily conciliate. He that has been confined from his infancy to the conversation of the lowest classes of man∣kind, must necessarily want those accomplishments which are the usual means of attracting favour; and though truth, fortitude, and probity, give an indisput∣able right to reverence and kindness, they will not be distinguished by common eyes, unless they are bright∣ened by elegance of manners; but are cast aside, like unpolished gems, of which none but the artist knows the intrinsic value, till their asperities are smoothed, and their incrustations rubbed away.</P>

<P>One of the chief advantages derived by the present generation from the improvement and diffusion of philosophy, is deliverance from unnecessary terrors, and exemption from false alarms.

Many men in our times, who wish to extend and aggrandize that power, from whose arbitrary boun∣ty they derive all the honour they are capable of acquir∣ing, endeavour to throw contempt on philosophy. It may indeed be doubted whether they all know the meaning of the word; but they know it implies a me∣rit not derived from princes, and therefore they wish to degrade it. Their fountain of honour, they con∣ceive, has no resemblance, in its nature or efficacy, to the famed fountains of Parnassus: it conveys no in∣spiration, except that which displays itself in the tumor of pride.</P>
<P>The present age has heard upstart noblemen give to philosophers (whose genius and discoveries entitle them to rank, in reason's table of precedency, above every nobleman in the red book) the opprobrious appellation of wretches and miscreants. Philosophy and philoso∣phers have been mentioned by men, whose attainments would only qualify them for distinction in a ball-room, with expressions of hatred and contempt due only to thieves, murderers, the very outcasts and refuse of human nature.</P>
<BIBL>Spirit of DESPOTISM.</BIBL>
<P>Philosophy, so far from deserving contempt, is the glory of human nature. Man approaches by contempla∣tion to what we conceive of celestial purity and excel∣lence. Without the aid of philosophy, the mass of mankind, all over the terraqueous globe, would have sunk in slavery and superstition, the natural consequen∣ces of gross ignorance. Men at the very bottom of society, have been enabled by the natural talents they possessed, seconded by favorable opportunities, to reach the highest improvements in philosophy; and have thus lifted up a torch in the valley, which has exposed the weakness and deformity of the castle on the mountain, from which the oppressors sallied, in the night of dark∣ness, and spread desolation with impunity. Despots, the meanest, the basest, the most brutal and ignorant of
<PB N="257" REF="037099_0265_100C4E694BD3D8E8"/>
the human race, would have trampled on the rights and the happiness of men unresisted, if philosophy had not opened the eyes of the sufferers, shewn them their own power and dignity, and taught them to despise those giants of power, as they appeared through the mists of ignorance, who ruled a vassal world with a mace of iron. Liberty is the daughter of philosophy; and they who detest the offspring, do all that they can to vilify and discountenance the mother.</P>
<P>But let us calamly consider what is the object of this philosophy, so formidable in the eyes of those who are bigotted to ancient abuses, who hate every improve∣ment, and who wish to subject the many to the control of an arbitrary few. Philosophy is ever employed in finding out whatever is good, and whatever true. She darts her eagle eye over all the busy world, detects error and mischief, and points out modes of improvement. In the multiform state of human affairs, ever obnox∣ious to decay and abuse, it is her's to meditate on the means of melioration. She wishes to demolish nothing but what is a nuisance. To build, to repair, to strengthen, and to polish, these are the works which she delights to plan; and, in concerting the best methods of directing their accomplishment, she consumes the midnight oil. How can she disturb human affairs, since she dwells in contemplation, and descends not to action? neither does she impel others to action by the arts of delusive eloquence. She applies to reason alone; and if reason is not convinced, all that she has done, is swept away, like the web of Arachne.</P>

Pride, according to the doctrine of some, is the uni∣versal passion. There are others, who consider it as the foible of great minds; and others again, who will have it to be the very foundation of greatness; but to real greatness, which is the union of a good heart with a good head, it is almost diametrically opposite; as it generally proceeds from the depravity of both, and al∣most certainly from the badness of the latter. Indeed a little observation will show us, that fools are the most addicted to this vice, and a little reflexion will teach us that it is incompatible with true understanding.

<HEAD>POLITICAL DISCUSSION.</HEAD>
<P>What employment, in the busy scene in which man engages from the cradle to the tomb, is more worthy of him than political discussion? It affords a field for intellectual energy, and all the finest feelings of bene∣volence. It exercises and strengthens every faculty. It calls forth latent virtues, which else had slept in the bosom, like the diamond in the mine. And is this employment, thus useful and honorable, to be confined to a few among the race of mortals? Is there to be a monopoly of political action and speculation? Why then did heaven bestow reason and speech, powers of activity, and a spirit of enterprize, in as great perfection on the lowest among the people, as on those who, by no merit of their own, inherit wealth and high station? Heaven has declared its will by its acts. Man con∣travenes it; but time, and the progressive improvement of the understanding, will reduce the anomaly to its natural rectitude. And if a few irregularities should sometimes arise in the process, they are of no impor∣tance when weighed with the happy result; the return of distorted systems to truth, to reason, and the will of God. Occasional ferments, with all their inconve∣niences, are infinitely preferable to the putrescence of stagnation. They are symptoms of health and vigor; and though they may be attended with transient pain, yet while they continue to appear at intervals, there is no danger of mortification. Good hearts, accompa∣nied with good understandings, seldom produce, even where mistaken, lasting evil. They repair and com∣pensate.</P>

In a state of nature it is an invariable law, that a man's acquisitions are in proportion to his la∣bours. In a state of artificial society, it is a law as constant and as invariable, that those who labour most,
<PB N="277" REF="037099_0285_100C4E7F4CE64AB8"/>
enjoy the fewest things; and that those who labour not at all, have the greatest number of enjoyments. A constitution of things this strange and ridiculous be∣yond expression. We scarce believe a thing when we are told it, which we actually see before our eyes every day without being the least surprised. I suppose that there are in Great-Britain upwards of an hundred thousand people employed in lead, tin, iron, copper, and coal mines; these unhappy wretches scarce ever see the light of the sun; they are buried in the bow∣els of the earth; there they work at a severe and dis∣mal task, without the least prospect of being delivered from it; they subsist upon the coarsest and worst sort of fare; they have their health miserably impaired, and their lives cut short, by being perpetually confined in the close vapour of these malignant minerals. An hundred thousand more at least are tortured without re∣mission by the suffocating smoke, intense fires, and constant drudgery necessary in refining and managing the products of those mines. If any man informed us that two hundred thousand innocent persons were con∣demned to so intolerable slavery, how should we pity the unhappy sufferers, and how great would be our just indignation against those who inflicted so cruel and ignominious a punishment? This is an instance, I could not wish a stronger, of the numberless things which we pass by in their common dress, yet which shock us when they are nakedly represented. But this number, considerable as it is, and the slavery with all its baseness and horror, which we have at home, is nothing to what the rest of the world affords of the same nature. Millions daily bathed in the poisonous damps and destructive effluvia of lead, silver, copper, and ar∣senic. To say nothing of those other employments, those stations of wretchedness and contempt in which civil society has placed the numerous <HI>ensans perdus</HI> of her army. Would any rational man submit to one of the most tolerable of these drudgeries, for all the artifi∣cial
<PB N="278" REF="037099_0286_100C4E4B8E5981F8"/>
enjoyments which policy has made to result from them? By no means. And yet need I suggest, that those who find the means, and those who arrive at the end, are not at all the same persons. On considering the strange and unaccountable fancies and contrivances of artificial reason, I have somewhere called this earth the Bedlam of our system. Looking now upon the ef∣fects of some of those fancies, may we not with equal reason call it likewise the Newgate and the Bridewell of the universe? Indeed the blindness of one part of mankind co-operating with the frenzy and villainy of the other, has been the real builder of this respectable fabric of political society. And as the blindness of mankind has caused their slavery, in return, their state of slavery is made a pretence for continuing them in a state of blindness; for the politician will tell you grave∣ly that their life of servitude disqualifies the greater part of the race of man for a search of truth, and sup∣plies them with no other than mean and insufficient ideas. This is but too true; and this is one of the reasons for which I blame such institutions</P>
<P>In a misery of this sort, admitting some few lenitives, and those too but a few, nine parts in ten of the whole race of mankind drudge through life.</P>

<P>In the most refined states of Europe the inequality of property has risen to an alarming height. Vast numbers of their inhabitants are deprived of almost e∣very accommodation that can render life tolerable or secure. Their utmost industry scarcely suffices for their support. The women and children lean with an insupportable weight upon the efforts of the man, so that a large family has in the lower order of life be∣come a proverbial expression for an uncommon degree of poverty and wretchedness. If sickness, or some of those casualties which are perpetually incident to an ac∣tive and laborious life, be super-added to these burdens, the distress is still greater.</P>

It seems to be agreed that in England there is less wretchedness and distress than in most of the kingdoms of the continent. In England the poor's rates amount to the sum of two millions sterling per annum. It has been calculated, that one person in seven of the inhabi∣tants of the country derives at some period of his life assistance from this fund. If to this we add the per∣sons, who, from pride, a spirit of independence, or the want of a legal settlement, though in equal distress, re∣ceive no such assistance, the proportion will be conside∣rably increased.</P>
<P>I lay no stress upon the accuracy of this calculation; the general fact is sufficient to give us an idea of the greatness of the evil.</P>

Every avenue to the throne is shut up. He oppresses, and ruins the people, whilst he

Then is the natural violence of despotism inflamed, and aggravated by hatred and re∣venge. To deserve well of the state is a crime against the prince. To be popular, and to be a traitor, are considered as synonymous terms. Even virtue is dan∣gerous, as an aspiring quality, that claims an esteem by itself, and independent of the countenance of the court. What has been said of the chief, is true of the inferior officers of this species of government; each in his pro∣vince exercising the same tyranny, and grinding the people by an oppression, the more severely felt, as it is near them, and exercised by base and subordinate per∣sons. For the gross of the people, they are considered as a mere herd of cattle; and really in a little time be∣come no better; all principle of honest pride, all sense of the dignity of their nature is lost in their slavery.

War never fails to exhaust the state, and endanger its destruction, with whatever success it is carried on. Though it may be commenced with advantage, it can never be finished without danger of the most fatal re∣verse of fortune. With whatever superiority of strength an engagement is begun, the least mistake, the slightest accident, may turn the scale and give victory to the e∣nemy. Nor can a nation that should be always vic∣torious prosper: it would destroy itself by destroying others: the country would be depopulated, the soil untilled, and trade interrupted: and what is worse, the best laws would lose their force, and a cor∣ruption of manners insensibly take place. Literature will be neglected among the youth; the troops, con∣scious of their own importance, will indulge them∣selves in the most pernicious licentiousness with impu∣nity, and the disorder will necessarily spread through all the branches of government.</P>
<BIBL>FENELON.</BIBL>
<P>It is unquestionably a very notable art to ravage countries, destroy dwellings, and one year with ano∣ther, out of a hundred thousand men to cut off forty thousand. This invention was originally cultivated by nations assembled for their common good. It is other∣wise in our time.</P>
<P>An odd circumstance in this infernal enterprize is, that every chief of these ruffians has his colo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs conse∣crated, and solemnly prays to God before he goes to destroy his neighbour. If the slain in a battle do not exceed two or three thousand, the fortunate comman∣der does not think it worth thanking God for; but if, besides killing ten or twelve thousand men, he has been so far favoured by heaven as totally to destroy some re∣markable place, then a verbose hymn is sung in four parts, composed in a language unknown to all the com∣batants.</P>

It is wonderful with what coolness and indifference the greater part of mankind see war commenced. Those that hear of it at a distance, or read of it in books, but have never presented its evils to their minds, consider it as little more than a splendid game, a proclamation, an army, a battle, and a triumph. Some indeed must perish in the most successful field, but they die upon the bed of honor, <HI>resign their lives amidst the joys of conquest,</HI> and, <HI>filled with England's glory, smile in death.</HI></P>
<P>The life of a modern soldier is ill represented by he∣roic fiction. War has means of destruction more formidable than the cannon and the sword. Of the thousands and ten thousands that perished in our late contests with France and Spain, a very small part ever felt the stroke of an enemy; the rest languished in tents and ships, amidst damps and putrefaction; pale, tor∣pid, spiritless, and helpless; gasping and groaning, unpitied among men, made obdurate by long continu∣ance of hopeless misery; and were at last whelmed in pits, or heaved into the ocean, without notice and without remembrance. By incommodious encamp∣ments and unwholesome stations, where courage is useless, and enterprize impracticable, fleets are silently dispeopled, and armies sluggishly melted away.</P>
<P>Thus is a people gradually exhausted, for the most part with little effect. The wars of civilized nations make very slow changes in the system of empire. The public perceive scarcely any alteration but an in∣crease of debt; and the few individuals who are bene∣fited, are not supposed to have the clearest right, to their advantages. If he that shared the danger enjoy∣ed the profit, and after bleeding in the battle grew rich by the victory, he might shew his gains without envy. But at the conclusion of a ten years war, how are we recompen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed for the death of multitudes and the ex∣pence of millions, but by contemplating the sudden glories of paymasters and agents, contractors and

commissaries, whose equipages shine like meteors, and whose palaces rise like exhalations.</P>
<P>These are the men who, without virtue, labour, or hazard, are growing rich as their country is impove∣rished; they rejoice when obstinacy or ambition adds another year to slaughter and devastation; and laugh from their desks at bravery and science, while they are adding figure to figure, and cypher to cypher, hoping for a new contract from a new armament, and com∣puting the profits of a siege or tempest.</P>

<HEAD>THE WHISTLE.</HEAD>
<P>When I was a child, at seven years old, my friends on a holiday, filled my pocket with coppers. I went directly to a shop where they sold toys for children; and being charmed with the sound of a <HI>whistle,</HI> that I met by the way in the hands of another boy, I volun∣tarily offered him all my money for one. I then came home, and went whistling all over the house, much pleased with my <HI>whistle,</HI> but disturbing all the family.
<PB N="301" REF="037099_0309_100C4EA1856C4288"/>
My brothers, and sisters, and cousins, understanding the bargain I had made, told me I had given four times as much for it as it was worth.

<P>This however was afterwards of use to me, the im∣pression continuing in my mind; so that often, when I was tempted to buy some unnecessary thing, I said to myself, <HI>Don't give too much for the whistle;</HI> and so I saved my money.</P>
<P>As I grew up, came into the world, and observed the actions of men, I thought I met with many, very ma∣ny, who <HI>gave too much for the whistle.</HI></P>
<P>When I saw any one too ambitious of court favors, sacrificing his time in attendance on levees, his repose, his liberty, his virtue, and perhaps his friends to attain it, I have said to myself, <HI>This man gives too much for his whistle.</HI></P>
<P>When I saw another fond of popularity, constantly employing himself in political bustles, neglecting his own affairs, and ruining them by that neglect; <HI>He pays, indeed,</HI> says I, <HI>too much for his whistle.</HI></P>
<P>If I knew a miser, who gave up every kind of com∣fortable living, all the pleasure of doing good to others, all the esteem of his fellow-citizens, and the joys of be∣nevolent friendship, for the sake of accumulating wealth: <HI>Poor man,</HI> says I, <HI>you do indeed pay too much for your whistle.</HI></P>
<P>When I meet a man of pleasure, sacrificing every laudable improvement of the mind, or of his fortune, to mere corporeal sensations; <HI>Mistaken man,</HI> says I, <HI>you are providing pain for yourself, instead of pleasure; you give too much for your whistle.</HI></P>
<P>If I see one fond of fine clothes, fine furniture, fine equipages, all above his fortune, for which he contracts
<PB N="302" REF="037099_0310_100C4E94257589E0"/>

<P>Whoever takes this maxim abroad with him into the grand market of the world, and constantly applies it to honours, to riches, to pleasures, and to every other commodity which that market affords, is a wise man, and must be so acknowledged in the worldly sense of the word; for he makes the best of bargains; since in reality he purchases every thing at the price only of a little trouble, and carries home all the good things I have mentioned, while he keeps his health, his inno∣cence, and his reputation, the common prices which are paid for them by others, entire to himself.</P>
