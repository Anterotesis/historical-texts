<P>THE Author in yielding cordial and prompt compliance with the earnest requisition contained in the annexed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d∣dress, trusts that an enlightened, candid and liberal Public, will asscribe it to pure and honorable motives.</P>
<P>If the Oration shall have any claim to your protection o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> regard, it must flow from that Spirit of Liberty which it breaths; and that the Immortal Washington the Champion of fair freedom is its favorite Theme: which must forever be near and grateful to AMERICAN CITIZENS.</P>

<Q>"<HI>What Man is he that liveth, and shall not see Death?</HI>"</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MOMENTOUS question! yet awfully solved every returning day, by the exit of the mighty and mean, the noble and base, the renowned and inglorious.—</P>
<P>Could moral excellence and manly worth; could illustrious deeds and un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ainted honour; could the purest patriotism conjoined with ra∣tional piety; could the love and veneration, the gratitude &amp; admi∣ration of MILLIONS rescue from the stroke of death, your Wash∣ington had never died—And yet he is gone—the political saviour of your Country—the pride of your nation—the favorite of Hea∣ven—your Washington is gone to happier Climes—It must be so—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eaven's will be done.</P>
<P>Why should we pause here for a fleeting instant, to announce what is the awful dispensation of the most High, that directed my attention to this solemn theme? The deep-rooted sorrow, the woe-worn hearts and grief-wrung spirits, of many dig∣nified characters present; and the grave sympathising countenance of this crowded august Assembly, anticipate me on the oc∣casion.—The heart interesting solemnity of this day has a double retrospect—In its vast importance, it takes cognizance of the BIRTH and DEATH of the greatest George.—It proclaims to the universe, a Republican Government issuing a requisition, with which the heads and hearts of ten thousand times ten thousand, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>him<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e in sweet unison, without one jarring, or one discordant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ote, equally honourable, to the governor and governed, to the first Ma∣gistrate and the People—kindling in our breasts, the mingled emo∣tions of triumph and condolence. All hall Columbia! I would fe∣licitate myself indeed, could I participate individually in that high honour which America may justly claim to herself, of being the kind Foster-Mother OF THAT MAN whose love of glory was

devoid of Ambition—whose generous Soul embraced no object but the emancipation of his country—whose fidelity was equal to your unbounded confidence. "Whose prudence and valour, were a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> once the shield and sword of his native soil." These are glorious outlines, that will forever illumine the page of your history, that can never be erased from your dear remembrance, and will be in∣delibly engraven on the minds of your posterity. But alas! the mournful solemnity of this day reverses the lovely sce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and dar∣kens the gilded prospect.—Mourn America! Your greatest, bravest, best beloved Son is now no more—Mourn ye sons of freedom GREAT WASHINGTON is gone, and you are bereaved indeed—yes, we are well aware, that undisguised are your compunctions of sorrow, unfeigned the sensibilities of your nature—yes, ever since the un∣welcome doleful tidings winged their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>light to this Village and its Vicinity, the deepened sigh was heaved, and the heart throbbed in silent anguish.</P>
<P>Humanity is deeply interested in the heart confounding query of my text—every man living perceives &amp; feels that he must depart <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his life, and ere long dea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> will p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h him off the stage of time. "For life is soon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut off, and we fly away." That we must shortly yield up our breath and be lodged in the gloomy caverns of the grave is most assuredly an awful thought, and were it unceasingly to dwell upon the mind with that powerful energy with which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> some times comes home to the heart, our state would be pitiable indeed. The beneficent Father of all however has framed the human heart with such happy sensibility, such spirit and animation, as are abso∣lutely necessary for agenting the grand business of life and time with vigour and activity. Yet surely the fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of others, should im∣press mortal man, with grave f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ling and devout reflection—"Man is as the grass indeed" He springs up, blooms, fades, and perishes from the earth as if he had never been. Yet the swelling vanity of mortal man will lift itself into importance—Hark child of the dust! The ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and airy scene begins to change apa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e—Mark the hoary head and wrinkled face, sad ravages of time! with what certainty can man promise himself to-morrow? when we take a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>trospective glance at those who were the endearing companions of out boyish days, the heart sickens at the doleful recollection.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="037521_0005_100D479C71715558"/>
As travellers on the way to our eternal home, shall we pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ter this world and forget our destination▪ Shall we trifle with all-Important time, and lavish the precious hours away? We sojourn in a vale of tears, where all things have changed, are changing, and may change again. The dreary tomb is the last abode of erring man, even there is laid low your Washington the magnanimous.</P>
<P>Woeful event <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Here are we convened to commemorate a nati∣on's loss, a loss I had almost said irreparable. The painful yet pleasing task, assigned me in the important transactions of this day, is to be the organ, for expressing the part we bear in the univer∣sal mourning. I feel confident from the sensations of my own heart, that there is not a bosom in this great assembly so callous, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s not to melt, and mourn and sadden, at Columbia's woe.</P>
<P>Various causes combine to announce my inequality to the duties of the day. Little schooled in political researches, a stranger to the din of arm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and clangor of war; equally unknowing and un∣known, in acts of chivalry or the thunder of battle, in the tactics of sap or storm; a foreigner, yea a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Alien on your shore, of a few "little months," standing. The ground on which I tread i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> truly declicate and embarrassing. We are well aware that servile adulation, and unmerited encomium, are only adapted to the taste and genius of mean temporizing sycophants; yet surely, when an undeviating virtuous character holds an exalted station, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> inde∣fatigable in promoting the public good, even national felicity, to withhold praise from such honourable men, is ungenerous, ungrate∣ful, criminal▪ for the plaudits of the wise and good in every age, have proved incentives to the noblest deeds. Fulsome adulation we detest, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d unmerited compliment either to DEAD or LIVING, would be satire in disguise. In our feeble attempts to delineate the character of your immortal Washington, (whose death we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣plore this day) there is little danger of transcending his real worth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and it would betray the weak head o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bad heart, to keep within common bounds, when we either think, write, or speak, of such an UNCOMMON MAN. When Washington is the theme of our honest eulogium; the subject is almost too vast for regular thought▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> reviewing the assemblage of his endearing virtues, we feel ex∣tremely difficulted which we shall most admire, the mild and ami∣able
<PB N="8" REF="037521_0006_100D479FA4B95630"/>
virtues of the man in the tranquil walks of life; the philans <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hropy of the citizen, the love of country in the patriot, the va∣lour of the hero, the wisdom of the general, the policy of the statesman, or the piety of the christian. In tracing this extensive range of character, I trust the earnestness of my zeal and purity of my intention, will, in your indulgent estimation supply the lack of talent.</P>
<P>Let the mighty nations across the Atlantic, boast of their Sci∣pio's, their Caesar's and Alexanders—their Gustavus Adolphus and their Ferdinand—their Marlborough and their Buonaparte; yet you will be constrained to resolve their blazoned atchievements, into mad ambition, false love of glory, or tyrannic conquest. Con∣trast them with your beloved Washington as Patriot▪ Heroes, and as the stars of Night fade away before the glory of the rising day, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o shall they hide their diminished lustre and sink into obscurity.</P>
<P>The bravest Potentate of Europe immortalized himself in yield∣ing to this fact; we mean the late Frederic of Prussia, who, after the acknowledgment of your Independence, transmitted a golden-hilted Sword to your Hero, with this signal inscription, "from the oldest to the greatest General."</P>
<P>It is true, transatlantic countries have given birth to individual rare characters, who may vie with your late Chief, in some one of the sublime excellencies that adorn humanity; and it seems to be characteristic of our nature, that to excell in any one grand pur∣suit, will command the whole attention and absorb the noblest powers of man; yet, it would appear as if propitious Heaven in∣tended, that your Washington should stand unrivalled in all.—Select all the characters of Ancient and Modern History, where the man to be found, exhibiting such depth of penetration, such versatility of talent, such active, energetic, bold, comprehensive powers of mind; bearing down all obstacles that opposed their pro∣gress; piercing through the various combinations and relations of surrounding circumstances; seeing all things with an equal eye, in their just dimensions; and attributing to each its due propor∣tion?</P>
<P>What shall we think of that rich fountain, which, while i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was poured out through so many different channels, flowed through
<PB N="9" REF="037521_0007_100D47A259905790"/>
each, with a full and equal stream—On all sides he touched the extremes at human character; and his great Soul was only bound∣ed by that impenetrable circle, which prescribes the limits of human nature.</P>
<P>From so rich an aggregate of materials, we must content our∣selves, with sketching only a few outlines, of the lovely portrait of your dignified citizen. When we behold a character from the retired walks of humble life "starting early in the career of true glory," by an undeviating progress through a life of honor, arrive∣ing at the first dignities of the state—organizing a great nation, and raising America to her proper altitude in the scale of the Uni∣verse, manly curiosity is rouzed into energy, and pure philosophy delights to trace the path of fair <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame, from the vale of obscurity, to the zenith of elevation. There is scarce any circumstance so trivial or minute in great characters, as not to command the at∣tention, and interest the heart. The laudable curiosity of genera∣tions yet unborn will be strongly excited, to learn even what were the air and mein, the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and feature of your lamented Washington. From connoisseurs in what constitutes the elegance of human frame, I have learned that it would have puzzled the most minute observer, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o have discovered one single deficiency in his whole form▪ or thought of one beauty that could enrich it—celestial virtue was cloathed in the form of Washington.</P>
<P>Those divine characters imprinted on his luminous Heaven-directed countenance, would have whispered, where his hope en∣tered, where his confidence was stayed.—There was an uncom∣mon inexpressible SOMETHING about the man, that would have announced to every spectator, this is the American Chief, this the Conqueror of Heroes. Behold him, so soon as he had count∣ed the days of manhood, delegated by the Burgesses of this State—traversing the trackless desart, (part of it savage country) for four hundred miles, even to the banks of the Ohio, where foreign marauders infested your Territory—Follow him through his early deeds of valor, and military manoeavres, at the defeat of Brad∣dock, that overbearing, incautio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, ill-fated man—THERE bud∣ded his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>awre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, which ere long ripened into full maturity—HERE dawned the day, that ushered in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> glory.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="037521_0008_100D47A49A72FB18"/>
In the progress of human events, the period wheeled around, when the British Parliament, intoxicated with prosperity, and in the delirium of policy, pretended a right to legislate for this great continent—outraging every principle of rational liberty and equal representation. Heaven justified your resistance even to blood. My feelings recoil at the contemplation of those black days; and were it not to unrake the dying embers of national jealousy, we could here narrate a gloomy memorial.</P>
<P>Merciful Heaven, what a sight! Your country, your dear coun∣try become the abode of carnage and desolation! a formidable host of foes overspread your plains, possess, your cities—prepared are the internal engines of destruction for your ruin—The sword is drawn—Vengeance and rage have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ighted up their torches—The enemy thirst for conquest, and for plunder—You opposed with courageous resistance—Vain were your efforts in a thousand in∣stances—Blood flows—Death flies—The flame rages—Righteous God! shall millions fall the victims of a few ambitious mortals? Children be murdered at their mother's breast—The gray hairs of the venerable old-man be dragged in blood and dust—Innocent beauty become the prey of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oul ravisher, or brutal murderer? merely because the covetousness of a monster, thirsts for increased revenue, or a tyrant pants for increased territory.—But we for∣bear, and trust you have done forever with those dismal scenes.—Here your Hero rises to view, rises to the admiration of the world, in accumulation of interesting circumstances, delineation of charac∣ter, and important scenery of action.</P>
<P>He could no longer witness, without feeling greatly indignant, the sparkling sword of despotism, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the odious chains of slavery. At the call of his country, worthy to command, willing to obey, he "girded on the harness without boasting,"—conscious of his intrepidity, yet di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ident of his talents. The elegant apostrophe of Col. Hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>phreys (that fine Poet, and finished Scholar) to Gene∣ral Washington on taking command of the army, sublimely ex∣presseth my conceptions on the occasion.</P>
<LG>
<L>" O first of Heroes, fav'rite of the skies,</L>
<L>To what dread <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thy country bade thee <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e!</L>

<L><PB N="11" REF="037521_0009_100D47A6D2F88588"/>
For public cares—to guide th' embattl'd strife—</L>
<L>Unnumber'd ills of every kind to dare—</L>
<L>The winters blast, the summers sultry air,</L>
<L>The lurking dagger—and the turbid storms,</L>
<L>Of wasting War, with death in all his forms—</L>
<L>Nor aught could daunt unspeakably serene,</L>
<L>Thy conscious soul smil'd o'er the dreadful scene. "</L>
</LG>
<P>Then lay at s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake his earthly all—His <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee simple estate in his native <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oil—his precious life—his honour superior to both—his country dearer than all.</P>
<P>Though possessed of undoubted talents for military exploits, and unequalled sagacity to avail himself of every possible advantage; yet, he was nobly superior to that avarice of dominion, which blindly aims at extensive possession. The war he waged, was a war of resistance against tyrannic invasion—a war for security, not for increased territory.</P>
<P>He was not insensible to the charms of ambition—No, but his ambition was not to grasp at aggrandizement by en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ous accumu∣lation of wealth, his ambition was to serve his country gratis.</P>
<P>In his military career you may always note him bold, hazard∣ous, and enterprizing, when and where, there was national hope of success—prudentially cautious, where circumstances appeared desperate—lavish of any thing, rather than the blood of his brave and beloved Countrymen—like the renowned Fabius he conquered by delay.</P>
<P>Follow him to Cambridge—Hear him address the army—Who are they? A band of undisciplined husbandmen—many without arm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ all at different times nearly destitute of ammunition—great in nothing▪ but their unconquerable love of Liberty, their merito∣rious cause, and firm confidence in Heaven. To whom are they opposed? To the first Admirals—the first Generals—the bravest troops of Europe▪ Established in your cities, garrisoned in your strong holds: Mark the issue, environed▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in by your He∣ro; cut off are their resources▪ constrained to abandon the enter∣prize, and fly for refuge to the watery element. Yet sure, the upstart Politician, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire-side General, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> half concealed Tory dared to cavil.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="037521_0010_100D47A8F556E070"/>
Hard is the task indeed, to discharge with decided approbation the complex duties of Commander in Chief in troublous times▪ to carry on with vigour an extensive war, and yet be frugal of the public money; to organize <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> vast armament—"to constrain those to serve, whom it may be delicate to offend;" to maintain due subordination of rank, to conduct at the same time a compli∣cated variety of operations, from the burning sands of Georgia, even to the Fort of Quebec; and to accomplish every valuable purpose, in spite of envy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ction, and disaffection; to effect all this, O Americans! was reserved for your Washington.</P>
<P>The Heroism of your General was not the off<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pring of low-minded pride, established by habit, and confirmed by discipline—No, his sprung from an happy commixture of blood and spirit; a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oul elevated and noble; an understanding strong and refined; a self-denial and self-command that raised him greatly superior <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> misfortune. These burnished by education, warmed with the love of country, and rouzed into energy by a sense of duty, con∣stituted the bravery of your chief Commander.</P>
<P>Haste with him to New-York, see him straining every nerve, exerting every power, to establish that Independence, which your Congress had proclaimed on the memorable Fourth of July 1776; applauded by the citizen, rejoiced at by the soldier—THAT WAS THE DAY when the equestrian Statue of the British George was levelled with the dust.</P>
<P>Here vain alas! were the efforts of your illustrious Chief—He had no adequate force, either to oppose or resist the invading foe; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> even his attempts to oppose the inglorious flight of some of his troops, on the first approach of the enemy—He drew his sword, threatened instant death, cocked, snapped his pistol—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the extreme was then the situation of your brave Com∣mander—to extricate him from it, his faith ful attendants snatch∣ed the bridle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ein and gave his horse an opposite direction.</P>
<P>But as men feeling for the infirmities and pitying the misfor∣tunes of our fellow-men it would become us, to "drop a tear on this paragraph and blot it out forever."</P>
<P>No alternative now remained for your beloved Washington but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ither to evacuate the city, or by an unequal contest, to hazard
<PB N="13" REF="037521_0011_100D47AC20300550"/>
your Independence and political salvation for ages to come. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, dark was his path; the prospect on all hands gloomy and tremendous—with a remnant of his army he retreats to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>wark. At no other period did he ever conceive the American cause as verging on desperation. Said <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to Col. Reid, "If we retreat to the back settlements of Pennsylvania will the inhabitants sup∣port us?" Doubts and fears re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed on the Colonel's mind. On which your General waving his hand across his throat observed, "My neck does not feel as though it was made for a halter, we must retreat to Augusta County in Virginia, and if overpowered by numbers we will cross the Allegheny.</P>
<P>At that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing heart-agonizing moment; few men would have exchanged, feelings, situation, and circumstances with your Hero, for the empire of the world.</P>
<P>Follow him next to Brandy wine, it was there that the celebrated La Fayette first bled in the cause of Liberty, which he had es∣poused with enthusiastic ardour, and still renders him dear to Ame∣ricans.

<P>Thus the rise and fall of the mightiest empires may depend on the minutest incidents. "Lives there a man, who dare con∣sider these as blind un meaning casualties?"

<P>During this year and for some time after, the views of a few factious men, were strongly bent, on rendering the Commander

in Chief unpopular: Ungenerous, ungrateful men; who would meanly envy, and basely traduce, conscious, they could not nobly emulate. He was well aware of their sinister plot; and his con∣duct on the trying occasion, displays the purest patriotism, truest magnanimity, and unsullied honour.</P>
<P>Hear his own words, in a confidential letter to his friend: "I am said a scheme of that kind is now on foot by some (namely the change of Commander in Chief,) whether true or false, ferrous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to try the pulse▪ I neither know nor care.

Such was the avowal of Washington the GREAT, worthy of himself.</P>
<P>Now the cloud that obscured your political horizon, began to be wafted far away—The mist that enveloped your military glory, began to be dissipated—a new era dawned—a treaty with the French, that magnanimous nation was formed, negotiated by the illustrious Franklin and his worthy colleague, faithful servants of the people.

The siege of New York was then planned, by wise heads and dauntless souls.</P>
<P>But the tardy returns of your reinforcements, the destination of Count De Grasse's fleet for the Chesapeake, the arrival at New-York of three thousand additional troops from Europe, and Lord Cornwallis having p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sted himself at Yorktown, as Head Quarters, depot, and general rendezvous for the approaching winter—all, all conspired to change the mighty scene of action.</P>

Thither, Heaven-directed, your Washington bent his way, and there atchieved the mighty deed, that gilds his well earned same—Lo! here a glorious combination—an allied army indeed! not for the inglorious purpose of annihilating, but for the noble end of esta∣blishing revolution<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Delightful harmony▪ differing in nought but the manly contest, of who shall excel in hardiest deeds and boldest enterprize. We should pause here to be wail, nay to execrate, the Policy of that inauspicious day that ever made you twain.</P>
<P>Feats of valor and martial prowess distinguished the great Corn∣wallis on the momentous event, that we have now in contemplati∣on; "Great let me call him though conquered by your hero; eve∣ry manoeuvre hazarded, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orties, resistance, all proved fruitless!

<P>Justly may we exclaim—O God of mercy! never more let us hear the sighs of misery, or groans of despair—let us never more behold man destroying his fellow creature. The British army bro∣ken down in strength, exhausted in spirit, hope fled, no succour as hand, were constrained to surrender.</P>
<P>The gallantry of your hero on that day was truly signalized, even in the choice of his officer (Lieutenant Colonel Lawrens) for ar∣ranging the terms of capitulation.—That at the very period; while the father was immured in the gloomy dungeons of a British bastile, the son was penning articles, whereby an English nobleman and British arm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>came prisoners of war.</P>
<P>That was the day of Columbia's triumph!

<P>Your Hero manifested his rational exultation, by a general re∣lease of all who lay under arrest; that there might not be (as he expressed himself) a single American, who should not participate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the universal joy—By orders of your Chief Commander, divine service was performed two days after the capitulation, in all the brigades of the American army; in testimony of their gratitude to the Most High, for his surprising <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nterposition at that decisive event. How unlike this, was that blasphemous Te De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m of Ca∣tharine late Empress of Russia; a disgrace to all the sensibility, re∣finement and fascination of women; chanted by her savage soldiery, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owled rather by her blood-hounds of war, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter their cold deliber∣ate murder of twenty two thousand aged men, women, and chil∣dren at the gates of Warsaw, the capital of unfortunate Poland.</P>
<P>No doubt your Washington at the period alluded to above could avow it in the presence of the immortal God, that he would not then have given up, (even without the sweet hope of an eternal re∣compence in a more perfect state) the noble feelings of his heart, that elevation of mind, which ever accompanies, active, suffering, triumphant virtue, for the seductive smiles of a Court, the gaudy trappings of Royalty, or the glories of a Crown.</P>
<P>A few months after the capture of Lord Cornwallis, the British government cured of their mania for conquest, and yet in the very paroxism of wounded ambition, after seven years bloody experience, were compelled to abandon all offensive operations on your conti∣nent—Their hostile operations coverged to a point, and the grand catastrophe of the American war opened to the astonished world.</P>
<P>Having terminated the renowned exploits at York Town, your Chief returned with part of his exulting victorious troops to the vicinity of New-York—Few deeds of heroism remained for him now to atchieve—The definitive treaty was signed—Your Inde∣pendence reluctantly acknowledged with bleeding hearts, amid ex∣hausted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ances and tarnished glory, on the third day of Septem∣ber, 1783—</P>

<P>Your Washington could boast the noblest of Empires, the Empires he gained over the minds of his countrymen—Military force, or popular caprice, may give power, but nothing can give lasting au∣thority, except <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure wisdom and spotless virtue—By these your He∣ro obtained, by these he preserved, a dominion in the hearts of his f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llow citizens, unstained by bloody usurpation—a dominion con∣ferred by public affection, continued by public gratitude.</P>

<P>I would now assume the privilege of addressing for a few mo∣ments, you Gentlemen of the Brotherhood, distinguished by the ancient and honorable appellatiion of Free and Accepted Masons: Perhaps silence here would better far become me, stranger as I am to the sacred mysteries of your Craft. Yet surely, after the ennobled testimony afforded this d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, of your poignant sorrow, and exquisite regret, for the loss of your Illustrious Brother General George Washington, silence in me would border on a crime.</P>
<P>Gentlemen, the eyes of the world are upon you; PERHAPS I might have added, (without a breach of the laws of charity) of a prejudiced bigotted and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> world. In every clime and in every country, you will find sneaking dastardly souls; cowardly as∣sasins, who gratify their black hearts, in deceitfully whispering away more<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> character, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to bring down manly excellence and sterling worth, to a level with their own contemptible insignifi∣cance; no doubt▪ your fair fame has been corroded by the venom of slanderous aspersion; doubtless the tongue of calumny has prated to your disadvantage: But you you will take care gentlemen, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> yourselves with such circumspection and correct propriety, (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the digui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed Philosopher of antiquity) as that nobody will

<P>From the history of the world, Masonry has been patronized in every age, by the wise, the great, the good—Your enemies have never as yet dared to cavil this position—and yet it is a dole∣ful truth, that not a few of the fraternity, have by irreverent lan∣guage, and inglorious deeds, disgraced the profession, and afford∣ed lamentable cause for gainsayers to open their mouths; this however is no valid objection against the excellence of the insti∣tution itself—for that pure, spotless, all perfect system of Religion promulgated by the sacred Jesus, has been dishonoured by thou∣sands of worthless votaries—If though after your various gradations in Masonry, you should GENERALLY prove more ungracious and immoral—less pure in heart—less temperate in enjoyment—l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss guarded in expression—less reverential to Heaven, than in the for∣mer history of your life; in that case, it would undoubtedly pro∣claim aloud, that there was something in the craft, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad a fatal tendency to corrupt morals, and deprave the heart. But you will take care Gentlemen Free Masons, to prove the reverse to the world, by that most convincing of all arguments, a holy life and honorable deportment—that you are indeed and in TRUTH MEN, BRETHREN, CHRISTIANS▪ When through future life▪ in the retirements of your Lodge, you may glance the anxious eye of fraternal condolence, on the lively Emblems exhibited to day, of your deceased Brother and America in mourning—That weep∣ing Urn and that drooping Eagle—Be taught, to li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ye to yonder Heaven, to that celestial temple above, where your Washington dwells in ceaseless harmony and love divine.

<P>In fine, I would beg leave to address you Gentlemen Citizens. Soldiers, Mili<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a, who have taken up arms in the cause of your country; we entreat you to persevere in opposition to every diffi∣culty, until you have fully attained the use of arms for the service of your country, which you have nobly in view. Then every little hill will become a strong-hold, and every village pour forth an most to defend itself; you have A COUNTRY, you have A CON∣STITUTION, well worth contending for.</P>
<P>In the energetic superior style of my reverend and dearly beloved friend and countryman, I would ask you "with what composure could you behold the wives of your bosoms, with whom ye sweetly shared life's toils and pleasures wantonly abused, in∣sulted by an abandoned soldiery, or driven to distraction by the piercing cries of an infant offspring?

<P>Do your duty citizen-soldiers and leave the event to Heaven's Lord; the womb of Providence teems with mighty events; con∣vulsions shake the European nations; whether despotism shall prevail or the standard of liberty wave victorious "is the questi∣on?" Indeed when or where these unexampled commotions shall terminate, God, even our God only knows?

Persevere brave and worthy men! may the almighty though invisible arm of Jehovah defend you as with a shield whilst here, and the peaceful abodes of an immortal Paradise be your everlasting inheritance hereafter.</P>
