<Q><HI>"THE LORD RAISED UP A DELIVERER TO THE CHIL∣DREN OF ISRAEL."</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS day, a very large and extensive Na∣tion exhibit every token of funeral sorrow.—Wherever we turn our eyes, we behold the signals of mourning displayed.—The countenance of ev∣ery American citizen proclaims, in silent accents, that man is mortal; that no character, or station in life, exempts from the irrevocable sentence, <HI>"Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return."</HI></P>
<P>OUR <HI>WASHINGTON</HI> IS NO MORE!—Had he continued to this day, he would have com∣pleted sixty eight years; but the LORD of all worlds, who gave him as our deliverer, has seen fit to call him hence; he departed this life the 14th of December last.—And, under the present cir∣cumstances, reflecting on past events, may we not experimentally comment upon the words of the text, and apply them to ourselves, as they were applied to Israel, respecting the Divine conduct towards them;—"the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel."</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="039133_0004_1013E8F596DD9B70"/>
In the time of our distress, the LORD, in like manner, raised up a deliverer to his American Is∣rael. That we may rightly understand the business, for which we are convened, it may be inquired, to whom are we to offer these honours? To of∣fer them to the dead, would be very unsuitable. To GOD only, in memory of the dead, may such offerings be paid.</P>
<P>In order, therefore, that we may properly re∣alize our loss, and sensibly feel our obligations of gratitude to the Most High GOD, for past favours; some general observations upon this passage of Scripture, by way of analogy, will now be made; which may lead to a more particular improvement.</P>
<P>As from a state of Egyptian bondage, the LORD brought Israel to possess the land of Canaan; so from a state of oppression, the LORD conducted our Fore-Fathers to inherit this land, that here they might peaceably enjoy that religion which they could not in their native country.</P>
<P>The obstacles which obstructed Israel when entering upon their inheritance, were many and great; and the interpositions of Providence were wonderful in fulfilling the promise of this event, which was made to Abraham, that his seed should possess that land. Great also were the dangers which our Progenitors encountered, and signal were the displays of Divine goodness, in their set∣tling in this then uncultivated wilderness.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="039133_0005_1013E8F71FEB18C8"/>
Israel, for a long time, flourished in their new settlements; even so long as they served the LORD, they sat down quietly, having none to make them afraid; for the LORD was their defence. No less did the LORD give rest to his people, in this Co∣lumbian land; and defended the vine, which his own right hand had planted, from the violence of all those who rose up against them.</P>
<P>At this period, referred to by the Divine his∣torian, Israel, because they had sinned, were great∣ly oppressed by a foreign nation, into whose hand the LORD had sold them for their transgression against him: Thus they were greatly distressed be∣cause the Mesopotamians reigned over them. In their trouble, they cried unto the LORD, and the LORD heard them, and raised up for them a deliv∣erer—even Othniel, the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother: And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him; and the LORD delivered Israel by his hand. Not unsimilar was the state of our nation, when our liberties were attacked by the power of Britain.</P>
<P>We may learn something of our critical situa∣tion at that time, if we revert back to the memora∣ble period of the massacre at Boston, which took place in the year of our LORD 1770. After that, the circumstances grew more threatening, and the dangers were greatly increased, by the enforcing of the <HI>Stamp-Act,</HI> and other unreasonable <HI>duties,</HI> which
<PB N="6" REF="039133_0006_1013E8F90A32C760"/>
occasioned the destruction of <HI>tea</HI> in the year 1773. The consternation from that time spread far and wide, so that the several States, each one consult∣ing for their own safety, sent Delegates, who met at Philadelphia, September 5th, 1774, to form a <HI>Union,</HI> and to adopt measures to defend the com∣mon <HI>Interest.</HI></P>
<P>But, humanly speaking, how <HI>weak,</HI> if compar∣ed with those by whom they were opposed! How unprepared for <HI>War,</HI> as to military skill, and war-like equipments! Without any established form of Government, or public resources!</P>
<P>Under these distressing circumstances, what could Congress do? Having organized them∣selves, they endeavoured to assert the rights to which the Colonies were entitled by the laws of nature, the principles of the English Constitution, and their several Charters. Among those rights, were considered Life, Liberty, and Property; a right to dispose of which, without their consent, they had given to no sovereign power whatever. Yet, rather than rashly to set up for Independence, they sue for peace, by way of entreaty.</P>
<P>Now, leaving the infant Republic, trembling through fear, yet firmly asserting her native right, while she stretches out the suppliant hand, seeking a just redress of her wrongs; we may, for a mo∣ment, turn our eyes on the side of our unnatural enemy: And we behold them, a great and mighty
<PB N="7" REF="039133_0007_1013E8FBA1D8A858"/>
nation, renowned in all the arts of war, furnished with every needed supply, masters of the sea, and deaf to all proposals of accommodation short of un∣conditional submission.—Vain, O America! was the help of man! This, our political Fathers saw, in the day of our calamity. Therefore the Congress, June 7th, 1775, resolved, that Thursday, July 20th, be observed, throughout the Twelve United Colo∣nies, as a day of humiliation, fasting, and prayer. Thus in the day of their affliction, they cried unto the LORD.</P>
<P>It was now needful, that some one should be appointed Commander in Chief, on whom it should devolve to manage the whole war. June 15th, the Congress, by ballot, unanimously chose <HI>GEORGE WASHINGTON,</HI> Esq. to this office. He was then in the 43d year of his age.—From early life he had been trained up for such a day as <HI>this:</HI> amply furnished with military skill and political knowledge—and had now arrived to mature age for renown∣ed exploits. A specimen of <HI>his</HI> character, whom GOD raised up as our deliverer, and to whom our country entrusted all which they held dear, we may see in his answer when invited to accept his ap∣pointment. The President of the House request∣ed his acceptance. He, <HI>(Washington)</HI> standing in his place, said:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MR. PRESIDENT,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I am truly sensible of the high honour done me, in this appointment, yet I feel great distress, from a con∣sciousness
<PB N="8" REF="039133_0008_1013E9004D20AFF0"/>
that my abilities and military experience may not be equal to the extensive and important trust. However, as the Congress desire it, I will enter upon the momentous duty, and exert every power I possess, in their service, and for the sup∣port of the glorious cause. I beg they will accept my most cordial thanks, for this distinguished testimony of their appro∣bation.</P>
<P>But, lest some unlucky event should happen, unfavour∣able to my reputation, I beg it may be remembered, by every gentleman in the room, that I this day declare, with the ut∣most sincerity, I do not think myself equal to the command I am honoured with.</P>
<P>"As to pay, Sir, I beg leave to assure the Congress, that, as no pecuniary consideration could have tempted me to accept this arduous employment, at the expense of my domestic ease and happiness, I do not wish to make any profit from it. I will keep an exact account of my expenses: Those, I doubt not, they will discharge—and that is all I desire.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>From that day, the eyes of all were turned up∣on him as the Commander in Chief of the Ameri∣can forces. This office he filled, to the great satis∣faction of his fellow citizens, to the terror of his enemies, and to the astonishment of the world;—manifesting, on all occasions, fidelity, skill, firm∣ness, and resolution; till at length he obtained for the United Independent States. an honourable peace, which was ratified by Great Britain in the year 1784.</P>
<P>How HE, who ruleth among the nations, has improved him as an instrument of saving his peo-people, from the time of his leaving the army, till he departed this life, it is unnecessary to relate. The
<PB N="9" REF="039133_0009_1013E901D51F9F90"/>
history is so recent, and his public virtues have so deeply impressed the mind of every American citi∣zen, that we may clearly see, that as "the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel." when in their trouble they cried unto him—so GOD hath done for us.</P>
<P>Thus our subject opens into a very extensive field for contemplation and practical improvement.—Whenever we look back upon the complex scene of the American revolution, and duly con∣sider, from a statement of facts, how it was brought about—what difficulties have been overcome—what obstacles have been surmounted—till, from small beginnings, the Republic is become great, even the most permanent and flourishing kingdom in the world—an asylum of <HI>Liberty,</HI> both civil and religious—and all this so much owing, as a mean, to the skill, wisdom, and political virtue of one man—we are filled with reverential wonder at the coun∣sels of Heaven. And we may hence nationally in∣fer, that this great event, in all its connections, was fixed in the divine mind <HI>long before</HI> it took place: "For known unto GOD are all his works, from the beginning of the world; even to him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will."</P>
<P>Hence also it appears evident, that our deliver∣ance, from time to time, <HI>was, has been,</HI> and <HI>still is,</HI> of the LORD. He is the LORD of Hosts: he doth his pleasure among the children of men: he hath
<PB N="10" REF="039133_0010_1013E9046518DF38"/>
made use of instruments, such as he chose; but has ever manifested himself wonderful in counsel. Ev∣ery instance of our salvation, he hath wrought in such a way and in such a manner as might lead us <HI>to feel</HI> our entire dependance: for he hath raised up, and hath put down; showing, that the race is not to the swist, nor the battle to the strong—As he saved Israel of old, so hath he saved us. We may therefore adopt their song, and say, "If it had not been the Lord who was on our side; now may Israel say, if it had not been the Lord who was on our side, when men rose up against us, then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us: then the waters had overwhelm∣ed us, the stream had gone over our soul: then the proud waters had gone over our soul. Blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth."</P>
<P>We further learn, that to attribute any thing more of our safety to any man, than as being one whom the Lord raised up, qualified and improved, as an instrument, would be to rob God of that glo∣ry which is due to his name from us whom he hath delivered. There is a propriety in rendering to all their dues; "tribute, to whom tribute is due; cus∣tom, to whom custom; fear, to whom fear; honor▪ to whom honor." God is the rightful Proprietor and the Supreme Governor of all things. Every good, of which any are the recepients, is from him,
<PB N="11" REF="039133_0011_1013E90623C7F150"/>
and thanksgiving therefor is due to his name.—Creatures▪ by whom, as instruments, God at any time communicates his favours, are, for the same reason, to be considered as the ministers of God; and as such they are to be regarded and treated; and, even for their works sake, to be respected.—But, we may not give that honour to the servant, which is due to his master; we may not ascribe that to the creature, which is due to the great Creator, who is Lord of all—without being guilty of sacri∣lege more criminal than can justly be charged up∣on the hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen world. Let us take heed, therefore, while we render to man his due, that we also ren∣der to God the things which are God's: For we may with propriety apply to ourselves, what God said upon this subject to his ancient Israel: "I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other gods before Me. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in Heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: For I the LORD thy God <HI>am a jealous God</HI> visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth gene∣ration of them that hat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> me; and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments." And we may add the words of
<PB N="12" REF="039133_0012_101466CBF4C9CB40"/>
the prophet, "I am the LORD, that is my name, and my glory will I not give to another; neither my praise to graven images."</P>
<P>In reference to the present occasion, our subject may well penetrate every heart with a feeling sense of this important truth, that as we have reason to mourn the loss of a much beloved Citizen, who has been, in his day, useful beyond what we can fully describe; so, in the same proportion, we are un∣der obligation of gratitude to the Great Giver of every good, for the bestowment of such an one. In him centred all the rare endowments needful for the important station to which he was assigned. Through the different stages of his public life, he has passed with a character unsullied▪ His virtues are known—His examples shine—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> counsels (as a parent's to his children) being regarded, will re∣dound to our future peace:—So that he, being dead, yet speaketh. When such a friend, so beloved—when such a citizen, so respected—when such a pa∣tron, so universally considered as the deliverer of his country, is removed, who can refrain from tears! When the beauty of America is fallen, shall not her daughters weep! What heart so insensible as not to share in the general grief!—His name will live in the memory of every American, so long as they shall relish the sweets of Liberty—or rather than submit to servitude, they shall chuse to be free.—To what other man were we ever so much indebted
<PB N="13" REF="039133_0013_1013E90E3AB59A20"/>
for our independent establishment, political peace, and civil privileges, as we are to him? Yet while, as worthy of our attention and imitation, we call to mind the virtues, the public services, and the unshaken patriotism, of the deceased, and pay these grateful respects to his memory, we ought carefully to bear this in mind, that to us he was one of the gifts of Heaven, raised up for those important pur∣poses which were effected by him. Let us never forget the goodness of God, in his benefits bestow∣ed upon our land. And to express suitable feelings of heart under this bereaving providence, we may adopt the words of Job in his affliction, "the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord."</P>
<P>Moreover, our political parent, deceased, has left us in the full possession of the most valuable Legacy, which the great Parent of all blessings did, by him, as an instrument, bequeath to us—even an established <HI>Independence</HI> among the nations, and a permanent and well organized <HI>Government,</HI> un∣der which we enjoy all the natural immunities ap∣pertaining to a free people. In conformity to mo¦ral obligation—in imitation of those virtues, by the medium of which these public rights were procured—and influenced by the animating prospect of fu∣ture political happiness—let us exert ourselves, in our several characters, to maintain our rank in the scale of nations, to support our constitutional Gov∣ernment,
<PB N="14" REF="039133_0014_1013E90FCD890EB0"/>
and thereby preserve our privileges in∣violate, that we may leave them a rich inheritance for our posterity.</P>
<P>And now, while we thus decorate the tomb of our much respected friend, with laurels of respect, wet with tears, and raise monuments to his memory as our deliverer, we should take heed lest we for∣get the divine favours received by the hand of oth∣ers, and overlook that tribute of respect due to them as having deserved well of their country, ma∣ny of whom, while contending in the field of battle for the cause of Liberty and Religion, met an ear∣ly death. Many, in every rank of citizens, have done worthily; and even the private soldier, who is virtuous and valiant, is entitled to honour. In our struggle to defend our privileges, the Lord in∣spired our <HI>Senators</HI> with wisdom, our <HI>Officers</HI> with skill, and our <HI>Armies</HI> with courage; but sent saint∣ness into the hearts of our enemies. Therefore our salvation was of the Lord, in ways mysterious and unexpected—and to his name be the glory.</P>
<P>We shall now only observe further, that as the Lord has been our refuge, our strength, and our glory, so there is every encouragement, in a hum∣ble, penitent manner, still to make him our confi∣dence. To whom shall we go, but unto the Lord? With him is counsel and strength. Praise is due to his name, that we have so many worthy charac∣ters now active on the stage of life; and in partic∣ular,
<PB N="15" REF="039133_0015_1013E911AD01AEC8"/>
that our Confederate Chair of State is filled with one on whom rests the spirit of Elijah—and that our Government is so wisely administered by men of our own chusing, but of God's providing.</P>
<P>We ought, therefore, ever to implore the Most High, who is the Father of lights, that he would graciously give us <HI>men of integrity,</HI> to fill every pub∣lic station, and endow them with wisdom to discern both time and judgment: so shall we be that hap∣py people, whose God is the LORD.</P>
