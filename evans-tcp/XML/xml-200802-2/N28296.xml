<P>THERE is hardly any apology, that has been offered for publi∣cations of this kind, which the author of the following sermon might not have brought forward, on the present occasion. But he has thought fit to decline the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all.—When Congress appointed thirty days of mourning for General Washington, it occurred to him, that this was the number which the Israelites wept for Moses. Up∣on a moment's reflection, he was forcibly strack with the astonishing coincidence between the principal circumstances and events of their lives. More of these might have been pointed out, but that would have extended the discourse to an unusual size.—It will perhaps, be objected, that any thing like a parallel between an <HI>In∣spired Prophet of the Lord,</HI> who was assisted, in the execution of his commission, by an extraordinary series of miracles, and a <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n,</HI> who accomplished exploits, however great, apparently by human means, is improper. The author flatters himself, that it will be readily perceived, that he has not attempted a parallel, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> those circumstances of similarity which are certainly very striking.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>VENERATION for the memory of illustrious personages is a sentiment so congenial to the human mind, that it h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s discovered itself, in some way or other, in all ages and countries. In the days of ig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orance and idolatry, when t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere was neither light to guide, nor authority to control the wandering imaginations of men, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ancy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g their heroes, their law-givers and their s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, to be admitted to some share in the affairs of Heaven, they paid them divine honors—they implored their protectio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>—they deprecated their anger. This was even the case among those nations of antiquity, who had made considerable advances towards civilization and refinement. O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hers who were deeper sunk in ignorance, or farther advanced in corruption, exhi∣bited, in veneration of their admired characters, every practice that folly could suggest, or stupidity countenance.</P>
<P>The Jews, a nation selected from amidst the general corrup∣tion of mankind, as a repository of the truth, with their minds under the direction and control of laws and regulations dic∣tated by Heaven, by no means abolished the custom of vene∣rating the memory of the deceased, but only prevented this veneration from shewing itself, by any sinful practices, or ri∣diculous exhibitions. Nor does christianity, the intention of which is not to eradicate, but to correct the natural propensi∣ties of the human mind, forbid, but even sanction, a rational respect, and long remembrance of the virtues and services or great and illustrious men. And then, with a benevolence pe∣culiar to that lovely institution, it places every thing in a way to improve the hearts of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, to meliorate their condition
<PB N="6" REF="037716_0006_100EF264C1312148"/>
here on earth, and to prepare them for a state of more perfect happiness, when this world and all its customs shall have pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed away.</P>
<P>The correspondence between the occasion which detained the Israelites, thirty days in the plains of Moab, and that which has assembled us here this day, is singularly striking. They had to lament their deliverer, their leader, and their law-giver. And how astonishingly were all these characters united in the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat personage, to whose memory we have this day met to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y our grateful tribute of respect!</P>
<P>Let us, only for a moment, advert to the principal circum∣stances of their lives, and the great events of their conduct.— When Moses was tending his flock upon Mount Horeb, he was called by God, to rescue his nation from the rigor of Egyptian bondage. An encroachment upon the rights of his country called Washington from his farm on the banks of the Potomac. It is true, the latter did not, like the former, hear the voice of God, but when he was appointed to command the American army, the most hardy sceptic will scarcely dare to doubt, that, in this appointment, Congress was directed by the finger of God. If ever there was a time, when the minds of this ve∣nerable body of man were totally divested of every passion— every interested view, or ambitious project, and actuated solely by the love of their country, it was at this momentous period. The gallantry, and profound military skill, which he displayed, in rescuing the remains of the vanquished army of Br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ddock from the unrelenting arms of a savage foe, fixed every eye upon Washington, as the fittest character to conduct the armies of America.</P>
<P>And here again, we have a wonderful coincidence between the manner in which the Deliverer of Israel and of America accepted their commissions. Moses, although he received his appointment from the Supreme Ruler of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, yet his mind was so impressed with the weight of the unde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g, that he would fain have shrunk from the task. When the unanimous voice of his country called Washington to command, his soul, great as it was, labored under the pressure of so vast <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> design, and had not a ruling maxim of his life, silenced both hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mo∣desty and diffidence, he would, no doubt, have declined the appointment. This maxim was, that it was the duty of a good
<PB N="7" REF="037716_0007_100EF2665A051648"/>
man to be always ready, to exert all his powers, and to risk his life and fortune in his country's cause.</P>
<P>Diffidence is the attribute of a great mind. Men of little souls and feeble understandings, who are easily elated by honor or intoxicated by distinction, will readily undertake any thing, but accomplish nothing. Whereas those, who have minds ca∣pacious enough to see and duly appreciate the difficulties of great undertakings, and who are urged on by no sinister mo∣tives, will seldom fail to feel some reluctance in accepting im∣portant offices. From this embarrassment Moses was relieved by the voice of God. And had not Washington, from having viewed the cause in which he was about to embark in every aspect, and feeling an entire conviction of its justice, and the purity of his own motives, been persuaded that the Lord would be upon his side, his soul would have recoiled at the prospect before him. But indeed, this was a principle which, in every arduous undertaking, uniformly supported this pious man.</P>
<P>Moses was assisted in the execution of his commission, by the visible hand of God. If it should be contended, that no miracles were wrought in favor of Washington—that his foes were neither infested with plagues, nor overwhelmed by the sea, it will hard∣ly be denied, that this singular personage was raised up by the Supreme Being to accomplish such a mighty work, as was far beyond the powers of common men. For let us only follow him through his military career, after he took the command of the American army at Cambridge. To discipline this body of men, unaccustomed to the strictness and order of a military life, and with a high sense of their own importance: collected also from all parts of an extensive continent, and possessing tempers almost as various as the climates from which they came, was nearly as difficult as 'to link the jarring elements in peace.' And all this too, was to be done in the face of a powerful foe.</P>
<P>The brave and undaunted soldier, whom no enemy can ap∣pal, nor danger subdue—the great general who can arrange his army with skill, and lead it on with gallantry in the field of battle, are characters, though justly held in much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stimation, far inferior to that of Washington. It is not at Trenton, where after contending with the elements, that seemed to be at war—where after subduing the Delaware, rolling on, terrible with ice, he led on, through frost and snow, his half-naked ar∣my, and surprised and vanquished the enemy.—It is not on the
<PB N="8" REF="037716_0008_100EF2695F963268"/>
plains of Monmouth, where he severely checked and compelled to retire under the cover of night, a powerful foe—Nor is it in Virginia, where his skill &amp; valour forced to capitulate, a general high in reputation, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the head of a brave army, that we see our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ero moving in his most exalted sphere. Had not his wisdom been commensurate with his valour, he might, in a few months, have ruined the American <HI>cause.</HI> Had he been only c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lculated for brilliant exploits in the field, he would have been an unfit person for the trust reposed in him. But when we behold him with an army, most even of the officers of which were unacquainted with the art of war—when we find this army sometimes almost without ammunition, and often in∣deed reduced to little more than a name—when we consider, that it was many times upon the point of mutining for want of pay, and fit to perish for want of cloaths—and when we re∣flect that this army kept in check a formidable foe, protected an extensive country, in a great measure, from rapine, and fi∣nally surmounted every obstacle, it is hardly possible for us duly to appreciate the merits of its leader.</P>
<P>The war in America was of a singular nature. The Ameri∣cans had not only to contend with a nation far famed for war∣like atchievements, but under the threats of punishment for re∣bellion, and almost at the point of the bayonet, they had to form a system of government, and to reduce all things to order and method. To prescribe regulations for an army was a no∣vel task to those on whom it devolved, and had they not wisely listened to the modest suggestions, and adopted the judicious plans of Washington, all might soon have been lost. His great soul was unweariedly employed in this arduous business. As difficulties increased, it expanded, and for seven long years, which would have exhausted the perseverance, and worn out the resolution of any but this wonderful man, his mind was incessantly engaged. Like a torrent, which when interrupted in its course, swells above its banks and at last overcomes every obstacle; so his powers increased, as difficulties thickened or dangers pressed.</P>
<P>Let us now view the close of this varied and tumultuous scene. The enemy subdued, and peace about to return to a land worn out with the horrors of war, Washington stood at the head of an army, that had exposed their lives, hazarded their he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lth, and injured their fortunes, in their country's cause. And this army
<PB N="9" REF="037716_0009_100EF26B5A505400"/>
was unrewarded, and would have followed on, whithersoever he might have wished to lead them. Had he possessed an as∣piring and ambitious spirit, he might have seized the reins of power, enriched his soldiers with the spoils of his country, and himself become its Ruler or its Tyrant. But more like an angel of peace, he soothed their discontents—he appeased their anger. When he took leave of his officers, the scene was interesting indeed! Those hardy veterans, whom no ene∣my could move, or danger overcome, were melted into tears, when about to part with their beloved Washington. And when he resigned that commission, under which he had raised his country to independence and to glory, he was more than illustrious. This was a point to which the eyes of the whole world were directed with anxiety, and which will command admiration while the world shall remain. Nay, methinks I see the spirits of the heroes of antiquity hovering around to behold and to wonder at this scene!!</P>
<P>When we view the conduct of many great and popular Ge∣nerals, who have subdued countries, and overturned govern∣ments—when we cast our eyes over the horrid scenes of revo∣lutions in other lands—when we behold demagogues wading thro' blood and slaughter to seize upon power, we cannot be thankful enough to the Supreme Disposer of nations, for having raised up a Washington in this favored country.</P>
<P>And now he returns to the caresses of his family, and to the tranquility of private life. But dear as this was to his soul, it was not long his portion. His country had more services, that required the able hand of Washington. Here I might still mark the similarity between the Law-giver of Israel and of America. Moses had not long rescued the Israelites from Egyptian bondage, until he was called up by God into Mount Sinai, to receive a system of laws, both civil and re∣ligious. It is true, when Washington was called from his peaceful abode, no mountain smoked—no thunder roared—no voice was heard from heaven. But as civil government is the ordinance of God, those, who are instrumental in fixing the form and administering the offices of government, are to be considered, in a high degree, as his agents. A constituti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n formed amidst the distraction of war, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s found, upon tri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, to be inadequate to secure the rights and promote the welfare
<PB N="10" REF="037716_0010_100EF26F276D1038"/>
of this vast and growing empire. And when a new form of government was proposed, and finally adopted, the wishes of all hearts were fixed upon Washington, for the administration of this government. Faction, furious and intolerant as it of∣ten is, was afraid to shew its hideous face, where once his name was mentioned.</P>
<P>He now appears in a new character. His fame, as a gene∣ral, had resounded from one end of the world to the other; his integrity stood far above suspicion; but it remained yet to be tried, how he would appear as a statesman. He began his course, under many disadvantages. There was no beaten track to direct: there were no fixed principles to govern: all things, and indeed all characters were new. Heaven, how∣ever, always smiles upon the virtuous efforts of pious men. He put this grand machine in motion—he conducted it with a masterly hand. His policy was founded in justice, his plans were formed by wisdom, and executed with vigor. Having no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, but the prosperity and glory of his country, he was never p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rplexed by contending passions or clashing interests. Possessing a clear judgment, and an extensive knowledge of the interests, passions, and relations of his country; having been long habituated to view things in every aspect, and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the result of every measure, his administration soon be∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> the wonder of other nations, and the glory of his own. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> extensive empire rose, under his paternal care, to repu∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion and to wealth. Her commerce extended almost over the whole world—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er agriculture improved—arts and sciences flourished, and there was nothing to be seen but one gene∣ral slow of prosperity among all descriptions of citizens.</P>
<P>While thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thus prospered in America, those diabolical principles, which had been secretly in operation, in several parts of Europe, ever since the time of Voltaire, began to burst into open action, and the whole European world had li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to have been involved in one universal flame. It soon became an object with the hostile powers, to endeavour to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> assistance from America. And such was their confidence, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> their diplomatic <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that they little doubted of success. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t this port<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ous crisis, Washington, as if raised upon an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>inence, viewed with extensive prospect, the situation, the interest, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and the duty of his country, and finding
<PB N="11" REF="037716_0011_100EF26D2FDBB198"/>
that no obligation forbid, he placed it in the pleasing, and advantageous position of neutrality.</P>
<P>This step having been deliberately taken, the intrigues of faction, foreign or domestic, could neither surprize him at his post, nor force him from his ground. Storms arose upon every side—tempests beat—and thunder roared, yet he re∣mained unmoved as a rock amidst the conflicting elements. Too wise, to relinquish precipitately the advantages of peace, yet too brave, to dread the horrors of war, he calmly demanded redress for the injuries done to his country; and this redress the British nation was pleased to give. War between America and that nation, was what the French had long been laboring to produce. And finding themselves defeated, they attacked the character of Washington—they insulted our government— they plundered our commerce—they abused our citizens—they disseminated their disorganizing and wide-wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting principles, from north to south, from the shores of the Atlantic to the banks of the Mississippi. They vainly hoped to raise a faction powerful enough, to crush Washington, and with him the vir∣tue, and the strength of America. Amidst all this, he steered a correct and an even course, faithful to the principles of an impartial neutrality. The unexampled prosperity, that at∣tended his measures, it might have been supposed, would have silenced opposition, and shamed faction out of countenance. But as well might the Ethiopian expect to change his skin, or the leopard his spots.</P>
<P>Having thus guided the helm of state, thro' many danger∣ous rocks and tremendous storms, and pointed the course, that it ought to be steered; old age advancing apace, he thought himself at last justifiable in retiring to the much desired quie∣tude of private life. Still like the great Patriarch, he calls the whole family of America around him, to receive his parting advice. He points out to them those evils, that would most endanger their welfare, and tells them, that to be happy, they must be united, virtuous and pious—And thus he ends his political career.</P>
<P>After viewing his character as a general and statesman, we will now turn to his religion. This I consider as a very im∣portant part of the duty of this day, particularly at so per∣plexed a time as the present. New principles, and new modes of conduct seem, every day, to be intruded upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
<PB N="12" REF="037716_0012_100EF2719C4E5680"/>
and indeed the religious, as well as the political world seems to be agitated from one end to the other. In such a state of things, for America to have possessed a <HI>Chief Magistrate</HI> who adhered to the faith and the practice of christianity, is no less a m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tter of triumph, than his loss is a subject of regret. In∣fidelity seems to have made as bold attempts upon us, as ever the idolatry of the surrounding nations did upon the Jews. And, it is much to be feared, that if we had possessed no Washington and other eminent characters, to ward off its at∣tacks, it would have found too easy admission. Moses was only forty days absent from the Israelites, when they made a golden calf. And had Washington been withdrawn from us at one peculiar crisis, this house might have perhaps been a Temple of <HI>Reason,</HI> instead of a Christian Church.</P>
<P>It was his religion, that gave the finishing stroke to his cha∣racter. The blustering warrior—the impious statesman, will never find a place in the roll of fame, at the head of which, will stand the name of Washington. Such was his piety, that, on all occasions, he considered himself as an humble instrument in the hands of God, to accomplish the purposes of his provi∣dence. There are many here who have read, and some perhaps who heard the reflections, which he made, upon the wonderful combination of circumstances, apparently trivial, which saved the American army from destruction, by the treachery of Ar∣nold.

address, the testimony which he bore to the influence of reli∣gion, upon both private and public happiness, ought never to be forgotten. We ought to 'teach i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to our children—we ought to talk of it when we sit in our houses—when we walk by the way—when we lie down, and when we rise up.' Shall we ever again hear in the land where Washington lived, that religion is only calculated for men of weak and puny under∣standings?—That to attend public worship is idle and unne∣cessary, or that institutions for religious instruction are not among the strongest pillars of human society! Men of narrow capacities or corrupted hearts, may not see the influence of these upon public and private felicity, but Washington <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of opinion, that it would require a volume to trace all their con∣nections. In private life he was no less amiable, than he was illustrious in public. On both, his principles operated with uniformity—And when he came to die he had nothing to fear. His life, like a river after passing over many a tremendous pre∣cipice, and through many a winding vale, issued, calm and smooth, into the ocean of eternity. 'Mark, then, the perfect man, and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace.'</P>
<P>Thus lived, and thus died this great man. His country has much reason to be grateful to Heaven for his services, and much reason to mourn his loss. His military fame stood like a ram∣part around it, impregnable to foreign force. His well-tried patriotism kept foreign incendiaries at a distance, and defeated the machinations of internal faction.— The splendor of his virtue eclipsed the feeble lights of the illuminati—they disappeared before it, like the stars at the approach of the sun. But, alas! he is no more!! Methinks I see the <HI>Genius</HI> of America weeping over his tomb, and utter∣ing this melancholy lamentation. Would to God, my Wash∣ington had lived, till this stormy scene had passed, and peace again beamed upon the earth! Should war destroy my sons, and waste my country—should discord rend, or infidelity corrupt my citizens, to whom shall I resort!!</P>
<P>But the influence of the good is not confined to the short period of human life. As he has erected a <HI>Fabric of Liberty,</HI> which nothing but the vices or the folly of his suc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essors can destroy, so he has left an example, which, like a lamp suspend∣ed under the arch of Heaven, will afford light to America, for many ages. When the mother, anxious for the future fortunes

of her darling child, shall prefer her daily orisons to Heaven; the will pray to grant him a portion of the same spirit that Washington possessed. When the father shall apply his care to form the character of his son, he will place before him the life of Washington. When Ame∣rica shall want a person to command her armies or direct her councils, she will look for one, who comes as near as may be, to the character of Washington. Indeed, it would be exceed∣ingly wise, on all occasions, when we elect persons for any of the important offices of government, to inquire how far they resemble this luminous example. We ought not to conceive ourselves, for a moment in safety, if we allow vice to raise its horrible countenance; or permit ourselves to be under the di∣rection of aspiring, wicked, or impious men. Should we dis∣regard the blessings which God has been pleased to bestow up∣on us—should we sport with our dearest rights—and permit some sacriligious hand to lay hold of the helm of state—should we suffer his benign and holy religion to be trampled under foot; and modern infidelity to seize upon its temples, 'angry Heaven will soon mark us out for ruin, and war overwhelm us in the dream of vice—vice!—it is vice that shakes the nerves of every state, freezes its veins, and withers all its powers.'</P>
<P>Let us cultivate with care, and diligently instil into the minds of our children, the amiable virtues of the christian re∣ligion, which extend their friendly influence through every branch of public and private life. If the faith of this religion govern the hearts, and its precepts regulate the lives of those, with whom we trust our national concerns, unanimity will soon pervade our councils—wholesome laws will infuse health and vigor through the whole body politic—the rancor of party-spirit will subside—contentions for power, honor or interest will disappear—every conflicting passion will be at peace. 'The wolf will dwell with the lamb; the leopard will lie down with the kid, and the calf, and the young lion and the fatling toge∣ther, and a little child shall lead them.' The sunshine of <HI>union</HI> and of peace will gladden the whole land, 'and the Lord thy God will set thee on high, above all nations of the earth. And all these blessings shall come upon thee—Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be in the field. Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, the fruit of thy cattle and the flocks of thy sheep. Blessed shall be thy
