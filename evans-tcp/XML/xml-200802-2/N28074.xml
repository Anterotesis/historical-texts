<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE Legislature of the UNITED STATES, by the act lately passed for an Uniform System of, Bankruptcy, having adopted the Principles of the Bankrupt Laws of England, the Author of this Pub∣lication, conceived that a set of Precedents adapted to the Practice, would be acceptable to the Gentlemen of the Profession, and others who may be concerned in prosecuting Commissions under the said Act.—The following are therefore offered to the Public, which have been selected chiefly from those now in use in England; but where circumstances vary he has en∣deavored to form others, which it is presumed will answer the purposes or which they are designed.—The English forms of legal Proceedings, being gene∣rally considered too redundant for the Practice of this Country, the Author has aimed at brevity, as much as appeared to him consistent with necessary expla∣nation.—A few Observations are interspersed with a view to facilitate a regular mode of Practice, and it is expected the work will be found of some utility.</P>

<HEAD>A PRACTICAL TREATISE UPON THE BANKRUPT LAW.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE a Commission is applied for, it will be proper to consider whether the person against whom it is intended, is of such a Business that a Commission may be taken out against him, and that he has been guilty of an act of Bankruptcy, also that the person petitioning is, by himself or in part∣nership a Creditor for 1000 Dollars, two 1500 Dollars, or more than two 2000 Dol∣lars.—If a Creditor sues out a Commission and fails in either of these points, the Debtor will be entitled to recover such damages as mentioned in the 2d Section of the Act.</P>
<P>In order to obtain a Commission of Bank∣rupt, the Creditor must first make an affida∣vit, or <HI>(being a Quaker)</HI> an affirmation, of his Debt before the Judge of the District Court of the United States, for the District where the Debtor resides or usually resided at the time of committing the act of Bankruptcy, which affidavit may be in the following form.</P>
