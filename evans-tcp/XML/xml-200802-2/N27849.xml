<HEAD>DISCOURSE &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the death of men distinguished by superi∣or talents, high endowments, and eminent services to their country, demands the expression of public mourn∣ing and grief; their loss is accompanied generally with this mitigation, that, however grievous and painful, it is not irreparable; and that the void, caused by their mortality, will perhaps be filled up by others, uniting equal abilities with the same zeal and watch∣fulness for the general welfare. Hope then wipes off the tears, with which sorrow bedews the grave of departed worth. But on the present occasion, no such consolation can be administered; for he, whose expectations are most sanguine, dares not promise again to his country the union of so many splendid and useful virtues, as adorned that illustrious Man, whose memory excites our grateful and tender sensi∣bility, and to whose tomb the homage of his country is to be solemnly offered on this day. Whether we
<PB N="4" REF="037108_0003_100D8B910AE7B3C8"/>
consult our own experience, by bringing into compa∣rison with Washington, any of our cotemporaries, most eminent for their talents, virtues and services; or whether we search through the pages of history, to dis∣cover in them a character of equal fame; justice and truth will acknowledge, that he stands supereminent and unrivalled in the annals of mankind; and that no one before him, acting in such a variety of new and arduous situations, bore with him to the grave a repu∣tation as clear from lawless ambition, and as undefiled by injustice or oppression; a reputation, neither depres∣sed by indolence, nor weakened by irresolution, nor shadowed by those imperfections, which seemed to be the essential appendages of human nature, till provi∣dence exhibited in Washington this extraordinary phenomenon.</P>
<P>What language can be equal to the excellence of such a character? what proportion can exist between eloquence, and the tribute of praise, due to so much virtue? Nevertheless, my fellow citizens, I read in the eagerness of your attention, your desire to offer this tribute: Methinks I hear your filial piety, your tender reverence for your best friend, the Father of his country, calling on me to bear for you, at least a feeble testimony of your unextinguishable gratitude for his services, your immortal remembrance of, and veneration for his virtues. In your name therefore, I presume to add some grains of incense to the ho∣mage, which throughout the United States every friend to their happiness now presents at the shrine of Washington. Pardon, O departed Spirit of the first of
<PB N="5" REF="037108_0004_100D8B94010448D0"/>
Heroes! if with the cold accents of an exhausted imagination, I likewise dare attempt to celebrate thy name, whilst so many sons of genius, ardent in youth∣ful vigour, delineate in glowing colours the vivid features of thy mind, and the glorious deeds of thy virtuous life. With unequal steps I venture on the same career, not seeking to add lustre to the fame of Washington, or perpetuate his memory to future times; for he is already enshrined in the records of immor∣tality: but humbly hoping, that a recital of his ser∣vices will open to our countrymen the road to true honour, and kindle in their breasts the warmth of ge∣nerous emulation, and real patriotism. To contri∣bute in this manner to the best interests of his belov∣ed country, will be to him the most gratifying com∣mendation, if in the regions of immortality, human affairs still claim a share of his solicitude.</P>
<P>The language uniformly held by Washington, the maxim invariably inculcated and repeated by him in almost every public manifestation of his sentiments, was the acknowledgement of a superintending provi∣dence, preparing, regulating and governing all human events for the accomplishment of its eternal purposes, and predisposing the instruments, by which they are to be effected. Religion and observation had taught him, that God's provident wisdom <HI>reacheth from end to end mightily, and disposeth all things sweetly.</HI> Wis. ch. 8. He contemplated with Christian piety, and the philosophy of a Sage, the most remarkable revo∣lutions and occurrencies of former, as well as his own
<PB N="6" REF="037108_0005_100D8B959B0F2B78"/>
times; and learned there from to refer every human event to the moral government of a supreme intel∣ligent Being. This became the polar star, by which he was guided in his progress through life, and in all his anxious solicitude for maintaining the liberty, perfecting the policy, preserving the peace, insuring the stability of his country on the foundations of or∣der and morality, and guarding it against the turbu∣lence of faction, licentiousness, foreign hostility and artifice.</P>
<P>This virtuous maxim of religious, moral, and political wisdom, so deeply impressed him, never perhaps was more illustrated, than by the course of providence in preparing and adapting his body and mind to suit the destinies of his life. He was to be himself a most luminous proof of that truth, which was so rooted in his soul.</P>
<P>That infinite knowledge, which in its compre∣hensive range through the whole extent of creation, embraces the future, no less distinctly, than past and present contingencies, beheld the period approaching, when this vast portion of America, now constituting the U. States; this country spread through so many climates; so diversified in its productions; so abun∣dant in natural resources; so benefited by land and water; so admirably calculated for the employment of industry, and for affording subsistance to millions and millions, was to break the bonds of its antient connection with G. Britain, and, emancipated from
<PB N="7" REF="037108_0006_100D8B98825A2C40"/>
vassalage, elevate itself to the station of a great, powerful and independent Empire!</P>
<P>A convulsion so violent in the political system of Europe and America, involved the demolition of deeply rooted habits and opinions. The associations arising out of consanguinity, habitual intercourse, uni∣ty of government, identity of laws, language and re∣ligion were to be melted down, before that wonder∣ful revolution could be compleated. A new people, unconscious before of their own strength, were to feel in their physical and moral energies the ripeness of manhood. Accustomed to respect the nation, with which they would have to contend, as irresistible in arms, and inexhaustible in resources, they must dare nevertheless to make the vigorous effort, and conceive a reliance on their own native strength. Powerful in∣terests, the necessary effects of long established govern∣ment, would naturally counteract every tendency to∣wards its downfall; but these interests were to be resist∣ed by force, and borne down by the enthusiastic ardor of patriotism.</P>
<P>To superintend the movements, and operations of such a revolution; to controul, during its progress, jealousies, enmities, suspicions, and other conflicting passions; and from their collision, to educe national and individual prosperity, peace, order, liberty and regular government; required the discernment and masterly contrivance of that Supreme Director and Artist, who unites together the links, and holds in his hands the chain of all human events. Contem∣plating,
<PB N="8" REF="037108_0007_100D8B9A161DC228"/>
as much as is allowed to feeble mortals, his divine agency in preparing the means and conducting the progress of the American revolution, we may presume to say, that heaven impressed a character on the life of Washington, and a temper on his soul, which eminently qualified him to bear the most con∣spicuous part, and be its principal instrument in ac∣complishing this stupendous work.</P>
<P>We trace as far back, as to his early youth, the evidences of this providential interposition. Born in times, and circumstances, unfavourable to the spi∣rit and exertions of bold enterprise, he however soon devoted himself to useful and active exercises. He disdained the inglorious ease, and ignoble pursuits, which fettered, or perverted the talents of his young countrymen; unactive, not thro' choice, but want∣ing objects and encouragement. To deliver Wash∣ington from the danger of contracting similar habits, he was inspired to embrace the hardy discipline of difficult and perilous labours, which added vigour to his constitution, and a robustness to his nerves, that never after shrunk from danger. Following the instinct of his towering genius, he had not reached the years of manhood, when he was engaged in enterprises pregnant with terror, and presenting to his view ob∣jects of a most formidable aspect. He did not howe∣ver enter on them with thoughtless temerity. At that early period he began, what he presisted in thro' life, to associate motives of public utility with mag∣nanimous undertakings. The usual occupations of
<PB N="9" REF="037108_0008_100D8B9C04056B40"/>
his young countrymen were not a sufficient employ∣ment for his active mind: he therefore turned his views towards that vast Western region, now so fami∣liar to our ears and acquaintance, but then known only by the terrors it inspired, and the cruelties practiced by the savage Indians, lurking in its forests and recesses. He left the endearments of society to explore the courses of rivers, to traverse plains and mountains far beyond the then inhabited frontiers; hoping to discover sources, whence future opulence might flow to his country; to examine the producti∣ons, and estimate the fertility of immense tracts, ca∣pable of rewarding the industry of thousands, pining in want and oppression in foreign lands; whose de∣scendants might people the wilderness, beautify it by cultivation, and multiply the resources of his native province. In these atchievements, the heroic youth was to inure himself to hunger and thirst; to lie on the damp earth without any covering, but the spread∣ing branches of the oak, and the canopy of the heav∣ens; to accustom himself to the vicissitudes of seasons, the parching heat, and chilling frost; to herd with the beasts of the forest; to be exposed to the toma∣hawk and scalping knife; to be surrounded by diffi∣culties, yet never be disheartened; to meet at every step the image of death, without ever being appalled, or admitting a momentary sentiment of despair.</P>
<P>Imagine not my fellow citizens, that this is an ideal and fanciful representation of Washington's
<PB N="10" REF="037108_0009_100D8BA4739C1110"/>
youthful years. No: it is faintly, but truly copied from real scenes of his life. Who, on the wing of imagination, has followed him, clambering over the lofty Western mountains, fording unfathomed and rapid rivers, exposing his invaluable life to innume∣rable accidents of treachery and hostility, without shuddering for his existence, and admiring his cool, collected courage, in conquering obstacles, and sur∣mounting danger? Such was the training and educa∣tion, by which Providence prepared him for the ful∣fillment of his future destinies.</P>
<P>Far different from his, were the motives, which urged the youth of Sparta and Rome to encounter toils of danger and opposition. They obeyed the in∣stitutions of their country; they were stimulated by the goad of aspiring ambition, and a desire of acquir∣ing that false glory, which, in the erroneous opini∣ons of their cotemporaries, attached itself to the men, who carried devastation and carnage into the bowels of neighbouring nations. With better views, and supe∣rior courage, Washington penetrated into the inhos∣pitable confines of the savage Indian; that he might render them the abodes of peace, and introduce into their bosom the improvements of civilization. So successfully the guardian angel of this chosen Youth, ministring to the designs of Providence, had infused already into his soul the sweet spirit of benevolence, together with heroical fortitude.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="037108_0010_100D8BA60A4FA218"/>For him it was decreed, in the progression of his life, to defend, and ultimately to establish, by just and necessary warfare, the liberties of his country. Providence therefore permitted a train of occurrences to ensue, which served to furnish his mind with the first rudiments of military science, and discipline him to the vigilance and profession of a soldier. At that time, two powerful European nations held North America in their subjection: their territories border∣ed on each other, and each claimed rights, disallowed by its rival power. One of them, France, sent out a military force and her Indian allies, to occupy posts, deemed to be within the territory of Virginia, and contiguous to the stations, selected by Washington, as best adapted to the protection of his native land: for his intrepidity and local knowledge had already plac∣ed him at the head of a small body of his countrymen, collected together to stop the progress of the Invaders. With those he covered the inhabitants from hostile encroachment; he won the confidence of the savage Indian; and conducted a dangerous and intricate ne∣gociation for a suspension of hostilities.</P>
<P>But the durable preservation of peace depended not on the counsels of America. England and France transported their enmity to her shores, and covered our country with hostile array. England, confident of her prowess and the discipline of her armies, would not commit the defence of her interests to raw Pro∣vincials. Washington's ardent soul suffered him not to remain behind in safety, while the security of his
<PB N="12" REF="037108_0011_100D8BA79DEC6298"/>
country was at stake. The hand of Providence lead him forward, that he might add to his experience and native fortitude. He fought under Braddock; and that ill-fated commander having paid by his death the tribute of his rashness; his army dispirited by defeat, and flying before an enemy flushed with victory; Washington in that perilous moment, gathered round him his first companions in arms, and rescued out of the jaws of death the remains of the vanquished bat∣tallions. He did more: he stood in the front of dan∣ger, and every where opposing himself to the merci∣less savages, ready to burst as a dark cloud, fraught with the thunderbolts of heaven, on a terrified land, he averted the storm, and restored to his trembling country the serenity of hope, and peace.</P>
<P>The theatre of war was transported afterwards to distant provinces of America. Then the same all-wise Providence, which had inured him to danger, prepared him for the toils of government, and the im∣portant duty of superintending, in his riper years, the political administration of a great and widely ex∣tended people. His services in the field had won the confidence of his fellow citizens; they committed to his vigilance and integrity their highest interests in their legislative assembly. In this school he perfected himself in the knowledge of mankind: he observed the contentions of parties, the artifices and conflicts of human passions: he saw the necessity of curbing them by salutary restraints: he studied the complicat∣ed science of legislation: he learned to venerate the
<PB N="13" REF="037108_0012_100D8BABF3388C80"/>
sanctity of laws, to esteem them as the palladium of civil society, and deeply inbibed this maxim, so im∣portant for the Soldier and the Statesman, and which he ever after made the rule of his conduct, that the armed defenders of their country would break up the foundations of social order and happiness, if they availed themselves of the turbulence of war, to violate the rights of private property, and personal liberty.</P>
<P>Thus Washington, during the interval of peace, stored his mind with the treasures of political wisdom. The time was approaching for him to expend those treasures on his country's welfare.</P>
<P>I need not recapitulate the origin of the discon∣tents between G. Britain, and her American depen∣dencies. Suffice it to say, that America viewed the claims of the parent country, as incompatible with her freedom and happiness. The great soul of Wash∣ington revolted at the idea of national degradation; but tempering his ardor with deliberate wisdom, he associated with other Sages of his country, to meditate on her new and critical situation.</P>
<P>Here let us pause, fellow citizens, to contemplate this exalted man, revolving in his breast the natural and social rights of human kind; comparing these with actual and impending grievances, and with the obli∣gations of an allegiance due to a long established go∣vernment. Had lawless ambition reigned in his breast, he would have decided the public voice for immedi∣ate hostility. But in this point also, Providence des∣tined
<PB N="14" REF="037108_0013_100D8BAD8C581090"/>
him to leave a memorable and salutary example, He was not dazzled by the prospect of being elevated to the chief command of the military force of America. In his opinion, nothing could justify a recurrence to the sword, and a revolt from established authority, but extreme necessity. All reasonable means of re∣dress should be tried, before a good citizen will dissolve the fabric of government, and expose a people to the convulsive shocks of a revolution, the explosions of which no considerate man can promise himself to re∣gulate, or foresee their termination.</P>
<P>A reflection here forces itself upon my mind, which I ought not to withold from my respectable au∣ditors. Would to God, that the principal authors and leaders of the many revolutions, through which unhappy France has passed in the course of a few years, would to God, that they had been influenced by a morality as pure and enlightened, as that of Washington, and his associates in the first Congress! What scenes of carnage and cruelty! what private woes and public calamity would have been spared to that ill-fated country? and how sacred and venera∣ble would have still remained to it the sanctuary of religion?</P>
<P>Washington and his colleagues obeying at the same time the dictates of patriotism, and the duty of allegiance, represented their wrongs to their Sovereign, and claimed their rights. On the event of their re∣monstrance, depended the redress of their grievances; or, if no redress followed, their justification for stand∣ing
<PB N="15" REF="037108_0014_100D8BB010A60A08"/>
on their defence. Britain would not relent, and all, that remained to America, was submission, or resistance. The election was soon made; every one prepared himself for the awful contest, and all eyes and hopes were turned towards Washington. With universal approbation he was summoned to place himself in the front of danger, and assume su∣preme military command. The possession of such a citizen, at a moment so critical, was an invaluable treasure, and an animating presage of the favourable issue of the great contest.</P>
<P>But far other thoughts absorbed his attention. Modest, as he was eminent in valour and wisdom, he contemplated with mingled emotions of self-diffi∣dence, and generous resolution, the important stake placed in his hands; the subjection or independence; the vassalage or freedom of an immense territory, destined to be the habitation of countless millions. When therefore, in obedience to the voice of his country, he placed himself at the head of her army, the expressions of his dependence on Providence should never be forgotten. Claiming no personal merit, apprehensive of injuring the public interest through some misconduct; yet trusting to the justice of his cause, and conscious of the purity of his mo∣tives, he called upon his fellow citizens to remem∣ber, that he depended for success, not on his own military skill, but on the God of battles, to whom he made his solemn appeal.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="037108_0015_100D8BB1D5C593F0"/>Washington, now at a period of his highest ele∣vation, drew on him the attention, not only of this Western Continent; but of every European nation. O fellow citizens! what days and years of anxious disquietude revolved over us, whilst we gazed on this splendid luminary, uncertain whether it would shed on its country the effulgence of victory and peace, crowned by liberty; or whether its brightness would be shadowed by the clouds of disaster and de∣feat?</P>
<P>Here language fails: I dare not, I cannot follow the heroic Washington in the career of his military glory. To baffle the stratagems of the ablest Gene∣rals, to repel the onset of the bravest, and best disci∣plined armies, what had America to place in his hands? neither soldiers trained to arms, or accustomed to sub∣ordination; nor the implements of war, nor the trea∣sures to purchase them. But the genius of the com∣mander finally supplied every deficiency. He intro∣duced order and discipline; inspired love and confi∣dence; and with these auxiliaries, he kept together uncloathed and unpaid armies, which, under other generals, would perhaps have demanded justice at the point of their bayonets. Always vigilant to foil hos∣tile attempts, he exhausted the resources of the enemy, without suffering them to force him to action. Ten∣der of the blood of his fellow soldiers, and never ex∣posing their lives without cause, or prospect of advan∣tage, humanity was as dear to him, as victory; as his enemies, that fell into his power, always experienced.
<PB N="17" REF="037108_0016_100D8BB6878F9BA0"/>
When a decree of retaliation became necessary to re∣strain their licentious excesses, with what delicacy, without the least abatement of fortitude, did he save the life of the victim, devoted to atone for the cruelty, that had been committed on an American officer? not however till he had compelled the opposing General to restrain and disavow outrages, that aggravate so much the necessary evils of war. How sacred was his respect to the civil authority; how effectual his pro∣tection of the property of his fellow citizens? When the generous feelings of the virtuous and beneficient Lewis, whose deplorable fate should draw tears of blood from every American heart, sent out his Nobles, and legions, to combat by his side, the dignity of his man∣ners and his unassuming merit won their entire con∣fidence: His integrity, and conciliating spirit united, as a band of Brothers, nations before unknown to each other, and totally different in manners, habits and religion. Their union, of which he was the soul, was a new omen of victory, and gained for America the prize, for which she bled and contended; honour∣able peace and Independence.</P>
<P>What but unfading laurels remained now for Washington, after satisfying his honest ambition, and steering the vessel of the American republic, through so many storms, into the safe harbour of liberty and tranquillity? It remained for him to leave this impor∣tant lesson to the chiefs of armies, vested with great commands; that magnanimity and true glory consist in laying down their swords at their country's seet, when the object is attained, for which alone it was permitted to draw them. It remained for him, after
<PB N="18" REF="037108_0017_100D8BB8E71831A8"/>
abdicating public employments, to exhibit in the shade of retirement those private virtues, which are the true foundations of national prosperity. Dutiful to this moral principle, Washington, before he left his army, stipulated for no personal reward, and even refused all that could be offered: Unmindful of himself, he was only sollicitous to obtain for his faithful legions a generous and liberal acknowledgment of their con∣stancy and valour. This being effected, as far as it depended on him, he resigned the insignia of his com∣mand to those, from whom he had received it, and re∣sumed the rank of a private citizen, carrying with him into his domestic retreat, the esteem, respect and veneration of an admiring world.</P>
<P>Here the curtain drops, and seems to close for ever from the public eye and public duty this wonder∣ful man. His country has no more right to disturb his calm repose: He has paid superabundantly her claim to his services. But the views of providence over him are not yet compleated: Peace and indepen∣dence are obtained; but to preserve them, experience soon made it manifest, that to invigorate with one spirit the vast mass of population throughout the U: States one general superintending government was essentially requisite, which saving the rights of all, should likewise be competent to command the servi∣ces of all for the public weal; to maintain order with∣in, and repel aggression from abroad; inforce the de∣mands of justice, and diffuse over important national acts, dignity, energy, unity of design and execution. Washington's penetration soon discovered the want of such a government, &amp; in a paternal, affectionate address to his countrymen, had bequeathed on them, as a lega∣cy,
<PB N="19" REF="037108_0018_100D8BBA83976B18"/>
his earnest recommendation for its establishment.</P>
<P>Various causes delayed the execution of this ne∣cessary work, till the edifice of American indepen∣dance, unsupported by its necessary pillars, was crumbling into ruin. Then every friend to his coun∣try remembered Washington's fatherly advice; eve∣ry patriotic hand was ready to prop up the tottering fabric. Wisdom and experience combined to blend in a republican form of government all the advanta∣ges, of which other forms are productive, without many of their evils. Our illustrious Deliverer pre∣sided at the deliberations, which produced it: The American people besought him once more to quit his beloved retreat, and perfect a work, of which he had been the first founder and a principal architect. The earnestness of their request overpowered his re∣luctant mind; he could not resist their unanimous wishes, nor could any personal dangers stand in com∣petition with the advancement of general happiness. Yet how immense were his sacrifices! how perilous his hazards! Sacrifices known only to them, who having spent their best years in transactions, that kept every nerve on the stretch, are permitted in the evening of their days to taste of the calm repose of rural felicity, and the solace of domestic endearments. Disheartening was the prospect in venturing again on the agitated ocean of national responsibility. There ex∣isted not in the world a name so bright as his: no charac∣ter stood on such lofty preeminence. Shall he expose these to the capricious fluctuations of popular opinion? Shall he embark, the treasure of a reputation purcha∣sed by so many services, on a sea, sown thick with rocks of envy, pride and disappointment? These were suffi∣cient
<PB N="20" REF="037108_0019_100D8BBC998639B8"/>
to appall a heart less sublime, and less inflamed with genuine patriotism. But such considerations had no effect on him, and he took into his hands the helm of the State.</P>
<P>What were the effects of his administration? are we not deceived by magical delusion? or is the trans∣formation, which our senses witness, really effected? Have the U. States risen from a lethagic, impoveri∣shed, degraded condition to activity, opulence and respect? Does the farmer receive a generous retri∣bution for his industry? does the merchant cover the seas with his ships, conveying to every clime the pro∣ductions of our native soil? does the public creditor obtain security and payment for his generous reliance on national faith? does justice dispense her equitable awards to every suitor approaching her sanctuary? do distant nations respect the counsels, and sollicit the friendship of the U. States? are the natives of every land wafted to our shores, as to the refuge of peace, the residence of true liberty? Yes, fellow citizens, this is not delusion. These are the real effects and monuments of Washington's administration. Yet it was thwarted and embarrassed by internal opposition, and foreign intrigue. Scarce had we tasted of the sweets of peace, enlivened by industry and commerce, when attempts were made to ravish from us these in∣estimable blessings, and plunge us into the horrors of war: not only of war, but of a war of that kind, which connecting our interests and fate with that of a coun∣try, delivered up to anarchy, and a prey to frantic, outrageous passions, would have tended to extinguish amongst us the principles of morality; inflame us with the rage of innovation; intoxicate us with delusive,
<PB N="21" REF="037108_0020_100D8BBF722D5640"/>
ruinous theories of government; and most probably, would have substituted them to that excellent consti∣tution, which is, and may it long continue to be! our pride and happiness. But, thanks to thy immortal spirit, O ever dear and venerable Father of thy coun∣try! thy wisdom discerned the approaching storm, and thy firmness baffled its violence. Our peace and constitution remain to us, unimpaired. No foreign influence dictated to the counsels of America. She increased in vigour; she rose in character; and by self-government, by keeping herself disentangled from the strifes of contending nations, she evinced herself worthy of her independence.</P>
<P>After settling his country in this desirable state, Washington had fulfilled the destinies of that provi∣dence, which formed him for the exalted purpose of diffusing the choicest blessings over millions of men, and preparing the same for millions yet unborn. His wish to bury himself again in the shades of retirement returned on him with redoubled force; to hide, if possible, his greatness from the world; and in the sweet repose of domestic life, diversified however by useful and honourable occupations, to forget his past glory. The last act of his supreme magistracy was to inculcate in most impressive language on his country∣men, or rather on his dearest children, this, his deli∣berate and solemn advice; to bear incessantly in their minds, that nations and individuals are under the moral government of an infinitely wise and just pro∣vidence; that the foundations of their happiness are morality and religion; and their union amongst them∣selves their rock of safety: that to venerate their con∣stitution and its laws is to insure their liberty. Then
<PB N="22" REF="037108_0021_100D8BC3C15439A8"/>
he took his tender farewell of public employments, devoting the remainder of his precious life to a com∣mendable self-review of it, through all its vicissitudes and agitations; a review, for which every wise man, knowing his accountability to a sovereign Judge, should allot time and make opportunity.</P>
<P>After endeavouring thus far to satisfy our com∣mon duty to our illustrious Deliverer, before I con∣clude, I am earnest, my fellow citizens, to leave im∣pressed on you, in strong characters, some principal features of his mind, and furnish you with short me∣morials of his most remarkable actions, hoping there∣by to perpetuate your gratitude, and incite you to emulate his virtues. Happily, to supply my inabili∣ty, I find this task executed, as it would seem, by the spirit of prophecy, and in the language of inspira∣tion, in the 8th chapter of the book of <HI>Wisdom</HI>; where the author's expressions need no comment to appro∣priate them to Washington. So striking the resem∣blance! so true is the picture! Here are the words of the inspired writer: <Q>I purposed, says he, to take wisdom with me to live with me, knowing that she will communicate with me of her good things, and will be a comfort in my care—for her sake I shall have glory among the multitude, and honour with the antient, though I am young; and—I shall be admired in the sight of the mighty, and the faces of princes shall wonder at me.—By the means of her, I shall have immortality, and shall leave behind me an everlasting memory to them, that come after me. I shall set the people in order, and nations shall be subject to me. Terrible kings hearing shall be afraid of me; among the multitude I shall be found

good and valiant in war. When I go into my house, I shall repose myself with her; for her conversation hath no bitterness, nor her company any tedious∣ness, but joy and gladness. Thinking these things with myself, and pondering them in my heart, that to be allied to wisdom, is immortality.—I went a∣bout seeking, that I might take her to myself.</Q></P>
<P>In this picture, every stroke of the pencil exhi∣bits traits of Washington. The early maturity of his judgment was the fruit of his youthful conferences with wisdom. She initiated him into her counsels, and procured for him love, respect, honour, confidence, authority and command: She enabled him to <HI>set the people in order</HI> by good government, and an impartial, disinterested administration of it; and when, all pub∣lic duties fulfilled, he <HI>went to his house</HI> to repose him∣self, <HI>no tediousness</HI> or <HI>bitterness</HI> mingled themselves in their conversation, but <HI>joy and gladness,</HI> serenity of mind, and the pleasing prospect of conscious inte∣grity.</P>
<P>Providence having preserved and lengthened his days, that he might rear up his country in the infan∣cy of her independence, suffered him now to withdraw himself from the disquietudes of government. He had infused the spirit of his administration into all its departments. His excellent Successor inherited, not only the mantle of his office, but his wisdom, firm∣ness, and love of peace, subordinate only to a determi∣nation of never purchasing it, at the price of national dishonour.</P>

We flattered ourselves with the expectation of his continuing long to retain them: Joy beamed in our hearts, when on every annual revolution, we gratefully hailed this, his auspicious birthday. But, alas! how dark is the cloud, that now overshadows it? The songs of festi∣vity converted into the throbs of mourning! The prayers of thanksgiving for his health and life chang∣ed into lamentations for his death! Who feels not for him, as for his dearest friend, his protector, and his Father? Whilst he lived, we seemed to stand on loftier ground, for breathing the same air, inhabiting the same country, and enjoying the same constitution and laws, as the sublime and magnanimous Washing∣ton. He was invested with a glory, that shed a lustre on all around him. For his country's safety, he often had braved death, when clad in her most terrific form: he had familiarised himself with her aspect; at her approaching to cut the thread of his life, he behold her with constancy and serenity; and with his last breath, as we may believe from knowing the ruling passion of his soul, he called to heaven to save his coun∣try, and recommended it to the continual protection of that Providence, which he so reverently adored. May his prayer have been heared! May these United States flourish in pure and undefiled religion, in mo∣rality, peace, union, liberty and the enjoyment of their excellent Constitution, as long as respect, ho∣nour, and veneration shall gather round the name of Washington; that is, whilst there shall be any surviv∣ing record of human events.</P>
