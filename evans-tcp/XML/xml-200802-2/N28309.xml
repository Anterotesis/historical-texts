</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHILE the tears of United America, are flowing for the fall of our illustrious Chief, the beloved <HI>Washington,</HI> we are called upon, My Friends to mingle our own in the general <HI>stream.</HI>—O America! thou hast felt the stroke of the Almighty—thou hast suffered an eclipse—thy <HI>stars</HI> are still permitted to shine; but a por∣tion of thy glory; <HI>one</HI> of thy brightest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> shrouded in darkness.—Now, while grief <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> thy countenance, and the instruments of music hang on the willows—while thou clothest thy∣self with the cypress, and tears trickle down thy cheeks, remember thy GOD liveth—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e com∣forted in this; for he shall be thy Guardian and Defence. Let thy trust be in him, and thy fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> shall not triumph over thee. Let thy trust be in him, and he shall be as a wall of fire round about thee, and a glory in the midst of thee. Let thy trust be in him, and he shall raise up o∣ther deliverers, who shall watch over thy inter∣ests, and defend them, till the <HI>world</HI> shall be hushed into peace: and the whole family of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> embrace each other as brethren, and dwell <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> universal love and harmony—</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="037734_0005_1011C3E0DDD4A090"/>
But while the providence of GOD, calls us to mingle our tears with our afflicted c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>try, it may be highly useful to consider in the</P>
<P>FIRST PLACE, That in concordance with our text, we are prompted to this duty by the ex∣amples of GOD's children on similar occasions—as well as by the contemplation of our loss; whether we consider it in the light of an expe∣rienced Commander, noble Patriot, enlightened Politician, or worthy Citizen—</P>
<P>But previously to mentioning the obligations to the duty before us, it may be necessary to no∣tice, that while we indulge the natural feelings of grief, for the loss of an eminent Friend and Benefactor, these feelings are to be regulated by an holy sorrow for <HI>sin,</HI> which is the real ground of all our calamities. While our natural pas∣sions are under the control and absorbed by a godly sorrow for sin, we may be said to comply with the duty of mourning with those that mourn, and weeping with those that weep—or the religious sorrow of this day. This kind of mourning is all which can render true honor to the dead—mend our own souls—or meet the di∣vine approbation.—The obligations to this duty shall now be hinted,</P>
<P>First—From the examples of GOD's children on similar occasions—</P>
<P>When the high Priest of GOD's ancient Church, fell a victim to the stroke of death up∣on mount Hor, all Israel grieved and lamented <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him. It is said, "When all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, <HI>they mourned for him thirty days."</HI> This great and good man, having
<PB N="7" REF="037734_0006_1011C3EB68552260"/>
repeatedly saved the lives of his brethren from immediate death, and being constituted the me∣dium though whom their public prayers ascend∣ed to GOD, became greatly esteemed and belov∣ed—On his removal, the heart of every Israelite melted with gratitude, at the remembrance of his services—and the tender ties of nature and friendship bled in lengthy streams when they were separated—</P>
<P>In like manner when the Mighty Law-giver resigned his breath, on Pisgah's top, it is written, "All the children of Israel wept for him thirty days."—By this universal expression of grief, they manifested that they remembered, that <HI>Mo∣ses was the man,</HI> who in the face of death, in every terrific form, delivered them from the iron furnace—their bitter slavery in Egypt—who led them through the mighty deep on dry land; and gave them to triumph over their haughty foes—who endured, and hushed their murmurings in the wilderness—ascended the fla∣ming mount, and delivered them the law—Who fed them with angel's food, and gave them water from the rock—Whose intercessions a multitude of times warded off the stroke of vengeance from their guilty heads—and whose hand had conduc∣ted them to the verge of their temporal Para∣dise.—But now, the mighty Moses is no more! How distressing the thought, to those who knew his worth, and shared his kindnesses! <HI>They Wept</HI>—Their deep and lengthy sorrow, proved how much they loved him—how much they respected him—how grateful they felt for what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had done—and how wide was the breach in his re∣moval. And all this naturally led them, to their
<PB N="8" REF="037734_0007_1011C3ECF0247680"/>
own ill desert of such an eminent blessing, and to that godly sorrow for sin, which in its con∣sequences might excite them to imitate their il∣lustrious Benefactor, and hereby honor him for∣ever—</P>
<P>To pass many instances; the lamentation instituted at the death of Saul and Jonathan is very impressive. David, the man after GOD's own heart, composed a sacred elegy to be sung in their solemn humiliations before GOD on this occasion. They fasted seven days, and lament∣ed as in our context—"The beauty of Israel is slain upon the high places: how are the mighty fallen! Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; left the daughters of the Phi∣listines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncir∣cumcised triumph.—Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain upon you, nor fields of offering: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil. From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not emp∣ty. Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than Eagles, they were stronger than lions. Ye daughters of Isra∣el weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of Gold upon your apparel. How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle: O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thy high places. I am distres∣sed for thee my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was
<PB N="9" REF="037734_0008_1011C3F2C20C0858"/>
wonderful, passing the love of women—How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!!"</P>
<P>In this divine elegy, as well as in the exam∣ples already brought, we are taught the strict pro∣priety which there is, in a people's uniting in manifesting their heartfelt sorrow, at the fall of their greatest temporal Benefactors.—Saul and Jonathan, were princes over Israel; the former was the Lord's anointed and King in Jeshurun—These men possessed commendable qualities in their high stations—But now, when all their glo∣ry is stained by death: and all their ensigns of honor buried in the dust of humiliation—pity, tenderness, gratitude and friendship, all spring up at once, in the people's breasts and they mourn over them.—They dwell with the softest com∣passion on every commendable deed or accom∣plishment they possessed.—Ye daughters of Israel weep over Saul, who <HI>clothed you in scarlet and other delights, who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel</HI>—How are the mighty fallen! Their valour and heroism are mentioned—<HI>From the blood of the slain, the bow of Jonathan retur∣ned not back: and the sword of Saul returned not empty.</HI> Likewise their agility of body—<HI>They were swifter than Eagles; they were stron∣ger than Lions.</HI> Their pleasant society as com∣panions—<HI>They were lovely and pleasant in their lives.</HI> But when they speak of their deaths, the scene is too tender for expression—the very ground is forbid to receive its natural refresh∣ment, and the spot where they fell, condemned to perpetual barrenness—<HI>Ye mountains of Gil∣boa Let there be no dew, neither rain upon you,
<PB N="10" REF="037734_0009_1011C3F6DE5E98E0"/>
nor fields of offerings: for there the shields of the mighty were vilely cast away</HI>—That is, Let the very ground mourn to all generations; for there the strength and glory of man perished. Finally, The calamity was too affecting to be touched by the profane bands of the wicked, or told where enemies might rejoice and triumph. <HI>Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</HI>—These expressions of sorrow, very forcibly evince how tenderly affected the people of GOD have been, at the decease of their temporal sovereigns, who have in any degree merited their affec∣tions—</P>
<P>But one instance more shall be mentioned—It is recorded, that when the great and good Prince Josiah fell, "he was buried in one of the sepul∣chres of his Fathers, and all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah. And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to this day—and made them an ordinance in Israel and behold they are written in the lamenta∣tions." This mourning was so exceedingly deep and affecting, that ever afterward it was prover∣bial. It is observed by the Prophet Zechariah, speaking of a time of affliction; "That in that day, there shall be in Jerusalem a great mourning as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Mag∣iddon"—This was the time and place were Josi∣ah was slain.—All the millions of Judah wept with a sore lamentation—Jeremiah composed an elegy upon his death: and all the singing men, and singing women spake of Josiah, and told of
<PB N="11" REF="037734_0010_1011C3FC6637EF80"/>
his goodness in their lamentations to this day—that is, till their nation was broken up and dis∣persed. And they ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> them a new ordinance in Israel to remember and perpetuate his vir∣tues. In addition to this it may be remarked, that the people of GOD instituted a register, in which were recorded the elegies and lamenta∣tions which were made upon the deaths of good men. These several instances, selected from a multitude, unite in placing before us the exam∣ples of GOD's children, and demonstrate the du∣ty and perfect propriety there is, in a people's unitedly expressing the grief they feel upon the decease of their greatest temporal benefactors and princes—That hereby they may express their affection by pouring their tears upon their graves—call up into lively remembrance their virtues for imitation—attend to the voice of GOD in their removal—and prepare to follow them—</P>
<P>But my Friends, We did not need the exam∣ples of primitive saints to prompt us to a reluc∣tant duty: but only to give us liberty to vent the sorrows we feel when the <HI>Death of a Wash∣ington swells our breasts.</HI> But pause a moment! Is Washington <HI>Dead!! He certainly is—Ameri∣ca has felt the shock—the report has reached the Heavens, and murmurs through the universe</HI>—How is the Mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!!</P>
<P>While the dark cloud of affliction hangs over our country, by the fall of its brightest lumina∣ry; <HI>and shrouded as we are</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">The house of worship being dressed in full mourn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></NOTE> with the ensigns of
<PB N="12" REF="037734_0011_1011C3FDF0B7F068"/>
mourning; can there any thing be more natural than to contemplate a few particulars in Justice to the memory of him whom we lament, and</P>
<P>First—We cannot but remember the time when the chains of slavery were forged and shook over us by the cruel and haughty hand of our Mother country—at this moment every heart meditated terror. But the Lord of Hosts inspir∣ed us as a people to rise up boldly and repel the bondage—By one mighty effort of manly resolu∣tion we were born anew, and Declared our IN∣DEPENDENCE. Now commenced the bloody▪ contest for every thing we held dear—The same Almighty Being, by whose guidance we were hitherto conducted, beheld us with compassion, and saw what we needed; a PILOT, a LEAD∣ER in the perilious enterprize we had undertak∣en—He called for his Washington already pre∣pared; anointed him as his servant with regal dignity, and put into his hands, the control of all our defensive operations. But here admiration suppresses utterance—Your own minds must fill out the active character of the man—A descrip∣tion of the warlike skill—the profound wisdom—the prudence—the heroism—and integrity which he displayed, in character of Commander in Chief, would suffer materially in hands like mine. But this I may say, the eyes of all our A∣merican Israel were placed upon him, as their Saviour, under the direction of Heaven—and they were not disappointed—He endured the mighty conflict for a long series of years—He faced death in ten thousand forms—the Lord preserved him—He persevered—He conquered—He made us FREE—This was the mighty Wash∣ington
<PB N="13" REF="037734_0012_1011C403579A9E28"/>
—raised by the God of Armies to be the <HI>Father and Protector of his Country—a Defence of rational Liberty—and a Friend of Man.</HI> At the risk of his own blood, he purchased all we hold dear, "with his <HI>Sword</HI> and with his <HI>Bow"</HI>—But where is he now! Pale death has disrobed him of all his outward beauty—his armor, and manly accomplishments, and laid him in the si∣lent dust!! Saith the Scriptures "I have said ye are Gods but ye shall die like men, and fall as one of the Princes"—O how are the mighty fallen and the weapons of war perished!—Ye <HI>Daughters</HI> of America weep over Washington, who clothed you with <HI>Freedom</HI> and other de∣lights—who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel—</P>
<P>But again, The tender and afflicted mind roves back, to view its object in brighter scenes—When the man who had earned the love and esteem of every American <HI>and the world,</HI> return∣ed from the great theatre of action; clothed with the laurels of victory and triumph; the next thing which strikes our admiration is, <HI>His Great Soul conquered Himself!</HI>—In stead of im∣proving his successes to exalt and aggrandize his own person and name like other conquerors, he appeared before the grand Council of the nation—acknowledged all his successes and glory, to be ascribed to GOD; put up his earnest prayer for his dearest country and all to whom its in∣terests were intrusted—resigned his commission and took his leave of all public life. This act so far demonstrated the disinterestedness of his views, in the immense services he had rendered his country, that it could hardly be thought to be the conduct of a mortal man. The affections
<PB N="14" REF="037734_0013_1011C40A6E0B5698"/>
of the people glowed on him more than ever, and the world stood astonished!—</P>
<P>But the Lord of Hosts had services for him still. While our political body was in its in∣fancy, and its limbs unnerved by any civil com∣pact, and almost severed by her late conflict; a council is called to form a band of political Un∣ion and Government—Into this august <HI>Conven∣tion,</HI> Washington is invited, and presides—A Constitution is formed—It is accepted by the States—A seat in the government presiding over the whole, is to be filled. Now United Ameri∣ca, have an opportunity of testifying their con∣fidence in the man they love—They erred not, Washington again by the voice of GOD in the universal voice of the people is called from his retirement▪ and being placed, as the <HI>"Head of Gold"</HI> over these States, launched into operation, our happy political system. But here, be it re∣peated—Your imagination must supply the de∣ficiences I feel in giving the portrait of that Constellation of political virtues which irradiat∣ed his eminent station—which warmed and glad∣dened every heart of his brethren, and darted their beams to distant climes. Sufficient is it to say, <HI>No man uninspired</HI> could do better. His deep penetration—undeviating prudence and in∣vincible integrity cemented our general interest, and rebuked opposition. A testimony of the complete satisfaction which the people felt in his administration, appeared in a second election to the same important office. Thus seeming to take us by the hand and set us out in the enjoy∣ment of our dear bought privileges, confident of our safety, he resigned the helm of government
<PB N="15" REF="037734_0014_1011C411E0760B18"/>
and retired a second time to his own happy man∣sion. This was the mighty Washington who was lovely and pleasant in his life, and in his death triumphant!! In his delightful retire∣ment, he anticipated the evening of life, enjoying the calmness and serenity of a bright setting sun after a tempestuous day—But alas how short is human felicity. No sooner had he left his high station, than these States are coveted, as a boon by a perfidious ally—Secret intrigues, breach of faith, contempt and spoliations are practised upon us—We address Heaven, and seek an adjustment of difficulties—All efforts of this kind fail—To whom then must we look for re∣dress, but to a righteous GOD, and the experi∣enced sword of our <HI>victorious Chief?</HI>—Once more, impelled by the aggressions of our foes, by the love of his country, by the desire of his brethren, and the call of GOD; he accepts the Commission of Commander in Chief of the Ame∣rican forces. This last token of his love crown∣ed all the rest—Willing now to confirm all he had done before—willing to leave his earthly Paradise with all its sweets—put to risk his un∣sullied character, and spill his last drop of blood, if called, to serve his GOD and his dear coun∣try!!—This is the man whom we lament this day—Encircled with a cloud of human glory; peaceful and calm he meets the summons of his GOD, and sleeps in dust.—O Washington, let thy name be written with gold, and laid in the adamant for ever—Let unborn millions read, and pay their tribute to thy virtue—O may the children of America, to the latest ages, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thy name and call thee their Friend.—O Columbia, let thy present Sons and Daughters individually
<PB N="16" REF="037734_0015_1011C41718CD4DE0"/>
weep over thy Friend and say—We are distressed for thee O my brother, thy love to us was won∣derful!!!</P>
<P>But hark again—Imagination seems to hear the departing spirit of the Hero say—"Adieu Ye kindred <HI>Souls,</HI> who have shared with me the toils of war, and its trophies—Adieu Ye minis∣ters of Justice, whose counsels have adorned your stations, and blest your country—Adieu My Dear Brethren, the People of America—Fare∣well!!"</P>
<P>Let all rejoin, We thank thee, for all thy love and toil, Adieu My Brother!!—</P>
<P>Excited by motives like these, we cannot be wanting in the duty of this day to humble our∣selves before GOD—testify our high regard for our deceased Friend, and leave our tears on his grave—</P>
<P>Now he is gone, it remains that we make a sui∣table improvement of his exit—and</P>
<P>First—Looking round us we find a breach, a wide chasm in creation; especially in our own land which no man can fill. In this we learn the loss, we have sustained. Tell it not our Ene∣my, nor publish it in the streets of Infidels, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph. America never sustained so great a loss in a man. In this likewise we may see the displeasure of Heaven—One of our "strongest rods" is broken—our defence is so far weakened: Hence in the same proportion we are exposed to calamities from abroad. The very name of our late Com∣mander
<PB N="17" REF="037734_0016_1011C41AA7B3A688"/>
was of more use than an army of no small magnitude—</P>
<P>While we mourn the loss of so great a Bene∣factor, it becomes us to look inwardly, and view the sins of our own hearts and land; and con∣fess them before GOD with deep penitence and humiliation. This will prove that we eye the hand of GOD in this afflictive stroke—are dispos∣ed to glorify him in it, and cleave to him still—</P>
<P>Secondly—Being so sensibly struck with the loss of our Political Parent, let it excite us to put our trust in GOD more than ever. It would be infinitely criminal to lose sight of the <HI>Source</HI> of all our comforts, and expectations—It was the <HI>Lord of Hosts,</HI> who raised up our late Protec∣tor—gave him all his accomplishments and made him successful in all the enterprises he performed—The same Being who raised up Moses, Joshua, David, Cyrus and others. While we do honor to the man, and commend him for his public and private virtues, we are still to remember he was only GOD's instrument to do his work—The GOD of Israel girded him, supported him, and carried him through his momentous labors—We are obligated to bless and praise GOD infinitely more, than his instrument. But as GOD has raised up one Benefactor; Yea many; he can raise up others just when he pleas∣es—He can fill them with any degree of talents which his wisdom dictates, and make them even surpass their predecessors. To this source we are to look and pray, with the greatest sincerity for the bestowment of all temporal and spiritual
<PB N="18" REF="037734_0017_1011C41C2BF15038"/>
blessings. Trusting in GOD, we have nothing to fear—</P>
<P>Thirdly—If we would really honor the mighty subject of our lamentations we must go farther than outward ceremony. We must imitate him, in all things wherein he complied with the word of GOD—Could we now hear him addressing us from the world of spirits, what would he say? <HI>"Obey GOD"</HI> would be his language—"Love and serve him with all thy heart, and soul and strength and mind"—We are fond of thinking the gates of Heaven were set open, to receive his departing spirit: <HI>Be it so;</HI> In this case his exhor∣tation to his Friends here below, would be pre∣cisely <HI>the language of angels, or the word of GOD.</HI> Were he to speak with an audible voice and ex∣hort in the language of Paradise he would say, "Repent and believe in Christ: there is none o∣ther name given under Heaven whereby ye can be saved—Fly to the Lord Jesus, the captain of your salvation and take hold on eternal life. If you ever mean to be my company, you must <HI>become holy,</HI> for without holiness no man can see GOD—Break off your iniquities—fly from the wrath which is coming—make your calling and election sure—Serve GOD and your generation with your whole heart—And if you would honor me and mourn my absence, <HI>so live</HI> as to come and dwell where I am"—Now, if we would honor Him, in his death, who was so dear to us in life, let us hear his address from the Heavenly mansion, where we hope his spirit lives—Let us practice it; and this will prove we respect him, and hold him in everlasting remembrance—This will be joining in the religious sorrow of this day, and gain spiritual advantage to our souls.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="037734_0018_1011C420D7545210"/>
Fourthly—The event we contemplate teaches us, that Death, is our certain lot—If a Washing∣ington is dead—if the King of terrors would not be bribed when such a victim stood before him, then we must die—O Let the light and trifling, the busy and the gay, think of <HI>this,</HI> and feel that they are dead men—The devout know it already. But since this is our certain end, can there be a wiser course than to prepare for it? Do we wish for Heaven? Do we wish, when we close our eyes on earth, to be gathered with angels and saints, and all the honorable and mighty who have died in faith—if so, to devote our∣selves to the service of GOD will carry us thith∣er? But any other course will land us without end, with hypocrites and unbelievers.—Shall we lavish our praises on the righteous—mourn their deaths—accompany them with our wishes to Hea∣ven's gate, and yet by our daily practice prove we have no serious meaning in all this? Shall we look upon death just as certain, as our exist∣ence, yet make no preparation to meet it! O Let it not be—but let it be our sole business to acquire a temper of mind suited to the Heaven∣ly world, and to follow the footsteps of those who through faith and patience inherit the pro∣mises—Then, when the moment of dissolution arrives, the transition will be glorious, and the society we shall enter will be pure and delight∣some beyond all our present conceptions.—</P>
<P>Finally—This day, My Friends, finds a sable cloud spread over our whole country, and such gloomy vestments as never shadowed it before—and all this for the fall of one man, a fellow mor∣tal!—But how strikingly ought this to remind us
<PB N="20" REF="037734_0019_1011C424813EB9C0"/>
of that awful period; and what solemn ensigns of distress nature herself put on, when the SAV∣IOUR of men expired!—So great the Person∣age, so important his fall, <HI>the sun himself hid his face—the Temple rent—and nature groaned with convulsions!—Darkness shrouded the world and hung it in mourning!!</HI></P>
<P>This event called the attention of the uni∣verse, and was important beyond all imagina∣tion.—By it an atonement was made for sinners, by which through repentance and faith, they might be delivered from eternal misery, and re∣ceived to eternal felicity in Heaven—And now, shall we make such great "lamentation, mourn∣ing and woe" when a mortal like ourselves dies; and yet neglect to notice and celebrate the Death of Him, who conquered death, and purchased eternal life for his Friends!—Human nature, <HI>blush!</HI>—Angels, <HI>stand aghast!! But chief Thou whose love and goodness is thus neglected, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>de thy frown till thy pity reach us</HI>!—</P>
<P>Are we Friends to the great Washington? And are we no Friends to Christ!—Where is the proof of friendship to the latter? Do we in general celebrate his death? No—Do we expect eternal life from him—the purchase of his blood—Yet forbear to commemorate his death—remain <HI>un∣moved</HI> at his command <HI>do this in remembrance of me</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">The Sacrament was to be attended at the close of public service—</NOTE>—O my Friends, Think how the Saviour views the indignity cast upon him, when he sees the <HI>Dust of his feet</HI> preferred before him!—O may this thought beget conviction in every breast where the censure falls—Now is the only time

to correct the infinite error, and to honor Christ—His long suffering waits upon you: but it can∣not always wait—Seize the moment lest it be too late, and your misery be sealed—Remember Christ suffered not to put on ornaments of Gold upon your apparel: but the ornament of salva∣tion upon you: And if you are truly disposed to wear the garments he has prepared, and obey him; You will soon exchange these gloomy em∣blems of sin and death, for robes of righteous∣ness and crowns of eternal life.—You will now find comfort springing up in the midst of tempo∣ral sorrows—While you are called to mourn the loss of the most excellent of the earth, you will have a glorious prospect of soon passing through this scene of trial, and joining them in mansions of eternal Joy and Triumph—Then will you sing the song of Moses and the Lamb—You will join the throng of Angels, and with Prophets—Apos∣tles—and all the redeemed will say—<HI>Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, and hath made us Kings and Priests unto GOD and his Father, To him be glory and dominion forever—</HI></P>
<P>Thus eternal ages will roll on—</P>
<P>But Alas! the present occasion breaks in upon us! How deep the gloom at this time!!</P>

<L>WHAT solemn sounds the ear invade!</L>
<L>What wraps the land in sorrow's shade!</L>
<L>From Heaven the awful mandate flies—</L>
<L>The FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY DIES.</L>

<L>Let every heart be fill'd with woe,</L>

<L>Each form, oppress'd with deepest gloom,</L>
<L>Be clad in vestments of the tomb.</L>
