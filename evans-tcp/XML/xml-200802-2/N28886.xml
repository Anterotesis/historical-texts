<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE</HI> following Sermon is not presented to the Public, from an idea that it possesses any peculiar mer∣it, on account of depth of thought; originality of ideas; or beauty of arrangement. The Author, when he wrote it, had not the least idea of its ever thus appear∣ing abroad. But such was the occasion, upon which it was delivered, that the Church of Haverhill unani∣mously desired, and continued to desire a copy of it for the Press. And, after declining, for a considerable time, the Author complied with their wishes, appre∣hending, that the truths it contains, may be of service; especially to the Church and People, whom he had left, and for whom he feels a tender concern.</P>

<Q><BIBL><HI>ACTS, xx.32.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And now, brethren, I commend you to GOD, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them, who are sanctified.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">P</SEG>AUL had preached the Gospel at Ephe∣sus, and been the instrument of plant∣ing a Church there. He had remained with them for several years, teaching and admonishing them, till he probably viewed them to be <HI>rooted and grounded in the truth.</HI> He then pursued his tour, to preach the glad tidings of salvation in the regions round about them. After a while, he found it necessary to leave those parts, and to return to Jerusalem. Upon this journey he touched at Mi∣letus; and from thence he sent and collected the El∣ders of the Church of Ephesus, to address to them his last charge; his farewell discourse. This he in∣troduces by an appeal to their consciences, in which he recounts his own ministerial faithfulness among them. "<HI>Ye know from the first day that I came into A∣sia,
<PB N="6" REF="038515_0004_101248508BF2A3B8"/>
after what manner I have been with you at all sea∣sons, serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears and temptations, which befel me by the lying in wait of the Jews; and how I kept, back nothing, which was profitable unto you; but have showed you, and taught you publicly, and from house to house; testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance to∣wards God, and faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI>" He proceeds, and tells them, that he was now going bound in spirit to Jerusalem; <HI>i. e.</HI> convinced in con∣science that God called him thither; that he knew not what trials were to befal him there, except that in every city he was notified, by the Holy Spirit, that bond and afflictions awaited him. But his courage was no<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ired. "<HI>None of these things move me; neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received, to testify the Gospel of the grace of God.</HI>" Paul then suggests to them that this was their last inter∣view on earth; that they should see his face here no more. He, therefore, calls on them to bear him witness, that he had faithfully cleared himself from the blood of souls. For he had not concealed from them any part of the revealed counsel of God; but had boldly declared it all. So that, if any at Ephesus now perished, their blood must be up∣on their own heads! Paul, then, solemnly enjoins on them <HI>faithfulness,</HI> both to themselves, and to their churches. And to induce them to this, he warns them of approaching dangers. "<HI>For I know, that after my departure, shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.</HI>" q. d. The enemy will take an advantage from my absence, and will introduce their favorite teachers; yea, the latter will be ready to introduce themselves, and to improve ev∣ery subtil argument and opportunity to gain prose∣lytes, without any regard to the good of souls. For, however these teachers are adorned with sheep's clothing, (<HI>i. e.</HI> with great pretences, and some ap∣pearances
<PB N="7" REF="038515_0005_1012481BB17047D0"/>
of benevolence and religion,) yet they are no better than wolves among sheep; prowling from fold to fold; caring nothing for the flock; but to gorge their own appetites; and, with <HI>good words, and fair speeches,</HI> to deceive the hearts of the simple. Yea, he warns them that some of their own members would become perverse schismatics; and that disci∣ples, (probably from their more loose and unstable characters,) would be drawn away after them. He renewedly charges them, therefore, to <HI>watch</HI> and to recollect his warnings, and his care, which for a number of years he had exhibited among them.</P>
<P>Paul then adds, as in our text; "<HI>And now, breth∣ren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inherit∣ance among all them, who are sanctified.</HI>" This he doubtless esteemed a blessed privilege, that, inasmuch as he must bid them a final adieu on earth, he might carry them to God, and leave them at his feet.</P>
<P>Upon the text, it may be suitable, at this time, to show,</P>
<P N="1">I. What was implied in Paul's commending his Ephesian brethren to God, and to the word of his grace. And,</P>
<P N="2">II. What encouragement he had thus to do. "<HI>Which is able to build you up, &amp;c.</HI>"</P>
<P>As to the first idea, It implied much. It implied his tender affection and concern for them; that he bore them upon his heart; that they were dear to him. It implied, that he was about to leave them. For though it be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>able for christian friends <HI>ever,</HI> though present, to commend each other to God; yet this is an expression more peculiarly adapted to a parting scene. The Apostle was to have the im∣mediate charge of them no more. He, therefore, by faith, commits them to God; lays them at his feet, or places them <HI>near</HI> to him, as the word in the orig∣inal, <HI>Paratithemi,</HI> imports. It implies Paul's confi∣dence in God; in the glory and rectitude of his gov∣ernment;
<PB N="8" REF="038515_0006_101248531E94CBE0"/>
that God governs all events and things in glorious wisdom and benevolence. Otherwise, Paul would have esteemed it no privilege to com∣mend his dear friends to God; for there would be no safety in their lying at his feet. They might re∣ceive <HI>good</HI> or <HI>ill</HI> treatment; and there would be no foundation for confidence. But Paul's commending them to God implied his full belief, that, under the Divine Government, all things will terminate well; that infinite Power, Wisdom and Benevolence sit at helm, and will cause that light shall, eventually, spring out of darkness, and order out of confusion, to the eternal joy and salvation of all <HI>the benevolent;</HI> that there is, hence, a glorious foundation for un∣shaken confidence in God.</P>
<P>And his commending them to the word of God's grace, also implied much. It implied, that he view∣ed this word as their <HI>guide,</HI> their <HI>polar star,</HI> their <HI>mean</HI> of salvation. God could work <HI>without</HI> the means, of which he now makes use, if he pleased. But it is <HI>not</HI> his will thus to do; but to work <HI>by</HI> means. Certain means are appointed by God, and must be attended to by man, <HI>as God directs,</HI> in order that certain ends may be obtained. God of old ap∣pointed the ark, as the mean of Noah's safety from the deluge. He appointed the passover, and the sprinkling of the blood, in Israel, as the mean of their safety from the sword of the destroying angel. He appointed Moses' rod, as the mean of producing the plagues upon Egypt; of dividing the Red Sea; and of bringing water from the rock. He appoint∣ed the brazen serpent, as the mean of healing for the bitten, dying Israelite. He appointed the blowing of rams' horns by the priests, leading the congrega∣tion of Israel round the walls of Jericho, once a day, for seven days; and on the seventh day, <HI>seven times,</HI> as the mean of the destruction of those walls; and of the going in of the chosen tribes to possess the promised land. He appointed the arming of three
<PB N="9" REF="038515_0007_1012481E381AA3F0"/>
hundred men, under Gideon, with trumpets, with pitchers, and lights in them; that they should blow their trumpets, dash their pitchers, and cry, "<HI>The sword of the Lord and of Gideon,</HI>" as the mean of rout∣ing the numerous hosts of Israel's enemies, who were encamped against them.</P>
<P>And God has, <HI>in like manner,</HI> appointed his word, and the preaching of his Gospel, as the mean of the salvation of souls. The two latter instances mention∣ed were, doubtless, lively emblems of this appoint∣ment. To this mean of grace, souls must attend in love and obedience to God; or they are not in way to heaven. And to this mean of grace, it appears Paul commended his Ephesian brethren. He was sensible that "<HI>Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</HI>" He had fully learned, that it was <HI>by the Gospel</HI> that souls were begotten unto a lively hope; and, <HI>by the word,</HI> that they are washed or sanctified; "<HI>Washed in water by the word.</HI>" To this, therefore, Paul joyfully commended his christian friends, when parting from them. I pass on now to show,</P>
<P N="2">II. What encouragement he had thus to do. "<HI>Which is able to build you up, and to give you an inher∣itance among all them, who are sanctified.</HI>" The rela∣tive <HI>which,</HI> here, may refer either to the antecedent <HI>God</HI>; or the <HI>word</HI> of his grace. And <HI>both</HI> were able thus to build them up; <HI>i. e. God</HI> was infinitely able to do it by his word; and his <HI>word</HI> was able to do it, when he made it so, and rendered it a favor of life unto life. Paul was sensible, that the word of God was mighty, through the Spirit, to the pulling down of strong holds; and to the destroying of ev∣ery thing, which stood in the way of their meetness for glory; that it was, for this purpose, <HI>sharp</HI> and <HI>powerful, as a two edged sword.</HI> And knowing this to be God's usual method, and his solemn engage∣ment to his people; he cheerfully commends them to him for this purpose.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="038515_0008_10124854C616F9A8"/>Two ideas are contained in the clause of the text under consideration, viz. <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Glory.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Grace. "<HI>Which is able to build you up." i. e.</HI> Which is able to keep you from falling, until you shall be presented spotless before the throne of his glory with exceeding joy. Which is able to preserve your whole soul and body blameless unto the day of Christ, and which <HI>will</HI> do it. This clause in the text seems to refer to the power and efficacy of God's Spirit, with the word, to keep and prepare his chil∣dren for heaven. But the divine efficiency in this matter is exerted in a way, which is consistent with the agency of the creature in the same thing. This is an idea of importance to be kept in view, that the divine sovereignty, and creature agency, (with the necessity of means in order to ends,) are perfectly consistent. If God work in his people to <HI>will,</HI> and to <HI>do,</HI> of his own good pleasure, it is that they may work out their own salvation with fear and trembling. Therefore, the clause of the text under consideration, implies their own vigorous activity in being built up. According to Jude, ver. 20, 21. "<HI>But ye, beloved, building up yourselves in your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost, keep yourselves in the love of God.</HI>" And many are the divine precepts, which demand the same; such as, "<HI>Strive to enter in at the strait gate;" "The kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the vio∣lent take it by force.</HI>" It implies their persevering in religion. "<HI>He that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.</HI>" It implies their growth in grace. "<HI>The path of the just is as the shining light, which shineth more and more unto the perfect day.</HI>" The water of grace not only abides in them a well of water, but is <HI>spring∣ing up</HI> unto everlasting life. It implies their benev∣olent cultivation of harmony among themselves. "<HI>My dove, my undefiled is one." "That they all may be one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee; that they may be one with us.</HI>" It implies their faithful dis∣position to support, and to improve the ordinances
<PB N="11" REF="038515_0009_10124820AB0BE1D8"/>
of the Gospel. "<HI>Walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless." "Watching daily at my gates, and waiting at the posts of my doors.</HI>" It im∣plies their remaining steadfast in the faith. "<HI>Rooted and grounded in the truth." "Not carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men, and their cun∣ning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive.</HI>" It accordingly implies their taking heed, and being aware of false teachers; marking and avoiding those who make divisions contrary to the doctrines of grace. Paul in our context had been warning the Ephesians against such impostors; and then commends them to God, in hopes of their being built up, as in the text. This circumstance forms an <HI>antithesis</HI> between their being seduced by impostors; and their being built up. The latter, therefore, implies their with∣standing such characters. And Paul was sensible, not only that God was able to build up his chosen, but that he had engaged to do it; that Christ's sheep shall hear his voice, and follow him; that he will give unto them eternal life; that they shall never perish; neither shall any pluck them out of his hands; that a stranger they will not follow; for they know not the voice of a stranger. Thus <HI>grace</HI> is comprised in the encouragement in the text. And,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Glory in heaven</HI> is also comprised. "<HI>And to give you an inheritance, among all them, who are sanctifi∣ed." i. e.</HI> An inheritance in heaven, among the gen∣eral assembly and church of the first born; among the spirits of just men made perfect. This is the blessed result of their being built up; of their pos∣sessing and persevering in religion. This is the in∣heritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for all, who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation. This inheritance of the saints in light, comprises the most glorious excellencies; which are, entire free∣dom from selfishness and sin; perfect conformity to God; being made perfect in pure and holy love;
<PB N="12" REF="038515_0010_10124858B9139280"/>
holy and uninterrupted presence of God, and of the Lamb; and the blessed and holy society of angels, and of the saints. It contains nothing pleasing to carnal hearts; for it is a holy and benevolent happi∣ness. It affords to holy souls a perfect satisfaction in God's likeness; in beholding his glory shining in the face of Jesus Christ; and reflected from all his works. It is a glorious and eternal rest from all the labors and trials of time and sense; and a free and uninterrupted participation of the river of God's pleasures. And it probably will comprise an endless progression in knowledge; in strength of benevo∣lence; and consequently in happiness. This is but an hint of the inheritance in the text. This was the prize, which Paul had in view; this the crown of glory, which animated him in all his perils and dan∣gers, and which he desired that others likewise should see and secure. This world, he viewed as nothing compared with it. To obtain this prize, he forgot the things, which were behind; reached to them, which were before; and pressed through all occur∣ring difficulties. And, at the affecting moment of parting from christian friends, he could think of noth∣ing more comforting, than to commend them to God, and to the word of his grace, confiding in God's a∣bility and faithfulness to meeten them <HI>for,</HI> and finally confer upon them <HI>this blessed inheritance.</HI></P>
<P>Let us now attend to some</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="improvement">
<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>AND now, my friends, how far may I be permitted to adopt the words of Paul, in our text and context? You will excuse me, if I deviate from my usual meth∣od of improvements; and attend to the ideas, which present circumstances naturally suggest. God, in his holy Providence, has afforded me opportunity to la∣bor in the Gospel, in this place, for a number of years. But now it appears that I have no further call to remain among you. The cause of this sepa∣ration
<PB N="13" REF="038515_0011_10124823306C2DE0"/>
is well known. And the day is coming, when it will appear, whether there be any thing criminal in the conduct of those, who have occasioned it in withholding my support. My judgment concurs with the result of the Rev. Council, that the intima∣tions of Providence, relative to my temporal support here, call me to leave this place. Here I shall leave this part of the subject, after one remark, viz. that I have no hard thoughts of my friends, in this place, for not making greater exertions for my support and continuance among them. I apprehend their exer∣tions were as great, and as persevering, as duty de∣manded. The Lord graciously reward them, in crowning similar exertions with better success in some other, and better Pastor!</P>
<P>As to my faithfulness among you, I have nothing of which to boast. My conscience, however, testifies that I have sought your best interest; and have en∣deavored to declare to you all the counsel of God; that I have set before you the way of life, and the way of death, as exhibited in God's word; and also the motives there furnished to induce you to pursue the one, and avoid the other. But with many im∣perfections I have, doubtless, been attended. I pray God to forgive them; and request you to draw over them the veil of candor.</P>
<P>So far as I have explained to you the Sacred Ora∣cles, and set before you the truths of heaven, I en∣treat you that (from a sacred regard to the authority and the grace of Jehovah, and from a regard to your own immortal interest,) you solemnly attend to them. Forget not that we are probationers for eternity; that we are here, but for a few days, to cultivate a temper, and form a character, according to which we must receive our eternal destiny. You have heard, in the former part of this day, how <HI>every one of us shall give an account of himself to God;</HI> and, among other things, I of my ministry among you; and you how you have improved it. And God only knows
<PB N="14" REF="038515_0012_1012485AAFF23350"/>
whether we shall ever meet again, till that eventful period.</P>
<P>And now, seeing we must part, I leave with you my best wishes for your happiness; my cordial de∣sires for your salvation. But <HI>what you must be,</HI> in or∣der to obtain salvation, you have often been inform∣ed; nor will one soul obtain it without this meet∣ness. But what will be your prospects without the Gospel? Paul, in our text, commends his brethen to God, <HI>and to the word of his grace.</HI> He left them un∣der the full enjoyment of the ordinances of grace. Happy, indeed, could I leave you, (seeing I must leave you,) in the enjoyment of these privileges! A∣las, here lies the difference! You are become des∣titute of them. What shall I say to you concerning this?</P>
<P>My Fellow Mortals of this vicinity, Is the Gospel of the grace of God nothing to you? Is it nothing to enjoy it? Nothing to be deprived of it? And noth∣ing to despise and reject it? If you remain destitute of the Gospel, mark my words, this place will be∣come notorious for impiety and wickedness. Then what will become of your children, and the rising generation here? How shall you be able to meet their souls at the bar of God? And what will become of your own immortal interest? O, if you have any re∣gard for the good of society; and especially for the good of your souls, and those of your children, then be entreated speedily to unite with the Church in this place to obtain and support a minister of Christ. Depend on it, it is your duty, and your weighty in∣terest. The gospel ministry is the institution of heaven. It is the mean of salvation. And, if reject∣ed, your salvation is lost! O interesting thought! Can you, without trembling, read the language of Christ to his ambassadors, <HI>He, who receiveth you, re∣ceiveth me; but he, who despiseth you, despiseth me; and he, who despiseth me, despiseth him, who sent me?</HI> If any of you be found among those, who reject this
<PB N="15" REF="038515_0013_101248259ED82228"/>
gracious institution of heaven, what have you to ex∣pect? Will Christ wink at your impiety; dispense with his solemn institutions; and state <HI>other</HI> and <HI>low∣er</HI> terms, with which you may be pleased to comply? Let reason judge. If you mean to conduct with any degree of wisdom, then speedily obtain and improve the privileges of the Gospel. Appropriate so much of your interest, as is necessary for this purpose; and deprive not your souls of all the blessings of the Gospel only to save a pittance of worldly gain. You will now view me as disinterested upon this part of the sub∣ject; and will, therefore, permit me to use plainness of speech. Can a handful of that, which the Apos∣tle styles <HI>filthy lucre,</HI> do that for you, which the Gos∣pel of the grace of God can do? Can the trifling sum, which you may save in refusing to support the Gospel, procure you a safe retreat at death? Can it open for you the gates of bliss beyond the grave? Or secure you a glorious immortality when the earth is dissolving in flames? How much can it do for you in sickness; in death; in the judgment day; and in hell? Will riches profit you in the day of wrath? Will it not be a miserable saving, to save the cost of a preached gospel, at the expense of your souls, of heaven, and of enduring eternal burnings? Say not these inquiries are harsh. They are suggested by se∣rious truths.</P>
<P>Consider on whom you are dependent for tempo∣ral interest; whether God cannot bestow liberally upon you, if you improve it for him; whether be∣ing guilty of the ingratitude and impiety of prefer∣ring a trifle of interest to all the blessings procured by Christ; yea, whether robbing God in tithes and of∣ferings be the safest way to secure the bounties of Providence. At your leisure please to turn to Hag∣gai, i.4—11. and to Malachi, iii.8, 9, 10, where you will find something to the purpose upon this idea. Then read Paul's writings upon the subject, in vari∣ous of his Epistles; particularly 1 Cor. ix.1—14.
<PB N="16" REF="038515_0014_1012485D5F7C12E8"/>
Gal. vi.6, 7, and 1 Tim. v.17, 18. In these scrip∣tures you may learn your duty as to the support of the Gospel; and may learn also the curse of God, which lies on those, who rob him in this respect.</P>
<P>And with respect to the character of your minis∣ter, whom you may choose; will you prefer a man, who will seek, not your souls, but to obtain your tem∣poral interest? And who will seek honor from men in the neglect of faithfulness? Will you choose one, who will daub with untempered mortar; heal wounds slightly; and cry peace, where God says there is no peace? Are not our natural hearts full ready enough to deceive us, without the fatal assistance of smooth preaching? Alas, how many among men have their hearts depicted in the following inspired hint; "<HI>Who say to their seers, see not, and to their prophets, prophesy not unto us right things; speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceit. Cause the Holy one of Israel to cease from before us.</HI>" The false prophets in Israel of old were very popular; for their smooth preaching soothed and pleased the carnal heart. But the true prophets were, for their fathfulness, hated and put to death. "<HI>I hate him,</HI>" says Ahab of Micaiah, "<HI>for he never prophesieth good of me, but evil.</HI>" Christ says, "<HI>The world hateth me, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.</HI>" And the truth of this they de∣monstrated in putting him to death. How many viewed Paul as an enemy because he told them the truth? And how many thousands, upon this princi∣ple, have been put to death? But can it be your wis∣dom, or for your interest, to have the solemn truths of heaven suppressed, because the view of them af∣fords pain? How long will the pain, in this way, be deferred? Will it not ere long, fall, with an hun∣dred fold weight, upon you? Can any wish to be confirmed in fatal deception? Will not smooth and false teachers ingulf themselves and their votaries in ruin? Let Christ decide it. "<HI>If the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.</HI>" Which surgeon
<PB N="17" REF="038515_0015_101248277493C338"/>
would you prefer? the one, who softly heals the surface of your wound, and carelessly leaves your life in imminent danger? Or the one who benevo∣lently performs the painful operation of probing it to the bottom, and saves your life, by effecting a thorough cure? Alas, "<HI>The children of this world are wiser in their generation, than the children of light.</HI>"</P>
<P>But, know that you are faithfully warned! I must rid myself of the blood of your souls. Permit me, now to remind you, perhaps for the last time, that unless you do, with humble and penitent hearts, commend yourselves to God, and to the word of his grace, by prizing and improving the Gospel; you will fail of heaven; you will be found, at last, on the left hand; you will be treated as Gospel despisers; and will sink in endless woe. With this warning I must bid you adieu.</P>
<P>My young Friends, who are in the morning of your days; What shall I address to you, on this oc∣casion? Will you not lay to heart the things, which have been suggested, and which you have often heard? If parents, and those, who are advanced in age, in too may instances, neglect them, yet will not you attend to them, and set better examples? I did expect to spend my days with you. But Providence forbids; and I must submit. I have esteemed you as an important class of people. I think I have de∣sired, and sought your best interest. And I still wish your temporal, but especially your eternal prosperity. But permit me, once more, as your friend, to remind you, that you are environed with snares, which ruin thousands. Your danger, while out of Christ, is great beyond description. And, probably, it is not lessened by your present prospects with respect to the Gospel. God grant that you may escape the dan∣gers which attend you, and speedily secure a blessed immortality. In order to this, be sober minded. Remember your Creator in the days of your youth. Cultivate true piety. Follow not the multitude to

do evil. Dare to break out from the fascinating charms of popular vice; and to be singular for Christ. Do not go down to endless misey for the sake of the multitude, who are goin<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Es∣cape the vices of the times. Walk in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ths of religion, of virtue and peace. Before the fascinating cup of pleasures reaches your lip, <HI>pause</HI>; consider who beholds you; what he demands; and what consequences will follow. And may you be wise to avoid the evil, and to choose the good. My labors with you will not prove so indifferent a matter, as some may have viewed them. If I have been un∣faithful, the consequence must fall with dreadful weight upon my own head; but if faithful, as I hope, in some good degree, you will find my administra∣tion here, (to your joy, or horror,) a savor of <HI>life,</HI> or of <HI>death.</HI> God grant it may be the former; and that, though we must now part, and I must bid you adieu, we may be prepared for an happy meeting in a better world.</P>
<P>And, now, my Brethren, and Beloved of the Church; it is devolved upon me to address to you my Farewell. — Is this possible? Is it a reali∣ty? Or, is it not a dream? We cannot wake, and find it to be the latter. It is the former. Painful is the scene, the dissolution of the interesting relation between us!</P>
<P>What can I now say, but in the words of our text, to commend you to God, and to the word of his grace? For he is able, under all your discourage∣ments, to build you up, and to give you an inherit∣ance among all them, who are sanctified. I hope you are interested in that celestial treasure. God has afforded us opportunity to form and cultivate an endearing acquaintance with each other; to walk, hand in hand, for a course of years, even ever since you have been a church. We have mutually waded through scenes of trials. And we have been favor∣ed with many privileges and occasions of joy. And,
<PB N="19" REF="038515_0017_101248298F3520A0"/>
though we must now part, I trust we have a mutual friendship formed, which time will never dissolve; which death will not obliterate; and which eternity will strengthen and refine. If our friendship be built on the love of God, this is indeed the case. And then, though we must be parted in this vale of tears; and God only knows through what trials we may be called to pass in our different ways; yet one thing we may know, for our mutual consolation, that "<HI>Neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Je∣sus, our Lord.</HI>" We shall then meet in that better world, where there will be no more painful separa∣tion; where the wicked shall cease from troubling; where the weary shall be at rest in pure and holy love, in the likeness and blessed presence of our Savior and Lord.</P>
<P>O, let us keep that blessed world in view. Wan∣der not, my brethren, from the path, which leads to it. Be not lost in this dangerous, intervening wil∣derness. Turn not aside to the right hand, nor to the left, lest your feet stumble upon the dark moun∣tains, and your souls be utterly lost.</P>
<P>With respect to the means of grace, obtain the ad∣ministration of them, if possible. Pray to the Lord of the harvest for this blessing. But remember, that an unfaithful shepherd, (possess he ever so popular talents,) is, <HI>by far,</HI> worse than none. Take heed, then, and beware of false prophets. Your situation, will be critical. I fear that sectaries and evil work∣ers will be in among you. Errors and damnable her∣esies are becoming prevalent and popular; and ma∣ny are their subtil advocates, who, if it were possible, would deceive the very elect. Take heed, then, <HI>how</HI> and <HI>whom</HI> ye hear. Receive not schismatics into your houses. "<HI>Go ye not after them.</HI>" Bid them not God's speed. But mark and avoid them. And
<PB N="20" REF="038515_0018_101248634D8FDCE0"/>
let us watch and pray always, that we may be ac∣counted worthy to escape all the evils, which are coming upon the earth, and to stand before the Son of Man.</P>
<P>I hope you are <HI>rooted</HI> and <HI>grounded</HI> in the truth. God forbid that I should flatter you. But I cannot but feel comforted in the apprehension that this is the case with you, as a church. May the merciful Savior afford you abundance of grace, that you may <HI>feel,</HI> and exhibit much evidence that this is the fact. In order for this, be blameless and harmless, the sons of God without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation; among whom, see to it, that ye shine, as lights in the world. Have your conver∣sation honest among your fellow men; that, if any speak evil of you, they may be ashamed when they behold your good conversation of Christ. Be stead∣fast, and immoveable; always abounding in the work of the Lord. If it be possible, as much as in you li∣eth, live peaceably with all men. At the same time remember to contend earnestly for the faith once de∣livered to the saints. By no means sacrifice your re∣ligion to carnal peace, or to complaisance; for the wis∣dom which is from above, is <HI>first pure,</HI> then peaceable.</P>
<P>Should the cause of Christ be ever so much neg∣lected, or despised, yet favor not this impiety. Be not ashamed of Christ. Remember Christ's moving interrogation to his disciples, when numbers return∣ed back, to walk 'no more with him, "<HI>Will you also go away?</HI>" With melting hearts unite with them in the reply, "<HI>Lord, whither shall we go, but unto thee?</HI>"</P>
<P>"<HI>Let brotherly love continue.</HI>" Let brotherly watch∣fulness abound. Remember your vows, and the laws of Christ concerning discipline. Exhort one another daily, lest any be hardened through the de∣ceitfulness of sin. Look diligently, lest roots of bit∣terness, springing up, trouble and defile you. And, O, remember to sanctify the sabbath! I fear this du∣ty will be awfully neglected in this place. If you
<PB N="21" REF="038515_0019_1012482E5EC20600"/>
have no preaching, I beseech you forsake not the as∣sembling of yourselves together. You have the promise of Christ's presence, if but two or three meet in his name. Labor, by word, and example, to prevent all profanation of the Lord's day.</P>
<P>And, will you not recollect, and comply with this request in the words of Paul. "<HI>Brethren, pray for us.</HI>" Pray for a poor earthen vessel, who is entrust∣ed with a commission, "<HI>to testify the gospel of the grace of God.</HI>" Pray for him, who has been your Pastor. <HI>He needs your prayers!</HI></P>
<P>And now, finally, brethren, farewell; be perfect; be of good comfort; be of one mind; live in love and peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>SOME</HI> may inquire, how Mr. Smith came to be dismissed from his People; seeing such a cor∣diality subsisted between him and his Church? The an∣swer is, merely for want of support. The Church, and those other persons, who were disposed to join with them, for the purpose of settling him, were unable to afford him a comfortable maintenance. Those who first engaged to pay his salary, were but a private society, their number very small, and the sum proposed for his support very small. Mr. Smith, nevertheless, was advised by the Council, to accept the invitation to settle; from a consid∣eration, that no objection appeared against his so doing, which would not lie, with equal force, against their hav∣ing the Gospel settled at all. After several years, there was a deficiency in the payment of the salary, small as it was, by reason, that a number of those who first engaged, refused to pay their proportion. The difficulty was soon increased; by the refusal of some others, who were not pleased with the place of worship; till at length, the situa∣tion of the society became such, that it was judged expedi∣ent to discontinue their usual practice, of making an assess∣ment, for the collection of the salary. He then (having continued hitherto with much difficulty,) proposed to call a Council, for advice relative to the expediency of his contin∣uing among them. The result of which was, that, although a perfect harmony subsisted between Mr. Smith and his Church; and although they had made great and laudable exertions for his support and continuance among them; yet, inasmuch as no permanent foundation was laid for his sup∣port, and so many important openings and calls for Min∣isters appeared, these dispensations of Providence, in the opinion of the Council, evidently called Mr. Smith from this part of the vineyard.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="038515_0021_10124865DDC2E968"/>After several weeks' consideration, Mr. Smith and the Church unanimously viewed it to be their duty to comply with the result of Council; which compliance dissolved their connection.</P>
<P>The Church, then, unanimously voted to present the fol∣lowing Address to Mr. Smith; which was delivered at the close of the Public Exercises, on the same day on which the foregoing Sermon was delivered; and is here annex∣ed, at the request of a number of respectable characters.</P>

<HEAD>AN ADDRESS TO THE Rev. ETHAN SMITH.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>REV. AND DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT having pleased the All Wise Disposer of human events, in the course of his providence, so to or∣der the circumstances of your Ministry and the af∣fairs relative to your support, amongst this people, as evidently to point out the expediency of a separa∣tion between you and this Church, and your pastor∣al relation to this flock, being consequently dissolv∣ed by mutual consent, you will permit the Church, in this public manner, to address you on the affect∣ing subject. Painful indeed, Sir, to us, is the sepa∣ration that has lately taken place; and it is with the deepest regret, that we now view ourselves deprived of the benefit of your faithful administrations. But, consoling thought! we believe that we shall ever have an interest in your prayers; and, although you and the members of this Church may probably very soon be separated in person; yet we trust, that we shall not be so in affection; but that the fraternal love and christian affection, which has subsisted ever since your first coming among us, and has been grad∣ually increasing through a term of almost nine years, will never cease; but be perfected in the realms of love. We hope, and believe, Sir, that nothing short of a full conviction of duty, in the minds both of the Pastor and Church, has, or could have, finally in∣duced to an unanimous compliance with the result of
<PB N="24" REF="038515_0023_1012486815323D30"/>
Council; but such a conviction, we are sensible, ought ever to produce a quiet submission to the will of Providence; and, however weighty the cross may be, it is no argument against our cheerfully taking it up and following our Divine Leader. We trust, dear Sir, that we are not altogether insensible to the many advantages, which this Church has reaped from your residence and labors among us; and we would acknowledge, with gratitude, the obligations which you (under God) have thereby conferred on us. With this view, Sir, permit us to take a retrospect of past scenes. And in the first place, your active and unwearied exertions, at the time of your first entering in to us, in a time of general awakening in this place, more particularly, your readiness and as∣siduity in instructing the ignorant, alarming the se∣cure, guiding inquirers, establishing the doubtful and comforting the feeble minded; in connection with that easy, unaffected and accommodating address, so peculiarly your own; your generous sacrifice of an overture, in a distant place, larger than could be ex∣pected from our small number; and your taking the charge of this flock, in the face of a powerful oppo∣sition, evidence a love and attachment, on your part, which we would gratefully notice. Since your set∣tlement, your plain, powerful, and demonstrative strain of preaching, your fervent prayers, your pa∣thetic and moving addresses, at the celebration of the Lord's Supper; your readiness, at all times, to visit the sick among your people, and to attend on lectures and conferences, whenever requested, thus being in∣stant in preaching the word, in season and out of sea∣son; your wisdom and faithfulness when presiding in the Church, and leading them in measures designed and calculated to promote Gospel order and disci∣pline; together with your bold and faithful reproofs; these are some of the most prominent features in your ministerial character, are gifts by which we have been greatly edified, in the course of your ministry, and
<PB N="27" REF="038515_0024_101248352358DBD0"/>
the unanimity and love of discipline, so observable in this Church, we esteem as some of the happy fruits thereof. Furthermore, Sir, we feel ourselves com∣forted, in a view of the patience and fortitude, with which you have sustained your peculiar trials and embarrassments; your deportment having been so exemplary, through the whole course of your min∣istry, that not the least impeachment of your mor∣al conduct has been attempted, by any, the most in∣veterate of your enemies. These things we ought to reflect upon, with pleasure and joy, being unfeigned∣ly thankful, that we have had so abundant occasion (though for a much shorter season than we hoped) to rejoice in your light. We assure you, dear Sir, that whenever you leave us, you have our fervent prayers, for yourself, your consort and family; that an effectual door may be opened, in Providence, for your stated and successful labors and honorable sup∣port in the vineyard of the Lord; where you may prove a happy instrument, in the hand of God's Spirit, of turning many to righteousness; and (as your glory and reward) that you may shine, as a star of the first magnitude, forever and ever. Finally, Sir, we ask your prayers for this Church and people, in their bereaved situation; that we may have grace given us, seriously to inquire into the grounds of God's controversy with us; that we may remember how and what we have heard from you, hold fast, re∣pent, be humbled, and do our first works; and when God shall have answered the gracious designs of this chastisement, with respect to us, that he will send us another Pastor, after his own heart; under whose ministrations, may we be trained up for the kingdom of glory; and at length, meet you, our beloved Pas∣tor, therein, never more to be separated.</P>
<P>Voted unanimously by the Church.</P>
