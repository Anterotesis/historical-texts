With the same view, I here present you, with a real Model; not as the Standard of Perfection; for that, like the Beauty of Bodies, is not to be discovered in any In∣dividual; but as an Exemplar of the happy Combination of many of those Moral Beauties, which constitute the perfect Character.

<P>IS there a spectacle under Heaven, so interesting to the hu∣man heart, as that of a free and numerous people putting on the ensigns of mourning, and with one accord, pouring forth their sorrows for the loss, they have sustained in the death of a beloved and honored Fellow-Citizen? Such, is the spec∣tacle, which America this day presents. Glorious spectacle! Glorious to humanity, which has displayed virtues capable of exciting such universal, such heart-felt veneration and love. Glorious to you, citizens of America, who thus honour your∣selves by evincing the high value you entertain for exalted merit.—Great God! On this day, whose rising sun, we, of late, hailed with joyful acclamations, as ushering in the morn, which gave birth to the illustrious WASHINGTON, but which now, sad emblem of all things human, is set apart to bewail his loss, and to retrace the energies of his departed soul;—on this day of woe, permit me to express the consolation, which such a triumph of virtue excites within my heart. I behold a young, but enlightened people testifying, with one voice, their sincere devotion to virtue; I see the flame of an ardent love for what is truly great and good, bursting forth from every bosom; I see a people, but just beginning to move in their political orbit, giving the surest testimony, that the love of virtue per∣vades the breast of every citizen, and that they possess a force, which will retain them throughout their long career, in the path of social felicity, and social greatness. I see, from this principle, this sincere love of virtue, the future glories of my country already to commence. It will be, if preserved in all its strength, the shield of liberty, the protecting Angel of the republics of this western world; it will render them for ever illustrious for patriotism, for heroic deeds, for arts and for sci∣ences. It is thus that they will defy the decrepitude of old age; it is thus, that they will be perpetually renovated in youth; and under the guidance of thy Providence, O God! It is thus, they will shew to the astonished world, that the love of virtue has snatched from death, amid his dread conquests, one victory more. May this love be ever cherished with a holy zeal! May it ever be the distinguishing characteristic of Americans, to pay to it the homage, which is due. May this day ever serve to recall the bright example of a WASHINGTON; and
<PB N="5" REF="037876_0004_100F5F60EDA326B8"/>
to renew, in the hearts of succeeding generations, that love for virtue which animates the present.</P>
<P>Ah! My friends and fellow-citizens, I am sensible of the dif∣ficulty of addressing you, upon this mournful occasion, in a man∣ner correspondent to your feelings. But the love of my country, veneration for those rare qualities which dignify and ennoble man, and which diffuse such blessings throughout society; and above all, the invitations of religion, give to me a momentary confi∣dence. Those virtues which once animated the heroes of America in the day of battle, now animate the minister of reli∣gion, of truth and of justice.—It is true, that genius and elo∣quence have already exerted their powers in calling to memory the splendid talents, the meritorious actions of the deceased; and that they have depicted them with a glow of colouring, which I dare not attempt; but, the subject can never become trite, it can never be exhausted. Let us then endeavor to re∣trace some of those qualities, which distinguished our deceased fellow-citizen, as the hero, the patriot and the sage; let us re∣view some of the important scenes through which he passed; and let us search, for the grief we feel in his loss, a consolati∣on in the recital of the wonders of his life. It is a custom wor∣thy of all free states, and which the most celebrated in antiqui∣ty religiously observed, to be mindful of their ancestors, to ex∣tol them with merited panegyricks, and to honor them on such occasions as the present; that by doing justice to the actions of the dead, they may excite the virtues of the living.</P>
<P>If indeed, the illustrious WASHINGTON, whom all Ameri∣ca deplores, and whom the whole civilized world will honor with their eulogies, had obtained only that celebrity, which extraordinary talents in war, in arts and sciences, or in poli∣tics confer; if he had not been distinguished for his firm adhe∣rence to the truths of religion; if he had not served his God with a zeal worthy of his superior understanding, however full of glory he might have been in the eyes of man, religion could not have added her voice to the general plaudit. But religion joins in the universal woe; she weeps over the tomb of WASHINGTON, great in arms, great in peace, great in piety; and amidst her sorrows, feels a gleam of consolation in pro∣nouncing his eulogium.</P>
<P>I. With the life of WASHINGTON is connected a new aera in the history of man. He seems to have been called forth by Heaven, as the instrument of establishing principles, funda∣mental in social happiness, and which must and will pervade the civilized world.</P>

When young he was trained to hardihood and to arms; he was educated in the school of war, and thus prepared for that mighty conflict, which shook the pillars of a distant throne. The government which nursed the youthful warrior, nursed a Sampson, who was one day to break its fetters, and burst it's cords asunder. Virginia saw in her youthful son traits of that character, which was to become the admiration of the world; the morning of his life gave the well founded hope, that the meridian of his day would shine with augmented lustre, and that his setting sun would leave a long tract of glory be∣hind.—Great talents soon manifest themselves by the force with which they take their direction. David, when a youth, sought out the lion and the bear as subjects for his valour, and voluntarily joined himself to the armies of Israel to be instruct∣ed in the arts of war. WASHINGTON sought out the warrior of the wilderness, and at an early age, provoked his courage and his stratagems.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">GENERAL WASHINGTON was born on the 22d of February 1732, N. S. When a youth, he was entered a midshipman, on board a British vessel of war; but relinquished his nautical views, in consequence of the entreaties of his friends. Before he attained his twentieth year, he was appointed Adjutant of one of the three districts, into which Virginia was then divided, with the rank of Major. In his 21st year, he was sent by Governor Dinwiddie, with plenary powers to examine into the encroch∣ments, reported to have been made by the French and Indians, on the Frontiers of Virginia; to treat with the latter, and to warm the former against future aggressions. His journal and report to the Governor have been published. The next year, 1754, he was appointed Colonel of a Regiment, raised for the defence of the Frontiers▪ he signalized himself at Fort-Necessity, by a sally, in which he defeated an army much superi∣or to his own. In 1755, he acted as Aid-de-Camp, to General Brad∣dock, and attended him in that capacity in the battle, in which he fell. Not an officer, whose duty obliged him to be mounted that day, except Colonel WASHINGTON, escaped death or wounds. The conducting of the retreat devolved upon him; it was effected with a judgment, which acquired him a high reputation, both in Great-Britain, and America. Such was the fatigue he underwent in the day of action, and the suc∣ceeding night, that he was obliged, the next morning, to be supported on his horse with cushions.—The government of Virginia, soon after this period, gave him the command of all the troops raised, and to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the Colony.—He defended the Frontiers, with skill and judg∣ment, until the year 58; in this year he commanded the Van-brigade <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> General Forbes, in the capture of Fort Du-Quesne. By this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> was restored to the Frontiers of Virginia. The health <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> WASHINGTON, being greatly impaired, he resigned his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in 1759.</NOTE> Monongalia, thy proud forests first saw the youthful hero impatient for the conflict; saw him firm and

undaunted amid superior foes; saw him, snatch from an entire destruction the shattered remnant of a brave, but ill-conducted army.</P>
<P>The fatal battle in which Braddock fell, was only the pre∣lude to those torrents of blood, which flowed from the contest of two vast, but rival powers. WASHINGTON, now com∣mander of all the forces raised in Virginia, continued the ca∣reer of military glory, which he had so happily commenced, until his constitution, naturally strong and robust, became de∣bilitated, by incessant fatigue, and the unusual hardship to which he was exposed. He was thus compelled to retire from the service of his country, attended with the sincere regret of all his companions in arms. But this retirement was only a preparation for the august theatre, upon which he was after∣wards to appear. It would be delightful, could we attend him in this retirement; could we here trace out the steps which his philosophic mind pursued in the acquisition of useful know∣ledge. Hitherto Turenne, Malborough and Eugene, had been his preceptors. I know with what ardency in the early stage of his life, he followed them thro' every campaign, retraced their battles, and thus served under those illustrious men. WASHINGTON has often been supposed to have made, a Ca∣millus, a Fabius or an Emilius his prototype. I believe, that he was himself destined to be a high example to mankind, and that the native strength of his own mind soated above imitation; but still it is probable, that his knowledge in tactics was great∣ly perfected during this period of retirement, by cultivating an acquaintance with the most distinguished commanders of anti∣ent and modern times. Nor can it be doubted, that politics, the true principles of all lawful governments, and especially the rights and interests of America, often occupied his active and penetrating mind. No one had a firmer hold of the chain of causes and effects. No one saw with more clearness, the astonishing progress of America, in population and in wealth; or better knew how to estimate the operating causes. Perhaps his eagle eye saw, that this vast continent could not long revolve round a small spot in the ocean. But, whatever may have been the pre-sentiment of his mind, it is certain, that in this retirement, he cultivated all those social virtues, which attach man to man, and faithfully discharged those duties which a good citizen owes to his country; nor is it less certain, that he con∣tinued, without interruption, the active friend of religion, and at no time forgetful of his God.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="037876_0007_100F5F687826D120"/>
During this retirement, a blind policy was preparing the way for an event the most important in the annals of the world. It is wonderful to consider, how often the agency of causes, which men put in motion, produce results the most opposite to their intentions, and which baffle all calculation. Ambition forms her plans of subjugation, and anticipates her triumphs; but, they are controuled by an all wise and over-ruling Pro∣vidence; instead of oppression and misery, there often spring forth liberty, social order and social happiness.</P>
<P>That war, in which WASHINGTON had taken his first les∣sons in the military art was concluded, in the year '61. The prosperity of the American colonies had continued to flow with a quick current amid all the devastations of war. The progress of population, of commerce, of improvement in the most use∣full of all arts, agriculture, had received an impulse, which could not be restrained. An enthusiastic affection for the pa∣rent-country had taken deep root. The sons of America had fought and conquered with the armies of Britain. Their feel∣ings and their interests had been interwoven with new strength during the hour of danger and the triumphs of victory. But the tide of affection did not long continue at the height to which at had risen. An attempt in '64, to tax America, in a man∣ner unconstitutional and incompatible with political liberty, aroused the vigilance of the colonies.</P>
<P>At this crisis, observe, fellow-citizens, Virginia first saw the lurking poison, and first dared to propose the first American Congress that ever met. At her request it met at New-York in '65. By the wisdom and the firmness of that Congress, the particular measure, which had excited such irritation in Ame∣rica, was abandoned. But the abandonment was attended with a declaration, that the right of Britain to bind America by laws and statutes, was unlimited, or extended to all cases whatever. An assumption of power, so big with disgrace and ruin, was viewed by America with horror and indignation. In vain did reason and eloquence, on both sides of the Atlantic, demonstrate and deplore the calamities, which would ensue from an attempt to enforce this assumed right. It was attempt∣ed.—The patriotism of Boston foiled the attempt, and whelm∣ed the insidious bait in the briny deep. Infatuated councils saw not, that an obstinate perseverance in this mad system of poli∣tical ambition, would give to the world an example the most instructive; an example which would rouse nations from their lethargy, shew to them their own strength, teach them those
<PB N="9" REF="037876_0008_100F5F6BF3238998"/>
primeval rights which men hold only from nature's charter, and awake the spirit to vindicate them.—Then was the voice of Hen∣ry heard. Then was heard the thunder of that eloquence, which shook this continent. His great soul, burning with the concen∣tered rays of wisdom and of patriotism, first proclaimed the me∣ditated treason against the majesty of the people. Immortal Locke! Thine was the glory to arm the orator with the sacred panoply of truth. Nor to him alone were thy energies confined. Thy hallowed page dear to liberty, to virtue, and to religion, shed intellectual light over this western world, and taught a lesson congenial to the first sentiments of man. The American mind too, nursed in the bosom of independence, spurned any other controul than that which was founded on legitimate go∣vernment. At this eventful crisis, Virginia again stood fore∣most in the cause of liberty. Like another Athens watching over the safety of all Greece, and inspiring courage by her councils, Virginia first proposed a Congress of the different states—</P>
<P>It met. A dreadful appeal to Heaven drew near. A day of mourning and intercession was appointed, and observed with an awful solemnity. "God! Give the people one heart and one mind, firmly to oppose every invasion of American rights," was the prayer then enjoined and addressed to the throne of grace. In vain were the reasonings and the entreaties of that august Assembly of statesmen, patriots and heroes who were now consulting for the general interests of America, and who so eminently distinguished themselves for their moderation, their firmness and their wisdom. Whose breast is so callous as not to be touched with the noble sentiments, the profound reason∣ing, the manly energetic style, the sacred ardor in the cause of liberty which have immortalized their records. They are ex∣amples to all generations, and will remain for ever, monuments of human genius and human virtue. Virginia saw that the moment had arrived, when the rights of freemen, Heaven's sa∣cred gift, were to be yielded or defended with a courage wor∣thy of such a prize. "To die she said, is common to all, but to die bravely is peculiar to few. Let us not then regard our lives as what properly belongs to us, but by exposing them for the public cause, let us acquire a renown which shall be pecu∣liar and truly our own. Let us again prove, that an handful of freemen contending for their rights, is more powerful than a host, numerous as the sands of the sea, laboring with infamy to infringe them."—A third time she rose in all the strength of liberty, and first proposed the declaration of Independence.
<PB N="10" REF="037876_0009_100F5F6D77C3DD18"/>
Nay, she alone, with a patriotic courage, which astonishes even at this day, took the bold resolution to sever herself from Britain, and to meet every danger in defence of her rights. The great council of America, soon saw the necessity of a similar decision.—America, be thou Independent; take thy place a∣mong the nations of the earth, was the high decree. Nor let it be forgot, that the voice of WASHINGTON, sanctioned the decree.—To arms, to arms, re-echoed throughout the conti∣nent. At this awful moment, when the sword was to reek with kindred blood, what were the agonizing pangs which wrung every heart!—Ah! Ye whom the hand of Providence hath still preserved to this day, ye can tell; ye can recall the memory of times, which tried men's souls. But the spirit of America, like the daring eagle, mounted as the storm advan∣ced, pierced the thick clouds with inbred lightning fraught, and from aloft, beheld the promised land of liberty and peace. It was then, America hailed WASHINGTON, as her conduc∣tor through the tempests of war. Like the chosen leader of the Israelites, reposing in his God, he obeyed the voice. To him it was ever sacred. But what were his feelings at this mo∣ment! The sea of troubles through which he must pass, lay before him.—On one side, he saw vast superiority in numbers, wealth unbounded, lust of domination insatiable, armies inured to war and to conquest, fleets which waved their triumphant banners over the ocean, and which vexed with their prows, the most distant seas; on the other, he saw a people thinly scattered over an extensive continent, without arms, without funds, without a regular government to concenter their force, without fleets, with no other allies, than their own courage, their virtuous oaths, their love of liberty, and their confidence in the righteousness of their cause.—But, ardent in the defence of the rights of his country, animated with the true spirit of exalted patriotism, he emplored the assistance of Heaven, and hastened to the post assigned him. Never was there one more perilous. Never was there one, which so called for all those great qualities of the soul, which command the admiration of the world. Never was there a trust reposed, on which depended issues so momentous. On the wisdom, the integrity, the pru∣dence, the fortitude of one man, hung the destiny of this wes∣tern world. True glory is always modest and simple. No∣thing but the noble principle of obedience to the will of his country, could have induced him, to accept such a trust, or to appear as the chief vindicator of American liberty. His mag∣nanimity
<PB N="11" REF="037876_0010_100F5F6F01137788"/>
was no less evinced by not declining the immense weight of the office to which he had been called, than his dis∣interestedness was, by a refusal to accept any pecuniary com∣pensation during the war.</P>
<P>No sooner had he arrived at the American army, than he diffused order through every department. The same greatness of soul, which attended him throughout the war, manifested it∣self in the wisdom of his first arrangements, and the measures which he took to expel the enemy from Boston. Success crowned his efforts. But trials, which might have shaken the soul of a Joshua, a Maccabeus, or an Epaminond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, now await∣ed him.—An hostile army, the most formidable in numbers, in discipline, in all the apparatus of war, commanded by a Ge∣neral, brave, skillful and enterprising, had landed on our shores. It was now, that the horrors of war were to rage in all their fury, and the plains of America, to be drenched with human blood. Ah! Soon did those horrors commence. Misfortune, for a long time, hovered round the banners of America. In vain did patriotism animate troops half disciplined, half armed, and inferior in number. From Long-Island, from New-York and through the Jersies, discomfiture attended the American arms. Yet, amid these defeats, a courage was displayed, which was worthy of the first efforts of men struggling in the cause of humanity. Full many a hoary Father wept the un∣timely fate of his gallant son. Full many a widowed matron was left the sad monument of woe. Fathers, Mothers, Wives, ye too, tender babes, whose tongues had just learned to lisp a Father's name, your virtuous tears flowed not in vain. They plead with Angel eloquence in their country's cause. Heaven itself saw and pitied the sufferings, and the impending dangers of America.—Driven from Long-Island beyond the Delaware, his army reduced to a few brave and faithful com-patriots, des∣pondence and dismay marked every countenance, except that of WASHINGTON. Superior to events, which seemed more than sufficient to shake the stoutest hearts, they served only to arouse, and to call forth the strength of WASHINGTON's ge∣nius. It was in this crisis of weakness, of despondency and dismay, when the rigour of winter seemed to oppose insurmoun∣table obstacles, when the spirit of Delaware's angry flood, shrieked loud, and threatened destruction, that WASHINGTON, attended by a few faithful heroes, formed the bold resolution to defy every difficulty, to cross the enraged flood, to attack the victorious foe, and to snatch from him, an Immortal Victory,
<PB N="12" REF="037876_0011_100F5F71658AE6A0"/>
in the midst of his triumphs. The design was formed and ex∣ecuted with a celerity, a judgment and a fortitude, which was crowned with complete success.—This was the first moment that presented the possibility of victory. It was seized. The bold and gallant achievement astonished the enemy, revived the American spirit, and opened the door to still greater enterprise. Reinforcements succeeded this first vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ry. WASHINGTON, returned to Trenton, where he had just acquired so much glory. The active enemy, breathing revenge for their late misfortune, hasten also to the same place, and arrive on the same evening, with a force greatly superior. The setting sun beheld Trenton containing the two hostile armies, separated only by a small stream. What a crisis! The returning light of the next morn, threatened a period to the hopes of America. Destruction or cap∣tivity seemed inevitable. Scarce could the brave sons of Ameri∣rica refrain from censuring the rashness of their commander. They cast their eyes upon each other, upon their arms, and upon their country. "The scoffs of the conquerors; their haughty looks, when disarmed, they should be led through the hostile lines," the loathsome jail, or the murderous prison-ship, all arose before their eyes. One consolation remained. They could die in defence of their country.—But the Genius of WASHINGTON, ever invigorated by difficulties, here display∣ed its native force. A situation so perilous, was to him only the means of acquiring new glory. A retreat would have been ignominious, a battle, fatal. See the event. At the return of day, a moment which his enemy had so anxiously anticipated—WASHINGTON, was a conqueror, on the plains of Prince∣ton. He who appeared destined to certain captivity, was thundering upon his enemy in a distant quarter, and gain∣ing new laurels. I do not say, that this exploit was worthy of the sagacity of an Hannibal, or the wisdom of a Scipio. It was worthy of WASHINGTON; it will be it∣self an example to succeeding ages, and will forever retain the full verdure of glory. A kind Providence forwarded in an astonishing manner, an enterprize the most distinguished for that quickness of penetration, which enables great minds to convert circumstances, apparently the most in-auspicious, into such as are most favorable. This brilliant victory evinced the deep resources of WASHINGTO'NS mind, and excited the universal admiration and applause of a people who loved and re∣vered him; whilst his enemy saw, and had the generosity to ac∣knowledge the pre-eminence of talents, so dangerous to them∣selves,
<PB N="13" REF="037876_0012_100F5F7550B91CD8"/>
but so invaluable to his country. Can we look back with cold indifference upon events so recent, at which the American heart once rebounded with joy, felt the full debt of gratitude to Heaven, and fervently expressed that gratitude in praise and thanksgiving?—Can we forget the man, whom Heaven select∣ed as the instrument of its loving kindness towards us? No! Sooner shall gratitude cease to be a virtue; sooner shall the love and admiration of heroic deeds, of all those exalted talents which give dignity to man, be obliterated from the human breast.</P>
<P>Thus did a campaign, which in its beginning, threatened un∣conditional subjugation, in it's end, present a prospect the most animating and consolatory to the friends of liberty. The cause of America had now attracted the attention of the world. Her armies had evinced a spirit worthy of such a cause; her enemies had been compelled to retrace their path of victory; whilst WASHINGTON, tranquil in danger, sure in council, superior in his views and resources, had acquired the unbounded love, veneration and confidence of his fellow soldiers, had command∣ed the respect of his enemies, and proved that he was worthy of the high trust committed to him. It was this love, this ve∣neration, this confidence, daily increasing, as his talents and his virtues, were more and more developed which formed the treasury of America. Yes, ye brave and virtuous defenders of your country, ye companions of the illustrious WASHINGTON, I call you to witness, that amid all your sufferings, this devo∣tion to your chief was your bond of union, your support, and your reward, whether ye lay contented on the frozen earth, or marked your way by the blood-stained ground on which ye trod, or caught in haste a scanty morsel, still, amidst all your privations, your attachment to your commander, founded on the just admiration of his heroic virtues, supported you in every trial, consoled you under every difficulty, and animat∣ed you with a patriotic enthusiasm in the day of battle. This command of the affections of brave and virtuous men, this en∣tire possession of the heart of every soldier, thisun bounded vene∣ration for their chief, whilst it forms the greatest glory of a general, converts each soldier into a hero. He seizes, as an example for himself, the great model which his general exhi∣bits. His temperance, his self command in the heat of battle, his patience in sufferings, his prudence, his magnanimity, his ardent patriotism, infuse themselves into every breast, give an elevation to the mind, a dignity, a confidence, a spirit, which
<PB N="14" REF="037876_0013_100F5F76D54BB0D0"/>
converts man into a new being, communicates to every power a new energy, and creates a force wonderful and irresistible. Such was the agency of WASHINGTON's Genius. It possess∣ed a creative power, which assimilated every thing to itself; or, which called forth in others, talents they felt not before. His very presence inspired fortitude. No one approached him, but felt the spirit of heroism transfused into his bosom. I think I see at this moment, the brave soldier, as he passes, hail him as his Father, Friend and Champion; I think I see him, rise to redeem his country, exult in his martial exercise, and with a holy fervency calling down blessings on his commander's honored head, pant again to fight for freedom, or for freedom die.</P>
<P>But if WASHINGTON had hitherto discovered talents won∣derfully great in seizing with promtitude, the first avenues to success, or of profiting from the smallest inadvertence of a Ge∣neral, deservedly high in military estimation; the time had now arrived, when the caution of a Fabius, or rather, a cauti∣on so peculiar to himself, was to be displayed. His inferiority in numbers, and in all the equipments of war, compelled him to take a position on the strong grounds of Morristown. It is doubtful whether he manifested greater talents as a commander, in this situation, or in those scenes of brilliant action which we have just mentioned. No one knew better the value of that golden curb, which discretion hangs on bravery. A ge∣neral engagement, which the enemy so ardently solicited, would, in all probability, have extinguished for ever the bright flame of liberty. To the invading army, procrastination was defeat. In vain did the impetuosity of the American councils urge him to battle. Nothing could move the soul of WASH∣INGTON, but the spirit of wisdom, which ever calm and serene, had determined him now to be content with checking the movements of the enemy, and to maintain a war of caution. It was this caution, so full of prudence and military skill, which, continually baffling the designs of the enemy, compell∣ed them to embark, and to attempt to gain Philadelphia by sea. The attempt forced WASHINGTON from his strong posts. The battle of Brandy-wine ensued. The value of our troops was unshaken, but the event was not fortunate for the Ameri∣can arms. There are casualties, which human prudence can∣not always controul, but upon which, the issues of battles of∣ten depend. One of these occurred. A false intelligence prevented the execution of a design, the most bold in its
<PB N="15" REF="037876_0014_100F5F79364F2AF0"/>
nature; but so admirably planned, that had an attempt been made to carry it into effect, victory, and not defeat, would have been the result. Nor were the actions of German-town, and of Monmouth less signalized for the skill of the general, and the valor of his troops, than for those un∣toward events which defeated their hopes. WASHINGTON had not always the glory of success; but he had the glory of appearing to deserve it. The wisdom of his measures was ne∣ver doubted; success, O God! Depends upon thy Providence.</P>
<P>But, Fellow-Citizens, we should not do justice to the ta∣lents, or the virtues of WASHINGTON, were we to confine our view to those scenes only in which he himself was the prin∣cipal actor. During the progress of a war, which raged from the frozen walls of Quebec to the burning sands of Savannah, the penetrating eye of WASHINGTON saw every movement; his comprehensive mind took in the vast whole; his councils were received as the monitions of an oracle; whilst, from his ex∣ample, sprung up heroes in every quarter. The enemy had soon, every where, if not a WASHINGTON to contend with, at least one who gloried in following the exalted model. His knowlege of human nature gave him the command of talents where-ever they appeared; whilst his magnanimity rendered him always the first to announce the merit of others, and to participate in their triumphs. Whose bosom glows with the virtuous pride of being a citizen of America, and remembers not the gallantry of Greene, at Red-Bank; or the noble de∣fence of Smith at Mud-Island? Who bears not in vivid memo∣ry the victors of Saratoga, or him who rescued South-Carolina from the fangs of the lion? Who calls not to mind, the brave, the virtuous, but unfortunate Fayette?—Thou too, lamented Mercer, shalt live immortal in the memory of America. Thy wounds, received in the bloody contest, which preceded the revolutionary war, had already evinced thy courage and thy patriotism. Ah! Weltering in thy blood, abandoned in the midst of the inhospitable wilderness, the deadly serpent thy on∣ly food; what but a kind Providence could have preserved thee from such perils! It did preserve thee, long to live the delight of society, and to become the firm vindicator of liberty. Yes, the hand of God, preserved thee, again to unite thy arms with WASHINGTON, and to pour forth thy gallant, but gentle soul, on the plains of Princeton, covered with glory.</P>
<P>Would time permit, I could here, with that joy, which the love of noble deeds inspires, trace a long line of heroes, whose
<PB N="16" REF="037876_0015_100F5F7AC004B708"/>
names will be for ever dear to America, and whose energies WASHINGTON saw, combined, and thus produced a force constant in it's action, and irresistible in it's effects. Recall the image of this illustrious man; behold him, when not brav∣ing the dangers of the field, seated in council, deep deliberati∣on engraven on his countenance; see him giving life and mo∣tion to distant armies, and incessantly directing every thing to the political salvation of his country. He seems another Ar∣chimedes, sitting on the shore, and moving at pleasure a vast ship, on an ocean tossed with tempest, whilst he himself is immoveable.</P>
<P>A just eulogium of WASHINGTON requires a detail of the actions of his life. The wonderful properties the inimitable beauties of those rays which enlighten and animate all nature to be seen in their full lustre, must be viewed separately. This detail, this separated view of the luminous actions of WASH∣INGTON must be left to the judicious and impartial historian. The time with which you have already favored me, admo∣nishes me to hasten to that scene of glory, which still awaited our beloved fellow-citizen, and which by closing the bloody drama, established, we trust in God, for ever, pure republican∣ism in this western world. That last scene was reserved for Virginia. Her favorite son was destined, in her bosom, to re∣ceive the reward of all his toils; and to finish in her sight, his career of military glory. I will not open wounds which are but just healed, I will not awake the feelings of the friend, the orphan or the parent; nor will I call to mind the accumulated distress which mourned throughout this land. Suf∣fice it to say, that a superior and a gallant foe, the conqueror of India, spread terror and desolation on every side. WASHING∣TON saw the decisive moment; he saw, that Providence had, at length, presented the opportunity of closing the sufferings of his country. With a decision; a profoundness of judgment, which astonishes, he projected and formed with his brave and generous allies, a plan apparently the most difficult in its exe∣cution, and which, to common apprehension, would have in∣dicated only the feebleness of vanity and folly. A powerful enemy in New-York, was to be kept in a state of alarm, for his safety; allied troops were to be assembled at the same mo∣ment, not only from a distant quarter on the continent, but from Islands still more remote; a fleet, which gallantly aided in the great design, was to second every movement, and to as∣sume it's place at the appointed time; his own troops, by rapid
<PB N="17" REF="037876_0016_100F5F7DDAA29698"/>
marches, were to ensure their arrival at the period affixed; the militia of Virginia, provisions of all kinds, were to be collected. How many powers were here to be combined! What difficul∣ty in their arrangement! What prudence in adjusting means so discordant! What secrecy in the execution!—The mind of WASHINGTON was superior to every difficulty. The hostile army beheld themselves surrounded by a force, which ensured their captivity, before they suspected the design. Nothing more clearly evinces the strength of mind, which this extraordinary man possessed than the sure calculation which he had made of the result of all his measures, and also, of the consequences which would attend the success of this bold, but well concerted enter∣prize. Weak minds, ever vacillating, find their emblem in the Aspin's leaf. They have no center of repose. That of WASHINGTON was self-poised; it felt its own weight, and rested upon its own determinations. The Admiral of the allied forces hesitated, whether he should keep the station as∣signed to him. America should often review the letter, which WASHINGTON wrote to him from this city. Hear it fellow citizens. "I am unable to describe the painful anxiety under which I have laboured, since the reception of your letter. It obliges me <HI>warmly</HI> to urge a perseverance in the plan agreed upon. The attempt upon York, under the protection of your shipping, is as certain of success, as a superior force, and a su∣periority of measures can render any military operation. The capture of the British army is a matter so important in itself, and <HI>in it's consequences,</HI> that it must greatly tend to put an end to the war." After pointing out the certain and fatal event, which would follow the removal of the allied fleet, he adds: "I earnestly beg your Excellency to consider, that if by moving your fleet from the situation agreed upon, we lose the present opportunity, we shall never hereafter have it in our power to strike so decisive a blow, and the period of an honorable peace will be farther distant than ever." He then assures the Admi∣ral, that he had nothing to fear from the fleet of the enemy, however superior, stationed as he was; and then concludes: "I am to press your Excellency to persevere in the scheme so happily concerted between us."—This letter was the anchor of victory. WASHINGTON, with his brave allies, advanced to York. They came, they saw, they conquered.</P>
<P>Then did America exclaim, "If God be for us, who can be against us." Yes, Great God, then was thy providential kind∣ness manifested; then was it felt and adored by all; but by none
<PB N="18" REF="037876_0017_100F28AB707964B0"/>
with more ardor, or more humility, than by him, who had been selected as the chief instrument in thy hands, for the esta∣blishment of liberty in this new world. "Let said he, Divine Service be performed to morrow, in the different Brigades and Divisions. The Commander in Chief recommends, that all the troops, which are not upon duty, do assist at it with a serious deportment, and <HI>that sensibility of heart, which the recollection of the surprising and particular interposition of providence in our favor claims."</HI> His thanks are then tendered to the whole army, in the warmest language; and let it be remembered, that the mi∣litia of Virginia, with their Governor and General, the virtu∣ous and the patriotic Nelson, received, in a particular manner, his sincere acknowledgments of their brave and zealous co-ope∣ration.</P>
<P>Joy, like the rapid lightning, ran from one extremity of the continent to the other. Every house of public worship resound∣ed with grateful praises and thanksgivings to the God of battles. Every heart called for blessings on the head of WASHING∣TON. Every American now began to hail the glorious consum∣mation of all his hopes. The vindicators of liberty now saw, that the storm which had so long desolated their country, and deluged it with blood, was rapidly subsiding; the horizon be∣gan to gleam around, and promised the speedy effulgence of the brightest day, which ever illuminated this earth.</P>
<P>That day soon arrived. It was the day which witnessed the acknowledgment of the Freedom, the Sovereignty, and the Independence, of the different states of America.</P>
<P>Is the orb of WASHINGTON's glory now full? No! It is increasing in splendor. How many victors have found a Ru∣bicon, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se small current only tempted it's passage; and when once▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ssed, how oft has a mad ambition tossed the laws and libertie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the people in the air!—The integrity of WASHINGTON was a rock, in the midst of the ocean, which could not be moved.—His patriotism was as firm as the conti∣nent he had saved. He was now to give another example to succeeding ages, another proof of the reality, and the greatness of his virtues. By his prudence, he first drew off silently the wrath of military tumult; it was an angry cloud, which might have been terrific to this country, had not WASHINGTON, like the immortal Franklin, known how to avert it's fury. No sooner had the veterans of America, unrecompensed as they were for all their labours and their sufferings, resumed the cha∣racter of citizens, than their beloved commander repaired to
<PB N="19" REF="037876_0018_100F5F839B3FBD10"/>
Congress—Behold him, Fellow-Citizens, in this exalted act of patriotic duty. See him with a modesty and a dignity of man∣ners, so peculiar to himself, rising in the august council of America, delivering an address replete with the noblest senti∣ments, and unrobing himself, of all his military authority. "Happy, said he, in the confirmation of our Independence and Sovereignty, and pleased with the opportunity afforded the United States, of becoming a respectable nation, I resign with satisfaction the appointment I accepted with diffidence, a diffi∣dence in my abilities to accomplish so arduous a task; which however was superseded by a confidence in the rectitude of our cause, the support of the Supreme power in the union, and the patrionage of Heaven."</P>
<P>"The successful termination of the war, has verified the most sanguine expectations; and my gratitude for the interpo∣sition of Providence, and the assistance I have received from my countrymen, increases with every review of the momentous contest." He concludes with saying, "I consider it as an in∣dispensible duty to close this last act of my official life, by com∣mending the interests of our dear country to the protection of Almighty God, and those who have the superintendence of them, to his Holy keeping. Having now finished the work assigned, I retire from the great theatre of action, and bidding an affectionate farewell, to this august body, under whose or∣ders I have so long acted, I here offer my commission, and take my leave of all the employments of public life."</P>
<P>The thousand emotions, which crowded upon the minds of all present, rendered the scene awfully impressive. The an∣swer of the President was delivered with a sensibility, which almost suppressed utterance. It was a just tribute to the many virtues, military and civil of the illustrious WASHINGTON, and deserves to be engraved upon his tomb.</P>
<P>The acclamations of a grateful country, the applause and the admiration of the world, attended him to the peaceful walks of private life. Tyranny only trembled at the lesson he had taught; a lesson, said the President of Congress, equally useful to those who inflict, and to those who feel oppression. Yes, Fellow-Citizens, the eloquent lesson, which he taught, caused those scales, with which the false lustre of power had obscured the vision of men, to drop from their eyes. The American revolution, like another Ananias, seems to have been sent by Heaven, to open the eyes of the universe.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="037876_0019_100F5F85E5556368"/>
Hitherto, Fellow-Citizens, you have admired the departed, but immortal WASHINGTON, as a commander. Follow his steps still further, and you will equally admire him as the states∣man and the sage.</P>
<P>II. When the interests of America indicated a closer union of those sovereignties, which the revolution had established, Virginia, ever watchful over the general prosperity, and faith∣ful to her principles, again stood foremost. This is the fourth time, that she first suggested to her equals, the adoption of mea∣sures, which were essential to the liberties, the prosperity, and the aggrandizement of all. Great God! We thank thee, that reason, and not arms, is the force which hath hitherto directed the political movements of a virtuous and enlightened people. The general council which was proposed, met. WASHING∣TON was again called into the service of his country, and una∣nimously elected President of an assembly of men, illustrious for their talents and their patriotism. From this assembly, eman∣ed the present constitution of the Federal Government. He who never solicited and office, was solicited by all America, to accept the important office of President of the United States. With what diffidence he received this testimony of the confi∣dence, the love and the veneration of a free and independent people, is in the memory of every one; nor is the exultation, which spread, like the break of morning light, less strongly re∣collected. To see WASHINGTON again at the head of the American people, no longer clad in armour, but seated in the curule chair, giving energy to the laws of the Union, and stability to the liberty he had vindicated, watching over the interests of all, harmonizing discordant states, establishing order and method in every department, and thus making a fair but grand experiment of the subserviency of the newly created go∣vernment to the general happiness, was a spectacle the most dignified, as well as the most grateful to every heart. With what assiduity he devoted himself to the duties of his office; with what consummate prudence and judgment, he directed the legi∣timate powers entrusted to him, to their proper ends, let the voice of his country declare. Let the policy pursued, whilst Europe, maddening with contention, was convulsed to her centre; and whilst conflicting nations were laboring to plunge this country into the whirlpool of war, testify the wis∣dom, the magninimity and the patriotism of its conductor.—Peace with all nations, close connections with none, union among ourselves, measures favorable to commercial intercourse,
<PB N="21" REF="037876_0020_100F5F8769DF8738"/>
both internal and external, a militia properly organized, not extensive military establishments, institutions to develope and to extend the powers of the intellect, and to diffuse knowledge; These were the objects which engaged his attention, and form∣ed the basis of his policy. During his administration, it is true, that parties, the concomitants of all free governments, arose. WASHINGTON too had his party; it was that of the public good. He was the chief magistrate of a whole nation, and not of a part of that nation. Onward he bent his steady course, inflexible in the pursuit of what he deemed just and proper, conscious of his own integrity, relying upon the favour of Hea∣ven, and affording an example of that rare assemblage, or rather constellation of virtues, which will and must be the admiration of ages.</P>
<P>Was then WASHINGTON exempt from error? This I do not say. He was a man; and consequently had the infirmities of man. But this I do believe, and think the whole tenor of his life justifies the belief; that, if he did err, his errors were never intentional. Human wisdom, and human virtue claim no higher prerogative. To Heaven only infalibility belongs. But tho' WASHINGTON may have erred, he had the merit of extracting glory even from his errors. How worthy of a great soul are the following sentiments, which he delivers in his last Address? <Q>Tho', says he, in reviewing the incidents of my administration, I am unconscious of intentional error: I am nevertheless too sensible of my defects, not to think it proba∣ble, that I may have committed many errors. Whatever they may be, I servently beseech the Almighty to avert or mitigate the evils to which they may tend. I shall also carry with me the hope, that my country will never cease to view them with indulgence; and that forty-five years of my life having been dedicated to its service, with an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be consigned to oblivion, as my∣self must soon be to the mansions of rest.</Q></P>
<P>Twice called to the presidential office, his Fellow-Citizens waited only for the return of that day, on which they should exercise the sovereign right of election, again to clothe him with the same honors. But, more anxious to enjoy the rights of a private citizen than the honors of office, wearied too with the long and laborious service, which had constantly occupied his mind, and desirous to spend the evening of his day in domestic tranquility, he announced his intention of retiring. He did not however forget, that he still owed to his country an important
<PB N="22" REF="037876_0021_100F5F89BA91ED50"/>
duty. This was discharged by an address worthy of WASH∣INGTON. It contains the outlines of the policy he pursued, when in office, and which I have attempted slightly to sketch. It contains also, admonitions the most wise, founded on long experience and deep reflection; admonitions, which ought to be indelibly imprinted upon the mind of every American. It is the advice of the father of American liberty, no less illustrious, as a statesman and a sage, than as a commander in war. America, hear this sentence. "Of all the dispositions and habits, which tend to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispen∣sible supports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of pa∣triotism, who should labor to subvert those great pillars of hu∣man happiness, those firmest props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician ought to respect and cherish them. A volume could not trace their connection with private and public felicity." The mind of WASHINGTON saw, that re∣publicanism without morality was a chimera; and that morality without religion was as evanescent as the baseless fabric of a vi∣sion; he saw, that the morality, the virtue which republics require, must have its utmost link fastened to the footstool of the throne of God.—May the hearts of all be open to this great truth! When WASHINGTON becomes a preacher, who will not listen. O! Ye who love your country, and labour for the preservation of her liberties; ye too, who surrendering your∣selves to your passions, have sacrificed your judgments to your zeal, come to this pure fountain of reason; it will quench your animosities; look into it as it flows, it will be a mirror to shew you the path to public good; it will reflect the bright image of that eternal justice, which ought to rule the universe. Yes, Fellow-Citizens, it is by the observance of principles contained in this last address, that the happiness of the people, in these states, under the auspices of liberty, will be complete; and <HI>that</HI> free Constitution, the work of their own hands, will be so sacredly maintained and preserved, I use the words of WASH∣INGTON, as will acquire to them the glory of recommending it to the applause, the affection and the adoption of every nation which is yet a stranger to it.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON retired; but he carried along with him, the sentiments which a dutiful citizen ever owes to his country. Impending dangers, during, this retirement, alarmed America. WASHINGTON was again ready to protect her with his shield, and old as he was, to lead her armies to the field of battle.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="037876_0022_10117008D418E9A8"/>
III. But, that we may do justice to WASHINGTON, as a sage, and the truly good man, we must view him also in pri∣vate life. When man is placed upon an elevated theatre, the eyes of the world, the glory of success, give to his soul a force, and a grandeur, which is often foreign to it. Pride borrows the sentiments of virtue; we do not see the person, but the personage. How many have acted as heroes at the head of ar∣mies, or appeared more than men, when conscious that they attracted universal attention; and yet in the shade of retire∣ment, in their common intercourse with society, have shewn that they were less than men, devoid of all that real moral worth, which constitutes human excellency. To WASHING∣TON, the shade of retirement was as luminous as that of the most public theatre. It was here, that his soul, unbent, dis∣played all those virtues, which are the ornament and the de∣light of society. Humane, charitable, wise and just, in every situation, he was always consistent, always equal to himself, al∣ways evincing, that rectitude of conduct was his sovereign good. The poor found in him a guardian, genius a patron, the honest and the meritorious a friend; the dissolute the impi∣ous and the profane, always an enemy. Sincerely religious, his attendance upon the service of his God, was the dictate of real piety. Immutably true, he could respect only truth in others. It was to him, the first duty of man. Such his mo∣desty, that whilst he was the admiration of all, he alone, like Moses, descended from the mount, seemed ignorant of the light which shone around him. Such his prudence, that not a word, not an action escaped him, which would not admit of a rational justification. This singular character of reason accom∣panied him through life. Yes, Brethren, it was in WASH∣INGTON, that those four cardinal virtues, justice, prudence, temperance and fortitude, formed an union so rare, and so com∣plete. To these virtues, was added an understanding, the most clear and extensive. His various official communications, his addresses to his countrymen, his answers to the innumera∣ble congratulations which he received, all of which are suffici∣ent to form volumes; what ever came from his pen, whilst it was always distinguished by a style the most perspicuous, the most strong and manly, evinced at the same time, a vast mind, a superior intellect, which could grasp every thing, and which laboured incessantly to promote public and private felicity.</P>
<P>Such was, in part, the illustrious citizen, who filled so wide and so honorable a space in the eye of America, and of the ci∣vilized
<PB N="24" REF="037876_0023_101170075047CD08"/>
world; and whose loss a nation this day deplores. I know, that my attempts to do justice to his character, have fallen infinitely short, of what your affection demanded.—But, I am little conversant in the language of panegyrick. "Re∣corded honours shall gather round the monument of WASH∣INGTON, and thicken over him. It is a solid fabric, and will support the laurels that adorn it."</P>
<P>But Ah! Great and good as he was, the scene of mortal ex∣istence is closed for ever. Yes, Fellow-Citizens, your belov∣ed WASHINGTON, has finished his course. He is gone to ap∣pear before that God, in whom he trusted, and his works have followed him. Happy moment, for thee, illustrious shade! But afflictive to a nation, which mourns thy loss, and which can find it's consolation only in the rememberance of thy virtues, in an humble resignation to the decrees of an all-wise Provi∣dence, and in it's gratitude for benefits received through thy instrumentality. Long shall thy name be dear to thy country. Long shall the aged father, calling to his son, point to thy tomb, and bid him remember WASHINGTON; bid him recol∣lect thy virtues, and seize the patriotic flame, which once glowed within thy bosom. The tender mother too, hanging over her beloved son, shall drop the anxious tear, and hall the name of WASHINGTON; shall exclaim, O! Like him, be thou, brave, prudent, temperate and just. O! Be thou, like him, thy country's shield in war, it's ornament in peace. And thou, America! Incumbent as thou now art over the tomb of thy beloved citizen, mayest thou annually retrace his virtues, and consecrate his memory. May his actions be ever the ob∣jects of thy emulation and thy praise.</P>
<P>Ah! Fellow-citizens, remember that virtue only is estimable in the eyes of God; and that without it, republics are victims destined for the altars of ambition. Remember, that without just sentiments of religion, virtue perishes; a dreadful prostra∣tion of morals inevitably ensues, and with that prostration, li∣berty is gone for ever—Would you shoot an arrow at the ra∣pid lightning as it flies athwart the sky; or, would you at∣tempt to arrest the oceans tide, by a single pebble? As well might you attempt to retain virtue, the basis of private and public happiness, the rock of all rational government, without religion. Ah! In an age, when religion has become the sport of libertinism, and of philosophists; in an age, when impiety is too often considered as the first proof of brilliancy of genius; in an age, when thy religion, blessed Jesus! Is scoffed and reviled
<PB N="25" REF="037876_0024_1011700BDA7B9250"/>
by those who are ignorant of it; in an age, when even our re∣lation to a God, has been derided by wickedness and folly; in such an age, religion feels more than a momentary consolation in embracing the tomb of WASHINGTON, and in holding him forth as another immortal example, that man in his greatest perfection, is ever religious and faithful. O! Ye, who love your country, ye who would preserve for yourselves and your posterity, republicanism pure and uncontaminated, again, I en∣treat you, be it yours to cherish religion, and to bear in mind the example of WASHINGTON. Ye, who yet contemn the degrading idea, that death is an eternal sleep; ye, who do not rest upon the miserable and the dreadful hope of that destruction, that extinction of being, at the thought of which virtue trem∣bles, and the soul shrinks back with horror; ye, who can look beyond the grave, and there behold regions enlightened by the eternal meridian of God's unclouded smile;—Regions in which piety and innocence live immortal; O! Make that God your friend. Then, like your beloved Fellow-Citizen, will you be strong in virtue, and incapable of dismay; then will you, in that awful moment, which must soon tear us from all the soul holds dear in this world, be enabled, like him, to ex∣claim, "I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith. Henceforth, there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge shall give me at that day; and not to me only, but unto all them that love his appearing."</P>
