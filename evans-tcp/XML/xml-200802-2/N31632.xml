<HEAD><HI>Rachel</HI>'s Sepulchre; OR, <HI>A</HI> MEMORIAL OF Mrs. <HI>Lydia Willis,</HI> Taken, chiefly, from her Letters to Friends, on various occasions.</HEAD>
<P><HI>A DESIRE to preserve the memory of worthy and beloved Friends, especially of such as have, thro' the course of their lives, approved them∣selves the friends of God, is not only founded in nature, but seems evidently warranted in the holy Scrip∣tures. God has told us that</HI> the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">Psalms 112 6.</NOTE>; <HI>and that</HI> the memory of the just is blessed (2).—<HI>Which implies the care of Pro∣vidence, not by</HI> miracle, <HI>but by the</HI> use <HI>of</HI> proper means, <HI>in preserving the memory of such</HI> just <HI>and</HI> righteous <HI>per∣sons: While those of an opposite character, thro' neglect, are forgotten. Their very name is blotted out; as it follows,</HI> but the name of the wicked shall rot.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="041779_0002_101B294180860498"/><HI>From this principle, no doubt, and with this view, even to perpetuate the memory of his beloved</HI> Rachel, <HI>the</HI> Patriarch Jacob <HI>raised a monument over her grave,</HI> Gen. 35. 19, 20 Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath; and Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day: <HI>which was known, in after ages, to be</HI> Rachel<HI>'s sepulchre, and re∣ferred to,</HI> 1 Sam. 10. 2.</P>
<P><HI>But there are other monuments, equally durable and more instructive, due to the merits of some departed friends, which may be justly expected, as they are earnestly desired by the living; for this worthy end, that God may be glorified and praised, for his gifts and graces, bestowed on the children of men, whereby he alone makes</HI> one <HI>to differ from</HI> another.</P>
<P><HI>The</HI> monuments <HI>here intended, are the</HI> Lives <HI>and</HI> Cha∣racters <HI>of persons, whose excellent spirit, christian conver∣sation, profitable writings and good works, do furnish ma∣terials both to entertain and edify succeeding generations, who, without such memorials, would entirely miss the benefit.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tis with this view, and not without some hopes of at∣taining this end that I have, at the earnest desire of</HI> one <HI>(whom I could not deny) been persuaded to gather up some pious remains of</HI> Mrs. Lydia Willis, <HI>whose memory is precious, so far as I have known, to all her acquaintance— peculiarly so, to her beloved, surviving husband, near re∣lations and intimate friends, for whose use, more especially, these pages are designed.</HI></P>
<P>Characters, <HI>I know, are oftentimes offensive; and many unkind reflections, are occasioned thereby, both on the liv∣ing and the dead.—But why should any be offended at a</HI> character truly drawn? <HI>Why take offence, at a simple narrative of</HI> facts, <HI>or a true and faithful account of those virtues and good things, which evidently took place and
<PB N="3" REF="041779_0003_101B2943DFE7D8C0"/>
appeared, in the person's life! And this I take to be the main point, in giving a</HI> character, <HI>even to pay a sacred regard to</HI> truth <HI>in relating</HI> facts, <HI>or things that were really found, in the</HI> person <HI>described. And when all is said</HI> in truth, <HI>we mean not, thereby, to exalt and praise the</HI> man himself, <HI>but</HI> to glorify God in him.</P>
<P><HI>Wherefore, to excite the living to praise the giver of every good and perfect gift, as well as to comfort and edify her surviving friends, I shall, in simplicity of heart, give a sketch of</HI> Mrs. Willis<HI>'s Life and Character; more especially as it appears in her</HI> familiar letters, <HI>wherein the genuine breathings of her soul are the most sensibly dis∣covered, perhaps, of any way in which her ideas were communicated.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Of</HI> these <HI>I have therefore selected a number, and given the most of them at large, exactly as they were written with her own hand; except a grammatical defect hath, now and then, been supplyed. That her letters might ap∣pear in their native simplicity, I have not so much as corrected some</HI> inaccuracies, <HI>which a learned pen might have avoided.—The principal liberty that I have taken, is sometimes to</HI> exchange <HI>a</HI> word <HI>for</HI> some other, <HI>which is more expressive of what was evidently her meaning; and the</HI> word <HI>that is</HI> substituted, <HI>may be known by inver∣ted comma's, before and after it, thus "—"</HI></P>
<P><HI>But some of her letters are wholly suppressed; and in those that appear, same striking passages are omitted, on account of the singular</HI> amity <HI>and</HI> friendship, <HI>that subsisted between</HI> her <HI>and the</HI> living relative, <HI>to whom they were written; in whose hands she knew herself to be safe, tho' she wrote with the most unreserved freedom.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="041779_0004_101B294567399488"/>MRS. <HI>Lydia Willis,</HI> late virtuous Consort of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Eliakim Willis,</HI> Pastor of the se∣cond Church of <HI>Malden,</HI> after ten days sick∣ness, died there, much lamented, on the 25th of <HI>January</HI> 1767, in the 59th year of her age.</P>
<P>She was born at <HI>Duxborough,</HI> April 1709, the only Daughter of Mr. <HI>Thomas Fish</HI> of that Town deceased.</P>
<P>A Description of her person, (with some principal branches of her character) is aptly and truely drawn, by another hand, as entered at the close of this account.</P>
<P>And yet, to compleat the view of her person, there is room to add, that she was of an eligible <HI>stature</HI> and <HI>pro∣portion.</HI> Her <HI>visage</HI> comely, especially in youth, nor wholly defac'd in age.—On her <HI>countenance</HI> dwelt a peculiar <HI>seriousness</HI> and <HI>pleasancy,</HI> so agreeably composed, as to demand respect, while it sensibly invited to near∣ness and freedom of converse.</P>
<P>As a grateful acknowledgment to the father of lights, it may be said, that under the influence of a care∣ful and religious education, her youth was preserv'd from <HI>blemish.</HI> So that she entered the social life, in good repute among her companions.</P>
<P>An early taste for <HI>reading</HI> led her to acquaint herself, as opportunity favoured, with <HI>authors,</HI> polite as well as religious; the <HI>latter</HI> more especially, suited her relish and engaged her attention.—This rendered her conver∣sation edifying, while it agreeably entertained her dis∣cerning acquaintance. So that she was favoured with the best society that her rural situation and the times afforded.</P>
<P>A good talent at <HI>writing</HI> gave her the advantage of a profitable correspondence; which many special provi∣dences occasioned her frequently to improve.— Her
<PB N="5" REF="041779_0005_101B294892B231A0"/>
constitution (being of the most deligate and tender make) subjected her to habitual weakness, and frequent dis∣tressing sicknesses; which, together with numerous other adverse providences, made her indeed a woman of sor∣row and acquainted with grief.—She was a person of uncommon trials and afflictions, from her early days. Which, however, did not sink her spirits, but rather tended, for the most part, to wake up and invigorate every facul∣ty, and manifest to others, rather than herself.</P>
<P>She abounded in love and tender affections, not only to her near relations, but to all mankind.—A mind, susceptable of the deepest impressions, disposs'd her to joy and sorrow, in their turns, proportionable to every interesting event.</P>
<P>On such occasions, her letters are most expressive of what she felt.—But as crosses and afflictions were fami∣liar to her, even from her youth. These were, most frequently, the moving subjects, on which she wrote.— In a very low state of health, and under some peculiar trials, she writes, to her brother at Stonington, upon his <HI>marriage,</HI> and settlement there.</P>

<P>The next spring after this, she so far recovered her health, that she visited <HI>Stonington,</HI> where she spent the summer, very pleasantly, at her brothers, with growing endearments.—But this perhaps, served rather to encrease than abate her trials, when absent, upon returning, bodi∣ly infirmities, and other sorrows.—Her affections, that were even too tender before, are now, with greater diffi∣culty, kept under command.</P>

<P>With a blessing on means he recovered his health and strength, so far that, in a few weeks, he returned to his vessel and business, which was in the sea-faring way.— This mercy gave joy to the family; but to none more than the <HI>Sister</HI>; whose sensible feelings were not to be out-done, even by parents themselves.</P>

<P>Having buried her <HI>father,</HI> in <HI>April,</HI> 1736, which gave her deep sorrow of heart, she had the trial of part∣ing with her <HI>mother,</HI> in —, 1737.—This occasioned inexpressible grief and anguish of soul.

<P><HI>Lydia</HI> viewed this sore affliction as sent more especi∣ally on her account, designed for <HI>her</HI> chastisement, rather than for any others.

to herself, her chief dependence was upon her <HI>mother</HI>; who was unwearied in doing for her, every thing that might relieve and comfort her. But now the creature fails. — her earthly props are gone,— <HI>father</HI> and <HI>mother forsake her,</HI> and there is none, among creatures, like minded, to take her up! Now, if no higher refuge opens to view, than what the earth and creatures afford, she must be even inconsolable.— How she should be provided for, supported, and enabled to perform the re∣maining stages of life? were questions naturally arising, but not easily answered; until the Lord appeared to re∣lieve her troubled mind, by shewing that the <HI>fountain</HI> remained, tho' the <HI>streams</HI> were dried up. This conso∣lation was not entirely withheld from her, though she had not, speedily, the sensible benefit of it.</P>
<P>Under all the dark dispensations of Providence, im∣ply'd and referred to, in the foregoing <HI>letters</HI> and ac∣count, she remained very much in the dark, as to her spiritual state.—Though the spirit and sentiments of her <HI>writings,</HI> accompanied with a <HI>life</HI> agreeable to the Gos∣pel, might afford sufficient ground of charity to <HI>others,</HI> that the <HI>grace of God</HI> was with her, yet she had very little charity for <HI>herself</HI>; at least had not the comfort of knowing that God was <HI>hers,</HI> and that all these things were tokens of his love and faithfulness.—</P>
<P>But in the midst of darkness and trying afflictions, not late in life, while yet in a single state, she was, hopefully, led, more fully and clearly, to view and adore the hand that rules the world, and humbly to ac∣quiesce in all his dealings with her.—She rose in some good measure, above the frowns and flatteries of human life,—made the Lord her refuge,—his holy religion her business, and conversing with him her chifest joy.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>"Oh my dearly beloved Friends,"</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"I am distressed for you. I feel your wounds. Your sorrows are half mine. My heart bleeds, and condoles with you, under this painful rod, which infinite wisdom and love are exercising you withal.— But alass, what can your poor, afflicted, broken sister say? How shall I address myself? In what consolatory manner can I ap∣pear before you? Your fainting spirits call for rich, balmy cordials, to soften the keen anguish of your bleeding wounds. And should I summon the poor re∣mains of my feeble powers, I could do no more, but send you to the <HI>balm</HI> of <HI>the covenant,</HI> from whence, I trust, you have, thro' grace, already begun to sip divine consolation.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="041779_0031_101B29878DF7A730"/>"Your letter is expressive of the christian. You seem to enter the school of affliction, with such meekness, patience and resignation, as if you had already attained the stature of a man in Christ Jesus.—I pray we may not be deceived, in matters of such infinite importance.— The hand of love meets out our bitter cups; and by such" kind of "trials, the friends of God are proved. But afflictions cry <HI>love,</HI> in the care of conscience, after∣wards;"—(call for returns of love, or tokens of filial obedience) "oh may we be attentive listners thereto, and diligent in our researches; not suffering the least" hint or motion, "to escape our observance, as ever we expect the sanctifying fruits of the cross; for by such fiery trials, <HI>sincerity</HI> is brought to the test.—We dont know what manner of creatures we are, 'till cast into the furnace; the light whereof shews us, what to let go, and whether we love God, <HI>more than these.</HI></P>
<P>"When we list under the banners of <HI>Jesus,</HI> we" become, and "stand engaged, to give our richest trea∣sures up, without reserve. We take <HI>Jesus</HI> with his cross,— <HI>Jesus</HI> with his offices, as well as for all his benefits.— And is it not a much greater mercy, to be enabled to give up such dear young limbs,—such pleasant opening flow∣ers, into the arms of their Redeemer, than the enjoyment of them, in this ensnaring world, could possibly be?</P>
<P>"Half your <HI>dear ones</HI> are gone before you!—Oh turn your eyes from the <HI>dead</HI> to the <HI>living,</HI> and adore that <HI>goodness,</HI> which <HI>has stay'd his rough wind, in the day of the east</HI> wind.—You have pleasant children yet left.— Lord grant that they may live before thee; and may they prove double blessings in their day and genera∣tion.

<P>By the tenor of the following letter, it must be in∣tended for one of Mr. <HI>Willis</HI>'s brothers; as neither of her <HI>own</HI> has ever yet been called to the tryal of burying an <HI>only child.</HI> Tis without date; and, for aught that ap∣pears, may properly take place <HI>here.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear brother and sister,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"The tender sympathizing sense I have of the afflic∣tive providence of God upon you, in the death of your dear and <HI>only babe,</HI> excites my poor attempts to condole with you and to comfort you, under this heavy cross." You'll believe me if I tell you, "I know how to pity you, having drunk of the like bitter cup.—My bowels are troubled for you.—To <HI>such as are in affliction, pity should be shown.</HI> But oh! what can pitying <HI>friends</HI> do? How vain are <HI>their</HI> attempts to heal the keen anguish of the smarting rod? None but the hand that strikes, can cure the wound.—In <HI>Jesus</HI> there is strong consola∣tion. Thither, dear souls, I would intreat your flight, for the sanctifying influences of his holy spirit, without which you will certainly loose the benefit of the cross; which, I trust, is laid upon you for your eternal felicity— that your affections may be reduced from creature com∣forts,—from empty bubbles," and set on "the living fountain of all substantial joys, where there is safety in love; no fear of excess, nor danger of cruel death."</P>

<P>The last instance that we find, of such tender, savoury breathings of soul, towards her friends in afflicti∣on

and distress, is an unfinished letter to her brother at <HI>Stonington,</HI> as appears from an expression in it, applica∣ble to none else, in that relation.—It is but a sketch of her sentiments, at a time when her affections were most tenderly moved, at the news of his <HI>youngest daughter</HI>'s distressing sickness, of which there was but little hope of her surviving. It was found among her papers; but, probably, never compleated nor sent, or failed of coming to hand.—In a kind of tumult of tender passions she writes,
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>"Alass my dear Brother and Sister",</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"What can I say—what can I do, but love and wish and pray, that God, of his boundless rich grace, may be all, and do all, in and for you and <HI>yours,</HI> as the circumstances do or may call for.— The sorrowful news have reach'd my ears and pierced my heart, re∣specting dear Miss <HI>Becca</HI>'s sickness;—and I am now waiting for further <HI>tidings</HI>; but (for want of that holy fixed fortitude of soul, the Psalmist speaks of) I am <HI>afraid</HI> of <HI>evil ones.</HI>—The Lord prepare us all for his holy will, when and how it may be manifested.</P>
<P>"It may be you feel the powerful bands of parental ties, stronger than ever you knew before, if called to part with that lovely one, for whom you would e'en die.—Oh, methinks I hear, and see and feel the anguish of your groaning, bleeding, wounded souls, in such a gloomy hour.—But if this be the case, I am sure there is" full "consolation, in that sweet balmy covenant which," in "Jesus" is opened "for such as believe," and at such times as these.—Therefore, dear souls, re∣joice in him, and give him back his own,—and bless a <HI>taking</HI> as well as a giving God."—"Pray for your poor, unworthy sister, who am groaning under the burdens and sorrows of life, which infinite wisdom meets out to me,

in various forms (too great to be expressed, tho' infinite∣ly less than my deserts) that I may be strengthned with strength in my soul."</P>
</LETTER></P>
<P>The dear <HI>relative,</HI> above mentioned, recovered of <HI>that</HI> sickness, to which (it is supposed) the foregoing letter refers; and, not long after, was married [to Mr. <HI>Benjamin Douglass</HI>] with whom she lived, in great amity, at <HI>New-Haven,</HI> about three years, and then died of the small-pox, December 8, 1766, in the 28th year of her age, to the inexpressible grief of her <HI>parents, husband</HI> and <HI>sister,</HI> and much lamented by all friends.—She was [allowed, by all her intimate acquaintance, to be a truly amiable young woman, not only on account of the ex∣ternal beauties of her person, but more especially for the sweet and obliging temper of her mind. Her very composition was <HI>love tenderness</HI> and <HI>generosity.</HI>]—Remar∣kably patient in all her distressing sicknesses; and in her <HI>last</HI> was favoured with such discoveries of God, and found such trust in him, as abundantly satisfied her attendants and sorrowing friends that her hope of eternal life was founded in Gospel evidences of a saving acquaintance with Christ.</P>
<P>In less than two months after her decease, Mrs. <HI>Willis</HI> departed this life, as above related; concerning whom, it remains to be said, That her relish for divine things, and deep concern for the prevalence of true godliness in her own heart and life, may further appear from some <HI>select passages,</HI> found among her private papers, after her death; which ('tis supposed) she met with in her reading, and penn'd for her own use; as what were pe∣culiarly agreeable to her sentiments, and which deeply impressed her mind.</P>
<P>They are as follows, viz.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="041779_0035_101B2991E2914DE0"/>"Providences are sometimes dark texts, that want an expositor.—God's providence fulfills his promise.—With∣out God's providence nothing falls out in the world.— Without his commission nothing flies.—Without his blessing nothing prospers."</P>
<P>"Afflictions are not so much <HI>threatned</HI> as <HI>promised</HI> to the children of God.</P>
<P>"To be a <HI>christian,</HI> and a <HI>suffering</HI> christian, is a double honour.</P>
<P>"By affliction God separates the sin, which he hates, from the soul which he loves.</P>
<P>"An hard heart is not so easily broken, as a broken heart is bound up.</P>
<P>"We must hear the warnings of conscience, or we shall feel the woundings of conscience.</P>
<P>"A word from God; a look from Christ; a touch from the spirit, will break the heart.</P>
<P>"To those that believe, (1) Christ is precious. (2) The word is sweet. (3) Sin is bitter. (4) Saints are dear. (5) Religion is their business. (6) The world is a broken idol. (7) Death is welcome."</P>
<P>Reserving other parts of her life and character, to the hand that published them soon after her funeral (tho' some of them have been, unavoidably, touch'd in the foregoing account) I shall here only observe,</P>
<P>That her early profession of religion was followed with the exercises of devotion; and, abating humane im∣perfections, adorn'd with a conversation becoming the gospel. Her attendance, when able, was constant on public worship and ordinances of God's house, where
<PB N="36" REF="041779_0036_101B2994A0D78C08"/>
her solemn deportment spoke the deep concern of her soul, to <HI>worship God in spirit and in truth.</HI>—The zeal which carried her up to the <HI>house</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> accompanied her back to <HI>her own,</HI> and spread itself through her or∣dinary conversation.—The <HI>godly</HI> were highest in her esteem, with whom she delighted to converse upon the affairs of religion and the other world. Yet ever socia∣ble and pleasant, delighting to make <HI>all</HI> about her hap∣py.— Even on a bed of sickness and pain, which affected the hearts of her friends, she would conceal a measure of her own grief, and strive to chear their spi∣rits, rather than increase their sorrows by uttering all her complaints. Her common treatment of those that visited her house, or fell in her way, (not excepting the injurious) discovered a heart full of friendship and loving kindness to all men. But her tenderness and dear affection to her <HI>relatives</HI> was almost singular; nor did it fail of suitable returns.—As a <HI>daughter, sister, wife</HI> and <HI>mother,</HI> none more affectionate. The duties of each rela∣tion were considered as a <HI>privilege,</HI> not a <HI>task</HI> —done with so much pleasure and chearfulness, and (which could hardly fail) attended with such mutual endearments, as made it not easy to say, whether she <HI>loved</HI> more than she was <HI>beloved</HI> —As a mistress, provident and kind to her servants, ruling with moderation and gentleness, to make their yoke of servitude easy, and their burden light.—She guided the affairs of her house with dis∣cretion, generosity, carefulness and frugality appeared in all her domestic oeconomy. —Though pressed with infirmities of body, she greatly assisted her worthy part∣ner in the instruction and education of tender <HI>youths,</HI> committed to their care (for which she had a singular faculty, and) in which exercise she closed her life.</P>
<P>When the time came that she must die, being appre∣hensive that it was her l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st sickness, she seemed not ter∣rified
<PB N="37" REF="041779_0037_101B02ADE763CD20"/>
at the approach of death.—She that had long been deprived of health, and e'en cut off (in youth) from the hopes of that blessing.—She "that often received the sentence of death in herself, and viewed the grave as gasping for her," met the summons, when she found it real, with much composure of mind.—Though under some clouds, and, in a measure, destitute of former mani∣festations, yet retained a firm reliance on the all perfect righteousness and merits of Christ for acceptance with God,— thirsting for him and the displays of his grace in that decisive hour.—At a lucid interval, from the force of her disease, which had now deeply affected the pow∣ers of her mind, she finished her work with this impor∣tant and striking expression (in answer to a word that was spoken, concerning her going to join the angels and saints in their delightful work of praise) 'Tis not enough said she, "for me to glorify God in <HI>heaven</HI>; I long to glorify him on <HI>earth</HI> and in death."</P>
<P>The following character of Mrs. <HI>Willis,</HI> heretofore referred to, was drawn by a gentleman of her intimate acquaintance, and published in the Boston prints, soon after her death. Which, as it harmonizes with, and confirms the foregoing account; the substance whereof (touching her character) was taken down, by the author, before he saw or heard of what was printed, I hope will (therefore) escape the censure of <HI>Tautology,</HI> and be ad∣mitted as an acceptable close.</P>
<P><HI>Malden,</HI> January 30, 1767.</P>
<P>"On Sunday last, one o'clock in the morning, died here, much lamented, Mrs. <HI>Willis,</HI> AEtat. 59, the pious and truly amiable consort of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Eliakim Willis,</HI> Pastor of the second church in this town.—The external graces of her person were uncommon.—The vivacity and sprightliness of her countenance was unusual.
<PB N="38" REF="041779_0038_101B299A1F154A68"/>
Her aspect discovered a quick discernment, a deep sen∣sibility, and benevolent heart. In manners she was gentle, easy and unaffected—A most agreeable compa∣nion,—of a very sociable turn,—pleasant, without the least tincture of levity,—serious, without a gloom,—re∣ligious and devout, without enthusiasm,—extremely entertaining in conversation.</P>
<P>"Her natural genius was above the common size,— her taste for reading was almost singular; and she excelled most of her sex, in a relish for works of genius; books written in taste. She had a quick sense of the charms of imagination and beauties of expression.</P>
<P>"But subjects of divinity chiefly engaged her attenti∣on, and especially such as were the most important and interesting.—Her favourite authors were those that placed the perfections of God, the grace of the gospel, and our absolute dependance upon God, through Christ, in the clearest light; and that gave the justest representation of our obligations, our duty and interest,—and that afforded the best rules for self-examination, and the most power∣ful motives to christian practice.—<HI>Piety,</HI> which com∣menced in early life, was no small part of her character. She appeared jealous of herself, with a godly jealousy: and at times was concerned lest she should be mistaken, in an affair of the greatest consequence; though at other times, a sight of the glory of God, in the face of Christ, removed the inquietudes of her mind; and the love of God shed abroad in her heart, cast out disquiet∣ing fear.</P>
<P>"She had a remarkable turn for friendship; and the unusual kindness, courtesy and chearfulness, with which she treated her friends, appeared to be a just and sincere expression of that respect and benevolence which warmed her heart. She highly valued such as exceeded in good∣ness and ingenuity.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="041779_0039_101B02AF7321C860"/>"She excelled in charity and hospitality,—was a true friend to the poor,—of a tender, compassionate, sympa∣thizing heart,—easily touched with a sense of the afflic∣tions and sorrows of others— could mourn with them that mourned, and weep with them that wept.</P>
<P>"She was much esteemed and beloved by her ac∣quaintance; and the worthy object of Mr. <HI>Willis</HI>'s warmest and strongest affections. Nor need it be said, that she was very happy in the conjugal connection.</P>
<P>"Her constitution was extremely delicate; and, for a number of years she has been subject to much feeble∣ness and indisposition, which did not however destroy the amiable sweetness of her mind.</P>
<P>The rules of true virtue and religion were her guide and companions in life: A dependence upon God's all-sufficiency thro' Christ alone, in death, was her support.— And yesterday her funeral was attended with great de∣cency and solemnity."—</P>
