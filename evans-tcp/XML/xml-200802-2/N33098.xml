In passing Mr. Spooner's, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were called in by Alexander Cummings, whom we thought wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a British soldier. Having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od some time by the fire, he told u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his master was gone from home, but he would go and call hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mistress, for she had a great regard for the army, as her fath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was in it and one of her brothers. He called her, and she came down, and appeared glad to see us. She asked us, whether we came from the Hill? We told her we had, and were going to Canada, as I, Buchanan, had left my family there. She order¦ed breakfast for us, and as soon as it was ready we were desired to go into the sitting-room. We were very much surprised a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this, for we should have thought ourselves well dealt by, to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> received any favor she might see fit to bestow o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the kitch∣en. However we all breakfasted together.

The weather continued ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y bad, we stayed there that day and night, I (Buchanan) a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no positive whether it was the first or second day, she told me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by ourselves, that she and her husband did not agree that he was gone a journey to Princetown, and that he would not be at home soon, that we should not go from thence until th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> weather was fair, there being a great fall of snow at this time▪ We very readily consented, and stayed from day to day, ex¦pecting M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Spooner home. Mrs. Spooner getting very fre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in discourse with me (Buchanan) one day told me that she neve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> expected Mr. Spooner to return, as there was one Mr. Ross gone with him, who had an ounce of poison, which he had promised her he would give to Mr. Spooner, the first convenient oppor∣tunity. The reader must needs think this a very strange circum∣stance, that she should make such a discovery to an entire stran∣ger. She said at the same time, we should stay 'till we sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whether Mr. Spooner returned or not. Accordingly we stayed and were never in better quarters, little thinking of the ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the seducer of souls was laying for us, we were then in a dispo∣sition to c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tch at it, having no fear of GOD before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> entirely to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ken of him. Having tarried ten or eleven day<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r as can be recollected, he at length came home, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣ing us there, asked her who we were.

heard at the tavern of the quantity of liquor he had to pay for, since his going on his journey. Be that as it may, at night he came home, and seeing we were not gone, he desired us to go immediately. We begged he would let us stay 'till morn∣ing: He after some time consented that we should stay by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re all night. He was in the sitting room by himself, and Mrs. Spooner went to bed. There was one Reuben Old, came upon some business with Mr. Spooner, and after some time came out and told us that Mr. Spooner told him he was afraid we should rob him, adding, that he had lost a silver spoon, and a great deal of pewter. This vexed us, as we were conscious we had no thought of stealing from him. Had we been so inclined, we had as much opportunity as we could have desired. The spoon, he found where he laid it, Cummings convinced him there was none of the pewter missing. Mr. Spooner went up stairs and brought down a box, which he had his money in, and laid down on the floor with it under his head. Every thing Mr. Spooner did or said, Old came and told us, and was out with us all the time he was asleep, and we were all merry to∣gether, sitting by the kitchen fire. Said Old declared in court, that I (Buchanan) said, if Mr. Spooner came out I would for two coppers put him in the well, which is false. In the morn∣ing, it not being convenient to see Mrs. Spooner to take our leave of her, we, Buchanan, Brooks, and Cummings, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent to Mrs. Stratten's to pass the day, 'till we could get an opportu∣nity to bid Mrs. Spooner farewell.

We then went to the house, and had supper and liquor, retired to the barn, and tarried all night. In the morning had breakfast sent to the barn for us. And as Mrs. Berry and Mrs. Tufts had been there the day be∣fore, and wanted to see me (Buchanan) I said I would go and see them. Mrs. Spooner said she would also go, which was agreed on. Buchanan and Brooks went there, and we all stayed at Mr. Green's drinking 'till late; some distance from thence, she said she had given a handkerchief to a British soldi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r that had some words in anger with me, Buchanan, upon which, Brook<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent back on her horse, and she and I went home.—Brooks miss'd his road on his return, but got to the house some time after us, but did not get the handkerchief, as the soldier would not deliver it, until he saw Mrs. Spooner. Buchanan and Brooks stayed that night in the barn, in the morning went to Gilbert's Tavern,

and staid there some time, and on coming out from his house, we saw Cummings coming on one of Mr. Spooner's horses, he told us his master was gone to the tavern, and that his mistress desi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed we would come there, which we did, and had supper, we went to the barn that night, and in the morning she s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> word that her husband was gone abroad into the count<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> get some oats. The boy Parker, had proposed to Brooks, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> would come and meet Mr. Spooner and him on their return, he, said Parker, said he would help to take Mr. Spooner's life. We went over from the barn to the house, and found he was gone▪ and stayed there all day, and lived on the best the house afforded o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> meat and drink: Mr. Spooner came home in the dusk of the evening, so that we had like to have been seen; but we heard him come with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey to the door, and Brooks ran into the cel∣lar, and I went and stood on the back stairs, until he went into the sitting room. We then came out, and went to the barn, there stayed all next day, and at night, when Mr. Spooner was in bed, we were sent for to the house, and received supper and liquor, to encourage another plan, which Cummings and Parker (who have for this time escaped punishment) proposed to poor Brooks, which was, they all three to go up stairs, and Brooks to take his life from him, for which he w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to receive one thousand dollars, Mr. Spooner's watch, his buckles, and as much cloth as would make a suit of cloaths; but Brooks's heart failed him; and Mrs. Spoo∣ner said she did not think he was so faint-hearted. H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this been done he was to be put into the well as he was ta∣ken out of bed; for she observed it would be thought he had fallen in, drawing water in the night; next day had breakfast brought us by Cummings. He informed us, there was another plan formed by her, which was to have been executed as follows. Either Cummings or Parker to tell Mr. Spooner one of his hor∣ses was sick, and as he came to the barn to kill him, and put him amongst the horses feet, to make the people believe when he was found that the horses had killed him. But Brooks told Parker not to tell him, but to make her believe he would not go over. The boy conducted accordingly. We stayed all that day and night. Next day, being Sunday, we stayed there; she came over at night; we told her we would go away the next morn∣ing; she desired we would not; but we wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d not stay. We set out to go to Springfi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld, as we went thro' Western, on that road, we en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ged to wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k with one Mr. Marks a smith; I Bu∣chanan worked there two days; but as he had no files fit for the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ade, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ooks followed, we proposed to go to Wor∣cester to g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t some, which was agreed to.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="043425_0003_101D07F9061265C8"/>We set off on Wednesday about noon, and in going by Mr. Spooner's we called in and told her where we were going; she said she would follow us down next day as she wanted to see her sister, saying she was glad we had got work so near; and fur∣ther added, that she had two notes, one of twenty pounds law∣ful, and another of three hundred dollars, which she would an∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to get changed, and let me, Buchanan, have one hun∣dred dollars, to purchase any thing I might want.

But as he came in sight he saw her ride from the door and therefore did not go there; we staid at Walker's un∣til Sunday afternoon, and then left Worcester, and about 8 o∣clock at night got to Mr. Spooner's; we saw Mrs. Stratten a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the well. I Buchanan, spoke to her, she told me there was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n company in the house, but she would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et Mrs. Spooner know we were there; Mrs. Spooner came out, and told us that one Mr. Ross was in the house, who had a brace of pistols loaded, and that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e had promised her he would kill Mr. Spooner as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e came home from the tavern, she desired us to come in, which we did, he shewed us a pistol, and said Mr. Spooner should die by that to night.

<HEAD>An Account of the <HI>MURDER</HI> as it was committed▪</HEAD>
<P>William Brooks went out and stood within the small gate leading into the kitchen, and as Mr. Spooner came past him he knocked him down with his hand. He strove to speak when down, Brooks then took him by the throat and partly strangled him. Ross and Buchanan came out; Ross took Mr. Spooner's watch out and gave to Buchanan; Brooks and Ross took him up and put him into the well head first; before they carried him away, I, Buchanan, pulled off his Shoes: I was in∣stantly struck with horror of conscience, as well I might; I went into the house and met Mrs. Spooner in the sitting room, she seemed vastly confused: She went immediately up and brought the money which was in a box. She not having the key desired me to break it open, which I did; at the same time Brooks and Ross came in: She gave two notes of 400 dollars each to Ross to change and give the money to Brooks; but there was found some paper money, which Brooks receive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, being 243 dollars, and the notes were returned.</P>
<P>At the same time she gave Ross four notes, each of them ten pounds, to purchase camblet for a riding dress. Ross gave Brooks his waistcoat, breeches and shirt. She went and brought Ross a waistcoat, breeches and shirt of Mr. Spooner's. When they were shifted, she gave me▪ Buchanan, three eight dollar bills, and asked me when she should see me again? I told her in fourteen days, but it pleased GOD to order it sooner, and in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dreadful situation. Had we all been immediately struck dead after the perpetrating so horrid a murder, and sent to hell, GOD would have been justified and we justly comdemned.</P>

<P>We, Buchanan, Brooks and Ross, are conscious to ourselves that we are indeed guilty of the above murder, and that here∣by we have forfeited our lives into the han<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> public justice, and expos'd ourselves to have our part in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke which burn∣eth with fire and brimstone. We desire to give glory to GOD by a free and full confession of our heinous guilt. We trust we have, with deep penitence and contrition of soul, confessed it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> GOD, hoping in his infinite mercy and compassion, through <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> atoning blood of his Son Jesus, that our scarlet and crimson guilt may be done away, that we may be saved from etern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> damnation, which we know we j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stly deserve, and obtain eter∣nal life and salvation.
