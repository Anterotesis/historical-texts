<HEAD>THE Examination &amp; Confession of Edward Fitz-Partrick After his committing Murder on the Body of Daniel Campbell at Rutland, on the 8th Day of March 1743,4.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Memorandum <DATE><HI>March</HI> 27th 1744.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THIS Day about 10 o'Clock in the Forenoon, Mr. <HI>Luke Brown,</HI> un∣der Keeper of the Goal in <HI>Wor∣cester,</HI> informed me the Subscriber one of His Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the County of <HI>Worcester,</HI> that he had been read∣ing sundry Passages of holy Writ to <HI>Edward Fitz Partrick</HI> relating to Murder; and after some Discourse thereon, (as <HI>Brown</HI> in∣formed me) <HI>Fitz Partrick</HI> told him if Mr. <HI>Burr</HI> and myself would come to the Goal, he would confess the whole Truth (relat∣ing to <HI>Campbell</HI>'s Murder;) accordingly be∣tween one &amp; two o'Clock in the Afternoon we went to him, <HI>Brown</HI> being present. <HI>Fitz Partrick,</HI> confess'd himself to be guilty of willfully murdering said <HI>Campbell,</HI> by throwing him down, and strangling him; and in the Fray <HI>Campbell</HI> bit the middle Finger of his right Hand (which now had the Wounds on it) which bled, and with which it was that he blooded his Cloaths with, that he said <HI>Partrick</HI> had on when the Murder was done, (the Cloaths being now in my Possession, and the Jacket bloody.)</P>
<P>I then ask'd him if <HI>Campbell</HI> did not bleed? he answered, no, he strangled him and did not strike him to make him bleed.</P>
<P>This Murder was committed the Thurs∣day Night before the dead Body of <HI>Camp∣bell</HI> was found, being the 8th instant.</P>
<P><HI>Fitz Partrick</HI> further declared that the Evening before the Murder was done, <HI>Campbell</HI> and he had been to <HI>William Whitaker</HI>'s, and the said <HI>Partrick</HI> came home first and went to the Barn, and when <HI>Campbell</HI> came home, he told him the Cattle were loose in the Barn; this he did to get him out, and they both ran to the Barn together, where he did the Murder in the Manner aforesaid: After which he car∣ry'd the dead Body to the Place where it was bury'd, that he dug the Grave with the Spade found in the House, and on Saturday Morning he covered the Grave with Loggs, that he cut off some Buttons of <HI>Campbell's</HI> Jacket, and design'd them for his own Breeches (which Buttons I now have by me) that some Muslin since found in his Pocket, he took out of <HI>Campbell's</HI> Chest some Time after the Murder.</P>
<P>He also own'd, he took a Snuff Box out of said Chest, hung &amp; tipt with Silver, with something in it; as also another Box; and as he was opening one of 'em atone <HI>Lamond</HI>'s House in <HI>Rutland,</HI> something fell out of the Box, &amp; he had not Time to look for it, nor did he know what it was; that he hid the Box hung and tipt with Silver by a Stump near <HI>Campbell</HI>'s House in the Road; that he hid a Box called a Cannoe Box of <HI>Campbell</HI>'s in the Wall near said <HI>Lamond's</HI> House; that he hid a pair of Shoes of <HI>Campbell</HI>'s in a Heap of Stones near the Barn with the Soles upward, and a slat Stone laid over them. A pair of Silver Shoe-Buckles of <HI>Campbell</HI>'s he hid under a Log between the House and Barn.</P>
<P>He acknowledged his Inducement to kill him, was to get his Things, and that he alone did the Murder, and no other Person was concerned with him. He further added, That in the scuffle <HI>Campbell</HI> struck him a severe Blow with his Foot on his right Breast, that almost took his Life a∣way, but recovering, he soon dispatch'd him. The Mark on his Breast where he was hurt he shew'd us.</P>
<P>I ask'd him if he had any angry Words, or had differed with <HI>Campbell:</HI> he said, that some little Time before he had bro't home some Rum and sold Part of it to him, and that he thought <HI>Campbell</HI> had not done him Justice; that he was a little dirty nastly Fellow, and he did not like him: He told us, that he was so troubled he could not sleep, the Night the Murder was committed, nor the Night after but a little.</P>
<P>The aforewritten Confession, <HI>Edward Fitz-Patrick</HI> acknowledged freely before the Reverend Mr. <HI>Burr, Luke Brown,</HI> and my self, the Day first written.</P>
