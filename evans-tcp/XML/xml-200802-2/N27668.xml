<BIBL>2 SAMUEL, iii. 38.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>KNOW YE NOT THAT THERE IS A PRINCE AND A GREAT MAN FALLEN THIS DAY IN ISRAEL?</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IF splendid talents and sublime virtue; if undeviating integrity and heroic patriotism, are not mere empty names; if a life, the most useful and important, devoted to the dearest in∣terests of his country, can command the affection and esteem of a grateful people; then the NAME of WASHINGTON will be always dear to Amer∣icans.</P>
<P>In the character of this great Man were united all those excellent qualities which adorn and dig∣nify human nature. He was raised up at a period when such uncommon talents were most wanted, and when, by an extraordinary combination of circumstances, he had the fairest opportunity of displaying them to the greatest advantage. His death, though delayed by a kind Providence till he had nearly filled the usual span of life, has cast a most solemn and affecting gloom over the whole nation. And who, my brethren, is not ready to
<PB N="4" REF="036877_0004_100B29571F729920"/>
exclaim in the melancholy language of the text, <HI>Know ye not that there is a Prince and a great Man fallen this day?</HI></P>
<P>These words are a part of that short but beauti∣ful Eulogy pronounced by King David at the fu∣neral of Abner. They were the undissembled ef∣fusions of a heart deeply impressed with the sud∣den loss of a brave and worthy man. Abner was chief general of all the armies of Israel which yet adhered to the house of Saul; and from duty and principle had been a public enemy to the king∣dom of David. He had probably sworn allegiance to the family of Saul; and, like a faithful man, he endeavoured to maintain the honour of that crown as long as there was a probability of success. He evidently saw that the kingdom of David was daily increasing in strength, and that of his master as rapidly declining. Reason and humanity uni∣ted in urging the necessity of a union of all the tribes under one common head. He announced his determination to the King, and, after confer∣ring with the Elders of Israel upon the subject, he thought proper to go in person to Hebron to ac∣complish the business. King David received him and his suit in the most cordial, friendly manner. The preliminaries of the union were agreed upon, and Abner dismissed in peace. Immediately after, Joab, who led the hosts of David, returned to Hebron, and was informed of what had passed. He went in directly to the King, and reproved him severely for his credulity; denouncing Abner as a treacherous spy, and all his pretended friendship
<PB N="5" REF="036877_0005_100B2958A54EEF10"/>
as the basest duplicity. The fact was, he enter∣tained a murderous design against Abner, who had slain his brother Asahel in battle some time before. He soon became resolved in the business, and sent messengers after Abner, which brought him again to Hebron. As soon as he had reached the gate, Joab met him with the appearance of friendship, and, smoothing his sullen brow, he concealed the baseness of his design under a false, insidious smile; and in this unguarded moment he plunged the fatal dagger into the breast of this worthy Hero.</P>
<P>When the information of this melancholy event had reached the ears of David, he declared him∣self and kingdom "guiltless before the Lord for∣ever from the blood of Abner." He gave com∣mandment to Joab as head of the military depart∣ment, and to "all the people that were with him, to rend their clothes, and mourn before Abner." "And King David himself followed the bier." "And the King lift up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept. And the King lamented over Abner and said, Died Ab∣ner as a fool dieth?" No. "Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put in fetters; as a man fall∣eth before wicked men, so fellest thou. And all the people wept again. And the King said unto all his servants, <HI>Know ye not that there is a Prince and a great Man fallen this day in Israel?</HI> I am this day weak though anointed King." We have sel∣dom seen this excellent man in a more dignified attitude, than when weeping at the grave of Ab∣ner.
<PB N="6" REF="036877_0006_100B295C1B4794E0"/>
He discovered a magnanimity of soul upon this occasion worthy of imitation. To lay aside all resentment against a man who had so lately acted as his foe, and to pay a voluntary tribute of public respect to his memory, was doing a still greater honour to himself. It is not a mere weak∣ness in human nature, but a real excellency, to weep over fallen greatness. Shall we not then, my brethren, indulge our tears upon the present occasion; when we reflect that the Man who con∣ducted us to freedom and independence, and who so ardently "loved our nation," is now no more?</P>
<P>Perhaps the words of the text could never be applied to any man with greater propriety, than to him whose death we this day deplore. If we should look over the characters of the greatest and wisest of men who have lived in any age of the world, we shall find few, if any, who have excelled him in wisdom or virtue; and who have sustained such important trusts with so much dignity to themselves or advantage to mankind. But nei∣ther the great nor the good are suffered to con∣tinue, by reason of death. Yet, while we mingle our undissembled sorrows with the tide of general grief, and mourn their loss, we may hope that God will raise up others to fill their places with equal reputation.</P>
<P>From the subject thus introduced, the following observations are proposed to your consideration and improvement, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P>FIRST. That in every age and nation it hath pleased God to raise up and qualify some men for
<PB N="7" REF="036877_0007_100B295EDBB3C048"/>
the most distinguished honours, and for the most eminent usefulness.</P>
<P>SECOND. That when such highly respected characters are removed by death, justice and grat∣itude demand a suitable tribute of respect to be paid to their memories.</P>
<P>Both sacred and profane history unite in estab∣lishing these propositions. To illustrate the first, we shall bring into view some of those characters who have been particularly distinguished in differ∣ent professions, and at different periods.</P>
<P>That all men are absolutely equal either in their natural or acquired endowments, or that they are equally fitted to fill the most elevated stations, none, I presume, will undertake to prove.</P>
<P>The system of nature not only discovers an in∣finite variety of beings, but a great variety of grades in the same species. Order and subordina∣tion are seen through all her works. We behold the sun in the centre of our system, shining with pleasing majesty, while the primary planets are continually revolving around him; they, in their turn, receive a similar attention from their satel∣lites, which revolve about them. "One star dif∣fereth from another star in glory; so also is the resurrection of the dead." There must then have been as real a difference before the resurrection: for this will be conformably to the characters they sustained in life; and in heaven, that state of per∣fect felicity, we read of "angels and archangels, of cherubim and seraphim, of thrones and do∣minions, of principalities and powers."</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="036877_0008_100B296116CEEDA0"/>
As men are formed with very different capaci∣ties, so they are undoubtedly designed for very dif∣ferent employments. Every man has it in his power to be useful in his proper sphere. The wise Author of nature has designed some particular pur∣suit and employment for each individual. In this, and this o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> he can do all the good he is capable of.</P>
<P>Those who have been the greatest blessings to mankind, have not all been eminent for the same things, nor in the same degree. Such as have been raised up by God, from age to age, to lead, to instruct, and to deliver his people, have gener∣ally been considered as the greatest blessings to their fellow-men; and therefore their memories have been the most honoured. Hence the ingeni∣ous Artisan and the penetrating Philosopher, the enlightened Divine and the patriotic Civilian, the wise Statesman and the brave General, have al∣ways been highly respected by all civilized nations.</P>
<P>Man was at first occupied in tilling the ground; and however simple it may appear to some, it must be allowed to be one of the most interesting employments to mankind. "The King himself is served from the field." But husbandry could never have flourished without the assistance of the arts. Hence we find at a very early period, even long before the deluge, the arts were cultivated. Tubal-Cain is mentioned as an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron; and Jubal as a teacher of music, or the father of all such as handle the harp and organ: the use of the square and plumb were undoubtedly known at the time of the build∣ing
<PB N="9" REF="036877_0009_100B296464268058"/>
of Babel; as were also the principles of archi∣tecture to Noah, without which he could never have constructed such an astonishing vessel as the Ark.</P>
<P>The motion and order of the heavenly bodies early arrested the attention of man. He beheld with rapture those glittering orbs which adorned the spangled firmament, and shed their soft lustre upon the mantle of night. In the book of Job, which is supposed to have been written by Moses, there are some things which lead us to conclude that they had considerable knowledge of astron∣omy at this early period. This may be inferred from several things, besides the mention of "<HI>Arc∣turus, Orion,</HI> and <HI>Pleiades.</HI>"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job, ix. 9.</NOTE></P>
<P>But we pass with rapidity over these distant ages to the deliverance of the chosen tribes, in which the interposition of Heaven was more visi∣ble. Here we find Moses, raised up of God, and eminently qualified to be the leader and deliverer of that people. The character of Moses, in some particulars, stands unrivalled; especially the pro∣phetic part. As a General and a Legislator, he has rarely, if ever, been equalled. What a sacrifice he must have made in exchanging the peaceful re∣treats of Midian, for the noisy honours of a camp! His magnanimous design—the invincible firmness with which he pursued it (though obstructed by the most unaccountable and unheard-of difficul∣ties;)—the glorious things which he achieved for his nation;—above all, his godlike meekness un∣der
<PB N="10" REF="036877_0010_100B2966A9DBF140"/>
the most aggravating insults; have rendered his name as immortal as time! Joshua, who suc∣ceeded him, was very little, if at all, inferior to him in virtue or bravery. He conducted the tribes across Jordan into the land of promise, and divided their inheritance by lot to them. After his death, for the space of four hundred years, their government seems to have been irregularly administered; and, at times, nearly reduced to a state of anarchy. Yet, in this period, God rais∣ed up several eminent men, who were honoured as the deliverers of their country: such were Gid∣eon and Barak, Samson and Jephthah, of whom we cannot particularly speak.</P>
<P>Let us now meditate a moment on the history of David. Here we behold a pleasing assemblage of those extraordinary qualities which dignify hu∣man nature. His delicacy of behaviour when in∣troduced to the royal family of Saul;—his sacred friendship to Jonathan;—his unrivalled valour in meeting, in single combat, the huge champion of Gath, whose gigantic appearance had struck ter∣ror through the whole Hebrew army;—above all, his fervent piety,—his devout attachment to the institutions of religion, and the sublime sentiments of his poetic writings, will render his name il∣lustrious to all generations.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Humanity drops a tear, and then spreads a veil over his imperfections</NOTE> Solomon, who suc∣ceeded him, was distinguished by his wisdom and riches; and, during his long and peaceful reign, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e raised the Jewish throne to a degree of splen∣dour which it never exhibited before nor after∣wards.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="036877_0011_100B29690A028000"/>
Had we time, we might notice several others of distinguished merit in that favoured nation, whose history we have in the sacred pages; but if we turn to the Gentiles, we shall find among them many shining characters, who, by endeavouring to enlighten and reform their fellow-men, were emi∣nently useful in their day, and ornaments to the age in which they lived. They are commonly known by the general appellation of <HI>Philosophers.</HI> Their names alone would fill a volume. Of these we can only notice three or four. <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> who was born at Samos, about 590 years before Christ, was much celebrated by the ancients. He travelled, for the sake of obtaining knowl∣edge, to Egypt, Babylon, and through vari∣ous parts of Greece. And although he im∣bibed many of the errors of the age in which he lived, he is said 'to have made considerable discoveries in arts and sciences, and delivered a great variety of precepts for civil and political con∣duct.' It is remarked of <HI>Heraclitus,</HI> an Ephesian Philosopher, who flourished about two centuries after, that he 'continually bewailed the wicked lives of men, and as often as he came among them, to have fallen a weeping.' <HI>Socrates,</HI> who lived at the same time, or soon after, made very consider∣able improvement both in natural and moral phi∣losophy. He was convinced of the absurdity of polytheism, and 'for deriding the plurality of the Heathen gods, was condemned to drink the juice of hemlock.' <HI>Plato,</HI> who was the disciple of Soc∣rates, after studying with several other men of
<PB N="12" REF="036877_0012_100B296B89FDBD40"/>
great eminence, took a voyage into Egypt, where, it is supposed, he became acquainted with the Jew∣ish religion. He believed in one Supreme God, although he admitted other subordinate deities. He died 348 years before Christ. His system was generally received till long after the introduction of Christianity; and by many of the ancient Fa∣thers not unfrequently mixed with the doctrines of the Cross. But both natural and moral philoso∣phy, since the spread of Christianity, have emerg∣ed from that darkness in which they were before enveloped.</P>
<P>Many things which were unknown to the an∣cients, and others which were denied, through ig∣norance and superstition, are now established be∣yond the shadow of a doubt. Among the mod∣erns, who have explained the phenomena of na∣ture, and rendered her laws more easy and intelli∣gible, we may reckon a <HI>Copernicus,</HI> a <HI>Galileo,</HI> a <HI>Gas∣sendus,</HI> a <HI>Newton,</HI> and a <HI>Franklin.</HI> Their names are inscribed upon the page of immortality. But I proceed to take notice of another class of men, not less useful than the former.</P>
<P>As man could not enjoy, in a state of solitude, all the happiness he was designed for by his all-wise Creator; so neither could he in a state of society, without submitting to the restraints of law and order. Hence those, whether in the character of Civilians, Legislators, or Statesmen, who have con∣tributed to the establishment of wise and equal laws; in order to protect the rights of the inno∣cent, and bring the vicious to punishment, have
<PB N="13" REF="036877_0013_100B296E187E6E78"/>
been justly considered among the friends of human happiness.</P>
<P>Moses stands foremost in this list. Many of his precepts, especially those of a moral nature, are practised upon to this day, by different nations of different religions. The Gentiles, who had not this law, were a law to themselves. <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> the fa∣mous Lacedemonian Legislator, has been deserved∣ly celebrated. He reformed the government of the Spartans, and enacted a number of excellent laws, which he engaged them by a solemn oath to keep until he should return from a journey he was about to make: being convinced of their great util∣ity, and fearing they would release themselves from their oath in case he returned, he put an end to his own life while absent. <HI>Solon,</HI> the boast of Athens, and one of the wisest men of his day, was justly esteemed as an excellent Civilian. He abrogated the laws of Draco, and enacted oth∣ers more equitable; and taught, with surprising success, the great principles of jurisprudence.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We may add to this list the names of <HI>Grotius, Montesquieu, Hambden, Sidney,</HI> and the late noble Earl of Chatham, with many others.</NOTE></P>
<P>Permit me, my Brethren, also to observe, that teachers of piety and morality have generally been received, and respected by all nations. It is said by an inspired writer, that "the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth." Although, it must be ac∣knowledged, that some have dishonoured their sa∣cred profession, and caused the people to err; yet, I believe, that many have been, and ought to be,
<PB N="14" REF="036877_0014_100B297069EBAC98"/>
highly esteemed for their works' sake. How ven∣erable did the Jewish High-Priest appear on the great day of atonement, when, clad in his sacer∣dotal garments, he entered the most holy place, and sprinkled the blood before the mercy-seat! Yet in all this he was only a type of Him who was to come. Our great High-Priest has entered into heaven itself, and now appears in the presence of God for us.</P>
<P>Often did this people relapse into idolatry, and often God sent his prophets to teach them the right way; and though they sinned with a high hand, yet he remembered his covenant with Abraham, Isaac and Israel, and would not destroy them. At length, the time to favour them drew nigh, and John the Baptist was sent to announce the coming of the Son of God. "He was a burning and shining light," and thousands of penitents rejoiced in the salvation which he made known. He pointed his hearers to Jesus as the "Lamb of God who taketh away the sin of the world." The Apostles of our Lord, who were supernaturally qualified and sent forth to preach the gospel, were made unspeakable blessings to mankind. They not only preached the gospel in Judea, but were sent to enlighten the Gentile lands. They carried the knowledge of a Saviour with surprising success throughout great part of the then habitable world. God has never left himself without witness, but has, in every age, raised up some men of eminent abilities and piety, to teach the way of truth and righteousness, and to oppose the errors of the day.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="036877_0015_100B29729C34E2E0"/>
In the fifteenth century, when superstition and the grossest ignorance had overspread great part of the Christian world, God raised up Luther and his cotemporaries to begin a glorious reformation; the principles of which have been gaining ground unto the present day. The spirit of intolerance and persecution was not, however, wholly eradi∣cated by the reformation: had it been, perhaps our forefathers had never left their native coun∣try, and sought an asylum upon these western shores. Deprived of the rights of conscience at home, they were determined to seek a better coun∣try. Religious liberty was a primary object with these first adventures. For the enjoyment of this, they were willing to make almost any sacrifice. The difficulties and delays they experienced in leav∣ing their native country, the tediousness of their voyage, and the sufferings and hardships they un∣derwent in the beginning of their settlement here, would probably have subdued the fortitude of any set of men actuated merely by worldly motives. But fired with a noble zeal for religion, they pre∣ferred the privilege of worshipping God agreeably to the dictates of their own consciences (though in a desert) to all the enjoyments of this life. We have not time, nor would it comport with our design, to trace their history; but would just observe, that in times of affliction and calamity, when they were neglected or oppressed by a corrupt ministry at home, and exposed in their infant state here to the most distressing dangers, they made God their refuge. He heard their cries, he saw their
<PB N="16" REF="036877_0016_100B297432480648"/>
tears, and raised them up deliverers from time to time.</P>
<P>We might here give you a long list of worthy names, who deserved well of their country; but time forbids. We therefore hasten forward to that period, which brought into more public view the Man whose death we this day lament.</P>
<P>Our injured country had long seen with ex∣treme regret, their chartered rights violated, and an insidious ministry determined to deprive them of every vestige of rational liberty, and to subject them to the most arbitrary impositions. They saw their loyal humble petitions and remonstrances, either treated with total neglect, or construed into the voice of rebellion, and an armed force, prepared to give the last fatal blow to their expiring liber∣ties, already stationed among them. Driven to this extremity, they did not hesitate a moment be∣tween death and slavery! They made their solemn appeal to Heaven, and determined to repel force by force.</P>
<P>At length the storm burst!—the blood of our countrymen began to run!—their expiring groans mingling with the smoke of their dissolving habita∣tions ascended up to heaven! Distress and anxiety were depicted in every countenance. Our affairs appeared in the most perplexed, deranged situation conceivable; until by a wise choice dictated by the will of Heaven, our beloved WASHINGTON was appointed to the chief command of our ar∣mies. The gloom now gradually disappeared; and confidence in our public measures increased daily.
<PB N="17" REF="036877_0017_100B2976B4D79680"/>
The army was soon organized in the best manner possible, and subordination and discipline were so far established, as in a short time to give our little camp a veteran appearance.</P>
<P>But perhaps some account of General WASH∣INGTON, prior to his taking command of the American army in 1775, would be desirable to a number present. It shall be attempted. The task is pleasing; but I confess I feel a trembling diffi∣dence in approaching a character so venerable and sacred.</P>
<P>The ancestors of this illustrious Man came from England to this country in the year 1657. He was born in the parish of his own name in the county of Westmoreland, in Virginia, on the 11th of Feb∣ruary, 1732. His father died when he was only ten years old. Yet his education was properly at∣tended to, and conducted principally by a private tutor. He early discovered very uncommon tal∣ents, connected with a most enterprising genius. Before he arrived to the age of twenty, he entered the military department with the rank of Major.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was soon after advanced to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, and before he was twenty-two to the chief command of the regiment.</NOTE> He distinguished himself upon several occasions in his military character, before the memorable year 1755, when he achieved immortal honours, in conducting with so much skill and bravery the re∣treat of General Braddock's defeated army. He continued in the service of his country with increas∣ing reputation, until his ill state of health, in the year 1759, obliged him to resign his command.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="036877_0018_100B2978E791CA90"/>
He now enjoyed a recess from the toils of war for about the space of sixteen years, in which he sedulously cultivated the arts of peace: yet in this space, talents like his could not be exempted from the calls of a discerning public. Hence he frequently served his country as a Legislator, a Magistrate, and a Judge. He was elected a Dele∣gate to the first Congress in 1774, and also the year following, until his appointment to the chief command of the army removed him from the council to the field.</P>
<P>Eight long years he continued in this command without compensation or reward. In reviewing the hardships and dangers, the anxieties and fa∣tigues, which he must have suffered during that period; we may say of him as Jacob did of him∣self, "In the day time the drought consumed him, and the frost by night, and his sleep departed from his eyes." That superior wisdom and invin∣cible firmness which he displayed in every part of his conduct, secured to him the confidence of all, but especially of the army. New scenes of danger served only to bring into operation those great tal∣ents which so eminently qualified him to meet the exigency of the moment. By a surprising skill he seemed to pervade the most secret councils of his enemies; and by his timely, prudent caution, often defeated their most dangerous, deep laid plots. His fame is by no means built on his having de∣stroyed the most lives, but on his having saved them.</P>
<P>In several instances the fate of our country seem∣ed
<PB N="19" REF="036877_0019_100B297C38917DB8"/>
to hang in the most doubtful suspense; particu∣larly in the years 1776, and 1777. At the White Plains, it was evidently the design of the British commanders to have brought the matter to an is∣sue by a decisive pitched battle; they accordingly employed every art in their power for that pur∣pose. Our brave WASHINGTON beheld with painful regret the inferior strength of his army, and well knew that he could not engage with any probability of success; and yet to avoid it with honour, required more than Fabian skill. He wisely foresaw that a defeat at this time would probably have ruined our cause forever. There∣fore both patriotism and humanity compelled him to decline a general action.</P>
<P>If we trace him in his retreat through the Jer∣seys, we shall find him with scarce the appearance of an army. A little handful of brave, but half naked and barefoot troops, still continued with him, and supported the standard of liberty. Yet soon after with this small force to the astonishment of many, he re-crossed the Delaware, and commenc∣ing offensive operations, obtained several import∣ant victories, which greatly animated the inhabit∣ants of that State, and seemed to give a new turn to the progress of the war.</P>
<P>To give a full account of the dangers he en∣countered, and the victories he obtained, during our long struggle for liberty, until lord Cornwal∣lis, with his whole army, gave up to his standard, and surrendered themselves prisoners of war,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This article was omitted at the delivery.</NOTE>
<PB N="20" REF="036877_0020_100B297DC47A1288"/>
would far exceed the speaker's abilities, or the limits of this discourse. The sequel, will long be remembered by Britons as well as Americans.</P>
<P>When a peace was negociated by our ambassa∣dors in Europe, he received the intelligence, not with the indifference of a mercenary chief, whose only support is derived from his profession; but with those emotions of joy which are known only to patriotic minds. He immediately prepared to resign his command into the hands of those from whom he received it. And even in the act of re∣signing, he appeared with equal dignity as in the embattled field. His farewel address made a very sensible impression on people of all ranks, and serv∣ed to strengthen their attachment to him. Thus blessed by his liberated country, and covered with glory, he retired again to the peaceful shades of Mount Vernon.</P>
<P>Four years had scarcely elapsed, before we find him again publickly engaged in the cause of his country: In the year 1787 he was appointed by the State of Virginia a Delegate to the Convention which framed our excellent Constitution, and in which he presided. The year following, when this Constitution was received and ratified by the States, and a Chief Magistrate was to be chosen, the eyes of all were at once fixed on him, whom they considered, under God, as the Deliverer of their country; and the enlightened freemen of America proclaimed as with one voice, WASH∣INGTON IS THE MAN!</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="036877_0021_100B29810CE894A8"/>
However much his inclination might lead him to wish the pleasures of retirement, the call of his country was too sacred to be disregarded. He accepted their appointment, but with the greatest diffidence and distrust of his own abilities to dis∣charge the important duties of his elevated and responsible station. He was a second time unani∣mously chosen, and a second time he accepted. During the whole of his administration, he exhib∣ited all the attributes of magistracy in such an amiable and engaging light, as could not fail to secure the warmest affection of the people over whom he presided, and the most respectful esteem of foreign nations. In his military triumphs he has left a most solemn lesson for tyrants, and in his civil administration an excellent example for all future magistrates. In his farewel address he has left us a rich LEGACY, in which, although "being dead, he yet speaketh." Let us careful∣ly preserve it, and hand it down, as a mirror to posterity to see him in, to the latest ages. Perhaps it would not be saying too much, to say, that no more uninspired man was ever more beloved and respected than he was; nor their deaths more uni∣versally and sincerely lamented.</P>
<P>We proceed,</P>
<P>SECONDLY, to observe, That when such highly respected characters are removed by death, justice and gratitude demand a suitable tribute of respect to be paid to their memories.</P>
<P>This sentiment being so congenial with your feelings, upon the present occasion, it will need little said to enforce it.</P>

The children of Israel mourned for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days. This was a na∣tional act, and expressive of their deep sorrow up∣on this afflictive dispensation. The death of Mo∣ses differed in some respects from that of other men. He was particularly notified that it was at hand. Hence he employed the last month of his life in making immediate preparation for his final departure. He delivered a most solemn and affecting address to his nation a little before he left them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Deut. xxxii.</NOTE> In this he recapitulated the many dangers they had escaped, and pointed out those to which they were still exposed; and reminded them of the many past interpositions of Divine Providence in their behalf; and concluded by saying, "Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do." After this he proceeded from tribe to tribe, and left his fatherly blessing with them; and by a spirit of inspiration pointed out their future des∣tiny. From the tent of Asher, behold him as∣cending mount Nebo! See the tribes taking their last sad look of their kind Deliverer! Every heart transfixed with grief, and every eye swimming in tears! They watch his ascending steps, until he is lost from their sight! Moses at length reached the towering top of Pisgah, and from this lofty emi∣nence he surveyed "the land of Gilead—unto the utmost sea, and the south, and the plains of the valley of Jericho, and the city of palm-trees unto
<PB N="23" REF="036877_0023_100B2985972E20B8"/>
Zoar." Having thus seen the land of promise, he dropped the vail of mortality, as Elijah did his mantle, and ascended to the bosom of his God. He was now released from all his cares, and made happy in the mansions of rest; whilst a bereaved nation was mourning on the plain below. This bears the greatest resemblance to our present sit∣uation of any instance I recollect in the sacred pages. Moses, though considerably advanced in life, yet retained his full strength; "his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated." He had not outlived his usefulness, so as to be half forgot∣ten before he was dead; but retained the vigour of youth, enriched with the long experience of years.</P>
<P>Although his services were still eminently use∣ful, and seemed to be much needed, yet he had probably conducted that people through their greatest dangers; and what was highly consoling, had transferred his authority before his death to his worthy successor, who was able to carry on the work which he had begun. You cannot help, my Brethren, observing a coincidence of charac∣ter and circumstances, between the Jewish Law∣giver and the American Patriot.</P>
<P>The beautiful <HI>Elegy</HI> of David, upon the death of Saul and Jonathan, is replete with all the fine sentiments of fraternal affection, and sympathetic sorrow. The friendship between him and Jona∣than had been long and uninterrupted; but Saul had been his persecutor for many years. Twice he had been delivered into his hands, and twice
<PB N="24" REF="036877_0024_100B29871CEBD2E8"/>
he had spared his life. When one of his aids re∣quested leave to smite him to the earth at once; David replied, "Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the Lord's anointed, and be guiltless?" The time may come, said he, when "he shall descend into battle and perish." The event had now taken place. It might have been supposed, that if David had not rejoiced at the fall of his greatest foe, he would at least have refrained from weeping. But he considered Saul as having been anointed at God's command, and vested with supreme authority; therefore he hon∣oured him as the "minister of God." The affect∣ing circumstances of his death, connecting with it that of his amiable son, subdued all former resent∣ment, and awakened in his soul every tender sen∣sibility. His harp was now attuned to mourn∣ing, and every strain warbled lamentation and woe. Forgetful of the former miscarriages of Saul, he now indulges all the luxury of generous grief, and weeps at the awful stroke of fate, which lodged a father and a son together in the cold arms of death, upon <HI>mount Gilboa.</HI> "The beauty of Israel," said he, "is slain upon thy high places; how are the mighty fallen!" They "were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided. Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet with other delights, and put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel." And will not the fair daughters of Columbia weep for a far more amiable character, for our beloved WASHINGTON? Surely they
<PB N="25" REF="036877_0025_100B298BD79DC2D8"/>
will. When they consider how much they are indebted to his arduous toils, his sleepless nights, his counsels and his care, for their present happiness and prosperity, I doubt not but they will partake largely in the general grief.</P>
<P>Our context exhibits further proof that the memories of the virtuous and the brave have ever been honoured. The Eulogy pronounced upon Abner; the character of the Orator; above all, the sorrowing tears of the audience, witnessed the high respect they had for the virtues of this brave, but unfortunate General.</P>
<P>Some of the Kings of Israel, who distinguished themselves only for their wickedness, were denied the privilege of being buried in the sepulchres of their fathers; whilst such as were virtuous and reigned well, never failed of being honoured both in life and death. When Hezekiah died, "they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death." But how do all the instances of public grief, which are to be met with in sacred and profane history, di∣minish to a point, when compared with that which was exhibited at the death of CHRIST?</P>
<P>When the SAVIOUR of men expired upon Calva∣ry, nature, suspending her usual gaieties, threatened the return of universal chaos. The pained rocks burst asunder! The groaning earth trembled to its centre! The sun shrouded himself in black, and the world was curtained round in awful dark∣ness!—The daughters of Jerusalem followed him
<PB N="26" REF="036877_0026_100B298D5C9206A0"/>
to the fatal place weeping! The disciples stood afar off beholding! Many of the crowd who beheld the sight, smote upon their breasts, and withdrew from the affecting scene. The death of JESUS will be gratefully remembered, and frequently celebrat∣ed by Christians to the latest ages of time. Any attempt to swell our present grief to a comparison with this, would be most solemn trifling. Yet our loss is great indeed.</P>
<P>The Man, who was destined by Heaven to be the instrumental Saviour of his country; who went before our armies, and conducted them safe∣ly amidst perils and dangers, and who led them on to final victory; the Man who presided over our national councils with so much honour, and whose administrations bore the most dignified marks of wisdom, prudence and integrity; "the man who was raised up on high"—Alas! we shall see his face no more.</P>
<P>It is observed by an ingenious writer, that when that celebrated statesman and friend to universal liberty, the late noble Earl of Chatham, was inter∣red, the tide of public grief and respect rose high∣er, than had been ever known before upon a sim∣ilar occasion; and such as was not usual even at the funeral of kings.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belsham's Memoirs of Geo. III.</NOTE> But, my Brethren, what is all the funeral pomp which attends the exit of kings, compared with that generous sorrow which at this moment oppresses the bosom of every American? Our tears are not a tribute extorted from us by custom, but the genuine expressions of
<PB N="27" REF="036877_0027_100B2990CB29B250"/>
our heartfelt grief. We humbly hope our Divine Master will not be offended with our mourning for the Man whom we so much loved, since he himself wept at the grave of Lazarus.</P>
<P>It becomes us upon the present occasion to min∣gle with our sorrows, the voice of thanksgiving, to that God whose counsels are unsearchable, and his ways past finding out. We will adore him, that he has honoured our nation to give birth to one of the most illustrious of men; who has very justly been considered as 'the pride of his country,' and the admiration of the world. Let us adore the God of Armies who covered his head in the day of battle, and who sustained him amidst so many tri∣als and dangers. Nor have we less cause of thank∣fulness, that he was enabled to discharge with so much wisdom and integrity, the very difficult and important duties of his responsible station as Su∣preme Executive of the Union. While we mourn his sudden departure from us, we have great rea∣son to acknowledge that goodness which spared him to us so long. That he did not fall upon the high places of the field, by the hand of his ene∣mies; nor "by the hand of wicked men," like the man who is the subject of our text; but that Heaven, who cannot err, appointed the time, the instrument, and the manner of his death. Let us with reverence submit to the awful dispensa∣tion; and be careful that we do not offend God, by any indecent expressions of our grief. How∣ever much he was honoured and revered, he was but a man; and we know that "it is better to
<PB N="28" REF="036877_0028_100B29928AB2E440"/>
trust in the Lord, than to put confidence in prin∣ces:" for though they are called gods, they must die like men. Could the fond wishes of his coun∣try, or the tears of his surrounding friends, have delayed the awful stroke;—WASHINGTON had not died. But the sentence was irrevocable! He sub∣mitted to it with calmness, and we trust his nobler part is gone to that world, where virtue receives its full reward. Gratitude shall erect upon his tomb a lasting monument inscribed with his worthy deeds; whilst his precious dust shall rest in peace beneath its hallowed base, until the Archangel shall wake the sleeping dead.</P>
<LG>
<L>" Ye gentlest ministers of fate,</L>
<L>Attend our HERO as he lies,</L>
<L>And bid the softest slumbers wait</L>
<L>With silken cords to bind his eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Glory with all her lamps shall burn,</L>
<L>And watch the Warrior's sleeping clay,</L>
<L>Till the last trumpet rouse his urn</L>
<L>To aid the triumps of the day."</L>
</LG>
<P>God grant, that we may then all unite the ev∣erlasting hallelujahs of the redeemed. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
