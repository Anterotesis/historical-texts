<OPENER><SALUTE>Americans, Friends, and Fellow Citizens!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN compliance with a late resolve of Congress, and the Proclamation of the President of the United States; We are this day assembled, to express in the most public manner our grief, for the loss of an illustrious Chief—the first, the greatest of Columbia's sons.</P>
<P>Summoned by the herald of mortality to relinquish his earthly abode, he has winged his flight to that unknown re∣gion, from whence no traveller returns: Yet, he lives! embalmed in the affecti∣ons of a grateful people. The memorial of his virtue,—his wisdom,—his patriot∣ism shall never die. It shall survive the rapid revolutions of time, and triumph over the waste of ages. Millions yet un∣born, shall hail the deliverer of United
<PB N="4" REF="038921_0004_1012FD29E000FA58"/>
America! Shall feel the glow of patriot∣ism, the fervor of affection vibrate in uni∣son with our feelings, and rear to his beloved name, an immortal monument.</P>
<P>Other nations have furnished us with examples of martial courage, of state po∣lisy, and of virtuous legislation. In Ame∣rica, nature has combined these in one person; from her richest materials, she produced a noble form, breathed into it an exalted spirit, and called it WASHING∣TON.</P>
<P>Born to endure hardships, and to make a people free, his whole life was one un∣interrupted series of greatness. He arose like the morning sun above the eastern horizon, gradually diffusing light thro' the world, till at length his meridian splendor dazzled the sight of admiring beholders.</P>
<P>No sooner had he left the rocking cra∣dle, but he appears destined for high ap∣pointments. In early youth, his mind discovers so great a degree of fortitude,
<PB N="5" REF="038921_0005_1012FD309B35C648"/>
mixed with such an uncommon profun∣dity of thought, as to engage general attention.</P>
<P>At the age of twenty three, we find him in the rear of the haughty Braddock; that ill-fated General, who disdained the the seasonable council of our youthful hero, fell by the hands of a savage foe, a victim to his own folly and rashness; while the poor remains of a panic struck army, were nobly covered and safely conducted by the skill and prowess of WASHINGTON, and his courageous band of Virginians.</P>
<P>The buds of warlike genius now be∣gin to unfold; they are soon to appear in full bloom; the field was hitherto cir∣cumscribed; it will be enlarged, and the trumpet of fame waxing louder and loud∣er, will emblazen his martial deeds, and hail him the <HI>hero</HI> of the western world! the friend of the rights of man, the de∣fender of his injured country. The ge∣nius of Columbia forbids he should on∣ly move in a contracted sphere, at the
<PB N="6" REF="038921_0006_1012FD33DAE43B48"/>
head of a few compatriots in arms; he was designed for nobler purposes.</P>
<P>Many years had not elapsed, before his country calls him; and he obeys his country's call, and yields to the high be∣hosts of heaven.</P>
<P>America began to groan, under the mer∣ciless dominion of Britain: cut off from many valuable rights, imposition suc∣ceeded imposition, and her sons, no lon∣ger able to bear the galling yoke of a ty∣rant; and finding they must soon be crushed by the usurping power of royal∣ty, proclaimed themselves a free and in∣dependent people.</P>
<P>The time was now come for the most vigorous exertion: WASHINGTON, by the unanimous voice of the people, is cho∣sen the leader of their armies.</P>
<P>With what humility and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> does he accept this important trust, suf∣ficient to convict the most haughty and ambitious, that he had not temporary emoluments, or earthly honor in view;
<PB N="7" REF="038921_0007_1012FD35D547DC58"/>
no, it was the love of Liberty, of Coun∣try, of Justice, that animated him to so arduous an enterprize.</P>
<P>It was the unfathomable purpose of just heaven, to conduct him in safety thro' toils and dangers; to make him victori∣ous over all his enemies, to deliver a peo∣ple from the dread and terror of oppres∣sion, and bring them to the full enjoy∣ment of the dearest of earthly blessings. Yes, my fellow citizens, the Sovereign Lord of the universe, infused into this MAN a soul that disdained ambition, luxury and honor; and his country, as long as the wheels of time continue to roll, shall proscribe the miscreant, who would dare attempt to tarnish his unsul∣lied fame.</P>
<P>For a moment follow him in full com∣mand leading his armies: his person no∣ble and erect; his eyes fixed, his solemn countenance expressive of the most pro∣found judgment and sagacity, and all his actions only becoming that man whom an independent people delight to honor.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="038921_0008_1012FD3C74686D78"/>
In battle, mark his firm and determined attitude; hear his thundering voice rous∣ing his young and inexperienced soldiers: and by his superior skill, good manage∣ment, and indefatigable perseverance, vanquishing his enemies, invariably with the loss of but a few men. Unlike other heroes, who only fought for honor and conquest, he enjoins the observence of strict decorum. His soul big with vir∣tue, forbids peals of savage rejoicing▪ and his conquering army proceed in ma∣jestic pace, with the unfurled ensigns of American freedom.</P>
<P>Not many in this assembly I pre∣sume, were eye witnesses to his mighty feats of war; but you are no strangers to the records of his triumphs! You have read the historic page.</P>
<P>Yet, when I trace the silver locks of age; they speak, that you lived cotempo∣rary with our departed hero; and with him, beheld the torch of war, blazing in defence of your country's rights.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="038921_0009_1012FD3DF5CF6FB8"/>
Ye unshaken patriots of seventy six, who embarked in a glorious revolution. Ye, who marched both night and day, through woods and marshes, who clam∣bered over mountains and craggy rocks, in ardent pursuit of that liberty you▪ now enjoy; say, do not your minds of∣ten run back to former days, when scenes of cruelty and blood were held up to your view? Do you not still remember your laborious struggle for freedom and inde∣pendence? and while the name of the departed WASHINGTON is whispered in your ears, does not the tear of deep root∣ed affection, steal down your cheeks and bedew his Urn? He was only a man, true; but he was instrumental, in reco∣vering you from a state of servitude, and restoring to you liberty and peace.</P>
<P>Let your hearts now glow with grati∣tude, to the supreme author of such de∣liverance, and let your conduct bear wit∣ness, that you have not forgotten him who is the rock of your salvation.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="038921_0010_1012FD3FE436C850"/>
For a moment, let us turn our atten∣tion to the awful scenes exhibited on Long Island; now, the asylum of peace and plenty, but then, the prison of des∣pair.</P>
<P>An armed fleet with spreading canvass, and weather beaten prows, approach your shore. At the sight of so formidable a foe, every face gathers paleness;—and the woeful shrieks of the desponding mother—re-echo's from house to house.</P>
<P>At this time of dread and terror, when your villages are ransacked—the affright∣ed inhabitants dispersed—your solemn sanctuaries converted into schools of horse∣manship—the receptacles of filth—or the theatres of slaughter!—Your peaceable clergy driven from their sacred pulpits—the holy worship of the great GOD, trampled under foot—and your dwellings of repose the dens of plunderers!—I say, at this critical juncture, when all human probability of future success seemed to terminate—did not the name of WASH∣INGTON, reanimate your drooping spi∣rits,
<PB N="11" REF="038921_0011_1012FD44B8834900"/>
and stimulate every nerve to deeds of bravery?—Your country's fate was now in vibration; on one side were seen the heavy burdened ships, fraught with the implements of destruction—to swim to your devoted city—while on the heights of Brooklyn, on the other, was posted your army.</P>
<P>The haughty foe, in different columns advance, and bid defiance to all opposi∣tion.—At Flatbush a skirmish ensues—the contents of loaded muskets, are heard to rattle thro' woods, and the whistling of bullets, becomes the music of the day. Thro' ill conduct,—disorder, confusion, and flight succeed; a whole army are on the brink of ruin, but the Almighty preserver of our injured country, now interposes his protecting arm.—A thick and cloudy vapour pendent in the atmos∣phere, o'er the ships and army of the e∣nemy, suspends every hostile operation.—Then, at midnight's gloomy hour—when all nature laid absorb'd in sleep—and moon and stars, refus'd to give their light! The immortal WASHINGTON!
<PB N="12" REF="038921_0012_1012FD46404A7298"/>
the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Not a Meteor, but a Sun. Dr. LINN.</NOTE> Sun of America arose, and with his trusty men, in silence crossed to Man∣hattan's shore, and by matchless skill ex∣peditiously effected the most memorable retreat ever accomplished by military art; or, ever recorded in the annals of history.</P>
<P>You well know that he regarded not the prowess, the ambition and fury of that aspiring nation, with whom you fought in defence of your liberties.</P>
<P>Amidst all the embarassments, the dif∣ficulties and dangers to which he was emi∣nently exposed, in our revolutionary war—his deportment was uniformly brave and dignified; and every action of his life, demonstrative of patriotism.</P>
<P>Compare, with his zeal in the gene∣rous cause, and with his invincible love of country; the inferior number of his soldiers, their rude and undisciplined state; the want of ammunition, of arms, and various other necessaries; and you mark in him the characteristics of true
<PB N="13" REF="038921_0013_10123211A845DC38"/>
magnanimity. Let the heights of Prince∣ton testify—and while you with astonish∣ment admire his virtues—his peerless worth—and unrivalled fame: Succeeding generations will unite with you in ex∣claiming—What a MAN! What a HE∣RO!</P>
<P>With the assistance of a foreign pow∣er,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is perhaps of little use to investigate the motives, which induced France, to support the American cause. Her assistance was without doubt highly useful, in re∣covering our rights; and for this, a suitable acknowledg∣ment has been made. That her conduct since has proved unfriendly, nay hostile to our Republic, is too obvious. In regard to us, she now stands on a level with Great Bri∣tain; we are indebted to neither for much civility. It is sound policy, with decent▪ firmness, to guard against the diplomatic skill and intrigues of both; and to stand aloof from the one, as the rock of Scylla—to shun the other, as the quicksands of Charybdis.</NOTE> the American chief persevered in what he so virtuously began, under the watchful eye of the omnipotent Being, who taught him to plant in this new world, the victorious standard of liber∣ty, which "lights up a smile in the as∣pect of woe."</P>
<LG>
<L>Without this—" What is life?</L>
<L>'Tis not to stalk about, and draw fresh air</L>
<L>From time to time, or gaze upon the sun;</L>

After many conflicts, and disappoint∣ments, he closed a war in freedom and independence; but not without the sa∣crifice of a WARREN—a MONTGOME∣RY—a MERCER—a WOOSTER, and others, whose names will ever sparkle in the catalogue of warriors. He, repairs to our national council, to surrender to them, the important trust, committed to his hands. The hour now approached to complete, and forever to fix, the patriotic character of the American chief. In the presence of an august assembly he for∣mally resigns; and replete with honor and glory, he retires like Cincinnatus, to his farm—there to rest from the fatigu∣ing labours of war, and to enjoy the comforts of domestic life.</P>
<P>Hail happy, eventful period! the din of war is hushed—the bloody sword returns to its scabbard: the raging storm is over—Your villages and cities, which,
<PB N="15" REF="038921_0015_1012FD4E5DC47008"/>
had been wrapt in flames, threatning uni∣versal havoc, are now evacuated: Victo∣ry is the motto inscribed on every front, and Americans, with nodding plumes rally round the standard of triumphant liberty.</P>
<P>The Farmer now secure from danger, may sow his seed, and, unmolested by the hostile foe, in due time reap the fruits of his labour, at evening enjoy the social comforts of his own fire side, and at night securely repose on the bed of peace. Commerce now begins to unfurl her ban∣ners, and our ships in safety plough the ocean. The arts and sciences begin to flourish, and genius like the sun just bursting from behind a cloud, diffuses through the darkness of ignorance her resplendent beams.</P>
<P>To begin and perfect his character as a lawgiver, he is called from the sweets of retirement to form and sign a constitu∣tion, which should regulate, while it dignifies the conduct of Americans.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="038921_0016_1012FD4FF3F0F770"/>
The character of this truly wonderful man, though uniformly great, is not yet complete; his cup of fame is not yet filled up: for as the wise disposer of events had determined, he must ascend the summit of human greatness. Hea∣ven's high decree was, that he should be the ruler, the father of that family, which he had rescued from bondage: Having led you in war, he must also conduct in peace; and roll his vigilant parental eye over you, his beloved children.</P>
<P>Again, he is called by unanimous voice to be the President of the United States. Their dearest rights, and blood-bought privileges are committed to his guardianship. A wreath of fresh laurels entwines his illustrious brow, and the distinguished father of his country with becoming dignity supports the load of massy honors. His wisdom, his equani∣mity, his justice remain inflexible: not less vigilant than brave, he guides the helm of government the same, in war
<PB N="17" REF="038921_0017_1012FD56A98F09C0"/>
and peace: the same, in skies serene and calm, as during the fury of the storm.</P>
<P>By his wonderful counsel he overawes nations which are enveloped in war—which threaten general devastation—and hasten to hurl, order into confusion:—while a free people, with gratitude mark∣ed in every feature, look at, and admire their virtuous—their noble patron; and hail the auspicious aera in which they live! Unlike kings or princes who con∣sider their own aggrandizement as a pri∣mary object; he invariably discovers the love of country, and the incomparable value of that independence which was bought and sealed with blood, by nobly refusing every pecuniary consideration, as a reward for his services, having his steady and penetrative eye fixed on the constitution, the best, and wisest, ever devised by man; esteeming it sacred and inviolable—he governs to the admiration, and astonishment of mortals; never fail∣ing to consult the good of his country; the ease, the comfort, the happiness of
<PB N="18" REF="038921_0018_1012320FE7982390"/>
you, the sons and daughters of <HI>Colum∣bia.</HI></P>
<P>Being at length wearied with so great a care, and making rapid strides towards old age—he, once more retires to Mount Vernon's shade, where the unparalleled Hero, closes a well spent life.—His cha∣racter being now complete, nothing more remained for him to do.—Nature said, it is enough:—He had finished his course, and fully answered the purposes of hea∣ven.</P>
<P>Americans, what means this general mourning—these sable shrouds which strike the mind, with such unusual grief? Why, this universal sadness which per∣vades every countenance? Ah! the an∣swer is too obvious.—America has lost her brightest jewel—her inestimable treasure, is removed for <HI>ever.</HI></P>
<P>You, cannot now be blind to the un∣erring councils of heaven, nor to the in∣stability of all human grandeur.—Great, as our WASHINGTON was, his body
<PB N="19" REF="038921_0019_1012FD59B6B82208"/>
must be left to moulder into dust—but his immortal spirit snatched from its te∣nement of clay, survives the dissolution. Like the poor, the rich, the young, the aged, the noble, and ignoble—he must stoop under the all governing hand, and close his eyes in the sleep of death.—But, with such astonishing magnanimi∣ty, as strictly accorded with all his for∣mer actions.</P>
<P>Will any attempt to weigh in the scale of greatness: a Themistocles, who de∣fended Athens from the mighty host of Xerxes; an Epaminondas, who called his immortal sons, Leuctra and Manti∣nea,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Towns in Beotia and Arcadia.</NOTE> or an Alexander, who boasted in the conquest of the world; while a slave to irregular appetites, and follies; but never made a people free and independ∣ent; nor made them in point of privi∣leges and honor, the admiration of the world; nor loosened them from the shackles of increasing tyranny.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="038921_0020_1012FD5F09F41498"/>
WASHINGTON, as a Man was great; as a General, the greatest; and as a Ma∣gistrate, unequalled.</P>
<P>In him, were treasured all the virtues, which can make a man respected, be∣loved, and admired. Orphans will miss a guardian;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is a fact, well known, that he contributed liberally to the support of orphans at Alexandria.</NOTE> an army, a leader; our country, a patron; and the world a friend. His strict attention on the du∣ties of religion, evinced the sense he en∣tertained of a dependence on his Crea∣tor, and that if he neglected the means of grace, must like the reprobate; be for ever spurned from the divine pre∣sence.</P>
<P>A man of such amiable qualities, dis∣tinguished by such heroic atchievements, may emphatically be called, great.</P>
<P>Freemen! be thankful, that once you enjoyed this gift, improve the blessings resulting from it; be our souls filled with love, to the Supreme Giver of all good;
<PB N="21" REF="038921_0021_1012FD62509B4050"/>
who hath so liberally scattered his bles∣sings over our land; who, hath made us a distinguished people, and ranked us with the nations of the earth.</P>
<P>Alas! how wretched would have been our condition, had not the LORD, been on our side. He it is, who upheld, and supported you, when in war; and for∣saketh not in peace. While we sit toge∣ther under this solemn roof, let it be our firm resolution, with hands on our breasts, henceforth to declare our sin∣cere gratitude, in that we are yet the mo∣numents of divine mercy, and that we are, neither the dupes, nor the vassals, of a foreign power.</P>
<P>Ye respected Militia, who enjoy the vigour of manhood, and an invincible glow of the love of country: Ye, whose deep engraven motto, is, liberty, and in∣dependence: You, are the security; the defence; the bulwark, of our country. Altho' each of you, now sit under the shade of the peaceful olive; and gently
<PB N="22" REF="038921_0022_1012FD658DB82560"/>
fanned, by the cooling zephyrs, breathe a purer air: Yet, the cloud of direful alarm may again brood over this wes∣tern hemisphere, and burst on its millions.</P>
<P>Be thoughtful, be ready, be prepared: so that if duty, if necessity, if your coun∣try's call, should again be sounded, by the shrill trumpet of war;—with the sword of justice girt about you, and the plate of righteousness sealed to your bosoms: you may boldly encounter your hostile invad∣ers, secure your constitution and laws in∣violate, and preserve your rights and liber∣ties to the latest ages of posterity.</P>
<P>Learn then, to copy the example of your illustrious chief, whom indulgent heaven so greatly favored. Be taught by him, who for eight toilsome years led on your brave ancestors, and crowned them with wreaths of honor which time shall never fade.—Realize the state in which your country once was involved: when, terror spread through the martial camp—
<PB N="23" REF="038921_0023_1012FD68D7A12220"/>
when horror seized the philanthropic breast. Compare it with its present state; now peace, order, and harmony prevail. Let the love of country; of religion, and gratitude to GOD; be your prevailing characteristics; for with this, you shall be happy.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON, who but lately resum∣ed the command and chief of your armies; to prepare against a foreign invasion, is no more! He is gone to the region of un∣ceasing being, never—never to return. Where you—where I—also, soon must go. Death, the unconquerable sum∣moner—the King of terrors—cited him to his eternal home.</P>
<P>But, while immortality solemnly pro∣claims, that he lives, in the world of spirits; the grateful memorial of his vir∣tuous exploits, shall live in our bosoms.</P>
<P>Teach your children, and your chil∣dren's children, the unrivalled character of WASHINGTON, great in war, great in
<PB N="24" REF="038921_0024_1012FD6A5BC63EA8"/>
peace: and they, like us, will drop the tear of affection, on the Urn of our de∣parted Hero.</P>
