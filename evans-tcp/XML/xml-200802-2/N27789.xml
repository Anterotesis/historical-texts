<OPENER><SALUTE>BRETHREN AND FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE occasion on which we are assembled, is both mournful and glorious. It cannot fail to excite the different and opposite emotions of joy and sorrow in the breast of every true American. This day gave birth to that illustrious <HI>hero, patri∣ot, sage,</HI> who in war was our host; in peace our father and friend—the guardian genius of our liberties civil and sacred; the political savior of his country. This day, a WASHINGTON was born! It has long been celebrated by a grateful people, as a day peculiarly auspicious to our coun∣try; a day, when kind Heaven, pitying the ab∣ject and servile condition of our American Israel, gave us a second Moses, who should, (under God) be our future deliverer from the bondage and ty∣ranny of haughty Britain. As such, it ought
<PB N="6" REF="037036_0004_100C319A01F88C10"/>
ever to be remembered with religious gratitude and praise, to the great Ruler of nations, who setteth up one and pulleth down another; who crusheth the proud tyrants of the earth; and hath, in his governing Providence, raised us to such eminence among the nations of the world.</P>
<P>But alas! how changed the scene! Columbia's boast, the friend of man, the ornament of the hu∣man race, the great, the illustrious WASHING∣TON is no more! <HI>For, behold, the Lord, the Lord of hosts, hath taken away from us, the stay and the staff—the mighty man, and the man of war, the judge—and the prudent, and the Ancient—the honorable man, and the Counsellor—and the eloquent orator.</HI> This is the man whose death we deplore. The professed design of our meeting is, "publicly to testify our grief" for this melancholy Providence. God grant that we may be suitably affected with it, that we may feel this stroke of his rod, and receive cor∣rection.</P>
<P>Tho the expressions of sorrow with many, may be carried to an unpardonable excess, and wear the aspect of idolatry to a fellow-creature, yet there is a manifest propriety, that when the father either of a family, or of a country, is removed by death, the children should appear in the habili∣ments and attitude of mourning. WASHING∣TON was our father and friend; he is gone. Grat∣itude and decency require that we should pay
<PB N="7" REF="037036_0005_100C37E077E7F748"/>
suitable respect to his memory. It is a duty, sanc∣tioned by reason, and also by custom, from time immemorial. The holy scriptures relate various instances of the kind, with seeming approbation. <HI>"When Moses died in the land of Moab</HI> (we are told) <HI>that all the children of Israel mourned and wept for him, thirty days, in the plains of Moab.</HI> Also, <HI>when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron, thirty days, even all the house of Israel. And when Samuel died, all Israel lamented him."</HI> The distinguished moral and patriotic vir∣tues of these men, rendered them eminently ser∣viceable to their country. Their loss was severely felt by every friend to virtue, to religion, and their country's weal. Hence, they were long la∣mented, and intombed in the memory of an affec∣tionate people. And shall our beloved WASH∣INGTON, who has been instrumental of equal or greater good in a political view, than some of them, be soon forgotten? Forbid it, Heaven! Tho he be dead as to his mortal part, he lives in our memories; his example lives; his virtues live and shall, while eternal ages roll. Our chil∣dren's children and generations yet unborn, we trust, will experience the glorious effects of his la∣bors and exploits. All who tread Columbia's happy ground, and breathe the air of genuine freedom; or who read the history, or hear the same of him, who brake the yoke of despotism from
<PB N="8" REF="037036_0006_100C37E28028E4C0"/>
our necks, and taught America to be free, if a drop of virtuous blood flow in their veins, if they have any claim to benevolence, or the common feelings of men, will rise up and call him blessed.</P>
<P>Can we better answer the design of our meet∣ing at this time, than to employ a few moments in contemplating the leading traits in the charac∣ter of our departed friend; and while we feel grateful to the Father of mercies, for the bestow∣ment and long continuance of so rich a blessing, humble ourselves under this frown of his Provi∣dence, in taking him away?</P>
<P>At an early period of life, did he begin his ca∣reer of public services, and not until the late pe∣riod of almost <HI>"threescore years and ten"</HI> were his labors finished; when he was released by the an∣gel of death. At the age of little more than twenty two, when youth in general, but just be∣gin to assume the rank and title of men, young WASHINGTON was chief Colonel of a regi∣ment. As we were then subject to our parent Britain, and engaged with her in a war against our mutual foes, the French and Indians, it was our hero's lot to fight under the banner of the English Commander. When General Braddock was defeated, at the banks of the Monongahela, and lost the greater part of his army, Colonel WASHINGTON discovered so much martial skill and bravery, both in the battle, and in collecting
<PB N="9" REF="037036_0007_100C37E4403F3798"/>
and conducting the retreat of the few who sur∣vived, as led many judicious men to prognosti∣cate his future greatness; And, it was then gen∣erally believed, that had <HI>he</HI> had the command of the army, instead of being repulsed, he would have gained a victory. After the close of that war, he served his country in various respectable offices, such as Justice of the Peace, Judge of the Court, &amp;c;.; which he filled with peculiar digni∣ty and unshaken fidelity.</P>
<P>Here we leave him until a new scene opens, when he is to take a more conspicuous part upon the theatre of public action.</P>
<P>In consequence of the violent and oppressive measures adopted, by the imperious parliament of Great Britain, respecting her colonies here, by which, as well as by divers base and insidious arts, she endeavored to reduce them to a state of slave∣ry; after frequent prayers, entreaties, and re∣monstrances, were addressed to the throne, to no purpose; after every milder attempt for a redress of grievances proved abortive, America, as the last resort, has recourse to arms. A leader is wanted to conduct her forth to battle. The pub∣lic eye is immediately directed to WASHING∣TON, who is appointed, by Congress, to the chief command of the American Armies. Incon∣ceivable were the hardships he experienced, dur∣ing a long and bloody war, which he bore with unparalleled firmness and equanimity of mind.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="037036_0008_100C37E635BE8F68"/>
At the head of troops, raw and undisciplined, at first, deemed as rebels risen up against their law∣ful sovereign, himself under the weight of a pro∣scription, thereby exposed to the bloody dagger of every midnight assassin, as well as to open ene∣mies of his own country, who might slay him with the hope not only of impunity but of re∣ward; he was called to attack a regular and powerful foe, experienced in the art of war, ac∣customed to victory, and fighting under the aus∣pices of a distinguished monarch, who might in∣spire them with courage and zeal for the combat. Under all these disadvantages, an eye of reason could see but a very faint prospect of success; <HI>a peradventure,</HI> or an <HI>if perhaps</HI> the enemy might by the interposition of kind Providence, be obliged to withdraw, and America be saved from ruin. How peculiar must have been the feelings of our hero in this very critical situation, to reflect, that he must actually conquer or die! For in his con∣dition, to be vanquished, was inevitable death. But far from being intimidated by this awful consideration, under the weight of which, the spirits of many worthy men would have sunk, trusting (as we believe) in the God of armies, who saves neither by few nor by many, putting his life in his hand, he bid defiance to every danger, and boldly marched against the enemies of his be∣loved country.</P>
<P>Being frequenly repulsed, at the beginning (as
<PB N="11" REF="037036_0009_100C37E8D18D7C08"/>
might reasonably be expected, by a superior force) with the loss of many valuable lives, and others captured, among whom were officers of distinc∣tion, and loosing especially (in the year 1776) sev∣eral garrisons of men and military stores at the White Plains, so called, finding himself reduced to a feeble state for aggression or self-defence, he was obliged to retreat in a long and tedious route, of ninety miles, thro the Jersies, to the river Del∣aware. His army was greatly diminished; the time of service for the most of them was expir∣ed; and the few that remained were brought to the greatest extremities for food and clothing. The number was finally reduced to seventeen hun∣dred,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At a later period of the war, he had but 1500 effective troops.</NOTE> and closely pursued by the enemy. Many citizens, and those too of distinction, daily revolt∣ed to the royal standard. In this situation, our General was under the most alarming apprehen∣sions for his own personal safety, as well as for the fate of his country, which seemed destined to in∣evitable ruin. Who, but a WASHINGTON, could have retained the calm possession of his mind in this dark and gloomy day! His reply to Colonel Reed, who answered in the language of discouragement respecting any support from the inhabitants of Pennsylvania, fully shows the un∣ruffled state of his soul, when surrounded with dangers, and plunged in the depths of adversity. "My neck, says he, (stroking it with his hand) does not feel as tho it was made for a halter.
<PB N="12" REF="037036_0010_100C37EB27A45C78"/>
We must retire to Augusta County in Virginia. Numbers will be obliged to repair to us for safe∣ty; and me must try what we can do in carry∣ing on a predatory war; and, if overpowered, we must cross the Alleghany Mountains, &amp;c;."</P>
<P>But soon, kind Heaven interposed, and fought for our American Israel. The army was greatly augmented by order of Congress, as well as by volunteers of almost all description of men who came in great numbers, to join them. And al∣tho there were difficulties innumerable to en∣counter, yet thro the skill and bravery of our General, under the smiles of a merciful Provi∣dence, divers advantages were gained over the enemy; and affairs, for a while, seemed to wear a more favorable aspect.</P>
<P>It is not our design, however, to give a history of the revolutionary war. Our business is to notice some of the excellent virtues and qualifications of the supreme commander. With what incompar∣able fortitude did he sustain martial toils and dan∣gers! How faithfully did he fulfill the important trust committed to him, when endowed with full power from Congress to appoint officers—" to reform and new modle the military arrangements"—and in fine to dispose of the persons and prop∣erties of his fellow-citizens, (when exigencies re∣quired it,) almost according to his pleasure! With matchless skill he managed the manoeuvres of war, so as to avoid an engagement, unless he could do
<PB N="13" REF="037036_0011_100C37ECB16F6D10"/>
it on equal or advantageous ground, but improv∣ing every opportunity to worry and harrass the enemy, and obstruct their progress.</P>
<P>He experienced a frequent shift of fortune; sometimes prosperous—at others, in a situation the most desperate, when in his own opinion, nothing but the stupidity and infatuation of the enemy could prevent his ruin.</P>
<P>In addition to the hazards of war, he had the mortification to find various attempts, in Con∣gress, to displace him from office, or to raise another over him. But Providence had design∣ed him as the deliverer of his country, and the divine purposes were not to be frustrated. His behavior, on this and other trying occasions, was such as spoke at once the greatness of his soul and his humble trust and dependance on that Being, who rules in the affairs of men, and dis∣poses them according to his pleasure.</P>
<P>Tho, in the course of the war, he obtained sev∣eral victories which were far from inconsiderable ones, and some of them brilliant; it was not the number and splendor of these which so highly dis∣tinguished his fame as a General, but the wisdom and prudence he discovered in determining when it might be expedient to engage the foe, when to forbear; and his faithfulness always to follow the determinations of his judgement, in matters of such moment. By his wisdom, prudence, and
<PB N="14" REF="037036_0012_100C37EFAA7308F0"/>
fidelity, and expertness in the art of war, by the blessing of the God of war, he carried us thro a long and painful struggle for liberty—wholly de∣feated the designs of Britain to enslave us—and secured our peace, liberty, and independence. Having accomplished the important business, for which he was called to the command of our ar∣mies, he resigned his commission to the power that gave it, and again mingling with his fellow∣citizens, retired to enjoy the sweets of domestic tranquillity.</P>
<P>But tho the independence of the United States was acknowledged, by the Court of Britain, and they were left to the calm possession of their rights, they yet found themselves in a very unhappy sit∣uation, with respect to maintaining that liberty and independence, for which they had fought and bled. The articles of confederation, which were framed in the time of war, and well answer∣ed their design, when the states were united to∣gether, from principles of self-defence against an invading foe; were found utterly inadequate to the purpose, in a time of peace and security from foreign danger. A new mode of government is formed; a Congress, consisting of members from the several states, is elected, and WASH∣INGTON, the man of war, is called to preside in the Cabinet of the Nation.</P>
<P>Here his wisdom, patriotism, and virtue, shone with distinguished lustre. Unawed by popular
<PB N="15" REF="037036_0013_100C37F1A35201E8"/>
clamor, and the threats of aspiring demagogues, on the one hand, or by the complaints of those who might wish for too rigid an administration, on the other, he stood firm and unshaken, amid political tumults and commotions, like a mighty rock amid the dashing waves of the sea. Actuat∣ed by no party spirit, and detesting the idea of foreign influence, he made the peace and wel∣fare of his country his object, which he was ever concerned to promote.</P>
<P>While, with a scrupulous faith, he observed the treaties and engagements with foreign pow∣ers, his idea was that America ought not to put confidence in any other nation further, than it was for the interest of that nation to befriend her. Upon this principle, he thought it unreasonable that we should continue our gratitude to France, after we had made her full compensation for her services, and especially when she had actually be∣come our enemy. All obligations to her for past services are now cancelled, and it is treasonable to talk of gratitude to our country's foe. It was his wish, however, to observe a neutral position to∣ward all the contending powers of Europe, and he issued his proclamation for that purpose.</P>
<P>The measure was highly approved by the su∣preme legislature, as well as by the most judicious and enlightened of their constituents. To this policy, which he had adopted, and which he sup∣posed
<PB N="16" REF="037036_0014_100C37F331C41CC0"/>
both expedient and just, he strictly adher∣ed in spite of all the efforts of foreign intruders, or of the turbulent and seditious at home. The event fully justified the measure, and proved the wisdom and prudence of adopting it. In conse∣quence hereof, America has enjoyed peace with all its concomitant blessings, while in Europe the ear was grated with the horrid din of arms—the streets flowed with human blood—and every breast was filled with consternation and terror.</P>
<P>AMERICANS! It is owing to the labors of your faithful WASHINGTON, accompanied with the blessing of Heaven, that war, with all its hor∣rors and direful effects, is not now experienced in our land. Yea, let us look further back and say, to his faithful services, under God, we are indebted for our liberty and independence; for our very existence as a nation. But for him, you might have still been under the yoke of bondage to a foreign nation, or bound with fetters of iron. Long ere this day, your children might have been torn from your arms—your wives from your bos∣oms, and sacrificed to the rage, or brutality of monsters, in human form. It becomes you then, this day, gratefully to remember that he carried you thro a long and bloody war; for you, he was <HI>in perils,</HI> not only among open enemies, but <HI>in perils among false brethren;</HI> for you, he fought and bled; defeated the murderous designs of your enemies—and gave you a respectable rank
<PB N="17" REF="037036_0015_100C37F5CCB34C08"/>
among the nations of the earth. And tho, ex∣cessively fond of domestic retirement, he hesitated not at the unanimous call of his country, to sacri∣fice every partial desire to the general good. Be∣hold him placed at the head of a free and enlight∣ened nation! Which event excited joy in every breast; and gladened every countenance. Twice, by the unanimous suffrages of the people, he was called to the presidential chair. The third time, he was excused at his own pressing desire, which he was pleased to think perfectly consistent with duty, and a regard for the public welfare.</P>
<P>Short was his enjoyment of the pleasures ac∣companying a rural and domestic life. A diabol∣ical phrensy seizes a foreign power; unreasonable complaints are made of injustice and partiality; our commerce is obstructed; hostilities are actual∣ly committed upon our seamen; war is threaten∣ed under the specious pretence of retaliation for injuries, which in fact never existed. His coun∣try calls, and WASHINGTON again steps forth from his loved retirement, into public action. He is appointed <HI>General and Commander in chief of all the armies raised, or to be raised, for the service of the United States.</HI> The main object was to repel the expected invasions of our apostate allies; a po∣tent and insidious nation. He accepted the ap∣pointment with that profound humility, modesty, and diffidence, with which he had accepted every other; which are generally indications of real
<PB N="18" REF="037036_0016_100C37F833274E70"/>
worth; and the usual concomitants of a truly great and good man. His letter to the Presi∣dent, on the important occasion, breathes a spirit of genuine love to his country; of indignation at the infamous conduct of its enemies; and en∣tire confidence in the administrations of our gov∣ernment.</P>
<P>It has been said, that our beloved WASHING∣TON was not a patriot; that he was not a true friend to the country that gave him birth, and in whose immediate service, he spent the most of his life. Now, if there where no sin in aspersing the character of the greatest and best of men, I would not hazard the assertion under the price of my own reputation, that he, who served his country in various important stations for more than forty years, who for a considerable and the most distinguished part of which, would accept no compensation, and whose manifest probity and uprightness of conduct, during this long period were unparelleled by any of similar circumstances in the annals of time; I would not for my hon∣ors sake risque the assertion, that this venerable character was not a friend to his country and its welfare. Let the shameful and ill-grounded sus∣picion be forever banished from the breast of Americans. If our illustrious friend did not pos∣sess true patriotism, the sublime virtue exists no where, but in a dreaming imagination. Who is a patriot, but one who loves his country? Who
<PB N="19" REF="037036_0017_100C37F9C18338E8"/>
loves his country, but he who improves all op∣portunities to do her good? Who has ever done this, if WASHINGTON has not? He has spent his life and strength in her service, without any considerable reward but that of fame. Ungrate∣ful is the wretch, who by slander and reproach, would deprive him of this small pittance. His heart must be harder than adamant; <HI>his tongue is set on fire of Hell.</HI></P>
<P>Tho great minds are not easily moved with trifling occurrences, yet they undoubtedly have feeling, as well as any of us. The arrows of slander must affect them in a very sensible manner, especially when coming from those in whose ser∣vice they are employed, and from whom, they might reasonably expect the most unfeigned friendship and purest affection. "O, (methinks I hear him say) it was not an avowed enemy that thus reproached me; then I could have borne it, neither was it he that professedly hated me, that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him; but it was thou, mine acquaintance—my countryman—we took sweet counsel together—we fought and bled together for self-defence against our mutual foes. We enjoy the same soil and priviliges—our interest is one and the same. To plot your ruin would be to effect my own. To seek the injury of my fellow-citi∣zens, (were my benevolent heart capable of such
<PB N="20" REF="037036_0018_100C37FB494D35D8"/>
wickedness,) I must first become an enemy to my∣self. But I appeal to yourselves—I appeal to ev∣ery impartial mind whether in my own nation or elsewhere—I appeal to the tribunal of my own breast; nay further, I appeal to the tribunal of Heaven, which takes cognizance of all human thoughts and actions, whether I have not always sought the best interests of my country. A zeal for your safety and happiness influenced me, at first, to put my life in my hand, and engage in the horrors of war against an implacable enemy; not knowing whether I should be called <HI>literally</HI> to spill my blood in the unhappy contest. But, a merciful God has spared me, that I might be fur∣ther serviceable to you. Thus, I have waded thro seas of blood, exposed to every danger, enduring incredible hardships for your sakes; and have ever endeavored to act the part of a tender parent toward you. I am now grown grey in your ser∣vice; and were it necessary, would freely sacrifice my life for your good. Then, be not so uncan∣did as to think me your enemy; nor ungrate∣fully pierce that heart with the shafts of calumny, which has ever been engaged to promote your best interest."</P>
<P>But what do we say? We had almost forgotten that our venerable friend is far beyond the reach of calumny, and the reproaches of ungrateful men. He is gone, we trust, <HI>where the wicked cease from troubling, and where the weary are at rest.</HI> How
<PB N="21" REF="037036_0019_100C37FDE520DA30"/>
shall we suitably improve this righteous Provi∣dence of God, in depriving us of one of the great∣est and best of men, at this critical period, when his presence is so much needed to give stability to our union; energy to our government; courage to our armies; and terror to our foes? Let us gratefully record the divine goodness in the be∣stowment of one, who has long been to us a ten∣der father and faithful friend; and humble our∣selves under the solemn consideration, that for our sins, he hath in judgment taken him away. This is the rod of God's anger, wherewith he often punishes a froward people in this world. Blessings which are ungratefully received and misimproved are often withdrawn, at a time, when they are greatly needed. The stroke of his rod upon us, at this time, is heavy, but it must be borne;—yea, the consideration that we are guil∣ty, and that God has a right to punish us, should induce us <HI>patiently</HI> to submit. This does not ex∣clude a realizing sense of our loss, or a public manifestation of our grief on the account of it. On such an occasion as this, not to mourn, would argue insensibility indeed, if not the blackest in∣gratitude! But how shall we mourn in such a manner as to excite the compassion of our God, and gain the approbation of our own minds? It is the observation of a great poet,
<Q>He mourns the dead who lives as they desire.—
<BIBL><HI>Dr. Young.</HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Let us then pause for a moment, and consider
<PB N="22" REF="037036_0020_100C38004EAC2638"/>
what was probably the wish of our departed friend respecting us. I verily believe, my brethren, <HI>that his heart's desire and daily prayer, for us was,</HI> not only that we might faithfully discharge the duties we owe to our country and to one another, but that we might reverence religion, and serve the God of our fathers with singleness of heart. What else was the language of his own conduct? He was professedly a believer in our holy religion, and altho he was not, by <HI>profession,</HI> a preacher of it, he hesitated not, on what he judged suitable occasions, to inculcate piety and virtue, both as our duty, and as the "great pillars of human happiness." In his address to the first Congress, under the new Constitution, he most devoutly acknowledges the supreme government of the great Jehovah, with our entire dependence on his ruling Providence, and obligations to him for all blessings of whatev∣er nature or kind. It is asserted, by his intimate acquaintance, that in his private life, he was pious and exemplary; that he was constant in his closet devotions, and particularly in times of difficulty and danger, he failed not to ask counsel at the throne of grace. Nor did he neglect the public worship of his Maker and christian sacraments, as the manner of too many is.</P>
<P>O, how would the vicious and profane—the wicked of every class shudder, and shrink into nothing, in the presence of such a character! How gladly then will they call upon the rocks and
<PB N="23" REF="037036_0021_100C3801D9BD3BC0"/>
mountains to fall on them, and to hide them from the presence of that tremendous Being, who is in∣finitely holy; whose eye penetrates all disguises; in whose sight the very angels are impure—and whose word makes all Heaven, Earth, and Hell to tremble!</P>
<P>Let us, as a suitable improvement of the death of our worthy friend, strive to imitate his sublime virtues, public and private, according to our sev∣eral capacities and spheres of action; especially his fervent piety, which is necessary for persons in the meanest station, as well as in the highest. Let his holy example live in our memories; and his moral and patriotic; virtues be deeply imprinted in our hearts.</P>
<P>His death, it is said, was agreeable to the tenor of his life. He was unterrified at its awful ap∣proach, and bore it with entire submission to the will of Heaven. How does this solemn event, and the manner of it, teach us both the power of re∣ligion, and the vanity and insufficiency of human wisdom and greatness to ward off the fatal arrow! How does it admonish us <HI>"not to put our trust in Princes, in whom there is no help; for their breath go∣eth forth; they return to their earth; in that very day their thoughts perish."</HI> Hereby also, we are admon∣ished that we are mortal beings. For if the great∣est, the wisest, and best of men, die, certainly <HI>we</HI> can expect <HI>"no discharge in that war."</HI> We must all follow our beloved WASHINGTON, thro the
<PB N="24" REF="037036_0022_100C380444CEF118"/>
dreary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or yea, we must meet him at the bar of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> judge and answer for the manner in which we received and improved him as a merci∣ful gift of Heaven. How greatly then, are we concerned, yet to improve by his precept and ex∣cellent example!
