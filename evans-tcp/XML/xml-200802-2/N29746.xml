<HEAD>A LETTER, About a Good Management under the Distemper of the MEASLES, at this time Spreading in the Country. Here Published for the Benefit of the Poor, and such as may want the help of Able Physicians.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Good Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE <HI>Measles</HI> are a Distemper which in <HI>Europe</HI> ordinarily proves a Light Malady: but in these parts of <HI>America</HI> it proves a very heavy Calamity; A Malady <HI>Grievous</HI> to most, <HI>Mortal</HI> to many, &amp; leaving pernicious Relicks behind it in All. Because the Sickness is now spreading in all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rts; and its <HI>Malignity</HI> increases, as the <HI>Winter</HI> advances, and <HI>Good Physicians</HI> are not every where at hand for the Relief of the Sick, and a very <HI>nice Management</HI> of the Case is requisite: You are now addressed with a short <HI>Letter of Advice</HI> concerning it.</P>
<P>You will by no means forget the first and main Care, which is, To <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an Eye unto the Glorious GOD, who is, <HI>The Lord our Healer.</HI> You are no Stranger to <HI>Exod.</HI> XV. 26. <HI>Psal.</HI> CVIII. 12. and XLI. 4. One of the most Learned and Famous Physicians that ever was in the World, the Great <HI>Kirstenius,</HI> has this reported of him; He would <HI>ordinarily do nothing for his Patients, till he saw them first hopefully Reconciled unto God.</HI></P>
<P>It should be Remembred, That multitudes of Lives have been Sa∣ved, in the <HI>Measles</HI> as well as in the <HI>Small-pox,</HI> by peoples being at last perswaded out of the pernicious Methods of <HI>Over-doing,</HI> and <HI>Over-heat∣ing,</HI> and giving Things to <HI>force Nature</HI> out of its own orderly way of proceeding. Before we go any further, Let this Advice for the <HI>Sick,</HI> be principally attended to; <HI>Don't kill 'em!</HI> That is to say, With mischie∣vous Kindness. Indeed, if we stopt here, and said no more, this were enough to save more <HI>Lives,</HI> than our <HI>Wars</HI> have destroy'd.</P>
<P>The Usual Symptoms of an <HI>Arrest</HI> from the <HI>Measles</HI> are, An <HI>Head∣ake;</HI> Troubles in the <HI>Eyes;</HI> a Dry <HI>Cough;</HI> an Oppression on the <HI>Breast</HI> or <HI>Stomach;</HI> or a pain there, and in the <HI>Back</HI> and Limbs; and some∣times a <HI>Faintness,</HI> with <HI>Sickness,</HI> perhaps <HI>Vomiting,</HI> or <HI>Griping</HI> and <HI>Pur∣ging;</HI> A <HI>Thirst,</HI> with a constant <HI>Fever,</HI> which is mild at first, but grows high enough before it has done.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="039577_0002_10147BC75AE43B48"/>
When such Symptoms of the Sickness, bid your Friend look about him, let him not throw away his Life by not being <HI>Sick soon enough.</HI></P>
<P>If the Symptoms are <HI>Gentle,</HI> and the person can yet claim his place at the Table, or can bear to Sit up, Let him do so, till the <HI>Red Specks</HI> begin to show themselves. But let him keep <HI>house,</HI> and keep <HI>warm;</HI> not dare to expose himself. Let him <HI>feed sparingly</HI> and on a very <HI>Easy Food.</HI> Tho' an Hourly Appearance of the Enemy may be Expected, yet be not in an Hurry. No Haste of your <HI>Hot Things:</HI> Wait with a little patience. A little <HI>Brimstone</HI> finely powdered, as much as may lie on a <HI>Six-pence,</HI> twice or thrice a day, may do more than Twelve penniworth of Service.</P>
<P>If there be any Shocking <HI>Violence</HI> in the Symptoms, or the Red Specks begin to make their Appearance, let the person take his <HI>Bed,</HI> and be sure to Lie very <HI>warm,</HI> till all be over. In the Winter, <HI>Infants</HI> are best kept in the <HI>Arms.</HI></P>
<P>Ordinarily, <HI>Sweating</HI> must not be indulged, much less provok<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪ But a comfortable <HI>warmth,</HI> I say, a convenient <HI>warmth,</HI> cannot be too much in∣culcated. As many <HI>Coverings,</HI> as the Times that the word, <HI>Warmth,</HI> oc∣curs in our now speaking of it, may be little enough.</P>
<P>A <HI>Gentle Vomit</HI> in the beginning, has had much Benefit expected from it. Be sure, if there be an <HI>Oppression</HI> by a Body of Phlegm, or an over∣charg'd Stomach, or any thing of a <HI>Nauseous</HI> Inclination, a <HI>Gentle Vomit</HI> is loudly called for.</P>
<P>If there be none of this, but only a <HI>pain</HI> in the Head, and Breast, Back, and Limbs, a moderate <HI>Sweat</HI> may do. It may be procured, by the well-known preparation which is become every bodies First Resort, <HI>Syrup of Saffron and Treacle Water.</HI> A <HI>Tea</HI> of <HI>Sage,</HI> or of <HI>Rosemary,</HI> or a little Mull'd <HI>Cider,</HI> or <HI>Wine</HI> with those Plants infused, will do well. Some can dispense, with an Infusion of the <HI>Snakeweed.</HI> But others are for waving it, as too fiery and enraging in a Distemper which is allow'd by all to be an <HI>Inflammatory Fever.</HI> A <HI>Scabious</HI> Tea will do. There is also a Composition of Hot <HI>Beer</HI> and <HI>Rum</HI> (for which they that are Learned in such potions, do not want a Name,) this <HI>coarse Composition,</HI> has been of Good Consequence. But it must be very <HI>weak;</HI> and it must not be used <HI>often,</HI> if <HI>at all</HI> after the <HI>Measles</HI> appear in the Skin. The use of such Things must be very Temperate; It may be continued until the full Eruption. But I repeat the Admonition against, <HI>Over-doing</HI> and <HI>Over-heating.</HI> It will spoil all.</P>
<P>The <HI>Coarse Composition</HI> aforesaid, will best suit the <HI>pained</HI> Patient. But it will hardly do so well, in <HI>Costive</HI> Bodies; or where the <HI>Breast</HI> is op∣pressed; or where the <HI>Fever</HI> is high, or in too <HI>hot Constitutions.</HI> That
<PB N="3" REF="039577_0003_10147BC996878C30"/>
<HI>Coarse Composition,</HI> 'tis a very strange thing, that if it happen to Do a <HI>Little Good now and then,</HI> people must presently be <HI>Bewitched</HI> with it!</P>
<P>Where the Patient is most prone to be <HI>faint,</HI> a <HI>Balm Tea,</HI> or a Glass of <HI>Wine</HI> a little <HI>Saffronized,</HI> may do very well. Twenty or Thirty Drops of good <HI>Elixir Proprietatis,</HI> have been sometimes very serviceable to them that could be Masters of it, in this as well as many other Cases; But, <HI>this does not happen to every man!</HI></P>
<P>Your Patient is by this time full of the <HI>Measles.</HI> He'll be <HI>Thirsty.</HI> And what shall he do?</P>
<P>If he will venture to drink any thing that is <HI>Cold,</HI> it will be well, if he don't find, <HI>There is Death in the Pot.</HI></P>
<P>Let him Drink a <HI>Tea</HI> of <HI>Balm,</HI> and <HI>Scabious.</HI> If he be <HI>Faint,</HI> or <HI>Sick,</HI> add a little <HI>Saffron.</HI> If he be <HI>Loose,</HI> Let the <HI>Tea</HI> be of <HI>Sage,</HI> or of <HI>Rose-mary.</HI> If he be <HI>Grip't,</HI> it may have <HI>Penny-royal</HI> in it.</P>
<P>But what is to be done, if a <HI>Cough</HI> annoy him? Then a <HI>Pectoral</HI> of Maiden-hair, Anniseed, Liquorice, Raisins, and Figs. <HI>Liquorice</HI> alone, in a Tea, may do. Or, if that can't be had, a Syrup of Maiden-hair, of <HI>Hyssop,</HI> and of <HI>Colts foot.</HI> The <HI>Cough</HI> must not be stopt; you may al∣lay it with <HI>Sugar-Candied,</HI> and with <HI>Buttered Pills;</HI> and the <HI>Pectorals</HI> now prescribed. Or, <HI>Hot Honey</HI> alone will do admirably well.</P>
<P>In hot Constitutions especially, a proper <HI>Drink</HI> would be, <HI>Water with Roasted Apples</HI> in it. Some would add a little <HI>Ginger</HI> to it.</P>
<P>Hot <HI>Cyder,</HI> if it be not <HI>hard,</HI> is an allowable <HI>Drink.</HI></P>
<P>Towards the Heighth of the Distemper, <HI>Hyssop</HI> Tea may be prefer∣rible to <HI>Scabious.</HI> Let the <HI>Diet</HI> (thro' the whole course) be <HI>Thin</HI> e∣nough; Gruels, Caudles, Water-pottage, and the like; and given <HI>Of∣ten</HI> enough.</P>
<P>About the Third or Fourth Day, from the Eruption, will come the <HI>Crisis,</HI> which you call, the <HI>Turning.</HI> And this will be often attended with <HI>Frightful Circumstances;</HI> Grievous Oppression, Fainting, Vomiting, Purging, and the <HI>Vapours,</HI> which is to say in one word, <HI>All that is terri∣ble.</HI> But all will be presently and easily relieved, if Heaven afford a Blessing to a proper Management. Sometimes the sudden Disappea∣rance of the <HI>Measles</HI> give a <HI>Needless Fright.</HI> They have perform'd their course; but the frighted Patient flies to <HI>hot Expellers,</HI> which endanger the raising of a putrefactive Heat, that had better have been spared. Some have observed, That these <HI>Frightful Circumstances</HI> have come with their greatest Fury, where the praevious use of <HI>Hot Things,</HI> which you have been so warn'd about, has been Immoderate.</P>
<P>For the <HI>Oppression,</HI> take <HI>Wine</HI> and <HI>Oil,</HI> (or if the Patient be Loose, let him take, <HI>Rum</HI> and <HI>Oil:</HI>) Give it pretty hot; The Dose two or three
<PB N="4" REF="039577_0004_10160EDD51BF7118"/>
Spoonfuls every Hour, as there may be Occasion; Or, take almost any thing, that will cause a <HI>Vomit</HI> or two. A <HI>Gentle Vomit</HI> at this Time, has Reprieved many a Life, that was just Expiring: Especially when there is a Collection of a wretched <HI>Phlegm,</HI> to be Encountred. The <HI>Wine</HI> and <HI>Oil</HI> is preferrible to the <HI>Rum</HI> and <HI>Oil.</HI> And when a <HI>Vomit</HI> would not relieve the Oppression, the <HI>Wine</HI> &amp; <HI>Oil,</HI> with a Decoction of the <HI>Cooling Seeds,</HI> has presently done it.</P>
<P>You have been taught already what you shall do for <HI>Faintness</HI> in your Patient. Or, Give him a few Drops of the <HI>Spirit of Hartshorn</HI></P>
<P>For his <HI>Vomiting</HI> and <HI>Purging,</HI> you need not go far for a Remedy. Give scalding <HI>Hot water;</HI> Do this, even to nine or ten times, if it be needful, &amp; as he can bear it. Then give a little <HI>Hot Wine</HI> with a bit of toasted <HI>Bread.</HI> Or a little of the <HI>Coarse Composition,</HI> you were formerly told of; Or ano∣ther, that is <HI>akin</HI> to that, and as <HI>well-known</HI> as that. In twenty four hours, more or less, it may be hoped, the Storm will be over.</P>
<P>For a <HI>considerable while</HI> after this, the Patient must be mighty careful of taking any <HI>Cold,</HI> and Eating too soon of any <HI>Flesh-meat.</HI> Let him not be <HI>well too soon,</HI> and throw himself into a <HI>Fever,</HI> and throw away his <HI>Life,</HI> as many have inconsiderately and presumptuously done. Let him <HI>take Time,</HI> and spend his Time, in <HI>Studying to be Thankful.</HI></P>
<P>If a <HI>Cough</HI> continue, let him fly to the usual Remedies. To take a spoon∣ful of shavings of <HI>Castile Soap</HI> in a Glass of Wine or Beer, for a few Nights following, has been very successful for the cure or that inconvenience▪ If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Flux</HI> follow, whether a <HI>common,</HI> or a <HI>Bloody,</HI> a <HI>Tea</HI> made of <HI>Rhubarb,</HI> and sweetened with a Syrup of <HI>Marshmallows,</HI> given daily, so much as to cause one or two Stools, is a way to carry it safely off. The same <HI>Tea</HI> will also carry off the <HI>Worms,</HI> that so often follow the <HI>Measles;</HI> especially in <HI>Children.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Purge</HI> will be necessary for all, that would not have the Venome of the <HI>Measles</HI> remaining in them, and follow'd with many Evil Consequences.</P>
<P>A <HI>Fever</HI> (perhaps that which they call, The <HI>Pleuretick</HI>) too of∣ten follows the <HI>Measles.</HI> But for this, I do not now offer any Directions: A Skilful <HI>Physician</HI> must be consulted withal.</P>
<P>All that is proposed in this Letter, is to direct in the plainest manner that is possible, without any <HI>Terms of Art,</HI> &amp; so that any <HI>Child</HI> may understand, &amp; any <HI>Nurse</HI> may administer, what is to be done, in the single Case of the <HI>Measles:</HI> Which Malady, tho' it be not so <HI>Dangerous</HI> in it self perhaps, as many others are, yet upon the <HI>Least Error</HI> in treating of it, proves as <HI>Dead∣ly,</HI> as most that the poor <HI>Children of Death</HI> fall before. I <HI>know</HI> not (and for some Reasons I have read in a very Ancient Book, I may add, I <HI>care</HI> not,) what <HI>Censures</HI> this Action may meet withal. I am sure, nothing but a pure <HI>Act of Charity to the Poor,</HI> where <HI>Physicians</HI> are wanting, is now intended; nor any thing offered, but what a Number of our most Eminent <HI>Physicians</HI> have approved of, with their Charitable Wishes to have it Communicated; and the helping, tho' of but one or two Miserables, weighs down, against all that may be said, against the Freedom which this Letter has taken. I am satisfied, The Angel of <HI>Bethesda</HI> would Esteem it so. I take Leave;</P>
