<BIBL>II SAMUEL, iii. 38.</BIBL>
<Q>KNOW YE NOT THAT THERE IS A PRINCE AND A GREAT MAN FALLEN THIS DAY IN ISRAEL.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SACRED are the sorrows for departed worth. Just and manly is the sigh, which passes from the bosom at the remembrance of goodness and greatness expired.—When death diffuses uncommon horror by laying his wasteful hand upon wisdom, valour, and every venerable excellence, when human nature loses its nobles, and a nation is in tears, it is virtue to weep; it is religion to be sad. Oh, sons of my country, ye cannot but mourn! Ye, daughters of America, ye are amiably in tears! For <HI>the beauty of our Israel is fallen</HI>—<HI>The staff of its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> is no more!</HI>—Death, giving his strongest proof, that no great∣ness can awe, nor entreaty divert him from his prey, has taken our <HI>Washington</HI> from among us; and we are left to strive to sooth our anguish, by musing upon his virtues, and paying our humble tribute to his name.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="037308_0005_100C8581E07280D8"/>
ON this melancholy occasion, no words occur to me more suitable to guide the meditations of our agitated minds, than the passage I have selected, for the motto of this discourse. It is the tender lamentation of the destined ruler of Israel, at the death of the Commander in Chief of their hosts. While similarity of characters gives pecu∣liar pertinence to the words, they have too a plea in your feelings: for with the most plaintive pathos, which nature can express, sorrow sits speaking from countenance to countenance; and her yet repeated theme is, "there is a PRINCE and a GREAT MAN fallen this day in Israel."</P>
<P>HERE let us consider, what in the eye of reason and Omniscience imparts lustre to the character of a Prince, and constitutes the eminently great man.—We will then pause, and contemplate his exit from the world, with its circumstances, and effects.—And your hearts will expect, what my feelings will dictate, the obvious conclusion; which the occasion requires.</P>
<P>IN the first place, a broad basis of civil greatness is laid by him, who becomes <HI>the noble and virtuous</HI> founder of an empire. To give existence to an independent people, and establish their national being among the kingdoms of the earth, is the sublime work only of uncommon talents. It fills us with lofty conceptions of the character, by whom it is effected; and obtains the admiration of remotest pos∣terity. In all ages, nations with assiduous pride have embalmed the memories of their founders. Time, the demolisher of every glorious fabric, has generally respect∣ed their names. Base measures, and selfish considerations, have sometimes disgraced this vast achievement of man;
<PB N="9" REF="037308_0006_100CB02AA55C9B10"/>
and left us to admire the greatness of the work, without one sentiment of regard for the agent. ROME's founder was ignoble.—The MEDES owed their empire to a monster.—But, the man, who, animated by the generous thought of extending the dominion of liberty, and giving a <HI>distinct</HI> field to the exertions of his countrymen, effects the inde∣pendence and establishment of a nation, who, without other motive, than a desire to render his people great and happy, founds their empire <HI>in right,</HI> and would have it grow by <HI>the vigour of freedom, law, and virtue,</HI> who, regardless of personal emolument, seeks only to be loved by them as their <HI>affectionate civil father,</HI> such a man must be consi∣dered, as raised up by Heaven in a favoured land, to con∣duct one of those grand operations, which involve almost an infinitude of interests; together with the fate, and cha∣racter, of millions of the human race.</P>
<P>To lay this unperishable basis of renown is indeed a rare glory. It has belonged only to a <HI>few</HI> distinguished beings, who have been endowed for the work with un∣common powers and resources. Many have been protect∣ing <HI>rulers</HI> of a people; and raised them to eminent great∣ness and refinement. But, few <HI>virtuous founders</HI> of em∣pires have ennobled the annals of the world.</P>
<P>IN the ruler, however, there are definite characteris∣tics of true greatness and glory. <HI>Wisdom, firmness,</HI> and <HI>integrity,</HI> are the essentials of excellence in a Chief. An active, observing mind, enriched with a knowledge of hu∣man nature, and of the experiments of past ages in govern∣ing men—a prudence, inspiring calm surveys of the natures, prospects, dangers, and resources, of his people—an uni∣form
<PB N="10" REF="037308_0007_100C85836C9E64D0"/>
form collectedness, guarding him against surprize and de∣spondence in urgent moments, enabling him to assert and discharge his duty, and rendering him unmoveable by the calumnies, to which the conspicuous must ever be exposed,—above all, an integrity, which scorns disguise, which impenetrable and lustrous, like polished steel, holds not a moment the breath of flattery nor abuse, which, unaffected by sinister considerations, is anxious only to be faithful to its trust—these are properties, which form the chief, whose glory is pure, and whose greatness is real. In his station as rule<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, he stands like a venerable column, raised by his people's hearts, concentrating in himself, and exhibiting to the world, his country's triumphs, dignity, and justice.</P>
<P>THE seat of power is not, however, the only place, where we are to look for the traits, which form the glory of a prince, and constitute the truly great man. In every act of his life, we may see love for his country influencing his conduct; and eminent personal magnanimity. It is not power, that he covets. It is not for the sake of ruling, that he holds the civil reins. In whatever station he can most serve his country, whether as the leader of her hosts, as the guide of her councils, or, as a fixed luminary, in private life shedding the affecting lustre of unaspiring virtue, that station is his choice.—Is he in the field? The love of con∣quest does not inflame his breast. His procedure is not governed by an insatiate zeal for triumph. He is, indeed, courageous; and aims by skill and kindness to call forth all the prowess of his troops. But his only object is <HI>to defend his country's rights.</HI> So soon as her honor permits, his lan∣guage is that of the chief, whom the text bewails; "<HI>Shall the sword devour forever? Knowest thou not, that it will be
<PB N="11" REF="037308_0008_100CB02CC5C66C90"/>
bitterness in the latter end?</HI>"<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">II <HI>Samuel,</HI> ii, 26.</NOTE> Is he in the cabinet? No thirst for fame, no selfish ambition, no ignoble hopes, instigate his counsels. His country's character is his own. Her prosperity is his aggrandizement. His steady aim is to conduct her to greatness and felicity, by arts, frugality, order, and virtue, under the blest influences of peace. If he be raised to sovereign authority, no pomp of honors, nor pride of pre-eminence, can debase his patriot mind.—When he has established the empire of his wishes, seen it in good organization, and can safely resign the superintend∣ence of it to another, he appears most truly great, if <HI>a rare magnanimity</HI> prompt him to display the noblest act of public virtue, by relinquishing station, and power, and their flat∣tering concomitants <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> retire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> and exhibit, as a citizen, an obedience to the laws, which as a ruler, he enforced.</P>
<P>BUT public achievements and public honors will not finish the character of a prince and great man. There are private virtues, which, though of smaller lustre, are of divine nature. Without these no greatness is complete. Here is the defect of many of the he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es of antiquity. Here is the imperfection, which we must over regret, in many renowned characters.—They display grandeur of exploit, great prowess in arms, deep skill in legislation: but their noble virtues are alone. They want attendants. We see none of the humble, humane, domestic virtues; without which all glory is deficient. They possess strength of mind: but we have to deplore its rudeness. We find in them collectedness; but we look in vain for humanity by its side. They shew us integrity; but we are obliged to mark the want of courteous ease, to render it agreeable.—
<PB N="12" REF="037308_0009_100CAFFD0DEDAC80"/>
Intent only upon being public heroes, some of them, alas! have been private brutes. Without <HI>the amiable qualities of the heart,</HI> popular deeds purchase but a tinsel renown. He, who is great in worth, as well as name, endeavours to blend with the glories of a Chief, the virtues of a man. One aim regulates his life—to exalt human nature, while he serves his country. He is, therefore, studious of every excellence; and his private virtues soften the brightness of his public accomplishments into the most endearing loveliness.</P>
<P>To crown the glorious properties of the truly great character, RELIGION reigns in his bosom. A prince, or ruler, without religion, wants the best glory of humanity. He is destitute of that, which, <HI>as a principle,</HI> gives worth to every action; and, <HI>as an excellence,</HI> reflects a nobler lustre upon the most finished human greatness. The vir∣tuous prince, and real patriot, perceives in the sentiment, which leads him to GOD for guidance, the most useful truth he can exemplify to his country. For them, it is necessary to improvement and to happiness. In him, it dignifies, every applauded quality. Venerable, as of etherial nature, is the glory, with which <HI>the religious principle</HI> invests civil greatness; and now, that the Eternal FATHER "hath spoken to us by his SON," the CHRISTIAN GRACES, more than the themes of ancient fame, ennoble the Chief; and perfect the man.</P>
<P>WE have now seen the properties, which form a cha∣racter, princely indeed; and eminently great. Let us pause—and contemplate the exit of such a man from the world, with its circumstances, and effects.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="037308_0010_100CB02E4C21CA08"/>
IN itself, it is peaceful and glorious. Sweet is the review, which he takes of life. Soothing are the prospects, which he sees in death. But for his country's good, he would not wish to defer the hour of departure. He expects in it an <HI>honourable</HI> rest from his anxious cares for his coun∣try's safety and improvement. It promises him a freedom from that monstrous ingratitude, which (O shame to our nature!) not celestial perfection could escape. He knows, he shall leave a spotless same, which posterity will venerate. And A CROWN IS BEFORE HIM, IN A REALM OF ETER∣NAL PEACE. Resigned to the will of his GOD, he waits his messenger. Death cannot deprive him of his lustre. The Sun, which shone bright through the day, sets in mild splendor at eve; and, save THE BEAMS <HI>which pensive reflection holds,</HI> carries its greatness and its glories with it.</P>
<P>BUT, though the departure of such a character from the world is, in itself, peaceful and glorious, deep shades of gloom pervade the regio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, he leaves; and mournful darkness, fixed upon every object, he illumined, speaks bereavement.</P>
<P>IN the relatives and friends, whom he loved, and in the societies, with which he was associated, the death of the truly great man touches every tender nerve of sorrow.—The ties, with which nature, or appropriate affection, unites individuals with such a character, must be inexpressi∣bly strong and dear. The pride and pleasure, which we feel, in being any way related to such greatness, renders him the glory and delight of each fraternity, that enrols him among its fellows. Every object connected with him, the near persons of his houshold, the partners of his con∣fidence,
<PB N="14" REF="037308_0011_100CAFFE97FEE9F0"/>
and companions of his life, the societies, civil and religious, to which he belongs, all shine, <HI>distinguished,</HI> in the lustre of his name. What a loss then do they sustain, when he expires! How involuntarily do their faces gather anguish! They heave the sigh of regret—They seek the sympathy of grief—They wear the insignia of sorrow—But—alas! The heart of the relative is rent! The boast of the societies is gone!</P>
<P>TO A NATION the death of such a Prince and great man is one of the most solemn bereavements, it can sustain. In his country such a man is a centre of union, a source of light, and a reservoir of strength. In his country such a man is more treasure, than all its revenues: more glory than all its achievements. In his country such a man is heaven's gift—the best of national distinctions—a kind of guardian angel. His name is a host. His renown is at once the en∣vy, and the dread, of every foe. His inhabitance is dignity and defence. So long, as she retains him, his country FEELS HERSELF GREAT. How awful, then, the event, which ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s him from her. It is like the withdrawal of light, when a cloud passes over the earth, whose portentous gloom fills every one with dismay. His exit is felt by his country in every member; and mournful are her aspect, and thoughts. A solemn knell moans through the bereav∣ed land. Gaiety stops, to muse on the sad tidings. In∣dustry pauses, to wipe away a tear. The wise, with anxious sorrow, presage the consequences. And the matron, with pious patriotism, tells her little ones, <HI>who is dead.</HI> The sor∣rowing fathers of the land assemble. Upon one object they are all intent—how they may best honor the departed hero. While thus they seek to sooth the public grief, even calum∣ny
<PB N="15" REF="037308_0012_100CB02FD2C0A8C0"/>
ceases from her rudeness; husht by the solemnity of ge∣neral mourning. Religion, sympathising, sanctifies the af∣fliction. The nation pays its funeral tributes to the worthy. And long, long, is his country mindful of her loss. Long, very long, is she sad, that her "prince and her great man <HI>is fallen.</HI>"</P>
<P>FINALLY, when such a character dies, THE WORLD is affected—the whole family of man mourns. Such great and good men ennoble human nature. In all countries their names are honoured; and their virtues revered. Man, wherever he is, will admire such conspicuous and uncom∣mon worth. He sees a dignity, imparted by it to his species, which produces in his bosom a glow of noble emotions.—Congenial greatness discovers in it a majesty, <HI>bestowed on</HI> eminent stations; not <HI>borrowed from</HI> them; and is excited to an imitation of its peculiar excellencies. The blow, therefore, which takes the virtuous chief and truly great man from earth, is felt by the world. The regret, it occasions, is not confined to place; but is as extensive, as human in∣terests, and the bosoms of men. Man respects greatness: and his self-love, as well as philanthrophy, causes him to mourn, when the luminaries of his race expire.</P>
<P>SUCH are the properties, which shed glory on a prince▪ and form the truly great man. And such his exit from this terrestial scene, its circumstances, and its effects.</P>
<P>HAVE not your hearts, my friends, discerned at every step the lineaments of <HI>WASHINGTON?</HI>—Have you not anticipated the remark, that <HI>all the solid glory</HI> of a prince, and <HI>every property</HI> of the truly great man, existed in that
<PB N="16" REF="037308_0013_100CB000B7E70900"/>
finished character?—I avoided making the application, as we passed; lest your admiration of such illustrious greatness might be damped, by the chilling emotions, which come over the mind at every mention of his name. But it was vain. His virtues were too dear to you not to have been instantly recognized. Your listening griefs quick felt, and told, that in the qualities and exit of eminent greatness I described your departed hero. Yes—what was said, was in all parts applicable to him—I see him in the field, in the council, in the temple, in his dignified retirement, and at death, displaying every virtue, which can adorn the soldier, the statesman, the citizen, and the christian. But, while we triumph in the thought, that it was reserved for our country, at this late age of the world, to produce THE MAN, who should exhibit in his character AN ASSEMBLAGE OF ALL HUMAN EXCELLENCIES, the blood retreats cold to the heart, and the spirits faulter, at the recollection, that now—<HI>he is no more!</HI> No more shall our country console herself under every prospect, that she has in one man enough to render her more eminent, than the nations of the earth—No more "shall his name prove a rampart, and the know∣ledge that he exists a bulwark, against the secret and open enemies of his country's peace."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>PRESIDENT ADAMS's speech at his first inauguration to the pre∣sidency of the United States.</HI></NOTE>—No more shall all earthly powers fear and respect our land, because HE dwells here; and court our alliance to be related to him—No more shall the old and the young feel a pride in being his cotempora∣ries; and point to beams, retained by THE PATRIOT MOUNT,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mount Vernon in Virginia,</HI>—<HI>the residence of Washington.</HI></NOTE> when the glory of their country is low—He is gone from our admiration!

him home. The noble chief is buried from our sight—And <HI>the memory of the just is blessed.</HI></P>
<P>SOLEMN to annual regret be the day, on which he ex∣pired. Sacred be the reflection, which marks in his exit the transitoriness of all human greatness. Humble, and entire, be our resignation to the will of the all-wise Disposer of events.—Let us honor the memory of the departed great man in the way, which he would approve. This is by imitating his virtues; and by using his example to animate the sons of our land in the path, which he pursued.—Yes, thou Illustrious spirit, each parent in the empire, thou didst found, shall teach his babes, and bid them in future times teach theirs, that they are descended from a noble civil Fa∣ther, who loved the glory of his country; and, while he sought it in heroic deeds, forgat not the excellence of vir∣tue nor the holiness of religion.—Ye fathers, who hear me, ye confirm this declaration—Ye American mothers, I but speak your intentions. If the souls of the departed have cognizance of things below the skies, the glorified Chief shall enjoy a reward of his labor for his country's welfare, in beholding his work and virtues continued, to her praise, by the imitating gratitude of far distant descendants. Thus shall his NAME be useful to his country for ages to come.—Thus may each individual sanctify the sorrows of his land. Thus may successive generations sooth the wound, which cannot be healed:—'till grief shall be lost in <HI>that sublime veneration,</HI> which History will exact of posterity, FOR THE MEMORIES OF THE GREAT AND THE GOOD, till the globe, they ennobled, is wrapt in ruin.</P>

<HEAD>A PRAYER WHICH PRECEDED THE DISCOURSE.</HEAD>
<P>ALMIGHTY and immortal God, whose days are without end, and whose judgments are irre∣proachable, look down from heaven, we humbly beseech thee, upon a mourning land, and behold the sorrows of the people, whom thou hast afflicted. In thy wisdom thou hast seen fit to take from our Country the man, whom thou didst give for her glory and defence. The excellent of her counsellors is fallen; and the valiant of her hosts is no more. Verily for this our hearts are pained; and our an∣guish, O God, is exceedingly great. What shall we say? Where shall we go? How shall we humble ourselves under thy heavy hand? Thou art teaching us, that <HI>we may not put our trust in princes, nor in the best of the sons of men, for their breath goeth forth of their nostrils, and then all their thoughts perish.</HI> Thou art teaching us, that the good and the great, <HI>though they be called gods, must die like men;</HI> and making us feel, how fallacious are the hopes of man. We do to day call to our remembrance a chief, dear to his country as her best possession, a noble, distinguished above the rulers of the earth, now laid in the dust by thy awful providence, and vanished like a blissful vision of the night. While we bend and weep under thy irreversible decree, suffer us to deprecate the consequences, which anticipation fears from this event. <HI>When it is told in Gath, let not the Philistines rejoice. When it is published in the streets of As∣kelon, let not the children of the uncircumcised triumph.</HI>—In our councils let thy Spirit be instead of him, whom thou
<PB REF="037308_0016_100CB032E95A6918"/>
hast taken away. And, when thou bringest the terror of battle upon our land, <HI>wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts?</HI> We submit to thy will; commending our country unto thee, and all her Interests. Thou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our hearts, shut not thy merciful ears to our pray∣ers. <HI>Shew her servants thy work, and their children thy glo∣ry: and the glorious majesty of the Lord our God be upon</HI> her: <HI>prosper thou the work of</HI> their <HI>hands upon</HI> her; <HI>O prosper thou</HI> their <HI>handy work.</HI> And now, O God, we beseech thee to look down upon us, thy unworthy servants, and assist us in the work and service, in which we are engaged. Grant, that in our homage to our departed hero, no improper sor∣rows may disgrace us as christians; but in all our works, begun, continued, and ended, in thee, may we glorify thy holy name; and finally, by thy mercy obtain everlasting life, through Jesus Christ, our Lord, who taught and com∣mended us, when we pray to say,</P>
<P><HI>Our Father, who art in heaven,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
