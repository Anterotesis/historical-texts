<HEAD>THE SPEECH of his Excellency JOHN RUTLEDGE, ESQUIRE, Governor and Commander in Chief of the State of SOUTH-CAROLINA, to the GENERAL ASSEMBLY, met at Jackson∣burgh, on Friday the 16th Day of January, 1782.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honorable Gentlemen of the Senate, Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE the last meeting of a General Assembly, the good People of this State have not only felt the common Calamities of War, but, from the wanton and savage Manner in which it has been prosecuted, they have experienced such Severities as are unpractised, and will scarcely be credited by civilized Nations.</P>
<P>THE Enemy, unable to make any impression on the Northern States, the Number of whose Inhabitants, and the strength of whose Country, had baffled their repeated Efforts, turned their Views to∣wards the Southern, which, a difference of Circumstances afforded some Expectation of conquering, or at least of greatly distressing.— After a long Resistance, the Reduction of Charles Town was effected, by the vast superiority of Force with which it had been besieged.— The loss of that Garrison, as it consisted of the Continental Troops of Virginia and the Carolinas, and of a number of Militia, facilitated the Enemy's march into the Country, and their Establishment of strong Posts, in the upper and interior Parts of it; And, the unfavou∣rable Issue of the Action near Camden, induced them vainly to ima∣gine, that no other Army could be collected, which they might not easily defeat.—The Militia, commanded by the Brigadiers Sumpter and Masion, whose enterprising Spirit and unremitted Perseverance under many difficulties, are deserving of great Applause, harrassed and often defeated large Parties, but, the Numbers of those Militia were too few to contend effectually with the collected Strength of the Enemy—Regardless therefore of the sacred <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Honor, destitute
<PB N="2" REF="044266_0002_101DE275E7A28BA0" MS="y"/>
of the Feelings of Humanity, and determined to extinguish, if pos∣sible, every Spark of Freedom in this Country, They, with the insolent Pride of Conquerors, gave unbounded scope to the Exercise of their Tyrannical disposition, infringed their public Engagements, and vio∣lated the most solemn Capitulations—many of our worthiest Citizens, were, without cause, long, and closely confined—some on Board of Prison Ships, and others in the Town and Castle of St. Augustine —their Properties disposed of, at the Will and Caprice of the Ene∣my, and their Families sent to a different and distant Part of the Con∣tinent, without the Means of Support—many who had surrendered as Prisoners of War were killed in cold Blood, several suffered Death in the most ignominious Manner, and others were delivered up to Savages, and put to Tortures, under which they expired—Thus, the Lives, Liberties and Properties of the People were dependent, solely, on the pleasure of British Officers, who deprived them of Either or all, on the most frivolous Pretences—Indians, Slaves and a despe∣rate Banditti of the most profligate Characters, were caressed and employed by the Enemy to execute their infamous Purposes—De∣vastation and Ruin marked their Progress, and that of their Adhe∣rents, nor were their Violences restrained by the Charms or Influence of Beauty and Innocence—Even the fair Sex, whom it is the duty of all, and the pleasure and pride of the Brave, to protect,—they, and their tender Offspring, were Victims to the inveterate Malice of an unrelenting Foe—neither the Tears of Mothers, nor the Cries of In∣fants, could excite, in their Breasts, Pity or Compassion—not only the peaceful Habitations of the Widow, the aged, and the infirm, but, the holy Temples of the most High were consumed, in Flames, kindled by their sacrilegious Hands—They have tarnished the Glory of the British Arms, disgraced the Profession of a British Soldier, and
<PB N="3" REF="044266_0003_101DE277722D98A8"/>
fixed indelible Stigmas of Rapine, Cruelty, Perfidy, and Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>∣ness, on the British Name.—But I can now congratulate you, and I do so most cordially, on the pleasing Change of Affairs, which, under the Blessing of GOD, the Wisdom Prudence Address and Bravery of the great and gallant General GREENE, and the Intre∣pidity of the Officers and Men under his Command, have happily effected—a General who is justly intitled, from his many signal Ser∣vices, to honorable and singular Marks of your Approbation and Gratitude—His Successes have been more rapid and compleat, than the most sanguine could have expected—The Enemy, compelled to surrender or evacuate every Post which they held in the Country, fre∣quently defeated, and driven from Place to Place, are obliged to seek Refuge under the Walls of Charles Town, and on Islands in its Vici∣nity— We have now the full and absolute Possession of every other part of the State, and the Legislative, Executive and Judicial Pow∣ers are in the free Exercise of their respective Authorities.</P>
<P>I also most heartily congratulate you, on the glorious Victory ob∣tained by the combined Forces of America and France, over their common Enemy— when the very General, who was second in Com∣mand at the Reduction of Charles Town, and to whose boasted Prowess, and highly extolled Abilities, the Conquest of no less than three States had been arrogantly committed, was speedily compelled, to accept of the same mortifying Terms, which had been imposed on that brave but unfortunate Garrison; to surrender an Army of many thousand Regulars, and to abandon his wretched followers, whom he had artfully seduced from their Allegiance, by specious Promises of Protection, which he could never have hoped to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the Justice or Mercy of their Country—on the naval Superiority established by the illustrious Ally of the United States—a Superiority
<PB N="4" REF="044266_0004_101DE27A5CB1E6C8"/>
in itself so decided, and in its Consequences so extensive, as must ine∣vitably soon oblige the Enemy to yield, to Us, the only Post which they occupy in this State—on the reiterated Proofs of the sincerest Friendship, and on the great Support, which America has received from that powerful Monarch—a Monarch whose Magnanimity is universally acknowledged and admired, and, on whose Royal Word, We may confidently rely, for every necessary Assistance—on the perfect Harmony which subsists between France and America—on the Stability which her Independence has acquired, and, on the Certainty that it is too deeply rooted, ever to be shaken—for, ani∣mated as they are, by National Honor, and united by one common Interest, it must and will be maintained.</P>
<P>WHAT may be the immediate Effects, on the British Nation, of the Events which I have mentioned, of their Loss of Territory in other parts of the World, and, of their well sounded Apprehensions from the powers of France, Spain and Holland, it is impossible to foretell—If Experience can teach Wisdom, to a haughty and infa∣tuated People, and, if they will now be governed by Reason, they will have learnt, that they can have no solid Ground of Hope, to conquer any State in the Union, for, tho' their Armies have obtained temporary Advantages over our Troops, yet the Citizens of these States, firmly resolved, as they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> return to a Domination which, near six Years ago, they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and justly renounced, cannot be subdued—and, They must now be convinced, that it is the Height of Folly and Madness to persist in so ruinous a War—If, however, We judge, as We ought, of their future by their past Con∣duct, We may presume, that they will, not only endeavour to keep possession of our Capital, but make another Attempt, howsoever im∣probable
<PB N="5" REF="044266_0005_101DE27CF4A85CA8"/>
the Success of it may appear, to subjugate this Country— It is therefore highly incumbent on Us, to use our most strenuous Efforts, to frustrate so fatal a Design, And, I earnestly conjure you, by the Duty which you owe, and the sacred Love which you bear, to your Country, by the constant Remembrance of her bitter Suffer∣ings, and by the just Detestation of British Government, which you and your Posterity, must for Ever, possess, to exert your utmost Fa∣culties, for that purpose, by raising and equipping, with all possible Expedition, a respectable permanent Force, and by making ample Provision for their comfortable Subsistence—I am sensible the Ex∣pence will be great, but, a Measure so indispensable to the preserva∣tion of our Freedom, is above every pecuniary Consideration.</P>
<P>THE Organization of our Militia is likewise a Subject of infinite Importance—a clear and concise Law, by which the Burdens of Ser∣vice will be equally sustained, and a competent Number of Men brought forth, and kept in the Field, when their Assistance may be required, is essential to our Security, and therefore, justly claims your immediate and serious Attention—Certain it is, that some of our Militia have, upon several Occasions, exhibited Instances of Valour which would have reflected Honor on veteran Troops—The Cou∣rage and Conduct of the Generals whom I have mentioned, the cool and determined Bravery repeatedly displayed by Brigadier Pickens, and, indeed, the Behaviour of many Officers and Men in every Bri∣gade, are unquestionable Testimonies of the Truth of this Assertion —But, such Behaviour cannot be expected from Militia in General, without good order and strict discipline, nor can that order and dis∣cipline be established, but by a salutary Law, steadily executed.</P>
<P>ANOTHER important Matter for your Deliberation, is the Con∣duct of such of our Citizens as voluntarily avowing their Allegiance,
<PB N="6" REF="044266_0006_101DE2816C2335A8"/>
and even glorying in their prosessions of Loyalty and Attachment to his Britannick Majesty, have offered their Congratulations on the Success of his Arms, prayed to be embodied as Royal Militia, ac∣cepted Commissions in his Service, or, endeavoured to subvert our Constitution, and establish his power, in its stead, of those who have returned to this State, in Defiance of a Law by which such return was declared to be a Capital Offence, and have abetted the British Interest; and of such, whose Behaviour has been so reprehensible, that Justice and Policy forbid their free Re-admission to the Rights and Privileges of Citizens.</P>
<P>THE extraordinary Lenity of this State, has been remarkably con∣spicuous—other States have thought it just and expedient to appro∣priate the Property of British Subjects to the public Use, But, We have forborne to take even the Profits of the Estates of our most im∣placable Enemies—It is with you to determine, whether the For∣feiture and Appropriation of their Property should now take Place —If such shall be your Determination, tho', many of our firmest Friends have been reduced, for their inflexible Attachment to the Cause of their Country, from Opulence to inconceivable Distress, and, if the Enemy's Will and Power had prevailed, would have been doomed to Indigence and Beggary, yet it will redound to the Repu∣tation of this State, to provide a becoming Support, for the Families of those whom you may deprive of their Property.</P>
<P>THE Value of Paper Currency became, of late, so much depreci∣ated, that it was requisite, under the Powers vested in the Executive during the Recess of the General Assembly, to suspend the Laws by which it was made a Tender—You will now consider whether it may not be proper to repeal those Laws, and fix some equitable Mode, for the discharge of Debts, contracted whilst Paper Money was in Circulation.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="044266_0007_101DE2830C7E49B8"/>IN the present Scarcity of Specie, it would be difficult, if not im∣practicable, to levy a Tax, to any considerable Amount, towards sinking the public Debt, nor will the Creditors of the State expect that such a Tax should, at this Time, be imposed; But, it is just and reasonable, that all unsettled Demands should be liquidated, and satisfactory Assurances of Payment given, to the public Creditors.</P>
<P>THE Interest and Honor, the Safety and Happiness of our Coun∣try depend, so much, on the Result of your Deliberations, that I flatter myself you will proceed, in the weighty Business before you, with Firmness and Temper, with Vigour, Unanimity and Dispatch.</P>

<HEAD>THE ADDRESS of the Honorable the SENATE, in Answer to the Governor's SPEECH.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please your Excellency,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE beg leave to return your Excellency the thanks of this House, for your Speech.</P>
<P>ANY words that we might adopt, would convey but a very faint Idea of the Satisfaction we feel, on the perfect Re-establishment of the Legislative, Executive and Judicial Powers in this State.</P>
<P>IT is with particular Pleasure, that we take the earliest Opportu∣nity to present to your Excellency our unfeigned Thanks, for your unwearied zeal and attention to the real Interest of this Country, and to testify our entire approbation of the good Conduct of the Execu∣tive, since the last meeting of the General Assembly.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="044266_0008_101DE285A8C8FE88"/>WE see and revere the goodness of Divine Providence, in frustrat∣ing and disappointing the attempts of our Enemies, to conquer the Southern States, and we trust, that by the blessing of the same Provi∣dence, on the Valour and Intrepidity of the Free Citizens of America, their attacks and enterprizes will continue to be repelled and defeated.</P>
<P>WE reflect with pleasure on the steady Resolution with which Charles Town was defended, by a small body of brave Men, against such a vast superiority of Force, and we gratefully acknowledge the meritorious Conduct, and important Services of the Officers and Privates of the Militia, who stood sorth in the hour of Danger, and whose coolness, perseverance and ardour under a complication of Difficulties, most justly entitle them to the applause of their Country.</P>
<P>WE flatter ourselves, that the Blood which the Enemy has in∣humanly spilt, the wanton Devastation which has marked their progress, and the tyrannical System that they have invariably pursu∣ed, and which your Excellency hath so justly and pathetically de∣scribed to us, will rouse the good People of this State, and will animate them with a Spirit to protect their Country, to save their Rights and Liberties, and to maintain, at all hazards, their Independency.</P>
<P>IT is with inexpressible Pleasure, that we receive your Excellency's Congratulations upon the great and glorious Events of the Cam∣paign, on the happy change of Affairs, and on the pleasing Prospect before us; And, We assure your Excellency, that we concur most sincerely with you, in acknowledging and applauding the meritori∣ous Zeal, and the very important Services which have been rendered to this State, by the great and galiant General GREENE, and the brave and intrepid Officers and Men under his Command, and to whom we shall be happy to give the most honorable and singular
<PB N="9" REF="044266_0009_101DE28A4B6A8028"/>
Testimonies of our approbation and applause.</P>
<P>WE are truly sensible of the immense Advantage, which the United States derive from the magnanimous Prince their Ally: We have the most perfect Confidence on his Royal Word, and on the sincerity of his Friendship, and, We think ourselves much indebted to that illustrious Monarch, for the great and effectual Assistance, which he hath been pleased to give the Confederated States, and by whose means they have been enabled to humble the Pride of Britain, and to establish their Independency upon the most per∣manent Basis.</P>
<P>THE Importance of the several Matters which your Excellency hath recommended to our Consideration, is so evident, that we shall proceed to deliberate upon them, with all possible Dispatch, and we flatter ourselves, that our Business will be carried on with Tem∣per, Firmness and Unanimity.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Honorable Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I sincerely thank you for this Address—The Approbation which you are pleased to declare of my Conduct affords me much Satisfac∣tion— Bound by the strongest Ties, and the deepest Gratitude, to promote the Happiness of this Country, I have only to regret that my Endeavours for that purpose have not, as yet, produced all the good Effects which I anxiously strove to obtain—Your Sentiments of public Affairs are so perfectly just, that I foresee the happiest Conse∣quences must result from the disposition which you profess.</P>

<HEAD>THE ADDRESS of the HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES in Answer to the Governor's SPEECH.</HEAD>
<P>WE the House of Representatives of the State of South-Carolina, in General Assembly met, return your Excellency our most cordial Thanks, for your very interesting Speech to both Houses, at the opening of this Session, the Language of which, evidently bespeaks a Heart glowing with ardent Zeal for the Interest and Welfare of our common Country.</P>
<P>WE want Words to express our heart-felt Exuitation, on the pleasing reverse in our Affairs: On this Spot, but a few Months past, a military Despotism prevailed, and Tyranny, with lawless Vio∣lence, was desolating our fair Possessions; But, We now, with extacy, behold, a free Government re-established, Liberty, that greatest of temporal Blessings, restored, and every Citizen secured in the possession of his Property by the firm barrier of the Law of his Country—This auspicious Change, is in a great degree owing to the Prudence, Firmness and good Conduct of your Excellency.</P>
<P>IF any thing can add to the sublime and refined Enjoyment, which must arise from your Excellency's own reflections on your persever∣ing, unabated and successful Exertions towards rescuing your Coun∣try from the Iron Hand of Oppression, be pleased, Sir, to accept the most sincere and unfeigned Thanks of your grateful fellow-Citizens.</P>
<P>THE black Catalogue which your Excellency has given of Bri∣tish Barbarities, forms but a small part of the Whole—When ever the historic Page shall be stained with their Story, it will exhibit a Nation devoid of Faith, with whom Oaths, Treaties and the most solemn Compacts were considered as trifles, who, without Scruple or Remorse, had abandoned all regard to Humanity, Honor, Justice and every ennobling Sentiment of the human Breast. It is hardly
<PB N="11" REF="044266_0011_101DE29358E1DB98"/>
possible to conceive any circumstance that could aggravate the atro∣cious Wickedness of their Conduct. There is not left a Step in the degradation of National Character, to which they can <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> descend. The Name of a Briton must henceforward, be a term of Reproach among all Nations.</P>
<P>WE should betray a great degree of Insensibility, and be want∣ing in Justice to his Merit, should we omit this occasion of acknow∣ledging, with the warmest Gratitude, our Obligations to the great and gallant General GREENE: His Atchievements in this State, while they rank him with the greatest Commanders of ancient or modern Date, will engrave his Name in indelible Characters on the Heart of every Friend to this Country. Our Acknowledgments are also due to all the brave Officers and Men, under his command, who have so often Fought, Bled and Conquered for us. The Generals Sumpter, Marion and Pickens, with the brave Militia, under their commands, those virtuous Citizens who did not despair of the Com∣monwealth in her greatest Extremity, are deserving of the highest Commendation. The friendly, seasonable and effectual Aid, re∣cently afforded us, by our great and illustrious Ally, by means of which, the General, on whom the British nation seemed most to have placed their dependence, has been compelled to surrender the Flower of the British Army, to our immortal Commander in Chief, must greatly encrease the flame of Gratitude, which had been before kindled in the Breast of every American, and which it will not be in the power of Time or Accident to extinguish. We perfectly concur in Sentiment with your Excellency, that from our Connec∣tion with this powerful and wise Monarch, we may expect, with well grounded Confidence, that our Independence will be shortly established upon an immovable Basis, nor need we harbour a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Fear of its dissolution.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="044266_0012_101DE2966C6E63C0" MS="y"/>AN Union which originated from such liberal and generous Mo∣tives, and which is founded on mutual Interest, that best cement of Nations, must and will continue—Whether the series of Losses, Disasters and Defeats of the Year past, will at length recover Britain from her Delirium, time only can disclose: But as Misfortune hitherto, instead of producing Reflection and Prudence, has operat∣ed to encrease her insanity, we agree in opinion with your Excel∣lency, that it is probable she will not only endeavour to keep pos∣session of our Capital, but make another attempt to subjugate the Country; We shall therefore immediately enter upon the prosecu∣tion of the Measures recommended by your Excellency, as necessary for its Safety. And being fully sensible how much depends upon the result of our Deliberations we will endeavour to proceed in the weighty Business with Firmness and Temper, with Vigour, Unani∣mity and Dispatch.</P>
