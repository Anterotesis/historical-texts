<P>Sec. 2. <HI>And be it further enacted,</HI> That the judge of the district court of the United States, for the dis∣trict where the debtor resides, or usually resided at the time of committing the act of bankruptcy, upon petition, in writing, against such person or persons being bankrupt, to him to be exhibited by any one creditor, or by a greater number, being partners, whose single debt shall amount to one thousand dollars, or by two creditors, whose debts shall amount to one thousand five hundred dollars, or by more than two creditors, whose debts shall amount to two thousand dollars, shall have power, by commission under his hand and seal, to appoint such good and substantial persons, being citizens of the United States, and res∣ident in such district, as such judge shall deem pro∣per, not exceeding three, to be commissioners of the said bankrupt, and in case of vacancy or refusal to act, to appoint others, from time to time, as occasi∣on

And if such debt shall not be really due, or after such commission taken out, it cannot be prov∣ed that the party was a bankrupt, then the said judge shall, upon the petition of the party aggrieved, in case there be occasion, deliver such bond to the said party, who may sue thereon and recover such dam∣ages, under the penalty of the same, as, upon trial at law, he shall make appear he has sustained, by rea∣son of any breach of the condition thereof.</P>
