<HEAD>To the Public.</HEAD>
<P>THE high approbation our Poetess has received from the Monthly Reviewers, may with propriety be introduced whenever her works, or part of them, are re-published. A few of their observations are— <Q>Of the Dramas we cannot express our approbation more strongly than by ob∣serving, that they are admirably calculated for the end they are designed to answer—<HI>the instruction and amuse∣ment</HI> of youth; being equally adapted to inform the un∣derstanding, and to improve the heart.</Q></P>
<P>The Poem <HI>Sensibility</HI> has so much engaged their attenti∣on, that near four pages are filled up in laying several parts thereof before their readers, and in pointing out its beauties. They say— <Q>In a book 'chiefly intended for young persons,' it is not with impropriety that Miss More has introduced the concluding composition <HI>'Sensibility;'</HI> there being no∣thing of which they are more apt to form mistaken ideas than that of sympathetic tenderness, which is supposed to have its source in the amiable affections of the heart. From these mistaken ideas it is that so many, by giving way to the immoderate indulgence of sensibility, destroy their own peace; while a still greater number, by its affectation, ren∣der themselves disgusting.</Q> Monthly Review, for July <HI>1782.</HI></P>
<P>If this Publication meets with encouragement, others of a like kind will be laid before the Public.</P>

<L>Nor blame too much the verse you cannot praise.</L>
<L>For you far other Bards have wak'd the string;</L>
<L>Far other bards for you were wont to sing.</L>
<L>Yet on the gale their parting music steals,</L>
<L>Yet, your charm'd ear the lov'd impression feels.</L>
<L>You heard the lyres of <HI>Lyttleton</HI> and <HI>Young</HI>;</L>
<L>And this a Grace, and that a Seraph strung.</L>
<L>These are no more!—But not with these decline</L>
<L>The Attic chasteness, and the flame divine.</L>

<L>Yes:—still for you your gentle stars dispense</L>

<L>Whose song is music, and whose canvass lives.</L>
<L><HI>Delany</HI> shines, in worth serenely bright,</L>
<L>Wisdom's strong ray, and Virtue's milder light;</L>
<L>And she who bless'd the friend, and grac'd the page</L>
<L>Of <HI>Swift,</HI> still lends her lustre to our age:</L>
<L>Long, long protract thy light, O star benign!</L>
<L>Whose setting beams with added brightness shine!</L>

<L>O, much lov'd <HI>Barbauld</HI>! shall my heart refuse</L>
<L>Its tribute to thy Virtues and thy Muse?</L>
<L>While round thy brow the Poet's wreathe I twine,</L>
<L>This humble merit shall at least be mine,</L>
<L>In all thy praise to take a gen'rous part;</L>
<L>Thy laurels bind thee closer to my heart:</L>
<L>My verse thy merits to the world shall teach,</L>
<L>And love the genius it despairs to reach.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet, what is wit, and what the Poet's art?</L>
<L>Can Genius shield the vulnerable heart?</L>
<L>Ah, no! where bright imagination reigns,</L>
<L>The fine-wrought spirit feels acuter pains:</L>
<L>Where glow exalted sense, and taste refin'd,</L>
<L>There keener anguish rankles in the mind:</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="044729_0006_101EF6C09905CEB8"/>There feeling is diffus'd thro' ev'ry part,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Say, can the boasted pow'rs of wit and song,</L>
<L>Of life one pang remove, one hour prolong?</L>
<L>Presumptuous hope! which daily truth deride;</L>

<L><HI>Garrick</HI>! those pow'rs which form a friend were thine;</L>
<L>And let me add, with pride, that friend was mine:</L>
<L>With pride! at once the vain emotion's fled;</L>
<L>Far other thoughts are sacred to the dead.</L>

<L>Who now with spirit keen, yet judgment cool,</L>

<L>If harsher critics were compell'd to blame,</L>
<L>I gain'd in friendship what I lost in fame;</L>
<L>And friendship's fost'ring smiles can well repay</L>
<L>What critic rigour justly takes away.</L>
<L>With keen acumen how his piercing eye</L>
<L>The fault, conceal'd from vulgar view, wou'd spy!</L>
<L>While with a gen'rous warmth he strove to hide,</L>
<L>Nay vindicate the fault his judgment spied.</L>

<L>His praises flatter'd me, but not misled.</L>

<L>Agreed in this, opposing statesmen strove</L>

<L>You best can pardon, who have oft'nest felt.</L>
<L>You, who for many a friend and hero mourn,</L>

<L>Where parts superior dignify the mind;</L>
<L>Wou'd you renounce the pangs these feelings give,</L>

<L>For tho' in souls, where taste and sense abound,</L>
<L>Pain thro' a thousand avenues can wound;</L>
<L>Yet the same avenues are open still,</L>

<L>Nor is the trembling temper more awake</L>
<L>To every wound which misery can make,</L>
<L>Than is the finely-fashion'd nerve alive</L>

<L>For if, when home-felt joys the mind elate,</L>

<L>Beyond all flatt'ry, and all price above;</L>
<L>The mild forbearance at another's fault,</L>
<L>The taunting word suppress'd as soon as thought;</L>
<L>On these Heav'n bade the bliss of life depend,</L>
<L>And crush'd ill fortune when he made a <HI>Friend.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A Solitary blessing few can find,</L>
<L>Our joys with those we love are intertwin'd;</L>
<L>And he, whose helpful tenderness removes</L>
<L>Th' obstructing thorn which wounds the breast he loves,</L>
<L>Smooths not another's rugged path alone,</L>
<L>But scatters roses to adorn his own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The hint malevolent, the look oblique,</L>
<L>The obvious satire, or implied dislike;</L>
<L>The sneer equivocal, the harsh reply,</L>
<L>And all the cruel language of the eye;</L>
<L>The artful injury, whose venom'd dart,</L>
<L>Scarce wounds the hearing while it stabs the heart;</L>
<L>The guarded phrase whose meaning kills, yet told,</L>
<L>The list'ner wonders how you thought it cold;</L>
<L>Small slights, contempt, neglect unmix'd with hate,</L>
<L>Make up in number what they want in weight.</L>
<L>These, and a thousand griefs minute as these,</L>
<L>Corrode our comfort, and destroy our ease.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As this strong feeling tends to good or ill,</L>
<L>It gives fresh pow'r to vice or principle;</L>
<L>'Tis not peculiar to the wise and good;</L>
<L>'Tis passion's flame, the virtue of the blood.</L>
<L>Put to divert it to its proper course,</L>

<L><PB N="17" REF="044729_0015_101EF6DDD1692740"/>If, ill-directed, it pursues the wrong,</L>
<L>It adds new strength to what before was strong;</L>
<L>Breaks out in wild irregular desires,</L>

<L>This lovely feeling then adorns the whole;</L>
<L>Sheds its sweet sunshine on the moral part,</L>

<HEAD>REFLECTIONS OF KING HEZEKIAH IN HIS SICKNESS.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>Set thine house in order, for thou shalt die.</Q>
<BIBL>ISAIAH xxxviii.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<LG>
<L>WHAT, and no more?—Is this, my soul, said I,</L>
<L>My whole of being?—Must I surely die?</L>
<L>Be robb'd at once of health, of strength, of time,</L>
<L>Of youth's fair promise, and of pleasure's prime?</L>
<L>Shall I no more behold the face of morn,</L>
<L>The cheerful day-light, and the spring's return?</L>
<L>Must I the festive bow'r, the banquet leave,</L>
<L>For the dull chambers of the darksome grave?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Have I consider'd what it is to die?</L>
<L>In native dust with kindred worms to lie;</L>
<L>To sleep in cheerless cold neglect; to rot;</L>
<L>My body loath'd, my very name forgot!</L>
<L>Not one of all those parasites, who bend</L>
<L>The supple knee, their monarch to attend!</L>
<L>What, not one friend! No, not an hireling slave,</L>
<L>Shall hail <HI>Great</HI> HEZEKIAH in the grave!</L>
<L><PB N="20" REF="044729_0018_101EF6E66CC50B58"/>Where's he, who falsely claim'd the name of <HI>Great</HI>?</L>
<L>Whose eye was terror, and whose frown was fate;</L>
<L>Who aw'd an hundred nations from the throne?</L>
<L>See where he lies, dumb, friendless, and alone!</L>
<L>Which grain of dust proclaims the noble birth?</L>
<L>Which is the royal particle of earth?</L>
<L>Where are the marks, the princely ensigns where?</L>
<L>Which is the slave, and which great David's heir?</L>
<L>Alas! the beggar's ashes are not known</L>
<L>From his, who lately sat on Israel's throne!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How stands my great account? My soul, survey</L>
<L>The debt <HI>Eternal Justice</HI> bids thee pay!</L>
<L>Shou'd I frail Memory's records strive to blot,</L>
<L>Will Heav'n's tremendous reck'ning be forgot?</L>
<L>Can I, alas! the awful volume tear?</L>
<L>Or raze one page of the dread register?</L>
</LG>
<Q><L><HI>Prepare thy house, thy heart in order set;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Prepare, the Judge of Heav'n and Earth to meet.</HI></L></Q>
<LG>
<L>So spake the warning Prophet.—Awful words!</L>
<L>Which fearfully my troubled soul records.</L>
<L><HI>Am</HI> I prepar'd? and <HI>can</HI> I meet my doom,</L>
<L>Nor shudder at the dreaded wrath to come?</L>
<L><HI>Is</HI> all in order set, my house, my heart,</L>
<L>Does no besetting sin still claim a part?</L>
<L>Does no one cherish'd vice, with ling'ring pace,</L>
<L>Reluctant leave me to the work of grace?</L>
<L>Did I each day for this great day prepare,</L>
<L>By righteous deeds, by sin-subduing pray'r?</L>
<L>Did I each night, each day's offence repent,</L>
<L>And each unholy thought and word lament?</L>
<L>Still have these ready hands the afflicted fed,</L>
<L>And ministred to Want her daily bread?</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="044729_0019_101EF6E929369150"/>The cause I knew not, did I well explore?</L>
<L>Friend, advocate, and parent of the poor?</L>
<L>Did I, to gratify some sudden gust</L>
<L>Of thoughtless appetite; some impious lust</L>
<L>Of pleasure or of power, such sums employ</L>
<L>As would have crown'd pale penury with joy?</L>
<L>Did I in groves forbidden altars raise,</L>
<L>Or molten Gods adore, or idols praise?</L>
<L>Did my firm faith to Heav'n still point the way?</L>
<L>Did charity to man my actions sway?</L>
<L>Did meek-ey'd Patience all my steps attend?</L>
<L>Did gen'rous Candor mark me for her friend?</L>
<L>Did I unjustly seek to build my name</L>
<L>On the pil'd ruins of another's fame?</L>
<L>Did I, like hell, abhor th' insidious lie,</L>
<L>The low deceit, th' unmanly calumny?</L>
<L>Did my fix'd soul the impious wit detest?</L>
<L>Did my firm virtue scorn th' unhallow'd jest?</L>
<L>The sneer profane, and the poor ridicule</L>
<L>Of shallow Infidelity's dull school?</L>
<L>Did I still live as born one day to die,</L>
<L>And view th' eternal world with constant eye?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If so I liv'd, if so I kept thy word,</L>
<L>In mercy view, in mercy hear me, LORD!</L>
<L>My holiest deeds <HI>indulgence</HI> will require,</L>
<L>The best but to <HI>forgiveness</HI> will aspire;</L>
<L>If Thou my purest services regard,</L>
<L>'Twill be with pardon only, not reward!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How imperfection's stamp'd on all below!</L>
<L>How sin intrudes on all we say or do!</L>
<L>How late in all the insolence of health,</L>
<L>I charm'd th' Assyrian by my boast of wealth!</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="044729_0020_101EF6EAB948CF68"/>How fondly, with elab'rate pomp, display'd</L>
<L>My glitt'ring treasures! with what triumph laid</L>
<L>My gold and gems before his dazzled eyes,</L>
<L>And found a rich reward in his surprise <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is an anachronism. Hezekiah did not shew his treasures to the Assyrian 'till after his recovery from his sickness.</NOTE>!</L>
<L>O, mean of soul! can wealth elate the heart,</L>
<L>Which of the man himself is not a part?</L>
<L>O, poverty of pride! O, foul disgrace!</L>
<L>Disgusted reason, blushing, hides her face.</L>
<L>Mortal, and proud! strange contradicting terms?</L>
<L>Pride for Death's victim, for the prey of worms!</L>
<L>Of all the wonders which th' eventful life</L>
<L>Of man presents; of all the mental strife</L>
<L>Of warring passions; all the raging fires</L>
<L>Of furious appetites, and mad desires,</L>
<L>Not one so strange appears, as this alone,</L>
<L>That man is proud of what is not his own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How short is human life! the very breath,</L>
<L>Which frames my words, accelerates my death▪</L>
<L>Of this short life how large a portion's fled!</L>
<L>To what is gone I am already dead;</L>
<L>As dead to all my years and minutes past,</L>
<L>As I, to what remains shall be at last.</L>
<L>Can I my cares and pains so far forget,</L>
<L>To view my vanish'd years with fond regret?</L>
<L>Can I again my worn-out fancy cheat?</L>
<L>Indulge fresh hope? solicit new deceit?</L>
<L>Of all the vanities weak man admires,</L>
<L>Which greatness gives, or sanguine youth desires,</L>
<L><PB N="23" REF="044729_0021_101EF6F0AC809400"/>Of these, my soul, which hast thou not enjoy'd?</L>
<L>With each, with all, thy fated pow'rs are cloy'd.</L>
<L>What can I then expect from length of days?</L>
<L>More wealth, more wisdom, pleasure, health, or praise?</L>
<L>More pleasure! hope not that, deluded king!</L>
<L>For when did age increase of pleasure bring?</L>
<L>Is health of years prolong'd the common boast?</L>
<L>And dear-earn'd praise, is it not cheaply lost?</L>
<L>More wisdom! that indeed were happiness;</L>
<L>That were a wish a king might well confess:</L>
<L>But when did Wisdom covet length of days;</L>
<L>Or seek its bliss in pleasure, wealth, or praise?</L>
<L>No:—Wisdom views with an indiff'rent eye</L>
<L>All finite joys, all blessings born to die.</L>
<L>The soul on earth is an immortal guest,</L>
<L>Compell'd to starve at an unreal feast:</L>
<L>A spark, which upward tends by nature's force;</L>
<L>A stream, diverted from its parent source;</L>
<L>A drop, dissever'd from the boundless sea;</L>
<L>A moment, parted from eternity;</L>
<L>A pilgrim, panting for the rest to come;</L>
<L>An exile, anxious for his native home.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Why should I ask my forfeit life to save?</L>
<L>Is Heav'n unjust, which dooms me to the grave?</L>
<L>Was I with hope of endless days deceiv'd?</L>
<L>Or of lov'd life am I alone bereav'd?</L>
<L>Let all the great, the rich, the learn'd, the wise,</L>
<L>Let all the shades of Judah's monarchs rise;</L>
<L>And say, if genius, learning, empire, wealth,</L>
<L>Youth, beauty, virtue, strength, renown, or health,</L>
<L>Has once revers'd th' immutable decree</L>
<L>On Adam pass'd, of man's mortality?</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="044729_0022_101EF6F2306436D0"/>What—have these eyes ne'er seen the felon wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></L>
<L>The damask cheek devour, the finish'd form?</L>
<L>On the pale rose of blasted beauty fed,</L>
<L>And riot on the lip so lately red?</L>
<L>Where are our fathers? Where th' illustrious line</L>
<L>Of holy prophets and of men divine?</L>
<L>Live they for ever? Do they shun the grave?</L>
<L>Or when did wisdom its professor save?</L>
<L>When did the brave escape? When did the breath</L>
<L>Of Eloquence charm the dull ear of Death?</L>
<L>When did the cunning argument avail,</L>
<L>The polish'd period, or the varnish'd tale;</L>
<L>The eye of lightning, or the soul of fire,</L>
<L>Which thronging thousands crowded to admire?</L>
<L>Ev'n while we praise the verse, the poet dies;</L>
<L>And silent as his lyre great David lies.</L>
<L>Thou blest Isaiah! who, at God's command,</L>
<L>Now speak'st repentance to a guilty land,</L>
<L>Must die! as wise and good thou hadst not been;</L>
<L>As Nebat's son who taught the land to sin!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And shall <HI>I</HI> then be spar'd? O monstrous pride!</L>
<L>Shall I escape, when Solomon has died?</L>
<L>If all the worth of all the saints was vain—</L>
<L>Peace, peace, my troubled soul, nor dare complain!</L>
<L>LORD! I submit. Complete thy gracious will!</L>
<L>For if Thou slay me <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job.</NOTE>, I will trust Thee still.</L>
