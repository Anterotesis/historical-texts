<Q><BIBL><HI>2 SAMUEL, 1.27.</HI></BIBL>
<P>HOW ARE THE MIGHTY FALLEN, AND THE WEAPONS OF WAR PERISHED!</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE affecting vicissitudes of time are so many, and often so great, that to calculate their numbers, or estimate their consequences, is beyond the power of man. Of these, every hour is pregnant, and every moment brings forth, while day and night spread them from East to West, and the revolving seasons, from pole to pole. By the ceaseless progress of time, this world is continually passing; states and kingdoms are dissolved, and the vast arch of all earth∣ly empire finally falls.</P>
<P>Exposed to such fluctuations as these, how vain for <HI>man to trust in man,</HI> or to <HI>make flesh his arm!</HI> How inconsistent to look for durable enjoyments on the tossing wave of time! Coincident with these obser∣vations, are the mournful tidings that announce, as with the voice of dreadful thunder, that Washington is no more; a voice that strikes the Continent into
<PB N="4" REF="037999_0003_100FB06EE132CB68"/>
sadness how solemn! into silence how profound; and clothes millions in mourning.—
<Q><L>—"'Tis, as the gen'ral pulse</L>
<L>"Of life stood still, and nature made a pause;</L>
<L>"An awful pause! prophetic of her end.</L>
<L>"And let her prophecy be soon fulfill'd;</L>
<L>"Fate! drop the curtain; we can lose no more."</L>
<BIBL>YOUNG.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>From the heavy news of our Hero's death, noth∣ing can so rationally relieve, as a dependence on Him who made us; and to break our deep silence, no words can better aid our tongues, than, <HI>How is the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!</HI> The good, the great, the mighty Washington is fallen! Nor did he fall alone: A political Father in the cab∣inet; a Hero in the field of battle; the Deliverer of his country, and a Friend to man, fell and were en∣tombed in Washington. His name shall be dear to us, and to our children—it shall not, it cannot be forgotten in America. Under deep impressions of the debt of gratitude, we owe the memory of the common Father of our country, we meet together this day to indulge a reasonable grief, and drop a tear for him who is now no more. Contemplating the many blessings we enjoy, by the high instru∣mentality of his valuable life; and the unequalled qualifications with which he was endowed for that end, we cannot help joining the Royal Penman of Israel, in repeating, <HI>How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!</HI> Did David see a greatness in Saul and Jonathan? A greater than both is here.— Did he lament the loss of an Abner, as a General of high qualities, and a Prince fallen in Israel? We lament the death of a General of far greater worth. Saul was given to Israel in wrath; but Washington to America in mercy. Abner was cruel—and in an unjust cause; but Washington in the cause of virtue, of reason, and of his country, was merciful. Did
<PB N="5" REF="037999_0004_100FB07188DA6738"/>
David indulge a reasonable sympathy with the Thousands of Israel for the loss of their Leaders in arms?—<HI>How are the weapons of war perished!</HI> As if he had said; Who shall give strength to Israel in the day of battle? Who shall wield the weapons of war with such dexterity as Saul and Jonathan? With what superior propriety may we use the emphatical exclamations: How is the sword of America fallen! Where is the man whose presence can enliven and rally her armies of defence like Washington's?— Who with equal influence, can collect the forces of our different states into one?—Who with equal self-possession, magnanimity, and perseverance, could lead an undisciplined peasantry, without arms or ammu∣nition, against veteran troops, in scenes of action, through toils, through dangers, and through streams of blood; to victory, to triumph, to glory, and to peace? Who with superior wisdom, could guide the car of state, when riding high amidst the jarring el∣ements of contending nations, foreign influence, do∣mestic divisions, and insurrections?—When Thou∣sands of well-meaning Americans would have thrown themselves into the bosom of a disorderly, hungry, and insatiable nation, he wisely and faithfully saved us from that destruction. How, O how is the migh∣ty fallen!—Bewail ye soldiers the loss of your Gen∣eral —Bewail ye citizens the loss of your political Father. Ye Fathers and Mothers, ye Sons and Daughters of America, bewail the fall of such an em∣inent instrument for your defence.</P>
<Q><L>Sunt lacrymae rerum, et mentem mortalia tangunt. <BIBL><HI>Virg.</HI></BIBL></L>
<L>What mortal tidings pierce our hearts and ears!—</L>
<L>Tidings, extracting floods of public tears.</L></Q>
<P>But let not the tide of our grief swell to an im∣moderate degree. Though the Hero of America is no more, the God that made him lives as the defence of his people; and gave Washington a good old age,
<PB N="6" REF="037999_0005_100FB0742B0F02A0"/>
and made him useful to the last day of his life.— For my own part, though I bewail the death of Washington, as the fall of the most honored man on earth; it is a consolation, that he shall never be exposed to the contempt incident to the frailties of helpless old age.</P>
<P>Waving on examination of the characters to which our text refers, and fully convinced the words are highly applicable to our deceased General: I shall consider them as a proper subject, for illustrating, First, The character of a great man: And, Secondly, That great men must fall in death. After which I will conclude with some useful reflections. I am,</P>
<P>First, To illustrate the character of a truly great man.</P>
<P>We would observe, that a great man must be a virtuous man. All the greatness that any of the most enterprising characters ever possessed, without virtue, is tarnished with vice: And vice has a meanness, be∣low which no man can descend. The laurels of wicked men, however flourishing in the field of ac∣tion, mildew and die, under the blasting influence of vice, whether in public or private life.</P>
<P>What is the greatness of the Alexanders, the Pompeys, the Caesars, and other celebrated warriors of antiquity? What is the greatness of many mod∣ern Heroes? Where is their virtue? By what spirit are they animated? They are mere Catalines, and conspirators, in comparison to truly great men— They have sounding titles of honor—They are pro∣fanely still invincible—Conquerors of the world —Arbiters of peace and war—Defenders of their country, and the like—But in this, their names are transmitted to posterity under the influence of a false blaze.—Their true characters are disguised— Their secret designs are often base and mean, though covered with all the refinements of intrigue, of art, and of eloquence. Could we examine their conduct, and the motives by which such are, and have been inspired, we should find that unbounded ambition,
<PB N="7" REF="037999_0006_100FB076D6B7A0C8"/>
cruel domination, insolent pride and insatiable ava∣rice were the incentives of all their enterprises, and the mean and poisonous springs of all their glory. A glory like this would be infamy to Washington.</P>
<P>A truly great man is inspired with infinitely more noble motives: Motives flowing from a sense of moral excellence; founded on a firm belief of the su∣perintending Providence of God, and the reality of religion, as tending to meliorate the heart, ennoble and dignify human nature; and attended with an earnest desire to establish peace among mankind, as well as a reigning concern for the public good. At the call of God and his country, the great man buc∣kles on his armor, leaves his delightful retirement, and enters the field of battle. The enemies he op∣poses are pride, violence, injustice, perfidy and des∣potic sway. To these he opposes a humble depen∣dence on Divine Providence, in the exercise of be∣nevolence, justice and good government for man. With these, in the use of his weapons of war, he sights against his enemy without revenge, conquers without haughtiness, rejoices in triumph without insolence, and gives God the praise. And while his hands are red with the blood of his enemies, his bowels melt, for the misery of the victims of a just vengeance, and his heart reverences that God who commands in the day of such a sad necessity.</P>
<P>Numberless examples might be produced, from the experience of past ages, to shew, that virtue is necessary to the constitution of a great General. While the Roman Commanders, continued uncor∣rupted by vice, their empire, according to the signif∣icant expression of Daniel's prophecy, remained strong as iron. The purity of their manners was one great cause of the success of their arms; and the grandeur of their Commonwealth was the reward of their temperance, wisdom, and national justice. But how sadly the scene is changed, when the vices and follies of their conquered nations infected the hearts
<PB N="8" REF="037999_0007_100FB0785E8B36C0"/>
of their Generals! Their iron immediately mingled with clay, the foundation of their government was soon overthrown, their courage degenerated into cowardice, and their once renowned legions were put to flight by troops of undisciplined barbarians.</P>
<P>No one will deny that firmness and fortitude are necessary for the formation of a great character. But where shall we find them? The breast of the vi∣cious is too polluted a residence for such noble vir∣tues. "True fortitude is seen in great exploits, which justice warrants, and which wisdom guides; all else is towering frenzy and distraction." A vi∣cious Commander may be lavish of the lives of others, and foolishly throw away his own; but that can never give him any just claim to the appellation in our text. The practice of vice destroys the health of the body, and relaxes the vigor of the mind; fits the man for mean and mercenary actions, and tends to transform Heroes into effeminate cowards.</P>
<P>A truly great man subdues his own passions; is a∣dorned with meekness and generous compassion even to his enemies. Slavery is admitted on all sides to break the spirits of men, and equally unfits the human mind for the formation and execution of any great de∣signs. What greater slavery, than to be subject to the licentious desires of a vicious heart; and to the boister∣ous commands of unruly passions? Solomon, that great and wise Prince, observed, "He who is slow to an∣ger, is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit, than he that taketh a City." A polite writer observes; "A coward has fought; and a coward has conquered; but a coward never forgave." To the same purpose another observes, to a success∣ful warrior, who had shewn uncommon clemency to the vanquished; "Before, you had conquered all the world; but now you have more gloriously subdued yourself."</P>
<P>A really great character engages not in war, from hatred and revenge: To push a conquest to the grat∣ification
<PB N="9" REF="037999_0008_100FB07C5E28FA50"/>
of such mean and rancorous passions, is for∣eign from his mind; and it is a certain indication of the contrary character. Humanity and benevolence are essential ingredients of his heart: And such a General knows how to enlarge his glory, by setting bounds to his victories. Nor is he more ready to encounter a haughty foe in arms, than he is to do him good when by his valor he has subdued him to his mercy.</P>
<P>A clear head and a penetrating understanding, as well as a firm, virtuous, and courageous heart, are necessary to the constitution of a great character. Without these, the most virtuous and firm mind in high offices will be in danger of many errors. In∣numerable are those situations, both in the field and cabinet, in which there may be neither precept nor example to direct men's conduct. In such difficul∣ties, if the first men in a nation are destitute of re∣sources in their own minds, they may become an easy prey, with their country, to the devouring sword of an enemy, the intrigues of foreign nations, or the destroying influence of domestic factions, divisions, and "unreasonable discontent." Men without any singular talents may walk secure, in private life, and be useful to their fellowcitizens; and should they be even vicious, the injury may be principally to them∣selves: But when men without virtue and firmness, without wisdom and sagacity, are raised to command in the field, or to important seats in government; while the influence of their vice slides, with an easy descent, to the moral injury of the community; their errors in public conduct arising from pride and am∣bition on the one hand, or from ignorance and want of judgment on the other, are productive of incalcu∣lable calamities to their country. To this truth ma∣ny examples in history, both sacred and profane, at∣test. And to the confirmation of this truth; what a striking contrast there is, between our great and beloved Washington, and the mighty plunderers and
<PB N="10" REF="037999_0009_100FB080277EC378"/>
tyrants of Europe! If the latter have any safety for their guilty heads, from the just vengeance of their own injured country, it is in the arm and power of despotic sway; but the former had a security in the conscious rectitude of his conduct, and in the heart and affection of his country, which no length of time, nor change, can consign to oblivion. The wickedly great, and falsely splendorous tyrants of the earth, have their fears in life, and the curses of generations to come, in death; but our truly great Washing∣ton had our love in life—has our grateful remem∣brance in death; and generations to come shall rise up, and call him blessed.</P>
<P>To fill up a great character, knowledge of letters, of men and of the world is necessary. Innumerable are those occurrences in life, especially in eminent stations, in which ignorance or inexperience of these, betray either trepidation or rashness of mind, very inconsistent with illustrious characters. Men invest∣ed with high offices resemble a city <HI>set on a hill, which cannot be hid.</HI> Their elevated situation casts a light around them, that exhibits equally to public view, their ignorance and their knowledge; their imper∣fections and their worth.</P>
<P>To these I add, that a sense of religion is necessary to the formation of a truly great man. To honor men, as completely great, who are destitute of this high qualification, is certainly not judicious. The belief of the existence of a Deity; our moral obli∣gations to him; the immortality of the soul; the importance of its salvation by Jesus Christ, are so in∣dispensable to the man we are describing; that he who fails of this mental trait, fails of a really great mind, as much as time fails of being equal to eter∣nity. He that conceives himself, according to our new philosophists, as having done with life, when his breath is expired, must labor under a meanness of mind, that levels him with irrational animals, in point of duration. This blackest of French infidel∣ity,
<PB N="11" REF="037999_0010_100FB081ADE0C428"/>
destroys the best motives for action, and must at once unfit the mind for those noble achievements that the man of real religion is inspired to perform. He that circumscribes the consequences of his great actions within the narrow limits of a life that is but a hand breadth, or a span; must fall as far beneath those who act upon a theatre preparing for eternity, as this little opaque earth is inferior to the expand∣ed light of heaven.—There is no comparison. While the <HI>former</HI> as soon as he is born, is beginning to die (and an attempt to act as a Hero may effect his death, and eternally bury his triumphs in non∣existence;) the <HI>latter,</HI> in dying only begins to live
<Q><L>"The life of Gods, O transport! and of man."</L>
<BIBL><HI>Young.</HI></BIBL></Q>
And should his death take place even in the field of battle, it speedily translates him to join uninterrupt∣ed triumphs;
<Q><L>"Where momentary ages are no more!</L>
<L>"Where time, and pain, and chance, and death expire!</L>
<L>"Where Seraphs gather immortality,</L>
<L>"On life's fair tree, fast by the throne of God."</L>
<BIBL><HI>Young.</HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Of this last class of Heroes, we trust was our be∣loved Washington: And to this, his patronising re∣ligion, his discountenancing and reproving vice, his strict regard for the sabbath, his attention to public worship, with his respect for the ministers of relig∣ion, and his own purity of conduct, attest.</P>
<P>That Washington was not of the Heroes who confine their views to the limits of time only, and that he had a deep sense of the importance of mo∣rality and religion, is very evident from his own language, recorded in his affectionate farewell ad∣dress to the people of America; in which he has dis∣played, in the most masterly manner, "the dignity of his mind, and the unrivalled benevolence of his heart." Thus says this great man:</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="037999_0011_100FB0845A845098"/>"Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indis∣pensable supports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who should labor to sub∣vert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to respect, and cherish them. A volume could not trace all their connexions with public and private felicity. Let it be simply asked, where is the security for property, for reputation, for life, if a sense of religious obligation desert the oaths which are the instruments of investigation in courts of jus∣tice? —Reason and experience both forbid us to expect, that national morality can prevail, in exclu∣sion of religious principles."</P>
<P>We have another testimony of Washington's pie∣ty and regard for real religion, in the concluding passage of his Circular Address, at the time when he resigned his military command; which we insert in his own words.</P>
<P>"I now make it my earnest prayer that God would have you in his holy protection; that he would most graciously be pleased, to dispose us all to do justice, to love mercy, and to demean ourselves with that charity, humility, and pacific temper of mind, which were the characteristics of the divine Author of our blessed religion; with∣out a humble imitation of whose example in these things, we can never hope to be a happy na∣tion."</P>
<P>In fine, were I to give a summary of a real great man, I should say, that he possesses a virtuous, firm, nobly generous and intrepid heart—a clear and pen∣etrating understanding—extensive knowledge—con∣summate wisdom and enterprise—unfeigned faith∣fulness in high offices—a sincere concern for the public good—accompanied with a just sense of relig∣ion, and the superintending Providence of God.—
<PB N="13" REF="037999_0012_100FB085E497AD00"/>
These are leading features of a great character. And if a singular dignity of manners and address can add any thing to the above, they were all found in Wash∣ington.</P>
<P>From good authority,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Fullerton, who resided ten years in the vicinity of Mount Vernon.</NOTE> I have been informed that in private life the General was regular in his family, to an exemplary degree. His words were few, his con∣versation was moral.—Hospitable to strangers—Good to the poor—Sociable with his friend—Forgiving, though reserved, to his enemy—An affectionate hus∣band —Kind to all—flattering to none—and familiar with few.</P>
<P>In viewing the most illustrious characters of other Heroes whether more ancient or modern, even their friends must draw a veil of tenderness over some im∣perfections in their conduct, while they applaud their virtues; but the character of our deceased General can bear a full examination, and appears spotless, as well as splendid, in the sight of his ene∣mies.</P>
<P>The greatness and goodness of his mind evidences the care of a kind Providence towards America, in furnishing him with such abundant gifts for per∣forming high services to his country. A just sense of his worth should excite the exercise of correspon∣dent gratitude to God, who gave Washington to A∣merica; while the same reflection deeply affects our minds, under an impression of our important loss in his death.</P>
<P>In his death, <HI>the mighty is fallen!</HI>—that distinguish∣ed character which has drawn the attention, com∣manded the respect, and excited the admiration of kings and conquerors in Europe; and filled the minds of millions in America with joy. His mem∣ory shall remain embalmed to posterity, while the name of virtuous liberty shall have any friends on earth. <HI>How evident in his death, that great men must
<PB N="14" REF="037999_0013_100FB089C052A828"/>
die!</HI>—How is the mighty fallen!—fallen beneath the power of the king of tyrants—the conqueror of conquerors▪ whom neither talents resist—tears soft∣en —nor dignity disobeys. What shall we conclude but, at thy command, O Death! the stars are final∣ly blown out—and the sun himself may cease to shine.—What art thou? How ghastly thy looks! how cruel thy weapons! how extensive thy domin∣ion! how despotic thy sway! Whence art thou? that with equal ease, and lordly pride, dost throw the prince from his throne, and the peasant from his humble cottage? Art thou that cruel messenger, by whose unrelenting power the loving mother and tender babe, the indulgent husband and beloved wife, are clasped in icy arms, and become the repast of worms and reptiles in the grave?—At thy control, the soldier and the citizen lie in undistinguished ru∣in; and a mighty Washington mingles kindred dust on a level with the lowest in the house of silence. Is it at the doleful tolling of thy bell, O Death, that we hear the sound of thy grating instruments, covering the rich and the poor, the oppressor and the oppress∣ed deep in the dust, to awake no more, till the morning of the resurrection? By the ample sweep of thine enormous scythe, the nations are cut off; and the number of the living is far inferior to that of the dead.</P>
<Q><L>"How populous! how vital, is the grave!</L>
<L>"<HI>This</HI> is the desert, this the solitude."</L>
<BIBL><HI>Night Thoughts.</HI></BIBL></Q>
<P>To the propriety of these observations, the lan∣guage of inspiration, and the experience of all ages fully assent. Long since, the doom of man was an∣nounced by his Maker; "Of dust thou art; and to the dust shalt thou return." Our fathers are not, nor did the prophets live forever—We are continu∣ally informed that God will <HI>bring</HI> us <HI>to death;</HI> to the grave, <HI>the house oppointed for all living—Man in his best estate is vanity—His breath goeth forth; to his earth he
<PB N="15" REF="037999_0014_100FB08C64737B60"/>
returns,</HI> and <HI>that day his thoughts perish,</HI> as to us. <HI>All flesh is as grass and the glory of man is as the flower of the field; the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof knoweth it no more.</HI> Nor need we look for death only in the field of battle, in the billows of the ocean, nor in cities of pestilence; the air we breathe, the food we eat, are fraught with death, and have quivers full of the arrows of destruction. To meet with death, we need not explore the wilds of the forest—expose ourselves to the inclemency of stormy elements, nor wait years, and dread it only in old age; we see it in our common walks; it may follow us to our closet, it may arrest us on the couch of repose; while it consigns Thousands from the breast and womb to the congregation of the dead. We are incessantly seeing <HI>man going to his long home, and the mourners going about the streets.</HI></P>
<P>Let us then improve the solemn dispensation that has called us together, as an incitement to prepare for our own death. Let us <HI>number our days so that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.</HI> The Proprietor of time has now closed another annual circle of days and months, and brought us to the beginning of that year, with which he shall shut up the ample round of the present, and which terminates in the commencement of another Century. Under such important progressions he has closed the very useful life of our beloved Patriot. As we have received good by his life, let us now improve by his death. <HI>All things work together for good to them that love God.</HI> Let us be habitually and actually prepared for death. The disappointments incident to us in the present world, are great and many. The changes that may come upon us in the present year may be such as our wisdom can neither foresee, nor our power be able to prevent; though of the last importance to our∣selves and country. What may be hid in the womb of Providence with respect to us as individuals, who can tell? Who can ascertain his preservation from
<PB N="16" REF="037999_0015_100FB08F5C6FF010"/>
death for one month, one week, nay, for one hour? A few minutes may involve the mind of mortal man in a scene more important to him than Millions of worlds.</P>
<P>Let us then seasonably contemplate the unknown regions of immortality, and look out for the ap∣proach of the king of terrors. Can any of us baffle the power of death, since Washington is dead? Can honor, can affluence, can love of friends or of coun∣try, can an assemblage of virtues, or usefulness in the world, can health of body, or strength of mind save us from death, since He is no more? Can dignity of address, a commanding appearance, added to the most brilliant achievements and the most splendid triumphs, avert the arrows of that inevitable Archer, since they have pierced the life of the highest Hero of America and of the world? Will death respect the most shining dress, the epaulette, the lace, the sword or superb habitation; since the shroud, the coffin, and the grave were prepared for Washington? Can our feeble efforts resist the arrest of death, since that arm which (under God) subdued fleets and armies, has yielded to its control. Under impressions of that high command, "Be ye also ready," may we prepare to follow, <HI>having our loins girded about, and our lights burning, and ourselves like unto men that wait for their Lord.</HI> Let us look above, and beyond Washington, to Jesus, the blessed author of our religion, who has destroyed death. In him, and in him only, we may glory over this king of terrors, and rise superior to his fears. In Jesus we stand composed at his ap∣proach, and smile at the shaking of his spear. In Christ we may anticipate an enlightened chamber for death, and victory over the gloom of the grave. He has stripped death of its terrors.—He is <HI>the resurrection and the life.</HI>—In him, <HI>life and immortality are brought to light by the gospel.</HI></P>
<P>Let us improve this high dispensation, to guard us against every appearance of moral evil. To this les∣son
<PB N="17" REF="037999_0016_100FB09104F33640"/>
the example of the deceased, as well as the con∣stant voice of inspiration, directs. Sin is the cause of death—<HI>Sin has entered the world, and death by sin.</HI> While the pride, avarice, and ambition of many great men in the world, serve as shades to set off the character of our beloved Hero; that himself should not live, is a striking evidence of the dreadful nature of sin in its mortal effects and consequences over the best of men—We shall never be <HI>truly</HI> immortal, until we be <HI>really</HI> sinless. And though such a high attain∣ment, is not the lot of any, even the best, in the pres∣ent life; it is however, our duty to shun sin as dis∣honorable to our Maker, injurious to ourselves, and as greatly unfitting for answering the end of our crea∣tion in this life, or enjoying real happiness in that which is to come. It is only where there is no sin, that there can be no sorrow.</P>
<P>Let us also improve this most humbling Provi∣dence, by way of gratitude to God, that at the most important crisis our country ever saw, we had not on∣ly a Washington alive; but a Washington in the strength of body, and vigor of mind, added to the de∣gree of experience, which form the aggregate of hu∣man life.</P>
<P>And when we contemplate the dangers to which the government of our country, has been, and is still exposed, from foreign influence, intrigues, and do∣mestic faction; and at the same time realize our loss in being bereaved of the man whose voice stilled the tumults of insurrection; let us be thankful to the su∣preme Ruler of the Universe, that our counsel in the cabinet and command in the field, are committed to such able hands as an Adams, and a Hamilton—and let me add, to a Gilman, whom with pleasure I men∣tion as a signal favor and ornament to our State.— May we never be destitute of such emblems and suc∣cessors of Washington to direct the affairs of our state and nation. And may all ranks of citizens, in the
<PB N="18" REF="037999_0017_100FB0940BC0D9A0"/>
exercise of virtue, piety, and real religion, be influ∣enced by a spirit of knowledge, firmness, and faith∣fulness to our country's good. Then, the happiness of America may rise, spread, and endure, till the stars shall cease to shine.</P>

<HEAD>AN ORATION.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY FELLOWCITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHILE I attempt, with humble dif∣fidence, a discharge of the duty, and acknowledge with cordial gratitude the honor assigned me on the present occasion; it affords me high satisfaction, and produces correspondent freedom, that I arise to ad∣dress a candid and enlightened audience, whose minds are not stained with impure adulation, nor that un∣due devotion paid to departed heroes, in aeras of ig∣norance and superstition; nor hardened by that rig∣id austerity, and envious ingratitude, that in this in∣formed age, would consign the characters and ac∣tions of great men to oblivion. Encouraged by this happy state of intellect, in this numerous assembly; I am free to say, your respect for the memory of GENERAL GEORGE WASHINGTON does you honor; and your attachment to military order, and the government of your country, gives every good citizen pleasure.</P>
<P>Agreeably to the Proclamation of the President, we assemble today, to commemorate our beloved Pa∣triot's
<PB N="22" REF="037999_0020_100FB09E28C55120"/>
birth; to contemplate his illustrious life; and to condole and lament in his death. What a high assemblage of different emotions of joy and sorrow, does the remembrance of his character in this view produce in our minds? An assemblage combining distant years, important events, and various achieve∣ments.</P>
<P>On the 22<HI>d</HI> of February, 1732, our Friend, our Father, our Statesman, our Hero was born—A day auspicious to the Columbian world! a morning on which a day-star arose in America!—an aera, which neither our children, nor succeeding generations shall ever forget, till time expires, and days shall be no more. Then was America honored! Then did Virginia, Westmoreland County, and Washington parish, become distinguished spots of the earth.</P>
<P>No sooner had WASHINGTON arrived at the age of twenty years, than the happy influence of his valua∣ble life, bedewed the frontiers of his native state. His discerning and grateful country clothed him with honorable commissions, and vested him with plenary powers for a negotiation with her enemies. In discharging the duties of these youthful honors, he disarmed the savage, and disposed him for peace.</P>
<P>By his superior penetration and prowess, he distin∣guished himself a blessing to his country, triumph∣ing over Indian victory, in saving the remains of Braddock's defeated army, from the wanton cruelty of a barbarous foe. These early and successful exer∣tions were ominous of the future toils and dangers he endured; by which he preserved his country from being a theatre of despotic diversions for Euro∣pean tyrants, to be a garden of liberty for the A∣merican nation.</P>
<P>When the rights of freemen were variously in∣fringed in America; when the chains of British slavery were cunningly hid in chests of tea; when a Gage, a Dunmore, with many others, stood ready to rivet the shackles, by which his country was to
<PB N="23" REF="037999_0021_100FB09FB157AEF0"/>
be violated; her chaste cries reached his ears; he drew his sword which never delighted in blood, and determined to save her. Neither affluence of for∣tune, nor the prejudices of Britain, high in his favor for past services, could produce a single hesitation. He risks all, for love of country, of liberty, and of man. This principle drew him from his beloved and peaceful retirement. This principle induced him to renounce a life of private ease and honor; in which he was distinguished as a Father to the father∣less, the orphan's Shield, the stranger's stay and the widow's Judge; to be more eminently distinguish∣ed in the field of Mars, for his country's general sal∣vation.</P>
<P>At that distressful period, when every moment seemed pregnant with events more important than the productions of a century; we see WASHINGTON at the head of the American arms; elevated in sight of the world, to the performance of command, perilous as <HI>riding the whirlwind,</HI> and arduous as <HI>di∣recting the storms</HI> of heaven. His name carried order and government among his friends; and set bounds to the insolence and arms of his enemies. The heights of Boston can tell; and their warlike entrenchments can witness to his superior Generalship. The absti∣nence, the valor, the unwearied fatigues of Long-Is∣land, York-Island, and the Jerseys; when WASH∣INGTON carried his young and inexperienced coun∣try in his arms, with her countenance heavy, and her heart like to break, are proofs, that he, only grew brave by distress, and collected strength from disappointments. Undismayed by the threats of angry elements, in the storms of winter, and in the highest swellings of the Delaware; unappalled by the smallness of his numbers, with the increase of ev∣ery want; and facing a powerful well equipt and vet∣eran foe; he marshalled his little host; he fired their souls with love of liberty; and by a single effort of his high genius crumbled the overgrown pride of
<PB N="24" REF="037999_0022_100FB0A2627CE738"/>
his enemies to the dust. By this unexpected and surprising victory, he revived the desponding spirits of his country and invigorated her feeble arm for the field.</P>
<P>By his wisdom in war, he often saved the blood of his countrymen; by retreats, triumphing over victory; converting the advances of his enemies in∣to ambuscades for their own destruction; and con∣vinced them, their conquests and successes were tem∣porary and vain.</P>
<P>When we contemplate our American Hero at Brandywine, Germantown, and Monmouth; how undaunted, traversing clouds of smoke, seas of blood, and tempests of fire!—His presence supplying ev∣ery want—animating every soul—bracing every nerve—and braving every danger. His voice in the hour of trial, was as sight to the blind, strength to the weak, courage to the fearful, and comfort to the dying.</P>
<P>Watched by the eagle eye of WASHINGTON, his enemies fly from City to City for rest; and from State to State for territory, to no purpose. He soars aloft, alternately checks and pursues; until the last exertions of his potent foe for fighting or fleeing, are exhausted. By a noble effort of his great abili∣ties, and superior talents in command over our aux∣iliaries from a nation <HI>then</HI> our ally; with the army of America, he finally forced his enemies to surren∣der to his clemency, as a Commander equally dispo∣sed to commiserate the vanquished, as to subdue those in arms; and to convince the power of Brit∣ain of the necessity of turning her thoughts on peace.</P>
<P>These, my fellowmen, are but an imperfect sam∣ple of the heroic lustre and splendid achievements, by which he directed the arms of America; until he evinced her importance, and weighed her indepen∣dence before an astonished world, in the scale of Na∣tions.</P>
<P>When the olive branch succeeded the glitter of
<PB N="25" REF="037999_0023_100FB0A443985190"/>
arms, and the sound of industry and agriculture, the thunders of the field of Mars; the Americans be∣held WASHINGTON with delightful admiration, resign∣ing his high command into the hands of his beloved country, from whom he received it; and amidst the applauding shouts of thousands, returning to Mount Vernon, with the prayers of Millions for blessings perpetual to follow him. In the exercise of his high command, WASHINGTON convinced the wise, that he was more wise; the brave, that he was the most brave; but in his resignation, the good, that he was the best. How far inferior are the Heroes of Eu∣rope, the convulsed state of her nations can witness.</P>
<P>But though WASHINGTON had retired to the peaceful shades of private life; though America is deeply in arrears of gratitude for past services; still she looks to him, as the man that must secure by his counsel in the cabinet, that independence which he had gained in the field, by his sword. Possessing every qualification to finish the Statesman, as well as the General, he is unanimously chosen President of the Convention, which erected that noble struc∣ture, our federal Constitution. What sagacity in reasoning, penetration in judgment, and wisdom in conclusion, guided the Convention over which he presided, in rearing that stupendous fabric, is fully evinced by the happy effects America enjoys under its roof. To this strong hold (under God) are we indebted for preservation from the fury of domestic faction; and from the conquest of terror, and plun∣der, of foreign nations. It is under the covert of this all-protecting edifice, that our gaols are not thrown open by the hand of violence; that our Judges are not torn from the bench of justice; that our ministers of morality and religion are not drag∣ged from their desks; that places of public worship are not converted to play houses, nor our precious sabbaths to a French decade. It is under the banner of this standing testimony of WASHINGTON'S abili∣ties,
<PB N="26" REF="037999_0024_100FB0A5EE61CB68"/>
with those of his copatriots, that we are safe from the storms of endless revolutions, conspiracies and intrigues; and that our wisest statesmen have not felt the dagger of the assassin, on the floor of Congress. It is rallying round this standard of ra∣tional liberty, order and government, that our citi∣zens are not robbed, our houses not rifled, our fair not violated, our old men not miserable; nor our tender infants destroyed on the point of the spear. And give me leave to add, it is under the arch of this mighty building, that America sits yet in her own house, with her children around her; and calls them happy. Happy will they still be, if they real∣ize it, for it is the order of the family.</P>
<P>When the federal Constitution received the sanc∣tion of the people, America looks again to WASH∣INGTON, as the man, whom she still delights to hon∣or; and as worthy of her highest confidence in peace, as well as in war. He is unanimously chosen to hold the chief reins of government. At his coun∣try's call, attested by the joy inspired into all ranks of citizens at his election; he rose from his seat of ease, on which he had been scarce allowed a moment's rest; and in the exercise of self-denial for her good, bowed to her request; and with a diffidence peculiar to a mind equally great in itself, and unsullied by pride or dissimulation, entered on his high office, with a dignified solemnity unknown before in A∣merica. How well he discharged the duties of this high honor, the nations of the earth and the grate∣ful heart of every honest American can witness.— His whole life seemed to indicate, that a special Prov∣idence had raised him up, and given him a rare as∣semblage of virtues, and powers of judgment, to perform a complicated variety of important services; in defending his country in war; and refining and consolidating her government in peace. Like a fo∣cus of light, in which all rays concentre; he possess∣ed whatever was noble, virtuous, and good in man.
<PB N="27" REF="037999_0025_100FB0AB35EC2360"/>
To our American Hero, as to the greatest of mor∣tals, has been, allotted the highest prize of human glo∣ry, in running his race, without stumble, stain, or de∣fect. The fame of his illustrious deeds has explored every region of the earth, and crossed every latitude of the ocean. On WASHINGTON, as on a blazing comet, in the firmament of human stars, the inhabi∣tants of the different Zones have had their eyes e∣qually set; and whether friends or enemies to A∣merica, have been his equal admirers. His name shall remain in the archives of the world, till the re∣cords of time shall cease; and the sublime poet, the lively limner, the curious engraver, and every artifi∣cer of monumental remembrance, will be proud to ex∣hibit the most lively stroke of taste, and the best testi∣mony of invention, to perpetuate the memory of WASHINGTON.</P>
<P>His sword shall be the delight of the brave, and the wonder of the warrior, while arms are in use. And while earth is the habitation of man, the trav∣eller —Indian—Foreigner—or American; as he pass∣es Mount Vernon, will stop; make a solemn pause! and his commemorating soliloquy shall be, There is the honored residence of the FATHER of his Country, the DEFENDER of her Rights, and the BENEFACTOR of man. When the good, the great, the learned, or illiterate, the soldier or citizen, look at the tomb of WASHINGTON, they will drop the generous tear on his urn, while the memory of his virtues and valor enlivens their innate respect for his dust and ashes.</P>
<P>But alas, he is no more! We are bereaved of WASHINGTON forever! For this, our country utters her groans of grief, and is deeply sorry. For this, the chair of her state, and the desk of her temple are shrouded in sable—For this, the hilt of her sword, and the arm of her citizen, are clothed in crape— For this, her drums are muffled, her trumpets are hoarse, and her music mourns. And for this her national fortitude stands this day in arms reversed,
<PB N="28" REF="037999_0026_100FB0AF01CB55D8"/>
not ashamed of the tear of heavy wo on her cheek. Let us condole with her. If our hearts are not ada∣mant; if our eyes are not flint; they will melt, they will weep for WASHINGTON. To melt is pleasant, to weep is manly; to forget him is ingratitude of the blackest hue; and to be indifferent under such a high dispensation, is impious insensibility.</P>
<P>At his birth, the pillars of tyranny trembled; in his life, kings and conquerors darkened under his superior lustre; and at his death, the nations mourn. If the united abilities that accomplish the General, Patriot, and Statesman, could have baffled the pow∣er of death, WASHINGTON had never died. If the united prayers of the virtuous in America, from his Excellency ADAMS, to the lowest citizen, could have availed, WASHINGTON were yet alive. And the most expressive tokens of respect, from the first characters in the different quarters of the world, to WASHING∣TON, authorize me to say; that if the desires of the good and the great, in Europe, Asia, and Africa, added to the tears of the tawny tribes to the western Ocean, could have softened the king of terrors, our AMERICAN CHIEF were yet spared. But he is gone forever from us—we shall hear his voice no more— To us, in this stupendous dispensation,
<Q><L>"The ways of Heaven are dark and intricate;</L>
<L>"Puzzled in mazes, and perplexed with errors!</L>
<L>"Nor know we where the regular confusion ends."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Addison.</NOTE></L>
<P>"Thy ways are in the sea, and thy paths in the mighty wa∣ters, and thy footsteps are not known."<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">David.</NOTE></P></Q></P>
<P>Were an enemy to invade our coasts, wide as the sea, is the breach made in our army by his death; and to those who realized his worth in the day of danger, heart-rending indeed is that dispensation by which the Deliverer of our country, the Founder of our government, and the Bulwark of our nation, is
<PB N="29" REF="037999_0027_100FB0B0ADCD76C0"/>
hid forever from our sight. Had this awful Provi∣dence taken place in America, when his arm was her support in the field of struggle and distress; and when one stumble in his walk would have made her heart tremble, and her countenance sad; who can say, that we, with our little ones, might not sit to∣day, under the darkness of monarchial government, in the sackcloth of slavery. Thank Heaven, it was otherwise ordered; and while submission to the high decree of his decease should humble every American in the dust, every heart should mingle gratitude with mourning, that heaven has spared his illustri∣ous life so long.</P>
<P>Let us not forget the memory of our beloved WASHINGTON; and it will not cease to do us good. In his life, we have a combination of examples for all classes of citizens, from the chief seat of govern∣ment, to the humble peasant. In the firmness of his integrity, wisdom of his administration, dignity of his manners, with his unremitted concern for the public good; we have a noble example for every description of public officers. In the pious good∣ness of his heart, illustrated by the justice, temper∣ance, tender benevolence, and universal correctness and purity of his manners in private life; we have all an example in WASHINGTON for living; and in his magnanimous, resigned composure in death, a precious example for dying. The latter fully ac∣cords with the former. General GEORGE WASH∣INGTON died in the full possession of his reason, without a groan, though in extreme distress; per∣fectly resigned to the will of heaven, and ready to wing his way from this vale of tears, we trust, to the mansions of bliss, and endless repose. May a deep impression of our common Father's memory, excite millions of his extensive family to be like him, pi∣ous, brave, virtuous, wise, and good!</P>

<HEAD>MEMORANDUM.</HEAD>
<P>THIS great man's ancestors came from Old England, in the year <HI>1657.</HI> He is of the third descent after their mi∣gration, the first fruit of a second marriage; born on the <HI>22</HI>d February, <HI>1732,</HI> in the parish of Washington, West∣moreland county, Virginia. His Father's family was numerous.—His education was principally managed by a private Tutor, which has been often the case in families of distinction in Virginia. His Father died when he was but ten years of age.</P>
<P>In the fifteenth year of his age he had determined to go to sea; and had his baggage prepared for embarkation; but through the reluctance of his surviving parent to a seafaring life, he relinquished his determination.</P>
<P>When he was in the twentieth year of his age, he was honored with a Major's commission.—In his twenty second year, he was invested with plenary powers to negociate with the French and Canadians, who were making inroads on the frontiers of the British Colonies.—He fulfilled the de∣sign of his mission with singular industry, intelligence, and address.—It is said his journals were published to the world and announced, at that early time of his life, the greatness of mind and correct manner of doing business, which have since characterized him in the management of more ardu∣ous undertakings.</P>
<P>In <HI>1755,</HI> he saved the broken remains of Braddock's defeated army, at Fort Duquesne.—But innumerable, and too tedious to mention, were the hardships he endured, and the plans he devised, to defend the frontiers during the war with France.</P>
<P>Peace being restored to the middle colonies in <HI>1758,</HI> and his health having been greatly injured by the war, he re∣signed his commission the year following.—</P>
<P>After his health was gradually restored, he married an amiable widow of merit and wealth, with whom he has no issue.—He was often chosen by the suffrages of his fel∣low citizens to fill a seat in the General Assembly of Virginia. —He was Magistrate in his county, and Judge of the Court.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="037999_0029_100FB0B3C47CC5F0"/>In <HI>1774,</HI> he was chosen a Member of the first American Congress—And the year following, Commander in Chief of the American Forces.—With what consummate abilities he formed a body of peasantry to a regular army, and fit to en∣counter the flower of veteran troops, remains unparalleled in the annals of past ages, and will remain the admiration of the world for ages to come.</P>
<P>At the close of the war, he resigned his command and retired to his seat in Virginia—Multitudes thronged his passage, both in city and in country, hailing him as the pre∣server of their liberties, the giver of their independence, and the restorer of peace.</P>
<P>In <HI>1787,</HI> He was elected a member of the Federal Con∣vention, and its President, while framing the federal Constitution, under which we now may so happily live.— In <HI>1789,</HI> he was unanimously chosen President of the U∣nited States of America, and inducted into office on the <HI>30</HI>th of April, in the City of New York in the gallery of the federal Hall in the view of thousands of spectators.— The oath was administered by Chancellor Livingston. Se∣veral circumstances concurred to render this ceremony un∣usually solemn—The presence of the Father and Deliverer of his country—The impression of gratitude for past servi∣ces—The vast concourse of spectators—The devout and reverential manner in which he bowed, and in which he re∣ceived the oath; together with the consideration of his be∣ing chosen to the most dignified office in America, and per∣haps in the world, by the unanimous voice of more than three Millions of enlightened freemen; all conspired to place this among the most august and interesting scenes which have ever been exhibited on the theatre of time. A specta∣tor of this scene was so struck with the solemnity of it, as an appeal to heaven and earth at once, that when the Chancellor pronounced, <HI>LONG LIVE GEORGE WASH∣INGTON,</HI> his sensibility was wound up to such a pitch, that he could only wave his hat without being able to join one word in the repeated acclamations that rent the air.— To this office he was rechosen until he finally declined a re-election; at which time he formed an address which for
<PB N="32" REF="037999_0030_100FB0B670497340"/>
wisdom of policy, justness of thought, perspicuity of style and purity of language, is second to none, nor equalled by any. This address is recommended to us now as the legacy of a political father to his family; and we are justly told to read it, and to read it aloud that all the house may hear.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The principal part of the preceding <HI>Memorandum</HI> is extracted from Dr. Morse's Geography, and is here inserted for the use of those who may have few means or opportunities of information on this most interesting subject.</NOTE></P>
<P>We add; his care for his country's good is very evident in his last public act of condescension in accepting the ap∣pointment of Lieut. General of the American army; which office he has resigned with his life; which we are informed took place as follows. On Friday, the day before he died, he spent some time in marking a gravel walk which he had in contemplation, on the banks of the Potowmac.—There came a fall of snow which did not deter him from his pursuit.—He continued till his neck and hair were quite covered with snow. He spent the evening with Mrs. Wash∣ington, reading the newspapers;—went to bed as usual a∣bout nine of the clock—waked in the night very unwell.— In the morning finding himself still so—sent for Dr. Craik of Alexandria. Soon after his arrival, two consulting Phy∣sicians were sent for, but all to no purpose.—His disorder would not yield to medicine; and by twelve of the clock at night on Saturday, the <HI>14</HI>th of December, <HI>1799</HI>—expired without a groan—in the <HI>68</HI>th year of his age. He said a few minutes before his death, "Bury me decently, and not till two days after my decease."—To Dr. Craik he said: "I die a very hard death, but I am not afraid to die."— Before he breathed his last, he laid himself on his back, placed his hands before him, and closed his own mouth and eyes.</P>
<P>These extracts are from a letter sent from a Gentleman of respectability in Philadelphia, dated January <HI>20</HI>th, who had recently returned, from Mount Vernon; after the General's death.</P>
