<P>A TREATISE CONCERNING THE PROPERTIES AND EFFECTS OF COFFEE.</P>
<P>FIRST AMERICAN EDITION.</P>
<P>BY BENJAMIN MOSELEY, M. D. Physician to His Royal Highness the Duke of York, and his House∣hold; to his royal highness the duke of Clarence, and his Household; to His Majesty's Royal Military Hospi∣tal at Chelsea; Member of the Royal College of Physicians of London, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</HEAD>
<P>THE reception which the first Edition of this Treatise has met with, has made it necessary to publish a second; which I now present to the Reader, with such additions, as I hope will be acceptable and useful.</P>
<P>I have collected many authorities, to corrobo∣rate what I have advanced; that as my opinions have prejudices to contend with, they may not, however, be objectionable on the ground of sin∣gularity, and be considered as supported by no other testimony than my own.</P>
<P>IN treating of the salutary advantages, which the Public will derive, individually, from the gene∣ral use of Coffee, it is impossible not to reflect also, on the political benefits which will accrue to the Parent State, by increasing its cultivation in her Colonies.</P>
<P>To the Colonists themselves the object is very extensive; and surely the prosperity of so import∣ant a part of the Empire, as our West Indian Islands, demands the most liberal attention on the part of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>FROM the produce of our plantations, that "magnificent property," as Mons. NECKER terms the French Colonies,
"which only the su∣perficial
<PB N="iv" REF="047837_0003_10249D0612EC19D8"/>and ignorant affect to undervalue,"
this Country receives great additions to her Revenue, and a total supply of one of the most useful arti∣cles (perhaps now a necessary) of life. Yet, from the calamities lately inflicted on some of them by the hand of Providence, and the accu∣mulated burthens which the Public necessities have laid on them all, many of the Planters are involved in ruin; and those who escape, must owe their deliverance to the bravest struggles of industrious virtue.</P>
<P>THE population of White Inhabitants which is the great security of the Islands, consists chiefly of those who cultivate the inferior Staple Commodi∣ties, among which, Coffee is now the principal; and this population has always been proportiona∣ble to the increase or decrease of those Staples. Indigo may be instanced as an example: When Indigo was encouraged in Jamaica, before that impolitic duty was laid on it, which exterminated the cultivation of it in our colonies, and gave it to the French, there were considerably more White Inhabitants in that Island, than there are at present, though the Island now produces five times the quantity of Sugar and Rum it did at that time.</P>
<P>THE cultivation of Coffee requiring but little capital, is an inducement for people of small for∣tunes, to settle in the Islands. It is a creditable refuge for the industrious man, who has been un∣fortunate in Trade, and to those whose larger schemes in life have failed.—It is an easy em∣ployment; the labour light, and many parts of it performed by children. The situations and soil where it is carried on, must be dry, and of course healthy, to be advantageous. Coffee Plantations
<PB N="v" REF="047837_0004_10249D07EDCACB28"/>in particular, may be considered as a Nursery of useful Inhabitants for the Colonies.</P>
<P>THE Soil best suited for coffee, is happily such as can be spared from every other purpose. Large tracts of poor land, which would otherwise lie waste and useless, may be rendered as profitable as the best, without the mortality and casualties atten∣dant on severe labour in hot climates.</P>
<P>THE numerous little families which live on Coffee Plantations, and are dispersed in small settlements, in the interior parts of the Islands, occasion the mountainous and woody lands to be cleared and opened; and to be intersected with roads and easy communications.</P>
<P>THUS the residents live in safety, and all sorts of property acquire a proportionate value and security. The retreats of fugitive Negroes are laid open; plunder and depredation prevented, and conspiracies for rebellion are deprived of their hiding-places.—And thus the credit of the Plan∣ter, and security of the Merchant, stand on a firm basis: Those commotions being prevented, which have so often disturbed the tranquillity of the Islands, and occasioned the ruin of many In∣dividuals abroad and at home, to the great de∣falcation of that immense Revenue, which these Islands pay to the Mother-Country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Duties and Excises, upon a Computation for the year 1781, amount to about £1,346<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>12, sterling, annually, on the produce of <HI>Jamaica</HI> only.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE truth is, that Sugar Plantations, though they are the great sources of wealth to their propri∣etors, as well as to Government, do not employ a sufficient number of White People for their inter∣nal security, against the insurrections of the negroes. The manufacture is simple, and the labour whol∣ly
<PB N="vi" REF="047837_0005_10249D0B025997D0"/>carried on by Slaves; and though the Defici∣ency Law of Jamaica directs, that one White Person shall be employed for every thirty Slaves, under a penalty of thirty pounds per annum for every deficiency; yet, this Law is often defeated, or the fine submitted to; as White Servants are expensive, and a less number than that proporti∣on, is sufficient for the purposes of making Su∣gar.</P>
<P>THE cultivation of inferior Staple Commodities, is therefore necessary to the very existence of the Sugar Colonies; and I am persuaded, will prove to them more beneficial in many respects, than at present is generally imagined.—Here, then, is an open and grateful field for Colonial Patriotism; in which the <HI>Amor Patriae</HI> will neither find op∣position from envy, nor disappointment from in∣gratitude.—Here is the occasion to demonstrate the love of our Country, and to perpetuate a benefit to mankind, which will never be forgotten: and while a PEMRHYN, a LONG, and an EDWARDS, continue to point out to the Public, with that abi∣lity by which they are as much distinguished as by their weight and consequence, the true interest of the Sugar Colonies, and of this Country, as connected with them, there will never be wanting some men, at least in the Administration of this Kingdom, who will understand that a subject of the realm, exerting his industry at four thousand miles distance, may be employed as beneficially to the State, and is as much deserving the protec∣tion of it, as the Country 'Squire, who leaves his fox-hounds, to give a silent vote or two during the winter, and retires the remainder of the year to his <HI>Sabine Fields</HI> in sloth and ignorance.</P>
<P>SIR NICHOLAS LAWS was the first person who planted Coffee in Jamaica;—but dying three
<PB N="vii" REF="047837_0006_10249D0D658BF040"/>years afterwards, in 1731, he had not the happi∣ness to see the cultivation of it make any conside∣rable progress.</P>
<P>IN 1732, several of the Planters and Merchants, belonging to the Island, became patrons of the un∣dertaking; and convinced, that under proper en∣couragement it might be of importance to the Island, and that Coffee might become a flourishing Staple Article of produce, they subscribed the sum of 220l. 10s. towards defraying the charges of soliciting an Act of Parliament for lowering the Inland Duty, upon the importation of Coffee from Jamaica into Great Britain; which at that time was 10l. sterling per Cwt. The circum∣stance being but little known at present, and considering what obligation the Island is under to their exertions, I am happy in having an oppor∣tunity of inserting their names, as a proper tribute to the memory of those benefactors to the Colony, and Friends to the Nation.</P>

<P>In the same year, and in consequence of this so∣licitation, the <HI>Act</HI> 5<HI>th Geo.</HI> II. was passed, enti∣tled, "An Act for encouraging the growth of Coffee in his Majesty's Plantations in <HI>America.</HI>"— The preamble recites, that the soil and climate of Jamaica, are particularly adapted for the growth of this Commodity; and the act itself reduces the Inland Duty upon British Plantation Coffee impor∣ted into Great Britain, from two shillings, to eighteen pence per pound:—And here it stood for many years, producing a Revenue to the Crown of about 10,000l. per anum. A few years ago, on the representation of the West India Planters, <HI>Lord John Cavendish,</HI> the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, consented to the very important re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ion of one shilling more; thereby furnishing a most useful lesson to all future Financiers,—<HI>the present Duty of sixpence per pound actually produ∣cing nearly three times the sum that was received when the Duty was eighteen pence</HI>: So true is the doctrine, that heavy taxation defeats its own purpose.</P>
<P>IT has been computed, that one acre of land will contain 1100 Coffee plants, which will pro∣duce berries in eighteen months from the sowing of the seed. The trees will continue bearing for seven or eight years.—Each tree, after the first bearing, may produce, at a medium, one and an half or two pounds weight, one with another; and
<PB N="ix" REF="047837_0008_10249D11DBDF6BF8"/>six or eight servants can manage ten or twelve acres, besides cultivating provisions for themselves. Upon this ground of calculation, it is apparent, that one acre of land, supposing the weather not unfavourable, may yield annually from 1700lb. to 2200lb. weight, which, when brought to mar∣ket, may sell for 9l. 15s. to 12l. 15s. sterling <HI>net.</HI> This, it is true, is but a small profit; for it is little more than five farthings per pound, whereas the <HI>Duty alone is sixpence per pound.</HI> If the Duty was equalized to that upon Sugar, the medium profits per acre, would be a∣bout 40l. per annum. At present, the <HI>net</HI> pro∣fits upon this Article, and upon Sugar in Jamaica, are nearly equal per acre;—that is, 10l. or 12l. sterling.</P>
<P>IN the year 1752, the export of Coffee from Ja∣maica, was rated at 60,000 pounds weight. In 1775, it was 440,000 pounds weight.—Under the present Duty of sixpence per pound, there is rea∣son to expect, that the exports may rather in∣crease than diminish. But it is not likely to be∣come a subject of very extensive culture in our West Indian Islands, until even this Duty is low∣ered, or at least while <HI>Foreign</HI> Coffee is permitted to enter into competition with it at the British mar∣ket. Though the Planters of Jamaica after a mul∣titude of experiments, and the most laudable exer∣tions, have discovered the art of cultivating, picking, and curing the berries, so as to make their Coffee equal to the growth of Arabia. Some samples have been produced from that Island, lately, which were pronounced by the London Dealers, even superior to the best that has been brought from the East.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="047837_0009_10249D1417DCBBF0"/>WHAT revolutions may change the nature of our commerce, were it possible to foresee, it is not in my province to examine; but the Legisla∣ture of England, as well as those of her Colonies, have a wise example before them, in the conduct of France; by her promoting and protecting the growth of every thing, that can supply the place of those articles which Europe purchaces in the East Indies. <HI>Piementa (Myrtus Arborea Aroma∣tica foliis laurinis),</HI> or All-spice, as it is com∣monly called, from having a flavour, composed, as it were, of cloves, cinnamon, juniper berries, nutmegs, and pepper, is the peculiar spice of Jamaica<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From 12,000 to 15,000 bags of Piementa, have been annually imported into England from Jamaica; Each bag contains about one hundred weight. It pays a Duty of about two-pence per pound.</NOTE>: And it equals in virtues, and is more applicable to the general purposes of life, and lux∣ury too, than any spice that is brought from the East. The various uses into which <HI>Piementa</HI> is converted in Europe, are but little known to those who raise it. One secret, at least, I am able to divulge to them, which is, that its essential oil, coloured with <HI>Alkanet Root,</HI> to give it the ap∣pearance of age, is sold all over Europe for the oil of cloves<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The principal and prevailing flavour of Piementa, is like that of Cloves: Its oil exactly resembles the oil of that spice, and sinks as that does in water. The oil resides chiefly, like that of Cloves, in the shell, or cortical part.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SIR HANS SLOANE, in the Phil. Trans. Abr. vol. II. p. 667, says that "<HI>Piementa</HI> may deser∣vedly be counted the best and most temperate, mild, and innocent of common spices; and fit to come into greater use, and gain more ground, than it yet hath, of the East India commodities
<PB N="xi" REF="047837_0010_10249D1710A70FC0"/>of this kind; almost all of which it far surpasses, by promoting the digestion of meat, attenuating tough humours, moderately heating, strengthening the stomach, expelling wind, and doing those friend∣ly offices to the bowels, we generally expect from spices." To this inferiority of the dear-bought and far-fetched spices of the East, I can bear am∣ple testimony;—while the spice in question, be∣ing the produce one of our own Colonies, and growing there in the greatest abundance, can be afforded at a price, that the poor of Great Britain may have all the comforts of its excellent proper∣ties; which I trust will be sufficiently made known to them hereafter.</P>
<P>THE encouraging every article which increas∣es the intercourse with our Colonies, is increa∣sing our Commerce. The payment for all the sta∣ples of the West Indies, is made in our Manufac∣tures; the sale of which must increase, in pro∣portion to the numbers that are employed in the cultivation of what is bartered for them. Our West Indian Islands, without draining us of spe∣cie or bullion, can supply us with many of those very articles for which we are drained in other parts of the world<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The India Company pay for the Mocha Coffee, in Specie. The original cost, is about 7l. sterling per Cwt.</NOTE>. The quantity of shipping and seamen, necessarily employed in carrying supplies thither, and transporting their commo∣dities back to Europe, must be very considerable. To these reflections it must also be added, that the political disadvantage of not encouraging our own Colonies, is, that we must encourage those of the French; which do, and will supply our markets, to the detriment of our Revenue, and the impoverishing of our Colonies.</P>
<P><PB REF="047837_0011_10249D18945732F8"/>THUS France, with that transcendant wisdom which actuates her Government, constantly keep∣ing in view the grand political maxim of selling to all the world, and "not buying from the stran∣ger," adds to the native riches of her great Coun∣try, all the Specie of Europe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mons. Necker</HI> says that there is now as much Specie in France, as in all Europe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>des; Ten times as much as the Specie and Bank-paper together in England; and that France has been acquiring for the last fifteen years, the annual addition of 40,000,000<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Livers: 1,750,000l. sterling: Equal to the increase of the coin of all the other European States put together.</NOTE>. How long our superiority in some branches of Manufacture, may stand in her way, I cannot tell; but in imitating her example, "by improving the produce of our own soil," and by encouraging the consumption at home of such Commodities, as give employment to our own subjects abroad, England <HI>will do</HI> as France <HI>has done</HI>—enrich her Colonies, increase their attachment, and establish a population there necessa∣ry for their preservation:—augment her national marine, strengthen her government, and aggran∣dise her empire.</P>

<P>IT is a generally received opinion, that the human frame is not less influenced by diet than by climate; that its dispositions and characte∣ristics owe their originality as much to food, as those diseases evidently do, which are the legiti∣mate and indisputable issue of it.</P>
<P>IF the preceding position be just, there cannot surely be a subject more interesting to man, than the pursuit of that knowledge which may instruct him to avoid what is hurtful to health, to select for his use such things as tend to raise the value of his condition, and to carry the enjoyments of life to their utmost improvement.</P>
<P>WITH this idea, I venture to submit to the Pub∣lic some observations which have occurred to me, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and medicinal properties and effects <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="047837_0013_10249D1E0DE52CB8"/>IN England, the use of this berry hitherto has been principally confined to the occasional lux∣ury of individuals; as such, it is scarcely an ob∣ject of public concern; but Government wisely considering that this produce of our own West-India Islands is raised by our fellow-subjects, and paid for in our manufactures, has lately redu∣ced the duty on the importation of Plantation Coffee; which has brought it within the reach of almost every description of people; and as it is not liable to any pernicious process in curing it, and is incapable of adulteration, the use of it will probably become greatly extended;—as in other countries, it may diffuse itself among the mass of the people, and make a considerable ingredient in their daily sus∣tenance.</P>
<P>THE Plant, the Berries, and the Beverage, made from them, commonly pass under the same name. The beverage, of which we speak in par∣ticular, is called by the Egyptians <HI>Elkarie</HI>; by the Persians <HI>Cahwa</HI>; by the Arabians <HI>Cachua,</HI> and <HI>Coava</HI>; by the Turks <HI>Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve,</HI> and <HI>Cahue,</HI> from whence originate <HI>Caphè, Caffé, Coffi, Coffee,</HI> and <HI>Coff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> names by which it is universally known in Europe.</P>
<P>THE botanical description of the <HI>Coffee Plant</HI> has been already given by several writers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 paragraph" DISP="〈1 paragraph〉"/></NOTE>; and
<PB N="15" REF="047837_0014_10249D205802F518"/>as Sir Hans Sloane, in the Ph. Trans. No. 208, p. 63; Dr. Browne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in his Natural History of Jamaica, and Mr. Ellis, in 17774, have added to the number, it is unnecessary here to say any thing on this subject, or to treat of its Cultivation, but I though it might not to uninteresting in this Essay, to include something of its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hew it no less remarkable for the universality with which it has been adopted by many regions of the East, than for the permanently, after vari∣ous persecutions, with which it has been retained; notwithstanding the caprice of Taste, the violence of Laws, and the austerity of Religion.</P>
<P>THE following account, from Arabian autho∣rity, is descriptive of the commotions and preju∣dices, which Coffee formerly had to contend with and conquer, among the Mahometans. Besides the similitude it bears to the ludicrous notions, and contradictory opinions concerning Coffee in later times, it may not be unentertaining to those who are accustomed to reflect, how great commu∣nities are often violently agitated by trifles; and that kingdoms as well as individuals, may be se∣riously ridiculous, and equally subject to transito∣ry delusion. It will appear also that Coffee, which after may struggles triumphed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>er the scru∣tiny of physicians, had nearely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>der the in∣fluence of the <HI>Alcoran</HI>; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> contest be∣tween the <HI>Alcoran</HI> and Coffee ended, as it were, in a coalition.</P>
<P>"KHAIR BEG, Governor of <HI>Mecca</HI> by appoint∣ment of the <HI>Sultan</HI> of Egypt, was unacquainted with
<PB N="16" REF="047837_0015_10249D21DBBA01D8"/>Coffee, or of the manner of taking it. As he was going out of the Mosque one day after evening prayer he observed in a corner of it a company of people drinking Coffee, who were to spend the night there in prayer, and was much offended at it. He thought at first they had been drinking wine; nor was his surprise much diminished af∣ter they had explained to him the use and virtues of this honor. On the contrary after they had informed him how much it was in use in <HI>Mecca,</HI> and what merriment passed at the public places were it was sold, he was of opinion that Coffee was intoxicating, at least that it conduced to things for∣bidden by law.</P>
<P>"FOR this reason, after having ordered these people to go out of the Mosque, with an injuncti∣on never to meet there for the future upon the like occasion, he next day convened a great assembly Officers of Justice, and Doctors of Law, together with Priests, and the most eminent men of <HI>Mecca</HI> to whom he communicated what he had observed the night before in the Mosque and what he was informed happened frequently in the public Coffee-houses; adding that he was resolved to remedy this abuse, upon which he was desi∣rous first to know their opinions.</P>
<P>"THE Doctors agreed that the public Coffee-houses wanted regulation, as being contrary to the law of pure Mahometanism: and declared that with respect to Coffee, it was necessary to examine whe∣ther it was hurtful either to body or mind; and concluded to take the advice of Physicians.</P>
<P>"THE Governor called <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> two Persons who were brothers, the most celebrated physicians in <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/></HI>: one of them even wrote against the use of Coffee, jealous, perhaps (says our Author), l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st
<PB N="17" REF="047837_0016_10249D23981A78A0"/>the use of it should spoil their practice; so they did, not fail to declare, that Coffee was cold and dry, and prejudicial to health.</P>
<P>"A DOCTOR of the assembly replied, that BENGIAZLAH, an ancient Arabian physician of great authority, had said that these berries were hot and dry and consequently could not have the qualities just now ascribed to them.</P>
<P>"THE two Persian physicians replied, that BENGIAZLAH was a perfect stranger to the berries in question; and declared, that if Coffee was rec∣koned among things indifferent, and free for every body to make use of, yet it was apt to lead to things not allowed of; and the safest way for true Mussulmen would be, to hold it unlaw∣ful.</P>
<P>"THIS determination obtained all their suffra∣ges; and several, either out of prejudice, or false zeal, did not fail to affirm that Coffee had actually disturbed their brains. One of the assistants main∣tained, that it intoxicated like wine, which set all the assembly a laughing; because, in order to make a judgment of it, it was necessary to have drank wine, which is forbidden by the Mahome∣tan religion. He was asked whether he had ever drank any wine and he had the imprudence to answer in the affirmative; which confession condemned him to the bastinado, the punish∣ment that is inflicted for this crime.</P>
<P>"COFFEE was however solemnly condemned at <HI>Mecca,</HI> as a thing forbidden by law, notwith∣standing the <HI>Mufti</HI> opposed the determination. But this rigour was not of long duration; for the <HI>Sultan</HI> of Egypt, far from approving of the indis∣creet zeal of the Governor of <HI>Mecca,</HI> was surprised that he should dare to condemn a thing so much in favour at <HI>Cairo,</HI> the capital of his dominions,
<PB N="18" REF="047837_0017_10249D2588B61270"/>where there were Doctors of much greater autho∣rity than those of <HI>Mecca,</HI> and who had not found any thing in the use of Coffee contrary to the law.</P>
<P>"THE <HI>Sultan</HI> ordered him therefore to revoke his prohibition, and to employ his authority against the diorders only, if there were any, com∣mitted in the Coffee houses; adding that because <HI>it was possible to abuse the very best things,</HI> even the water of the fountain ZERVIZEM, in the Tem∣ple of MECCA, so much esteemed by all Mussel∣men, it was not for that reason necessary absolute∣ly to forbid them.</P>
<P>"THE two physicians who bore so great a part in the prohibition of Coffee, came to an unfortunate end.</P>
<P>"AFTER the re-establishment of Coffee at <HI>Mecca,</HI> it was prohibited again, and again re∣established.</P>
<P>"THE <HI>Sultan</HI> of Egypt consulted his Doctors of the Law upon this point; who gave their opini∣ons in writing, and proved by substantial reasons, the fallacy of that condemnation, and the igno∣rance of those who passed it; which established the use of Coffee at <HI>Cairo,</HI> upon a much stronger footing than ever. But in the end, this great city also met with much trouble upon this sub∣ject.</P>
<P>"IN the year 1523 a scrupulous Doctor stated, that Coffee intoxicates the head, and is prejudicial to health; and asked whether it was lawful or unlawful? But none of his brethren were of his opinion, because it was obvious that Coffee had not those bad qualities he ascribed to it; and therefore this gave no shock at all to a custom so u∣niversally received.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="047837_0018_10249D2A5C59B4A8"/>"BUT about ten years after, a preacher held forth so vehemently against the use of Coffee as a thing prohibited by law, that the mob fell upon the Coffee-houses, broke the pots and dishes, and abused the company they found there.</P>
<P>"UPON this there were two parties formed in the city; one of which maintained that Coffee was prohibited by the law; the other, that it was not. But the Judge in chief, having convened an as∣sembly of all the Doctors, to have their opinions, they all unanimously declared that the question had been already determined by their predeces∣sors, in favour of Coffee; that they were all of the same sentiment; and that there was nothing fur∣ther necessary than only to restrain the extrava∣gant heat of the zealots, and the indiscretion of ignorant preachers. The Judge who presided was of the same opinion; and immediately order∣ed all the assembly to be served with Coffee, and took some himself: an example which presently composed all controversies, and made Coffee more fashionable than before.</P>
<P>"AT the time when this custom was most pre∣valent in <HI>Constantinople,</HI> the <HI>Imans</HI> and officers of the Mosques made a great clamour, that they were deserted, whilst all the Coffee-houses were conti∣nually crowded. The Dervizes and priests fell foul upon Coffee; not only affirming that it was unlawful, but that it was a much greater sin to go to a Coffee-house than to a Tavern.</P>
<P>"AFTER a great deal of noise and declamation, all the Priests united to obtain a solemn condem∣nation of this liquor; and maintained that Coffee roasted was a sort of coal; and that every thing which had the least relation to a coal, was forbid∣den by law. Upon this they drew up a question in form, and presented it to the <HI>Mufti,</HI> with a re∣quest that he would determine it according to the
<PB N="20" REF="047837_0019_10249D2C96B33BC8"/>duty of his office. The <HI>Mufti,</HI> without giving himself the trouble of examining any difficulties, gave a determination according to the mind of the Priests and pronounced that Coffee was prohibited by the law of MAHOMET.</P>
<P>"ALL the Coffee-houses in <HI>Constantinople</HI> were immediately shut up, and the officers of the police ordered to prevent the drinking of Coffee in what manner soever.</P>
<P>"YET notwithstanding the rigour that was used in the execution of this order, they could, never prevent the use of it in private. AMURATH III. in whose time this prohibition had taken place, again indulged a liberty with regard to a thing so agreeable, and which was believed other∣wise not contrary to religion; so that it was al∣lowed to be drank in men's own houses, and grew more and more into esteem. At last, the officers of the police, seeing there was no remedy, were content for a certain sum, to permit it to be sold, provided it was not in public; so that it was al∣lowed to be drank in private houses, shutting up the doors, or in the back shops.</P>
<P>"THERE wanted but little, to establish by de∣grees the public Coffee-houses. It happened that a new <HI>Mufti,</HI> less scrupulous, or more wise than his predecessor, declared solemnly that Coffee ought not to be looked upon as a coal; and that the liquor made from it was not prohibited by the law. After this declaration, the Zealots, Preach∣ers, Doctors, Lawyers, and <HI>Mufti</HI> himself, far from exclaiming against Coffee, took it them∣selves; and their example was universally fol∣lowed by the whole Court and City<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage into Arabia Felix, p. 282, 296.

<P><PB N="21" REF="047837_0020_10249D2E188D0CA8"/>COFFEE, though a native of <HI>Arabia Felix,</HI> had been converted into use in Africa and Persia, long before a beverage was made of it by the Arabians<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An Arabia <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of France's Liberty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE>.</P>
<P>ABOUT the middle of the fifteenth century, the <HI>Mufti</HI> of Aden, a city in Arabia Felix, travelling into Persia, learnt the use of it there, and on his return introduced it to his countrymen.</P>
<P>IT is from this period, that any authentic ac∣count of the dietetic use of Coffee is derived. En∣thusiasm indeed his carried some admirers of this berry so far into conjecture, as to trace its virtues back to the remotest ages: and to suppose it the <HI>Nepenthe</HI> which HELEN received from an Egypti∣an Lady, and is celebrated by HOMER as a soo∣ther of the mind, in the extremest state of anger, grief, and misfortune.</P>
<P>FROM Aden it spread its influence through all Arabia, and other parts of the Ottoman Empire, and arrived at Constantinople in the reign of So∣lyman the Great, in the year 1554; and about a century afterwards, it was adopted at London and Paris.</P>
<P>THE virtues of this chearful liquor, like mo∣ral virtues under despotism, operated in Con∣stantinople to its detriment:—by dispelling the torpitude brought on by their vicious excesses, and recruiting their spirits, sunk by the depravity of their habits, it introduced a disposition to exercise the understanding,—a crime in every Govern∣ment that tolerates nothing but silent obedi∣ence.</P>

These were objections from which the latter was free. This famous edict appears to have had no other relative effect than to diminish the revenue; for Coffee throve under this political, as well as it did under the former religious, persecution.</P>
<P>HOWEVER strange it may appear at this time, Coffee had similar difficulties to encounter soon after its introduction into England; for it experi∣enced the same treatment under CHARLES the IId. that it met with in Turkey under an AMURATH and a MAHOMET: it having been found an encou∣rager of social meetings, Coffee-houses were shut up by proclamation, as seminaries of sedi∣tion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Anno 1675.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>RAY observed, that the part of Arabia which produced Coffee in such abundance, might truly be stiled happy <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Kingdom of Yemen.</NOTE>; from whence many millions of bushels of this valuable treasure were then annual∣ly exported to Turkey, Barbary, and Europe <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Abbe Raynal</HI> says that twelve millions five hundred and fifty thousand pounds weight of Coffee is now annually expo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed from Arabia Felix; which at 14 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>is per pound, brings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that country <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> livers, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> 8l. 15s. sterling The European Companies purchase three millions five hundred thousand weight of this commodity.</NOTE>.— In Constantinople alone, the consumption is said to amount to more than what is expended for wine in Paris.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="047837_0022_10249D33A3B432A0"/>IT was long after coffee had been an article of Commerce, that Europeans, were able to obtain, or cultivate the plant, as the berry was exported dry, and unfit for propagation.</P>
<P>IT has been said, that a Frenchman near <HI>Dijon</HI> in France, was the first person who made the ex∣periment with success, about the year 1670: the Trees raised from the seeds he had sown produced berries, but they were tasteless and insipid; and served for no other purpose, than for his amuse∣ment.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to BOERHAAVE's account, a Dutch Governor was the first person who produced fresh berries from Mocha, and planted them in <HI>Batavia</HI>; and in the year 1690 sent a plant from thence to Amsterdam; which came to maturity, and produ∣ced those berries, which have since furnished all that is now cultivated in the West-Indies.</P>
<P>IN 1714 a plant from the garden of Amsterdam was sent by the Magistrates, as a present to LEW∣IS the XIVth, which was placed in the garden at Marli.</P>
<P>In 1718 the Dutch began to cultivate Coffee in Surinam; in 1727 the French began to cultivate it in Martinico; and in 1728 the English be∣gan to cultivate it in Jamaica.</P>
<P>THE first plant in Jamaica, was introduced by Sir NICHOLAS LAWS, and planted at Townwell Estate, now called Temple Hall, belonging to Mr. LUTTRELL.—How its propagation has been extended since those periods, in the West Indies, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o well known to require recital here.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="047837_0023_10249D3526C235F0"/>SOME writers imagine that there are several sorts of Coffee<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE>; but the difference <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> only from the soil, cultivation, and curing, and not from any difference in the species.</P>
<P>IF the Coffee in our West India Islands be planted in a dry soil, and in a warm situation; if after the trees have acquired a certain age, the ripe berries be collected with care and cleanliness, which will be small when dry, like those which come from Arabia; and if they are kept a proper time be∣fore they are used, this Coffee will have flavour and excellence equal to the best that is imported from Mocha.</P>
<P>BUT the time and labour necessary to produce Coffee of the best quality have discouraged our Planters from raising it at much expence; because, until lately, it has been subject to a precarious, or losing market. Therefore quantity, and large berries, the produce of young trees, lux<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt soil, and little attention, has turned to better account than quality.</P>
<P>AFTER Coffee has received all the excellence it can from the Planter, it is a matter of great con∣sequence, that proper care be taken in shipping it for Europe: it should not be put into parts of the vessel where it may be injured by dampness, or by the effluvia of other freight. Coffee berries are remark∣ably disposed to imbibe exhalations from other bodies, and thereby acquire an advantageous, and disagreeable flavour. Rum placed near to Coffee, will in a short time so impregnate the berries as to injure their flavour. It is said, that a few bags of pepper on board a ship from India, some years since spoiled a whole cargo of Coffee<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Miller.</HI></NOTE>. The French are more attentive in this respect than the
<PB N="25" REF="047837_0024_10249D36A899AD40"/>English; and indeed, they omit nothing that can give their Coffee any advantage. But if their Coffee be superior to ours, it is the effect of more encouragement. The industry and genius of the French Coffee Planters, have been cherished; ours have been restricted by a duty, which prevented the consumption of the article. Thus the spirit of cultivation has been checked, improvement retarded, and consequently the pro∣duce not brought to perfection.</P>

<P>THE intention of torrefaction, is not only to make it deliver those principles and make them soluble in water, but to give it a property it does not possess in the natural state of the berry.</P>
<P>BY the action of fire, its leguminous taste, and the aqueous part of its mucilage are destroyed; its saline properties are created, and disengaged, and its oil is rendered empyreumatic.—From thence arises the pungent smell, and exhilirating fla∣vour, not found in its natural state.</P>
<P>ANIMAL oils are changed by fire in the same manner in broiled meats and acquire that grate∣ful odour, so exciting to weak appetites.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="047837_0025_10249D39CD3D9660"/>IMITATIONS of Coffee have been procured from roasted beans, peas, wheat, and rye with al∣monds; but the delicacy of the oil in Coffee, which the fire, in roasting, converts into its peculiar empyreuma, is not to be equalled.</P>
<P>THE roasting of the berry to a proper degree, requires great nicety: DU FOUR remarks, that its virtue and agreeableness depend on it, and that both are often injured in the ordinary method. BERNIER says, when he was at <HI>Cairo,</HI> where it is so much drank, he was assured by the best judges, that there were only two people in that great City, in the public way, who understood the preparing it in perfection.</P>
<P>IF it is under-done, its virtues will not be im∣parted; and in use, it will load and oppress the stomach:—If it is over-done, it will yield a flat, burnt, and bitter taste; its virtues will be destroy∣ed; and in use it will heat the body and act as an astringent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"<HI>Cetera bonitas Caovae prac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ipue dependet a cur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sa &amp; enquisita<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ione.</HI>" RAY.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE closer it is confined at the time of roasting and till used, the better will its volatile pungency, flavour and virtues, be perserved.</P>
<P>FOURTEEN pounds weight of raw Coffee, is generally reduced at the public roasting houses, to eleven pounds by the roasting; for which the Dea∣ler pays seven pence halfpenny; at the rate of five shillings for every hundred weight <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In London.</NOTE>. But the roasting ought to be regulated by the age, and quality of the Coffee, and by nicer rules than the appearance of the fumes, and such as are usually practised; therefore the reduction must conse∣quently vary, and no exact standard can be ascer∣tained.
<PB N="27" REF="047837_0026_10249D3CC9473E80"/>Besides, by mixing different sorts of Coffee together, that require different degrees of heat and roasting, Coffee has seldom all the advanta∣ges it is capable of receiving, to make it delicate, grateful, and pleasant. This indeed can be ef∣fected no way so well, as by people who have it roasted in their own houses, to their own taste, and fresh as they want it for use.</P>
<P>THE extraordinary influence that Coffee, judi∣ciously prepared, imparts to the stomach, from its tonic and invigorating qualities, is strongly ex∣emplified by the immediate effect produced on ta∣king it when the stomach is overloaded with food, or nauseated with surfeit, or debilitated by in∣temperance.</P>

<P>AMONG the many valuable qualities of Coffee, that of its being an antidote to the abuse of OPIUM, must not be considered as the least; for as man∣kind is not content with the wonderful efficacy derived from the prudent use of opium, the
<PB N="33" REF="047837_0032_10249D4B07CCA888"/>abuse of it is productive of many evils, that are only remediable by Coffee.</P>
<P>THE diseases generally brought on by a conti∣nued course of excessive doses of Opium, are ei∣ther loss of appetite, stupor, debility, loss of memory, melancholy, palsy, or dropsy:— and frequently the consequences of the necessary and temporary use of common doses of lau∣danum, are nausea, languor, giddiness of the head, cold sweats, head-ach, hysterics, and tre∣mor.</P>
<P>VARIOUS have been the attempts of physicians and chemists to correct their favourite Opium, and to improve and separate its useful from its hurtful properties<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Paracelsus Helmont, Silvius</HI> &amp;c.

<P>THERE never was, as far as we know, any preparation, or combination with Opium, from the time of King MITHRIDATES down to the days of Doctor JONES, that could be relied on to conteract the ill effects of its first operations, in many constitutions; and that would prevent those disagreeable after operations so much complained of in almost every subject and disease.</P>
<P>SUCH a preparation, would indeed be a large contribution to the Materia Medica, and would make a considerable figure in the practice of phy∣sic. But this may never be accomplished; it may
<PB N="34" REF="047837_0033_10249D4D8A39F738"/>not be in nature;—the defect may be the inherent imperfection of the vegetable, and inseparable from it; for as we find in the moral world, the brightest virtues may be shaded with alloy;—if so, it will yet be some consolation, that we are able to remove those ills which we cannot pre∣vent.</P>
<P>EVERY Author who mentions Coffee, allows that it possesses singular power in counteracting the hypnotic, or sleepy effects of Opium; this is the only virtue assigned to it, in regard to Opium: as if the influence which Coffee exerts on the system, to produce that effect, could be directed to no pur∣pose, when these contradictions were not em∣ployed in opposition, to rob each other of their at∣tributes.</P>
<P>CONFIRMED by many years observation, I be∣lieve that Coffee besides being the best corrector of Opium, is the best medicine to remove those ills which it produces, that has yet been discover∣ed; and that the operations of common doses of Opium, may be checked or extended, and may be graduated by it at pleasure.</P>
<P>THE heaviness, head ach, giddiness, sickness, and nervous affections, which attack the patient in the morning who has taken an opiate at night, are agreeably removed by a cup or two of strong Coffee.</P>
<P>In Military hospitals in hot climates, recourse is often had to large and repeated doses of Opium; from which I have frequently observed, that the retention of the stomach of the patient, has been greatly injured; the secretion of urine impeded, or the bladder affected by a paralysis:—even these effects have been speedily removed, by a few cups of strong Coffee</P>

<P>I HAVE singled out SIMON PAULLI from among the adversaries of Coffee, for no other motive, than to shew from what tales so learned a man confesses he supports a notion, that Coffee (like Tea to the Chinese) acted as a great drier to the <HI>Persians,</HI> and abated aphrodisiacal warmth. This opinion has been since received, and propagated from him, as he received and propagated it from its fabulous origin. The facts have been refuted by DU FOUR, and many travellers.—Sir THOMAS HERBERT, who was several years in the East, tells us that the Persians have a different opinion of Coffee:—"They say that Coffee comforts the brain, expels melancholy and sleep, purges choler, lightens the spirits, and begets an excellent concoction, and by custom, becomes de∣licious. But all these virtues do not conciliate their liking of it so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, as the romantic no∣tion, that it was first invented and brewed by the <HI>Angel</HI> GABRIEL, to restore MAHOMET'S decayed moisture, which it did effectuality<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Setting aside the hyperbolical part of this Persian opinion, here is at least a tradition that this not or was used in Arabia in the time of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> whose flight from <HI>Mecca</HI> was in the year 622. This was eight centuries and a half antecedent to the learned <HI>Egyptian Doc∣tor</HI>'s Treatise in defence of Coffee; which is said to have been written in the year 1470; the copy of which, as has been mention∣ed, is in the King of France's library. All the ancient nations who made much use of the <HI>Legumina</HI> in their diet, prepared many of them by torefaction and it is most probable that the Arabians were acquainted with the art of preparing a liquor, from the parched or roasted berries of a tree that was indigenous among them, prior to its use in Egypt and Persia, or in any of the neighbouring Countries. It is a question, though of more curiosity than im∣portance, whether the drin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> might not have had its name from <HI>Cufa</HI> or <HI>Caffa,</HI> a city in Arabia Felix? The Arabic <HI>Ban</HI> (the Coffee berry) corresponds with our <HI>Bean,</HI> and is probably its etymon. Perhaps the Greek, <HI>BUNT,</HI> "<HI>Barley sleeped in water,</HI>" Anglice, <HI>Malt,</HI> may be traced from the Arabic <HI>Buna.</HI></NOTE>."</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="047837_0037_10249D5624A0E078"/>MANY have been the dogmas concerning Cof∣fee: some Authors allege that it is <HI>dry,</HI> and therefore good for the gross and phlegmatic, but hurtful to lean people; some contend that it is <HI>cold,</HI> and therefore good for sanguine, bilious, and hot constitutions; others that it is <HI>hot,</HI> and there∣fore bad for the sanguine and bilious, but good for cold constitutions. Some assure us, that it acts only as a <HI>sedative</HI>; others, that it acts only as a <HI>stimulant.</HI> With such disputants there is no entering the lists: Medical science disclaims their pretensions, as creations of the imagination; and transfers their contest for decision, to a Synod of Turkish Priests.</P>
<P>I AM aware that there are others, who are de∣cisively of opinion, that Coffee is injurious "in thin habits and bilious temperaments; in melan∣cholic and hypochondriacal disorders, and to per∣sons subject to haemorrhages."—WILLIS and CHEYNE, as well as LEWIS, were in some degree of this opinion.</P>
<P>In haemorrhages, particularly in those of the pulmonic and uterine kind, the interdiction of Coffee is every where justly admitted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Yet Dr. <HI>Percival</HI> says it is "powerfully sedative." vol. I. p.</NOTE>; but the other exceptions however they may have been taken up, and asserted in England, where the confined use of Coffee has scarcely afforded a
<PB N="39" REF="047837_0038_10249D5915FD5948"/>fair opportunity to settle such a point, will be dis∣puted in countries where it is in general use. Let me add also that the result of my own obser∣vations in those countries, is evidence against those exceptions; and it is confirmed by every information I have obtained, from medical people resident in Constantinople, and other parts of the Turkish Empire.</P>
<P>LET us examine this arbitary restriction to the use of Coffee, and see what justice there is in the grounds on which it has been imposed, and what reason there is in having submitted to it.</P>
<P>IN regard to "thin habits," where there is no disease, I can say but little; being acquainted with no theory that militates against the pru∣dent use of Coffee in the alimentary way; nor why it should not be as harmless, to such habits, as to those who are blessed with the greatest obesity and rotundity of figure.</P>
<P>In "bilious temperaments," facts and experi∣ence must determine. Bilious temperaments are surely no where so common as in hot cli∣mates; and in those very countries, Coffee is cer∣tainly most used. There Coffee is found to tem∣per and soften the acrimony of the bile, and is remarkably serviceable in the cholorea mor∣bus. It is observed in bilious habits that the stomach receives nothing more agreeably than Coffee; and that the nausea and inclination to vomit, which often accompany bilious complaints, are taken away by Coffee. In the jaundice, it is used with great success, and in obstructions of the liver.</P>
<P>To the opinion that Coffee is hurtful in "me∣lancholic and hypochondriacal disorders," a mul∣titude of opinions may be opposed; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> well known power in removing visceral obstru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ns,

<P>IF it be demanded, what general description of people should abstain from the use of Coffee? as it seems with some people to be necessary for the rightly understanding of its virtues, to have something said against it, I must answer that I know of none. Individuals possessing pe∣culiar nervous sensibility, and such as are sub∣ject to feverish irritability, should abstain from all stimulating liquors; therefore, from Coffee.— Those who from their own proper experience, find it does not agree with them, can hardly stand in need of this injunction<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"Je seay qu'il se <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rouve indifferemment entre les bilicux, les san∣guins, les pit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iteux, &amp; les melancholiques, des personnes a qui il fait du b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en, &amp; d'autres a qui il fait du mal; c'est pou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> qu'il soit vray qu'il y aye peu d'alimens ny de medicamens <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e generalment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> que le <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>." <HI>De Blegny.</HI> p. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is well known, that there are some habits which cannot endure any thing that increases the sensibility of the nerves; and others that are af∣fected by particular stimulants. A cup of strong Coffee will cause some people to have a tremor of the band:—BOYLE says, it acted as an eme∣tic with one person; others will be heated or be kept from sleeping by it. Tea, Cham∣pagne wine, and many other things, will produce similar effects. It was on this account that SLARE, and some others have confounded this excess of nervous sensibility, with the palsy,

<P>But the history of particular cases, sometimes serves but to prove, that mankind are not all or∣ganized alike; and that the sympathy of one, and the antipathy of another, ought by no means to render useless, that infinite variety which per∣vades

<P>IT has long been a custom with many people a∣mong us, to add mustard to their Coffee: mustard, or aromatics may with great propriety be added in flatulent, lauguid, and scorbutic constitutions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>De Bleg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mmends Coffee stron<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly in the scurvy <HI>Du Four</HI> says the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, are used <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE>; and particularly by invalids, and in such ca∣ses, where warmth or stimulus is required.</P>

Milk and sugar without the aromatics, are generally used with it in Europe, America, and the West India Islands, ex∣cept when taken after dinner; then the method of the French is commonly followed, and the milk is omitted.</P>
<P>A CUP or two thus taken after dinner without cream or milk, promotes digestion, and has been found very serviceable to those who are habitually costive. If a draught of water is taken before Coffee, according to the Eastern custom, it gives it a tendency to act as an aperient.</P>
<P>THUS for the properties and medicinal effects of Coffee have been considered; and as the be∣verage made from it, contains all the essential vir∣tues of the berry, which united, are most proper for dietetic purposes, I have not entered into any discussion of its component parts separately, nor of the distilled water, syrup, oil, and other simple preparations which have been made from the ber∣ry; for I do not believe, that, those preparations
<PB N="43" REF="047837_0042_10249D618602A688"/>possess any properties deserving particular notice; but that we are indebted to the virtues we derive from Coffee, to the total derangement of its na∣tural state, by the process it undergoes in roast∣ing, from the fire.</P>
<P>THE mode of preparing this beverage for com∣mon use, differs in different countries, principal∣ly as to the additions made to it.—But though that is generally understood, and that taste, constitu∣tion, the quality of the Coffee, and the quantity intended to be drank, must be consulted, in re∣gard to the proportion of Coffee, to the water in making it—yet there is one material point, the importance of which is not so well understood, and which admits of no deviation.</P>
<P>THE preservation of the virtues of the Coffee, as has been said, depends on carefully confining it after it has been roasted; and not powdering it until the time of using it; that the volatile and aethereal principles, generated by the fire, may not escape. But all this will signify nothing, and the best materials will be useless, unless this im∣portant admonition is strictly attended to: that af∣ter the liquor is made, <HI>it should be bright and clear, and entirely exempt from the least cloudiness or foul appearance, from a suspension of any of the particles of the substance of the Coffee.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is scarcely any vegetable infusion, or decoction, whose effects differ from its gross origin, more than that of which we are speaking. Coffee taken in substance, causes oppression at the sto∣mach, heat, nausea, and indigestion: conse∣quently a continued use of a decoction of it, in which any quantity of its substance is contained, besides being disgusting to the palate, must tend to produce the same indispositions. The residuum
<PB N="44" REF="047837_0043_10249D63C10A4BE0"/>of the roasted berry, after its virtues are extracted from it, is little more than an earthly calx, and must therefore be pernicious.</P>
<P>THE want of attention to this circumstance, I make no doubt, has been the cause of many of the complaints against<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Coffee, and of the aversion which some people have from it; and it is from this consideration that I have discontinued to re∣commend the preparing of Coffee with milk in∣stead of water, or of adding the milk to it on the fire, as directed by Dr. FOTHERGILL; for the tenacity of milk impedes that precipitation which is necessary for the purity of the liquor, and should therefore not be added until after the cla∣rification of it is completed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is not to Coffee alone that this reflexion is confined; every article we use as a diluter, demands the same attention.

<P>IF a knowledge of the principles of Coffee, founded on examination and various experiments, added to abservations made on the extensive and indiscriminate use of it, cannot authorise us to attribute to it any particular circumstance un∣friendly to the human frame;—if the unerring test of experience has confirmed its utility, in many countries, not exclusively productive of those in∣conveniences, habits, and diseases, for which its peculiar properties seem most applicable;—let those properties be duly considered; and let us reflect on the state of our atmosphere; the food, and modes of life of the inhabitants, so injurious to youth and beauty, filling the large towns and cities which chronical infirmities; and I think it will be evident what advantages will result from the general use of Coffee in England, as an arti∣cle of diet, from the comforts of which the poor are not excluded, and to what purposes it may of∣ten be employed, as a safe and powerful medi∣cine.</P>
