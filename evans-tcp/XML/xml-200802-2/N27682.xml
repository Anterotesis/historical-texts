<HEAD>Discourse.</HEAD>
<P>IT is better to go to the house of mourn∣ing than to the house of feasting, is the observation of one, who was well acquainted with human na∣ture, and capable of giving excellent directions for the conduct of human life. That this is such an house, appears from the sadness of every counte∣nance, proceeding from real sorrow of heart and the symbols of mourning conspicuous to every eye. To suggest some seasonable thoughts, on this mournful occasion, is the business of the speaker; and that he may be better able to arrange his ideas and fix the attention of his hearers, he will at∣tempt a comparison between the greatest man in the East and the greatest man in the West, whose death is this day universally lamented, and to per∣petuate the remembrance of his virtues thousands, nay millions, are assembled.</P>
<P>THE passage I shall select from the sacred vol∣ume for my text, you may find in
<Q><BIBL><HI>DEUTERONONY 34 Chap. part of the 5.7.8. verses.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Moses the servant of the Lord died. Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died. His eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. And the children of Israel wept for Moses.</P></Q></P>
<P>SO died Moses at an advanced period, without feeling those decays, which have been the portion of the human kind in every age: So died WASH∣INGTON in the full possession of his mental pow∣ers,
<PB N="4" REF="036897_0004_100B2ECEE766CEA8"/>
and without any material decay in his senses or his limbs, at an age, when such an exemption could hardly be expected. I do not know that there was any thing miraculous in either. They both, early in life, adopted such principles and pursued such a course as had a direct tendency to protract life, as far as within the reach of human ability, and to prevent the natural decays of age.</P>
<P>THEY were both favoured with good natural constitutions; they were both temperate in all things; they were both abundant in labours; they were both men of piety and unspotted virtue; and of consequence enjoyed easy and quiet minds, without anxiety and without vexation; they both went to the grave in peace.</P>
<P>BUT they did not resemble each other more in their deaths, than they did in their lives. They were both born for public life, they filled impor∣tant stations with dignity to themselves and ad∣vantage to mankind. We shall descend to a few particulars in which the resemblance appears.</P>
<P>MOSES was a man of great modesty and exceed∣ingly diffident of his own abilities to fill the station to which he was called. He declined the arduous task assigned him, as far as prudence and submis∣sion to unerring Wisdom would permit. Had he gone any farther, his modesty would have been converted into obstinacy.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON was equally diffident and distrust∣ful of his qualifications for the important work to which he was called. It was impossible for him to be without his fears, that the spirit of lib∣erty, which pervaded all orders of men, would
<PB N="5" REF="036897_0005_100B2ED06C782F90"/>
decline, if not die, and that the people would grow weary of suffering and wish to return to their former state. Success was what he could not command, how well soever he might deserve it. If he had failed at an early period, the most ignominious death must have been his portion. If he had had an hundred lives, justice, his ene∣mies would have said, demanded them all. Noth∣ing short of the unanimous voice of the Congress, of the army, and the people, could have drawn him from his beloved retirement. He made up his mind on the most mature consideration, and came forth, determined to deliver his brethren from their oppressions and their fears, or perish in the attempt. The joy expressed at his acceptance of the command of our armies, was nearly equal to the grief that has been manifested at his death.</P>
<P>IF he had been appointed like Moses immediately by Heaven, we could not have put much greater confidence in him. Unanimity was the conse∣quence; unanimity saved us. It is true, the <HI>Farm∣er's</HI> maxim, uttered at an early period, was in eve∣ry mouth: <HI>"United we stand, divided we fall."</HI> But this maxim would have had but little effect, if we had not had a leader to give it force.</P>
<P>MOSES was a man of great prudence.</P>
<P>HE was cool in his temper, deliberate in his be∣haviour, a rash word seldom, if ever, proceeded from his lips; nor did the want of foresight and dis∣cretion plunge him into difficulties and embarrass∣ments to such a degree, as to wound his reputation and prevent success.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="036897_0006_100B2ED29100B110"/>WASHINGTON had the most important qualifi∣cation of an able general, a wise discernment be∣twixt things difficult and impracticable. To shrink from the former is weakness, to attempt the latter madness. Such was his wisdom of pre∣vention, he had but little occasion for that of rem∣edy. His uncommon sobriety, unremitted atten∣tion, and continual activity, preserved him from hurtful errors and mistakes. He lived not a mo∣ment without thought, nor was any thing put off till to-morrow that could be done to-day. Though he heard every thing, yet this did not prevent his seeing every thing, so far as circumstances would permit. He always considered the eye of the gen∣eral more influential than his words. Where danger was most imminent, and his presence most needed, there his exertions were most conspicuous. As he never avoided the post of danger, he led others to consider it a post of honour. Great prudence was necessary to form a union in the American army, composed, as it was, of raw, un∣disciplined troops, drawn from different quarters, possessed of different principles, habits and preju∣dices, and all in a great degree void of that spirit of subordination absolutely necessary in an army. These difficulties were all surmounted, and nearly as much harmony was found in the American as in the British camp, without that loss of spirit, that is often, if not always, found in those who have been drilled to the service by the severest dis∣cipline. The Americans, taken from the fields of freedom, could not bear that severity of disci∣pline frequently found in veteran armies. Our
<PB N="7" REF="036897_0007_100B2ED41539F1D8"/>
prudent leader conformed to their humours and their habits, so far as public safety would permit, and by so doing he was obeyed more from affec∣tion than fear.</P>
<P>MOSES was a man of fortitude. His courage never forsook him, though his situation was often distressing and his prospect gloomy. He was early convinced there was no safety but in perseverance. To look back was death or worse.</P>
<P>THE courage of the American chief was never doubted by friend or foe. If it had been, it would totally have disqualified him for his place. The want of personal bravery is a weakness in a gene∣ral not to be forgiven. WASHINGTON on all oc∣casions had the perfect command of himself. He never fled when duty called him to pursue, nor did he quit the ground as long as any hope of vic∣tory remained. During the first stages of the con∣test, his courage and skill were more conspicuous in his retreats than in his victories. These were conducted in such manner, that the enemy profit∣ed but little by the victories they won and the advantages they gained. A defensive mode of war he adopted, as being the only mode the Americans were able to pursue, and which he was well assur∣ed would lead to conquest in the end. It is time and service that makes soldiers; it is danger that creates courage; it is hardship that makes men hardy. The American army must grow better with time, the British decay. The Americans will conquer if they are not conquered, was his maxim.</P>
<P>THE patriotism of the Jewish lawgiver equalled his fortitude. His patriotism was of the virtuous
<PB N="8" REF="036897_0008_100ADD0F1A1108E0"/>
kind. It was the first wish of the Jewish leader to deliver his brethren from oppression and slavery. Avarice and ambition were not in his heart, nor was the desire of making conquests, like some an∣cient and modern republics, the ruling passion of his mind. Could he see his friends and compan∣ions in the possession of freedom, he was content. As to himself, while he dwelt in Pharaoh's court he had nothing to endure, nor any thing to fear. He was too important to be insulted or neglected; and we know of no reason that he had to dread a change of circumstances: "But Moses chose rath∣er to suffer affliction with the people of God, than enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season." We commend his choice, and do most sincerely wish that such patriots may increase in the old world and in the new.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON was not inferior to Moses in this amiable virtue. If ever there was a man in the world, who discovered a truly patriotic spirit, who spent life for the good of his country and coun∣trymen, who exposed his health, hazarded his life, and every thing dear to him of a temporal nature, WASHINGTON was the man. History furnishes no instance of a man, who went beyond him in a truly public and patriotic spirit. Possessed of an ample fortune, he might have lived much at his ease. Books, a few select friends, and rural em∣ployments, in which his soul delighted, would have made him as happy as the present state of things would permit; but he chose rather to risk his fortune with that of his brethren, than enjoy the pleasures his circumstances afforded him.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="036897_0009_100B2ED969DA7E28"/>MOSES was a man of great humanity. This ap∣pears from the general tenor of his conduct. If in some instances there is the appearance of severity, it is owing to necessity or peculiar circumstances, and not to a cruel disposition. Time will not per∣mit me to descend to particulars.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON was equally humane. He might have obtained more glory in the opinion of some, if he had been more lavish of human blood. He nev∣er exposed his men to danger any farther than ne∣cessity required, or there was an hopeful prospect of obtaining some permanent advantage. Less blood, perhaps, was never shed in a war so complicated, so lengthy, and for the most part carried on against superior numbers. It was his humanity that ena∣bled him to secure the affections of the army, be∣yond what is common. This affection, principally, held the army together during certain periods of suffering all the pains of hunger, cold, nakedness, and incapacity of making any great resistance, if the enemy had known their weakness, and been disposed to attack them with their whole force. His pathetic entreaties more than once detain∣ed the men in camp after their enlistments were expired. They could not forsake their general, who was willing to spend and be spent for the good of the army and the happiness of his country.</P>
<P>MOSES was as much distinguished for his meek∣ness, as for any other quality of his mind. Our children are not badly instructed, when in their infancy or early childhood, they are taught that MOSES excelled all in this amiable disposition.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="036897_0010_100B2EDC26B40908"/>WASHINGTON in this respect was not inferior to Moses. Passions he had, and they, who have been best acquainted with him, say they were strong. This we can easily believe, for such are always found in strong minds. It was the first lesson of his life, to reduce them to reason. He effected it; and this paved the way to promotion, and pre∣pared him to take the command of his brethren. When his spirit was stirred within him and his heart waxed hot, the singer of silence rested on his lips. He early learnt what the most passionate are willing to acknowledge, that nothing is well done in anger, that rashness in action lays a foun∣dation for repentance at leisure. If he was not so decisive as some; by accustoming himself always to think, he made fewer mistakes than others. His foresight and attention prevented the necessity of doing things twice in order to be wise.</P>
<P>MOSES was as much distinguished in the cab∣inet, as in the field. He was the greatest law∣giver, the world had ever seen. He formed a re∣public under which the people for a long time en∣joyed an uncommon share of liberty and safety, and which might have continued much longer than it did, if the wantonness of some and the wickedness of others had not led them to wish for a change.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON was as much respected at the head of our councils, as he had been at the head of our armies. As he had been first in war, so he was first in peace. The people, though divided in every thing else, united in choosing him their pres∣ident, and in such manner as was seldom if ever
<PB N="11" REF="036897_0011_100B2EDDAB792A68"/>
known before, and the like is hardly to be expect∣ed again. Among many men scattered over an immense tract of country, possessing different views, interests, and habits, there was but one mind. The voice of millions was considered by our great friend and patron as the voice of God, and he consented to take the helm when the ship was supposed to be in great danger. His prudence, patience, and fortitude lessened, if it did not ex∣terminate, the spirit of party; and all orders uni∣ted for the benefit of the republic. Many had supposed, during the contest, that when the rod that had been held over us, was removed, our lot would be that of the Grecian states, who waged perpetual war with each other. The Federal Con∣stitution laid a foundation for perpetual union. WASHINGTON was at the head, when it was fram∣ed; and the commencement of its administration was committed to his hands, and he continued in office longer than he intended, because he was de∣termined not to quit the helm in a storm. The line he adopted, when it was extremely difficult to determine what course it was best to pursue, has (under Providence) saved this nation from the calamities of a dreadful war, and enabled us to enjoy a great share of peace, and as large a portion of temporal prosperity as the world has ever seen.</P>
<P>WHEN war broke out in Europe, our polit∣ical Father thought it best that America should observe the line of neutrality. By taking an ac∣tive part, we had every thing to lose and nothing to gain. The voice of the people, if I mistake not, was for war; they have since been convinced
<PB N="12" REF="036897_0012_100B2EDFEC005BC8"/>
of their mistake. If we had engaged, we should probably have lost all that we had gained, and both our circumstances and prospects would have been infinitely worse, than they were before the revolu∣tion began. The war has not yet ended, and we cannot say how or when it will. The principles that were first adopted by the French revolution∣ists appear to be nearly abandoned by those now in power, and all hope of establishing a free repub∣lic is at an end. Let them adopt what form they may, military despotism must continue for some length of time. By observing the line of neutral∣ity, we have suffered; but nothing, it is probable, to what we should have done, if we had been weak enough to have engaged in war. The enmi∣ty between the two great rival powers has been the source of nearly all our sufferings; but they have not been so great, as they would have been, if we had joined with one side or the other. They have divided the people, it is true, but the probability is, that we shall soon be on pretty good terms with both. We have reason to hope that our Envoys will be well received; if not, the good we have already received from the appoint∣ment is more than a balance for the expense.</P>
<P>ONE thing, that I cannot forbear mentioning, that tends much to exalt the character of our late beloved President, is, the impartial world, that have been acquainted with his public movements of every kind, and have had opportunity to ex∣amine all his motives, have not in a single instance, that I recollect, condemned his conduct; and I doubt not, but that we shall hear, that his death is considered as a loss to the human race.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="036897_0013_100B2EE20AA5E038"/>MOSES was a man of piety, religion and moral∣ity. And so was WASHINGTON.</P>
<P>HE was never heard vauntingly to say, My wis∣dom, my courage, my zeal, have vanquished all my enemies. My arm hath gotten me the victory.</P>
<P>ON the other hand; My God, my officers, my soldiers, the good sense and firm conduct of my fellow-citizens, in the cabinet and in the field, have crowned my labours with some success, was the language of his heart and his lips. He was no sophist, nor atheist. If he had been, his exam∣ple might have done infinite harm; it might have given a tone to the faith and manners of the na∣tion. The prevalence of infidelity in Europe, we have reason to hope, will be followed with some happy consequences. It has nearly extirpated that spirit of credulity and superstition which for a long time disgraced the Christian religion and threatned its total destruction. In plucking up the tares, in popish countries, the wheat has been plucked up with them. The tares were so numerous and so rank, that this could not be well avoided. Thanks to Heaven! the good seed is not lost, the ground remains, and we are not without hope, that it may be prepared in such manner, that when the good seed is sown, it shall bring forth an hundred fold. If the ways of Heaven are often dark and unsearchable, one thing is certain, the general good is invariably pursued.</P>
<P>IN some things, the Jewish lawgiver and the American chief bore but little resemblance. Moses had only to follow the directions of an infallible Guide. His path was so plainly marked by Heaven,
<PB N="14" REF="036897_0014_100B2EE4444809F0"/>
that it was nearly impossible for him to mistake it. Not so with our patron and friend: he was obli∣ged to keep his invention always upon the rack. Not a moment was allowed him for relaxation and repose beyond what nature absolutely requir∣ed. He was as thoughtful on the day of victory as on the day of defeat. Orders, it is true, he often received, but of necessity they must be often discretionary, especially as to ways and means of carrying them into execution. He might find himself under a necessity of disregarding them; to do this, in his responsible situation, might be as painful to him, as it was to our Envoys in France when they were negotiating a peace with Britain. It is true, he was allowed to depart from orders, as circumstances or imperious necessity demanded; but to be always ready to take the advantage of circumstances, required continual attention.</P>
<P>THIS one thing, the taking advantage of cir∣cumstances, distinguishes the character of a general more, perhaps, than any other that can be named. Without a good share of prudence of this kind, the most brilliant talents, in other respects, will never command success.</P>
<P>MOSES was constantly aided by miracles. The elements were at his command, the heavens fought in his favour. WASHINGTON had no di∣rect assurance from the Deity, that he would lead him on to victory, and crown his labours with success. He believed his cause to be just, but this afforded him no absolute security against disap∣pointments. If he had owned the <HI>box</HI> early in life, that he returned to the Donor at his death, this would have convinced him, if conviction was
<PB N="15" REF="036897_0015_100B2EE5ED693E80"/>
wanted, that the most prudent, patriotic and brave, may be unfortunate, and suffer an ignominious death. He never expected that miracles would be wrought in his favour. He could not say as Moses did, when hemmed in on every side, <HI>Stand still and see the salvation of God.</HI> At the same time, he and we, in a thousand instances, have noticed the hand of Heaven visibly displayed in our favour. My time will not allow me to descend to particu∣lar instances, that made a deep impression at the moment, on the minds of such as then lived, and never will be forgotten.</P>
<P>THE gift, or rather loan of such a man, in our particular circumstances, was a favour beyond es∣timation. If we had been allowed to search the world, one more suitable to the exigencies of the times, we have good reason to believe, could not have been found. That he was continued so long, and made so useful to the last day of his life, de∣mands our warmest gratitude. Though it was never our wish, that he should pass through a sec∣ond childhood, and spend the last of life in a use∣less way, bereft of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and of sense; yet his re∣moval at the present period is a loss, that we have great reason to lament. The conduct of the Uni∣ted States this day evinces beyond contradiction, that they are sensible of the loss they have sustained. Were he, who wept at the grave of Lazarus, with us at the present moment, he would undoubtedly mingle his tears with ours. We commend rulers and people for devoting this day to mourning. Our public conduct has a tendency to wipe off the reproach that has been frequently cast on republics, <HI>that they are ungrateful.</HI> Pecuniary rewards for his
<PB N="16" REF="036897_0016_100B2EE78959B8F8"/>
services he would never receive. To perpetuate the memory of his virtues, is all the reward we are allowed to give. To benefit the deceased we do not expect; he is gone beyond our reach. To promote the happiness of the living, the rising generation in particular, and the children yet un∣born, is what we have in view. We say to all, this day, who wish to live beloved and die lament∣ed, <HI>"Go and do likewise."</HI></P>
<P>ALL orders of men may in some degree be ben∣efited by his example, let their sphere of life be what it may. He was as exemplary in private life as he was in public. His example has made that line of life honorable, which, as we expect to become a great and flourishing people must be at∣tended to beyond all others. Commerce we shall have, but commerce in such a country as this, without agriculture, can never be gainful. A price is put into our hands, God grant that we may have wisdom to improve it.</P>
<P>Let us all take the warning that is given us. In a short time we shall all be upon a level. As we wish to be lamented when dead, it behoves us to be useful while living. To prepare for our passage is the busi∣ness of time. <HI>Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord, they rest from their labours and their works do follow them.</HI></P>
