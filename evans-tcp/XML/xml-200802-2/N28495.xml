<Q><BIBL><HI>2 CHRON. XXIV, 15, 16.</HI></BIBL>
<P>But <HI>JEHOIADA</HI> waxed old, and was full of Days when he died—And they buried him in the City of David among the Kings, because he had done <HI>GOOD</HI> in <HI>ISRAEL,</HI> both towards GOD, and towards his House.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE excellent person who is the subject of our text, was one who truly adorned his sta∣tion by his eminent services. Being high-priest of the Jews, it was doubtless under his protec∣tion that young JOASH was concealed in the temple six years, when ATHALIAH cut off all the rest of the seed royal. It was through his
<PB N="4" REF="037963_0003_10102DEDE277DA40"/>
instrumentality that Judah was recovered from the tyranny and idolatry of <HI>"that wicked woman,"</HI> and the prince set upon the throne of his ancestors. He continued through life to be the chief counsellor and prime minister of the king, <HI>"who did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all the days of</HI> JEHOIADA <HI>the priest".</HI> And it was he who aided his sovereign in repairing the house of GOD, and restoring the temple worship. Thus we see why it is said of him, that "HE DID GOOD IN ISRAEL."</P>
<P>FOR this he obtained at his death an honor which was refused to JOASH himself. For after the death of the high-priest, this prince turned aside to idolatry, and slew the sons of his bene∣factor; for which he was slain by his own ser∣vants, and buried in the city of David, but <HI>"not in the sepulchres of the kings."</HI> Where∣as when JEHOIADA died, old and full of days, <HI>"they buried him in the city of David, among the kings;"</HI> treating him with a respect similar to that which was conferred on good HEZEKIAH, who, when he slept with his fathers, was buried <HI>"in the chief of the sepulchres of the sons of</HI> DAVID; <HI>and all Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death."</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="037963_0004_10102DF04F5A38B8"/>HENCE it appears to be agreeable to the will of GOD, that his distinguished servants, whom he has been pleased to employ in doing much good, should be honored at their death, by having some suitable respect paid to their me∣mory.</P>
<P>AFTER I have shewn what respect is to be paid to the memory of eminent men; and the ground on which they are to be honored at their death; I shall direct your attention particularly to the occasion on which we are at present convened.</P>
<P>WE are, no doubt, to shew respect to the memory of the excellent of the earth, by mourning for them, after the example of JACOB's sons mourning for their father—of Judah and Jerusalem mourning for JOSIAH, and other instan∣ces of the same kind. This mourning, how∣ever, is not to be confined to inward and se∣cret grief; it is fit that this grief be expressed by some external tokens, such as visible badges of mourning, or funeral elegies; and that the remembrance of the person be perpetuated by some kind of records, or sepulchral monuments. This is the way in which we manifest our sorrow
<PB N="6" REF="037963_0005_10102DF1F9B5DD60"/>
and respect for our private friends or relatives deceased: JACOB erected a pillar for his RACHEL, called <HI>"The pillar of Rachel's grave;"</HI> and DAVID bewailed his ABSALOM, saying, <HI>"O my son Absalom! my son, my son Absalom! Would GOD I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!"</HI> And it is suitable, that in some such way we express our sorrow, and manifest our esteem for the faithful friends and benefactors of our country. Thus did DAVID and his people at the death of ABNER: They rent their clothes, girded themselves with sackcloth, and mourned before him. <HI>"The king followed the bier; he lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept."</HI> Undoubtedly, exter∣nal signs of mourning were not wanting at the threshing-floor of Atad, where JOSEPH and his company <HI>"mourned for</HI> JACOB <HI>seven days, with a great and very sore lamentation,"</HI> so that the Ca∣naanites took notice of it, and said, <HI>"This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians."</HI> On the death of SAUL and JONATHAN, DAVID wrote a very pathetic funeral elegy, which stands re∣corded in the second book of Samuel; and in the Chronicles we are told, that <HI>"All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for</HI> JOSIAH; that JERE∣MIAH <HI>lamented for him; and that the singing men,
<PB N="7" REF="037963_0006_10102DF38B91EA00"/>
and the singing women spake of</HI> JOSIAH <HI>in their la∣mentations to this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel; and behold they are written in the La∣mentations."</HI> Thus it appears, not only that it is agreeable to the will of GOD, that his eminent servants should be honored at their death; but likewise what kind of honor or respect is to be paid to their memory.</P>
<P>LET us, in the next place, attend to the ground on which this honour is to be conferred on such personages. It is because they are the servants of the great GOD, whom he has signalized by placing them in high stations, and employing them in important services to the church, or to the state. We are expressly told, that the reason why JEHOIADA had the honor of being buried among the kings was, <HI>"because he had done good in Israel, both towards GOD, and towards his house."</HI> When we pay respect to great men for their own sakes only, we rob GOD of his honor, and become guilty of a kind of idolatry. But when we regard them as the gifts of Heaven— as men whom GOD has qualified and raised up for eminent service, and bestowed on us as bles∣sings from his hand; the honor conferred on them, in this view, is consecrated to GOD, and
<PB N="8" REF="037963_0007_10102DF7E5EDE278"/>
ultimately redounds to his glory. Under this impression, we may give scope to our affec∣tions, and freely extol the virtues, and cele∣brate the praises of the men <HI>"whom the KING of kings hath delighted to honour."</HI></P>
<P>WHAT now calls your attention, as the special business of the day, is the tribute of respect that is due to the memory of our departed friend, and the friend of our country, the renowned WASH∣INGTON. It is, perhaps, beyond my power to inform this assembly on the subject, or to increase its esteem for the memory of this most excellent man. His character and his deeds are well known to all who are capable of knowing them. Yet in honor of the Father of our country, it is suitable, on this occasion, to express the sense which we entertain of the worth of this inestimable gift of Heaven, with which GOD has favored us so long, and which in the sovereign and wise dispensa∣tions of his providence, he has been pleased to recall.</P>
<P>WHETHER we consider this illustrious person as a warrior or a statesman, we cannot but admire the goodness of GOD in enduing him with tal∣ents so suitable to his station. His wisdom and
<PB N="9" REF="037963_0008_10102DFC032148E8"/>
prudence, his magnanimity, perseverance and fidelity, cannot fail to arrest our attention. In him we beheld greatness without pride, and hu∣mility without meanness. In him firmness and resolution were blended with gentleness and hu∣manity. Never was a Commander more loved by his soldiers, or more revered by his very en∣emies. Never did a man more fully possess the confidence of his fellow citizens, nor was ever one more highly esteemed both by his own coun∣try, and by foreign nations.</P>
<P>A MAN thus qualified, was a fit instrument in the hand of the GOD of armies and the Sovereign of the world, to be employed in accomplishing great and valuable purposes. What he has achieved, as well in the chair of state, as in the high places of the field, America has witnessed, and the world has been informed.</P>
<P>WHEN we were reduced to the necessity of de∣fending our lives, our liberty and our property, against one of the most powerful and warlike nations of Europe—when we had neither fleets nor disciplined armies—when our troops were without arms, ammunition or clothing—WASH∣INGTON,
<PB N="10" REF="037963_0009_1010210519257448"/>
at the call of his country, stepped forth and girded on the sword. He inspired our ar∣mies with confidence—taught them the use of arms, and led them to conquest. His skill in ma∣naging an inferior force against superior num∣bers; his prudence in avoiding a general action without a prospect of success; and his prompt∣ness in seizing the favorable moment of advan∣tageous combat, will be admired as long as history shall record the deeds of warriors.</P>
<P>THE effects of his military skill and prowess were the salvation of our country, and the free∣dom and independence of the American States.</P>
<P>AT the close of the war he laid down the sword, resigned his commission, and retired to the peaceful shades of Mount Vernon; where he hoped to end his days in quiet repose, free from the burden of public care. But, by the unanimous voice of his fellow citizens, he was yet twice called to the PRESIDENCY of the UNI∣TED STATES, and twice he obeyed the summons. The high approbation with which he executed this office, as well as the conspicuous part which he acted in the celebrated Congress that conduct∣ed us to independence, and in the Convention
<PB N="11" REF="037963_0010_10102E00A9F7AED0"/>
which framed our excellent constitution, are fully attested. None had it in his power to do so much towards reconciling the jarring in∣terests and sentiments of the different states, and stilling their political storms, as the man who not only possessed, but was universally esteemed to possess, the highest degree of wis∣dom and integrity, added to the most con∣summate prudence. To his management, therefore, in war and in peace, under the guid∣ance of a gracious Providence, it is in a great measure to be attributed, that we this day sit with so much tranquillity, each under his vine and under his fig-tree, in the enjoyment of both civil and religious liberty.</P>
<P>THE blessings, therefore, which GOD has conferred upon us, by means of this great and good man, are not merely of a civil nature; but, as it was said of JEHOIADA, so it may be said of WASHINGTON, that <HI>"He did good—both towards GOD, and towards his house."</HI> The frame of our civil government, and the liberty which under it we enjoy, which have been so much pro∣moted by him, are circumstances highly favorable to the interest of religion.—A government some∣thing similar to ours, seems to be essential to the
<PB N="12" REF="037963_0011_10102E05096209E0"/>
GLORIOUS REIGN OF the MESSIAH, which we are looking for with earnest expectation. We are assured from the prophecies of the old and new testament, that the time is coming, <HI>when the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD; when they shall not hurt nor destroy in all GOD's holy mountain; when his watchmen, his minister∣ing servants, shall see eye to eye, and lift up the voice and sing together; and when there shall be one fold, and one</HI> SHEPHERD. Now, is it possi∣ble, that such increase of divine knowledge, such perfect peace, and such concert and har∣mony in religion can ever take place, so long as civil governments, whether Christian, Anti∣christian, Mahometan or Pagan, take upon them to prescribe what religion people shall profess, and compel them to worship GOD, or their pretended gods, according to their several dic∣tates? Certainly it is not. So certain is it then, that all religious establishments by civil author∣ity, and whatever else may hinder men from judging for themselves in matters of religion, shall be removed out of the way, and every man be permitted to worship GOD agreeably to the dictates of his own conscience, enlight∣ened by the Holy Scriptures, and be protected in his religious as well as in his civil rights.
<PB N="13" REF="037963_0012_101021069E5D0E58"/>
Such is the state of things under our happy gov∣ernment; and such must be the state of all the nations of the earth, before the <HI>universal reign of the</HI> REDEEMER can take place. From scrip∣ture prophecies, and from events by which they have been fulfilled, and by which they are dai∣ly fulfilling before our eyes, we have reason to believe, that this long expected period is not very far distant. We may, therefore, look for∣ward and exult in the prospect of the time when <HI>"the kingdoms of this world shall become the kingdoms of our LORD and of his CHRIST,"</HI> and when JESUS shall reign triumphantly, <HI>"from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth."</HI> And it must afford us no small degree of pleasure to reflect, that so much pre∣paration is made in our happy country for this glorious event, by the establishment of our ci∣vil and religious liberties.</P>
<P>NOW as GOD has honored our illustrious CHIEF, by employing him so signally in accom∣plishing this important work; let us honor him this day, by rendering unfeigned thanks to the AUTHOR of all our blessings, for raising up among us so distinguished a personage, and making him the instrument of such inestimable benefits.
<PB N="14" REF="037963_0013_10102E06B4F38EA8"/>
This is the manner of honoring him which best becomes us as Christians, and best accords with the character of the deceased; who in both his public and private conduct, always manifest∣ed a deep sense of the superintendence of Di∣vine Providence, and of his constant dependence on the Great Disposer of all events.</P>
<P>AND while we deplore his removal from us, let us learn by his example to acquiesce in the wise disposals of Heaven, adopting the language of this excellent man, when, viewing from the opposite bank of the Hudson the capture of Fort Washington, he lifted his hands and eyes towards heaven, and said, "FATHER, <HI>thy will be done."</HI> Piety was not the least distinguishing trait in this great man's character. This it was that rendered him truly illustrious, and gave him a decided pre-eminence above all the great men of the earth in whom this quality was wanting.</P>
<P>AND as we can no way honor him more high∣ly than by imitating his pious example; so there is no way by which we have so fair a prospect of securing to ourselves the inestimable blessings which he has been the instrument of procuring.
<PB N="15" REF="037963_0014_10102E08444477E0"/>
It is a great error to suppose, that the justice of our cause will always ensure success, and the in∣justice of our adversaries defeat their pur∣pose. For if by our crimes we forfeit our rights and privileges, we may be deprived of them by being suffered to fall under the power of the most unrighteous enemies. It is only while we humbly <HI>"walk with GOD,"</HI> and <HI>"put our trust under the shadow of his wings,"</HI> that we may look for his gracious protection. Then indeed, we may confidently hope, that he will, from time to time, raise up to us such Counsellors, and such Defenders as our exigencies may require. He who could furnish America with a WASH∣INGTON, can never be at a loss for servants qualified to execute his beneficent purposes towards them who place their confidence in him. On his Almighty arm be all our depend∣ence, and for every deliverance, and for every salvation which we may experience, to him be all the glory. AND LET ALL THE PEOPLE SAY, AMEN.</P>
