<HEAD>AN EULOGY.</HEAD>
<P>ON this day, my respectable hearers, it has long been the practice, in various parts of our country, to celebrate the birth of that DIGNIFIED AND BELOVED CHARACTER, to whom we acknowledge ourselves, under GOD, so great∣ly indebted for our national existence.—</P>
<P>United millions are, probably, now convened to mourn his exit.—</P>
<P>The undissembled sorrow, which his removal from these earthly scenes, has occasioned, and which it must occasion, wherever the tidings of it spread, among the friends of liberty and vir∣tue,
<PB N="6" REF="036839_0004_100B1D81203AB3B0"/>
in every corner of the world, has been al∣ready well expressed, in many excellent perform∣ances on the subject.</P>
<P>But as our POLITICAL FATHERS, have with a unanimous voice, recommended this particular day, for manifesting the public grief at the de∣cease, and the public respect for the memory of our ILLUSTRIOUS FATHER, PATRON, AND FRIEND: I will endeavor to suggest some observations and reflections, which I hope will be thought not un∣suitable to this solemnity.—</P>
<P>The Death of so great, so good a man; of one, who has been so distinguished an instrument, in the hand of Providence, of dispensing blessings to his country and mankind; and whose longer continuance here, we so ardently desired; is an event, which we may well mourn. But let us mourn, with humble resignation.—</P>
<P>That he, who possessed every public and every private virtue, which ever adorned the life of any mortal, and who lived in the continual exercise
<PB N="7" REF="036839_0005_100B1D84A95CC690"/>
of these virtues, should be taken from us, at this critical period of our public affairs, is among the mysteries of that Providence, whose "judgments are unsearchable and whose ways are past find∣ing out."—</P>
<P>Death is a theme, which every rational being ought frequently to contemplate.—And when any of our fellow-creatures around us, are sum∣moned to leave the world, it should remind us that the time of our departure may also be near at hand, and excite us to live in an habitual pre∣paration for its important consequences.—But when the great and the good, the virtuous and the wise, men who were the glory of their coun∣try and the ornaments of human nature, are call∣ed off this stage of action; we should consider the wisdom and the virtue, the patriotism and the benevolence, which made them so useful in their day and generation, so much beloved in life, so sincerely regretted in death, and which height∣en their reward in the regions of celestial glory.—</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="036839_0006_100B1D86D1EDFB28"/>That we should make a wise improvement, of those eminent examples of exalted virtue, which are here set before us, is a dictate of reason, and it is the correspondent language of revelation. For the improvement we make of them, we are accountable to HIM, who is the Author of our being, the Source of all our mercies, the Inspector of our conduct, the Rewarder of virtue and the Punisher of vice.—</P>
<P>It is an established rule of God's moral govern∣ment, that they, who are favored with superior advantages, should bring forth superior fruit to his praise.—And what can be more reasonable, than that they should be distinguished for their behavior as men, as christians, as members of so∣ciety, as citizens of a free and an independent country; who have not only every induce∣ment in point of interest, to discharge these im∣portant duties of life, with fidelity; but who have also before them, the animating example of <HI>ONE</HI> who has performed these duties, with so much honor to himself, with so much benefit to his country, and to the admiration of mankind?</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="036839_0007_100B1D88EF44C4E0"/>Never were those virtues, which exalt and dig∣nify human nature, exhibited in a more pleasing and a more useful light, by any of the sons of Adam, than, in that BEST OF MEN, whose loss, we this day mourn.—His domestic circle, or they, who had the happiness to make part of his fami∣ly, bear unequivocal testimony to his tender and endearing attentions; to the display of all those virtues, which smooth life's rugged paths, and give a peculiar zest to its sweetest pleasures.—His profound respect for the constitution and laws of his country; his readiness to sacrifice his private interest to the public good, are too well known, ever to be called in question.—</P>
<P>His attachment to that religion, which is the best friend of man; that religion, with which the true happiness of individuals, of families, of socie∣ties and of nations, is inseparably connected, was abundantly manifested. —OUR WASHINGTON WAS "NOT ASHAMED OF THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST." He was not only firmly established in the belief of this divine system; but he made a public pro∣fession of his faith, and he adorned its doctrines
<PB N="10" REF="036839_0008_100B1D8B71485D10"/>
by a well ordered conversation. He esteemed it his highest honor, to be numbered among the followers of the MEEK AND LOWLY MASTER.— Of his rational and unaffected devotion, no one could, with any degree of propriety, entertain a doubt. And the goodness of his motives, in the performance of every moral duty, <HI>Malice</HI> itself, could find no ground to impeach.—</P>
<P>What a genuine lustre, does it reflect upon his character, that he was ever disposed to acknowl∣edge the SUPERINTENDING PROVIDENCE OF GOD; not only when surrounded by prosperity; but al∣so in seasons of the deepest distress.—His confi∣dence was placed in that Being, who had often ap∣peared for him in the time of adversity, who can bring good out of evil, light out of darkness; and who, he fondly hoped and sincerely believed, had many blessings in store, for his much lov'd country.—Thus was he enabled to persevere, with the greatest fortitude and resolution, in the way of his duty, under difficulties and discourage∣ments, that would have damped the ardor of a less elevated soul; to revive the drooping spirits
<PB N="11" REF="036839_0009_100B1D8DA68CB6A0"/>
of his countrymen, and finally to defeat the hos∣tile plans of those who wished to enslave them.</P>
<P>Happy was it for AMERICA; that she possessed such a character, in one of her own sons! Happy was it for her, that her most distinguished citizen, was not less distinguished, for his piety and vir∣tue, than for those great and glorious actions, which were more publicly known, and which have made his fame as extensive as the limits of the earth.—</P>
<P>Let our great men, whether in civil, in milita∣ry, or in private stations, remember, that they cannot resemble WASHINGTON, in one of the most beautiful and honorable traits in his charac∣ter; if they are not the sincere friends of religion. Destitute of this, they may perform many splen∣did actions, which shall command the loud hosan∣nas of the multitude, the vain applause of the un∣thinking rabble.—But destitute of this, they can never merit, nor enjoy the lasting confidence of the wise and good. Nor will they ever be ad∣mitted to share in those future and eternal re∣wards,
<PB N="12" REF="036839_0010_100B1D91530C24F8"/>
which await those exalted characters, who have performed the worthiest deeds, from the best of motives.—</P>
<P>To recite all the virtues of this GODLIKE MAN; particularly to enumerate his celebrated exploits; to relate all the unparalleled services, which he has rendered to his country and mankind; would be an employment, to which, I feel myself, alto∣gether unequal; and which the present occasion, does my no means demand.—</P>
<P>Let this be the business of the elegant historian, and the faithful biographer.—I shall now only en∣deavor to call your attention to some of the most remarkable transactions in his public life; transac∣tions, which many of you, well remember; and which our children and our children's children will long peruse, with mingled emotions of grat∣itude and admiration.—</P>
<P>At a very early period of his life, WASHINGTON displayed those military talents, which would have done honor to a veteran General; and, it
<PB N="13" REF="036839_0011_100B1D937980DB10"/>
was evidently owing to his prudent conduct, that any part of the army of the unfortunate <HI>Braddock</HI> was rescued from the horrid vengeance of their savage enemies.—</P>
<P>That our DEPARTED FRIEND was the most dis∣tinguished actor in that memorable revolution, which severed us from the <HI>British Empire;</HI> and which constituted us, a <HI>Free, Sovereign, and Inde∣pendent Nation</HI>; no one will presume to deny. It is a truth established beyond the possibility of a doubt, wherever our important and interesting history is known.—And that he was raised up, by Almighty GOD, to accomplish these great things for us; we must be strangely blinded not to see, and shamefully ungrateful not to acknowledge.</P>
<P>The peculiar talents, with which, the Author of every good and every perfect gift, was pleased to favor him, and his diligent improvement of these talents, qualified him for filling the most ex∣alted stations in life, with the highest honor to himself and the greatest benefit to his fellow-crea∣tures. His astonishing penetration, his unshaken
<PB N="14" REF="036839_0012_100B1D9503E11E48"/>
firmness and unrivalled influence, have by the blessing of heaven, kindly preserved us, when our best temporal interests have been in imminent danger, and seasonably dispelled the dark clouds, which overshadowed our political prospects.—</P>
<P>The wisdom, the prudence, the undaunted courage which this GREAT MAN, invariably man∣ifested, as the Leader of our armies, when con∣tending with one of the most powerful nations upon earth, are universally known; and were confessed, even by his enemies. They have rais∣ed a monument to his fame, which will remain unmoved, till every record of the inhabitants of this globe shall be lost.—</P>
<P>Let us enquire of those, who well knew the threatning aspect of our public affairs, toward the close of our revolutionary war; who well recollect that dangerous, that rebellious spirit, which some unprincipled men, then endeavored to instill into the minds of the army. They will unitedly agree in assuring us, that it was principally owing to the vigilant conduct and the guardian care of our
<PB N="15" REF="036839_0013_100B1D971A897500"/>
beloved WASHINGTON, that this dangerous spirit was crushed, while yet in embryo. Whereas had it been permitted to rage, and spread its baneful ef∣fects, it would have greatly tarnished the glory of our revolution, and fixed a disgrace upon our na∣tional character, which revolving ages would not have been able to efface.</P>
<P>At this most critical period, our ILLUSRIOUS FRIEND, was the great instrument, in the hand of GOD, of saving us from the impending calamity, and preserving to his victorious army, that high reputation which they had so justly acquired. With the feelings of a Friend, a Soldier, and a Commander, who possessed a warm place in their affections; he came forward and addressed his companions, in arms, upon those insidious at∣tempts, that were then made to seduce them, from their allegiance to their country — "As you value, said he, your own sacred honor, as you respect the sacred rights of humanity, as you regard the military and national character of America; express your utmost horror and detes∣tation of the man, who wishes, under any specious
<PB N="16" REF="036839_0014_100B1D9AD4D9C8A8"/>
pretences, to overturn the liberties of our country, and who wickedly attempts to open the flood∣gates of civil discord, and deluge our rising em∣pire with blood."—And we may venture to assert, that it was owing to his benevolent and unweari∣ed exertions, that our armies, to use his own beau∣tiful and energetic language, were "impressed with a proper idea of the dignified part, they had been called to act, under the smiles of Providence, on the stage of human affairs; to persevere through every extremity of hardship, suffering, and danger; to preserve a perfect unvarying consistency of char∣acter, through the very last act, to close the dra∣ma with applause; and to retire from the milita∣ry theatre, with the same approbation of angels and men, which had crowned all their former virtuous actions."</P>
<P>The conspicuous part, which this VIRTUOUS AND MOST RESPECTED CHARACTER took, in fram∣ing and establishing that excellent government, under which we live, and which has been pro∣ductive of so many blessings to our common coun∣try, will not, we trust, be soon forgotten.—His
<PB N="17" REF="036839_0015_100B1D9C5CEB2ED8"/>
wise, firm, and dignified conduct when placed, by the united voice of a grateful and an admir∣ing people, at the head of our nation, made us prosperous at home, and highly respected abroad. The deep concerted plans, which the rulers of a foreign nation contrived, to entangle us in the quarrels of Europe, and in all the distresses of war; and which their emissaries, one after another, were commissioned to put in execution; his po∣litical discernment effectually frustrated, and gave a most fatal blow to the base designs of our for∣eign and domestic enemies.</P>
<P>The invaluable legacy, which this GREAT AND GOOD MAN has bequeathed his country, in that <HI>paternal address,</HI> which he made to them, when he signified his intention to resign the high trusts and weighty cares of public life, cannot be too highly prized. If we regard it as we ought, it will be our best security against the wiles of those who are envious at our growing fame. It will preserve and increase to us the rich blessings which we now enjoy.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="036839_0016_100B1D9DE6EE8998"/>That HE should be ready to quit the retire∣ment ever dear to him, and which his advanced years had rendered peculiarly dear, when danger threatened his beloved country; and again to command her armies, should enemies dare to in∣vade us; while it demands our warmest gratitude, it will redound to his everlasting honor.</P>
<P>His unaffected piety, his uncommon virtues, have caused him to be revered, in every corner of the earth; and have ranked him among the best of Generals, the best of Statesmen, and the best of Men.</P>
<P>Let us be grateful to that kind Being, who is the giver of life, and the lengthener out of our days; that he continued with us so long, our FATHER, PATRON, AND FRIEND; and that he made him the minister of so much good to his country and mankind. And while we are humble, under that frown of Providence, which has deprived us of so much exalted worth; let us endeavor, by imitating his great example, to secure those fu∣ture
<PB N="19" REF="036839_0017_100B1DA0B8A56378"/>
and eternal rewards, which await the friend of God and the friend of man.</P>
<P>It will not, I am persuaded, be thought foreign to our subject, if I here remind you, that our hearts should rise in gratitude to the great DISPOSER OF EVENTS, that HE has raised up one, to be placed at the head of our nation, in whom the ILLUSTRIOUS AND BELOVED PERSON∣AGE whom has left our world, we humbly trust, for a world of glory, had the highest confidence, and of whose administration he warmly approv∣ed. Our sincere thanks are certainly due to the SUPREME GOVERNOR OF THE UNIVERSE, that HE has favored us with one, to sill the high∣est station in our government; whose superior talents, whose long tried services, and unshaken fidelity, entitle him to the unreserved confidence and gratitude of his country. His name is alrea∣dy enrolled with the greatest characters, who have appeared on earth; and his glorious exertions to establish the independence, to promote the welfare and the prosperity of this FEDERAL EMPIRE, will
<PB N="20" REF="036839_0018_100B1DA3A4E56B58"/>
furnish many interesting and instructive pages in the American history.</P>
<P>Cordially do we wish him the best of heaven's blessings! Fervently do we pray that he may be supported under that painful bereavement, which he sensibly feels with his afflicted country! May his important life be long preserved! May his important services never be erased from our hearts! May that God, in whom he trusts protect him! May that religion, of which, like his great predecessor in office, he is not ashamed, console him, under all his trials and difficulties, while here, and everlasting glories reward him hereafter.</P>
<P>Few indeed, among the children of men, are ever made the instruments, in the hand of Provi∣dence, of dispensing so much good to their fellow-creatures; as was the GREAT, the GOOD, the BE∣LOVED MAN, whose loss we this day mourn. But all of us certainly may act well our part in the stations in which the Almighty has seen sit to place us. If we make this wise resolution, and
<PB N="21" REF="036839_0019_100B1DA52C66ED98"/>
relying on his gracious aid, stedfastly adhere to it, happy will it be for us! For however humble the employments in which we are now engaged,— however obscure the spheres in which we now move,—the All-seeing God will behold us through the journey of life, with smiles of approbation. We shall hereafter join the great and the good, whom we loved, esteemed, and revered on earth. With them we shall inherit those bright abodes, where there is fulness of joy. With them shall we drink of those pure streams, which flow from his right hand, where there are pleasures forevermore.</P>
