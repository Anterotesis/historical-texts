</FIGURE> The Last Words and dying Speech of THOMAS GOSS, In a private Conference, previous to his Execution.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="confession">
<P>I WAS born at <HI>Brookfield,</HI> in the common∣wealth of <HI>Massachusetts.</HI> My parents sus∣tained respectable characters, and were blessed with easy fortune, superior to want, tho' not affluent.—My father was a farmer, who dy∣ing when I was about 10 years old, I conse∣quently become subject to the governance of my mother; but as she did not long survive the death of my father, I was sent, at the age of 14, to live with Capt. <HI>Jonathan Buttalf,</HI> a pretty wealthy farmer, resident in a society in <HI>Symsbury,</HI> near the boundary line of <HI>Massachu∣setts,</HI> with whom, and my brother, then living at <HI>Grenville,</HI> in the commonwealth aforesaid, (about 7 miles from Capt. <HI>Buttalf</HI>'s) I resided, alternately, till I arrived at the age of 22.—At which period, recruits being wanted to act against the <HI>French</HI> in <HI>Cannda,</HI> in the war be∣tween them and the <HI>English,</HI> in the year 1755, I enlisted as a soldier in the provincial service, for a short term, in defence of <HI>English</HI> liberty; and, with other recruits, took my departure from <HI>Springfield,</HI> under the command of Lieut. <HI>Jonathan Ball,</HI> (afterwards Major.)—On our arrival at <HI>Fort Edward,</HI> I was detached, under Major <HI>Rogers,</HI> commanding a corps of Rangers in that department, to scour the woods in search of war parties of the enemy; and be∣ing distinguished as qualified for such excur∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ons, discovering an acquaintance with the woods, as well as a fondness for enterprise; I was immediately ordered to act in capacity of a serjeant; tho' I never obtained a warrant of that office, nor received, tho' promised, more wages than a private soldier; being, as is but too frequently the case, defrauded of them by my officers. In piloting scouting parties of our men, thro' the woods was, therefore, my principal employment: nor did I ever betray the confidence reposed in me; but acted as a faithful guide, and dutiful soldier; not having been guilty of any misdemeanours, for which I now feel the least remorse of conscience."— Being reminded that a letter had been written to the States Attorney (<HI>John Canfield,</HI> Esq.) previous to his arraignment before the Hon.

<HEAD>Extract of a letter from a gentleman in London, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, to the States Attorney of Litchfield County, before the arraignment and conviction of <HI>Thomas Goss,</HI> for the murder of his wife.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>"SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>"I have been very uneasy in my mind for more than twen∣ty years past, being well persuaded, that <HI>Thomas Goss,</HI> was guilty of the murder of <HI>Elias Hopkins,</HI> late of Hartford: he was slain in the year 1758; Goss and Hopkins were companions in hunting, at or near Wood-Creek, in the fall of the year; Goss came in and reported, that the Indians fired on him and Hopkins, killed Hopkins, took the furr, traps, &amp;c. On which a scouting party was dispatched in quest of the body of Hop∣kins,—who reported on their return, that Hopkins was shot, hutt burn'd, furr &amp; traps missing; which report I believed; nor had I any suspicion that Goss was mischievous in the affair, till I returned from the service, the same year; to my surprise, I found that Goss had conveyed home the traps, furr, Hop∣kins's gun and shoe-buckles, which I well knew to be his, while living:—but by taking advice, I supposed I should expose my∣self, if I said much about it, being able to prove no more than what I have above related; I have therefore concealed my suspicion till this time, but am ready to disclose my knowledge more fully, if enquired of.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Test, EPHRAIM PELTON."</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER></NOTE> of <HI>New-Hartford,</HI> a companion with him in the year 1758, of which he was supposed to be guilty; —he replied, "It is a groundless misrepre∣sentation, and must have been dictated by a malevolent disposition, as Mr. <HI>Pelton</HI> is sup∣posed still to retain prejudices against me, on account of some animosities created between us while in service together, which amount∣ed to blows, and was never amicably adjust∣ed;"—giving the following advice respecting that unfortunate affair, viz. "As soon as the term of my enlistment had expired, wishing to pursue a more lucrative business than that of a soldier, I left the encampment, in com∣pany with a Mr. <HI>Flag</HI> and said <HI>Hopkins,</HI> deter∣mining to erect a hut to shelter us from the inclemency of the weather, and when that was accomplished, to employ ourselves in hunting and trapping: consequently, a hut was im∣mediately constructed, situated in the most unfrequented retirement of a swamp, about seven miles from <HI>Fort Edward,</HI> and in the neighbourhood of the enemy (exposing our∣selves thus to danger in order to watch their movements, and give intelligence of the same; in which we rendered very essential services, and for which we received the same pay and rations as though enlisted) where we lived to∣gether in the greatest harmony; making fre∣quent and successful, as well as very profita∣ble hunting excursions—and were equal sha∣rers in the game—<HI>Hopkins</HI> generally remaining (not being so well skill'd in hunting as our∣selves) in charge of the company's property: But having once, however, during our ab∣sence, and without our concurrence, retired to <HI>Fort Edward</HI> with what skins we had collect∣ed, and to considerable amount, in order for disposal; and having made an injudicious traffic, by taking in exchange for them arti∣cles that we did not want▪ such as pistols, &amp;c it was proposed by <HI>Flag</HI> that <HI>Hopkins,</HI> instead of myself, should go with him—to which I reluctantly assented, and returned into camp. —When they had proceeded about a mile from our habitation, <HI>Flag</HI> discovered, from a small eminence, a party of Indians, going, as he imagined, to surprize the garrison at <HI>Fort Edward</HI>; who were marching in a hollow, a∣bout 4 or 5 feet from the surface of the rising ground on their right and left.—<HI>Flag</HI> being a faithful and vigilant man, acquainted <HI>Hop∣kins,</HI> that he would endeavour to count their numbers, and then retire to apprize the army; requesting him to remain still, and not on any account to follow him; which he agreed to: —<HI>Hopkins,</HI> however, crept along undiscover∣ed by the enemy, and imprudently raised his gun over Flag's shoulder to fire upon them:— which was prevented by being thrown back; —unhappily, however, in making a second attempt, they observed a motion in the bushes, immediately skulked behind trees, and put themselves in a posture of defence:—They fired, and mortally wounded Hopkins in the breast;—Flag was taken prisoner, and as they knew him to be a trapper, obtained a pro∣mise of good treatment on a discovery of pro∣perty; which terms he readily accepted, and conducted them to the hut—which they plun∣dered, leaving only two traps behind, infor∣mation of which was not given them.—Flag remained a prisoner in <HI>Canada</HI> during the war, at the close of which he returned, and from him I learnt the fate of Hopkins, &amp;c.—That the hut was burnt, (as represented) no per∣son, unless a fool or madman, can suppose to be true; as such an event would certainly have alarmed the army, and frustrated the design of the enemy."—<HI>Was you not suspected, and examined, as an offender in that affair?</HI> No; nor did I ever convey home any property belong∣ing to Hopkins."—With respect to the au∣thenticity of this account, the reader must draw his own conclusions▪ Mr. Pelton is said to be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> gentleman <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eracity, and his charac∣ter free from aspersions.</P>
<P>"The commission of the several murders of which I have been accused, viz. that of a French prisoner last war and an Indian, as likewise a child of my own, I positively declare to be false; such reports must have originated with prejudiced and evil minds: but, that I killed my wife, is indisputable.—<HI>Have you a knowledge of that event?</HI> Yes. <HI>Did she say any thing before the fatal blow was given?</HI> Yes, she asked if I designed to kill her; and uttered these words,—<HI>O Belzebub, my master, have mercy on me.—Do you remember any other oc∣currences of that unhappy night?</HI> Yes; the holy angels have convinced me that I got up and lay down in bed five or six times previous to the murder, dressing and undressing myself a often.—<HI>Had you any intention of secreting the body of your wife?</HI>—Yes. Sometime previous to that transaction, my wife and her associ∣ates concerted a plan to deprive me of life.— After they had effected their purpose, I was to have been thrown into an ash-hole, which communicated from a fire place in my house, into the cellar. In this place, I had it in con∣templation to conceal her, after cutting her in pieces;—and while this was in agitation, I thought of a breach made in my cellar wall— in which the witches and wizards kept their treasure.—This place I examined, plunging a crow-bar twice into it;—and concluding to bury her here, I returned, in a few moments, to where she lay, and took the body in my arms to dispose of accordingly;—but immediately laid it back.—<HI>Had you any thought of murdering the infant in bed with her?</HI>—The devil and I were at strife about it.—He endeavoured to urge me to it; but the angels commanded the contrary, and I laid it carefully away.—<HI>Were you not jealous with respect to the chastity of your wife?</HI>—Yes, and confirm'd in that opinion by an acquaintance with her illicit correspond∣ents;—several of whom were evidences against me on my trial.—<HI>Had you any private bicker∣ings with your wife the day previous to the mur∣der?</HI>—Not that I recollect; though we were strangers to domestic happiness some months before that event took place.—<HI>Did you com∣plain to authority, and divulge your suspicions?</HI>— Yes, but some of them being intimate with her, and free-masons, acted partially, and put a master over me only.—<HI>Was it justifiable, taking into consideration every circumstance, to kill your wife?</HI>—To kill in self-defence is jus∣tifiable—she had frequently threatened my life—and often when sitting at table.—Was it not just in Moses to kill the Egyptian, and bury him in the sand?—<HI>He acted under the immediate influence of his divine Master—you, from a spirit of malevolence, created by jealousy.</HI> —You are indeed mistaken,—I was surround∣ed with holy angels when I laid violent hands on my wife.—<HI>Would it not tend to your future happiness, and be more satisfactory to your children and friends, were you to conduct with steadiness and composure of mind, by devoting the few re∣maining hours of life, in serious meditation, and advice of the clergy?</HI>—Reply, don't you ima∣gine that men of liberal education are more intriguing, and do more frequently deceive the world than illiterate farmers.—And will you not allow that there are as many bad clergy∣men, in proportion to their number, as of any other sect?—As this is my opinion, why should I request their advice or prayers, in preference to others.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="comment">
<P>Much might be said with respect to the conduct of this un∣happy man. His behaviour while in prison has been striking∣ly singular. Previous to his trial he appeared very irrational. After his condemnation was very composed for a considerable time—Requested advice and prayers, and regularly attended divine service—But for about three weeks has behaved like a poor deluded wretch—Abuses the clergy, and defies the powers of earth and hell to hang him—Calling himself brother to JE∣SUS CHRIST, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
