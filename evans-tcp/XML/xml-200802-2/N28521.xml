<BIBL>PSALM LXXXIX, 48.</BIBL>
<Q>What man is he that liveth and shall not see death?</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT hath been the custom in every civilized na∣tion, to perpetuate the memory of illustrious men by monumental inscriptions; or in the historic page to record their worth, and to hold up to view their peculiar virtues, not only for the admiration, but for the imitation of suc∣ceeding ages: And to promote the same lau∣dable purposes, funeral sermons, and orations have for several hundred years been delivered in Europe. And I am persuaded, that scarce∣ly a congregation in America, hardly a Prea∣cher in the UNITED STATES would have omit∣ted this last tribute of respect, to the worthy character whose death we this day deplore, if the government had <HI>not</HI> recommended it. Let the solemn funeral processions in our Cities, and Villages—Let the elegies, and the orati∣ons, that have already been written and deli∣vered—Let the tokens of mourning so gene∣rally worn throughout our nation—Let <HI>these avouch</HI> the truth of my sentiment, that; WASH∣INGTON, the great, the virtuous WASHING∣TON,
<PB N="4" REF="038000_0003_100FB0C1789CCC40"/>
as he lived <HI>almost</HI> universally admired and loved, so he died <HI>universally</HI> lamented. Our assembling in this Church this morning is a partial evidence, that we are of the number who conceive his death to be loss to our coun∣try. But let us remember that Washington is not <HI>alone to die;</HI> that, we shall <HI>soon</HI> follow him into the region of eternity, and that the great business of <HI>our</HI> life is to be prepared for <HI>our</HI> death. To assist my hearers in seeking this preparation, and to recount the virtues of <HI>our</HI> illustrious patriot, <HI>our</HI> hero and <HI>our</HI> friend, are the designs I have in view in this discourse; and in order to execute these important purpo∣ses, I shall in the,</P>
<P><HI>First</HI> place, Briefly consider the origin—the nature—and the effects of death; and Second∣ly, Illustrate the happy consequences of being prepared for this awful hour; and under this head shall introduce the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The historick and characteristic parts of this sermon are derived from the most respectable authorities; or given on my own knowledge. The publications from which I have made extracts are Dr. Morse's Geography; a peace said to be written by a Senator of the United States, and published in the news papers of this city; and General Lee's Oration. Sometimes I have omitted <HI>whole sentences</HI> in the quotations, in order to include in as few words as possible the great variety of matter necessarily introduced.</NOTE> character of our de∣parted and beloved General. In pursuance of this method; I begin with considering the ori∣gin, nature and effects of death. First its ori∣gin. Here we are entirely indebted for infor∣mation to the sacred oracles; we might enquire,
<PB N="5" REF="038000_0004_100FB0C466F991D0"/>
but enquire in vain at any other source to know, whether man was made originally mortal, or, became so by any casuality. Revelation as∣sures us Rom. V-12. "Wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned." Our first progenitor having tasted the interdicted fruit, became instantly liable to the threatned penalty. "In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die." Gen. 11-17. On that day his soul died to God. i. e. he lost that knowledge of, and love to God, he so eminently possessed before his transgression; and his body with those of his posterity became inevitably subject to death.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The nature of death; is the disso∣lution of the union subsisting between our bo∣dies and our souls; on this union the animal life depends. This union it is impossible in our present state to understand, or describe; it is one of the mysteries that in eternity only we shall be able to comprehend. This union is dissolved by the command, or permission of God, when he summonses our spirits hence. He gave us life, and when he pleases he divests us of it. In vain we try with all our efforts to retain the spirit of departing friends; our pray∣ers, and tears are of no avail; they faulter—they sink—they die.</P>
<Q><LG>
<L><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Night Thoughts</NOTE>When by the bed of languishment we sit,</L>
<L>Or, o'er our dying friends, in anguish hang,</L>
<L>Wipe the cold dew, or stay the sinking head,</L>
<L>Number their moments, and in ev'ry clock;</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="038000_0005_100FB0C8646133B0"/>
Start at the voice of an eternity;</L>
<L>See the dim lamp of life just feebly lift</L>
<L>An agonising beam, at us to gaze,</L>
<L>Then sink again, and quiver into death.</L>
</LG></Q>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The effects of death▪ 1st, It is the termination of our present existence; the final period of our joys and sorrows concerning the things of this life. The sun shall rise with its accustomed lustre, and spread its beaming light, and genial warmth throughout the earth; but not to them who are in the cold and dreary mansions of the grave. The busy scenes of life no more attract the sight, nor the love of riches, fame, or pleasure, arrest the midnight hour of sleep. See, the corpse all pale and wan!—It's active strength is gone!—It's vigour prostrate!—It's hands forget to move, the pliant fingers stiff and cold! Once we surveyed our friend; we saw, admired and loved—Once we viewed our rising offspring, and as they played and prattled our hearts beat fondness. But, they are dead! Not many days since we met the eye of our friend—Our love, with joy and plea∣sure; but its closed for ever, no more to con∣vey in silent language, the soft, the tender movements of the heart. The tongue, that busy member so prone to please—to hurt—to wound moves now no more in scandal or in praise. Death! Death! Displays his triumphs over every part, and silence, awful, universal silence reigns.</P>
<P>2<HI>ndly.</HI> Death renders all distinctions void. If we view the reposotiries of our lifeless bo∣dies; we shall see persons of every age and cha∣racter,
<PB N="7" REF="038000_0006_100FB0C9EA0B0020"/>
of every rank and condition in life; the young and the old, the poor and the rich, the gay and the grave, all mingling promiscu∣ously their dust <HI>together</HI> in their parent earth. There the poor oppressed slave lays down at the last the burden of his toilsome life, and feels his cruel servitude no more; no more to be raised from needful slumber on his bed of earth, nor driven from his s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anty meal to the hard labours of the day. There lieth the aged pa∣rent of a numerous offspring who sunk into rest amidst the tears of his progeny. Here is en∣tombed the smiling infant; the flower nipped as it began to blow. The parents wonder why heaven has been so unkind, and are ready to say (although improperly) "all these things are against me." Thus one generation cometh, and passeth away, another riseth, and is no more seen. We may say therefore at the tomb of the Monarch, as well as the slave.
<Q><L>A heap of dust alone remains of thee,</L>
<L>'Tis all thou art, and all the proud shall be.</L></Q>
Oh! transitory and fleeting life. When will the sons of men learn to think of thee as they ought? when will they <HI>every day,</HI> nay <HI>every hour</HI> recollect, that nothing can shield them from the stroke of death? "That there is <HI>no</HI> escape in that war?" If consummate beauty could have saved from death, Absalom, nor Helen would never have died. If valour could have stopped his career, Alexander would <HI>now</HI> be traversing the earth. If philosophic wisdom, learning or judgment, could have saved mor∣tals from his icy arms, a Newton, a Critchton
<PB N="8" REF="038000_0007_100FB0CDC73E8DA0"/>
and a Locke would still have been living. If piety and usefulness could have secured our ex∣istence here, an Usher and a Baxter; a White-field and a Wesley, would be daily displaying their holy and heavenly zeal, in building up the Church of God; and if love of his country, disinterestedness, gentleness, humanity, va∣lour, and patriotism could have eluded the in∣satiate monster's grasp, our Washington would not have been laid in the silent tomb. But the unchangable decree of heaven is "<HI>Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.</HI>" And we may enquire in the language of our text, what man is he that liveth, and shall <HI>not</HI> see death? But our enquiry will be <HI>fruitless and vain.</HI></P>
<P>3<HI>dly.</HI> Another effect of death is still more awful. It is the gate that opens into eternity—It leads us to God; to receive a reward or a punishment as our works have been; to hear our impartial, irrevocable doom. No time <HI>now</HI> for repentance; no promises of acceptance, or pardon to encourage us; no sermons to di∣rect us to the sinner's friend; no friends to counsel and to pray for us; our state is unal∣terably, unchangably fixed. How necessary then is it, that we NOW endeavour to attain a suitable preparation for the solemn moment? The happy consequences attending such a pre∣paration, I was in the <HI>second</HI> place to point out. Here we may <HI>first</HI> enquire what this preparati∣on is? And,</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st.</HI> We have all sinned against our Maker.
<PB N="9" REF="038000_0008_100FB0D2298662E8"/>
If we say we <HI>have not sinned,</HI> we make him a liar, and his word is not in us. 1 John 1 cap. 10. We are <HI>guilty</HI> therefore before God; and if the holy law which we have violated is a righteous law; we are consequently <HI>justly</HI> con∣demned; and if so, must be under the displea∣sure of the MOST HIGH. This guilt there∣fore <HI>must</HI> be pardoned, those sins <HI>must</HI> be for∣given, or God will <HI>not</HI> receive us to favour or to happiness. Our guilt can only be removed, and pardon bestowed, through a deep consci∣ousness of our lost and sinful state; wrought in our souls by the HOLY SPIRIT, exciting us to confess—to mourn for, and to forsake our sins; and by looking to, and believing in that glori∣ous saviour who died for our offences. A cloud of scriptures prove these important truths. I shall refer you only to Matt. V. 4. Luke XIII. 3. John XVI. 8. and III. 16. Proverbs XXVIII. 13.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> We are unholy, and consequently un∣fit for the company and employments of hea∣ven. It would be an insult to those who have bibles in their houses, or, attend to the exer∣cises of their own minds, to suppose them ig∣norant of this essential truth. If any doubt it, let them read Psalm XIV. 2 &amp; 3▪ 11. 5. Rom. VI. 16 to 22. Isai 1. 6. In fact, all the ex∣hortations to purity and holiness, with which the scripture abounds necessarily presuppose that we are unholy. Then it clearly follows, we <HI>must</HI> be made holy, must have a disposition suited to the nature of Heaven, "For without
<PB N="10" REF="038000_0009_100FB0D453DB5FC0"/>
holiness no man shall see the Lord." Heb. XII. 14. And as we cannot make <HI>ourselves holy</HI> it must be wrought <HI>in us</HI> by the power and grace of God. The suitable preparation for death <HI>then</HI> is; to be <HI>justified</HI> thro' faith in the merit &amp; righteousness of the Lord Jesus; &amp; to be <HI>sanc∣tified</HI> through the same medium, by the Spirit of the living God. That without this work of grace we can have no admittance to heaven, is undeniably proved from Acts XXVI. 18. 1 Cor. VI. II. Colos. 1. 12, 15, 22. Heb. XII. 14. From this work of grace <HI>always</HI> proceeds a life of holy obedience to the precepts of the Gospel. Our Redeemer hath given us this test to try our religion. "He that hath my com∣mandments and keepeth them, <HI>he it is</HI> that loveth ME." The happiness attending such a preparation I am now to point out. And</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st.</HI> Such gracious souls have an abiding con∣fidence of the favor of God. St. Paul says "WE KNOW that if our earthly house of this taberna∣cle were dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the hea∣vens." And he again informs us, We are <HI>al∣ways confident</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. 2 Cor. V. 1-5-6. How exquisite the joy that arises from this consciousness of the favour of God, is beyond the power of language to communicate; called therefore by one who possessed it for many years, and who could have described it, if any man could, "a joy unspeakable and full of glo∣ry." This sweet sensibility of our heavenly Father's love, chases from the mind the fear of
<PB N="11" REF="038000_0010_100FB0D97129A9B0"/>
death. Psalm 23-4. "Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, <HI>I will fear no evil.</HI>" This calms the terrors, and draws the sting of death: "The sting of death is sin, but thanks be to God who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ." 1 Cor. XV. 56. Victory! over its horrors that it cannot amaze; victory! over its power that it cannot detain.</P>
<P>Therefore,</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>ndly.</HI> In every saint when God calls him hence, there is a <HI>willingness</HI> to go. The grace and love of God opens his <HI>grasp</HI> of life. Al∣though his friends—his bosom friend—his ris∣ing progeny are entwined about his heart, with the cords of earthly affection, so close and firm, that with the highest aids of reason they can never be loosed. But when our Jesus shines into the soul with a ray of heavenly light and joy, his language is "I desire to depart and to be with Christ, which is far better. Some of the Saints die in the full triumphs of faith; while others equally pious, who are greatly emaciated by lingering disease, feel sweet submission, and sail more gently with a peaceful stream into the haven of eternal rest. Some have had hard fighting with the adversa∣ry on the confines of eternity, but have <HI>always</HI> obtained the victory before the conflict closed. "My grace is sufficient for thee." And "I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee," are the le∣gacies left to every saint.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly.</HI> They rest from all their toils. "Bles∣sed are the dead that die in the LORD from
<PB N="12" REF="038000_0011_100FB0DB020D5848"/>
henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them." Rev. XIV-13. In this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their joys were intermingled with sorrows▪ "But when the ransomed of the <HI>Lord</HI> shall re∣turn to Zion, they shall obtain joy and glad∣ness, and <HI>sorrow and sighing</HI> shall flee away." Jsai. XXXV. 10. Their grief and sorrows in this life arise from many causes, not neces∣sary now to enumerate; but in that "rest which remains for the people of God," every tear is wiped from every eye; there sorrow never comes; there all is calm, and joy and peace.</P>
<P>Once more,</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>thly.</HI> To crown their joys they receive the approbation of their God. "Well done good and faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord." The smiles of their heavenly Fa∣ther when introduced into His glorious pre∣sence, fill their enlarged souls with extatic rapture. But on this part of the subject I shall not endeavour to enlarge; our excursions might probably sully the views of that land of rest, they endeavour to exalt. I shall only say, that besides the presence, and manifested love of their God, and their Saviour, they shall mingle with Prophets, Patriarchs and Apostles, and with all those great, pious, and illustrious spirits, who through faith and patience have already inherited the promises. Amidst this heavenly choir; this bright assemblage of the spirits of the just made perfect; we may hum∣bly hope our much loved Washington is gone
<PB N="13" REF="038000_0012_100FB0DDF873EF50"/>
to dwell; among them to celebrate in celestial strains, the love that redeemed him, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which protected him in the greatest dan∣gers, and at last conducted him to the blisfull region of love and praise; where the sound, nor the alarm of war is never heard.—Where peace eternal dwells—Where joy seraphic reigns.</P>
<P>This day is dedicated by authority publicly to express our sorrow (though with submission to heaven) for his removal. This day is pe∣culiarly set apart to rehearse his matchless deeds—To recount his virtues, and declare his praise.</P>
<Q>He was born the 11th of February 1732 old stile, at the parish of Washington, Westmoreland county in Virginia. Was the first fruit of a second marriage, and received his education from a private tutor employed in the family. He early discovered a disposition for a military life; and at the age of fifteen was entered as a midshipman on board a British man of war then on the American coast, but the reluctance his mother expressed to his engaging in the sea service, occasioned the prosecution of the plan to be abandoned.</Q>
<P>"Previous to this transaction when he was but ten years of age his Father died, and the charge of the family devolved on his eldest brother: This brother had a command in the colonial troops employed against Carthagena; and on his return from that expedition named his new patrimonial Mansion, <HI>Mount Vernon,</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="038000_0013_100FB0E1C5C1F7F0"/>
in honor of the admiral of that name from whom he had received many civilities, and who commanded the squadron on that expedition. But he did not long survive; at his decease the eldest son by the second marriage (who was our Washington) inherited this seat, and a con∣siderable landed property. Before he attained to his twentieth year, he was made Adjutant General of the militia in Virginia with the rank of Major. When he was about twenty one years old an event occured which called his abilities into public notice, in 1773 en∣croachments were reported to have been made by the French on the territories of the British colonies to the westward. Major Washington was sent with full powers to ascertain the facts; to treat with the savages; and to warn the French to desist from their aggressions; he per∣formed the duties of this mission with singular industry, intelligence and address; and his re∣port to governor Didwiddie discovered those talents in embryo, which have since been un∣folded to general admiration." In 1755 he was advanced to the rank of colonel, in the provincial troops employed in conjunction with the British forces, to drive the French from their encroachments on our frontiers. We have all heard, or read of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he obstinate, and unfortunate Braddock who commanded those forces. He was totally defeated; slain himself; his whole force routed; British and American blood mingling and flowing in tor∣rents along the banks of the Monongahela. "It was here our youthful Washington in the gloomy hour of Indian victory, saved by his
<PB N="15" REF="038000_0014_100FB0E46E4CC0B0"/>
judgment and his valour, the remains of a fly∣ing army, pressed by the conquering savage foe." It was on this occasion that the Revd. Mr. Davies, who was afterwards President of Princeton College uttered that remarkable pro∣phecy. "That Washington was raised up by the providence of God to be the <HI>protector and saviour of his country.</HI>" In this war he had at different times separate commands, in all which victory declared Washington her future favo∣rite. The great fatigues he underwent in the three succeeding years of the war, brought on a complaint of the lungs, which it was <HI>then</HI> thought would prove mortal; and tranquility being at this time restored to the frontiers, by a series of splendid victories gained by Ameri∣can and British valour; Colonel Washington resigned his military appointment. His health was gradually re-established; and untill the be∣ginning of the American revolution he cultivat∣ed the arts of peace; he was constantly a mem∣ber of the Assembly; a magistrate of his coun∣ty; and a judge of the court.</P>
<P>The worth of Washington was not yet <HI>fully</HI> known. "Once more the gathering storm of war agitates this peaceful country—our rights are violated by <HI>Britain</HI>—our privileges abridg∣ed—a tribute claimed—a sense of <HI>fancied</HI> supe∣rior power, requiring submission presents itself. From the shore to the mountains—from Geor∣gia to Maine, all is commotion, while resent∣ment, hope and dispair alternately predomi∣nate." In '74 a continental congress conven∣ed, Washington was chosen a delegate from his
<PB N="16" REF="038000_0015_100FB0E5F5A5EAD0"/>
native state; the next year he was chosen again. The aggressions of Britain, and the insolence of her officers increased. They spilled <HI>Ameri∣can blood at Lexington</HI> in the month of April—<HI>Horror, and resentment thrilled through our hearts.</HI> TO ARMS, TO ARMS the patriots cry. TO ARMS—TO ARMS, re-echoed through the land; while I remember the event∣ful period, the sound still vibrates on the ear. We appealed to the world that we were <HI>forced</HI> into the contest. We appealed to heaven for the <HI>justice</HI> of our cause. An army was collect∣ed in the vicinity of Boston. Washington was appointed to command. A seven years war succeeds. The memorable events are too re∣cent to need a particular recital. It closed in the dismemberment of a Mighty Empire; <HI>in the establishment of American freedom.</HI></P>
<P>The warrior's sword is sheathed, and the graceful victor comes dressed in the garland of peace. His country now completely trium∣phant, is universally acknowledged indepen∣dent and free. Now he enjoys a full recom∣pence for all his toils, a consciousness of hav∣ing done his duty <HI>with effect;</HI> and with the ap∣probation of his fellow citizens. "Entwined with laurel he now returns to his native home equally the object of esteem and admiration: He lives the theme of the brave, the counsell of the wise, the benefactor of the poor, and the friend of mankind."</P>
<P>The confederation these states had formed in the hour of danger, was found after 11 years trial to be inadequate for a peaceful sys∣tem;
<PB N="17" REF="038000_0016_100FB0E89ADE6718"/>
indeed it was a compound of necessity and jealousy which threatned danger <HI>only</HI> held together; the danger being over, it relaxed in all its parts, and was rapidly sinking to a dis∣solution. The necessity of a new system of go∣vernment appeared to all—A convention was called—Washington presided. A constitution is formed on the model of human perfection; combining in its various branches whatever is excellent in every other form of government, and partaking of <HI>none</HI> of their defects. In this constitution an executive Magistrate is wanted to enforce its laws, when the unanimous voice of our country call him to be <HI>President of the United States.</HI> "Under his administration in∣dustry raised her drooping head—Agriculture resumed her plow—virtue smiled—learning rejoiced—commerce flourished"—peace and plenty; joy and gladness were seen and heard throughout our land; but the revolutions &amp; wars in Europe reach in their effects our happy shores, and threaten our country's peace. Washington is equal to every danger. He proclaims the laws of peace; yet wisely <HI>prepares</HI> for war. He lays the foundation of his policy in the principles of private justice, and public faith;" from these he deviates not a moment, and his country <HI>now</HI> feels and rejoices in their good effects. How well he performed his part, how highly we esteemed, and approved his conduct, are clearly evinced by the universal call for him to fill the presidental chair again without <HI>one</HI> dissenting voice. "Again he serves, and again he manifests that he is still
<PB N="18" REF="038000_0017_100FB0EA554F2788"/>
the same wise and faithful guide." To recount all his services, and the difficulty of steering at the helm of government, amidst the convul∣sive wars and jarring interests of the European nations, would take up too much time; let it suffice to say, that wisdom, prudence and firm∣ness were discovered on every occasion. His duty well performed he once more returns to domestic life. "He served from a sense of du∣ty, and he retired from a voluntary choice." But how uncertain is the state of human af∣fairs? While we were cultivating peace with all the hostile powers, a cloud gathered in our horison, and the alarm of threatened war again was heard throughout our land. Our cities, our villages resound with martial music; em∣battled ranks of <HI>Volunteers</HI> proffer their service to repel the foe—an army is raising, and Washington, the aged Washington is invited to command. When his country calls, he instantly obeys; he accepted the charge, and confidence chears our anxious minds.—But! oh! he is gone—No more! in case of war to lead our armies to victory; to grace our coun∣cils with his presence, and enlighten them by his wisdom. He is gone! to the silent mansi∣ons of the dead! <HI>Yet he lives in the hearts of the American people.</HI> He lives in the esteem and admiration of the world,—And while suns shall rise and set; while virtue remains on the earth, the name of Washington shall be pro∣nounced with veneration.</P>
<P>In collecting, and arranging materials for this luminous character, from the observations
<PB N="19" REF="038000_0018_100FB0EF414B4898"/>
of others, and from my own knowledge; con∣siderable difficulties have occurred in determin∣ing what parts to retain, or to omit. <HI>The all of Washington was worth rehearsing;</HI> but this would have lengthened my discourse beyond all reasonable bounds, and I fear that I have already trespassed on your patience; but as you will not probably hear another sermon on this interesting subject; be pleased to permit me before I conclude, to point out a few of the ex∣cellencies of his mind, exemplified in corres∣pondent actions.</P>
<P>First. As a soldier and a commander he was intrepid and brave, he was cool and determin∣ed. Let the dangerous, but successful attack he made at Trenton, in the dead of winter, in a dark and gloomy night, with dispirited sol∣diers, evince his prowess and the vigor of his mind. "He fought—He conquered—The morning sun cheered the American world—Our country <HI>rose</HI> on the event." Let his retiring not long after this victory, from the front of a numerous army, and while he retreated <HI>unper∣ceived</HI> from their front, he unexpectedly fell upon their rear cantoned at Princeton, and captured the whole. Let these masterly ma∣neuvres declare his superior knowledge in the art of war. They will testify to succeeding a∣ges, his sagacity, his prudence &amp; his valour.—Long Island can witness a retreat not surpassed in the page of history; an hostile army in his front, not two hundred yards distant, consisting of more than <HI>three times</HI> his number; a rapid river a full mile wide in his rear; the enemies

shipping ready to move in order to cut off his <HI>only</HI> retreat; not boats sufficient to transport a fifth part of his army at once, this army unused to discipline; and consequently to silence. Under all these disadvantages almost impossible to be surmounted by any other general; he brought off his troops to the great surprise of the enemy, without the loss of a <HI>single man.</HI>—Let the hills of Brandewine—Let the fields of Germantown—Let the plains of Monmouth witness his bravery, his cool and determined valour. How often have I seen him undismay∣ed in the greatest danger, giving his orders with calmness, while deaths flew thick around.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author of this discourse was an officer in the Continental army, in the Jersey line, and was in every action in the revo∣lutionary war, where the illustrious Washington personally commanded; except the battle of Monmouth, and the siege of York Town.</NOTE></P>
<P>2<HI>ndly.</HI> He was apparently unmoved in the most adverse circumstances. Ah! my bre∣thren had <HI>you seen</HI> our little army in the fall of '76 retreating through the Jerseys, after the enemy had made the garrison of Fort Washing∣ton prisoners of war; had you seen the small remains of this army diminishing every day by the time of their enlistments expiring; scarce∣ly amounting to 3000 men; had you beheld these brave soldiers without sufficient cloathing, shivering with cold; had you observed many of them to be without shoes, and the frozen ground marked with the <HI>blood,</HI> that issued from their uncovered feet, as they marched along; had you seen this little band pressed by a nu∣merous
<PB N="21" REF="038000_0020_100FB0F3726C2460"/>
well appointed army, with a most form∣idable train of artillery, and a proportionate number of dragoons; had you seen the militia at this <HI>early period</HI> of the war, (unused to such sad reverses) appearing like persons in the deepest amazement, and few of them to be found embodied<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">After the army had retreated across the Delaware Gen. Washington was reinforced by a body of Pennsylvania mili∣tia, previous to the attack at Trenton; and at the same time the Jersey militia embodied in numbers, and skirmished fre∣quently with the enemy.</NOTE>; had you seen the inhabitants who were friends fo their country for eighty miles in length, and from 6 to 12 miles in breadth flying in all directions, to secure their movable property, preserve their fami∣lies, and save their lives; had you seen all this consternation; had you heard our <HI>intes∣tine enemies</HI> (when not over-awed by superior numbers) exulting in the prospect of <HI>British conquest;</HI> had you heard the most sanguine friends to their country's freedom giving up in a moment of despair; <HI>that all was lost;</HI> you might have read dismay on <HI>almost</HI> every coun∣tenance. All looked to Washington. No sor∣row seemed to set on his brow. He was serene and clear as the unclouded sun. He was in∣deed then more than a host. His words, his example, his countenance all jointly contribu∣ted to inspire us with confidence and courage. To finish this part of his character, <HI>I must say</HI> that he was unequalled by any of the heroes of antiquity; by any general of modern times. They <HI>shrink</HI> from the comparison.—They pos∣sessed
<PB N="22" REF="038000_0021_100FB0F6571E3680"/>
virtues it is true, but they were tarnish∣ed by their defects. Alexander was brave like Washington, but he was cruel and intemper∣ate. Caesar was intrepid, but he enslaved his country. Cromwell was wise and successful, but he acted like a hypocrite, and aimed at the regal power. Suwarrow is undoubtedly a great commander, but has he not <HI>boasted</HI> of his at∣chievements? Buoneparte is full of martial fire, is an able and excellent General, but has he not like Cromwell destroyed the sacred right of election? the grand palladium of li∣berty. Has he not undertaken to frame a con∣stitution for the French people, when they have <HI>not delegated to HIM this authority?</HI> Marl∣borough in the reign of Queen Anne, in many things most resembled our Washington. He had like our hero a handsome person, and an elegant manner of address. He was wise in the cabinet, he was brave in the field—he knew when to attack and when to be passive—He possessed great calmness in action, and was mer∣ciful in victory; but Marlborough, the famous Marlborough was <HI>avaritious.</HI> He possessed by the bounty of his Country the highest hon∣ours, and one of the greatest estates in Eng∣land. Yet he defrauded the soldiers by dimi∣nishing their allowance of bread, and applying their loss to his own use; the cloth for the use of the soldiers was purchased by <HI>his agents</HI> and overcharged to the government; these disgraceful peculations caused a poet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pope.</NOTE> of his time to satirize him in the following lines.
<Q><PB N="23" REF="038000_0022_100FB0F8F58C5408"/>
<L>"Triumphant leaders at an army's head,</L>
<L>Hemm'd round with glories, <HI>pilfer</HI> cloth and bread,</L>
<L>As meanly plunder, as they bravely fought;</L>
<L>Now save a nation, and now save a groat."</L></Q>
But our Washington was, <HI>thirdly:</HI> disinterest∣ed. Let it be remembered that he received <HI>no pay</HI> for his long and toilsome services: he suffered, he fought for his country's freedom, and not for its money. Let it be known that when the Governor and Legislature of Virginia, by an act of that common wealth vested in him fifty shares in the companies for opening the navigation of the James and Patowmac rivers, as a small acknowledgment of his merit and services; he made this noble and generous re∣ply. "When I was first called to the station with which I was honoured during the late con∣flict for our liberties; to the diffidence which I had so many reasons to feel in accepting it, I thought it my duty to join a firm resolution to shut my hand against <HI>every pecuniary recom∣pence.</HI>"</P>
<P>4<HI>thly.</HI> He was not ambitious of retaining power. I adduce his chearful and voluntary resignation of the command of the army as a sufficient proof. Let his intention of retiring from the Presidentship when the term of his first election expired (though certain of being re-elected) demonstrate to the world, that his motives were pure; that neither ambition, nor the love of power reigned in his breast.</P>
<P>5<HI>thly.</HI> As a statesman he was well informed. He understood the true interests of his country, and pursued them with undeviating ardour. With what ability and skill he conducted the
<PB N="24" REF="038000_0023_100FB0FBA14A2010"/>
helm of government undeniably appears in the unparaleled growing greatness of our country.</P>
<P>6<HI>thly.</HI> He was a useful citizen; as he ever paid the strictest obedience to the laws of the land. He encouraged every plan calculated to increase the welfare of our country. Some of the measures entered into, for the opening, and improving our inland navigation, are said to have originated with him; and it is certain that he promoted every measure of public uti∣lity by all the means in his power.</P>
<P>7<HI>thly.</HI> He was mild and condescending, and never treated with contemptuous language, any person that behaved with propriety, or ad∣dressed him with decency. He had none of that <HI>hautier</HI> of office, so frequently discovered in some men, who are in exalted stations; he was always accessible, at suitable times by the private soldier, and the poorest citizen.</P>
<P>8<HI>thly.</HI> He was humane and merciful. No unnecessary punishment appeared in our army; he always pardoned when consistent with pru∣dence, and the good of the service would pos∣sibly admit of it.</P>
<P>9<HI>thly.</HI> He was temperate, and decent in all his deportment. No noisy, indecent, (much less impious)<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In 1777, he reproved a <HI>general officer</HI> at his table, for at∣tempting to ridicule the ceremony of asking a blessing before they sat down to dinner, which ceremony Gen. Washington very politely asked a clergymen to perform, who had been in∣vited to dine with him.</NOTE> mirth was allowed in his pre∣sence; no excess nor luxury was permitted at
<PB N="25" REF="038000_0024_100FB0FE5B93EFC0"/>
his table; he conducted himself on every occa∣sion with <HI>uncommon propriety and decorum,</HI> and evinced to all, that he was not only the wise statesman, and the great commander, but that he was <HI>really</HI> a gentleman.</P>
<P>10<HI>thly.</HI> He was charitable and generous. His secretary informed <HI>me</HI> in New York, that during his residence in that city, he distributed to the common objects of distress that resorted to his house for relief, upwards of a guinea every day; besides what he gave occasionally in larg∣er amounts to persons of worth, who had been reduced to poverty. Let his generous gifts to charity schools in his life time,—Let the ample donations in his will, for similar purposes, and the advancement of learning, declare that Washington was charitable and generous.—HIS WILL Ah! let HIS WILL, prove that he possessed a beneficient heart. What sweet e∣motions of philanthrophy moved in his breast while he penned that <HI>heaven-inspired</HI> sentence; ALL MY NEGROES ARE TO BE FREE? What soft benevolence flowed through his soul, when he made provision for the helpless infancy, and decrepid age that should be found among them? While I am reciting these magnanimous acts of Washington; I catch some of his generous spirit, and am ready to exclaim; happy slaves! thrice happy master! and to raise my heart to the GREAT ETERNAL in devout supplication; that he would be pleased to incline the hearts of those in similar circumstances, <HI>to imitate so noble an example.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="038000_0025_100FB1018AEE9580"/>
11<HI>thly. He had a deep and solemn reverence for God and religion.</HI> During his residence in Philadelphia, he generally kept a BIBLE open, in a private apartment, to which he used to resort;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The author of this discourse was stationed at Philadel∣phia in 1794 as a preacher in that Church of which he is a member; and received the above recited fact through a channel which leaves <HI>in his mind</HI> no doubt of its authenticity.</NOTE> He frequently attended public pray∣ers, and preaching in the army; and as we had chaplains of different denominations, he gave a proof that his mind was not confined with narrow bigotry, by attending at conveni∣ent opportunities, the prayers at the different brigades, and regiments. While he resided in New York, and Philadelphia he regularly attended divine service in that church of which he was a member. Let it be remembered to his praise, that he always attributed to the su∣perintending <HI>providence of God,</HI> the success of every measure both civil and military. The answers to <HI>all</HI> the numerous addresses presented to him on his first elevation to the Presidental chai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>—All his proclamations—All his public addresses to the army—To our citizens—To the world, all jointly conspire to testify, that he acknowledged, and <HI>felt</HI> his dependance on the DEITY for assistance, and direction in the performance of every duty to which he was called. In a word; although many have been equally brave as soldiers—Equally patriotic as citizens; while some have been equally chari∣table and generous, mild and humane, while
<PB N="27" REF="038000_0026_100FB105504E4160"/>
others have been equally wise, unambitious, or pious; I have not known; I have not heard of; I have not read of, <HI>one man</HI> in whom, all these qualities and virtues have been concen∣tered as in our Washington. And to close our description of his character in the words of an∣other. "Whether we view him in the field or the cabinet; the shade of retirement or chair of state, he is ever the same. Great and pow∣erful in command. A hero in the day of bat∣tle. In victory mild and merciful. In policy, uniting perfection of system with grandeur of design. Firm and unshaken in the face of dan∣ger, and storm of adversity. Uniting and blending with all; gentleness and simplicity of manners. With pure and bright morality.—"And thus forming a character as well cal∣culated to inspire confidence; command res∣pect, and benefit his country, as ever was ex∣hibited by a mortal man."—Then let love and gratitude enroll his name among the wise, the honourable, and the virtuous of every age.—And the people of America to the latest gene∣rations, shall speak of Washington with vene∣ration and delight. He died on the 14th of December, 1799; had he lived to this day he would have been 68 years old. He died with composure of mind, without any dread of death. We hope; we humbly hope; <HI>we have reason to hope, he is gone to</HI> GOD.</P>
<P>To conclude—We are not called to the com∣mand of armies, or to fill the chair of state▪ but we are called to be good citizens; let us then imitate our departed Washington, in
<PB N="28" REF="038000_0027_100FB106D86C1728"/>
obeying the laws of our country; in promoting its welfare by every laudable means in our pow∣er. Let us practice all the relative and social virtues as he has done before us; let us be hu∣mane and temperate, and mild and condescend∣ing, and charitable and generous, let us fill up our several stations with duty and dignity; with propriety and decency. We are called to be christians, let us then prize in our judg∣ments, and obey in our practice, the sacred truths, and holy precepts in the word of GOD.</P>
<P>We are called this day by the providence of GOD; by the death of Washington; and the voice of the preacher, to remember, THAT WE ARE TO DIE. That in a few years at most our bodies will be carried on men's shoulders, and lodged in the cold and silent tomb, and our souls shall wing their flight into a dreadful, or, a glorious eternity; where we must lie down in unabating sorrows, or, be raised to everlasting joys. Let us remem∣ber that it is our duty and our privilege; our wisdom and our interest, to be prepared for those solemn scenes. "Let our faith this day be to us as the <HI>evidence</HI> of things not seen," and bring home to our hearts an impressive view <HI>of our near approach</HI> to the world of spirits; and while solemnity rests on our minds, let us raise our hearts to GOD in fervent prayer; that he would be pleased to enlighten our minds by the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> to a discovery of our wretched and guilty state; of the evil and malignant na∣ture of sin; and excite in us answerable affec∣tions to this view of ourselves; that we may
<PB N="29" REF="038000_0028_100FB10987C2E0A0"/>
detest every evil way, and turn to the Lord our God; and under a deep consciousness of the <HI>just desert</HI> of our transgressions, that we may apply to, and believe in, the meritorious mediation of the adorable Jesus, for the remis∣sion of sins that are past. And being thus brought into the favour of GOD, we may from love and gratitude be "stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord;" that we may "increase in the knowledge, and love of GOD;" and through mercy and grace, attain a <HI>meetness</HI> to be partakers of the inheri∣tance of the saints in light, that when our spi∣rits are disembodied, we may join those holy souls who have left this world before us, in adoring, and praising the GOD of our salvation. GOD grant it for Christ's sake.</P>
