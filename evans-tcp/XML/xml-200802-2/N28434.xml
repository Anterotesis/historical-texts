<HEAD>AN ORATION.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>FELLOW CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>UNITED AMERICA assemble this day to pay their last respects to the admired hero and sage, the father of his country, the friend of mankind. He hath resigned his spirit into the hand of his maker. "He lives only in his own great actions, and in the hearts of an affectionate and afflicted people."</P>
<P>A FAITHFUL history of his life, and an impar∣tial delineation of his public and private virtues, would be the only eulogy worthy of WASHINGTON. But who can define that sublime philosophy which directed and animated all his actions—his genius enriched with information and fruitful in resources —his wisely concerted and well executed plans! Who can describe his purity of morals, dignity of manners, mildness and equanimity, patience in ad∣versity and moderation in prosperity, firmness in danger and perseverance in difficulties! If, in the sketch of his history and character, a strong affec∣tion for the man should appear, blended with a rev∣erence for his talents, your candor and the sympa∣thy of your feelings will be the speaker's apology.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="037886_0003_100F61FF308CD158"/>THIS day completes sixty eight years since the parish of Washington, in the county of Westmore∣land, in Virginia, gave birth to this great man. He was educated by private instruction. An excel∣lent understanding early convinced him of the ad∣vantages of virtue, the pleasure of knowledge, and the necessity of labor. An uncommon mildness and moderation of temper preserved him from the as∣saults of passion, and the allurements of vice. By the natural strength and superiority of his genius, without experience, he broke out at once a gene∣ral and a hero. At the age of twenty-three, he was sent, by his native state, with the command of four hundred men against the French, in the vicin∣ity of the Ohio, who had committed many acts of hostility against the British subjects. Attacked at Redstone, by an army nearly four times as nume∣rous as his own, valiant as Achilles, he made a brave defence, killed two hundred of the enemy, and obliged the French to grant him an honorable capitulation. The masterly manner in which he soon after covered the retreating army of Gen. Braddock, drew upon him the highest encomiums from his country. Through the whole of that war, he displayed an energy of character, which presa∣ged, that he might be designed by Providence for a future saviour of his country.</P>
<P>IN the Congress of 1775 he was distinguished by every deference, which superior merit is sure to re∣ceive from noble minds. He felt an early indigna∣tion at the oppressions of the British. The com∣mand
<PB N="5" REF="037886_0004_100F62018B270AA0"/>
of her armies being intrusted to him by his country, he accepted it from duty, relinquishing the enjoyments of affluence, and the highest domes∣tic felicity. Having no interested views, the friends of liberty reposed the highest confidence in his abil∣ities and integrity. How well this confidence was placed, every page of our revolution bears glori∣ous attestation. What difficulties did he not en∣counter? What danger did he decline? Who has marked his fortitude in the hour of adversity, with∣out hoping relief from his prudence? Who has beheld him in battle, without confiding in the wis∣dom of his arrangements, and reposing on the val∣or of his arm? Who, among his followers, did not find his sufferings solaced in seeing them shared by his chief? Those can best describe his military character, who followed him in his expeditions, who studied his marches, his encampments, his dis∣positions before a battle, and his courage in the heat of conflict; who beheld him penetrating, at a glance, the projects of the enemy, multiplying around them almost inevitable ambushes, creating and preserving a happy discipline in his army, ex∣citing, by new and efficacious methods, the ardor of his soldiers, and unremittingly exerting himself for their preservation.</P>
<P>TO view him as a perfect model of military great∣ness, to rank him with the greatest generals of any age, is no amplification. In him were blended ac∣tivity, vigilance, great force of judgment, and never failing presence of mind. He could unite in∣formation
<PB N="6" REF="037886_0005_100F620327962BA8"/>
with talents, reflection with experience, and stratagem with glory. Cautious, systematic, and inflexible, his genius was singularly adapted to our revolutionary war. Distinguishing, with pre∣cision, the difference between great difficulties and impossibilities, and never discouraged by the for∣mer, he often appeared to execute the latter. In∣defatigably laborious and active, coolly intrepid in action, he discerned as by intuition, seized with ra∣pidity, and improved with skill, the favorable, and often decisive, moments of battle. Never trans∣ported by the enthusiasm of patriotism, never de∣luded by the ardor of courage, he preferred strata∣gem to action, and victory to glory. Modest and magnanimous after victory, he became the gene∣rous protector of his subdued and captive enemies. Resolute and undejected in misfortunes, he rose su∣perior to distresses, and surmounted difficulties, which no courage, no constancy, but his own, would have resisted. His letters, during his most gloomy prospects, announce a hero, conscious of his danger, but still deriving a well grounded hope from the resources of his own mind. His valor was never unequal to his duty or the occasion. He attempted great things with means that appeared totally inadequate, and successfully prosecuted what he had boldly resolved. He was never disheartened by difficulties, but had that vigor of mind, which, instead of bending to opposition, rises above it, and seems to have a power of controling even fortune itself. His character combined a cool and pene∣trating judgment and prompt decision, caution and
<PB N="7" REF="037886_0006_100F6205894F3590"/>
intrepidity, patience and enterprise, generous ten∣derness and compassion, with undaunted heroism. He was a never failing resource to those who want∣ed his assistance. No one could have more happily concentrated the confidence of his troops. Their obedience was less owing to the authority of his post, than to their opinion of his valor; so attach∣ed to him were the officers and soldiers, that if a principle of duty and virtue had not secured their obedience to their country, gratitude and respect for their general would have confirmed it. Even when worn out with fatigue they were ever ready to execute his orders, and no danger could intimi∣date them when they were commanded by WASH∣INGTON. He himself always shared in the toils he was obliged to impose, visited in person the sick and the wounded, and expressed, on every occa∣sion, the greatest regard for a body of men, whose welfare was so closely connected with that of his country. By the strictest rules he labored to inspire them with a sense of duty, and neglected no cir∣cumstance which might render them formidable to their enemies. He was eloquent, persuasive, strong, and pathetic, as occasion required. He had argu∣ments and tears at his command. In a word, he was a general formed by heaven for just such a pe∣riod, country, and cause, as ours. And you too well know to be informed, that his great talents and patriotism, his equally judicious and vigorous measures, effected the salvation of his country, and commanded the admiration and applause of the whole world.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="037886_0007_100F62098D6F83A0"/>AFTER the ratification of a treaty of peace, which satisfied our most sanguine wishes and expectations, he resigned his commission, enjoying the pleasing hope of spending the residue of his days in the re∣treats and occupations of private life. Having pass∣ed in a rapid revolution from the dangers of slavery to the possession of liberty, the whole country, in the transports of gratitude, forgot their own mighty exertions, the influence of general causes, and the irresistible energy of man fighting for free∣dom, and ascribed their success to the virtues and talents of WASHINGTON.</P>
<P>THE character of this great man would be im∣paired by a comparison with the most distinguished generals either of ancient or modern times. <HI>Alex∣ander, Charles</HI> of Sweden, and <HI>Kouli Khan,</HI> were born with an insatiable thirst for human blood, and habituated, from their infancy, to the most inhu∣man actions. Their immoderate ambition made them the scourge of mankind and the pest of the world.—<HI>Hannibal's</HI> talents and victories were tar∣nished by cruelty, treachery, and a total disregard to truth, honor, and morality.—<HI>Julius Caesar</HI> was provident in council, fearless in action, humane and generous to excess; but his glory was sullied by an inordinate love of pleasure, and an unbounded ambition. His great talents would have made him the first citizen of Rome; but he disdained the con∣dition of a subject. The great object of his life was to rule, and Cato very justly remarked, that "he came, with sobriety and meditation, to the subversion
<PB N="9" REF="037886_0008_100F620BDEBBC088"/>
of the republic."—None ever exhibited greater bravery in dangerous undertakings, or more pres∣ence of mind and conduct in their execution, than <HI>Trajan</HI>; but the praises of Alexander, blazoned by a succession of panegyrists, kindled a dangerous emulation in his mind. "Like him," says Gibbon, "the Roman emperor undertook an expedition against the nations of the east; but he lamented, with a sigh, that his advanced age scarcely left him any hopes of equalling the renown of the son of Phillip."—<HI>Charles the first</HI> of France, <HI>Edward the third</HI> of England, and the Emperor <HI>Charles the fifth,</HI> displayed astonishing military talents, and were not less illustrious in the cabinet than in the field. But the first wantonly massacred 4500 Saxons sole∣ly for their loyalty to their prince. He appeared to regard truth, justice, and humanity, only as impor∣tunate monitors, which should be kept at a distance, or punished for their intrusion. The love of glory was the ruling passion of the two last, to the grati∣fication of which they sacrificed the interests of their country, and every sentiment of humanity.—<HI>Fred∣erick the second</HI> and the <HI>Duke of Marlborough</HI> were, perhaps, perfect masters of the military art. Ha∣ving been, from their childhood, continually in war, and at the head of armies, they joined to all the capacity which genius could give, all the knowledge and skill whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h experience could teach. But the former "slaughtered the armies of half the nations of Eu∣rope, merely to extend the limits of an electorate," and, being an open conspirator against the religion of JESUS, infected the world with his impieties—the
<PB N="10" REF="037886_0009_100F28C24683B980"/>
latter, hurried to excess by the violence of his pas∣sions, was much less fitted to prevent evils by his wise precautions, than to remedy them by his vigor and enterprise.</P>
<P>NONE of these heroes could claim the assemblage of coolness and spirit, humanity and munificence, prudence and vigor, patient unshaken constancy, untainted patriotism and superiority to popular clam∣or, which distinguished the Father of our country. None of them established the freedom and inde∣pendence of his nation; or exchanged the instru∣ments of war for the implements of husbandry; or was rewarded by the honest pride of virtue, the exquisite delight of beholding the general hap∣piness of which he was the author. The com∣manders of armies are taught, by the example of WASHINGTON, that well earned military applauses may be preserved, without power or splendor, in private life.</P>
<P>RESTORED to his endeared retirement, and to those rural occupations which constituted his great∣est enjoyment, he was scarcely permitted to repose from the fatigues of the war, when the imperious voice of his country again summoned him to her assistance. The confederation, formed under the pressure of foreign war and domestic distress, was found incompetent to the ends proposed, and both the honor and happiness of the United States requi∣red a reformation. For this purpose a convention was called in the year 1787, of which he was cho∣sen President. His opinions and example, at this
<PB N="11" REF="037886_0010_100F6210C5940A20"/>
time, largely contributed to a spirit of national ac∣commodation, and secured an harmonious acquies∣cence in our present system of federal government. Invited by his fellow-citizens to organize and ad∣minister this government, he complied, without bal∣ancing a moment between personal considerations and public duty. His acceptance was the presage of a prosperity, which was to remedy the evils of in∣ternal dissensions and a feeble government. Cling∣ing to him as the anchor of their hope, the people were not disappointed. Of the ability and integrity with which he discharged the functions of this high and arduous office, the public voice and public re∣gret bear ample and merited testimony. It may, indeed, be truly said, that the annals of no nation record a series of services, commensurate in their consequences, with those, which he rendered his country, during his administration. To an unex∣tinguished ardor for the public good, he joined a perseverance in the pursuit of it, which subdued all obstacles. His genius, adequate to every trying occasion, appeared to expand as difficulties occur∣red. His discerning judgment filled the several de∣partments of state with officers of approved merit, with whom he invariably consulted, before he of∣ficially decided, on business of moment to his coun∣try. His well timed and efficient measures preserv∣ed us from the desolation and horrors of foreign and domestic war. Under his administration, the excellent organization of the different branches of the federal constitution, the judicious appointments, and the energy applied to all its operations, gave it a basis which secured the happiness and prosperity of our country.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="037886_0011_100F6213162E92D8"/>IN no situation did WASHINGTON appear more truly great than at the helm of our federal govern∣ment. Here he displayed an astonishing extent and precision of political talents, a disinterested integ∣rity, an incorruptible heart, a constant attention to the grand principles of rational liberty, and an in∣variable attachment to his country. His genius was equal to the most enlarged views, and minute de∣tails, of civil policy. A vigorous mind, improved by the experience and study of mankind, dexterity and application in business, a judicious mixture of liberality and oeconomy, steadiness to pursue his ends, and flexibility to vary his means, marked his administration. He guided the passions of others, because he was master of his own. Had his char∣acter and feelings been more fervid, his conduct might not have been so exemplary, nor his glory so exalted and permanent. Patriotic from principle, and temperate from constitution, he neither disdain∣ed nor sought elevation; but always retained a hu∣mility, which demonstrated, even to political jeal∣ousy, that a man, capable of bearing so many hon∣ors, fully deserved them. He was provident with∣out timidity, severe in the execution of justice with∣out rigor, moderate when his own interests were the subject of discussion, and inflexibly firm when those of his country were in question. He stood a rock in the midst of the ocean, receiving unmoved the vi∣olence of its waves.</P>
<P>WHEN the revolving period of the third election of a President approached, he considered that duty no longer demanded a sacrifice of inclination, and
<PB N="13" REF="037886_0012_100F62149BC99A08"/>
published his valedictory address to the people of the United States. In this second resignation he ap∣pears superior to ancient or modern examples. Oth∣ers have, indeed, relinquished offices of equal trust; but, generally, the vicissitudes of fortune, and the disappointment of their favorite schemes, urged them to abdicate a power, which they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound inade∣quate to their ambition.</P>
<P>THE American leader now consoled himself with the reflection, that he had entirely quitted the con∣stant anxiety and high responsibility of public life. Minds long exercised in business rarely form habits of conversing with themselves, and, in the loss of power, principally regret the want of occupation. But retirement was natural and delightful to WASH∣INGTON. He discharged the duties of a private cit∣izen with a condescension and greatness of mind peculiar to himself. He had, however, been too long in the public service to enjoy, without diminu∣tion, the comforts and security of retirement. "Angry clouds began to rise:" And it was impos∣sible, that he could be unaffected with the afflictions and dangers of his country. At the public call he a∣gain came forward to direct and command our ar∣mies, exhibiting another proof of unrivalled great∣ness. On this pinnacle of earthly glory he stood, "venerable in services as in years, the cement and bulwark of our nation," till he was summoned to join <HI>the armies in heaven.</HI></P>
<P>THE private character of this great man emi∣nently corresponded with the splendor of his pub∣lic
<PB N="14" REF="037886_0013_100F621670C248D8"/>
reputation. The native simplicity of his virtue was a stranger to vanity or affectation. He enjoyed, with moderation, the advantages of his fortune, and the innocent pleasures of society. He was se∣vere to himself, indulgent to the imperfections of others, just and beneficent to all mankind. Sin∣cerity and candor, a true sense of honor, justice, and public liberty, appeared to be the inherent prin∣ciples of his nature, and the uniform rule of his conduct. The largeness of his heart equalled that of his fortune. Without thinking of his own greatness, without fearing lest others should forget it, he was easy of access, untainted with rancor or jealousy, and ever ready to listen to just complaints. "He appears," indeed, "to have been the com∣plete model of that perfect character, which, un∣der the denomination of a sage or a wise man, the philosophers have been fond of delineating, rather as a fiction of their imagination, than in hope of ever seeing it reduced to practice—so happily were all his virtues tempered together, so justly were they blended, and so powerfully did each prevent the other from exceeding its proper bounds." In a word, co-temporary jealousy, envy, and malignity, were com∣pelled to applaud both his public and private char∣acter, and more impartial posterity will read it with admiration.</P>
<P>HIS fortitude, in the last scene of his invaluable life, gave an illustrious stamp to the traits he had exhibited. Oppressed by grievous pain, he breath∣ed his last with the sublime tranquillity of a good man, conscious of having devoted his talents to the service of virtue and mankind.</P>

<P>SUCH was the man for whom our country mourns. Humanity cannot withhold her tears. We have been deprived of our brightest ornament, of the guide and patron, on whose wisdom, experience, and harmonizing influence, we could implicitly rely. To him as the author of our independence, and, while he lived, its firm support, our reverence is particularly due. "He could pass through no A∣merican state, survey no field, and tread on no spot of ground, which he did not save from devasta∣tion." He could "mix with no assembly, visit no family, and accost no person, who must not say, <HI>Our freedom, our peace, our safety, we owe first to God, and next to you."</HI> He could "turn his ear to no sound of joy, which he had not a share in exciting; and open his eye to no scene of comfort, which did not trace him as its origin." Like the central orb of the planetary world, he enlightened and anima∣ted, cemented and beautified, our whole political system. With a skilful, steady, yet gentle, hand, he moulded a confused mass of discordant materials in∣to one regular and harmonious compound. And by a strictly just and paternal administration, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e dif∣fused the blessings of freedom, tranquillity, public and private prosperity, throughout all classes of peo∣ple.</P>
<P>HAD he been asked by what posthumous honors we should best commemorate his services, he would
<PB N="16" REF="037886_0015_100F621CE4CCF988"/>
have replied: "Support your government. Resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its first prin∣ciples, however specious the pretexts. In all the changes to which you may be invited, remember, particularly, that for the efficient management of your common interest, in a country so extensive, a government of as much vigor as is consistent with the perfect security of rational liberty, is indispensi∣ble. Reverence religion and morality. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who would labor to subvert these great pillars of hu∣man happiness, and the firmest props of the duties of men and citizens. Promote institutions for the gen∣eral diffusion of knowledge. As an important source of strength and security, cherish public credit. Cul∣tivate peace and harmony with all nations. Exclude inveterate antipathies against some, and passionate attachments for others. The nation which indul∣ges towards another an habitual hatred or an ha∣bitual fondness, is a slave to its animosity or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to pervert it from its duty and interest. If I may flatter myself, that these counsels of an old, affectionate friend may be productive of some partial benefit, of some occa∣sional good—that they may sometimes recur to mod∣erate the fury of party spirit, to warn against the mischiefs of foreign influence, and to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism; this hope will be a full recompence for the solicitude for your your welfare by which they have been dictated."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Gen.
