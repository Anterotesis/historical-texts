<HEAD>AN EULOGY.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N the solemnity of the hour, you, my FELLOW TOWNS∣MEN, call upon me to paint the character and to portray the virtues of the favorite SON OF COLUMBIA. Una∣ble to rise to the height of his excellence, I must submit his merits to your knowledge of his actions; and lodge his worth in the grate∣ful affections of your hearts.</P>
<P>ON this day, sixtyeight years complete their revolutions, since our WASHINGTON was given to his country. The Parent of Being endowed him with superior powers of mind and body. These by the progress of time were expanded to the most commanding features of
<PB N="6" REF="036888_0004_100B2A0FC8E61380"/>
man. His clear and comprehensive under∣standing was improved by a general acquaint∣ance with science, an extensive knowledge of history, and an intimate view of human na∣ture. Possessing these grand principles of knowledge, he early discovered a happy genius to apply them to practice. His opinions were always formed upon an high scene of observa∣tion. His capacity can be measured only by the sphere in which he moved. Elevated of∣fices he filled with dignity▪ and difficult un∣dertakings he accomplished with renown.</P>
<P>HIS youthful essay of enterprise and patrio∣tism displayed the bold lines of his character, and gave a sure pledge of his meridian splen∣dor. Commissioned to carry, to an encroach∣ing enemy, on a distant frontier, the just re∣monstrances of his government; he sustained the fatigues and dangers of the embassy with the constancy of the veteran soldier; with Vauban's penetration he traced the site of the fortress which was to be the future protection of the country; he conciliated the irritated minds of the Indian Tribes; and, on his re∣turn, bore honorable testimony of the address and fidelity with which he executed his mis∣sion.
<PB N="7" REF="036888_0005_100B2A1410B42368"/>
The province of his nativity appreciat∣ed the merit of his service, and appointed him to command the troops embodied to enforce his remonstrance. His maiden sword was not unsheathed in vain: In his first campaign the laurel was entwined, that since has flourished around his temple with perennial, with en∣creasing verdure.</P>
<P>ON the next summer, General BRAD∣DOCK commanded a well appointed army to repel the French from their encroachments, and we find WASHINGTON an extra Aidde∣camp in his family. His knowledge of the country, his acquaintance with the Indian mode of warfare, enabled him to give advice, which might have insured success to the expedition: But the European General, in the pride of pro∣fessional skill, spurned the advice of the Ameri∣can Youth; and for his temerity, he lost his life, and his defeated army was indebted to the prudence and bravery of our Young Hero for their preservation from ruin.</P>
<P>IN the subsequent campaigns, the fatigues of the field became oppressive to a constitution not yet grown into the firmness of manhood. Pulmonary symptoms warned him to retire to
<PB N="8" REF="036888_0006_100B2A15968722B8"/>
the care of his friends. This interval was em∣ployed to form and strengthen the social ties, to cultivate and exercise the social affections, and to follow the leading bias of his mind in the pursuits of philosophy and practical agri∣culture.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH warmly attached to domestic life, and supremely happy in his family, he was not permitted to enjoy the pleasures of philosophic retirement. Heaven devoted him to the pub∣lic, and the public demanded his care and labor.</P>
<P>FROM the close of the French war, to the commencement of public resistance to the im∣positions of the British Parliament, the ju∣dicial concerns of his country, and the milita∣ry and legislative transactions of his province, engrossed his time. When the affairs of our country approached their crisis, and the wis∣dom of our nation was collected to decide her destiny, among an assembly as august and venerable as America ever saw, was our Patri∣ot. When the appeal was made to the sword, by the unanimous will of this body, he was placed at the head of our armies. With a "band of undisciplined husbandmen," he re∣strained the operations of a veteran army;
<PB N="9" REF="036888_0007_100B2A182C110568"/>
with nine rounds of powder to a man, he, for six months, confined them to their quarters;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Gen. WASHINGTON'S Letter to the President of Congress.</NOTE> and, when his stock of ammunition warranted the attempt, he drove them from the fortified capital of this Common wealth.</P>
<P>YE Veterans, who followed his standard and fought under his banner, ye best can recount the arduous conflicts of the subsequent years of his military command. Ye can inform us of the fortitude he exhibited when every heart was despondent—the abilities he displayed as a commander—the appearances he assumed to deceive the enemy at the hazard of his own reputation—the constancy with which he persisted in his own system of war, though urg∣ed to desperate enterprises by the ardent and sanguine. Ye saw his undaunted spirit, his boundless resources in the day of defeat; and beheld his moderation and humanity in the hour of victory. Ye can witness, that in him ambition was ever an incitement to the noblest actions.</P>
<P>HIS military triumphs complete—Amer∣ican Independence acknowledged, and his country visited with the beams of peace, he
<PB N="10" REF="036888_0008_100B2A1A670A9160"/>
carried into the shade of retirement, the affec∣tion and confidence of his army, the gratitude of his country, and the applause of the world.</P>
<P>WE thought he had then attained the zenith of human glory. The prayer of his warmest friend, on this point, was summed in the pe∣tition, may no unpropitious event take place to fully the lustre of his atchievements; in quietness may he descend to the grave, the lau∣rel unwithered on his brow.</P>
<P>NOT so the will of heaven. The decree had been registered in the divine archives, that A∣merica was free and independent: The Amer∣ican Joshua had led his people into the prom∣ised land: But the band was wanting which might unite the parts of the nation: Our Re∣public was destitute of the necessary principle, to give energy to her powers and force to her will. Among the Sages who arose to fix the centre of attraction to our political bodies, and to mark the zone, in which the sun of our na∣tional life and power should revolve, was our Patriot, first among equals. Their system we adopted, as the ark of our political safety, a∣midst the deluge of popular factions, whose torrents had swept every preceding Republic
<PB N="11" REF="036888_0009_100B2A1CCB38DD20"/>
from the face of the earth. Through United America there was but one voice respecting the man who should preside in its administration.</P>
<P>THE experiment of a Republican form of government was then to be decisively made; and the world in solemn silence attended the issue. On the dawn of an administration, in which new paths were to be explored, first principles adopted, and precedents established, the friends of our Statesman were tremblingly alive. But this new sphere of public action displayed talents, which before had not fully been called into exercise. With the eye of in∣tuition, he surveyed the relations of his coun∣try, and with his own integrity and firmness pursued her interests. Under his auspices, the salutary maxim was confirmed, that a sacred regard to moral obligations, the observance of public faith, the undeviating adherence to the plain rules of truth and rectitude, are more certain pledges of national attachment, and surer principles of success, than the subtilest intrigues and artifices of the Machiavilian Pol∣itician. Moments indeed there were, when we heard the hoarse clamors of disappointed ambi∣tion; and saw the dark movements of the sons
<PB N="12" REF="036888_0010_100B2A1E89D62488"/>
of faction and anarchy: But experience tested the wisdom of his measures; and the tide of public respect and gratitude set with encreasing fulness and force. The fame of the President of the United States is equalled only by the glory of the General of the American Armies. In every future period of our national exist∣ence, the instruction to the Military Com∣mander, and the charge to the Political Guide, will be comprised in one sentence, GO, IM∣ITATE OUR <HI>WASHINGTON.</HI></P>
<P>WITH an equal mind our venerable coun∣tryman descended from his elevation. He was not corrupted by the power and influence of office. He consented to become the head of his nation from a sense of the duty he owed his country: Every public obligation fulfill∣ed, he gladly resorted to his beloved retire∣ment. This act was pronounced by a cele∣brated English Philosopher, as the consumma∣tion of character; as the last evidence of the greatness of the man.</P>
<P>HE was not long permitted, by his presence to irradiate the circle of private life; by the smiles of his countenance to cheer the hearts of his friends and dependants. <HI>His</HI> sun was
<PB N="13" REF="036888_0011_100B2A21E0F8FE88"/>
not to set in private, whose light rose with public splendor, and shone with encreasing lustre to the perfect day. The majesty of our nation was insulted—her rights of sovereign∣ty were invaded, and she summmoned her venerable chief to her aid. His mind, as true to the principle of patriotism as the needle to the pole, obeyed the summons. He unsheath∣ed his sword, and in the post of danger stood collected to repel the aggressions, and to re∣venge the injuries o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an enemy, intoxicated with ambition, and insolent from success.</P>
<P>OUR illustrious Citizen was as much distin∣guished for the reverence of his GOD as for the love of his country. Religion had a lively in∣fluence on all the transactions of his life. In him we beheld piety without the gloomi∣ness of superstition; and devotion without the extravagance of enthusiasm.</P>
<P>DO you inquire into his private character? Follow him to his domestic walks; the scene of the quiet but refined virtues of man: With him enter the circle of his friends: Behold him in the bosom of his family: There you will see all the tender sensibilities of the human character; and witness the exercise of all the
<PB N="14" REF="036888_0012_100B2A247B000100"/>
offices of humanity and benevolence. The more beloved, the more known; as free from private as public blemish. So diffident of himself, as to be induced to engage in the ar∣duous duties of the field and cabinet, only from reliance on divine wisdom to aid good inten∣tions, and divine strength to succeed laudable exertions. So disinterested, as to refuse every pecuniary reward for a life of public labor. So unconscious of his own merits, as in aston∣ishment to look around for the origin of that fame, which every breath of air wafted to his ear.</P>
<P>SUCH was the man, whose death we deplore: As fortunate as great: As happy as good.</P>
<P>IN this period of expectation, when the con∣vulsions of the old world shake the stablest fabrics of antiquity; and threaten to lay pros∣trate the pillars of social order and national fe∣licity, we fondly hoped the life of our beloved Citizen might have been protracted. In his influence we confided to check the progress of dangerous opinions; and to counteract the contagion of pernicious principles. Under him, we reposed as the public shield, should our country be invaded, and our armies en∣countered in the field of battle. But he is
<PB N="15" REF="036888_0013_100B2A2704E9C448"/>
gone, never more to engage in works of patri∣otism and humanity. Neither accomplish∣ments of greatness, nor pursuits of dignity; public honors, nor national affection; exten∣sive wealth, nor domestic felicity, were a secu∣rity for his existence. That crisis is passed up∣on him, which Solon thought necessary to pro∣nounce a man happy. He died as he had liv∣ed. His mind was fortified for the event, not by the cold maxims of philosophy, but by the enlivening hopes of religion. The unassum∣ing disciple of the Prince of Life, to him the valley of death was illuminated by the beams of revelation: The prospect of exchanging the glory of this world, for an unfading, an immortal wreath, supported him through the last scene of humanity.</P>
<P>COMPARE this exit with the impious boast of the great Frederic of Prussia: "Glory is my Deity. Glory is the only reward of great actions which I expect. I dare challenge the resentment of Heaven; for by a voluntary death I can elude the power of GOD; and in vain will the Almighty hurl his thunderbolt a∣gainst my tomb."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This sentiment is contained in a treatise of the King of Prus∣sia on the subject of Glory, published at Berlin, and addressed to Marshal Keith.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="036888_0014_100B2A2972F51AE0"/>
IN the public legacy of the Father of our country, we have the means to support and perpetuate the fair fabric of national inde∣pendence and happiness, which his hand erect∣ed. His private Will testifies that the love of liberty in him was a living principle. He has undone the heavy burden and let the op∣pressed go free. As far as his power extended, he has given freedom to those unhappy beings, whom avarice first enslaved, and who are now holden in bondage by the plea of necessity.</P>
<P>DOES the page of history contain a name more illustrious than his? Did man ever close life with a reputation more immaculate? To compare him with those, whose progress of ambition was marked with blood, and whose greatness was erected upon the agonies of the human heart, is to profane his virtues.</P>
<P>IN other countries, individuals have been il∣lustrious as Heroes and Statesmen. The tal∣ents which immortalized their respective names were united in our American Alfred; and he was free from the vices and weaknesses, which were the shades of their characters. In him were combined the most excellent qualities of man; and in his life appeared an assemblage
<PB N="17" REF="036888_0015_100B2A2CACF1CC60"/>
of the noblest virtues of humanity. "His life was one stream of light," and the shadow of night rests not upon it. The picture of man in him was perfect, and there is no blot to tar∣nish its brightness.</P>
<P>HIS character we must all contemplate with supreme delight: In it we view the dignity of our nature; and the glory of our race. As an American character, we may all exult in it, as the ornament of our nation and the honor of our age. As the Patriot, whose exalted tal∣ents and preeminent endowments were devot∣ed to our country, we feel the obligations of public gratitude—we are melted to emotions of tenderness—we are disposed to express every mark of admiration and respect.</P>
<P>LET the sculptured marble preserve his re∣semblance, and the superb monument proclaim his achievements; these are but the decent ex∣pressions of the public mind. But the sculp∣tured marble and the costly monument are a∣like unnecessary to perpetuate his worth. His memory is embalmed in the affections of his grateful countrymen: His name is written in the book of immortal fame: He shall be had in everlasting remembrance.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="036888_0016_100B2A2E3335ECA0"/>
HIS country has appreciated his merits. By a consistency, as honorable to herself, as to him, her confidence has at no moment been withdrawn.</P>
<P>PRIVILEGED Mortal! endowed with heav∣en's best gifts; divinely supported in thy race of honor and glory: An enlightened and vir∣tuous country to recognize thy merits; and a world for thine admirer!</P>
<P>HAPPY Country! to whom Heaven grant∣ed this illustrious personage to be thy Leader and Father, when thou didst assume a name and a place among the nations of the earth.</P>
<P>CLOTHE thyself with mourning, O America! thy brightest ornament is faded: Dead is thy exalted, thy most beloved Son: Bow your heads, ye Warriors, in sorrow! silent is that voice which waked the thunder of the battle; cold is the heart which animated you to victo∣ry and glory. Weep, ye fair Daughters of Columbia! weep in sympathy with her, from whom is removed the greatest and the best of men; whose residue of life must be dark and solitary.—Weep for yourselves, your Protect∣or is no more! While alive he never oppressed the heart of tenderness, nor caused the tear of
<PB N="19" REF="036888_0017_100B2A309368D388"/>
distress to fall from the eye of sensibility! Through lust of triumph, he never made the wife a widow, or the child an orphan: He never consumed the widow's morsel, or the or∣phan's bread. His conquests were those of humanity: His power was ever exercised in defence of innocence and virtue. Bedew then his urn with the tear of gratitude! Teach your children to lisp his praise: Instil into their minds his spirit; and cherish in them the growth of his virtues.</P>
<P>DWELL, ye Youth, on his merits, till you rise to admiration of his character! Enkindle in your hearts the love of country: Fan in your Souls the fire of Patriotism: Like him reverence your Maker: Regard moral obliga∣tions: Covet his endowments: Emulate his purity, his integrity and disinterestedness. Then shall you rise up to fill the honorable stations of society; and your country will call you blessed.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Two hundred and fifty male youth, between the age of eight and eighteen years, walked by themselves in the procession of the day, and were seated in the galleries of the Meeting house.</NOTE></P>
<P>Is the light of our nation extinct? or have we bodies which will shine only in the absence of our Sun?</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="036888_0018_100B2A32459E1C40"/>
WISDOM, PATRIOTISM and VIRTUE, are the natural growth of our country. Pursue, my Fellow Citizens, the system which has es∣tablished our nation. Transmit inviolate to posterity, our fair national inheritance. Raise characters of worth to elective offices: Then, as an ADAMS has succeeded a WASHING∣TON, to him shall succeed an uninterrupted line of illustrious Statesmen and Patriots.</P>
<P>WHILE on this day, we join in condolence with United America, let the feelings of mourn∣ing be blended with those of gratitude to GOD, who made our countryman the greatest public blessing. Let the grateful tribute be presented on the altar of Heaven, that his in∣valuable life was preserved in every hour of danger—that his magnanimous labors were crowned with success—that he lived to wit∣ness the encreasing prosperity of his nation—to be hailed the Savior of his country—to wear the testimonials of public affection and grati∣tude—to find his happiness, in the happiness of those to whose interests he devoted his life—that he retained his powers nearly to the al∣lotted period of human existence; and was taken from the world without feeling the de∣cripitude

of age, or suffering the degradation of a second childhood.</P>
<P>SUCH was thy will, Heavenly Parent! In the exalted mind and dignified character of thy deceased Servant, we adore thy work: Through thy benignant influence his services were made a rich national blessing. May his example form future public characters of wisdom and virtue: And of thy mercy grant, the success of his measures, to every administration of our government, till time shall be no more.</P>
