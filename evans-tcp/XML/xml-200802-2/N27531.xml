<P>IN page 255 a fact is stated which contradicts the statement respect∣ing the planet Mars in page 241. There is an error in one of the statements; and I leave astronomers to determin by calculations which of the authorities, Ames' Almanac for 1750, or the Annual Register, is wrong. The error is not material to my subject. The only question of consequence, is, whether the near approach of Mars had any influ∣ence, in producing the extreme heat of 1749 and 1766—a question I pretend not to determin.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<PB REF="036687_0005_100A89B1FA85D790"/>
<P>A PUBLICATION on the subject of diseases, from the pen of a man who has never before turn∣ed his attention to medical science or to chymistry, is a circumstance, which, if it does not require an apology, demands at least an explanation.</P>
<P>The prevalence of the catarrh, commonly called influenza, in the years 1789 and 90, first awakened my curiosity on the subject of epidemic diseases. A journey which I made in October 1789, from Hartford to Boston; and another in March 1790 from Hartford to Albany; led me to observe the <HI>progressiveness</HI> of that disease, with its other phe∣nomena.</P>
<P>The appearance of the scarlatina anginosa in 1793 revived my curiosity, and a similar circum∣stance, a journey from Hartford to New-York in April of that year, led me to observe a progression in that disease from West to East. A slight attack which my own children suffered, in May following, together with a similar attack of many other chil∣dren in Hartford, and its more violent effects some months after, convinced me that the epidemic was <HI>progressive</HI> in <HI>malignancy,</HI> as well as in regard to <HI>place.</HI></P>
<P>Had no other epidemic appeared, my curiosity would probably have subsided and been extin∣guished. The malignant fever in New-York in 1791, had excited alarm in that city, and was a
<PB N="vi" REF="036687_0006_100A89B575C36998"/>
subject of notice in Hartford where I then resided; but no idea had been conceived, that it was con∣nected with a pestilential state of the air, in the United States, which was afterwards to produce more serious and general calamities.</P>
<P>In autumn 1793 however that pestilential state of air arrived to its crisis in Philadelphia, where the mortality occasioned by the yellow fever, spread destruction and dismay, from August to Novem∣ber. The fatality of the disease spread consterna∣tion thro the United States, and excited apprehen∣sions in Europe.</P>
<P>No American citizen could be indifferent to the prevalence of this disease in his own country. Still it was conceived that the distemper might have been produced from imported infection, and that a more rigid execution of the laws relating to quarantine, might prevent a repetition of the calamity. Here rested apprehension and enquiry.</P>
<P>But this tranquillity was of short duration. The appearance of the same disease in New-Haven in 1794, and in New-York, Baltimore and Norfolk in 1795, revived my curiosity, with double zeal to search out the causes of these phenomena, so unusual in this country. The facts which had come to my knowledge, relating to the origin and prop∣agation of this disease, led me to suspect the com∣mon theory of <HI>infection</HI> to be ill-founded. But as a preliminary to all other enquiries, it appeared necessary to settle the controversy relative to the <HI>imported</HI> or <HI>domestic</HI> sources of the distemper; for without, a decision of this question, legislative and police-regulations, for preventing a return of the
<PB N="vii" REF="036687_0007_100A89B701BA2768"/>
evil, or mitigating its severity, would probably be fruitless. The question appeared to be extremely important, and the differences of opinion on the subject, among medical gentlemen, seemed to pre∣clude the possibility of a decision among them, that should silence doubts in the public mind.</P>
<P>In this situation of the controversy, I resolved to make an effort to obtain evidence which might de∣cide the point, in one way or the other; and as facts only can be relied on as a sure basis of prin∣ciples and theory, I determined to make a collect∣ion of facts, from all parts of the United States, where the yellow fever, or other malignant fevers had prevailed, during the preceding years. For this purpose, on the 31st of October 1795, I ad∣dressed a circular letter to the physicians of Phila∣delphia, New-York, Baltimore, Norfolk, New-Ha∣ven, and in general, throughout the United States, requesting them to communicate to me whatever facts had come within their observation, which could throw light on the question of the foreign or domestic origin of the yellow fever. In conse∣quence of which I received a number of commu∣nications, which were published in 1796, and to which is prefixed my circular letter.</P>
<P>These communications, tho less numerous and satisfactory than were desirable, united with a mul∣titude of facts within my own observation, <HI>convin∣ced</HI> me of the fallacy of the vulgar opinion, re∣specting the origin of the yellow fever in the Uni∣ted States, from imported sources. I found re∣peatedly that the reports of persons taken ill, in consequence of intercourse with vessels from the
<PB N="viii" REF="036687_0008_100A89B8888E3B38"/>
West-Indies, or with diseased seamen, infected cot∣ton or clothing, or the like causes, were mere idle tales, raised by the ignorant or interested, and wholly unsupported by evidence. Scarcely an in∣stance could be found, in which the evidence of the propagation of disease, from imported infection, was sufficient to render the fact even probable.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the evidence of the origina∣tion of the disease in New-York, Baltimore, Nor∣folk, Newburyport, Boston and Charleston, appear∣ed to be clear and satisfactory. In most of those places, the fact has never been questioned.</P>
<P>When the same disease appeared in Philadelphia in 1797; the question of importation or domestic origin, again agitated the faculty and the public. The revival of the discussion, and particularly, cer∣tain publications of Dr. William Currie, in the Philadelphia prints, called forth my exertions to unite opinions and save the citizens of this country from the distraction of measures, which must ne∣cessarily follow a division of opinions. I considered and still consider the question as resting principally on fact, and not on medical skill; therefore proper to be investigated and discussed by any man who has leisure and means, as well as by physicians.</P>
<P>These considerations gave rise to the observations which I addressed to Dr. Currie, thro the medium of the public papers, in the months of October, November and December 1797. The design of these observations was originally limited to the pur∣pose of proving the yellow fever of our country to be generated by local and domestic causes, by lay∣ing together the facts which I had collected from
<PB N="ix" REF="036687_0009_100A89BAD43D0F90"/>
various parts of the United States, without any in∣tention of examining the history and phenomena of pestilential diseases in other countries, and other periods of the world.</P>
<P>In pursuing this object however, I was led insen∣sibly to examin all the books I could find, on the subject of the plague; and the subject being new, I found too much pleasure in prosecuting it, readily to abandon the pursuit. Facts which were new to me were daily presenting themselves to my mind; and after three months investigation, I was persua∣ded that those facts are of too much importance to philosophy, to medicin and to human happiness, not to merit publication. Such is the origin of the present treatise.</P>
<P>When I began my enquiries into the origin of the yellow fever, in 1795, I had no preconceived system to maintain. My view was to collect facts and from them to deduce TRUTH. It is not my intention to advance theory over fact; but as far as just philosophy and sound logic will permit, draw theory from facts, and if possible, by fair reasoning, from the uniform operations of nature, to arrive at fixed principles. If conjectures should in any instance be advanced, they will be offered as such, and not as the basis of practice.</P>
<P>As there is a difference of opinion in regard to the causes of the plague, and other pestilential dis∣eases, as well as in regard to the identity of the yellow fever and plague, I shall define my manner of using certain terms, which will often occur in the following work.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="036687_0010_100A8A9181200E30"/>That pestilential disease which usually, in the Levant, produces swellings in the glands, as buboes, I shall call the <HI>glandular</HI> or <HI>inguinal</HI> plague.</P>
<P>The pestilential disease which has afflicted some of the cities in America, and is usually called yellow fever, I shall denominate, the <HI>bilious</HI> or <HI>American plague.</HI></P>
<P>In the Levant plague, swellings in the groin, in the arm-pits, and behind the ears, do not, in every case, appear; but they are the general distinguish∣ing marks of the true pestis or plague.</P>
<P>In the yellow fever, the skin is not, in every case, marked by a yellow color; but it is generally the fact, and therefore this form of pestilence may very well take its denomination from that circum∣stance of its bilious appearance.</P>
<P>Whether these are disease specifically distinct, or only the same disease varied and modified by cli∣mate, season or other circumstances. is a question that belongs to the faculty. It is sufficient for my purpose to observe, that in most of the symptoms, they agree—that they are pestilential and greatly to be dreaded by mankind. I shall therefore treat them as different forms of the same disease. There may be some cause for believing that the moisture of a country, abounding with woods, and marshy grounds, may occasion the difference in the color of bodies which fall victims to pestilence.</P>
<P>The words <HI>infection</HI> and <HI>contagion,</HI> are used by medical writers and in popular custom, as synony∣mous, and their etymologies warrant the practice. But I conceive there are distinctions in this quality or power of diseases, of communicating themselves
<PB N="xi" REF="036687_0011_100A8A93D1D10130"/>
by contact or near approach, which require to have each its appropriate language.</P>
<P>That quality of a disease which communicates it from a sick to a well person, on simply inhaling the breath or effluvia from the person of the diseased, at any time and in any place, maybe called <HI>specific contagion.</HI> Such is the contagion of the small-pox and the measles, which are therefore called <HI>conta∣gious</HI> diseases.</P>
<P>That quality of a disease which, tho insalutary will not communicate it, without the aid of other causes, as warm weather, or peculiar situation and habit of body, and which requires the healthful person to be a considerable time, under its influence, to give it effect, may be called <HI>infection.</HI> Such is the quality of the plague, in all its forms, dysen∣tery, and all typhus fevers. It may perhaps be possible for the effluvia of those who have these dis∣eases, to be so concentrated and virulent, as to communicate them to a person in health, by a sin∣gle inspiration of air into the lungs. But if such can be the case in any instance, it is not the ordi∣nary state of those diseases. Even in the plague, many attendants on the sick never receive the disease at all; and in most cases, healthful persons may, for hours, breathe the air of the rooms where the patients are, without any injury.</P>
<P>Hence infection is capable of all degrees of ac∣tivity and force, from a slight impurity of air, which affects no person in health, to that virulent state of air, which will produce vomiting in a per∣son suddenly exposed to it. <HI>Infection</HI> is usually ren∣dered inactive by severe cold; <HI>specific contagion</HI> is
<PB N="xii" REF="036687_0012_100A8A95613845C0"/>
never destroyed, but often rendered more active by cold. Hence the winter in northern latitudes usu∣ally puts an end to the plague, but makes no fa∣vorable alteration in the small-pox. There are some exceptions to this remark, as it regards the plague, which will be noticed in the following work.</P>
<P>These distinctions, which will appear, in the course of this treatise to be well founded, have never been defined or used by European physicians, so far as my information extends; and to the want of them, are to be ascribed many errors and absurdi∣ties in opinion, as well as warm controversies in re∣gard to the contagion of the plague.</P>
<P>That state of our atmosphere which produces disease, or disposes the body to disease, independ∣ent of other causes, I call <HI>general</HI> or <HI>primary</HI> conta∣gion. Synonymous with these phrases, will be used a pestilential state or constitution of the air.</P>
<P>The word <HI>pestilence</HI> may be used as synonymous with plague; or as expressing all kinds of conta∣gious and infectious epidemics. I have used it in both senses; and often to express an idea of that series of epidemics which are closely connected with the plague.</P>
<P>Whether these distinctions are just or not, is not very material; it is sufficient that they will express my ideas in the following treatise.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION I. Of the diversity of opinions respecting the cause and origin pestilence.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the date of the earliest historical records, the opin∣ions of men have been divided on the subject of the causes and origin of pestilential diseases. All enquiries of the philosopher and the physician have hitherto been baffled, and investigations, often repeated, have ended without leading to satisfactory con∣clusions.</P>
<P>In the history of opinions on this mysterious subject, there is a remarkable distinction between the ancients and moderns. The ancients derived most of their knowledge and science from personal observation, as they had very few books and little aid from the improvements of their predecessors. The philoso∣phers of antiquity, attentive to changes in the seasons and to the revolutions of the heavenly bodies, attempted to trace pesti∣lential diseases to extraordinary vicissitudes in the weather, and to the aspects of the planets. Modern philosophers and physi∣cians, on the other hand, unable to account for pestilence on the principle of extraordinary seasons, and disdaining to admit the influence of the planets to be the cause, have resorted to in∣visible animalculae, and to infection concealed in bales of goods or old clothes, transported from Egypt or Constantinople, and let loose, at certain periods, to scourge mankind and desolate the earth.</P>
<P>In both periods of the world, the common mass of people, usually ignorant and always inclined to believe in the marvellous,
<PB N="10" REF="036687_0014_100A8A9BDF922358"/>
have cut the Gordian knot of difficulty, by ascribing pestilence to the immediate exercise of divine power; under the impres∣sion that the plague is one of the judgments which God, in his wrath, inflicts on mankind to punish them for their iniquities.</P>
<P>Without deciding on the comparative merit of these respect∣ive opinions, it is sufficient to observe, that they are all probably incorrect; and those of the philosophers, altogether inadequate to explain the origin of pestilential Epidemics.</P>
<P>It may however be of use to insert, in this place, the expla∣nations of the cause of pestilence, given by some of the princi∣pal writers on the subject.</P>
<P>Hippocrates, the father of medical science, and a man of very acute observation, considered pestilence as the effect of partic∣ular seasons and winds. A pestilential state or constitution of air he describes, as occasioned by a continuation of southerly winds, and a warm, humid, clouded atmosphere.</P>
<BIBL>De morbis vulgaribus, lib. 3.</BIBL>
<P>Galen followed the same theory. He says that pestilent dis∣eases arise from a putridity of the air; and in another place, <HI>a coeli statu,</HI> from the state of the air or weather.</P>
<BIBL>p. 627, in Hippoc.—</BIBL>
<P>It will at once occur to an intelligent reader, that a particular description of weather, producing pestilence, must be principal∣ly calculated for a particular country or latitude. The state of seasons which Hippocrates calls <HI>pestilential,</HI> is evidently calcula∣ted to produce or augment autumnal diseases in temperate lati∣tudes; and is precisely the state of weather which existed in the United States in 1795, when the bilious plague prevailed in the cities of New-York, Baltimore and Norfolk. But it does not correspond with the season in 1793, when the same disease raged in Philadelphia; for that was excessively dry, nor with the summer of 1797, which was temperate, in respect to heat, cold and moisture.</P>
<P>Hippocrates indeed seems to have been aware that the seasons alone were not sufficient to account for pestilence, for he speaks of <HI>to theion,</HI> some divine principle in the air, by which modern
<PB N="11" REF="036687_0015_100A8A9D815C53E0"/>
writers of celebrity suppose to be intended what is now called an <HI>epidemic constitution,</HI> resulting from changes in the atmosphere produced by unknown causes. Aristotle prob. 1. relates that a hot and dry south wind will produce pestilence.</P>
<P>The philosophical warrior and historian, Ammianus Marcel∣linus, after mentioning a plague which broke out in Amida, a city of Persia, when besieged by Sapor A. D. 359, from the corruption of numerous dead bodies which lay unburied in the streets, proceeds to unfold the causes of pestilential distempers, in the following manner.</P>
<P>"Philosophers and eminent physicians have taught that pesti∣lence is produced by excess of heat or cold, of drouth of mois∣ture. Whence it is that those who live near wet and marshy places are subject to coughs, diseases of the eyes and the like. Those, on the other hand, who reside where the heat is great, are troubled with febrile complaints; and in proportion as the matter of fire is more active, drouth is more rapid in destroying life. Hence, during the war of ten years in Greece, this spe∣cies of disease prevailed, and it was said that men perished by the <HI>weapons of Apollo,</HI> by which was supposed to be meant, the <HI>heat of the sun.</HI> And, according to Thucydides, the mortality among the Athenians, in the beginning of the Peloponnesian war, was occasioned by an acute disease, which proceeded from the fervid regions of Ethiopia, and gradually extended to Attica.</P>
<P>"Others are of opinion that air, like water, vitiated by the effluvia of dead bodies, or similar substances, is deprived of its salubrity; or at least that a sudden change of air will product the more slight complaints. Some also affirm that the air, ren∣dered gross by a denser vapor from the earth, closing the pores of the body and checking perspiration, becomes fatal to the lives of some; for which reason, other animals than man, which are continually bending towards the earth, are the first victims to pestilence, as Homer testifies, and which is proved by many examples, during the prevalence of pestilential diseases.</P>
<P>"The first species of plague is called <HI>pandemic,</HI> and this af∣flicts most severely those who are subject to excessive heat, in hot regions. The second is denominated <HI>epidemic,</HI> which when
<PB N="12" REF="036687_0016_100A8AA08C795430"/>
it rages, obscures the sight and excites dangerous humors. The third Lamodes, which is temporary, but produces sudden death."</P>
<BIBL>Lib. 19.</BIBL>
<P>The historian has here explained the causes of ordinary dis∣eases, occasioned by extremes of weather, marsh effluvia, vitia∣ted air, and the direct action of violent heat, or stroke of the sun. No person will dispute the justness of his remarks, for the same causes, at this day, produce the same effects. But the causes assigned are not adequate to all the effects, which we wish to explain. They do not uniformly occasion pestilence; and on the other hand, pestilence sometimes rages without the influence of those causes.</P>
<P>Aetius, an eminent physician, about the close of the 5th cen∣tury, compiled the opinions and methods of cure practised by the most celebrated of his predecessors. In this compilation, entitled "Tetrabiblos," chap. ix. we find the following para∣graph on the subject of Epidemic diseases.</P>
<P>"Those are called popular or epidemic diseases, which spring from a common cause, as bad food or water, immoderate grief or want of customary exercise, hunger or repletion, especially when abundance succeeds extreme want. But the nature of the country often causes epidemic diseases: the air we breathe being vitiated by the evaporation from putrid substances. These sub∣stances are multitudes of dead bodies after battles, marshes or stagnant water in the vicinity, which emit poisonous and fetid vapours.—This cause is in continual operation. And the air which surrounds us, always changes its temperament, when it becomes immoderately hot or cold, dry or humid. To other causes we are not all equally exposed, nor at all times; but the circumambient air, when we are abroad, surrounds us all alike, and is inhaled with the breath.</P>
<P>"Sometimes the surrounding air, becoming unusually humid and hot, induces a pestilential constitution; and as humors, tending to putrefaction, are collected in the body by eating un∣wholesome food, this air becomes the source of a pestilential fever. Therefore if a person takes moderate exercise, and is
<PB N="13" REF="036687_0017_100A8AA297774360"/>
temperate and regular in his diet [victu modesto ac castigato] he wholly escapes all affections of this kind."</P>
<P>Such were the opinions of the physic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and philosophers of antiquity. No distinction appears to have been made by them, between the plague and other pestilential diseases. All were ascribed to the same causes.</P>
<P>At what time the distinction between <HI>Pestis</HI> and <HI>Pestilentia</HI> was first made, has not occurred to my enquiries. But I find it in the writings of Prosper Alpinus, a Venetian physician, who wrote about the close of the 16th century, and who had been, for some years, a practitioner in Egypt. This author maintains that pestilent fevers are occasioned by local causes, as vitiated air, and by peculiarities of season, as extreme heat and humid∣ity. But he asserts that the plague in Egypt rarely proceeds from corrupted air, and never, except after an unusual overflow∣ing of the Nile, when that river has exceeded its common bounds. He contends that if this disease was produced by noxious exhalations from putrid and stagnant water, and marshy places, it would occur every year. He therefore concludes for certain that the plague is usually imported from Greece, Syria, Barbary, or Turkey. "Plerumque igitur id genus morbi ibi contagio ex aliis locis asportari solet." The contagion of the plague is usually imported from other countries.</P>
<BIBL>Rerum. Egypt. vol. 2, p. 73, vol. 3, 61, and vol. 4, 299.</BIBL>
<P>The same author asserts that the plague brought from Barbary is more malignant and of longer duration, than when brought from Greece or Syria.</P>
<P>Diemerbroeck, an eminent Dutch physician of the last cen∣tury, has recorded an account of a violent plague in Nemueguen in 1636, and subjoined to it the best treatise on the origin of that disease, which I have been able to find, tho in one or two particulars, his ideas are very inaccurate. This author, whose treatise, I am surprised to find, is little known in this country, assigns three causes of the pestis or true plague. First, the just anger of heaven, provoked by the exhalations from the sinks of our sins and abominable deeds.

like a subtle fermentum or leaven, sent from heaven, in a very small quantity, diffusing itself through the air like a subtle gas, and rendering it impure. This gas, he supposes to spread over many regions its numerous particles, and to impress on the air an infection like poison, which often affects not only many persons, but almost the whole world.</P>
<P>However whimsical we may think this author's explanation of the pestilent principle; that some such general cause exists in the atmosphere, at certain periods, will be rendered very probable, if not certain, by the facts hereafter to be related.</P>
<P>The "seminarium e coelo demissum" of Diemerbroeck seems to be the <HI>to theion</HI> of Hippocrates. In what the essence of this principle consists, is not known; but there must be an alteration in the chymical properties of the atmosphere to solve the diffi∣culties that attend our inquiries into the cause of pestilence.— That this alteration is the effect of a poison, "e coelo demissum," is an hypothesis unsupported by facts and wholly incredible.</P>
<P>The third cause of pestilence, mentioned by this author, is infection.</P>
<P>Diemerbroeck also maintains the distinction between <HI>pestis</HI> and <HI>pestilentia.</HI> The latter is supposed to proceed from foul exhala∣tions, intemperate seasons and the like. But the plague, he contends, cannot be occasioned by those causes, tho these may aid the seminarium or general cause.</P>
<P>Van Helmont, a Flemish writer of some celebrity, in the last century, maintains that the plague cannot be ascribed to the "importunate and unseasonable changes of times, nor to pu∣trefaction;" that the "poison of the plague is a fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> secret one from any other;" that the "matter of that disease is a wild spirit tinged with poison, exhaling from a diseased person, or drawn inwards from a gas of the earth putrified by continuance, and receiving internally an appropriate ferment, and by degrees attaining a pestilent poison in us." "The remote, crude and first occasional matter of the pestilence, is an air putrified thro' continuance, or rather a hoary putrified gas, which putrefaction of the air, hath not the 8200th part of its seminal body." This explanation seems to be hardly intelligible.</P>

<P><PB N="15" REF="036687_0019_100A8AA7E6271AE8"/>This author contends that "the pest is not sent down from heaven, but that popular plagues do draw their first occasional matter from an earthquake, and from the consequences of camps and sieges."</P>

<P>Hodges, who wrote a treatise on the great plague in London in 1665, observes that the air suffers some essential alteration which is necessary to favor the propagation of pestilence. The nitro-aerial principle, which causes or in vigorates vegetable and animal life, sometimes becomes imperfect, degenerate or cor∣rupt, being tainted with something pernicious to vitality. He calls it poisonous, and observes that it proves injurious to trees and cattle, as well as to man. He supposes the corrupting prin∣ciple to be a subtle aura or vapor extricated from the bowels of the earth. To this cause also he ascribes the death of fish du∣ring periods of pestilence. At the same time he contends that the infecting principle is generated in Africa or Asia, and con∣veyed to other countries. The seat of the disease he supposes to be in the animal spirits.</P>
<P>Van Swieten maintains that the cause of Epidemics is in the hidden qualities of the air, and inexplicable. He supposes it not impossible that exhalations in earthquakes may augment or lessen the deleterious quality of the air in pestilence.</P>

<P>Sydenham not only agrees with Diemerbroeck, Van Swieten, and others, in ascribing pestilence to occult qualities in the air, but has entered into the subject of explaining the peculiar symp∣toms of diseases by the influence of an Epidemic constitution of the air. His <HI>occult qualities</HI> have been ridiculed by later physi∣cians, and so far as his theory, in this respect, has been neg∣lected, the science of medicin has degenerated. If I mistake not, it can be made evident, that one of the most important, as well as most difficult branches of medical science, is to as∣certain the effect of the reigning constitution of air, on prevail∣ing diseases, and to apply that knowledge to the cure of those diseases.</P>
<P>Dr. Mead's treatise on the plague has been much admired and celebrated; yet I will assert, that next to the "Traitè de
<PB N="16" REF="036687_0020_100A8AAA6503B540"/>
la peste," a treatise in quarto on the plague of Marseilles, pub∣lished by royal permission, it is the weakest and least valuable performance on that subject now extant. The author acknowl∣edges he had never seen the disease of which he wrote; and therefore must have formed his opinions on the observations of others.</P>
<P>His essay is intended to demonstrate that the plague is propa∣gated by specific contagion only, and he attempts to prove that this disease, like the small-pox and measles, has been bred in E∣gypt or Ethiopia, and thence propagated and entailed on Europe.</P>
<BIBL>Works, p. 242 &amp; 3.</BIBL>
<P>In support of this theory he even goes so far as to call in ques∣tion the unanimous testimony of historians, who relate that the terrible plague of 1347, 8, 9, and 50, began in Cathay, China. In opposition to which he "questions not," that that pestilence originated in Egypt. He alledges that we must seek the cause of plague in Egypt and <HI>no where else.</HI></P>

<P>He does not however deny all latent disorders in the air, but considers them as secondary causes only, increasing and promo∣ting the disease when once bred, but he thinks infection to be the means of its propagation. In this he differs widely from Diemerbroeck who utterly denies that the disease is originally derived from infection, although he agrees that it may be after∣wards communicated from person to person by contact or near

approach. Diemerbroeck also maintains the latent qualities of the air to be the <HI>principal</HI> cause of the plague; or cause <HI>sine qua non</HI>—a point which the facts to be hereafter detailed will most clearly demonstrate.</P>
<P>Dr. Mead says, "the plague is never originally bred with us, but is always brought accidentally from abroad."</P>
<BIBL>p. 261.</BIBL>
<P>The same opinion is asserted most positively in James' Medi∣cal Dictionary, and in most modern publications on the subject. The compilers of the Encyclopedia say, "the plague, as <HI>is generally agreed,</HI> is never bred or propagated in Britain, but al∣ways imported from abroad," especially from the Levant, Lesser Asia or Egypt where it is very common." Such also was the opinion of the celebrated Cullen.</P>

<P>The following sentence in Dr. Mead is very exceptionable, as it is calculated to check a spirit of free enquiry—a spirit to which mankind are greatly indebted for improvements in science.</P>
<P>"It may be justly censured in those writers that they should undertake to determine the specific nature of these secret chan∣ges and alterations which we have no means at all of discover∣ing," alluding to changes in the air.</P>

<P>In opposition to all these great authorities, it will probably be proved, that the plague generally, if not always originates, in the country where it exists as an epidemic. The common opinion of the propagation of pestilence solely by infection, has had a most calamitous effect on medicin and on human happiness. It has prevented the researches of acute modern philosophers and physicians, who might have been able, by diligence and a comprehensive view of the subject, to trace pestilence to its real causes, and to suggest the true means of avoiding this terrible scourge.</P>
<P>Thompson who travelled in Egypt about the year 1734, and whose account of that country has not been mended by modern travellers, observes, "The coming and going of the plague are two things not easily to be accounted for, notwithstanding we
<PB N="18" REF="036687_0022_100A8AB054177690"/>
are assured of the facts in a most unquestionable manner. That the infection is propagated in the air, and thereby transferred from place to place, seems to be a matter out of dispute; but how it is generated therein, we are much at a loss to determine." He proceeds to state, like many others, "that the plague is generally brought into Egypt from Constantinople or by Cara∣vans from the southern countries." And on the whole he thinks it rarely generated in that country.</P>

<P>In the Monthly Review vol. 33, there is an account of the plague in Constantinople, by Dr. Mackenzie, in which are some passages worthy of notice. After asserting his opinion that this distemper can be communicated only by the touch or near ap∣proach, he adds, "that both here and at Smyrna, the plague breaks out, in some years, when it is not possible to trace whence it is conveyed." He supposes the disease to proceed from "venomous moleculae lodged in wool, cotton, hair, leather and skins," in houses not well cleansed after pestilence; but that the plague from this source is not so fatal as when it comes from abroad. The air he thinks no otherwise concerned in produ∣cing the disease, than as "a vehicle to convey the venomous particles from one body to another."</P>
<P>Dr. Chandler, in his account of a plague in Smyrna, has near∣ly the same idea, as Mackenzie, with respect to the origin of the disease. He says "the plague might perhaps be truly defined, a disease arising from certain animalculae, probably invisible, which burrow and form their nidus in the human body. These whether generated in Egypt or elsewhere, subsist always in some places suited to their nature. <HI>They are imported almost annually into Smyrna,</HI> and this species is commonly destroyed by intense heat. They are least fatal at the beginning and latter end of the season. If they arrive early in the spring, they are weak; but gather strength, multiply and then perish. The pores of the skin, opened by the weather, readily admit them."</P>
<P>Baron de Tott in his memoirs observes▪ The researches I have carefully made concerning the plague, which I once believ∣ed to originate in Egypt, have convinced me, that it would not be so much as known there, were not the seeds of it conveyed
<PB N="19" REF="036687_0023_100A8AB1F00AB0D8"/>
thither by the commercial intercourse between Constantinople and Alexandria. It is in this last city that it always begins to appear. It rarely reaches Cairo, though no precaution is taken to prevent it; and when it does, it is presently extirpated by the heats, and prevented from arriving as far as the Said. It is like∣wise well known that the penetrating dews, which fall in Egypt about midsummer, destroy, even in Alexandria, all remains of this distemper."</P>
<BIBL>Vol. 4. page 70.</BIBL>
<P>In vol. 1, p. 38 he says, "that the researches into the nature of this distemper have only produced opinions which are self-con∣tradictory or unsupported by facts."—"There is no difficulty with respect to the causes which preserve and propagate it. Both the one and the other may be referred to the <HI>dealers in old clothes</HI> in Constantinople."</P>
<P>Du Pauw, in his Philosophical Dissertations on the Egyptians and Chinese, speaks of the plague as a disease of Egypt; and supposes the plague at Vienna in 1680, to have been imported from that country.—"Egypt is the hot-bed of the plague—this disorder is not produced by famin—by exact annotations con∣tinued during twenty-eight years, we find that it raged five times, without being preceded by any scarcity of food, and contrary to what I once suspected, unrestricted to a periodical course."</P>

<P>Savary alledges, in opposition to the last mentioned author, that the pestilence is <HI>not</HI> native in Egypt, and that he consulted Egyp∣tians and physicians who had lived there 20 years, who <HI>informed</HI> him that the plague was brought thither by the Turks.

<P>Dr. Alexander Russel has given an account of the plague in Aleppo in 1742 and 3, and endeavored to ascertain from what quarter the disease originated and invaded that city. He seems to think, it always appears first at Tripoli, Sidon, or on the Sea Coast. It was asserted that the great plague of 1719 came from the northward; but as this fact does not suit his theory, he, like
<PB N="20" REF="036687_0024_100A8AB473118068"/>
Dr. Mead, in the case before mentioned, gives no credit to the assertion, but adheres to his opinion that all plagues originate in Egypt.—At the same time he is puzzled to trace the disease, in any instance, to that country.</P>
<BIBL>Sec his hist. of Aleppo.</BIBL>
<P>Dr. Patrick Russel has published a quarto volume on the plague of Aleppo in 1760, and the subject of quarantine. In this work, he has preserved a number of important facts, but without under∣standing the subject sufficiently to apply them to useful purposes. All his theory and practical remarks are founded on the vulgar supposition of the origin of that disease in one or two cities only, and its propagation by specific contagion—a supposition totally unfounded; his treatise of course will be found of little value, in this respect.</P>
<P>Mr. Volney. with all his philosophy and several months resi∣dence in Egypt, furnishes no additional light, on the subject of the origin of pestilence. He says, "some persons have attemp∣ted to establish an opinion, that the plague originates in Egypt; but this supposition, <HI>founded on vague prejudices,</HI> seems to be dis∣proved by facts." This is an extraordinary assertion for a man who has the character of a philosopher. And on what author∣ity does it rest? Simply on the declaration of European Merch∣ants who have been settled for many years at Alexandria, and of the Egyptians, who say that the disease first appears in Alexan∣dria, and that it is invariably preceded by an arrival from Smyr∣na or Constantinople. Therefore this philosopher concludes, "that the disease certainly originates from Constantinople, where it is perpetuated by the absurd negligence of the Turks, who publicly sell the effects of persons who die of that distemper." Here we have another great man ascribing this vast effect, an epidemic pestilence, to so trifling a cause, as infection preserved in furs, woolens, and old clothes!</P>
<P>What is still more astonishing, the same author adopts the ideas of the Egyptians, which Prosper Alpinus had adopted before him and which he has evidently copied from Alpinus, that a plague coming from one country is less malignant than when it comes from another, as tho there could be a difference in the <HI>specific</HI> contagion of the disease, when produced in different coun∣tries.
<PB N="21" REF="036687_0025_100A8AB628B81A50"/>
Volney says "when brought from the Archipelago, or even from Damietta, into the harbours of Latakia, Saide or Acre, it <HI>will not spread;</HI> it rather chuses preliminary circum∣stances, and a more complex route; but when it passes directly from Cairo to Damascus, all Syria is sure to be infected."</P>
<BIBL>Travels in Egypt and Syria vol. 1. 253. et seq.</BIBL>
<P>It is really surprising that, if the fact is well evidenced, that a plague proceeding from one country is more malignant than one proceeding from another, men of extensive erudition and observation should not undertake to assign some rational cause for the phenomenon, rather than to propagate the vulgar tales and opinions of the Egyptians.</P>
<P>From this lengthy statement of opinions in regard to the ori∣gin and causes of pestilence; opinions weak, contradictory, ab∣surd or inaccurate, what conclusion shall be drawn. This, most evidently, that the <HI>subject is not understood.</HI> Perhaps it never will be understood. But surely a subject so interesting to the life and happiness of man, deserves most critical and laborious enquiry. A subject which concerns the lives of millions of the human race ought not to be abandoned by the man of science, until every effort to find the truth shall have been exhausted. Yet strange as it may appear, even a history of pestilence that all devouring scourge which has swept away a large portion of the human race in every age, is yet a desideratum in our libraries.</P>
<P>To supply in part this defect, and to stimulate further re∣searches into the origin of this frequent and formidable calamity, I will recite such historical accounts of the plague, as an im∣perfect examination of authors has enabled me to collect. And as the most accurate observers of the operations of nature, have suggested the probability that pestilential epidemics are caused by some occult qualities in the air, or by vapor from the internal parts of the earth, or by planetary influence, it is absolutely necessary to enquire how far such suggestions are supported by facts. For this purpose, I shall note, as I proceed, any extra∣ordinary occurrence or phenomena in the physical world, as earthquakes, eruptions of volcanoes, appearance of comets, vi∣olent tempests, unusual seasons, and other singular events and circumstances, which may appear to be connected with pesti∣lence,
<PB N="22" REF="036687_0026_100A8AB7EC9F4F30"/>
either as cause or effect, or as the effect of a common cause.</P>
<P>The result of this process will probably be a refutation of some of the foregoing opinions, and the establishment of such as are more rational and philosophical.</P>
<P>It is proper however to premise, that this investigation, which has been pursued but a few months only, amidst other occupa∣tions, has been subjected to inconveniences peculiar to the Uni∣ted States. No man can find in this country <HI>all</HI> the books ne∣cessary for a complete examination of a historical or scientific subject. The public libraries in New-York and New-Haven, tho very valuable, are deficient. Those of Harvard College and Philadelphia, are more extensive, but incomplete. I have examined them all, tho in some of them I could spend but little time; yet in none of them could I find all the authorities which it was my wish and intention to consult.</P>
<P>It is further to be premised, that I have, as far as it could be done, resorted to original historians for my facts and authorities. This is certainly the only safe method for a compiler; but in the United States, it cannot be pursued with complete success, for want of the original writers of the local histories of countries. Most of the Greek and Roman authors are to be obtained in our public or private libraries; but some of the best historians of Italy, Germany, the Baltic nations and Spain, who have lived within the last four or five centuries, are not to be found; others are in the original languages, which I do not understand.</P>
<P>As to the modern historical compilations in my native lan∣guage, they are almost useless on this subject. The most able and celebrated of them, Hume, Robertson, Smollet, Rapin and Gibbon, have passed over most of the plagues which have desolated cities and countries, without notice, or with some general remarks which afford little light on the subject of their origin.</P>
<P>Most modern writers appear to think every thing beneath their notice, except war and political intrigues. They detail, with disgusting minuteness, whatever relates to the definition or an∣noyance of mankind by the ambition of princes and demagogues;
<PB N="23" REF="036687_0027_100A8ABB9F3C1BE8"/>
while they omit or slightly mention whatever regards the civil and domestic economy, the private manners and habits, the arts, the health, and the social happiness of nations. To this de∣scription, Dr. Henry's History of England, is an exception.</P>
<P>Nor have modern travellers furnished us with many valuable materials to supply the defects of our histories. They pass from country to country; examine and describe a few external ob∣jects, such as cities, buildings, paintings and statues, but leave more useful subjects unexamined, and return home with a book of vulgar tales and errors.</P>
<P>In respect to useful history, the ancient authors have the preference over the modern. Modern compilers appear to have written for fame or for money, rather than for the sake of en∣folding and diffusing truth. Hence they have principally at∣tended to those animated periods of the world, which were dis∣tinguished for great achievments; or those prominent events, a description of which would interest the passions of their readers: Or they have selected for description such parts of the history of nations as would enable them to adorn their works with an elevated style; omitting a multitude of subordinate facts, as below the dignity of history. Others appear to have undertaken historical compilation, solely or principally to sup∣port some preconceived system of government or religion; and have studied to bend the evidence of facts, to the accomplish∣ment of that purpose.</P>
<P>These observations have arisen out of my enquiries, relative to pestilential diseases. I have discovered that many of the histories or rather abridgements and compilations which are al∣most the only authorities consulted by American readers in gen∣eral, are very incomplete; and no man who relies on them only, and neglects original writers, can acquire an accurate and com∣prehensive knowledge of history.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION II. Historical view of pestilential epidemics, and the phenomena in the physical world, which precede, attend or follow them, from the earliest accounts, to the Christian era.</HEAD>
<P>IT is an agreed point that the five books of Moses are the most ancient authentic history now extant. In the very thresh∣hold of this genuine history, we meet with accounts of the plague in Egypt. In the fifth chapter of Exodus, the pestilence is mentioned as a formidable calamity.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that throughout the history of the Jews, and in the prophets, <HI>pestilence, famin</HI> and <HI>the sword</HI> are often men∣tioned in connection with each other, and described as the most dreadful calamities that can befal mankind. It will probably appear that famin and pestilential diseases do at times recipro∣cally produce each other, and that war not unfrequently occa∣sions both. But there is ground to believe that famin and pes∣tilence are usually the effects of one common cause. In the Bible, as in other ancient writings, no distinction is made be∣tween general pestilence which spreads over whole countries, and those autumnal epidemics, which are evidently produced by powerful local causes. There are however many passages in scripture that corroborate the principles respecting pestilence, which are still observed, and which doubtless depend on estab∣lished laws of nature.</P>
<P>When David was summoned to receive his punishment for numbering the children of Israel, he was permitted to elect one of the three calamities, famin, the sword or pestilence. For a pious reason, he preferred pestilence, and seventy thousand of his subjects perished.</P>
<BIBL>2 Sam. xxiv.</BIBL>
<P><PB N="25" REF="036687_0029_100A8ABF01799428"/>The prophets Jeremiah and Ezekiel, in their denunciations, speak often of these three judgments, and in a way that authorizes the opinion, that they considered them all to be closely connected. It is however remarkable that pestilence is every where men∣tioned as the peculiar scourge of <HI>cities.</HI></P>
<P>In the 21st chapter of Jeremiah, the siege of Jerusalem is foretold. "I will smite the inhabitants of this <HI>city,</HI> both man and beast; they shall die with a great pestilence. He that abi∣deth in this <HI>city</HI> shall die by the sword, by the famin and by the pestilence; but he that goeth out, and falleth to the Chal∣deans that besiege you, <HI>he shall live,</HI> and his life shall be to him for a prey."</P>
<P>Ezekiel v. 12. declares that a <HI>third part</HI> of the inhabitants of Jerusalem shall die by pestilence. This is a proportion which is not uncommon, in violent plagues. In the seventh chapter, the same prophet says, "The sword is <HI>without,</HI> and the pesti∣lence and famin <HI>within</HI>; he that is in the field, shall die with the sword; and he that is in the <HI>city,</HI> famin and pestilence shall devour him."</P>
<P>Another passage in the same prophet deserves notice. Chap. xxxiii, it is said, "Thus saith the Lord, as I live, surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the sword, and him that is in the open field will I give to the beasts to be devoured, and they that be in the <HI>forts</HI> and the <HI>caves</HI> shall die of the pestilence."</P>
<P>In these passages, we have proof that in the time of these prophets, it was considered as a well known fact, that pestilential diseases are the effect of crouded propulation, raging peculiarly in <HI>cities, forts</HI> and other confined places. No evidence appears, in these early records, that the ancients, who lived in countries sub∣ject to plague, and near to Egypt, had any idea of the convey∣ance of the distemper from place to place by infection. It was considered as a judgment of heaven; and piety still recognizes this idea; to which, in a moral and religious view, there can be no objection. But philosophy endeavors to trace the hand of heaven through the medium of second causes; and the facts re∣corded
<PB N="26" REF="036687_0030_100A8AC448544360"/>
of pestilence in scripture, lend their aid to accomplish the object.</P>
<P>In 1 Samuel v. and vi. we have an account of the pestilence among the Philistines, inflicted on them as a punishment for the king the ark from the Jews, in which fifty thousand of the in∣habitants of Beth shemesh perished. This plague is called <HI>eme∣rods</HI> and a <HI>deadly destruction.</HI> This passage is noted on account of the specification of the time of the year, when the disease pre∣vailed. It is said, the ark was in the country of the Philistince <HI>seven months,</HI> and was returned, during wheat-harvest, soon after which it is understood, the plague ceased. Now wheat harvest, in Syria, is in May; and it may be supposed, the pestilence was most violent in the period next preceding that time, viz. April, or during the month of May, for it was the severity of the dis∣ease which induced them to send back the ark.—This account corresponds with the modern course of pestilence in that country. It appears in February or March, increases till May or June, then gradually disappears.</P>
<BIBL>See A. Russel. Hist. of Aleppo. P. Russel on the plague at Aleppo.</BIBL>
<P>In this case, modern facts confirm the accuracy of the scrip∣ture-history; at the same time, they establish the identity of the disease with modern plague, and the uniformity in the ope∣rations of the laws of nature. They prove further that the climate of that country has suffered no material alteration.</P>
<P>In the eleventh chapter of Numbers, we have an account of a plague among the Israelites, occasioned by their eating great quantities of the flesh of quails, after being some time destitute of animal food—an obvious effect in the hot climates of Egypt and Arabia.</P>
<P>The scripture-history also furnishes us with ample proof that Egypt was, in early times, the nursery of plague—known and considered as such, centuries before the foundation of Smyrna, Constantinople, or other large cities in Greece or Asia Minor.</P>
<P>In Deuteronomy xxviii. the Israelites are warned against dis∣obedience to the laws of Moses, and in case of disregarding them, are threatened with the diseases of Egypt, the botch, the emerods and the scab. These are still prevailing disorders in
<PB N="27" REF="036687_0031_100A8AC5D8C27870"/>
that country under the names of leprosy, elephantiasis, plague, &amp;c. In verse 60 of the same chapter, it is denounced, "More∣over he shall bring upon thee <HI>all the diseases of Egypt,</HI> of which thou wast afraid."</P>
<P>Amos lv. 10. "I have sent among you the <HI>pestilence,</HI> after <HI>the manner of Egypt.</HI>"</P>
<P>These authorities of high antiquity leave no room for doubt or controversy, on the question, whether Egypt originates the plague. The evidence is decisive against those modern superfi∣cial philosophers, who hold in contempt the most authentic an∣cient history, because it has claims to inspiration. Yet infidels, if they were not too wise to read, examin and be informed, might be convinced of the authenticity of the scripture history, by comparing the facts related, with the present state of the world. The present endemical and other diseases which often occur in Egypt, answer so exactly to the description given of them in the books of Moses, as to leave no room to question the genuineness of those books. It was the peculiar climate of Egypt, and the usual prevalence of scorbutic and malignant complaints, in that country, which occasioned all the minute injunctions of Moses, in regard to washing, cleansing and purifi∣cations. The same or similar regulations were enjoined by the laws of Egypt.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has been controverted whether Moses borrowed his system of pu∣rification from the institutions which he found in Egypt; or whether the Egyptians borrowed the idea from the laws of Moses. Nothing can be more idle than such a dispute. The experience of men would very readily suggest the necessity and utility of great cleanliness, to preserve health in the climate of Egypt. The custom of circumcision was established among the Egyptians, as well as among the Israelites; and Herodotus who visited Egypt to collect facts, expressly declares that the "Egyptians circumcised their children for the sake of clean∣liness." —There is not the least reason to suppose that the Egyptians borrowed this custom, or others respecting cleanliness, from the Israel∣ites. Nor does it vary the question, that the laws of Moses were the commands of God. Divine commands have rarely introduced a new principle of right and wrong. Most of them are injunctions on man to conform to principles of moral fitness or utility, which existed <HI>an∣terior to the commands.</HI> They <HI>unfold</HI> to human view, and <HI>enforce</HI> the prac∣tice of those principles; but do not <HI>create</HI> them.

<P>The circumstances to be noted in the foregoing extracts, are, first that the pestilence among cattle preceded that among men. This is a common fact, but not always the case. Secondly, that heat and moisture, with a south wind were productive of pestilential diseases. Thirdly, that such diseases raged in Greece during the autumnal season, and were ascribed to the influence of Syrius, or the dog-star.</P>
<P>We read of a terrible pestilence in the island of Aegina, to the southward of Athens, in the reign of Aeacus, grandfather of Achilles, about sixty years before the Trojan war; a plague which depopulated the island. Of this calamity, Ovid has given a most affecting account Metam. lib. 7. 523. He repre∣sents the earth as covered with clouds, darkness and suffocating heat; the south wind blowing for four months, the lakes and fountains being infected, and the earth overspread with poisonous serpents. The disease first invaded dogs, birds, sheep and ox∣en; then mankind. Death was sudden; and the streets loaded with dead carcases. The symptoms began with heat in the bowels, slushings of the face, difficulty of breathing, &amp;c. How far the poet was authorized by history in this description, I do not know; but the whole passage is worth the attention of the learned reader.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="036687_0034_100A8ACB747BA758"/>Our next accounts of the plague are in the histories of Rome; for altho Greece contained the older states, and had large cities, before the foundation of Rome; yet the most populous parts of Greece, Attica and Lacedemon, are dry, rocky coun∣tries; not calculated to generate pestilence nor to favor its prop∣agation.</P>
<P>Rome, on the other hand, is situated in a level country, on the banks of a river, and not far from extensive marshes. Un∣der the influence of powerful local causes, this city felt every derangement of the atmosphere, by intemperate seasons, or other causes.</P>
<P>The first plague in Rome happened about the 16th year from its foundation, soon after the murder of Tatius, and in time of peace. "It killed instantly without any previous sickness. Even trees and cattle were not exempt from the malignity of its influence; but all nature lay one desolate and abandoned waste. It was even said to rain blood." This was 738 years before the Christian era.</P>

<P>Zonaras says that Rome was laid waste by disease, and the earth and cattle were barren. "Sterilitas agrorum et pecudum."</P>
<BIBL>Lib. 7.</BIBL>
<P>This pestilence must have been of the most malignant kind, and by the effect on cattle and trees, it was obviously during a pestilential state of the atmosphere, when there was a defect in the powers of vegetable as well as animal life—many similar in∣stances will occur in the course of this history. It is to be re∣marked that Rome was then in its infant state, containing few people, and few of the artificial causes of disease. Of course the sickness must have been caused by general contagion, or that state of air which is unfavorable to the preservation of healthy life.</P>
<P>In the reign of Numa Pompilius A. R. 46, Italy was afflicted with severe pestilence; on which occasion Numa instituted the Salii, twelve dancers who had the care of the brazen target, which was supposed to descend from heaven into the hands of
<PB N="31" REF="036687_0035_100A8ACF86C790B0"/>
Numa, and to check the pestilence. See the institution and an∣nual ceremonies of the Salii, described in
<BIBL>Plutarch's life of Numa, and Kennet's Antiquities, part. 2. b. 2.</BIBL></P>
<P>Another plague attacked Rome in the reign of Tullius Hos∣tilius, about the year 110 or 112, and B. C. about 640. No important particulars are related, except that the sickness relax∣ed the martial spirit of the citizens. To prevent this effect, that warlike prince gave the soldiers no rest, judging "salubri∣ora militiae, quam domi, juvenum corpora esse," that the young men would be more healthy in the army abroad, than at home.</P>
<BIBL>Livy b. 1. 32.</BIBL>
<P>In this opinion, the King of Rome was probably well found∣ed; for it appears from facts hereafter to be related, that Rome was most subject to pestilence in time of peace, when the sold∣iers were at Rome, augmenting the population of the city, and indulging in ease and luxury.</P>

<P><PB N="32" REF="036687_0036_100A8AD2221140A0"/>There was an eruption of Etna, according to common chro∣nology, in the year of Rome 277, and B. C. 477. This cir∣cumstance is strong evidence that the chronology is not quite correct. The eruption took place unquestionably during the pestilential period, to which this plague in Rome belonged. It might not have been the very year of the plague in Rome, but probably was not so distant as four years. To which event, the plague or the eruption, a wrong era is assigned, I shall not de∣termin. The early history of Rome, from the destruction of the ancient records, by the burning of the city, when taken by the Gauls under Brennus, in the year 365, is subject to great uncertainty, and authors do not agree on the chronology of that part of the Roman story.</P>
<P>☞ Since writing the foregoing remarks, I have discovered a fact which may serve to aid us in fixing the period of the events abovementioned. In the course of this work it will be proved beyond doubt, that the approach of comets to our system, has a prodigious influence on the elements of this globe. At pres∣ent I shall assume the fact, that the eruption of Etna above∣mentioned, was nearly cotemporary with the appearance of a comet, during this period of pestilence. In looking into Pliny's Natural History, lib. 2. ca. 25, I find that a comet was visible, at the time of the battle of Salamis. Speaking of the different species of comets he says "Ceratias Cornus speciem habet, qualis fecit cum Graecia apud Salamina depugnavit." "A comet in the figure of a javelin, like that which appeared when Greece fought at Salamis." This battle is fixed by authors in the year B. C. 480, and consequently in the year of Rome, by com∣mon chronology 274. It appears to be a general law of nature that the approach of comets to this earth, calls into action the subterranean fire, and volcanoes discharge their contents, during or within a few months of the appearance of comets. We may safely conclude therefore that the eruption was within a year
<PB N="33" REF="036687_0037_100A8AD4A168F2B0"/>
or two of the battle of Salamis. This is not certain, but proba∣ble; and I am inclined therefore to believe that Hook and others have placed the plague in Rome three or four years too late, or that the eruption is placed too early.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Brydone mentions an eruption in the 77th Olympiad, compre∣hending the years of Rome from 282 to 285 inclusive, which it doubt∣less the same abovementioned.</NOTE></P>
<P>The army of Xerxes, retreating into Asia, after the loss of the engagement near Salamis, suffered extremely by pestilential diseases. And it will hereafter appear that during periods when the pestilential state of air is evidenced by the existence of plague in <HI>cities,</HI> armies in the field and seamen on the ocean are much more subject to epidemic complaints, than at other times.</P>
<P>The land forces which Xerxes left behind him under Mardo∣nius, fell a prey to famin and pestilence. The highways were strewed with dead bodies, and wild fowls and beasts devoured them.</P>
<P>The same period was distinguished by tempests and inunda∣tions —the constant attendants on comets. A violent storm had destroyed the famous bridge built by the great monarch over the Hellespont, before he returned from Greece; and while the troops under Mardonius were besieging Potidea, an inundation of the sea broke into their trenches, drowned some soldiers, and compelled them to raise the siege.</P>
<BIBL>Herodotus lib. 8. 115, 129. Justin lib. 2. cap. 13.</BIBL>
<P>These great phenomena, without any historical account, would make it nearly certain that a comet appeared at that time, and the pestilence undoubtedly happened within a short period of its approach.</P>
<P>A more terrible pestilence invaded the Roman city and terri∣tory, in the year 290, and B. C. 464. Several facts in regard to it, deserve particular notice. "Grave tempus et forte annus pestilens erat urbi, agrisque, nec hominibus magis, quam pecori; et auxere vim morbi, tenore pupulationis, pecoribus agrestibusque, in urbem acceptis. Ea colluvio mixtorum omnis generis animan∣tium, et odore insolito urbanos, et agrestem confertum in arcta tec∣ta,
<PB N="34" REF="036687_0038_100A8AD7DDF868B8"/>
aestu ac vigiliis angebat, ministeriaque in vicem ac contagio ip∣sa vulgabant morbos."</P>
<BIBL>Livy. lib. 3. 6. Dion Hal. lib. 10.</BIBL>
<P>"This was an unhealthy time and a pestilent year in town and country, affecting equally men and cattle; and the disease was augmented by crouds of countrymen and herds of cattle, which were received within the walls of the city, for fear of being plundered or destroyed [by the Latins and Hernici, who then ravaged the country.] That collection of all kinds of animals in the city, and the unusual stench occasioned by them, severely affected both the citizens and the country people, crouded into close buildings, depressed by heat and watching; and their fa∣tigue and the contagion spread the sickness into every quarter."</P>
<P>This is Livy's representation. Dionysius Hallicarnassus men∣tions that the disease seized <HI>studs</HI> of mares, <HI>herds</HI> of oxen, and <HI>flocks</HI> of goats and sheep; by which expressions we are perhaps to understand, that the distemper either did not seize those animals, except in collections, or was remarkably fatal to them in nume∣rous bodies—an idea warranted by modern facts. It is generally true of cattle as of men, that pestilential diseases are most destruc∣tive, where many are collected together; not only by reason of infection from the diseased, but by the diminution of the vital principle of the air by respiration and perspiration.</P>
<P>Orosius lib. 2. 12. adds other circumstances. He says there was a short suspension of war, when a grievous pestilence, which never failed to compel the Romans to a truce, or to interrupt it, if made, raged violently through all the city. Many of the pa∣tricians were victims, but it was most fatal to the poor.</P>
<P>It is stated that this pestilence began about the calends of Sep∣tember and raged in city and country. By country, <HI>agris,</HI> the Roman writers meant the ancient Latium, the modern Com∣pagna di Roma, which was naturally unhealthy; tho, in the flourishing ages of Rome, extremely populous.</P>
<P>That the Roman territory should be subject to autumnal com∣plaints, is not at all surprising. At the port of the Tyber there were unwholesome marshes, called by Tacitus, Annals 15. 43. "Ostienses paludes." The shore to the southward, bor∣dering Campania, is called by the same historian, "squalente
<PB N="35" REF="036687_0039_100A8AD9E67B6CD8"/>
littore." To the southward of Campania were and still are the extensive marshes, called "paludes pomptinae," which are so noxious as to create disease in a single night, and which have cau∣sed the Appian way in modern times to be neglected, and the road to Naples to be carried round the marshes on the east.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the epitome of the 46th book of Livy, which book is among those which are lost, I find it related that the Pontine Marshes were drained or dyked [siccatae] and converted into cultivable land, by the Consul Cornelius Cethegus, about the year of Rome 572. The Ro∣mans were convinced that the marshes were very unwholesome, and they took incredible pains to render their city and territory healthful, by draining off all stagnant waters.</P>
<P>It is much to be regretted that we have not this book of Livy, to give us further information in what manner the draining of the marshes was effected. It is considered by the moderns as impracticable.</P>
<P>The opinion of the ancients as to the unhealthfulness of Rome may be understood from the following Tetrastichon, which is preserved by Baronius.</P>
<LG>
<L>"Roma vorax hominum, domat ardua colla virorum;</L>
<L>Roma ferax febrium, necis est uberrima frugum;</L>
<L>Romanae febres stabili sunt jure fideles;</L>
<L>Quem semel invadunt, vix a viventi recedent."</L>
</LG>
<P>The brief translation of which is "Rome subdues men by the sword, and kills them with fevers."</P>
<P>Horace book 2. ode 29. gives to the Tyber, the epithet <HI>udus,</HI> wet or marshy.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>The territory next to the city of Rome is described by Livy, b. 7. 38. in these words "in pestilente atque arido circa urbem solo"—a dry plain, but indented with lakes, bordered with marshes, and subject to be overflowed by every uncommon rise of the Tyber, or by streams from the distant hills. Many epidemic diseases have been distinctly traced to stagnant waters on this plain, after an inundation.</P>
<P>Avernus, a lake of Campania, near Baiae, emitted such a poisonous vapor, that no birds would frequent its banks, and the ancients, in their flights of fancy called it, the road to Hell.</P>
<P>It was this situation of Rome which gave rise to the Cloacae, immense sewers or drains, which penetrated the city and neigh∣borhood —Vast works intended to drain off the stagnant waters; and while these were preserved in good repair, the city was obvi∣ously more healthy.</P>
<P>This plague in the year 290 proved fatal to both of the Con∣suls Servilius and Aebutius, to many illustrious Romans, and to a countless number of the Plebeians. The Senate and people, in des∣pair

part had rccourse to prayers and supplications, the temples were filled with men, women and children, asking forgiveness and favor of heaven.</P>
<P>This violent plague was followed, anno Urb. Con. 292 by a violent earthquake. "Terra ingenti concussa motu est," says Li∣vy, lib. 3. ca. 10. He expressly mentions this to have been in the consulate of P. Volumnius and Serv. Sulpicius, which was the second Consulate after the pestilence. An eruption of Etna is mentioned in the tables under the year of Rome 288, two years before the pestilence and four years before the earthquake. But there is probably a small variation in the chronology. The earth∣quake was probably at the time of the eruption, especially as Li∣vy mentions, that in the same year, "Coelum ardere visum," the heavens appeared to be in a flame.</P>
<P>Functius places these events one year later.</P>
<P>By this earthquake Locris, on the gulf of Corinth, was rent from the main land and turned into an island. Afterwards Lo∣cris was destroyed by another earthquake.</P>
<P>Severe drouth marked this period.</P>
<P>In the year of Rome 300 according to Livy and the common chronology and B. C. 454, another terrible pestilence invaded Rome. The country was desolated, and the citizens were ex∣hausted with continual burials. "Urbs assiduis exhausta funer∣ibus." Famin accompanied this calamity, and cattle were vic∣tims, as well as men. This plague took place in time of peace —"ab hoste otium fuit," and in the absence of the ambassadors who were sent to Athens to collect the laws of Solon and the Grecian institutions.</P>
<BIBL>Livy b. 3. 32.</BIBL>
<P>With this period corresponds an eruption of Etna, which au∣thors place in the year of Rome 304; of course, it was at the close of the pestilential period.</P>
<P>In the year 315 of Rome and B. C. 439, according to Pau∣lus Diaconus, tremendous earthquakes shook Italy at intervals for a whole year, so that "assiduis Roma, nuntiis fataga∣reter," Rome was fatigued with messengers who were continually arriving with news of towns and villages demolished.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="036687_0041_100A8ADF15E0E420"/>The chronology of P. Diaconus rarely agrees with that com∣monly received. The earthquakes here mentioned probably ushered in the long and formidable calamity which was to follow —and were probably cotemporary with the beginning of the plague next to be mentioned.</P>
<P>In the year of Rome 317, and B. C. 437 commenced a pes∣lential state that afflicted Rome for five years, or five seasons successively. The historian relates that the first year "a pesti∣lence invaded the people," and as the disease increased, prodi∣gies alarmed them and frequent earthquakes overturned houses in the country. The next year the disease was more mortal: "pestilentior inde annus." In 320, the disease was so fatal as to suspend all ordinary concerns. The people resorted to their prayers, and the Sybilline books were consulted and obeyed, to appease the Gods and avert the plague from the people. For fear of famin, corn was purchased in Etruria, the Pontine ter∣ritory and in Sicily. The mortality extended also to cattle. In 321, the disease was mitigated and afterwards subsided.</P>
<BIBL>Livy b. 4. 21, 25.</BIBL>
<P>This is the first instance, in which I am able to trace distinct∣ly a <HI>progression</HI> in the malignancy of the plague. That this is an important fact, in all plagues, will hereafter appear. But on this point, ancient history affords very scanty materials. This was a period of universal pestilence for many years, and was marked with all the great phenomena of nature. The last year of the plague in Rome 321, corresponds with the year B. C. 433, two years before the plague of Athens. In the year of Rome 325, according to Hook, there was a most grievous famin, occasioned by a severe drouth in all the Roman territory. "Siccitas eo anno plurimum laboratum est; nec caelestes modo defuerunt aquae, sed terra quoque, ingenito humore egens, vix ad perrennes subfecit amnes." By this, we are led to believe, that the drouth was not solely caused by a want of rain, but by an un∣usual defect of subterranean springs and moisture. The expres∣sion, "ingenito humore egens," contrasted with the usual source of water, rain, evidently carries with it an idea that the evapo∣ration from the earth was <HI>unusual;</HI> and this may easily be ac∣counted for, by the violent action of internal heat or electricity
<PB N="38" REF="036687_0042_100A8AE2E7AA3490"/>
which distinguished this pestilential period, and was evidenced by tremendous and universal earthquakes, and a great eruption of Etna.</P>
<P>The drouth in Rome was extreme—multitudes of cattle thronged round the arid fountains, and perished with thirst. Diseases followed, first invading cattle, and the lower classes of people and the countrymen, then extending to the city.</P>
<BIBL>Livy b. 4. 30.</BIBL>
<P>Thucydides relates b. 1 and 3, that earthquakes affected the largest part of the globe, and shook it with the utmost violence. In many places, there was severe drouth and a subsequent famin. In some places, the earthquakes produced alarming inundations of the sea; as in Euboea and Atalanta—the Prytaneum, or town-house in Athens, the fortifications and some dwelling-houses were demolished. These events were in the fifth and sixth years of the Peloponnesian war, answering to 427 and 426 B. C. and consequently were at the close, or subsequent to the pestilence. About the same time there was a violent eruption of Etna; such as had not been known for fifty years preceding. This period was also marked by the approach of a comet, but I am not clear that it was in the year B. C. 431, as stated by Dr. Priestley in his Lectures on History. The drouth was probably within a few months of the appearance of the comet, according to numerous observations in late periods of the world: By which it would seem to be a law of the physical system, that <HI>pre∣ceding, during</HI> and <HI>following</HI> the approach of those erratic bodies, this earth is affected alternately with great rains and snows, drouth, violent tempests, high tides and earthquakes: Many instances will hereafter occur.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>We are sometimes embarrassed with the differences in the chro∣nology of different authors. But we have, in this place, data that will fix certain points.</P>
<P>From the uniform operations of nature, there can be very little doubt, that all the great events of the physical world, in this period, happened within twelve or eighteen months of each other. The ex∣treme drouth in Italy and Greece, mentioned by Livy and Thucydi∣des, unquestionably occurred, at both places, in the same year. Livy places this under the consulship of A. Cornelius Cossus and T. Quincti∣us Pennus, which Hook arranges under the 325th year of Rome, and Lempriere, under the 327th.</P>
<P>Now Thucydides expressly relates, that the great earthquake which injured Athens, and produced the inundations in the Corinthian Gulf and the Sea of Euboea, rending Atalanta from the main land, and swallowing up a town in Euboea, happened in the spring or summer of the sixth year of the Peloponnesian war. This war commenced in the second or third year of the eighty-seventh Olympiad, corresponding with the years of Rome 323 or 324. The sixth year then will be the 328th or 329th year of Rome. These data bring the drouth in Rome to one of those years; at least they will not admit of its being placed earlier than the year 327, the year preceding the earthquake. It is probable therefore that Lempriere is right, in the arrangement of the consuls. This is rendered more probable, by the eruption of Etna, in the spring of the same year; as it is a known and common fact, that earthquakes and eruptions of volcanoes are preceded by exces∣sive drouth; owing probably to a gradual increase of subterranean heat, or unusual electrical discharges and evaporation, some weeks, or months, before the explosion.</P>
<P>The comet undoubtedly appeared either in the year, preceding, du∣ring or following the drouth; that is, in the year of Rome, 327, 328, or 329, corresponding with year before the Christian era, 427, 426, or 425. It was most probably in the year of the drouth, and in the fifth year of the war, A. U. C. 327, and B. C. 427; the earthquakes and volcanoe followed in the spring of the next year.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="036687_0043_100AA0AE4534B3E0"/>The plague in Athens broke out in the second year of the Peloponnesian war, when all the inhabitants of the Athenian territory, were crouded into the city, to avoid the destructive ravages of the Lacedemonians. This circumstance alone would account for the production of pestilential diseases in the city. But it is probable that had the same event happened in a period of general health, the sickness in Athens would have been lim∣ited to the dysentery, the more violent camp fevers or common typhus.</P>
<P>But unfortunately this war broke out at a time of universal pestilence, when the diseases of the healthiest countries assume new and more malignant symptoms, and hence we account for the duration and the violence of the malady. This idea seems to be important, and the only material one to be added to the excellent philosophical account of the plague at Athens by Dr. Elihu H. Smith, late of New-York. Medical Repository, vol. 1, art. 1. The origin of this pestilence is stated by the histo∣rian to have been in that part of Ethiopia which borders on Egypt; thence extending to Egypt, Lybia, the King's domin∣ions or Persia, and to Greece. Some of the more violent of modern plagues have first appeared in the same region. But we are not to conclude from this description that the disease is prop∣agated by infection from person to person. It appears first where
<PB N="40" REF="036687_0044_100AA0B0B7732120"/>
the original or secondary causes, that is, general and local con∣tagion, are the most powerful. If the state of the atmosphere over the world, at any one time, is equally vitiated by some unknown cause, its effects will first appear in places where that state of air is most powerfully aided by <HI>local</HI> vitiation, as in cities or marshy grounds. Of this we have numerous proofs. But, in modern times, whenever the general contagion, united with local causes, produces plague in Egypt or Constantinople, it produces some milder epidemic in the neighboring countries, and often, its effects are visible, at the same time, in most parts of the world.</P>
<P>The Abbe Barthelemy, in his elegant Travels of Anacharsis, speaking of the plague in Athens, says, "it was doubtless bro't into Greece by a vessel from Egypt." It is to be regretted that such an accurate and judicious writer should have indulged <HI>con∣jecture</HI> on this interesting subject. He quotes no authority for his opinion, and the words of Thucydides oppose the supposition. The disease first appeared in the Piraeus, the harbor; and so ignorant were the people of the cause, that they ascribed it to the poisoning of the wells by the Lacedemonians. Besides Thucydides impliedly acknowledges that he and others knew nothing of its origin; for he calls on "every one, physician or not, to assign any credible account of its rise, or the causes powerful enough to produce it."</P>
<P>Plutarch, in his life of Pericles, says "the enemies of Pe∣ricles, attributed this disaster to the multitude of people he had collected into the city, during the heat of summer"—a charge in which there was much truth.</P>
<P>But when we attend to the violent concussions of nature, that accompanied and followed the pestilence, and its general preva∣lence in the world for a series of ten or twelve years, all attempts to trace its origin to infection, dwindle into puerilities; and the occasional causes of sickness, crouded population, heat and bad diet, tho powerful as auxiliaries, could not be adequate to the vi∣olent and continued effects in Athens, and the neighboring cities.</P>
<P>The symptoms of that disease in Athens, as described by Thucydides, are known to every medical man. They corres∣pond
<PB N="41" REF="036687_0045_100AA0B24600B288"/>
in all the essential particulars, with those of the Yellow Fever in its worst forms, and the disease was probably what I call the bilious plague. There is the more reason to believe this supposition, as Thucydides has not mentioned, among the symptoms, the buboes and other swellings of the glands, which distinguish the inguinal plague. The critical days were the seventh or ninth, as they have most frequently been in the bil∣ious plague in America.</P>
<P>The disease extended to other towns in Attica, especially to those which were most populous, but Lacedemon escaped. It raged in Persia at the same time, and it is said, the King of Persia sent for Hippocrates to lend his aid in arresting the pro∣gress of the pestilence, but the latter declined leaving his own country.</P>
<P>It has been supposed that Hippocrates was in Athens during this plague; but this must be a mistake. He was probably at Thasus, an island, near the coast of Macedonia. The four epi∣demic years, which he has described, were cotemporary with the pestilence in Athens; and this proves what will hereafter appear more fully, that in all great plagues, the epidemic or pestilential principle extends to different countries, and often over the whole earth.</P>
<P>In this pestilence, as we shall have occasion to observe in many subsequent instances, the birds abandoned the infected at∣mosphere.</P>
<P>In the year of Rome 341, and B. C. 413, a pestilence arose which the historian represents as more alarming than fatal, "mi∣nacior tamen quam perniciosior." This circumstance affords ground to believe the pestilence to have been a violent autumnal bilious fever, and not rising to the utmost malignity of the plague.</P>
<P>The pestilence of that year was <HI>followed</HI> by famin in the next; owing to a neglect of agriculture; the people having been prin∣cipally occupied with sedition, under their ambitious demagogues. It will be remarked that the famin was not the cause of the epi∣demic, for it succeeded it.</P>
<BIBL>Livy, lib. 4. 52.</BIBL>
<P><PB N="42" REF="036687_0046_100AA0B3CD03FC48"/>It is proper to remark here that all the preceding deadly plagues which had at times almost desolated Rome, were certainly the produce of the country. The Romans were not a commercial people, nor had they any commercial intercourse with Egypt, till the conquest of Carthage, two centuries and a half after this period. It was not till one hundred and forty seven years after the time now under consideration, that the Romans owned a sin∣gle ship. When they transported troops into Sicily, they hired or borrowed vessels for the purpose. Egypt was a granary of corn, but until after the conquest of Carthage, the Romans drew their supplies wholly from Italy and Sicily. There is no pre∣tence therefore for supposing the plague ever imported into Rome; nor is there a suggestion in history, that its origin was ever ascri∣bed to that source.</P>
<P>In the year of Rome 353, and B. C. 401, happened a most severe winter. The Tyber was frozen over, and the high-ways rendered impassible by deep snow. These were unusual phenom∣ena and deemed prodigies in that city. On the opening of spring, the weather changed suddenly from severe cold to great heat and drouth, and a mortal pestilence ensued among men and cattle. The historian says nothing more of the cause of the mortality, than "Sive ex intemperie coeli, raptim ex mutatione in contra∣rium facta, sive alia qua de causa, gravis pestilensque omnibus animalibus aestas excepit, cujus insanabili pernicie quando nec causa nec finis inveniebatur, libri Sibillini ex senatus consulto adi∣ti sunt." On this melancholy occasion was instituted the cere∣mony of the Lectisternium to appease the Gods and solicit the restoration of health.</P>

<P>With this period of pestilence corresponds the dreadful plague which about 404 B. C. almost depopulated Carthage. The dis∣ease on the coast of Africa preceded its appearance in Rome, as it usually does in modern times.</P>
<P>Soon after, the Carthaginians under Imilco, who were sent to reduce Sicily which had revolted, were seized with the plague and the army was so weakened, that Imilco was compelled to abandon the island. Just before Imilco's arrival, an eruption of
<PB N="43" REF="036687_0047_100AA0B62B2DE4E0"/>
Etna laid waste the neighboring country. By an expression of Justin, we have ground to believe a comet appeared about the same time. "Imilco, qui multas civitates cepisset, repente <HI>pestilentis sideris vi,</HI> exercitum amisit."</P>

<P>This plague was remarkable for its symptoms, such as violent dysenteries, raging fevers, burning entrails, acute pains in every part of the body; and many were seized with madness, so that they sallied forth into the streets, and tore to pieces those who fell in their way.</P>
<P>It was during the dry season above mentioned that the Lake of Alba rose suddenly, without apparent cause, and overflowed its banks—an event that caused great consternation in Rome, but one that might well happen by a subterranean discharge of some water-fountains in the high adjoining hills.</P>
<P>This is one of the instances which will often occur, of a hard winter, followed by a dry hot summer, and therefore deserves particular notice; for such excesses in the temperature of the seasons are among the causes of pestilential diseases.</P>
<P>A pestilence broke out in the armies of the Romans and Gauls, while the latter, under Brennus, were besieging Rome, Anno Romae 361, B. C. 393. The Gauls, unaccustomed to such heat, and placed between hills, where they were exposed to a burning sun, vapor and smoke, perished in such multitudes, that, weary with burying dead bodies, the survivors burnt them in piles.</P>
<BIBL>Livy b. 5. 48.</BIBL>
<P>Pliny, lib. 2. 26, mentions the appearance of a comet, or light in the heavens, called by the Greeks <HI>docus</HI> or <HI>doces,</HI> and by the Romans <HI>trabs,</HI> from its resemblance to a beam, at the time of the defeat of the Lacedemonian fleet—"Cum Lacede∣monii, classe victu, imperium Greciae amisere," By the last ex∣pression, "the loss of the empire of Greece," I suppose he re∣fers to the defeat of the fleet by Conon and the Persians in the year of Rome 360, and B. C. 394. If so, the appearance of this comet, corresponds in time with the period of pestilence last named.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="036687_0048_100AA0B969AA7930"/>A plague, occasioned by dearth, is mentioned to have happen∣ed in the year of Rome 371, B. C. 383, but no particulars, worthy of notice.</P>

<P>In the year of Rome 388, B. C. 366, commenced a most desolating plague of three years duration. This was a time of profound peace, "ab seditione et a bello quietis rebus, ne quan∣do a metre ac periculis vacarent, pestilentia ingens orta." It seemed to be the destiny of Rome never to be exempt from fear and dangers; for when war and sedition ceased, pestilence arose.</P>
<BIBL>Livy b. 7. 1.</BIBL>
<P>In this horrible plague, perished the great Camillus, and it is related that, in the height of the disease, 10,000 citizens died in a day.</P>
<P>On this occasion, recourse was had to the ceremony of the Lectisternium,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This ceremony consisted in placing the statues of Apollo, Latona, Diana, Hercules, Mercury, and Neptune, on three beds, and serving them with magnificent repasts for eight days—a mode of checking the pestilence, about as rational as the modern scheme of confining it to the infected place by bodies of armed men, which is much praised by Montesquieu!</NOTE> and to the institution of new games to appease the wrath of the Gods, but without success. Some old citizens mentioned an ancient practice, in such calamities, of driving a nail into the wall of a temple. This law was now revived, and a nail driven into the wall of Jupiter's temple. The time of the year, in which the law directed this ceremony to be per∣formed, the <HI>ides of September,</HI> indicates the period when pes∣tilence began in Rome to be alarming and violent.</P>
<P>Functius, in his chronology, assigns the absorption of Helice and Bura, two towns on the Gulf of Corinth, to the year of Rome 373, the year of the great earthquake in Lacedemon— in which case that catastrophe would make a part of the events of the pestilential period of 371, just mentioned.</P>
<P>Muratori and Paulus Diaconus seem not to differ essentially in arranging that event under the same period. "Saevissimo
<PB N="45" REF="036687_0049_100AA0BBC21F51D8"/>
terraemotu Achaia universa commota est, et duae tunc civitates, Bura et Helice, abruptis locorum devoratae.</P>
<BIBL>Muratori, Gen. Hist. vol. 1. 7.</BIBL>
<P>Other authors refer this catastrophe to the period of pestilence last mentioned, which some writers place in the year of Rome 388, and others, in 384; but all agree that it was during the approximation of a comet. This last pestilence was dreadful in the extreme, sparing no age or sex. The year after it, the earth opened and exhibited a vast chasm in the midst of Rome, into which M. Curtius precipitated himself for the salvation and prosperity of the city.</P>
<BIBL>Livy, b. 7. 7.</BIBL>
<P>P. Orosius and P. Diaconus, followed by Muratori, place the commencement of this plague in the year of Rome 384. Orosius says that "in the 103d and 105th Olympiad, Italy was shaken a whole year, by tremendous earthquakes. The hundred and third Olympiad, according to our common chro∣nology, comprehends the years of Rome from 386 to 389, in∣clusive. It is probable that is one of the shocks of this series of earthquakes, the chasm was made in Rome as already related. It will be observed that this event <HI>followed</HI> the pestilence.</P>
<P>The comet that appeared, during this calamity, was probably that mentioned by Aristotle, Meteorol. lib. 1. ca. 6, of which he was an eye-witness.</P>
<P>But I must not omit what authors relate concerning the pe∣culiar character of this plague. Orosius says, it was not such a pestilence, as usually proceeded from irregular seasons, extreme drouth, sudden heat of the spring, unseasonable moisture of sum∣mer and autumn, or the impure air blown from the Calabrian groves; but severe and continued, attacking all descriptions of people, and either destroying their lives, or leaving them in a weak and miserable condition.</P>
<P>The winter when the comet appeared Aristotle relates to have been cold; but the severity and duration of the plague cannot be accounted for on the principle of changes or irregularities in the seasons. It was one of those violent epidemics which never afflict mankind, without some essential alteration in the invisible
<PB N="46" REF="036687_0050_100AA0BD51CC7908"/>
properties of the atmosphere, or a peculiar effect of the atmos∣phere on living bodies.</P>
<P>Seneca, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the authority of Aristotle and Calisthenes ex∣pressly ascribes the inundation to the approximation of a comet. "Cometes ingentis rei traxit eventus, cum Helicen et Burin orto suo mersit."</P>
<BIBL>Nat. Quest. lib. 7. 16.</BIBL>
<P>The symptoms of this approaching calamity are described to have been these. "For several months the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ters of heaven deluge the earth or withhold their beneficial effects; a dimness obscures the splendor of the sun; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his disk appears like a burning brazier; impetuous winds ravage the country; and streams of fire are seen to shoot in the air." See Travels of Anacharsis, vol. 3. 404, cited from Pausanius, lib. 7. ca. 24.</P>
<P>Some of these phenomena, excessive rains and drouth, tem∣pests, celestial lights, and singular appearances of the sun, al∣ways attend the approach of comets; and it is surprising that the moderns have taken little or no notice of the fact.</P>
<P>The catastrophe of Helice and Bura was occasioned by vio∣lent shocks of earthquakes, with contrary and conflicting winds, which swelled the water in the Corinthian gulf, above the tops of trees on the shore. This was in the winter, during the night, and just before the battle of Leuctra. It is fortunate for us that we have a correct account of this inundation; for it perfectly unfolds the true history of the deluges in the time of Ogyges and Deucalion.</P>
<P>In the year of Rome 391, there was an extraordinary dark∣ness in Italy, during the greatest part of the day; dilata nox usque ad plurimam partem diei;" and a singular hail storm.</P>
<BIBL>Muratori, vol. 1. 11.</BIBL>
<P>In the year of Rome 405 and B. C. 349, a pestilence is mentioned, but with no circumstances that deserve notice, ex∣cept that it was in time of peace and internal tranquillity. "Quum et foris pax et domi concordia ordinum otium esset, ne nimis laetaeres essent, pestilentia adorta"—and recourse was had to the Sybilline books and the Lectisturnium. The circumstance of the prevalence of plague in time of peace, will be often
<PB N="47" REF="036687_0051_100AA0D0DEA89A30"/>
noted, to refute the idle notion, that pestilential diseases are gen∣erated and propagated principally by armies in time of war.</P>
<P>☞ After writing the foregoing, I found in Pliny, Nat. Hist. lib. 2. 25, an account of a comet in "the hundred and eighth Olympiad, and year of Rome 398." It resembled at first a crest, but changed into the form of a spear. Now, the first year of the 108th Olympiad, according to common chro∣nology, corresponds with the year of Rome 406. There is therefore a difference between the common mode of reckoning by the Olympiads, and Pliny's mode, of at least eight years or two Olympiads.—By following the common mode, and placing the first year of the 108th Olympiad, against the 406th year of Rome, the appearance of this comet will coincide with the gen∣eral tenor of facts, hereafter to be related, and correspond nearly in time with the plague in Rome, mentioned above.</P>
<P>Nearly at the same time, there was an eruption of Etna, placed by authors in the year B. C. 350, corresponding with the year of Rome 404. It is probable this eruption was within a year or two of the appearance of the comet; according to many modern facts of the same kind.</P>
<P>In the year of Rome 422, a violent plague arose, which, says P. Diaconus, was supposed to proceed from corrupt air, un∣til the conspiracy of the Roman women to poison their husbands was detected; after which it was ascribed to that cause. Livy does not appear to credit popular opinion on this occasion. He says, "Foedus insequens annus; seu intemperie Caeli, seu hu∣mana fraude fuit"—Recourse was had to the usual remedies, driving the nail, and the Lectisternium.</P>

<P>In the year preceding, there was an inundation at Rhodes.</P>
<P>In the year of Rome 458, B. C. 296, commenced a most severe pestilence which continued for three or four years. In the third year, a hard winter appears to be related by Livy, who says, "the snow filled all places, nor was it possible to endure
<PB N="48" REF="036687_0052_100AA0D293BE94A8"/>
the weather abroad." This was however in the mountainous country of the Samnites. The Roman consuls celebrated their triumphs over the Samnites, during this mortal epidemic, and it was a curious spectacle to behold at the same time, triumphal and funeral processions, and lamentations for the dead, mingled with acclamations of joy.</P>
<BIBL>Orosius, b. 3. 21. Livy, b. 10. 31 et seq.</BIBL>
<P>This plague commenced with many alarming prodigies, and violent tempests. A remarkable cloud and extreme darkness, for the greater part of a day, is mentioned by Livy, under fa∣vor of which the Samnites attacked the Roman lines. This darkness is mentioned, on account of the frequency of the phe∣nomenon, during pestilential periods.—Perh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ps this appearance may be connected with the cause of pestilence.</P>
<P>The violence and duration of this plague induced the Romans to send to Epidaurus for Esculapius, which they imported in form of a serpent, and in the island of the Tyber, where it was first landed, they consecrated a temple to the God of Physic.</P>
<BIBL>Livy, Epit. 11.</BIBL>
<P>It is not improbable, that the first eruption of Lipari, re∣corded in history, happened during this period; as it was in the reign of Agathocles, who died a few years after the time of this pestilence. The eruption is mentioned by the historian Cal∣lias whose works are lost; but the authors who cited them, have mentioned these particulars, that the eruption continued for seve∣ral days, throwing great stones to the distance of a mile; and the sea boiling all round the island.</P>
<P>In the year of Rome 477, and B. C. 277, happened that re∣markable plague which is often mentioned, as particularly fatal to pregnant women and breeding cattle. "Gravis pestilentia urbem ac fines ejus invasit; quae, cum omnes, praecipue mulieres pecudesque corripiens, necatis in utero fooetibus, futura prole va∣cuabat."</P>
<BIBL>Orosius, lib. 4.</BIBL>
<P>This also happened in time of peace. The words of the histo∣rian are remarkable. "Sed Romanorum miseria nullis cessat in∣duciis. Consumitur morborum malis intercapedo bellorum; et
<PB N="49" REF="036687_0053_100AA0D632ADF408"/>
cum foris cessatur a proeliis, agitur introrsum ira de coelo." The miseries of the Romans have no truce. The intervals between their wars are wasted with the calamities of sickness; and when they are exempt from war abroad, they are afflicted by the wrath of hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en at home.</P>
<P>Short on air has placed this disease in the year of the world 3712, corresponding with the year of Rome 462, but his chro∣nology is often inaccurate.</P>
<P>In the year of Rome 482, a pestilence broke out in Rome, and raged two or three years, carrying off countless multitudes of people. This was preceded by an eruption of fire at Calenum, which continued for three days and nights, destroying the soil for a considerable extent. This period also was distinguished by earthquakes, in the third year of the pestilence.</P>
<BIBL>Orosius. b. 4. P. Diaconus.</BIBL>
<P>This period was memorable for a severe winter. The snow, to a prodigious depth, lay in the forum for forty days.</P>
<P>It will be found as we proceed with this history, that most of such extraordinary seasons and unusual concurrence of great agi∣tations in nature, happen during volcanic eruptions and the ap∣proach of comets to the solar system of which this globe is a part. That comets were visible, during the calamitous periods mentioned in the Roman history is probable; but unfortunately few instances are recorded, until after the Christian era.—Not an eruption of Vesuvius is mentioned, and I cannot find more than fourteen instances of eruptions from Etna, anterior to the same era. This defect of history is of no small concern in a treatise of this kind.</P>
<P>In the year of Rome 529 and B. C. 225, the Roman armies which were marching into Gaul, were retarded by violent rains, and the plague which infected the soldiers. The Romans were, as usual on such occasions, frightened at numerous prodigies. In Hetruria, uncommon lights were seen in the sky. Meteors were seen at Ariminum, and the waters of a river in Picenum appeared

<P>Some of the prodigies, mentioned by Roman historians, and which have been ridiculed by moderns who are too wise to study the operations of nature, aad too proud to believe in extraordina∣ry occurrences, will be hereafter explained.</P>
<P>During the battle near the Lake Thrasamene, a severe earth∣quake was experienced, which, it is said, the armies did not perceive. Pliny Nat. Hist. lib. 2. 84. This was in the year of Rome 536, and B. C. 218; in which year, Livy relates, b. 21. 61, there was a severe winter. Scipio was besieging a town in Spain, near the present Barcelona▪ and for thirty days, the snow was four feet deep. This is mentioned as a circum∣stance very unfavorable for the besiegers. I cannot help re∣marking how closely connected in time are great frosts and vio∣lent earthquakes. This was the winter in which Hannibal cros∣sed the Alps and entered Italy. He reached the Alps early in November and was nine days in arriving to the summit. His ar∣my suffered incredible hardships and losses from deep snow, bad roads, and the natives who killed many of the troops. At the end of fifteen days, he gave his troops rest, on the hills near the foot of the Alps, and altho the snow was deep on the mountains, he found in the vales, pasturage for his horses and elephants. He prosecuted his route in the winter, suffering great hardships from snow, and more from rains, which swelled the rivers. Early in the spring he crossed the Appenine, and here his troops again suf∣fered from a snow storm.</P>

<P>At the siege of Syracuse by Marcellus in the year of Rome 541 and B. C. 213, happened a remarkable mortality, among the troops, but especially among the Cathaginians, who all perished with their Generals, Hippocrates and Himilco. Of this pesti∣lence,
<PB N="51" REF="036687_0055_100AA0DA1004C4E0"/>
Livy gives the following account, b. 25. 26. "A pestilence broke out in both armies, which diverted their minds from the concerns of the war; for it was in autumn, and in a sit∣uation naturally unhealthy. The heat, which was more severe without the city than within, affected almost every person in both the camps. At first, persons sickened and died, by reason of the unwholesomeness of the place; afterwards the diseases spread by infection, so that those who were seized, were neglected, or aban∣doned and died, or their attendants contracted the same disease. Daily burials and death were before their eyes, and day and night their ears were assailed with lamentations. At length the survi∣vors became hardened; they neither grieved at the death of oth∣ers, nor took pains to bury the dead; and the bodies of the de∣ceased lay scattered along the streets, in sight of those who were expecting the same fate. The dead infected the sick, and the sick, those in health, with terror and pestiferous stench; and some, preferring death by the sword, rushed on the posts of the enemy.</P>
<P>But the disease was much more severe and fatal to the Cartha∣ginians, than to the Romans, who, in this long siege, had be∣come accustomed to the air and water. The Sicilian troops, on the first breaking out of the disease, abandoned their allies, and returned to their homes. The Carthaginians, who had no means of shelter, all perished. Marcellus, to avoid the evil, drew his troops into the city, where their enfeebled bodies were refreshed by the shades of the houses. Many however of the Roman ar∣my, died of the same disease."</P>
<P>It is observable that heat and position augmented the disease among the Carthaginians. They were encamped near a marsh or low ground; and exposed to the direct rays of a burning sun. The Romans had possession of one part of Syracuse, and had shelter under the buildings. These circumstances, and their not being accustomed to the air of the place, proved fatal to the whole Cathaginian army. Mr. Brydone learnt in Sicily from the histo∣riographer of Etna, Recupero, that there was a great eruption of Etna, during this siege of Syracuse. I have not met with an ac∣count of it in the original histories I have consulted.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="036687_0056_100AA0DD254BE1D0"/>In the same year, that this pestilence raged in Syracuse, a se∣vere pestilential epidemic prevailed in Rome. "Eo anno pesti∣lentia gravis incidit in urbem, agrosque; quae tamen magis in lon∣gos morbos, quam in perniciales, evasit."</P>
<BIBL>Livy, 27. 23.</BIBL>
<P>This fact is evidence of what will be fully proved in later peri∣ods of the world, that a pestilential state of air extends, at the same time, over many parts of the world; and that if a violent plague is raging in one place, malignant diseases, if not plague, prevail in other places.</P>
<P>Another important fact related in the last quotation, is that the pestilence in Rome was the bilious plague, as it was not so mortal, as it was troublesome, by running out into long diseases.</P>
<P>It is a known fact and not unfrequent, that the Yellow Fever, in our climate, is reduceable to a bilious remittent and even to an intermittent; the pestilence on board the ships at Bulama of∣ten ran out into long and obstinate intermittents. The fever in Baltimore in 1797 began in the form of a bilious remittent, and continued in that form for many weeks, before it assumed the symptoms of a malignant Yellow Fever.</P>
<P>The Roman and Carthaginian armies in Bruttium, a town in the southern part of the Kingdom of Naples, suffered greatly by a pestilential disease, in the year of Rome 548; but no particu∣lars worthy of notice are recorded.</P>
<BIBL>Livy, b. 28. 46</BIBL>
<P>It is however to be remarked that this period of pestilence was distinguished by the appearance of immense swarms of locusts, which overspread the whole country about Capua. Their appear∣ance was subsequent to the plague mentioned in the armies. We shall have frequent occasion to mention the same phenomenon in the natural world, as cotemporary with pestilence. But clouds of these animals rarely or never appear at any other time, than during or near the time of the prevalence of plagues; and by comparing the dates of their appearance, it will be found, that they are not, unless by accident, the cause of plague, nor the effect; but, like other animals which are generated in myriads, during pestilence, the produce of some general cause, and probably of that state of the elements, which occasions the diseases of the human race.</P>

But it was in the midst of sum∣mer, and the place unwholesome; and the men, unaccustomed to the air, were seized with a pestilential disease, especially the rowers.

<P>In the year of Rome 571 and B. C. 182 commenced a violent plague, which lasted several years, and ravaged Rome and all It∣aly so that the Romans could not enlist 8000 soldiers to quell a revolt. In the next year, Livy mentions a drouth of six months, and a consequent dearth of corn.</P>
<P>It will be remarked by any man who reads history with atten∣tion, that during pestilential periods, all the ordinary operations of nature acquire unusual strength and magnitude. Earthquakes and tempests are vastly more violent, than at other times. The an∣cient historians, evidently without design, have left proofs of this fact. Thus Livy mentions, that during the period under conside∣ration, the operations of the war in Spain ware retarded by con∣tinual rains, which swelled the rivers, and Flaccus, the Praetor, was compelled, tempestatibus foedis, terrible storms, to order his whole army into a city in the neighborhood.</P>
<BIBL>Livy, b. 40. 33. and sec. 29. 36.</BIBL>
<P>The spring of the year 571 was remarkably tempestuous, and Livy gives a frightful account of a storm in Rome which did no small injury to the public buildings.</P>
<BIBL>B. 40. 2.</BIBL>
<P>Short has placed this pestilence in the year of the world 3763, corresponding according to Usher with the year of Rome 507. But Short's chronology is wretched. He mentions a large comet six years after this period, of the size of the sun and of a fiery color. Of the appearance of a comet at the period under con∣sideration, there can be no doubt, tho I have not found the origin∣al
<PB N="54" REF="036687_0058_100AA0E19608BB58"/>
writer who mentions it and Short quotes no authority but Pozel. He however has made an egregious blunder in the time, as he has in many other instances of facts which he relates, of high an∣tiquity.</P>
<P>The order of the great phenomena of nature seems to be that violent storms, rain and a cold winter, are followed the next year with excessive heat and drouth and vice versa. Violent storms however occur at all times during these periods. It will be noted, that the pestilence above mentioned could not be occasioned by the drouth and dearth of corn, for it broke out in the year preceding. The same fact often occurs, and proves that great pestilence is not solely the effect of intemperate seasons, but that both are the ef∣fects of another cause.</P>
<P>The present instance is one, in which a most severe winter fol∣lowed the other unusual seasons. In the year 574, according to Hook, and the consulship of Q. Fulvius and L. Manlius, the winter was remarkable for deep snow and every kind of tempest. It continued longer than usual, and trees, exposed to the weath∣er, were blasted. An earthquake happened, in the following year.</P>
<BIBL>Livy, b. 40. 45. 59.</BIBL>
<P>This then fixes the year of the appearance of the comet, mentioned by Short. That he refers to the same period is cer∣tain from his mentioning the circumstance of the inability of the Roman senate to raise a body of 8000 men; a fact assigned by Hook to the year 571, and which can belong to no other period. But from his description of this star, I am inclined to believe he refers to that which is hereafter mentioned, under the great pesti∣lence of 610, and which Pliny has well described.</P>
<P>This uncommon season was succeeded in 576 by pestilence among cattle, and the next year, followed the plague, which made dreadful havoc in Rome. Some facts stated by the histo∣rian deserve particular notice. "Pestilentia, quae priore anno in boves ingruerat, eo verteret in hominum morbos. Qui incide∣rant, haud facile septimum diem superabant: qui superaverant, longinquo, maxime quartanae, implicabantur morbo. Servitia maxime moriebantur; eorum strages per omnes vias insepulto∣rum erat. Ne liberorum quidem funeribus subficiebat. Cadave∣ra,

<BIBL>Livy b. 41. 21.</BIBL>
<P>It is not easy to do justice to this energetic description of the historian, but the following is the sense of the passage. "The pes∣tilence which had affected cattle in the former year, now turned into diseases of men. Those who were seized scarcely lived be∣yond the seventh day; those who survived that day, were afflict∣ed with tedious dist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pers, especially the quartan ague. The disease made its most fatal ravages among the slaves, whose dead bodies lay unburied along the highways. It was not possible to bury the bodies of the free citizens. Their corpses lay unburied, untouched by dogs and vultures, and wasted away by corruption. It was evident that in this and the former year, during the great mortality among men and cattle, no vulture was seen."</P>
<P>In this account, the following particulars are noticeable.</P>
<P N="1">1st. That the pestilential air first produced its effects on cattle.</P>
<P N="2">2d. That the <HI>seventh</HI> was the critical day—as it usually is, in modern bilious plague.</P>
<P N="3">3d. That if the disease had a favorable crisis on the seventh day, the patient survived, but the distemper changed into an au∣tumnal bilious fever of the quartan type, and long duration—a strong evidence of what I have before remarked that, if pestis and pestilentia are diseases of a distinct species, the Roman pestilence was the bilious plague.</P>
<P N="4">4th. This pestilence was, as usual, most mortal among the lower orders of people.</P>
<P N="5">5th. Carnivorous animals would not touch the dead bodies, and vultures deserted the atmosphere of Rome.</P>
<P>The last fact is common in <HI>great</HI> plagues; but in plagues of a less malignancy, animals do not quit the infected places. These facts seem to indicate that birds perceive the pestilential state of air, before it becomes sensible to the human species. It seems that the vultures disappeared, the first year, while the pestilence was confined to cattle; and there can be little doubt, that the del∣icate organs of fowls perceive the derangement of the air, whether
<PB N="56" REF="036687_0060_100AA0E4C3589910"/>
the cause may be, the infusion into it of a pestiferous vapor, of the abstraction from it of a portion of the vital principle, before its effects are visible in larger animals, and before the air is ren∣dered offensive by the carcases of diseased and dead animals.</P>
<P>This was one of those violent and long continued plagues of which history has recorded many instances; and the Romans on this occasion, saw many prodigies. It is difficult, in some ca∣ses, to distinguish, in the relations of historians, truth from vul∣gar report; and philosophy must guard against the illusions of credulity and terrified imaginations. I take no notice of the monsters born, and an ox's speaking, on these occasions. At the beginning of the late American war, many similar prodigies were announced and believed by the ignorant and credulous. But some of the phenomena, enumerated by Livy among prod∣igies, in all probability, had a real existence, for it will be re∣lated hereafter that similar appearances have been observed, in modern times, during pestilence, and appear evidently to have a connection with its causes.</P>
<P>During the plague above mentioned, a bow was seen in the sky, in a serene day, extended over the temple of Saturn in the Roman forum; three suns or haloes appeared, and at night many torches, or meteors descended in Lanuvium. There is strong evidence for believing these phenomena to be occasioned by a vapor emitted from the earth, in superabundant quantities, and which there is reason to think, may be the cause of pestilen∣tial diseases; or there may be some changes in the combination of substances composing the atmosphere.</P>
<P>At the close of this pestilential period, in 581, Apulia was deluged by swarms of locusts; as the Pontine territory had been the year before. So destructive were their ravages, that the Praetor Sicinius was sent with an army to drive them away.</P>
<BIBL>Livy, b. 42. 2 &amp; 10.</BIBL>
<P>Orosius b. 4 relates, that a most violent plague desolated Rome in the year 610 and B. C. 144. The dead bodies lay pu∣trefying in the houses and streets, and rendered it impossible to approach the city. In the preceding year appeared a remarkable comet. As we come down to the more authentic periods of his∣tory, this phenomenon will more frequently occur.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="036687_0061_100AA0E9E05D08C0"/>It is again necessary to remark a difference in the chronology of different authors. Seneca places the appearance of this comet, which he describes to have been as large and luminous as the sun, "Post mortem Demetrii Syriae Regis, paulo ante Achaicum Bellum"—after the death of Demetrius, king of Syria, and a little before the Achean war.</P>
<BIBL>Nat. Quest. lib. 7. 15.</BIBL>
<P>Demetrius was slain, B. C. 151, according to common chro∣nology, and the Achean war was in the year when Carthage was taken and destroyed by Scipio, B. C. 146. The appearance of the comet therefore should be placed in the year preceding, or 147, corresponding with the year of Rome, 607. And this is proba∣bly correct, for it is agreeable to general observation, that a comet appears early in the pestilential period, and often <HI>precedes</HI> its most calamitous years.—The Encyclopedia assigns it to the year 146.</P>
<P>Seneca remarks that at first it appeared fiery and red, emitting a bright light, so as to overcome the darkness of the night. Gradually its magnitude lessened and its brightness vanished.</P>
<P>This plague was still more deadly than that in which Camillus died.</P>
<BIBL>Muratori, vol. 1.</BIBL>
<P>In the year of Rome 628, and B. C. 126, historians relate, that a most dreadful pestilence arose in Africa, from dead lo∣custs. These animals were brought towards Numidia and Utica, by a strong east wind, in such innumerable multitudes, that they devoured every green thing—not sparing even the bark of trees. They were driven by the south wind into the Mediterranean, and being washed on shore, in the hot season, they putrefied, and caused a most deadly plague. It is related that 800,000 persons perished in Numidia alone; 200,000 on the sea coast of Carthage and Utica, and 30,000 of the Roman troops. No less than 1500 dead bodies were carried out of one gate of U∣tica, in a single day.</P>
<BIBL>Livy, Epit. 60. Orosius, lib. 5. P. Diac. August. Hist. 813.</BIBL>
<P>Authors ascribe this plague to the dead locusts; and doubt∣less that cause had its influence. At the same time, there is no
<PB N="58" REF="036687_0062_100AA0EB66EDDDB8"/>
necessity of resorting to the locusts, for this was a time of gene∣ral pestilence. The same state of air or other elements which favored the generation of disease, first existed, and produced this unusual number of locusts. This will appear in subsequent parts of this history.</P>
<P>Orosius gives a most hideous account of the pestiferous state of air from the locusts. He avers that birds, cattle and wild beasts perished by means of the corruption of the air, and thus in∣creased the evil. He remarks further that, altho locusts had often appeared in his days, in great numbers, yet they never be∣fore had done more mischief when dead, than when living, so as to cause mankind to wish they had not perished.</P>
<P>We must accede to the opinion of the ancients that the stench of the locusts was one cause of the pestilence; it is possible that no epidemic disease would have been excited without that cause; but it is equally true, that in a healthy state of the atmosphere, no putrefaction of dead bodies has ever been known to produce an epidemic pestilence. It may be powerful enough to excite disease within a small extent of its own atmosphere; but if no other cause of disease exists, it will not extend beyond that in∣fected atmosphere.</P>
<P>The appearance of immense multitudes of locusts, during pestilence, is a curious fact in natural history, and well deserves investigation; but these animals do not always <HI>precede</HI> the ap∣pearance of the diseases of the same period, nor do they often perish in such collections as to be the <HI>cause</HI> of those diseases. The common idea in Arabia, is, that they are generated by heat and drouth. Cold and rains are supposed to destroy their eggs.</P>
<P>About the beginning of this destructive period, appeared a comet. The Encyclopedia mentions <HI>two,</HI> in the year of Rome 629, and B. C. 125. But it is probable this is a mistake of the compilers. The universal history places one under the year 630, and a second under the following year, quoting Justin, for au∣thority. But Justin mentions two comets, one at the birth of Mithridates, another in the year he began to reign. Now Mi∣thridates was about eleven or twelve years old when he came to
<PB N="59" REF="036687_0063_100AA0ECF17A9C58"/>
the throne, in the year of Rome 631, and B. C. 123. Of course the first comet must have been about the year 620, and B. C. 134.</P>
<P>It is no inconsiderable proof of the truth of Justin's account, and of the accuracy of our chronology in this particular, that there was an eruption of the great volcano of Sicily, in both the pe∣riods when these comets are said to have appeared. In the year 620, and B. C. 134, there was an eruption of Etna, tho not mentioned by Justin; and this was the year of the first great comet, and of the birth of Mithridates. Nine years after, in 629, there was a second eruption of Etna. The last year cor∣responds nearly with the period in which Mithridates began to reign, allowing him to be eleven years old, and with the ap∣proach of the second comet.</P>
<P>This last comet produced most tremendous effects, as we might expect from its magnitude, and proximity to the earth. The following is Justin's description of it. "Nam et eo quo genitus est anno, et eo quo regnare primum coepit, stella cometes, per utrumque tempus, 70 diebus ita luxit, ut coelum omne fla∣grare videreter." For 70 days the heavens appeared to be in a flame.</P>
<BIBL>Lib. 37. 2.</BIBL>
<P>The eruptions of the volcano were equally remarkable.</P>
<P>The lava from Etna laid waste the city and suburbs of Catana.</P>
<P>Aetna ultra solitum exarsit, says the historian; Catanam ur∣bem <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inesque oppressit."</P>
<BIBL>Orosius, lib. 5.</BIBL>
<P>In Paulus Diaconus we have a relation of singular facts in re∣gard to the eruption of Etna. Globes of fire were thrown from the Crater. Lipari, a small volcanic island on the north of Si∣cily, became so heated, during the eruption, that the rocks were dissolved, tho it is not said that this island discharged any fire. The water of the neighboring sea was so heated as to kill the fish, and melt the pitch on the decks of vessels. Dead fish ap∣peared on the surface of the water, and many persons, who were near the island, were suffocated with heat.</P>
<P>This author places the appearance of the locusts which cau∣sed the plague in Africa, in the year <HI>after</HI> the eruption of Etna.
<PB N="60" REF="036687_0064_100AA0EF49A17C10"/>
Others place this event, a year <HI>before</HI> the eruption. It is much to be regretted that authors have been so careless of the chronol∣ogy of important phenomena, on the <HI>order</HI> of which may de∣pend important principles. This however is certain, that all the great agitations of nature here related belong to the same period, and it is not surprising that they were attended with most mortal pestilence.</P>

<P>The foregoing period of pestilence was one of the most dread∣ful on record.</P>
<P>It will be found invariably true, in every period of the world, that the violence and extent of the plague has been nearly pro∣portioned to the number and violence of the following phenome∣na—earthquakes, eruptions of volcanoes, meteors, tempests, in∣undations</P>

<P>It must have been during this period that the comet appeared which is mentioned by Pliny. Nat. Hist. lib. 2. cap 25. "Civili motu, Octavio Consule," for this was the year, in which Octavius was Consul. This period was preceded by an extraordinary collision and disrupture of two mountains, and the bursting of fire from the chasm, in the territory of Modena. Pli∣ny assures us, this was seen from the Emilian way, by an immense number of Roman knights and others.</P>
<BIBL>Pliny Nat. Hist. lib. 2. 83.</BIBL>
<P>With this period corresponds the eruption of a volcano in Hi∣era, one of the Aeolian isles, north of Sicily, now called Lipari, which burnt for several days, and the very sea around it appeared to be fire. Pliny says this was during the Social War.</P>

<P>The year B. C. 44 was distinguished by the death of Julius Cesar, by the hands of conspirators; soon after which appeared a comet, supposed to be the same which appeared in

1680, whose period is calculated to be 575 years. If this is its period, it must have been seen in the year B. C. 1767, in the reign of Ogyges, when Attica was inundated and rendered barren for a number of years; and when the planet Venus is said to have changed her figure, color and course. When we survey the uniform effects of comets in tempests and floods, and compare the traditional account of that event with the terrible inundations which have happened in Greece at other times, and especially with that in the time of Thucydides, which rent Ata∣lanta from the main land; which events all took place during the approach of comets; we are constrained to believe the fact of the Ogygean deluge, and fable rises to the dignity of authentic history. This inundation might have happened during the approach of some other comet, but the probability is, that it was during that of the comet under consideration, which fixes the time of the Ogygean flood, in the year B. C. 1767. This circum∣stance may serve to correct the chronology of the early events in Greece.</P>
<BIBL>See Jackson's chronology vol. 3. 312.</BIBL>
<P>Its next appearance must have been in the year A. C. 1193, when Electra, one of the pleiads, abandoned her sister orbs, and fled from the Zodiac to the north pole.</P>
<P>Its third appearance corresponds with the year A. C. 618, the year of the terrible comet of the Sybill, says Gibbon; and its fourth, is the one under consideration. Its subsequent appear∣ances A. D. 531, 1106 and 1680 will be hereafter mentioned. All the periods here named, which come within the limits of authentic history, have been remarkable for pestilence, earth∣quakes, inundations or other great phenomena. Such was the fact in 44 and 43. There was a terrible inundation of the Tyber, a violent earthquake, many unusual pheno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ena in the sky, and in the year 43, a violent eruption of Etna—Pesti∣lence, as usual, accompanied these events.</P>
<P>But another phenomenon, the paleness or defect of light, in the sun, deserves more particular attention. Pliny asserts that this pale color lasted almost a year. His words are, "Fiunt prodigiosi et longiores solis defectus, qualis occiso dictatore Cae∣sare
<PB N="62" REF="036687_0066_100AA0F494644A88"/>
et Antoniano bello, totius pene anni pallore continuo." Nat. Hist. lib. 2. 30.—Virgil and Ovid, who were eye wit∣nesses of this phenomenon, have both described it, with the other prodigies of this period.</P>

<P>The words <HI>ferrugo</HI> and <HI>luridus</HI> give us an exact idea of the color—a paleness tinctured with the color of rust. A similar defect of light in the sun occurred at the time of the next ap∣pearance of this comet, A. D. 531, as will be hereafter related. The fact is curious. It is well known that this comet ap∣proaches very near to the sun; but whether the defect of splen∣dor in the sun was the effect of the attractive powers of the comet, or of an alteration in the electrical atmosphere of these bodies; or whether it was occasioned by an alteration in the ter∣restrial atmosphere, is a question not easily solved. It might have been owing to a vapor, like that which overspread Europe in 1783.</P>
<P>This period was marked with famin also, with shooting stars, and numerous prodigies.</P>
<BIBL>See Virgil and Ovid in the passages quoted. See also, Zonoras' Annals, lib. 10. Usher's An. p. 680.</BIBL>
<P>The comet appeared in 44 and also the pestilence—the erup∣tion of Etna in 43 B. C. and therefore subsequent to the other events. Indeed it is more generally the case, that the volcano does not emit fire until some time <HI>after</HI> the appearance of the plague. To this however there are exceptions. Most of the great plagues appear two or three years, with different degrees of violence; and during this period, volcanoes discharge im∣mense quantities of lava.</P>
<P>By a paragraph in Usher's Annals, p. 684, it appears the winter following the appearance of this comet, was severe.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="036687_0067_100AA0F61D148CB0"/>The next pestilential period commenced in the year 30 B. C. An eruption of Etna, which laid all the neighboring towns in ruins, marked the commencement of this period, which how∣ever was preceded in 31 by an earthquake in Judea, in which thousands of people perished in the ruins of their houses. About the same time appeared, says Dion Cassius, "those meteors which the Greeks call comets." These phenomena were fol∣lowed by a pestilence in Jerusalem, which destroyed a great part of the nobles and people of the Jews. The same period was marked by a great inunda<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the Tyber, which spread over the low grounds of Rome, and was considered as an omen of the future power of Augustus.</P>

<P>By a curious circumstance, we learn that a hard winter and pestilence afflicted Rome at this period. The Emperor Octavi∣us Augustus, in his 5th Consulship, B. C. 29, had formed the design of resigning the empire. Horace, the Poet, his friend and flatterer, endeavored to dissuade him from this purpose, on account of the prodigies which happened at the beginning of the year, which was the winter of the year 30 B. C. and corresponds exactly with the appearance of the comet. Among these prod∣igies, the poet enumerates an abundance of snow, terrible hail, thunder and lightning, and a destructive inundation of the Tyber.</P>

<P>It is a fact of which there is full evidence, that during the ap∣proach of comets, not only tempests are more violent, than at other times, but the ocean swells without winds—the tides are much higher and high tides are more numerous. The ancients
<PB N="64" REF="036687_0068_100AA0F7F540FEE0"/>
took notice of this fact, and it came under my own observation, during the approach of the comet in 1797.</P>
<P>In the 21st ode of the same book, Horace addresses Apollo who "drives war, famin and pestilence from the Roman people and the Emperor, to the Persians and Britons."</P>
<P>This passage is proof that the Romans found pestilence in Brit∣ain; but the Britons, at that time, had no trade, except with the coast of France. How or from what quarter, they <HI>imported the infection,</HI> is left for the solution of Dr. Mead's followers.</P>
<P>In the year B. C. 25, according to the Universal History, a violent pestilence raged in Rome, an inundation laid a great part of the city under water, lands were left untilled and a famin en∣sued.</P>
<P>The same year, the plague raged in Palestine, which was <HI>pre∣ceded</HI> by a severe drouth and a dearth of corn. A hard winter is mentioned about the same time, but the order of this event is not recorded.</P>

<P>This pestilence was preceded the year before, by "epidemic distempers which proved fatal to many."

But it appears, that the malignant distempers, which are found to be the constant precursors of pestilence, were epidemic, in the year <HI>preceding</HI> the famin—a demonstration that the <HI>general</HI> cause, in the state of air, existed anterior to the dearth.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION III. Historical view of pestilential epidemics from the Christian era, to the year 1347.</HEAD>
<P>AT the close of the reign of Augustus, about the year 14 or according to some authors 16 of the Christian era, there was a great famin in Rome, and a comet is mentioned, near the same time, by Dion Cassius. This was followed by a most terrible pestilence in the east, during which twelve cities of Asia Minor were overthrown by earthquakes. Of these ca∣lamitous events, the following is the account recorded by Taci∣tus, An. lib. 2. 47. "Eodem anno, duodecem celebres Asiae urb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s conlapsae nocturno motu terrae, quo improvisior gravior∣que pestis fuit. Neque solitum in tali casu effugium subveniebat in aperta prorumpendi, quia diductis terris hauriebantur: Sedis∣se immensos montes, visa in arduo quae plana fuerint, effulsisse inter ruinam ignis memorant."</P>
<P>It is a circumstance not to be overlooked that the plague was prevalent, anterior to this dreadful earthquake, as the historian remarks that this catastrophe rendered the sickness more severe and less tolerable. Such is the usual course of these calamities; the pestilence appears, <HI>before</HI> the most destructive shocks of the earth, which rarely fail to occur, during its prevalence. It is to be observed also that men obtained no security, in this in∣stance, by flying to open places, for the earth opened and swal∣lowed them up—fire also issued from the earth. Large moun∣tains subsided to plains, and plains were thrown into mountains.</P>

<P>The close of the reign of Claudius and the beginning of the reign of Nero, A. D. 53 and 4, were marked by a similar train of phenomena and calamities. A comet is noted by Sue∣tonius and Pliny about the year 54, the year in which Claudius was poisoned. Tacitus relates that people were alarmed by fre∣quent shocks of earthquakes, which demolished many buildings, and great dearth of corn prevailed in Rome and Greece. Pliny records that thr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> suns, by which are doubtless intended, halos or mock suns, appeared the same year. These were considered by the ancients as prodigies; but tho common phenomena, they are remarkably luminous, and frequent in the periods of pesti∣lence.</P>

<P>This period was sickly, tho not recorded as pestilential. Su∣etonius remarks, "Ex omnium Magistratum generi, plerique mortem obierant." Many of all kinds of public officers died; by which we infer that the year was sickly.</P>
<P>In the reign of Nero occurred the next pestilential period. Two comets are noted, one A. D. 62 and a second in 66. In the year 62, Laodicea was overwhelmed by an earthquake. In the year 68, occurred a most violent tempest in Campania which destroyed villages, trees and grain; and a violent earthquake. At the same time, raged a mortal plague in Rome, which is said to have carried off 30,000 people; but by the description of its
<PB N="67" REF="036687_0071_100AA0FFDF7FCFF0"/>
ravages, it is probable the number was much greater. Tacitus remarks that the "houses were filled with dead bodies and the streets with funerals; neither age nor sex was exempt; slaves and ingenuous plebeians were suddenly taken off, amidst the la∣mentations of their wives and children, who, while they assisted the sick, or mourned over the dead, were seized with the disease, and perishing, were burnt on the same funeral pile. To the knights and senators, the disease was less mortal, tho these also suffered in the common calamity."</P>
<P>As Rome, at the time under consideration, contained more than a million of inhabitants, so mortal a plague must have ex∣tinguished a much larger number than 30,000 people—it is not improbable, a numeral or figure has been omitted by the trans∣cribers of the original history.</P>
<P>The earthquakes of this period were experienced in Asia Mi∣nor, at Laodicea and Hierapolis.</P>
<P>Seneca mentions that a flock of 600 sheep were killed by the pestiferous vapor, discharged during the earthquake in Italy.</P>
<P>Dion Cassius relates, that at this period, a most formidable in∣undation laid waste the Egyptian coast.</P>
<P>It must not be omitted that the violent tempest in which St. Paul was shipwrecked on the island of Melita, now Malta, was in the year 61 or 62, during the approach of the first comet.</P>
<P>Tacitus remarks, that no visible cause could be assigned for the pestilence of this period; "Nulla Coeli intemperie quae occur∣reret occulis." No remarkable season had occurred, to which this distemper could be ascribed. We shall find, in subsequent periods, distinguished writers making similar remarks. The rea∣son is, these authors did not take a view sufficiently comprehen∣sive of the operations of nature; and if the cause of plague could not be found, <HI>very near in time and place,</HI> they did not observe it. It is true, that an extraordinary season does not always precede or attend pestilence, in a particular place; but by extending our view of the subject, to general causes, operating over whole quar∣ters of the globe, and perhaps over the whole globe; and con∣sidering the causes, as invisible, and acting for a series of years,
<PB N="68" REF="036687_0072_100AA1016CB071E8"/>
the whole mystery is unfolded.—Such may be the result of this investigation.</P>

<P>Seneca places the great earthquake in Campania under the Consulship of Regulus and Virginius, which, according to com∣mon chronology, was in the 65th year of the Christian era.</P>
<P>The next pestilential period is one of the most remarkable in all the circumstances, that is recorded in History.</P>
<P>In the year 79 [some authors say a year later, but the diffe∣rence is of no moment, as they agree in the <HI>order</HI> of the events related] just before the death of Vespasian, appeared a comet with a long coma in the month of June. On the first of Novem∣ber following, a most tremendous ebullition of fire and lava issu∣ed from Vesuvius and laid waste the neighboring country. At the same time, happened a violent earthquake, which buried the cities of Herculaneum and Pompeium; and so sudden was the shock, that the people, who were attending a play, had not time to quit the theater, and were all buried in a mass.</P>
<P>This dreadful catastrophe was preceded by rumbling noises in the earth, and the earth was heated to a great degree. Violent agitations of the sea, thunder and lightning also announced the approach of some dreadful event.</P>
<P>The eruption lasted three days, during which time such im∣mense quantities of ashes and smoke were discharged, that day was turned into night, and the ashes were driven by different winds to Rome, Syria and Africa.</P>
<P>The agitations of the earth and the elements were tremendous and frighful. Baronius remarks, that some persons supposed the world would be reduced to chaos, or consumed with fire. The fish in the neighboring seas were destroyed.</P>
<P>This explosion of subterranean fire was <HI>preceded</HI> by a severe drouth in Italy. The next year, 80, was remarkable for a terri∣ble inundation in England; the Severn overflowing a large tract of country, and destroying multitudes of cattle.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="036687_0073_100AA105C963B790"/>These violent effects of subterranean fire were attended by one of the most fatal plagues recorded in history. A remark of Dion is here very important. He says that the "Ashes from Vesuvi∣us caused, at the time, only slight indispositions or diseases; but afterwards produced an Epidemic distemper," The remark is incorrect, in ascribing even slight diseases to ashes; but it leads to a conclusion, which is of moment. The slight complaints which prevailed in the autumn of the year of the eruption, com∣pared with modern observations, appear to have been the <HI>precur∣sors</HI> of the plague, which broke out the next year, and as au∣thors assert, destroyed, for some time, 10,000 citizens of Rome in a day.—The same year, while the Emperor Titus was view∣ing the ruins in Campania, a fire broke out in the city, which laid in ashes a great number of buildings.</P>
<P>The order of the events in this period was, a comet, drouth, slight diseases, and an eruption of Vesuvius, with the earth∣quakes, the first year.—In the second, appeared the pestilence with its most malignant effects.</P>
<P>In this eruption of Vesuvius, the first recorded in history, per∣ished the elder Pliny; and the Emperor Titus fell a victim to his paternal care of his subjects.</P>

<P>In the year 90 appeared a comet. The plague is said to have appeared in the north of England in 88, and in 92, to have de∣stroyed 150,000 lives in Scotland.</P>
<BIBL>Short, vol. 2. 207.</BIBL>
<P>In 102 a plague is said to have arisen from dead fish driven on shore, but I have no other particulars.</P>
<P>In the year 107 four cities of Asia, two in Greece and three in Galatia, were overwhelmed by an earthquake. A comet is mentioned by Short in 109▪ but as I have not found the original authority, I cannot depend on the accuracy of the chronology. It is probable that these phenomena occurred within the same year; and there is the more reason to believe this, as different and respectable authors differ two or three years in the chronology of Roman history. The next event to be related, is a re∣markable instance of the truth of this observation.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="036687_0074_100AA10805F592E0"/>Short mentions a plague in Wales in 114 which destroyed 45,000 lives; but I have not the history of the facts.</P>
<P>In the reign of Trajan, the city of Antioch was almost to∣tally demolished by an earthquake. This emperor was in the city at the time, and narrowly escaped with his life. Some au∣thors place this event in the year 114; others in 115; but Ba∣ronius has proved by an ancient inscription, that it happened under the consulate of P. Vipstanus Messala and M. Virgilianus Pedo; which brings the event to the year 117. A comet was visible the same year.</P>
<P>The earthquakes of this period were extremely violent—ma∣ny cities were overthrown, mountains sunk, rivers were dried up and new fountains appeared.</P>
<P>Aurelius Victor adds to these calamities a great inundation of the Tyber, violent pestilence and famin; but to which of the periods, the year 107 or 117, he alludes, is not quite certain, tho probably to the latter. "Terrae motus gravis per provin∣cias multas, atroxque pestilentia, famesque et inundia facta sunt."</P>
<P>To remedy the danger from fire and earthquakes, Trajan limited the height of houses in Rome to 60 feet; and for that regulation obtained the title of "Father of the Country."</P>
<P>The great earthquake at Antioch was accompanied with fierce winds, a circumstance not very common; it being more usual that shocks of the earth happen during a perfect serenity and tranquillity of the atmosphere, unless in the vicinity of volca∣noes.</P>
<BIBL>Aurel. Victor. Epit. Trajan. Dion Cassius. Baronius vol. 2. 55. Echard's Rom. Hist. vol. 2. 276.</BIBL>
<P>During the time that Trajan was making war on the Agarini, a people of Arabia, which had revolted from the Roman gov∣ernment, flies in myriads appeared and covered every vessel and utensil, so that the Emperor was compelled to abandon the ex∣pedition. This was near the time of the earthquake which de∣stroyed Antioch.</P>

<P>This fact ought not to be omitted; as the generation of innu∣merable insects is one of the phenomena which generally attend a great pestilence—The same season was marked by terrible storms of wind, rain and hail-stones of unusual size. The win∣ter

succeeding that in which Antioch was destroyed, was so tempestuous, and the Tigris so swelled by deluges of rain, that Trajan's army suffered extreme hardships and great losses, in his expedition into Assyria.</P>
<P>Under the year 115, I find mentioned a sudden and violent inundation of the Severn in England, which drowned people in their beds, and destroyed 5000 head of cattle. Perhaps phi∣losophy will place this event, under the year of the earthquake at Antioch; whichever may be the true year, 115 or 117.</P>
<P>In the chronological tables, a great earthquake in China is mentioned under the year 114—the year of the plague in Wales.</P>
<P>Under the Emperor Adrian, say the compilers of the Mag∣deburgh history, from Eusebius, the greatest part of Nicomedia and Nicea was overthrown by earthquakes; and not long after, Nicopolis and Cesarea were totally overwhelmed. Functius as∣signs the fate of Nicomedia to the year 121, and that of Nicop∣olis to 129. By another writer is noted a comet in 127, and a plague in Scotland.</P>
<BIBL>Short, vol. 2. 207.</BIBL>
<P>In 137 appeared a comet, followed by the plague.—In this year or the subsequent one, the Thames was almost dry.</P>
<P>The plague again made great havoc in Scotland in 146.—An eruption of fire from Lipari happened in 144.</P>
<P>In the year 153 happened a severe winter of three months, which covered the Thames and all rivers with ice.</P>
<P>In the reign of Antoninus Pius, A. D. 154, occurred an earthquake which prostrated some towns in Asia and Rhodes. A comet appeared nearly at the same time, and a pestilence in Arabia, together with an inundation of the Tyber.</P>

<P>Of the general and fatal pestilence in the reign of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus and Lucius Verus, we have many accounts. It appeared in Rome in 167, but its origin was in Asia, a year or two earlier. Ammianus Marcellinus, the philosophic soldier, relates that this plague originated from the foul air of a small box or chest, which a Roman soldier had opened, in search of plunder, after the taking of Seleucia. Julius Capitolinus men∣tions
<PB N="72" REF="036687_0076_100AA10C4E6D34F0"/>
the same fact on the authority of mere vulgar report or tradition. "Et nata <HI>fertur</HI> pestilentia in Babylonia, ubi de templo Apollonis ex arcula aurea, quam milis forte inciderat, spiritus pestilens evasit, atque inde Parthos orbemque complesse."</P>
<P>A. Marcellinus gives a more particular account of this event. "Milites fanum scrutantes, invenere foramen angustum, quo re∣serato, ut pretiosum aliquid invenirent, ex adyto quodam con∣cluso a Chaldoeorum arcanis, labes primordalis exsilivit, quae in∣sanabilium vi concepta morborum, ejusdem Veri et Marci Anto∣nini temporibus, ab ipsis Persarum <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inibus, adusque Rhenum, et Gallias Cuneta contagiis polluebat et mortibus."</P>
<P>That a close box or other confined place, which might have been shut for ages, should contain a pestiferous vapor which might destroy the life of the man that first opened it, is not only possible, but very probable. But that this trifling quantity of nox∣ious air should be sufficient to generate a universal pestilence from the confines of Persia to Gaul, is a vulgar notion, precisely re∣sembling the modern opinion that the plague is conveyed from country to country, in bales of goods.</P>
<P>The historian adds, that the Emperor returned to Rome, and "luem secum deferre videreter," seemed to carry the plague with him. But the Romans passed only from Seleucia to Rome; whereas the plague raged over the whole earth; so that the dis∣ease must have originated in other countries, through which the Emperor did <HI>not</HI> pass, and from other causes than the noxious air of a little box. It raged in Gaul and in Scotland.</P>
<P>By attending to the phenomena of the physical world, during this period, we shall find causes fully adequate to the effect, with∣out resorting to the temple of Apollo in Seleucia. The state of the elements was deranged, and nature was every where agitated. An inundation of the Tyber at Rome laid all the low grounds, and a part of the city under water, sweeping away people, build∣ings and cattle, and desolating the fields. Famin and earth∣quakes marked th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> same period. The air became insalubrious, and myriads of caterpillars and other insects overran the earth and devoured vegetation.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="036687_0077_100AA10E98091768"/>The pestilence was violent and mortal, corresponding with these symptoms of derangement in the elements. In Rome, at one time, it is related, that the mortality extended to ten thou∣sand persons in a day. Its precise duration, I do not find to be specified by the historians; but it continued for a number of years; in the midst of which appeared a comet, about the year 169.</P>
<BIBL>See Am. Marcellinus, lib. 23, and Julius Capitolinus, in Vero. Aug. Hist. 580. Hist. of Emperors by Pedro Mexiae, p. 172. Echard's Rom. Hist. vol. 2. 315 to 322, who is more correct than Gibbon.</BIBL>
<P>Of the symptoms of this desolating plague, I find no account, except that the patients had a light fever, and a gangrene appear∣ed on the extremities of the feet.</P>
<P>It is proper here to notice a passage in Gibbon's Hist. vol. 1. chap. 3, which describes, as halcyon days, the period of the world in which this calamity occurred. The following are his words. "If a man were called upon to fix the period in the history of the world, during which the condition of the human race was <HI>most happy</HI> and <HI>prosperous,</HI> he would, without hesita∣tion, name that which elapsed from the death of Domitian to the accession of Commodus;" that is, from the year 96 to 180.</P>
<P>It is certain that, at this time, the Roman Empire was in its glory, and governed by a series of able and virtuous princes, who made the happiness of their subjects their principal object. But the coloring given to the happiness of this period, is far too brilliant. The success of armies and the extent of empire do not constitute exclusively the happiness of nations; and no histo∣rian has a title to the character of fidelity, who does not com∣prehend, in his general descriptions of the state of mankind, moral and physical, as well as political, evils.</P>
<P>During the period mentioned by Gibbon, not only Antioch, with the loss of most of its inhabitants, amounting probably to more than 100,000, but thirteen other cities were demolished by earthquakes. In the famous revolt of the Jews under Tra∣jan, historians relate that 450,000 Romans were massacred in Syria, Cyprus and other countries; and in the wars undertaken by Adrian to subdue them, it is estimated that 50 cities and 985
<PB N="74" REF="036687_0078_100AA11194038130"/>
towns were destroyed, and 580,000 men lost their lives by famin, disease and the sword. The reign of the Antonines was distinguished for multifarious and severe calamities. The de∣scription of them, by Aurelius Victor, ought to be given in his own words. Speaking of the Emperor M. Antonine, he says, "Nisi ad illa tempora natus esset, profecto quasi uno lapsu ruissent omnia status Romani. Quippe ab armis nusquam quies erat: perque omnem orientem, Illyricum, Italiam, Galliamque bella fervebant. Terrae motus non sine interitu civitatum, inunda∣tiones fluminum, lues crebrae, locustarum species agris infestae, prorsus ut prope nihil, quo summis angoribus atteri mortales so∣lent, dici seu cogitari queat, quod non illo imperante saevierit."</P>
<BIBL>Epit. of the lives of the Emperors.</BIBL>
<P>"Unless he, M. Antonine, had been born at that juncture, the affairs of the empire would have fallen into speedy ruin: for there was no respite from military operations. War raged in the east, in Illyricum, in Italy and in Gaul. Earthquakes, with the destruction of cities, inundations of rivers, frequent plagues, a species of locusts ravaging the fields; in short every calamity that can be conceived to afflict and torment men, scourged the human race, during his administration."</P>
<P>How can that be a "happy and prosperous condition of men," in which they were subject to continual wars, to massacres, to the ravages of insects, and to a series of plagues, which destroy∣ed probably one fourth of the inhabitants of the globe; and when the Roman empire was upon the brink of ruin? And how can a writer be esteemed as a historian, who substitutes the flow∣ers of rhetoric for sober truth, and sarifices fact to embellishment?</P>
<P>In the year 173 a pestilence raged in the Roman armies, which threatened them with extermination.—This appears to have been a continuation of the plague before described. It prevailed in Rome in 175 and 178.</P>

<BIBL>Ibid.</BIBL>
<P><PB N="75" REF="036687_0079_100AA113713D3D68"/>In the reign of Commodus, about the year 187, Rome was again afflicted with a severe plague, which was felt also in all parts of Italy, tho with less mortality than in the city. Hero∣dian, lib. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, gives the following account of it. "A great pes∣tilence raged throughout Italy at that time, but with most vio∣lence in the city, by reason of the great concourse of people assembled from all parts of the earth. The mortality among men and cattle was great. The Emperor, by advice of certain physicians retired to Laurentum, on account of the coolness of the place which was shaded with laurels, from which circum∣stance it derived its name. It was supposed also the effluvia from the laurels acted as an antidote against the contagion of the distemper. The people in the city also, by advice of phy∣sicians, filled their noses and ears with sweet ointments, and constantly used perfumes, for in popular opinion, they occupy the passages of the senses, with these odors, and shut out the corrupt air; or if they do not wholly exclude it, they over∣power its influence by superior force. But these things did not check the progress of the disease, and men and cattle continued to perish."</P>
<P>The deaths amounted, in Rome, to 5000 in a day, for a considerable time. A famin prevailed at the same time, and historians ascribe it to Cleander, the minister of Commodus, who had monopolized the corn, to compel people to purchase of him at an advanced price. Dion Cassius however says, the year had been unfruitful. The pestilence continued three years. Indeed we may here remark once for all, that when we read of a plague of great extent and violence in any part of the world, under the date of a particular year, we may always consider that or other pestilential diseases, as prevailing at least three years. Rarely are great plagues of less duration, but often of greater. Historians seldom mention the pestilence, except in the year of its greatest violence, but no plague, I will assert, ever yet in∣fested a particular city or country, without precursors of a very malignant type. When therefore we speak of pestilence, as prevailing in a particular year, we are to consider the epidemic as extending to a period of three, four or five years, perhaps
<PB N="76" REF="036687_0080_100AA11525E75E80"/>
to a much longer period, either in the form of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ague, a deadly petechial fever, or other fatal disease.</P>
<P>In the foregoing description of the disease under Commodus, we notice the vulgar modes of guarding against contagion, by stuffing the nose and ears with aromatics—a practice that in part subsists at this day, altho constant experience proves it to be ut∣terly ineffectual.</P>
<P>It appears from Herodian that a comet appeared at this peri∣od, or other singular heavenly phenomena. He says, "Ea tempestate stellae per diem perpetuo apparuerant, quaedamque ex iis in longum productae medio quasi aere suspensae videbantur." Comets are sometimes visible in the day time, and it is well known that many of the ancients considered them as meteors, floating in the earth's atmosphere, as we see in Aristotle, Seneca and Pliny, who have discussed and refuted those opinions. See also Sampridius who mentions the comet and unusual darkness, at this period.</P>
<P>Another circumstance mentioned by Herodian deserves no∣tice. He says, that animals at this time grew out of their usual size, assuming an extraordinary figure and disproportioned in their parts. "Preterea animalia, genus omne, minime suam naturam servantia, cum figura corporis prodigiosa, tum membris haudquaquam congruentibus edebantur." This fact the writer arranges under the head of <HI>prodigies;</HI> but numerous modern ob∣servations confirm the veracity of the historian. In many plagues, to be hereafter mentioned, myriads of unusual animals have ap∣peared, and many common animals and insects have grown to an unusual size. With this fact almost invariably attending pes∣tilence, and before the eyes of every man of science in well at∣tested accounts; a fact that demonstrates a prodigiously pesti∣lential state of the elements, modern philosophers, physicians and rulers have been tracing all the plagues of the earth to one or two little spots in Egypt and the Levant—This circumstance is hardly credible; yet is true, and indicates <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> lamentable de∣cline of sound philosophy.</P>
<P>A slight shock of an earthquake is mentioned incidentally by Herodian, after the plague. Speaking of the burning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a
<PB N="77" REF="036687_0081_100AA11922DEBE18"/>
temple in Rome, he says "there had been no storm or clouds, but a small earthquake preceded the conflagration:" and he in∣sinuates that the building might have been set on fire by a flash of lightning in the night, or by an eruption of fire in the earth∣quake.</P>
<P>In 193, Canterbury in England was severely shaken by an earthquake.</P>
<P>The plague prevailed in London in 211, and a comet ap∣peared in the same year. In 214, there was a most dreadful inundation of the river Trent in England, which spread over 20 miles of country, and destroyed many lives. Here is prob∣ably a mistake in chronology of at least two years—or rather a difference between different authorities. Eusebius, the learned Bishop of Caesaria, places the birth of Christ two years earlier, than the common or Dionysian Chronology. Many authors fol∣low one mode of computing time and many the other; and without the original authors, and a close attention to their modes of reckoning time, it is not possible to reconcile these differ∣ences. The uniform influence of comets in producing violent tempests and unusual swelling of the ocean, within a year of their appearance and after their departure, may assist in correct∣ing ancient chronology.</P>
<P>In the year 218 two comets appeared, and a severe frost of five months is related to have happened in England in 220.</P>
<P>There was a great inundation of the Tweed in 218, and a pestilence in Scotland in 222 which destroyed 100,000 lives.</P>
<P>In 235 a comet is noted, but I find no other phenomena men∣tioned about this time, except a great death of fish in 231, mul∣titudes of which were washed ashore on Britain; and an earth∣quake in Wales in 232.</P>
<P>In the reign of the Emperor Gordian, about the year 243, the earth was agitated by most violent earthquakes; and in 245 there was a prodigious inundation of the sea in Lincolnshire, England, which laid under water many thousand acres of land, which are said not yet to be recovered. A severe winter is men∣tioned in 242.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="036687_0082_100AA11B83BEBD80"/>We have now arrived to one of the most calamitous periods recorded in history—a period of mortal plagues, which com∣menced about the year 250, or 252 in the reign of the Emperor Decius and continued fifteen or twenty years, through the ad∣ministration of Gallus and Volusian, Valerian and Gallienus. This period was ushered in by a comet in 250, the winter of which in England was so severe, that the Thames was frozen for nine weeks.—An eruption of Etna is noted under the year 253, and an earthquake in Cornwall in 251.</P>
<P>The plague appears to have been most fatal in Rome at two different times, during this period; viz. in the years 252 and 262 or 3, including the year preceding and succeeding each of these periods. It reached the northern parts of Europe, and in 266, Scotland had scarcely living people enough to bury the dead.</P>
<P>It first appeared in Ethiopia, on the confines of Egypt, and spread over all the provinces of the Roman Empire, which, says Zonaras, were excessively exhausted by its destructive ravages. Zosimus, after describing the devastation occasioned by the ir∣ruption of the Scythians, says "Lues etiam pestilens in <HI>oppidis</HI> atque <HI>vicis</HI> subsecuta, quicquid erat humani generis reliquum, absumpsit." The plague in <HI>towns</HI> and <HI>villages</HI> followed the Scythians and devoured that part of the human race which the barbarians had spared.</P>
<P>Jornandes says, the pestilence "faciem totius orbis foedavit" —desolated or disfigured the face of the whole earth.—In the reign of Gallienus, 5000 citizens of Rome perished daily, in 262, or the following year, a portion of this period most distin∣guished for convulsions of the earth.</P>
<P>This latter period was marked by destructive earthquakes in Rome, Syria and other countries. In some places the earth opened and salt water issued. Trebellius Pollio says, "Fright∣ful earthquakes shook Italy, Asia and Africa. For many days, [some authors say, <HI>three</HI> days] there was an unusual or preter∣natural darkness and a hollow rumbling noise in the earth, which opened in many places. Many cities in Asia were overwhelmed,
<PB N="79" REF="036687_0083_100AA11D0B4DD450"/>
and others lost in the ocean. Pestilence <HI>followed</HI> and desolated the Roman Empire."</P>
<P>In the Universal History, it is said that this plague ravaged Capadocia and all Asia Minor, and was followed by famin, earthquakes and a great comet or meteor.</P>
<P>Orosius remarks that "Nulla fere provincia Romana, nulla civitas, nulla domus fuit, quae non illa generali pestilentia cor∣repta atque vastata." Scarcely was there a province of the Em∣pire, a city or a house, which was not attacked and desolated.</P>
<P>This passage is worthy of notice, for it will hereafter appear, that altho the plague is usually limited to cities, where powerful artificial or local causes aid the general contagion, yet in some in∣stances, the general state of the atmosphere has been so pestilen∣tial, as to produce <HI>plague</HI> on the most elevated hills and salubri∣ous places, in detached villages and houses, without the least communication with the sick and infected.</P>
<P>Gibbon chap. 10, has calculated that "a moiety of the hu∣man species" fell a prey to this frightful epidemic.</P>
<P>Cedrenus page 211 says this disease began in autumn and ended at the rising of the dog-star; or beginning of August.</P>
<P>The state of the air, during this pestilence, was uncommonly impure. The description of it by Eusebius, in a philosophical view, deserves notice. "Quando, inquit, aer iste pravis undi∣que evaporationibus turbatus, serenus reddetur? Tales enim ex terra fumigationibus, e mari venti, e fluminibus aurae, e portubus exhalationes spirant, ut veluti ros quidam tabidus e cadaveribus putridis, cunetis subjacientibus elementis inferatur."</P>
<BIBL>Magdeburgh. Cent. 3. p. 31.</BIBL>
<P>This is a remarkable instance of a state of air so highly cor∣rupt, as to form on objects a mould or coat, like a turbid dew, from dead bodies ros tabidus—a state of air which the author as∣cribes to vapor from the rivers and the earth.—The account is analogous to what is related of other pestilential periods, and the fact denotes an utter derangement in the healthful qualities of air and water.—Cedrenus compares this dew to the gore of dead persons. "Ros saniei mortuorum similis apparebat."</P>

<P><PB N="80" REF="036687_0084_100AA120652C5B80"/>In the Traitè de la Peste, I find the following description of the symptoms of this malady, from St. Cyprian—dejection of mind, exhaustion of strength, incessant involuntary evacuations, as in certain paralises, violent fever of the bowels, mouth infla∣med, stomach swelled, eyes sparkling. The disease destroyed the feet, the hands, the sight, the hearing and organs of gen∣eration.</P>
<P>Aurelius Victor says of this plague "Simulque Romam pes∣tilentia grassabatur, quae saepe curis gravioribus atque animi des∣peratione oritur." The plague spread, which often arises from the more distressing cares and despair. This describes the mise∣rable state of mankind, at that period; but anxiety and despair do not produce the plague, except during the prevalence of a pesti∣lential state of air. There must be a strong predisposition in the body, or an imbecillity in the powers of animal life previously induced; or the utmost pressure of grief will never occasion a plague. But at the time when general causes have impaired the vigor of the animal principles, slight causes will often induce fever and destroy life. The practical inferences from this fact are extremely important to mankind.</P>
<P>The articles in this account of pestilence which deserve par∣ticular notice, are the introduction of the period by a comet and an eruption of Etna—the agitations of the earth by subterranean fire—the preternatural darkness of three days, a phenomenon not unusual at such times and easily accounted for, on the supposition of the extrication of a great quantity of subterranean vapor— the pestiferous state of air which covered objects with mould and corruption—and which generated plague in every village and al∣most every house.</P>

<P>Near the close of this period, about the year 272, there was an eruption of Vesuvius. At the same time, a severe famin raged in England. Five or six years later, a severe famin prevailed over the world. "Fames ingens per totum orbem grassata est."</P>

<P><PB N="81" REF="036687_0085_100AA12299E0C180"/>It is proper here to notice an inaccuracy of the celebrated New∣ton, in his Dissertations on the prophecies, on the 6th chapter of Revelations, in which he says, "In the reign of Probus also there was a great famin throughout the world—an usual <HI>conse∣quence</HI> of famin is pestilence.—This pestilence according to Zo∣noras, arising from Ethiopia, while Gallus and Volusian were Emperors, pervaded all the Roman provinces for fifteen years." But Probus began to reign in the year 276, whereas the pesti∣lence broke out in Ethiopia under Decius or Gallus and Volu∣sian, about A. D. 252 according to Zonoras, but according to other authors, two or three years earlier. Therefore the pesti∣lence under Gallus, could not be a <HI>consequence</HI> of a famin under Probus, which was 25 years later than the plague ascribed to it. These remarks are necessary to correct that passage of Newton, and they are useful in correcting the common notion, that the plague is usually occasioned by famin. The idea is probably un∣philosophical; but is certainly contrary to fact. Famin often <HI>goes before</HI> the plague, and as often <HI>follows</HI> it. But some of the most disastrous periods of the plague, have originated during the <HI>greatest abundance</HI> of provisions.—Such was the fact in England, in 448, and in 1347, as will be hereafter related. The great er∣ror of historians and physicians has been, that observing famin and pestilence often cotemporary, and the cause of the plague not being obvious to the senses, they have taken famin to be the cause. Whereas it will appear on careful investigation, that fam∣in is an <HI>effect</HI> of the same cause which produces the plague among men. The dearth of provisions, during this formidable epidemic, is the effect of a <HI>pestilence in vegetation;</HI> that is, a failure in the principles of vegetable life, which proceeds from the same de∣rangement of the seasons, or defect in the properties of air and water, which causes the plague among men.—Famin often aug∣ments pestilence, and modifies the symptoms of the disease; but in a healthy state of the elements of life, air and water, famin will not produce the plague. This may be demonstrated by mul∣tiplied instances of seamen, starving on the ocean, who often per∣ish by hunger, without disease, or if they had diseases in conse∣quence
<PB N="82" REF="036687_0086_100AA124EDD0F548"/>
of mere hunger, nothing like the plague has ever been of the number.</P>
<P>I cannot help noticing also the observations of Mr. Gibbon on the calamities of this period. He says, "Our habits of thinking so fondly connect the order of the universe with the fate of man, that this gloomy period of history has been <HI>decora∣ted</HI> with inundations, earthquakes, uncommon meteors, preter∣natural darkness, and a crowd of prodigies <HI>fictitious</HI> or <HI>exagge∣rated.</HI>"</P>
<BIBL>See vol. 1. ch. 10.</BIBL>
<P>If the original writers who have related the facts above men∣tioned, had been as fond of <HI>decorations,</HI> as this author, we might well have distrusted their accounts of unusual occurrences. Had this <HI>elegant</HI> writer taken due pains to inform himself of the truth, before he had indulged such reflections on the most cred∣ible historians, he would have found similar phenomena to have attended the same calamity, pestilence, in every age from that period to the present, and many of them if not all, during his own life, if not within his own observation.</P>
<P>He goes on to observe that "famin is almost always followed by epidemical diseases." This point will be afterwards considered.</P>
<P>He says also that the plague at this period "raged from 250 to 265, <HI>without interruption,</HI> in every province, <HI>every city</HI> and almost <HI>every family</HI> of the Roman Empire."</P>
<P>The words <HI>without interruption,</HI> were probably inserted for the sake of <HI>decoration.</HI> They are not authorized by the original writers; and cannot possibly be true, for an uninterrupted plague in a city or country, would soon leave it without an inhabitant. The truth is, it seldom raged, more than six or eight months, in the same place, at one time. It seized this town, one year, and that, the next, as we observe in modern times, through the whole period.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The words of Zonoras per quindecem continuos annos, are to be understood as above explained.</NOTE></P>

<P>In 358 happened a most tremendous shock of an earthquake, which buried in ruins the greatest part of Nicomedia. The shock happened soon after day-break in the morning, 11th Kal. Sept. and was preceded by a collection of vapor or clouds, that covered the city with impenetrable darkness, so that the eye could not discern the nearest objects. This was soon succeeded by flashes of lightning and most violent winds and tornadoes, which carried buildings to the adjacent hills. The scene was closed by a shock of the earth which demolished a large portion of the city.</P>
<P>Authors relate that this earthquake levelled 150 cities.</P>
<P>Short indeed was the respite which Asia Minor enjoyed. In 362, the remains of Nicomedia were destroyed, part of Nice was overturned, Jerusalem was shaken and other parts of the world did not escape. This was the year also in which Julian attempted to rebuild Jerusalem, when fire bursting from the earth, destroyed the works and rendered the place inaccessible. This event has been ascribed to a preternatural influence; but is a common phenomenon in Italy, Asia Minor, and in all countries subject to earthquakes; and as it happened when the neighboring countries were laid waste by the explosion of subter∣ranean fire, there is no necessity for resorting to supernatural causes, to account for the phenomenon.</P>
<P>During these agitations of the earth, the sea receding left its bed, a highway for passengers. Inundations succeeded, and drouth, famin and pestilence walked in the train of public ca∣lamities.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="036687_0089_100AA12BBA3492E0"/>In the following years, the earthquakes were repeated and Baronius asserts that the whole world was shaken; the shores of the sea were in some places changed; some places sunk, and in others the waters rose and carried vessels over the tops of houses. Authors place the destruction of Nice in 367, and of other cities in 368 or 372.</P>
<P>The destruction of Nicomedia was preceded by a severe drouth—a common event, that a violent explosion of fire from the bowels of the earth, is preceded, some weeks or months, by a total exhaustion of water by evaporation.</P>
<P>In the midst of these convulsions, appeared a comet in 363 or 4, and a meteor or globe of fire in 363.</P>

Unfortu∣nately historians have often neglected to arrange these phenomena in due order, throwing them into a general description.</P>
<P>The same period was marked by deluges of rain, and from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of narration, it appears that the rains <HI>preceded</HI> the hard win∣ter of the year 400. The rivers were so sorelled as to prevent the imperial generals from passing into the east to attack Sardis.— Severe earthquakes occurred in the same year.</P>
<P>About the year 407 or 8, near the close of the reign of Arca∣dius, a celestial phenomenon of a singular species presented itself to the view of an astonished world. It was called a comet, but did not resemble one of the ordinary figure. It resembled a cone or pillar, but had not the appearance of a star, so much as of the flame of a lamp. Its motion was not regular—it began to move from the point of the heavens where the sun rises at the equinox∣es, and passing the tail of Ursa, proceeded to the west.</P>
<P>It measured the heavens—its vertex, at some times, extended to a great length; at others, was contracted into the figure of a cone. After being visible for four months, it disappeared. This is the description of it, nearly in the words of Nicephorus. Me∣teors were observed at the same period.</P>
<P>Accompanying an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> following these phenomena, were some of the most distressing calamities. Violent earthquakes levelled cit∣ies—inundations of rivers and the sea, followed by intolerable cold storms of hail, and a drouth that blasted vegetation, by which means multitudes of people perished. Pestilence raged in every quarter, and famin so severe, that the populace deman∣ded
<PB N="88" REF="036687_0092_100AA13220A87170"/>
that human flesh should be sold in market. Palestine was de∣voured by locusts.</P>
<P>Nicephorus has employed a chapter to describe the physical evils, and the miseries of man, in this singular period. He de∣clares that almost all Europe perished.—"pasa de ōleto ē Eurōpē." and no small part of Asia and Africa.</P>

<P>In 418 appeared a comet; in 419 several cities of Asia were overturned by an earthquake, and in 420 there was an eruption of Etna. There was also an inundation of the sea in Hampshire, in England, in 419. Famin and pestilence prevailed also in this period.—A great storm of hail is mentioned under the year 418, and deep snow.</P>
<P>The next period of general pestilence commenced in the reign of Theodosius the younger, about the year 445—or a year or two earlier. A comet in 442, ushered in a severe winter, in 443, the snow fell to such a depth and continued so long in Illyri∣cum, that multitudes of men, women and children perished. The year preceding, the Huns had ravaged the country and destroyed the provisions, which added to the public calamities. An irrup∣tion of the Sea in North and South Wales, 441, preceded the first comet, a second comet appeared in 444. In 445, severe famin and plague distressed Constantinople, and pestilence appear∣ed in all parts of the world. In 446, Sept. 17, occured a tre∣mendous earthquake, which demolished the greatest part of the walls of Constantinople, with fifty seven towers. The shocks continued unremittingly for six months, and extended to a great part of the globe. Many cities were overthrown, the earth, in some places, was thrown into large hills; in others, it opened and swallowed up whole towns. Islands disappeared and were lost in the ocean: the sea receding, left ships on dry land, springs of water were dried up and new fountains appeared, and in this violent concussion of the elements perished innumerable multi∣tudes of fish.</P>
<P>The pestilence attending, and which rarely fails to attend such agitations of the earth, was universal and of several years dura∣tion. In this period, the plague in England was correspond∣ent

to the terrible operations of subterranean fire. In 448 or 9, it carried off incredible numbers of people, so that the living could scarcely bury the dead.—And it must not be omitted that the plague was preceded by the greatest abundance of provisions. This was in the reign of Vortigern, and in time of peace.</P>

<P>An important fact here occurs. In 446, the Picts and Scots had overrun and desolated England, so as to occasion a dearth of provisions. But this famin produced no pestilential disease. It is particularly noticed by the historian, that the plague did not occur, till a year of great plenty had intervened. This is one strong proof among others, that famin is not the <HI>cause</HI> of plague; but often accompanies, and sometimes increases the disease. It often happens that, during extraordinary agitations of the earth, the elements of vegetable life appear to be defective. The same cause which affects human health, seems to prevent the growth or vitiate the pabulum of vegetables.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">General descriptions are seldom correct. I have already taken notice of the mistakes committed by Newton and Gibbon, whose general de∣scriptions lead, in the instances mentioned, to false conclusions. A similar mistake occurs in Henry's excellent History of Britain, vol. 1. ch. 1. concerning the calamities of the Britons, in the period under consideration The author says, "the neglect of agriculture naturally produced a famin, which was followed by a pestilence."—These facts are not correctly stated. The incursions of the Picts and Scots had occasioned the neglect of culture and a famin; but this famin was fol∣lowed by plentiful crops, which were succeeded by pestilence.</NOTE></P>
<P>The close of this period was peculiarly distressing in Italy, Phrygia, Cappadocia and Galatia, where the famin compelled parents to devour their own children. The pestilence made great havoc, at the same time, and no remedy or alleviation could be found. The body was universally inflamed and cover∣ed with tumors. The disease destroyed the eyes. A cough suc∣ceeded the eruption, and ended life on the third day.</P>

<P>It must be remarked here that Functius has placed this comet and the beginning of Marcian's reign, in 454. Such differ∣ences in chronology cannot fail to embarrass an inquiry like the present, the results of which depend much on correctness of dates.</P>
<P>Nicephorus and Evagrius give a particular account of an earthquake which laid great part of Antioch in ruins in the sec∣ond year of the Emperor Leo, which was A. D. 458. A comet is noted under the preceding year. But they say further, that this event took place 347 complete years after the destruc∣tion of the city in the reign of Trajan, which was in 117. Now 347 years added to this number, give 464, for the year of the last catastrophe.</P>

<P>Baronius places the earthquake at Constantinople in 477, but others place it in 480, which is most probably correct.

ruin by an earthquake. Some authors relate that 300,000 per∣sons perished in this catastrophe, and among them Euphrasius, the bishop.—This event happened on the 29th of May, about 12 o'clock. A conflagration followed and consumed what was left of the city. In the same shocks, Dyrrachium, now Durazzo, the Epidaurus of high antiquity, Corinth and other cities were greatly injured.</P>
<BIBL>Baronius vol. 7. 109. 110. 111. Niceph. lib. 7. 3. Evag. lib. 4. Zonoras Tom. 3.</BIBL>
<P>A severe winter happened the same year.</P>
<P>In 528 Antioch was again shaken and suffered considerable injury. An inundation of the Humber in England is noted about this time.</P>
<P>In 531 appeared the resplendent comet, whose revolution is fixed at 575 years, supposed to be the same which was visible in the year before Christ 44, after the death of Julius Cesar. This was the fifth year of the reign of Justinian. Famin and a slight plague prevailed in Wales.</P>
<P>At this period Gibbon commences his lively, but unphilosoph∣ical description of the formidable and destructive calamities, which afflicted the whole earth in the 6th century. See his his∣tory, vol. 4. ch. 43.</P>
<P>Not long after the approach of the comet in 531, the sun as∣sumed a pale color, and shone with a feeble light. In a transla∣tion of Cedrenus, this phenomenon is thus described. "Toto anno eo, sol lunae instar, sine radiis, lucem tristem praebuit, ple∣rumque defectum patienti similis." During the whole year, the sun gave a gloomy light, like the moon, and appeared as if eclip∣sed.</P>
<BIBL>Byzantine Hist. 3. 293. Procop. de bell. Vandal. lib. 4.</BIBL>
<P>It is remarkable that tradition has preserved a faint account of a similar phenomenon, during the approach of the same comet, at the time of the Ogygean inundation, before Christ 1767. It is said, that the planet Venus changed her color, size and figure. An account is preserved in tradition, of a phenomenon of the same nature, during the approach of the same star, in a subse∣quent revolution. Gibbon in the chapter above cited.—Pliny, as I have already remarked, mentions a similar phenomenon,
<PB N="93" REF="036687_0097_100AA13BED99FB10"/>
about the time the same comet appeared, soon after the death of Julius Cesar.</P>
<P>The appearance, in the period under consideration, is a well authenticated fact, and witnesses a singular change in the prop∣erties, and reflecting powers of the atmosphere, or denotes an essential alteration in the face of the sun, which is improbable. In either case, it seemed a prelude to the most dreadful calami∣ties, famin, earthquakes, and pestilence. I am not without sus∣picions that Europe might have been overspread with a vapor like that in 1783, during the eruption of Heckla.</P>
<P>In 534 is recorded one of the most distressing famins, that ever afflicted the earth; it continued many years, and destroyed mul∣titudes of the human race. Pompeiopolis was this year over∣whelmed in ruin by an earthquake, and great numbers of its inhabitants perished.</P>
<BIBL>Paul. Diac. lib. 16.</BIBL>
<P>About this period, Vesuvius began to utter hollow rumbling noises, the precursors of an eruption.</P>
<BIBL>Baron. vol. 7. 218. Procop. de Bell. Goth. Magdeb. Cent. 6. p. 793.</BIBL>
<P>Excepting a slight plague in Wales—no pestilence is mention∣ed by the authors I have consulted, until the year 542. But the famin, in great severity, had raged eight or nine years be∣fore —a proof that something more than famin is necessary to generate the plague.</P>
<P>In 539 appeared another comet, and the famin now raged with double horror. The country of Italy had been ravaged, the year before by the Goths and Burgundians, and the lands left untilled. This might have contributed towards the dearth which followed. It is recorded that many persons fed on hu∣man flesh, some districts of Italy were deserted, 50,000 people perished in Picenum, and greater numbers in other districts. The bodies of the famished people became thin and pale; the skin was hardened and dry like leather, and clave to the bones; the flesh assumed a dark appearance like charcoal, the counte∣nance was senseless and stern, the bile redundant.</P>
<BIBL>Procop. de Bell. Goth. lib. 1.</BIBL>
<P>Among these frightful effects of hunger, no plague yet ap∣pears
<PB N="94" REF="036687_0098_100AA13D9F0B0968"/>
—a circumstance that the philosopher should not pass unno∣ticed.</P>
<P>The account which Baronius gives of this famin, is, perhaps more philosophical and deserves notice. He says, the crops failed, corn ripened prematurely, and was thin; in some places, it was not harvested, and that which was gathered, was defi∣cient in nourishment. Those who subsisted upon it became pale, and were afflicted with bile. The body lost its heat and vigor, the skin was dried, the countenance stupid, distorted and ghast∣ly, the liver turned black. Many perished by hunger; many betook themselves to the fields to feed on vegetables, and being too feeble to pull them, lay down and gnawed them off with their teeth.</P>
<BIBL>Baronius, lib. 7. 326.</BIBL>
<P>This is the most probable account of the famin. Repeated instances are on record, which evidently mark a pestilential state of the elements, as fatal to vegetable, as to animal life. In many periods of the world, there has been a universal defect in the powers of vegetation. This phenomenon in the vegetable kingdom is cotemporary, or nearly so, with pestilence among men; and superficial observers have ascribed the plague to a prior or cotemporary famin. But an accurate survey of facts, will probably convince any candid enquirer after truth, of the fallacy of this opinion. It will be made apparent that famin and pesti∣lence are equally the <HI>effects</HI> of some general cause; a temporary derangement of the regular operations of nature.</P>
<P>In the present instance, the famin could not be exclusively and immediately the cause of the formidable plague that afterwards assailed mankind, for it was most severe in 539, and the next year the crops were good. But the plague did not break out till 542, at least I can find no account of any pestilence, during the famin.</P>
<P>An eruption of Vesuvius is noted under the year 532, the year after the appearance of the great comet.—It is probable that the paleness of the sun was owing to a vapor from some volcanic eruption, as in 1783; and it is remarkable that both of these periods alike produced famin from defective vegetation.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="036687_0099_100AA14029DC1C38"/>During the remaining p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt of this century, a series of most calamitous events afflicted the earth.

<P>In the year 543, the whole earth was shaken by earthquakes.

<P>In 550 an earthquake convulsed Syria and Palestine; and Greece in 551.

<P>In 560 an earthquake destroyed Berytus and injured Cos, Tripoli, and Balbus. An excessive drouth in 562, and a plague began which spread over the whole world. There was a dark day in the same year.</P>
<P>The year 565 was distinguished for a calamitous plague, in France, Germany and Italy, which Baronius calls "vehemens pestis inguinaria."</P>
<BIBL>Vol. 7. 547.</BIBL>
<P>In 580 Antioch was again laid in ruins by an earthquake, and a shock was felt in Scotland. The plague again prevailed, from that year to 583, in Gaul and Germany and other coun∣tries. In 587 it ravaged Italy. Earthquakes attended this pe∣riod.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="036687_0100_100AA2095B36A4F0"/>In 590 appeared a comet; an inundation, from deluges of rain, overspread Rome, covering the walls of the city, and lodging innumerable serpents on the plains. In the next summer, happened the severest drouth ever known; it lasted from Janu∣ary to September; and the most deadly plague ravaged all Italy. In this pestilence, died Pope Pelagius.</P>
<P>This is a general sketch of the phenomena recorded of the period under consideration.</P>
<P>Of the universal and destructive plagues which dispeopled the world in the reign of Justinian I. and the succeeding age we have accurate accounts by cotemporary historians: From two of which, Procopius and Evagrius, I shall transcribe the particulars.</P>
<P>Procopius relates, "That this pestilence, which almost de∣stroyed the human race, and for which no cause could be assign∣ed but the will of God, did not rage in one part of the world only, nor in one season of the year. It ravaged the whole world, seizing all descriptions of people, without regard to dif∣ferent constitutions, habits or ages; and without regard to their places of residence, their modes of subsistence or their different pursuits. Some were seized in winter, some in summer; others in other seasons of the year.</P>
<P>It first appeared in Pelusium in Egypt and thence spread west∣ward to Alexandria and all parts of Egypt; eastward towards Palestine, and extended to all parts of the world, laying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aste islands, caves, mountains, and all places where men dwelt. If it passed by a particular country at first, or <HI>slightly affected it,</HI> it soon returned upon it with the same desolating rage which other places had experienced.—It began in maritime towns and spread to the interior country. It seized Constantinople in the spring of 543.</P>
<P>Most persons were seized suddenly without any premonition, nor was there any change of color or sense of heat; for until evening the fever was so slight that the patient was not ill, nor did the physician, from the pulse, apprehend danger. But in some cases, the same day; in others, the next; in others, at a later period, a bubo arose, either in the groin, the arm <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>its, or
<PB N="97" REF="036687_0101_100A89A8B15FB988"/>
near the ear, or in some other part. All patients alike had these symptoms.</P>
<P>Some were seized with drowsiness and slumbering; others with furious distraction. The slumberers forgot all things—some would eat if desired; others were neglected and starved.</P>
<P>Neither physician nor attendant caught the distemper by con∣tact of the sick or dead; and many, encouraged by their won∣derful escape, applied themselves with assiduity to the care of the sick and the burial of the deceased.</P>
<P>Many were seized, they knew not from what cause, and sud∣denly died. Some who were given over by physicians unexpect∣edly recovered; others who appeared to be in no danger speed∣ily expired. Many died for want of relief; others recovered without assistance. No cause of the disease could be devised by human reason—no means of prevention or cure. To some, bathing was beneficial; to others, injurious. Many leaped into water and the sea—In many the bubo, without sleep or delivium, turned into a gangrene, and these died with excruciating torture.</P>
<P>The physicians opened the bodies of some, and found within the sores huge carbuncles. Those whose bodies were spotted with black pimples, of the size of a lentil, lived not a day. Those who had running sores escaped, and these were the most certain signs of recovery. Some had their thighs withered; others lost the use of their tongues.</P>
<P>To women with child, the disease was certain death.</P>
<P>This disease in Constantinople lasted four months, raging three months with extreme mortality. In the beginning, few died more than usual; but the disease gradually increased, till it swept off 10,000 persons in a day."</P>
<P>Procopius calls it arrogance to pretend to assign the natural causes of this pestilence, declaring them to be undiscoverable.</P>
<BIBL>Persic. lib. 2. ca. 22.</BIBL>
<P>Authors mention the early effects of this disease on the brain; the patients, on the first attack, saw phantoms of evil spirits, which made them imagine themselves smitten by some person.</P>
<P>Evagrius, who felt the effects of the same disease himself and
<PB N="98" REF="036687_0102_100A89AC50872BB0"/>
lost many of his family by it, has enumerated so many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ngular circumstances, that I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> offer the reader a translation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f his account. When I say, <HI>the same disease,</HI> I refer however to a subsequent epidemic. Procopius, as an eye witness, described the pestilence of 543 in Constantinople. It did not continue incessantly to rage in every place, for this would have soon left the earth without an inhabitant; but after an interval of a few years, it returned and revisited the same places. The plague described by Evagrius was many years subsequent to that men∣tioned by Procopius. He wrote about the year 594. His de∣scriptions however are general.</P>
<BIBL>See Hist. Eccles. lib. 4. ca. 29.</BIBL>
<P>"I will now describe the plague, which has prevailed in these times, and already raged fifty-two years, a thing never before known, and has already depopulated the world. Two years after the taking of Antioch by the Persians,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Under Cho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roes A. D. 540</NOTE> a pestilential dis∣ease began to prevail, in some respects resembling that which Thucydides has described, in other respects different. It had its origin in Ethiopia, according to common report, and spread over the whole world, falling on different places by turns, and sparing none of the human race.</P>
<P>Some cities were so severely assailed by this disease, that they were left without an inhabitant. Some districts however were more slightly affected. The pestilence did not always begin its attacks at the same season of the year, nor cease to rage, in all places in the same manner. In some places it broke out in the midst of winter; in others, in the spring; in some, it began in summer; in others, in autumn; and in some cities, it attacked certain parts of the town, and left others untouched.</P>
<P>Very often we might observe, particular families all perished, in a city where the disease did not prevail, as an epidemic. In some places, one or two families only perished, while the rest of the city escaped. But we observed particularly that the families which escaped, the first year, experienced the same calamity in the year succeeding.</P>
<P>But what above all appeared singular and surprising was, that
<PB N="99" REF="036687_0103_100AA141E5F9BDA0"/>
the inhabitants of infected places, removing their residence to places, where the disease had not appeared, or did not prevail, were the only persons who fell victims to the plague, in the cities which were not infected. And these effects were particularly observable, both in cities and in other places, in the cycles of the <HI>Indictions.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>cycle of indiction</HI> was a period of 15 years, at the end of which the Romans paid a certain tax to the Emperors.</NOTE> Especially in the second year of each indiction, was the plague extremely mortal. Of this I am myself a wit∣ness, for it may not be improper, when the occasion seems to require it, to interweave into this history what concerns myself. At the commencement of this calamity, I was seized with the <HI>inguinal plague;</HI> and in the diseases, which have at different times prevailed, I have lost many of my children, my wife and great numbers of my kindred, of my servants and laborers: the cycles of indiction parcelling out my calamities among themselves.</P>
<P>At the time of writing this account, the disease had already invaded Antioch the fourth time; the fourth cycle of indiction had passed, after the first invasion of this disease, when I lost a daughter, and her son.</P>
<P>This disease was a compound of various others. For in some persons, seizing the head, it rendered the eyes sanguineous and the face tumid: Then falling upon the throat, soon put an end to life in all that were thus seized. Some were afflicted by discharges from the bowels. In others an abscess formed in the groin, a raging fever followed, and the second or third day, the patient died, with his body and his mind apparently sound, as tho they had not felt disease. Some were seized with delir∣ium and expired. Carbuncles also arising on the body extin∣guished the lives of many. Others recovered once and again, and afterwards died of the same disease.</P>
<P>The modes of contracting the disease were various and all cal∣culation was baffled. Some perished by once entering infected houses, or remaining in them—some by only touching the sick. Some contracted the disease in open market. Others, who fled from the infected places, remained safe, while they commu∣nicated
<PB N="100" REF="036687_0104_100AA143E4EE6C08"/>
the disease to others who died. Many who remained with the sick, and freely handled them as well as dead bodies, wholly escaped the disease. Others who had lost their children and dependents, and in despair sought death, by attempting to throw themselves in the way of infection and assiduously attend∣ing the sick, found all their efforts in vain; they could not con∣tract the disease.</P>
<P>The distemper has already prevailed fifty-two years, to this time, exceeding all preceding plagues: For Philostratus was surprised that, in his time, that calamity had prevailed for fif∣teen years. What will happen hereafter is uncertain, since all things are at the disposal of God who understands the causes of things and the events."</P>
<P>Thus far Evagrius. See also Nicephorus lib. 17. ca. 18.</P>
<P>The reader is desired to attend particularly to the foregoing relation of facts, as some important conclusions will, in the se∣quel, be drawn from them, and other authorities hereafter to be cited.</P>
<P>It will be remarked that altho authors speak of this pestilen∣tial period, as of fifty-two years duration, as Evagrius and Gib∣bon have done, yet this is not accurate. Evagrius, from whom this number is copied, says, the pestilence had then prevailed fifty-two years; but it was still raging, and what was to happen afterwards, he could not determin.</P>
<P>The truth is, plagues were uncommonly frequent during this period; but the disease did not prevail without intervals. On the contrary, the years remarkable for mortality are specified by historians, viz. 542 and 3, 547, 558, 562 to 565, 582 and 3, 587, and finally one of the most destructive periods of all was 590 and the few following years. Altho this was a long and severe period of calamity, yet from the best accounts I can ob∣tain, I see no reason to believe the mortality, in any given term of five or ten years, from 542 to 600, to have been greater, than in some other periods of the same duration. More people probably died in a short space of time, in the reign of the An∣tonines —in that of Gallus and Volusian—and far more, in the dreadful plague of 1346 to 50.—It is even probable that in the
<PB N="101" REF="036687_0105_100AA14665584D80"/>
last 50 years of the 16th century, the earth sustained as great a loss of inhabitants as in the same space of time in the 6th centu∣ry. General descriptions are rarely correct, and Mr. Gibbon's unphilosophical, tho eloquent <HI>flourishing</HI> description of the mise∣ries of the human race, in Justinian's reign is calculated to mis∣lead a careless reader.</P>
<P>Evagrius indeed says, this plague exceeded all preceding ones. This is natural; Thucydides said the same of the disease in his time. But we are more able to form a correct comparison between the different epidemics that have prevailed, than the co∣temporaries with any particular one.</P>
<P>Agathius relates that in the pestilence at Constantinople in 558, many died suddenly as with an apoplexy. The most ro∣bust constitutions survived only to the 5th day. The critical period in the Athenian plague was the 7th or 9th. Thucydides makes no mention of the stupor at the beginning of the distem∣per, nor of the volutatio humi, whirling of the earth, or dizzi∣ness, nor of buboes, nor of the effects of the disease on preg∣nant women.</P>
<BIBL>Freind's Hist. of Medicine 416 et seq. Baron. vol. 7. 357, 358.</BIBL>
<P>Warnefred relates of this pestilence, in Liguria, where it was particularly mortal, that there appeared suddenly certain marks "quaedam signacula," upon the doors of houses, on garments, and utensils, which could not be washed out but grew brighter by washing. The next year, appeared in men's groins, or other delicate parts of the body, tumors like nuts or dates, which were soon followed by intolerable fever, which extinguished life in three days. If the patient survived the third day, he had hopes of recovery.</P>
<P>I should have ranked this account among the fictions of a dis∣turbed imagination, had not more recent and well attested facts given me reason to credit it.</P>
<P>The description of the terrible effects of this disease in Italy by the same author, is melancholy and painful to the reader.</P>
<P>The dysentery which raged in France in 548 was accompanied with signs of the plague, and was nearly equal to it in mortality. The plague raged this year at Munster, in Ireland.</P>

<P><PB N="102" REF="036687_0106_100AA14870537D90"/>The desolating plague of 590 was mortal almost beyond ex∣ample, and preceded or attended with extraordinary phenomena. In 588 Antioch was overwhelmed by a violent earthquake, and 60,000 people buried in its ruins. The inundation of the Tyber exceeded all that had been known, as did the drouth of the suc∣ceeding summer. The intervening winter was equally remarka∣ble for its severity—"qualem vix aliquis prius recolebat fuisse," says Warnefred; such as the oldest persons could scarcely recol∣lect. Violent tempests overturned buildings. About the same time, swarms of locusts appeared in Trente and devoured every species of vegetable. In some parts of Italy, they continued their ravages for five years. Cedrenus adds, that fish died, and this mortality he ascribes to the freezing of the waters, page 332. —Modern observations prove the fallacy of the reason here as∣signed; fish do not die beneath a cover of ice; but the death of fish by means of earthquakes, and of sickness, is a common event.</P>

<P>Africa was almost depopulated by this plague. So sudden and rapid was the disease in its action, that during a procession in Rome, instituted by St. Gregory, on account of that calamity, no less than eighty persons fell dead in the street.</P>
<P>Authors relate that the serpents, washed from the mountains by the flood, and lodged on the earth, putrefied, and contrib∣uted to the subsequent plague.</P>
<P>Gregory of Tours relates, that the plague, at that time, was introduced into Gaul by a vessel and her cargo, but it did not spread regularly from house to house, but started up in distant and detached places, like fire in a field of stubble. Marseilles and Lyons were made waste by its mortality. It was most fatal to the poor.</P>

581, in the collection of German writers by Pistorius, page 683. Men died suddenly, at play, at table, and in conversa∣tion. Sometimes they fell dead in the act of sneezing, "dum sternutabant," so that when one heard another sneeze, he turn∣ed to him and exclaimed, "God help you"—which was the origin of a custom still observed in some countries.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This custom was of higher antiquity.</NOTE> Some∣times persons expired in the act of nodding or gaping; which gave rise to the practice of making the sign of the cross, on such occasions—a custom not yet obliterated.</P>
<P>In 599, the plague in the east, in Africa and Rome, was dreadful. The death of the Emperor Mauritius, in 602, was preceded by the appearance of a comet. A severe winter, about this time, killed the vines, and grain suffered by frost and blight. The army of barbarians, marching to besiege Constantinople, was so harrassed and weakened by the plague, as to be compelled to abandon the enterprize. Cayanus their commander lost seven sons.</P>

<P>A plague in Syria raged in 732, but no particulars are men∣tioned. The following year, the heavens appeared all in a flame.</P>
<BIBL>Magd Cent. 8. ca. 13.</BIBL>
<P>The next pestilential period is remarkable for the violence of the operations of nature.</P>
<P>In 740 a tremendous earthquake, or rather a continuation of successive shocks for twelve months, announced the commence∣ment of a series of calamities. It began on the 7th Kal. No∣vember, and demolished buildings, statues and walls in Con∣stantinople, with a multitude of cities in Thrace, Nicomedia and Bythinia. Sigibert places these events in 741.</P>
<P>In 742, or as others say in 743, a most severe drouth was followed by most terrible earthquakes. The next year appeared a comet and the year following, another; and the third year af∣ter the drouth, which was either in 745 or 6, according to dif∣ferent authors, a remarkable thick darkness covered the earth from August to October. At this time the plague was raging at Calabria in Naples, and it continued to spread with dreadful havock for several succeeding years, in the countries of the east. So violent was it in Constantinople in 746, that the living could not bury the dead; but the bodies were carried in cart-loads and thrown into empty cisterns, and any place that would conceal them from the sight. Fatal indeed was the disease, when "eo∣dem die aliquis mortuum efferebat, et ipse mortuus afferebatur"— the man who buried a corpse, was sometimes carried, the same day, to his grave.</P>
<P>In the order of the events here related authors agree. Ce∣drenus mentions an extraordinary light or flame in the sky in 742, and a similar flame in the north, the year following. He mentions at the same time a famin in Constantinople; and limits the darkness to five days, from the 10th to 15th of August.</P>

<P>Such was the waste of people in Constantinople by the pre∣ceding plagues, that the emperor Constantine repaired the loss by introducing the inhabitants of neighboring countries.</P>
<P>In 760 or 61, for this difference occurs among good author∣ities, appeared a comet, or light, called <HI>dokites,</HI> by the Greeks, from its resemblance to a beam; which was visible 10 days in the east and 21 in the west.—In 762 appeared two other comets and the following winter was the most severe probably on record. It began about the first of October, and lasted till February. The Euxine sea was frozen to the distance of one hundred miles from the shore, and the snow and ice accumulated to the depth of thirty cubits. In this frost, the animal and vegetable king∣doms suffered great injury. On the breaking up of winter, the ice from the Danube and the Euxine was forced in huge masses, into the Bosphorus, and against the walls of Constantinople, which were greatly damaged.</P>
<P>In March, falling stars, or meteors were very frequent, and the succeeding summers were remarkable for most terrible drouth, in which all springs were exhausted. Myriads of venemous flies appeared, and a desolating mortality concluded this series of disordered seasons.</P>
<BIBL>Paul. Diac. lib. 22. Baron. vol. 9. 271. Magd. Cent. 8. ca. 13. Short on Air, vol. 1. 82.</BIBL>
<P>Short mentions a fatal pestilence in Wales in 762.</P>
<P>On the authority of Short, I have mentioned a <HI>mortality</HI> af∣ter the severe and unusual seasons of 763 and 4; but the original writers I have consulted do not mention it; tho the fact may be found in others which I have not seen. It is altogether probable that such extraordinary seasons should occasion great sickness; but it is equally probable that if any destructive and general plague had followed them, the writers I have consulted would have mentioned it.</P>
<P>I am led to notice this circumstance, by the consideration that
<PB N="109" REF="036687_0113_100AA1570C8A4FD8"/>
no earthquake is recorded during this period. This circum∣stance is of no small consequence in this inquiry; and is a con∣firming proof of the justness of my suspicions, that pestilence has an intimate connection with subterranean heat or the action of fire. It appears that the plague, for the most part, is violent and extensive, in proportion to the action of the fire that exists in and about the globe. The preceding pestilential period, be∣ginning in 740, is a striking instance of the truth of this remark.</P>
<P>A great mortality happened in 766. In 767 a severe drouth exhausted all springs and rivers and the year following was dis∣tinguished by a comet. Pestilence prevailed in England in 771, and in Chichester died 34,000 people.</P>

<P>In the reign of Charlemagne, about the beginning of the ninth century, commenced a period of great mortality. A comet in 799, was followed by an excessively cold winter in 800.

for three months, convulsed by earthquakes. In the same year commenced a famin, and a plague of three years duration, which desolated the whole earth. Cotemporary authors affirm that more than half the human race perished. The living were fatigued with burying the dead—"ut sepelientium taedio, vivi ad huc spiritum trahentes, obruerenter cum mortuis." Such was the weariness of those that buried the corpses, that the living before their breath had left their bodies, were tumbled into the graves with the dead.</P>
<P>At the close of this horrible destruction, Vesuvius discharged prodigious quantities of lava which laid waste the neighboring country.</P>
<P>In 1009 was seen a comet in May. The beginning of the year the earth was deluged with rain, and a plague among the Saxons followed.</P>
<P>The plague is also mentioned under the year 1012, with vi∣olent rains and inundations, followed by an earthquake in 1013. But the necessary materials for a detail are wanting.</P>

<P>In 1015 appeared a comet, attended with violent tempests, and followed by famin in 1016. In 1017 another comet was seen, and the following year is noted as pestilential. But I have no particulars.</P>
<P>In 1020 was seen another comet, and the winter was exces∣sively severe, so that men perished with cold. This was fol∣lowed by pestilence, in which the bodies of the infected gene∣rated "serpents," says the historian; by which he probably means some species of worms. A similar fact will be related from Thuanus in the 16th century.</P>
<P>In 1021 was an earthquake, and the next year, the drouth and heat were extreme.</P>
<P>In 1025 the summer was wet. The plague raged in England, and in other parts of Europe, pestilence with violent earthquakes.</P>
<BIBL>Magd. Cent. 11. 13.</BIBL>
<P>In 1029 was an eruption of Heckla, and pestilence in some parts of Europe.</P>
<P>A comet in 1031 was accompanied, in its passage, through

the system, with great storms of wind and rain, producing vast inundations. In France, England and the east raged famin and pestilence. Locusts were added to these calamities, which were so severe in some parts of the world, that multitudes were com∣pelled to leave their country Violent earthquakes marked this year, and what is usual in the tempestuous seasons occasioned by comets distinguished by volcanic eruptions, a splendid meteor, or globe of fire.</P>
<P>During an eclipse of the sun in 1032 or 3, authors mention a singular phenomenon—a saffron color in the air, which gave to the human countenance a cadaverous aspect. But it might be merely the effect of a partial darkness, with a hazy atmosphers.</P>
<P>A severe winter in 1035, was followed by an eruption of Vesuvius in 1036. The frequent coincidences of this kind de∣serve notice.</P>
<P>In 1037 is noted an igneous appearance in the heavens, like a beam. These phenomena were followed by pestilence in Eng∣land and in the Emperor's army, and with earthquakes.</P>

<P>In 1042 commenced another distressing period. A comet in this year was followed by an eruption of Vesuvius in 1043 and snow in harvest. The year 1042 was very tempestuous and rainy; the dykes in Flanders yielded to the swelling ocean, and the low grounds were overwhelmed, with infinite destruction. At this time began a general famin in England, France and Germany. The year 1043 was also distinguished for rains and storms; autumnal snows were early, and an infectious disease carried off vast numbers of cattle. In 1044 there was great mortality among men.</P>
<P>In 1047 fell a deep snow in the west of Europe, which over∣whelmed small trees, and lay till March. In March 1048 was a violent earthquake, followed by a tempestuous season and great sickness. There was an eruption of Vesuvius the same year, and an earthquake in October. The reader will remark a very regular connection between eruptions of volcanoes and violent winds.</P>

<P><PB N="117" REF="036687_0121_100AA168D5FF0310"/>During this period the countries about the Hellespont were, for three years, ravaged by locusts.</P>
<P>In 1052 a tempest is noted which demolished many buildings. In 1053 a comet which was followed by a famin. But the seasons are not described.</P>
<P>In 1057 severe frost and great quantities of snow ruined the vines. During the following year, a comet was seen, the year after which the winter was very long and severe, and in 1060 prevailed famin, and plague among men and cattle.</P>
<P>In 1062 a trembling of the earth in Constantinople, attended with thunder and lightning, was succeeded by the plague. The next year was distinguished by a comet, visible 40 days, a tem∣pest of four days, deep snow, and extreme cold, which proved fatal to vines, trees, birds and cattle.</P>
<P>In 1065 several hundred thousand Scythians, marching to in∣vade the Roman empire, perished with pestilential diseases.</P>
<P>In 1066 a comet was seen in May, and a cold winter suc∣ceeded. Egypt and Arabia, countries not subject to earth∣quakes, were violently convulsed in November, and a plague speedily followed, which, authors affirm, swept away one half the inhabitants. This was attended with famin.</P>
<P>The north of Europe speedily felt similar calamities. Vio∣lent earthquakes in 1068, and a comet in May, of apparent di∣ameter equal to that of the moon, visible 40 days, were suc∣ceeded by famin. The country in England from Durham to York was depopulated. Men subsisted on dogs, cats and every unclean thing; or perished and their bodies were left to putrefy on the earth. The winters were unusually severe.</P>

<P>In 1074 another comet appeared and a hard winter. The winter of 1076 was excessively cold from Nov. to March, so that the roots of vines were killed. In April 1077 appeared a comet, and famin and plague raged in Constantinople with such mortality, that the living could not bury the dead. An earth∣quake was experienced in England. Shocks were also felt in 1081 and 1082.</P>
<P>In 1084 raged famin and pestilence; the latter cut off the

In 1086, were great inundations in Flanders, Italy and other countries; and in 1087 the fish died in the rivers.</P>
<BIBL>Magd. Cent. 11. Baron. vol. 11. 564. Stowe's Annals. Knighton. Hist. Ang. Script. 2353.</BIBL>
<P>Authors relate that in 1086, domestic fowls left the houses and fled to the woods. The two following years, the same ca∣lamities continued—bad seasons, murrain among cattle, and a violent fever, which appeared in the former year, raged in these and affected one half the people of England. In 1089 a burn∣ing plague destroyed mankind. Earthquakes distinguished these periods.</P>
<BIBL>Functius Chro. vol. 1. 102.</BIBL>
<P>In 1091 appeared a comet; another in 1094; a third in 1096, and a fourth in 1098.</P>
<P>In 1091, many violent tempests happened which levelled buildings, 600 houses were blown down in London; swarms of locusts darkened the sun, and the next year a plague raged, which the historian relates to have arisen from the putrefaction of their bodies. The place where the locusts appeared is not named.</P>
<P>A most severe winter in 1093, occured after a very rainy sum∣mer in England. The summer of 1094 was also excessively rainy.—The plague at the same time raged in England, Gaul and Germany. A violent earthquake with a tempest in 1094. The comet in Oct. 1096 was attended with great rains, which prevented the sowing of winter grain, and famin followed. Va∣rious fiery appearances and meteors were observed, during this period, and the winter of 1095 was severe.</P>
<P>In 1098 a pestilence invaded cattle, from the bad quality of their food, which had been injured by great rains. This was the year of the last comet above named, and in the following year, was a hard winter and a dearth. Syracuse was injured by an earthquake.</P>

<P>A dark day is mentioned in the year 1099.</P>
<P>In the year 1100 raged a pestilence in Palestine, said to have originated from the stench of dead bodies. In Syracuse, a vio∣lent earthquake demolished a tower, with the loss of many lives.

<P>In 1105, there was a discharge of fire from Heckla, and in the same year, a great quantity of snow, a violent earthquake in Jerusalem, about Christmas, and about the same time, a light in the west almost equal to the sun, and two mock suns.</P>
<P>In Feb. of the following year, a comet<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Supposed to be the same as that which appeared in 531 and in 1680.</NOTE> of unusual splen∣dor for three weeks was visible from three to nine o'clock, and two mock suns. A violent earthquake happened the same year. Many meteors were seen and violent tempests and inundations, with myriads of insects in the air, marked the disorder of the elements.—The year was also noted for sterility of grain, and a consequent dearth—men were attacked with plague and unusual diseases—"ignotis morbis, igne, flamma, ardore invisibili homi∣nes excruciati et absque ad ustionis nota extincti."</P>

<P>The reader cannot fail to remark how regularly the mention of comets is accompanied with a failure of crops, meteors, and tem∣pests. We have proof in modern times that these were not the

<P>In 1107 appeared a comet with a long coma—another was seen in Normandy in 1108.</P>
<P>In the year 1109 erysipelous diseases were epidemic in England; which afflicted and destroyed many people; their limbs covered with black spots, like carbuncles.</P>

<P>In December 1109 appeared a comet, and in June 1110 another, which spread its coma to the south. A severe winter, with deep snow and long continued cold, followed and sterility of grain. An unusual recess of water in the Trente, severe earthquake in Salop, and a mortality among men and cattle dis∣tinguished the year 1111.—An earthquake and severe plague are mentioned under the year 1112; but the year was remarkable for abundant crops of grain.—This year there was an extraor∣dinary recess of the water in the British Channel for a whole day, fish died in the water and domestic fowls took flight into the woods.</P>
<BIBL>Magd. Cent. 12. ca. 13. Knighton, Hist. Ang. Script. 2379.</BIBL>
<P>Here we have an account of a progression in the pestilence— from the eruptive diseases of 1109 to the plague in 1112—This is the modern order.</P>
<P>In 1113 or, as some authorities have it, in May 1114, a comet appeared, and in a period of distressing calamities. In this year there was an eruption from Heckla in Iceland.</P>
<P>In May 1113 an extraordinary snow very much injured trees and vegetables. In June a dreadful tempest laid waste whole countries, and the excessive heat of the summer produced dys∣entery and other pestilential epidemics. In 1114 many cities in Syria were prostrated by an earthquake; and its effects were felt in all the oriental countries. In November 1115 many houses in Antioch were swallowed up in a chasm rent in the earth. In January 1116 various places suffered by shocks of the earth, and in 1117 all Italy was shaken for forty days.</P>
<P>In 1113 Flanders was overwhelmed by an inundation, which compelled many Flemmings to abandon their country, and they settled in England.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="036687_0125_100AA170152AE260"/>This event seems to fix the approach of the comet in the year 1113.</P>
<P>Severe drouth and a singular recess of the ocean left rivers dry in 1114. October 15th people walked over the Thames between London bridge and the tower. In December the sky appeared to be in a flame.</P>
<P>The winter of 1115 was most rigorous, and a terrible mor∣tality swept away the cattle. A comet appeared this year also.</P>
<P>The year 1116 was rainy and fruits were destroyed. In 1117 swarms of locusts about Jerusalem devoured vegetation, and in England great damage was done by floods.</P>
<P>In 1118 and 1119 earthquakes were violent. In 1120 the locusts and mice overran Judea, and Trent suffered much from earthquakes. A severe winter followed in 1121, and a drouth the next year, which occasioned a scarcity of provision, and men and cattle perished.</P>
<P>In the foregoing period, no great pestilence is mentioned, but such diseases as were occasioned by intemperate seasons, except among cattle.</P>
<BIBL>Magd. Cent. 12. Baron. vol. 12. 117. Muratori, Tom. 5. p. 60. Maitland's Hist. Lond.</BIBL>
<P>In 1124 happened a very severe winter, which destroyed trees and vines—succeeded by a cold spring which retarded ve∣getation. The following year was noted for a destructive plague among men and cattle, in France and Brabant. Terrible was the famin in Italy, and in England so many people perished with hunger, that dead bodies lay in the highways unburied. In 1125 the famin, accompanied with pestilence, continued in Eng∣land, Germany and Italy. The season was excessively wet and all fruits were injured or destroyed. In 1126 appeared a comet in October, followed by a winter excessively severe, and in the following year, violent earthquakes occurred in Syria. Erysi∣pelous distempers were fatal in England.</P>
<P>In the pestilence of 1125, it was computed that one third of the people perished.</P>
<BIBL>Magd. Cent. 12. Baron. vol. 12. 160. Dufresnoy.</BIBL>
<P>In 1130, 31 and 32, happened the most destructive murrain
<PB N="122" REF="036687_0126_100AA1721B1307C0"/>
among cattle and fowls ever known in England. In 1131 an excessive drouth in France.</P>
<P>In October 1133 appeared a comet. The same year, Eng∣land was shaken by earthquakes, and inundations continued a whole month. Authors assert that the sun exhibited singular appearances, changing its figure and dimensions, and that there was a remarkable intemperature in the air. In modern times, the face of the sun is often disfigured with spots, and it is not unphilosophical to suppose that moving vapor in the air may sud∣denly change its apparent diameter.</P>
<P>In 1134 the sea broke into Flanders, as it did in the follow∣ing year. This year was rainy.</P>
<P>In 1135 the drouth destroyed vegetation and occasioned a dearth. The Rhine was fordable in almost any place. Terri∣ble tempests and earthquakes and an eruption of Vesuvius mark∣ed this period, and a dreadful plague ensued.</P>
<BIBL>Short, vol. 1. 118.</BIBL>
<P>The eruption of Vesuvius was in 1136 and a second in 1139. The summer of 1137 was as remarkable for drouth, as was that of 1135. The plague was universal. The disorders in the elements occasioned a long and desolating famin.</P>
<BIBL>Magd. Cent. 12. Pistorius, vol. 1. 156. Matthew Paris.</BIBL>
<P>Knighton mentions the sun's changing its form in 1133, and adds that a darkness happened which rendered a candle necessary in the day time.</P>
<BIBL>Chronocon.</BIBL>
<P>From this it is probable the sun presented appearances, like those which we observed on the 19th of May 1780, and which are usual in dark days.</P>
<P>The reader will remark the occurrence of such days, in years when electricity shakes the earth, or fire and lava are discharged by volcanoes. He will note also the drouth that preceded the eruption of Vesuvius in 1135 and 1138.</P>
<P>In 1140 was an earthquake in England. In 1141 a very severe winter. In 1143 the air, for a mile in extent, was filled with an unusual insect, with the body of a worm and the size of a fly. A general plague among men and cattle began the same year, and raged with great violence in various countries.
<PB N="123" REF="036687_0127_100AA174267D0318"/>
In 1144 or as some authors relate in May 1145 appeared a comet, illuminating the heavens, and the same year were violent earthquakes. In 1146 another comet, and the plague incredibly fatal. A famin prevailed with distressing severity, for 12 years, including the years just named.</P>
<BIBL>Magd. Cent. 12. Muratori, Tom. 5. p. 65. Pistorius, Germ. Script.</BIBL>
<P>If men, at this period, had any respite from natural evils, the intervals were very short. In 1150 a very severe winter and severe pestilence are recorded in the Saxon chronicle, together with famin and an eruption of fire in Iceland. Earthquakes, inundations and pestilence marked the subsequent years. The years 1151 and 2 are mentioned to have been very rainy—the winter of 1153 and 4 severe, and the summer of 1156 exces∣sively dry. These phenomena follow each other so rapidly, and are related with such brevity and in general terms, that it leaves the mind at a loss to what influence to ascribe the diseases which afflicted nations for a series of years about this period. In this gloomy and barbarous age of the world, history is concise and destitute of accurate observations.</P>
<P>In 1157 there was an eruption in Iceland, with a very cold winter. In 1158 an eruption of Vesuvius, an earthquake in England, and an inudation of the Tyber. Pestilence appeared in Scotland in 1154.</P>
<P>Not long after these events, Antioch, Tripoli, and Damas∣cus were convulsed by an earthquake, with the loss of 20,000 lives.</P>
<P>After an interval of more than 300 years, during which I find in history no account of any eruptions from Etna, this vol∣cano is introduced to our notice by an almost continual eruption from 1160 to 1169. Earthquakes were violent in 1161—in Sicily an inundation drowned 5000 people—in 1163 one of the greatest inundations in Friesland ever known, preceded by a very severe winter. At this time the plague was raging in Mi∣lan, Normandy and Aquitain. Unusual darkness is mentioned in 1164. In England, the sea overflowed twelve miles of country, destroying men, cattle and improvements. In 1165, a comet appeared with a long coma; 12,000 people perished by an inundation in Sicily, and Norfolk and Suffolk in England
<PB N="124" REF="036687_0128_100AA175E6758CF0"/>
were shaken by an earthquake. Most of Frederick Barbarossa's army perished by the plague in 1167. This period was remark∣able for great wind and hail.</P>
<P>In 1169 the eruption of Etna was very violent; Catana was demolished by an earthquake, and 15,000 people perished —Asia Minor felt the shock. In the next year, so general and tremendous were the earthquakes, that many of the best cities in Syria, Palestine and other countries, were laid in ruins. Germany suffered by earthquakes and inundations. Pestilence marked this period, and in 1172 a malignant dysentery raged in England.</P>
<P>In 1174 mention is made, for the first time, of an epidemic cough or catarrh. There is however no question that influenza and measles always preceded or accompanied pestilence in the ancient and middle ages, as they do in modern times. Authors have neglected to record the prevalence of all the minor epi∣demics, or nearly all, until after the invention of printing.</P>
<P>In 1175 history mentions an eruption of Etna, pestilential diseases in England and a famin. In 1176 a long and severe winter, and an irruption of the sea into Holland with immense destruction—a severe drouth followed with a loss of seed time. The year 1177 was distinguished for violent winds.</P>
<P>In 1178 a comet was succeeded by a most rigorous winter, and destructive inundations. On the 11th of September, was a dark day, with singular appearances of the sun and moon. A∣nother comet is mentioned in 1179 and a great hail storm.</P>
<P>In 1181 appeared a comet, and earthquakes, with an eruption of Etna, marked this period.—At this time Denmark was al∣most laid desolate by excessive rains, famin and pestilence, while Germany lost half of its inhabitants by the plague. Some al∣lowance must be made for exaggeration in the accounts of the more destructive plagues. This was an age of superstition, and the imaginations of men were susceptible of strong impressions.</P>
<P>In 1185 is recorded a most violent earthquake, over Europe. Calabria was overturned, and thousands perished. On the Adriatic, a whole city was swallowed up, and the shock was felt to the Baltic.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="036687_0129_100AA1795141F800"/>In 1186 Russia and Poland were desolated by locusts and pestilence. The winter was so mild, that the following harvest was in May, and vintage in August. In Carinthia, the locusts devoured every green thing.</P>
<P>An unusual conjunction of planets happened, this year, in Libra; and so great was the alarm, in that ignorant and credu∣lous age, on account of the calamities predicted by astrologers, that a solemn fast of three days was appointed by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Luckily no uncommon event happened in Eng∣land, until the next year, when pestilential diseases prevailed a∣mong men and cattle. In 1188 the plague was in Rome.</P>

<P>I have no accounts of comets in this period from 1181 to 1211; altho it is probable that several were visible.</P>
<P>How far may we suppose the conjunction of all the planets had any influence in producing the remarkably mild winter of 1186?</P>
<P>In January 1193 was a remarkable aurora borealis.</P>
<P>In 1193 and 4 excessive rains injured the grain and produced a dearth. In England an acute pestilential fever was epidemic and left in health scarcely a number of persons sufficient to tend the sick. The usual forms of burial were neglected, and dead bodies were thrown into graves in piles. A severe winter put a stop to this epidemic. Brompton, with a natural partiality for religious houses, informs us that the only places exempted from the destruction of this pestilence, were the monasteries—Cotem∣porary with this disease was an earthquake and a singular fiery appearance in the sky. Short places this fever under the year 1196 and calls it a "burning ague." See the years 1001 and 1723.</P>
<BIBL>Brompton's Hist. Ang. Script. 1271. Magd. Cent. 12. Short, vol. 1. 130.</BIBL>
<P>The winter of 1200 was cold; the summer of 1201 was very rainy; and the winter succeeding was severe almost beyond example. In 1203 was a sore famin from bad seasons. In 1205 a rigorous winter and a great hail storm; in 1206 an erup∣tion of Heckla; but I have no account of any epidemics that prevailed.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="036687_0130_100AA17AD8F9BCE0"/>In 1210 was an eruption of Heckla, and a cold winter. In 1211 appeared a comet, in May, visible for 18 days. Great tempests marked this period with inundations. In 1212 Venice and Damascus were violently agitated by earthquakes, and in Sicily thousands perished by an inundation. These phenomena were the heralds of a severe pestilence, which, in 1213, was so fatal in Italy, that authors affirm scarcely one tenth of the in∣habitants survived. In the year following appeared two comets.</P>
<P>The year 1219 was distinguished for the approach of a large comet, distressing inundations, in one of which perished 36,000 inhabitants, an earthquake and a volcanic eruption in Iceland. In 1220 the plague was so fatal in Damietta, that authors re∣late three persons only survived out of 70,000. By this we are to understand the disease to have been extremely mortal; but we must reject the literal meaning of such relations. It is doubt∣less true that the pestilence of this period has rarely been ex∣ceeded in mortality.</P>
<P>This period was very calamitous in the north of Europe. In 1221 Poland was afflicted by excessive rains, and the floods which followed swept away whole villages. The winter suc∣ceeding was severe, so that frozen wine was sold by weight, while famin and pestilence almost desolated Europe. In most countries, the living could hardly bury the dead; and in some cities, scarcely a person survived.</P>
<P>In the year 1222 appeared a comet of unusual magnitude and the summer was excessively dry. A frost, with deep snow in April, destroyed the fruits. In autumn the earth was deluged with rains and swept with violent winds. An earthquake shook Germany and Lombardy; in Cyprus two cities were demolished; the shocks were frequent and continued for two months, in Brixia, Venice, England and other countries. The plague raged, for three years, with uncontrolable fury, in Germany, Hungary, France and other countries; falling on cattle as well as man.</P>
<P>During this dreadful period, the discharges of fire and lava, from the volcanoes in Iceland, exceeded what had been before known in the same space of time. There were two eruptions in
<PB N="127" REF="036687_0131_100AA17CDC66A140"/>
1222, one from Heckla; the other from Reikenese; and the eruptions of the latter were repeated in 1223, 1225 and 1226. In 1224 was a severe drouth; in 1225 a rigorous winter, fol∣lowed by a dearth, and mortal diseases among sheep.</P>
<P>Let any candid man observe the natural phenomena accompa∣nying this desolating period, from 1219 to 1226; and decide for himself how far the fire or electricity of the system is an agent in producing them, and the attending diseases.</P>
<P>We observe here the progress of pestilence to be the same as in modern times. The plague appeared in Egypt almost at the same time with the comet, and first derangement of the elements in 1219 and 1220; but was two, three, four and five years later in the high northern latitudes.</P>
<P>No comet is mentioned in the histories of this dark period, as far as I can find, from 1222 to 1240; but that there was one, in the vicinity of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rth, between 1228 and 1233, is very probable.</P>
<P>In 1228 an inundation in Friesland demolished whole towns, and it was estimated that 100,000 people perished. Great rains in summer and excessive heat were followed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> severe winter, with deep snow.</P>
<P>In 1230 the waters of the Tyber rose to the stairs of St. Peter's Church, and drowned the lower city. July and August were excessively hot. An inundation of the Danube in 1232, and in 1233 so severe a frost, that rivers were converted into highways in Italy; and earthquakes marked the year, with a dark day.</P>
<P>During this period from 1230 to 1233, France, Denmark and Italy were wasted by dreadful famin and plague. These ca∣lamities continued in 1234 and 5, in England and France. In London alone 20,000 people were starved. Worms and locusts devoured the fruits of the earth.</P>
<P>The winter of 1236 was rainy—the following summer ex∣tremely dry, and in England most distressing agues were ep∣idemic. In 1237 was an eruption of a volcano in Iceland.</P>
<P>In 1239 pestilence again raged—a new star, like Lucifer appeared. Famin was so severe that persons fed on human flesh.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="036687_0132_100A89A661F37B88"/>In 1240 a comet appeared in Feb. and was visible a month. Mortal diseases prevailed, and authors relate that the fish, on the English coast <HI>had a battle,</HI> in which eleven whales and a multitude of other fish were slain and cast ashore. The cause to which this phenomenon is assigned is laughable enough; but the fact is important; for it strengthens modern observations, that when pestilential diseases prevail on the surface of the earth, fish often perish beneath the water. Of this no doubt can re∣main; and this alone demonstrates that the <HI>pestilential cause</HI> is as powerful or nearly so, at the bottom of rivers and the ocean, as on the earth—a fact that reduces the theory of propagating the fomes of epidemic diseases in vessels, clothes and similar articles, from one country to another, to a thing of very trifling consideration.</P>
<P>The winter of 1240 was very severe—the snow was deep and cattle perished. An eruption of fire in Iceland is noted the same year.</P>
<P>In 1242 the Thames rose by means of excessive rains and overwhelmed the country for six miles about Lambeth. The years 1243 and 4 were remarkable for continued drouth, mete∣ors and a most fatal plague.—An eruption of fire in Iceland in 1245.</P>
<P>In 1247 a violent earthquake was experienced in England, and in September a fatal plague. The earthquake was in Feb∣ruary and followed by a very rainy summer. The winter fol∣lowing was so mild, that people wore their summer clothes; but from March to May was cold.</P>
<P>The summer of 1250 was rainy and tempestuous, followed by a hard winter. The summer of 1251 was intolerably hot, and epidemic diseases prevailed, with great mortality.</P>
<P>In 1252 late frosts in spring, and succeeding drouth destroy∣ed the fruits of the earth. At the close of July came great rains, vegetation started, but great mortality prevailed among cat∣tle. At Michaelmas began the plague in London, which spread o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r England, and raged till August following. This is one instance of the plague's appearing in autumn, running through

the winter, and ceasing about the time, in the hot season, when that disease usually begins.</P>
<P>The winter of 1254 was rigorously cold, a murrain among sheep was very fatal, and in England and France a mortal dis∣temper among horses called the <HI>evil of the tongue,</HI> but it is not described.</P>
<P>In 1255 appeared a comet; tides rose to an uncommon height; rivers swelled with excessive rains and tempests levelled buildings. In 1256 the rains and tempests were equally violent, and another comet appeared. In 1257 the summer was also excessively rai∣ny. From these rains came a dearth of corn in England and France in 1258, which was also rainy; and famin and diseases made havoc with human life. Fifteen thousand persons perished by hunger in London; but I have no account that the plague prevailed at that time.</P>
<P>To this series of wet seasons succeeded severe drouth in 1259 and 1260; and the mortality continued till the summer of 1259 —after which plenty succeeded to want.</P>
<P>The year 1261 was rainy in England and Scotland, and a dearth was the consequence in the following year.</P>
<P>In 1262 an eruption of a volcano in Iceland.</P>
<P>In 1263 a severe frost in winter converted the Thames into a highway for men and horses. In 1264 a comet was visible from June 20th to September 28th and pestilential diseases swept away horses and cattle.</P>
<P>In 1266 swarms of Palmer worms devoured all vegetables in Scotland, and several villages on the Tay and Froth were swept away by floods. These were preceded by a remarkable halo.</P>
<P>In 1268 appeared a comet, and violent tempests and rain are noted, together with sterility of grain and dearth in Austria and Sicily.</P>
<P>In 1269 the winter was extremely severe; horses and car∣riages passing on the ice over the Thames. A plague raged among the Crusaders, on their march to the holy land, of which died the French king and his son. Some authors mention a comet of stupendous magnitude under this date; which is prob∣ably the same as that noted under the foregoing year.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="036687_0134_100AA180EAB1B3E8"/>In 1274 was a great earthquake and a comet of frightful as∣pect —an earthquake also in 1275.</P>
<P>In this year, it is related, the rot among sheep was first known in England. As this was said to be an imported disease, it is proper to state how it was introduced. Short on Air, vol. 1. 155, says, "This year, a rich Frenchman brought into North∣umberland a Spanish ewe, as big as a two year old calf, which sheep being rotten, soon infected the country, so that the disease overspread the whole kingdom, and lasted 25 or 28 years, till it left very few sheep alive. This was the first rot ever known in England."</P>
<P>The reader will judge which is the greater calf, the man who gravely tells or the man who believes such a tale as this.</P>
<P>Historians fix upon the year 1277 for the formation of the Dollert Sea, between Groningen and East-Friesland, by a great inundation, which overwhelmed 33 villages irrecoverably; with many farm-houses in the open country.</P>
<P>In 1280 a great inundation was followed by a very cold win∣ter. In 1281 Poland was afflicted with famin. The winter of 1282 was the severest then remembered; an earthquake shook Italy and a plague raged in Denmark. In 1283 the same mal∣ady prevailed in Scotland. In 1284 the winter was one of the mildest ever known; the year was also remakable for great tempests, an unusual darkness and an eruption of Etna. The year 1285 was noted for a similar darkness, most parching drouth and the commencement of a famin in England.</P>
<P>This drouth was followed in 1286, by the approach of a comet. In this year, Prussia was infested with a new species of worms, whose sting was poisonous. Swarms of flies and pesti∣lential fevers in Spain nearly destroyed the army of the French king, then making war on Arragon.</P>
<P>In 1287 fifteen islands in Zealand were overwhelmed by an inundation, with the loss of 15,000 inhabitants.</P>
<P>In 1288 the summer was excessively hot and dry Grain was however abundant in this and the preceding year The drouth was followed by great mortality and a severe winter.</P>

in May. Italy was shaken by earthquakes. In the follow∣ing year, England was distressed by severe famin, thousands of the poor perishing with hunger. A severe drouth exhausted all the springs and rivers, grass withered and cattle were fed on straw. The winter of 1293-4 was extremely cold, and an eruption of Heckla happened in 1294.</P>
<P>In 1295 and 6 many countries were afflicted with famin, and in 1297 the plague prevailed in Scotland.</P>
<P>A comet of great magnitude appeared in 1298, or as other authors say, in 1299, and others in 1300; whose approximation was attended with violent earthquakes in Germany, and other places in 1299, and with an eruption of Heckla in 1300. The year 1298 was noted for a great mortality among the Jews, and multitudes perished in the east with various diseases in 1299.</P>
<P>In 1305 appeared a comet, attended with fatal pestilence. A hard winter followed, and the Rhine was covered with ice.</P>
<P>In 1311 mount Heckla discharged its fiery contents; in 1312 appeared a comet, and a three years famin commenced in Bo∣hemia and Poland, which was exceedingly distressing. Men be∣came like wolves and preyed on human flesh.</P>
<P>In 1314 incessant rains destroyed the grain; a comet ap∣peared in December following, and in 1316 raged a desola∣ting dysentery in England, accompanied with an acute fever, which, like the true plague, left scarcely survivors to bury the dead. The famin continued to rage with all its horrors. Horse flesh was a delicious dish. Wheat sold at forty shillings the quar∣ter; equivalent to £30 sterling in these days.</P>
<P>In 1318 the winter was severe, and in 1319 the plague pre∣vailed in England. A murrain spread among cattle, at the same time, with fatal destruction.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have no account of any comets from 1315, to 1337—which may be owing to the defect of my historical materials.</NOTE></P>

<P>In travelling through the dark ages, we find but few interest∣ing descriptions; and nothing could have induced me to under∣take the tedious detail of detached facts respecting pestilence, but a strong desire to ascertain all that can be discovered of the operations of nature, in producing epidemic diseases. It is of infinite importance, in discussing this subject, to know whether certain phenomena of seasons, of subterranean fire, and unusual animals, uniformly attend pestilence; and to ascertain, if possi∣ble, the <HI>order</HI> in which they proceed, for the purpose of dis∣covering whether they are connected with each other as cause and effect. Barren as the history of the barbarous ages really is, we yet find it to contain a great number of facts, that will assist us in developing the causes of epidemics.

<HEAD>SECTION IV. Historical View of pestilential epidemics, from the year <HI>1340,</HI> to <HI>1500.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE pestilence next to be described was the most general and awfully distressing that the world ever experienced. The precise year when it appeared in Asia, where it began, is not as∣certained; but probably about 1345, perhaps a year or two ear∣lier.</P>
<P>The histories of that age <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elate, that it commenced in Cathay, China, and was preceded by the bursting of a huge meteor or globe of fire; or as others relate, the fire burst from the earth. These accounts were taken from Genoese seamen, and are recor∣ded by Villani; bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Dr. Mead, with that obstinacy that rejects truth when opposed to preconceived theory, thinks the report incredible, and questions not the disease originated in Egypt. Had he ever examined the subject, like an impartial man, he would have believed the account of the seamen, for there is not a more certain phenomenon in nature, than the appearance of meteors and the explosion of fire in pestilential periods.</P>
<BIBL>Villani, book 1. ch. 2. Mezeray, Tom. 1. 798.</BIBL>
<P>This plague appeared in 1346 in Egypt, Syria, Greece, Turkey; in 1347 in Sicily, Pisa, Genoa and other parts of It∣aly; in 1348 it appeared in the south of France, first in Avig∣non, which is not a maritime city, but at a distance from the sea, and afterwards in other parts of the kingdom and in all the southern provinces of Spain. At the close of the same year, it made its appearance in England, first in Dorsetshire, and soon travelled over the whole country. In 1349 it overrun Ireland, Holland, Scotland, and in 1350 all Germany, Hungary and the north of Europe.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="036687_0138_100AA189436C82B8"/>This pestilence was remarkable for raging in winter as well as summer, even in the north of Europe. In France it first ap∣peared at Avignon in February and prevailed there nearly a year.</P>
<BIBL>Muratori, vol. 3. part 2. 588.</BIBL>
<P>Short has placed its first appearance in the south of England in September. But Archbishop Parker has placed its origin just after Christmas. His words are, "Ea statim post nativitatis dominicae celebratum festum, ipsa nimirum hyeme et rerum omni∣um ad victum necessarium copia, cum vix ulla contagionis suspicio oriri mortalibus potuit, incepit." "Immediately after the feast of our Lord's nativity, in winter and amidst the greatest abun∣dance of provisions, when there could be no suspicion that a contagious disease would arise among men, the plague commen∣ced." It raged about five months and according to this author ceased in May following; altho other authors relate, that it had not gone through the kingdom till late in the summer.</P>
<BIBL>Parker's Antiq. Brit. p. 360.</BIBL>
<P>In the English Annals by William Wyrcester, in the black book of the Exchequer, it is said that this plague prevailed in the parts of London and its vicinity in autumn 1349.</P>
<P>These different accounts of the time of the first appearance of this disease, are reconcileable on the principles which mod¦ern observations have unfolded. It is found that the plague is <HI>always</HI> preceded, for some months, and in some instances, for two or three years, by other malignant fevers, which increase gradually to the violence of the true plague; and often the de∣grees of violence are so gradual, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> physicians themselves can hardly determin a line of distinction between the malignant dis∣ease, which is the precursor of the plague, and the plague itself. That is, they are at a loss to know where the malignant dis∣ease ends and the plague begins. Hence all the disputes, at the commencement of a pestilence, whether the <HI>disease i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the plague or not</HI>—a circumstance which appears to have marked the origin of all great plagues, and yet physicians and philosophers in Eu∣rope seem never to have suspected the cause.—These facts will be hereafter demonstrated, and they annihilate at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> blow the whole doctrine of the propagation of that disease from country to coun∣try by infection.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="036687_0139_100AA18B48451C78"/>From the uniform operations of nature in the case of epi∣demic pestilential diseases of the kind under consideration, there must have been in England, during the summer, previous to the appearance of the plague, malignant fevers, which might ap∣proach to the violence and fatality of the plague. This circum∣stance might create a small difference in the accounts of the ori∣gin of the plague—inaccurate observers mistaking the one dis∣ease for the other—or rather naming the previous putrid fever, the plague, before it put on the characteristic symptoms.</P>
<P>It is possible however that these authors may refer to the com∣mencement of the disease in different parts of England.</P>
<P>This formidable calamity deserves a particular description, with all the phenomena attending it.</P>
<P>In 1347 appeared a frightful comet, in August. Preceding and during the prevalence of the disease, the whole earth was shaken by most tremendous earthquakes. All Germany was shaken in 1346. In 1349 on the 9th of Sept. Sicily was shaken to its foundation, together with all Italy. In Greece many cities were overthrown, and in many places towns and castles were demolished. Thousands of people were swallowed up and the courses of rivers were obstructed.</P>
<P>Over Avignon was suspended a meteor or pillar of fire for an hour. The heavens were at times illuminated as with flame, and meteors were frequent.</P>
<P>I have no particular description of all the seasons, during the five years, in which this mortal pestilence desolated Europe. But the year 134<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the year of the comet, was, in England, excessively rainy, and the air humid.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mutius, in the collection of German history, says that the whole year 1348 was southerly, moist weather, but there were no heavy rains to cool the air. Fruit was abundant, but corn was not nutri∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous. See vol. 3. 241.—In England the rains continued from May to Christmas.</NOTE> Short, from Johan Cole de Billona, mentions that a hot air, cloudy and moist at∣mosph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re had continued for some years, and that a malignant, contagious peripneumony followed in all Europe. But unfortu∣nately the compiler leaves us in the dark as to the precise time of
<PB N="136" REF="036687_0140_100AA18CEB13C948"/>
its appearance, and whether before or after the other forms of this pestilence.</P>
<P>Mezeray relates that in China, the disease originated from a vapor, which burst from the earth, was horribly offensive and consumed the face of the country through an extent of 200 leagues. This account may be inaccurate, but is not to be wholly rejected. That some action of subterranean heat was instrumental in generating the disease, is very probable; or at least that some phenomena of fire accompanied it, because this supposition is consonant to the whole series of modern observa∣tions.</P>
<P>The pestilential state of air, in that period, is strongly marked by the appearance of myriads of unusual and loathsome insects, not only in China, but in Europe. They are des<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> as young serpents, or as venemous insects, or as large vermin with tails and eight short legs—in which description, probably, a frightened imagination had some share of infl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nce. But of the fact of their existence, there can be no doubt.</P>
<P>In the Ouse there was a great inundation just before Ascen∣sion day, and in York began this plague speedily after the flood.</P>
<P>The symptoms of this fatal malady were—violent af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ction in the head and stomach, buboes and other glandular swellings; small swellings like pimples or blisters; usually a feve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a vomiting or spitting of blood.—The swellings in the glands▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e infallible signs of the disease; but the most fatal symptom was, the pimples or blisters spread over the whole body. Hemorrha∣ges from the mouth, nose and other parts, indicated a universal and sudden disorganization of the blood. The patient usually died in three days or less—which denotes the virulence of the poison, or rather the activity of the disease, which destroyed the powers of life in half the time, which the bilious plague usually employs.</P>
<P>The peripneumony which was epidemic about the same time, appeared in a burning fever, insatiable thirst, a black tongue, anxiety and pains about the heart, short breath, a cough with expectoration of a mixed matter, open mouth, raging delirium, fury, red, turbid or black urine, restlessness, and watchings,
<PB N="137" REF="036687_0141_100AA18E74A5E7C0"/>
black eruptions, anthraces, buboes, and in some, corroding ulcers over the whole body. The disease usually terminated the 4th day, sometimes not till the 7th. The blood was black and thick; but sometimes greenish and watery or yellowish.—Venesection was certain death. The disease baffled medical skill—the only remedies that appeared to relieve, were laxatives early admin∣istered, cupping and scarification, leeches applied to the hemor∣rhoids, and inwardly, infusions of mild, diaphoretic, attenua∣ting, pectoral vegetables.</P>
<P>It will be hereafter proved that malignant pleurisy and peripneu∣mony usually form a part of that series of diseases which always occur during a period of general contagion. When plague and yellow fever occur in <HI>summer,</HI> in northern climates, pleurisy and peripneumony often assume, in <HI>winter,</HI> great and even pestilential violence.</P>
<P>This plague was so deadly that at least half or two thirds of the human race perished in about 8 years. It was most fatal in cities, but in no place died less than a third of the inhabitants. In many cities perished nine out of ten of the people, and many places were wholly depopulated. In London 50,000 dead bod∣ies were buried in one grave yard. In Norwich died about the same number. In Venice died 100,000—in Lubec, 90,000— in Florence the same number. In the east perished twenty mil∣lions in one year.—In Spain the disease raged three years and carried off two thirds of the people. Alfonso 2d. died with it while besieging Gibraltar.</P>
<P>In this fatal period, the apprehension of death destroyed the value of property. In England, and probably in other coun∣tries, cattle were neglected and they ran at large over the coun∣try. The corn perished in the fields for want of reapers; whole vill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ges were depopulated; and after the malady ceased, multi∣tudes of houses and buildings of all kinds were seen mouldering to ruin. A horse which before had been worth forty shillings, after the sickness, sold for half a mark.</P>
<P>Altho in the year preceding there had been a plenty of pro∣visions, yet the neglect of agriculture during the general distress produced a famin. Such was the loss of laborers, that the few
<PB N="138" REF="036687_0142_100AA191234A4958"/>
survivors afterwards demanded exorbitant wages, and the Par∣liament of England was obliged to interfere, and limit their wa∣ges, and even compel men to labor.—See 23d Edward 3. A. D. 1350. The preamble states, that a great part of the people, especially workmen and servants had died of the late pestilence, and those who survived, seeing the necessity of men, demanded excessive wages.</P>
<P>This disease was particularly fatal in Denmark—all business was at a stand, towns were deserted, and all was terror and des∣pair. It reached the highest northern latitudes; it broke out in Iceland, and was so fatal, that the settlements there are sup∣posed not to have since recovered their population. It was cal∣led the <HI>sorte diod,</HI> black death.</P>
<P>In some places people attempted to escape infection by taking their families on board of vessels, and putting to sea; but it was in vain; they were seized in every place, without regard to age or sex.</P>
<P>In 1348 the malady swept away the Greenland merchants and seamen. This disease also, or some other cause destroyed the colony of Danes in that country, for it was extinguished and has never been found or heard of to this day.</P>
<P>This pestilence was remarkably fatal to the monks and regular clergy of all descriptions. In one society at Montpeliers, of 140 members died all but 7: About the same proportion perished in Magdalen Society. In Marseilles, of 140 not one survived. But a circumstance related in Knighton's Chronicon deserves particular notice. At Avignon where the disease first appeared in France, 66 of the Carmelites had died, before the citizens were apprized of the fact; and when it was discovered, the re∣port circulated that the brethren had killed each other.</P>
<P>An important consequence results from the fact—that this plague first appeared in a monastery, which might be crouded with lazy, idle, filthy monks; in a city not commercial, nor a sea port. There was no idea of any imported infection; but there must have been strong <HI>local</HI> causes, which first excited into action the general contagion which, at that time, pervaded the atmosphere over the whole globe.</P>
<P>Such was the havoc made by this pestilence among the clergy
<PB N="139" REF="036687_0143_100AA193B0819270"/>
in England, says Knighton, that a vicarage which before the plague, might have been supplied for four or five marks a year, or two marks and the man's board, was raised to the price of twen∣ty marks or twenty pounds.</P>

<P>This pestilential period was preceded and attended with all the usual phenomena of fatal Epidemics.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Except eruptions of volcanoes, of which I have no account, at this period except in Iceland in 1340. But my accounts of volcanoes are very imperfect.</NOTE> The earthquakes and the insects have been noticed. Abortions were among the remarka∣ble precursors of this malady. The same fact is noticed by Diemerbroeck, before the great plague at Nimeguen, in 1635. The same has been mentioned by the authors he quoted, Fores∣tus, Sennertes, and others; and is ascribed to the tenderness and debility of the heart and Viscera. Hence pregnant women first feel the effects of a state of air unfriendly to the support of life, and if they are seized with plague, are always its victims.</P>
<P>Another phenomenon attending this plague was the <HI>death of fish.</HI> This circumstance, with the bad state of the water, which is often affected by the pestilential state of the elements, and was greatly affected in this period, gave rise to a report that the Jews had poisoned the wells and springs. The prejudices against the Jews, which have marked and scandalized all christian coun∣tries, except America, were at their height in the reign of Ed∣ward the 3d of England, the period under consideration. These prejudices drove legislators and princes to exercise every species of cruelty upon the Israelites, on account of their usury; and when the report of their poisoning the water circulated, the pop∣ulace in some places and especially in Germany, rose and assassi∣nated multitudes of these unfortunate men.</P>
<P>The death of animals, particularly of sheep, marked the same period. In England, 5000 died in one pasture. The state of the air and water was so pestilential that it is averred by historians, the fowls and fishes had blotches on them.</P>

He says that the mal∣ady was of two kinds—"the first, and <HI>which preceded the other about two mouths,</HI> was a fever, with spitring of blood," not un∣like that which prevailed in the time of Fracastorius. All who were seized with these symptoms, died in three days.</P>
<P>The other kind, which succeeded the first, came on with con∣tinued fever, carbuncles and abscesses, in the glands.—This was as fatal as the other, except near its decline, and the patient died in five days.</P>

<P>It is remarkable, that the disease which is technically called <HI>plague,</HI> pestis, is always preceded by a similar fever. It is in fact the <HI>plague in its first stages,</HI> tho it does not exhibit the gland∣ular swellings, which modern physicians contend are characteris∣tic of true plague, and mark a generic or at least a specific differ∣ence between that and any other kind of typhus fever. This fact of a <HI>progressiveness</HI> in the disease, annihilates the favorite no∣tion of deducing all plagues from infection; a notion which is bandied about between physicians and legislators like a tennis ball, tho unhappily for mankind, infinitely less harmless.</P>
<P>At the close of this dreadful period, in 1350, were severe earth∣quakes in Italy. In 1356 a violent shock in Switzerland, and in Germany, especially on the Rhine, which did great injury. To this succeeded most violent rains, and famin and pestilence in Germany, with prodigious mortality.</P>

<P>Brabant escaped this terrible pestilence and so did Milan.</P>
<P>In 1352 authors relate that 900,000 people in China perished by famin.</P>
<P>The rainy and humid seasons which introduced the great pesti∣lence of 1347-50, were succeeded by drouth in 1350, a comet in 1351, with tremendous storms, and a meteor which burst
<PB N="141" REF="036687_0145_100AA1976EA1C268"/>
with a heavy report. The winter following was severe, and in 1354 Africa and Cyprus were devoured by locusts.</P>
<P>In England prevailed epidemic madness in 1355.</P>
<P>In 1358 was a severe winter, followed by an eruption in Ice∣land, and a wasting plague in Italy in 1359. According to Bac∣cace, Florence lost 100,000 citizens, and Petrarch says, scarce∣ly ten of a thousand survived. There was a great mortality partic∣ularly among child-bed women, and cattle did not escape.</P>
<P>This pestilence also became nearly general. In 1361 Milan, which had escaped in 1348, was severely afflicted, as was all France, England and Ireland, and it was computed that Scot∣land lost one third of its inhabitants. This plague was called the <HI>second</HI> in the reign of Edward III, and it was in time of peace.</P>
<P>In this pestilential time, occurred a remarkable storm of hail and snow, in April 1360. The tendency of the elements in such periods to generate hail and snow, is a fact that well deserves consideration.</P>
<P>In January 1361, a violent tempest spread desolation over Europe. The winter was severe, and the summer dry. In March 1362 appeared a comet in the North East, with a vast co∣ma, and an eruption in Iceland. A dearth and diseases among cattle followed.</P>
<P>This last pestilence differed from that in 1348, in two or three particulars. It raged with most violence, on mountainous dis∣tricts, where the air was pure, and where the plague of 1348 did not prevail. It attacked the nobility and gentry with more vio∣lence than the poor; contrary to the usual fact; whereas the dis∣ease of 1348 was most fatal to persons in the humbler walks of life.</P>

<P>The comet and volcano of 1362 were followed in 1363 by a winter of extraordinary severity, which lasted from September to April. The Rhine was covered with ice for ten weeks.</P>
<P>The year 1365 was rainy, and the plague carried off 20,000 people in Cologne, and the vicinity. In 1366 an eruption in Iceland destroyed 70 farms. The same year was very sickly in England and deaths sudden.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="036687_0146_100AA19A0533B210"/>In 1368 was visible in March a comet with a coma, and the crops failed. In this year commenced in England the third great plague in the reign of Edward III.; the reader will note that this was preceded by a sickly year in 1366. The mortal∣ity was great, and especially about Oxford. The most fatal year was 1369, and in Ireland the disease raged in 1370. I have no particulars of the progress of the disease on the conti∣nent; but it was very fatal.</P>

<P>In 1373 raged an epidemic madness among the lower people in England; and in 1374 a similar disorder prevailed in France and Italy. During pestilential periods, some general cause seems to affect the brain in a powerful manner, even in persons who escape the plague.</P>
<P>In 1374 also was an eruption of a volcano in Iceland. There was also famin, a violent plague in Italy and some parts of France. In 1371 there had been a severe earthquake in the south of France.</P>
<BIBL>Murat. Tom. 3. 646. 649.</BIBL>
<P>In 1379 commenced a great sickness in the north of England, which almost laid waste the country; and in 1380 was seen a comet. The disease is not described, but it was the forerunner of a most dreadful plague. Provisions were good and cheap.</P>
<P>In 1381 and 2 considerable earthquakes were felt in England, and a severe pestilence appeared at Avignon in France, which raged for four or five years, depopulating many cities. It pre∣vailed in Italy, France, Germany, England, Ireland, Greece, and the East.</P>
<P>There was an eruption of Etna in 1381, and the year closed with great rains. The year 1382 was without winds. The plague was most fatal to children, and great ravages were made also among the friars. In this pestilence Lubec lost 90,000 people.</P>

<P>In 1388 the drouth was so severe, that the Rhine was ford∣able at Cologne. In 1389 violent tempests raged in England, with great destruction; and in the year following, was an erup∣tion
<PB N="143" REF="036687_0147_100AA19B8D967078"/>
of a volcano in Iceland. In modern days, we observe the same train of phenomena, evidently depending on one general cause. In 1389 appeared a singular meteor or light in the heavens.</P>
<P>The year 1389 was remarkable for the death of children in all parts of England. From the phenomena that attended and the diseases which followed, compared with the order of diseases in modern days, it appears very probable that this disease was a species of Angina, which almost invariably precedes the plague. In the next year, a deadly plague raged in the north of England. Swarms of gnats and flies marked this period, and some parts of the continent were overrun with locusts.</P>
<BIBL>Pistor. vol. 1. Short on Air.</BIBL>
<P>The reader will remark the excessive drouth preceding the eruption in Iceland and the fiery appearance in the heavens in the year of the tempest. In these phenomena, nature is nearly uniform.</P>
<P>It is a very common event that dysentery of a malignant type succeeds the plague. Such was the case in England, in 1391, when this disease was epidemic and very mortal. A dearth of corn might have contributed to the same event; but it is often the fact, without any scarcity of food.</P>
<P>An uncommon redness of the sun is mentioned in July of 1391, and for six weeks after, thick vapor or clouds. Perhaps these might have been occasioned by the eruption in Iceland, in the preceding year: as it appears to have been a phenomenon somewhat similar to that which Europe beheld with amazement and terror in 1783.—I have however my suspicions that while the central fires expel immense quantities of burning lava, from volcanoes, they may force through the earth in the adjoining continents, a subtle vapor, that is invisible, until it is collected and condensed in the higher regions of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e atmosphere.</P>
<P>The beginning of the 15th century was marked by a severe and desolating pestilence. The disease first appeared in the last year or two of the former century. In 1399 the mortality was such in Spain, especially in Andalusia, that the king was obliged to suspend the law which restrained widows from marrying with∣in

In 1406 the sea broke into Holland, Zealand and Flanders, with prodigious injury. A plague carried off 30,000 people in London; and a comet the same year. The winters following were so severe that most birds died. In Sept. there were great floods from rain. In 1408 there was an eruption of Etna and deep snow.</P>

<P>The summer of 1406, when the plague raged in London, was close, moist and southerly weather.</P>
<P>In 1411 the dysentery carried off 14000 people in Bour∣deaux, but I have no account of the seasons. The plague ra∣ged in Aquitain and Gascoigne with great mortality. In 1412, there were uncommon tides in the Thames. In 1414 a comet, and in 1416 an eruption of fire from a volcano in Iceland, pre∣ceded by great snow.</P>
<P>In 1421, according to some authors, happened the dreadful inundation in Holland, which formed the Zuyder Sea. In 1422 there was an eruption of fire in Iceland, and a severe winter followed. The same year, the plague raged in Poland. From these phenomena, I suspect the approach of a comet, but have no account of one.</P>
<P>In 1426 a comet, an excessively hot summer, and a violent earthquake which overturned twenty cities in Catalonia, in Spain, and was felt in most parts of Europe. In 1427 the seasons

were rainy, the winter mild, a dearth and famin followed, and the plague in Dantzick. Epidemics prevailed in England, and the year following, the plague.</P>
<P>In 1430 happened a general earthquake—in 1432 a great in∣undation in Germany—in 1433 a comet was visible for three months, in the south, and the winter following was terribly se∣vere. The frost began in the last week in November and lasted till the middle of February.</P>

<P>In 1438 and 9 violent storms and great rains injured the corn and a dearth ensued. A comet in 1439 and a hard winter followed. To these phenomena succeeded in 1440 a series of distressing epidemics, severe coughs, small-pox, fevers and dys∣entery, which proved exceedingly fatal.</P>

<P>In 1443 Bohemia, Hungary, and Poland were terribly in∣jured by an earthquake. In 1444 there was eruption of Etna and Lipari, and the explosion was repeated in 1446 and 7. An epidemic prevailed in 1445, which suddenly ended life, but it is not described. In January 1449 was seen a comet. This year the plague raged in Italy and in 1450 famin and plague. In Milan perished 60,000 people.</P>
<BIBL>Muratori vol. 13. Short vol. 1.</BIBL>
<P>This plague of 1450 is said to have arisen in Asia, and after∣wards spread over Italy, Germany, France and Spain, leaving alive scarcely a third of the human race.</P>
<P>In 1455 appeared a comet and another in 1456. In this lat∣ter year, Italy was violently shaken by an earthquake, and 40,000 people perished.—Pistorius places the earthquake in 1457, and says it demolished 40 towns, and destroyed 60,000 lives. In 1459 a plague began in July and raged six months in Italy.</P>

<P><PB N="146" REF="036687_0150_100AA1A235FF70C8"/>It will be observed, in this period and in many others, that the plague is not mentioned under the year of the earthquake. Modern observations explain the progress of pestilence, which is most usual, viz. measles, catarrh, angina, and other malig∣nant complaints <HI>preceding</HI> the crisis of the pestilential state of air, or plague. And we find almost invariably some of these diseases to be epidemic, even <HI>before</HI> the comet, earthquakes and erup∣tions of volcanoes, altho the most violent form of the pestilence does not always appear till a year or two <HI>after</HI> those phenomena. There is also a difference, in the times of the appearance of the plague in various countries. In Egypt, the pestilence usually ap∣pears first, and is cotemporary with the comet, or nearly so; and the same year, when the plague rages in Egypt, we find an∣ginas and other malignant diseases prevailing in Europe and America, in northern latitudes. This difference in time evin∣ces the power of local causes, in aiding the progress of the epi∣demic constitution of air, and which produce the most violent diseases in Egypt, one, two or three years, previous to their ap∣pearance in cooler latitudes. But it will almost always be found true, that the commencement of a series of epidemics is nearly at the same time in all parts of the world; the precursors of the plague being nearly cotemporary in different countries; altho the pestilential constitution or general contagion arrives to its crisis much sooner in Egypt, Smyrna and Constantinople, than in places less exposed to the influence of local causes of disease.</P>
<P>In 1465 pestilence again appeared in Italy, but I have no particulars. In 1467 a comet, and a <HI>mild winter</HI> is recorded; a remarkable fact, and the second instance I have found in his∣tory. Indeed so uniform are hard winters during the approach of comets, that the accounts of exceptions are to be suspected of inaccuracy in point of time.</P>
<P>In 1468 a most deadly plague raged in Parma of which Short gives a particular description from Rolandus Capellatus.</P>

<P>In 1471 the winter was rigorous and stormy. In 1472 ap∣peared three comets; two of them of distinguished magnitude. In 1473 most excessive heat and drouth, and authors relate that
<PB N="147" REF="036687_0151_100AA1A46E117CD0"/>
the woods took fire by the heat of the sun. This drouth con∣tinued three years—all small rivers were dried up—the Danube was fordable in Hungary. In 1475 and 1476 appeared those enormous swarms of locusts, which always denote a state of air highly pestilential, and ravaged Hungary and Poland. In 1474 earthquakes were felt in Germany. In 1475 an eruption of a volcano in Iceland.</P>
<P>These phenomena, in this period, as usual, introduced most terrible pestilence, which began in 1472 and arrived to its height in 1477. It raged in Italy, Germany, France and England, and how much more extensively, my authorities do not inform me. It prevailed several years, with incredible mortality. In Paris perished 40,000; a large number for the population at that time. In England the number of deaths was not estimated; but authors relate that fifteen years of civil war did not carry off one third of the number. This year 1477 was excessively hot. In 1478 innumerable locusts overran Italy.</P>
<P>In 1478 and 9 the plague in England repeated its ravages; beginning like that of 1348, in autumn, raging through the winter until the next autumn.</P>

<P>The summer of 1485 was excessively rainy, and an inunda∣tion of the Severn made great havoc with men and cattle.</P>
<P>This disease attacked persons suddenly, with a sensation like that of hot vapor running through the part affected. To this succeeded internal heat, unquenchable thirst, and profuse sweat∣ing, which often carried off the patient in two or three hours. The violence of the attack was past in 15 hours, and in 24 hours the patient was considered to be out of danger. It was most fatal to persons in high health and easy condition of life. It was attended with most of the symptoms which characterize the plague—anxiety, restlessness, violent pain in the head, de∣lirium and excessive drowsiness.</P>

<P>This was a pestilential period, for the plague infested Italy and Germany in 1483, and Denmark in 1484. And it will be found on examination, that when the sweating sickness raged in any part of Europe, that or some other pestilential disease, was in other countries. During the prevalence of this form of the plague in England, at this period, Denmark lost nearly one half of its inhabitants by the common plague; which raged ter∣ribly for two years</P>
<P>The author of the Traitè de la Peste, page 23, remarks, "That until the 15th century the plague exhibited the same character; but then "its accidents degenerated," or rather it

reigned a new malady, which, under different external appear∣ances, committed similar destruction on the human body. It did not any longer show itself by buboes, carbuncles and pim∣ples; nor by any of the eruptions which the heat of the viscera pushes out; nor was the skin withered by the parching dryness which accompanies the carbuncular spots; on the other hand, the skin was inundated by torrents of sweat, which seemed to be po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d from the whole body, the viscera were dried, and the heat which dissipated the fluids, seemed to disorder all the laws of the animal economy.</P>
<P>About the middle of the 16th century, the plague resumed its former character, but the symptoms somewhat varied and lighter."</P>
<P>The sweating plague at first attacked none but Englishmen. Even Scotchmen escaped, in foreign countries, where English∣men were seized. Foreigners in England escaped. This how∣ever was on its first invasion in 1485—for, in subsequent years, it spread over other countries. But the fact of its seizing only Englishmen at first, is precisely analagous to what has happened on many other occasions, in other countries. It recurred in England in 1506, 1518, 1528 and 1551.</P>

<P>THE comet of 1500 was followed by an excessively severe winter in 1501, to which succeeded a summer of great heat and drouth in 1502.

A fatal spotted fever overspread Europe in this hot, moist summer. The plague raged in Lisbon and London was severely visited by the sweating disease.</P>

<P>In 1508 a great earthquake convulsed Italy and Germany. In 1509 a shock demolished a part of the walls of Constantino∣ple, with many buildings, and the loss of 13,000 lives: After which the plague almost dispeopled the city.</P>
<P>These events commenced a distressing period. In 1510 there was an erupti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n of Heckla, and universal catarrh or severe influ∣enza in Europe. This was called in France <HI>cocoluche,</HI> from the practice of covering the head of the patient with a cap. It was preceded by a series of moist weather.</P>
<P>In 1511 appeared a comet; another in 1512 and a third in 1513. In 1511 the plague prevailed in Verona, and in 1513 a
<PB N="152" REF="036687_0156_100AA1AF2C4311E8"/>
malignant fever or dysentery, which covered the body with black spots. Bleeding was pernicious; cupping and actual cau∣tery were successful.</P>
<P>In 1514 cats perished by an epidemic pestilential disease, says Fernelius; and the plague was in Tournay; while a mor∣tal distemper raged among the cattle in England.</P>
<P>In 1515 a malignant catarrh or throat distemper in Holland seized persons suddenly, and if not cured, in a few hours, fell on the lungs and terminated in death in one day. In this year and the next appeared comets, and Germany suffered universally by inundations.</P>
<P>To these disasters succeeded a severe winter in 1517, followed by a very hot summer. Corn was in great abundance, but the sweating plague made great havoc in London, and so malignant a murrain raged among cattle, that ravens and dogs which fed on their carcases, swelled and died.</P>
<P>This deadly sweating plague was preceded, in the spring of the year, by an epidemic inflammation of the throat, so virulent as to destroy life in a few hours. The malignity of this disease has rarely, if ever been equalled in modern times. It seems to have been merged in the sweating plague, about midsummer. Authors relate that half the people of England perished with these diseases.—The disease in the throat seems to have been of an inflammatory diathesis, as early bleeding and purging were the only successful remedies.</P>
<P>In 1518 the plag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e visited Lisbon, and the sweating disease prevailed in Brabant.</P>

<P>Pestilential fevers prevailed in 1524 and 5. The mortality in London alarmed the people, and the terms were on that ac∣count, adjourned. In 1527 appeared a comet, and one in each year, for six years in succession. In 1527, the wetness of sum∣mer

<P>In 1528 the spotted fever, that almost infallible precursor or companion of the plague, broke out in all parts of Europe; the plague in Italy, and the sweating disease in London with dread∣ful mortality, terminating in death in six or seven hours. The same disease prevailed in Cork.</P>
<P>In 1529 the sweating disease seized Amsterdam, raging a few days with great mortality, and passing rapidly to other places.</P>
<P>In 1530 was an eruption of Etna, and an earthquake in Lis∣bon demolished 1400 houses. In 1531 was another eruption of Etna, the sweating plague raged in Germany, and pestilence, in some form, was almost universal.—A great hail storm, the same year.</P>

<P>Fracastor informs us that the petechial fever of 1528 was preceded by a mild winter and southerly rainy weather, together with inundations in spring, and unusual darkness. He observes, that appearing in many places, it must have had a common cause.</P>
<BIBL>De Contagione, p. 160.</BIBL>
<P>The last remark is verified by modern observations. The petechial fever is an almost infallible forerunner of the plague in the Levant, in Italy and other countries. It may be laid down as an axiom, on this subject, that altho the appearance of this fever is not <HI>always</HI> and <HI>certainly</HI> followed by the plague, yet that the plague, in most parts of the east, is <HI>always</HI> preceded by a petechial fever.</P>
<P>In 1533 there was a volcanic eruption in South America, but I have no account of the diseases of that year.</P>
<P>In 1534 the plague was in Narbonne.</P>
<P>In 1535 there was a terrible plague in Cork.</P>
<P>In 1538 appeared a comet, which was preceded by eruptions of Etna in 1536 and 7 and a hard winter. In 1539 another comet and in 1541 a third.</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="036687_0158_100AA1B364C17068"/>In 1538 a mortal dysentery raged all over Europe, as also in the following year. The preceding summer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had been moist, and an acute fever, with violent pain about the heart, delirium, moist and black tongue, anthraces and buboes, had been epi∣demic. But Fernilius remarks that the unusual dysentery of 1538 and 9 could not be ascribed to any visible cause in the seasons.</P>
<P>In 1538 also was a violent earthquake at Puteoli, near Na∣ples and Vesuvius, where there was an immense eruption of fire. This year the plague raged in Constantinople, and in 1539 was still more destructive.</P>
<P>In 1539 the drouth in Ireland was excessive—and nearly dried up the river Lee at Cork.</P>
<P>In 1540 there was a terrible drouth. In England a pestilen∣tial ague and a dysentery were epidemic and mortal. Another eruption of Etna happened this year, and the next year a comet.</P>

<P>In 1541 the plague raged in Constantinople.</P>
<P>The year 1543 was very wet and cold, and a great mortality among cattle. In 1542 the plague was in Geneva. In 1543 it raged in London in winter. In 1545 there was an eruption of Etna. The plague again raged in Geneva, and all over Eu∣rope a pestilential epidemic, called the Troup Gallant, which seized chiefly the young and robust, with a mortality nearly equal to that of the true plague, of which it seems to have been the precursor. Patients had a violent pain in the head, heat in the kidneys, universal lassitude, continual watchings ending in frenzy, or drowziness ending in lethargy; and worms rising into the throat, with danger of suffocation. Bleeding was the only remedy; then detergents and cordials. The disease terminated on the 4th or 11th day. Charles, duke of Orleans, died of this disease at a monastery in Abbeville.</P>
<P>In 1547 the plague prevailed in most parts of Europe, as in Ireland and in Germany; and in 1548 in London. Here my labors begin to receive aid from that accurate and elegant histo∣rian Thuanus, who, in lib. 4, describes the disease as it prevail∣ed in Saxony. "Such was its violence that all other distem∣pers gave way to it or ran into it. Most of the soldiers in the

Emperor's army were seized. They experienced a most intole∣rable pain from the heat of the head; the eyes were swelled and fiery; the tongue bloody; respiration difficult and breath fetid; vomitings of bilious matters frequent; finally the body became livid, with pimples here and there scattered over it, which bred worms. Death took place the second or third day."</P>

<P>This pestilential period was long and severe. In 1548 the plague was in London. A contagious peripneumony prevailed over Europe, with spitting of blood and difficulty of breathing. In 1549 the plague prevailed in Prussia and Portugal.</P>
<P>In 1550 a comet in March, and the same year an eruption of Etna and Lipari. The summer was very rainy and the win∣ter dry. In 1551 the earth was deluged with rain, and infinite damage was done by floods. The catarrh was epidemic in France. An epidemic pestilential fever raged all over Europe, and the sweating sickness in London. The plague followed in various parts of Europe. In 1552 it raged in Misena, and the patient discharged blood by the pores for three days before death. In 1553 the same distemper raged in Paris, with extreme mor∣tality, and to appease the wrath of heaven, many heretics were burnt.</P>
<P>At the same time, pestilence spread over Hungary and Tran∣sylvania for two years and suspended the operations of war. This year also there was an earthquake from the Elbe to Saxony.</P>

<P>In 1554 there was an eruption of fire in Iceland and in the same year appeared a comet. In 1555 the summer was exces∣sively rainy, and fevers were very mortal in England and France.</P>
<P>In 1556 a comet and a drouth; the fevers of the last season raged with augmented violence; as also the spotted fever and confluent malignant small pox.</P>
<P>This year there was an eruption of Etna, and in China a large district of country was sunk by an earthquake, with all its inhabitants, and became a Lake. These phenomena indicated
<PB N="156" REF="036687_0160_100AA1B6F6B74360"/>
a great disorder in the elements and introduced most deadly epi∣demics.</P>
<P>In 1557 a comet; an inundation of the Tyber; and a vio∣lent catarrh was almost universal. The cough was severe, and pain in the side, difficulty of breathing and fever attended. In general bleeding the first or second day was successful; but in a small town near Madrid, bleeding was fatal, and 2000 patients died after venesection.</P>
<P>In Alemar this epidemic assumed the form of a sore throat; 2000 persons were seized almost instantly in October, of whom 200 died. Forestus ascribes it to a vapor, for it was preceded by thick clouds of an ill smell.</P>
<P>In 1556 the plague raged in Vienna.</P>
<P>In 1557 a violent plague broke out in a small inland village between Delph and the Hague in Holland—an instance of its origination at a distance from a sea-port; and it spread over the country, in June. This disease was preceded by meteors in the air, and attended with abortions. Such was the mortality, that the poor fought for coffins for their dead relations. In Delph only, died 5000 of the poor. It continued through the winter to May 1558.</P>
<P>In the same summer pestilential fevers raged with great mor∣tality in France, Holland and other countries.</P>
<P>In de Thou's history of his own times, vol. 2. 227, we have an account of the spotted, or petechial fever, which appeared in Spain in 1557, which was nearly as mortal as the inguinal plague. He calls it a "new disease" and unknown to the an∣cients. The spots differed from the florid pimples of the purple fever. It was putrid, malignant and much resembling the plague, but "did not carry so pestilent a contagiousness." It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as called in Spain the "puncticular disease." Innumerable people perished by it that year. The same fever in Florence "was succeeded by a violent plague," which had raged on the Tuscan coast.</P>
<P>In 1558 appeared a comet. The summer was excessively hot and the winter very cold. Dysenteries raged in France, and in Holland semitertians, which affe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed principally the rich,

<P>Violent tempests and inundations are mentioned, this year and the last. In 1558 died Charles V. emperor of Germany.</P>

<P>In 1560 a comet, and a dearth of corn in England.</P>
<P>In 1562 and 3 the plague spread over Europe. It broke out in 1562 among the English soldiers, who were sent to garrison New-Haven in France. The next year it raged in London and carried off 20,000 of its inhabitants. Authors say, the sold∣iers from New-Haven introduced it into London; but who in∣troduced it into New-Haven, we are not informed.</P>
<P>The truth is, this terrible disease appeared in most parts of Europe about the same time. In Frankfort, Nuremberg, Mag∣deburgh, Hamburgh, Dantzick, and in the vandalic maritime towns, Wismar, Lubick, Rostock and others, perished by com∣putation 300,000 persons in the year 1563.—This disease also raged in winter, for Thuanus mentions the death of Castalion, a literary character of that age, by the plague at Basle in January.</P>
<P>This year was remarkable also for earthquakes. In Sept. was a violent one in England, especially in Lincoln and other northern parts. In January the river Thames was agitated by preternatural fluxes of the tides, which forced back the natural tides, three times. In winter, severe cold rendered that river passable as a highway.</P>
<P>The same year earthquakes were felt in Illyrica, and Dalma∣tia, and Catana suffered a great loss of lives.</P>
<P>In 1564 a comet appeared, and remarkable northern lights, or meteors, and a destructive inundation of the Thames.</P>

<P>In 1566 the spring was rainy and the harvest dry. The Hungarian fever broke out in the Emperor Maximilian's army, and as authors affirm, the soldiers, when disbanded, spread it all over Europe, with great mortality. This disease invaded the patient at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, with slight cold and shiver∣ering for about fifteen minutes. This was followed by intense heat, and intolerable pain in the head, mouth and stomach, so that the slightest touch of the bed clothes, made the sick utter shrieks: The pain in the mouth and stomach being the pathog∣nomonic symptoms of the disease.—The thirst was unquencha∣ble, and a longing for wine, which was fatal, if taken. The tongue was dry and lips chopt. Delirium came on the third day. A critical looseness and deafness were favorable—Swel∣lings behind the ears were frequent. The most miserable crisis was, tubercles on the top of the foot, which, if neglected, ended in mortification. Many suffered amputation. Spots, like flea bites, appeared on the body, and if livid or black, they were fatal symptoms. Copious bleeding, on the first seizure, was, of all remedies, the most successful.</P>
<BIBL>Skenkius' p. 770. Short vol. 1.</BIBL>
<P>In the year 1567 was an eruption of Etna, and in Tercera, one of the Azores, fire burst from a lake on the top of a hill, and the water released from its bed, rushed down and swept away part of a settlement below. In 1568 a spotted fever raged in Paris, in which prostration of strength rendered bleeding fatal. The winter of 1567 was very severe, and the summer excessively dry.</P>
<P>In 1569 appeared a comet.—The spotted fever in this year became epidemic in Europe, raging for three years with great destruction. The plague was in London. Short remarks that this spotted fever "in several places turned to the plague, and where the plague raged, it turned to this fever."—Indeed this spotted fever was a milder form of the pestilence, raging as it

usually does, for some time, <HI>before</HI> the glandular plague appears. In this period, it was the herald to announce one of the most general plagues that Europe ever knew. The petechial fever prevailed principally from 1569 to 1574, interspersed with the real plague, in a few places; and the real pestis followed it, with mortal rage, and prevailed for three or four years.</P>
<P>In 1570 a most dreadful earthquake in Chili, S. America, destroyed many villages and buried the inhabitants in their ruins. This is the first occasion I have of introducing America in this history.</P>
<BIBL>Ulloa b. 8. ch. 7.</BIBL>
<P>Thuanus, whose authority is very respectable, and who was cotemporary with this period, relates that in 1570 the dikes in Holland were broken by a swell of the ocean, and that 400,000 people were overwhelmed in the floods. He says further that similar phenomena were observed, that year, in different places over the whole world. Reggio, Florence, Venice and Modena felt severe shocks of earthquake in 1571, and Ferara was laid in ruins.</P>
<P>The summers of 1570 and 71 were moist and warm; and in gene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al the seasons were similar for the two succeeding years. The winters were rigorous. Fluxes, measles, worms and semi∣tertians were epidemic in many places. In 1572 appeared a comet or new star, very bright and clear, larger than Jupiter, in the constellation of Cassiopeia, behind her chair. It was stationary for 16 months and by degrees evanished. The winter succeding was remarkable for hard frost and deep snow. The author of Observations de Physique et de Medicine, says, that all maladies in France in 1572 turned to epilepsy and palsy.</P>
<P>This year the plague raged in Poland; and at Basle a malig∣nant fever, chiefly fatal to men of robust constitution.</P>
<P>In 1574 the petechial fever, which had spread mortality over Europe, especially in Italy and Spain, began to change into the usual form of the plague. This disease made its appearance in London, in a small degree, in October and November of this year.</P>
<P>In 1575 the plague appeared in many parts of Europe, and
<PB N="160" REF="036687_0164_100AA1BF47ED5F88"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ged with incredible mortality for three years. It was reported in Italy to have been <HI>imported</HI> into Verona and Venice, from Trent. Such was the current vulgar opinion. But men of sci∣ence hold the disease to be generated in cities from the <HI>filthiness of private dwellings,</HI> and not to be produced by the position of the stars or malignant constitution of the air.</P>
<P>The truth was, the disease in Italy first appeared in Trent, an <HI>inland town, far from the sea</HI>—another instance in which the advocates of importation from Africa or the Levant are silenced. Philosophy disdains to look abroad for the cause of an epidemic, when the strongest of all causes exist in the place. Trent is situated in a valley, on the bank of the Adige, a river which often overflows the adjacent low lands; and after the flood re∣cedes, the place is sometimes so sickly that the people are com∣pelled to retire to the neighboring hills. Strong local causes therefore account for the <HI>first</HI> appearance of the plague in that city. The general contagion of the atmosphere, which had produced spotted fevers and other deadly diseases all over Eu∣rope for four years preceding, was aided by the local unhealthi∣ness of Trent, and here appeared first, the crisis of the pesti∣lence, or plague. See the description of that country in Zim∣merman on Air.</P>
<P>The disease almost depopulated Trent in 1575, and became mortal in the neighboring Venetian territories. This mortality however was only the forerunner of greater evils. The disease indeed subsided in winter, and the people supposed its violence to be past. They might have known otherwise, had they atten∣ded to the <HI>progressiveness</HI> of the malady, and the certain indi∣cations of its increase.</P>
<P>In 1576 the disease appeared in Venice; and as it carried off a few people at first, in scattered situations, opinions were, as usual in all such cases, divided as to the nature of the distem∣per. In this state of the public mind, two eminent physicians, Mercuriale of Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>li, and Capavacca of Padua, undertook to assert the disease not to be pestilential. The senate, observing the controversy among the Venetian physicians, as to the nature of the distemper, listened to the two foreigners, who declared
<PB N="161" REF="036687_0165_100AA1C1615C40B0"/>
they could cure it, and put a stop to the removal of the diseased from the city. By this means, says the historian, the distemper was obviously increased; and it raged with terrible fury, till it carried off 70,000 of the citizens, with fifty-seven valuable physicians and surgeons. The two foreign physicians were dis∣missed, with applauses for having preferred the good of Venice to their personal safety.</P>
<P>This account from Thuanus deserves particular notice. We here see the same doubts about the nature of the disease on its first appearance, which prevail in all similar cases—as in Mar∣seilles in 1720—in London in 1665—and in America, with respect to the yellow fever, which is only another form of plague. The source of all these doubts and controversies, which have so often embarrassed the citizens and disgraced the faculty, is, the <HI>progressiveness</HI> of the pestilence. The malignant diseases preceding, slide into the glandular plague so gradually, that phy∣sicians themselves do not know precisely when the distemper should lose the name of <HI>malignant fever</HI> and take that of <HI>plague.</HI> Sydenham honestly confesses that, in 1665, he did not know whether the malignant disease which appeared in May and be∣came epidemic, just before the plague, was the real plague or not. And the truth is, that the disease often assails people, in a few scattering cases, at the beginning of a plague, with a mor∣tality equal to the true pestis, and <HI>without</HI> the distinctive marks of plague, the glandular tumors.</P>
<P>These facts will hereafter, with careful observation, obviate all controversies at the beginning of pestilential diseases; and they will decide infallibly all questions relative to the domestic or foreign origin of such maladies.</P>
<P>This pestilence was severely felt in Padua, Milan, Cremona and Pavia. Vicenza, which escaped this year, was visited the next, with equal severity.</P>
<P>Dr. Mead is puzzled to know why Vicenza, which lies be∣tween Verona and Padua, should escape the plague, in the year when both those cities were infested; and yet the next year, should suffer equally with her neighbors, when <HI>they</HI> were exempt from the calamity. He finds some difficulty in accounting for
<PB N="162" REF="036687_0166_100AA1C3E710E290"/>
the conveyance of the <HI>infection</HI> from one to another, without communicating it to the intervening city. This subject will be considered in a subsequent section; I will only here remark, that nothing is so fatal to truth and science, as for a man of popular talents to espouse an erroneous theory, and then strive to bend facts to its support.</P>

<P>In 1575 multitudes of flies and beetles were found in Eng∣land, and in 1576 an earthquake was experienced.</P>

<P>In the great pestilence of the preceding ten years, not only Europe, but Asia was laid waste. So general and severe was the disease that the operations of war, in the Turkish empire, were suspended. Messina in Sicily lost 40,000 inhabitants—and Europe must have lost in ten years, by the pestilence under the various forms it assumed, one third, or more probably one half her people.</P>
<P>In this period we see all the extraordinary operations of nature united. Comets, earthquakes, in Europe and S. America tem∣pests, volcanoes, unusual animals, excessive floods from rain or an extraordinary intumescence of the ocean all mark an extreme agit∣ation or disorder of the elements.—The vast comet of 1577, the year when the plague was at its height, was calculated to ap∣proach within 840,000 miles of the earth. Upon the Newton∣ian principles of the power of attraction, the influence of that body on the earth must have been prodigious.</P>

<P>In this year appeared in Moravia a new disease, evidently dis∣tinct in its symptoms from any known malady, and which Thu∣anus has described.</P>
<P>This also was the year in which a sudden disease seized the court and attendants at the Oxford assizes in England. Early in July, while the court was sitting, "there arose, says Stowe, amidst the people such a damp that almost all were smothered—
<PB N="163" REF="036687_0167_100AA1C6E1356B48"/>
very few escaped, that were not taken at that instant. The ju∣rors died presently—after which Robert Bell, Lord Chief Ba∣ron. There died in Oxford 300 persons—and sickened there, but died elsewhere, more than 200 from the 6th to the 12th of July. After which died not one of that sickness, for one of them infected not another, nor died thereof any one woman or child."</P>
<BIBL>Chronicle, p. 681.</BIBL>
<P>This sudden catastrophe is ascribed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o a damp or vapor. But there is no need of resorting to such a cause. The atmosphere, during the period under consideration, was not furnished with the power of supporting animal life, in as ample a manner as it usually is.—This is evident, from the universality of mortal epi∣demics. In this state of the atmosphere, a multitude, crouded into a court room, in the hot month of July, must speedily des∣troy all the respirable air, and death must ensue. That the prin∣cipal cause was not only local, but sudden, is demonstrated by the circumstance, that no infection accompanied the diseased. Had the cause of their illness been long in operation, it would have produced in the body that species of poison, which is nox∣ious to persons in health. Persons, suddenly deprived of life, as by damps in wells or the fumes of charcoal, communicate no infection.</P>
<P>It is suggested by some writers, that this disease was occasion∣ed by an infected prisoner, who was brought from jail into court; but Stowe does not mention this circumstance. And it is possible the catastrophe might have been owing to a sudden discharge of mephitic vapor.</P>
<P>Scarcely had the last period of pestilence come to a close, when another series of maladies succeeded, and nearly in the or∣der of those last described.</P>
<P>In 1580 appeared a comet on the 10th of October which was visible for two months. The preceding summer was very moist and rainy, and about the rising of the dog-star, came on a cold dry north wind. In June began an epidemic catarrh in Sicily, which spread over Europe. In July, it was in Italy; in Au∣gust, in Venice and Constantinople; in September, it extended over Hungary, Bohemia and Saxony; in October, on the Bal∣tic;
<PB N="164" REF="036687_0168_100AA1C86CAF0E70"/>
in November, in Norway and in December, in Sweden, Poland and Russia.—Its symptoms were nearly the same, as in this country, but the disease was more violent and fatal.—In Rome, died of it 4000 people—in Lubec, 8000; at Ham∣burgh, 3000; and multitudes in other places. It appears to have been attended with more fever than in ordinary cases—The fever was continual for four or five days, with a pain in the head, straitness of the breast and cough—it terminated in profuse sweating.—In general bleeding and purging were found to be prejudicial.</P>
<BIBL>Riverius, lib. 17.</BIBL>
<P>In this year and about the time, when the catarrh had over∣spread Europe, broke out in Grand Cairo, one of the most des∣olating plagues ever known. Prosper Alpinus, who lived in that age, reports the number of deaths, from November 1580, to July 1581 to have been 500,000. It will be found on ex∣amination that the plague, in a series of pestilential and epidemic diseases, appears in Egypt, <HI>before</HI> it does in Europe and Amer∣ica, and is nearly cotemporary with the catarrh, angina or other precursor of the pestilence in more northern latitudes. This fact deserves notice. The plague which followed the catarrh in Europe, did not appear in many places, perhaps in none except in France, in the year 1580.—In northern latitudes, the malig∣nity of the epidemic constitution does not appear, till the second or third year, after its commencement in catarrh or measles.</P>
<P>In Paris however the plague raged in 1580, the same year it appeared in Egypt, and carried off 40,000 people, mostly of the poorer sort; and at the same time, it prevailed in many of the neighboring towns, especially, says Thuanus, "at Laon in Vermandois, which city is in a position exposed to a hot sun, in which died 6000."</P>
<P>The historian further remarks, that the "crops that year were plentiful, and the sky serene; so that it was thought the disease was produced rather by the influence of the stars, ab astrorum impressione, than by the malignity of a corrupt air." This is another proof that a state of air, as described by Hip∣pocrates, is not always the cause of pestilence.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="036687_0169_100AA1CCA6F24A88"/>Altho this malady broke out in France in 1580, yet it had been preceeded by the catarrh. The historian remarks, that the catarrh was not so much dreaded for its mortality, tho many died of it, as for the astonishing rapidity with which the contagion spread from place to place. It seized the lower spine of the back with a chill, <HI>horrore;</HI> to this succeeded <HI>gravedo,</HI> a dull pain in the head; and universal languor or debility, resolvens membra, loosening or unhinging the joints. If the crisis was not favora∣ble in five days, the disease terminated in a fatal fever.</P>

<P>In 1580 considerable earthquakes were felt in Belgium, at Cologne and about the Mediterranean. The same shocks were felt in various parts of England, but Short places them under the following year. The German sea was agitated, and a great swel∣ling of its waters was observed.</P>
<BIBL>See Thuanus, lib. 71, 72. Short, vol. 1. p. 260.</BIBL>
<P>In 1580 also, the marshes in Essex, and some parts of Kent in England, were laid waste by mice, which were so numerous as to destroy the herbage, and a murrain among cattle succeeded.</P>
<P>In this year was issued a proclamation of Queen Elizabeth, upon the representation of the Mayor and Aldermen of Lon∣don, prohibiting any new house to be built within three miles of the gates of the city, and more than one family to reside in a house. The reasons assigned for the prohibition are connected with this subject. The increase of London had long been con∣sidered as an evil, by swelling the head too large for the body, and several attempts had been made to restrain the increase. The resort of people to the city from the country was held to be prejudical to agriculture.</P>
<P>But the proclamation states further, that "such great multi∣tudes of people, brought to inhabit in small rooms, whereof a great part are very poor, yea such as must live by begging, or by worse means, and they heaped together, and in a sort, smoth∣ered with many families of children and servants, in one house or small tenement, it must needs follow, if any plague or popu∣lar sickness should, by God's permission, enter amongst those multitudes, that the same would not only spread itself, and invade

the whole city and confines, but a great mortality would ensue the same, and the infection be dispersed through all other parts of the realm."</P>
<P>In this paper, we observe some powerful causes of pestilence in London to be explained—and events showed how little good was done by the interference of authority with private rights, and an attempt to check, by positive prohibitions, the natural growth of towns. This proclamation, like all which had pre∣ceded it, was useless. The city increased, and the plague con∣tinued to ravage it, until the good providence of God arrested the evil, by a general conflagration, and men had become wise enough, to build large, airy houses, and keep them clean.</P>
<BIBL>Maitland's History of London.</BIBL>
<P>In 1582 a remarkable te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pest is mentioned, and a comet in May. A severe earthquake was felt in South-America, and a small city near Lima was destroyed.</P>
<BIBL>Ulloa's Voyage, vol. 2. b. 7.</BIBL>
<P>In 1583 several concussions of the earth were experienced in England, and the plague appeared in London. At the same time it appeared in Germany or Holland; as Diemerbroeck mentions this as a pestilential year. The following winter was severe. In Rome there was a famin.</P>
<BIBL>Maitland's Hist. Lond. Short, vol. 1.</BIBL>
<P>In 1585 in spring appeared very malignant pleurisies. In 1586 Thrace was overrun with locusts, and the plague raged in Hungary, Austria and Turkey. A comet appeared in each of these years, and in 1586 Lima in South-America was nearly ruined by an earthquake. See Ulloa, from whom my accounts of earthquakes in Spanish America, are all taken.</P>
<P>In 1587 a very cold spring, but a plentiful year in most coun∣tries. The plague raged in Flanders, which was almost depopu∣lated by disease, war and famin. In some parts, the wild beasts took possession of the houses. Dogs ran mad, and did no small mischief, and fields were covered with weeds and bushes. The catarrh appeared in England, this year, but how extensively, I am not informed. An eruption of fire in Iceland is recorded under the same year.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="036687_0171_100AA1D092CC60C0"/>In 1589 the English fleet, returned from <HI>Portugal,</HI> with the <HI>Hungarian</HI> fever, says Short, and introduced it into England. What an influence have <HI>names,</HI> and what mischief is done by ignorance and false philosophy! The Hungarian fever! As tho this fever had been a native of a particular soil, and transplanted from country to country, like a fruit-tree. Names are not al∣ways harmless. The name, Sudor <HI>Anglicus,</HI> given to the sweat∣ing plague, because it appeared first in England and was at first peculiar to Englishmen, has led the moderns to suppose, the dis∣ease to have been limited to England or to Englishmen, altho it repeatedly spread over all Europe. In the same way, the insect which injures wheat in America, was ignorantly called the Hes∣sian fly, and altho the animal was never known in Germany, yet people believe, that, like yellow fever, it <HI>was imported.</HI> It is thus that ignorance gives currency to an improper name, and the name in turn assists to propagate and perpetuate an error.</P>
<P>The truth, in regard to diseases, is, that they often assume peculiar symptoms; such as are not usual. These are not prop∣erly <HI>new</HI> diseases, but modifications of common fever, proceed∣ing from the infinite variety of that cause of sickness, which I denominate general contagion, and which Sydenham called the Epidemic Constitution of the air. This or other causes are per∣petually diversifying the symptoms of diseases; so that physicians are often at a loss whether to call a disease by an old or new name. Wherever the peculiar causes <HI>first</HI> exist, there will the peculiar symptoms of disease first appear—and when similar causes exist in other places, the same symptoms will attend the disease.</P>
<P>In 1590 multitudes of people perished by famin. A comet approached the system, the winter was cold, a violent earth∣quake convulsed Hungary, Bohemia and Vienna; near the lat∣ter place, the earth emitted an offensive smell. The drouth was extreme. The Azores were shaken by an earthquake, and a tempest in September threatened to overwhelm them in mass.</P>
<P>In 1591 universal catarrh in Europe was a prelude to most destructive pestilence. It is singular also that the plague broke out in Narva and Revel, in Livonia, on the gulf of Finland, in the 59th degree of latitude, and raged through the succeeding
<PB N="168" REF="036687_0172_100AA1D21B081EC8"/>
cold winter. Six thousand persons perished in Revel. As to its origin, the great Thuanus could not decide whether it was "a belli incommoditatibus, sive caeli inclementia," from the dis∣tresses of war, or intemperature of the air. There could have been no suspicion of a foreign origin.</P>
<BIBL>Thuanus, lib. 100.</BIBL>
<P>Cotemporary with the catarrh was a malignant spotted fever in Trent. A distressing famin caused a great mortality in Italy.</P>
<P>In 1591 the plague began to show itself in Italy, but attended with peculiar symptoms. A fever, little infectious, seized the head, inducing delirium, and in many patients, was attended with fluxes and flatulent bowels. It terminated fatally on the tenth day. The remedy was bleeding "Secta vena capitis, quae in brachio est, aliisque a capite manantibus," says Thuanus. It attacked chiefly men between the ages of 30 and 50; but was fatal to few women. It raged in Umbria, Tuscany, Romagne and Lombardy, sweeping away, in some towns, almost every man. From August to August, it was computed that 60,000 persons perished.</P>
<BIBL>Thuanus, lib. 102.</BIBL>
<P>In 1592 the petechial fever spread over Florence, with a ma∣lignity that entitled it to the name of plague. It was most fatal to the nobles.</P>
<P>In England the drouth in this and the former summer was extreme. The Thames was fordable at London. The plague appeared in Shropshire in the west, and carried off 18,000 cit∣izens in London. Persia suffered much by an earthquake in the same year.</P>

<P>In the same year a furious pestilence prevailed in Candia. It appeared in spring, increased till July and then abated. On its first appearance, all infected and suspected persons were removed to a distant hospital, but without effect. The disease continued to spread—a proof that it was an epidemic. In September, it was supposed to be extinguished; but in October, it broke out with fresh violence, and the diseased were confined to their houses—a useless and pernicious regulation. The city lost 20,000 inhabitants.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="036687_0173_100AA1D5D11B5948"/>In 1594 was a severe winter. The years 1594, 5 and 6 were very rainy in England and Germany. Crops failed, and in Hungary, the famin was extreme.</P>
<P>In 1596 appeared a comet. Violent earthquakes shook dif∣ferent countries, and several cities in Japan were swallowed up.</P>
<P>In 1596 and 7 prevailed in Cologne, Westphalia and other parts of Germany, a singular disease, which authors ascribe to the famin which had preceded. It was a malignant fever, which was attended with convulsions and raving madness, or delirium. Sometimes the convulsions were attended with little or no fever. The patient was contracted into a knot or ball by the violence of the convulsions, or extended to full length, like a dead body— sometimes the extension of the body was succeeded by a con∣traction in the same paroxism. The particulars respecting this disease do not fall within the plan of this history, but may be found in Short, vol. 1.</P>
<P>In 1597 appeared a comet, and the same year the catarrh was again epidemic. Malignant fevers, accompanied with worms in youth, were predominant also, and the plague was in Juliers and Geneva. A dearth in England. The winter of 1597 was se∣vere, as was that of 1599.</P>
<P>The summers of 1598 and 99 were remarkably dry, and swarms of fleas, gnats and flies abounded. Tertians, with pe∣techiae, were frequent, and continual fevers which yielded to bleeding and purging, or went off with a bilious diarrhea.— Small-pox and measles were also epidemic.</P>
<P>These diseases, as usual, were the precursors of a very dis∣tressing plague, which, in the autumn of 1598, raged in Lon∣don, Litchfield, Leicester and other places in England. It even broke out in the small towns in Wales and the northern counties, as in Kendal in Cumberland, where died 2500—in Richmond, where died 2200—at Carlisle which lost 1196 in∣habitants; and at Percrith which lost 2266.</P>

<P>In 1598 Pegu, in Asia, was depopulated by famin, and Con∣stantinople was almost stripped of its inhabitants by the plague.

<HEAD>SECTION VI. Historical view of Pestilential Epidemics from the year <HI>1600</HI> to the close of the year <HI>1700.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE year 1600 was remarkable for pestilence in almost every part of Europe. Spain, where the disease was fatal the year before, was this year almost depopulated. There raged throughout Europe, a pestilential, mortal cholic which destroyed the lives of all whom it seized, within four days. The patient, as soon as he was seized, became senseless—the hair fell from his head—a livid pustule arose on the nose, which consumed it— the extremities became cold and mortified.</P>
<P>In Florence a terrible earthquake destroyed many buildings.</P>
<P>The winter of 1600 was very cold. In the summer of 160<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there was a severe drouth of four or five months; and a violent dysentery followed, with double tertians and continual fevers. The plague raged in Portugal, attended with black round worms. At Christmas, there was an earthquake in England. The same year there was an earthquake at Arequipa, in Peru, accompa∣nied by an eruption of a volcano.</P>
<P>In 1602 a cold and dry summer and winter, the catarrh was epidemic, and acute fevers prevalent. These diseases and phe∣nomena accompanied a series of calamities in all parts of Europe.</P>
<P>The famin that marked this period, for a series of years, ex∣ceeded in extent and severity, what had been before recorded. Famins are usually local; but in the present instance, there was a failure of crops for several years, in almost every part of Eu∣rope; while the plague committed most desolating ravages.</P>
<P>In Muscovy the famin raged for three years at the beginning of the century under consideration, attended with the plague. Parents devoured their dying children; cats, rats and every un∣clean
<PB N="172" REF="036687_0176_100AA1DBBB288FD0"/>
thing was used to sustain life. All the ties of nature and morality were disregarded; human flesh was exposed to sale in the open market. The more powerful seized their neighbors; fathers and mothers, their children; husbands, their wives, and offered them for sale. Multitudes of dead were found, with their mouths filled with straw, and the most filthy substances. Five hundred thousand persons were supposed to perish in Mus∣covy, by famin and pestilence.</P>
<P>At the same time, the famin in Livonia, and the cold winter of 1602, destroyed 30,000 lives. The dead bodies lay in the streets, for want of hands to bury them.</P>
<BIBL>Thuanus, lib. 135. Encyclopedia, art. Russia.</BIBL>
<P>At the same time, raged a most dreadful pestilence in Con∣stantinople, which also followed a famin.</P>
<P>In England, there was also a dearth, and in 1603 perished 36,000 in London, of the plague, which was said to be imported from Ostend.</P>
<BIBL>Maitland's Hist. Lond. Mignot's Hist Turkish Empire, p. 256.</BIBL>
<P>Even in this case, the report of imported infection into Lon∣don was believed, altho the nation had before their eyes, a de∣monstration to the contrary; for the same malady broke out in every part of the kingdom, and had actually prevailed in Chester, in the north-west corner of England, the year preceding.</P>
<P>It is idle to ascribe the plague to infection, communicated from person to person, or from clothes to persons. The disease, in 1602 was in every part of Europe, and appeared nearly at the same time, in the most distant parts. In this case, as in those before related, of 1580 and 1591, it had been preceded by catarrh, and a course of malignant fevers. The malignity of the disease in 1602 resembled that of 1348—persons were seized with spitting of blood, and died in three days.</P>
<P>In August 1603 in Paris died 2000 persons weekly of the plague. This disease was attributed to the diet and filth accu∣mulated, under a defective police.</P>
<BIBL>Wraxall, vol. 3. 438.</BIBL>
<P>Why the filth of Paris did not produce the plague in other seasons, writers have not informed us.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="036687_0177_100AA1DEE28D7580"/>The period under consideration was remarkable for the uni∣versality of the action of subterranean fire. The earthquakes of 1600 and 1601 and the bursting of a volcano in South-A∣merica have been mentioned. In 1603 there was an explosion of Etna. In 1604 a second eruption in Peru, and a comet.</P>
<P>The plague abated, in some places, the year following; but London was not free from it for a number of years, and from 1606 to 1609 inclusive the distemper carried off from two to four thousand citizens in each season.</P>
<P>In 1607 commenced an unusual concurrence of great agitations in the elements, and severe pestilence attended.</P>
<P>In this year appeared a comet, and another in 1609. The winter of 1607-8 was the severest that had been known for an age; boats were built on the Thames. And here for the first time, I am able to introduce North-America, into this history; from which will be derived some of the most important evidence in regard to the universality of the causes of pestilential epidemics.</P>
<P>The severity of the winter mentioned was equally great in America, as in Europe. George Popham, and a company of settlers under the patent of king James, to the London mer∣chants, attempted a settlement at Sagadahoc in 1607; but Pop∣ham, the President, died during the winter, and the extreme cold was one of the discouragements that contributed to break up the settlement.</P>
<BIBL>Gorges Hist. New-England. Purchas, vol. 4. 1637. Hutchinson's Hist. Mass. vol. 1. 2.</BIBL>
<P>In this same year was an eruption of Etna.</P>
<P>The comet of this year produced a most remarkable tempest, with a swell of the ocean, that did incredible damage in Eng∣land. In the latter part of winter, the tempest brought in a flood into the Severn, which overflowed the country, near Bristol, to the extent of ten miles, with a rapidity, that left no time for the people to save their effects, and many lives were lost. The flood rose above the houses, where people had re∣sorted for safety, and overwhelmed them. The loss of cattle and goods was immense.</P>
<P>In Somersetshire, the inundation laid waste an extent of 20 miles by 10; overwhelming five towns. So sudden was the
<PB N="174" REF="036687_0178_100AA1E1CDAF7AA0"/>
irruption, that laborers were caught in the fields, and were seen floating on the timbers of their houses. In Norfolk, the inun∣dation was not less destructive.</P>
<BIBL>Thuanus, lib. 138.</BIBL>
<P>In 1608 a very malignant dysentery prevailed.</P>
<P>In 1609 the approach of the second comet produced effects equally remarkable with the last. The action of subterranean fire was extensive. There was an eruption of Etna, and a vio∣lent earthquake at Lima in Peru. The winter was so severe, as to convert the Thames into a common highway.</P>
<P>In this year the plague was augmented in London; and it raged in Alemar and Denmark. In the years 1607 and 8, it had been very mortal in Cork.</P>
<P>The pestilential state of air, at this time, was experienced at sea. The people on board the fleet under Sir Thomas Gates and Sir George Somers, bound to Virginia, were seized with the calenture, a spotted pestilent fever, which, on board of one of the ships, was so malignant as to be called the plague. Thir∣ty-two dead bodies were thrown out of two ships. Was this disease imported? In the same passage, the fleet met with a tre∣mendous storm of four days continuance, and Sir T. Gates was shipwrecked on Bermuda.</P>
<BIBL>Purchas, vol. 4. p. 1733.</BIBL>
<P>In 1610 the catarrh was again epidemic. In some parts of the continent prevailed the Hungarian fever like the plague, and severe bilious complaints. A remarkable fiery bow in the heav∣ens was observed in Hungary; and Constantinople was infested with clouds of grass-hoppers, of great size, that devoured every green thing. The malignant sore throat was fatal in Spain, and authors relate that this was its first appearance in that coun∣try.</P>
<P>In 1611 the plague carried off 200,000 of the inhabitants of Constantinople. It appeared also in some other places. The summers of the three last years were very hot and dry.</P>
<P>In 1612 appeared a comet. A terrible tempest made great havoc with shipping—2000 dead bodies of sailors were found on the coast of England, and 1200 on that of Holland. Some towns were injured. In the following year, Provence in France
<PB N="175" REF="036687_0179_100AA1E373A0CC00"/>
was greatly injured by an inundation; and swarms of locusts succeeded, which laid waste the vegetable kingdom.</P>
<P>The summer of 1612 in England was excessively dry, and a malignant fever severely afflicted the nation.</P>
<P>In 1613 the plague appeared in detached parts of France, and in Montpelier, a malignant disease so fatal, as to want only the buboes, to prove it the true plague. It was marked with red and livid spots, swellings behind the ears and carbuncles. One third who were seized died.</P>
<BIBL>Riverius, lib. 17.</BIBL>
<P>The preceding summers, the earth was covered with grass∣hoppers, and the air filled with clouds of flies.</P>
<P>In this year also Constantinople was ravaged with the plague; and as cats were supposed to spread the infection, the physicians, who were mostly Jews, advised the emperor Achmet I. and he accordingly ordered all the cats to be transported to a desert island near Scutari.</P>
<BIBL>Short, vol. 1. Mign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t's Hist. Turkish Empire.</BIBL>
<P>In 1614 the winter was severe; there was an eruption of Etna, and an earthquake in the Azores. The heavens appeared, at one time in a flame, and afterwards very dark.</P>
<P>This year was remarkable for the most universal small-pox, and most fatal ever known. It laid waste Alexandria, Crete, Turkey, Calabria, Italy, Venice, Dalmatia, France, Germa∣ny, Poland, Flanders and England. The mortality equalled that of the plague. In Persia also it raged, with measles.</P>
<P>In 1615 the seasons were cold. In 1616 a very hot and dry summer—quartan agues epidemic—not a family in Germany escaped; but not fatal.</P>
<P>In 1617 the summer was hot and dry.</P>
<P>In 1618 appeared a remarkable comet in November, (Short mentions four) and a town in Rhetia was overwhelmed by an earthquake. Violent tempests, inundations and hurricanes are recorded of the same year, and in Bermuda, the year following, a storm tore up the strongest trees by the roots. In 1619 Heckla discharged her fiery contents.</P>
<P>In 1618 broke out in Naples a malignant Angina which rav∣aged the place for many years. The plague appeared at Bergen,
<PB N="176" REF="036687_0180_100AA1E554DDDBA0"/>
in Norway, in Denmark and in Grand Cairo. This was the beginning of a very pestilential period, and here must be intro∣duced the terrible pestilence which wasted the American Indians, just before our ancestors landed in Massachusetts. As this is one of the most remarkable facts in history, and one that demon∣strates the general causes of plague to belong to other climates, besides those of Egypt and the Levant, I have taken great pains to ascertain the species of disease, and the time of its appearance.</P>
<P>Capt. Dermer, an English adventurer, who had arrived in America, in a fishing vessel, a year or two before, passed the winter of 1618-19 in Monhiggan, an Indian town on the northern coast On the 19th of May 1619 he sailed along the coast, on his way to Virginia, and landed at several places, where he had been the year before; and he found many Indian towns totally depopulated—in others a few natives remained alive, but "not free of sickness;" "their disease, the plague, for we might perceive the sores of some that had escaped, who described the spots of such as usually die." These are his words. He found some villages, which, in his former visit, were populous, all deserted—the Indians "all dead."</P>
<BIBL>Purchas, vol. 4. 1778.</BIBL>
<P>Richard Vines, and his companions, who had been sent by Ferdinando Gorges, to explore the country, wintered among the Indians, during the pestilence, and remained untouched, the disease attacking none of the English. Belknap's Life of Gor∣ges, American Biography, vol. 1. p. 355, but the year is not specified.</P>
<P>Gookin, in his account of the Indians, Historical Collections, p. 8, places this pestilence in 1612 and 13, about seven or eight years before the English arrived at Plymouth. But this cannot be accurate, unless the disease began to rage for a number of years previous to 1618. Capt. Dermer's letter in Purchas is decisive of the time of the principal sickness, and fortunately we have another authority which is indisputable.</P>
<P>A sermon was preached by Elder Cushman at Plymouth, in 1620, just after the colony arrived, and sent to London to be published. In the Epistle Dedicatory which is dated December, 21, 1621, the author has these words. "They [the Indians]
<PB N="177" REF="036687_0181_100AA1E7B3A64270"/>
were very much wasted of late, by a great mortality, that fell amongst them, <HI>three years since,</HI> which, with their own civil dissentions and bloody wars, hath so wasted them, as I think the twentieth person is scarce left alive."</P>
<BIBL>Hazard's Collection, vol. 1. p. 148.</BIBL>
<P>This corresponds also with the accounts in Prince's Chronol∣ogy from original manuscripts. This fixes the time in 1618, precisely agreeable to Capt. Dermer's account. This was the year of the principal mortality; but like other pestilential pe∣riods, this continued for a number of years; for some of the Plymouth settlers went to Massachusetts, (now Boston) in 1622, to purchase corn of the natives; and "found among the In∣dians, a great sickness, not unlike the plague, if not the same." It raged in winter, and affected the Indians only.</P>
<BIBL>See Purchas 4. 1858. Prince's Chron. 124.</BIBL>
<P>The time then is fixed. The disease commenced, or raged with its principal violence in 1618 and through the winter. This was the year of the remarkable comet, when the plague was raging in many parts of the world. So fatal was the pestilence in America, that the warriors from Narragansett to Penobscot, the distance to which the disease seems to have been limited, were reduced from 9000 to a few hundreds.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hutchinson says, 30,000 of the Massachusetts tribe alone were supposed to be reduced to 300.</NOTE> When our an∣cestors arrived in 1620, they found the bones of those who per∣ished, in many places, unburied.</P>
<BIBL>Magnalia, book 1. p. 7.</BIBL>
<P>The kind of disease is another important question. Dermer seems to think it a species of plague, and he saw some of the sores of those who had survived. Hutchinson, vol. 1. p. 34, 35, says some have supposed it to have been the small-pox, but the Indians, who were perfectly acquainted with this disease, after the English arrived, always gave a very different account of it, and described it as a pestilential putrid fever.</P>
<P>Fortunately General Gookin, in the passage above cited, has left us a fact, which leaves no doubt as to the nature of the mal∣ady. His words are— "What the disease was, which so gen∣erally
<PB N="178" REF="036687_0182_100AA1EB8440AB38"/>
and mortally swept them away, I cannot learn. Doubt∣less it was some pestilential disease. I have discoursed with some old Indians, that were then youths, who say, that the <HI>bodies all over were exceeding yellow</HI> (describing it by a yellow garment they showed me) both before they died and afterwards."</P>
<P>This account may be relied on for its authenticity and it de∣cides the question, that the pestilence was the true American plague, called yellow fever. If any confirmation of this evi∣dence were necessary, we have it in Prince's Chronology, where it is recorded that this fever produced hemorrhagy from the nose.</P>
<P>At the time Gookin wrote, about forty or fifty years after the settlement of New-England, the infectious fevers of autumn were called "pestilent," and they were frequent in the country, but had not then acquired the appellation of <HI>yellow.</HI></P>
<BIBL>Winthrop's Journal, p. 51.</BIBL>
<P>This fever has been frequent among the Indians since the Eng∣lish settled the country. Some instances will be hereafter related.</P>
<P>The evidence then of the origin of the yellow fever in this country, between the 41st and 44th degrees of latitude, is com∣plete, leaving no room for doubt or controversy. No intercourse existed, in 1618, between this continent and the West-Indies; nor did a single vessel pass between New-England and the islands, till twenty years after that pestilence. Not one of the islands was then settled, except by the Spaniards, with whom our an∣cestors had no commerce. Not an European was among the Indians, except a French seaman, who had escaped from a wreck a year or two before, and Mr. Vine's men, who arrived di∣rectly from England. These men escaped the disease; none be∣ing attacked but the Indians; another evidence of the origin of the malady in the country.</P>
<P>In Gorges' description of New-England, there is the follow∣ing account of this pestilence. " The summer after the blazing star, which moved from the east to the west, even a little before the English removed from Holland to Plymouth, in New-Eng∣land, there befel a great mortality among the Indians, the great∣est that had ever happened in the memory of man, or been ta∣ken notice of by tradition, laying waste the cast."</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="036687_0183_100AA1ED0BAAADD8"/>The author further remarks that this star was much noted in Europe. In America it was seen in the south-west, for "thirty sleeps," as the Indians express themselves. The description of the comet here given answers to that of Riverius, who repre∣sents it as very splendid, larger than Venus, moving from the east to the west, and visible from Nov. 27, 1618, till the close of December. This was the time the pestilence was raging among the Indians. Gorges indeed says, it was the summer <HI>after</HI> the blazing star. It is true, that the disease continued not only into 1619, but occurred in autumn for some years subse∣quent. We hear of it among the Massachusetts Indians in 1622. From this it appears that this was a long and severe period of pestilence, between 1617 and 1623, or a later year; like the present period in the United States.</P>
<P>It must be remarked that in 1618, the same year when the In∣dians in America were falling a prey to this malady, the angina ma∣ligna broke out in the kingdom of Naples, and spread mortality over the country, as authors affirm, for eighteen years. This how∣ever is not understood, as affirming the disease to have been con∣stantly epidemic; but as prevailing at certain times and seasons.</P>
<P>The same destructive principle operated in Virginia. Capt. Dermer relates that when he arrived in the Chesapeek on the 8th of September, "The first news struck cold to our hearts, the sickness over the land."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Capt. Dermer was probably the first Englishman that ever passed through the rapids between Long-Island and the main land, now called Hell-Gate. He describes this passage as a cataract, and mentions the difference in times of high water, from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast and west.</NOTE> Three hundred of the settlers died in 1619.</P>
<P>It appears from Purchas that the emigrants to Virginia in 1619, 20 and 21, amounted to 3570, in 42 sail of ships.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. Jefferson allows only 2516 persons to have arrived in that period.</NOTE> There were 600 souls in that colony before these arrived, mak∣ing the whole number 4170. Of these, 349 perished in the Indian massacre of 1622, which would leave 3821 survivors. But in 1624 no more than 1800 were living. Scanty means of subsistence might have contributed to this mortality; but most of it was in consequence of fevers, that were probably the ef∣fects
<PB N="180" REF="036687_0184_100AA1EEC6D73498"/>
of the climate, and a very unfavorable state of the atmos∣phere.</P>
<P>In 1620 a comet was followed by a cold winter. In England the year was distinguished by a violent tempest, a preternatural tide, and a very wet summer. The Hungarian fever, so called, spread along the Rhine, and in the next year became infectious. London became sickly. The year 1621 was remarkable for an epidemic malignant small-pox.</P>
<P>In 1622 a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omet is noted, and an earthquake in Italy. In New-England the spring was excessively dry, from the third week in May to the middle of July.</P>
<P>In 1623 the epidemic fevers in Europe became more fatal, as the period of pestilence approached. This is obvious from the London burials, which show a considerable increment. Rive∣rius, who has written on the epidemic fevers of this period in the south of France, observes that the mortality was great, until he began to bleed and purge, when it abated. He refers to the city of Montpelier, where almost half died who were seized. The disease was a species of pestilence.</P>
<P>This author concurs with the ancients in ascribing pestilence to comets. Speaking of the singular star of 1618, he says, "Hunc vero Cometam, morborum malignorum et pestilentium, necnon etiam bellorum, quibus universa penè hactenus Europa devastata est, praesagium ac prenuntium fuisse, credere non alie∣num est."</P>
<BIBL>De febre pest. 533. fol.</BIBL>
<P>The author falls into the error, which has brought into con∣tempt the opinions of the ancient sages, in regard to the influ∣ence of the stars on man, and the state of the elements. He ascribes <HI>moral</HI> as well as <HI>physical</HI> effects to that influence. Ad∣mitting the distant orbs to have some effect on the air or fire of our system, and through that medium to augment or diminish the stimulus which acts on the human body and of course on the passions, by the exciting powers; yet any moral effects derived from this source, must be so inconsiderable, or so blended with the effects of other causes, as interest, ambition, love, revenge and the like, that the degree of influence could not be ascer∣tained, nor the effects of one cause distinguished from those of the
<PB N="181" REF="036687_0185_100AA1F11A55A360"/>
other. I reject therefore all <HI>moral</HI> effects ascribed to comets; but the <HI>physical</HI> effects are, beyond question, great and extensive.</P>
<P>The diseases of this period continued to multiply and grow more malignant in 1624, when the epidemic assumed the form of the spotted fever. In 1625 this fever turned to the plague, and in 1626 changed back to the spotted fever, says Lotichius, cited by Short. This is not an unusual fact.</P>
<P>The plague in 1625 swept away 35,000 of the citizens of London. It raged at the same time in Italy, Denmark and Leyden, and how much more extensively, I am not informed.</P>
<P>In this year another comet was seen; several cities in Spain were overwhelmed by inundations; the winter was severe; the summer, hot and moist weather; and there was an eruption of a volcano in Iceland. It is remarkable also that, in this year, a volcano burst forth in Palma, one of the Canaries, with a vi∣olent earthquake.</P>
<P>The summer of 1626 was very hot, and the plague continued its ravages in many parts of Europe, as in Wittemburg and the vicinity; and in Lyons, which lost 60,000 of its inhabitants. This was the prelude to more general calamity in France; for in the following years the whole country felt the distressing ef∣fects of the malady.</P>
<P>In 1627 and 8 the same disease prevailed in various other countries, especially in Augsburg after a famin. In 1629 the pestilence raged in Amsterdam. In 1630 Cambridge in Eng∣land was visited. It was a very sickly summer in London, so that the citizens were alarmed and many retired to the country; but finding the country very sickly, they returned.</P>
<P>In 1629 Pola, a town in the Venetian territories, lost 7000 inhabitants by an earthquake.</P>
<P>Of the pestilence in this period, there was hardly a suspen∣sion. Particular countries enjoyed short intervals of health; but Europe and America were severely annoyed by pestilential diseases between 1632 and 1637.</P>
<P>In 1630 happened great explosions of subterranean fire. A∣pulia lost 17,000 people by an earthquake; and Lima, in South-America,
<PB N="182" REF="036687_0186_100AA1F4202D7128"/>
was laid in ruins by the like catastrophe. At this time the plague prevailed in Vienna.</P>
<P>In 1631 happened a memorable earthquake in Naples, with a tremendous eruption of Vesuvius, which continued or was re∣peated in 1632. In this eruption, Baglivus assures us, Vesu∣vius lost 240 feet of its altitude.</P>
<P>Cotemporary with these discharges of fire and lava, was an erysipelous fever in Europe with inflammation in the jaws, and an increase of mortality, antecedent to a general plague. See the bills of mortality for London, Augsburg and Dresden, where the progress of the malignity in the epidemics, is distinct∣ly marked, by an augmentation of the bills, till the plague in 1636.</P>
<P>In 1633 appeared a comet, which was followed by a severe winter. The same winter in America was mild, says Winthrop, p. 61. Southerly winds prevailed till the close of winter, when there were great snows. It is very common that severe cold is progressive, happening in Europe one year before it does in A∣merica, as will hereafter appear.</P>
<P>In 1633 the year of the comet, commenced an eruption of Etna, which continued for four or five years, through this whole pestilential period. London was shaken by an earthquake, and at Halifax in Yorkshire raged a very malignant fever.</P>
<P>In this year also a "pestilent fever," invaded the little colo∣ny at Plymouth in Massachusetts, and carried off twenty of their number. This was a great mortality for that small settle∣ment. It must have been occasioned by a fever of domestic ori∣gin, as the colony had, at that time, no intercourse with for∣eign countries, except with England. No suspicion has ever been entertained that the disease was of foreign origin.</P>
<P>At the same time, the Indians were invaded by the small-pox which swept them away in multitudes. It spread from Narra∣gansett to Piscataqua, and westward to Connecticut river.</P>
<P>The summer of this year was remarkable for innumerable large flies, of the size of bees, which made the woods resound with a humming noise.</P>

<P>We have then a remarkable evidence of the extent of a pes∣tilential
<PB N="183" REF="036687_0187_100AA1F66C0EC348"/>
principle in the elements. The same species of diseases appeared, at the same time, in Augsburg, Dresden, London, and in America. Probably the same species prevailed over most of Europe; for we hear of them in every part of Holland in the following year. The diseases predominant, previous to the plague, are of the eruptive kind: Such was the case in the pres∣ent instance. In America, the epidemic among the Indians took the form of the small-pox; and altho it is the current opin∣ion that the small-pox is communicated only by contagion, yet my investigations have satisfied me that this is a great error. The small-pox is one of the <HI>family of eruptive diseases,</HI> which belong to almost every pestilential period. Before its origin and progress had been affected by the art of innoculation, it used to be epidemic, in large cities, under that inflammatory condition of the atmosphere, which originated measles, influenza, anginas and plague, and <HI>rarely or never at any other time.</HI> This disease therefore, tho communicable at any time by infection, is gene∣rated in particular habits without any infecting cause ab extra; and is the offspring of that state of the atmosphere which gen∣erates other eruptive epidemics.</P>
<P>In 1634 the plague showed itself at Ratisbon. The summer in America was hotter than usual, and the following winter was very cold.</P>
<P>In 1635 the plague appeared in Leyden and 20,000 inhabit∣ants perished. This year was distinguished for an eruption of Vesuvius, violent earthquakes, an inundation in Holstein which des<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>royed 600 people and 50,000 head of cattle, and a terrible tempest in America on the 15th of August O. S. which brot in a remarkable swell of the ocean. It will appear hereafter that most of the violent storms and hurricanes, which sweep the earth, happen during or near the time of the discharges of great quantities of fire from volcanoes. In this year, Etna and Ve∣suvius were both in a state of eruption. The plague appeared also in Mentz and other parts of Germany.</P>
<P>In 1636 there was an eruption of Heckla. The pestilence was general in proportion to this universal agitation of the central
<PB N="184" REF="036687_0188_100AA1F8BA9442F8"/>
fires. In London it prevailed in 1636 after a regular increase of previous malignity in diseases.</P>
<P>Of the progress of the pestilence in Holland, and especially in Nimeguen, we have an accurate account in the treatise of the able Diemerbroeck, which is by far the most learned and philo∣sophic work on the plague, that I have seen. Not that I believe his opinion of the cause of the plague; but his view of the sub∣ject is otherwise correct and worthy of universal attention.</P>
<P>In 1635 when the plague appeared in Leyden, the malignant diseases, its precursors, appeared in various parts of Holland. In Nimeguen, these precursors were measles, small-pox, dysen∣teries of the worst type, but especially the spotted fever. The malignity of this fever increased, until it <HI>changed into the real plague</HI>—"donec in apertissimam pestem transiret," says Diemer∣broeck.</P>
<P>The plague appeared, in a few cases, in November 1635, but made little progress, during the winter. In January appearan∣ces were more alarming; in March the malady spread rapidly and continued to increase till autumn. Scarcely a house escaped; more than half who were seized, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ied; and medical aid was baffled. The disease declined in the following winter, and was extinguished by a severe frost in February 1637.</P>
<P>The summers of 1636 and 7 were warm, the winds constantly from the south and west, "cum magnis aeris squaloribus," says Diemerbroeck.</P>
<P>In 1635 a dysentery prevailed in most parts of Germany. In 1636 the eruption from Etna was augmented, and Rome was severely afflicted with the plague. In 1637 the same distemper raged in some parts of Holland, in Denmark, Constantinople and Natolia; after which year the disease declined or disappeared.</P>
<P>This period of disease was also experienced in Virginia, where, says Winthrop, died 1800 people in the year 1635.</P>
<P>The summer of 1638 was very hot and dry in England, as it was in America, after a very severe winter, and cold spring.</P>
<P>In this year was a most tremendous earthquake in Calabria, memorable for the destruction of whole towns and the loss of 30,000 lives.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="036687_0189_100AA1FA69F374C8"/>On the first of June, between 3 and 4 o'clock in the after∣noon, in a clear warm day, with a westerly wind, happened a great earthquake in America, which extended from the Piscat∣aqua to the Connecticut, and perhaps over the whole northern region. The year was also distinguished for tempestuous weath∣er; not for ordinary storms which occur many times every year, but violent hurricanes of vast extent. On the third of August a tempest raised the tide, on the Narragansett shore, fourteen feet above common spring tides. Autumn was very rainy and considerable snow fell in October, which our ancestors ascri∣bed to the earthquake. On the 25th of September, another mighty tempest occurred and the highest swell of the sea that had then been observed in America. If I mistake not, the state of the atmosphere, during earthquakes and eruptions of volca∣noes, is peculiarly disposed, not only to produce high winds, but to generate snow and hail.</P>
<P>This year was very sickly in America. In December a gen∣eral fast was observed, one reason for which was the prevalence of the "small-pox and fevers."</P>
<BIBL>Winthrop, p. 165.</BIBL>
<P>The spring of 1639 in America was very dry, there was no rain from April 26th, to June 4th, O. S. and from the south∣ward came swarms of small flies, which covered the sea, but they did not invade the land.</P>
<BIBL>Winthrop, p. 181—184.</BIBL>
<P>The plague continued to infest London, without interruption, from 1636 to 1648; see the bills of mortality; but it was not epidemic, nor very fatal.</P>
<P>In 1640 a hard winter, and epidemic pleurisies were fatal in Europe. The following year, a malignant fever was epidemic, in England, and other countries.</P>
<P>In September 11th appeared, in the evening, a remarkable light in the heavens, about 30 or 40 feet in length; it moved rapidly and was visible about a minute. It was seen in Boston, in Plymouth and in New-Haven, and to the spectators every

where, appeared to be in the same part of the heavens—of course must have been of a great altitude.</P>
<BIBL>Winthrop, p. 232.</BIBL>
<P>I notice this fact as it confirms the testimony of ancient wri∣ters, who, in describing the seasons and phenomena of pesti∣lential periods, frequently mention similar appearances. This seems to have been of the figure of a beam, called by the Latin writers, <HI>trabs,</HI> but it differed from those meteors discribed by ancient writers, in the rapidity of its motion.</P>
<P>In November following a series of tempests took place, and the highest tide ever known at Boston.</P>
<P>This summer of 1641 was remarkably wet and cold, so that a great part of the corn did not come to maturity. Those who fed on it, the year following, were exceedingly troubled with worms, and some persons found a remedy in leaving bread and living on fish.</P>
<BIBL>Winthrop, p. 234.</BIBL>
<P>The following winter was the most severe that had been known for 40 years. The bay at Boston was frozen so that teams and loads passed to the town from the neighboring islands. The snow was deep, and Chesapeek bay was nearly frozen. At Boston, the ice extended to sea, as far as the eye could reach. The following spring 1642 was early, but wet.</P>
<BIBL>Winthrop, p. 240, 243.</BIBL>
<P>The oldest Indians declared they could scarcely recollect such a winter.</P>
<P>This severe winter was followed by a very sickly summer on the Delaware river. Such was the mortality among the settlers from New-Haven, who had not long been in that country, that it broke up their settlement. The Swedes settled there suffered much by the same disease.</P>
<BIBL>Ibm. 254.</BIBL>
<P>The very wet weather of the last year produced a dearth of corn in Boston, in the spring of 1643, and myriads of pigeons appeared also and did no small injury, the same season. It is an old observation, in America, that pigeons are uncommonly nu∣merous in the spring of sickly years. The Massachusetts colony suffered also from the number of mice which devoured their grain, and the bark of the fruit-trees.</P>

<P>One fact in the foregoing account deserves notice; the ex∣treme winter in America was in 1641-2, one year later than in Europe. Several instances have occurred in other periods, which seem to indicate a kind of progressiveness in great cold from east to west.

"In 1647 an epidemic sickness passed through the whole country, affecting the colonists and the natives, English, French and Dutch. It began with a cold and in many accompanied with a light fever.

the disease was raging in Turkey, in Presburg, Hungary and in the city of Moscow, it is alledged, perished 200,000 inhabitants. We have here precise and authentic evidence, that the plague appeared in Chester, in the north-west of England, in Denmark, in Russia, Hungary and Turkey, in the <HI>same season.</HI> To prove this to be the effect of a general principle, we have numberless authorities, in the Gazettes of that and the next year, that ma∣lignant diseases prevailed over Europe.

And it is remark∣able in this instance, that the epidemic plague appeared <HI>in the north of Europe before it did in Italy</HI>—an exception to the gen∣eral course of that disease.</P>

<P>I have not materials for a complete view of the diseases of this pestilential period. But it is to be observed, that influenza prevailed over Europe in 1650, and diseases of the throat in It∣aly in 1651—diseases which seem to precede pestilential fevers on most occasions.</P>

This is an instance of a violent con∣cussion of the earth, in the same year with violent rains; but unfortunately I can find no account which phenomenon preceded the other.

<P>The introduction of the plague into Naples was ascribed to a transport of soldiers from Sardinia. How the disease came to be in Sardinia, we are not informed. But this report, like nine tenths of all the stories about infection, is demonstrably a mis∣take. The account given in the history of the disease, is, that it was at first called by physicians a "malignant fever." One of the faculty, a man probably of more observation and firm∣ness than the others, affirmed the distemper to be pestilential, and for his audacity, was imprisoned by the Viceroy, who ap∣prehended the report might injure the business and reputation of the city.</P>
<P>We have then another instance of the uncertainty in the minds of medical gentlemen, about the nature of the disease, when it first appeared, because it was not characterized by the distinctive marks of the plague, the glandular tumors.

<P>There cannot be a more clear and demonstrable truth, than that a disease of specific contagion, must communicate a disease of the same specific character. If the plague has this species of contagion, it cannot communicate another disease, a malignant fever, for instance, which has a different character or type, and

is destitute of the distinctive marks of the plague. A single in∣stance might occur, in which the disease might not bear the character of its original; but it is absurd to suppose, that a plague <HI>with</HI> glandular tumors, can communicate and render epi∣demic a fever <HI>without</HI> glandular tumors.</P>
<P>Yet all severe plagues first appear in the form of such fever, or other diseases <HI>without tumors.</HI> I challenge the followers of Mead to produce an exception. Hence the uncertainty that per∣plexes the physician and the magistrate at the commencement of the plague—an uncertainty that has originated in the errors re∣specting the specific nature of the disease and its propagation by infection—errors as fatal to great cities, as to truth and philoso∣phy.</P>
<P>Had the real origin of this disease been known, the certainty of the existence of it in Naples, Venice, Rome, Vienna, Am∣sterdam and London, would have induced the citizens to aban∣don the places, before the distemper had made much progress, and multitudes of lives would have been saved—an expedient practised in America, with the most salutary effects.</P>
<P>In Genoa, the disease manifested a more distinct progression; 10,000 died the first year, and about 70,000 the second.</P>
<P>When this distemper appeared in Malta, Candia and Sardinia, every possible precaution was taken to prevent its introduction in∣to Genoa, by stopping intercourse with those places; but in vain.</P>
<P>When the report of a malignant infectious fever in Naples prevailed in May 1656, an alarm was excited in Rome; a com∣mittee of health watched over the safety of that city; four of the gates were shut and barred; the others were guarded with vigilance to prevent any person from entering who could be sus∣pected of infection; but all efforts were useless. The real truth was the disease was an epidemic, no more under the control of health laws, than the influenza and sore throat which had pre∣ceded it.</P>
<P>The summer of 1657 in England was very hot, and succeed∣ed by a long severe winter and deep snow.</P>
<P>In April 1658 commenced in Europe an epidemic catarrh, which was so sudden in its attack as to seize a whole village in a
<PB N="193" REF="036687_0197_100AA20DAD87D688"/>
night. It was severe and fatal to old people—its course was fin∣ished in about six weeks. The summer was hot and fevers with vertigo and delirium, were epidemic.</P>
<BIBL>See Short, vol. 1. and Morton's Treatise.</BIBL>
<P>It will be remarked that the year 1647 when the influenza invaded America, was a sickly year in Europe. In 1655 when the plague was epidemic in Europe, the influenza again prevailed in America. In 1658 when the influenza invaded Europe, great sickness and mortality occurred in America. These alter∣nations of epidemic diseases will be observed in the subsequent stages of this history.</P>
<P>In 1659 prevailed the Cynanche Trachealis in America—the first instance mentioned in our annals. Magnalia, b. 4. 156.— This disease was also succeeded by malignant diseases, for the Legislature of Connecticut in October 1662 appointed a day of thanksgiving, two reasons assigned for which were, the "abate∣ment of the sickness in the country, and a supply of rain in time of drouth."</P>
<P>This was the commencement of a very sickly period in Europe. In 1660 occurred an eruption of Vesuvius, and of a volcano in Iceland. The year was very tempestuous, and earthquakes shook England, France and America. In 1661 appeared a comet.</P>
<P>In 1662 another considerable earthquake happened in New-England; and in this year was the drouth above mentioned.— In 1663 Canada was convulsed for five months by a series of successive shocks—small rivers and springs were dried up—the waters of others were tinctured with the taste of sulphur—an immense ridge of mountains subsided to a plain. Such were the phenomena in America which marked this pestilential period.</P>

<P>In 1663 a malignant disease seized the inhabitants of the Ve∣netian territories and 60,000 perished. The country, at the same time, was overrun by innumerable small worms.</P>
<P>In the same year, a memorable mortality occurred in England, among the cattle and sheep, by means of a disease in which the
<PB N="194" REF="036687_0198_100AA210CE4B39B8"/>
liver was eaten by small worms, and in some cases, the lungs. These phenomena were the precursors of the plague in many parts of Europe. In England, all diseases assumed new violence, as early as in 1661, preparatory to the great plague. See Sy∣denham. In Holland, the plague appeared at Heusden, in 1663.</P>
<P>The winter of 1663-4 was mild. In the following summer, Prussia was afflicted by a malignant purple fever, attended with tumors or inflammation in the throat, very fatal to the young. Bonnetus. Med. Septen. p. 206. A species of scarlatina.</P>
<P>In 1664 appeared a comet; another in 1665, and a third in 1666. In 1664 began an eruption of Etna, which lasted, with various degrees of violence, till the year 1669, when it ended with a most dreadful explosion. This period corresponds with the epidemics described by Sydenham.</P>
<P>In 1664 the summer in England was wet, and cattle died of diseases. In New-England commenced the mildew of wheat, which has rendered it impossible to cultivate that grain, on the Atlantic coast of the three Eastern States. The winter of 1664-5, was terribly severe in England; the Thames was a bridge of ice, and in January happened earthquakes, in Coven∣try and Buckinghamshire. During this winter inflammatory fevers and quinsies, says Sydenham, were more frequent in Lon∣don, than were before known. These gave way in May to a malignant fever, which could hardly be distinguished from the plague, which, in June, became the controling epidemic.</P>
<P>Such were the phenomena of the pestilential period under con∣sideration; and at this time, the plague appeared in Holland, and in England. English authors all agree that the disease was imported into England from Holland in some bales of cotton! O fatal bales of cotton! says Short. This tale has been record∣ed and repeated by every writer on the subject, without a single document in evidence to prove that any cotton was imported, or that the first persons seized had ever seen such cotton. The whole tale rests on assertion. That the seeds of the distemper were <HI>not</HI> imported is evident from the acknowledged facts relative to its origin; and is demonstrated by the history of the prece∣ding diseases found in the works of Sydenham.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="036687_0199_100AA2130C5CD350"/>The origin of the pestilence, which arrived to its crisis in 1665, is to be traced back to the year 1661, when malignant dis∣eases began to appear in different and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>istant parts of the world. In London, the intermitting tertian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, says Sydenham, be∣came epidemic, and differed from the same disease in other years, by new and unusual symptoms, which in short, amounted to this, that they were "<HI>all more violent.</HI>" In winter, the disease yield∣ed, as usual, to cold, but continued fevers prevailed every win∣ter. These fevers, with some variations, continued until the spring of 1665, and the bills show how much they augmented the mortality in London. This increased malignity in usual dis∣eases, with an increase of the number and mortality of epidemics, is the constant precursor of the plague or other pestilential fevers.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the clear evidence of these facts, authors have conjured up a tale of importation which would disgrace a school∣boy by its inconsistency.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If this language should be thought too severe, I can sincerely say, that in my opinion, no language can be too severe for the carelessness which has originated a system of error on this important subject.</NOTE> The account states, "That a violent plague had raged in Holland in 1663, on which account, the importation of merchandize from that country was prohibited by the British Legislature in 1664. Notwithstanding this prohibi∣tion, <HI>it seems the plague had actually been imported;</HI> for in the close of 1664, two or three persons died suddenly in Westminster, <HI>with marks of the plague on their bodies.</HI>—Some of their neighbors, terrified at the thoughts of their danger, removed into the city; but too late; for they soon died of the plague, and communi∣cated the infection to others. It was confined however through a hard, frosty winter, till the middle of February, when it again appeared in the Parish of St. Giles, to which it had been ori∣ginally brought; and after another long rest, till April, showed its malignant force afresh, as soon as the warmth of spring gave it opportunity. <HI>At first, it took off one here and there, without any certain proof of their having infected each other.</HI></P>
<BIBL>Encyclopedia, art. London. 21.</BIBL>
<P>In the substance of the foregoing statement, all authors are agreed, and I want no other proof that the report of the impor∣tation of the disease is all a vulgar, childish tale, the propagation
<PB N="196" REF="036687_0200_100AA2736F214AD8"/>
of which is a disgrace to philosophy and to the faculty of that age.</P>
<P>In the first place we have no authentic evidence in any author, that any bales of cotton were brought from Holland to London, at that time. The whole assertion rests on vulgar report, and is wholly unsupported by proof—had the report been well founded, the fact might have been ascertained, and in an affair of such magnitude, probably would have been. The importation of goods from Holland was prohibited by act of parliament.</P>
<P>In the second place, the disease first appeared in Westminster, not in the commercial city of London, but in a place where bales of cotton would be the least likely to be deposited and opened; Westminster being the residence of the nobility and gen∣try, rather than a place of commerce.</P>
<P>In the third place, no proof is stated that the persons first seized had any connection with bales of cotton.</P>
<P>In the fourth place, the death of two or three persons, with the plague-marks on their bodies, in December 1664, is no evidence of any imported infection at that time; for the bills of mortality show, and the reader is desired to turn to them, to be satisfied, that a smaller number died that year of the plague, than had died of it in any of the six preceding years. In the year 1659 died of that disease 36—in 1661 died 20, and every year more or less. In 1664 died but 6 of the plague, and yet this number, small as it was, must be proof of the importation of infection, <HI>that year,</HI> when <HI>greater numbers,</HI> in preceding years, are passed over in silence! In such accounts, there must be want of knowledge, or want of honesty. The plague imported from Holland! when the city of London had not been free from it, for 28 years preceding! See the bills of mortality!—</P>
<P>Besides, why in the name of common sense, should "two or three," infected persons in 1664, spread the plague over Lon∣don, and desolate the city, when twelve, fourteen, twenty and thirty-six infected persons, who died in preceding years, produced no ill effects? To account for such effects on the principle of <HI>in∣fection,</HI> is not possible; and men of science ought to be ashamed of such absurdities.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="036687_0201_100AA275CE167200"/>In the fifth place, the suspension of the disease, during six weeks, is evidence, that infection had no agency in spreading the disease. It is a fact known and acknowledged, that <HI>infection</HI> cannot be preserved, for a tenth part of that time in the open air. Air dissolves the poison of any disease, in a very short time. Infection can only be preserved in confinement, as in close ves∣sels or packages of goods. The walls of an infected house will be cleansed by the action of air, in a very few days, so as to be perfectly harmless. During the six weeks suspension of the plague in London, where was the infection concealed to preserve it from air and frost?</P>
<P>Was the fomes shut up by design for a few weeks and then set at liberty? Had the persons who were first seized in Febru∣ary, any access to the infected houses or clothes of those who died in December? Is this probable? There is no suggestion of this sort.</P>
<P>Then again another interval of several weeks elapsed from the death of those in February, before others were feized. It is not solely improbable; but I aver, that the fomes or infecting principle of no disease whatever, can be suspended in a state of inaction, in the open air, and afterwards give rise to disease. Unless therefore it can be proved that the persons who died in April had access to infection, which had been closely confined from the air, they could never have received the disease from the virus generated in February or December. Now it appears from the statement, that the persons, seized in February, lived in a different part of the city, from those who died in December, and no suggestion that they had an intercourse with any infected object.</P>
<P>But the last sentence of the statement disproves fully all asser∣tions and suspicions respecting infection. It seems that when the disease showed itself in spring, it seized one here, and another there, in scattered situations, "without any certain proof of their having infected each other." This is usually the case in the plague, and in the yellow fever, in the ulcerous sore throat, the dysentery and other contagious, epidemic diseases. The whole mystery is, that any disease will <HI>first</HI> seize the constitutions least
<PB N="198" REF="036687_0202_100AA278E9888D98"/>
capable of resisting that state of air, from which the disease pro∣ceeds. One person will sust<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n a vitiated air, for one day only; another for two days, and a t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rd for a week, before his consti∣tution yields to the destructive principle. It is precisely with the access of the plague, in a city, as with a company of men going from a healthy situation, into a marshy place—one man will be seized very speedily with the ague and fever; another will sustain his health for a week or two, and some perhaps es∣cape unaffected. This example explains the phenomena which attend the invasion of pestilence, as related by Evagrius, Die∣merbroeck and others, and which will be more fully discussed in a subsequent section.</P>
<P>The account therefore of the origin of the plague in London in 1665, not only does not prove the disease to have proceeded from imported fomes, but actually demonstrates the impossibility of the fact.</P>
<P>But we have better evidence than the popular accounts afford us, that the disease was generated in the city of London. Sy∣denham has left facts on record, which place this point beyond controversy.</P>
<P>After describing the multiplied diseases of increased malignity, which prevailed in London, from 1661 to 1665, and which swelled greatly the bills of mortality in that city, he informs us that in May 1665 he was called to assist a woman of a sanguine habit, who was seized with violent fever and frequent vomitings. He was surprised at the singularity of the symptoms, and puz∣zled to know how to treat the disease. The woman died the 14th day. He observed her face, during the fever, to be red, and that a little before her death, a few drops of blood issued from her nose. These and other circumstances suggested to him the use of bleeding, and his next patient recovered.</P>
<P>This species of malignant fever soon spread and towards the close of May and beginning of June, became epidemic. Soon after appeared the true plague with its characteristic symptoms. After stating these facts, Sydenham says, "Whether the fever under consideration deserves to be entitled a plague, I dare not positively affirm; but this I know by experience, that all who
<PB N="199" REF="036687_0203_100AA27A7599A248"/>
were then seized with the true plague, attended with all its pe∣culiar concomitants, and for some time afterwards, in my neigh∣borhood, had the same train of symptoms, both in the beginning and through the course of the disease."</P>
<P>He then observes that he attended some persons with the true plague, and afterwards, he saw several cases of a similar fever.</P>
<BIBL>See chap. 2. sect. 2.</BIBL>
<P>Had not the faculty been blinded to truth by their theory of <HI>specific contagion,</HI> it would not have been possible so long to over∣look the <HI>progressiveness</HI> of the plague, which not only Sydenham, but many physicians of the 16th and 17th centuries observed and recorded.</P>
<P>The malignant diseases which prevailed from 1661 to 1664 marked a <HI>pestilential state of air</HI> in London. We now know what Sydenham could not know, that this unhealthy state of air extended not only over Europe, but over Persia and America. But the malignant fever which appeared in May, as described by Sydenham, was the <HI>first stage of the plague,</HI> or mild form of the disease, which <HI>always</HI> precedes that state of it which is char∣acterized by buboes. This form of the disease appears before the season or state of the atmosphere is advanced sufficiently to give the destructive principle its full force.</P>
<P>The same species of fever preceded the terrible plague in Ve∣nice and in Naples, as before related; and this is always the cause of uncertainty and controversy respecting the nature of the disease, at its commencement. And it is remarkable that this milder form of the plague, often rages for many months, before the disease arrives to its crisis. Thus in London, the pestilen∣tial principle produced a few cases of real plague, in the winter of 1664-5. The cases must have occurred in constitutions more irritable, or susceptible of the cause, than bodies in gene∣ral; or the persons must have been exposed to the action of pow∣erful local causes, or to extreme debility. The severe frost doubtless suspended the operation of the pestilential principle— but on the opening of spring, the operation began, and pro∣ceeded from the malignant epidemic of May to produce the most deadly effects.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="036687_0204_100AA27D4CA555D0"/>I have one observation further to make on this subejct. It has been alledged and generally admitted that the plague was intro∣duced into Amsterdam, in 1663 by a vessel from the Mediter∣ranean. It is probable that if this question could be fully can∣vassed, the popular belief would appear to have had no better foundation, than many opinions in America, in regard to the importation of the yellow fever, which are proved to rest merely on conjectures, suppositions, and vague reports. But in regard to the origin of the pestilence in Holland, in this instance, it is wholly immaterial, whether popular opinion was well founded or not; for we have the express authority of Diemerbroeck, that anterior to the arrival of the ship, with the supposed infec∣tion, the plague broke out in Heusden, a town on a branch of the Meuse, surrounded by a morass, not a maritime place. Be∣sides the spotted fever, which precedes the plague and turns into it, had been prevailing in all parts of Holland in the preceding year. The pestilence therefore originated in Holland, <HI>before the infection arrived;</HI> and the tales of importation vanish in smoke.</P>
<P>According to the bills of mortality, London lost upwards of 68,000 inhabitants by the plague in 1665, and more than 28,000 by other diseases. As the 28,000 deaths by common diseases must have occurred mostly in the six first months of the year, before the plague raged, this circumstance shows what a great increase of mortality preceded the plague. With such evidence before their eyes, how can discerning men look abroad for the sources of the malady!</P>
<P>It should also be remarked that this calamity among the hu∣man race was preceded by a great mortality among cattle in 1664.</P>
<P>It must not pass unobserved that the summer of 1665 in Eng∣land was very temperate, the weather fine and the fruits good. All the writers of that day agree, that no cause of pestilence could be observed in the visible qualities of the season.</P>
<P>This was the last plague that has appeared in London, or in Great Britain. The disappearance of the plague in that and other countries, is a most consoling fact, and one that has not a little engaged the minds of philosophic men, to discover the
<PB N="201" REF="036687_0205_100AA28006B23FA8"/>
cause. The causes usually assigned are, the destruction of the city by fire in 1666, the more airy, convenient construction of the modern city, the introduction of fresh water, with more cleanliness, and improved habits of living.</P>
<P>These reasons would have more weight in my mind, if the other large cities in England, in France, Spain, Holland and Germany, which have neither been burnt nor improved in their general structure, had not also escaped the ravages of pestilence. But as the plague has not visited Paris and Amsterdam, which retain their ancient construction, no more than London, which has been improved, we must resort to other circumstances for the causes of this exemption. The consideration of this subject will fall under another part of this work.</P>
<P>In 1666, appeared a comet, the summer was very hot, and a tremendous hurricane, tore up a thousand trees in Nottingham forest, and of 50 houses in one village, seven only were left standing. In this tempest fell hail-stones, as large as hens eggs. An earthquake occurred in Oxfordshire. Persia did not escape the effects of this pestilential constitution. In 1667 prevailed famin and epidemic diseases, and an earthquake demolished great part of Teflis, the capital of Georgia, and four villages, with the loss of 30,000 lives; and another city with the loss of 2,000 lives.</P>
<BIBL>Chardin's travels, 86. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>26.</BIBL>
<P>In 1666 dysentery prevailed over England and many parts of Europe and in St. Domingo. This disease seems to be the suc∣cessor of the plague, and other epidemics. During the inflam∣matory stage of an epidemic constitution, evidenced by measles, influenza, a mild small-pox, we rarely hear of destructive dysen∣tery. But after those diseases have run their course, dysentery appears in many parts of a country, and sometimes becomes al∣most universal. It would be a curious question, by what means the inflammatory diathesis, so to speak, of the epidemic period, acts upon the nerves, muscles and intestines, to give to the sub∣sequent autumnal fevers this particular direction.</P>
<P>During the foregoing series of epidemics in Europe, America did not escape. Slight shocks of earthquake were felt in 1660,
<PB N="202" REF="036687_0206_100AA28343575CA8"/>
and in 1665. Great sickness prevailed at this period also, but I am not informed of the species of disorder, except the small∣pox in Boston in 1666.</P>
<P>In 1668, appeared a comet with a stupendous coma. This was attended by an excessively hot summer, and malignant dis∣eases in America. In New-York the epidemic was so fatal, that a fast was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ppointed in September, on that account. This was undoubtedly the autumnal bilious fever in its infectious form. In this same year was an earthquake in America, and a meteor in the west, in form of a spear, pointing towards the sitting sun, which greadually sunk and disappeared.</P>
<BIBL>Neal's Hist. vol. 1. 367. Magnal. b. 4. 184.</BIBL>
<P>This year was marked also by violent earthquakes in Europe and Asia. The winter of 1668-9 was very severe, and ice was seen in the Bosphorus; that of 1670 covered the Danube with a bridge of ice.</P>
<P>In winter appeared in Hungary two mock-suns of resplendent brightness—the infallible forerunner of great discharges of elec∣trical fire, or of violent tempests.—On the 11th of March 1669, the eruption of Etna which had commenced in 1664 redoubled its fury, and by immense discharges of lava laid waste the coun∣try below. Its violence subsided in July; but tremendous hurri∣canes marked the year. The summer of this year also was ex∣cessively hot.</P>
<P>In this year, the cats in Westphalia died with an eruption on the head, accompanied with drowsiness. In England prevailed a dangerous fever, with slimy tongue and sore mouth.</P>
<P>In Norway prevailed measles of a malignant kind, attacking old and young. Bonetus, Med. Sept. 223.—In the two fol∣lowing years measles was epidemic in London alternating with the small-pox.—See Sydenham.—In 1673 winter was cold; and catarrhs were frequent with spotted fevers—A comet appeared in the preceding year.</P>
<P>In 1675 a wet and cool summer, the influenza prevailed in Europe with the usual symptoms. In Italy was seen a meteor or fire ball, from the north-east; and the following winter in America was colder than usual.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="036687_0207_100AA285AF424440"/>The summer of 1676 in England was cold. Measles and small-pox prevailed in some places.</P>
<P>In 1677 was seen a comet in April and May; an earthquake was experienced in England; and in Charlestown, Massachu∣setts, raged the small-pox with the mortality of a plague.</P>
<BIBL>Mag. b. 4. 189.</BIBL>
<P>The summer of 1678 was very hot and dry. There was a comet and an earthquake in Lima. Fevers and affections of the throat were epidemic in the north of Europe. The plague raged with most desolating fury in Algiers and Morocco. Authors re∣late that four millions of people perished, and that the waste of population has not since been repaired.</P>
<BIBL>Cheniers Morocco, vol. 2. 180.</BIBL>
<P>On the 12th of January occurred in England a most extraor∣dinary darkness, at noon.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the barrenness of my materials, this pestilen∣tial period may be very clearly distinguished, by the measles from 1669 to 1672 with the small-pox, the catarrh of 1675, the subsequent malignant fevers and affections of the throat, and finally the pestilence of 1678.</P>
<P>The same deleterious principle extended to America. Our annals relate that the seasons were unfavorable and the fruits blasted, while malignant diseases prevailed among the people. The sickness and bad seasons were attributed, by our pious an∣cestors, to the irreligion of the times, and to their disuse of fast∣ing. On this occasion, a synod was convened to investigate the causes of God's judgments, and to propose a plan of reforma∣tion. The small-pox prevailed at Boston in 1678, and a singu∣lar epidemic in England, France and Holland.</P>

<P>The comet of 1678 was followed by a very cold winter, after a rainy autumn, with an epidemic cough. A comet is mention∣ed in 1679, and the plague was in Vienna.</P>
<P>The year 1680 was distinguished also for a severe winter, and the noted comet that had appeared in Justinian's reign. In Dresden raged the plague. The summer was hot and sickly.
<PB N="204" REF="036687_0208_100AA2882B035E28"/>
A large meteor was seen in Germany, descending to the north and leaving behind it a long luminous stream.</P>
<P>The summer of 1681 was excessively dry. This was the forerunner of violent earthquakes, which, in 1682 shook all Germany, Italy and Switzerland. In some places, the shocks were preceeded, for four nights, by lights or flame, like ignes fatui, on the mountains. The convulsions were attended with a disagreeable sulphurous smell. In this year also was visible a comet, and an eruption took place, both of Etna and Vesuvius.</P>
<P>In this year 1682 a mortal disease spread among the cattle in Italy, Switzerland and Germany, that was called the angina ma∣ligna, and of which cattle died in 24 hours. Authors relate that a blue mist appeared on the herbage of pastures. The dis∣ease moved about two German miles in 24 hours, and spread over Germany and Poland. Cattle at rack and manger were affected equally with those that grazed.</P>
<P>At Halle in Saxony prevailed the plague; and at Dublin, a petechial in which the brain was severely affected, and bleeding pernicious.</P>
<P>The discharges of fire already mentioned were productive, as usual, of violent winds. In Sicily, a tempest, preceded by great darkness, almost laid waste the island.</P>
<P>In 1683 was an earthquake in England, in September, pre∣ceded by meteors or lights and fetid exhalations. A comet ap∣peared in this year, and another in the following.</P>
<P>The winter of 1683-4 was the coldest that could be recol∣lected by the oldest men living. Trees of large size split with the frost. The same winter was excessively severe in America, and from a passage in a letter of the Rev. John Eliot, the sea∣son appears to have been sickly.</P>
<BIBL>Hist. Col. vol. 3.</BIBL>
<P>The year 1683 was also remarkable for general sickness in Connecticut, and in some places, unusual mortality. Some towns suffered by excessive rains.</P>
<BIBL>Trumbull's Hist. p. 383.</BIBL>
<P>These unusual seasons were accompanied with singular diseases. In Leyden in 1683 prevailed what was called the hungry fever, which came on with a chill, succeeded by ravenous hunger.
<PB N="205" REF="036687_0209_100AA289DD18DA40"/>
To gratify this appetite was fatal. When the hot fit came on, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unger subsided. In 1684 was a terrible earthquake in St. Domingo.</P>
<BIBL>Description of St. Domingo, vol. 1. 142.</BIBL>
<P>After the severe frost in 1684, a malignant dysentery raged over Europe. This and the two succeeding summers were hot and dry. In 1685 Languedoc in France was overrun by grass∣hoppers, and the petechial fever was prevalent.</P>
<P>In September 1686 was seen a comet. At Lille in France, fell a storm of hail, the stones of which were of a pound weight. There was an eruption of Etna, in this year also, and a meteor was seen at Leipsick on the 9th of July, which was stationary for 7 minutes, at the height of 30 miles. It is curious to re∣mark the coincidence in time between the phenomena of the electrical fluid, tempests, snow and hail.</P>
<P>The summer of 1687 in Europe was very rainy. In Octo∣ber the city of Lima in Peru, was demolished by an earthquake.</P>
<P>The winter of 1688 was cold, and in the summer following epidemic catarrh spread over Europe. This was preceded by a disease of the same species among horses, attended with a de∣fluxion of rheum from their noses. Swarms of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsects in some countries announced a pestilential period. In the interior of Germany were some dysenteries. An earthquake was experi∣enced at Naples, and Smyrna was laid in ruins.</P>
<P>In 1689 appeared a comet, and both Etna and Vesuvius dis∣charged fire. The autumn was very rainy, and the spotted fe∣ver prevailed in some parts of Germany. In Boston the small-pox was epidemic.</P>
<P>In 1690 the summer was rainy, frogs were in unusual numbers in Italy, and corn was cut short by mildew. Rainy seasons gen∣erally succeed great eruptions of volcanoes and earthquakes.</P>
<P>The year 1691 commenced with severe frost, followed by a hot dry summer. The spotted fever prevailed in Italy, in which bleeding was fatal. There was also great mortality among cat∣tle and sheep.</P>
<P>The seasons in this year were peculiarly unfavorable in Amer∣ica, altho I am not able to describe them. It appears from the journals of the assembly of New-York, that upon an address of
<PB N="206" REF="036687_0210_100AA28CE0A51DE0"/>
the house to the governor and council, a monthly fast was ap∣pointed to be observed from September 1691 to June 1692; the special reasons assigned for which were, "a burthensome war, and a blast upon the corn." This is a remarkable fact, and not unfrequent, that at one and the same time, the powers of veget∣ation fail in the most distant parts of the earth. Perhaps we shall be able to account for this instance of a deranged state of the elements by the universal explosions of fire in the two fol∣lowing years. St. Domingo experienced a severe earthquake in 1691, in the year of this blast on the corn.</P>
<BIBL>Description of St. Domingo, by Moreau St. Mery, vol. 1. 142.</BIBL>
<P>On the 7th of June 1692 after a series of dry, hot, calm weather, a most dreadful earthquake suddenly sunk the town of Port-Royal in Jamaica, and demolished most of the buildings on the island, with the loss of 2000 lives. After the earthquake, the heat was still more intense, musquetoes were innumerable, and a malignant fever fell upon the inhabitants in all parts of the island, with which 3000 perished.</P>
<P>In the same year, a similar disease invaded Barbadoes, and afflicted the island for many years. Indeed the whole world was sickly.</P>
<P>On the 8th of September England, Holland, France and Germany were convulsed by an earthquake, and Switzerland felt a shock in October. In the same year was an eruption of Etna, and great snows followed.</P>
<P>The spotted fever continued its ravages; and it was remarked to be much more malignant and fatal in the wane of the moon. During an eclipse in 1693 the sick almost all died. The disease was more fatal in town than country.</P>
<P>I have no account of the diseases in Egypt or the Levant, during this period; but it will be found on examination that great pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ilence raged in those places, about this time, or between 1639 and 169<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P>On the 10th of January 1693 happened a most terrible earth∣quake in Sicily and Naples. On the preceding evening, was observed a great flame or light, apparently at the distance of an Italian mile, and so bright as to be m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en for a fire. The spectators attempted to approach it; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> appeared still at the
<PB N="207" REF="036687_0211_100AA28F27F32470"/>
same distance. As soon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the earth began to shake, the flame disappeares.</P>
<P>It is not within my limits to enumerate the miseries occasioned by this concussion of the earth. Suffice it say that many towns were laid in ruins and 60,000 people perished. During the con∣vulsion a fountain discharged its waters as red as blood. This calamity was preceded by a serene sky, and followed by dark∣ness or vapor of a reddish or yellow hue.</P>
<P>The effects of this earthquake were remarkable on the human body. Among these were malignant fevers, small-pox fatal among children; madness, dullness, sottishness and melancholy, with deliria and lethargy. Are not these effects produced by an excess of stimulus, occasioned by the superabundance of electricity?</P>
<P>The summer following this convulsion of the earth, was in∣temperately wet and cool, and corn was mildewed. Another account says the summer in Italy was very hot and dry. The spotted fever, and in some places dysentery were very morta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Wounds degenerated into ulcers, and blisters were followed by mortification which proved fatal to many.</P>
<P>In this year also Etna in Sicily, and Heckla in Iceland dis∣charged fire and lava; a new volcano was opened in Asia, and an island, called Sorea, near the Moluccas, was ruined by its volcano.</P>
<P>Most dreadful storms marked the same year; one in America, on the 19th of October, was memorable for its violence.</P>
<P>An epidemic catarrh began in Europe in October, being pre∣ceded by a similar disease among horses.</P>
<P>The preceding winter was probably very mild in America; for on the 13th of February, Gov. Fletcher, with a body of troops, sailed from New-York for Albany.</P>
<BIBL>Smith's Hist. New-York, 82.</BIBL>
<P>In 1693 the seamen and soldiers, under Sir Francis Wheeler, who was sent to conquer Martinico, were seized with the plague of America, and three fourths of them perished. Hutchinson, vol. 2. 72, relates that this fleet came to Boston and introduced the disease into that town, where it occasioned a deplorable mor∣tality. Douglas relates the same fact.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="036687_0212_100AA29160408FB0"/>This account seems to be contradicted by Mather, in his Mag∣nalia, b. 1. 22. In a sermon delivered on lecture day, April 7, 1698, it is asserted in so many words, that "An English squadron hath <HI>not</HI> brought among us the tremendous pestilence, under which a <HI>neighboring plantation</HI> hath undergone prodigious desolations. Boston, 'tis a marvellous thing a plague has <HI>not</HI> laid thee desolate."</P>
<P>By comparing the date of this sermon, with other events re∣lated in it, I find there is no mistake in the date; and as the author lived in Boston, and was cotemporary with these events, and personally acquainted with Sir Francis Wheeler, I conclude it was not Boston, but some other sea port town, which suffered by the arrival of a fleet.</P>
<P>In the 2d book of Magnalia, p. 71, the same author men∣tions this expedition and the terrible mortality. He says the distemper was "the most like the plague, of any thing that had ever been seen in America, whereof there died <HI>before the fleet could reach to Boston,</HI> as I was told by Sir Francis himself, 1300 sailors out of 2100, and 1800 soldiers out of 2400."</P>
<P>In book 7. 116, the same author says, "there was an En∣glish fleet of our good friends with a direful plague aboard <HI>in∣tending hither.</HI> Had they come, as they intended, what an horrible desolation had cut us off, let the desolate places, <HI>that some of you have seen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the colonies of the south,</HI> declare unto us. <HI>And that they did not come was the signal hand of heaven.</HI>" This passage is in a lecture preached on the 27th of September, 1698.</P>
<P>From this authentic history, written by a cotemporary clergy∣man, we infer that Hutchinson must have made a mistake. Sir Francis Wheeler's fleet arrived at Boston, most dreadfully in∣fected, but no disease was propagated in Boston. Some other fleet, it seems, had introduced the disease into a "colony of the south," perhaps Newport or New-York, but I have no in∣formation on the subject.</P>
<P>The great discharges of fire and earthquakes of 1693, were followed, as usual, by an intensely cold winter. The succeed∣ing summer of 1694 was not and excessively dry in Italy, till October, when the earth was deluged with rain.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="036687_0213_100AA292FA6B1018"/>In May was a violent earthquake and volcano in Banda, an island in the Indian seas. Fire issued from the neighboring seas, the air was impregnated with the smell of sulphur, and sickness prevailed. An eruption of Vesuvius happened the same year, and violent earthquakes in Sicily and Calabria. In this year the agitations of fire seem to have subsided; and as usual, a series of rainy cool summers succeeded, in which corn perished or was blasted, crops failed, and universal dearth ensued.</P>
<P>One of the most remarkable effects of the late agitations of the elements, was the frequency of apoplexies in Italy. So common were they in 1695, as to be called epidemic, and oc∣casion general consternation. This is not an infrequent conse∣quence of the high excitement that takes place in pestilential times, ending in extreme debility in the brain. Something of this kind has been observed in America, within the last few years.</P>
<P>I have very few facts in regard to the seasons and diseases in America, during this period, from 1689 to 1695. It appears however that the disorders of the elements were experienced in America.</P>
<P>In 1695 prevailed a mortal sickness among the Indians in the eastern parts of this continent.</P>
<BIBL>Hutch. vol. 2. 87.</BIBL>
<P>A contagious fever prevailed in Bermuda, the same year.</P>
<P>In Europe many malignant fevers prevailed, but no epidemics, except measles and chin cough of a bad type. In Ireland ap∣peared offensive fogs, a thick clammy dew on the herbage, of a yellow color, and consistence of butter. A similar substance was observed at Middletown, Connecticut, on the morning after the earthquake, May 17, 1791.</P>
<P>The year 1696 was cool and wet—summer in Britain, resem∣bled winter, and winter was like summer. Corn was mildewed. Dysentery fatal among children.</P>
<P>In America the winter of 1696-7, according to Hutchinson, was very severe. Loaded sleds passed from Boston to Nantasket. Food was scarce and losses at sea very great. I am not without suspicions however, that the author has here described the fol∣lowing winter, which was as severe as he has represented it.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="036687_0214_100AA294B17ADAD8"/>In 1697 the weather in Europe was mostly cool. An earth∣quake at Lima in Peru shook the country with terrible violence.</P>
<P>In a diary kept by Daniel Fairfield, of Braintree, in Massa∣chusetts, an unlettered man of good understanding, I have a particular description of an influenza that prevailed in America in the severe winter of 1697-8.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For this and many other articles of intelligence, I am indebted to the late Dr. Jeremy Belknap, whose value as a man and as a historian many years friendship and correspondence had taught me to appreciate, and whose loss to society and the republic of letters, I most deeply la∣ment.</NOTE> This catarrh began in No∣vember and prevailed till February. Its violence was in Janu∣ary, when whole families were sick at once, and whole towns were seized nearly at the same time. It appears to have been an epidemic of the severe kind; and the epidemics which fol∣lowed it in America were of correspondent severity.</P>
<P>In the same winter a mortal disease raged in the town of Fairfield in Connecticut, which was so general, that well per∣sons could scarcely be found to tend the sick and bury the dead. Seventy persons were buried in three months, altho it may be doubted whether the town then contained 1000 inhabitants.</P>

<P>This disease was doubtless that species of inflammatory fever, attacking the brain and ending in typhus, which has often pro∣ved a terrible scourge to particular parts of America, during the rage of pestilence in the east, and of other epidemics in this country. We shall hear of it in the following century, and especially in 1761.</P>
<P>On the 20th of June 1698 the town of Latacunga, in the province of Quito, nearly under the equator, was laid in ruins by an earthquake, as were Riobamba, Hambato and other towns in the same district. In one place a chasm of five feet broad and a league in length, was opened, and on a mountain happened a volcanic eruption, from which issued ashes, cinders and flames.</P>
<BIBL>Ulloa, vol. 2.</BIBL>
<P><PB N="211" REF="036687_0215_100AA298ADA62840"/>The malignant fever already mentioned, whatever might have been its precise symptoms, was soon followed by more general sickness. In 1699 raged in Charleston South-Carolina and in Philadelphia, the most deadly bilious plague that probably ever affected the people of this country.</P>
<P>Mr. Norris of Philadelphia has kindly favored me with a sight of a number of M. S. letters of his grand-father Isaac Norris, written during the sickness, to his correspondents. This worthy gentleman was then in trade, and well acquainted with the facts respecting the disease, as his own family suffered a loss of several of its members.</P>
<P>In a letter dated August 15, 1699, he mentions, that a ma∣lignant fever broke out about the beginning of August, which he describes as the "Barbadoes distemper," tho he gives no intimations of its being communicated from countries abroad by infection. He says the patients "vomited and voided blood."</P>
<P>On the 24th of August, arrived the Britannia from Liver∣pool, which had been 13 weeks on her passage; she had 200 passengers on board—had lost fifty by death, and others were sickly.</P>
<P>September 1st, he writes that the distemper appeared to abate at one time, but afterwards revived. He mentions the summer to be the hottest he ever knew; men died at harvest in the field. All business in the city was suspended.</P>
<P>During the yearly meeting the disease abated, but the meeting was thinly attended. Afterwards the disease returned in all its violence.</P>
<P>October 9th, he writes that he had hoped the cool weather would have relieved the city, but it did not.</P>
<P>October 22d, the disease had abated. Of this epidemic, died two hundred and twenty, of whom eighty or ninety be∣longed to the society of friends.</P>
<P>The population of Philadelphia at this time, is not exactly ascertained; but as the city had been settled but seventeen years, the number of people could not have been great. If we con∣sider that the city was thinly inhabited, and that no considera∣ble artificial causes of disease had been accumulated; together
<PB N="212" REF="036687_0216_100AA29A7AED28C8"/>
with the fact of the patient's vomiting and voiding blood, we must admit the disease to have been extremely virulent, beyond any thing that has marked its returns in subsequent periods.</P>
<P>In the same letters, Mr. Norris, October 18th, mentions that he had information from Charleston of the great mortality by the same fever—150 had died in a few days, and the survivors mostly fled into the country.</P>
<P>In a history of South-Carolina, lately published, there is a more particular account of the calamities that befel Charleston in this year 1699. A most dreadful tempest, a common event after excessive heat, threatened a total destruction of the town. The sea swelled and rushed violently into the town, compelling the people to fly to the tops of their houses for safety. A fire broke out and laid most of the town in ashes. The small-pox proved fatal to many of the youth, and to fill the cup of calam∣ity, the bilious plague broke out with such irresistible mortality, that the principal officers of government, one half of the mem∣bers of assembly and multitudes of the citizens fell victims. These calamities came near to dissolve the settlement.</P>
<BIBL>Hist. of S. Carolina, vol. 1. 142.</BIBL>
<P>I find no suggestion that any vessels had arrived from the West-Indies at these places, or that any suspicion existed of the im∣portation of this terrible disease. At that time, there was very little intercourse directly between Philadelphia or Charleston and the West-Indies.</P>
<P>But it will be remarked, that the disease first appeared about the "beginning of August," as in modern times—that it once abated, as it did in New-York, both in 1795 and 6, so as to be extinguished in the latter year, and that for two or three weeks.—That in 1699 as in later returns of it, it yielded not to cool weather, until late in October. It will be further re∣marked, that a severe epidemic catarrh preceded this plague, about eighteen months, as it did in 1789-90.</P>
<P>During this period, other parts of the earth did not escape affliction. A comet appeared in 1698 and another small one in 1699; and in this latter year, Lima suffered considerable damage by an earthquake, as did some parts of Batavia in the East-Indies.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="036687_0217_100AA29E1C661C70"/>In October 1698 began a fatal spotted fever to prevail over all England. In the spring of 1699 a severe and fatal catarrh was epide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ic, which carried off the young and robust, together with hard drinkers. A cough was epidemic among horses in England and France. In this period the catarrh in America preceded that in Europe, one whole year.</P>
<P>The seven last years of this century, the period under con∣sideration, were distinguished for a severe and continued famin in Scotland. The general cause was, the wet and cold sum∣mers which prevented crops from arriving to maturity. Vast multi∣tudes perished with hunger—the dead bodies lay scattered along the highways. See Sinclair's Statistical account of Scotland in a great number of passages, and especially vol. 6. 132, 189. It does not appear that, during this long period of distress and want, any pestilence prevailed in Scotland.</P>
<P>At the same time, famin afflicted Finland and carried off one tenth of the inhabitants, and a greater proportion in the less fertile provinces of Sweden.</P>
<BIBL>Williams's Obs. on North Governments, vol. 1. 638.</BIBL>
<P>The same period was remarkable for failure of crops in A∣merica. In a sermon preached in Boston on Lecture Day, Sept. 27, 1698, we have the following account of this subject. "The harvest hath once and again grievously failed, in these years, and we have been struck through with terrible famin.— The very course of nature hath been altered among us; a la∣mentable cry for <HI>bread, bread,</HI> hath been heard in our streets."</P>
<BIBL>Magnalia b. 7. 113.</BIBL>
<P>In the preceding page, of this sermon, it is also remarked, that "Epidemical sicknesses have, in these years, been once and again upon us," and it is mentioned that Boston lost, in one year, six or seven hundred of its people, by one contagious dis∣ease. The year is not specified.</P>
<P>It will be observed that in the history of the last two centu∣ries few instances of the plague in Egypt and the Levant are mentioned. The reason is, that I have no regular series of ac∣counts of plague in Egypt or Constantinople, for the last two or three hundred years. One remark however I will hazard, on
<PB N="214" REF="036687_0218_100AA2A10CE24F30"/>
the strength of facts within the present century, that whenever malignant epidemics prevail generally in Europe or America, the plague ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es in Egypt and Constantinople, or rather a little before; the commencement of the pestilential state of air in those unhealthy cities being a little anterior to its principal ef∣fects in the north of Europe.</P>
<P>At the time of the dreadful bilious plague in Philadelphia and Charleston just before described, the plague was raging in the Levant, and for a year or two after.</P>
<P>During this period, in 1700, the same pestilential constitu∣tion displayed itself in a most destructive sore throat in the island of Milo, in the Levant. It is thus described by Tournefort, vol. 1. let. 4. He says it appeared in a "Carbuncle or plague∣sore in the bottom of the throat, attended with a violent fever." It carried off children in two days, but spared adults. He calls it the "child's plague." There appears to be some pro∣priety in giving the disease this appellation. It has some resem∣blance to the true pestis, the ulcer being formed in the throat in∣stead of the glands. The insidiousness of the distemper is another circumstance of resemblance—persons in both diseases often walking about, a few hours before they expire. But this is a most prominent fact, that the ulcerous sore throat, or ma∣lignant anginas are rarely or never epidemic, except in periods when the plague and yellow fever prevail in places where they usually appear. In no instance has the sore throat been epidemic in America, except when the plague has been raging in Egypt and Constantinople. At least I can find no exception to this remark; and what is more, the virulence of the one disease in one country, corresponds with the malignity of the other disease in the other countries. Thus, as the plague in Egypt in 1736, was far more destructive than the same disease, at other times, so was the angina maligna of that period in America.</P>
<P>When observation and philosophy shall prevail over the preju∣dices of men in regard to the origin of these diseases from in∣fection, it will be found that the angina, in its various forms, is only a particular stage or modification of the pestilence, which spreads over the world at certain unequal periods. The milder
<PB N="215" REF="036687_0219_100AA2A295973CA8"/>
forms of the pestilence appear in catarrh, measles and chin cough; which usually appear together, or nearly so, at the beginning of the more virulent general contagion; the later and more fatal stages are marked by anginas, cynanche maligna, petechial fe∣ver, bilious and glandular plague in summer; and pestilential pleurisies in winter.</P>
<P>There are certain times, when the constitutions of men in all parts of the world, contract a poison, which nature makes an effort to expel; and the different epidemics that accompany or follow each other, in rapid succession, appear to be the differ∣ent modes by which nature strives to rid the human body of the virus. These modes depend on the season of the year, the con∣stitution or age of the patient and a multitude of subordinate circumstances.—Whether this poison is a positive substance in∣haled by the lungs and pores, or is the effect of mere debility, which unfits the several parts of the body to perform their func∣tions, is a question of a curious nature.</P>
<P>It is remarkable that in this year 1700, when this ulcerous sore throat was raging in the Levant Isles, small children in the north of Europe were seized with a suffocating catarrh or catarrh∣ous fevers. These were followed by mild epidemic measles.</P>
<BIBL>Short vol. 1. 418.</BIBL>
<P>In the same year the small-pox was confluent and malignant. The winter of 1700 was very mild.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VII. Historical view of pestilential epidemics from the year <HI>1701</HI> to <HI>1788.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE year 1701 appears to have been excessively dry in America. Dr. Rush relates that during the dry summer of 1782, a rock in the Skuylkill appeared above the surface of the water, on which were engraven the figures 1701. How little do men suspect the value of this inscription! To this alone I am indebted for the fact of extreme drouth in that year—and the fact is among the proofs of an extraordinary evaporation, before dis∣charges of fire and lava from volcanoes. In 1701 was an erup∣tion of Vesuvius; in 1702 of Etna. It will hereafter appear that a similar dry season in 1782 preceded the great eruption of Heckla in 1783. Indeed it is a general fact, and as far as I can learn, such seasons seldom occur, except during the approach of comets, or antecedent to volcanic eruptions.</P>
<P>This was a pestilential period. In 1701 Toulon lost two thirds of its inhabitants by the plague, and the Levant was se∣verely affected about the same time. See the bills of mortality for Augsburg, Dresden and Boston.</P>
<P>In 1702 appeared a comet; Etna discharged its fires, and in Boston raged a malignant small-pox, attended, in many cases, with a scarlet eruption, which was mistaken for the scarlet fever. It appears from Fairfield's diary that this disease appeared in June and was at first mild, not fatal to any of the patients. In August died one patient—in September it became very mortal, and in this month was attended with a "sort of fever called scarlet fever." In October, many died of the "fever and the small-pox, and it was a time of sore distress," on which account the general court sat at Cambridge. In December "the fever
<PB N="217" REF="036687_0221_100AA2A6A8E87538"/>
abated;" but the small-pox continued to be mortal, till the month of February 1703, when it began to subside.</P>
<P>I have already remarked that eruptive diseases seem to belong to one family. Physicians will observe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he alliance in their symp∣toms; but I would observe that the progressiveness in this disease of 1702 and the variations in its symptoms, prove it to have been an epidemic, and not the effect of mere infection, or spe∣cific contagion.</P>
<P>In this year also the drouth was extreme. In New-York ra∣ged the American plague, which was said to have been imported from St. Thomas's. By the accounts, this was more fatal than any disease since that period. It was called the "Great Sick∣ness" and hardly a patient survived. On account of it, the assembly was held at Jamaica on Long-Island.</P>
<BIBL>Smith's Hist. N. York, p. 104. Journals of Assembly, vol. 1. 151.</BIBL>
<P>Such were the epidemics in America which followed the in∣fluenza of 1698—malignant pleurisies in 1698—plague in 1699 and in 1702, with virulent small-pox—all of unusual severity. Let the reader compare these facts with the accounts from Eu∣rope and the bills of mortality.</P>
<P>The winter of 1702-3 was variable—severe frost and great snows, with intervals of warm weather. In spring catarrh prevail∣ed in England, followed by a sickly summer, with earthquakes.</P>
<P>In January and February 1703 were severe shocks of earth∣quake in Rome, Naples and other parts of Italy. In October a memorable tempest or hurricane, which did great damage at sea, and injured buildings on land.</P>
<P>In 1704 the summer was very dry, and a most malignant spotted fever raged in Augsburg and in Prussia. Flies were in great abundance, and there was an eruption of Vesuvius. The last eruption of the volcano in Teneriffe was in this year, since which it has discharged smoke, but no fire.</P>
<P>Note. A late arrival from Teneriffe brings an account of the bursting forth of a volcano, in June last, which continued, till the vessel left the island in August.</P>
<P>In December 1705 were many most violent tempests and in∣undations. The tide rose in the Loir in France 25 feet beyond
<PB N="218" REF="036687_0222_100AA2A910457B48"/>
its usual height. Half of Limerick in Ireland was laid under water. These storms indicated the approach of a comet, which appeared in the following year.</P>
<P>In 1706 coughs and coryzas prevailed, and dysentery fatal among children.</P>
<P>A small shock of earthquake was felt in America in 1705.</P>
<P>In 1707 appeared another comet and subterranean fire was uncommonly agitated. Vesuvius discharged fire, and a new island was thrown up in the Archipelago, with an earthquake and volcano. The seasons in this and the following year were variable.</P>
<BIBL>Buffon's Nat. Hist.</BIBL>
<P>In November 1708 began a most severe and universal catarrh in Europe, which was speedily followed by a series of pestilen∣tial diseases. Of this catarrh, of the seasons, and the plagues that followed we have from Europe very correct accounts; but, with the utmost industry, I cannot learn whether the catarrh extended to America.</P>
<P>The explosion of subterranean fire in various places in 1707 seems to have been the commencement of this period; altho there was a plague in the eastern parts of Europe, most of the preceding years from 1700. A meteor passed over England, near the mouth of the Thames, July 31, 1708, a few months before the catarrh.</P>
<P>The winter of 1708-9 was the severest that had happened, af∣ter 1683-4. But it appears that the catarrh commenced two months before the severe cold began. At least this epidemic appeared in the north of Europe, as early as November; whereas the autumn was one of the mildest, till January, that was ever known. Then the weather changed sudde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly to most severe cold and continued for a number of weeks.</P>
<BIBL>Short, vol. 1. Lancisius, p. 194 and seq.</BIBL>
<P>This catarrh is carefully described by Lanci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ius as it appeared in Italy. In Rome it commenced in January, but increased afterwards, as the cold abated. It began with coryza, rheumata and slight cough, and was attended with pains in the breast, angina, pleurisies and peripneumonies, which prevailed greatly in the spring, among those who neglected the cough, or used a full diet.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="036687_0223_100AA2AC1CEA2150"/>Symptoms of this catarrh were, lassitude, fever with chills, wandering pains in the breast, continued cough, hard pulse, flame-colored or turbid urine, spitting of blood and difficult res∣piration. The cheeks were red and the body suffured with a yellow color, like that of the jaundice.</P>
<P>Persons shut up in prison, escaped the disease.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This has been observed in one or two instances in America, and has been alledged as an evidence that the influenza is an infectious dis∣ease, and that persons sequestered from contagion, may escape it. To my mind the fact is rather an evidence that the escape of prisoners is owing to a different, perhaps a less stimulant condition of the air they breathe. It is hardly possible they should escape exposure to infection, when every one around them is affected. The contagion of the disease however is not denied.</NOTE> Fewer wo∣men than men were afflicted, and persons in easy circumstances, who could take care of themselves, suffered less than the poor. Many recovered by means of sweats or hemorrhagy at the nose, or discharges from the bowels, or copious discharges of urine, or by all these evacuations, accompanied by spitting a thick phlegm. Venesection was beneficial, especially in robust consti∣tutions. On dissection, the precordia appeared of a reddish color, extending to the diaphragm—and discolored by spots of blackish thick blood—polypusses were discovered in the great ves∣sels of the heart.</P>
<P>This disease did not entirely disappear till June.</P>
<P>In the summer of 1708 preceding the severe winter and ca∣tarrh, gnats appeared in prodigious swarms.</P>
<P>The winter of 1708-9 killed fruit-trees, vines and corn. After this excessive cold, multitudes of people died of apoplex∣ies, and others were seized with vertigoes, arthritics, pleurisies, inflammatory fevers of all kinds, and consumptions. This se∣verity of cold extended over America as well as Europe, in the same winter.</P>
<P>A pestilence raged in the north of Europe from the years 1702 to 1711, of which we have an account in Philosophical Transactions, No. 337.</P>
<BIBL>Baddam's Memoirs, vol. 6. p. 5.</BIBL>
<P>It has been observed already that the plague raged in the Le∣vant, in the first years of the present century. In 1702, the same year, it will be noted, in which the terrible small-pox raged
<PB N="220" REF="036687_0224_100AA2ADA65D6558"/>
in Boston and bilious plague in New-York, the plague broke out in Poland, near Pickzow, soon after an unfortunate battle be∣tween the Swedes and Saxons. No suggestion appears that the disease was caught by infection from a distant country, nor that the fetor of dead carcases was supposed to generate the distem∣per. On these important points we are left in the dark. All that is recorded is, that it <HI>first began</HI> near Pickzow in Poland, soon after a battle. It spread in 1703, 4 and 5 over Poland, and into parts of Hungary and Russia, sweeping away vast num∣bers of inhabitants. In 1706 we hear nothing of it. In 1707 it broke out in Warsaw, with great mortality. In 1708 it ap∣peared in Thorn, and parts of Polish Prussia.</P>
<P>This approach of the disease alarmed the people of Dantzick —public prayers were ordered in the churches—all commerce and communication with infected places were forbid—no mer∣chandize from infected or suspected places was permitted to enter the city, and the magistrates neglected no measure that could guard the public safety. All travellers and strangers were strict∣ly examined, and none permitted to enter without sufficient proofs that they came from healthy and uninfected places. These and other strict regulations were enjoined in July 1708; but notwithstanding these precautions, "the distemper gradually insinuated itself, for in March 1709, there died out of one dis∣trict in the old town seven persons, and another person, being ill, was sent to the hospital, where the disease soon spread." Dr. Gottwald, the author of this account, visited the hospital on the 16th of the same month, and found many persons ill—"some had buboes, others carbuncles, others gangrenous ulcers, which he could not determin to be pestilential, but which he judged to be symptoms, if not of the plague already commenced, at <HI>least of something, but little inferior to it, and certain forerunners of that destructive distemper.</HI>"</P>
<P>In the preceding account, we observe the utter insufficiency of laws and regulations to prevent the introduction of the plague into cities; and the uncertainty of physicians at first as to the nature of the disease. The facts stated prove the disease to have been generated on the spot, and to have been <HI>progressive</HI> from
<PB N="221" REF="036687_0225_100AA2AF2E0C21B8"/>
malignant fevers to the real plague. I have no bills of the mor∣tality in Dantzick for the preceding years, but if any such are on record, it will appear, that the approach of the plague was indicated in that city by malignant diseases and increased mortal∣ity, for some months or perhaps a year or two preceding.</P>
<P>The disease spread slowly at first, but in July and August be∣came general—it was at its height in September, and gradually declined till the close of the year. The number of victims was nearly 25,000.</P>
<P>From the very accurate history of this pestilence by Dr. Gottwald, the following circumstances are to be collected.</P>
<P N="1">1st. That the distemper first made its appearance in a part of the old town, called Raumbaum. What its situation is, may be seen in Busching; a part of the city built on a stream which falls into the Vistula—low of course—a place of business, and its streets dirty.</P>
<P N="2">2d. The disease, after its first appearance, lay lurking for a long time, in the suburbs of the city, and its progress was not perceivable, for two or three months. This corresponds with its phenomena in London and other places; and proves that cold or favorable weather suspends or checks the action of the pestilential principle.</P>
<P N="3">3d. It was most fatal to the poor—people in good condition mostly escaped. The same was observed at Copenhagen in 1711.</P>
<P N="4">4th. Its decrease was gradual, as well as its increase.</P>
<P N="5">5th. Many of the inhabitants, tho they took never so much care to avoid the distemper, kept at home, suffered no infected person to approach them, and used all manner of preservatives, "yet caught the infection."</P>
<P N="6">6th. The disease was preceded, in 1708, by extraordinary numbers of spiders. The same presage has been observed on other occasions.</P>
<P N="7">7th. While this distemper was raging, on the 11th of Au∣gust, an offensive mist was observed, like a thick cloud, but of short duration. It returned in the afternoon, from the north∣west, so thick as to darken the air. Its color was that of the effluvia from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffervescence of the oil of vitriol with oil of tartar, a blackish yellow.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="222" REF="036687_0226_100AA2B1EB6C5928"/>8th. In the beginning of October appeared over the city a blue fiery globe or meteor, which came from the north west, in the night, shot towards the town rapidly, illuminating the city, and fell to the south.</P>
<P N="9">9th. Crows, sparrows and other birds did not make their ap∣pearance during the pestilence.</P>
<P>In 1708 and 9 the plague desolated Livonia. In 1710 the disease appeared in Sweden; 30,000 persona perished by it in Stockholm, and other parts of the kingdom did not escape. Historians relate, that in the latter part of the last century and beginning of the present, the sweating sickness and great plague in Sweden destroyed several hundred thousand lives, in conse∣quence of which Sweden is less populous than formerly.</P>
<BIBL>Williams's Obs. vol. 1. p. 638. Universal Hist. vol. 35. 458.</BIBL>
<P>In 1710 also the territory of Lithuania was ravaged by pes∣tilence.</P>
<P>In 1711 Copenhagen lost 25,000 citizens by the same mal∣ady.</P>
<P>It is proper to remark how extensively pestilence prevailed af∣ter the great catarrh and terribly severe winter of 1709.</P>
<P>Nor did America escape the operation of the general princi∣ple. A body of troops under Gen. Nicholson, destined to co∣operate with a fleet from England, in the reduction of Canada, e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>camped near Wood Creek in the province of New-York, and in July and August were attacked with a distemper which made dreadful havoc and obliged them to decamp. Some of the men died as if they had been poisoned. This circumstance gave rise to a report which Charlevoix gravely relates, that the In∣dians had poisoned the water of the creek, by throwing into it all the skins of beasts they had taken in hunting. The disease was probably the lake fever or a malignant dysentery. This happened in 1709.</P>
<BIBL>Hutch. Hist. Mass. vol. 2. 179.</BIBL>
<P>England also felt the influence of the same general principle, as appears from the bill of mortality for 1710. In France, England and the Low Countries raged a catarrhous fever to

which was given the name of Dunkirk rant. In some places prevailed a spotted fever, as at Norwich.</P>

<P>In 1712 prevailed catarrh in Europe, with sore throats. Whether catarrh prevailed in America also, I can obtain no in∣formation. The seasons in England were excessively wet, and corn was rotten or mildewed. The winter was severe, there was an eruption of Vesuvius and an earthquake. From these circumstances, I suspect the approach of a comet, but have found no account of any.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since the text was prepared for the press, I have found an account of a comet in 1712. My suspicions therefore were well founded.</NOTE></P>
<BIBL>Short, vol. 2. 8.</BIBL>
<P>In October 1712 commenced a mortal sickness in the town of Waterbury, in Connecticut, which raged for eleven months. It was so general that nurses could scarcely be found to tend the sick. What the disease was, I am not informed; but not im∣probably it was that species of putrid pleurisy, which has so of∣ten made dreadful havoc in America.</P>
<BIBL>Trumbull's Hist. of Connecticut, 386.</BIBL>
<P>In the same year, prevailed a sore throat in London, accom∣panied with dizziness and pain in the limbs.</P>
<P>In 1713 prevailed the measles in America, cotemporary with epidemic pestilence in Europe.</P>
<P>In 1712 and 13, the plague was epidemic in Vienna, Hun∣gary, Stiria and other eastern countries. This disease was pre∣ceded by the spotted fever, which gradually changed to plague. At the same time, whole countries were overrun with insects.</P>
<BIBL>Short, vol. 2. 10.</BIBL>
<P>In England prevailed a fever which Mead has pronounced to have been of the same kind, as the sweating sickness in the six∣teenth century.—He says it was imported from Dunkirk, but how it came to be in Dunkirk, he does not inform us.</P>
<P>During these calamities among men, the beasts of the field did not escape. A fatal distemper among cattle broke out in 1711 and raged with such violence, in Italy, as almost to destroy the species. It spread for three or four years, and horses perished by a similar pestilence. The writers who describe the disease,
<PB N="224" REF="036687_0228_100AA2B778321008"/>
represent it as a kind of plague; and all agree that it sprung from a single infected cow from Dalmatia. How this cow be∣came infected, they do not inform us. The truth is the disease was an epidemic, tho very infectious; and that it did not ne∣cessarily originate in infection, is proved by its appearing in many other parts of Europe.</P>
<P>The disease began with rigors, which were followed by vio∣lent fever, with eruptions like those of the small-pox, and ter∣minated in five, six or seven days.</P>
<BIBL>Baddam's Mem. vol. 6. 72. Lancisius p. 154.</BIBL>
<P>In 1714 began in Europe a series of dry summers. This year was rather sickly in England, and cattle also perished by an infectious distemper.</P>
<P>In 1715 the small-pox and measles were epidemic in England. In the same year, Plymouth in Massachusetts lost 40 of its in∣habitants by a malignant disease, but no particulars are known.</P>

<P>In 1717 appeared a comet, and there was an explosion of Vesuvius. Holland and Germany suffered severely the same year by inundations. In America the winter was terribly se∣vere, and remarkable for "prodigious storms of snow," says Mr. Winthrop of New-London in a letter to Dr. Mather, Hist. Col. vol. 2. 12. One hundred <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heep belonging to that gentle∣man were buried in the snow on Fisher's Island, and 28 days af∣ter, were dug out, when two of them were found alive; and they both lived and thrived. The snow was accumulated over them to the height of sixteen feet.—This snow storm is distin∣guished in the Annals of America, as by far the greatest ever known.</P>

<P>In 1718, 19, 20 and 21, says Dr. Rogers, the greater num∣ber of those who lived near the slaughter-houses at Cork, died.</P>
<P>In 1720 happened the last great plague in Marseilles, on which occasion has been published "Traité de la peste," a treatise in quarto, by Chicoyneau, under the sanction of the French king, in which great efforts are made to prove the disease to have been imported from the Levant.</P>
<P>The proofs of importation stand thus. "Capt. Chataud left Said in Syria in January 1720, with a clean patent. The plague was not then in Said, tho it broke out soon after. On the passage, several persons died, and the physicians at Leghorn, where the ship stopped, pronounced their disease to be "a ma∣lignant pestilential fever."</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="036687_0230_100AA2BD876E09E0"/>The ship arrived at Marseilles, and some persons who had concern with the goods, died in May. The suspected goods were subjected to fifteen days retreat and purification—they were forbid to be introduced into the city—the porters were shut up; but all regulations were fruitless. In June, deaths appeared in the city with distinctive marks of the plague."</P>
<P>On such flimsey evidence do the sticklers for the sole propa∣gation of the plague by infection, ground all their assertions res∣pecting the disease at Marseilles!</P>
<P>But it happens in this case, as in most similar instances, that the pretended proofs of infection carry refutation in the very face of them.</P>
<P>In the first place, it is an acknowledged fact, that at the time the ship left Said, the plague had not appeared in that port, or town. It was at Aleppo and in other places far distant in 1719, but had not broke out in Said. How, in the name of reason, could men or goods be infected, when the disease did not exist in the place?</P>
<P>To overcome or rather to evade the force of this objection, the writers on the subject are compelled to resort to <HI>supposition.</HI> They say it is <HI>possible,</HI> the plague might have been in the place, tho not known or generally admitted. And here rests their whole argument!</P>
<P>It is true, that some of the seamen or passengers died on the passage, with a malignant pestilential fever. But in this case, the malady originated on board the ship—and the infection is not traced to the Levant ports. There is an end of the chain—the disease began <HI>without infection,</HI> on board the ship, as malignant fevers have done in thousands of other ships.</P>
<P>Again, it is admitted by Dr. Mead himself, p. 255, that from the time of the sailors' death, after the ship arrived, it was full six weeks before the disease was known in the city of Mar∣seilles; a circumstance that renders it nearly impossible that there could have been any propagation of the distemper by infection. To remove this objection, the advocates of infection again resort <HI>to supposition.</HI> They <HI>suppose</HI> it possible some latent seeds of the disease had been concealed in goods, or clothes—and such ridic∣ulous suggestions are made the grounds of assertion.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="036687_0231_100AA2BF0FB42FF8"/>But what completely refutes all these idle suppositions, is, that we have full evidence, that the plague in Marseilles was generat∣ed in the city, and gradually arose from milder diseases. In the beginning of the "Traitè de la peste," it is stated from Mon. Didier and not denied, that "the preceding year 1719 was a barren year—the corn, the wine and the oil, were defec∣tive. The heat of spring was excessive and followed by great rains, with westerly winds—the fruits were bad. In this year a pestilential fever appeared in Marseilles, of which many died, and <HI>in some, appeared buboes, carbuncles and paroitides.</HI>"</P>
<P>Here we observe facts that always exist, before the plague, and which demonstrate the uniform operations of the laws of nature. The year 1718 began to exhibit malignant diseases in greater numbers than usual. In 1719 the plague broke out at Aleppo, and in the north and west of Europe, malignant fevers became in many places, epidemic and pestilential. In 1720, the pestilential state of the air, arrived at its crisis in Marseilles. The pestilence in Europe exhibited a <HI>regular progress,</HI> from or∣dinary typhus fever to the plague. A fatal small-pox and spot∣ted fever prevailed in Piemont.</P>
<P>To demonstrate this fact, the reader will only turn to the bills of mortality in London, Amsterdam, Vienna, Dresden, &amp;c. for the years under consideration, and observe every where the effects of a general unhealthy state of air, in the increase of the number of deaths.—The bills of mortality in Boston and Phila∣delphia also prove this state of air to have extended to this coun∣try; and the malignancy of it seems to have abated in America after 1721, in which year the small-pox was very mortal in Boston.</P>
<P>The accounts of diseases in America, at this period, are few and imperfect. Tradition has preserved the memory of desola∣ting sickness, at various times and in various places, some of which, I suspect, refer to this period, but I am not able to as∣certain the dates, with any certainty.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">My father mentions an instance, which he believes to have been not long before his birth, which was in 1722. An aged lady of 96, who was born in 1702, informs me that a malignant pleurisy raged when she was 17 years old; this fixes the period in 1719.</NOTE> By accident however,
<PB N="228" REF="036687_0232_100AA2C0966EA530"/>
I am able to determin positively the pestilential state of air in America in 1720. A genuine letter is extant, from Thomas Hacket of Duck Creek, now in the state of Delaware, dated April 10th 1720, in which he states that a mortality prevailed in that place, which exceeded that in London in 1665, and al∣most depopulated the village. I have seen the letter in possession of Dr. Rush.</P>
<P>In 1721 there was an eruption of a volcano in Iceland. A dreadful dysentery raged in Upper Saxony.</P>
<P>In 1720 there was a great earthquake in China, and in 1721 shocks were felt in the Mediterranean, by Dr. Shaw who was then on his travels to the east.—In October 1720, fire arose out of the sea near Tercera, one of the Azores, and a small island arose.</P>

<P>In 1722, the seasons were cold, wet and rainy. In August happened a most violent storm in Jamaica and S. Carolina. In May an earthquake in Chili.</P>
<P>The winter of 1722-3 was cold and dry in England. In 1723 appeared a comet, and on the 24th of February, O. S. a mighty tempest which is recorded among the memorabilia of America. The wind blew violently from the southward, then veered suddenly to the eastward and northward, bringing in a tide which rose two or three feet above the Long Wharf in Boston, and flowed over all the lower part of the town, filling cellars and destroying property to a great amount. Immense damage was sustained in all the maritime towns.</P>
<BIBL>See Mather's letter. Hist. Col. vol. 2. 11.</BIBL>
<P>The confluent small-pox raged in England See the London bill of mortality for 1723. Dysenteries, pleurisies and other inflammatory complaints prevailed in the different seasons.</P>
<P>The bilious plague prevailed in Barbadoes, said to be import∣ed from Martinico. We are not informed from whence it came into Martinico. In these accounts of infections, we are not led to the end of the chain.</P>
<P>In the same year 1723 prevailed in many parts of the colony of Rhode-Island, a fatal disease called the "burning ague." It was particularly fatal, near Providence, between Pautucket
<PB N="229" REF="036687_0233_100AA2C30AD47DD0"/>
and Pautuxet. In proportion to its patients, no disease in A∣metica, was ever more mortal. It did not prevail in a large town, but in villages, and perhaps the clearing of some neigh∣boring swamps might have been one cause of the disease. The year however was less healthy than usual. A disease of the same name is noted once or twice in ancient history. See the year 1001.</P>
<P>The year 1724 in England was mostly wet and cold; the whooping cough prevailed; but the year was generally healthy.</P>
<P>The summer of 1725 was also wet and cold in England. In January a severe frost produced many inflammatory complaints. In this year happened violent earthquakes in South-Amer∣ica, and eruptions from two volcanic mountains in Iceland. I have no account of the weather and diseases in America. I only learn from an old gentleman, that one of the winters be∣tween 1722 and 1725 was called, "the hard winter."</P>
<P>The winter of 1726-7 was changeable in England, but mostly cold with great snows. Remitting fevers prevailed in summer and inflammatory, in winter, which swelled the bills of mortal∣ity to an unusual degree. At the same time the plague raged in Egypt.</P>

type. What the disease was in Philadelphia, I know not; but the greatest mortality was in February, March and April.</P>
<P>In 1728 putrid fevers were frequent—the summer was cold in England and the following winter severe. The year 1727 was unproductive; corn in England was scarce and the scarcity continued into this year. An eruption of a volcano in Iceland and the plague in Egypt marked this year, 1728. The eruption in Iceland continued till 1730.</P>
<P>This year, 1728, the summer weather in South-Carolina was unusually hot and dry. The earth was parched and the springs exhausted. In August a violent hurricane occasioned an inun∣dation, which spread over the low grounds and did incredible damage to the wharves, houses and corn fields. The streets of Charlestown were covered with boats; the inhabitants were driven to the upper stories of their houses; twenty-three ships were driven ashore and thousands of trees were levelled. The same season, the bilious plague raged in Charleston with great mortality.</P>
<BIBL>Hist. of S. Carolina, vol. 1. 316.</BIBL>
<P>In 1729 appeared a comet, and in autumn a universal catarrh in Europe, and perhaps over the globe. This was preceded by measles. It seized with a slight chill, a slow fever, weari∣ness, continual hoarseness, pain of the head, and difficulty of breathing. The suddenness of the attack was astonishing, and it proved fatal to many aged and phlegmatic people. Many pleurisies and peripneumonies followed. Its first appearance was in Poland, Austria and Silesia, and it marched over Europe in five months. At the close of this epidemic in 1730, Vesuvius discharged its contents of fire.</P>
<P>In this year 1729 the plague was in Aleppo, and it will be seen that the bills of mortality in the north of Europe exhibit a sickly state, through a period of many years at this time. The measles prevailed in America, and in Farmington, Connecticut, a malignant pleurisy.</P>
<P>The summer of 1729 was in most parts of England, very wet, in other parts, dry; but this made no difference in the prevalence of the catarrh. The small-pox was very frequent in England.</P>

<P>It will be observed that these eruptive diseases in Holland were cotemporary with the measles in America, and the malig∣nant pleurisy in winter, which was the predominant symptom of a pestilential constitution of air, in America, until the year 1761.</P>
<P>The winter of 1730-31 was very severe in Europe.</P>
<P>It appears from the bills of mortality in Boston and Philadel∣phia, that the years 1730 and 31 were sickly. What the mal∣ady was which swelled the mortality in Christ Church to double the usual number in 1731, I am not informed; but the greatest mortality happened in March and April. The small-pox was the disease which augmented the bill in Boston in 1730.</P>
<P>In 1731 the small-pox spread in New-York, and occasioned an adjournment of the legislature in September.</P>

<P>Towards the close of the year, in October, commenced in America a severe universal catarrh, which appeared in Europe also in December. It spread over all Europe, in the beginning of 1733, and probably over the earth, as it was experienced at the isle of Bourbon, in the Indian Ocean.</P>

<P>This epidemic seems to have been the precursor of the most pestilential period of this century. The summer of 1733, in England, was dry and pleasant. The winter following was very mild. The plague raged at Aleppo.</P>
<P>The scarlatina appeared in Edinburgh; and the chin cough also began in England in 1734, continuing to prevail in 1735.</P>
<P>This period also was noted for meteors. In June 1734, a ball of fire passed through two opposite windows of a steeple at Air, in Scotland, broke one end of the bell-joist, and descended to the earth, without doing further harm. A boy in the neigh∣borhood was killed by another ball of fire.</P>

An anginous fever be∣came epidemic among children, and quinsies or swellings of the throat, with contagion, and great mortality. Small-pox of a malignant kind prevailed at the close of the year. The pestilen∣tial state of the air is said to have affected birds, which died in the cages. Canine madness prevailed.</P>

<P>While these epidemics were prevailing in Europe, America felt the pestilential state of air. In May 1735, in a wet cold season, appeared at Kingston, an inland town in New-Hamp∣shire, situated in a low plain, a disease among children, commonly called the "throat distemper," of a most malignant kind, and by far the most fatal ever known in this country. Its symptoms generally were, a swelled throat, with white or ash-colored specks, an efflorescence on the skin, great debility of the whole system, and a tendency to putridity.</P>
<P>It first seized a child, who died in three days. In about a week afterwards, three children, in another family, at a distance of four miles, were successively seized and all died on the third day. It continued to spread, and of the first forty patients, not one recovered.</P>
<P>In August, it appeared at Exeter, a town six miles distant. In September, it broke out in Boston, fifty miles distant; altho' it did not appear in Chester six miles west of Kingston, till Octo∣ber. —It continued its ravages, through that year into the next, and gradually travelled southward, almost stripping the country of children. Very few children escaped, for altho' the disease was very infectious, yet its propagation depended very little on that circumstance. It attacked the young in the most sequester∣ed situations, and without a possible communication with the sick. It was literally the <HI>plague among children.</HI> Many families lost three and four children—many lost all.</P>
<P>In some places, this distemper was more fatal than in others—
<PB N="234" REF="036687_0238_100AA2D02BEC7608"/>
country towns suffered more than populous cities. And it should be here remarked, that the virulence of this species of disease seems at times to be greatly augmented by cold and wet weather —it is most mild in cities where the air is, in a degree, correc∣ted of its rigor and moisture.—To this observation however there are exceptions.</P>
<P>Scorbutic people and those who lived on pork, and of course the poor, suffered most. In some families, it was comparatively mild—in others it was malignant like a plague. This disease gradually travelled westward and was two years in reaching the river Hudson, distant from Kingston, where it first appeared, a∣bout 200 miles in a strait line. It continued its progress west∣ward, with some interruptions, until it spread over the colonies. Few adults were affected; its principal ravages were among per∣sons under age, or rather under puberty. For many years after it was epidemic, it frequently broke out in different places with∣out any apparent cause, but did not spread—a striking proof that such diseases will not become <HI>epidemic</HI> by the sole power of <HI>in∣fection,</HI> but that some <HI>general cause</HI> must aid its propagation, or it will perish in its cradle. This is probably true of every species of pestilential disease.</P>
<P>From an elderly lady of great observation in New-Haven, I have learnt that persons who, recovered of this distemper, were subject, all their lives, to sore throat and quinsies, and what is perhaps more remarkable, that few or none of them have lived to be old. It is at least apparent, in the sphere of her observa∣tion, that those persons have died at an earlier age than others. These facts are striking proofs how much the whole system, and especially the seat of the disease, was impaired in strength and firmness, by that distressing malady. A gentleman still living, who was affected with the same disease in 1742, informs me that his constitution has never recovered from the shock it received from that malady.</P>
<P>The invasion of this distemper was gradual, and for some time before its attack, children appeared to languish. It was not always attended with great prostration of strength, for per∣sons
<PB N="235" REF="036687_0239_100AA2D1B4E4BDB0"/>
were often walking, an hour or two before their death. The same happened in the angina of 1794.</P>

<P>Diseases among cattle in New Hampshire marked this period.</P>
<P>In 1736, and during the rage of the ulcerous sore throat in America and in England, the plague made terrible havoc in E∣gypt —authors relate that Cairo lost 10,000 persons in a day.— In Nimeguen raged a malignant dysentery.</P>
<P>In 1737 while the angina maligna was spreading over the northern parts of America, the bilious plague prevailed in Vir∣ginia. In England and Scotland, the measles broke out and prevailed in 1735 and 6, cotemporary with the angina in Amer∣ica. Dr. Short relates that the first person seized was a woman in her child-bed illness.</P>
<P>At the same time prevailed miliary fevers in Cornwall, ac∣companied with glandular swellings. Coughs, defluxions and catarrhs were frequent. A pestilential disease in Devonshire swept away cattle and swine.</P>
<P>In 1737 a very severe influenza invaded both hemispheres. It commenced in November.</P>
<P>In 1737 also appeared a comet; Constantinople was shaken and Smyrna half destroyed by an earthquake. A small shock was felt in Boston. In October of this year, a storm or hurri∣cane in the East-Indies, destroyed 20,000 vessels of different sizes, and 300,000 people. There was a great eruption of Ve∣suvius in the same year. In Iceland also was an eruption be∣tween 1730 and 1740, but the year is not specified.</P>

<P>This pestilential constitution did not produce the same diseases in England, as in France and America. The fatal ulcerous sore throat was cotemporary in America and in France in 1737; but that disease did not appear, in its formidable array, in Eng∣land until 1742. In 1734-5 appeared its sister-malady, the scarlet fever in Edinburg; but it subsided; and the epidemic
<PB N="236" REF="036687_0240_100AA2D433DDCD30"/>
took the form of measles of a bad type, with hoarseness, defluxions and catarrh. The catarrh prevailed also in Barbadoes in the close of this year and beginning of the next, and in New-England was a great death of fish and water fowl.</P>
<P>In 1738 sudden deaths, vertigoes and apoplexies followed the preceding epidemics in England. The plague raged at Ockza∣kow, at Barbadoes, and in New-Spain the pestilence was so gen∣eral and mortal, as to threaten the country with depopulation.</P>
<P>In 1739 the small-pox prevailed in New-York, and some dysenteries, but I hear of no remarkable occurrences in this year; except that angina maligna appeared in England in a few sporadic cases, but did not spread at that time; and an infect∣ious fever prevailed at Charleston.</P>

<P>A comet was seen in 1739, and the winter following in Eu∣rope was the severest known since 1716 or perhaps since 1709. The cold continued till June and was succeeded by a dry season; then a wet, cold autumn. A dearth succeeded in Scotland, and measles spread over America.</P>
<P>In England spread the whooping cough in December 1740. The small-pox prevailed and in 1741 that disease, with the spot∣ted fever were very mortal.</P>

They aver the disease not to have been known there, anterior to that year. It was most fatal to seamen and foreigners, but the natives did not escape. Here we have a new source of yellow fever!</P>
<P>In 1742 the ulcerous sore throat of a malignant kind appear∣ed in England, and continued to prevail more or less for many years, and in 1745 became very infectious.</P>
<BIBL>See Short, vol. 2. and Fothergill's Works.</BIBL>
<P>The summer of 1742 in England was dry.</P>
<P>In America, the same angina prevailed in 1742. From 1740 to 1744 pestilential diseases prevailed in all parts of the known world.</P>
<P>In Syria, the winter of 1741-2 was very severe. In March began an acute fever in Aleppo, attended with a severe pain in the right hypochondrium. The plague had previously shown it∣self on the sea coast. In April, says Alex. Russel, some reapers brought the infection into the neighbourhood of Aleppo. In the city, no notice was given of the plague, till the 18th of May; but on strict enquiry, it was found that cases had occur∣red before that time. Whether the "reapers" introduced the fomites into the city, the author does not inform us.</P>
<P>The distemper made no great havoc in this season. It abated in July, and nothing is said about <HI>infection,</HI> till November, when a few more cases occurred. In February 1743 a few cases ap∣peared and in March an alarm was given. It was more general in this year, but disappeared in 1744.</P>
<P>When the disease subsided in Aleppo, it was followed by di∣arrhaeas and dysenteries with petechiae; and some obstinate in∣termittents.</P>
<P>In December 1742 and January 1743 were earthquakes with great snows, violent rains and frost.</P>

These were the precursors of the dreadful plague which raged, in the following summer, at Calabria, Reggio, and es∣pecially at Messina in Sicily, where perished 46,000 inhabitants out of 72,000.

<P>The year 1743 was distinguished for a tremendous eruption of fire at Cotopaxi, a mountain in the province of Quito, five leagues north of Latacunga; all the neighboring villages were ruined by floods from the melted snows of the mountain. The eruption was repeated in 1744.</P>

<P>In 1744 severe catarrh spread over Europe. It was at Rome in February; at London in March; and in a few weeks per∣vaded England.</P>

<P>In 1745 Lima was shaken by an earthquake. An infectious fever broke out among the troops employed in the expedition to Louisbourg. A similar fever prevailed at Boston; and how far the health of the town was affected by the returning troops, I am not informed. This was a time of general sickness.</P>
<P>In Charleston prevailed the infectious yellow fever, while Egypt and Smyrna were suffering the ravages of the plague. The bilious plague prevailed, at the same time, in New-York.</P>
<P>In this year, the town of Stamford in Connecticut was se∣verely distressed by a malignant dysentery, which swept away seventy inhabitants out of a few hundreds. The disease was confined to one street.</P>
<P>The year 1746 was probably still more unhealthy. An earth∣quake laid Lima and Calao in ruins. The concussion began on the 28th of October, about six hours before the full of the moon; and at intervals, the shocks were repeated for four months, in which time they amounted to four hundred and fifty. During these convulsions, fire burst forth in several places of the distant mountains. Many days before the shocks began, hollow rumbling noises were heard in the earth, at times resembling the discharge of artillery. Similar sounds continued for some time after the earthquake.</P>
<BIBL>See the melancholy tale in Ulloa, vol. 2. 83.</BIBL>
<P>Albany was, in this year, visited by a malignant disease called by Colden, a nervous fever; and by Douglas, the yellow fever. From an old citizen, who was living in 1797, my friend Dr. Mitchell obtained the following particulars relative to that disease. The bodies of some of the patients were yellow—the crisis of the disease was the ninth day; if the patient survived that day, he had a good chance for recovery. The disease left many in a state of imbecility of mind, approaching to childishness or idio∣cy; others were afterwards troubled with swelled legs.</P>
<P>The disease began in August, ended with frost, and carried off forty-five inhabitants mostly men of robust bodies. It was said to be imported.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="036687_0244_100AA2DD02A38980"/>As this was unusual disease in Albany, ingenuity was occu∣pied to find out its origin. It was <HI>reported</HI> that a like disease pre∣vailed in New-York, and that it had been imported in a vessel from Ireland. Nervous, yellow fever imported from Ireland! Such are the vulgar tales that disgrace this age of science and philosophy. From what fairy land were imported the malignant diseases, which every where swelled the bills of mortality in the same year?—Not that I would insinuate that diseases of a certain kind are not infectious. A pestilential fever originated in the Chebucto fleet, under the Duke D'Anville, which landed an ar∣my on our shores in this same year, and one third of the Indians who visited the cantonments, died. There the disease subsided, without becoming epidemic.</P>
<P>But what I severely reprobate is, the disposition of men to trace all the evils of life to a foreign source; when the sources are in their own country, their own houses, and their own bo∣soms.</P>
<P>A similar disease raged, the same year, among the Mohegan Indians.</P>
<BIBL>See the postscript at the end of the volume.</BIBL>
<P>At Zurich in Switzerland and in Saxony prevailed a very ma∣lignant dysentery. Indeed for a number of years, at this peri∣od, dysentery was epidemic in many parts of Europe and A∣merica.</P>
<P>In 1747 prevailed epidemic catarrh in America and Europe. In the same year the bilious plague prevailed in Philadelphia.—In 1748, in Charleston. The same years were sickly in Boston.</P>
<P>In 1747 appeared a comet, and Etna, which had been quiet more than forty years, commenced her discharges of fire and lava. In the West-Indies, a tremendous hurricane laid waste the Islands.</P>
<P>Two comets appeared in 1748; the winter was severe, and two or three excessively hot and dry summers succeeded. In England the summer of 1747 was very dry. In 1748 a fast was appointed in Massachusetts on account of the drouth.</P>

<P>In 1749 and 50 the dysentery, according to Zimmerman, made great havoc in the Canton of Berne. It is remarkable that this formidable disease should be thus prevalent in both hemispheres at the same time, and for a series of years. About this time measles prevailed in America.</P>
<P>In 1750 appeared a comet, and the summer was excessively hot. In Philadelphia, the heat raised the mercury to 100 deg. by Farenheit. The plague carried off 30,000 people in Fez, and one third of the inhabitants of Tangiers.</P>

On the same day, a tempest at Jamaica did damage to the amount of a million of dollars. A storm at Cadiz on the 8th of December destroyed 100 sail of shipping. On the Adriatic coast was an earthquake.</P>
<P>In this year Constantinople lost 200,000 inhabitants by the plague.—The preceding winter was cold in Turkey, and the old people predicted a severe plague from the quantity of snow that fell in Constantinople.

<P>I have no account of any general epidemic in 1753; but particular places were visited with distressing sickness. A singu∣lar instance of a local pestilence occasioned by vapor deserves to be related.</P>
<P>In autumn 1753 after a dry season, arose in Rouen, the chief city of Normandy, a thick fog, with the smell of sulphur, which increased to that degree, that in the evening, lights could not be distinguished at any considerable distance. It did not wholly disappear, till the next day. It was more dense in some streets than in others.</P>
<P>In three or four days after, began an epidemic sickness which seized both sexes, with chills, lassitude, loss of appetite, slight pains in the arms and legs. These symptoms were followed by bilious looseness, nausea and vomitings. Most patients bled at the nose, frequently in small quantity. The head-ache then be∣came violent, with a small, hard pulse—a high fever followed. The region of the stomach and hypochondria was tumefied; this symptom was succeeded by a tension of the belly—and a slight delirium followed. The tongue was brown or black, but moist; sometimes with green ulcers or apthae. The patient died the 5th, 7th, or 11th day; but not in every case. Some were

Some of the patients appeared to be strangled to death. The town contained no more than 80 families.</P>

<P>The winter of 1753-4 in Europe was very cold. In 1754 was a great eruption of Vesuvius which lasted several weeks, and violent earthquakes in England, Constantinople, and Amboyna, in the Eastern Ocean. The heavens appeared to be in a flame, and Egypt, which rarely feels earthquakes, was severely shaken, and 40,000 of the inhabitants of Cairo, perished in the ruins of two thirds of the city.</P>

drouth, by which all springs were exhausted. But the year 1755 was rainy. On the first of November, a tremendous con∣vulsion laid Lisbon in ruins, with the destruction of 50,000 lives. This shock was felt on the whole Spanish coast, and 10,000 people perished on one of the Azor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. In Mitelene, an island in the Archipelago, 2000 houses were destroyed. The day preceding this concussion was remarkable for a haze or vapor that obscured the sun.</P>
<P>On the 18th of November, America sustained a violent and extensive shock; but its effects were not very calamitous. The fish in the ocean did not escape without injury. Two or three whales, and multitudes of cod were seen, a few days after, floating on the surface of the water.</P>
<P>In the remarkable year 1755, the most prevalent epidemics seem to have been angina maligna, and catarrh, which spread over France and England. The angina maligna was very mor∣tal in some parts of America. In one town on Long-Island, two children only, under twelve years of age, survived.</P>

<P>In 1759 appeared two or three comets; and in November a most tremendous eruption of Vesuvius. In August was an earthquake at Bourdeaux—and one at Brussels. The winter following 1759 was excessively cold in both hemispheres. In Leipsic, centinels froze to death; and in South-Carolina, the snow covered the earth to the depth of nearly two feet. In England, the cold was less severe.</P>
<P>The year 1759 was memorable for violent earthquakes, in Syria. Buildings were demolished and Damascus was buried in ruins. The shocks were repeated for many weeks. In Novem∣ber, Truxillo in Peru was swallowed up by means of an earth∣quake. It will be observed that this happened in the month, when Vesuvius was in eruption. These great phenomena an∣nounced a general and severe pestilence, and the effects of the general principles of disease were soon felt over Europe, Asia and America.

<P>In November, the town of Bethlem was assailed by an in∣flammatory fever, with symptoms of typhus, which in the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urse of the following w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter, carried off about 40 of the inhabi∣tants. The disease as extremely violent, terminating on the 3d or 4th day; in some cases, the patient died within 24 hours of the attack. It seems to have been that species of winter fever, which occurs in pestilential periods, mentioned under the year 1698. During this epidemic, a flock of quails flew over the chimney of a house, in which were several diseased persons, and five of them fell dead on the spot. This was thought ominous; but was a natural event, which may rationally be ascribed to de∣leterious gas emitted from the chambers of the sick.</P>
<BIBL>Med. Repos. vol. 1. 524.</BIBL>
<P>This disease was ascribed to the draining of the pond or swamp, mentioned under the year 1750. But to this explana∣tion, there are strong, if not insuperable objections.</P>
<P>First. The fever began in November; but this is the month when the marsh fevers of our climate disappear. I doubt whether the effluvia from marshes ever act upon the human body, so as to produce disease, without a greater degree of heat than Con∣necticut ever experiences in the month of November. Cold puts an end to all marsh fevers, but this disease continued to in∣crease in December, and did not cease till late in the winter.</P>
<P>Secondly. This disease was called a malignant pleurisy; but marsh effluvia are not known to produce fevers of that descrip∣tion. They are common on high, as well as on low grounds, as I can prove by facts in America.</P>
<P>Thirdly. There is no necessity of resorting to marsh exha∣lations for the source of this malady. The same species of fever prevailed in that winter and the spring following, in many other parts of Connecticut, where no marsh existed. In Hartford it
<PB N="249" REF="036687_0253_100A89CBCFA38270"/>
carried off a number of robust men, in two or three days from the attack.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One of them was my paternal uncle.</NOTE> In North-Haven it attacked few persons, but ev∣ery one of them died. In East-Haven died about forty-five men in the prime of life, mostly heads of families. The same disease prevailed in New-Haven among the inhabitants, and stu∣dents in college.</P>
<P>It is obvious then that this was an epidemic, very well known in sickly periods, and not dependent on local causes. From Dr. Trumbull of North-Haven I have the following remarks on the disease.</P>
<P>The blood was very thick and sizy; often issuing from the nose and sometimes from the eyes. The inflammation was vio∣lent, and soon produced delirium. The most robust bodies were most liable to the disease. A free use of the lancet, in the early stages of the disorder, was the only effectual remedy; where the physicians were afraid to bleed, the patients all died.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dr. Hugh Williamson, in the second volume of the Medical Re∣pository, has described this species of disease, which, he says, prevails often in Carolina in winter, especially among those who have been af∣fected by bilious fevers in the preceding autumn. He observes that bleeding is usually pernicious in that disease. Perhaps a difference of climates may make different remedies necessary. But in different pe∣riods, the same disease may require different treatment. In New-Eng∣land, that fever has usually demanded an early use of the lancet.</NOTE> This malady prevailed from November 1760 to March 1761.</P>
<P>I cannot learn that this species of inflammatory fever, has ever been epidemic in the northern parts of America, since this period. But it is a common winter fever, in the Carolinas, af∣ter sickly summers; and in the northern states, sporadic cases of it occur with all its formidable symptoms. Instances will be hereafter mentioned. It is the pestilence of winter, and rarely, if ever appears, except when pestilential epidemics are current in summer. And I am not without suspicions that the debility occasioned by marsh effluvia in summer may predispose the system to that fever in winter, tho not necessary to produce it.</P>
<P>In March 1761 was a small shock of earthquake in New-England, and the same occurred in Iceland, Hamburg, Syria, England and South-America.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="036687_0254_100AA24009D8A140"/>In the winter and spring of 1761 a severe influenza attacked the northern parts of America. In Bethlem it was cotemporary with the fever just mentioned. In Philadelphia it prevailed in the winter, and in Massachusetts, in April. From Dr. Tufts, a respectable practitioner of medicin in Weymouth, I have the following description of the disease.</P>
<P>"The distemper began in April, and in May ran into a ma∣lignant fever, which proved fatal to aged people. It spread over the whole country and the West-India islands. It began with a severe pain in the head and limbs, a sensation of coldness, shiverings succeeded by great heat, running at the nose, and a troublesome cough. It continued for eight or ten days, and generally terminated by sweating.</P>
<P>In May, the aged who had before escaped, were seized with an affection like a slight cold; this, in a day or two was fol∣lowed by great prostration of strength, a cough, labo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of breath∣ing, pains about the breast, praecordia, and in the limbs, but not acute. The countenance betrayed no great marks of febrile heat. The matter expectorated was thin, but slimy. As the disease advanced, the difficulty of breathing encreased; the ex∣pectoration was more difficult; the matter thrown off more viscid; at length the lungs appeared to be so loaded with tena∣cious matter, that no efforts could dislodge it, and the patient sunk under it.</P>
<P>This disorder carried with it bilious appearances—the coun∣tenances of some patients were of a yellowish hue. In some, there was an appearance of indifference or insensibility; and at night, a slight delirium."</P>
<BIBL>M. S. letter from Dr. Tufts.</BIBL>
<P>In the spring of 1761 earthquakes were felt in many parts of Europe. See an account of them in An Register, 1761. 92. Shocks also were felt in the Azores and West-Indies. These agitations were precisely cotemporary with the epidemic catarrh in America. Scarcely any country escaped the convulsions of nature. During the pestilence in Thessalonica, shocks were felt almost every day. Ibm.</P>
<P>In the summer of 1761, I am informed, the infectious bilious fever prevailed in Charleston, but I am not possessed of the details.

<P>The summer of 1763 was a moist and unkindly season. In August the Indians on Nantucket were attacked by the bilious plague, and between that time and February following, their number was reduced from 358 to 136. Of 258 who were af∣fected, 36 only recovered. The disease began with high fever and ended in typhus, in about five days. It appeared to be in∣fectious among the Indians only; for no whites were attacked, altho they associated freely with the diseased. Persons of a mixed blood were attacked, but recovered. Not one died, ex∣cept of full Indian blood. Some Indians who lived in the fam∣ilies of the whites, escaped the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isease; as did a few that lived by themselves on a distant part of the island. I am informed, by respectable authority, that a similar fever attacked Indians on board of ships, at a distance of hundreds of leagues, without any connection with Nantucket.</P>
<P>In December of the same year, the Indians on Martha's Vine∣yard, distant eight leagues from Nantucket, were invaded by a like fever; not a family escaped, and of 52 patients, 39 died.</P>
<P>In this instance, disease discriminated as nicely between the Whites and Indians, as in 1797, it did between men and cats,
<PB N="253" REF="036687_0257_100A89D12DC51638"/>
and as exactly as the plague in Egypt, between the Israelites and Egyptians.</P>
<P>Some suspicions were suggested that the disease at Nantucket might have been received from a ship which put in there, with sick passengers, from Ireland bound to New-York; but there is no foundation for this opinion, as the disorder broke out be∣fore the arrival of the ship.</P>

<P>The summer was remarkable for hail storms, one of which totally ruined 36 villages in Maconnois in France. See the ac∣count of these and of the earthquakes in that year in An. Regis. Chronicle.

In most parts of Europe and America, this period of pestilence ap∣pears to have closed with the years 1762 and 3. But in Naples spread a malignant fever in 1764, preceded by famin, by which disease it was supposed 200,000 people perished. The disease

<P>To the epidemics above mentioned, succeeded a series of dys∣enteries, in the hot summers of 1765 and 6. In 1765, the ma∣lignant dysentery raged in Berne and other parts of Switzer∣land, in Suabia and Austria. The invasion was, in many cases sudden, says Zimmerman, without any preceding symptom; but more generally its approach was indicated by chills, lassitude and other premonitory signs. In its progress, it exhibited most of the symptoms of the yellow fever of America. It was pre∣ceded by a putrid fever, which yielded to the dysentery in June.</P>
<BIBL>See Zimmerman on Dysentery.</BIBL>
<P>This epidemic was followed by violent and malignant pleuri∣sies; a circumstance that marks its alliance with the pestilential fever of America, and probably of all temperate climates, which is also succeeded by pleurisy or peripneumony in winter.</P>
<P>In 1765 were many earthquakes in Italy, and Sweden, and a volcanic eruption at Truxillo in Spanish America. Dysentery prevailed in Scotland, and intermittents in Pennsylvania and Georgia, were universal.</P>
<P>In 1766 the summer was every where hot and in Europe ex∣cessively dry. In Germany, the Rhine was lower than in the terrible drouth of 1476, and in many places, was forded. In Scotland, the people were compelled to kill their cattle for want of fodder. The heat and drouth produced great hail storms, and in autumn, were followed by inundations, one of which at Montauban, in France, swept away 1200 houses. Terrible tem∣pests marked the year, and in the West-Indies, those hurricanes which lay the islands waste, and are recorded among the memo∣rabilia of the climate. In August, the planet Mars was nearer

to the earth, by two millions of miles, than it had been for many ages, and in the spring appeared a comet.</P>
<P>The winter preceding this remarkable summer, was extremely cold in Europe. At Ratisbon, Reaumur's thermometer was two degrees lower, than in the noted year 1709, and birds per∣ished with cold. At Naples, the snow lay in the streets, to the depth of 18 inches, and Vesuvius began to discharge smoke, the harbinger of an explosion. At Lisbon, Reaumur's ther∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ometer was 3½ degrees below the freezing point, and at Mad∣rid, people skated on the ice.</P>
<P>These remarkable phenomena preceded and attended a gene∣ral discharge of fire and lava, from the three well known volca∣noes, Etna, Vesuvius and Heckla, which took place in 1766. This is one of the few instances on record, in which these vol∣canoes have been in eruption, nearly at the same time. The eruption of Heckla continued from April to September. These phenomena account for the excessive drouth in Europe.</P>

<P>The winter of 1765-6 was not severe in America and there was little snow; but in this remarkable period, as in many oth∣ers, the severity of the seasons commenced in Europe one year before it did in America. The winter of 1766-7 was terribly severe in both hemispheres. The cold was as intense as in 1740; the Rhine at Cologne became a bridge of ice, and supported laboring artificers, as in 1670. In Italy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he poor crouded to the cities for aid, and perished with cold. In Russia, both rich and poor perished. The wolves became ravenous, entered towns and destroyed people. In England, the larks took refuge in hay-carts and the market; the snow fell to the depth of many feet and buried thousands of sheep. In America, the cold was
<PB N="256" REF="036687_0260_100AA2468AAC9AE0"/>
very severe, and at Brandywine, the mercury fell in Farenheit to 20 deg. below cypher—an unexampled degree of cold in that latitude. In January happened a thaw, which broke up the riv∣ers in Connecticut, and left scarcely a bridge over the rivers. The cold in France in 1767-8 was more severe than in 1740 and within a degree of that in 1709. In Constantinople snow and hail fell as late as March 16.</P>

<P><PB N="258" REF="036687_0262_100AA24A40FF0528"/>In the East-Indies the disorders in the elements at this period produced still more deplorable effects. The excessive heat and want of rain, which usually precede or attend the approximation of comets and volcanic eruptions, occasion a failure of crops in countries, where the grain which is the principal food of the in∣habitants, depends on water from inundation. Such is the fact in India and in Egypt, where rice is the great article of food.</P>
<P>The heat and drouth of 1769 cut short the rice crops in the territories of the Ganges. The consequence was a famin, which, in 1770, destroyed incredible numbers of the natives.

<P>In 1770, cotemporary with the clouds of flies in India and a most fatal pestilence among men and cattle in Europe, appeared in America a black worm about one inch and a half in length, which devoured the grass and corn. Never was a more singular phenomenon. These animals were generated suddenly in the northern states of America, and almost covered two or three hundred miles of country. They all moved nearly in one direc∣tion, and when they were intercepted by furrows, in plowed land, they fell into them in such numbers as to form heaps. They sought shelter in the grass, a hot sun being fatal to them. They disappeared suddenly about the close of June and beginning of July.</P>

<P>This species of worm has been seen at other times, and in 1791, in great multitudes. No account can be given of their origin and they seem not to have regular periods of return. In July 1791, the late governor Huntington, a gentleman of care∣ful observation, informed me, he had exposed some of these an∣imals to a hot sun on a dry board, and in a few hours, found them dissolved into mere water. They seem to be generated by some elementary process, and to be the harbingers of pestilence; at least they have preceded diseases in America.</P>

<P>This year, 1773, was in general sickly. In America, the mea∣sles finished its course and was followed by disorders in the throat.

This disease of the oats still continues to be very injurious to the parish; but in 1789, a year of unusual commo∣tion in the elements in the north of Europe, as will hereafter be related, it spread to a greater extent than was ever before known.

<P>It is remarkable that the prim in America began to decay and perish about this period; and near the same time, the wheat insect first appeared on Long-Island.</P>
<P>I would just observe that the disease among the oats, and the death of the prim, with the wheat insect, may be new phenom∣ena in the natural world; or certain revolutions which unusual causes may have induced in animal and vegetable life.</P>
<P>About this time, for the year is not recollected, there was an eruption of fire at Derby, in Connecticut, a few rods from Nau∣gatuck river; the only instance ever known in that place. It happened on a steep bank where it made a large excavation in the earth, throwing trees and stones to some distance. A light was seen on the spot in the evening before the explosion. It was accompanied with a loud report, and some fossil substances were ejected, which were analized by Dr. Monson of New-Haven, and found to contain arsenic and sulphur.</P>

<BIBL>Historical Collections, vol. 3. 119.</BIBL>
<P>During this sickly period also, the oysters on the shores of Connecticut were in an unhealthy state, and sometimes excited vomiting in those who ate of them.</P>
<P>It is remarkable also that in 1776 the lobsters in the vicinity of York-Island, all disappeared. This event has generally been ascribed to the firing of cannon in the summer of that year. But the place where they lived being many miles from the British shipping, this explanation is not satisfactory. It is more proba∣ble that they perished, or abandoned the ground, on account of the bad state of their element.</P>
<P>The winter in 1776 was severe in Europe. The cold ex∣ceeded that of 1740. In Denmark the sound was frozen and crossed on sledges. The Thames was also frozen.</P>
<BIBL>An. Register, 1776. 114.</BIBL>
<P>The summer of 1776 in America was hot and in the northern states rainy. The dysentery was prevalent in all parts of the country, and was terribly fatal to the American troops in New-York and at Ticonderoga. I was at Mount Independence in October, and witness to the ravages of the disease. Of thirteen thousand troops, it was said that one half were unfit for duty.</P>
<P>It has been customary to ascribe the prevalence of this mortal disease to infection spread by the soldiers who returned home from the armies. It is certain that the disease was thus introdu∣ced into particular families; but infection was the smallest among the causes of the epidemic. In most places, it originated with∣out any communication from the army; and I was a witness of such instances. The disease was the effect of a particular state of the atmosphere, aided by the seasons.</P>
<P>To prove how unfounded is the opinion that the disease ori∣ginated in the army alone, and spread from that as from a focus, it will be sufficient to mention two facts. The first is, that this epidemic commenced in 1773, <HI>two years before the war,</HI> in which year it was more malignant and fatal, in some places, than in any subsequent year. Witness New-Haven, East-Haven and Salem in Massachusetts.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="036687_0268_100AA24FD2769BB8"/>In 1775 a remarkable fact occurred. About one hundred men belonging to Danbury, in Connecticut, went to join the army on Lake Champlain; they performed their duty and all returned in good health. While they were absent, the dysen∣tery invaded the town and carried off more than one hundred of the inhabitants. In this instance, not a soldier returned from the army, until the disease had subsided.</P>
<P>The second fact is, that the same disease has before raged gen∣erally in this country, with all its horrors, in time of peace. Witn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss the epidemic at Georgetown in Maryland in 1793, at Derby in 1794 and at New-Haven in 1795. In an especial manner, I ought to mention the distressing dysentery, between 1749 and 1753, a time of profound peace, when not a soldier was seen in the country; a period when the disease was as mor∣tal and as general, as between 1773 and 1777. A like epi∣demic prevailed in many countries in Europe at the same time.</P>
<P>I have also taken pains to enquire of physicians in the country, as to the propagation of this disease from the army, and am in∣formed that the disease was as fatal in villages where no inter∣course was had with the troops, as where there was intercourse.</P>
<P>The acquiescence of all descriptions of men, learned and un∣learned, in the opinion that epidemic diseases are to be ascribed solely to infection or specific contagion, has proved extremely injurious to philosophy and to medicin.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A man in my father's neighborhood, was drafted to perform a tour of military duty at New-York, during the revolution-war. He was so much terrified by the apprehension of <HI>catching</HI> the dysentery in the army, that he hired another man as a substitute. The latter went to New-York, performed the duty and returned in health. The draft∣ed man remained at home, was seized with the distemper in a few weeks after, and died.</NOTE> The disease is infec∣tious, but it originates in any place, in particular seasons, whether in peace or war; and ends at the command of the elements and seasons. It ceased at the close of 1777 in the army as well as country, and without any effort which had not been made in pre∣ceding years. It may be observed further that the dysentery was and always is, most prevalent among old people and chil∣dren who have least intercourse with the sick, especially in the country, where no artificial causes of disease exist.</P>
<P><PB N="265" REF="036687_0269_100AA21494D76748"/>In 1777 there was a small earthquake in the interior of Eng∣land, and the London bill of mortality was higher than usual. A volcano in Ferro discharged discolered water, but no lava. The measles appeared in some parts of America, the same year.</P>
<P>The summer of 1778 was excessively hot in America, and fevers of a typhus kind were frequent.

In February 1779, many people along the river Con∣necticut plowed their fields; and in Pennsylvania the peach blos∣somed. The summer succeeding was one of the healthiest ever known in America.</P>
<P>In August 1779 happened a most tremendous eruption of Ve∣suvius; and about the same time, the ships of Capt. Cook, then in a high northern latitude between Kamschatka and America, were covered with ashes which were supposed to be discharged from a volcano on the neighboring continent. In the succeeding winter, Tauris, the capital of Persia, was laid in ruins by an earthquake.</P>

<P>Not only all the rivers, but the harbors and bays in the Uni∣ted States, as far southward as Virginia, were fast bound with ice.

The heavens were obscured with a vapor or cloud of a yellow color or faint red. The cloud which occasioned the principal darkness, passed over Connecticut about the hours of 9 and 10, and continued till after twelve.

The coinci∣dence of these events, in point of time, well deserves notice.

Houses, planta∣tion-buildings, wharves, piers, shipping were all overwhelmed in one general ruin. It is said that, during the tempest, some of the islands experienced an earthquake. Courant, Dec. 12, 1780. Jan. 9, 1781 and Jan. 23, 1781. As hurricanes are occa∣sioned by discharges of electricity, some trembling of the earth almost always attends those which are violent, and flashes of fire are visible. Indeed the atmosphere appears to be a sheet of fire. Similar discharges of electricity attended the tempestuous earth∣quake that destroyed Nicomedia in 358—that which defeated Julian's attempt to rebuild Jerusalem in 362—the hail-storm in Egypt, in the time of Moses—and that which happened at Man∣tua in 1785, to be hereafter related.</P>
<P>The canker-worm made extensive ravages in this period; but I cannot state their rise and decline in different parts of the coun∣try. The winter of 1780-81 exhibited nothing worthy of par∣ticular notice.</P>
<P>In the spring of 1781 prevailed the influenza, or epidemic catarrh. It began with a severe pain in the head, prostration of strength, coldness and chills, the pulse not quick nor tense. The pain in the head lasted about twenty-four hours, and was succeeded by a pain in the side, not pointed nor acute, extend∣ing to the hips, accompanied with a soreness, and resembling a rheumatic pain. The cough was troublesome, full, and the mat∣ter discharged of the glandular kind, not well concocted. Res∣piration was difficult, and a considerable defluxion on the lungs. In a few cases, the disorder terminated in 7 or 8 days; but usu∣ally not till the 13th or 14th; altho the patient was seldom con∣fined to his bed. The disease left a sore<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess and weakness in the side, which continued after the strength was recovered. Vene∣section had little effect on the pain in the side. Epispastrics ap∣plied to the part gave relief. The disorder was seldom fatal, but
<PB N="269" REF="036687_0273_100AA219D00184D8"/>
its effect were very visible in the multiplied cases of pulmonary consumption, in the following year.</P>
<BIBL>M. S. letter from Dr. Tufts.</BIBL>
<P>In the summer following no particular phenomena occurred; the elements were in their usual state, so far as my information extends; and in general the country enjoyed good health. A malignant fever prevailed, in some degree, in New-York, but excited no great alarm.</P>
<P>One year after this influenza in America, the same disease pervaded the eastern hemisphere. Its progress was from Siberia and Tartary westward; and it reached Europe in April and May 1782: I have no account of its course in America, but it seems to be probable, that it took its direction from America westward, and passing the Pacific in high northern latitudes, invaded Asia and Europe from the east. This must have been the case, if the epidemic in Europe was a continuation of that in America. For an account of this epidemic, see the publications of that year.</P>
<P>In 1782 happened considerable earthquakes in Calabria, du∣ring which the mercury in the barometer in Scotland sunk within the tenth of an inch of the bottom of the scale, and the waters in many locks in the highlands were greatly agitated.</P>
<BIBL>Sinclair's Statistical account of Scotland, vol. 6. 622.</BIBL>
<P>In Britain the summer was universally wet and cold, and crops failed, in consequence of which a distressing dearth afflicted Scot∣land in the following year.</P>
<P>In America also the summer was cool. Two or three torna∣does happened in Vermont and New-Hampshire, with deluging rains, and in one place hail of enormous size—the gazette ac∣counts say, pieces of ice were found of 6 inches in length.</P>
<P>The latter part of summer was excessively dry. In New-Jer∣sey, a cedar swamp of 20 miles in length and 8 in breadth, taking fire by accident, was totally consumed. The fire penetrated among the roots to the depth of 6 feet.—Corn, grass, and the very forests withered. The air was loaded with a thick vapor, for some days in September.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reader will judge how far this extreme evaporation and dryness, indicate the action of the internal fires or electricity which produced the tremendous discharges from Heckla in the following year.</NOTE></P>

<P>On the morning of the 5th of February 1783, a thick vapor or fog was observed over the island of Sicily, indicating the agit∣ation of the element of fire or electricity; and about 12 o'clock, a violent shock of earthquake laid many houses in ruins. This was but a prelude to more terrible calamities; for about seven o'clock P. M. a tremendous shock laid in ruins the greatest part of Messina, Calabria and many towns and villages. From 30 to 40,000 persons perished in the ruins. On subsequent days, many shocks were felt, but of less violence. During the con∣vulsions on the 5th, flames were seen to issue from the neighbor∣ing sea.</P>

<P>About this time, for the gazette accounts are not particular as to the month, commenced a most distressing famin in the Car∣natic, which afterwards extended to most of the European set∣tlements in the East-Indies. At Madras hundreds of the na∣tives perished daily, and the streets were filled with dead bodies. The cause was a four years drouth; for during the approach of comets, and the action of subterranean fire in other parts of the world, that country is subject to excessive drouth, as happened in 1769 and 70.</P>

<P>In the evening of the 29th of March the heavens were illu∣minated with a most splendid lumen boreale.</P>
<P>The summer of 1783 was variable in the northern parts of America; in England, it was hot.</P>
<P>In June commenced a most formidable discharge of lava from Mount Heckla in Iceland, which continued till the middle of
<PB N="271" REF="036687_0275_100AA21C4D9274F0"/>
August. The country around the mountain was covered with burning fluid, to the extent of 40 miles, and in some places, to the depth of 40 feet. The lava spread over 3600 square miles.</P>
<P>Previous to this eruption, all the springs and streams of water in the neighborhood had been dried up; a sure forerunner of the discharge of fire; and for some months before the eruption, the atmosphere over the island was filled with a dark, bluish, sul∣phurous vapor or cloud, which was stationary in calm weather, but which was sometimes dispersed by winds, and spread over Europe. See Encyclopedia, article Iceland. During this erup∣tion, a new island was thrown up, at some distance from Iceland. On the 18th of August, soon <HI>after</HI> the eruption of Heckla ceas∣ed, an immense meteor or globe of fire shot through the heav∣ens, from north to south, passing the Orkneys and the island of Great-Britain, and bursting with a loud report.</P>

<P>A part of the summer was excessively hot in America. No less than thirty persons in Philadelphia, killed themselves by drinking cold water. Many putrid fevers were the consequence of the heat in various parts of the country; as also tornadoes and thunder gusts of unusual violence, with hail of uncommon size, in all parts of America. Rarely indeed has so much in∣jury been done by hail in the same space of time.</P>
<P>On the 31st of May a large meteo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or fiery globe was seen at Richmond in Virginia, shooting from north to south. It burst with a heavy report.

<P>During the immense discharges of fire and lava from Heckla, all parts of Europe, Great-Britain, Italy, Sicily, France and even the Alps were overspread with a haziness in the atmosphere. This caused universal consternation, as a similar appearance had preceded the earthquake in Sicily on the 5th of February. The churches were crouded with supplicants. The French astrono∣mer La Lande attempted to quiet the popular fears, by ascribing the phenomenon to a superabundance of watery particles in the
<PB N="272" REF="036687_0276_100AA259A0FD2508"/>
earth, from the moisture of the preceding year, which were then exhaled by the summer heats. But this solution is not satisfact∣ory. It was more probably the smoke from Heckla, wafted by northerly winds and dispersed over Europe, in an attenuated form.</P>

<P>It is still more probable that this vapor was the effect of in∣sensible discharges of electricity, combined with aerial substan∣ces; as in Sicily on the 5th and in America on the 10th of February.</P>
<P>In October occurred tremendous gales of wind and high tides which did no small damage in the seaports of the United States. The first, on the 15th and 16th, occasioned the highest water at New-Haven, which had been known in 40 years. Many other tempests occurred in September and October; and from Vermont to Georgia, the gazettes were filled with accounts of disasters from the violence of the winds and rains.</P>
<BIBL>Courant, October 21, 1783.</BIBL>
<P>On the 29th of November, a considerable shock of earth∣quake was felt in all the northern states; and New-York expe∣rienced two or three shocks in the morning of the next day.</P>

<P>In autumn 1783 some parts of Europe were deluged with continual rains, and at Rome 5 or 6000 children died of the small-pox. About Grenoble raged an epidemic fever.</P>
<P>A distemper among the cattle in Derby in England, occasion∣ed no small alarm, and a royal proclamation was issued enjoin∣ing certain precautions to prevent the propagation of the disease.</P>
<P>Cotemporary with these convulsions of nature, was a most desolating plague in Egypt, the Grecian Isles, Dalmatia, Con∣stantinople, Smyrna and in the Crimea. It is not possible, with the <HI>general</HI> accounts given of such an epidemic, in the public prints, to state, with any precision, its origin and progress in the east. It is mentioned to have appeared in Smyrna, in the spring of 1783, and it certainly raged in Constantinople, and many

<P>In Egypt the same disease committed most terrible ravages in 1783-4 and 5. It began in November 1783. To this calami∣ty was added a severe famin; the inundation of the Nile, in the summer of that year, having proved insufficient. So severe was the plague, that in the winter after 1783, fifteen hundred dead bodies were carried out of Cairo in a day; and the plague and famin of that and the succeeding year, was supposed to car∣ry off one sixth of the inhabitants of Egypt. See Volney's Travels, vol. 1. 192 and 3, and Courant, Oct. 28, 1783, and Oct. 17, 1785, in which it is said that in Cairo 3000 perished in a day in April, 1785.</P>
<P>We have then an exact general view of the phenomena which introduce and accompany pestilence in Europe, Africa and Asia —terrible earthquakes and eruptions of volcanoes; excessive drouth in America, India and Egypt, failure of crops and famin —meteors, great heat and deluges of rain, in other countries. Let us now see what followed these abovementioned agitations of the elements, in our country.</P>

<P>In August 1783, the scarlatina appeared in Philadelphia and in September it became epidemic. It appeared about the same time in Salem, in Massachusetts. It was in Charleston, South-Carolina in 1784, in which year, it appeared in the interior of the northern states, as in Vermont and New-Hampshire, and in Middletown, on Connecticut river. It continued to prevail about five years; but was not severe in general and many towns wholly escaped its attacks.</P>

as May. I find it in all parts of America, in that year, but cannot trace the progress of the epidemic.</P>
<P>During this period neither dysentery nor pestilential autumnal fevers made any considerable ravages in America, as far as I can learn; except at Fell's-Point in Baltimore, where the bil∣ious pestilential fever occasioned a mortality in 1783. Many sporadic cases of a similar fever appeared in various parts of the country, and almost a whole family in New-Jersey perished by it in the autumn of that year. Fortunately however the consti∣tution of the elements was corrected, without producing its most fatal effects. Even the scarlet fever, with the exception of a few places, was less malignant than it has been in the last period.</P>
<P>This pestilential constitution was felt also in the north of Eu∣rope. The scarlatina broke out in Edinburgh in the winter of 1782-3, a few months before it did in America; but of its progress I have no account. It appears to have been epidemic in London in 1786; so that its period was of about the same duration as in America. The cotemporaneousness of this species of disease in Great-Britain and America, deserves particular no∣tice.</P>
<P>In December happened a fog in Amsterdam of such density as to occasion complete obscurity for three hours in the middle of the day. It was not possible for persons to find their way in the streets, and many passengers and some carriages fell into the canals.</P>

<P>The severity of the winter succeeding these phenomena, both in Europe and America, corresponded with their extraordinary number and violence. The weather was less uniformly cold than in 1780, but the frost, in some parts of the winter was most intense. The following was the state of Farenheit's ther∣mometer, at Hartford.</P>

<P>On the 20th of January was discovered a comet in Pisces, which was involved in a luminous atmosphere. It was visible about four weeks.</P>
<P>The severe cold commenced early; the Delaware at Philadel∣phia was closed at the beginning of December, and continued bound with ice till the middle of March; notwithstanding a re∣laxation of cold and a heavy rain in January. The gazettes state that such intense cold had not been known in that city, since 1750-51.—The Missisippi was reported to be covered with ice, as far south as New-Orleans. At the breaking up of winter, the thaw was sudden, and immense bodies of ice, floating down the rivers, which were greatly swelled, spread ruin along the low lands on their banks. Great damage was sustained on the banks of the Schuylkill, Susquehanna, Potomack and James rivers.</P>

<P>In Europe, the winter was no less severe—an instance in which a severely cold winter in Europe coincided in time, with the same in America. It may be remarked also that this win∣ter was just one century after the coincidence of like events; the winter of 1683-4 being equally severe in both hemispheres.</P>
<P>In 1783-4 the river Liffey in Ireland, the Thames in Eng∣land, and all the rivers in the interior of Holland, were cover∣ed with solid ice. In Holland, the ice gave way about the first of March, and the rivers being greatly swelled, the adjacent country was inundated, with immense loss of lives and property. The river Waal, near Nimeguen, broke through its dikes and overwhelmed 34 villages. The Rhine from Cologne and Man∣heim, exhibited similar scenes of devastation.</P>

<P>The wheat-insect, which has been ignorantly and improperly named the Hessian Fly, committed uncommon ravages in this year. The precise time when this insect originated, is not ascer∣tained, probably about the year 1776, or a year or two earlier. Little notice was taken of it, for two or three years. In 1780, Mr. Underhill of Long Island lost his wheat crops by the in∣sect; and in subsequent years, it penetrated into New-Jersey, travelling, according to common opinion, about 15 or 20 miles in a year. In 1785, it occasioned unusual destruction of wheat —and such was the alarm in England, for fear it should prove <HI>infectious,</HI> and be introduced into that country, that the King is∣sued a proclamation dated June 25, 1788, prohibiting the im∣portation of American wheat.—This event excited no small un∣easiness in America, especially in the states, whose staple is wheat. Whereupon the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania re∣quested the opinion of the Agricultural Society, as to the man∣ner by which that insect is propagated. To this request, the So∣ciety returned for answer, their decided opinion that it is the plant alone which is injured by the insect; that the grain is sound and good, and that the insect is not propagated by sowing wheat which grew on fields infected with it.</P>
<BIBL>See Museum, vol. 4. 244. Am. Magazine.</BIBL>
<P>The prohibition by the King and Council of Great-Britain was deemed a judicious precaution; but was the fruit of an error that pervades the world, respecting the powers of <HI>infection</HI> and <HI>contagion.</HI> The opinion of the Agricultural Society is well foun∣ded, but it remains for time and the force of truth to convince the people of Philadelphia, that the yellow fever can no more be transplanted and rendered epidemic by infection, than the wheat-insect. Both are <HI>diseases,</HI> originating where they have a suitable aliment, and ceasing to exist, when that aliment fails.</P>
<P>The prohibition of the British government was repealed the next year; under the apprehension of a dearth.</P>

<P>On the 25th of August happened in the West-Indies one of the most dreadful hurricanes ever known, and equal to that of 1772 or that of 1780. This tempest was preceded by very sultry heat, and the phenomenon called <HI>looming,</HI> by which distant ob∣jects at sea appear to be raised higher or brot nearer than at other times, I have often noticed this singular effect of the powers of refraction in the air, previous to storms, of which it is the usual forerunner. Guadaloupe, St. Croix and the other wind∣ward islands were laid desolate by this tempest. On the 27th of August, the leeward islands suffered a similar calamity. On the 24th of September, an easterly storm brought into the riv∣ers in the southern states, as high a tide as ever was known.— Norfolk was inundated, with great loss.</P>
<P>Sickness was very general in many parts of the United States. The scarlatina was prevalent, and the gazettes mention a pre∣cinct in Ulster in which died almost every child under six years of age. Many adults also fell victims to this or other maladies.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VIII. Historical view of pestilential epedemics, from the year 1788 to 1798 inclusive, comprehending the last epidemic period in America.</HEAD>
<P>THE winter of 1787-8 was colder than usual in America, but not of great severity.</P>
<P>In Europe prevailed epidemic catarrh in 1788. It appeared at Vienna in April—was in Poland and Russia in May—at Lon∣don in June—and at Paris in August. In St. Luke's Hospital, it began on the 16th of July, and a few cases occurred till Nov. 10th; but only twenty-five persons out of 190 were affected; a proof that it has little contagion. Gent. Mag. 1789. 346. The invasion of this epidemic was less sudden than usual.</P>
<P>On the 22d of July was a violent tempest from the N. E. which occasioned a very high tide in the Chesapeek, and no small damage. This is a singular occurrence. A north-east gale in June or July on the American coast, must be attributed to some extraordinary cause; and perhaps this may be ascribed to the approach of a comet, which appeared in October and No∣vember following. This comet was predicted by Mr. Herschel, who made previous preparations for examining it.</P>
<BIBL>Courant, August 11, and 25, and April 28, 1788.</BIBL>
<P>The summer was remarkably tempestuous. On the 29th of August, a severe gale of wind did great damage in many of our ports. Of 30 sail of vessels, in certain rivers and bays of North-Carolina, 26 were destroyed. A tempest in the begin∣ning of the month had been terribly destructive. No one event is more certain, than a vast increase of tempestuous weather du∣ring the approach of comets. The tempest of the 19th exten∣ded over the whole face of the country, penetrating to Vermont, levelling buildings, trees and corn. Many cattle and one child

<P>It is remarkable that this tempest in the United States was but two or three days after a tremendous hurricane among the windward islands, which was supposed to do more injury than the great tempest of 1766. At the leeward also the same calamity befel the islands. In Martinico the barometer fell nearly to 27 inches.</P>
<BIBL>Courant, Oct. 27, 1788.</BIBL>
<P>About the same time similar disasters befel France and Eng∣land. A tornado of great violence occurred about Paris, in which, the gazettes declare, fell hail-stones of 8lb. weight. Du∣ring a tempest in London, a fire ball entered a house and struck down two persons.</P>
<BIBL>Courant, Oct. 27, 1788.</BIBL>
<P>In the West-Indies hurricanes were repeated in September with destructive rage.</P>
<P>On the evening of the 17th of October 1788 was seen, at various places, in Connecticut and New-York, a meteor or fire ball, whose apparent diameter was equal to that of the sun in the meridian. It passed from the eastward to the westward with amazing rapidity, illuminating the earth, and approaching near the western horizon, it burst with a heavy report.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This meteor was seen at Poughkeepsie, on the Hudson, nearly in the zenith. In Suffex county, west of Cape Henlopen, it appeared to be about ten degrees above, the horizon, Courant, Dec. 8, 1788.</NOTE></P>

<P>The eastern parts of Europe were sickly during the summer of 1788. The immense armies on foot, in the war between the Austrians, Russians and Turks, contributed to increase the mortality. It was estimated that 80,000 Austrians perished, mostly by disease. The year however was generally healthy.</P>
<P>The winter of 1788-9 was colder than usual in the United States. On the morning of the 2d of February, the mercury in Farenheit fell to 28 deg. below cypher; 4 degrees lower than had before been observed in Hartford. The season how∣ever was on the whole less severe than in 1780 and 1784.</P>

<P>It should have been related under the year 1788, that almost all the cod-fish taken on the banks of Newfoundland, in that year, were thin and sickly; when dried, they were of a dark or bluish color, little better than skeletons, and not well received in foreign markets. This condition of that fish was confined to those banks; as the cod taken at other places were in their usual state.</P>
<BIBL>M. S. letter from Dr. Holyoke.</BIBL>
<P>On the 28th of May 1789, appeared in Connecticut a most singular halo, of which the public prints contain a particular de∣scription. This phenomenon seems to indicate the approach of tempestuous weather, and was in this instance, followed by a heavy wind and rain. But when this appearance is of singular brightness or extent, it indicates a state of the atmosphere highly electrified perhaps and certainly tempestuous, and storms are numerous and violent. Thus the remarkable hurricanes of
<PB N="286" REF="036687_0290_100AA26ADE83FF18"/>
1780 were preceded by as remarkable haloes. The halo of May 28th was preceded by a most splendid lumen boreale.</P>
<P>The instance under consideration was surprising and to gloomy minds, awful. A clergyman, since dead, wrote a moral essay on the occasion in which he predicted great calami∣ties to happen; and he mentioned other events, of that period, as unusual numbers of flies, caterpillars, locusts, and dearth of corn, in confirmation of his opinion that the arm of the Lord was extended in wrath over our land.</P>
<BIBL>Courant, June 8, 1789, and June 15.</BIBL>
<P>It is true that our crops had been thin, in the preceding year, and the northern states, in the spring of 1789, experienced a dearth, approaching to famin. In Vermont, people were re∣duced to the necessity of feeding on tad-poles boiled with pea∣straw. In one instance four potatoes sold for nine pence. None of the human race were actually starved to death, but a few died of a flux in consequence of bad diet.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In old settlements, there was food enough for man, but the failure of a surplus in this country, is a rare event.</NOTE> Cattle however perished in considerable numbers.

<P>On the 10th of July a most tremendous earthquake convulsed Iceland. Large chasms were opened in the earth, and some mountains were rent asunder. Several shocks happened on sub∣sequent days, and a violent shock in September is mentioned in the 6th volume of Sinclair's Statistical works, 625.</P>

<P>On the 30th of September occurred a violent earthquake in Tuscany, by which some villages were destroyed and several thou∣sand lives.

If they were killed, it would seem probable that other fish in the same seas, would have shared the same fate; which does not ap∣pear to have been the case; for the accounts make no mention of the death of other kinds. And what renders it probable that they died of disease, and a disease peculiar to that kind of fish, it, that for some years after, no haddock came to the markets in Scotland, as before that mortality. That species appeared to be almost extinct; whereas there is no mention made of a failure of other kinds of fish. Careful observations and precise dates would assist our researches into the causes of these wonderful phenomena.</P>

<BIBL>Courant, January 4, 1790.</BIBL>
<P>It will be observed that this darkness, and the beginning of the influenza in America coincide nearly in time with the erup∣tion of Vesuvius, and many earthquakes.</P>
<P>Such universal disorders in the elements never fail to produce epidemic diseases; and those here related were the heralds of the most severe period of sickness that has occurred in the United States for 30 years.</P>
<P>The first appearance of that series of epidemics to be hereaf∣ter described, seems to have been in the measles at New-York in November 1788, and at Philadelphia in December following. This disease became epidemic over the northern states in 1789, but I have not the means of describing its progress. I find, in bills of mortality, from various places, deaths by measles are mentioned in 1789 and 90.</P>
<P>In autumn 1789 appeared the influenza or epidemic catarrh. The precise time and place of its appearance, are not ascertained. Some accounts say, it originated in Canada. But I shall con∣fine my observations to its progress in Atlantic America. It was first observed about the close of September 1789, in New-York
<PB N="289" REF="036687_0293_100AA2324E442150"/>
and Philadelphia. Dr. Rush informs me, that it was brought to Philadelphia by the members of Congress, who returned from New-York, about the first of October. Another account, writ∣ten by one of the faculty in Philadelphia, and published in the 7th volume of the Museum, mentions its first appearance there, about the time of the Friends Yearly Meeting, in September. The precise time is probably not ascertainable; the opinion of its propagation by infection is very fallacious, as I know by repeat∣ed observations. It probably appeared in detached cases, some days before it became a subject of observation.</P>
<BIBL>Museum, vol. 7. 231.</BIBL>
<P>From the middle states, it moved rapidly over the whole coun∣try. It appeared in Hartford, where I then resided, about the middle of October. On the 19th of that month, I left Hart∣ford for Boston and arrived the next day in good health. I was seized with the influenza on the 23d, and by the aid of a dilu∣ting regimen, recovered in four days. No person who attended me was seized with the distemper, sooner than the other inhabi∣tants of that town. I mention this to disprove the common opin∣ion of its infection; not that I deny it to be in a degree, infec∣tious; altho my own observations do not warrant that conces∣sion; but I aver that its propagation depends almost entirely on the insensible qualities of the atmosphere. Two ladies who left Boston with me on the second of November, before the disease had appeared in their family, and before it was a subject of con∣versation, were seized with it in Hartford, at the same time, that it became epidemic in Boston, one on the 8th and the other on the 12th.—The disease had then passed Hartford, and there is no evidence of their being exposed to any person infected. This fact shows a regular progress in the state of air producing the dis∣ease —as persons leaving Boston and travelling one hundred and twenty miles distance, were effected precisely at the time the disease became epidemic in that town.</P>
<P>This disease pervaded the wilderness and seized the Indians— it spread over the ocean and attacked seamen a hundred leagues from land, and as to infection, entirely insulated—it appeared in the West-Indies nearly at the time it did in the northern
<PB N="290" REF="036687_0294_100AA26F51271D00"/>
states. It overspread America, from the 15th to the 45th de∣gree of latitude in about 6 or 8 weeks; and how much further it extended, I am not informed.</P>
<P>It should have been mentioned that, in September, anterior to the invasion of the catarrh, the scarlatina anginosa appeared in Philadelphia; but in October it yielded to the influenza, the controlling epidemic. The scarlet fever re-appeared in Decem∣ber, and became epidemic; often blending itself with the influ∣enza. It exhibited one predominant feature of the whole series of succeeding epidemics, a prevalence of bilious matter, which was often discharged by purging and vomiting. This disease con∣tinued to prevail in Philadelphia, and if my information is cor∣rect, in some parts of New-Jersey, till the spring of 1790. The measles occurred in some cases, but was not epidemic.</P>
<BIBL>Museum, vol. 7. 120, 175.</BIBL>
<P>It is remarkable that the scarlatina anginosa was cotemporary in Edinburgh with the epidemic measles in America in 1789, and nearly so, with the death of the haddock on the coast of Norway.</P>
<P>It will be observed that the scarlet fever, tho epidemic in Philadelphia, did not spread over the country in 1790. It was little known in the northern states, till two years after—this is among the proofs that this disease does not depend on infection for its propagation. If infection was its only or principal means of propagation, the fomites existed in great abundance, in par∣ticular places in 1790, and sufficient to have spread it over the United States. But a disease however infectious, will not spread far in an atmosphere that will not generate it. Indeed scarcely a year passes in which sporadic cases of scarlatina, or anginas of other kinds do not appear in particular places; but they never spread without some uncommon concurrence of causes.</P>
<P>The winter of 1789-90 was one of the mildest that is ever known in this country; there being little frost, except for a few days in February. There fell frequent snows and in great abun∣dance; but they were immediately followed by warm southerly winds, and dissolved.</P>
<P>Early in the spring of 1790 we had a second epidemic ca∣tarrh. I was attentive to its origin and progress. I found it at
<PB N="291" REF="036687_0295_100AA234741D4348"/>
Albany in the last week in March, and heard of it in Vermont about the same time. I returned to Hartford, but altho exposed repeatedly to its infection on my journey, I was not seized earlier than others in Hartford, where the disease appeared about the middle of April. It spread to the southward, arrived at Phi∣ladelphia near the close of that month, and disappeared in that city about the middle of June. In the northern states, as far as my knowledge extends, the disease was more violent, than in the preceding autumn. Many plethoric persons of firm habit almost sunk under it; while consumptive people and hard drink∣ers fell its victims.</P>
<BIBL>Museum, vol. 8. 65.</BIBL>
<P>The spring and summer of 1790 were mostly rainy; but oth∣erwise seasonable weather. No remarkable epidemics prevailed, except those already described, but an increase of mortality, in some places, is visible in the registers of deaths. Severe earth∣quakes occurred on the African coast.</P>
<P>Let it be observed that the measles appeared in autumn 1788, just after great volcanic eruptions, and a most tempestuous sum∣mer, when the element of fire appeared to be in universal com∣motion; just after the meteor, and during the appearance of the comet.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In 1732 a dark day occurred in August <HI>preceding</HI> the influenza. In 1789 a darkness at Kentucky occurred, <HI>during</HI> the epidemic catarrh.</NOTE> Let it be observed also that the harvest failed, at this time, in China, India, Europe and America, and let any man deny the all-controlling influence of the elements in producing these events.</P>
<P>The winter of 1790-91 commenced early and with severe weather. The last week in November was cold; Connecticut river at Hartford was closed with ice on the 9th of December, and not open till the 12th of March. On the whole, the season was not of unusual severity. The spring and early part of sum∣mer were, in most parts of the country, very dry, until the middle of June.</P>
<P>On the 15th of January, a considerable shock of earthquake was experienced at Richmond in Virginia. At the same time catarrhs were so prevalent in that state and in Pennsylvania, as to excite an apprehension of another visit of the influenza.
<PB N="292" REF="036687_0296_100AA271946FF2E8"/>
Inflammatory diseases were very frequent during the winter. In Philadelphia the scarlatina anginosa appeared late in January and was very prevalent in February. In the interior of Carolina it was sickly, but I have no particulars. The whooping cough prevailed in many parts of the country.</P>
<BIBL>Courant, Jan. 21, 1790. See Museum, vol. 9. 65.</BIBL>
<P>In the month of April, some fishermen at the Narrows, near New-York, caught fourteen thousand shad at a single draft; to secure which, it was necessary to add several seines, one upon the other. This circumstance is mentioned, because several medical authors have related that an extraordinary abundance of fish is among the precursors of pestilence. It will be noted that the pestilential fever, which has prevailed for many years past, first appeared in New-York, in the autumn succeeding this sin∣gular draft of fish.</P>

<P>On the 16th of May, at half past 10 o'clock P. M. in a serene, moon-light night, an extensive earthquake was felt in the northern states.

<P>On the morning after the earthquake, was observed at Mid∣dletown in Connecticut, a substance like honey or butter, cov∣ering the grass and earth for a considerable extent. See an ac∣count of a similar phenomenon in Ireland under the year 1695.</P>
<P>To these phenomena succeeded in Connecticut the generation of millions of that species of black worm, described under the year 1770. I believe they were far less numerous than in 1770; they however appeared in Hartford and in Norwich, and dis∣appeared at the same time. They were very destructive to the grass and corn, but their existence was short; all dying in a few weeks.</P>

Orchards, standing on stiff clay and in low grounds which are wet in spring, escaped; but on every species of light and dry soil, the trees were as dry on the first of June, as on the first of January.

Certain it is that pigeons in the summer of 1791 were unusually numerous. In Maine, there were tracts of forest of miles in extent, the trees of which were covered with their nests.</P>

<P>The summer of 1791 was excessively hot. At Salem the thermometer was at and above 80 deg. no less than 55 days, and above 90, twelve days—an instance that had not happened in many years, in that cool place; altho it often happens in the middle states.</P>

<P><PB N="294" REF="036687_0298_100AA2DB52A18418"/>In autumn, bilious remittents assumed, in Philadelphia, the inflammatory diathesis, so predominant in the last pestilential constitution. Dr. Rush, in his public lectures, mentioned this fact at the time, altho he little suspected what effects that con∣stitution was to produce in subsequent years. It was found ne∣cessary to bleed from one to three times. In most cases, the liver was affected with all the symptoms of Hepatitis.</P>
<BIBL>M. S. letter from Dr. Rush.</BIBL>
<P>At this period the pestilential or epidemic constitution of the atmosphere began to show itself in the infectious yellow fever. It appeared in New-York, in autumn, along the east river, and carried off about 200 persons. This gave some alarm, which soon subsided.</P>
<P>It must be noted that the measles in 1788, the disease which marched in the van of this series of epidemics, appeared first in New-York—this was probably the fact also in regard to the in∣fluenza of the succeeding year—and the scarlatina anginosa at the close of 1792. The scarlatina of 1789 and 91 in Philadel∣phia was local, or if it appeared in a few other places, it did not spread over the country. All the last great epidemics have ori∣ginated nearly in the same longitude between Connecticut and Pennsylvania. It is not to be concluded from this fact that they have been propagated by infection from one spot, as from a cen∣ter; we know this is not the fact; the same diseases originating in remote places.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The mild scarlatina, the herald of the epidemic, appeared at New-York and at Bethlem in Connecticut, in 1792, in the same month.</NOTE> But it serves to show that the cause or prin∣ciple of disease in the elements is of various force, and will first show its effects in places where it has the most strength.</P>
<P>In the same summer of 1791, the pestilential principle began to exhibit its effects in the increased malignancy of the tropical fevers. The "unusual epidemic fever" in Grenada, described by Dr. Chisholm, in the Edinburgh Medical Commentaries for 1793, and which was the occasion of no small surprise, was the commencement of that series of fatal diseases, which, in subse∣quent years, made dreadful havoc in the Islands. This fever became so violent and infectious, contrary to the common fever
<PB N="295" REF="036687_0299_100AA239266FA920"/>
of the tropics, that a labored attempt was made to trace it to fomites from the coast of Africa. The truth is, the fever was nothing more than the common fever of the climate, with the super added malignancy derived from the existing constitution of the elements. The same fact took place on the African coast; that is, the usual fevers of the climate became more malignant.</P>
<P>This idea is suggested by a series of similar events in other cli∣mates; all the diseases of America, at the same time, assuming a similar augmented violence, and sporadic cases of malignant fever appearing in all parts of our country. Such has been the fact in all other epidemic periods.</P>
<P>To confirm this idea, let it be observed that in the same year, when this malignant fever appeared in the African Seas on board of ships, in Grenada, and in New-York, as well as in sporadic cases in other parts of America, the plague carried off two or three hundred thousand people,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These numbers are to be suspected of exaggeration.</NOTE> in Egypt, and raged in Constan∣tinople with great mortality. In all these distant countries, the same or similar effects were nearly cotemporary. The plague in Egypt continued into the next year; but I have no details of its progress and termination. The same general principle was ex∣perienced in Great-Britain, and the bills of mortality in London continued to swell, till the year 1793.</P>
<P>The winter of 1791-2 was somewhat colder than usual. The month of January was remarkable for severe weather of three weeks duration. In March a slight earthquake was felt in the middle states, but I have no particulars.</P>

<P>In the northern states there was a period of singularly cold weather in the beginning of June, occasioned by a dry N. E. wind. Some persons used fires as late as the tenth day of that month. The heat of the following summer, in general, was not extreme.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="036687_0300_100AA355E5435A38"/>In May and June, a species of locusts appeared in the north∣ern parts, of the state of New-York, which committed ravages among the grain.

<P>In November 1792 several smart shocks of earthquake were felt in Perthshire, a county in Scotland.</P>
<P>In Philadelphia appeared an insect in the form of a fly, which generated a small worm or caterpillar, that attacked the tree, called Lime Tree, which is there used for shade. From that year to the year 1798, this insect has ravaged those trees, and destroyed some of them. Just philosophy will not hesitate to believe the cause of this phenomenon and of the pestilence suc∣ceeding, to be connected.</P>
<P>In this year, 1792, commenced that scarlatina anginosa which became epidemic, with great mortality. I regret that a want of exact registers, will not permit me to trace it to its sources with the precision desireable in all such cases. I am informed that well defined cases of the disease were observed in New-York, as early as the month of August. But it occasioned no considera∣ble mortality in that city, until the following winter.</P>
<P>At Bethlem, in the western part of Connecticut, there were five deaths in this year by the cynanche trachealis. I have not heard of any other instance. In August, there were seven or eight cases of the scarlatina anginosa, but so mild as <HI>not to prove mortal.</HI> The reader will note the last circumstance; for I am
<PB N="297" REF="036687_0301_100AA322819AACD0"/>
able to prove, that this disease in Connecticut, was progressive in a remarkable manner, and from the fact, which I believe is not uncommon, will be drawn most important consequences.</P>
<P>The autumn was one of the mildest ever known, November was so warm that we sat with open windows, at Hartford, on the 19th of the month. This moderate weather was succeeded by severe cold, and Connecticut river was closed by ice on the 10th of December. The latter part of winter however was not very severe, except a week or two in February.</P>
<P>On the 11th of January 1793 appeared a comet in the con∣stellation of Cepheus. It was seen for the last time by Mr. Rit∣tenhouse on the 8th of February.</P>
<BIBL>Phil. Trans. Phil. vol. 3.</BIBL>
<P>In the course of this winter and the spring succeeding, the scarlet fever raged in New-York, with considerable mortality. It became epidemic also in Philadelphia, in the course of the spring months.</P>
<P>Catarrh was very prevalent in the northern states, at the same time; and the small-pox by inoculation at Hartford proved un∣usually obstinate and fatal; indicating an insalubrious state of the atmosphere.</P>
<P>In February 1793 the scarlet fever invaded the town of Beth∣lem, like "an armed man," says Mr. Backus, Medical Reposi∣tory, vol. 1. 524. He calls the disease angina maligna, and it doubtless put on the symptoms of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in many places. It seized almost every family and child. It abated in May, disappeared in November, and re-appeared in January 1794 with nearly its former violence. Nineteen children died in the first invasion, and fourteen, in the second.</P>
<P>We have here distinct marks of progression. The disease in a mild form appeared in August 1792, then disappeared. In February following, it invaded the town in its worst form. Six months therefore intervened between its precursor, or mild form, and its invasion with full force.</P>
<P>The same disease appeared in the neighboring district of coun∣try and in distant parts, in nearly the same longitude, in the course of this year; but I have not materials for a detail of facts.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="036687_0302_100AA2EBF4BE4DD8"/>I find however, it prevailed in Litchfield in 1793, and was supposed to be imported into that town from Vermont. It was also very mortal in New-Fairfield, the same year. I therefor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> presume the disease to have been very general through the western districts of Connecticut, Massachusetts and Vermont, and to have prevailed as far westward as Pennsylvania, in this year. Of its progress beyond that state, I have no information.</P>
<P>In September and October of this year, about the time the distemper subsided in Bethlem, it began to exhibit appearances of approach, in the maritime towns of Connecticut. Its precur∣sors at New-Haven, as described by Dr. Monson, a good judge of the subject, were "slight influenza, slinging pains in the jaws and limbs, soreness in the muscles of the neck, with a slight fever."</P>
<P>In November and December following, several cases of ulce∣rous sore throat occurred, but they had a favorable issue, and the symptoms were not alarming.</P>
<P>In January 1794 arrived the crisis of this disease; it put on its malignant symptoms, and in the course of the six following months, seized more than seven hundred persons, principally youth, of whom died fifty two.</P>
<BIBL>See Dr. Monson's account in my Collection, p. 173.</BIBL>
<P>Here again is distinctly marked a regular progression of symp∣toms from September to January; the precursors being four or five months in advance of the disease in its most violent form.</P>
<P>In Hartford, on Connecticut river, about thirty miles east of Litchfield and Bethlem, I had an opportunity to make per∣sonal observations on the origin and progress of this epidemic.</P>
<P>I do not know the date of the first case: but in my own mem∣oranda, its appearance in my eldest daughter, then in the 3d year of her age, is noted under the 12th of May 1793. The attending physician informed me, that the disease was then epi∣demic. Its first appearance therefore must have been a week or two earlier.</P>
<P>This disease was a mild scarlatina anginosa. The patient had considerable fever—the parosisms were daily, and terminated in prosuse sweats—there was a partial efflorescence of the skin about the neck and breast, and some affection of the throat. Its crisis,
<PB N="299" REF="036687_0303_100AA325F7FFD890"/>
if I do not misremember, was about the eighth day. I was inform∣ed that in no case, did this disease prove mortal, during this in∣vasion.</P>
<P>The reader will observe the dates—this mild angina invaded Hartford in April and May, about the time, the severity of the disease began to abate in Bethlem.</P>
<P>Nine months after the invasion of this mild angina, that is, in February 1794, this disease appeared in Hartford in its formida∣ble array, and many children became its victims.</P>
<P>Nothing can prove more clearly that infection had no concern in the origin of this distemper, than this gradual augmentation of its symptoms. If any fact were necessary to demonstrate the all-controlling influence of the elements, in the propagation and ter∣mination of the disease, this <HI>progression</HI> alone would be sufficient. The mild epidemic of May 1793, was the same species of disease with that which was then destroying life, in the western parts of the state, and in New-York and Pennsylvania; but the condition of the atmosphere at Hartford was not, at that time, fitted to give the disease its full degree of violence. The summer season perhaps suspended the operation of the general cause, by means to us unknown. In February following arrived the crisis of the disease.</P>
<P>I know not whether other epidemic anginas have been charac∣terized by the same progressiveness in the symptoms. It is not improbable that they have; and that age after age has passed away, without noticing the circumstance; a circumstance that throws more light on the origin, causes and philosophy of epi∣demics, than all the dissertations on the subject, since the days of Hippocrates.</P>
<P>My own children were affected with the mild angina in May. I removed, with my family, to New-York in November 1793, <HI>before</HI> the fatal angina invaded Hartford, and <HI>after</HI> it had finished its course in New-York; my children escaped its violence, and probably in consequence of this removal. This was an acciden∣tal circumstance in my family, but I suspect a similar removal of children, during the progress of that malady, might save a mul∣titude of lives; altho the circumstances of many people will not
<PB N="300" REF="036687_0304_100AA2EE2AE775A0"/>
permit them to avail themselves of the expedient; and in some cases probably it would fail of success. It however deserves con∣sideration. The angina had completed its course in New-York in 1793 or nearly. It did not invade Boston till 1795. A re∣moval of the children from the atmosphere of Boston in 1795, to an atmosphere where the disease had ceased, would probably have secured most of them from an attack.</P>
<P>The summer of 1793 was excessively hot, after a dry spring, and produced a great number of violent gusts, with rain and hail. The autumn was very dry. A fatal dysentery prevailed in Georgetown, on the Potomak, and in the vicinity, which swept away many hundreds of the inhabitants. The same disease prevailed in Coventry, in Connecticut, and killed almost every person whom it seized. A nervous or long fever prevailed in Wethersfield. In short, in most parts of the United States, the pestilential principle exhibited its effects, in some form or other, and every where swelled the bills of mortality. It extended to the West Indies, and so violent was the epidemic at Grenada, that the physicians and inhabitants, unable to account for it, re∣ally supposed it an imported disease. The treatise written by Dr. Chisholm to prove it imported, is satisfactory evidence to me that the disease was an epidemic. The disease corresponds in its prin∣cipal character, with the pestilential fevers of this country, many of which are known to be generated in our own climate.</P>
<P>In August 1793 commenced in Philadelphia that dreadful pestilence which alarmed the United States, and spread terror and dismay over that city. The spring diseases, which ushered in this malady, were influenza, scarlatina and mild bilious re∣mittents. See Rush's Treatise on that fever. These are the most certain and immediate precursors of pestilence, in this country; and the influenza seems to be so, in all countries.</P>
<P>During this epidemic, the weather was very sultry and dry. A∣bout the 12th of September, fell a meteor between the city and the hospital. The number of victims to this disease was 4040.</P>
<P>A controversy arose among the physicians in Philadelphia, relative to the origin of the plague, one party tracing the dis∣ease, as they supposed, to infected vessels from the West-Indies;
<PB N="301" REF="036687_0305_100AA3281AAB4D10"/>
the other ascribing it to exhalations from damaged coffee and filthy streets. This controversy has occasioned an unhappy schism among the medical gentlemen, and the citizens of Phi∣ladelphia.</P>
<P>It is greatly to be regretted that gentlemen of the faculty committed themselves, by prematurely giving positive opinions on that important question, and thus laying the foundation for permanent evils to the country. It would have been wiser to have instituted a regular enquiry into historical facts, relating to pestilential diseases, antecedent to any positive decisions on the subject.</P>
<P>By an account of the deaths in Algiers, kept by Capt. O'Brien, while a prisoner, I perceive that 4893 persons died in 1793 by the measles and plague. There was a considerable increase of mortality in that year; and we observe the measles and plague prevalent in the same year—an evidence that on the Barbary coast, as well as in Europe and America, these epidemics are allied.</P>
<P>By this account also it appears that in 1789 a number of per∣sons died by the <HI>asthma.</HI> It is not probable this was epidemic, and I suspect by this name was intended catarrh or influenza. As this disease was then epidemic in the United States, it would be gratifying to know whether the same epidemic prevailed on the African coast, at the same time.</P>
<P>It is remarkable that in the spring of 1793, when the scarla∣tina anginosa had first commenced its progress in America, it began also in England. It appeared first in the villages about London, and afterwards descended into the city. Med. Mem. vol. 4. It continued to prevail for several years, with different degrees of violence, at different times. See the Monthly Mag∣azines.</P>
<P>The winter of 1793-4 was milder than usual in America. The thermometer in New-York, in a northern exposure, descen∣ded no lower than 13 deg. above 0, and but twice to that degree.</P>
<P>On the 17th of May was a singularly severe frost in the northern states of America, which destroyed garden vegetables and the leaves of trees. The wheat, oats and flax in many places turned yellow, and fruit was destroyed.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="036687_0306_100AA2EFB244E968"/>This frost was preceded by a few remarkable hot days, such as we usually have in June; and speedily followed by a long se∣ries of rains, with easterly winds.</P>
<P>This frost has been supposed to kill the canker-worms, which had ravaged the orchards, for some years preceding. Another opinion is, that a hard frost in April, destroyed them, just after they were hatched. A third opinion is, that they had run thro their period of existence, and perished in a natural way. In confirmation of which opinion, it is said they were evidently declining in the preceding year. There is probably truth in both the latter opinions.</P>
<P>The summer of 1794 was, on the whole, not intemperate. We had hot weather, but frequently was the earth refreshed by showers, and cool westerly winds. The whooping cough pre∣vailed in New-York.</P>
<P>The scarlet fever, in the course of this year, spread over Con∣necticut. Its effects are very apparent in the bills of mortality.</P>
<P>It appeared in 1795 in Boston, in the spring or early in sum∣mer, and continued to prevail in Massachusetts and New-Hamp∣shire in 1796. Its progress from New-York to Maine, about 300 miles or perhaps 400, was run in about four years. It trav∣elled therefore about 100 miles in a year. Such also was the fact in the preceding period; as well as in 1735. It should be observed also that its direction, in the two last epidemic periods, has been opposite to that of the disease of 1735. The latter began in New-Hampshire and marched to the westward; the former began in the middle states, and advanced to the eastward.</P>
<P>On the 10th of June 1794, the bilious plague made its ap∣pearance in New-Haven, a seaport in Connecticut. The person first seized with the disease was, the wife of Isaac Gorham, liv∣ing on the wharf, and the nature of her complaint was not un∣derstood, nor suspected, till near the time of her death, on the 15th.</P>
<P>No sooner was it known that a pestilential fever was in the city, than the inhabitants took the alarm, and directed an exam∣ination to be made into the causes. On enquiry, the following appeared to be the sources of the disease, or were reported to be the probable causes.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="036687_0307_100AA32A8D3BAA30"/>In the beginning, of June, Capt. Truman arrived from Mar∣tinico, in a sloop, which was hauled up by the store of Mr. Eli∣jah Austin, a few rods from the house of Mr. Gorham. This sloop was <HI>supposed</HI> to be infected with the pestilential fever of the West-Indies. From this sloop was landed a chest of clothes, which had belonged to a seaman who died with the fever in Martinico; which chest was opened and the contents inventoried by Mr. Austin, in his store, in presence of Capt. Truman, of Henry Hubbard, a clerk in the store, and of Polly Gorham, a niece of Isaac Gorham. Mr. Austin and his clerk were seized, a few days after the opening of this chest, (but how many days is not stated) and died about the 20th of June, Polly Gorham was seized on the 12th and died on the 17th of June.</P>
<P>These circumstances appeared to the people at that time, to be clear and decisive evidence of the importation of the fomites of the disease; and especially the fact, that Mr. Austin and his clerk were attacked with the symptoms, nearly at the same time. This acquiescence in an opinion so important to society and truth, renders it necessary to state the result of more careful enquiries.</P>
<P>In the first place, the opinion that the sloop could communi∣cate the infection, is unfounded; for it does not appear that any person, ill with yellow fever, had been on board—there cer∣tainly had not been any sick on board, after her leaving Martin∣ico. The sloop was taken by the British troops, when they took that island, and lay in port some weeks, unoccupied; until Capt. Truman had an opportunity to purchase her. In the mean time, some of the crew, to keep themselves employed and procure bread, went in the business of <HI>droging;</HI> that is, trans∣porting goods from place to place. One of them died with the fever, but on shore, and he had not been on board of the sloop, after his illness. On the passage home, the seamen were all in good health. Then, is therefore not the least ground to suppose the sloop contained any infection, and no part of her cargo was supposed to be in a bad state. The external parts of a vessel or house cannot retain or communicate infection.</P>
<P>Secondly. As to the chest of clothes, it is probable it con∣tained no infection from diseased persons; for by the affidavit of
<PB N="404" REF="036687_0308_100A89C2964A0248"/>
Capt. Truman, taken before Alderman Furman of New-York, at the request of Dr. Baily, the Health Officer of that port, which affidavit I have consulted, it appears that the clothing, worn by the seaman who owned the chest and died at Martinico, was all wrapped in his blanket with his body and buried. As Capt. Truman is a man of good character and has made his affi∣davit, four years since the disease at New-Haven, when all ap∣prehensions of injury from declaring the truth, have subsided, there seems to be no reason to question the fact.</P>
<P>But as men, who have not attended to the great operations of nature in producing epidemic diseases, naturally look for the causes among visible and tangible substances, they still found a resource in a British regimental coat, which was in the chest, and which, it was <HI>supposed,</HI> might have belonged to a soldier who <HI>might have died</HI> of the yellow fever. In consequence of these suspicions, the contents of the chest were all burnt.</P>
<P>On examination it appears that the coat was new—and the mate of the sloop has sworn that he saw the coat plundered by the seaman from a bale of goods, and he believes it had never been worn. It was taken by the seaman in the business of drog∣ing, from among the packages of clothing sent by the British government for the use of the troops. But had we no such evi∣dence, common sense might inform us, that a man, <HI>laboring un∣der a fever in the sultry climate of the West-Indies,</HI> would not wear his regimental.</P>
<P>In the chest the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, as in the sloop, we can find no infec∣tion of yellow fever. If Mr. Austin and his clerk received the seeds of disease from the clothing in the chest, as it is possible they did, the sources of the disease must have been the fetid effluvia or dirty clothes, which had been kept a long time, close packed in a chest, in a sultry climate. It is not necessary to sup∣pose the clothes to have been worn by a diseased person. The sweat and filth from a body in health, if confined in the hot sea∣son, will ferment and produce a poison injurious to health, and productive of yellow fever or other disease.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is a well authenticated fact, that Mr. Daniel Phenix, treasurer of the city of New-York, and his sons were infected with a violent yellow fever, by means of the fetid effluvia from packages of bills of credit, which had been returned into the treasury, after being long used, passing through dirty, sweaty hands, and then being close pack∣ed for some weeks, in a hot season. The fact is related to me by Mr. Phenix himself. The at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ack in the first case, was severe; and on a subsequent occasion, a second attack passed off with a nausea.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="036687_0309_100AA32C6ABBB280"/>But as some reports have been circulated, in contradiction of the testimony of Capt. Truman, and as there is a possibility that he might have mistaken the facts, I lay out of this question all the evidence respecting the sloop. For whether the trunk con∣tained infected clothes or not, is wholly material; and with∣out any reference to that point, the evidence that the fever in New-Haven did not spring from any imported source, is complete.</P>
<P>Mr. Austin went on business to New-York, was seized with fever and died. His body was conveyed in a sloop to New-Haven, and buried. It is an agreed point, that no friend, nurse or other person took the fever from him.</P>
<P>Mr. Hubbard went on business to Derby, ten miles distant, was taken ill and died. His body was carried to New-Haven, and buried. It is agreed that no person took the disease from him.</P>
<P>It is not known that Polly Gorham was ever near the trunk of clothing—the report of her being present rests on the story of a child. But if she was, it makes no difference, for no per∣son who attended her was affected, except her mother, who had a slight fever. She lived and was ill, a mile from the wharf, and no person in that neighborhood was afterwards affected. In short, it is not pretended that the infection proceeded from either of these persons—the <HI>only persons</HI> who could possibly have taken the disease from the trunk of clothing.</P>
<P>It is admitted on all hands that the infection must have pro∣ceeded from the house of Isaac Gorham. Now it happens that Mrs. Gorham who was <HI>first seized and five days before Mr. Aus∣tin and his clerk,</HI> had never been near the trunk of clothing, nor was an article of clothing from the sloop carried into the house. For this assertion, I have the authority of Mr. Gorham himself, who is admitted to be a man of veracity.</P>
<P>Had the origin and phenomena of epidemic diseases ever been understood, the people of New-Haven would have foreseen, with
<PB N="306" REF="036687_0310_100AA2F25ED07938"/>
a good degree of certainty, that they could not escape pestilence. This will appear from the following facts.</P>
<P>In the winter and spring of 1794, the scarlatina anginosa pre∣vailed generally in New-Haven and the neighboring towns; manifesting a highly pestilential condition of the elements. One case of bilious fever, attended with a vomiting of black matter, occurred as early as the last week in March.</P>
<P>For many months preceding the invasion of the fever, the oys∣ters, on the coast of Connecticut, were in a very sickly state. Many people can testify to the truth of this fact; but I have an account of it recorded at the time by the late President Stiles. In a letter to his son-in-law, the Rev. Mr. Holmes, of Cam∣bridge in Massachusetts, dated Sept. 25, 1794, be writes, that for twelve months past he had eaten very few oysters, as they were diseased, poor and dropsical. He remarked this of the oysters from New-York to Boston. Those caught on the shores of Branford, Killingworth, and at Blue-Point on the south side of Long-Island, were intolerable. At the date of the letter they were recovering and becoming more palatable. This is a striking proof of the derangement of the elements.</P>
<P>Further evidence of this fact was furnished by the multitudes of caterpillars which overran the city of New-Haven, in the sum∣mer of 1794.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some persons say, this was in 1773, but it is not material.</NOTE> In such numbers were these insects, that they almost covered the trees, fences, and houses to the tops of chimneys. The preceding history furnishes many instances of this phenome∣non, preceding and accompanying pestilence.</P>
<P>Had these phenomena been understood, the people of New-Haven would have had no occasion to appoint a committee to ex∣amin into the causes of the fever. It was hardly possible, in the nature of things, that the human race should escape the calamity of epidemic diseases, under the operation of cause so general and powerful.</P>
<P>But these were not all. Mr. Gorham, whose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ily first suf∣fered by the fever, had, in the month preceding the invasion, cleaned a great number of shad, upon the wharf by his door,

and thrown the garbage, to the amount of a car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> load perhaps, in∣to the dock.</P>
<P>The alternate washing of the tide, and action of a hot sun, had rendered the putrefaction of this mass of filth extremely ra∣pid; and there being no current to remove it, the stench be∣came intolerable. On the other side of the wharf, a few rods distant, a boat load of clams had been deposited an the mud, that the water, during the slux of the tide, might preserve them; but a great part of them were soon spoiled, and added to the fetor of the atmosphere.</P>
<P>To complete the list of nuisances, some barrels of damaged pickled cod-fish had been thrown from a store into the dock, and the whole was left vncovered during the recess of the tide. So noisome was the air of the place, for sometime before the fever appeared, that the proprietor of the wharf desisted from his usual morning visits before breakfast. For all these facts I have the declarations of the persons concerned and eye witnesses.</P>
<P>The putrefaction of flesh, from thirty years observations, I can testify, will not always produce disease. But in a pestilential state of air, the dissolution of flesh is unusually rapid, and the acid evolved, peculiarly noxious. In such circumstances, putres∣cent substances of all kinds appear to be powerful auxiliary cau∣ses of disease. The condition of the elements accelerates putre∣faction, and that putrefaction in turn increases the deleterious quality of the air.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I may add to these causes of the fever, the water of the well used by the people living on the wharf, which happened at that time to be covered over with dead rats in a state of putrefaction. This was dis∣coverd by the offensiveness of the water.</NOTE></P>
<P>Under the operation of so many causes of disease, instead of being surprised at the appearance of a pestilential fever, we are rather to wonder that its ravages were not more extensive.</P>
<P>That the putrefaction of the fish was an exciting cause of the fever in New-Haven, is probable from the early appearance of it in summer. The first cases occurred about the 10th of June, which is earlier than the epidemic pestilence of America usually occurs; and which indicates the existence of strong local causes. What further confirms this opinion, is, that after a few weeks
<PB N="308" REF="036687_0312_100AA2F68B5A5F40"/>
the distemper was nearly or wholly extinct. In July died only three persons, and for about two weeks, no new case occurred. But in August, the usual time of the appearance of this disease in this part of America, it broke out with fresh violence. It is probable therefore that the <HI>morbid local</HI> causes induced the fever in one small spot, before the proper season for it to prevail. These causes being gradually extinguished by the tides and a hot sun, the disease subsided, until the usual season for such fevers. The same took place in New-York in 1795—in 1796—and 1798.</P>
<P>That the plague in New-Haven was the effect of a condition of the elements united with local causes, is proved by subsequent events. In the following year, a malignant dysentery originated and prevailed in New-Haven, destroying more lives than the bil∣ious plague of 1794. This disease is acknowledged by able phy∣sicians to be of the same species as the yellow fever. See Lind on that point, and Rush's Works vol. 5. 5, where it is stated, on the authority of Dr. Woodhouse, that several persons took the yellow fever from soldiers, laboring under the dysentery. It is well known also that an epidemic yellow fever has been converted, by a sudden change of weather, into an epidemic dysentery, and <HI>vice versa;</HI> as at Baltimore in 1797. It is also true that the yel∣low fever in autumn passes off in dysentery, as in New-London in 1798. The same is at times true of the plague in Asia.</P>
<P>This disease in 1795, as well as a similar dysentery in Derby in 1794, demonstrated the deleterious condition of the elements in that region or vicinity.</P>
<P>If further evidence was necessary, we have it in the bad state of the water in some of the wells in New-Haven, during the preva∣lence of these diseases, in which, one of the physicians of the city has informed me, were animalcules visible to the naked eye. This fact corresponds with what occured in Athens, during the plague, where the badness of the water, it is supposed, led the people to ascribe the disease to the poisoning of the wells by the Lacede∣monians. A similar fact probably led the Germans, in 1349, to suspect the Jews had poisoned the wells, and on suspicion alone to massacre them without mercy. This state of the water, and the sickness of the oysters alone decide the point, that the princi∣pal sources of the epidemics of 1794 and 5, were in the elements.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="036687_0313_100AA331EDD00ED0"/>It has been asserted that no person in New-Haven was affected by the fever, without intercourse with the sick or with infected clothing. On careful enquiry, I find this is not true. Several persons were affected who were not in the rooms, nor even in the houses of the sick, and who could not be exposed, other∣ways than by passing along the streets. But such persons could not take the fever from the effluvia of the diseased. Men who suppose this, are unacquainted with the powers of infection. Dr. Chisholm states expressly that the infection of that disease in Grenada never exceeded <HI>ten feet;</HI> that it was easy to avoid it, and many who lived in the houses of the diseased, escaped. Med. Repos. vol. 2. 288. Dr. Lind, the ablest writer on the subject, who spent his whole life in jails and hospitals, has ad∣vanced the same doctrin. A great number of sick in a narrow close built street, may render the air of it infectious, but a few diseased persons in the wide streets of New-Haven could not produce this effect. In general however the disease in this place was propagated by infection; the pollution of the atmos∣phere being confined to a small district on and near the wharf, on low ground, to the leeward of the putrid substances before mentioned, and near the creek.</P>
<P>But there is one fact that will decide the question relative to the origin of the pestilential fever in New-Haven, and every other place. It is stated by the physicians that all other diseases yielded to this fever. After it appeared in June, the scarlatina subsided, and "in September, when the fever was most preva∣lent, the inhabitants in general were almost entirely free from every other complaint."</P>
<BIBL>See Dr. Monson's account of the fever, in my Collection, p. 178.</BIBL>
<P>Here we have an infallible criterion by which to determin whether a disease is an epidemic of the place, or introduced and propagated solely by infection. A disease of mere infection can never extinguish other diseases of the place. The small-pox introduced by <HI>variolous matter,</HI> and communicated to every fam∣ily would not absorb a dysentery or scarlet fever prevailing in the same place; every hospital will demonstrate this principle. A disease of mere infection would not affect another disease even
<PB N="310" REF="036687_0314_100AA2F8145D6CB8"/>
in the next house. Every disease that extinguishes another dis∣ease current in a town, is an epidemic originating in that place. It not only proves that the atmosphere will produce that distem∣per, but it proves that it will produce no other. On this princi∣ple I will rest the question, as it regards not only the fever in New-Haven, but every pestilence that ever existed.</P>
<P>The summer of 1794 was, in most places, less sickly than in 1793 and 1795; yet the scarlatina extended its ravages over Connecticut, and Philadelphia and New-York experienced the predominant epidemic constitution. In Philadelphia died from 70 to 100 persons of the bilious plague; in New-York twenty or thirty cases of the same disease indicated the same condition of the atmosphere. It was the general opinion in New-York, that the city was remarkably healthy; but this opinion, so flat∣tering to the people, was a fallacy. The bills of mortality were higher than in healthy years, and this augmented mortality was a prelude to the epidemic of the succeeding year.</P>
<P>On the 15th of June was a great eruption of Vesuvius, nearly equal to that of 1779. The lava ran down the mountain on the west and extended to the sea, overwhelming the town of Tome del Greco.</P>
<BIBL>See Universal Mag. for Aug. 1795.</BIBL>
<P>In this year the bilious pestilence prevailed in Baltimore. No suggestion has been made that it was imported, and the physi∣cians and inhabitants seem to admit the disease to have been on∣ly a more malignant form of the ordinary autumnal remittent.</P>
<P>In the succeeding winter, the epidemic of the summer and autumn changed, in Philadelphia, into the form of catarrh or pleurisy, and in many cases, was attended with delirium and mania. See Rush on this subject.</P>
<P>Pestilential epidemics, or rather the state of the atmosphere which produces them, usually affects the brain, in a most sensi∣ble degree. This is obvious from the vertigo, so frequent during sickly periods; pains in the head, dizziness and nervous debility often complained of by studious men. In some periods, this affection of the brain has appeared in epidemic madness. See the years 1355; 1373 and 4.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="036687_0315_100AA333774EB100"/>A few cases of a disorder of this species appeared in New-Haven and its vicinity in the winter after the pestilence. The patient was seized with a violent pain in the head, between the Os frontis and the Coronal Sutures, which was periodical, com∣mencing about 11 o'clock A. M. and increasing till 2 P. M. In some cases, the paroxism was accompanied with delirium; but the pain was limited to the head, and unattended with fever. Bleeding, purging and opium produced no alleviation; but a blister on the forehead or temple, soon relieved the patient, and effected a cure. This account is taken from Dr. Hotchkiss, the attending physician.</P>
<P>The winter of 1794-5 was very cold in Europe, and in January 1795, the French troops marched into Amsterdam, over the rivers and canals, on the ice. This severity was to be expected from the great eruption of Vesuvius in the preceding summer.</P>
<P>The catarrh was epidemic in January and February, in the British channel fleet. In one ship it assumed the symptoms of a pure typhus.</P>
<BIBL>Trotter's Med. Naut. p. 366.</BIBL>
<P>In America, the same winter was milder than usual. Per∣sons walked on the battery at New-York, for pleasure, on Christmas day, with no covering but their ordinary autumnal clothes; and vessels sailed up the Hudson and Connecticut till January. In the latter part of the winter, we had some cold weather, and a cool late spring.</P>
<P>About the 20th of July, began a series of hot, damp, rainy weather, with light southerly winds; a season answering to the description which Hippocrates has given of a pestilential consti∣tution. Heavy rains were followed by a humid, close, sultry air; no thunder and lightning; no north-westerly winds to cool and refresh the fainting bodies of men. For many weeks the atmosphere was so loaded with vapor, that no electricity could be excited with the best instruments. Fruit perished on the trees and fell half rotten and covered with mold. Sound potatoes from the market perished in my cellar in thirty-six hours. Cab∣bages rotted off, between the head and the stalk, as they stood
<PB N="312" REF="036687_0316_100AA2F99CE0EDD8"/>
in gardens. The moisture penetrated into the inmost reces∣ses of desks and bureaus, covering books, papers and clothes with mold, under two locks. The walls of houses, and the paper of inner apartments became white with mold and required scraping. This state of the air produced also musketoes without number; while flies disappeared. It is observable that these two kinds of insects thrive in different conditions of the air— flies in a hot, dry air; musketoes, in a hot, moist air.</P>
<P>It is necessary here to correct a mistake of Dr. Currie on bil∣ious fevers, page 12, where he mentions the years 1795 and 7 as "wetter and cooler than many preceding seasons." The truth is, the latter part of the summer of 1795, was on an average three degrees by Farenheit, warmer than the weather had been in the ten preceding years. See a letter from Professor Kemp in Dr. Bailey on yellow fever, p. 54. In the course of my life, I never experienced a state of air so debilitating and un∣friendly to animal spirits, as the month of August 1795. The effects of it are very visible in the bill of mortality for that year in Philadelphia, which contains double the usual number of deaths.</P>
<P>In July of this year appeared the bilious plague in New-York. The first case that excited public attention was that of Dr. Treat, the Health Officer of the port, who fell a victim, on the 29th of the month. His disease has been ascribed by some persons, to infection taken on board a vessel from the West-Indies, the brig Zepher in which a person died, whom Dr. Treat assisted in burying. But it is not probable, that this was a just opinion; as many other persons visited the same vessel, and the wardens of the port were on board, while a part of her cargo, some damaged coffee, was thrown into the stream, without the least inconvenience to their health. The plethoric habit of Dr. Treat, and his great fatigue in an open boat and in a burning sun, are sufficient to account for his disease.</P>
<P>But admitting him to have taken his disease from the fomes of a sick or dead person, or from the foulness of the brig, the fact does not in the least aid the advocates of infection, for no per∣son, nurse, attendant or visitor, received the distemper from him,
<PB N="313" REF="036687_0317_100AA3360E1F72B0"/>
nor did the disease prevail, in the street where he died, during the subsequent season.</P>
<P>It was said that three or four seamen, belonging to the ship William, were seized with the distemper in consequence of visit∣ing the brig Zepher. But on enquiry, it was found, that these men only came along side of the brig and purchased some fruit. To suppose these men should all take a disease from the brig, when two or three wardens of the port, who were some hours on board, while a damaged cargo was discharged, escaped without the least affection, is ridiculous.</P>
<P>But what cuts short all controversy on this subject, is, that fourteen days at least before the death of Dr. Treat, a man in the hospital died of a similar fever; and the late Dr. Pitt Smith, in∣formed me in the autumn of 1795, that he visited another patient a blacksmith, with a similar disease, early in July. In fact then, the disease was in New-York before the arrival of the supposed infected vessels; and the cases which occurred early in July, were <HI>precursors</HI> of the epidemic which was to follow.</P>
<P>It must also be observed that the disease in New-York never spread over the whole city. It ran along the low streets on the East river, in what was formerly the swamp and in the narrow alleys. The high grounds in the center of the city, and the wes∣tern side of the island, were healthy as usual; and the disease, when carried from the infected streets, upon the elevated parts of the city, exhibited no contagion, but disappeared.—A small part only of the citizens fled; most of them remained, and pur∣sued their occupations, in the greatest part of the city, with per∣fect safety. The deaths were about seven hundred and thirty; among which at least five hundred were foreigners, most of whom had recently arrived from Scotland and Ireland.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Four hundred and sixty two belonged to the Catholic Congrega∣tion under the Rev. Mr. O'Brien, most of whom had been so short a time in the country, that he did not know them.</NOTE> The mortal∣ity in New-York was mostly owing to this influx of foreigners, not seasoned to our climate.</P>
<P>This fever in New-York was preceded in spring by epidemic measles, which disappeared totally during the three months, when
<PB N="314" REF="036687_0318_100AA2FC1B6B1AA0"/>
the fever was the ruling disease, and re-appeared in November— a decisive evidence that the fever was produced and controlled by the same cause, as the measles.</P>
<P>In this year also appeared the same disease at a landing, called Mill-river four miles from Fairfield, in Connecticut, and about sixty miles from New-York—a small village, near the water. It was reported that this distemper was propagated at Mill-river, by infected persons from New-York. I have taken pains to en∣quire carefully of both the attending physicians and the clergy∣men, who visited the sick, who all agree, that one man from New-York had died of the fever in the village, that summer, and he was dead, <HI>three weeks</HI> before, Mr. Tharp, the first man seiz∣ed, was taken ill.</P>
<P>The disease affected others of his family, but spread no fur∣ther; and the gentlemen above-mentioned do not believe it to have been derived from imported infection.</P>
<P>The bilious remittent fever, is annually the disease of autumn in some parts of the southern states; and strangers, visiting that country from the Delaware to Florida, in the hot season run the hazard of a fever. Drs. Taylor and Hansford, two old practitioners in Norfolk, Virginia, speaking of the yellow fever of 1795, say, "The same fever, with all its malignant and uncontrollable symptoms, occurs every year, in scattered in∣stances, and about the same season."</P>
<BIBL>See my Collection on Bilious Fevers, p. 151.</BIBL>
<P>But during pestilential periods, this disease in that unhealthy country, takes a wider spread, and becomes infectious.</P>
<P>In 1795 this was the case at Norfolk—a town that is situated on low flat land, a few feet only above high-water, and subject to autumnal fevers. The disease prevailed most in the narrow streets and poor small houses, and was most fatal to strangers.</P>
<P>Two remarkable facts occurred there and are related in the account last cited, to prove that the disease was occasioned solely by a general state of the atmosphere in and about the town, without a dependence on infection. The first is, that traders who visited the port, altho they were not known to have had in∣tercourse with the sick, took the disease and died on their re∣turn into the country. But a more remarkable fact is, that the
<PB N="315" REF="036687_0319_100AA3385E2B5F98"/>
seamen of a ship from Liverpool, which did not approach near∣er than five miles distance from the town, and which had no communication with the shore, except by means of the health-boat, were almost all attacked with the disease, in ten days after their arrival. This was late in the season, and when the disease had nearly disappeared in town.</P>
<P>In the year 1794 several cases of the same disease had occur∣red in Norfolk. In 1797 the disease was again frequent. In 1795 and 7, the disease was supposed to have been augmented by the great rains and floods which had preceded, and which had brought down the river and spread on the shores, large quan∣tities of vegetable substances.</P>
<P>The extreme unhealthiness of the summer of 1795, was man∣ifested by unusual mortality in various other parts of the country. On the level plains of Duchess county in New-York state, pre∣vailed a mortal dysentery and typhus fever. At Coxsakie on the west of the Hudson, raged similar diseases with fatal effects. In some western parts of the state, near the marshes which border the waters of the country, a malignant bilious fever was more terribly fatal, than the fever in New-York.</P>
<P>In Sheffield, a western township of Massachusetts, near two large ponds which form marshy grounds, bilious fevers, which had not been known there for many years, before, prevailed and in some cases were mortal.</P>
<BIBL>See Dr. Buel's account of these diseases, in my Collection, p. 53.</BIBL>
<P>In that town, the progressiveness of the morbid principle of this pestilential period, was clearly discoverable. Many cases of intermittents occurred in 1793; and a few instances of bil∣ious remittents. This was during the plague in Philadelphia. In 1794, early in spring, inflammatory diseases of the pneumo∣nic kind, were unusually frequent. These were succeeded by intermittents, which were more frequent than in the preceding year. In July, the bilious remittent appeared, and 80 inhabi∣tants out of 150, who lived within a mile and a half of the south pond, were affected. In 1795, of 200 inhabitants within three fourths of a mile distant from the north pond, 150 were affected with the same disease—but few died.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="036687_0320_100AA2FE5477A3A8"/>In 1796, the dysentery, which had not appeared in many preceding years, began its attacks on children, and not long af∣ter adults were taken either with the same disease or with the bil∣ious remittent. Of one hundred families living within a mile and a half of one of the ponds, not ten escaped sickness—more than half of the inhabitants were, in the course of the season, attacked with one or other of the abo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> mentioned diseases. Of 150 persons who lived nearest to the pond, not ten escaped. The deaths by these diseases were forty-four. Here then was a regular increase of malignancy in the autumnal diseases, from in∣termittents, to the worst form of dysentery and bilious remittent.</P>
<BIBL>Med. Repos. vol. 1. 456.</BIBL>
<P>In the preceding period, great mortality prevailed among the geese in some parts of our country; and in the year 1796, a similar mortality among other fowls. I have not been able to ob∣tain a particular description of the symptoms, but it was observed the transition from apparent health to death, was very rapid.</P>
<P>In 1796 the measles which commenced in New-York in 1795 was epidemic in Connecticut; and unusually prevalent in London.</P>
<P>In 1796 also the bilious plague again appeared in New-York, but in a different quarter of the city from that which was princi∣pally affected, the year preceding. In 1795, it began and was most general in the north-eastern part—in 1796, in the south-western part, near the battery; and in both summers, its seat was along the wharves on the East river, and in the adjoining streets and alleys. All this part of the city is a level, formed by extending the land and wharves into the East river. The land is of course loose and porous, admitting, in many places, the wa∣ter of the sea into the cellars of the houses; some of which are penetrated, on every flux of the tide. These artificial streets, Front and Water streets, are not easily washed clean, on account of their level position, and they receive the filth washed from the higher grounds of the city. To these streets, and similar ones in the swamp on the north-east, was the malignant distemper principally limited.</P>
<P>In 1796 a new wharf below Exchange slip, which had been timbered the preceding autumn, and left unfilled, had become a
<PB N="317" REF="036687_0321_100AA33B837C49C8"/>
reservoir for all kinds of putrid, filthy substances, and was sup∣posed to be a powerful cause of disease.</P>
<P>Besides, the quarter in which the disease raged this year, is al∣most wholly covered with old wooden houses, and many of them, built before the raising and paving of the street, have their lower floors two or three feet below the surface of the pavements. In this district appeared the yellow fever in June; but a series of rainy weather and cool westerly winds, suspended its action, in the beginning of July. Succeeding hot weather renewed it, and in the limits above described, extending about forty or fifty rods, about seventy persons fell victims. The other parts of the city remained in the usual autumnal state of health, with only a few scattering cases of the plague.</P>
<P>At Wilmington, North-Carolina, prevailed a similar disease. It was preceded by the dysentery, in July, after a very wet spring. When the bilious fever commenced in August, the dysentery declined, and those who had been affected with it es∣caped the fever. About one hundred and fifty deaths, by these two forms of disease, occurred in 130 families. Different opin∣ions were entertained about the origin of the fever; but the phy∣sician who gives this account has no doubts of its domestic origin. He informs us further that a few cases, in that town, occur annu∣ally, which assume all the symptoms of a violent yellow fever.</P>
<BIBL>Med. Repos. vol. 2. 153. Dr. Rosset's letter.</BIBL>
<P>In this year, the disease occasioned a considerable mortality in Charleston, South-Carolina, and in Newburyport, in Massachu∣setts. It appeared in Boston also, but was not general nor severe.</P>
<P>In Charleston, it succeeded one of the most destructive fires, ever known in that city; and was in part ascribed to the stagnant water which accumulated in the open cellars.</P>
<P>In Newburyport, there was no plausible pretext for ascribing the disease to imported infection; and the general belief was, that the immediate exciting cause, was, the remains of large quanti∣ties of fish which had been left to corrupt on the wharf, near which the distemper originated, and which occasioned an intolerable stench. But in that town, a previous increase of mortality indi∣cated a sickly state of the elements; as in all other places, where
<PB N="318" REF="036687_0322_100AA30199DBBC58"/>
the pestilence has made its appearance. In none of the northern states, which are usually healthy, has the bilious plague occurred without other diseases for precursors.—The disease in Newbury∣port was confined to a low street or two, and when carried upon the high grounds, it exhibited little or no infection, but disap∣peared with the death or recovery of the patient.</P>
<BIBL>M. S. Letter from Nicholas Pike, Esq.</BIBL>
<P>In Boston, the disease spread only in a small part of the town, adjoining the water. The physicians were unanimously of opin∣ion, that it was not occasioned by any fomites from infected arti∣cles imported, but generated in the town.</P>
<BIBL>See Dr. Warren's Letter in the Medical Repository, vol. 1. p. 136.</BIBL>
<P>The pestilential state of the elements was strongly marked, this year, by the poorness of the shad brought to market in New-York. These were all thin, lean and small; and for this reason, I pur∣chased none for my own use, during the season. Other persons observed the fact; and I am since informed that such of those fish as were pickled, perished in defiance of all human care to pre∣serve them. The same state of the shad was observed in Con∣necticut.</P>
<P>Some cases of yellow fever occurred in Philadelphia in 1796; catarrh was frequent in the winter, followed by measles of a most inflammatory nature. A remarkable halo appeared on the 25th of July.</P>
<BIBL>Rush, vol. 5. 9.</BIBL>
<P>It has been already observed that the winter of 1795, was remarkably severe in Europe. In America the same winter was as mild as usual. But in the summer and autumn of 1796, the northern states experienced a most severe drouth.</P>
<P>The following winter was very severe; the cold exceeding what is usual, and being of long duration. The summer of 1797 was cool and wet. The winter of 1797-8 was severe— and the cold of very long duration. It commenced early in No∣vember and continued till March. The Hudson and Connecti∣cut were closed in November; a very rare occurrence. For several weeks in November and December, the wind, without much snow on the earth along the Atlantic coast, was from the north-west and intensely dry and cold.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="036687_0323_100AA33DE08ECEF0"/>In August 1797 appeared a comet, which, according to cal∣culations of astronomers, passed near the earth, altho it was of small apparent magnitude, and seen by few people.</P>
<P>The influence of this species of bodies in occasioning great tides, and violent storms, has been already mentioned, and of that influence, in the present instance, I was a witness. In 1797 my residence was, as it had been the preceding year, on a height of York Island near Corlaer's Hook to the northward of which is a flat, which is never covered with water by a common tide, but is overspread by spring tides, or any unusual swell in consequence of easterly winds. I observed, as early as the last week in May, high tides were unusually frequent and the swell extraordinary. In the city of New-York, the same fact was observable; and the inhabitants about Beekman slip will recol∣lect how often the wharves and street were covered with water. These tides were not to be accounted for, on any known prin∣ciples of lunar influence, and I frequently mentioned the phe∣nomenon to my friends, but without suspecting the cause. The same phenomenon was noticed at other places. In Norfolk, the epidemic fever was, in part, ascribed to unusual tides; as I was afterwards informed. On the Delaware, the overflowing of the low lands, below Philadelphia, was extraordinary, and some physicians ascribe to this cause the yellow fever, which swept away most of a family by the name of Whitall.</P>
<P>I was lately mentioning these events to a respectable gentleman in Stamford,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Hon. John Davenport, now representative in Congress.</NOTE> who instantly recollected a fact which confirms the foregoing account. He remarked that the common practice in that town, is to mow the salt meadows, at the quadratures of the moon, on account of small tides; but in 1797, the calcula∣tions failed, and the people were much troubled to collect their hay, on account of high tides—a circumstance that was very surprising to him at the time, but he did not advert to the prob∣able cause. This was in August; about the time that the comet was first observed. The fact then of the influence of comets, in raising the waters of the ocean, is well established; and the
<PB N="320" REF="036687_0324_100AA30402DAB680"/>
appearance of a comet in autumn explained the phenomena of the tides to my satisfaction.</P>
<P>The influence of comets in augmenting tempests is equally certain and remarkable.</P>
<P>On the 19th of August, a storm and whirlwind in South Prussia tore up forests carried trees along like sheaves of wheat, and levelled several villages.</P>
<P>In Rome and Naples happened a most extraordinary tempest on the 25th of September, such as the oldest man could not re∣collect. It took up men and carried them some distance. The astronomers were consulted and they ascribed it to the approxi∣mation of the comet.</P>
<P>A storm of hail in the province of Macconnois, in France, and on the borders of Burgundy, destroyed the vines and fruits of the earth in thirty-four villages. In the appropriations made afterwards by the councils of France, four millions were granted to repair the losses by hail, inundations and other disasters.</P>
<P>On the 7th of September, a considerable shock of earthquake was felt in the Western Pyrenees. On the 28th of the month was a volcanic eruption in Guadaloupe; and many earthquakes occurred during the autumn.</P>
<P>In England, the summer was so rainy and wet, as to injure the corn and threaten the inhabitants with scarcity. It would require pages to relate all the accidents by floods in Great-Brit∣ain from August to the close of the year.</P>
<P>During the autumnal months, the Black sea also was unusu∣ally tempestuous, and the loss of shipping alarmed Constantino∣ple, with apprehensions of a scarcity of provisions.</P>
<P>In February, 1797, South-America was terribly convulsed. Quito and the neighboring provinces suffered, by the destruction of almost every house. Mountains were detached from their stations and rolled against each other, burying villages in ruin. Volcanoes emitted fire, lava, and rivers of water. It is said, that 40,000 inhabitants perished.</P>
<P>On the 11th of January 1798 a shock of earthquake was felt in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and the neighboring towns, during which appeared to issue from the earth a flame or blaze, like the burning of a chimney.</P>

<P>In February 1797 also violent earthquakes were experienced on the western coast of Sumatra, in the East-Indies.</P>
<P>This year, 1797, was remarkable for other singular phenom∣ena in Europe and America.</P>
<P>In England a pestilence among cats swept away those animals by thousands. It seems that this disease began as early as April, and succeeded an epidemic catarrh among the human race. The same cat-distemper was afterwards epidemic in France. A so∣ciety at Montpelier instituted an enquiry into this remarkable phenomenon.</P>
<P>The cat-distemper appeared in Philadelphia, as early as June, and proceeded northward and eastward, like the catarrh of 1789. In August it was very fatal in New-York, and in the course of the summer and autumn, it spread destruction among those ani∣mals over the northern states.</P>
<P>In August, dead fish, in great numbers, were seen to float down James' river, in Virginia, for many days in succession.</P>
<P>Canine madness, during the same year, was unusually epidemic and attended with fatal effects, of which full accounts may be seen in the first volume of the Medical Repository.</P>
<P>These phenomena indicate an unhealthy state of the elements. But it is a remarkable fact that, in some places and seasons, the principal force of the epidemic constitution seems to be spent on <HI>one</HI> species of animals, while others are exempt. Thus in Eng∣land, the catarrh, which had affected mankind in 1797, ceased, before the epidemic seized the cats. In America, the northern states, with the exception of a few places, were remarkably healthy, in 1797, while cats died in multitudes. And it is a frequent occurrence in Europe, that while the plague or some other malignant disease is afflicting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> human race in one coun∣try; in another country, mankind w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> escape, and a most terri∣ble mortality will occur among cattle, horses or sheep.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="036687_0326_100AA305903381B8"/>In 1797 the bills of mortality in the northern states, which had been swelled very high by angina and malignant fevers, fell nearly to the standard of health. There are a few exceptions.</P>
<P>The plague appeared in Philadelphia, Baltimore, Norfolk and Charleston. In the two latter cities, it is considered, as the usual autumnal fever, with aggravated symptoms, from sea∣son or other local or temporary causes.</P>
<P>In Baltimore, the disease appeared first in the form of a com∣mon remittent, but increased in malignancy till late in aut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mn and became infectious. The history of this epidemic is minutely stated by the magistracy of Baltimore, and is too interesting to be passed with a slight notice. The following is a correct ab∣stract of the statement made and published by authority.</P>
<P>The commissioners state to the mayor of the city;</P>
<P>That the first appearance of the fever was near the end of June in two young men, Parkin and M'Kenna, who occupied a ware∣house in South-street and who died in a few days. The ware∣house was examined, and was found to contain nothing which could be the special cause of the fever; nor is it suggested that they were infected from abroad. No person received the disease from them. From this time till the close of August, West Baltimore remained in a state of unusual health.</P>
<P>In East Baltimore (Fell's Point) a bilious fever had showed itself early in the season, and gradually spread and grew worse; but was supposed to be no other than the common sickness of the season. It therefore excited no alarm, till the 26th August, when a rumor prevailed, that the fever was something <HI>more than common.</HI> The chairman of the board addressed a letter to each of the physicians in that part of the city, requesting to be informed whether any case of contagious disease had come under his observation.</P>
<P>Dr. John Coulter wrote for answer that since the third week in June, a fever had prevailed and become epidemic, affecting all descriptions of people, but mostly those who labored hard, in the heat of the sun, intemperate persons and those who expo∣sed themselves to night air after the labors of the day. The disease was violent, and unless speedily assailed with powerful
<PB N="323" REF="036687_0327_100AA340889288C8"/>
remedies, proved fatal. It had on that day, August 26th, be∣come general, and "assumed to itself the sole government of the diseases," in that part of the city. "During the wet weather, in the last of July and beginning of August, it yielded, for near two weeks, to the dysentery," which aftewards gave way to a recurrence of the yellow fever. [The reader is desired to note that fact.]</P>
<P>Dr. Coulter calls the fever an epidemic, in contradistinction to imported contagion, and says, "it is in the locality of our atmosphere, the source of which I can perceive in every ten steps I take in our streets, ponds of stagnant water, and sinks of putrid animal and vegetable matters, exhaling perpetually under a hot sun the most offensive effluvia." The conclusion he draws is, that the disease was <HI>not individually infectious.</HI> He then men∣tions the uniformity of the symptoms, and the correspondence of the fever with the diseases which have prevailed in that city and in other parts of the continent for a number of years past. He enumerates the symptoms, which are exactly the same, as observed in New-Haven, New-York and Philadelphia.</P>
<P>Doctors Alexander and Jaquitt agree in the facts that the disease was not imported nor specifically contagious.</P>
<P>The board of health then called a meeting of the physicians in West Baltimore, and inquired whether any contagious sick∣ness had come under their knowledge. They answered in the negative. Three of their number, at the request of the meeting, went to East Baltimore and visited a number of the sick. They reported on the 29th of August, that the disease was not a ma∣lignant, contagious or yellow fever, but the bilious remittent. Their report quieted the alarms of people.</P>
<P>On the 2d of September the commissioners were alarmed with the opinion of the physicians in that part of the city, that the <HI>disease was something more than common.</HI></P>
<P>Five members of the board, with Dr. Moores, went to the point to examin for themselves. They found the disease had spread, chiefly among the poor, who lived in confined dwellings —a few persons were dangerously ill; but on the whole, were convinced that the disease was <HI>not contagious.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="036687_0328_100AA308BA425A38"/>The next week, the disorder assumed a more threatening aspect. The launching of the frigate on the 7th of September, col∣lected many people together, who were exposed to a hot sun and fatigue, which spread the disease to West Baltimore. The next day the board of health received regular information that there was <HI>contagion in the disease.</HI> A meeting of the faculty was cal∣led, and suitable directions given to check and alleviate the ca∣lamity.</P>
<P>The whole number of interments in the city and precincts from August 1 to October 29th—Adults 408; children 137. Total 545. Number of inhabitants at Fell's Point (where the disease principally raged) who removed during the sickness 671. Those who remained were 2679. Total 3350.</P>
<P>This plain and candid narrative of facts, which is certified by the presidents of both branches of the city council and by the mayor, Mr. Calhoun, does great honor to the integrity and dil∣igence of the commissioners; and <HI>if the laws of nature are to be relied on as uniform in their operation, this report alone will de∣cide every disputed point relative to the origin and phenomena of the yellow fever.</HI></P>
<P>It is here decided by unequivocal evidence; evidence that precludes the carping of prejudice and the casuistry of interest, that the yellow fever and the bilious remittent are the <HI>same dis∣ease,</HI> differing only in degrees of violence; and it is agreed on all hands that the remitting and intermitting fevers are the same disease, with a similar difference in violence.</P>
<P>The disease began at Baltimore early in the season, in June, and for more than two months, prevailed as a remitting fever of the common kind, without infection, and it is agreed on all hands not to be of imported origin. During a wet season, the damp weather cast the disease upon the intestines, and it appear∣ed in the form of a dysentery—a most important fact, which proves what Dr. Lind has asserted, that a dysentery is a yellow or malignant fever seated in the bowels. The wet weather ceas∣ing, the fever resumed its former appearance, and gradually in∣creased, till it exhibited its <HI>worst forms and became infectious.</HI></P>
<P>Had the advocates for the domestic origin of this fever <HI>con∣trived</HI> and directed a series of facts, to prove their own doctrines,
<PB N="325" REF="036687_0329_100AA342B5A36E18"/>
it would not have been possible to collect stronger evidence in their favor, than the report of the board of health in Baltimore.</P>
<P>In Philadelphia, the disease in 1797 appeared, in a few cases, as early as June—one on the 5th—one on the 9th—one on the 15th and another on the 22d. These cases, instead of being considered as proofs of a pestilential air, and precursors of more general sickness, are thrown entirely out of the question, by the advocates of imported fomites. The division of opinions, which originated in 1793, relative to the causes and origin of that dis∣ease, was revived with asperity. One party among physicians contended that the distemper was introduced into the city by the ship Arethusa, which arrived from Jamaica and Havanna, on the 23d of July. Another party believed the sources of the disease to have been, noxious exhalations from putrid substances in the city, with an augment from the foul air of the snow Nav∣igation from Marseilles. The evidence to support each of these opinions, is published in the proceedings of the College of Phy∣sicians, and of the Academy of Medicin.</P>
<P>The city of Philadelphia was deserted by a great proportion of its inhabitants, and thus the mortality was limited to about one thousand victims. It prevailed principally in the suburbs.</P>
<P>This epidemic was followed as usual by the influenza.</P>
<P>By foreign publications, it appears that the catarrh was epi∣demic in England in the four first months of 1797. I have no particulars of the violence or extent of this disorder; but if it was severe and general, no event is more certain than that sickly seasons will follow.</P>
<P>What confirms this opinion, is, that in the following summer, the plague raged in Constantinople, on the Barbary coast, and in Corsica. It appears by an official letter of the French min∣ister Sotin, that there was a difference of opinion in regard to the epidemic in Corsica—some calling it the plague; others, a malignant fever. Those who called it the plague, were prepar∣ed to account for it, by the tale of a Turkish vessel wrecked upon the island, with diseased people on board. But the disease subsided without very extensive ravages.</P>
<P>This malignant fever however occasioned no small alarm in England. The government sent orders to ships cruising in the
<PB N="326" REF="036687_0330_100AA30D514806C8"/>
Mediterranean to have no communication with vessels from Cor∣sica, and a proclamation was issued ordering strict quarantine to be performed by all vessels from Corsica, Minorca, Gibraltar and Spain within the Mediterranean.</P>
<P>In 1797 the bilious plague carried off forty-five of the in∣habitants of Providence. Of this disease, I have a minute and judicious account from Mr. Moses Brown, which is here a∣bridged.</P>
<P>In 1791, the year when the disease first appeared in the West-Indies and New-York, several persons died of a similar fever in Providence. Two women died in one family, near the centre of the town, after three days illness. They vomitted bilious matter, and were yellow, with livid and purple spots. The second, being seized two days after the death of the first, might have taken the disease by infection; but no suspicion ex∣isted that the first had access to any infecting cause.</P>
<P>On the 14th of August died another person in a different part of the town, and on the 21st of September, a fourth, with similar symptoms. As no alarm had then been excited by yel∣low fever, little notice was taken of these cases; but the attend∣ing physician, a respectable character, who visited many patients in 1797 and was affected with the disease himself, has since pro∣nounced the disease of 1791 and of 1797 to be the same.</P>
<P>A case very similar to these occurred in September 1792; and on the west side of the river, prevailed a singular epidemic, in which persons became yellow, with black urine, costive bow∣els, pains in the right hypochondrium, without fever. Some had petechial spots, and one person, petechia, vibices and hemhor∣age, yet the disease was not mortal, nor malignant.</P>
<P>In 1793 a person from Philadelphia was ill and died of the yellow fever in Providence, but no other was infected.</P>
<P>In 1794 several persons had the same disease, but they took it probably in Carolina, where they had been on a voyage; the disease did not spread by infection.</P>
<P>On the 11th of July 1795, died Capt. J. Gifford, a respect∣able man, of the same disease. No infection was supposed in the case—he was buried under arms, but no inconvenience was experienced from it, at the time. Yet two years after, viz. in
<PB N="327" REF="036687_0331_100AA345174D0AC8"/>
1797, his family were affected with the disorder, at the time when it became epidemic in the neighborhood.</P>
<P>Several other cases occurred, in the same year, and one of them exhibited infection.</P>
<P>These cases demonstrate a pestilential principle existing in that town, in every season from 1791 to 1795 inclusive; at the time when other parts of the United States were more severely afflicted. They were the distant precursors of a more general calamity in that town, which did not arrive till 1797.</P>
<P>Sporadic cases of pestilential fever do not render it <HI>certain</HI> but <HI>probable,</HI> that the disease will, in a future season, become epi∣demic. In 1796 cholera infantum and dysentery were prevalent.</P>
<P>In 1797 the hydrophobia was prevalent in the state of Rhode-Island, as well as in other states. One T. Lyon was bitten by a dog, the wound healed, and he was seized four months after, and died. The pestilence among cats prevailed also in Provi∣dence.</P>
<P>In this year also prevailed at Westport in the same state, and on Nantucket island, a very malignant epidemic dysentery. At Westport died 30 patients of 79 who were seized. On Nan∣tucket the disease was less mortal; about 100 died out of 2000 patients. On examination, it was found that under the house of the family first seized, there were some barrels of putrid fish, and other nauseous matter.</P>
<P>It was supposed also, that the disease might have been aug∣mented by the effluvia of a large pond, at some miles distance, which had become stagnant, filled with grass, and the shores strewed with dead fish. A number of men, on this discovery, opened a trench to drain off the water, and let in the tides, af∣ter which, it was supposed, the disease assumed a less malignant aspect.</P>
<P>The pestilential condition of the air at Providence in 1797, manifested itself very early in the season; the first death occur∣ring as early as May 5th—the next on the 25th of June—the third on the 4th of July—the fourth on the 27th—the fifth on the 29th, and the sixth on the first of August. The symptoms in all these cases, were the predominant ones of the true yellow
<PB N="328" REF="036687_0332_100AA30B0B018CF8"/>
fever; and the bodies exhibited more or less petechiae and bices. These cases occurred <HI>before</HI> the arrival of the schooner, to which popular clamor afterwards imputed the whole evil. These were the scattered precursors, which, had the subject of pestilence ever been investigated, with philosophical ingenuity and Christian candor, would have rendered the epidemic a prob∣able event to the citizens of Providence, as early as July and would have taught them to use all human means to avoid or miti∣gate the calamity.</P>
<P>On the 8th of August arrived the schooner Betsey, Capt. Barton, from the Mole of Cape Nicholas, after 24 days pas∣sage. Her cargo was only a few hogsheads of coffee. She lay at the wharf, till the 20th, when an increasing alarm from new cases of the fever induced the police to order her to be removed and cleansed.</P>
<P>On enquiry, it was found that three of the schooner's people had been ill in the West-Indies, but no one died. One of these only had been ill on the passage, but had recovered so as to do duty, seven days before her arrival. There were five per∣sons on board, during the passage, none of whom were affected by disease from infection or other cause.</P>
<P>The death of Mr. Arnold, the custom-house officer, who was said to have visited the schooner, and several of his family, gave rise to the report that the fever began from fomes on board of her. This point will be hereafter disproved. Certain it is, that another officer of the customs slept on board of the schoon∣er <HI>seven</HI> nights; another <HI>five,</HI> and another young man <HI>two</HI> nights, with Brown, the owner of the blankets hereafter to be mention∣ed; all of whom escaped disease of any kind.</P>
<P>It was also said that the woman who washed two blankets, belonging to a diseased seaman, took the fever and died. On investigation, this proved to be an idle tale. The blankets were owned by one Brown, who had not been sick; and not having any use for them in warm weather, they had lain in his chest. On his arrival, they were carried home, spread out on the fence to air; they were then carried to his sister's to be washed and lay two days before the work was undertaken. The day
<PB N="329" REF="036687_0333_100AA346C4BCA968"/>
after the washing, the women were taken ill; which was two early for the operation of infection, unless highly concentrated. But in fact the blankets were not infected; never having been used by any diseased person; and the mother and others who handled them, when first opened, never had the disease.</P>
<P>But stronger circumstances attended this case. The blanket belonging to Rophy, the only sick man, on the passage, and his other clothes, worn during his fever, and colored yellow, by his perspiration, were carried to his house; the blanket spread out for children to play on, before it was washed; afterwards washed by his wife; and no person took any disease from his clothes or blanket.</P>
<P>Such are tales of imported diseases, raised by ignorance and propagated by interest, pride or credulity, to which the business of the merchants and the commerce of the country are to be sacrificed!</P>
<P>Many other reports were spread about the infection from this schooner which, upon strict enquiry, were found to be equally groundless. Such as the introduction of the fever into Warren, where the vessel stopped, on her way to Providence. The case was, one Cole, an officer of the customs, sculled a large boat a mile or two, against the tide, in a foggy evening; went on board, wet and fatigued; without refreshment or change of clothes, slept in a cabin with broken windows, took a severe cold; repeated his visit to the schooner the next day; on the third day went to Providence, a distance of ten miles in the rain; tarried two nights without a change of clothes; returned on foot, and was taken ill of a bilious fever and died in about seven days. Yet after all this fatigue and imprudence in the man, enough in all conscience to kill him, men are found weak enough to charge his disease to the schooner.</P>
<P>But it happens, that other similar cases of fever occurred in Warren, in persons who had never visited Cole or the schooner; and one at the distance of three miles from the town. The whole tale therefore comes to nothing.</P>
<P>One fact more, and I will quit the subject of correcting the popular errors on this head. The men belonging to the schooner
<PB N="330" REF="036687_0334_100AA30F31DF41F8"/>
were dismissed at Providence and returned to their families, with their sea clothes of course. My informant took pains to enquire of every family, whether any of them had been infected; and he found not one instance, altho the families consisted of about forty souls!—The case of the unfortunate family of Mr. Arnold would a ford some slight ground to suspect the infection to be communicated from the schooner to him or his son, the latter having visited her;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is not rendered certain that the father had been on board; but that the son had, is not questioned; so had at least one hundred others, who were not afterward affected with the disease.</NOTE> but it happens that Mr. Arnold's wife, who had <HI>not</HI> been on board, nor otherwise exposed, was seized fifty-six hours <HI>before</HI> her son and more than three days <HI>before</HI> her hus∣band. Thus the reports of infection from abroad, when well sifted, vanish into smoke; and I am persuaded this would gene∣rally be the result, if men would be faithful to themselves, to truth and their country.</P>
<P>On the 12th of August, the fever took a more rapid spread, probably from a sudden alarm by the burning of two tons of hemp, by means of a spark from a blacksmith's shop, as it was passing the door. This was four days after the arrival of the schooner, and occasioned the popular clamor which was raised about her infection. But the appearance of the disease long <HI>before</HI> her arrival is decisive of the question.</P>
<P>This disease had its own atmosphere; raging mostly in a part of Providence much exposed to the effluvia of great collections of filth in vaults, from a distillery, and in other places. Some cases however occurred in other situations; and many parts of the state exhibited the pestilential principle, in sporadic cases, or local epidemics, as at Bristol, Warren, Greenwich, Indian Point, Gloucester, Warwick, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In Providence, the disease affected fifty-six families—8 before the arrival of the schooner, and 48 afterwards. In 33 of these families, only one person in each, had the fever; and as some of the families are large, the infecting principle could not have been very powerful. In the large house, where lived the women who were first taken ill, after the schooner arrived, resided 9
<PB N="331" REF="036687_0335_100AA349DB0505D0"/>
families, consisting of 37 persons, only 12 of which were af∣fected. In the hospital the nurses and attendants <HI>all</HI> escaped.</P>
<P>Some instances of this disease appeared in the following win∣ter; and there were cases also of the ulcerous sore throat. In the north part of the town, some cases of the yellow fever oc∣curred in the last summer—1798.</P>
<P>In 1797 a malignant fever is said to have been introduced in∣to a village in Chatham, on Connecticut river, by a vessel from the West-Indies. I understand that it was confined to a cluster of houses by the water; but I have not been able to collect the facts in detail, altho I have written letters for the purpose.</P>
<P>During the late pestilential period, the state of the atmosphere produced its usual effects in winter; which appeared in the ex∣traordinary symptoms of pleurisy and peripneumony.</P>
<P>It has already been remarked that in periods when plague and other mortal epidemics rage in summer, the diseases of winter assume new symptoms. The pleurisy, at such times, has often become epidemic and even infectious. It is in fact a modification of the same pestilential principle, as that which renders bilious fevers in summer epidemic and infectious. The fatal effects of this species of pleurisy in Connecticut, in the winter of 1761, have been mentioned.</P>
<P>In the winter of 1795-6, after the epidemic in New-York, several cases of a similar kind occurred, and an able physician of plethoric habit and strong fibres, fell a victim to a peripneumony, with anomalous symptoms.</P>
<P>In the following winter, a similar disorder attacked many people in Connecticut. Three men in Hartford, of one family, two brothers and a cousin, all men of robust health, were at∣tacked and carried off in the compass of a few days. Others of the same family, and several persons of a similar habit were affected, but recovered. It was far less general than in 1761.</P>
<P>This species of pleurisy appeared in Philadelphia as early as September 1791, the month when the malignant fever prevailed in New-York. A patient of Dr. Rush had a "red face, infla∣med eyes, a perpetual tossing and sighing, strong animal powers, but weak pulse and sizy blood." In February 1792 many cases of similar pleuritic fevers occurred in Philadelphia—diseases as∣sumed
<PB N="332" REF="036687_0336_100AA3136B9593D8"/>
the inflammatory diathesis which has remarkably charac∣terized the epidemic of the last pestilential period.</P>
<P>In the spring of the year 1798, a mortal fever raged in Fred∣ericktown, Maryland, beginning with lassitude, chills and pain in the head, and producing, on the third day, vertigo and spasm in the breast.</P>
<BIBL>Letter from Dr. Baltzell to Dr. Rush, dated May 2, 1798.</BIBL>
<P>In summer and autumn of 1797, a malignant fever, attended with dysentery, was epidemic in Portland and its vicinity, in the district of Maine. The dysentery subsided in October, but the fever continued. It appeared in the country, as well as town; and was usually conquered by the use of alkaline reme∣dies. Many of the patients had a yellow skin and the predomi∣nant symptoms of the yellow fever of our cities. In one instance, this disease put on the form of pestilence. A merchant, in a country village, where no suspicion of infection could be enter∣tained, was seized with a malignant fever; he lingered till the 36th day, and died highly putrid. His nurse was seized and died; after death appeared livid spots on the body. A servant also took the disease and died. The nurse communicated the disease to three persons in the family where she lay ill.</P>
<P>This last instance is decisive evidence that the pestilential yel∣low fever not only originates in our country, but in villages, in the 44th degree of latitude, a more temperate climate than that of New-York and Philadelphia.</P>
<P>In the winter succeeding, the pestilential principle still exhib∣ited its effects. The fever continued to prevail, being ushered in with nausea, vomiting and chills succeeded by heat; but it was generally accompanied with a sore throat and scarlet efflo∣rescence. It prevailed in almost every town in the county.</P>
<BIBL>Dr. Barker's letter, Med. Repos. vol. 2. 147.</BIBL>
<P>The year 1798 was remarkable for the most general preva∣lence of the plague of our climate, that has been known; and in some cities, the disease was peculiarly malignant.</P>
<P>The preceding winter had been unusually long and cold—the May following was dry beyond what is recollected in any former years—June was remarkable for deluging rains, which occasioned floods in the Connecticut, Delaware and Susquehannah rivers,
<PB N="333" REF="036687_0337_100AA34C30414D50"/>
which did no inconsiderable injury. Two or three of the first days of July were excessively hot, and succeeded by twenty days of very cool weather—then commenced a long period of the most sultry weather ever known in our climate, accompanied, in some places, with great rains.</P>
<P>Catarrhous fevers were frequent in the spring, the constant forerunners of autumnal sickness. Bilious fevers also occurred, in a few cases very early, indicating the predominant condition of the atmosphere. In summer and autumn, the grass-hoppers multiplied to such a degree from Pennsylvania to New-England, as to devour vegetables, and essentially injure the pastures and grass fields.</P>
<P>The pestilential fever in Philadelphia appeared early in the season—a number of cases in June, and still more in July. In August early, the city was alarmed and soon deserted by at least three fourths of its inhabitants. The disease was unusually mor∣tal; and extended to the remotest parts of the city, where it had not formerly prevailed. Owing to this circumstance, some families suffered, which had escaped in former years. The num∣ber of deaths amounted to about 3440. The disease, as usual, abated with the appearance of frost; but individuals were at∣tacked with it, and carried off, in the midst of the following winter.</P>
<P>It is alledged by some persons that the fever was introduced into Philadelphia by the ship Deborah, which arrived from Jer∣emie, and anchored near Race-street wharf, on the 18th of July. It is admitted that persons who went on board, soon af∣ter sickened and died; and so did others sicken and die, without going near that ship. The truth is, many cases of the disease had occurred three or four weeks, <HI>before her arrival.</HI> The ship had lost people by fever on her passage and might be infected; and persons visiting her might receive that infection; but these facts do not reach the point. The epidemic <HI>began</HI> in all parts of the city, in scattering cases, <HI>previous to the arrival of this fo∣mes,</HI> and had the ship never arrived, that epidemic would have ravaged the city. This is evident from the number of its pre∣cursors.</P>
<P>This pestilential fever carried off fifty-seven persons in the
<PB N="334" REF="036687_0338_100AA314F4213700"/>
village of Marcus Hook, where the first persons seized were a shallop-man and others from Philadelphia. But many cases oc∣curred which could be traced to no infection. See Dr. Sayre's letter in Currie's Memoirs, p. 136. In Chester died 50 of the same fever.</P>
<P>At Wilmington, in the state of Delaware, thirty miles from Philadelphia, the same disease raged with more than its ordinary mortality. Its victims amounted to 250. It appears that the disease was introduced by the fugitives from Philadelphia, and by watermen who ply between Wilmington and Philadelphia.</P>
<BIBL>See Dr. Tilton's letter in Dr. Currie's Memoirs, p. 138.</BIBL>
<P>The fever also prevailed in New-Castle and at Duck creek in the same state.</P>
<P>Letters from respectable physicians, in the public prints, have informed us that this disease prevailed also in some parts of New-Jersey, as at Bridgetown and Woodbury; and especially near the meadows on the borders of the Delaware. From careful examination, it was found that the disease must have originated where it existed; no intercourse having been held with infected places. In some instances the fever was probably infectious.</P>
<P>At Norwalk in Connecticut several persons died of the same distemper. The physicians are doubtful as to its origin; as some cases may be traced to a diseased person who had been in New-York. Three cases however occurred at some miles distance from the heart of the town, in persons who had not been in the least exposed to infection.</P>
<BIBL>M. S. letter from Dr. Betts.</BIBL>
<P>In the first week of August, appeared a bilious fever in New-York, between Old slip and Coenties slip, in the street next to the water; a place remarked for great accumulations of filthy substances. By the exertions of the Health Commissioners, in covering these nuisances with fresh earth, this alarming fever subsided in that neighborhood, and disappeared by the 26th of that month.</P>
<P>But on the 12th, the pestilential fever appeared in other parts of the city, and about the 20th, began to extend and assume a more formidable aspect. The district of the city, subjected to its most deadly effects, was that section comprehended between
<PB N="335" REF="036687_0339_100AA34E855A02A8"/>
John-street and Beekman-street, particularly in Cliff-street and its neighborhood. The probable cause of this effect, was the fetid air from large quantities of spoiled beef, stored in the cel∣lars in Pearl-street, on the windward side of this section. The cellars were filled with water by heavy rains, or were other∣wise damp; which circumstance, added to the extreme heat of the season, occasioned a greater loss of salted provisions, than perhaps was ever before known. To augment the effect, large quantities of pickle had been discharged, in the process of re∣packing beef not yet spoiled, but in a bad state, which pickle had been carried by the gutters into a sewer in Burling slip, from which issued a very offensive smell.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>There is reason to believe, that salt, if not sufficient to preserve the article to which it is applied, renders it doubly noxious in a state of putrefaction; and that a small quantity of salt will accelerate the pro∣cess of putrefaction. From an experiment related to me by Mr. Moses Brown of Providence, it is proved that a piece of flesh, in pure water, will not putrefy as soon as in water, in which a few grains of salt have been dissolved.</P>
<P>Do not the saline particles of the air, on the sea coast, render the putrefaction of flesh and vegetables more rapid, and the exhalations more deleterious, than perfectly fresh water? And is not this one cause, why pestilential diseases appear first, and are most general, in mari∣time places?</P>
<P>Dr. Cogswell informs me that a boat-man on Connecticut river, in the hot weather of 1798, contracted a violent fever of which he died, by sleeping in an open boat, near a quantity of pickle which had leaked out of a barrel of salted provisions. The disease was of a very ma∣lignant kind.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>About the last of August, the inhabitants of New-York were greatly alarmed; some removed from the east to the west side of Broadway, a part of the city which has hitherto been exempted from the violent effects of the yellow fever; but a great pro∣portion of the people deserted the city. The disease was more malignant, than in its preceding visits, and exhibited more fre∣quently the bubo and carbuncle. It extended over two thirds of the city, and numbered with the dead about two thousand of its inhabitants. I am informed the disease was less generally characterized with the inflammatory diathesis, and that venesec∣tion was less generally attended with salutary effects, than in for∣mer years.</P>
<P>This disease exhibited little infection, beyond the limits of its own amosphere. In the hospital, at a little distance from the
<PB N="336" REF="036687_0340_100AA317341B10C8"/>
city, were admitted about 300 patients, ill with that disease; yet sixteen nurses, seven washerwomen, and the boatmen who conveyed the sick from the city to the hospital, <HI>all escaped.</HI> Dr. Douglass, the attending physician, escaped the disease, until October, when he visited his friends and slept <HI>in the city,</HI> three days after which he was seized with the fever.</P>
<BIBL>See Letters from the Health-Office, by Dr. Bailey, whose zeal, talents and industry, in his employment, have rarely been equalled.</BIBL>
<P>The last fact is very important towards correcting the popular errors respecting the contagion of this fever. In the city per∣sons took the fever—in the hospital they did not. That is, the distemper has an atmosphere, in which it is readily contracted— beyond that atmosphere, it is not infectious. In other words, it is a <HI>condition of the atmosphere,</HI> and <HI>not the effluvia from the sick,</HI> which is to be dreaded.</P>
<P>Thus, in 1797, the fugitives and sick from Philadelphia did <HI>not</HI> spread the fever in Wilmington—in 1798, they did. That is, in 1797 the atmosphere of Wilmington would not <HI>generate</HI> and <HI>nurse</HI> the disease—in 1798, it would.</P>
<P>In Boston, the disease began near the town dock and the neighboring wharves, in the month of June; but its most vio∣lent effects were experienced on the south side of Fort-Hill, an elevated part of the town and exposed to free air. This cir∣cumstance has occasioned no small surprise; but as the fever of 1796 began in that part of the town, perhaps we may find the cause in the very extensive flat, between Boston and Dorchester point, which is uncovered at low water; perhaps in the expo∣sure of that hill to the direct rays of the sun; perhaps in the na∣ture of the soil which is clay of a solid texture, and fitted to re∣tain on its surface whatever impure substances are thrown from houses.</P>
<P>The fever afterwards invaded the north part of the town, and a street near the pond; supposed to be excited by noxious exha∣lations. Some parts of the town, which are low and filthy, es∣caped the fever.</P>
<P>At first it attacked the most robust young men, and the diath∣esis was highly inflammatory. Later in the season, it attacked
<PB N="337" REF="036687_0341_100AA35100B63870"/>
persons of all ages and habits. At first it was not infectious, but in the later stages of its progress, it exhibited infection. Is disappeared with the arrival of frost, after carrying off nearly 200 patients.</P>
<BIBL>M. S. letter from Dr. Eliot.</BIBL>
<P>See a full account of the disease in a letter from Dr. Rand, published by order of the Academy of Arts and Sciences. This gentleman observes that no infection appeared, except in places where the disease was originally contracted.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That is, infection was attached to the <HI>place,</HI> rather than to the <HI>persons</HI> of the diseased—a fact which is true of every pestilence.</NOTE></P>
<BIBL>Massachusetts Mercury, Feb. 8, 1799.</BIBL>
<P>The same malady appeared in Portsmouth, New-Hampshire, with equal mortality, as far as it extended; but its progress was limited to one street near the water.</P>
<P>New-London, in Connecticut, is situated in a very healthy part of the country, on a harbor, whose shores as well as the surrounding lands, are dry and rocky—its population about 3000 inhabitants.</P>
<P>In the last week in August 1798, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> town was suddenly in∣vaded by the plague of our country, which began in the family of Mr. Bingham, keeper of the Union coffee-house. No ves∣sels from the West-Indies, no sick from other places, occur, in this instance, to help out popular credulity. The idea of im∣portation is abandoned by the citizens of the town. The fever was very fatal within its atmosphere, which was confined to Bank street and its vicinity; a part of the city well built, clean and airy as any street in the town. Within a small space, were fifteen houses, inhabited by ninety-two persons—of which ninety were affected with the disease; thirty-three of this number died, and two only escaped the fever. The disease prevailed about eight weeks and destroyed eighty-one lives.</P>
<BIBL>Printed account of the fever by Charles Holt.</BIBL>
<P>On enquiry I find that this disease in New-London had its precursors, in sporadic cases of the same fever, in the three pre∣ceding summers. In 1795, died Dr. Joseph W. Lee with all the symptoms of the yellow fever. Some instances occurred in
<PB N="338" REF="036687_0342_100AA318D943D5A0"/>
1796; and in 1797 died of the same, Matthew Griswold, Esq. and soon after his mother; indicating the communication of in∣fection. Yet in these years, it did not spread and become epi∣demic. The pestilential period however was progressing in that town, as appears by the bills of mortality; for the ordinary number of deaths does not exceed 60 in a healthy year; but in 1795, the number amounted to 86—in 1796, to 80—in 1797, to 101—in 1798, to 133. Here we observe a great augmenta∣tion in the mortality of the town, several years before the crisis of pestilence, and especially in the year next preceding it. The importance of this fact towards a right understanding of the causes of epidemic pestilence, cannot be mistaken.</P>
<P>Considerable quantities of salted fish, which lay in certain stores in New-London, and which had not been well cured with the usual quantity of salt, became fetid and offensive, altho not pu∣trid, and assumed a red cast with a slimy feeling—it also lost its texture and firmness. This was opened and spread in the streets for the purpose of being dried; and from its offensiveness and vicinity to the place where the disease first appeared, it is suppo∣sed to have been an exciting cause of the fever. This opinion has doubtless some foundation; but putrid fish will not always occasion disease. It is probably true that the bad state of the fish was partly owing to a previous bad state of the air; altho it afterwards became a <HI>cause</HI> of a <HI>worse state</HI> of the air.</P>
<P>What seems to put this beyond doubt, is, the unusual number of musketoes, in the adjacent country, and the multitudes of flies of uncommon size, exceeding what had been before obser∣ved. With these phenomena before our eyes, we can be at no loss to account for the pestilential fever of New-London.</P>
<P>The usual lake and river fever prevailed in the same season, in many of the interior parts of the country; as at Royalton in Vermont, on the Grand Isles in Lake Champlain, at New-Mil∣ford in Connecticut, and in various parts of the state of New-York; in which places, it was attended with considerable mor∣tality. Sporadic cases occurred in all parts, and in the healthiest situations, of the country. In many places, intermittents and dysentery were unusually violent and obstinate.</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="036687_0343_100A89BFFB4654E8"/>I have no account of the temperature of the weather in any part of Europe, during the summer of 1798; except that in some parts of Sweden, the first months of the summer were ex∣cessively dry, as the month of May was in America.</P>
<P>A pestilential fever appeared in Italy in June; but I have no details of its progress. It is however to be observed that this fever was preceded by a violent earthquake in some part of the Tuscan territories, in the month of May, which did no small injury.</P>
<P>In autumn broke out a pestilential fever on the Baltic, in Dant∣zick or its vicinity. The government of Denmark, in conse∣quence of official information of the prevalence of this disease, directed all ships from Dantzick and the neighboring ports to be watched with vigilance, and appointed a committee of quarantine.</P>
<P>According to the report of a master of a vessel, there was an eruption in Teneriffe in the summer of 1798, which lasted sev∣eral weeks. This volcano had been quiet for 94 years.</P>
<P>In November and December, the pestilence in America was succeeded as usual by influenza, which was very prevalent in all parts of the country, and in the southern states attended with some mortality. This was merely a change of the form of the epidemic.</P>
<P>The winter of 1798-9 was very long and severe in both hem∣ispheres. In the United States, it began about the middle of November, with snow, and a heavy fall of snow on the 18th and 19th was followed by severe cold that lasted till the second week in January. From this time, there was a relaxation of cold for about three weeks, and the ice in Connecticut river gave way. But in February commenced severe cold, which contin∣ued, for the most part to the vernal equinox. April was also cold; severe frosts occurred often, and checked vegetation. On the 2d and 8th of May were considerable falls of snow, followed by frost. On the morning of the 4th and 5th, we had ice at New-Haven as thick as window-glass. Peaches blossomed about the middle of May, and apples were not in full bloom, till the 22d. This long duration of cold exhausted all the barns of hay and other fodder, and multitudes of cattle perished in various parts of the country.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="036687_0344_100AA31CE3DA8B08"/>In Europe, the winter was equally severe. The rivers in England, Germany, Holland and France were covered with solid ice, and at the breaking up of winter, the Rhine rose and burst its barriers, inundating many parts of Holland with terri∣ble destruction. The severity of the winter was felt even in the south of Italy, and the French and Neapolitan troops suffered greatly from snow on the Appenine, in the vicinity of Naples. In Siberia, we are informed by the public prints, perished whole villages of men and cattle by the severity of the frost.</P>
<P>In America, the diseases of the winter were characterized by the predominant diathesis of the reigning epidemic constitution, a yellow skin and bilious discharges. An earthquake of consid∣erable extent was felt in the Carolinas on the 12th of April. What will be the state of health in the ensuing summer, must be left to be determined by the event. The present pestilence has been long and severe and the citizens look with impatience, for the usual salubrious state of their atmosphere.</P>
<P>In August, about the time the pestilence began to show itself in New-York, immense numbers of flies died suddenly, and oc∣casioned no small speculation and alarm. Some were found on the floors; others adhering to the ceilings of rooms, and what is singular, their bodies became whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. A pestilential air usually generates flies in unusual numbers; but on this occasion, some sudden change in the elements, destroyed their lives. How little do we know of the powers of the elements, and the nature of the alterations in them which produce such astonishing effects. Will imported infection account for such phenomena?</P>
<P>This is the best statement of facts I have been able to make from sixteen months investigation. It is not improbable that some mistakes have occurred, which more time and more ample materials, would enable me to correct. But I trust that the substance of the statements is accurate, and that no error of con∣sequence will be found to result from them, to impeach the gen∣eral principles suggested in this work.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT. Additional facts, collected on a journey which I made through the Northern States, while this volume was in the press.</HEAD>
<P>IN the autumn of 1732 raged in New-York a malignant, in∣fectious fever, of which died seventy persons in a few weeks.</P>
<BIBL>M. S. of Mr. Alexander.</BIBL>
<P>In 1745 a malignant bilious fever prevailed in New-York, of which died an eminent physician of the city, Dr. Nicoll. By the description of the disease, given to me by a gentleman who was affected with it, there appears to be no question that it was the same disease now called yellow fever.</P>
<P>About this time, for the year is not exactly known, a malig∣nant epidemic disease laid waste the Indian tribes. By the de∣scription of the symptoms, as given by Indian traders, then among the tribes, and still living, it is certain this was the infec∣tious yellow fever. In consequence of this distemper, the Sene∣cas removed their quarters two or three times, in a few years—it being a practice among the natives to abandon the place infected with this plague. The disease was confined to the Indians—the white people, living and trading with them, not being affected.</P>
<P>In 1746 the Mohegan tribe of Indians, between New-Lon∣don and Norwich, was wasted by the same malady. Dr. Tracy of Norwich now deceased, was the only white man affected—he attended them as their physician. From Mr. Philemon Tracy, a son of the doctor, who has taken the trouble to examin a Mo∣hegan priest, a man of good sense and integrity, who was him∣self affected by the disorder, I have the following account of this pestilence.—That it appeared in August and prevailed till cold weather—that about one hundred of the tribe perished— that it was the year after the reduction of Cape Breton (of course
<PB N="342" REF="036687_0346_100AA31E69FAF6A8"/>
in 1746—and Dr. Tracy's books confirm the dates mentioned by the Indian)—that the patient first complained of a severe pain in the head and back, which was followed by fever—in three or four days, the skin turned as yellow as gold, a vomiting of black matter took place and generally a bleeding at the nose and mouth, which continued, till the patient died. These are the words of the old Indian, as penned at the time by my in∣formant.</P>
<P>It will be remarked that this was a local pestilence, the fever being confined to a single tribe of Indians and not prevailing in the neighboring towns. But it will be remarked also that this was the same year, it prevailed in Albany, when the bills of mortality were generally high.</P>
<P>I have ascertained that the canker-worm, which lately ravaged the fruit trees in New-England, appeared as early as 1788 or 1789.</P>
<P>A fatal malignant disease raged among the tribes of the Mo∣hawk Indians, about the year 1776, and reduced some of them to a few men.</P>
<P>From Dr. Wheeler of Redhook, on the Hudson, I learn that the angina scarlatina appeared there in January 1789 and prevailed till April—it prevailed also in the two succeeding win∣ters.</P>
<P>The influenza, in that year, first appeared there about the middle of October, and prevailed two months, among all ages and both sexes. Catarrhal coughs have been prevalent every year, since that time. In the spring of 1793, angina scarlatina, mumps and catarrhal coughs prevailed till June, and disappeared. Soon after commenced the remitting fever. In some cases the paroxysms invaded the patient in the form of madness.</P>
<P>The reader will note that in our interior country, the remit∣ting fever of that distinguished year, 1793, had nearly the same spring precursors, as the yellow fever in Philadelphia.</P>
<P>The measles at Redhook in 1795, partook of the character of the preceding epidemic fevers; beginning with a highly in∣flammatory diathesis, and sometimes ending in typhus, with pe∣techiae, vibices and hemorrhagy. Pleurisies had the same char∣acter.</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="036687_0347_100AA35855D0A3F8"/>At Brattleborough, on the Connecticut, a family by the name of Morgan were seized in 1791 with a fever of the typhus kind, and six of them died. Several persons who visited the family took the disease and died, and there its progress ended. The family resides in a healthy situation, near a small active stream of water; and no visible cause could be assigned for the origin of this distemper. These facts are taken from Dr. Hall of that town. It will be remembered that this was the year when au∣tumnal diseases first put on the malignant aspect of our late pesti∣lence, when the plague broke out in Egypt and the yellow fever in the West-Indies began to assume what Dr. Chisholm calls unusual symptoms.</P>
<P>Dr. Center of Newport informs me that in 1798 occurred in that place many cases of a bilious fever bearing some resemblance to the infectious fever; and one case of decided carbuncular and glandular plague, in a man of robust constitution. There is no pretence of foreign origin, in any of those cases.</P>
<P>From sundry gentlemen living in Chelsea, a village at the landing in Norwich, I learn that two or three cases of malig∣nant bilious fever occurred there in 1798, marked with the usual symptoms of the infectious fever. Some of these cases could not possibly have been derived from infection. One of the pa∣tients might have contracted his disease at New-London.</P>
<P>Dr. Holyoke of Salem, in Massachusetts, informs me that in 1798, many cases of malignant bilious fever occurred in that town, which could not have been derived from infection.</P>
<P>From Dr. Woodruff and Dr. M'Clellan of Albany, I learn that several cases of malignant bilious fever appeared in that city, in 1798, marked with all the symptoms of the pestilence of our cities and which must have originated in that place. About one half who were seized, died.</P>
<P>The first case of influenza at Albany in 1789 is noted by Dr. M'Clellan to have occurred on the 30th of September. This was precisely the time of its appearance at Philadelphia, and a little after its first appearance at New-York. In the coun∣try, between New-York and Albany, it did not appear till a week or two later. These facts prove that this disease falls on distant places at the same time.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="036687_0348_100AA3200D655A10"/>The scarlatina anginosa appeared at Albany in the winter and spring of 1793, about the time it did in New-York and Phila∣delphia.</P>
<P>In every part of our country, one remark has been made by physicians, that from the year 1792 or 3, intermittents and re∣mittents have become more numerous and obstinate, and attend∣ed with unusual symptoms. In many places, these diseases have been multiplied in a ten-fold ratio; elucidating the principles of the great Sydenham, relative to "Constitutions of Air," and demonstrating the existence of a general cause in the insensible properties of the atmosphere, to which we may and must ascribe the pestilence of our maritime towns.</P>
<P>In 1798 multitudes of dead pike were observed to float down the Mohawk and Hudson.</P>
<P>From Dr. Thatcher I learn that for some years past, an au∣tumnal fever has prevailed in Plymouth, in Massachusetts, of the remitting kind, with low typhus symptoms. In winter it takes the type of the nervous fever. It was very prevalent in 1798 in that and a neighboring town.</P>
<P>From Dr. Smith of Hanover, in New-Hampshire, and Drs. Green and Trask of Windsor, in Vermont, I have obtained information respecting a very infectious fever which prevailed in those towns and the vicinity in 1798. This disease is described by Dr. Spalding in the Medical Repository, vol. 3. p. 5. It approaches nearly to the typhus mitior of Cullen, but the fiery red eye at the invasion seems to indicate its alliance to the in∣fectious fever of our cities; and it resembles the disease known by the popular name of long fever.</P>
<P>This fever, in Windsor and Hanover, was preceded by dys∣entery of uncommon malignancy in 1797, which, in Windsor, was attended with an unusual inflammation of the lungs. The disease which preceded these epidemics was the scarlatina angino∣sa, which was very prevalent in 1796.</P>
<P>It is worthy of notice that in all parts of our country, the au∣tumnal infectious fevers have had precursors in other epidemics, especially catarrhal complaints and anginas. I do not find an ex∣ception to this remark.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="036687_0349_100AA35AB9D50208"/>This fever at Windsor deserves further to be noticed for its in∣fectious or contagious quality. It was far <HI>less</HI> fatal, but <HI>more</HI> in∣fectious than the yellow fever of our cities. Nurses often took the disease, and when they returned to their dwellings in distant towns, rarely failed to communicate it to the whole family. This is a phenomenon rarely, perhaps never exhibited by the pestilence of our maritime towns, which has an atmosphere of its own out of which it is not communicated.</P>
<P>I have examined personally the positions of many of the towns where this fever and dysentery have been most prevalent, and I find no where any marsh that can rationally be supposed to originate these distempers. In general the towns are situated on a basis of clay, between high ridges of land or mountains, where the heat of the sun is greatly concentrated, and on the margin of rivers. To this description, there are some exceptions as to the soil; some towns being on sand or gravel. The neigh∣borhood of fresh streams of water cannot be admitted as a cause of these fevers—nothing being more falubrious than such streams. But I am persuaded from careful observation, that, under a pes∣tilential constitution of air, great heat is the immediate exciting cause of autumnal fevers, in situations not exposed to marsh effluvia.</P>
<P>With respect to the origin of the pestilential fever in Ports∣mouth, in 1798, the facts are as follow.</P>
<P>A laboring man, who was given to liquor, received his wages on Saturday evening. He was seized with the malignant fever, and died on the next Wednesday. While he lay ill, a vessel arrived which had lost a man or two by the fever on her voyage, but no person was ill on board, at the time of her arrival. Some of the persons who afterwards died of the fever, had been on board of that vessel; but whether they took the disease from in∣fection or not, cannot be known. The first case occurred <HI>before</HI> the arrival. This is an agreed point. I have these facts from two of the principal gentlemen of that town, one of them a respecta∣ble physician; the other, the person who paid the wages to the man who first died. All my enquiries have been made at the sources of correct information; and I find every where <HI>popular reports</HI> are false or incorrect. Yet popular reports are received as truth by many physicians and writers, and are made the basis of false and pernicious theories, both in America and Europe.</P>
<P><PB N="346" REF="036687_0350_100AA35CB9676770"/>The fever in Portsmouth was limited in its progress to the northern part of the town. In the southern part, at the same time, prevailed a malignant dysentery, which was as mortal as the fever in the northern part. The line of division was drawn by a wide street or square on which stands the court-house. The scar∣let fever had been prevalent in the town for two years preceding.</P>
<P>In 1799, the present summer, many persons have taken the pestilential fever from vessels arrived from the West-Indies; but in most, or all cases, the fever has become extinct, without any considerable mortality. In Boston, the mortality was limited to two or three persons.</P>
<P>The case at Newburyport was singular. A vessel went and returned from the West-Indies, without a case of malignant fever; but as she arrived at the mouth of the river Merrimack, 18 days from St. Thomas's, a boy was seized with the fever, and afterwards one or two others Several persons took the disease and died; but people left the vicinity, and the disorder be∣came extinct. This was a fever generated on board of the vessel.</P>
<P>The beginning of the summer of 1799, tho late, was favor∣able to vegeta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion, and the first crops were good. Wheat, which had been blasted, for several preceding years, in the east∣ern states, was excellent.</P>
<P>But in July commenced a most distressing drouth, in all the northern states; and particularly in the middle states, and the interior country; by which the maize, buck-wheat and potatoes were greatly injured. In some parts of the state of New-York, the maize was totally destroyed.</P>
<P>Over the eastern states, a species of caterpillar of small size appeared in unparalleled numbers, covering the wild cherry-tree, the apple, the willow, the ash, and the hickory. In some parts, a large caterpillar, with variegated colors, stripped the black oak of all its leaves. Grass-hoppers were as numerous as the blades of grass, and in some places, injured greatly the grass and other vegetables. But especially to be noted were the small toads of the color described by Fernelius, "Coloris cineritii" like ashes; of the size of a filbert, and in numbers not to be estimated. These were numerous also in 1798. They answer the descrip∣tion of those which medical writers of former ages observed to be the forerunners and companions of pestilence. At what time
<PB N="347" REF="036687_0351_100AA35FCEF2C070"/>
they appeared and disappeared, is not exactly known—they were most generally observed in July.</P>
<P>In the spring prevailed influenza or catarrhal fevers; in some places cynanche maligna; and generally rheumatic complaints, and slight ulcerations of the throat. In many places, the fevers of winter were characterized with a yellow skin and bilious dis∣charges. All these marked the continuance of a pestilential atmosphere.</P>
<P>The plague showed itself early, in scattered cases, in Phila∣delphia; but disappeared, to the unspeakable joy of the inhabit∣ants. Alas! When such cases appear in July, and especially if other diseases in winter and spring manifest symptoms of the pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣vailing epidemic, it is hardly possible that our cities should escape a pestilential fever in autumn. This terrible scourge renewed its ravages in Philadelphia and New-York; and in various parts of our country, bilious fevers appeared with malignant symptoms.</P>
<P>At Hartford, on the Connecticut, appeared the malignant fever in August, to the surprise of the inhabitants and of the state. People who have no just ideas of the nature and origin of this disease, attempted to find the cause in some vessel from the West-Indies; but being disappointed, resorted to a small coasting vessel. On examination it appears, that this vessel was used as a market boat between Connecticut river and New-York —the master had died in June, but of what disease, I am not able to learn. Another master took possession of her, and find∣ing her very dirty, with the remains of various vegetables, he overhauled her and gave her a thorough cleansing. He took in at New-York a cargo of salt, and sailed to New-Haven, where the vessel lay some time, about the middle of July. Here the salt was purchased by a merchant of Hartford, and the vessel ordered round to that place, where she arrived and discharged her cargo, in the beginning of August. From the time the ves∣sel left New-York, to the time of discharging the salt, must have been from four to six weeks. After leaving Hartford, and go∣ing down the river, the master and mate of this vessel were sei∣zed with the fever and died. Instead therefore of being <HI>im∣ported,</HI> the fever was <HI>exported.</HI></P>
<P>Some attempts were made to trace all the first cases of the fever to that vessel; but it does not appear that more than one
<PB N="348" REF="036687_0352_100AA3620A75A878"/>
person who had the disease, was ever on board; and it is <HI>proved</HI> that most of the persons affected were never near that vessel and never visited the sick. It is proved further th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en or twelve persons employed in unloading the vessel, not one was ever af∣fected by the malady. Yet even in this case, the silly tale of importation is swallowed with eagerness by the advocates of that doctrin.</P>
<P>I confess myself weary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d ashamed of refuting such gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd∣less opinions and surmises; but it is a task which truth and jus∣tice and public happiness demand. The truth is, the spot where this fever arose, is low ground, retaining water to stagnate after the spring floods—built upon in a crouded irregular manner— extremely filthy—penetrated by a creek which has been dried and neglected, and become the reservoir of every unclean thing —in the vicinity is a slaughter-house, where loads of garbage contribute to render the air foul and noxious. Let any man walk over the ground and examin it with care, as I have done since the fever, and he will be convinced that no imported fomes was necessary, in that place, to breed a pestilence.</P>
<P>But one of the strongest arguments to prove the domestic ori∣gin of the malady, is, what people rarely consider. Numerous fevers of the remitting kind, and typhus mitior, have originated on the same ground, for several years past; and in 1798, two cases of malignant yellow fever—one of which terminated in three days. These fevers marked the predominant state of that local atmosphere, and decide the question of domestic origin.</P>
<P>On the 15th of July a tremendous hail storm passed over Con∣necticut from the westward, attended with violent wind and thunder. The stones and pieces of ice were of various sizes, from that of a walnut to that of a hen's egg. In Goshen, Corn∣wall▪ New-Hartford, &amp;c. on the west, and Lebanon, Franklin, &amp;c. on the east of the Connecticut, the grass, corn and every green thing was injured or destroyed; glass was broken, trees galled, and small animals killed. The champain country on the Connecticut was less injured. This storm, unexampled in Con∣necticut, resembles numberless hail storms described in history, as the precursors and companions of pestilence.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IX. Bills of mortality for the two last centuries, with the principal phenomena of the elements.</HEAD>
<P>OUR accounts of diseases and the phenomena of the world, which appear to be connected with them, are altogether imperfect. But in the two last centuries, we have a tolerable history of dis∣eases, and occasionally an account of the seasons, and remarka∣ble occurrences. In the following tables, the reader will find the bills of mortality for London, Augsburg, Dresden, Boston, one Church in Philadelphia, with a few bills of Paris and Dub∣lin; to which are prefixed such of the remarkable phenomena of the elements, as I have been able to collect. As winter makes a part of two years, the word <HI>severe</HI> is set against the year which preceded the winter. Thus against the year 1607, the word <HI>severe</HI> refers to the winter of 1607-8. The blanks denote, ei∣ther that nothing singular occurred in those years, or that I have no account of the occurrences. Further enquiries might proba∣bly enable me to fill many of those blanks.</P>
<P>Bills of mortality do not exhibit a complete view of epidemics; as some of the more remarkable, especially <HI>influenza,</HI> destroy but few lives, and the bills of the years when that disease alone prevailed, are remarkably low. It is often the immediate pre∣cursor of pestilential diseases in autumn; in which cases, the bills of the year are very high.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION X. Remarks on the preceding History and Tables.</HEAD>
<P>IMPERFECT as ancient history is, in regard to the accounts of diseases, and the extraordinary phenomena of nature, we find that between the year B. C. 480 and the Christian era, a num∣ber of violent plagues occurred, most of which coincided in time with the following phenomena, comets, eruptions of vol∣canoes, earthquakes, drouth, severe winters, diseases among cattle. Of thirteen comets mentioned in the foregoing history, which are all whose dates I am able to ascertain, <HI>eight</HI> of them coincide with volcanic eruptions of Etna, the only volcano of any note, which the history of that period has recorded; and <HI>ele<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> of them coincide in time with pestilence. If we con∣sider the scarcity of our materials for a history of these phenomena, at that period, and make due allowances for the uncertainty of chronology, we shall find reason to be surprised at such a number of these coincidences. In several instances we find extreme drouth and very severe winters to correspond in time with comets and eruptions of Etna, conformable to facts in modern days.</P>
<P>On this subject, history is barren also for many centuries after the Christian era. Yet in every period, even in the dark ages, we find numerous coincidences of the great phenomena above mentioned. All the great plagues that have afflicted mankind, have been accompanied with violent agitations of the elements.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Modern philosophy objects to the popular sense in which the word, <HI>elements,</HI> is used; since it appears that what has usually been considered as an <HI>element,</HI> is found by modern chymistry to be a com∣pound substance, resolvable into parts, in their nature and properties, distinct. Notwithstanding th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se discoveries, I cannot consent to discard the popular use of the word <HI>element.</HI> Nature presents to the senses of man, fire, earth, air and water, in a particular and predominant form. This is the form in which they appear to be most useful to man, and to be the constituent materials of other substances, as well as the agents in carrying on the great visible operations of the system. I therefore consider the popular distribution as natural and convenient.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="036687_0366_100AA3801A2A9008"/>This observation rests particularly on the events that preceded and attended the pestilences of the following periods. A. D. 80—167—252—375—400—445—542—558—590—639— 679—682—745—762—802—905—994—1005—1031— 1044—1069—1106—1135—1142—1162—1181—1222— 1242—1300—1347—1368—1400—1477—1500—1531— 1577—1602—1625—1636—1665—1699—1709—1719— 1728—1743—1751—1760—1770—1783—1789. Many facts in other periods concur to prove the truth of the remark.</P>
<P>The phenomenon most generally and closely connected with pestilence is an earthquake. From all the facts that I can find in history, I question whether an instance of a considerable plague in any country, can be mentioned, which has not been immediately preceded or accompanied with convulsions of the earth. If any exceptions have occurred, they have escaped my researches. It does not happen that <HI>every place</HI> where pestilence prevails, is shaken; but during the progress of the diseases which I denominate <HI>pestilence,</HI> and which run, in certain periods, over large portions of the globe, some parts of the earth, and espe∣cially those which abound most with subterranean fire, are vio∣lently agitated.</P>
<P>By adverting to the foregoing history, the reader will find that all those years, in which considerable earthquakes have oc∣curred in America, have been remarkably sickly. These years are 1638, 1647, 1658, 1662 and 3, 1668, 1727, 1755, 1783. See the history and the bills of mortality. Even the slighter shocks, have been attended with considerable sickness, or have introduced a series of epidemics, being cotemporary with the measles, influenza or sore throat; as in 1669, 1720, 1737, 1757, 1761, 1769, 1771, 1791, 1797.</P>
<P>To enumerate the instances in Europe and Asia, would be a useless repetition of the events related in the preceding history, to which the reader is referred.</P>
<P>Another phenomenon, which, next to earthquakes, appears
<PB N="12" REF="036687_0367_100AA381A1932B48"/>
to be most closely connected with epidemic diseases, is the erup∣tion of fire from volcanic mountains. In this article, history is deficient, or I have not been fortunate enough to find the works necessary to furnish a complete view of these phenomena. There are whole centuries in which the books I have consulted, men∣tion no eruption of Etna and Vesuvius. The account of erup∣tions in Iceland, from the year 1000, taken from Pennant's Arctic Zoology, vol. 1. 331, is probably complete, or nearly so. Of the volcanoes in the Andes, we have very few accounts; as well as of those in the Moluccas. Of those in the Arctic regions of Asia and America, we know very little.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding these defects, we are able, by the eruptions in Italy, Sicily and Iceland, to arrive to some very important conclusions. The reader must have noticed, in the preceding history, the coincidences in time between volcanic discharges, and winters of unusual severity. These discharges either precede or follow the winter. Thus the eruptions of 1766, 1779 and 1783, were immediately followed by intensely cold winters. The severe winters of 1762-3 and 1779-80, were speedily fol∣lowed by eruptions. These instances will serve as samples of the ordinary course of these events. Sometimes the eruptions continue or are repeated, for a number of years in succession; but the eruptions when continued are moderate and the seasons variable. When the volcanoes have been, for some years, quiet, and that suspension is followed by a great discharge, it appears to me that severe winters invariably follow or precede the dis∣charge, within a few months. So also when an eruption is con∣tinued for a number of years, if at any time the discharge be∣comes violent, a severe winter attends it; as in 1669. Etna was in a state of eruption from 1664 to 1679; but in 1669, the discharge was immensely augmented, and the winters next preceding and following, were very severe.</P>
<P>There are some years in which eruptions are noted, of which I find no account, respecting the seasons. Perhaps some of these will, on further investigation, be found to be exceptions.</P>
<P>It is to be observed that, in some cases, a severe winter ex∣tends to both hemispheres, sometimes to one only, and in a few
<PB N="13" REF="036687_0368_100AA384E63F36C8"/>
cases, to a part of a hemisphere only. Thus in 1607-8—1683-4 —1762<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3—1766-7—1779-80—1783-4, the severity extended to both hemispheres. In 1640-41—1739-40, and in other in∣stances, the severe winter in Europe preceded, by one year, a similar winter in America. In a few instances, severe frost takes place in one hemisphere, during a series of mild winters in the other; but this is less common. In general, the severity hap∣pens, in both hemispheres at once, or in two winters in imme∣diate succession; and as far as evidence has yet appeared, this se∣verity is closely attendant on volcanic discharges, with very few exceptions.</P>
<P>Another phenomenon which usually coincides in time with se∣vere winters, is the approach of comets. I have been struck with surprise at the coincidences of this kind. There are a few instances on record of mild winters, during the appearance of these bodies; but in these cases, the comets have appeared to be small, or to pass the system at an immense distance from the earth. The large comets and those which approach near to the earth, <HI>seem</HI> to produce almost uniformly great heat, excessive drouth, followed by very cold winters, tremendous storms of wind, rain, snow and hail, unusual tides or swell of the ocean, and usually, volcanic eruptions. How far these phenomena are connected, as cause and effect, future observations may de∣termin. Some of them occur so uniformly in the same year, that I cannot resist the evidence of their connection.</P>
<P>After a volcano has been many years quiet, its discharges are, I believe, always preceded by extreme drouth; and this defect of water is not only observable in the vicinity of the volcano, but often extends over a whole continent, if not over the world. Many instances have been related; it is sufficient here to men∣tion the excessive drouth in 1762 and 1782, preceding eruptions of Etna and Heckla. In these years, almost all springs were exhausted over a great portion of America.</P>
<P>Cold winters sometimes follow wet seasons, but more gene∣rally a very hot summer or very dry autumn. Sometimes two or three severe winters occur in succession, as in 1766, 67 and 68 —and in America from 1796 to 1799.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="036687_0369_100AA387EBC26098"/>The years when comets approach, or volcanoes discharge fire, and when the atmosphere exhibits fiery appearances, as meteors, streams of light, and mock suns, are, beyond comparison, the most tempestuous. Witness the years 1766, 1771 and 72, 1780, 1783, 4 and 5, 1788, 1797. In such years, the risk on ves∣sels at sea, is greatly increased.</P>
<P>As dry seasons usually precede volcanic eruptions, so very wet seasons often follow them. This seems not to be the inva∣riable course of events; but there are remarkable instances of deluging rains after these discharges. Witness the seasons follow∣ing the universal convulsions of the earth in 1692 and 3, and 1766. Thus, the electricity is re-conducted to the earth.</P>
<P>In every case, I believe this remark will be found t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; that the approach of comets, and volcanic eruptions distu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the regu∣lar course of the seasons. The heat of summer and the cold of winter are in extremes; more snow is generated in winter, and more hail in summer; tempests are more violent and frequent; meteors more numerous, and rain more unequally distributed over the earth.</P>
<P>A series of epidemic diseases, measles, influenza, affections of the throat, followed by pestilential fevers, appear generally to commence and take their departure, from some of the great agi∣tations of the elements above recited. This at least has been the case in America in the four last periods, beginning with 1756-7, 1769 and 70, 1782 and 3, 1788 and 9. This fact will want no authority but a bare inspection of the preceding history, and tables.</P>
<P>The continuance and the varieties of the diseases seem to de∣pend on similar disturbances in the elements; and as the dis∣charges and motions of the electrical fluid depend on no certain laws that are known, they are irregular, and may contribute to vary the order, and the nature of diseases. In some cases, there has been a continued series of epidemics, for twenty years, in which the common order is not exactly observed; but this is not frequent. A remarkable instance occurred between 1727 and 1744.</P>
<P>Those periods in general have been most distinguished for

sickness over the world, in which the fire of the earth has exhib∣ited the most numerous and violent effects. Witness the period from 1631 to 1637, when the three most noted volcanoes dis∣charged immense quantities of fire and lava; and severe pesti∣lence extended over all Europe and America. A similar re∣mark may be made concerning the period of the last universal pestilence in Europe from 1663 to 1666—also from 1691 to 1695—from 1727 to 30—1759 to 1764—1769 to 1772—1774 to 1777—1783 to 1786—and concerning some shorter periods, all of which produced epidemics in both hemispheres.</P>
<P>Slighter eruptions and earthquakes, which are almost annual, seem to have less effect. The fire of the globe is in perpetual motion or action, and to this great agent, philosophers are agreed, are to be ascribed the changes of seasons, and the generation of rain, hail and snow. Its operations however are not all of them visible, nor even perceptible, until they appear by their effects. It is probable that the <HI>invisible</HI> operations of the electrical fluid produce more effects than those which are seen. Indeed, we may question whether most of the visible phenomena of that principle, are not mere <HI>effects</HI> of that action which influences the vegetable and animal world. It is probable to me that neither seasons, earthquakes, nor volcanic eruptions, are the causes of the principal derangements we behold in animal and vegetable life, but are themselves the <HI>effects</HI> of those motions and invisible operations which affect mankind. Hence catarrh and other epi∣demics often appear, <HI>before</HI> the visible phenomena of eruptions and earthquakes.</P>
<P>P. S. After this work was prepared for the press, I was fa∣vored by Dr. Mitchill, with some extracts from a paper of Mr. Holm, a Swede, on the subject of a volcanic eruption in Ice∣land, in 1783, by which it appears that the atmosphere is ren∣dered pestilential by discharges of fire and lava from the earth. This effect is supposed to be wrought by a combination of the septous and oxygenous parts, and may confirm and improve Dr. Mitchill's theory of pestilential air.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="036687_0371_100AA38AF956F098"/>This eruption I understand to have been a bursting of fire from the earth, in a place distant from Heckla. In the neighbor∣hood of the column of flame were generated snow, hail and ex∣treme cold. The water that fell in rain was acid and corrosive; destroying cattle and men—covering the bodies of cattle with pustles and ulcers, and excoriating th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hands and faces of men when it fell on them. It also killed vegetables. The effects were felt not only in Iceland, but in Norway, and other parts of Europe.</P>
<P>Had this treatise fallen into my hands some months ago, I might have been able to illustrate particular parts of my theory by authentic facts, taken from that work. As it is, I must content myself with observing, that Mr. Holm's observations verify my ideas, respecting the agency of electricity in producing pestilence, and extremes in the seasons. On this theory not only pestilence, but severe cold, and extreme heat, hail and snow are all familiar∣ly explained, and their connection with volcanic eruptions, and other electrical operations, visible and invisible, demonstrated.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XI. Pestilential periods exhibited by means of an increase of mortality in distant parts of the world.</HEAD>
<P>AS there are certain periods when particular epidemics pre∣vail over the world or over a hemisphere, and when all other diseases assume peculiar malignancy, I have here subjoined a num∣ber of bills of mortality, for different and distant places, to show the effect of the general principle of disease in remote countries or towns.—Some of these periods appear in the foregoing tables, as that between 1623 and 1627; and between 1631 and 1637.—</P>

<P>It is probable the mortality in the northern states of America was every where in that proportion. The same disease made similar ravages between 1749 and 1753—in 1759—1765 and 6 —in some places in 1769.—It was remarkably mortal in 1773. This latter year was in America unhealthy. In Salem, Mass. the bill of 1773, was raised to 208, (double the usual amount) by the dysentery. The bill for St. Petersburgh in Russia, was swel∣led in 1773, one fifth, and in 1777, one fourth.</P>
<P>The last epidemic period, save one, was from 1781 to 1787 inclusive. The diseases were influenza, measles and scarlatina. These were in general lighter than usual. In the interior of New-York state, Vermont Massachusetts and New-Hampshire, the scarlatina was more severe and mortal; but on the sea board and especially in Connecticut, it was milder, and many places wholly escaped it. Yet every where the bills of mortality were swelled in 1783, 4, 5 or 6, when the plague was raging in the Levant and Egypt. This period was closed by remarkably cool summers, and no dysentery or pestilential fever of any considerable violence or extent, succeeded.</P>

<P>Let it be noted that the effect of the scarlatina was here in 1795 and '96. The progress of the disease is distinctly marked to be from New-York eastward, from 1793 to 1796. The scarlatina in 1785 and 6, was most severe in Massachusetts—that in 1794, in Connecticut. The bills in Boston for 1792 were swelled by the small-pox by inoculation, which is not to be taken into this account of epidemics. The year selected was rather unfavorable, as the condition of the atmosphere was inflammatory, and incli∣ned to produce eruptive complaints. The scarlatina was then making its appearance in the middle states. The spring of 1793, when inoculation was begun at Hartford, was still more unfa∣vorable; and the small-pox was so unmanageable as to surprise the faculty. The principles unfolded in this treatise will solve the difficulty.</P>
<P>By a bill of mortality for Madeira, it appears that the pestilen∣tial principle of the years from 1760 to 6<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> extended to that healthy island.</P>

<P><PB N="26" REF="036687_0381_100AA3A4B8D33DC0"/>From the bills of mortality and preceding history may be de∣duced some interesting observations.</P>
<P N="1">1. We observe an order and progression in the epidemics, which is in a degree uniform. Periods of pestilence, with some exceptions, seem to be introduced by measles and influenza; then follow diseases of the throat, or anginas; lastly pestilential fevers. During the whole period, the measles, influenza and angina, occa∣sionally appear in spring, autumn and winter; and rarely, if ever, does a pestilential fever, as plague and yellow fever, occur in a particular city or country, without influenza, angina, measles or inflammatory fevers in the spring preceding, for immediate pre∣cursors. This is true in the tropical climates, in cases of epidem∣ics; and so uniform has been the fact in the temperate latitudes, that I am nearly prepared to say, that if none of those precursors appear in winter and spring, no pestilential fever will be epidemic in the following summer and autumn, unless the dysentery may be excepted. It holds true in every case of <HI>great</HI> pestilence.</P>
<P N="2">2. The progressiveness in the pestilential principle is obvious in the augmented bills of mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ality, which immediately precede the plague. This arises from the number and violence of the ma∣lignant diseases which always precede an epidemic pestilence. This augmentation is visible some times two years before the plague appears, and almost always in the spring months preceding. See the London bills in the years preceding the plague in 1625 —1636—1665 The same is observable in other bills, both in Europe and America. In a few instances, the bill of the prece∣ding year is low; but in this case, some other epidemic has usually gone before, and finished its course; or the plague is preceded by influenza only, which does not swell the bill of mortality.</P>
<P N="3">3. Sometimes a series of epidemics falls with more violence on one hemisphere than on the other; but perhaps in no instance has a course of diseases spread over one continent, without show∣ing themselves on the other. I have not been able to find an in∣stance in which the plague has made great ravages in the east, ex∣cept when the American continent has been more or less affected by the epidemics above mentioned; and in some instances it is proved that the violence of the sore-throat, influenza, measles or
<PB N="27" REF="036687_0382_100B2C64FB5A0BC8"/>
yellow fever, in America, has corresponded with the violence of pestilence in Egypt and the Levant. The commencement of each period of epidemics is nearly cotemporary, in both hemis∣pheres.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It sometimes happens that pestilence occurs in Constantinople, Smyrna or Cairo, when it is not epidemic beyond those cities; owing to peculiar seasons and local causes. But it never spreads to Syria, the islands of the Archipelago, and other neighboring countries, except when epidemic diseases spread over the world. At least I have not found an instance.</NOTE></P>
<P>Thus the great plague in Constantinople was cotemporary with the fatal angina and dysentery in America in 1751—also in 1755. Cotemporary with the measles in America in 1758 and 9, was the commencement of the extensive Levant plague of 1760. Pes∣tilence in Persia was cotemporary with the epidemics of 1773— In 1783 commenced plague in the east and epidemics in America —the same in 1792 and 3. Diseases of the throat in almost every instance prevail at the same time in Europe and America.</P>
<P N="4">4. In two periods within half a century, a severe angina and dysentery have been epidemic together and once for a series of years, as in 1751, and from 1773 to 1777. This is an excep∣tion to the usual order, and other deviations sometimes occur.</P>
<P N="5">5. As catarrh precedes, so it follows every severe epidemic pestilence, and the persons who have been affected with a pesti∣lential fever in summer, are most apt to be affected by catarrh at the commencement of cold weather.</P>
<P N="6">6. After severe pestilential fevers in summer, the inflammatory fevers of winter, wear the livery of the summer fevers. They generally carry with them bilious discharges, and a yellow skin. They have also this remarkable character, that they speedily run through the inflammatory diathesis, and become typhus. They are the <HI>pestilence of winter</HI>; and sometimes appear <HI>before</HI> the pes∣tilence of summer. This fact alone decides the question, that pestilential fevers of summer are generated on the spot where they exist; and derive their malignant and infectious quality sole∣ly from the state of the elements.</P>
<P>This species of inflammatory fever has occurred in many cases during the winter months, since the year 1790. In some cases it has extinguished three four and five members of a family; as
<PB N="28" REF="036687_0383_100AA3A64536FDD0"/>
in Hartford and New-Haven. But it is a most consoling reflec∣tion, that it is less frequent than formerly in this country. It has not been epidemic in the northern states since <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>61, as far as I can learn. Formerly it was as frightful a calamity as the yellow fever is in this age. In the foregoing history, many examples have been mentioned—as at Fairfield in 1698—at Waterbury in 1713—at Hartford and Duck Creek in 1720—at Farmington in 1729—at Bethlem, Hartford, East-Haven and New-Haven in 1761—at Holliston in 1753, &amp;c. Whether the disappear∣ance of this disease is owing to the clearing of the country, by which the quantity of debilitating miàsmata of summer has been diminished, or whether it is the consequence of other alterations in our climate, is not easily determined.</P>
<P>The disappearance of the Long Fever, so called, is another most consoling circumstance. This species of typhus fever was formerly one of the most terrible diseases of our climate. At present i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is a rare occurrence.</P>
<P>On the whole, we have very clear proof that the <HI>quantity of disease</HI> in this country, has been diminished, within half a century. The yellow fever, that is, the pestilential fever of summer and autumn, was formerly as frequent and as malignant as in this age; while the inflammatory fevers of winter, and the long fever, have almost disappeared as epidemics. The intermittents and remit∣tents of autumn, are greatly decreased in the northern states; and the dysentery has not increased in frequency or virulence. Anginas have never been so fatal as they were between 1735 and 1743.</P>
<P>It is probable that some of these changes in the character of diseases may be ascribed to alterations in our climate, or modes of living—and therefore may be permanent. In some cases, im∣provements in medical science and the practice of physic may have disarmed diseases of their terrors. But it is possible that some of the changes mentioned are only revolutions in disease, occasioned by temporary causes, and that the same disorders may, in future periods, recur, with the whole train of formidable symp∣toms.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="036687_0384_100AA3A8AABA3B80"/><HI>Note.</HI>—It has been observed that the <HI>long fever,</HI> so called, has nearly disappeared from our climate. On further enquiry, it appears that this observation must be restricted to the maritime states. The bilious remitting fever that prevailed in Vermont and New-Hampshire in 1798, and which has re-appeared in this summer (1799) is of that species. See Medical Repository, vol. 3. 5. In the <HI>interior</HI> of our country, this is a new disease; while on the sea-coast it has become extinct. Shall we conclude from these facts, that the disease follows or springs from a par∣ticular state of cultivation? In the interior, where the disease is now prevalent, the clearing and cultivation of the country were begun about 30 years ago. On the sea-coast, where the disease has disappeared, the country has been settled 150 years, and is generally under cultivation.</P>

</TABLE></P>
<P>The accounts of the seasons are mostly from English writers, and refer to England, with some exceptions. In regard to heat and cold, the seasons are generally uniform in most countries, on the same continent; but not in regard to drouth and moisture.</P>
<P>Of these forty-four instances of influenza, it may be observed, from the preceding history.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="33" REF="036687_0388_100AA3B49FE44A98"/>1. That most of them happened, after or during severe cold, or during moist weather, and in spring, winter or autumn. Some however, occurred in dry hot seasons, and others in mild winters.</P>
<P N="2">2. Nineteen instances occurred in years when there was a vol∣canic eruption in Italy or Iceland, and eleven others, though in different years, were within a few months of eruptions; making 30 out of the 44. Two or three others happened near the time of volcanic discharges in South-America.</P>
<P N="3">3. Almost all happened in years of earthquakes, or within a few months preceding or following them.</P>
<P N="4">4. Thirty instances occurred within the year, or a few months preceding or following the appearance of comets.</P>
<P>It is further to be observed that some of these epidemics have been limited to the American hemisphere, at the distance of three, four or five years from an epidemic of the same kind in Europe. Such as those of 1647—1655—which coincide in time with violent earthquakes in South-America.</P>
<P>In other instances this disease spread over the whole globe; usually beginning in America: That is, in the instances of which I can obtain any correct information. Thus in four instances, viz. in 1698, 1757, 1761 and 1781, it spread over the Ameri∣can hemisphere one year prior to its pervading the other hemis∣phere. And the universal catarrh of 1733, which encircled the globe, commenced in America two months before it appeared in Europe. The epidemic of 1782 invaded Europe from the side of Asia, the year after it appeared in America. In 1788, the influenza in Europe <HI>preceded</HI> the same disease in America.</P>
<P>I regret my want of materials to complete a view of this sub∣ject. No regular register has been kept in America, of the sea∣sons, diseases and phenomena, from the first settlement, and whe∣ther any notices of all the catarrhs in this country, are in exis∣tence, I do not know. I have found no account of any, between 1655 and 1698—nor between the latter year and 1733. One of these instances, that in 1698, came to my knowledge by acci∣dent, as I have mentioned under that year, in the foregoing his∣tory. From the uniform appearance of this epidemic as often as
<PB N="34" REF="036687_0389_100AA3B255B39290"/>
once in ten or twelve years, in other periods, we have ground to believe, it has always occurred in nearly the same periods.</P>
<P>This epidemic is evidently the effect of some insensible qualities of the atmosphere; as it spreads with astonishing rapidity over land and sea, uncontrolled by heat or cold, drouth or moisture. From these circumstances and its near coincidence in time with the violent action of fire in earthquakes and volcanoes, there is reason to conclude the disease to be the effect of some access of stimulant powers to the atmosphere by means of the electrical principle. No other principle in creation, which has yet come under the cognizance of the human mind, seems adequate to the same effects. I do not consider earthquakes and volcanic erup∣tions as the <HI>causes</HI> of this epidemic, but as effects of the common cause and evidences of its existence.</P>
<P>The courses of this epidemic are very various. That in 1510 proceeded from Africa to Sicily, Italy and the north of Europe. This disease could not be the effect of the eruption in Iceland; for it appeared first in southern latitudes. If there was a volcanic discharge about that time in Africa, we might be inclined to as∣cribe the disease to that cause; but it is more probable that it is to be ascribed to an insensible action of atmospheric fire,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I use this word to express the principle manifested in electrical operations, although this is usually supposed to be a cold fusion. Of the nature of this principle, we know little. We see only its effects.</NOTE> which is more general and violent, about the time of eruptions; and which fire is probably agitated in all parts of the globe, although it produces visible effects in explosions, in some particular places only. I think no man can question the fact, after reading the preceding history.</P>
<P>The course of the epidemic in 1551, I am not able to ascer∣tain; nor that in 1557. This invaded Spain in August.</P>
<P>The severe catarrh of 1580 began in the south of Europe, in the heat of summer, and proceeded to the north. The season in general was temperate.</P>
<P>From that year to 1708—9, I find no account of the course of the epidemic catarrh; but that in 1708—9, began in the north of Europe and proceeded to the south.</P>
<P>The epidemic of 1729—30, proceeded from Poland and Si∣lesia,
<PB N="35" REF="036687_0390_100AA3B71FEC12C8"/>
to the west and south, and ended about the time of an explo∣sion from Vesuvius.</P>
<P>The universal influenza of 1733, began in America in the au∣tumn of 1732. It appeared in Europe in December. That of 1788 appeared in April, May, June and August, in different places.</P>
<P>The epidemic in America in 1789, began in the middle states, and spread southward and eastward. In 1790, it began in about the same longitude, but in the interior country, and spread east∣ward and southward.</P>
<P>The influenza of 1782 in Europe, came from Asia. Possibly it might have travelled from America, across the Pacific to Chi∣na and Kamschatka; as it was epidemic in America in 1781.</P>
<P>This is all I am able to discover of the origin and direction of this singular epidemic. It is greatly to be desired, that we might learn precisely the dates of its appearance, the place, the direction of its progress, in all cases, and compare these circumstances with the extraordinary agitations of the elements, which occur about the same time. But for this purpose my materials are incomplete.</P>
<P>It is observable, however, that the influenza is closely allied to the measles. Sometimes the symptoms are combined in the same attack, and rarely does one disease become epidemic, except just before or after the other. This proves their alliance: indeed I consider them as different modifications of the same epidemic.</P>
<P>Catarrh is also closely connected with pestilential fevers, and sometimes this is true of the measles. It is rare indeed that epi∣demic plague and yellow fever do not begin and end in catarrhal affections—that is, catarrh precedes in spring, and follows in au∣tumn. Sometimes pestilence is preceded and followed by mea∣sles and angina.</P>
<P>Every epidemic constitution seems to commence with measles or influenza. To these succeed angina, in some of its various forms, which are all the offspring of the same parent. Then fol∣low pestilential fevers, in the form of dysentery, yellow fever and plague. Whenever the epidemic constitution is manifested by measles, influenza and affections of the throat, common diseases,
<PB N="36" REF="036687_0391_100AA3B947883CE8"/>
even in places apparently healthy, become more malignant, and sporadic cases of pestilential fever occur in almost every situation.</P>
<P>These facts are curious, and without attending to them, the philosophy of epidemics cannot be understood.</P>
<P>P. S. After writing the foregoing history, I was able to ascer∣tain further particulars of a severe influenza in America in 1737. Warren, on the yellow fever, mentions this catarrh in Barbadoes in the winter preceding the bilious plague in that island in 1738. I have now learnt from two elderly gentlemen, who were then arrived to adult years, that in November 1737, this epidemic in∣vaded all parts of the country, so suddenly and severely that neighbors could not visit each other, and that there were scarce∣ly people in health to perform the ordinary domestic labors neces∣sary to support life.</P>
<P>If my informants are correct as to the time, this epidemic inva∣ded Europe and America in the <HI>same month</HI>—the only instance that I have found; and an exception to the foregoing remarks. It will be observed also that this instance coincides with an erup∣tion of Vesuvius, and the most tremendous tempest in the East-Indies ever known. Let it be noted also, that this catarrh was the <HI>immediate precursor</HI> of the most fatal pestilential fever in the West-Indies, and one that nearly depopulated Mexico. The catarrh commenced with or a little before a most severe winter.</P>
<P>It is remarkable that the extent and violence of this distem∣per mark exactly the severity of the pestilential fevers which pre∣cede and follow it. The two epidemic catarrhs of 1733 and 37, invaded the whole globe in the same year. They were very severe, and so were the anginas and plagues of this period; far beyond what has occurred at any other time, during this centu∣ry, until the last period.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XIII. Of the order, connection and progression of pestilential epidemics.</HEAD>
<P>IN the early periods of the world, little notice appears to have been taken of a connection between epidemic diseases; nor have modern writers supplied this defect in the history of medicin. Hippocrates and Sydenham seem to have been aware of such a connection, and the latter author has laid broad and firm foun∣dation for a complete system of truth, on the subject of epidem∣ics. His observations were confined to the city of London. Had he extended his view to all parts of Europe, and general∣ized his observations, he would have found a multitude of facts to justify his theory, and probably would have raised it above the reach of that obloquy and ridicule, which succeeding professors of physic, of less genius and learning, have c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t on his occult qualities of air.</P>
<P>Indeed, it is surprising that medical men have not pursued the ideas suggested by these great fathers of their science. Hippo∣crates led the way, unlocking the great doctrin of a constitution or state of the atmosphere, calculated to produce particular epi∣demic diseases; a doctrin which Sydenham has pursued with wonderful success. Any man who reads the history of diseases, must see that certain species of them appear nearly together in time and place. The order in which they appear, may not be exactly the same at all times, and in all countries; but they oc∣cur so nearly together, as evidently to prove their alliance, and their dependence on the same general causes.</P>
<P>All popular diseases must have, for their causes, some princi∣ples as extensive as the effects. These causes most probably exist in the elements, fire, air and water; for we know of no other medium by which diseases can be communicated to whole com∣munities of people▪</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="036687_0393_100AA3BE16D17DE0"/>Bad food indeed is a fruitful source of diseases; but this must always proceed from the qualities of the elements which enter into its composition. A defect therefore in the nourishing powers of food, is a consequence of a defect or superabundance in the elements, or in their combination in animal and vegetable produc∣tions. It may be considered as a disease in the animal and veg∣etable kingdom, which most probably proceeds from the same causes, as epidemic distempers among mankind.</P>
<P>The principal epidemic distempers which invade mankind, are, catarrh or influenza, measles, whooping or chin cough, the dif∣ferent species of angina, small pox, bilious fevers, petechial fe∣ver, dysentery, plague. Of these, catarrh is the most decided∣ly an epidemic dependent wholly on a particular state of atmos∣phere. Cullen calls it "catarrh from contagion," to distinguish it from sporadic cases of the same disease; but, after careful ob∣servation, during the progress of it in the United States in 1789, and again in 1790, I am confident the progress of the disease de∣pends very little on a communication from person to person. It has been doubted whether it is an infectious disease; and I have some evidence to prove it not so; but certain it is, that its sud∣den invasion of whole families, whole towns and even whole countries, and the rapidity of its progress over sea and land, ab∣solutely preclude the supposition of its dependence on specific contagion.</P>
<P>The other diseases above enumerated may arise from both cau∣ses—infection and a peculiar state of air. Some of them de∣pend mostly on a constitution of air, fitted to produce them; others are seldom produced without a connection with diseased persons. It is however proper to observe that the small-pox, dys∣entery and plague are not usually, and in strictness of language, <HI>epidemic</HI> diseases. They seldom invade whole countries. They are more properly <HI>endemic;</HI> yet this epithet is not strictly appli∣cable to them; being used more properly to denote a disease which is <HI>peculiar</HI> to a particular place, whereas those diseases may invade any place on the globe. The elephantiosis is an <HI>endemic</HI> in Egypt and certain other places in warm climates; the small-pox, dysentery and plague usually appear in cities, camps, or
<PB N="39" REF="036687_0394_100AA3C0B9CFF128"/>
other unhealthy situations, without affecting neighboring places, which contain not the same local causes of disease. They might therefore, in strict propriety, be denominated <HI>temporary endemics,</HI> in opposition to <HI>epidemics</HI> which spread to all places alike; and to <HI>endemics,</HI> which <HI>constantly</HI> or <HI>usually</HI> appear in particular parts of the world.</P>
<P>This distinction however is not very material; and I shall therefore speak of the small-pox, dysentery and plague, as epi∣demic diseases; meaning by this epithet, that they, at certain times, spread generally over a particular town or region.</P>
<P>The nature and kinds of contagion will be more particularly considered, in a subsequent section; the present subject, is, the order, connection, and progression observable in pestilential epi∣demics.</P>
<P>The influence of a certain state of air in generating epidemics was observed by Hippocrates, who has described the prevalent diseases, in different seasons. In his second section on epidem∣ics, he describes what he calls "Katastasis loimodes," a pesti∣lential state of the air or seasons. He does not indeed in this passage mention the <HI>plague,</HI> but he speaks of those malignant dis∣eases which are, in modern times, the precursors of the plague, and which are now produced by the state of weather which he describes.</P>
<P>This state of the seasons he represents thus, "The year was austrinus, remarkable for southerly breezes, rainy and without winds. The first part of the year dry, and autumn rainy, with southerly winds, humid and cloudy. In winter, southerly winds, moist and mild weather. About the vernal equinox, se∣vere cold, but the north winds, with snow, were of no long du∣ration. Spring was again calm, southerly weather—great rains continued till August—then clear hot weather—the cool Elesian winds blew but little and for short periods. A rainy autumn, with north winds."</P>
<P>The southerly, hot, humid air here described, whenever of long continuance in summer, proves the cause of numerous ma∣lignant diseases, in the United States, as well as in Europe, al∣tho not certainly productive of pestilence.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="036687_0395_100AA3C32667FC48"/>Hippocrates proceeds to mention the diseases which prevailed in this state of seasons. "Before spring, even during the cold weather, appeared many erysipelous diseases of a malignant type. Diseases of the fauces, accompanied with hourseness, ardent fe∣vers, with phrenitis; ulcers in the mouth; inflammation of eyes, carbuncles, &amp;c. These diseases spread and became epidemic and mortal." The author then proceeds to describe the erys<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pelas and other diseases here named. These cases differ from the plague in Athens; and prove that the pestilence in Thasus, where he wrote, was of milder symptoms, though probably cotemporary with that epidemic in Athens.</P>
<P>My particular reason for reciting these passages from Hippoc∣rates, is, to prove a progressiveness in a pestilential state of air, and the diseases which it produces. The diseases here mention∣ed are the same, substantially, as those which <HI>precede</HI> the plague in modern times, in the countries bordering on the Mediterra∣nean, and with little variation, the same with those which pre∣cede the plague in all parts of the world. Erysipelous, or other eruptive diseases, catarrhous affections, or ardent fevers, are the constant precursors of the plague, wherever it appears. Hip∣pocrates does not mention any fatal plague, in the state of air described; and it often happens, at this day, that the strength of the pestilential principle is arrested in its progress, and the ep∣idemics are limited, in their violence, to diseases of a type less malignant than the true plague, or arising to the plague only in a few scattering cases. But whatever may be the degree of the pestilential state of the air, or at whatever point, it may be des∣tined to cease, and yield to a more salubrious constitution, the class of diseases which mark its rise and progress, are always simi∣lar, or the same, modified only in the violence of their symptoms, by accidental circumstances.</P>
<P>A careful attention to these facts, cannot fail to convince the observer of the justness of Sydenham's doctrines, in regard to constitutions of air; and the facts themselves demolish, at one stroke, all the common medical doctrines of the communication of pestilence from place to place by contagion, or fomites.</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the histories of ancient plagues furnish but
<PB N="41" REF="036687_0396_100AA3C5E5578A30"/>
little light on this subject; yet the barren annals of antiquity and the middle ages, are not wholly destitute of evidence to this point. The progression of the plague in Rome, growing more general and fatal to the second and third year, is a fact re∣corded by Livy, and is related in the preceding pages.</P>
<P>The remark of Dion Cassius, that the ashes from Vesuvius, in the great eruption of 79, produced, that year, only slight diseases, but the next year, an epidemic, has already been no∣ticed. It leaves no room to question, that the destructive plague of the year 80, was preceded by epidemic disorders of a less ma∣lignant type.</P>
<P>The middle ages furnish facts in confirmation of this doctrin. Witness the great plague in 1112, which was preceded by ery∣sipelous diseases in England in 1109, and great mortality in 1111. The plague of 1242, which was preceded by great mortality in 12<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0—the same fact is observable in the pestilence of 1252, 1368, 1379, 1390, 1517, 1527, 1575, 1636—and in many other instances.</P>
<P>This fact did not escape the notice of that accurate observer of nature, Lord Bacon, who lived at a period when the plague frequently infested England. He says, "The lesser infections of the small-pox, purple fever, agues, &amp;c. in the preceding sum∣mer, and hovering all the winter, <HI>portend a great pestilence the fol∣lowing summer,</HI> for putrefaction rises not to its height at once." Works, vol. 3, p. 59.</P>
<P>That state of air which produces pestilential diseases, Lord Bacon denominates <HI>putrefaction;</HI> but whatever appellation we may give to the <HI>cause</HI> of pestilence, the remark is demonstrably well founded, that this "rises not to its height at once." It is progressive; producing first the "lesser infections." The plague is rarely, if ever, an original, distinct, isolated disease; but the last or most mortal form of a series of malignant distempers. The <HI>purple</HI> fever mentioned by Lord Bacon is nearly allied to the <HI>petechial</HI> fever, which is the usual precursor of pestilence in the Levant.</P>
<P>The universal plague of 1635, 6 and 7, was preceded by the
<PB N="42" REF="036687_0397_100AA3C78DC9FBC8"/>
usual diseases, and the progress of them is distinctly traced by the learned Diemerbroeck. He remarks, chap. 3 de peste, that "the spring of 1635, was warm and moderately humid, to which succeeded a very hot, dry season, in which appeared many ma∣lignant epidemics. In the first place, a severe plague broke out at Leyden, and destroyed more than 20,000 lives. At Ni∣meguen, in Gueldres and other regions, a certain pestilent fe∣ver spread with dreadful mortality. In autumn, the severe heat still continuing with excessive drouth, many other malignant dis∣eases appeared, as small-pox, measles, diarrhea and dysentery of a very bad type; but above all, the above mentioned pestilential purple fever, called in Italy <HI>petechial,</HI> increased daily in extent and violence, <HI>until it turned into the true plague</HI>—"donec tandem in apertissimam pestem transiret."—The author goes on to remark that from November through the winter, scattering cases of plague occurred in Nimeguen. In January 1636, it increased, and in March spread and became epidemic—rose to its height in April, and continued till October. See pages 5 and 6.</P>
<P>This passage contains a number of important facts. First—the seasons were insalubrious. Secondly—the pestilential state of air extended to many places at the same time: In another page, the author says the pestilence spread over almost all Germany and the low countries. Thrdly—this state of air was of different de∣grees of malignity or violence, in different places at the same time. Thus, the plague appeared at Leyden early in 1635, but cotemporary with this, was the appearance of the purple fever in Nimeguen and in other places; and during the summer and au∣tumn, this and other epidemics continued to rage with great mor∣tality, and at last, the strength of the pestilential principle increa∣sing, the fever changed its form, and appeared in the true plague.</P>
<P>Now, the modern way of accounting for the plague in Nime∣guen, would be to <HI>allege</HI> or <HI>suppose</HI> some infected goods to have conveyed the contagion from Leyden, where it first appeared; and then to <HI>suppose</HI> the infection to be carried to Leyden from the Levant.</P>
<P>The philosophic Diemerbroeck, who was present and observed all the circumstances, <HI>supposes</HI> nothing. He relates plain facts
<PB N="43" REF="036687_0398_100AA3CA4F408698"/>
just as they occurred, and admits that the plague must have ori∣ginated in the country.</P>
<P>By considering the malignant epidemics that prevailed at that time, as connected and depending on the same general cause, we solve all the difficulties attending the origin of the plague. The petechial fever, which appeared at Nimeguen and other places, in 1635, was <HI>one of the forms</HI> in which the general contagion of the period, exhibited its effects on the human constitution. It was a <HI>part</HI> of the pestilence—it could not be conveyed from Ley∣den, for it appeared in most parts of the low countries and in Ger∣many, at the same time. The same general cause, an indisposi∣tion in the elements to support healthy life, produced various pes∣tilential diseases, according to place, season, age, habit of body and constitution, until its strength and violence arose to their height, and gradually introduced the worst form of pestilence.</P>
<P>The idea of Diemerbroeck, that the purple fever "turned to the plague," must give great offence to the followers of Mead and Cullen, the advocates for the doctrin of the propagation of the plague solely by specific contagion. It opposes efficaciously their whole theory, and levels it with the earth.</P>
<P>The fact is however indisputable. In the distressing period from 1569 to 1577, when Europe was almost depopulated by the spotted fever, physicians observed that this disease frequently turned into the plague, and the plague into the spotted fever. The same fact was often noticed by writers of the 16th and 17th cen∣turies, in which the plague frequently overran Europe.—These two diseases, are therefore two distinct forms or modifications of pestilence—probably bearing an affinity to each other, like that between the distinct and confluent small-pox. This fact shows that the distinction made by medical writers, between <HI>pestis</HI> and <HI>pestilentia,</HI> the plague and other pestilential distempers, however useful in practice, is not authorized by truth and philosophy. The ancients classed all contagious epidemics together, and de∣nominated them <HI>pestilence;</HI> and this distribution, in regard to their causes and origin, was doubtless most philosophical. The distri∣bution made by modern physicians, seems to have arisen out of differences of symptoms, and to be best adapted to practice. At
<PB N="44" REF="036687_0399_100AA3CD70EFFFF8"/>
the same time, it has probably been the occasion of the common error of considering different species or forms of pestilence, as diseases of generical difference, and proceeding wholly from dis∣tinct causes, when in fact they all have <HI>one general cause</HI> in com∣mon, and the varieties of their symptoms proceed from <HI>distinct lo∣cal</HI> and <HI>temporary causes.</HI></P>
<P>On this subject the learned Riverius, in his Praxeos Medicae, lib. 17. has many judicious remarks. He observes, "That authors, who wrote on fevers, distinguish a pestilent from a ma∣lignant fever—by pestilent fever they understand the true plague; by a malignant one, the fever vulgarly called <HI>purple,</HI> or other fe∣ver, which tho epidemic and contagious, is less dangerous, and in which more patients survive than perish—whereas the essence of the true plague consists in this, that it destroys more than half who are seized with it." He however considers these fevers as differing mostly in degree of malignity, and therefore treats of them under one head.</P>
<P>A pestilent fever this author considers as not proceeding solely from intemperate heat, or putridity; but from a malignant and poisonous quality; and whenever this quality appears in a fever, whether quotidian, hectic or putrid, he thinks it ought to be de∣nominated <HI>pestilent.</HI> A pestilent fever differs from the plague as species from genus because there may be plague without fever.</P>
<P>This author remarks also the connection between certain epi∣demics. "Many deadly diseases accompany the prevalence of pestilence—as phrenitis, anginas, pleurisies, peripneumonies, in∣flamations of the liver, dysenteries and many others." He as∣cribes epidemics to the state of air, as a common cause, to which he adds the usual local or particular causes, which modify its in∣fluence.</P>
<P>Prosper Alpinus informs us that these diseases prevail also in Egypt, at certain times; but he gives no account of their order or connection. Vol. 2. p. 73.</P>
<P>Bellinus describes the phenomena which precede the plague, which he calls its <HI>antecedents.</HI> After mentioning food of a bad quality, impure air from exhalations, intemperate seasons, va∣pours emitted during earthquakes and the like, he says, "Mox
<PB N="45" REF="036687_0400_100AA3CF9CC0EE70"/>
terraemotu Achaia universa commota est, et duae tunc civitates, Bura et Helice, abruptis locorum devoratae."</P>
<BIBL>Muratori, Gen. Hist. vol. 1. 7.</BIBL>
<P>Other authors refer this catastrophe to the period of pestilence last mentioned, which some writers place in the year of Rome 388, and others, in 384; but all agree that it was during the approximation of a comet. This last pestilence was dreadful in the extreme, sparing no age or sex. The year after it, the earth opened and exhibited a vast chasm in the midst of Rome, into which M. Curtius precipitated himself for the salvation and prosperity of the city.</P>
<BIBL>Livy, b. 7. 7.</BIBL>
<P>P. Orosius and P. Diaconus, followed by Muratori, place the commencement of this plague in the year of Rome 384. Orosius says that "in the 103d and 105th Olympiad, Italy was shaken a whole year, by tremendous earthquakes. The hundred and third Olympiad, according to our common chro∣nology, comprehends the years of Rome from 386 to 389, in∣clusive. It is probable that in one of the shocks of this series of earthquakes, the chasm was made in Rome as already related. It will be observed that this event <HI>followed</HI> the pestilence.</P>
<P>The comet that appeared, during this calamity, was probably that mentioned by Aristotle, Meteorol. lib. 1. ca. 6, of which he was an eye-witness.</P>
<P>But I must not omit what authors relate concerning the pe∣culiar character of this plague. Orosius says, it was not such a pestilence, as usually proceeded from irregular seasons, extreme drouth, sudden heat of the spring, unseasonable moisture of sum∣mer and autumn, or the impure air blown from the Calabrian groves; but severe and continued, attacking all descriptions of people, and either destroying their lives, or leaving them in a weak and miserable condition.</P>
<P>The winter when the comet appeared Aristotle relates to have been cold; but the severity and duration of the plague cannot be accounted for on the principle of changes or irregularities in the seasons. It was one of those violent epidemics which never afflict mankind, without some essential alteration in the invisible
<PB N="46" REF="036687_0401_100AA40D9A1A9630"/>
began to appear, six months before the arrival of the infection from Syria!</P>
<P>In Aleppo, the plague which appeared in 1742, was <HI>preceded</HI> by an acute fever; and after the disease abated in July, appeared diarrheas and dysentery of a malignant type, attended in many cases with petechae, and intermittents which often proved fatal. These diseases, in their acute forms, prevailed also with the plague, which in this year was not severe, nor wholly the predominant epidemic.</P>
<P>This continued acute fever and pleurisies, ran through the win∣ter. In November appeared a few cases of the plague. Where the <HI>infection</HI> had lain dormant from July to November, the author of this account, Alexander Russell, has not informed us.</P>
<P>In the spring of 1743, the plague again appeared and spread in the city, and at the usual time in summer subsided, being again succeeded by other acute disorders, which by bleeding and pur∣ging, were formed into tertians, double tertians and quotidians.</P>
<P>Here again we have the same progression in the state of the pestilence, which had been remarked by Hippocrates, Bacon and Sydenham. During the existence of this pestilential constitu∣tion in Aleppo, all the ordinary diseases of the country assumed a more malignant type; or as Sydenham remarked of the dis∣eases which preceded the plague of 1665, they "differed from the same diseases in other years, by new and unusual symptoms, which in short amounted to this, that they were all <HI>more violent.</HI>" See vol. 1, p. 20.</P>
<P>The diseases changed their form with the seasons—the acute fever preceding ran into plague, and plague ran into malignant dysentery, tertians, and other acute distempers.</P>
<P>Similar facts are observed in America. The plague has been preceded by acute diseases, as anginas, remittents of a bad type, &amp;c. and followed by remittents, dysentery and malignant pleurisy.</P>
<P>The dreadful plague at Messina in 1743, which destroyed two thirds of its inhabitants, was introduced by a malignant fever. One physician alone out of thirty-three, pronounced it the plague; the others denied it, because the disease was not attended with glandular swellings.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="036687_0402_100AA3D1D7B198F8"/>A similar fever preceded the severe plague at Venice in 1576, and the same uncertainty at first embarrassed the physicians and magistracy.</P>
<P>The terrible pestilence at Naples in 1656, was announced by the usual herald of the disease, a malignant fever. One physi∣cian alone pronounced it the plague, and for his audacity was im∣prisoned by the Viceroy.</P>
<P>The extensive pestilence which spread over all the Levant countries and islands, from 1759 to 1763, was every where pre∣ceded by a similar increase of malignant diseases, and especially by the petechial fever, which appeared, at Aleppo, in the year next previous to the plague. Yet the author of this account, Patrick Russel, labors very gravely to trace the disease to Turks from Egypt and their old clothes.</P>
<P>The uncertainty among physicians, at the commencement of a plague, with respect to the nature of the disorder, is a strong proof of the doctrin for which I contend. Van Helmont, Diemer∣broeck and others have found it necessary to lay down rules with a great degree of care and caution, to enable themselves to de∣termin, whether a malignant disease is the plague or not. Van Helmont observes, p. 1138 that he could perceive no difference in the pulse, in plague and continual fevers of the malignant kind —that buboes in the groin, paroitides, &amp;c. are not unfrequently found in fevers free from plague; and sometimes spots and car∣buncles. But, says he, if many of these appearances do concur, there is no difficulty in pronouncing it the plague, especially if they appear before or early after the fever.</P>
<P>Diemerbroeck declares, that no one symptom determines a disease to be the plague—neither fever, buboes nor carbuncles are essential to that disease, for it often passes off without either— many of its symptoms are common to that and other distempers— the existence of the disease therefore is to be determined by a view of all the circumstances, and one criterion, he remarks, is, the prevalence of the plague in neighboring towns.</P>
<P>This last remark indicates that the author had observed the existence of pestilence in various places at the same time, to be a common event.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="036687_0403_100AA40FCB567F10"/>The difficulty at first in ascertaining the existence of the plague, proceeds wholly from the progression in the series of dis∣eases—the malignant fevers, preceding gradually incr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asing in violence, and changing their form.</P>
<P>It has been the same in the United States. The first cases of the bilious plague have occured early in summer, usually in July, sometimes in June. These have not excited much alarm, for they have not usually prov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fectious; and they have theref<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e been classed among the ordinary diseases of the hot season. This however has ever been a mistake; they were the less malignant forms of approaching pestilence; yet five or six weeks after their appearance, when the epidemic has showed itself in its formidable array, our citizents have hunted out some vessel from southern climates and palmed the evil on her seamen or cargo.</P>
<P>Van Swieten, Comment. vol. 16, 3. remarks, "that the plague has sometimes lain concealed under the mask of other dis∣eases. When the plague raged at Vienna in 1713, it frequently assumed the appearance of a pleurisy, catarrh, or quinsy, but soon after, broke out buboes and carbuncles, most certain signs of the plague, accompanied with the usual symptoms."</P>
<P>Here we observe the usual precursors and companions of the plague and the progression of the pestilential principle.</P>
<P>Hippocrates has remarked the augmented violence of diseases, in particular periods. He says, "There are times when almost all the diseases that occur, are extremely malignant, and in gen∣eral, fatal, so that coughs, phthisis, angina, are all equally mor∣tal. He assures us, that the truth of his observations had been confirmed, in countries very different from each other, and in a variety of seasons and climates." See the passage cited in Zim∣merman on physic, p. 163.</P>
<P>We have multiplied proofs of the justness of these remarks. During the periods which I call <HI>pestilential,</HI> the common diseases of a country, as dysentery, and intermittents, become more obstinate and mortal; and even the pleurisy and peripneumony, acquire unusual violence. And it may not be improper to re∣peat an observation before made, that the malignant or epidemic pleurisy never appears, excep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> during these pestilential periods.
<PB N="49" REF="036687_0404_100AA3D527C8B910"/>
It precedes or follows, in winter, spring or autumn, those sum∣mers alone when pestilence invades our cities. Such was the dreadful disease in America, in 1697-8—in 1761—and which has showed itself, in several towns, during the present pestilential constitution.</P>
<P>But a most satisfactory proof of the progressiveness in a pesti∣lential state of air, and in the corresponding malignity of dis∣eases, is found in the bills of mortality. Thus, before the Lon∣don plague in 1625, the bill of mortality rose from 8 or 9000, the standard of health, to 11,000 in 1623, and to 12,000 in 1624. The approach of pestilence was clearly announced, two years before it appeared. And as the time of its appearance drew near, the extension or malignity of the preceding fevers was greatly augmented; for in the year of the plague, almost nineteen thousand persons died of other diseases than the plague. As the plague usually prevails from June or July to November, and other diseases are mostly merged in it, almost all the deaths by common diseases must have been in the beginning of the year, from January to June or July. Now, eighteen thousand deaths in the six months preceding the plague, or even two thirds of the number, mark a prodigious increase of mortality—the <HI>common sign of approaching pestilence.</HI></P>
<P>In the pestilential period in London, from 1634 to 1636, the bill of mortality rose two years previous to the plague.</P>
<P>The last great plague, in 1665, was announced by unusual malignity in diseases, four years before its appearance. In 1661, according to Sydenham, began a series of epidemics, which greatly swelled the list of burials. There was however some a∣batement in 1663; but in 1664, and the first five months of 1665, the mortality again increased with rapidity, till a dread∣ful pestilence laid waste the city.</P>
<P>A similar increase of mortality is observable in the bills for Augsburg, previous to the plague in 1628, and in 1635—in Dresden, in 1632 and 3—in Philadelphia in 1793, in New-York in 1795, and in New-London in 1798.</P>
<P>It must however be observed, that the bills of mortality will
<PB N="50" REF="036687_0405_100AA41150EB0A18"/>
not, in all cases, exhibit the augmented number and malignancy of the diseases which precede pestilence; for it sometimes hap∣pens that the year next preceding the plague, is very healthy, and the malignancy in the distempers, which mark the beginning of the pestilential state, does not appear till the winter or spring previous to the plague. In this case, the augmented mortality falls within the year and the same bills, as the deaths by the plague. This was the case in Augsburg in the year 1535. In such cases, there is an interval between the preceding epidemics and the plague; such as we have observed in the New-England States, between the influenza and the scarlet fever, and the lat∣ter disease and the yellow fever.</P>
<P>Monthly bills will exhibit the progress of pestilential epidem∣ics, with more accuracy.</P>
<P>Fernelius remarks page 161, that "infection is to be perceiv∣ed in the air, when it produces fevers not pestilent, but which are at the threshhold of pestilence,"—plainly intimating that cer∣tain malignant diseases precede the plague. He speaks of the fact as general and well understood.</P>
<P>Even in the West-Indies, the infectious yellow fever has its pre∣cursors. That fever in Barbadoes, in 1738, was preceded by catarrh and suffocating cough in 1737 and spring of 1738. Yet authors pretend the disease to have been <HI>imported</HI> from Martinico!</P>
<BIBL>See Warren and Short, vol. 2. 164.</BIBL>
<P>The different modes in which pestilence invades mankind, seem to depend on different causes. Sometimes, the principal cause seems to be an essential alteration in the invisible properties of the elements; in which case, the diseases of a particular con∣stitution, tho somewhat modified in their symptoms, are not con∣trolled or arrested by the seasons. On the contrary the atmosphere continues to be pestilential, and to multiply disorders of a ma∣lignant type, through every variety of seasons and of weather. Thus, we observe many instances of violent plagues in the most pleasant, and to all appearance, the most salubrious seasons. Several instances have been mentioned in the preceding history, and we have demonstration of the fact in the United States. The present pestilential state commenced with the measles and
<PB N="51" REF="036687_0406_100AA3D90E0FC310"/>
catarrh of 1789 and 90.—The summers of 1794 and of 1797 were apparently temperate and salubrious; yet in both these summers, the plague renewed its ravages in some towns, tho with less mortality than in the sultry and unhealthy summers of 1793-95 and 98.</P>
<P>On the other hand, pestilence sometimes proceeds principally from excessively intemperate seasons, as in severe heat, after a cold winter. In this case, the pestilence may invade a city very suddenly and without a regular augmentation of mortality from previous diseases. But even in this case, the plague has its precur∣sors, which appear at leas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a few weeks, if not two or three months previous to its attack.</P>
<P>Thus the plague in Aleppo in 1742, first showed itself in the suburbs in April; but was preceded by an acute fever in March. The bilious plague in Philadelphia in 1793, according to Dr. Rush, was preceded by the influenza, scarlatina and bilious re∣mittents. The same disease in 1797 appeared, in scattering ca∣ses, as early as June.</P>
<P>In New-York, the epidemic of 1795 was preceded by an∣gina trachealis with anomalous symptoms, some cases of obsti∣nate dysentery, at a premature stage of summer, and by febrile complaints accompanied with bilious evacuations. At a meeting of the medical society, early in July, these facts were mentioned, as denoting an uncommon state of air, and the society came to a resolution, to make particular observations on the diseases that might occur, before their next meeting. But, in the interval, the crisis of the pestilence arrived, and removed all doubts.</P>
<BIBL>See Dr. Baily on the epidemic of 1795, p. 55, and sequel.</BIBL>
<P>The severe pestilence of the year 1798 doubtless owes its vio∣lence to a series of most intemperate weather—most excessive heat, following a long and severely cold winter. Yet this dis∣ease was preceded by premonitory signs, especially catarrhal fe∣vers. Of all the disorders to which mankind are exposed, none seem to indicate a pestilential state of air, with so much certainty as catarrhal affections. They almost always precede the plague —usually accompany it, and sometimes tread close upon its heels.</P>

of the progression of pestilence, let me mention Skenkius, who, in speaking of the diseases of 1564 and 5, observes, that angi∣nas, pleurisies and peripneumonies became epidemic; abortions were frequent, pains in the joints, small pox and measles "quos tanquam praecursores sequebatur epidemica lues, incredibili gras∣sationis saevitia," depopula<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing towns and country, in Turkey, Egypt, France, England and Germany. Observations, p. 748.</P>
<P>Skenkius remarked that the plague followed the other epidem∣ics, as <HI>its precursors.</HI></P>
<P>The same author takes notice of a malignant angina, in 1564, which often proved fatal in a few hours, like the plague. I men∣tion this, because the learned Dr. Fothergill, and tribes of mod∣ern physicians who follow a celebrated name, have alledged that the angina maligna is a new disease, not known in Europe till a∣bout the year 1610, altho it never was more fatal, than in England in 1517.</P>
<P>In 1573 prevailed dysentery, measles, and purple fever, which in 1574, says Skenkius, <HI>changed into the plague.</HI> His words are remarkable. "Dudum sane praesagiebat animus mihi, malignum hoc febrium genus, quod toto biennio Europae partem non mini∣mam peragravit, velut sparsis quibusdam praeludiis, in pestem aper∣tissimam transiturum. Neque me adeo mea fefellit opinio." Ob∣serv. p. 761. This author foresaw the plague, by means of its precursors.</P>
<P>"Eodem modo variolae, morbilli, dysenteriae grossantes, sae∣pissime sunt praecursores internuncii pestis." Epidemic small-pox, measles and dysentery, are very often the forerunners of the plague.</P>

<P>It is a common remark that the reigning epidemic subdues all other diseases, or compels them to assume its character. This re∣mark, as a general one, is just; and is of no small weight, in proving the connection between certain species of epidemics. In the spring of 1795, the measles prevailed in New-York, but of a mild type. In August, this disease disappeared, being com∣pletely merged in the bilious fever that spread from August to November. No sooner had the fever subsided, than the measles
<PB N="53" REF="036687_0408_100AA3D6AFF29CC8"/>
re-appeared, and was of a less favorable type. This is a con∣tagious disease, and yet how impotent was its contagion, in the instance related, under the all-controlling influence of the season and the elements.—It disappeared in summer in defiance of the powers of specific contagion, and was reproduced in autumn, with∣out its assistance.</P>
<P>This fact demonstrates that a general cause operated in the production of that disease; which general cause, in summer, was controlled, by the heat of the season and local causes in that city; these temporary and local causes operated during a particu∣lar time, and gave a different complexion to diseases; when they gave way, at the approach of winter, the general cause again as∣sumed its empire and reproduced the measles, which is a disease little affected by local causes.</P>
<P>But while local causes predominated, in producing bilious plague, the general cause was not altogether inefficient; no bil∣ious pestilence ever becoming epidemic and infectious, but un∣der the influence of a pestilential constitution.</P>
<P>A fact related in Fairfield's diary, relative to the small-pox in Boston in 1702, is very much in point.</P>
<P>This disease appeared in June and gave much alarm; but prov∣ed to be of a mild type, and none died of it for several weeks. It continued to be favorable, till September, when it assumed a more formidable aspect; being attended with what the writer calls a scarlet fever. The season was excessively dry. In De∣cember, the scarlet fever abated, but the small-pox continued to be very mortal, till the following spring. These facts are relat∣ed by an unlettered, observing man; but they are evidence of a progressiveness in the disease. The efflorescence that accompa∣nied the disease from September to December was only a partic∣ular, malignant symptom or modification of the small-pox, pro∣duced by season or other temporary cause.</P>
<P>The measles often exhibits a similar progression. This cir∣cumstance explains the difficulties mentioned by medical writers. Dr. Rush mentions the circumstance of persons in 1789, who had a fever, cough and all the symptoms of measles, except a general eruption. Some had a trifling efflorescence about the
<PB N="54" REF="036687_0409_100AA416F880E3B8"/>
neck and breast. The same happened in 1773 and 1783. Vol. 2. 238. The fact is also mentioned in Edinburgh Medical Es∣says, vol. 5. Persons thus affected have the measles, months or years afterwards. This lighter species of the measles is pro∣duced by the same general cause which produces the disease in full force; but the constitution, at that time, resists the further operation of the cause. At a future time the cause will produce the disease complete.</P>
<P>Under the history of the diseases of 1792 and 3, I have re∣lated the progress of the late scarlatina in this country. There cannot be stronger evidence of the progression of an epidemic in∣fluence in the atmosphere than the history of that distemper has furnished. The violent stage of that disease, was preceded four, five, and in some places eight months, by a milder species of the disorder; and this mild form was, in some places, an epidemic. These facts entirely overwhelm all the pretended influence of in∣fection, in originating the disease. They prove incontestibly that a state of air suited to the production of that disease, was not the effect of any sudden, visible change in the seasons; for the mild form of the scarlatina appeared indifferently, in any season of the year; as at New-York in August, at Hartford in May and at New-Haven in November; but that it was a progres∣sive change, gradually inducing debility in the human body, or whatever else may be its predisposition to a particular disease.</P>
<P>Whether the scarlatina appeared, in any part of the country, without being announced by this slight form of the disease, is a question that cannot be solved, without particular information from every town. And very possibly the fact itself may have passed, in some places, unobserved. But the progressiveness of the distemper was distinctly marked in New-York, in Fairfield, in New-Haven, in Bethlem and in Hartford.</P>
<P>The same phenomenon was observed in the same disease, in 1786, in London. The first case appeared in March, was of a mild kind and excited no great apprehension. No other case oc∣curred to the knowledge of the physician, except in the same family, till May, when another case appeared, but of a light kind. In June, the disease became epidemic and malignant.
<PB N="55" REF="036687_0410_100AA3DAAEA880F8"/>
Here we observe the progress of the pestilential principle, in England, like that which has been observed in America.</P>
<BIBL>See Memoirs of the Medical Society, London, vol. 1. 388.</BIBL>
<P>A remarkable fact mentioned by the great Mr. Boyle, in the fifth volume of his works, p. 724, serves to show the regular progression of that state of air which produces the plague. In 1665, three months before the plague broke out in London, a man sent for a physician, complaining of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> swelling in his groin, from which circumstance he predicted the plague which was to follow, and said he had experienced the same swelling in the former plagues, which he considered as the certain forerunner of the dis∣ease. Boyle took this account from the physician himself.</P>
<P>This was no whim, for it is perfectly philosophical. It is a common fact, that, during the plague, in a city, persons in health experience severe pains in the glands, as in the groin and under the arms, those sensible parts which are peculiarly affected by the disease. Sorbait mentions that he felt such pains, during the plague in Vienna in 1679, and others did the same, but without any tumor. Dr. Gothwald experienced similar pains in the plague at Dantzick in 1709.</P>
<BIBL>See Baddam's Memoirs, vol. 6. 12.</BIBL>
<P>Boyle, vol. 6. 429, relates that one Beale knew a woman who could certainly tell when the plague was in the neighboring country, by a pain in the wounds of three sores she had, when affected by the plague in her youth. The relation is altogether credible; for we know that the state of air producing the dis∣ease, occasions pains in the glands of persons in health; much more therefore would the same parts, after being rendered more sensible by plague sores, be affected with pain, during a similar state of air. The facts demonstrate that the plague is produced by a peculiar state of air, which may be perceived before the dis∣ease appears; and much more, during its prevalance, by persons in health.</P>
<P>Another fact demonstrative of the same doctrin of a progres∣sion in the pestilential principle, is, the unusual number of abor∣tions, which <HI>precede</HI> the invasion of a severe plague. This fact was observed by Diemerbroeck, previous to the plague in Ni∣mueguen,
<PB N="56" REF="036687_0411_100AA41994FDC398"/>
in 1636, and is numbered by him among the presages of the disease. De peste page 11. Other authors have record∣ed the same fact, among whom Diemerbroeck cites Alexander Benedictus, Forestus and Seunertus.</P>
<P>The cause assigned for this phenomenon, is, "the debility of the heart and other viscera, which renders the tender body of the foetus incapable of resisting the malignity of the pestilential poison, and which exposes the woman in a pregnant state, to continual irritation."</P>
<P>In confirmation of this principle, we may cite the facts, so fre∣quently mentioned by writers on this subject, that the plague rarely or never spares pregnant women. This was remarked by Livy and Dionysius in Rome—by Procopius and Evagrius, in the plagues of 543 and 590, and by subsequent writers.</P>
<P>The fact authorizes the supposition, that a pestilential state of air induces extreme excitement or irritability, and consequently indirect debility, especially in the nervous and vascular systems. The effect of this general cause must of course be first visible in persons most susceptible of excitement—among whom are preg∣nant women, which is obvious from the facility with which they receive impressions from the sight of unnatural objects. The ap∣pearance of the effect of the pestilential state of the atmosphere, on such persons, <HI>previous to its fatal effects on other persons,</HI> leaves no room to question its gradual increase in strength.</P>
<P>Of the progressiveness of pestilential epidemics therefore we can have no doubt, nor of their connection through a common cause. The order i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which they show themselves is not exactly the same; being varied by a multitude of subordinate causes, as seasons, weather, noxious exhalations, and sometimes perhaps by infection.</P>
<P>The accounts of diseases in the two or three last centuries are recorded with so little regard to just arrangement, that it is no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> easy to collect from them the exact order in time, in which the epidemics of any particular period have appeared. Sydenham however has left an admirable sample of the hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ory of epidem¦ics in London from 1661 to 1680—a samp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e that throws im∣mense light on the principles here maintained—a sample which
<PB N="57" REF="036687_0412_100AA3DDF28ACC08"/>
ought to be well studied, and which it is inexcuseable in medical writers not to imitate. Let any man observe the regularity with which certain eruptive diseases, as the measles and small-pox, appeared and subsided, according to the seasons, during the con∣stitution of air fitted to produce them, until both yielded to a different constitution, and then say, whether he can question Sydenham's principles, or the existence of a general contagion, operating in the production of a particular class of diseases. Un∣der a philosophical view of such facts, into what trifles will dwindle all the formidable vulgar doctrines about infection!</P>
<P>It must however be remarked, that the small-pox, in modern times, will not exhibit similar effects as formerly; since the art of inoculation has nearly banished the disease as an epidemic, from our cities, where alone it used to prevail to any considerable extent.</P>
<P>Let us then attend to the order of the epidemics which have marked the latest periods of pestilence in America; many of which are within the memory of the present generation.</P>

<P>Such has been the general course of epidemic diseases in Ame∣rica, as far as I can obtain information. Further enquiries may render the account more accurate, and more nearly perfect.</P>
<P>It will be observed that the order is not quite uniform; nor is this to be expected, considering the various causes which concur in the production, and diversification of diseases. In general, measles and catarrh precede anginas, dysentery and pestilential fevers. And it is remarkable that these diseases belong to the class of inflammatory diathesis: So does the mild small-pox, which, before the practice of inoculation, was almost regularly a precursor of the plague in the cities of Europe.</P>
<P>In general then epidemic diseases first attack the brain and the throat, before they seize the whole nervous system and the abdo∣minal viscera. It is observable also, that winter, spring and autumn, produce mostly diseases of the stenic diathesis, as measles, catarrh, and inflammatory fevers; and summer, diseases of astenic diathe∣sis, as typhus fevers, dysentery of a malignant kind, and plague. Indeed the plague seems to begin and end in catarrh—that is, it begins in catarrh in winter and spring, takes the form of plague, during the hot season, and re-assumes the catarrhal and inflamma∣tory form in the succeeding winter. The measles and influen∣za, however, prevail at any season.</P>
<P>When I arrange epidemics under particular years, I speak of those diseases which extend over a whole country, or occur in ma∣ny places. If we look into large cities, we shall find some of these diseases, almost every year. But my observations relate on∣ly to those diseases when they become general, or occur in vari∣ous parts of a country in the same year.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="036687_0415_100AA41E5EBA45A0"/>When I place angina, plague and dysentery against a particular year, it is not intended that these diseases were all epidemic in the same place. Thus, while in 1793 the plague was in Phila∣delphia, the scarlatina began to prevail in New-York and the wes∣tern part of Connecticut. For it must not be overlooked, that although measles and influenza appear nearly at the same time in all parts of the United States, yet the pestilential fevers that fol∣low them first show themselves in the larger cities in the southern latitudes. Thus the measles and influenza were universal in 1789 and 90, at least this was the case with the influenza; but the bili∣ous plague broke out in New-York, Philadelphia and Charleston, before it did in Boston and Newburyport. The same is observa∣ble in the other hemisphere. The influenza spreads over Asia, Europe and Africa, in a few weeks, but the following pestilence first appears in Egypt or the Levant, or in Turkey, then in the northern parts of Europe. To these remarks there are few ex∣ceptions.</P>
<P>It is also observable, that the pestilence in cities takes the form of petechial fever and plague; but in country towns, more gene∣rally terminates in dysentery.</P>
<P>It is a popular opinion that measles and small-pox never origi∣nate in the human constitution, without contagion. The palpable absurdity of such an opinion has not prevented its propagation and belief, among even well-informed men. So far is this opinion from truth, that the first cases of these diseases in every epidemic period, are always generated in the human body, without conta∣gion. When the condition of the elements is fitted to produce these diseases, they appear in all parts of a country, without con∣tagion, they spread rapidly, and decline when the general causes cease to operate. During this period, contagion is efficacious in propagating them, and no longer. When the condition of the elements is not fitted to produce them, if sporadic cases appear in particular habits of body, they will not always spread the diseases.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is here meant of the natural contagion of the diseases from the breath and effluvia, which is not always efficacious in spreading them. The variolous matter of small-pox is excepted; for, if good, this will generally communicate the disease at any time.</NOTE> Sydenham long ago taught this truth, in describing the changes
<PB N="61" REF="036687_0416_100AA3E25A32B5F8"/>
in the epidemics of 1670—1672. Measles and small-pox came and went with the seasons and condition of the air.</P>
<P>The truth is, that certain conditions of the elements tend to produce <HI>eruptive diseases,</HI> and before the practice of inoculation, the small pox was almost regularly one of that series of epidemics which I class together, as of one family, and the precursors of plague. It is nearly allied to the measles, and appears usually about the same time. I am convinced that catarrh, measles, mild small-pox and whooping cough, are but varied forms of dis∣ease, occasioned by modifications of the same elemental causes.</P>
<P>Certain it is, they are all predominant about the same time, and as a general remark, they <HI>precede</HI> the invasion of diseases which bear the character of <HI>typhus.</HI></P>
<P>I have never conversed with a physician who could not name instances of small-pox, originating without any known contagion, and generally medical gentlemen admit the disease to be generated in the constitution. This principle is unquestionably just, and ought to be known, and received as truth; for the belief that con∣tagion is necessary to the existence of the disease, has produced most mischievous consequences. An instance happened in Shar∣on a few years ago, in which a woman was seized with the small-pox; but as she had not been exposed to contagion, her disease was mistaken, till just before her death; and twenty or thirty persons were supposed to have taken the disease before the true nature of it was understood.</P>
<P>In the winter of 1797-8, occurred in Hartford two sporadic cases of measles, which could not possibly be traced to contagion. At another time, a family was infected by means of a stranger; but in neither of these cases was the disease propagated to others, who were exposed to the breath of the patients. See Dr. Cogs∣well's letter, Med. Repos. vol. 2. 301. Innumerable similar in∣stances may be mentioned.</P>
<P>In the same manner the various species of angina and the plague occur in sporadic cases under the operation of powerful local and constitutional causes, which, if not favored by the condition of the elements, will not spread and become epidemic.</P>

<PB N="62" REF="036687_0417_100AA42170AE3C08"/>
<HEAD>SECTION XIV. Of the extent of a pestilential state of air.</HEAD>
<P>FROM a view of the facts related in the preceding history, it appears that epidemics, agreeable to the definition already giv∣en, are of two kinds—first, those which are limited to a particu∣lar town, city or country; secondly, those which pervade whole quarters of the earth, or the whole globe. The first may be called local, the last, general or universal epidemics.</P>
<P>The local epidemics, most usual, are dysentery, remitting and intermitting fevers, and pestilence. The epidemic, most fre∣quently universal, is the catarrh or influenza. Angina is often a general epidemic, sometimes local. Pestilential fevers, in cer∣tain periods become general over vast tracts of the earth. The same is observable of the measles.</P>
<P>The epidemic catarrh is the disorder which most decisively proves a rapid and universal change in the essential properties of the atmosphere. This disease sometimes invades the human race so suddenly, that half the inhabitants of a town or city are seiz∣ed in a night. I do not find the same fact related of any other disease, except the sweating plague in 1529, whose progress through Europe was as rapid nearly as that of the catarrh, and utterly precludes the supposition that infection from fomes, had any share in its propagation.</P>
<P>Catarrh however is not always a universal epidemic. In many instances, it is confined to one hemisphere, as in 1647, 1655, to America; and in 1650, 1775, to Europe.</P>
<P>In other instances, this disease spreads over the whole world, in a short period, but is progressive, appearing in the two hem∣ispheres, in two different years. Thus in 1761, it was epidemic in America; in 1762 in Europe.—In 1781 in America; in
<PB N="63" REF="036687_0418_100AA3E40D0A7870"/>
1782 in Europe; in 1698 in America; in 1699 in Europe. In two or three instances, I find it in both hemispheres in the same year.</P>
<P>The compilers of the Encyclopedia say that catarrh from con∣tagion has "seldom appeared in any one country in Europe, with∣out appearing successively in almost every different part of it; and in some instances, it has been also <HI>transferred</HI> to America, and has been <HI>spread</HI> there, so far as we have had opportunities of be∣ing informed."</P>
<BIBL>See article, Medicine, No. 253, from Cullen.</BIBL>
<P>No source of errors, in the science of medicin, is more fruit∣ful than the doctrin of contagion. It would seem from the pas∣sage recited, that the writer considered catarrh as propagated by fomites from diseased persons; and conveyed across the ocean by the sick, or in goods or cloathing. The words will admit of no other interpretation; and yet it is hardly credible that, in this period of science and observation, an obvious and common phe∣nomenon should be so egregiously misunderstood.</P>
<P>The catarrh, whenever it has appeared as a general epidemic, instead of being <HI>transferred</HI> to America, has usually appeared in America <HI>before</HI> it has in Europe or at the same time; and so far is contagion from being the necessary cause of its origin and pro∣pagation, that the disease invades seamen on the ocean in the same hemisphere, when a hundred leagues from land, at the same time that it invades people on shore. Of this I have certain evi∣dence from the testimony of American Captains of vessels, who have been on their passage from the continent to the West-India Islands, during the prevalence of this disease.</P>
<P>If further evidence is required, we have the fact, that the epi∣demic catarrh in America rages with as much violence in the isl∣ands as on the continent, and at the same time. And in the preceding history, it is stated on the authority of a medical publi∣cation in Scotland, that the universal catarrh of 1733, appeared in the Isle of Bourbon, in the Indian Ocean, about the time it did in Europe.</P>
<P>From these facts, it is evident that the disease is occasioned by an alteration in the atmosphere. In many instances it is limited to one hemisphere; but it is observable, that whenever it appears
<PB N="64" REF="036687_0419_100AA422F6C08A60"/>
on the American continent, it appears also in the islands of the West-Indies. Its range is through a certain section of the globe, nearly in the same longitude, north and south, on one of the great divisions of the earth, and in the vicinity of the continent. The epidemic catarrh of America extends certainly from the northern limits of the United States to the island of Barbadoes. Whether it appears at the same time in South-America, I cannot find a hint in any author to guide my opinion, except in regard to the last epidemic, which pervaded that part of the continent.</P>
<P>The catarrh of 1733 extended over the globe, but it appeared first in America. Possibly there may have been other instances, since the settlement of America, but I have little information on this point, in regard to this country. It is not probable, for in∣stance, that the severe catarrh of 1708-9, was confined to Eu∣rope, but it is useless to indulge conjecture.</P>
<P>The remote cause usually assigned for catarrh is a sudden change of weather, from heat to cold or from cold to heat—the proxi∣mate cause, an increased afflux of fluids to the mucous membrane of the nose, fances and bronchiae, with some degree of inflamma∣tion. Some medical writers seem to think the remote cause to be the application of cold only to the human body, checking the perspiration by the skin, and turning the fluids upon the mucous membrane. See Cullen on this point.</P>
<P>The proximate causes of the disease are the province of medi∣cal men; but to the influence of the remote cause above stated, physicians will pardon me for stating a few objections.</P>
<P N="1">1. The application of cold to the body cannot be the sole cause of catarrh, because it appears, and usually with most severity, in the spring, on the abstraction of cold. It is observable also, that in many instances its principal violence and mortality, are, after the return of warm weather—the disease augmenting in violence with the increase of heat. Thus the catarrh of 1709 appeared in Italy, says Lancisius, in January in severe cold weather, but increased in violence, as the spring advanced and the weather moderated.</P>
<P>The same fact took place in the catarrh of 1762 at Edinburgh, where it began in April and increased in violence till June.</P>
<P>In the same manner, the catarrh in this country in 1790, ap∣pearing in March and April, on the moderation of cold, was far
<PB N="65" REF="036687_0420_100AA3E7E1FE7038"/>
more severe than that of the preceding autumn, when the weather was changing from heat to cold. At least this was the fact in many of the northern states.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is not always true, that the epidemic catarrh appears in spring or autumn, or after great changes of weather. The noted catarrh of 1580 began to appear in Sicily in the month of June; at Rome in July; at Venice and Constantinople in August—in the midst of summer. It is against all probability, that this dis∣ease can be ascribed to the application of cold. On the other hand, its progress was evidently steady, and uninterrupted by ei∣ther heat or cold—A careful attention to the history of this epi∣demic at other times, will doubtless furnish other similar facts.</P>
<P>The catarrh of 1688 seized Germany in summer; that of 1557 appeared in Spain in August; that in America in 1655 began about the close of June.</P>
<P N="3">3. The appearance of catarrh in tropical climates, as in the West-Indies, at the same time it appears in northern latitudes, is a strong argument against ascribing it to the application of cold. In the West-Indies there is no change of any great consequence, in the temperature of the weather; nothing like <HI>cold</HI> is known in those regions. Yet catarrh, if credible accounts are to be ad∣mitted as evidence, is as fatal at times within the tropics, as in any other climate.</P>
<P>It is true, that in autumn winds called <HI>norths,</HI> northerly breezes, are experienced in the islands, and these produce colds and coughs similar to what we all experience, in temperate latitudes, on the change of weather in spring and autumn. But these are very different, at least in degree, from a general epidemic influenza, which seizes mankind in all climates, with pain in the side and bones, accompanied often with fever. The universality of this disease, bursting suddenly upon all climates, and raging with equal violence in all seasons, and in defiance of heat or cold, leave us no room to question its dependence on some other cause than changes of weather or application of cold.</P>
<P N="4">4. If the application of cold was the sole cause of this epidem∣ic, it would appear at the same time in all places which experience a sudden change from heat to cold at the same time. And fur∣ther,
<PB N="66" REF="036687_0421_100AA42484D60980"/>
a necessary consequence would be, it must be epidemic on every such change. Neither of these cases occurs. On the other hand, the disease begins indifferently in any climate and in any season of the year, and spreads speedily over whole countries, with∣out the least obstruction from heat or cold: And as far as I can observe from the accounts of it before me, it is as mortal when it invades people in hot climates, as in cold or temperate regions and seasons. It is also progressive in point of place; but it moves with a celerity unknown to all other diseases. Sometimes it pas∣ses over Europe in six weeks. In America, its duration in 1789 and in 1790, was nearly the same. Different epidemics, how∣ever, differ in the rapidity of their movements: That of 1580 was about six months in traversing Europe.</P>
<P>Different epidemics also differ in point of generality and vio∣lence. Sometimes the catarrh is a light complaint; at other times it is attended with fever, and occasions no inconsiderable mortality. The catarrh in the spring of 1790, was much more severe than that of the autumn preceding. In 1789, it resem∣bled a severe and universal cold—in 1790, it bordered more on the pleurisy and peripneumony. To these remarks there may have been particular exceptions.</P>
<P N="5">5. It appears to me also, that, with deference to the faculty, a strong argument against deriving the disease from sudden chan∣ges of weather only, may be drawn from a difference in the symp∣toms of an epidemic influenza and of sporadic cases of the disease, obviously contracted by cold. Let me ask practitioners, whether in the epidemic catarrh, there do not appear symptoms altogether unknown in sporadic cases? But as this is a point that regards practice, it is not proper for me to discuss it.</P>
<P>The celebrated Boyle very justly observes that sudden epidem∣ic colds, are not to be accounted for by changes of weather. Vol. 5, p. 49.</P>
<P>I do not, however, deny the influence of heat and cold in the epidemic catarrh. In some violent epidemics of this sort, heat and cold seem to have little influence—the disease appearing to rage, independent of all the sensible qualities of the air. Yet in ordinary cases, the temperature of the air seems to <HI>modify,</HI> but not to <HI>generate</HI> or <HI>destroy</HI> the epidemic.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="036687_0422_100AA3E9670BA6B8"/>Brown, in his elements of medicin, arranges catarrh among diseases of the stenic diathesis. Whether he meant to extend his observation to sporadic cases from cold only, or to the influen∣za also, I do not know; but it may not be improper in me to mention, that in many epidemics of this sort, bleeding has proved injurious or fatal. The most generally successful remedies have been the diaphoretic, although there have been a few exceptions, in which bleeding was salutary. Indeed no disease seems to ad∣mit of a greater diversity of symptoms.</P>
<P>Next to the catarrh, in the list of general epidemics, we may perhaps arrange the measles, which, though sometimes a local dis∣ease, often appears over whole countries, and sometimes in both hemispheres at the same time.</P>
<P>This disease is attended with specific contagion, which aids its communication from place to place; but it derives its origin from a particular state of the atmosphere. Hence it appears in one season and disappears in another, yielding to some other disease, as Sydenham remarked in the year 1672, and which we observed in New-York in 1795. It is nearly allied to the catarrh as is evident from the catarrhous symptoms that attend it. Brown classes the measles in the number of stenic diseases.</P>
<P>It will be found on examining the history of diseases, that the measles usually <HI>precedes</HI> or <HI>follows</HI> an epidemic influenza. The two diseases therefore manifest a close alliance in the remote causes.</P>
<P>My accounts of epidemics are too imperfect to authorize the assertion, that these diseases <HI>always</HI> appear nearly together; but this has been the fact, with respect to a number of the last epi∣demic periods in America. The order however is varied. Sometimes also a slight degree of one or both of these diseases is experienced in particular places, when neither of them is epidemic. But when they become violent and general, they are nearly co∣temporaneous, spreading successively over a large portion of the earth, and sometimes over both hemispheres.</P>
<P>In 1772 the catarrh and measles raged in the same year, from Boston to Charleston. To these succeeded anginas and dysente∣ry, for a series of years. In 1781 and 2 catarrh pervaded the
<PB N="68" REF="036687_0423_100AA4271306A6B8"/>
globe. In 1783 began measles in May, and angina in August. In 1789 measles preceded the influenza. In 1757 influenza preceded the measles.</P>
<P>An epidemic which used formerly to make a figure in medical history, as one nearly cotemporary with measles, was the small-pox. The disease was observed by Sydenham, to rage alternate∣ly with measles in different seasons of the year. Like the mea∣sles, it is an eruptive disease, of the stenic species specifically con∣tagious, and evidently depending on the same general cause, though on different temporary or local causes. Inoculation has nearly banished this from the list of epidemics.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is a common error that this disease never originates without contagion. Before the art of inoculation, it was an epidemic in large cities, appearing and disappearing with as much regularity and certainty as the measles. I can name many instances of its originating in this country without contagion or infection, and I have the authority of many old practitioners of medicin for the fact. It most usually ap∣pears in those years which manifest a disposition to produce other erup∣tive diseases.</NOTE></P>
<P>But a more formidable epidemic, and perhaps the most formi∣dable to which the human race is exposed, is the angina, using this word to denote all the different kinds of affections of the throat. I call it the most formidable, because hitherto no means have been discovered of arresting its progress. Its horrors and fatality are not mitigated by inoculation, like those of the small-pox, nor are its usual ravages limited to populous towns, like those of the plague. Under all aspects, therefore, I consider it as a far more dreadful disease than either, because the others may be mitigated or avoided.</P>
<P>Affections of the throat, either in the form of scarlatina angi∣nosa, angina maligna, cynanche trachealis, &amp;c. are among the epi∣demics which belong to almost every pestilential period. In the order of appearance they have not one uniform place; but in America, anginas have usually succeeded catarrh, the first or se∣cond year, and continued to the fourth or fifth. In the three last epidemic periods, this order has been very uniform. I speak of epidemic angina which spreads over the whole country; for in particular places we hear of it almost every year.</P>
<P>These diseases in our large cities have been succeeded by the
<PB N="69" REF="036687_0424_100AA3EBA37F5F30"/>
bilious plague, and in the country, by violent remittents, typhus fevers and dysentery.</P>
<P>Sometimes angina prevails without being followed by the plague: That is, the constitution of air terminates at that point of its pestilential progress. Such seems to have been the fact with the angina of 1755. And in all cases in which it is of a mild kind, or not universal, strong hopes may be entertained, that no plague will follow it. The epidemic anginas from 1783 to 1786, were of this kind.</P>
<P>With respect to the universality of the cause of these epidemics, it is to be observed, that it is of two kinds—sometimes it extends to both hemispheres, at other times it seems to be limited to one. Those diseases, however, which are least influenced by heat or cold, or which depend most on some invisible state of the atmos∣phere, appear most frequently in both hemispheres, at the same time. This fact, with respect to the catarrh, has been particular∣ly noticed.</P>
<P>The same fact is observable very often with respect to the mea∣sles, and especially with regard to anginas. These affections of the throat, when violent, are nearly cotemporary in Europe and America. Witness the periods from 1751 to 1756—from 1773 to 1776—1783 to 1786—from 1793 to 1796, and in 1742.</P>
<P>This cotemporaneousness of certain epidemic diseases, in both hemispheres, is an important fact which has hitherto been little noticed, but which opens a new field for philosophical investiga∣tion. It demonstrates that such diseases are occasioned solely by a constitution of air, without the influence of contagion, although when the diseases are formed, they are contagious.</P>
<P>But we have further facts of a similar nature. It is observable that the pestilential principle often extends from Egypt, Syria and Turkey, over all Europe and to America. But the same diseases, that is, the same forms of the pestilence, do not always appear in Egypt or Turkey, and in France, England and America, in the same year. It is a general fact, that the worst form of pestilence, the inguinal plague, appears first in Cairo, Smyrna or Constanti∣nople; and from this circumstance, the advocates for the propa∣gation of that disease by specific contagion, have drawn their most
<PB N="70" REF="036687_0425_100AA429E46BD658"/>
powerful arguments in support of their theory. But this argu∣ment is founded on a view of the subject, most miserably narrow and obscure.</P>
<P>In every pestilential period, there is a series of epidemic dis∣eases. The order in which they appear depends on local or tem∣porary circumstances. Thus in Grand Cairo or Constantinople, the climate or the strong local causes, speedily bring the pestilen∣tial principle to its crisis, in the production of the plague. For this reason, that disease appears in those cities, some time <HI>before</HI> it does in northern latitudes or in more healthy cities.</P>
<P>But at the very time the plague appears in Constantinople or Cairo, some lighter epidemic disease, belonging to the series, ap∣pears in other parts of the world, indicating the approach of pes∣tilence. Thus, in 1580 and 81, Cairo was desolated by a hid∣eous plague; but, at the same time, a severe epidemic catarrh burst forth on all Europe, the certain forerunner of pestilential fe∣vers, and which, in that instance, was succeeded by plague in 1582 and 3, as far north as England. Let facts within late pe∣riods, decide this question.</P>
<P>The plague appeared in the Turkish dominions in 1718, but in 1719 became more general. In 1718 the bills of mortality were considerably swelled in Amsterdam, London and Vienna, but in 1719 they rose, in the two former cities, considerably higher—the pestilential state of air pervading the most of Europe. I have no account of the state of diseases in Marseilles, in 1718; but in 1719 appeared a pestilential fever, which increased the mortality, altho the pestilential principle did not rise to its height till the subsequent year.</P>
<P>In this period, cotemporary with the plague in the Levant, was a universal increase of mortality in Europe, and the same state of air was experienced in America, altho, in very few parts of Europe, did the pestilential principle arise to the degree of plague.</P>
<P>In 1726 we again hear of the plague in Egypt, and for two or three years succeeding, the bills of mortality were swelled in Europe and America. Of the epidemics that prevailed in A∣merica, I regret my want of information.—I only know that measles and malignant pleurisy prevailed in this country.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="036687_0426_100AA3ED2D15AFE0"/>In 1735 and 6 raged the most desolating sore throat in Ameri∣ca, and at the same time, the most fatal plague in Egypt, that has appeared in this century. This pestilence, like that in the time of Thucydides, took its rise in the interior parts of Egypt or Ethiopia. And it must not be overlooked that the violence of the pestilence in Egypt corresponded with that of the sore throat in America—a fact which, as far as I can discover, is gen∣erally true, that the more fatal the epidemics that prevail over one quarter of the globe, the more violent are the same or other pestilential diseases, in the other hemisphere. It makes little dif∣ference, that in one country rages the glandular plague, and in another the petechial fever or putrid sore throat—These are only different forms of pestilence, the <HI>effects of one common cause, modi∣fied by local causes.</HI> The great point is, that such epidemics are <HI>cotemporary in countries the most remote.</HI> Slight epidemics may appear alone, but never the more severe and deadly forms of pes∣tilence; excepting perhaps dysentery, or some other complaints that depend mostly on the seasons.</P>
<P>The years 1740-41 and 42 were also pestilential. At what time the plague of this period first appeared in the east, I am not informed. But it raged in Syria from 1742 to 1744, and it rarely happens, that it is not a year or two earlier in Egypt or Constantinople, than in Syria. Cotemporary with the plague of this period was great mortality in London and Amsterdam from the petechial fever, which fell but little short of the plague. See the bills.</P>
<P>At the same time, raged in America a series of epidemics, particularly measles, anginas and the bilious plague; the latter ap∣pearing in Philadelphia and Virginia in 1741, and in N. York in 1743, the same year with the dreadful pestilence in Messina.</P>
<P>The year 1755, the year of a great plague in Constantinople, was distinguished for catarrh in Europe, and sore throat both in Europe and America.</P>
<P>In 1758 commenced the pestilential period, which was univer∣sal and felt in both hemispheres, in some one or all of the years from 1758 to 1763. Here, it is observable, our information is more correct. In 1758, cotemporary with the beginning of this
<PB N="72" REF="036687_0427_100AA42C53098518"/>
pestilence, was an epidemic catarrh in Europe. Then followed other epidemics of a more malignant type. During this pestilen∣tial period appeared in America, the catarrh and measles, and the plague in Philadelphia in 1762; but especially the fatal epidemic pleurisy in 1761.</P>
<P>The next period commenced in 1769 or 1770, in which the plague spread over the east. This period was begun by measles and anginas, if my information is correct, in 1769—catarrh was epidemic in 1771 and 2, and in the latter year measles of a bad type. Then followed angina, and the epidemics all closed in dysenteries. The plague in the Levant was cotemporary with the commencement of this period.</P>
<P>I am not informed of the precise time when the plague of the next period commenced in the Levant, but it was raging in 1783 and 4, during the prevalence of measles and angina in America.</P>
<P>In the last period, the plague in Egypt was very violent, about the time the mortality commenced in America. Of the precise time when it began in Egypt I am not informed; but it prevailed in 1791, the year it appeared in New-York and Grenada, and was most destructive the following year, 1792, the year when the scarlatina first appeared in the northern parts of America.</P>
<P>I have no further accounts of the plague in Egypt, but the public prints have informed us, the disease prevailed in Constan∣tinople in 1797, and was more general in the Turkish dominions in 1798, the most fatal year in America.</P>
<P>The reader will be pleased to remark, that when I speak of the plague in Grand Cairo or Constantinople, I refer only to vi∣olent and destructive epidemics. The plague, in a light form, and in a few cases, occurs almost annually in those great cities, where the common causes and ordinary seasons are adequate to its production in particular constitutions. But, let me observe, that no extensive and desolating plague ever ravages either of those cities, except under the influence of general contagion, or an epidemic state of air, which is experienced, nearly at the same time, in Europe and America.</P>
<P>These facts enable us to solve the whole difficulty which has puzzled physicians, in regard to the different kinds of yellow
<PB N="73" REF="036687_0428_100AA3F0AE356820"/>
fever, which appear, at different periods, in the West-Indies. The simple truth, is, that in ordinary seasons, when no pestilen∣tial constitution of air exists, the fever of the West-Indies, is not contagious. It attacks strangers with violence and destroys life, but is not communicable <HI>per se.</HI> Hence the authors who have written on the subject are correct, in asserting this ordinary fever, not to be contagious.</P>
<P>But after catarrh has pervaded the hemisphere, and during the increase of mortality in the Levant, in Europe and on the Amer∣ican continent; that is, during a pestilential state of air, the fe∣ver of the West-Indies assumes double malignity, and becomes contagious. In years of health, the disease rarely attacks natives of the islands; but in unhealthy periods, not only native whites, but even blacks are sometimes affected with the disease. Among these however it is less destructive.</P>
<P>Thus we solve the problem which has embarrassed all the med∣ical writers on the yellow fever, the most able of whom have been compelled to declare that the fever in the Islands is sometimes contagious, and at other times, not.</P>
<P>This view of the subject would have prevented the trouble of authors who have labored to prove the disease imported from Siam, or the African coast.—Dr. Chisholm, instead of attempting to trace the Grenada fever of 1793 to Africa, through the ship Hankey, had only to remark, the prevalence of the catarrh in 1790, of the plague in Egypt in 1791, and of the scarlatina in the United States in 1793, and he would have seen the begin∣ning of a most extensive and malignant series of diseases. The truth is, the pestilential state of air first manifested itself in Gre∣nada in 1791, [the year it commenced in New-York] by new and singular symptoms, which surprised Dr. Chisholm. And this, by the way, was before the beginning of the present war, on the part of Great-Britain, and of course, it could not be as∣cribed to that circumstance. The same fact, when justly consid∣ered, is demonstration, that the disease was not brought from Africa.</P>
<P>It must be remarked however, that the fever of the tropical
<PB N="74" REF="036687_0429_100AA42DDAFC37E8"/>
climates, though not contagious in sporadic cases, in healthful years, may at any time become epidemic and contagious, under certain circumstances. Thus large bodies of soldiers and sea∣men, passing suddenly from high northern latitudes into the West-Indies, may contract the disease, and render it so virulent by crou∣ded camps and ships, as to render it very infectious. This is usu∣ally the case in wars between England and France, which call great numbers of men from Great-Britain into the islands.</P>
<P>Yet even in this case, the mortality of the disease is increased by a pestilential state of air, concurring with such local causes. Such was the state of air from 1760 to 1763, during which the British and American troops perished before Havanna. Such also has been the state of air for eight years past, in which the de∣struction of the British troops in the islands has been unparralleled.</P>
<P>This circumstance has led a respectable college of physicians in Philadelphia, to insinuate that war is a cause of the disease. Their words are, "it exists in the West-Indies, particularly in time of war, when great numbers of strangers are to be found there, and reference to dates will show, that in <HI>most</HI> of the instan∣ces of the occurrence of the disease in the United States, there has been war in the West-Indies." Memorial to the Legislature of Pennsylvania, Dec. 5, 1797.</P>
<P>This assertion, however, is not authorized by facts. The de∣plorable plague in Philadelphia and Charleston in 1699, was in time of peace. That in New-York in 1702 was in the first year of a war, but could not have been derived from that circumstance, in so short a time.</P>
<P>The same disease at Barbadoes and Martinico, in 1723, was in time of peace, in Charleston in 1728, in time of peace—at Carthagena the next year, in time of peace—at Charleston and New-York in 1732, in time of peace—at Barbadoes in 1738 and 1764, in time of peace. The instances which happened between 1740 and 48, were in time of war, as was that in Philadelphia in 1762. The present war has exhibited melancholy effects of diseases in the West-Indies; but it is an indubitable fact that the plague of the present period commenced in 1791, a year before the war, and before numerous reinforcements of troops had been
<PB N="75" REF="036687_0430_100AA3F46EFA0428"/>
sent to the islands. It must further be observed, that during the eight years war between America and Great-Britain, no yellow fever appeared in the United States! a striking fact.</P>
<P>It is certainly a most unfortunate circumstance for the credit of the college of physicians, that the longest interval of peace during the present century, from the treaty of Utrecht in 1713, to the Spanish war of 1740, includes in it the longest and most severe state of pestilential diseases, in Europe, Africa, America and the Islands, that has occurred, during the century. A simple in∣spection of the bills of mortality, during that period, will demon∣strate the fact!</P>
<P>One thing, however, may be asserted with truth, that whatever may be the extent and violence of the bilious plague in the West-Indies, it never has appeared in the northern parts of the United States, except in periods when a pestilential or sickly state of the air is manifested by the prevalence of other epidemics. In tro∣pical climates and in the southern parts of America, particular circumstances, as great bodies of fresh troops from northern lati∣tudes, or unfavorable seasons, may generate the disease in any year, however healthy in temperate latitudes. But from Mary∣land northward, this American plague has never appeared with∣out being preceded by other epidemics. Let facts be resorted to for confirmation.</P>
<P>We read of malignant diseases in America, anterior to the year 1699, but the order of them is not described. The fatal plague of that year was preceded by epidemic catarrh, and the plague raged, at the same time, in the Levant. The same dis∣ease in New-York in 1702, belongs to the same period, which seems to have commenced in 1697 and ended in 1702.</P>
<P>The next sickly period was from 1709 to 1713, beginning in Europe with the severe catarrh of 1709, which was followed by plague in the Baltic towns, in Hungary, Vienna, &amp;c. accom∣panied with a most desolating sickness among horned cattle and horses, in Germany and Italy. Of the effects of this constitu∣tion of air, in America, I have but two instances, which were a most distressing sickness in Waterbury, in Connecticut, which almost depopulated the town, and epidemic measles in 1712.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="036687_0431_100AA42F81E9C6D0"/>Of the next pestilential period, about 1720, I have also but two instances in America; the mortality at Duck creek, as al∣ready related, and the malignant pleurisy in Hartford.</P>
<P>The plague in Philadelphia and Virginia in 1741, and in New-York in 1743, was preceded by the usual epidemics, in∣fluenza, measles, angina, &amp;c. and at the same time the plague was raging in the Levant and in Sicily.</P>
<P>The same disease in Philadelphia in 1762 had its usual precur∣sors, measles and catarrh, and this occurred during the prevalence of the plague, in the Levant.</P>
<P>I hardly need to mention, in proof, the present epidemics. It is well known, we have passed through the whole series of precursors, catarrh, scarlatina, measles, &amp;c. the two former be∣ing far more general and severe than usual, indicated, with in∣fallible certainty, the violence and extent of the plague which was to follow.</P>
<P>From a long series of facts, then, we demonstrate that the plague of our climate depends on some <HI>general cause.</HI> And it must abash and confound the sticklers for the propagation of this disease from country to country by fomes, to know that the dis∣ease never occurs in the temperate latitudes of America, except under a pestilential constitution of air, manifested by other ma∣lignant diseases in this country, which are certainly <HI>not</HI> imported, and during also the prevalence of similar diseases in the Levant, and an increase of mortality in other countries. It must still more confound these persons, if they have any susceptibility of conviction, to observe that these very pestilential diseases, instead of being conveyed from place to place, appear at one and the same time in Egypt, Turkey, the West-Indies, and in the Uni∣ted States. This is very common, and probably is always the fact.</P>
<P>If the pestilence were introduced into this country, from the islands, and if the disease is capable of being propagated as an epidemic, from fomes, why, let me ask, has it never been prop∣agated in the United States, in healthy periods? It has been <HI>imported</HI> probably in hundreds of instances, from the islands, ever since the commencement of the West-India trade.</P>
<P>Not a year passed from 1763 to 1791, in which multitudes of
<PB N="77" REF="036687_0432_100AA3F5F88F62A8"/>
seamen or pessengers were not brought into the United States, in∣to large and small towns, and into hospitals filled with patients, with the yellow fever upon them and all their infected clothing. Yet in all this long period, no contagion appeared, altho no pre∣cautions, at least in many parts of the country, were ever taken to prevent it. If the disease contains specific contagion, surely that contagion must take effect under all circumstances. Every man knows that the variolous matter of the small-pox regards neither time nor place; its contagion acts in all years, seasons and climates, tho not with equal certainty.</P>
<P>This fact alone, that the bilious plague never shows itself in the temperate latitudes of America, except when the current epi∣demics of this country, manifest a general constitution of air, unfriendly to health, is sufficient to explain all the difficulties that have occured to medical men and to others, on the subject of the origin and peculiar symptoms of the disease.</P>
<P>Some of these remarks are in anticipation of the subject of a∣nother section, but they fall naturally enough under this head, the design of which is, to establish the doctrin of the universali∣ty of certain diseases, at particular times, occasioned by a cause or causes extending often over a whole hemisphere, and sometimes over the earth.—That such is the fact, is demonstrated by the history of epidemics, from the earliest ages to this day. A suc∣cessive series of similar facts, occurring age after age, leave no room for cavil or controversy.</P>
<P>I have confined my remarks, on this head, to the latest periods of the world, because the evidence is more complete. But a simple inspection of the preceding history, will convince any can∣did person, that the phenomena of pestilence have been uniform, from the highest antiquity. In the most barbarous ages, when commerce was unknown, all the severe plagues appeared in al∣most every part of the earth, in high northern latitudes, and a∣mong savage tribes which had no intercourse with the Mediterra∣nean. The custom of deriving all plagues from Egypt, Syria or Turkey by specific contagion, is modern—it is pointedly contra∣dicted by all history—is unworthy of the enlightened period in which it has been advanced—and marks an extreme degeneration in philosophy.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XV. Of the phenomena which attend pestilential periods, with conjectures concerning the causes.</HEAD>
<P>IT will not escape the most inattentive reader of the foregoing history, that all the violent and general plagues have been prece∣ded or accompanied with remarkable phenomena in the physical world, as comets, earthquakes, explosions of volcanoes, and oth∣ers of a subordinate kind.</P>
<P>We are to admit, with great caution, the influence of the plan∣ets in producing the calamitous diseases which at periods afflict mankind. It is an influence very uncertain and undefinable. It is not indeed unphilosophical to suppose, the several immense orbs that compose the solar system, to have an influence on each other by means of the great laws of attraction and repulsion. The con∣trary supposition would be most unphilosophical. But it might be very difficult to ascertain precisely what that influence is, be∣cause it might not be possible to separate its effects from those which are produced by other causes.</P>
<P>The ancients went much too far in ascribing events on this earth to planetary influence. They ascribed not only natural, but moral effects to that influence, and by their extravagant system of judicial astrology, brought into contempt the study of the influ∣ence of heavenly bodies.</P>
<P>We are not however to discard all considerations of such an influence. We are naturally led to suppose that all parts of our system are connected by principles of attraction, and that a cer∣tain order and equilibrium are necessary to keep all parts in due harmony. It is very obvious that the moon has a most material influence in regulating the seasons and changes of weather on this
<PB N="79" REF="036687_0434_100AA3F928127410"/>
globe, especially the weekly and monthly vicissitudes. The more distant bodies may have a similar effect, tho less obvious.</P>
<P>Comets, which approach and enter the solar system at certain unequal periods, may also have some influence upon the seasons. To ascertain this point, I have collected all the information my reading has enabled me to discover.</P>
<P>The ancients believed these bodies to be the causes or at least the harbingers of pestilence; according to that line of Claudian</P>
<LG>
<L>"In coelo nunquam spectatum impuné cometam."</L>
<L>"A comet in the heavens is never beheld with impunity."</L>
</LG>
<P>But should the fact be admitted, it might be still a subject of enquiry, by what means these erratic bodies injure the health of mankind. That they have some effect of this kind, seems to be very probable, not only from the opinion of the ancients who were careful in their observations, but from the very uniform co∣incidence of their appearance with extensive pestilence.</P>
<P>It is certain that comets have a very sensible effect on the weather. This was observed as long ago as the days of Aris∣totle, who remarks, Meteorol. lib. 1. ca. 7. "That comets denote great tides and winds." He instances the swell of the sea when Achaia was inundated, which was during the appear∣ance of a comet. Pliny makes a similar observation. "Ventos autem ab iis graves aestusque significa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i." Nat. Hist. lib. 2. ca. 25. Seneca was of the same opinion, and he mentions storms of rain also among the effects of their approach. Seneca, Nat. Qust. lib. 7. sect. 28.</P>
<P>It is true that great heat and drouth, and violent tempests mark the periods of the approach of comets, and it is equally true that the winters of the same periods are remarkably cold. Aristotle himself mentions the cold of the winter, during the appearance of the great comet, when Aristaeus was archon at Athens.</P>
<P>The preceding relation of facts furnishes a confirmation of these opinions. All the comets which have approached this earth, in their passage to or from the sun, especially those which have passed very near us, have been preceded, attended and fol∣lowed by most extraordinary effects, as great heat and drouth,
<PB N="80" REF="036687_0435_100AA43419D8CA70"/>
in summer, and severe cold in winter; deluging rains, violent tempests and unusual tides. These we may consider as the con∣stant and certain attendants on comets. They occur so uniform∣ly with the appearance of those bodies, and for some months preceding and following, as to leave no room to question the in∣fluence from which they proceed.</P>
<P>Through the medium of such great changes in the seasons, we may rationally suppose comets must affect the health of man∣kind. Extreme and unusual heat seldom fails to produce a mul∣titude of autumnal diseases, as may be seen by the bills of mor∣tality, and as the observations of every person can verify.</P>
<P>It is obvious from the foregoing history, that one of the most certain effects of the approximation of a comet, is, a most severe winter. The almost uniform coincidence of these two phenon∣ena leaves us no room to doubt their connection. Now it is a law of the seasons, that the mean temperature of the air is nearly the same every year. This has been proved by seven years ob∣servations made at Salem by Dr. Holyoke, and published in the first part of the second volume of the Memoirs of the American Academy. Whenever therefore the cold of winter is long or severe in an unusual degree, it must be counterbalanced, in the succeeding seasons, by an extraordinary degree of heat. This may happen to be effected by long mild weather in spring and autumn; but it is more usual, that severe winters are followed by excessive heat in the summer months. In this case, the hu∣man body never fails to suffer. In such summers, bilious fevers and dysenteries are commonly numerous and violent.</P>
<P>If therefore comets do in fact produce unusually cold winters, which are necessarily preceded or followed by excessively hot summers, they may be considered as the remote cause of nume∣rous diseases.</P>
<P>But comets do most evidently occasion at times excessive drouth; and at other times, extraordinary quantities of rain; and these intemperate seasons not unfrequently succeed each other within a few months. No man can question this fact, who at∣tends to the preceding history. All such unusual seasons are apt to injure the vegetable kingdom. In too dry seasons, corn may
<PB N="81" REF="036687_0436_100AA3FAAF58C210"/>
be defective in quantity; in too wet weather, it is deficient in nourishing qualities; and in both cases, it may contain the germs of epidemic diseases.</P>
<P>That comets should affect the health of mankind in any other way, than through the means of the seasons or weather, is possi∣ble; but is not to be admitted without most indisputable evi∣dence. It is indeed certain that the oriental nations believe, and have, from high antiquity, believed these bodies to be the fore∣runners of plagues; and the enumeration of facts in the forego∣ing history, evidently confirms their opinions. That history is probably defective in accounts of comets; but imperfect as it is, it affords proof that most of the plagues which have been exten∣sive and severe, have been preceded or attended with the ap∣proach of comets.</P>
<P>From numerous facts in the history of pestilence, I am led to suspect that comets have some effect on the fire or electricity which surrounds and penetrates this globe. One of the most certain, as well as most remarkable phenomena, which attend plagues, is, earthquakes; and in general, the more severe or numerous have been the earthquakes, the more violent and destructive the plagues. This remark applies to most of the countries in Europe, where the plague has been epidemic; but is more especially true of Ita∣ly and the Syrian coast, with the whole of Asia Minor.</P>
<P>In confirmation of this remark, we need not resort to facts in ancient times, when earthquakes seem to have been more fre∣quent and violent, than in modern times. Within the present century, the shocks which have uniformly attended pestilence, leave no room to question that some connection exists between the two phenomena.</P>
<P>Now it is a fact that will appear from an inspection of the pre∣ceding history, that, during the approximation of comets to our system, earthquakes have been most numerous, general and vio∣lent. A great proportion of the tremendous eruptions of volca∣noes have happened during the same periods. To prove this, we need not go back to the terrible concussions and violent discharge of Etna, which closed the long pestilence in Athens, in the fifth
<PB N="82" REF="036687_0437_100AA43729D4C550"/>
and sixth year of the Pelopponesian war—nor to the dreadful earthquakes and eruption, which preceded the destructive plague in the reign of Titus. We have similar facts in modern times. The plagues in the Levant in 1743, and especially in Messina, were accompanied or preceded by violent earthquakes and a comet. The extensive plague of 1760, was attended with all the great phenomena—comets, eruption of Vesuvius and tremendous earth∣quakes. The pestilential periods of 1770 and 1783, were in∣troduced by the same phenomena.</P>
<P>These facts afford strong evidence that the approach of com∣ets, not only influences the weather, but also calls into action the subterranean fires. By what means those erratic bodies pro∣duce this effect, may be a curious question. That the internal fires explode at times, without the attractive powers of comets, is undoubted; but the concurrence of earthquakes and violent discharges from volcanoes, during the appearance of comets, or near the time, seems to render it certain that those bodies have a most powerful effect on the element of fire which is diffused through the globe and the surrounding atmosphere.</P>
<P>Many authors have observed the connection between comets, earthquakes and pestilence, but seem not to have included vol∣canic eruptions among the causes of disease.</P>
<P>"In coelo per quindecem dies apparens crinitum sidus siccatis plane terris attulerat; says Paulus Jovius; pestilentia quoque contagiis serpens, et in urbe et in Castris." Hist. vol. 2. 111.</P>
<P>This observation of the writer is well founded—comets sel∣dom fail to occasion a universal defect of rain and springs in some countries, and pestilence marches in the train with its other effects.</P>
<P>"Inter prognostica pestis est etiam cometes, jaculum et aliae sigurae ardentes, diutius in suprema aeris regione subsistentes." Horstius from Angelus Sala, de peste, p. 253.</P>
<P>These remarks also are justified by our own observations. They were remarkably verified in the comet, the meteor and the brilliant halo which marked the commencement of the last series of epidemics in 1788 and 1789.</P>
<P>Riverius is express to the same point. He asserts that comets
<PB N="83" REF="036687_0438_100AA3FCE1765090"/>
never appear without being followed by epidemic and pestilent diseases, and various changes in the physical world. He instan∣ces that of 1618, in his own days. The observation is verified by the testimony of all ancient writers and by a uniform series of modern facts.</P>
<P>The order of events is exemplified in the epidemic periods of 1769—and of 1782. In the first period, excessive drouth du∣ring the approach of the comet in 1769—failure of crops—fam∣in and plague and insects in 1770—volcanoes, earthquakes and tempests in 1770 and 1771—catarrh and measles in 1772—then, for several years, anginas, putrid fevers and dysenteries.</P>
<P>In the period of 1781 and 2, catarrh began the epidemics— in 1782 a universal failure of water, and of crops in India and Egypt—in 1783, volcano, famin, measles, angina and plague— 1784 a comet, followed by tempests, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Earthquakes constitute a part of the visible effects of the gen∣eral cause which produces pestilence.</P>
<P>It has sometimes happened that in these convulsions of the earth, a vapor has been extricated which has produced immedi∣ate disease. The great earthquake in South-America in 1730 was speedily followed by a pestilential fever. The destruction of Port-Royal in Jamaica in 1692 was soon succeeded by a mortal fever in all parts of the island; and the universality of the fever would lead us to suspect that vapor, in this instance, could not have been the cause. At Venice in 1343, the plague soon fol∣lowed an earthquake.</P>
<P>In the year 615, violent earthquakes in Italy were followed by "lues elephantiae." Baronius, vol. 8. 243. Baglivus re∣lates that the great earthquakes in Italy in 1703, were succeed∣ed by numerous diseases, especially opthalmia, erysipelas, mesen∣teric fevers and double tertians. In autumn, the small-pox be∣came epidemic, apoplexies were frequent and sudden deaths al∣most daily. With respect to apoplexies and sudden deaths after earthquakes, we have also the authority of Seneca.</P>
<P>Baglivus further remarks "post terraemotus frequenter suc∣cedunt pestilentia, vel morbi graves et epidemici, imo nova et inaudita morborum genera." p. 530. The idea that new and
<PB N="84" REF="036687_0439_100AA439CDD44880"/>
unknown species of diseases follow earthquakes, if well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounded, leads us to suspect that the changes in the characters of diseases are attributable to the various action of the electrical fluid.</P>
<P>The terribly destructive earthquakes in Naples and Sicily in 1693, were speedily followed by malignant fevers, tertians ac∣companied with delirium and lethargy, and the small-pox which was very fatal to children.</P>
<BIBL>Baddam's Mem. vol. 3. 91.</BIBL>
<P>"Frequent earthquakes, says Fracastorius de contagione, p. 136, announce future pestilence, and by means of exhalations, tend to produce it." Van Swieten agrees in this opinion.</P>
<P>Seneca asserts, Nat. Quest. art. 27, that pestilential diseases usually follow great earthquakes. He supposes the air, enclosed in the earth, to become vitiated, either by stagnation or through the defect of the internal fires "internorum ignium vitio." He thinks this air when forced into the atmosphere, renders it impure and unwholesome, generating new kinds of diseases. He reasons by analogy that as water corrupts by stagnation, so will air. Hence after earthquakes, "subitae continuaeque mortes et monstrosa genera morborum, ut ex novis orta causis—nec prius pestilentia definit, quam spiritum illum gravem exercuit laxitas coeli, ventorum jactatio."</P>
<P>This opinion of Seneca is certainly entitled to respect, and has been followed by many distinguished authors, Van Helmont, Van Swieten, Sydenham, Hodges, Baglivus and others.</P>
<P>But I suspect the modern discoveries will enable us to furnish a more rational solution of the phenomenon. I am inclined to believe that a superabundant stimulus, occasioned by the shock of an earthquake, and an atmosphere surcharged with electricity, will more rationally account for the apoplexies, sudden deaths, small-pox and malignant fevers. If a deleterious vapor were the cause, I should suppose its effects would be speedy, and its force soon expended, the atmosphere being speedily purified by winds. But, if stimulus is the cause, it may exist for a long time in the atmosphere, and the human body not yield to its force in many weeks or months. This would better accord with facts, for al∣tho diseases appear soon after an earthquake, yet the worst effects are often many months or a year after, as was the case in the
<PB N="85" REF="036687_0440_100AA3FE692562E0"/>
reign of Titus, when the pestilence was the year after the earth∣quake and eruption of Vesuvius.</P>
<P>There are however many authorities in favor of the vapor. Seneca relates that a vapor caused by an earthquake in Campania, destroyed six hundred sheep. Van Helmont says that "popular plagues do draw their first occasional matter from an earthquake." Page 1125.</P>
<P>The fact that a visible vapor, without an earthquake, sometimes appears suddenly in a place and evidently produces disease, is a strong confirmation of Seneca's opinion. A memorable example happened at Rouen, in 1753, as related under that year. Fores∣tus relates that an epidemic catarrh or sore throat, in Alemar, A. D. 1557, suddenly invaded 2000 persons, of whom 200 died. He ascribes it to a vapor, for the disease was preceded by thick clouds of an ill smell.</P>
<BIBL>See Van Swieten, vol. 16. p. 31.</BIBL>
<P>Mazeray relates that the black pestilence of 1347 arose in Chi∣na from a vapor, which burst from the earth with a smell most hor∣ribly offensive. This fact is cited by Boyle vol. 5. 60. in proof that pestilential diseases spring from vapors evolved from the earth. This author supposes new diseases may be generated by vapors, and remarks further that countries abounding with cinnabar escape the plague.</P>
<P>But it seldom happens that pestilential diseases can be traced directly to earthquakes. On the other hand, altho great plagues are almost invariably accompanied with shocks of the earth, yet it more usually happens that the pestilence appears before the concussion. Thus the shocks which alarmed and laid waste Ita∣ly in 1348, 1349 and 1350, were preceded by the dreadful plague of 1347.</P>
<P>Sometimes the earthquakes precede the plague, but more gen∣erally the pestilence appears first, or at least the petechial or oth∣er malignant fever, which marks the commencement of the pes∣tilence. Thus the plague of 1760 was preceded by a spotted fe∣ver in 1759, which marked the approach of the calamity; which spotted fever appeared in Syria, <HI>before</HI> the terrible earthquakes of that period.</P>
<P>In the well known plague at Oczakow in 1738 and 39, an
<PB N="86" REF="036687_0441_100AA43C78A7FB88"/>
earthquake happened about the time the disease began to abate. Van Swieten, vol. 16. 47. Such was the fact in the days of Thucydides. Numerous observations on these phenomena lead me to suspect, that the electricity which is to produce the explo∣sion, is in action for a considerable time <HI>before</HI> the shock, and that it is this <HI>previous action</HI> which occasions epidemic diseases. That is, the stimulus of fire or electricity produces sensible effects on the bodies of animals the more susceptible objects, before it does on the less susceptible substances in the bowels of the earth.</P>
<P>The earthquakes do not always occur in the seat of the pesti∣lence. I find no concussion mentioned to have happened at Lon∣don in 1665, or in the years next preceding or following; but shocks were experienced in the neighboring counties in 1665, and 1666.</P>
<P>This seems to have misled the able Diemerbroeck, who, in rea∣soning on the causes of the plague, objects to the influence of earthquakes, because no shocks occurred at Nimeguen, before the pestilence of 1636. It is probably true that earthquakes are not usually the <HI>cause</HI> of the plague; but that they have some con∣nection with the cause, I can hardly doubt. The mistakes of Diemerbroeck and others on this point seem to have arisen from considering the plague as an isolated disease, and as depending on a cause local and temporary; whereas a just view of the subject must comprehend all the diseases of increased malignity which precede the plague, very often for two or three years. Such a view also must include, among the causes of the disease, the agitations or derangement of the elements in remote parts of the country. Thus, altho no earthquake was experienced at Nime∣guen, about the time of the plague, yet a severe shock was felt at Lausanne in 1634.—Keysler's travels 190. This marked some general action of internal fire, which, tho it might not explode so as to shake all Germany, might have produced effects, by means of an insensible vapor or stimulus, in all parts of Europe. Certain it is, that for the period between 1631, the year of the tremendous eruption of Vesuvius, and the year 1637, all Eu∣rope was afflicted with mortal epidemics. The philosopher who would obtain just views of the causes, must extend his inquiries to
<PB N="87" REF="036687_0442_100AA4002F4499E8"/>
all the great phenomena, which occurred during this whole peri∣od, in all Europe at least, if not in the American hemisphere; for such a view only will comprehend the whole extent of the pestilential state of the atmosphere.</P>
<P>It must not be forgotten, that during this period from 1633 to 1637, when the plague or other desolating diseases, spread over both hemispheres, Etna was in a continual state of eruption; as it was for fifteen years, during the pestilential constitutions des∣cribed by Sydenham in his days.</P>
<P>In looking over the list of comets, and the history of earth∣quakes, I am compelled to believe the approach of comets to have no small influence on the electricity and subterranean fires of the globe. Such a vastly great proportion of the violent concussions of the earth have happened, within a few months of the appearance of comets, that no reasonable man can suppose the coincidences to be the result of accident.</P>
<P>Equally remarkable have been the coincidences in time be∣tween the appearance of comets and the explosions of volcanoes. And this fact is no trifling confirmation of my opinion, respect∣ing the influence of comets in producing earthquakes; for earthquakes and eruptions of volcanoes are often cotemporane∣ous.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It is not only during the <HI>appearance</HI> of comets, that their effects are perceived in the elements, but for many months <HI>before</HI> and <HI>after.</HI> I can testify from careful observations that the effects of that in August 1797, were very obvious, in anomalous tides, as early as the last week in May; and the inundations in England during the autumn and win∣ter following, show its effects several months after its departure. The whole history of comets and their effects warrants this conclusion. Seneca made this remark seventeen centuries ago. These are his words.</P>
<P>"Aristoteles ait, cometas significare tempestatem et ventorum intem∣perantiam atque imbrium.—Non statim cometes ortus ventos et pluvias minat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, sed <HI>totum annum suspectum facit.</HI>—"Aristotle observes that comets indicate storms and violent winds and rain.—These effects how∣ever do not immediately follow their appearance, but are to be expect∣ed, during the whole year." He then mentions that such was the fact, with the comet predicted by Aristotle and Theophrasius, and which appeared in the consulship of Paterculus and Vapiscus. Nat. Quest. lib. 7.</P>
<P>I would further observe that comets move in trajectories of an elip∣tical or parabolic form, the sun being situated in one of the foci. The time when we observe them is when they pass this part of the ellipsis. Now according to the universal law of planets, by which they describe equal area<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in equal times, their motion must be most rapid when near∣est the sun, and within our sight. Before their appearance, and after their departure, their movement is slower, than when within the so∣lar system, and they may be near the earth, many months before they enter the system or become visible. Hence their influence on the earth so long before and after their appearance.</P>
<P>It is further to be observed that many comets doubtless enter the sys∣tem and pass round the sun without ever being seen, and such as come from regions of space directly opposite to the earth, must be <HI>invisible,</HI> unless we can see them in the splendor of the sun's rays. This re∣mark is as old as Seneca and older. He relates an instance, in which Posidonious discovered a comet, in the darkness of a solar eclipse, which would not have been seen, had not the eclipse happened. Lib. 7. sect. 20.</P>
<P>Newton and Halley have made the same remark. Hence perhaps we may account for violent seasons, like the severe winter of 1780, which happened without the appearance of any comet. This is mere con∣jecture.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="036687_0443_100A89C4E09A2D18"/>I cannot however admit, that the explosions of subterranean fires, are the direct exciting cause of pestilential diseases. It is indeed ascertained, beyond all question, that periods of exten∣sive pestilence and mortality are remarkable for earthquakes and eruptions of volcanoes. But the explosions of fire do not so generally <HI>precede</HI> epidemic diseases, as to authorize the supposi∣tion that they <HI>produce</HI> those diseases. Earthquakes occur, dur∣ing the prevalence of pestilential or other mortal epidemics, but in the midst of the period, or sometimes at the conclusion.</P>
<P>Hence I deduce an opinion, that pestilence and earthquakes depend on one common cause; which excites into action the in∣ternal fires. But I suppose the action or fermentation may pre∣cede, for months and even years, the explosion in earthquakes and volcanoes and by means of an insensible vapor, or heat or electrical discharges, the elements of water and air may be essen∣tially affected, in such a manner as to impair the principles of animal and vegetable life. Whether this is a just explication of the cause, may be a question; but so many phenomena concur to authorize it, that I cannot withhold my assent to the general principle.</P>
<P>The same effect perhaps may be produced by the excessive ac∣tion of mere stimulus upon the animal system, without the infu∣sion of a deleterious vapor into the air.</P>
<P>A remarkable evidence of the effects of fire or electricity on the earth and air, before its explosion, is the extreme drouth which is often experienced over whole continents or the
<PB N="89" REF="036687_0444_100AA404C9B56D88"/>
whole world, for six and even twelve months antecedent to a great eruption of volcanoes.</P>
<P>In confirmation of my principle, that the changes in the ele∣ments producing epidemic diseases, are effected by the all-perva∣ding action of electricity, the usual appearance of meteors or celes∣tial lights, in pestilential periods, must be mentioned. For the truth of the fact, we have ample proofs in every age. The in∣stances of meteors or other celestial appearances of fire, which are recorded of pestilential periods, are so numerous, as to leave no room to question the connection between the cause of pestilence, and the fire that belongs to the system. Sometimes these fiery ap∣pearances are stationary lights in the sky, which the frightened im∣aginations of men have formed into armies ready for combat, and considered as the preludes of bloody battles. Sometimes the heavens have been filled with those small meteors, called falling or shooting stars. At other times immense globes of fire have traversed the celestial regions, and burst with a tremendous report.</P>
<P>During a plague in Vienna in 1679, says Van Swieten, vol. 16. p. 19. from Sorbait, several bluish fiery balls were seen in the air, some of which fell and sensibly increased the heat.</P>
<P>In October 1709, when the plague was in Dantzick, a blue fiery globe came from the north west and shot over the town with amazing celerity, illuminating the town and falling at the south∣ward.</P>
<BIBL>Baddam's Memoirs, vol. 6. 14.</BIBL>
<P>During the plague in Philadelphia in 1793, about the 12th of September, a meteor fell between the city and the hospital.</P>
<BIBL>Rush. p. 108.</BIBL>
<P>During the extreme heat which introduced the pestilence of the last summer, 1798, about the 9th of August, the small me∣teors or falling stars were incredibly numerous, for several nights. They almost all shot from the north-east to the south-west, and succeeded each other so rapidly as to keep the eye of a curious spectator almost constantly engaged.</P>
<P>Diemerbroeck remarks that during the summers of 1635 and 6, at the time of the severe plague in Holland, there was a vast number of ardent stars, gliding through the celestial regions and
<PB N="90" REF="036687_0445_100AA441EB078890"/>
falling to the earth. "Stellarum ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lentium in Coelo oberranti∣um magnus concursus, et in terram prolapsio." He mentions likewise almost continual flashes of light, in a serene sky, or si∣lent lightning.</P>
<P>Livy mentions that the heavens appeared to be in a flame, pre∣vious to the severe pestilence of the year <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>90 from the building of Rome.</P>
<P>A flame in the heavens is noted under the years, 733, 742 and 788, all which were pestilential. This flame is not descri∣bed, and whether it was of the species of Aurora Borealis, which extended over the celestial region, or of that species of light, or yellowish red colour, which distinguishes our modern <HI>dark days,</HI> cannot perhaps be determined. But a curious phenomenon of this kind happened in the severe winter of 1741, which was too remarkable to be passed over in silence; especially as it may pos∣sibly explain what Livy and many other historians have recorded, that at certain times, "it rained blood." The assertion is often found in historians of credit, and has by the moderns, been num∣bered among the extravagancies of popular credulity. But an appearance which would warrant such an assertion occurred in this country, and is still recollected by old people.</P>
<P>In the month of January 1741, in the midst of one of the coldest winters of this century, there was a little relaxation of the rigorous cold, during which the heavens were overcast with clouds and a little rain fell. Late at night, during this falling weather, the heavens appeared all in a flame, so bright as to illu∣minate the earth and render objects every where distinctly visi∣ble. Many people saw it and were alarmed, supposing the great day was at hand. The rain which fell during this light, had precisely the appearance of drops of blood distilling from the clouds.</P>
<P>This relation is taken from my father, who was then nineteen years old, and recollects all the circumstances more minutely than the events of the last year.</P>
<P>The well known dark day in May 1780, was distinguished by a similar light in the heavens; but not occurring in the night, it was less an object of wonder.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="036687_0446_100AA406503DFD50"/>I strongly suspect a similar phenomenon will account for those passages in many histories, which speak of raining blood, and ena∣ble us to do justice to the veracity of the writers.</P>
<P>Appearances of this kind have usually occurred in periods of pestilence, when the imaginations of men have been subject to alarm; and they have often happened during extraordinary sea∣sons. The light of 1741, was during a most severe winter, and in the most sickly period, that has occurred this century. See the London bills of mortality. In America, that winter was followed by pestilential diseases.</P>
<P>The dark day of 1780, was on the opening of spring, after a most severe winter, and altho that year was not sickly in general, yet in the year following, we had an epidemic catarrh, succeed∣ed by a series of epidemic diseases of other kinds. It is remark∣able too that on that very day began a violent eruption of mount Etna.</P>
<P>In 1716, in the month of October, happened a dark day; this was after a most severe winter in Europe. I have no ac∣count of the seasons in America, but the next winter was unusu∣ally severe, and snow fell in extraordinary quantities.</P>
<P>On the 9th of August 1732 happened another dark day. This was followed by earthquakes, a severe winter and universal catarrh.</P>
<P>The 19th of October 1762 was equally remarkable for dark∣ness, with the phenomenon of a red, or yellowish tinge in the heavens, which gave to the sun, when it appeared, the color of blood. Some rain fell during the day, and the water was of a dirty sulphurous smell. There had been two earthquakes, with epidemic catarrh, in America in 1761. In the same year with the darkness, 1762, the catarrh was epidemic in Europe; and the winter of that year was excessively severe in both hemis∣pheres. A comet appeared in 1762 and an eruption of Etna followed the severe winter, in 1763. There were earthquakes also in Asia in 1762. Who can doubt that the vapor, occa∣sioning such darkness, is the effect of the agitation of the fire of the globe?</P>
<P>Similar instances of extraordinary darkness have occurred in
<PB N="92" REF="036687_0447_100A89C86F0D93F8"/>
every age. They are mentioned in the years before Christ 366 and 295—and of the Christian era 252, 746, 775, and in ma∣ny other periods. And the reader will observe, this darkness is cotemporary with pestilence, in almost every instance. Du∣ring the plague of 746, the darkness was of several days dura∣tion —in 252 it was of three days, and in 775 of six days con∣tinuance. A similar darkness accompanied the pestilence in E∣gypt, in the days of Pharaoh. Many other instances have been mentioned in the preceding history.</P>
<P>In America, it has been customary to ascribe this unusual ap∣pearance to condensed volumes of smoke, after the burning of immense tracts of woods in the western parts of the country. But I cannot learn that any great fires have usually preceded these dark days; and negative evidence, in so many instances, amounts to proof that no great forests have been burnt. Besides, the same phenomenon has been often observed, in countries where there were no forests, as in Italy, Syria, Asia Minor and Egypt, and especially in England.</P>
<P>That the smoke of burning forests cannot be the cause may be rendered very certain by these considerations. First, the cause is not equal to the effect. Had the woods from the 40th de∣gree of latitude in America to the 50th been all consumed in a day, the smoke would not have been sufficient to cloud the sun over the territory covered by darkness on the 19th of May. Any person may judge of this who has seen large tracts of forest on fire. That thirty or forty miles of burning forest, should cover five hundred miles with impenetrable darkness, is too ab∣surd to deserve a serious refutation.</P>
<P>In the second place, the color of smoke, when elevated into high regions of the atmosphere, is very different from that of the vapor which causes the darkness on all such occasions.</P>
<P>But what decides this question is the lightning, thunder and rain, and especially the meteors that accompany these clouds of vapor. As far as I can learn, some or all of these phenomena attend dark days. Thunder was heard on the morning of the 19th of May, in most places. Mem. Am. Acad. vol. 1. 238. Violent thunder squalls and a meteor followed the great darkness
<PB N="93" REF="036687_0448_100AA407D7C8A368"/>
in Canada in 1785. These phenomena demonstrate that the clouds, on such occasion, have a connection with electricity. This is further evidenced by the smell of sulphur, in the water that falls, and the scum that is left on objects—smoke would not produce either; nor would the largest volume of smoke ever raised into the air, spread over an extensive region, a dense sub∣stance that should become visible and tangible on the earth. Be∣sides this darkness or vapor sometimes occurs in winter, when the earth is covered with snow.</P>
<P>When we connect with these facts, the circumstance that these dark days always occur, during or near the time of volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, or the unusual seasons which accompany pestilence and epidemic dieases of other kinds, we shall be at no loss to charge them to the account of the central fires, or the discharges of electricity. This accumulation of vapor is not a more surprising phenomenon, than the sudden change in the properties of the atmosphere which produces universal catarrh.</P>
<P>Hodge, who wrote on the plague of London, and who ap∣pears not to have been rewarded with celebrity equal to his mer∣its, supposes the cause of pestilential diseases to be a subtle aura, or vapor exhaled from the bowels of the earth, which has, by too much heat and humidity, lost its wholesome qualities. He says, in proof of his opinion, that a given quantity of earth, infused into water in spring, deposits more salt than at another time of the year.</P>
<P>His idea seems to be not very different from that of Van Hel∣mont, who supposes the cause of pestilence to be a gas or air, which has <HI>putrified by continuance,</HI> as the translation is; by which is meant, probably, a stagnation in the earth.</P>
<P>The doctrin of an insensible vapor, infused into the atmos∣phere from the bowels of the earth, may perhaps be thought wholly conjectural. But there are some phenomena which can hardly be resolved without resorting to the action of the electrical fluid. The sudden changes of weather cannot be accounted for, in all cases, by changes in the winds. Indeed the most reflect∣ing philosophical men acknowledge themselves puzzled to assign reasons, for many of the rapid transitions from heat to cold and
<PB N="94" REF="036687_0449_100AA443728CFE88"/>
from cold to heat. It has been suggested, that the heat may ascend and descend in the atmosphere, by means of physical laws, to us unknown; but this supposition is not supported by any clear proofs, perhaps not by rational probabilities.</P>
<P>There are many reasons which incline me to believe that the principle of fire, the most subtle, penetrating, active fluid in creation, and unquestionably the most powerful agent in all the movements of matter, passes more frequently and rapidly from the earth into the atmosphere and vice versa, than is commonly imagined. I suspect that an intimate connection subsists in this respect, between the interior of the globe, and the atmosphere which surrounds it.</P>
<P>To the rapid passing of heat from the earth to the air, and from the air to the earth, we may perhaps ascribe many of the amazing changes which take place in the temperature of the air, in a few hours, and often without a change of wind. The increase and the moderation of cold are sometimes very obvious, long before the change of winds to which we usually ascribe such changes; and I suspect that the changes of winds are more fre∣quently the <HI>effect,</HI> than the cause, of a change in the temperature.</P>
<P>But there are some appearances, in the atmosphere, previous to shocks of earthquake, which demonstrate a close connection between the atmosphere and subterranean fire. A remarkable one in this country, and generally in others, is a universal seren∣ity and tranquillity in the atmosphere. The sky is cloudless, and all nature, if at night, is wrapped in profound silence. This phenomenon is too uniform a precursor of earthquakes, to be deemed an accidental circumstance. It must be an effect of some connection between the air above, and the cause of earthquakes.</P>
<P>It is remarkable also that seamen sometimes observe a swelling of the ocean, without wind, and before any shock of the earth; and this fact, Pliny mentions among the signs of an approaching earthquake.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Is not this swelling of the ocean, previous to an earthquake, anal∣agous to the tides? May not both be ascribed to the force of electricity; the swell of the water preceding earthquakes being irregular, as depend∣ing on no regular visible cause; and the tides being more regular, as be∣ing the effect of the moon's influence on the electrical principle. This idea seems to derive some strength from the known fact that earthquakes usually happen in periods of the moon's revolution, when that orb ex∣erts its greatest influence on the earth. From numerous calculations, it appears that earthquakes usually occur near the moon's perigee or apogee or the change or conjunction of sun and moon; generally about three days before or after the conjunction—this, by the way, is the very time when epidemic diseases usually invade the patient, or come to fatal termination, according to the remarks of all modern physicians —a singular fact that may lead to important conclusions.</P>
<P>In a few instances, earthquakes happen near the full moon—the oth∣er position in which that satellite exerts more than her ordinary influ∣ence on the earth.</P>
<P>Let these facts be compared with the occurrence of violent tempests about the same time of the moon's revolution, the invasion of epidemic diseases and the full tides.</P>
<P>A strong confirmation of this opinion is derived from the swelling of the sea, just before a hurricane in the West-Indies. There is a visi∣ble intumescence, before the atmosphere is clouded, or the least breeze o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wind.

See the Addenda.</P></NOTE> The same author mentions a well known fact that
<PB N="95" REF="036687_0450_100AA40C1373B898"/>
sometime before the concussion, birds appear to be greatly agitat∣ed, and retire. In Italy, a common prelude of an earthquake is, a thin white oblong cloud or vapor, nearly resembling the color of wool. This sign was seen for several days in the year 1702, before the earthquake. The same was observed by Cas∣sini in 1668, in the same part of the heavens, the sign of the whale.</P>

<P>The evening before a violent earthquake in Sicily in 1693, a bright flame was observed, apparently about a mile distant from the spectator; this flame vanished as soon as the shock occurred.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A similar light was seen at Derby in Connecticut, in the evening preceding a local explosion of fire, about thirty years ago.</NOTE> The day succeeding the first shock, the sky was darkened, and tinged with a deep yellow.

which demolished Lisbon in 1755, were very remarkable. The water was violently agitated, buoys were broken from their chains, large vessels snapped their cables, smaller ones were thrown ashore, boats in canals were forced from their fastenings, chandaliers vibrated in the chu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hes, water in small vessels was agitated and dashed over the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and all this without any sen∣sible motion of the earth or buildings.</P>

<P>These phenomena indicate a connection between the atmos∣phere and the subterranean fire, which is altogether invisible, and to men, imperceptible. We perceive nothing, before the shock but universal serenity and calm; but the delicate senses of the fowls of heaven are affected; they fly about in a fright and ap∣pear to want the usual support from the air. The waters of the ocean also swell, altho no concussion of the earth or water can be perceived. Do not these phenomena indicate, either a want of the usual weight or elasticity of the air? Or what defect is there in the mass of air surrounding the earth, which is to be supplied by an explosion of subterranean fire? That there is a connection or dependence of the fire above on that beneath the earth, and that this subtle fluid acts and reacts between the earth and the air, with a rapidity and a force beyond all calculation, is to me extremely probable. The appearances that precede earthquakes indicate, that the fire which is to produce the shock, is in vio∣lent action, for a considerable time, before the shock. For sev∣eral days before the earthquake at Oxford, Sept. 17, 1683, ignes fatui, luminous appearances, were frequently seen.</P>

<P>The various sounds or noises which precede and attend earth∣quakes, are a strong confirmation of these ideas. The usual premonitory sound is compared to the rattling of carriages on a pavement. Sometimes it is described, as the rumbling of distant thunder. But in truth the sound is different at different distances, and resembles no other sound in nature. It is alto∣gether sui generis. It is most analogous, when near, to the rat∣tling sound from a near explosion of the electrical fluid; as those can testify who have been near the place where lightning has fal∣len upon objects. It bears no resemblance at all to any artificial sounds, made by the explosions of gun-powder, or other human contrivances. It is most unquestionably the effect of the elec∣trical fluid, rushing from one part of our system to another— probably from the earth to the atmosphere, to restore the equili∣brium, which has been, by some means, destroyed, or to answer other unknown purposes. This idea corresponds with the mod∣ern theory of earthquakes, which ascribes them to the electrical fluid. See the Encyclopedia, art. earthquake. Let it be ob∣served that at sea, no sound precedes an earthquake; water be∣ing a good conductor of electricity.</P>
<P>Eruptions of volcanoes have also been preceded many weeks by a visible fog or vapor, suspended over the mountain, as hap∣pened before the great discharges of Heckla in 1783. To what cause shall we ascribe this, but to the action of fire which pre∣cedes the explosion? And if a visible vapor may be extricated by this action, for <HI>months</HI> before the explosion, of which we have <HI>certain</HI> evidence, why may we not suppose, a smaller action or force to expel an invisible vapor, in any place and at any time?</P>
<P>Other facts authorize this conjecture. On the 12th of Sep∣tember 1784, the water of the Loch Tay in Scotland, suddenly receded 300 feet and left the channel dry; then returned; con∣tinuing this vibration for every seven minutes for two hours, and at the same hour in the day, for a week, with less violence.

No wind was stirring, and no visible cause could be assigned for this novel phenomenon. To what cause shall we resort for a solution, but to the invisible en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y of electrical fire?</P>
<BIBL>Sinclair, vol. 6. 623.</BIBL>
<P>If we admit then the action of electricity to be the cause of earthquakes, we shall have reached the general proximate cause of those epidemic diseases which speedily succeed concussions of the earth. The cause must be the action of fire, the most ener∣getic principle in nature. The manner in which this effect is produced, whether by forcing an unwholesome vapor from the interior of the earth, and vitiating the atmosphere; or whether by simply changing, on mechanical principles, the proportion of oxygen contained in atmospheric air, or by mere stimulus or other unknown means, is a question of a curious nature, and worthy of philosophic investigation.</P>
<P>One thing is very evident, that what I denominate a <HI>pestilen∣tial principle,</HI> does, at certain times, pervade not only the ele∣ment of air, but the water also. The proofs of this are abun∣dantly numerous and convincing. In all the great plagues which have afflicted the human race, other animals, as horses, cattle, sheep, sometimes cats, dogs and fowls, together with the fish in rivers and the ocean, and even vegetables, have borne their share in the calamity. The pestilential principle has extended to every species of life. The beasts of the field perish with deadly epi∣demics; the fish die on the bottom of rivers and the sea, or be∣come lean and sickly; while corn is blasted on the most fertile plains, and the fruits in gardens and orchards, wither or fail to arrive at their usual state of perfection.</P>
<P>In the destructive plague which desolated Italy in the time of Romulus, Plutarch and Zonaras mention a general sterility of the earth; the very trees were affected, and all nature appeared to be defective in its powers of production.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the pestilential period, in the reign of Justinian, Baronius states that corn was deficient in quantity, and defective in its nourishing qualities.</P>
<P>About the year 1600, crops failed in all parts of Europe; as they did in both hemispheres, about the close of the last centu∣ry.
<PB N="99" REF="036687_0454_100A89DF003C0730"/>
Such was the case in 1740, in some parts of Europe; and in 1766. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of grain in India in 1770, and in 1783 and 1789, are still remembered; and in some of these instances, the crops failed, at the same time, in China, India, Europe and America.</P>
<P>When excessive rains or dry seasons precede this failure of crops, men are at no loss to assign the cause; altho, in these ca∣ses, they may sometimes mistake the true cause. But it often happens that grain fails of its usual perfection, in seasons appa∣rently the most temperate and favorable. Observing farmers re∣mark that, in certain years, when blast or mildew is expected from intemperate weather, grain proves to be good; at other times, the grain will shrink very much, under a series of weather apparently the most propitious. This has been observed in Fair∣field county, in Connecticut, where the excellent lands formerly produced great crops of wheat, with as much certainty as any other grain; but within a few years past, wheat has failed, with∣out any apparent cause. In some cases, the farmer scarcely re∣ceives his seed, altho the seasons are favorable and no insect ap∣pears.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The same was the case in all the eastern states for three or four years; but in this summer, 1799, the wheat has every where a full grain.</NOTE></P>
<P>The failure of certain species of fruit-trees and shrubs is a fact equally remarkable.</P>
<P>Some kinds of apple, for a few years past, have been small, knotty and sprinkled over with specks.</P>
<P>The plum-tree has become full of warts, or bulbous excres∣cences, which kill the tree, and in some parts of our country, bid fair to extinguish the species. These have been suspected to proceed from a fly or small worm; but on examination by a mi∣croscope, I find reason to question this fact. Some of the ex∣crescences contain a small white worm, about a line in length; but they perforate the wood after the excrescence is formed, as appears by their path; and some of these warts contain no insect whatever. The insect therefore finds a nidus in the excrescence, but is rather an effect, than a cause. The bursting of the bark is a disease, which seems to have begun or been very much in∣creased, during the present pestilential period.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="036687_0455_100A89E1C5683378"/>The peach-tree has, within a few years, been particularly sub∣ject to be destroyed by a worm, which attacks it just below the surface of the earth, and separates the bark from the wood. If this is a common evil, still the vast increase of it, at particular periods, is among the phenomena of pestilence. The locust is perishing by a similar malady.</P>
<P>Cotemporary with these diseases of the plum and the peach, has been a distemper of the pear, usually called the pound pear, one of the most delicious of the species. For eight or ten years past, that fruit has been, universally in the part of the country to which my observations have extended, subject to a blast, from a species of rust which covers a large portion of its surface. In my own garden, not one in five is fit to eat; but I have seen one gentleman in a neighboring town, who thinks the pear is begin∣ning to recover.</P>
<P>The universal death of the prim is a phenomenon still more extraordinary, and a most severe calamity. The town of East-Hampton on Long-Island, lost, in two or three years, two hun∣dred miles of hedge—a greater loss, says Mr. L. Hommidieu, in a paper published among the transactions of the New-York Agricultural Society, than if every house in the town had been burnt to the ground; as no proper substitute for fences has yet been discovered. The English black thorn has been tried, but has failed, owing to a fly that perforates the bark.</P>
<BIBL>See part 2. 103.</BIBL>
<P>The cause of the death of the prim is not known, nor the precise time when it began. But in Connecticut the failure was observed about twenty-five years ago; between the years 1770 and 1777, during the prevalence of the terrible angina and dys∣entery among men. It contiuned gradually to extend for some years, and the prim has at last totally disappeared.</P>
<P>It is remarkable that these diseases among corn, fruit-trees and shrubs have generally, if not always, appeared first on the At∣lantic shore, and gradually extended themselves into the interior country. This is an observation made by many men in different parts of Connecticut. May we not from this circumstance, de∣duce an argument, that the <HI>infection is imported!!!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="036687_0456_100A8A8564621E10"/>But these phenomena are not <HI>new</HI> in the world; they are new only to people who do not read. Aveienna, the Arabian phy∣sician, an author of great celebrity, says, that "the state of air, called corrupt, either impedes the growth of plants or cov∣ers them with rust." Diemerbroeck, de peste, p. 40. 41, enu∣merates, among the effects of a pestilential air, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e corruption of grain and fruits, the production of mice and noxious insects which corrode and devour the corn; the sterility of the earth, which fails to yield the usual quantity of grain and fruits. He takes notice also of another fact, which is, the unusual dispo∣sition to putrefaction in all kinds of fish, flesh and vegetables, during pestilence. This putrefaction, is, by the moderns, consid∣ered as a fruitful source of diseases. In some cases it may be so; but it is always an <HI>effect</HI> of the same cause which produces epidemics.</P>
<P>Another remarkable fact to prove the universality of the pesti∣lential principle, is the sickness and death of fish in rivers and the sea. Several examples are recorded in ancient history. See the years 590, 994, 1240 and others. The number however of such facts is not great, in the old books; and whenever this phenomenon occurred, it was ascribed to frost, to a battle among the fish, or other improbable cause.</P>
<P>In modern times we have many examples recorded, but prob∣ably many others have escaped observation; or been considered as things of no moment to mankind; for within a century past, the opinion that the plague is propagated, in northern climates, by contagion only, seems to have suspended all rational enquiries into the cause of the disorder.</P>
<P>That the fish on the British coast or in the rivers, perished, during the last great plague in 1665, I find no where related, in a manner to render the fact certain; but I find Hodge has men∣tioned a fact of that sort as a proof that pestilence is occasioned by an unwholesome vapor from the earth.</P>
<P>The death of the haddock on the coast of Norway in 1789, has been already mentioned, but as there were many shocks of earthquake in Scotland, about that period, it is not impossible that the haddock might have been suddenly killed by some concus∣sion
<PB N="102" REF="036687_0457_100A8A87B47F1E10"/>
of the water. A similar event took place on the American coast, in the great earthquake of November 1755, when some whales and multitudes of cod were killed, and seen afterwards floating on the water. I throw all such cases out of the question, and confine myself to the sickness and death of fish, when there has been no concussion of the waters, to occasion a violent death.</P>
<P>The disappearance of the blue-fish from Nantucket, in 1764, just after the great mortality among the Indians, is a remarkable fact. Not less singular was the sickness and extinction of the Wellfleet oysters in 1775, the year of a fatal dysentery in Amer∣ica. Still more remarkable was the sickness or ill-state of the cod-fish taken on the banks of Newfoundland in the year 1788. They were thin, unfit for use and when preserved, turned to a blue or dark color.</P>
<P>Aristotle remarked that no one pestilential disease appears to affect all kinds of fish; but that these animals are subject to sick∣ness, which is known by their being thin, and not changing their colors.</P>
<BIBL>De Hist. Animal. lib. 8. ca. 20.</BIBL>
<P>But to come still nearer to the present time. In the years 1793 and 4, the oysters on the coast of Connecticut and Rhode-Island, were all sickly, watery, and tasteless; wholly unfit for food, and in some instances, brought on nausea or sickness in those who ate of them. This was the very time when the scar∣latina was spreading over the country, with malignant dysentery and typhus.</P>
<P>The shad which came to the New-York market in the spring of 1796, which was the period of pestilence in New-York, were leaner than usual, and perished, in defiance of the powers of salt.</P>
<P>In 1797, multitudes of small dead fish floated down James river in Virginia. It is remarkable that in the summer following, all the country from Norfolk to Philadelphia, the very latitudes through which that river passes, was very sickly; Norfolk, Bal∣timore and Philadelphia were all afflicted with the bilious plague.</P>
<P>I have been informed, that many dead shad were seen to float down the Susquehanna, in June 1798; but of the fact, I have not satisfactory evidence.</P>
<P>The reader cannot fail to remark here, the correspondence in

place between the epidemic diseases in the water and the air; the fish and the human race, in <HI>contiguous</HI> regions, being diseased about the <HI>same time</HI>—a fact too remarkable to be permitted to es∣cape particular observation.</P>
<P>The mortal pestilence among cats, in Europe and America, in 1797, is a fact too well known to be repeated. The sickly state of the water in the wells of New-Haven, during the pes∣tilential period of 1795; was evidenced by the number of ani∣malculae it contained.</P>

<P>Sorbait relates that in the time of the plague at Vienna, I sup∣pose in 1679, a fountain in the suburbs, which had been es∣teemed for the salubrity of its waters, exhaled a stench which appeared to increase the mortality in the vicinity. Van Swieten Vol. 16. 47. It is probable that Sorbait has mistaken the ef∣fect of this stench; it is probable the great mortality in the vi∣cinity and the impurity of the water proceeded both from one source, an uncommon effusion of subterranean vapor in that particular quarter, or other unknown cause.</P>
<P>All these phenomena denote a pestilential cause in water as well as air. Whether that cause is a positive substance infused in∣to the elements from subterranean regions, increasing the due proportion of oxygen; whether it is a negative state of the ele∣ments, occasioned by the abstraction of oxygen; or whether it is occasioned simply by a chemical alteration in the elements, by the mechanical operation of the electric fluid, which may pro∣duce new properties in air and water, by means of new combina∣tions of their parts, are questions not easily solved. But with∣out attempting to penetrate into the mysteries of nature, and un∣fold primary causes, we may be certain of their effects, and from this branch of knowledge, may deduce useful conclusions.</P>
<P>We know, for we see, the effects of some mortal principle, which, at particular periods, destroys or impairs the usual powers of life, through the animal and vegetable kingdoms. We ration∣ally conclude that this cause must be general, affecting the ele∣ments of life, over whole regions of the earth, and beneath the
<PB N="104" REF="036687_0459_100AA4458705E9A0"/>
waters of the ocean. Of so much we are certain. As to the primary or remote causes, we shall probably remain in the dark— and as to the proximate causes, we can only indulge a rational spirit of philosophical enquiry, that may lead to probabilities.</P>
<P>Sydenham is among the most respectable authorities for the doc∣trin of a change in the properties of air from a subterraneous va∣por. His words are, vol. 1. p. 8. Wallis's Edit. "There are various general constitutions of years, that owe their origin neither to heat, cold, dryness nor moisture; but depend rather on a certain secret and inexplicable alteration in the bowels of the earth, whence the air becomes impregnated with such kinds of effluvia, as subject the human body to particular distempers, so long as that kind of constitution prevails, which after a cer∣tain course of years, declines and gives way to another."</P>
<P>The reader will recollect that when the plague first broke out in Athens, the people alledged that their enemies had poisoned the wells. In the mortal plague of 1349, the Germans suspec∣ted the Jews had poisoned the wells, and vented their rage upon the harmless Israelites. These suspicions doubtless arose from the bad quality of the waters, similar to what was observed in New-Haven in 1795: And the suspicion of poison was full as well founded, as the modern doctrin of importation, in most cases of pestilence.</P>
<P>The death of fish in rivers and the ocean, is one of the strong∣est arguments to prove the cause of pestilence to be a subtle va∣por, expelled or exhaled from subterranean regions. That fish do in fact die of epidemic diseases, is a fact as well authentica∣ted and as certain, as that epidemic diseases affect the human race —and it is equally certain that such mortality among the fish, is usually cotemporary with pestilence among men, on the adja∣cent shores. From these facts, we are powerfully inclined to believe, the general cause which affects the one species of animals, to be the same which affects the other species. This conclusion is easy, natural and irresistible.</P>
<P>What then can be the principle which penetrates the waters, and reaches the animal functions of fish and oysters on the bot∣tom of the sea? Can it be a vitiated state of the superincumbent
<PB N="105" REF="036687_0460_100AA448E177EEA0"/>
atmosphere? Can a deleterious principle, belonging to the air, find its way through a mass of water, and destroy life, as effectu∣ally as in its natural fluid, on the surface of the earth? These are questions, I pretend not to solve. But cannot help thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>king that the only efficient cause, within our narrow comprehension, capable of extending the principle of destruction through the different elements, is the all-pervading energy of fire or electricity. The modus operandi is among the impenetrable arcana of the physical world.</P>
<P>It may not be useless to introduce here an observation made by elderly people in America, that in sickly years, the aurora bo∣realis does not appear. It is certain that during the present pes∣tilential period, since 1790, that phenomenon has never been observed, at least not in any distinguished degree of brightness.</P>
<P>But the history of the aurora borealis does not warrant the justness of this observation, as a general fact. The years 1564 and 5, which were distinguished by northern lights, were sickly in Europe, and in many parts raged the plague. The same lights were very splendid in November 1575, a year when the plague was spreading over Europe with unusual violence and mortality. The same were repeatedly observed in 1580, the year of a most severe universal catarrh, when the plague raged in Paris, and when Cairo lost 500,000 people by the same disease. These lights were again visible in 1621, and described by Gassendus in France, who it is said gave them the name of <HI>aurora borealis.</HI> That year was noted for a most fatal epidemic small-pox and the Hungarian fever in Europe; and the plague which raged among the Indians in America in 1618, had not ceased in 1621.</P>
<P>From this time to the year 1707, we have no account of the appearance of these lights. In that year, they appeared, but not of a remarkable brightness. If these lights appeared in this long interval, from 1621 to 1707, it is strange that astronomers should have left us no account of them. Certain it is, that the great Halley never saw this phenomenon till the year 1716, when he was 60 years old, and he began to despair of ever beholding it. During this long suspension of the aurora borealis, epidemic pestilential diseases occurred very often in both hemispheres.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="036687_0461_100AA44B288CA168"/>In the same interval, these lights were never seen in America; and our ancestors, when they first beheld them, at the beginning of this century, supposed them a new phenomenon in creation; the memory of them having been lost.</P>
<P>In 1719, in November, appeared these lights; which was at the commencement of a sickly period of great severity and extent —the plague was then raging in the Levant. A splendid phe∣nomenon of the same kind was observed in Feb. 1720, the most unhealthy year of that period. The same in the three following years, and in 1725, 1726, 1728, 1730, repeatedly in 1733, a sickly year, repeatedly in 1735 and 36, very sickly years, when the mortal sore throat prevailed—also in 1737.</P>
<P>From these facts, we conclude that the cause of pestilential diseases, has no connection with these visible phenomena of the electrical fluid, as they are observed indifferently in healthy or sickly years. It is evident however that the lumen boreale, is, in a certain degree, periodical.</P>
<P>Let us attend now to the effects of a pestilential state of air and water, in the production of insects and small animals. This is one of the most remarkable symptoms of a sickly state of the elements, and it is the more necessary to insist on this phenome∣non, because it is visible to every eye, and carries with it, du∣ring pestilence, a demonstration of the doctrines for which I contend.</P>
<P>In the threshold of the history of plagues, we meet with ac∣counts of myriads of noxious insects, accompanying these ca∣lamities. The ten plagues of Egypt are numbered among the miraculous interposi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions of providence, in favor of his chosen people. But so far as regards most of those plagues, we find, by subsequent events, they are usual occurrenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s during pestilen∣tial periods. Such are swarms of insects c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>led in scripture flies and lice, and especially locusts, which, at this day and in every age, are generated, in unhealthy periods, in such m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers as to darken the sun, when on the wing, and which often devour ev∣ery species of plants, and even the bark of trees. These ani∣mals seem to have their origin in the desarts of Arabia, border∣ing on Egypt and Syria; but they have often overspread all Pal∣estine, Judea and Italy—sometimes they have penetrated into
<PB N="107" REF="036687_0462_100AA4502D6CB920"/>
Germany, Poland and Russia. It is unnecessary here to enume∣rate the instances related in the foregoing history, of the rava∣ges of these animals; the reader has observed that instances of their appearance have often occurred in different periods, and that they are always the harbingers or the companions of the plague.</P>
<P>This fact leaves no room to question, that the same state of air in the oriental regions, which will generate epidemic dis∣eases, will often produce those animals in unusual numbers. They do not indeed always attend the plague; the particular season most favorable to their generation is an excessively dry one; but it is obvious, that they rarely appear in desolating swarms, except in periods when the neighboring countries are afflicted with mortal epidemics.</P>
<P>It is true that, in two or three instances, history informs us, dreadful plagues have originated from the putrefaction of these animals—the instance of the pestilence on the African coast, about 126 years before the Christian era, is memorable. But while this fact is not disputed, we must observe that the same pe∣riod was distinguished for pestilence in other countries, where no such local or particular cause existed. Great swarms of locusts therefore in the eastern countries, <HI>may</HI> be the cause of pestilen∣tial diseases, but always by accident; whereas they are certainly the forerunners or companions of that calamity.</P>
<P>See the years 394, 590, 677, 1031, 1084, 1091, 1186, 1234, 1337, 1476, 1646 and 7. Also before the Christian era, the locusts of the year 206 and 174.</P>

<P>During a most mortal period, about the year 590, an inunda∣tion deluged Rome, and such multitudes of serpents were brought down the stream and lodged on the champaign country, as to occasion a great stench and contribute to the subsequent mortality.</P>
<P>Worms and myriads of flies and other noxious animals are mentioned, in the foregoing history, as the attendants on pesti∣lence. See the years 763, 1001, 1106, 1234, 1286, 1348, 1390, 1575, 1598, 1610 and 12.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="036687_0463_100AA44D5F60BED0"/>Lord Bacon informs us that during a plague in his time, there were found in the ditches and low grounds about London, a species of animals which he calls <HI>toads,</HI> with tails two or three inches long—a kind of animals doubtless which we often see in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> waters, but of larger size.

<P>The commencement of the present pestilential state in Amer∣ica was distinguished by an unusual plenty of shad, of which fourteen thousand were caught at one draft of a seine, near the harbor of New-York.

<P>The plague of 1635 and 6 in Holland was accompanied or preceded by an incredible number of insects, as gnats, butterflies, beetles, wasps, grass-hoppers, but especially flies, which were so numerous, as to cover the ceilings of houses, and even to obscure the sun in the open air.</P>

<P>The year 1633, which produced a pestilential fever among the settlers at Plymouth in America, was remarkable for swarms of large flies, which filled the woods with their humming sounds.</P>
<P>In the month of August, during a dreadful drouth at Bengal in 1770, which cut short the rice-crops and produced a terrible famin, and subsequent epidemic fever, the air was filled with a
<PB N="109" REF="036687_0464_100AA451B3FAF220"/>
cloud of insects, of the size of a horse-stinger, with a long red body and large head; they continued to obscure the sun for some days, during which all toads, frogs and insects on the earth dis∣appeared, but this cloud in the air did not descend to the earth. The next year, a million of people perished with epidemic diseases.</P>
<P>The present pestilential period in America was introduced by such multitudes of canker-worms and palmer-worms, as were never before known. Musquetoes have been the harbingers and attendants on the diseases in New-York and Philadelphia in 1793, 1795 and 1798. In this latter year, the whole country has been overspread with grass-hoppers, which very much injured the meadows, pastures and gardens.</P>
<P>On these facts I will just remark, that they serve to confirm the historical truth of the scriptures. The whole series of facts, relative to the great plagues that have afflicted mankind, is a tis∣sue of proofs, that the history of the ten plagues of Egypt was written on the spot, and is a faithful record of facts. If the op∣erations of nature are uniform, the scriptures cannot be a spuri∣ous production. They describe Egypt and Syria, as to every thing respecting climate and productions, precisely as they are at this day; and this fact is alone sufficient to establish their au∣thenticity, against all the infidels on earth.</P>
<P>It may be impossible to define precisely those qualities of air and water which favor the production of unusual multitudes of any particular sort of insects. It has been customary for writers to ascribe them to <HI>putrefaction</HI> in the air; an indefinite and un∣intelligible term. It is true that musquetoes and some other in∣sects are generated in hot, moist, stagnant air, and in marshy places, when the putrefaction of vegetable and animal substances, is uncommonly rapid. But they are produced in pure water, al∣so, without any apparent mixture of vegetable matter, beyond what is common to all water.</P>
<P>Flies, on the contrary, are most numerous in a hot and dry season. Moisture is hostile to their existence; and in the year 1795, when the rainy season commenced about the 20th of July, preceding the fever in New-York, the flies almost wholly disap∣peared, and were succeeded by musquetoes. Putrid substances
<PB N="110" REF="036687_0465_100AA45462569E70"/>
are the food of flies, but the seasons most favorable to putrefac∣tion, do not always produce flies in the greatest numbers.</P>
<P>In short, it is not possible to account for the myriads of in∣sects which appear in particular years, on any known principles of the animal economy, or any visible properties of air and wa∣ter. If unusual numbers of a particular insect appear periodical∣ly, as in case of the canker-worms, tho I have not satisfactory evidence of the regularity of <HI>their</HI> appearance, in uniform peri∣ods, we should naturally conclude such animals to pass through other forms of existence, and to re-appear in a particular noxious form, at the end of definite intervals of time. But were this the fact, it would still remain a problem of a most embarrassing difficulty, to discover the reason of their appearance in unhealthy periods only. For such is the fact, with most of the insects, and their transmigration, if admitted, will not in the least help us to account for their existence, in those times only when the state of the air is unfriendly to human life.</P>
<P>But in truth, as to most of the noxious insects which mark pe∣riods of epidemic diseases, we know them not to change their forms of existence, nor are the times of their appearance, peri∣odical. On the other hand, we observe they appear in sickly pe∣riods; and in unusual numbers, at no other time. We conclude therefore that a state of the elements, unfriendly to the health of man, is favorable to the generation of noxious insects, but with∣out attempting to explain the particular properties of the elements, which possess that prolific power.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">May it not be the effect of excitement, owing to unusual electrical stimulus?</NOTE> All I contend for, by these facts, is, that the pestilential principle, whatever may be its na∣ture or properties is a <HI>general</HI> principle, affecting all the elements of life, and that to this general cause are we to ascribe the delete∣rious diseases which, at times, spread over extensive regions of the earth. Under this just and philosophical view of the subject, in∣fection sinks to a very trifling consideration, among the causes of epidemic distempers.</P>
<P>The order in which insects and diseases appear, is not uniform; but it usually happens that the insects are the first in order of time. This was the fact in 1770, when the flies clouded the heavens in
<PB N="111" REF="036687_0466_100AA455ECAF3968"/>
Bengal, and the worms darkened the earth in America. Such was the fact in 1791 when canker-worms in June gave to our orchards the aspect of winter. But the whole progress of epi∣demics is more or less marked by noxious and troublesome insects.</P>
<P>In 1798 and 1799, the meadows in some parts of Connecti∣cut have been almost covered with small toads, of the size of a chesnut, and as described by Fernelius, "coloris cineritii," of the color of ashes. These animals, in such numbers, are unusu∣al —they are not of the color of the common toad, and never grow to the same size. They come suddenly and in a few weeks disappear! Who knows their origin or their end? Fernelius numbered them, more than two centuries ago, among the presa∣ges of pestilence, and we are witnesses to the truth of his obser∣vation.</P>
<P>If we attend to the state of a pestilential air, in respect to its effects on inanimate objects, we are furnished with further proofs, that epidemic diseases are the production, not of fomites from the sick, but of a general deleterious principle.</P>
<P>A remarkable instance of the corrupt or defective state of air, happened in the mortal plague of the year 252. See the descrip∣tion of it under that year. It covered objects with what the his∣torian calls "ros tabidus," a putrid corrupt dew or mould. A state of air so extremely imperfect must have been utterly insuffi∣cient to support healthy life, in the animal system.</P>
<P>The air of New-York in 1795 produced astonishing effects in the generation of mould, and the rapidity in the process of pu∣trefaction, in flesh and vegetables, was almost incredible.</P>
<P>The fatal angina maligna among cattle in 1682 was attended with a blue mist or dew on the herbage of pastures. See the de∣scription of it under that year.</P>
<P>It is not an unfrequent thing that a visible and offensive mist or fog arises in places, during the rage of pestilential diseases. Such a mist arose and spread over Dantzick, in August 1709, during the plague. This fog was so thick as to darken the air, for some time, and had a very offensive smell.</P>
<BIBL>Baddam's Mem. vol. 6. 14.</BIBL>
<P>Schreibner, cited by Van Swieten, Vol. 16. mentions that a small cloud often hangs over the infected place. It is suggested
<PB N="112" REF="036687_0467_100AA458EE4C3FC8"/>
by that able author, that the contagion, collected into such a cloud, may be dispersed by winds, and afterwards collect at a different place. It is however more probable, that such collections of im∣pure vapor, are produced where they exist; and that, if once dispersed, the particles are not afterwards collected. The phe∣nomenon however is no inconsiderable evidence, that a pestilential state of the atmosphere, is caused or increased by vapors exhaled from the bowels of the earth.</P>
<P>In the mortal pestilence at Rome A. U. C. 576, Livy men∣tions a bow extended over the temple of Saturn, three mock∣suns, and in the evening following, many transient meteors.</P>
<BIBL>Lib. 41. 21.</BIBL>
<P>A similar fog or vapor during easterly winds, appeared in New-York, in September 1798, in the most fatal period of the plague. Persons who felt and saw it, describe it as most disa∣greeable to the senses; and its effects were very remarkable. The pavements of the streets and other objects were covered with a coat of dew or mould, not however exactly resembling either of those substances; not unlike perhaps the "ros tabidus," or "ros sanci similis," of the year 252. Its effects were equally wonderful on the leaves of trees, which were covered with spots, which appeared as if corroded by an acid. And I have seen a cotton garment, which had been washed, and hung out on the night of the fog, which was also covered with spots of a dark, grey color, and which could not be taken out by any pro∣cess of washing. During this period also, iron railings and pump-handles were suddenly covered over with scales of rust, or a ferruginous color. These phenomena correspond with the effects of the pestilential air at Oczakow in 1739, in which sur∣gical instruments became livid or black, as did the silver hilt of a sword.</P>
<P>These recent facts which have come under my own observa∣tion, have enabled me to give due credit to historians, who men∣tion spots in garments, appearing suddenly, during the plague. The writers who mention this phenomenon were mostly monks or other ecclesiastics, whose relations are highly tinged with su∣perstition; and as their imaginations have usually wrought up these appearances into the figure of a cross, or other chimerical
<PB N="113" REF="036687_0468_100AA45BDDC35AB0"/>
form, and ascribed to them some miraculous qualities, I had passed over the passages with very slight consideration.</P>
<P>I have however transcribed or rather abridged one of these accounts, under the head of plagues in the reign of Justinian. It is from Warnefred, who relates that in the pestilence at Li∣guria, the Genoese territory, there appeared suddenly "quaedam signacula," certain signs or spots, on doors of houses, garments and utensils which could not be washed out, but grew brighter by washing. See the account in the foregoing history, under the description of the plagues between 542 and 600. I recollect reading several other accounts of similar phenomena, which, for the reasons just assigned, I neglected to transcribe when the au∣thors were before me, which I now regret.</P>
<P>The celebrated Boyle mentions similar phenomena during pes∣tilence, and particularly an instance in Naples in the year 1660, which happened after an eruption of Vesuvius, and which he ascribes to a vapor. The vapor, he remarks, made impressions of curious figures on garments; and he cites Thuanus and Kir∣cher, as authorities for his opinion. See vol. 5. p. 60.</P>
<P>In the dreadful plague of 746, similar figures appeared on the garments of people, which the writer calls cruciculae, little cros∣ses, which seemed as if drawn in oil. These marks excited no small terror, wherever they appeared.</P>
<BIBL>Paulus Diaconus, Aug. History, p. 1012.</BIBL>
<P>Similar figures were impressed on the bodies of the men who were employed by Julian to rebuild Jerusalem in 362 or 3, and who were driven from their work by earthquakes and eruptions of fire. From these facts we may be led to ascribe the forma∣tion of such spots to some electrical process, or combination with an acid.</P>
<P>These phenomena indicate a peculiar state of the air, which is not common even during pestilence. It is a state which marks the highest degree of derangement in its ordinary healthful qual∣ities, and such, as blessed be God, does not often occur.</P>
<P>Another strong proof of the doctrin here maintained of a pes∣tilential principle in the elements, is the well known fact, that du∣ring the plague, fowls abandon the atmosphere of the infected places.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="036687_0469_100AA45D65209BB0"/>Livy mentions that in the terrible plague in Rome, anno urbis conditae 571, not a vulture was to be seen for two years.</P>
<P>Dr. Gottwald remarks that in the Dantzick plague of 1709, sparrows, daws, storks and swallows deserted the place for four months. Dr. Schelwig has recorded a similar fact; and Sorbait affirms that birds deserted Vienna during the plague. Those kept in cages died.</P>
<P>Diemerbroeck has informed us that in the Holland plague of 1635 and 6 birds were unusually rare. He remarks that birds more readily perceive the poisonous state of the air, and change their residence to places more salubrious, even abandoning their nests and their young. The same fact has been observed by many med∣ical and historical writers.</P>
<P>The ancient physician and compiler of medical science, Aetius, mentions, among the signs of approaching pestilence, the death of birds and quadrupeds. If, says he, the circumambient air is the cause of the disease, it will first show its effects in destroying birds; if vitious exhalations from the earth, are the cause, quad∣rupeds will be first affected.</P>
<P>The fact goes to demonstrate that the pestilential principle per∣vades the aerial fluid and is offensive to the delicate organs of fowls. It may be further mentioned, that the deleterious principle is often fatal to small birds in cages, before it is perceived by the human race. It is a curious and well authenticated fact, that in the prog∣ress of a plague, in cities, small birds sicken and die; and not long after, the people in the same house, are seized with the pesti∣lence. Diemerbroeck was frequently an eye-witness to the fact, and he observed, that wherever the small birds died in cages, the plague never failed, sometime after and often in two or three days, to attack the inhabitants of the dwelling. This is another proof amounting to demonstration, that the pestilential principle is a quality of the atmosphere, and that it is <HI>progressive in its malig∣nity,</HI> having little or no dependence on the powers of contagion.</P>
<BIBL>See Diem. de peste, p. 11.</BIBL>
<P>After all, the cause of violent and destructive epidemic disea∣ses may remain a secret. We see the causes of the ordinary dis∣eases of the seasons, in marshes, stagnant waters, confined air, and the like; but it often happens that pestilence commits most
<PB N="115" REF="036687_0470_100AA460977E1190"/>
cruel ravages, in seasons apparently the most temperate, and in places evidently the most salubrious.</P>
<P>The plague in 542, and in subsequent periods of the fifty years plague of Evagrius, ascended to the tops of the hills and mountains. The terrible plague of 252, in the reign of Gal∣lus and Volusian, invaded every village and almost every house. The deadly plague of 1348 penetrated likewise to the most healthy spots on the globe and even to the regions of Greenland, sweeping away the human race, with undistinguishing severity.</P>
<P>Hildanus informs us that in the plague of Lausanne, in 1613, the huts of the peasants on the hills and mountains were not ex∣empt from the malady, tho detached and having no intercourse with the infected. The same fact is recorded of the plague in 1720, which extended to the villages and mountains of Provence.</P>
<P>In the Traitè de la peste, p. 29, it is asserted that in the melancholy plague at Lyons in 1628, the filthiest houses, the crouded places, narrow streets and confined apartments, were places of the most safety; while the most airy situations, as hou∣ses on hills, were most exposed to the ravages of the disorder. No place was exempt—the change of air was useless or perni∣cious; in some cases, those who enjoyed health in the impure air of the city, on removing into the country, were attacked with the malady. Malouin declares that the most populous and dirty places in Lyons and Marseilles were least affected with the plague.</P>
<P>These facts are very singular; yet it is not difficult to account for them, on the principle of a superabundance of oxygen, stim∣ulus, or principle of life in the atmosphere. If, as is supposed, a usual cause of pestilential disorders, is a too great quantity of oxygen in the air, producing first the stenic or inflammatory di∣athesis, and of course indirect debility, then those places must be most healthy, in such a general state of the air, where there is the smallest proportion of oxygen. This remark however is a mere conjecture; and the facts related of the plague in Ly∣ons stand as an exception to a very general rule, that the most filthy, unventilated places suffer most severely by all kinds of pestilential maladies.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Lyons, tanners and curriers escaped the plague, as did those who cleansed sewers and privies. The same has generally been the case with the sextons, and others employed in burying the dead. See Lan∣cisius page 160 In London, shipwrights who labored in the vapor of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and pitch, escaped.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="036687_0471_100AA462E618DA78"/>It is also true in general, that the poor, who inhabit narrow streets and alleys, amidst filthy substances, suffer more by malig∣nant complaints than the rich, who live in wider streets, and more airy, cleanly houses. To this however history presents us some exceptions; cases hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> occurred in which the rich have been the principal sufferers, as in 1361.</P>
<P>While it may be difficult to assign precise reasons for such dif∣ferences in the operation of the principle of destruction, the facts prove that this principle consists in some hidden qualities of the elements, and does not arise from any of the ordinary visible causes of disease. Riverius is explicit on this point. He avers that pestilential diseases often occur, without any apparent change in the visible qualities of the air, and when the air <HI>appears</HI> to be more pure than at other times, when no such diseases prevail.</P>

<P>Further, altho it is generally true that pestilence is attended and greatly augmented in violence by some peculiarity in the sea∣sons, as excessive heat and moisture or drouth, yet to this there are frequent exceptions. The reader may turn back to an in∣stance of this, recorded by Livy and other Latin historians, in which it was remarked as a matter of surprise, that a violent plague, and one of the most destructive kind, should assail the city of Rome, in a mild, temperate season. A similar observa∣tion was made respecting the plague in Paris in 1580. The summer was temperate and the fruits good. No visible cause could be assigned for the malady. Yet a most certain, or rather an infallible symptom of a deranged state of the elements, had occurred in that year; I mean a most severe universal influ∣enza. Hence it appears, that altho peculiar seasons may prodi∣giously increase, and perhaps produce a pestilence; yet the gen∣eral cause is often some principle which has no dependence on season or changes of weather. In the last London plague, in 1665, says Hodge, the season was mild, the heat moderate, and fruits abundant and good.</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="036687_0472_100AA4656BE08B40"/>We have, in America, proofs of the truth of this doctrin. The last pestilential period commenced with the measles in 1789 and severe epidemic influenza in 1789 and 90; and has already continued ten years. Some of the summers, during this period, have been very temperate, as those of 1794 and 1797. Yet ev∣ery summer has produced the pestilential fever of our climate; and even our winters have exhibited symptoms of the diseases which prevail in summer. Not one year, even the most temper∣ate, of the whole period, has failed to show the predominant di∣athesis of the pestilence. The sultry dry summers of 1793 and 98, and the sultry humid summer of 1795, have rendered the diseases more violent and fatal in the northern states.</P>
<P>Yet in the more favorable seasons of 1794, 96 and 97, the morbid cause produced its effects in New-Haven, Providence, Newburyport and Boston, as well as in Baltimore, Norfolk and Charleston.</P>
<P>Hence we observe that the elemental cause of the diseases of this period, may be, in some degree, modified, but not control∣led or subdued by the most temperate and favorable seasons.</P>
<P>Indeed all writers of reputation on this subject agree, in this one opinion, that the plague cannot be ascribed, either to intem∣perate seasons, or to putrefaction, or to any species of exhalations from animal and vegetable substances. These are allowed to be secondary causes, operating to modify or vary the operation of the primary cause; but one uniform series of observations from the beginning of history to this day, has driven medical writers from the defenceless ground of intemperate weather, and putrid exhalations.</P>
<P>Hippocrates learnt that pestilence could not be ascribed solely to visible causes; he therefore admits <HI>to theion,</HI> something divine, or beyond human investigation, to be a primary cause of this ca∣lamity.</P>
<P>Tacitus informs us that the plague in the time of Nero could not be ascribed to any visible intemperature in the seasons.</P>
<P>Fernelius observes that altho immoderate heat augments the plague and every acute disease, yet he had known an excessively hot season, pass off without producing pestilential diseases. He
<PB N="118" REF="036687_0473_100AA466F12730E0"/>
agrees with Diemerbroeck, that the cause must be some unknown principle, "inquinamentum e coelo demissum," some cause of corruption in the atmosphere, which is infused into it from the ce∣lestial regions. This is cutting the gordian knot. These authors are doubtless right, in rejecting the visible qualities of the air, ex∣halations and intemperate seasons, as the primary causes of the plague; but they fly from earth into the boundless regions of space, for a cause which is more probably beneath their feet, or around their bodies.</P>
<P>Sennertus decides also most positively against putridity or cor∣ruption of the humors, as the cause of pestilence; and maintains <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat it proceeds from an occult malignity in the air.</P>
<P>Skenkius contends that persons do not receive the plague from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umors in the body, from extraordinary seasons, from intestine putridity, or corruption of indigested substances, nor from bad food or drink, nor from stagnant waters, nor from exhalations from dead bodies, cemeteries or sewers, or the fetid waters of tan-yards; unless they inhale the noxious or infecting cause, e sub∣limi. To produce the malady, requires no corruption of the manifest qualities of the air.</P>
<BIBL>Page 764.</BIBL>
<P>Prosper Alpinus, who lived some time in Egypt and had an op∣portunity to make personal observations on the diseases of that country, maintains that the plague rarely arises from corrupt air, and never, unless when the Nile has exceeded its usual limits in its inundations. If, says this writer, the disease proceeded from noxious exhalations from putrid stagnant waters and marshes, it would occur every year, which is contrary to fact. Hence he concludes the disease to be usually imported into Egypt from Greece, Syria and Barbary. In this opinion, he has been fol∣lowed by a whole tribe of unobserving travellers; who stupidly forget that by tracing the distemper from Egypt to Syria or Bar∣bary, they never come nearer to its source. The question still occurs, what is its cause? where is its source? If putrid exha∣lations in Egypt will not produce the plague, will such exhalations in Syria or Barbary produce it? Why trace it to these countries? Does any cause exist in Syria, Greece or Barbary to generate that disease, which does not exist in Egypt?</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="036687_0474_100AA469733FE368"/>To avoid this dilemma, some writers insist that its source is in Constantinople, where the seeds of it are treasured up in old clothes, and preserved from year to year, and from age to age. But why suppose this source of the disease to exist in Constanti∣nople only? Why not the same source forever exist in Egypt, for there also infected clothes are never purified. In short, from Prosper Alpinus to Mead and Cullen, all the reasonings and as∣sertions of authors on the origin of the plague, argue either im∣potence of mind, want of observation or extreme prejudice.</P>
<P>So far as this, Alpinus is right, that exhalations alone from stagnant waters and marshes will not ordinarily generate the plague; but aided by some general primary cause in the elements, such ex∣halations do produce the plague, and in no country more frequent∣ly than in Egypt.</P>
<P>Gibbon alleges this disease to proceed from hot, damp, stag∣nant air, drawing this conclusion probably from the origination of the terrible plague of 542, in the foul regions near Pelusium in Egypt, and in the vicinity of a large marsh. But if this were the only cause necessary to produce the disorder, as Alpi∣nus justly observes, it would occur regularly every year, for every hot season generates putrid exhalations in ample abundance, and in every hot climate, will be found annual returns of hot, damp, stagnant air, The causes therefore assigned by Gibbon are inad∣equate to the effect.</P>
<P>In America, beyond almost any other country, we have the most irresistible arguments against this opinion. No country on earth, not excepting the rice plantations on the river Bengal, pre∣sents such an immense region of stagnant waters, and fetid marsh∣es, as the eastern shore of the United States, from the Delaware to Florida. The southern extremity of this region is in a cli∣mate always warm; and the whole of it is exposed to burning heat, for four months in the year. Yet the true, "pestis ingui∣naria," of the oriental countries has never appeared in this coun∣try, as an epidemic; and the species of the plague which occurs, and which I call <HI>bilious</HI> or <HI>American,</HI> appears as rarely amidst the marshes of Carolina, as in the northern cities, which are expo∣posed to no marsh exhalations.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="036687_0475_100AA46C03E99258"/>Now if hot, damp, stagnant air, and putrid exhalations alone were adequate to the production of this bilious plague, it must be produed every year, in a multitude of places on the American coast; whereas in fact, that disease rarely occurs, as an epidem∣ic, even on the flat lands of Carolina and Georgia; and never is very extensively mortal, except when the northern states, which are situated on high, rocky, gravelly and dry lands, and whose air and water are of the most pure and salubrious kind, are afflic∣ted also with malignant epidemic distempers.</P>
<P>This is a remarkable fact and one on which I will venture to rest the whole argument. In no instance, has the city of Charleston, situated on an immense flat, surrounded by the marshes of Ashley and Cooper rivers, been severely troubled with a contagious bilious epidemic, except when the seasons have been sickly in the northern states. Witness the years 1699, 1728, 1732, 1739, 1745, 1748, 1796. I speak not of spo∣radic cases among strangers that visit the southern states, for these may occur every year.</P>
<P>The Europeans might, had they not been blinded by the false notions of contagion, long ago have discovered the same import∣ant truth; for what is called a great plague in Egypt or Syria, never occurs, except during the prevalence of malignant epi∣demics all over Europe, even to the Baltic. Lighter epidemics occur in Egypt and Constantinople, in any uncommon season; and so does the ordinary autumnal bilious fever, in all our south∣ern states. These are disorders which may be excited, in any place and any season, by the action of heat on vegetable substan∣ces in stagnant water, or by the local impurities which always exist in populous cities. But these ordinary diseases do not put on the malignant spmptoms which characterize the distempers of pestilential periods—they do not exhibit infection. On the other hand, when the diseases of Egypt assume contagious and deadly symptoms and spread desolation over that country, we shall al∣ways find the northern parts of Europe, more or less afflicted with the same or other malignant disorders. The pestilential principle, in greater or less degrees of violence, extends over the whole European world, and not unfrequently over the A∣merican continent.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="036687_0476_100AA46E1B2C4898"/>Thus, altho the plague does not, in modern times, appear in the north of Europe, at least not often, yet all the great plagues in the Levant are visible, if I may indulge the expression, in the augmented bills of mortality in London, Amsterdam, and the Baltic cities. Witness the pestilential periods of 1720, of 1736 to 1740, of 1760 to 1763. Even the less violent pestilences of 1772 and 3, and of 1784 to 1786, have been marked by epidemics in England and Scotland. And, in the last series of epidemics, the years 1792, 93 and 95, which have been distinguished for the plague in the east, as well as anginas and plague in America, exhibit a considerable increase of mortality in London.</P>
<P>All these facts serve as evidence of the truth of what the medical writers of the fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth cen∣turies have unanimously advanced, that the primary cause of pestilence is some invisible quality in the elements, altogether distinct from corrupt air, or marsh exhalations.</P>
<P>It is a remark of the Arabian physicians, that an indisposition of the air is necessary, in the hottest climates, to enforce the ac∣tion of putrid effluvia on the human body to produce the plague.</P>
<BIBL>Mead, 248.</BIBL>
<P>Dr. Mead himself, while he maintains that the putrefaction of animal substances, with unseasonable moistures, heats and want of winds, produces the plague, and while he contends that no kind of putrefaction in European countries, is ever heightened to a degree capable of producing the true plague, admits that a corrupted state of air is necessary to give the contagious atoms their full force, otherwise the plague could never cease, but with the extinction of mankind. That is, he holds the plague never to appear in European northern countries, without contagion, but that the contagion would remain inert, without a corrupt state of the atmosphere.</P>
<P>The absurd opinion, that northern climates will not generate the state of air which occasions a pestilence, but that a pestilen∣tial germ, or leaven, must be imported from Egypt or other southern latitude, has been adopted by most of the British med∣ical writers, and by a numerous part of the physicians in the
<PB N="122" REF="036687_0477_100AA46FA1094A68"/>
United States. It is hard to say whether the followers of Mead are the more servile, or their opinion, the more unphilo∣sophical. But for my present purpose, it is sufficient that even the advocates for the propagation of the plague by a specific contagion, admit that this cause is not adequate to the effect, and that they are compelled to summon to their aid a general princi∣ple of corruption in the air, to account for its propagation in northern climates. This concession of the existence of such a principle, by whatever name it may be called, is all I ask.</P>
<P>It is on this principle only, we can reconcile the differing ac∣counts of authors, in regard to the effect of putrefying bodies after battles, in producing pestilential diseases; some alleging that such corrupting bodies will produce the plague, and others denying the fact. Julius Alexandrinus, Diodorus Siculus and other authors, relate that plagues have arisen from the putrefac∣tion of dead bodies after battles. Three or four instances occur in the foregoing history, of plagues ascribed to the putrefaction of dead locusts. Forestus relates that a dead whale, cast upon the shore of Holland, occasioned an extensive pestilence in Eg∣mont. See Hieronymus, Agustinus, Sabellicus, Walfius, An∣gelus, Paraeus, and Agricola, who have recorded similar facts, as cited by Diemerbroeck de peste.</P>
<P>Dr. Gottwald relates that the plague which spread over the north of Europe from 1702 to 1711, originated near Pickzow, soon after the unfortunate battle between the Saxons and Swedes; but he says nothing of putrefying bodies, nor does he ascribe the disease to that cause.</P>
<BIBL>Baddam's Mem. 6. 5.</BIBL>
<P>At the same time, it it equally true, that thousands of dead bodies after battles have perished unburied, without producing any such effect. In 1642, eight thousand dead soldiers and innumerable carcases of horses, after a battle in the Duchy of Juliers, were left to putrefy on the surface of the earth, causing an intolerable stench, but producing no pestilential disease. The same fact happened often, says Diemerbroeck, p. 31, in the cruel wars, between the Swedes and Imperialists, in his days; and we know that other historians have related similar facts.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="036687_0478_100AA471D707A910"/>Whenever a malignant disease follows such an extensive pu∣trefaction, Diemerbroeck alleges, the disease to be only a pesti∣lential fever, but not the true plague. Or if, in any instance, the true plague follows, he maintains the putrefaction to be only a secondary cause. This is probably a near approach to the truth. The whole mystery is unfolded, on my principles, which teach the existence of a disordered or pestilential state of the elements, at particular times. If the putrefaction of dead bodies takes place during these periods, when the animal func∣tions are debilitated, or impaired, and the human body, prone to disease, the corruption of flesh may so far vitiate the atmos∣phere as to produce pestilence. But if thousands of dead bodies putrefy on the earth, when the air is in its natural state, salu∣brious and adapted to the support of health, and when the hu∣man body is in full vigor to resist the effects of the foul effluvia, it is hardly possible for any quantity of dissolving flesh to evolve a poison, adequate to the production of pestilential disorders, and certainly not sufficient to occasion an extensive epidemic.</P>
<P>An attention to this distinction will also reconcile all the differ∣ences of opinion, and all the contradictory phenomena which re∣gard the effects of vegetable effluvia, and the impure air of cities.</P>
<P>Why, it has been triumphantly asked by the advocates of im∣ported fomites, did not the filthy streets and putrefying vegetables of New-York and Philadelphia, produce the bilious pestilence, in former years? For many years, we recollect, more foul streets and docks, much greater accumulations of filth, yet these produced not the contagious fever which has lately desolated our cities.</P>
<P>Such are the facts, I admit; and the same will again take place, when the period of pestilence shall be closed, and the la∣tent disorders of the elements, corrected. But there has existed, since 1789, a universal defect in the healthful powers of the ele∣ments, clearly evidenced by a series of severe epidemics, the in∣fluenza and scarlatina, the increased violence of the symptoms of ordinary distempers; by the imperfection of fruits; by the sick∣ness and death of fish, fowls and cats, with many disorders a∣mong other animals. The moment this state of the elements oc∣curs, the local impurities which always exist in cities, and which
<PB N="124" REF="036687_0479_100AA47484FF8A80"/>
produce only ordinary diseases, in a healthful disposition of the elements, give to those diseases new virulence and a contagious quality. The whole secret to be unfolded, is, that the autum∣nal diseases, under the debilitating operation of a general derange∣ment of the elements, acquire unusually severe symptoms, a wi∣der extension, and the quality of contagion or what I call infec∣tion. These phenomena excite the astonishment of men, who have not attended to the history of pestilence, in which they might have found the means of solving the difficulty; for similar facts have marked the progress of pestilential diseases, from the days of Moses to this hour.</P>
<P>I would further observe that from universal observation, it ap∣pears, that during that state of air, which produces contagious diseases in unusual numbers, all kinds of flesh and vegetables are more apt to putrefy, than in a healthy state of the atmosphere. This was observed by Diemerbroeck in the Holland plague of 1636; and we have had many proofs of it in America, within a few years past. And this is evidently true not only of fresh animal meat, but also of salted meats of all kinds. The powers of salt appear to be insufficient to preserve flesh and fish, against the strong tendency to dissolution, which seems to attend them in certain years. Hence we so frequently hear of spoiled beef and pork, and fish during sickly periods.</P>
<P>In some seasons, it appears to be almost impossible to keep pro∣visions, destined for a foreign market. This effect on flesh and fish may proceed either from unusual heat and moisture in the air, or from an obvious imperfection or sickly state of the animals; and perhaps, independent of these causes, it may proceed sometimes from the same invisible principle in the properties of air, which originates new and malignant symptoms of disease in the human body; a mere excess of stimulus.</P>
<P>But whatever may be the cause, the effect is obvious; and the unexpected putrefaction of salted meats, has often been among the causes which have generated or augmented pestilential distem∣pers in America. Such an instance is mentioned at New-Haven in 1794, where a quantity of putrid fish was thrown into the dock, and was excessively offensive, just before the appearance of
<PB N="125" REF="036687_0480_100AA476AE969320"/>
the pestilential fever. In New-York, the last summer, the pesti∣lence evidently received great force and malignancy from large quantities of beef and pork which spoiled in stores and cellars. A similar cause is supposed to have excited or increased the same disease in Boston and New-London. The putrefaction of re∣mains of great multitudes of the fish called Menhaden, on the wharves in Newburyport, in 1796, was obviously a powerful ex∣citing cause of the disorder in that town.</P>
<P>In such cases, putrefaction is more rapid, and its stench more poisonous, than under a healthful constitution of the atmosphere. This accelerated dissolution of flesh is the <HI>effect</HI> of the common principle of disease, and in its turn, becomes the <HI>cause</HI> of disease.</P>
<P>Hence we may observe, that it is only during a sickly state of the elements, that putrefaction is ever known to excite pestilen∣tial epidemics; for almost every man has observed, many times, that the same quantities of putrefying flesh, in periods of health, produce no such distempers. It is this circumstance which has puzzled all superficial observers, and furnished the advocates of imported infection, with strong ground to maintain their errors. They allege, "the same causes have not always produced the same effects. As putrefaction and filth have not, at other times and always, produced diseases in our climate, therefore they do not produce the pestilential fever of the present time, and it <HI>must</HI> be occasioned by imported fomites." These men have not at∣tended to similar facts in all other countries and in all ages. The same argument would prove that no pestilential disease can be gen∣erated any where; for it is as true of the West-Indies, of E∣gypt and Constantinople, as it is of the United States, that pu∣trefaction does not, every year and at all times, produce pesti∣lence. In this fact agree all authors who have written on the causes of the plague. And there is reason to believe, with Die∣merbroeck, that putrefaction <HI>alone</HI> never produces the plague; but that whenever it is the <HI>apparent exciting</HI> cause, there concurs with it a general sickly state of the air; which not being visible, mankind ascribe the whole effect to putrefaction.</P>
<P>In the United States, it is a very curious fact, that this sick∣ly state of the elements has been progressive, as I have par∣ticularly
<PB N="126" REF="036687_0481_100AA478BA7A1BA8"/>
proved, in the preceding pages, which progression was clearly marked by the increase of mortality by the scarlatina, and other diseases of unusual malignity. In every instance, the epidemic pestilential fever, tho said to arise from putrid flesh, has kept pace with this insalubrious state of air. For example, while Philadelphia was ravaged by the plague in 1793, the scarlatina was prevalent in New-York; but the eastern states were exempt, and felt no inconvenience from the pestilential state of the air, unless in a few sporadic cases of autumnal fever, of aug∣mented violence, which indicated a <HI>commencement</HI> of the epidemic constitution. In 1794, this constitution arrived to its <HI>crisis</HI> in Connecticut, moving eastward in its progress; and at New-Haven appeared the pestilential fever, soon after its precursor, the scarlatina. Now whether we suppose the pestilence to be from imported fomes, or from the putrid fish and clams in the docks, it is remarkable that it did not occur till the state of air was evidently sickly, and ill-fitted to support life, as appeared by the malignant dysentery in the vicinity, and by the universal prevalence of scarlatina. This is a curious and important fact.</P>
<P>Proceeding eastward we observe the same truth. The pesti∣lential fever at Newburyport was said to be excited by the putrid garbage of fish—true, but this effect did not take place in 1793, when the fever was laying waste Philadelphia; nor in 1795, when the same fever prevailed in New-York. Why? evidently because the constitution of air in the eastern states, had not then arrived to its crisis of malignancy. But moving eastward, the scarlatina began to show itself there in 1795, and in 1796 was more general and fatal in all the adjacent country. Then follow∣ed the pestilential fever, both in Boston and Newburyport. So that if we admit the disease to be of imported origin, or suppose it to arise from putrid exhalations, we are still compelled to admit the concurrence of some general cause in the production of the disease, because we never know this pestilence to appear, but when other diseases and phenomena demonstrate the existence of such a cause.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If it should be said, that putrid fish might not have existed, in other years, in situations to expose the inhabitants; I answer, that with∣in my observation, in numberless instances, immense quantities of the entrails of fish are left to putrefy on the shores of our rivers, every year, with an intolerable stench, but without producing the least ap∣pearance of disease.</NOTE> In Philadelphia, in New-Haven, and in almost eve∣ry
<PB N="127" REF="036687_0482_100AA47A56B33FB0"/>
place, the pestilential fever has followed close upon the heels of that malignant distemper, the scarlet fever.</P>
<P>With respect to the duration of this general constitution of air, we can determin nothing, but by the event. We observe in history, that such pestilential periods are of various length, from three to fifteen years, or perhaps for a longer time; during which, diseases are multiplied and augmented; and all bearing some peculiar symptoms, that characterize that constitution or state of the elements. On this subject the treatise of Sydenham is invaluable.</P>
<P>There remains one other view of this subject to be considered in this section—this is, the connection of pestilential diseases with famin.</P>
<P>Most authors have remarked that famin is a cause of pes∣tilence, and have cited the old Greek adage, <HI>o loimos meta limon,</HI> pestis post famem, the plague follows famin.</P>
<P>It is a just remark that the true plague often follows a dearth of provisions; it is more frequently true, that scarcity is followed by diseases of a less malignant type But it is equally true that this order is often inverted, and famin follows pestilence. It is more frequently true that pestilence is neither preceded nor followed by any scarcity of provisions. Instances of all these facts appear in the preceding history. The conclusion is inevitable, that the plague proceeds from some other cause, than a deficient or su∣perabundant quantity of food, for it often occurs, independent of either of these circumstances.</P>
<P>Thus Morellus, de feb. pest. lib. 3, relates an instance, where no pestilential diseases succeeded a severe famin. Galen men∣tions an instance of a severe famin which followed as severe a plague in Rome, yet the famin did not again excite the plague.</P>
<P>De Pauw, in his Philosophical Dissertations on the Egyptians and Chinese, vol. 1. 87, answers and refutes the Abbe Four∣mont who alleged famin to be the cause of the plague.</P>
<P>"By exact annotations, says De Pauw, continued during
<PB N="128" REF="036687_0483_100AA47CE4938E50"/>
twenty-eight years, we find the plague has raged in Egypt five times, without being preceded by any scarcity of food, and con∣trary to what I once suspected, unrestricted to a periodical course." We know also in America, that scarcity of food can have had no influence in producing the numerous epidemic and pestilential disorders of the last nine years.</P>
<P>On this subject Diemerbroeck has a very just remark, and one that solves all the difficulties that might seem to arise from the differing accounts of the effects of famin. He says "Non om∣nem, sed illam tantum famem sequitur pestis, quae fames et ipsa a pestilentiae causa originem sumit, (dum a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ea causa primo fru∣ges terrae corrumpuntur, postea pestis inducitur,) ita ut fames illa non sit causa pestis, sed ipsamet eandem cum peste causam habeat."</P>
<BIBL>De peste, page 30.</BIBL>
<P>"For the plague does not follow every famin; but that only which arises from the same cause as the plague; (for by that cause the fruits of the earth are first vitiated and afterwards the plague succeeds) so that the famin is not the <HI>cause</HI> of the plague, but proceeds itself from the same cause."</P>
<P>Whenever there exists a general cause in the elements, un∣friendly to the health of the human race, and at the same time, to the growth and perfection of grain, pestilence and famin may be companions of each other; or they may reciprocally follow each other, according as the general cause operates first on ve∣getables or on mankind. In such cases, superficial observers are apt to suppose one to be the cause of the other, when in fact, they are both the offspring of a common cause.</P>
<P>In long sieges, bad food is often a powerful cause of disease, as in the siege of Marseilles by Julius Cesar, before Christ 48. Cesar, De bel. civ. lib. 2. 20. In such cases, the bad qualities of the corn or bread, are not natural defects in the growth, but the effects of age, heat, moisture and decay.</P>
<P>Fortunately, the improved state of agriculture has rendered a dearth of grain, a rare occurrence. In despotic governments, where industry of every kind languishes, and men seldom make provision for subsistence beyond the passing moment, famin is not unfrequent in modern times, as in Syria after the terribly severe
<PB N="129" REF="036687_0484_100AA47EEC2EFD48"/>
winter of 1756-7, when the crops failed, and parents devoured their children, or offered them for sale in market to procure food. But such is the state of agriculture, in free countries, that crops are less liable to fail, than formerly; and when they fall short in a particular country, commerce may usually supply the deficiency from some other climate. A universal failure of grain, even under the most unfavorable disposition of the elements, must be a rare phenomenon.</P>
<P>Yet with all our improvements in agriculture and commerce, we are not to calculate with certainty that we are never to feel the scourge of famin. There has been, within about a century, a succession of seasons when the earth failed to yield her accus∣tomed quantity of vegetable food. Such were the last years of the last century, when corn was cut short by mildew and blast, not in one country only, but in most countries. Multitudes per∣ished in the north of Europe, and our forefathers in America observed, that for a number of years, the very course of nature seemed to be altered.</P>
<P>The beginning of the seventeenth century was distinguished by a still more extensive and severe dearth, which afflicted all Eu∣rope, and cut off a large portion of its inhabitants.</P>
<P>In the year 1783, the dearth in Scotland was so severe that commerce alone saved thousands from perishing; and so late as the year 1790, our own country experienced a scarcity that excited universal alarm. Both of these periods were distinguished for severe famin in Egypt, Bengal and the Carnatic.</P>
<P>Such facts show us the all-powerful influence of the invisible energies of nature, and how little avail human efforts, to avoid the fatal consequences of a universal failure in their operation. That the principles of vegetation do thus fail, at certain times, over large portions of the globe, is an unquestionable truth; it is equally certain, that such events are intimately connected with the cause of pestilence among men. Hence we observe that men and cattle often perish with epidemic diseases, when veget∣ables fail to yield their customary fruits.</P>
<P>It is not however the <HI>want</HI> of food which occasions diseases, so frequently as the bad quality of it. Next to the corrupt state
<PB N="130" REF="036687_0485_100AA4809583C830"/>
of air, says Riverius, unwholesome aliments are the causes of pestilent diseases. Vegetables may acquire unwholesome quali∣ties from too much or too little moisture, or from other unknown causes. Grain of a good quality may also degenerate and be∣come unwholesome, by heat and moisture, after it is gathered, as in magazines, granaries, or holds of ships. Such corn may produce diseases in those who feed upon it.</P>
<P>But it is doubtful whether mere want of food ever produced a contagious disease. Seamen who suffer and even perish at sea, in a wholesome air, thro mere hunger, pine away and die with∣out disease. Whenever contagious distempers accompany dearth, there is usually a concurrence of other causes to produce the effect.</P>
<P>We may therefore consider the proposition of Diemerbroeck as correct, that famin does not produce the plague, but proceeds from the same cause; yet that scarcity of food and still more certainly, food of a bad quality, may produce diseases of a less malignant type, or very much augment, in violence and extent, the current disorders of a particular season.</P>
<P>Yet here again our senses may deceive us. Corn of an ap∣parently bad quality, does not always generate disease. A stri∣king instance of this is related in Sinclair's Scotland, vol. 7. 605. Frost, rain and snow had turned the corn black; it was disa∣greeable to the taste; the straw was equally affected; but nei∣ther man nor beast suffered by feeding on them—so little do we know of the cause of diseases.</P>
<P>Intimately connected with the subject of vegetable nutriment, is the consideration of diseases among cattle. Whenever grass is defective in wholesome, nutritious qualities, horses, horn-cattle and sheep are sure to suffer by mortal distempers.</P>
<P>It is often mentioned in the foregoing pages, and a fact that every man may have observed, that when contagious diseases prevail among men, similar disorders prevail more or less among cattle. Very few of the plagues in ancient Rome, affected one species of animals, without showing the pestilential principle in others. The same remark may be made, in all ages, and is true at the present period. Sometimes the pestilence invades one spe∣cies of animals first—sometimes another; sometimes the diseases
<PB N="131" REF="036687_0486_100AA4829C377320"/>
will be more general and severe among men, and sometimes among cattle; but seldom do we observe one species of animals severely affected, and the other totally exempt.</P>
<P>So far as my reading and observations enable me to judge, diseases among cattle usually succeed excessive or unseasonable humidity in the air. The years 1712 and 13, when a plague destroyed a vast proportion of the cattle in Italy, and great num∣bers in Germany, are noted in England, to have been wet and cold. What was the state of the air in the countries where the disease was most fatal, I am not informed. The short account I have seen of it, abridged from Ramazzini, in the 6th volume of Baddam's Memoirs, makes no mention of the weather or seasons; and Lancisius, who has also left many particulars re∣specting it, is not before me. The disease however was a true plague, characterized with many of the symptoms of plague in the human body. Authors all agree that the distemper was prop∣agated solely by contagion from a single cow, from Dalmatia; and they are so well contented with this idea, that they tell us little or nothing from which we can collect the cause. Like the writers on the cause of the plague in Egypt, who trace it to Bar∣bary or Syria, and there leave the subject; so Lancisius and Ra∣mazzini, tell us the distemper, which destroyed most of the cattle in Italy, came from one cow, in a drove from Dalmatia; and there they stop short, without a syllable to explain why the cow from Dalmatia was seized.</P>
<P>All these contagion-sticklers resemble the Indian, who, when asked what the world stands on, replied, on an elephant—the elephant, on a great turtle, and the turtle, on the ocean. Here he stopped, and as to what supports the ocean, he leaves us in the dark.</P>
<P>The general visible cause of pestilential diseases among cattle, as before remarked, seems to be an excess of moisture, which renders their food watery and unsubstantial. The summer of 1751, a year of remarkable mortality among the cattle in Eng∣land, was cold and rainy. Such was the season in 1348, which was followed by a great loss of sheep, as well as by pestilence among men.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="036687_0487_100AA48533A63E88"/>Yet all wet seasons do not produce the same effect; and we are constrained to resort, for the cause, to unseen properties in the air or the food on which the cattle subsist.—That the same general cause affects cattle and the human race, in times of pesti∣lence, is obvious from the analogy of symptoms in their diseases. During the present sickly period in America, horses and horned cattle have died, in many parts of the country, with diseases which are characterized with bilious appearances; in analogy with all the disorders which have affected men, during the same period.</P>
<P>Lancisius and Ramazzini would have treated the subject of the disease among horses and cattle in Italy, in 1712 and 13, much more like philosophers and men of sound science, if, instead of telling how much mischief an infected cow had done, and how the disease had been spread, by farriers, by dogs and by shep∣herds, they had described to us the seasons, the state of vegeta∣tion and the diseases which prevailed among mankind. They ought at least to have connected, with the disease among cattle, an extensive plague among men which was then raging in Vienna, Hungary, and other countries, as it had been, for several years before, over all the Polish and Baltic territories.</P>
<P>The frequent prevalence of mortal epidemics among the brutes, is an obvious and irresistible proof of some deleterious principle in the elements, which is adequate to the production of the worst diseases, and the destruction of life, independent of every arti∣ficial cause.</P>
<P>The brutes, if left to themselves, follow implicitly, a princi∣ple of their nature, called instinct. They eat what nature inten∣ded for them, and never feed on what is pernicious to their health; nor will they injure themselves by eating too much or too little of their ordinary food. Governed by such a law, they can be liable to no diseases, but such as must necessarily proceed from the air they breathe, the water they drink, or the vegetables they eat, all of which are ordinarily good, nutritious, and well fitted to support sound health. Their diseases therefore must proceed from some imperfection in these elements of life, which is occa∣sioned by natural causes. This process of reasoning appears to
<PB N="133" REF="036687_0488_100AA48744C50608"/>
be strictly logical and correct. The conclusions from it are inev∣itable. If a state of the elements does ever exist, which can produce diseases that destroy the lives of the brutes, without con∣tagion or any artificial cause, we may safely allege that a state of the elements may exist in any latitude which is adequate to the production of the most formidable maladies, that ever affect man∣kind.</P>
<P>The analogies of the animal economy, and continual obser∣vations forbid us to suppose the powers of life in the beasts of the field, less perfect, or more easily dissolved, than those of the hu∣man race. On the contrary, from their following their natural undepraved appetites, in the use of food and in all their actions, their bodies may be supposed to be more firm and perfect than those of men, who are usually debilitated by irregularities in living, and other deviations from the laws of nature. If then irrational animals are subject to the invasions of mortal epidemic diseases, which mow them down by thousands, in defiance of the firm texture of their bodies, and their regular living, a fortiori the human race must be liable to destruction by similar means.</P>
<P>This reasoning is certainly just and substantial, whatever may be its fate in convincing the reader; and it proves that the natu∣ral operation of some secret principle in the elements, is sufficient to account for the most destructive maladies, in every latitude on the globe, without resorting to the transportation of fomites from some one heaven-scourged country to more favored regions.</P>
<P>Dr. Mead and all his servile admirers who believe him, with∣out investigating his assertions, allege that putrefaction never rises, in England, to a degree that is necessary to generate a pestilence. But if any man can believe that putrefaction, as writers are pleas∣ed to call the principle of destruction, can rise high enough in the grades of malignity, to produce a plague or contagious mortal distemper among cattle in England, and at the same time, never affect the human species, he must have more pride in the superem∣inent station of man in the scale of being, than I possess. The argument from facts is evidently in favor of the theory, which subjects all animals, in this respect, to the same laws; and the
<PB N="134" REF="036687_0489_100AA4894CC6C468"/>
analogies of creation will not authorize man to claim the high privilege of exemption from the general laws of the animal econ∣omy. —It is an unquestionable truth, that men as well as brutes, in all latitudes, are often invaded with contagious and deadly dis∣eases, under the operation of the elements, without the least ac∣cession of contagion from southern climates or any foreign country. Multitudes of facts warrant this deduction; but the progression in the violence of epidemic diseases, the imperfection of vegeta∣bles, the sickness and death of fish in rivers and the ocean, and of cattle on land, are proofs of the truth of my principle, which bid defiance to opposition.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XVI. Of Contagion and Infection.</HEAD>
<P>NO point on the subject of diseases has been more agitated among medical writers, than that of the contagion of the plague, inguinal and bilious.</P>
<P>Hippocrates has left no decisive opinion on this question, but those who maintain the plague not to be contagious, rely on this silence of the father of medicin, as an argument in their favor.</P>
<P>Galen's opinion was clearly in favor of the contagiousness of certain diseases. "Quodque periculosa sit conversatio cum labo∣rantibus pestilenti morboquum nimirum is non secus fit contagio∣sus, quam scabies aut lippitudo."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In another translation, the latter part of this passage stands thus; "periculum enim est, ne concipiatur, ut scabies et lippitudo."</NOTE> p. 379. The author doubt∣less speaks here of other pestilent diseases, besides the inguinal plague, according to the practice of the ancients who gave the name of <HI>pestilence</HI> to other malignant distempers, when epidemic. His opinion however was that the plague originates in a putridity of the air, inhaled by the breath. "Lues ipsa, ab aeris putre∣dine exorta, per inspirationes insiliens, haud unum aut alterum hominem, sed plures quoque civitates depascit, vastat, et popula∣tur." p. 627. In another passage, he remarks, that pestilent diseases proceed from a state of the atmosphere. "Pestilentes morbi a coeli statu prosiciscantur."</P>
<P>This author observed that pestilential epidemics must have some cause more powerful and extensive, than contagion, or infection.</P>
<P>Aristotle was clearly of opinion that the plague is contagious, and the reason he assigns why pestilence alone is communicated from person to person, is, that this is the only disease which is
<PB N="136" REF="036687_0491_100AA48DE3A00690"/>
common to all men. This is not very clear or satisfactory; but he speaks of fomites proceeding from the sick, and infecting others.</P>
<BIBL>See Problem, sect. 1.</BIBL>
<P>Procopius was not a physician, but is esteemed as a historian. He alleges that in 543, the mortal plague in Constantinople was not contagious, and that physicians and attendants on the sick, did not contract the disease.</P>
<P>On the other hand Thucydides, has declared unequivocally that the plague in Athens was very contagious. Evagrius also has related that the disease, in his time, was very contagious, to particular persons, while others escaped, even against their in∣clination. Livy also was decidedly in favor of the doctrin of contagion.</P>
<P>Petrus Salius Diversus, cited by Diemerbroeck, was of the opinion, that the plague is sometimes contagious; at other times, not. Seneca held to the contagious nature of pestilence. So says Ovid, Metamorph. 7.</P>
<LG>
<L>Quo proprior quisque est, servitque fidelius aegro,</L>
<L>In partem lethi citius venit.</L>
</LG>
<P>The nearer we approach, and the more faithfully we serve, the diseased, the sooner we fall victims to the distemper.</P>
<P>Those who oppose the doctrin of contagion, not only produce as authority, the silence of Hippocrates, with Avicenna, and other Arabian physicians, on the subject; but they allege, that if the plague was a contagious disease, it would <HI>always</HI> infect those who have communication with the diseased. But this they aver to be contrary to fact; and they instance the escape of many physicians, surgeons, grave-diggers, hearse-men, and others. They argue further, that as the breath and effluvia of persons in health, will not expel the poison of the plague from the diseased; so, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the other hand, the effluvia from the infected, cannot in∣fuse the seeds of the disorder into a healthy body.</P>
<P>Gregory Nyssen, a celebrated philosopher and theologian, concludes, that those who are seized with the plague, after an intercourse with the diseased, contract it from the same state of the air, which occasioned the distemper in the sick, and not from the effluvia exhaled from the infected body. While I cannot
<PB N="137" REF="036687_0492_100AA48F69337C40"/>
assent to this opinion, in the utmost latitude, I firmly believe it contains a great deal of truth.</P>
<P>Diemerbroeck, de peste p. 44, suggests that the ancient phy∣sicians, who passed over the subject of the contagion of the plague, called that quality only <HI>contagion,</HI> which communicates disease by immediate contact, as in case of the itch, leprosy, hy∣drophobia and the like; whereas the plague infects more fre∣quently through the medium of the air, vapors, garments and other objects. Thus the sweat, exhalations, and excrementi∣tious matter of the sick corrupt the air, and this infected air be∣comes the means of disease to persons in health who breathe it. This, says Diemerbroeck, the ancients did not call contagion, proceeding from the diseased, but they considered healthy per∣sons taking the distemper through this medium, as infected by the malignity of the air.</P>
<P>Almost all modern physicians however agree in the opinion that the plague is a contagious disease, as Forestus, Prosper Al∣pinus, Diemerbroeck, Sydenham, and a multitude of others; and on this general opinion, have been instituted quarantine laws and other regulations for preserving cities and countries from the disease. Of the value of these regulations, we shall be the bet∣ter able to judge, after taking a careful survey of the question relative to the force and effects of contagion.</P>
<P>Within a few years, one author has ventured again to call in question the received opinions on this subject. Dr. Maclean, in a small treatise, has attempted to prove that the plague, dysen∣tery and epidemic fevers are never propagated by contagion. Contagion he defines to be "a specific matter generated in a person affected with disease, and capable of communicating that particular disease, with or without contact, to another."</P>
<P>This author's general arguments are these, That specific con∣tagion must necessarily act and communicate a disease from a sick to a well person, within a certain distance—that in the plague, dysentery and epidemic fevers, a small proportion of people, exposed to the action of effluvia from the diseased, are ever af∣fected by the distempers, and therefore such disorders are not contagious. He considers those diseases only as contagious,
<PB N="138" REF="036687_0493_100AA491720BD808"/>
which can be received but once by the same person; as the small-pox and measles. He affirms that the existence of contagion in plague, dysentery and fevers, has been uniformly taken for granted, not only without proof, but even contrary to the evi∣dence of numerous and convincing facts. He lays it down as a truth, that all epidemic and pestilential diseases, which may af∣fect a person more than once in his life, are caused by certain states or vicissitudes of the atmosphere, producing indirect de∣bility.</P>
<P>The variety of opinions on this subject argues either a want of accurate observations among medical men, or of accurate dis∣tinctions in terms. The various powers of diseases to commu∣nicate themselves, either have not been understood, or they have been imperfectly defined. Let us then attend to facts, the only genuin source of knowledge.</P>
<P>First. We observe that the contagion of the measles and small-pox, takes effect with great certainty, whenever a person in health, who has never been affected, approaches sufficiently near to a diseased person. I do not say it <HI>always</HI> takes effect; for there are a few exceptions; but these are so rare, as not to impeach the generality of the fact, or principle.</P>
<P>The contagion of the plague, dysentery and violent fevers, does not, under circumstances equally favorable, take effect with the like certainty. On the contrary, a great proportion of per∣sons exposed to the effluvia of the sick, entirely escape the dis∣tempers.</P>
<P>Secondly. The contagion of small-pox and measles, is not sensibly affected in its operation by heat or cold, moisture or drouth. It acts with the same certainty in winter as in summer, and in every variety of temperature.</P>
<P>The contagion of plague, dysentery and typhus fevers, on the other hand, depends almost entirely on heat for its activity, and is subdued, rendered inert, or totally extinguished by cold. Hence an essential difference in the two species of contagion— that of the small-pox and measles being an essential quality of the diseases; while that of the other diseases is an accidental cir∣cumstance.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="036687_0494_100AA49332906D70"/>Thirdly. The contagion of the plague often discriminates between the natives of particular countries, or men of a partic∣ular blood, or family, seizing one and passing by another, and this through the whole course of an epidemic; but the small-pox and measles make no such distinctions.</P>
<P>Fourthly. The contagion of the small-pox and measles is not destroyed by the purity of the atmosphere; it acts with the same certainty on the most salubrious hills, as in the most impure re∣cesses of poverty.</P>
<P>Not so the contagion of the plague, and dysentery; for as a general rule, these diseases are not propagated in a pure atmos∣phere. With respect to the plague, some e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ceptions exist; but it is the usual fact, that these last named diseases will not spread by contagion in a wholesome state of the air. By removing the sick, from a city into the country, or otherways placing him in an airy room, and preserving it clean, with all the apparel and utensils, the contagion is so dissipated or attenuated, as to be ren∣dered harmless; the attendants escape, and the disease is extin∣guished with the death or recovery of the patient.</P>
<P>Fifthly. The contagion of the small-pox and measles can never act but once on the same person. Its first operation de∣stroys the capacity of receiving it a second time. The excep∣tions to this rule are too few to deserve consideration.</P>
<P>Totally different is the effect of the plague and dysentery, for instead of fortifying the body against a second attack, these dis∣eases debilitate the animal powers, and render the patient more susceptible of the contagion in a subsequent year. It is admitted by all correct observers, that the plague may be received by the same person, times without limits; a person in Constantinople died of the twelfth attack; and many persons, in the late plagues in America, have been affected two or three times. With re∣spect to dysentery and other contagious fevers, there is no con∣troversy on this point.</P>
<P>Sixthly. The contagion of the small-pox and measles, if it takes the least effect, produces the disease complete. The in∣fected patient may be affected more lightly than the infecting person, and the degrees of violence in the symptoms may be very
<PB N="140" REF="036687_0495_100AA497DC953708"/>
vatious; but the disease produced, will always be completely formed, and of the same specific type, as that from which it is communicated.</P>
<P>The contagion of the plague and dysentery, has not the same certainty in its effect. The contagion of the plague very often produces only a nausea and vomiting—sometimes an inferior grade of fever, as an intermitting or remitting fever, of which I have myself seen examples—very often its effects are limited to dizzi∣ness in the head, or severe pains in the glands—and sometimes it has produced external eruptions, without any other material affection; as in the celebrated Diemerbroeck, who, in the grievous plague at Nimeguen, was affected with a carbuncle on his left hand, while in good health. In 1796, I saw an in∣stance in New-York, in which the infection of the pestilential fever had occasioned a singular swelling and inflammation in the face of a nurse, who escaped the disease.</P>
<P>Seventhly. We may perhaps add, what Diemerbroeck and other writers consider as essential to give effect to the contagion of the plague, and dysentery, an apt or suitable disposition in the sound body to receive the contagion. Some peculiar state of a body in health is evidently necessary to the operation of the infecting principle of the plague; this is agreed by all authors. But it does not appear that any such state or disposition is requi∣site to give effect to the contagion of small-pox or measles, which acts upon all bodies, within the reach of their effluvia. This con∣sideration may be the cause of the first distinction before recited; and a few exceptions exist to the proposition in regard to the small-pox and measles, which, tho rarely, fail of operating on bodies in health.</P>
<P>These are important distinctions, which, had they been ob∣served by medical writers, would have prevented the enormous errors of Mead and others, who maintain that the plague is prop∣agated, in northern countries, by specific contagion only. The truth is, the plague is a contagious disease, like dysentery, and most typhus fevers, but the contagion is <HI>not specific.</HI></P>
<P>Specific contagion I define to be, a quality of a disease, which, within a suitable distance, communicates it from a body affected
<PB N="141" REF="036687_0496_100AA49546C9D6B8"/>
with it, to a sound body, with great certainty, and under all circumstances of season, weather or situation. Such is the con∣tagion of the small-pox and measles. This contagion is of two kinds; first, that which acts by contact only, as that of the itch, leprosy, hydrophobia and siphilis; secondly, that which produ∣ces its effect, with equal certainty, by near approach, as that of small-pox and measles. The contagion of the angina maligna approaches to the specific kind; and if it is true, as some modern physicians have asserted, that persons can never be affected with it, more than once, it comes under the character of a <HI>specific</HI> contagion, but I doubt the fact. Several persons in Bethlem, were affected with the scarlatina anginosa twice, during the late epidemic; first in 1793 and again in 1794.</P>
<BIBL>Medical Repository, vol. 1. 525.</BIBL>
<P>That quality of a disease which may or may not excite it in a sound body, within a suitable distance, or by contact; and which depends on heat, foul air, an apt disposition in the re∣ceiving body, or other contingent circumstances, and which may excite the disease in the same person more than once, is certainly a very distinct species of contagion, from that of the small-pox, and to this I give the denomination of <HI>infection.</HI></P>
<P>With a distinction of this sort, which seems to have been first adopted by an eminent physician in New-York, Dr. Bailey, in his treatise on the fever of 1795 page 38, and which is unques∣tionably well founded, we have no difficulty in explaining all the phenomena of contagion, which have given rise to disputes, with∣out number and to the most contradictory opinions. The plague, glandular and bilious, the dysentery, typhus fevers, and the milder kinds of angina, are not <HI>specifically contagious,</HI> but they are <HI>infectious.</HI> They will not and do not propagate themselves in all situations, but the operation of the infecting quality is con∣trolled by a multitude of contingent circumstances.</P>
<P>First. It is admitted on all hands, that a suitable and partic∣ular constitution of air, is necessary to render the plague epidem∣ic in northern latitudes. Thus Sydenham supposes this disease to be conveyed by pestilential particles from one place to another, but not to become epidemic, unless favored by the constitution of
<PB N="142" REF="036687_0497_100AA49964987820"/>
air. One ground of his opinion seems to have been a fact rela∣ted by Mead, that when the disease has raged violently in one town, in the same climate, a neighboring town has totally esca∣ped, by forbiding intercourse with the infected place, as once happened in Tuscany.—This fact will be afterwards considered.</P>
<P>Mead also, while he declares his opinion that the plague is spread by specific contagion only, like small-pox and measles, and that all plagues are to be traced to Egypt, very inconsistently ad∣mits that a certain corruption of the air is necessary to give the contagious atoms their full force.</P>
<P>These opinions are utterly incongruous; for if the plague pos∣sesses specific contagion, like the small-pox, then a corrupt state of air is <HI>not</HI> necessary to give full force to the contagion; for no such state of air is requisite to give force to the contagion of the small-pox. It spreads with as much certainty in pure air, as in foul air. Mead's principles therefore overthrow his own theory. But he was driven to admit some general constitution of air, to be necessary to the propagation of the plague, because he had learnt from reading that the plague will not spread in all places, at all times and under all circumstances. In truth, Mead never had an idea of the difference between the species of contagion; and the same may be said of most modern writers.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It is a most extraordinary circumstance that the British authors, in modern days, should all agree that a favorable constitution of air is ne∣cessary to propagate the plague, and yet that no plague is bred in north∣ern climates. They must admit and do admit, that such a favorable state of air has often existed in all parts of Europe; this is a kind of half way business; allowing northern climates the power of creating and preparing a condition of atmosphere that shall meet the plague half-way.</P>
<P>But will it be denied that the petechial fever and angina maligna originate in northern latitudes? I presume not. Then the condition of air is admitted to produce <HI>most deadly infectious</HI> diseases, but not <HI>the most deadly of all.</HI> Kind heaven, in mercy to the northern world, has permitted the elements to generate diseases almost as bad as the plague, but not quite.</P>
<P>I then ask, does not the production of the angina maligna suppose as deleterious a principle in the air, as that of the plague? Is not the disease as fatal to youth, and more certainly infectious or contagious? This cannot be denied. That disease sometimes destroys as great a pro∣portion of patients seized as the plague, and is more certainly conta∣gious to youth? Besides this distemper depends not on local causes, but wholly on a condition of the elements; it therefore implies a most essen∣tial alteration in the atmosphere.</P>
<P>Further, if petechial fever is generated in northern climates, it de∣monstrates the power of those climates to produce the plague; for it has been proved, that this fever is the same species of disease, and of∣tens turns to the plague. It has done this, very often in England and on the Baltic.</P>
<P>Infection spreads certain diseases, and ought to be avoided; but med∣ical men have ascribed ten times more effects to that cause, than it ever produced. The same principle which generates the angina maligna or plague, in one instance, must be competent to produce it in all other persons of like disposition and habits.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="036687_0498_100AA49BE2337A58"/>Sanctorious, cited by Van Swieten, remarked that the rays of the plague may be removed by the wind, yet he was surprised to observe that these rays from the body of a diseased person, are never disturbed by the force of the air. I do not perfectly reconcile these remarks; but it is an indubitable fact, that a pestilential state of air, when clearly and distinctly formed in a city, is not dissipa∣ted, nor very greatly affected by the most violent winds. It has sometimes been remarked, that the pestilential fever in American cities, has been spread by particular winds; but it has spread not only before, but against the wind, tho perhaps with less rapidity. Certain it is, that no force of wind whatever ever expels from a town, or lessens the pestilential virus without the aid of other causes. Of this we have had repeated proofs in America.</P>
<P>Perhaps we may explain this fact, and reconcile the observa∣tions of Sanctorius, on the principle I have unfolded; by sup∣posing the effluvia of the sick to be, in some degree, capable of dissipation by the wind, which is undoubtedly true; but that the elemental cause of pestilence, which consists in the essential prop∣erties of the atmosphere, is not subject to dispersion or removal by the winds. This consideration would involve a curious ques∣tion, viz. whether, in the apparent motion of air, called wind, the whole mass of the surrounding atmosphere is moved, or whether it is the vapor, or other component parts of the air only, which are moved, while the fire or electric fluid remains station∣ary. But whatever may be the cause, the fact is certain, that the pestilential principle, during a plague in a city or town, is never expelled by winds. A most violent, cool north-west wind swept the city of New-York, on the 19th and 20th of September 1795, without any considerable abatement of the pestilential fever. This fact adds no small weight to my opinion, that the primary cause
<PB N="144" REF="036687_0499_100AA49EA50F2308"/>
of such diseases, is in the essential combination of the component parts of the atmosphere.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Warm southerly rains however high the wind, usually increase the violence of the disease, by inducing debility and giving activity to the local causes, as noxious effluvia from vegetable substances. Cool north∣erly winds, <HI>accompanied with heavy rains,</HI> lessen the morbid action of the pestilential principle; and if late in the season, and not succeeded by very warm weather, may entirely remove it. A violent tornado, with great rain, on the 8th of October 1797, was supposed to put a step to the pestilential fever in Providence. Water decomposes the poi∣son, or incorporates it into its own mass—but <HI>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t</HI> after moisture occa∣sions a more rapid decomposition of vegetables and increase the poison.</NOTE></P>
<P>Sanctorius further observes that "things infected with the plague, communicate the disease, as long as the proximate and remote causes subsist; one of which ceasing, the infection ceases." This is an explicit acknowledgment that the contagion is not <HI>specific,</HI> but dependent on some other cause, agreeable to the doctrin of Sydenham.</P>
<P>This principle is verified most remarkably in Egypt, as appears by all the authors who have written on the subject. They are all constrained to admit, even when they allege the plague to be not native in that country, that, if imported at certain seasons of the year, it will not spread. Prosper Alpinus expressly de∣clares that the plague is <HI>never imported in the months of June, July and August;</HI> "nunquam visa est pestis illuc ex infectis lo∣cis profecta;" altho he maintains that the disease is almost al∣ways imported.</P>
<P>This is certainly a most extraordinary assertion, and unworthy of the reputation of the writer. What in the name of sense and consistency, should prevent the seeds of such a disease from be∣ing "imported" in a particular season, when vessels are passing continually between that country and infected places? The idea betrays extreme weakness or prejudice.</P>
<P>Savary in his letters on Egypt has detailed the true state of facts. He saw vessels, which arrived in Egypt from Turkey, in the month of August, and landed their infected goods and peo∣ple, without communicating the disease. He informs us, that it is an observation of ages, that infected merchandize brot into Egypt, in the months of June, July and August, do not excite the plague, but the disease expires of itself. If introduced at
<PB N="145" REF="036687_0500_100B2C571C8E6108"/>
other seasons, and communicated, it ceases; but if imported in winter, it spreads.</P>
<P>The author has here stated effects or phenomena, with a good degree of accuracy; but has entirely mistaken the cause. It is wholly the state of air, in different seasons, and not infection, which occasions these varieties.</P>
<P>Mackenzie, in an account of the plague in Constantinople, tho a firm believer in its contagion, declares "that b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th in that city and in Smyrna, the plague breaks out in some years, when it is not possible to trace whence it is conveyed." This is doubtless true; yet neither this fact, nor the known fact that contagion in Egypt will not operate in a certain season of the year, has ever opened the eyes of European authors to the ab∣surdity of the current notions about the specific contagion of the disease.</P>
<P>A fact related by Patrick Russel, in his history of the plague at Aleppo in 1760, is full to the same point, that the contagion of the plague, will not take effect, without the aid of other causes. In 1759, the disease was introduced into Leinsol, a port on the south side of Cyprus, where it spread. Larnica, a town forty miles distant, received part of the infected crew, which brot the contagion to Leinsol. A constant communica∣tion was held between the two cities; peasants and mule drivers entered Larnica, with their pestilential sores upon them, and were daily in the streets and markets. Some died in the houses of the inhabitants. Other vessels also arrived with infected crews from Egypt, some of whom died on landing. Yet mark the issue—all this contagion did not excite the plague in Larnica! But in the beginning of the next year, eight months after, the disease appeared in Larnica, without contagion, and made great havoc. See Russel, page 4.</P>
<P>This fact and others compelled the author to admit that the disease is not always contagious, and that it does not become epi∣demic, without a certain state of air. See pages 4, 5, 7, 17, 19, 307. These facts are of infinite consequence in directing the application of laws of quarantine; a subject to be hereafter discussed.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="036687_0501_100AA4A0B56E9E90"/>Innumerable examples may be produced of plague, appearing in a few detached cases, without becoming epidemic and with∣out extending itself by contagion beyond a single family. Often it appears in sporadic cases, without exhibiting any contagion.</P>
<P>Pollinus relates an instance of a family, in which the father, mother, with two children and a servant died of the plague, without glandular swellings, and without spreading the disease be∣yond that family.</P>
<P>Joubert informs us of an instance in 1574, of a respectable family, which lost half of its members, by the plague, which ceased without spreading the infection. This was at the com∣mencement of a most pestilential period.</P>
<P>Matthias Untzerus relates, that at Halle in Saxony, he was an eye-witness of instances, in which here and there a family had been seized with the plague, introduced from other places, without any ill effects in the rest of the city—the disease termi∣nating in these families.</P>
<P>Diemerbroeck observed similar facts. In Oct. 1661, the daughter of a noble widow, was seized with a violent disease re∣sembling the plague, in the midst of a town where no plague <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ist∣ed, and no foreign cause could be assigned for the disease. The ser∣vant, who attended her, died, and the infection extended to seven persons, in succession; the rest saved themselves by flight. These persons died, without the glandular tumors, and of course some of the attending physicians, denied the disease to be the plague. Diemerbroeck, on the contrary, judging from all the symptoms, pronounced it the plague. It happened that one of the maid-servants, who left the family and was going to her brother's at Amsterdam, was infected and seized with the plague, which soon put on the genuin marks of the disease, in an inguinal tumor and two anthraces. She recovered, but infected two of her broth∣er's children, and there the disease disappeared. No local cause could be assigned for the disease in that family. The plague was not before in the city or country, the house was a splendid, ele∣gant one and kept remarkably clean, remote from any filthy place, and had never been known to have an infected person in it. Hence our author concludes very justly that a pestilent dis∣ease
<PB N="147" REF="036687_0502_100AA4A2403AA3B8"/>
is not always epidemic, nor is an epidemic always danger∣ous, nor is pestilence necessarily common to many people; but that the spreading of a disease by contagion, is wholly an acci∣dental circumstance.</P>
<BIBL>See p. 13, 14, of Diemerbroeck de peste.</BIBL>
<P>On this last fact, I will only observe, that the year it hap∣pened, was 1661, the beginning of the constitution which pro∣duced the augmented violence of the diseases of London, as re∣lated by Sydenham, and the constitution which occasioned the plague in Holland in 1663 and 4, and that in London in 1665.</P>
<P>It is to be regretted that those able physicians and accurate ob∣servers had not extended their views of the subject to a preval∣ence of that pestilential constitution, in various countries, at one and the same time, instead of restricting their observations, each to his own country.</P>
<P>The author of the Traité de la peste, who was a warm stick∣ier for the origin of the plague at Marseilles in 1720 from im∣portation, and wrote a treatise to prove it, has however demon∣strated the contrary. He has admitted that the air of Marseilles was pestilential and produced diseases marked with buboes and carbuncles, in the autumn preceding its supposed importation. But this is not all; he has recorded facts which confirm all that has been cited from Alpinus, Savary, Russel and others, that the contagion of the plague will not spread the disease in an atmos∣phere not favorable to its propagation. He informs us, that the disease spread from Marseilles, in spite of all precautions, and infected more than fifty villages of Provence. This was ascribed to infected goods conveyed from Marseilles. Yet the surround∣ing provinces of Languedoc, Velais, Dauphiné and others, which he acknowledges to have been inundated with goods from the same city, escaped all infection. In Provence, the distem∣per reached the inhabitants of mountains and was not even ar∣rested by the rigors of winter; while in the adjoining territories, no person was affected, tho equally exposed to infection. The author remarks further, that the disease passed over some villages, and infected others beyond them; for which no reason could be assigned, while all were alike exposed.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="036687_0503_100AA4A3CF1E0A78"/>These facts were very surprising and unaccountable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the au∣thor, Chicoyneau; yet there is no difficulty in explaining them, on the principle for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ch I contend; that the propag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion of the disease depends entirely on a favorable state of the atmosphere, and not the least on contagion.</P>
<P>Almost all the supposed instances of infection from merchan∣dize, related in authors, when investigated, are found to be mere suppositions and conjectures, raised and spread by vulgar credulity, without the least foundation, and afterwards recorded as facts, by medical writers, who are infinitely less excusable, than other people. I have investigated many such instances in America, where reports had become popular, and grown into such credit, as to be generally believed and received as facts, and I have, in every case, found evidence amounting to demon∣stration, that those reports were idle surmises, very often puerile in their origin, and utterly unsupported by facts. Some of the received opinions, in regard to the imported infection of plagues in Europe, when subjected to careful scrutiny, prove to be equal∣ly destitute of foundation. Among these, are the opinions, re∣ceived and recorded by grave writers, relative to the London plague of 1665, and that at Marseilles in 1720.</P>
<P>The supposition that the plague was conveyed from Marseilles into fifty villages of Provence, by means of merchandize, ap∣pears to be no better founded. Setting aside the errors of vul∣gar tales, in which such opinions usually originate, it is utterly against all probability that goods sold from shops and warehouses should contain infection. If they are ever infected, it must be by being used by the sick; but the sick do not use the goods in shops and stores; they are confined to their rooms; and rarely indeed are their bedding and clothes, sent to market. Goods, the most susceptible of infection, as woollen and cotton, may lie in store during the plague, without any taint that can excite disease. In America we know this to be fact. In every town, where the fever has prevailed, shops and warehouses filled with such sorts of goods, are open long after the disease has appear∣ed, and until the air of the streets has become so pestilential, as to excite the disease in a few hours in healthy strangers; nay,
<PB N="149" REF="036687_0504_100AA4A6F5C1DB28"/>
some of these shops are open, during the whole time, of the rage o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r worst plagues; yet even cotton and woollen cloths have never, in any instance, contracted infection so as to com∣municate the disease afterwards to those who handled or used them. I will venture to aver that all the reports in Europe about the propagation of the plague from town to town, and country to country, by merchandize, are the offspring of vulgar tales. It is possible that garments <HI>worn by the sick</HI> and <HI>not cleansed,</HI> may excite the disease in a sound body; but such garments, to re∣tain the infection, must be closely packed in bales, chests or boxes, or the action of the air will destroy the infection, in a few days. And whenever an instance of this kind happens, the disease will die with the patient first infected; it will rarely or never spread, unless the constitution of air is so pestilential, as to produce the disease without infection.</P>
<P>In these positions, I am warranted by a multitude of facts related of European plagues, and many that have occurred in America.</P>
<P>Hence, goods transported from Marseilles, during the plague, did <HI>not</HI> communicate the disease in Languedoc, Velais or Dau∣phiné. The true reason of the facts related by Chicoyneau, is, that the air of the whole country about Marseilles was pestilen∣tial, and affected most of the villages in Provence, altho some escaped. Further removed from the sea shore, in the contigu∣ous provinces, the air was less pestilential, and the disease did not appear. Goods were conveyed to all these provinces indis∣criminately; but they had no concern in the propagation of the plague. The plague appeared, where the pestilential principle was competent to produce it, the seat of which was at Marseilles, a large populous city; but which extended, as it always does, to some distance, beyond which it produced no plague. Wherever the distemper appeared, vulgar ignorance ascribed it to goods; and where it did not appear, after the reception of goods from Mar∣seilles, the vulgar and the learned all agree they could not ac∣count for it; they wondered that goods would not infect people in Languedoc, as well as in Provence—and all the writers on the subject in Europe, from that time to this, seemed to have been satisfied with wondering at the phenomenon.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="036687_0505_100AA4A9047A7C00"/>Of the truth of the doctrin, that the plague will not spread from infection, in an atmosphere not proper for it, we have in America most indubitable evidences.</P>
<P>In every pestilence that has affected our cities for six years past, great numbers of persons, when ill, have been removed into the country, or have been seized after removal, but not one in∣stance occurred of the spreading of the disease in the country to any extent, from such infected persons until the year 1798. There have been a few scattering instances, in which the nurses of such persons have received the disorder. These have been very rare; probably not in one instance of a hundred, has any person been affected by fomites from such diseased persons. Most violent cases of the pestilence, when removed into a pure air, exhibit no infection that is perceptible. This fact corresponds with what has been related of the importation of infected per∣sons and goods into Egypt in June, July and August, which pro∣duces no ill effect; but for a very good reason; the air of that country, during the inundation of the Nile, will not <HI>generate</HI> the plague; and hence the vulgar idea, that it is not imported, or will not spread from infection.</P>
<P>But not only do our country people escape infection, from dis∣eased citizens who sicken and die in their houses, but our cities also, when the constitution of air does not favor the disease, are not affected by the introduction of the worst cases from neigh∣boring cities. Thus in 1793, many persons from Philadelphia, entered New-York, in spite of precautions, taken by the police, sickened and died in boarding houses and other places, but with∣out communicating the disease in a single instance. In 1795, the case was reversed; New-York generated a contagious fever, but Philadelphia did not; and several persons, who left New-York, sickened and died in Philadelphia without infecting any person whatever.</P>
<P>It is unnecessary to multiply examples; the same has happen∣ed between Philadelphia and Baltimore; between Norfolk and the adjacent country; between Boston and Providence; in short there is not an exception to the remark, that infected persons, carried into towns and cities where the atmosphere has not been
<PB N="151" REF="036687_0506_100AA4AB159A9038"/>
disposed to <HI>generate</HI> an epidemic, have never propagated the dis∣ease. In every case, and the instances have been very numerous, the disease has disappeared with the recovery or death of the first or second patient.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In 1798 the first cases of the fever in Chester and Wilmington origin∣ated from Philadelphia; but the atmosphere also of the country in New-Jersey and Delaware actually <HI>generated</HI> the disease, in the neighboring districts, and so it did in Connecticut.</NOTE></P>
<P>But this is not all. In the same town or city, where the pesti∣lence has been general in a particular quarter, another part of the town or city, situated on better ventilated or more elevated land, has not only been free from the epidemic, but has possessed an air capable of resisting the infection of the diseased. This, to a cer∣tain degree, was the fact in Philadelphia, where no part of the city can be called <HI>elevated;</HI> yet in 1793 and 1797, few cases of the fever occurred in the western part of the city. But in New-York, New-Haven, Providence, New-London, Boston, and Newburyport, the disease has had its pestilential region, or quarter of the town, in which it became epidemic and infectious; but other parts of the town have been free from it. And in all such instances the most malignant cases, in persons seized in the pestilential region, and conveyed to the healthy part of the town, have exhibited no infection; or if a single nurse has taken the disease, of which I have heard of two or three instances, the infection has there ceased and produced no further effects.</P>
<P>These exempted parts of the towns are the more cleanly and airy situations. To this however occur two exceptions. One in Philadelphia, in 1798, the disease of which year was more virulent and more infectious, than in former years, and extended to healthy positions. The other exception is in New-London, the last summer also; in which town, the disease had indeed its pestilential region, marked distinctly, as before related; but this part of the town, where the disease raged, is as airy and well built, as any other quarter.</P>
<P>Evagrius remarked of the plague in his time, that it some∣times attacked certain parts of cities, and left others untouched. See the year 590.</P>
<P>Pestilential diseases then have an atmosphere in which they
<PB N="152" REF="036687_0507_100AA4ACA0262210"/>
rage with violence; but at a distance, they lose the power of in∣fecting, at least to a great degree. Van Swieten remarks this of the spotted fever in 1756—if healthy persons descended into the valleys where it was prevalent, they took the disease; but when removed into more airy situations, they infected no one.</P>
<BIBL>Vol. 16. 59.</BIBL>
<P>These facts all concur to establish the principle, that some oth∣er cause must act with infection, to render this pestilence epidem∣ic, or to give it effect. The consequence is unavoidable, that the infecting cause, is <HI>not</HI> a <HI>specific contagion.</HI></P>
<P>In the second place, the infecting power of the plague and other autumnal diseases, is susceptible of gradation, from the lowest point of danger, up to the highest; a circumstance that does not characterize the specific contagion of small-pox and measles. In America, we have seen the disease in every stage of virulence, except perhaps the very highest, like that in the days of Gallus and Volusian, that in the time of Evagrius, or that in the reign of Edward III, and a few others. The disease in Philadelphia in 1797 was more infectious than that in 1793, and that in 1798 still more than either. The fever in New-York in 1795 exhibited very little infection, not one case in twenty pro∣ceeding from any communication with the sick; but in 1798, the disease put on a more virulent aspect, and was more generally in∣fectious. In Baltimore, the disease in 1797 ran through all the grades of bilious fever, from an ordinary remittent, which for weeks prevailed without infection, to a contagious yellow fever.</P>
<P>But this is not all. During the same season, and in the same city, the disease exists in all its grades from an intermittent to the contagious yellow fever. It is a very frequent thing for persons seized with decided symptoms of the pestilential fever, to have the disease reduced by early applications, to a remittent or an intermittent. Of this I am an instance myself; having contracted the malignant fever in New-York in August 1798, from the air of the city, for I was near no diseased persons, and returned home, I was seized with the symptoms, tho not of the most violent kind. The fever was disturbed by early remedies, and I became convalescent; but in a few days, I relapsed and
<PB N="153" REF="036687_0508_100AA4AF5009F8E8"/>
the fever took the form of a regular tertian. Dr. Rush relates similar examples in the fever of 1793.</P>
<P>Lind, on diseases of hot climates, p. 179, remarks, that patients, with a mild intermittent, sent to Greenwich hospital, near a marsh, in Jamaica, soon grew worse, and their disease turned to a malignant yellow fever or mortal dysentery.</P>
<P>A multitude of such facts have been observed in America, which, with the remarkable history of the disease in Baltimore in 1797, seem to amount to a demonstration, that the plague and all autumnal bilious disorders, are of one species, differing only in their grades. Indeed the writers on the Levant plague, while they utterly deny such a sameness in kind between that disease and any other, have recorded facts to prove the doctrin here maintained.</P>
<P>P. Russel admits that the plague in Aleppo was of very vari∣ous degrees of malignity, and was not always infectious. He has even arranged the cases in several distinct classes, according to the various symptoms and degrees of mortality.</P>
<P>Lady W. Montague, in letter 31, has the following observa∣tions. "Those dreadful stories you have heard of the plague, have very little foundation in truth. I own I have much ado to reconcile myself to the sound of a word which has always given me such terrible ideas; tho I am convinced there is little more in it than in a fever." She then proceeds to relate, how she passed through several infected towns, that her cook was taken ill, and she was told, with a great cold—that she left her doctor to attend him, but the cook soon recovered, and both cook and doctor in a few days, arrived in health at Adrianople. She was then surprised to learn, that her cook had been ill with the plague. She concludes, from her own experience, that the air is never infected and that it is as easy to root the plague out of Turkey, as out of Italy and France.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Notwithstanding this disease was "rooted out of France," it hap∣pened that, in two years after Lady Montague wrote her letter, Mar∣seilles was almost depopulated by the disease!</NOTE> She remarks also that "many escape it"—which is certainly wonderful!</P>
<P>Just so carelessly people reason and draw conclusions, from a
<PB N="154" REF="036687_0509_100AA4B1752B1968"/>
single cursory observation, or an isolated fact; a practice among travellers, as among men of pretended science, which is the source of numberless errors. It is undoubtedly true, that the plague is often "little more than a fever;" but if Lady Mon∣tague had been in Cairo in 1580, or in 1736, or in Constanti∣nople in 543, or in 1751, or in London in 1665, or in Mar∣seilles in 1720, she would have thought the plague something more than an ordinary fever. The truth is, the disease exhibits dif∣ferent grades of violence, at different times.</P>
<P>Savary remarks, that such as <HI>catch</HI> the plague in Egypt in June, July and August are always cured.</P>
<P>So observes Mignot, in his history of the Turkish empire, vol. 2. p. 4, "the plague at certain times, is incurable; at oth∣ers, easy to be cured. The contagion is more or less strong, according to the state of the air."</P>
<P>Similar remarks occcur in the Traité de la peste. The author is full of his idea of contagion, but he says, the plague, tho al∣ways from one cause, appears differently in different places, and a small distance between them makes it appear like two different diseases, as at Montpelier and at Lyons.</P>
<P>Chandler, in his travels, gives us wonderful discoveries on this subject. He says, the disease proceeds from certain invisible animalcules, burrowing and forming their nest in the human body. These are imported annually into Smyrna—they are least fatal at the beginning, and latter end of the season. If they ar∣rive early in the spring, they are weak, but gather strength, mul∣tiply and then perish!!</P>
<P>Such silly opinions are gravely recorded in books, yet they prove that infection is of very different degrees of strength, or that it is the state of the air, and not infection, which produces the disease.</P>
<P>P. Alpinus, followed by Volney, Savary and others, speaks of this difference in the malignity of the plague; but he ascribes it to the <HI>place</HI> where the disease originates. He says, the conta∣gion from Barbary is more putrid and virulent, than from Greece and Syria, and instances that of 1580.</P>
<BIBL>Vol. 3. p. 61 and 2.</BIBL>
<P><PB N="155" REF="036687_0510_100AA4B3C5A37370"/>It is true that some of the most violent plagues have first ap∣peared in Ethiopia or Barbary, as in the time of Thucydides, in 252, in 1580, in 1736; but these writers ought to have re∣collected that others equally violent have originated in Egypt, in China, in Italy and in Constantinople. Witness that in 542 which began near Pelusium in Lower Egypt, those of 1347 and of 1450 which began in China or other parts of Asia, and that of 745 which commenced in Calabria, in the kingdom of Naples. They might have observed also, that many plagues, of the most destructive kind, have appeared at once in twenty or more of the cities of Europe. These considerations would have detected the puerilty of the notion, that contagion from one country is more "putrid and virulent" than from another, and led the observers of nature to the true cause of these different grades of malignan∣cy, different states of the atmosphere in different periods.</P>
<P>Fernelius divides epidemics into three kinds: An epidemy from exhalations or vapor from the earth; from great changes of seasons; and from an occult, malignant quality in the air; the last, he maintains, is the only true cause of the pestis; the others are preparatory to it; but these causes often unite, and the plague then becomes most severe. Putrid exhalations do not a∣lone produce the plague, but prepare for it and aid its progress. Hence it does not affect all places or all men alike—but is most severe in maritime places; in those exposed to the south; warm and humid, abounding with impure exhalations.</P>
<BIBL>De Morb. Pest. 189.</BIBL>
<P>There is a great deal of truth in these observations, and I cannot but remark how much more correct these authors are who often saw the plague, than Mead and others who had no such advantages.</P>
<P>The violence of the pestilential principle, aided by seasons re∣markably debilitating, has sometimes dispatched the human race, with terrible rapidity. The more usual course of the plague is from five to seven days, when death or a favorable crisis takes place. But to this there have been some dismal exceptions. The disease described by Evagrius in 590, generally put an end to life in three days. This also was the period of the crisis in
<PB N="156" REF="036687_0511_100AA4B54D57C968"/>
the dreadful plague, in the days of Vortigern, in 448, and the subsequent years. In the similar calamity of 1348, few patients lived beyond the third day.</P>
<P>In many instances, during these more general plagues, per∣sons have died suddenly, as in an apoplexy; as in the pestilence at Narbonne in 1534, where men frequently fell dead as they were walking or conversing; of which Skenkius himself was of∣ten an eye-witness. He cites as authorities for the same fact, Valleriola, Gemma, Salius and Cardanus. See page 765. The same happened in the pestilence described by Evagrius; and au∣thors relate that no less than eighty persons, fell dead in a pro∣cession instituted by St. Gregory, about the year 590.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This disease sometimes attacks in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rm of an apoplexy; in other cases, persons are indisposed, for some days, but able to walk, while the disease is secretly undermining the animal powers. Such per∣sons suddenly pass from apparent health to their graves.</NOTE></P>
<P>Dion Cassius mentions an expedition of a Roman army into Arabia Felix; in which most of the soldiers perished by unusual distempers. Many of them were seized in the head; the brain dissolved, and the disease falling upon the throat, suffocation speedily ended life. This was evidently the effect of extreme heat, producing excessive excitement and soon followed by a to∣tal debility of the nervous system.</P>
<P>Terrible indeed must be that virulence of the pestilential prin∣ciple, which bids defiance to cold. Yet such has been the case in a number of plagues. In the pestilence of 543, says Proco∣pius, the diseas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> invaded some places in summer; others in win∣ter. Evagrius makes the same remark of the plague in 590. The black pestilence of 1348 attacked countries, in northern lat∣itudes, in winter or summer, without discrimination. The dis∣ease in Provence in 1720, was not controlled by the rigors of winter. The pestilence in 1591, raged thro a cold wint<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in Revel and Narva, in the 59th degree of north latitude. "Some∣times, says Fernelius, the most intolerable heat of summer pro∣duces no pestilential disorder, at othe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, the plague breaks out in winter, and ceases in the midst of summer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in autumn." p. 189.</P>
<P>Diemerbroeck remarks that a plague which begins in winter or autumn, is more violent and of longer duration, than one which
<PB N="157" REF="036687_0512_100AA4B81B987FB8"/>
begins in other seasons. So says Peter Paschal, an author cited by Diemerbroeck; the plague which begins in spring or summer ends in winter; that which begins in autumn or winter, is of longer continuance.</P>
<P>The reason of this diversity is very obvious. The pestilence which appears in winter, in northern latitudes, can proceed only from a disposition of the atmosphere; for cold totally destroys all infection of that disease, and all the influence of putrid ex∣halations. Whenever therefore the plague invades man in cold weather, it demonstrates a <HI>more malignant</HI> state of the air, and one that is not controlled by cold weather or frost. Such a state of the air must of course produce more fatal effects, than an in∣ferior force in the pestilential principle, which perhaps requires the aid of heat, humidity and noxious exhalations to produce a very violent plague. Thanks to heaven, most of the pestilences that afflict mankind are of this latter, or subordinate degree; in which the real plague is limited to places highly charged with morbid substances, which it is in the power of man to dissipate or remove. A vast proportion of all pestilential diseases are found to rage only in cities, jails, camps, and crowded ships, and may be avoided or mitigated by human means.</P>
<P>At the same time, historical facts warrant me in believing, that the pestilential principle does, at times, acquire a virulence, that proves fatal to life, in every season and every situation; assailing indiscriminately the city and the cottage; the cleanly dwellings of the rich and the filthy cells of the poor; the highest hills, as well as the valleys, the borders of morasses, and the nauseous alleys of a populous town. During this melancholy state of the elements of life, and such was their condition during the rava∣ges of the black pestilence in the reign of Edward III. men are however not to despair of preserving life; but the means consist in applications to the human body, calculated to guard, not against infection so much, as against <HI>debility,</HI> the deciding proxi∣mate cause of the malady.</P>
<P>Historians mention a remarkable difference in the operation of the two very furious plagues, in 1348 and 1361. That of 1348 was most fatal to the poor; but that of 1361 was most mortal among the nobility and gentry, and on hills and mountains, which

usually escape. In the first case then, morbid exhalations consti∣tuted an influential cause in producing the malady—in the latter case, they operated as a shield or antisceptic—and the facts de∣monstrate the various force of the elemental causes.</P>
<P>In the third place, to give effect to the infection of the plague, and at times, to other autumnal diseases, there must be an apt or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> disposition in the human body. This is admitted by Hip∣pocrates, who observes that body differs from body, the nature of one man, from that of another, the nutriment of one, from that of another, and the same things are not alike pernicious to one species of animals, as to another. Hence he accounts for diseases invading one kind of animals at one time, another spe∣cies at a different time, and different species having their various distempers.</P>
<BIBL>Lib. de flatibus.</BIBL>
<P>Thus Galen remarks, that the same causes do not affect all persons alike; if they did, violent heat, excessive fatigue or drinking or anger, or grief, would produce fever in every per∣son; and for the same reason, all persons alike would be seized with pestilence, during the reign of the dog-star.</P>
<BIBL>De dif. seb. cap. 4.</BIBL>
<P>In conformity to these ideas, Diemerbroeck, p. 50, lays it down as a principle, that no person will receive infection, unless his body has an <HI>aptitudinem,</HI> a fitness, or disposition to receive it, arising from some secret quality or bad state of the system.</P>
<P>On this point, we reason without knowing causes; all we can do is to collect and arrange facts, which decide in favor of this hypothesis. We are compelled to admit the principle, not only as it respects the operation of infection, but also of the ele∣mental or primary atmospheric cause of pestilence, which makes an evident distinction, at times, between persons of different habits, families, and nations.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Medical men are not agreed, as to the nature of what is called <HI>pre∣disposition.</HI> Brown, in Elements of Medicin, defines it to be a less degree of the disease; that is, the commencement of the disease. I suspect this definition, properly limited, to be nearly just. It is probable that all fevers are the effects of debility, and that when this debility com∣mences, a person may be said to be <HI>predisposed to disease;</HI> altho the disease may not be formed in many days or weeks after, or may be prevented by early applications.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="036687_0514_100AA4BBC7CA2400"/>These facts came under the observation of Procopius and Eva∣grius. In 543, says the former, no physician or attendant caught the distemper—while many were seized they knew not from what cause and suddenly died. Many, says Evagrius, who fled from infected places, remained safe themselves, while they communi∣cated the disease to others. Many who remained with the sick and freely handled them, wholly escaped. Others, in despair for the loss of friends, threw themselves in the way of infection, but were not able to contract the disease; while others received the disease by the slightest connection with infected houses, or in open market.</P>
<P>We have many memorable examples of a similar nature in A∣merica —they are too numerous to be specified. I suspect how∣ever that four fifths of such cases are improperly ascribed to infec∣tion.</P>
<P>Diemerbroeck relates that in the height of the plague at Nimeguen, the air was so bad, that all places were nearly a∣like, as to the danger of infection; persons received the disease with or without intercourse with the sick.</P>
<P>Sometimes the plague discriminates between natives of differ∣ent countries. The French fugitives from the West-Indies, who have resided in our cities during pestilence have generally escaped. This is not however very remarkable; as they are accustomed to a climate which is, like our summers, peculiarly fitted to pro∣duce a similar disease; at the same time, their manner of living is better suited to the warm season, than that of our own citizens.</P>
<P>But a similar discrimination has been often observed, among natives of the same latitudes, or nearly the same. Thus Carda∣nus, lib. 8, relates that in a pestilence at Basle, the Swiss only were affected; the French, Italians and Germans escaped. John Utenhovius relates that in a plague in Denmark, all strangers, as English, Germans and Hollanders escaped, altho they resided in families and associated freely with the infected. The Sudor Anglicus, when it first appeared in England, attacked none but the English; but in subsequent pestilential constitutions, it inva∣ded almost all Europe.</P>
<P>We have in America most illustrious examples of the distinc∣tion above mentioned. In the sweeping pestilence of 1618, when
<PB N="160" REF="036687_0515_100AA4BD5A77CD78"/>
almost all the Indians perished, on a tract of three hundred miles in extent, some white men wintered in the country and associated freely with the sick, without injury. In a similar pestilence a∣mong the Indians on Nantucket, in 1763, not a white man was affected, tho never so much exposed to infection. Two or three other instances have come to my knowledge. A like discrimi∣nation took place in Egypt in the time of Moses.</P>
<P>Sometimes the plague singles out particular families. Thus Diemerbroeck observed in the plague at Nimeguen, whole fami∣lies, by a secret sympathy, were seized all at one time; and in some instances, where the members of the same family lived, at a distance from each other, in different parts of the city, they were all attacked nearly at the same time. What is more remark∣able, the same fact was repeatedly observed, where the members of the same family lived in different towns. Of this there were many exemples. One man by the name of Van Dans, to pre∣serve his children from infection, sent two of them to Gorcum in Holland, to reside with his friends, and kept the third at home. There was no pestilential disease in Gorcum, at that time, and the two children remained in health for two or three months; but at last both were seized with the plague and died, at the same time that the father and another child died with it in Nimeguen. The mother was seized, but recovered. About the same time, a sister, and two or three other children, residing with another sister, at a distance, and several more remote relations of the fam∣ily, all perished with the same disease.</P>
<P>So it is related by Evagrius, who was surprised at the fact, that particular families, sometimes only one or two, were arres∣ted by the plague, while all the other inhabitants of the city re∣mained in health. But he remarks further, that those who esca∣ped, the first year, experienced the like calamity in the next. This fact, by the way, is common, and should have led Evagri∣us and others to observe the progressiveness of the pestilential cause.</P>
<P>Pliny, lib. 7. ca. 50, remarks that old people are usually ex∣empt from attacks of the plague; but that all nations are subject to pestilential diseases, which invade them by kinds or classes,
<PB N="161" REF="036687_0516_100AA4C11F50C110"/>
sometimes falling on servants, sometimes on nobles, and on oth∣ers by grades or ranks. Nature, says this author, has even pre∣scribed certain laws to diseases. The last remark should have excited the minds of physicians to discover these laws. Such laws certainly exist, and epidemics of all kinds are connected in principle.</P>
<P>I have met with other instances of discrimination, perhaps more remarkable. One is related from John Helwigius, in Bo∣netus' Collection of Northern Medicine, page 228. In 1621, when the small-pox raged with great mortality, it was remarked that persons of the same blood, as brothers, cousins and other relatives, living at a great distance from each other, and as far as from Nuremberg to Lyons in France, were seized with the disease at one and the same time. I draw no important conse∣quences from this fact, because this disease is not <HI>limited</HI> to par∣ticular families, altho it may seize one family before it does another.</P>
<P>Another instance is related by Van Swieten, Vol. 16, from Heister, an author of undoubted credit. At Altdorf, in Fran∣conia, broke out in 1711, a malignant fever, approaching to the plague in violence, but not with the glandular tumors. This disease attacked none, but the students or others of the university; but it seized them wherever they were dispersed in private fami∣lies, in all parts of the town. It seized the professors also and their families, but went no farther by infection. It attacked also the printer to the university and his workmen, tho at a distance from the college; while another printer, contiguous to the col∣lege, escaped. Students also belonging to the university, tho at home, as at Nuremburg, were seized. It was thus restricted in its attacks, and exhibited no infection, beyond these descriptions of persons.</P>
<P>It must not be omitted, that this was a very sickly period in all the north of Europe. In this same year, the plague raged in Copenhagen, and it had in the preceding years, spread over Po∣land and along the Baltic.</P>
<P>This fact at Altdorf is by far the most singular, that I have found in history; but that a violent disease should attack persons of one blood, and not of another, is less surprizing. We have
<PB N="162" REF="036687_0517_100AA4C329E87078"/>
recent proofs of this discrimination in America. In 1796, three persons of one name in Hartford, two brothers and a cousin, were suddenly seized with a violent fever, of a putrid tendency, tho in winter, and carried off within a few days of each other. At the same time, two or three others of the family were seized less violently in the same town and recovered; and what is more singular, two other brothers, one in Litchfield, 30 miles from Hartford, and another in New-York, 130 miles distant, were attacked nearly at the same time, and were very ill, but survived. No infection could have existed in most of these cases, as the per∣sons did not see each other.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>A curious fact is related to me by Dr. Dutton of Oxford, in Der∣by. In the year 1795, almost every <HI>male</HI> child, born in the beginning of the year, in that and the adjacent towns, died within a fortnight by convulsions, but <HI>no female</HI> child was affected. This was observed to be more frequent in families that had been affected by the scarlatina, in the preceding year.</P>
<P>It will be remarked that this was near the district of country which had suffered by a pestilential fever and dysentery.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>Another instance occurred in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and is stated to me by the attending physician.</P>
<P>In October 1791, a young woman, belonging to a family in that town, but who had, for two years, lived at a distance of three miles from her father's house, was seized with a putrid bil∣ious fever. Her mother repaired to the place and nursed her, till she was convalescent. None of the family visited her while sick, except the father occasionally, and her eldest sister. The latter took the place of the mother, for a few days, who was called home to attend two other children who were seized with the same disease, and who had never been exposed to infection. Before these recovered, three others were taken with the fever in the same family. The three last had doubtless assisted in nurs∣ing the sick or been into their rooms, and therefore might have been infected.</P>
<P>In April following, another of the children, who had lived at a distance from the family and had not been permitted to see any of the sick, was seized with the same fever, at the house where she lived. In the same month, the father and another child, were taken with it at home. Not one of the family, at
<PB N="163" REF="036687_0518_100AA4C55039FDE0"/>
home or abroad, escaped, except the mother, who had nursed all the sick, except one, and was most exposed to infection. The diseased were very offensive, but all recovered, except one; and neither my informant, the attending physician, nor any nurse or visitor, out of the family, was in the least injured by infection.</P>
<BIBL>M. S. letter from Dr. Wm. Gamage.</BIBL>
<P>This disease was a family pestilence, which began in autumn, was suspended by the cold of winter, and revived in spring. It resembles, on a small scale, the great plagues in London and Marseilles, and many others, in which a few cases occurred, in the preceding autumn, clearly marking a pestilential state of air, in that particular city, which state was arrested in its operation by cold in winter, but again exhibited its effects in spring.</P>
<P>The limitation of the disease to a particular family, of the same blood, or disposition to be affected by a certain morbid state of air, is a mysterious phenomenon, but the fact is so well as∣certained, as to leave no room to question its existence. We can ascribe it only to a general state of air, fitted to produce injuri∣ous or fatal effects on bodies of a particular temperament, which temperament or disposition consists in the invisible structure or organization. It is demonstrated that infection cannot be the only cause of the diseases in these families; and of course we are compelled to admit the existence of another cause, which can only be the atmosphere, for no other cause extends its operation to the distance at which the effects were produced.</P>
<P>It is on this principle alone that particular persons or families escape the worst plagues that have afflicted mankind, as related by Evagrius, and all authors on the subject, and of which we have numerous instances in America. But,</P>
<LG>
<L>"Why drew Marseilles' good bishop purer breath,</L>
<L>When nature sickened and each gale was death?"</L>
</LG>
<P>is the interrogatory of an inimitable poet, which has never been answered; for on this subject, as on every other, we are baffled and confounded, when we attempt to reach primary natural cau∣ses. The interior organization of animals and vegetables, is far beyond the limits of human investigation.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="036687_0519_100AA4C7C41F8EA8"/>Lord Veruclam has left a passage confirmatory of the foregoing principles. "The plague, says this great observer of facts, is not easily received by those that continually attend the sick, as physicians; nor again by old people, and such as are of a dry, cold complexion. On the other hand, the plague soonest seizes those that come out of fresh air, those that are fasting and chil∣dren. It is also noted to go in a blood, more than from stran∣ger to stranger."</P>
<BIBL>Works, Vol. 3.</BIBL>
<P>It is in analogy with the foregoing facts, that animals of differ∣ent species are affected with epidemic diseases, which bear a si∣militude in their predominant symptoms, at different stages of a pestilential constitution of air. Sometimes, horses, cattle and sheep feel the operation of the destructive principle, at the same time with man. At other times, this principle will affect cattle a year before it reaches mankind. Sometimes, it first assails the human race, and afterwards the irrational parts of creation. In some years one species of animals is affected; the next year, a∣nother. Thus horses experienced the epidemic of 1793, in the vicinity of Philadelphia, in the winter following the plague in that city. The cats perished in 1797. The fish in James' river died in 1797, the oysters on the shores of Connecticut sickened in 1794, and the fowls in Connecticut in 1796.</P>
<P>Not unfrequently, the force of the pestilential principle, in one country, seems to expend itself principally on the brute creation; while, in the same year, or succession of years, its principal ope∣ration, in a neighboring country, is experienced by mankind. Thus in 1712 and 13, a very pestilential period, the cattle in Italy, Germany and other places received the full force of the pestilence, in a desolating epidemic, while in Austria, Hungary and the east, the pestilence fell on men. Thus also in 1770, while a dreadful plague was raging in Turkey and Poland, a mor∣tal distemper swept away the cattle in Holland, Flanders and some parts of England, and malignant fevers prevailed in some parts of America.</P>
<P>That the great general cause of the diseases, among the differ∣ent species of animals, is the same, is obvious from this consid∣eration, that during the same constitution of air, or pestilential
<PB N="165" REF="036687_0520_100AA4CA6F05FAA8"/>
period, the diseases of man and beast have a number of similar symptoms; such was the fact in Austria, Italy and Germany in 1712 and 13; and such has been the case in the United States.</P>
<P>In conformity with the general principle above mentioned, we observe that however analogous may be the symptoms of diseases in man and beast, the distempers of one rarely infect the other. Infection is limited usually to that species of animals, which have an aptness to receive the operation of the primary atmospheric cause of the disease. Thus diseased horses do not infect men, nor diseased men, horses. So when a plague attacks the natives of a particular country only, the infection, like the primary cause of the disease, is restricted in its operation to those particular peo∣ple. But this is rarely or never the case with the specific conta∣gion of the small-pox and measles, in regard to mankind.</P>
<P>Authors indeed relate that hogs, dogs and poultry, feeding on highly infected articles, or wallowing in the filth thrown from houses, during the plague, have died with a similar disease. A few instances are mentioned by Diemerbroeck, Boccace and others. Hodges mentions a disease taken from a horse, which ceased without becoming epidemic.</P>
<P>But these isolated facts form no exception to the general rule; for such distempers never spread and become epidemic. They only prove my general doctrin, that the contagious quality of plague, is not a specific principle, but a quality capable of every possible degree of force—that in its lower or more attenuated forms, it affects few or no persons whatever; but it <HI>may</HI> be so concentrated or condensed, as to destroy life, not only in bodies of an aptitude to receive the poison, but also in other species of animals, which have no such aptitude. Hence, the poison gen∣erated in the clothes of the sick, when put into chests or pack∣ages, uncleansed, in hot weather, may be so concentrated or in∣creased by fermentation, as to kill almost instantly, the person who opens them. But an infectious disease thus produced, will never spread far, without the aid of a state of air which is pesti∣lential. On the other hand, from thousands of instances in books, and within the knowledge of Americans, who are annu∣ally, monthly and weekly receiving infection from the West-Indies,
<PB N="166" REF="036687_0521_100AA4CBF5A5FA70"/>
we know that the infection soon disappears in a healthy constitution of air. It may be so virulent as to give disease to the persons who first approach it; but in these the disease is ex∣tinguished.</P>
<P>It should be further remarked, as a useful hint, that persons removing suddenly from fresh ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to an infected place, are doubly exposed. The increase of the pestilential causes is usually grad∣ual; therefore persons who live within their operation, are in∣sensibly fitted, by the flexible texture of the system, to sustain their effects. But sudden changes are very dangerous. The body will hardly ever sustain great changes in the powers of ex∣citement, when suddenly made. Hence the extreme danger of removing from fresh to infected air; and sometimes, of removing from infected to fresh air. The sudden alteration in the stimu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us operating on the system, may be as fatal in one case as the other.</P>
<P>Another distinguishing circumstance, in pestilential diseases, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd one that decisively marks different grades of violence in the causes, is, the manner in which the disease invades neighboring cities. It is always observed, that during the prevalence of the plague, it attacks cities or towns at some distance, in one year, leaving other towns in the intervals between them, untouched; the next year perhaps, or the second year after, it invades those intermediate towns which had escaped. This is always the fact, and it has puzzled all authors who have related it; yet the fact has never been accounted for, as its causes have never been un∣derstood. Mead, who was not personally acquainted with this disease and whose theory led him to explain all its phenomena by contagion, was greatly embarrassed with this fact. He in∣stances the escape of Vicenza, in Italy, 1575, when Verona and Padua, one on each side of Vicenza, were severely afflicted; and in the next year, Vicenza was desolated, when Verona and Padua were exempt. He could not explain how the infection, which came from Trent, where the disease first appeared, should <HI>pass over Vicenza</HI> and reach a more distant city.</P>
<P>Erroneous theories are the source of innumerable mischiefs in science. The fact is a common one, and on a just view of the causes of pestilence, is very easily explained. And what is
<PB N="167" REF="036687_0522_100AA4CD80ADB8A8"/>
surprizing, Procopius and Evagrius have recorded facts which afford a clue to the secret, altho medical writers, from their days to the present time, have suffered them to pass without no∣tice. Procopius mentions that the pestilence which began in 542, spread over the earth, but "if it passed by a particular country at first, or <HI>slightly affected it,</HI> it soon returned upon it with the same desolating rage, which other places had experi∣enced." Evagrius also remarks, that "some places were more slightly affected;" and in another passage he says, that in some cities a few families were seized the first year, and the rest of the city, the year following.</P>
<P>Here we have a clue to the mystery. The plague seizes first the cities and towns where the <HI>general,</HI> or <HI>local causes</HI> are the most powerful. Thus, the plague of 1575, which puzzled Mead so much, commenced in Trent on the Adige, which, all geographers agree, is a most unhealthy place. It next attacked Verona and Padua for a similar reason, and afterwards Vicenza, the intermediate town. The general cause, in the elements, had been four or five years in operation, producing a fatal spotted fe∣ver, in most parts of Europe, continually increasing in malig∣nancy, until it arose to the plague, and its crisis must naturally be in places where it was most aided by local causes, or where the general cause first increased to its full force.</P>
<P>The slight pestilences mentioned by Procopius and Evagrius, were the <HI>precursors</HI> of the severe plagues to follow; precisely as in London and Marseilles, a terrible plague was preceded, in a former year, with malignant fevers and a few cases of plague. All history affords a tissue of proof, that the plague is never an isolated disease, starting up suddenly from infection; but the <HI>crisis of a series of violent diseases.</HI> To this I challenge the par∣tizans of specific contagion to name an exception.</P>
<P>In America, we are able to solve the phenomenon of the es∣cape of places intervening between infected towns. We find, without an exception, that when two cities are infested with pes∣tilence, and an intervening place is not, if that intervening town is to be attacked the following year, the precursors of the dis∣ease appear there, during the pestilence in the towns on each side
<PB N="168" REF="036687_0523_100AA4CFD8D3A2F8"/>
of it. Thus the late series of plagues <HI>began</HI> in New-York in 1791, in Water and Front streets, where the <HI>local</HI> causes were most powerful. At this time, appeared sporadic cases of bilious fever, more malignant than usual, in various parts of the country, every where, indicating the commencement of a pestilential state of air.</P>
<P>In 1792, these indications continued, and in a few cases ap∣peared the scarlatina, a new evidence of the reigning constitu∣tion.</P>
<P>In 1793, the crisis arrived in Philadelphia, with serious mor∣tality; and the indications of pestilence appeared in a great in∣crease of mortality, in many parts of the country.</P>
<P>At the close of this year, New-Haven, which was to be next attacked, began to show the forerunners of the disease, in the scarlatina, and in an increase of mortality of about one fifth. In the next summer 1794 appeared the bilious plague. In the same season appeared the disease in Baltimore, distant from New-Haven about 290 miles, while Philadelphia and New-York, in∣tervening cities, escaped. But let it be observed, that a num∣ber of cases of the disease occurred in Philadelphia; and New-York which was to be assailed in the next season, produced its precursors, in about thirty cases of violent bilious fever, ending in black vomit. Thus while on the extremes, New-Haven and Baltimore were severely visited, the approaching pestilence was announced in New-York, by a pestilential atmosphere, of a less degree of malignancy.</P>
<P>In 1795 appeared the epidemic in New-York and in Norfolk, Virginia; while Philadelphia and Baltimore, intermediate cities, escaped, altho the heat and humidity of the season every where rendered the country unhealthy. In this year the pestilential principle showed itself in New-London and Providence, in dis∣tinctly marked cases of the bilious plague.</P>
<P>In 1796, scattering cases occurred in the northern parts of America. In Newburyport, pestilence prevailed, but preceded by an increase of mortality, its precursor. The same disease prevailed in Boston, New-York, and Charleston, while inter∣mediate towns escaped.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="036687_0524_100AA4D27970AA88"/>In 1797, it appeared in Providence, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Norfolk, while New-York escaped an epidemic, but a few very malignant cases occurred, showing the existence of the general cause.</P>
<P>So far as I can discover, not a spot on the globe has ever been visited with pestilence, without its precursors, sometimes one, two or three years, but always for some months, before its in∣vasion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thucydides relates that the year of the plague at Athens was re∣markably free from other diseases preceding, and that the plague fell suddenly on the citizens. This may seem an exception to my remark; but is not; for all the neighboring people were collected into the city; which was besieged; a circumstance alone sufficient to account for the sudden attack of the disease.</NOTE></P>
<P>If we had bills of mortality for Vicenza, in the years 1570 to 1576, or a history of the diseases in the town, during that period, I pledge myself that we should find, that during the plague in Verona and Padua, on each side in 1575, some ma∣lignant disease prevailed in Vicenza, which greatly swelled the bill of mortality for that year, and which announced, with al∣most infallible certainty, the approach of the plague. Instead therefore of saying Vicenza escaped the pestilence, the first year, when Verona and Padua were afflicted, we should say, the pesti∣lence had <HI>commenced</HI> in less malignant distempers, but its crisis in Vicenza was to be a year later. This is the whole mystery, and the uniformity of this series of facts from the days of Procopius to this hour, renders it a matter of astonishment, that medical and other scientific men, should have overlooked this great law of epidemic pestilence.</P>
<P>Diemerbroeck remarks the fact, as well as Procopius and Eva∣grius, that pestilence does not invade all places at once, but now this place, now that, and thus, in a series of years, extending over the earth. See p. 50 of Diemerbroeck, and the foregoing history of the plagues in Justinian's reign. But no author seems to have observed the progression of a general pestilential princi∣ple, which, if it does not occasion plague in two contiguous towns, the same year, occasions plague in one, and other malig∣nant diseases in the other, which certainly indicate its approach.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="036687_0525_100AA4D491223330"/>To prove that infection has no concern in this last mentioned phenomenon, according to the theory of Mead and others, it may be observed that the invasion of the disease in cities, is perfectly analogous to its invasion of a whole country. The disease rare∣ly begins at one point and spreads from that, like the radii from the center of a circle, nor does it follow the nurses and attend∣ants of the persons first seized. On the other hand it starts up in various distant parts of the town, among people who have no in∣tercourse with the infected. To this, it may be alleged, the fe∣vers of Philadelphia in 1793 and 7 are exceptions; but on crit∣ical examination, I find they are not. That in New-Haven may be an exception. Thus Evagrius relates, that at the beginning, the plague seized particular families, sometimes only one or two, and the rest of the town escaped, till the next year.</P>
<P>Baronius from Gregory of Tours has well described the first progress of the plague, in 590, in the southern cities of France. He says the disease was introduced by a vessel from Spain; the first record I can find of supposed importation by water. But when introduced, it did not seize every house at one time but left intervals. "Nec statim hoc incendium luis per domos spargitur totas, sed interrupto certi temporis spatio, ac velut in segetem flamma accensa, urbem totam morbi incendio conflagravit." Vol. 8. 15. The metaphor here employed will appear striking to those who have seen a field of stubble or the woods on fire, in a windy day. The fact also corresponds exactly with what has been observed in London, Marseilles and other places, that the disease at first starts up here and there, in remote situations; then subsides for weeks perhaps, before it spreads and becomes popular.</P>
<P>Thus in Nimeguen, a few cases occurred in November; then there was an interval of suspension; in January, more cases, and in March, the disease began to assume the shape of an epidemic.</P>
<BIBL>Diem. p. 6.</BIBL>
<P>In London, says Hodge, two or three persons died, in one family, with symptoms of the plague in 1664.—In the holidays, occurred another case—but a hard frost suspended the action of the infection. The diseased were at first shut up and guarded; but to no purpose. An order was issued and enforced, that a red cross should be set on infected houses, with these words inscribed, "Lord have mercy on us."—</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="036687_0526_100AA4D617619880"/>In May and June the disease to use the author's own words, "reigned doubtfully;" sometimes in one part and sometimes in another; and to use Hodges quaint expression, "it kept up a running fight," alternately inspiring hope and fear. This de∣scription is less elegant than that of Baronius, but it expresses the same ideas of the first progress of the plague.</P>
<P>It is strange however that the writers should not have seen that their facts totally overthrow their own ideas of infection; it being impossible, that the operation of infection should be thus suspended, and afterwards revived. Frost totally annihilates in∣fection, altho it does not destroy the atmospheric cause of disea∣ses. Similar, in all respects, was the commencement of the plague at Marseilles in 1720. At first a few persons died sudden∣ly, then the disease disappeared, and the citizens supposed it to be ended. Repeated hopes and fears were revived by the alter∣nate appearance and disappearance of the malady, for some weeks in May and June. Yet the author who has related these facts made a book to prove its origin from Levant infection! so absurd are men when they attempt to support preconceived systems!—</P>
<P>In America, the pestilential fever has first made its appearance, in a similar manner. It has every where been preceded by an in∣crease of mortality, and in most places, has appeared in the scattering, interrupted manner of the plagues before mentioned. In Philadelphia in 1797, and still more in 1798, scattering cases occurred in June and July, several weeks before the arrival of the supposed fomites, from the West-Indies. The same fact occur∣red in New-York in 1795; some cases appeared two weeks be∣fore the arrival of the Zephyr, the supposed source of infection. In Providence occurred the same fact.</P>
<P>The whole secret of these phenomena, is, that infection has usually nothing to do with the <HI>origin</HI> of the disease, according to the decided opinion of the learned Diemerbroeck, who saw the progress of the disease in Holland, and found it impossible to as∣cribe it, in many places, to that cause.</P>
<P>The reason why persons are seized, in remote and scattered situations and after different intervals of time, is, that the malig∣nant principle is <HI>progressive.</HI> In its state of increase, it first pro∣duces
<PB N="172" REF="036687_0527_100AA4D84BAB4E00"/>
diseases of a less violent type, and especially all kinds of eruptive diseases and catarrhous affections; as influenza, measles, small-pox, every species of angina, petechial fever, and lastly plague. In winter, the same cause often occasions epidemic pleu∣risy, or peripneumony of a most mortal kind, and always bear∣ing some likeness to the epidemics of summer and autumn.</P>
<P>In this progression or increase of the pestilential principle, those persons are first seized, who have the least power of resisting its operation. This inability may proceed from various causes. It may be occasioned by the natural organization of the body; some bodies being naturally more susceptible of disease, than others. This indisposition of bodies to repel the morbid action of air or other causes, is hidden from the eyes of man; but that it exists, we have proofs in every days experience.</P>
<P>Other persons are predisposed to certain diseases by artificial means. Thus every excessive stimulus, induces indirect debility, a fruitful cause of diseases. Hence the liability of robust people to all violent fevers.</P>
<P>Others may be exposed to pestilential diseases from living in situations, where the pestilential principle is assisted in its opera∣tion by the debilitating qualities of morbid exhalations. Hence the early appearance and furious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avages of the plague in the nar∣row streets of cities, and the filthy apartments of poverty.</P>
<P>From these and other causes, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> happens that some persons are seized with pestilence, long before the bodies of others yield to the action of the destructive cause. This will rationally account for all the variety of phenomena, which accompany this ferocious malady.</P>
<P>The same reasoning applies to the angina maligna, which is on∣ly another form of pestilence. Fothergill relates, that this dis∣ease appeared in London in a few cases in 1739, and then disap∣peared for a period of two or three years. It did not become epidemic, tho very infectious.</P>
<BIBL>Works, p. 198.</BIBL>
<P>To confirm this hypothesis, I may remark that the plague is less infectious on its first appearance. This is admitted by Rus∣sel, on the plague of Aleppo, p. 19. 300, 297 and 315. At the same time, it is agreed on all hands, to be more mortal, than
<PB N="173" REF="036687_0528_100AA4DAEC487CA0"/>
in its later stages. If infection were the cause, the reverse would be true, and the disease would be more mortal, in proportion to its extension, and the accumulation of infectious matter. The first cases also would be equally infectious, within the reach of their effluvia.</P>
<P>Skenkius observes that many persons lived in infected houses, where others were diseased, for three or four weeks, without any ill effects; but they afterwards sickened and died. This he ascribes to an increase of infection, and recommends, as the means of prevention, changes of clothes, and liberal use of wa∣ter in the apartments. The fact may be explained on this prin∣ciple; or it may be, and most probably is, the effect of the slow operation of the morbid air in inducing debility on particular sys∣tems. But it goes to prove that the infection of the disease is not specific contagion, but a vapor or acid, unfriendly to health, that is capable of every imaginable degree of force; slighter de∣grees of which require a long time to undermine the energies of life.</P>
<P>Another consideration, which decides against the origination of the plague from infection, is, that almost all other diseases, whether infectious or not, exhibit the phenomena just described. It is not the plague alone that appears, this year in one town, and the next in a contiguous one; or this week in one family, and the next in another; or at the same moment, in two fami∣lies or towns, at some miles distance. The same phenomena characterize dysentery, measles, anginas and other maladies which are infectious; and even intermittents, remittents, and some others, which are not spread by infection.</P>
<P>Such was the manner in which the fatal dysentery of the pe∣riod about the year 1751, leaping from place to place, in differ∣ent years, ravaged Connecticut, for three or four years. The same took place, with that disease, from 1773 to 1777. It was scattering from place to place, during a series of years, and then almost totally disappeared, for many years. Sometimes it spread over a whole town; at others, it was limited to a particular street. In some instances, it swept away a large part of a fam∣ily; in other instances, families entirely escaped. The same has been its progress, during the last five or six years. In 1794,
<PB N="174" REF="036687_0529_100AA4DF4ED4E3E8"/>
it ravaged Derby; in 1795, New-Haven. In 1798, it invaded a particular street in the country, two miles from Stamford, was infectious and mortal, while the town generally escaped.</P>
<P>The scarlatina from 1793 to 1796, exhibited the same facts. Its general progress was eastward, but it often passed by a town and first seized one beyond it.</P>
<P>The angina maligna in 1735 and 6 was remarked for the same manner of appearance. It began in Kingston, in New-Hamp∣shire, but instead of a regular progress, step by step, it seized Boston, fifty miles distant, before it did Chester, only six miles distant; yet its general progress was westward, and hardly any place escaped. Both this disease and the scarlatina of the last period, resembled the plague in these other respects—they were most mortal at first; and they affected families with very differ∣ent degrees of violence, slightly troubling some, and extinguish∣ing the lives of all the children in others.</P>
<P>The invasion of the influenza exhibits similar facts. It seizes at first only here and there a person; afterwards it becomes gen∣eral, as at Edinburgh in 1762. See Essays and Obs. Edin. vol. 3. At other times, it has seized whole towns in a night; nor does it proceed from town to town, according to their order on a map. Yet its <HI>general</HI> course is in one direction.</P>
<P>I could produce a multitude of similar instances of pleurisy, and common autumnal fevers not infectious, which appear one year, in one part of the country, and another, in another, with∣out any visible cause for this variety. The instances related by Dr. Buel of the town of Sheffield, are very distinguished. See my Collection on the Yellow Fever, p. 53 and 60. That town contains two large ponds, which make considerable marshes, that are sources of remittents. In 1794, remittents of unusual vio∣lence appeared within the miasmata arising from the south pond —in 1795, a similar fever raged in the vicinity of the north pond.</P>
<P>This appeared at first an unaccountable phenomenon; but af∣terwards the fever about the south pond in 1794 was ascribed to the drawing off the water, and exposing great quantities of pu∣trescible substances to the action of heat. But still the difficulty is not removed. The north pond is admitted to be the most
<PB N="175" REF="036687_0530_100AA4DD29A5BA58"/>
usual and fruitful source of diseases; but these did not appear, in any extent, in 1794. The question then is, not why the diseases occurred, in that year, about the south pond, but why they did <HI>not</HI> appear about the north pond, the principal focus of sickness in other years, and about which they raged with mel∣ancholy effects in the two following years? No alteration is sug∣gested to have been made in the circumstances of the north pond; yet in one year, its exhalations were almost harmless, and in the next, they spread desolation over the neighborhood.</P>
<BIBL>See Medical Repository, vol. 1. p. 458.</BIBL>
<P>In such cases, just reasoning leads us to suppose the general state of the air or the local exhalations or both, differ materially in the degrees of their force and activity, in different years; but to human eyes, the cause of this difference is not often visible.</P>
<P>Sometimes a severe epidemic will rage in one town and a milder epidemic of a similar type in the vicinity. Thus Zimmerman observes, that he has known a violent diarrhea follow a suppres∣sed perspiration in September, in one town, when a dysentery was epidemic in the neighboring country. To what shall we im∣pute this difference of diseases, within a few miles, of each other, but to the different force of local causes? A general cause, as a hot season, may predispose the body to a disease of a particular type, but this principle may be modified by innumera∣ble circumstances on the surface of the earth.</P>
<P>In analogy with these facts, is the manner in which pestilen∣tial diseases invade different species of animals. In one place, horses are seized; in another, cows; in a third, sheep. In one year cats fall victims to pestilence; and the next, hens and geese; but infection has no concern in these phenomena; and we are to ascribe them to the various force of the pestilential principle in different seasons and places.</P>
<P>The phenomenon now under consideration has not escaped the observation of other physicians in Europe. Stapfer, cited by Zimmerman on Physic, relates that the village of Oberwyl, in the Canton of Berne, was attacked with a violent dysentery in 1749, while the neighboring villages were free from the dis∣ease. In the next year, Oberwyl was healthy, while the neigh∣boring
<PB N="176" REF="036687_0531_100AA4E0F31550F8"/>
villages were ravaged with the same disorder, tho not se∣parated from the other by any mountain or forest. I have occa∣sion, says Zimmerman, to observe something like this, almost every year.</P>
<P>The English Editor remarks on these facts, that "the dys∣entery, like other contagious diseases, is spread by communica∣tion with the infected persons and clothes, and <HI>therefore</HI> it is not strange that one village should escape, if its inhabitants were care∣ful to avoid communication with their infected neighbors."</P>
<P>Just so important are all the reasonings of the infection-stick∣lers! The remarks are common-place and do not reach the point of difficulty. The question, is, to know why several villages escaped the disease, in the year when infection was <HI>near</HI> them, and were seized, the next year, when <HI>no</HI> infection existed. The winter's cold totally extinguishes the infection of that disease; so that the learned Editor is left without a resource. If any in∣fection had survived the frost of winter, it must have been in the village first infected, and in that place common sense and observation would teach us to look for a revival of the disease, the succeed∣ing spring. But no; that village is in perfect health, and others, where there had been no fomites, are laid waste by its ravages.— Such are the facts, and no theory of contagion is able to explain the cause of their existence, in regard to this or any other disease.</P>
<P>The dysentery also has, in some places, made the discrimina∣tion, observed in the plague; seizing persons of a certain nation or blood, and not affecting others who are equally exposed. In an epidemic dysentery in Nimeguen, the French and Jews all escaped.</P>
<BIBL>Van Swieten, vol. 16. page 57.</BIBL>
<P>There is a fact related by Hodges and Diemerbroeck respec∣ting the plague which must not be omitted. Many persons who had breathed the pestilential air of London and Nimeguen, went into the country, where they had the benefit of good air. Here they lived in health a month or two, then sickened and died of the plague. This is attributed to the latent poison, which lies long inactive in the system, then operates to the destruction of life. This may be the cause; but is it not more natural to ascribe the fact to higher excitement from a pure air, on a debilitated
<PB N="177" REF="036687_0532_100AA4E3A65BFDF8"/>
system, inducing indirect debility? Or shall we suppose that a pestilential atmosphere is most stimulant, and that a removal in∣to a pure air, induces direct debility? Perhaps the following facts will throw some light on the subject.</P>
<P>In 1789, I left Hartford in October, when the influenza was spreading in that town, and was seized with the disease just after I arrived at Boston. A fortnight after, I returned, with two ladies who had lived in Boston. In a week after my arriving at Hartford, the town of Boston was attacked with the influenza, and the two ladies at Hartford were seized at the same time. The conclusion I draw from the fact, is, that the constitution of air, producing the epidemic, is some time in operation, be∣fore its effects are visible, gradually inducing a disposition in the system to that disease; and as it is progressive, it requires about the same time to run through its course in one place as in another, and is not always interrupted by local causes.</P>
<P>But the most incontrovertible evidence, that infection is not the primary, controlling cause of the plague, arises from the man∣ner in which that epidemic ceases.</P>
<P>If infection were the principal and specific cause of its propa∣gation, it must rage forever, or as long as any of the human race should survive to receive it; for the longer the disease exists, the more extensive must it be. This conclusion is inevitable; for if infection spreads the disease so rapidly, that one or two diseased persons diffuse it in a few weeks over a city, the same principle must, in a given time, extend it over the whole earth, unless its operation should be arrested by a superior cause. And as one diseased person is supposed to infect more than one healthy per∣son, its progress must be accelerated, in a duplicate, triplicate and quadruplicate ratio to its distance from its source. Its ve∣locity also must be increased, not only by numbers in a crouded city, but by an augmented virulence, until all the inhabitants should be destroyed. But all this is contrary to fact.</P>
<P>Most plagues are modified and regulated by the seasons; but the cessation of pestilence in different countries, is in different seasons, and seems to depend on opposite principles. In Egypt, a warm country, never reached by what may be called <HI>cold,</HI> the
<PB N="178" REF="036687_0533_100AA4E5DB82F800"/>
plague begins in winter, as in December, January or February; after the Nile has subsided within its banks, leaving extensive plains and numerous canals, exposed to a hot sun; with a slimy surface and stagnant water in abundance, on the face of the country. During this period also blow the southerly and suffo∣cating winds, hot and dusty, from sandy desarts, which may augment the causes of disease.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the disease ceases in June, when the Nile overflows its banks, spreading fresh water over the face of the country; at which time also begin to blow the cool refreshing elysian breezes from the north or Mediterranean sea.</P>
<P>Hence it is obvious that the existence of the disease depends on the general state of the atmosphere; for the inundation of the Nile certainly does not wash away the infection from the houses and clothes of the sick. On the other hand, the plague ceases, when the infection is most general, and this is true in every instance.</P>
<P>It may be said, that the plague arises from putrid exhalations in Egypt, and the reason why it ceases, on the rising of the Nile, is, that the expansion of fresh water over the country and a pure northerly air, destroy these exhalations.</P>
<P>In this observation there is truth; and it would account for the origin and the cessation of the plague, if it was an annual disease, regularly influenced and entirely governed by the sea∣sons. But here again we are overthrown; for in most years, putrid exhalations, which always exist at a certain season, do <HI>not</HI> produce the disease. Thus we are driven to seek another cause, which is <HI>not</HI> influenced by seasons; and to suppose its <HI>co-operation</HI> with hot winds and stagnant waters in the generation of the disease. This is most indubitably the fact.</P>
<P>Again, the plague in Syria, farther north, where some win∣ter's cold is experienced, begins in spring, as in February or March, and ends in June and July, during the most excessive heat of the summer. This is the fact, from Aleppo to Jerusa∣lem, and has been, from the earliest records extant.</P>
<P>Here then different causes, extreme heat and drouth, seem to control the rage of the plague. But does heat destroy infection? Never, unless by combustion. No degree of heat that is ever
<PB N="179" REF="036687_0534_100AA4E7709F9608"/>
felt in the tropical regions, or in America, has ever mitigated the force of infection, but always has increased it. Now we know, that the heat of Syria, never exceeds in degree what is annually experienced in the West-Indies and the United States, to the 42d degree of latitude certainly, and probably to the 44th. In one respect Syria differs from this country; the summers are longer than in the northern states of America, and the climate subject to drouth. But it cannot be the duration of the heat which destroys the plague; for that disease ceases at the very be∣ginning of summer. It abates in June, and rarely appears, to any extent, as late as August. Nor can we concieve why drouth in Syria should put an end to the epidemic for in most <HI>other</HI> countries, it has not that effect. In Europe and America, ex∣treme drouth has very often inflamed its violence.</P>
<P>In this instance then we find no cause for the cessation of the plague, in the weather or seasons, which we are able to compre∣hend. We know the uniformity of the fact; and all beyond this, is conjecture. Infection can have no concern in the effect; unless on some principle hitherto unknown, cool weather generates it and heat destroys it, contrary to facts in all other countries.</P>
<P>Certain it is, that the plague at Aleppo, Damascus, Said, Je∣rusalem, Latakia, and on all the Syrian coast, ceases in ex∣treme hot weather, and when the infection is in its utmost extent and violence.</P>
<P>In Italy, Constantinople, in all Europe and the temperate lat∣itudes of America, ordinary plagues yield to cold; that is, they cease as epidemics of that form; but the general cause never fails to show its influence, in giving to the disorders of winter, some of the general symptoms which characterize the epidemic of the summer. This proves that, in common pestilence, morbid ex∣halations <HI>aid</HI> the atmospheric cause in producing the epidemic; and that it is not specific contagion which contributes to spread the disease, for this is not influenced by cold; but it is morbid exhalations, that yield to cold. Hence, in northern climates, cold suspends the action of the two subordinate causes of pestilence, morbid exhalations and infection; and this is usually sufficient to check the epidemic.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="036687_0535_100AA4E9EA81F540"/>But that the great primary cause, is not affected or rather sub∣dued by cold, is apparent from these facts; that altho the plague, in its peculiar autumnal form, is suspended, yet the diseases of winter, as pleurisy and peripneumony, wear the same character; which can be occasioned only by the continued action of the same cause. Further, some plagues have not yielded to cold, as I have before observed. Several instances have occurred, in which the disease has run through all the seasons without interruption or abatement. This fact demonstrates that the primary cause, ex∣isting in the essential properties of the elements, may be of vari∣ous degrees of force, and at times does actually arise to a degree, capable of producing and continuing that disorder, not only with∣out the aid of morbid exhalations and infection, but in defiance of cold.</P>
<P>In conformity with this idea, is the fact that a pestilence which begins the earliest in the season, is the most mortal. This is a∣greed by P. Alpinus, Van Swieten and Sydenham, "Minus saeva est, quo tardius illuc accessit, viderique incepit; ita ut quo tardius venerit, eó mitior ac brevior sit judicanda," says Alpi∣nus, Rerum Egypt, Vol. 3. 70. The reason of which is, that in proportion to the strength of the elemental cause, it begins to exhibit its effects early in the season; that is, with the <HI>least aid</HI> from heat, noxious effluvia or other local causes.—If the general contagion of the atmosphere is very powerful, its effects may ap∣pear even in winter, in opposition to cold; hence the justness of Diemerbroeck's remark, that pestilence beginning in winter, is the most fatal. If, on the contrary, the general constitution of the air is less hostile to life and health, it will not produce an epi∣demic pestilence, till it is assisted by great heat and local vitiation of the air; therefore the disease will not appear, till late in the season.</P>
<P>Something like this, on a small scale, has characterized the different epidemics in Philadelphia. In 1793, the precursors of the epidemic were light, and the first cases did not appear, till the last of July or beginning of August. In 1797 and 98, the first cases occurred in June, and the disease in the latter years, was marked with by far the most malignant symptoms, altho the
<PB N="181" REF="036687_0536_100AA4EC5710F7E0"/>
timely evacuation of the city prevented bills of mortality equal to that of 1793.</P>
<P>In New-York, this circumstance, it is believed, has been less noticeable; but it may be remarked, that in the years of the epi∣demic, the first cases occurred in the last week in July, and in years, when a few sporadic cases<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The advocates of the specific contagion of the plague do not ad∣mit that the true plague ever appears in sporadic cases. They think, if it once appears, its contagion must of necessity, spread it. This is all a whim. I believe, with Dr. Mitchell, that any disease of the worst type, may be generated in the body, solely by a derangement of the functions of the stomach and intestines, and the poisonous air extricated from food. But that sporadic cases of plague may occur and do occur very often, I have not the least doubt. During the late war, in 1776 or 1777, two brothers by the name of — arrived from the army at Greenwich in Connecticut—one had a malignant fever, with glandular tumors; the other was his nurse and in good health. The sick man di∣ed soon after he arrived, and in less than 24 hours, his brother was also in his grave. This was true plague; but no other attendant was in∣fected.—</NOTE> only have appeared, they have not occurred till many weeks later. Besides, it is very obvious that the diseases of 1795 and 6, if not of 1797, were powerfully influenced, in their commencement, by local causes; as great masses of putrid matter, in the parts of the city, where the first cases occurred, and where the epidemic exhausted its principal force.—</P>
<P>In general, it may be observed in our climate, that if a malig∣nant fever does not appear, in a city, till late in August, the cit∣izens need not apprehend very general desolation. If cases occur early, as in June, there is serious ground for apprehensions of danger. The only exception to these remarks, is, when the sea∣sons suffer some great, unusual and sudden vicissitudes, which, du∣ring a pestilential period, may overwhelm a city with almost in∣stantaneous calamity.—Such may be a sudden invasion of heat in August, after preceding cool weather.</P>
<P>In general it is a just remark, that as the force of the pestilential principle, is of various degrees, in different periods, so when it is most powerful, it attacks men the earliest in the proper season, and is destined to be the most destructive.</P>
<P>The preceding facts and conclusions seem sufficient to establish the great point, that neither contagion nor infection has ever had much influence in originating or propagating <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estilential epidemic diseases of the autumnal kind.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="036687_0537_100AA4EF62D0E720"/>But objections remain to be answered. It is alleged that the plague begins in maratime places and thence spreads into the coun∣try adjacent. Thus it is asserted by the college of physicians in Philadelphia, that the pestilential fever in America "commen∣ces invariably in our sea-ports, while inland towns, equally expo∣sed to the ordinary causes of fever, escape." Memorial, dated Dec. 5, 1797.</P>
<P>Pliny, a great observer of facts in the natural world, goes far∣ther and asserts, "That pestilence is observed always to proceed from southern regions towards the sitting sun; nor does it scarce∣ly ever happen otherwise, except in winter."</P>
<BIBL>Lib. 7. Cap. 50.</BIBL>
<P>Mead and the author of Traité de la peste have cited this opin∣ion with approbation. By the words of Pliny "a meridionis partibus, ad occasum solis," must mean from Egypt and the Bar∣bary coast, towards Italy, Gaul and the other western parts of Europe.</P>
<P>From these facts, is inferred a strong argument in favor of the propagation of that disease by contagion.</P>
<P>With deference to these great authorities, not one of these as∣sertions is accurate. That the plague generally appears first in sea-ports, is a just remark, and according to the laws of nature, it must be so, without infection. But to this rule there are many exceptions. The general plague in the days of Thucydides origina∣ted in Ethiopia, near the borders of upper Egypt, <HI>not a sea-port.</HI></P>
<P>The violent plague in 252 began in the same region; as did that of 1736.</P>
<P>The plague of 542 began in Lower Egypt, between Pelusium and a morass, called the Serbonian bog, at a distance from the port of Pelusium. It should have been mentioned that the mor∣tal plague in the reign of the Antonines began in Seleucia, on the Tigris, far from the sea. The black pestilence of 1348 origin∣ated in China. That of 1450 in some parts of Asia. The pesti∣lence of 1348 began, when it first appeared in France, in A∣vignon, <HI>not</HI> a sea-port; as did that of 1482. The plague of 1575 in Italy, began at the northward, in Trent, and proceeded southward, contrary to the assertion of Pliny; and every one
<PB N="183" REF="036687_0538_100AA4F10645D5C0"/>
sknow Trent is not a maritime place. The plague in Holland in 1663, began in Heusden, <HI>not</HI> a sea-port, but on a river and near a morass. In 1702, a plague broke out in Poland, far from the sea.</P>
<P>With respect to the United States, the assertion of the College of Physicians must stand or fall, according to the definition of the fevers which have appeared in the country. If no pestilence has ever appeared, except in sea-ports, we must affix some other name to the mortal epidemics that visit the interior of our coun∣try. Certain it is, contrary to the statement of the College of Physicians, that the true yellow fever, and so called at the time, prevailed in Albany in 1746.</P>
<P>About the marshes in the interior of our country, an epidemic bilious fever has times without number, raged as fatally, as ever it did in Philadelphia, destroying life in three or four days, at∣tended with all the characteristic symptoms of yellow fever and carrying off almost every person, within the region of its atmos∣phere. This has happened, about some of the lakes in the state of New-York, every year since the present pestilential period com∣menced, and whole villages have been depopulated. If the Col∣lege of Physicians choose not to call this disease yellow fever, I cannot help it; but sure I am, if it is not that specific disorder, it is one equally desolating, and as little entitled to be fathered on the country, as any species of plague whatever. It is a fact also that the bodies of those who perish by that fever near rivers and lakes, are, if possible, more yellow than in cities.</P>
<P>But what utterly disproves the assertion of the College of Phy∣sicians, is, that the same pestilential distemper which has lately afflicted our cities, appeared among the aborigines of this coun∣try, before it was settled by the English, before the West-Indies were settled by the English or French, and before a single vessel from the islands had ever reached our shores. To confirm this fact, it is well known that the same disease has often visited them, since the English settlements, and in situations and under circum∣stances, when it was not possible for them to receive it from infec∣tion, as at Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard in 1763, and seve∣ral times, in the limits of the present state of Rhode-Island.
<PB N="184" REF="036687_0539_100AA4F4839C4930"/>
The Onandagoes in the state of New-York, three or four hun∣dred miles from a sea-port, about eighty years ago, were attacked with pestilence, which wasted the tribe; and the place where their village was then built, has, on the account of that mortality, been ever since abandoned, and is now overgrown with trees. The same happened among the Senecas at a later period.</P>
<P>What the disease among the Onondagoes was, I am not inform∣ed; it might have been the small-pox; but the country where it happened, is now subject to mortal bilious epidemics, which kill in three days, and turn the body as yellow as saffron. Besides the great plague of 1618 is known to have been the true infectious yellow fever, and so was the fever of Nantucket in 1763, nei∣ther of which could possibly have been imported.</P>
<P>About sixty years ago, a great mortality happened among the Indians, on the north east of a small stream, a little south of East-Greenwich, in the state of Rhode-Island. The disease was fatal to almost all who were affected; but it was local, and in∣fectious, for a law was passed that no person should go from one side of the river to the other, and the Indians on the opposite side remained in health. This place was no sea-port, but an In∣dian hamlet; and no pretence of importation is suggested, nor does it appear, that any whites were affected.</P>
<P>About twenty-six years ago, a malignant bilious fever attack∣ed the Indians, at Quidnesit neck, in North-Kingston, in the same state, and most who were seized, perished. It attacked also a few families of whites, but with less mortality. North-Kingston is a sea-port, but there is no suggestion of foreign origin.</P>

<P>It is proper that I should here take notice of an assertion, found in a number of authors. "That Thucydides relates the plague, in his days, to have spread from Ethiopia by means of contagion, infection or fomites." The learned Diemerbroeck has fallen into this mistake. p. 48.</P>
<P>Galen is more correct, when he says, that pestilence spread by the corruption or infection of the air. This idea, tho not
<PB N="185" REF="036687_0540_100AA4F70FBAA450"/>
the expession, is accurate. The truth is, Thucydides does not say, the distemper spread by infection or contagion. A literal translation from the Greek is as follows. "It began as it is re∣ported, first from Ethiopia, above Egypt; then it fell on Egypt and Lybia, and a great part of the King's dominions (Persia.) It then suddenly invaded the city of Athens and first the Pieraeus." In the paragraph preceding he says, the disease had prevailed in many regions first and especially at Lemnos; but does not hint at infection or contagion as the cause.</P>
<P>The observation of Pliny, that pestilence originates in south∣ern climates and proceeds northward and westward, is generally, but not always true. Alexander Russel tells us, the pestilence in Aleppo in 1719 came from the northward; and many au∣thors relate that it appears in Constantinople or Smyrna, before it does in Egypt. This may be partly owing to alterations in the Turkish cities, since Pliny's time.</P>
<P>But on just principles, the fact is rationally explained. If a particular state of air, favorable to the propagation of that dis∣temper, must exist, before it can become epidemic, which is ad∣mitted by the friends and foes of contagion, then supposing this <HI>general</HI> pestilential principle to exist, at a given time, in equal force, all over the earth, or any portion of it; it must follow inevitably, that this general cause will produce the worst diseases <HI>first</HI> in climates and situations, where the most powerful <HI>local</HI> causes exist, as heat, moisture, and all kinds of deleterious exhalations. And for a most obvious reason; the debility of the human body must be first induced in those situations.</P>
<P>This is a complete solution of the fact mentioned by Pliny; and he himself justifies this explanation of it, for he excepts from his own general rule, the pestilence that appears in winter, a circumstance passed over by Mead. Now the reason why a plague beginning in winter does not follow the course of one be∣ginning in summer, but appears sometimes in northern climates <HI>first,</HI> is, that such a pestilence does not require the aid of con∣tingent causes, as noxious exhalations. It is independent of <HI>lo∣cal causes,</HI> and induced solely by the essential qualities of the at∣mosphere; it may therefore appear first in any place or climate
<PB N="186" REF="036687_0541_100AA4F8960C7478"/>
whatever, according to that state of air. This happens only in great plagues which seldom occur.</P>
<P>These observations apply also to the objection that pestilence first appears in maritime places, as mentioned by Procopius, and others.</P>
<P>It is a fact known to every medical man that humidity is a cause of debility. Hear what the learned Zimmerman says on this point.</P>
<BIBL>On Physic, vol. 2. p. 100.</BIBL>
<P>"The humidity of air weakens a man suddenly; it relaxes the solids, and of course weakens the circulation, so that the se∣cretions are carried on with difficulty. The insensible perspira∣tion is checked, the moisture passes in through the absorbing pores of the skin, and the patient feels a lassitude and heaviness, which deprive him of all his gaiety, and render the mind as oppressed as the body"—"Damp situations are, in every country, un∣healthy."</P>
<BIBL>p. 102.</BIBL>
<P>There is not a person living who cannot testify to the truth of these remarks. Hence the languor which depresses man, in a hot sultry day, with a southerly light air, <HI>loaded with vapor.</HI> Hence this state of the air, when of long continuance, never fails to generate epidemic disorders; and if it occurs, during a pestilential constitution, mankind seldom escape the ravages of the plague.</P>
<P>It may be said that the inhabitants of maritime towns, are less exposed to this source of debility, than seamen, who are in general remarkably healthy. To which I answer, that the or∣dinary moisture from sea air never of itself produces diseases; and at sea, there exists no exciting cause, as morbid exhalations, unless in ships of war and crouded transports, in which diseases often proc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed from human effluvia. But I question whether the bodies of seamen possess the same firm texture as those of laboring far∣mers in the country. Certain it is, that seamen are in general not so long-lived men, as farmers. This is ascribed to their ir∣regular and severe fatigue; but I suspect it more owing to the in∣cessant operation of the debilitating powers of moisture.</P>
<P>Whatev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r may be in this, it is certain that moisture of <HI>itself</HI> in∣duces
<PB N="187" REF="036687_0542_100AA4FA5D25DA60"/>
debility, in a greater or less degree, tho not disease; but when its action on the system is combined with the operation of morbid exhalations, which abound in cities, especially near navi∣gable water, together with the frequent alternations of heat and cold, occasioned by the contiguity of land and water; we are not to be surprised that cities on the borders of the ocean, and the banks of rivers, are the first to be attacked with pestilence. We might, without the aid of facts, prove a priori, that this must generally be the case.</P>
<P>Hodges mentions that the London plague of 1665 spread into the adjacent country, <HI>especially along the Thames;</HI> but he takes care to ascribe this to infected goods, and not to humidity—a∣nother proof of the mischiefs of theory.</P>
<P>Indeed the circumstance that next to large maritime cities, the towns situated on the borders of rivers or lakes, are the most se∣verely harrassed with epidemics of a fatal kind, especially autum∣nal diseases, is an evidence of the truth of the same principle. Wherever we turn our eyes, we see autumnal diseases, from sim∣ple tertians to the plague, most frequent and most deadly, in low situations, under the combined operation of heat, moisture and different species of noxious exhalations. It is therefore as un∣philosophical to deduce, from this fact, arguments in favor of the foreign origin of the plague, as in favor of the importation of many other malignant diseases; for the same phenomena attend them all—they all appear <HI>first,</HI> and are most epidemic and fatal, in the vicinity of water. This is their general rule, to which exist some exceptions, as well in regard to the plague, as to other bilious complaints.</P>
<P>But the discovery of a general pestilential principle, extend∣ing over a whole hemisphere, or the whole globe nearly at the same time, or with a rapid progression, solves all the difficulties on this subject. Had Pliny known, that at the moment a severe plague appears in Egypt, the diseases of all Europe, or all the world, assume unusual malignancy, or other contagious and in∣fectious epidemics appear, in every quarter, to the distance of a thousand leagues, his remark would have been equally just, as to the origin and progress of the plague, but it would have opened to him new causes of its origin, and a more just and philosoph∣ical
<PB N="188" REF="036687_0543_100AA4FC9A9D6E48"/>
view of the phenomenon. This is a discovery which pros∣trates all theories of specific <HI>contagion,</HI> and reduces the influence of <HI>infection</HI> to its just measure.</P>
<P>Another fact. Forestus has declared that in pestilence, three times the number died in wet weather, as in fair and dry weath∣er; the infection being less easily dispersed, in wet weather, which is evident from the smoke of chimnies.</P>
<BIBL>Van Swieten, vol. 16. 26.</BIBL>
<P>It is well known in America, that while the weather is hot, rains and moist air greatly multiply cases of pestilential fever.</P>
<P>In 1720 a storm of thunder and lightning at Marseilles, late in July, was followed by a great increase of the plague.</P>
<BIBL>Traité de la peste.</BIBL>
<P>Every one knows that the air, along the borders of the ocean, corrodes iron and other metallic substances. Is it not then ques∣tionable whether the saline acid, which impregnates the maritime air, has not some deleterious effect on the human body, when combined with other vapors from the earth? Are we yet ac∣quainted with the essential properties of all the possible combina∣tions of aerial substances?</P>
<P>Again; Mead has remarked, that countries and cities which have had most commerce with Africa, as Marseilles, have been most frequently afflicted with the plague. A French author, he says, reckons 20 plagues that have infested Marseilles, notwith∣standing its healthy situation.</P>
<P>In opposition to this, it may be proved by facts, that the cit∣ies, in the interior of Germany, that never had any trade or connection with Egypt, used formerly to be harrassed with that disease, nearly, if not quite as often as the maritime ports of Eng∣land, France, Spain or Italy. Any man will learn this, who reads the <HI>whole</HI> history of that calamity, instead of that of a few detached instances.</P>
<P>As to the twenty plagues of Marseilles, ascribed to the trade with Egypt, I would observe, that I can produce the history of near double that number of violent plagues in London, <HI>before</HI> that city had any trade or connection with Egypt.</P>
<P>Equally ill founded is the idea of medical writers that the yel∣low fever of the West-Indies was brought first from Siam. "Mal∣adie
<PB N="189" REF="036687_0544_100AA4FF35877DC0"/>
de Siam," is the name given to it by French physicians; and this improper name, will serve to perpetuate the error, while it shall exist as a monument of ignorance and false philosophy. This pretended Siam fever was the pestilence of the Indians, on this continent, before the West-India Islands were settled by the French or English.</P>
<P>Another extraordinary assertion of Mead, is, that "the north∣ern nations of Europe, before their connection with Africa in trade, grew populous more rapidly, than in modern times."</P>
<P>I will not contest the assertion, as it regards the degree of pop∣ulation of those countries, in different periods. Authors differ in opinion on the subject of the ancient population of Europe, and no certain documents or facts exist by which the point can be ascertained.</P>
<P>But the implication necessarily deduced from Mead's assertion, is, that the plague is more frequent and destructive in the north of Europe, since a trade has been opened with Egypt, than be∣fore; for on this principle only would he account for the redu∣ced population of modern times. If this is what he meant to insinuate, the assertion is not simply inaccurate, but absolutely false. From the first accounts we have of Russia, Poland and the Baltic regions, to the first opening of a trade with Egypt, in modern days, plagues were much <HI>more frequent</HI> and fatal in those countries than they have been, within the last century, since a con∣stant trade has been carried on with Egypt and every part of the Levant. For the truth of this assertion, I appeal to facts.— In the year 1485, the English first opened a trade to the Medi∣terranean, especially with Italy, and a consul was appointed, re∣sident at Pisa. The act of appointment by Richard 3d. con∣tains this passage "whereas certain merchants and others, from England, <HI>intend</HI> to frequent foreign parts, and chiefly Italy, with their ships and merchandize"—Before this, England had little or no trade, <HI>directly</HI> with foreign countries. All her trade was con∣ducted by Lombards, Genoese, Venetians and the Hansem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rch∣ants. There was no direct trade to Egypt and the Levant.</P>
<P>About the year 1511, English ships began to frequent Sicily, Candia, Chios and the Syrian coast; but this was accounted a
<PB N="190" REF="036687_0545_100AA50242F4AEF0"/>
very hazardous voyage, and ships seldom made it in less than a year.</P>
<P>In 1535 English factors first settled in those countries.</P>
<BIBL>See Anderson's Commerce, vol. 1. 683. vol. 2. 79. Rymer's Federa, vol. 12. 261, and Hackluite Voyages, vol. 2. 96.</BIBL>
<P>Now, the fact is, that the plague was as frequent and severe in England, Denmark, Sweden and Germany, in the tenth, eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth centuries, before any foreign trade existed, as in any later period. Not to mention the uni∣versal plague in the days of Vortigern, about 448, which never has been exceeded in extent and violence, unless by the black pestilence of 1348.</P>
<P>The Levant Company was first established by Queen Eliza∣beth in 1581, and the act of incorporation expressly states that "Sir Edward Osborn and his associates, the persons incorpora∣ted, had at their own great costs and charges, <HI>found out and opened</HI> a trade to Turkey." Before that time the commodities of Egypt, Syria and Turkey were all imported from Italy, so Venetian or Genoese ships.</P>
<P>The commerce of the North of Europe from the year 1200 to 1500, was almost wholly in the hands of the Hansea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ic Con∣federacy; but on careful investigation, I cannot find the least trace of a direct trade to the Levant, by the towns in that league. Indeed before the discovery of the mariner's compass, in the 14th century, all trade was carried on by coasting. His∣tory records more than one hundred general plagues before that discovery. So totally false is the assertion of Mead.</P>
<P>But say the College of Physicians, in the memorial before cited, "proper health laws, strictly enforced, have latterly pro∣tected the commercial parts of Europe from its ravages." This is a point of importance, and while the assertion stands unsup∣ported by proofs, I am at liberty to deny the truth of it, and there leave the question, as fair on one side as the other; for I cannot prove a negative. If however health laws have produ∣ced the effect alleged, it is very strange that the plague did not disappear at a much earlier period.</P>
<P>The institution of health laws was as early as 1484, and it appears they were first introduced at Venice. If these laws have
<PB N="191" REF="036687_0546_100A89D90C9D4750"/>
ever prevented an epidemic plague, it is very strange, that they were ineffectual in Venice and other parts of Italy, for near two hundred years, as they certainly were. It is indeed wonderful that, during the 16th century when all Europe was almost con∣tinually ravaged by that disease, and down to the close of the last century, no man could be found to devise a law, and no police, to enforce it, so as to arrest the progress of the plague in Italy. Yet such was the fact.</P>
<P>The first statute, I believe, in England to restrain the progress of infection, was in 1604, in the first session of James I. 31. The regulations attempted by the proclamation of Queen Eliza∣beth in 1580, before recited, prohibiting the enlargement of London, and the residence of more families than one in the same house, could not, from the tenor of them, be carried into effect. The statute of James limits its provisions to the con∣finement of the sick to their houses, a breach of which was made felony. An enforcement was attempted in the subsequent plagues, and especially in 1665, but without the least good effect, as to the city at large, and with a very ill effect upon the diseased and their families. It is certain however that a strict execution of such a law, would arrest the progress of <HI>infection,</HI> for the infection of the plague is found and admitted on all hands to be confined to contact or very near approach, so as to be received by the breath of the diseased. If therefore the disease were propagated by infection only, such confinement of the sick would check its progress, if not annihilate it. We know by repeated experience in America, that there is not the least difficulty in putting an end to a disease arising solely from specific contagion; and it has often been done in cases of the small-pox. Hence the inefficacy of the law of James I. after repeated trials in the plague, is a strong evidence that its propagation depends on some other cause than infection.</P>
<P>From 1604, to the reign of Queen Anne, no general laws were enacted on this subject, as far as I can discover from the printed statutes. In the 9th year of Queen Anne, 1709, pas∣sed the first statute enjoining vessels to perform quarantine; at least I can find none earlier. This was repeated by 26th.
<PB N="192" REF="036687_0547_100AA506A707A748"/>
George 2, 1752, a new statute on the subject, which was after∣wards amended by the 29th of the same reign. Now it so hap∣pens, that the plague ceased in London in 1666, forty-three years <HI>before</HI> a general quarantine was instituted. Particular laws had been passed before, on emergencies, as in 1664, when all importation of goods from Holland, was prohibited, on account of the plague, then in Holland; but without effect. The truth then, is, so far as regards Great-Britain, now the most commer∣cial country on earth, and at the time in question, the most com∣mercial, next to Holland, the plague entirely ceased and disap∣peared, 43 years before the existence of quarantine laws. If any mistake occurs in this statement, it must proceed from want of materials—my enquiries are limited to Blackstone and the printed statutes at large, the only documents I possess on that subject.</P>
<P>In the course of my reading, I have found but two or three instances, in which it has ever been <HI>supposed</HI> that health laws have preserved a city from pestilence. Mead mentions two instances; one at Ferrara in 1630, where every person, seized with the dis∣order, was immediately removed to a Lazaretto; which being done in seven or eight instances, the disease was checked and dis∣appeared.</P>
<P>Another instance he mentions was at Rome in 1657, where the persons first seized were removed to Lazarettos and their fam∣ilies to hospitals without the city, and the city was soon freed from the disorder. He supposes further that the disease was sus∣pended a whole fortnight in Marseilles, in 1720, by the same means.</P>
<P>I have no account before me of the origin and progress of the plague, in Italy, 1630 and 1657, except the sketches found in Mead's works, but wherever I can obtain a correct account of this disease, mentioned also by Mead, I find his statements are imperfect and erroneous; I therefore place very little dependence on them. That the plague in Marseilles was stopped a fortnight by regulations of policy, is not true. The disease appeared in the preceding autumn, and was suspended five or six months by the winter. When it appeared in the month of May 1720, wri∣ters
<PB N="193" REF="036687_0548_100AA508C18E1DF8"/>
say, the first cases were among those who had intercourse with the ship and goods from Said; but all those goods were prohibited to be carried into the city, and subjected to fifteen days retreat and purification. The porters who had concern with them were confined. Some weeks after, in the month of June, cases of the disease appeared in the city; all precautions had proved fruitless; as the hot weather came on, the disease started up here and there in the city, among persons who never had any concern with the ship or the goods, or the infected; it then subsided; then again appeared, in the manner before related.</P>
<P>Whether the persons seized in May contracted the disease from the goods or foul air of the ship, or not, is not material; for the goods were cleansed, and all the diseased confined to the hospital, and all the porters shut out from the city. Yet when the disease appeared in the city, no person could tell how it came there; many were seized who had never been near infection; and hence the populace resort to supposition to account for its or∣igin —they <HI>suppose</HI> the disease had come from the goods after they were cleansed, tho they had no evidence of it. Besides I have before remarked under the year 1720, that the goods could not be infected, for it is admitted on all hands that they were ship∣ped at Said, when the disease was <HI>not</HI> in that port. The ship's hold might have generated foul air on her passage, and the first persons connected with her might have contracted a pestilence from that air, which is not an uncommon thing, in such a very sickly period, as that was, when mortality was increased all over Europe and America. But the truth is, had that air been the cause of the plague in the city, the disease would not have been suspended for six weeks, but would have made a regular progress from one patient to another. But no; it disappears for six weeks, and then breaks out in parts of the city remote from the suppo∣sed source of infection, and among people who had not been near that source. So inaccurate and inconsistent appear all accounts of the contraction of epidemic diseases from fomites, which I have been able to investigate by full and authentic documents. This shows how little reliance we can place on partial state<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ents, made to support favorite systems. I therefore am persuaded that
<PB N="194" REF="036687_0549_100AA50A47E19FB8"/>
the cases mentioned by Mead of the effectual restraint of the plague in Italy by removing the sick, are not fully stated, and that an accurate enquiry would prove the supposed effect to result from other causes.</P>
<P>The following facts will furnish a more rational solution of the phenomenon.</P>
<P>In the United States, ever since the commencement of the present constitution of air, that is, from 1790, sporadic cases of our pestilential fever have occurred, not only in cities, but in va∣rious parts of the country, more or less, every summer and au∣tumn. In 1792 occurred a number in New-York; also in 1794 when one case exhibited infection; and in 1797. Of a∣bout thirty cases perhaps, in each year, some of them were ex∣cessively violent, highly marked, and in a degree, infectious. In 1791 and in 1796, several hundred cases appeared, yet the dis∣ease was not epidemic, but local, and the business of the city was not suspended. Now had every person, the moment of his seizure, been conveyed out of the city to a hospital, the escape of the city, in each of these years, would vulgarly have been ascribed to that circumstance. This was doubtless the case in Ferrara and Rome, and this is unquestionably the solution of the fact, that the cases in the Italian cities, were sporadic cases, which always occur in the neighborhood of the plague. This disease, in the years mentioned, raged in other parts of Italy; the cases men∣tioned by Mead were sporadic cases, indicating a pestilential con∣stitution of air, extending to those cities, but of a less malignancy, and too mild to produce a general pestilence in those places; it affected only a few persons of habits most susceptible of it; and to these it probably would have been limited, had none of them been removed.</P>
<P>A similar fact occurred in Philadelphia in 1794. Eighty or a hundred persons died that year of the true yellow fever; none of them were removed; but to these was limited the operation of the pestilential principles, local and general; and no epidemic ensued.</P>
<P>In New-London a case occurred in 1795; and in 1796 sev∣eral cases of the same disease; but no epidemic, altho no remo∣val of the sick took place.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="036687_0550_100AA50C8668A7D0"/>In Providence, sporadic cases have occurred almost every year, with symptoms of the infectious yellow fever. In 1791, in June, died two daughters of a widow, in the center of the town. They vomited bilious matter, and their bodies were yel∣low, with livid and purple spots. Other cases occurred the same year; one case in 1792, and a number in 1793, 4 and 5; cases which could not possibly have originated from foreign sour∣ces. Some of them appeared to be infectious, as that of the young women first mentioned, the first being taken on the 4th of June and dying on the 7th; the second being seized on the 9th, and dying on the twelfth. Yet no epidemic followed; and had these patients been removed to a distant hospital, the safety of the town would have been ascribed to that removal, and the salutary effect of health laws would, by Mead's followers, have been trumpeted over the country, and what is worse, would have been recorded as an important fact, which would hereafter mislead posterity.</P>
<P>Nothing is more dangerous than to build a theory, or to estab∣lish a general principle on a few detached facts, inaccurately stated, and ill-understood.</P>
<P>With regard to the case of Rome stated by Mead, it must be observed, that the disease had, in the preceding year, killed 10,000 of its inhabitants, and in the kingdom of Naples 400,000. The disease had probably finished its course in that region, and the few cases in Rome in 1657, were only detached instances, the remains of the pestilential cause; such as occurred in London in 1666, after the fatal plague of the preceding year. It is by no means probable that the disease, if neglected, would have become epidemic.</P>
<P>But we have stronger ground to oppose the idea of the Col∣lege of Physicians, relative to the effect of health laws. Nu∣merous examples are on record, in which the full force of the best regulations to prevent pestilence, has been applied in vain; and since the publication of the memorial of the College, from which this idea is taken, Philadelphia has witnessed the futility of such regulations, in two melancholy instances.</P>
<P>In 1636, the law to prevent infection was rigorously executed in Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> sick were confined, suspected families were se∣questered;
<PB N="196" REF="036687_0551_100AA5D6983C73D8"/>
but all to no purpose; the disease spread, the legal restrictions were then taken off, and no ill effect followed; the distemper spread no faster than before.</P>
<P>In 1665, the same regulations were tried in vain; and so was the law, prohibiting the importation of goods from Holland.</P>
<P>The approach of pestilence towards Dantzick in 1708, in which year it appeared at Thorn, alarmed the magistrates of the former city, and every possible precaution was used to prevent its reaching Dantzick. Commerce and communication with in∣fected and suspected places were forbidden; no sorts of merchan∣dize, especially those which are most apt to retain infection, were permitted to enter the city from such infected places; all strangers and travellers were strictly examined, and none suffer∣ed to enter the city, without sufficient proof of coming from healthy places; all the inhabitants were cautioned not to hold correspondence with infected places, nor to harbor those who came from them. These and other regulations were enjoined by an edict in July 1708. Yet all to no purpose; the plague appeared at Dantzick, the next spring.</P>
<BIBL>Baddam's Memoirs, vol. 6. p. 6.</BIBL>
<P>This is a remarkable instance of the futility of human regu∣lations, when opposed to the laws of the physical world. The people of Dantzick, had they been acquainted with the princi∣ples of pestilence, might have foreseen in 1708, the probability of the inefficacy of their regulations. The state of the air in the production of millions of spiders, and the increasing mortal∣ity in the city, indicated the existence of a state of the air, unfriendly to health, which was increasing and only required a little more virulence to generate the evil, which they ignorantly supposed must come in sick bodies, goods or old clothes; and which they were idly combatting on that mistaken principle.</P>
<P>It has already been stated that the rigorous execution of health laws at Marseilles in 1720, proved utterly fruitless.</P>
<P>The plague which desolated Naples in 1656 was said to be introduced into that city by soldiers from Sardinia, where it ra∣ged the preceding year. Yet the Viceroy, Count Castrillo had prohibited all intercourse with Sardinia. After the disease ap∣peared which was first in the form of a malignant fever, without
<PB N="197" REF="036687_0552_100A8A7E13E8A248"/>
glandular tumors, all possible means were used to prevent its spreading, but to no purpose.</P>
<P>The confidence in modern health laws, is like the respect which the ancient Egyptians paid to the bird, Ibis, which, they supposed, averted the plague by destroying the flying serpents that the hot Lybian winds brought into the country.</P>
<BIBL>Cicero de Nat. Deor. lib. 1. 36.</BIBL>
<P>The Egyptians were like all modern nations—unwilling to believe the plague generated at home—they ascribed it to infec∣tion brought by flying serpents, as the moderns ascribe it to old clothes, bales of goods and infected ships. They mistook the cause, adored Ibis, as the moderns do, quarantine, and with the same ill success.</P>
<P>But we need not step off of our own territories to find evi∣dence of the inefficacy of health laws, when opposed to the op∣eration of the laws of nature. No expedient has been left un∣tried to ward off the calamity of pestilence, but without any visible effect. The severity of the affliction in Philadelphia, in former years, had rendered the magistracy of the city extremely careful to guard against importation in 1798. The most rigid qua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>antine was exacted—ventilators of the best construction em∣ployed —the vessels were washed, fumigated, white-washed with lime, and every practicable mode of purification adopted. Not a vessel was suffered to approach the city, without satisfactory evidence of the healthy state of the people, and the salubrity of the vessel and cargo. See the letter from Hillary Baker, Esq. mayor of the city, to the mayor of Baltimore, dated August 13th, 1798. Alas! all to no purpose! The ravages of the disease are well known.</P>
<P>If, says the late worthy mayor, the disease has eluded the health officers, I shall despair of future success, unless the West-India commerce shall be prohibited in the summer months, and magazines established below for receiving the cargoes.</P>
<P>Similar provisions in other ports have been established with no better success. The health laws at New-York, so far as appears, were as well executed in 1795, 96 and 98, when the fever was epidemic, as in 1794 and 97 when it was <HI>not.</HI> No visible good effects are to be discovered in guarding against an epidemic; the
<PB N="198" REF="036687_0553_100A89EB44738AA8"/>
utility of cleansing vessels therefore is limited to guarding against the operation of infection, upon a few persons who may enter them, with foul air on board. Public health, so far as can be discovered, has never been secured by those regulations. What seems to place this point beyond question is, that for thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> years preceding 1792, no pestilential fever ever spread in America, from the ten thousand infected seamen and passengers, which ar∣rived in the country from the West-Indies, and during which time, in most places, not the least precaution was ever used to guard against it; yet since 1792, that is, under a state of air, generating various epidemics, the pestilential fever has appeared in sporadic cases, every year and in almost every town in Amer∣ica, and has raged as an epidemic in most of our large towns, in opposition to the utmost efforts of human skill. I am persuaded, the conclusions from these facts amount to demonstrative evidence, that infection is <HI>not</HI> the principal, or cause sine qua non, of this terrible calamity.</P>
<P>The application of quarantine laws to our epidemic pestilential fever, is just as useless, as the order of the Sultan, Achmet I. in the wasting plague of 1613, for transporting all the cats in Constantinople to the island of Scutari. The Jewish physicians told the Emperor, that the plague was occasioned by the cats, and the poor cats were dispatched into exile. Yet this did not restrain the plague.</P>
<P>People have been forever mistaking the cause of the plague. In the first centuries of the christian era, when disputes ran high between Christians and Pagans, these sects mutually charged the plague each to the other. In 1349, the Germans ascribed the plague to the Jews, and massacred great numbers of that race. In Paris, during a plague, many protestant <HI>heretics</HI> were sacrificed, for bringing the calamity upon that city. And a proposition has been made in America to stop all intercourse with the West-In∣dies and the Mediterranean, during the summer months! As∣tonishing blindness!</P>
<P>But, it will be asked, shall we have no health laws? I answer, by all means. Their utility is obvious on many occasions. Thus when an infected fleet arrives in a port, the town is in eminent
<PB N="199" REF="036687_0554_100A8A811D1FE6F0"/>
danger, of what may be called a jail fever on a great scale. The quantity and virulence of infection thus imported, have produced destructive consequences, as at Brest in 1757, where were lan∣ded in November and placed in hospitals, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>out five thousand dise<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed seamen and troops from ships, mostly out of De la Mot∣te's fleet, from Louisburg, with a malignant fever on board. The effect was that ten thousand men died, in the hospitals, the succeeding winter, and many of the inhabitants of Brest. But it will be remarked, that this infectious disease did not become an <HI>epidemic</HI> in Brest; it spread only by infection; and as soon as that was dissipated, the disease disappeared. It raged in winter and subsided in spring. This is an important distinction, always to be observed by those who guard the public health—an <HI>epidemic</HI> pes∣tilence begins when the season or the state of air favors it, and rages without control, against all human efforts; the common air becomes tainted, so as to produce the disease, without the infec∣ting principle from bodies or clothes, and the diseases subside on∣ly at the command of the seasons and the elements. Against such, no legal provisions are or can be of any avail, and such is usually the yellow fever of our country.</P>
<P>But diseases propagated only by infection, like the jail and ship fever, never put on the form of an epidemic. They rage in crouded prisons and ships, where they are generated; and when multitudes are crouded into hospitals, they carry the evil with them; and all persons, coming within reach of the infection, are liable to suffer. In this manner, Brest lost many of her in∣habitants; a town in America is said to have done the same, from the yellow fever, imported in Sir Francis Wheeler's fleet, as already related. But in such cases, the infecting disease re∣quires contact or near approach to aid its propagation; and does not assume the complexion of an epidemic. The two species of disease are as distinguishable as light from darkness.</P>
<P>Thus, at the Black assizes in Oxford, in 1577, a malignant or jail fever of a singular kind, was produced suddenly—almost all the court and spectators were seized—many died—but no epi∣demic followed in Oxford; and in this instance, the effect was so sudden, that the human body did not generate infection.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="036687_0555_100A8A82ACBE9318"/>So also at the Old Bailey, not many years past, a few prison∣ers, entering the court from a dirty jail, without changing their dress, infected a large number of persons who died; but no epi∣demic followed—the infection was soon dissipated, and there was an end of the disease.</P>
<P>With our pestilential fever, this is not the case, nor with any epidemic plague that ever existed. Remove the sick, cleanse the houses and clothes, do whatever human art and labor is compe∣tent to effect, all will not avail—cases spring up in every quarter, and the disease takes its course.</P>
<P>So it was in Candia in 1592, as related from Thuanus, un∣der that year. As soon as the plague appeared, all the sick and all the suspected were removed from the city; but to no purpose; it raged till July—then abated without any human means and re∣vived again in October.</P>
<P>Thus says the author of Traité de la peste, "Universal clean∣sings have proved useless; the plague has ravaged places after ev∣ery precaution; and after negligence it has entirely ceased, as in Naples."</P>
<P>Such are the facts; and hence the necessity of distinguishing carefully between <HI>epidemic</HI> pestilence, proceeding principally from general causes in the elements, and marked by other epidemic diseases, by the failure of vegetable productions and by the sick∣ness, or death of cattle, fish and other animals—and <HI>diseases merely infectious,</HI> generated by artificial means, which <HI>may</HI> be communicated, which may happen in jails, ships and camps, in the healthiest state of the elements, and which cease, as soon as the infection can be dissipated by purifications and fresh air. Without this distinction, the merit of legislative and police-regu∣lations, can never be duly appreciated. Such regulations, ap∣plied to <HI>epidemics,</HI> as they continually are, prove totally futile— applied to diseases of mere infection and of specific contagion, as jail fever and small pox, they may be and often are the means of preserving multitudes of lives.</P>
<P>It is important therefore that health laws should be judiciously framed and strictly executed, because there <HI>may</HI> be cases in which public health will be preserved by them; altho they never can
<PB N="201" REF="036687_0556_100AA5102D830040"/>
reach the cause or prevent the ravages of epidemics, which orig∣inate where they exist.</P>
<P>With respect to merchant-men, health-laws may also be of some use, in preserving the lives of seamen, and of persons con∣cerned in the vessels. Sick men may generate a small degree of infection; but on board of merchant-men, the number of sea∣men is too small to infect a ship, so as to endanger public health, unless shamefully neglected.</P>
<P>The most danger from merchant-men is from the foul air gene∣rated, on long voyages and in hot seasons, from perishable and fermenting substances. From such vitiated air, deprived of its vital principle, great danger may arise to the persons who first open and enter the holds; and perhaps to a neighborhood. It is of great consequence therefore to use ventilators freely on board of vessels, freighted with perishable articles; and to have them effectually cleansed, before they are suffered to approach our wharves.</P>
<P>But I am not convinced that the air of such vessels ever yet <HI>originated</HI> an epidemic fever. It appears to me, that the Acad∣emy of Medicine in Philadelphia, lay more stress on this cause, than it deserves. The sphere of the operation of such a small morbid cause, cannot be extensive; and all the foul air of the largest vessel must be so attenuated by diffusion, as not to pro∣duce deleterious effects, at any great distance. It may be inju∣rious to a small neighborhood; but I do not conceive it possible, that the noxious air of a few square yards, can impregnate the whole atmosphere of a city; and as to infection from the sick, I have repeatedly proved, that this can never produce an epi∣demic. I will admit the <HI>bare possibility,</HI> that imported infection may enkindle the flame of pestilence, in a place fitted for it by local causes, where no pestilence would appear without a spark from infection. This is as much as I can admit to be possible, and more than I believe; after a more minute and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>areful investi∣gation of facts probably, than was ever before made in America. Most of the cases I can find, where accurate accounts are pre∣served, of supposed importation or communication of autumnal diseases, fail utterly of proofs to support common opinion; and
<PB N="202" REF="036687_0557_100AA511B9CAA998"/>
many of them are incontrovertibly proved to have had their ori∣gin in the places where they have existed.</P>
<P>It is easy, I aver, to distinguish, in every case, the nature of pestilence; that is, whether it is an epidemic, proceeding from a state of the elements, or a disease generated solely by foul air, artificially collected. In a few weeks, if not a few days, a dis∣ease will show whether it proceeds from infection only or from a general elemental source; and when it appears to proceed from the elements, men may just as well attempt to save the cats, the wild animals or the fish in the ocean from the effects of that principle, as their own species, by laws enjoining quarantine and purification of ships. The same cause that destroys the cats or the fish in one case, destroys human life in the other; and that cause exists in the elements; it is at home; quarantine laws do not reach it.</P>
<P>An epidemic disease may be distinguished from a disease pro∣ceeding from infection or specific contagion, by the following cir∣cumstances.</P>
<P N="1">1st. An epidemic pestilence is preceded by influenza, affec∣tions of the throat, or acute and malignant fevers.</P>
<P N="2">2d. An epidemic predominates over other diseases; totally absorbing them or compelling them to assume its characteristic symptoms. This last circumstance is decisive of the character of the disease.</P>
<P>A disease propagated by contagion or infection only is not thus distinguished. It has no precursors, it extends and spreads only by contact or near approach; and has no effect on the diseases in its vicinity. The small pox or jail fever, depending on mere in∣fection, never expel a dysentery or intermitting fever.</P>
<P>In every possible case, a plague that banishes other diseases, as I believe it always does, is an epidemic generated in the place where it exists; for it is not possible that this expulsion of other diseases, could take place, unless the epidemic depended solely on the elements. Simple infection would not change the symp∣toms of another disease, even in the next house, much less in all parts of a city.</P>
<P>To show how little an epidemic depends on infection, let us advert to facts. In all the eastern countries, the plague is suffer∣ed
<PB N="203" REF="036687_0558_100AA513F6DE0540"/>
to take its own course without restraint. There are no regu∣lations to control its progress, or prevent its return. Its begin∣ning is usually gradual; a few die the first year; the proper sea∣son suspends its progress; the next year it is more general, and often, the third year is the most fatal.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that after its most extensive effects, it abates and suddenly disappears. In London, the malignant precursors of the plague of 1665, appeared as early as 1661; but no soon∣er had its crisis passed, than in a few months, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was totally ex∣tinguished. The same happened at Aleppo in 1, 62, and such is usually the fact.</P>
<P>Let any man suppose the disease to be propagated wholly or mostly by infection, and attend to the consequences. In Alep∣po, says Russel, died 500, in 1760; in 1761, died 7000, and in 1762, 11,000. On the principle of infection then, some sick man or a bundle of old clothes, first spreads the disease, so as to destroy 500 lives—the infection of 500, destroys 7000 lives, the infection of 7000, destroys 11,000 lives; and the next year, the infection of 11,000 destroys—none at all!</P>
<P>In London, a few bales of cotton, smuggled into the city from Holland, in 1664, communicated infection that destroyed 68,000 lives; the infection from this immense number proves fatal, the next year, to 1900 only; and these, the year following, infect only 35! If infection has much con∣cern in propagating that disease, its operation certainly defeats all arithmetical calculation of its physical powers!</P>
<P>The whole theory of infection, to which Mead has given so much celebrity, and which is maintained by many physicians in this country, is absurd and ridiculous from first to last; leading legislators, magistrates and citizens astray from the truth, produ∣cing most serious inconveniences to commerce, and preventing the adoption of the only means of mitigating the pestilence to which our cities are exposed.</P>
<P>In Turkey and Egypt no pains are taken to cleanse houses or clothes after a plague. No sooner has a great plague ceased, which has cut off 300,000 people in Constantinople or Cairo, than the infected houses are filled by other people, who replace the dead, use the furniture and the bedding on which the infected
<PB N="204" REF="036687_0559_100AA515BAD8E548"/>
had died; or the old clothes are sent to auction and purchased by Jews, who retail them out for use, uncleansed; and yet amidst all this mass of concentrated infection, no person has the plague, or if a sporadic case occurs here and there, no epidemic ensues, for two, three or four years, perhaps longer; then all at once, when the infection must necessarily be destroyed, by the action of air and water, the disease breaks out again, and becomes epidemic. Then some arrival from an infected place is hunted out, and the calamity is charged to the account of some poor sick seaman, or his clothes! The infection of half a million of people, produ∣ces no plague in one year; but in another, the invisible fomes of a piece of cloth, or the breath of a single man is sufficient to spread desolation over a great city, or a kingdom!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hodges informs us, that after the plague in London, in 1665, peo∣ple returned into houses not cleansed, and even slept in beds on which the infected had died, without fear or injury. This is not at all strange. Unless the effluvia from the sick have been closely confined and are greatly condensed, they will not affect a well person; and indeed it is a difficult thing to preserve the morbid matter, in sufficient quantity to communicate disease in cold weather.</NOTE></P>
<P>Such are the absurdities of the modern notions about the plague, which adorn this splendid era of philosophy and science!—</P>
<P>Of the nature of the infecting principle in diseases, we know very little; and even its effects are not always comprehensible. We observe differences also in the operation of the principle, which we cannot explain. Why the small-pox should be com∣municated, under <HI>all</HI> circumstances; the plague only under cer∣tain circumstances, is a mystery not yet unfolded. It is suppos∣ed, that the diseased body discharges certain fine poisonous parti∣cles, which are suspended and diffused in the air, and being im∣bibed by the pores of the skin, and with the breath, excite the same spe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies of distemper in a healthy body. These effluvia generally escape our sight and very often our other senses; but they may be concentrated in such quantities, as to be very ob∣noxious to the olfactory organs, and even to excite sudden nau∣sea in the stomach.</P>
<P>But why the effluvia from the small-pox, anginas and the mea∣sles should be independent of heat and cold; and those of dys∣entery, plague, and other typhus fevers, subject to be excited
<PB N="205" REF="036687_0560_100AA51772E455E8"/>
into action by the one, and to be destroyed by the other, is a phenomenon never yet explained. We may say the particles is∣suing from the former class, are more subtle, volatile, and pene∣trating; but this is all conjecture. Certain it is, that the poison of small pox, angina and measles, is of a more distinct, specific kind, than that of the plague, less connected, in its operation, with putrid exhalations from other bodies, and less susceptible of grades in its powers.</P>
<P>So far as I am able to comprehend the nature of the infection of plague and other autumnal diseases, passing under the popular name of <HI>putrid,</HI> it appears to consist of a species of air, which is one of the elementary parts of all vegetable and animal sub∣stances. It may be what Dr. Mitchell denominates, the <HI>septic acid;</HI> that fluid which is discharged from flesh in the process of putrefaction. It may be some other species; but it is very evi∣dent, from all its effects, that it operates, in producing disease, no otherwise than all the morbid exhalations extricated from ev∣ery species of vegetable and animal substances in the putrefac∣tive process. In all or most of such substances, there is, it is well known, a species of air or acid matter, which, when in a form detached from other substances, is highly noxious to health. To this fluid, or septic acid, evolved from vegetables in a state of natural putrefaction, and floating in an aerial form, is ascribed the whole class of bilious fevers, which prevail near marshes.</P>
<P>Hence, the effluvia from a person laboring under the plague, are susceptible of all degrees of concentration, and in proportion to their concentration, will be their violence, and certainty of effect, when they attach themselves to a healthy body. In this respect the infe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on of the plague differs most essentially from that of the small pox. The matter of contagion in the small pox, however small, is sufficient to communicate the disease; and it is customary for physicians to wipe clean the point of a lan∣cet, dipped in variolous matter, before it is inserted in the skin, for the purpose of inoculation. It is also proved by experi∣ments that the quantity of infection introduced by inoculation, whether more or less, makes no material difference in the num∣ber of pustles, or violence of the disease.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="036687_0561_100AA5191D0F4CF0"/>But in the plague, the operation of infection is very different. This disease, if light, produces no infection, or very little— more violent cases appear to be more apt to be communicated— and in great plagues, the infection is visibly augmented. Yet in most pestilences, an instantaneous exposure to the effluvia from the sick will rarely produce any effect, as in the case of small pox and measles. It usually requires a person to be a considerable time in the room with the sick, in the plague, to receive poison∣ous air sufficient to excite disease; and more generally, it is not communicated, without handling the sick or imbibing his breath. In many cases, all this exposure for weeks and months together, will excite no disease. Hence Russel represents the plague, as of different degrees of malignity and not always infectious. Hence the propriety of close and indefatigable attention, in pes∣tilence, to every article of cleanliness; for by this means, the quantity of infection is reduced, and the danger diminished, from a high degree down to nothing. Not so, in small-pox and measles, the contagion of which regards no filth or cleanliness.</P>
<P>The infection of the plague, dysentery and the like seems therefore, to be nothing more than an <HI>access of noxious matter, to the local causes, morbid exhalations.</HI> The noxious air of filthy streets, docks and tenements, are secondary and augmenting causes of the plague; when the disease appears, the effluvia from the diseased still <HI>augment</HI> these other lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al causes. Thus when a certain state of air, in a city generally, will produce a malig∣nant fever, and persons are exposed to it by walking in the streets, a sick person, confined in a close room, will soon fill that room with exhalations from his lungs and pores, which will render that room <HI>more dangerous</HI> to a person in health, than the open street. This seems to be the amount of the infection of plague and other autumnal diseases.</P>
<P>Thus also in a violent plague, the common air of the streets becomes so highly infected, that persons attending the sick can∣not possibly determin whether they take the disease from the common atmosphere, or from their intercourse with infected per∣sons. The only cases which afford certainty in this resp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t, are, when the diseased are removed into the pure air of the country,
<PB N="207" REF="036687_0562_100AA51D54A4CA40"/>
and nurses and visitors, who have breathed no pestilential air in the city, are taken ill, in a few days after such intercourse with the sick. These would be clearly the produce of infection. But these cases rarely occur. It has already been observed that the worst cases of pestilence removed into the country, seldom infect the attendants. This shows how little apprehension ought to be excited by mere infection, and how ill-founded are the alarms in the country, about the spreading of the yellow fever; alarms that often occasion a neglect of diseased fugitives from the city. People in the country have little to fear from infection, if the sick are kept in airy rooms and cleanly; they ought not to abandon the sick; for the duties of humanity are not incompat∣ible with their safety. It is the infected ground, if I may so call it, the local atmosphere of pestilence which is to be dreaded, and especially by strangers. During its prevalence, in a city or town, the air of the place is rank poison to persons, accus∣tomed to good air.</P>
<P>The preceding facts and distinctions enable us to form a just es∣timate of the importance of health laws. In nine cases of ten, in which quarantine is enjoined, human efforts are opposed to the great laws of nature, and are therefore useless. In all cases, where the air of a country exhibits evidences of a pestilential constitution, in an increase of the number and violence of the symp∣toms of common diseases; in the production of certain epidem∣ics, as catarrh, anginas, measles, petechial fevers and the like; in the death of fish or the unusual diseases of cattle and other an∣imals; in the production of insects, uncommon in size, in kind or numbers; and other remarkable phenomena, before mention∣ed; in all such cases, the pestilence which invades man will be found to arise solely from the uncontrollable laws of the elements; and quarantine will be utterly unavailing to guard cities against its introduction and ravages. The remedy is not applied to the source of the disease. Hence the efforts of the police in London in the last century, and of Dantzick and Marseilles in this, were entirely useless; and hence the failure of all health laws to save our cities from the late epidemics.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="036687_0563_100AA51EDB96DDC0"/>Satisfied as I am of this truth, I would not lay aside the appli∣cation of these laws. The bare possibility of saving the lives of a few individuals, and especially of diseased seamen, is a good reason for cleansing ships after long voyages, and of purifying their cargoes, when in a bad state. But what I contend for, is, that we must not expect the best health laws, most rigorously executed, will ever be successful in g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ding cities against <HI>epidemic</HI> pestilence. In our reliance on such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ions, we expose ourselves to per∣petual disappointment; we expose the lives of citizens; we over∣look the true causes of the evil, and neglect the only means of preventing or mitigating its effects.</P>
<P>Further, the opinion of the specific contagion of the plague has originated many, not only useless, but barbarous regulations. Such is the practice of confining the sick to close houses; and still more, of confining the citizens of an infected town within its limits, by an armed force—which I am informed has been done in Europe. In Marseilles, the first persons seized were con∣fined to their houses by the point of the bayonet.</P>
<P>An ignorance of the nature of a disease and its degree of dan∣ger, may be pardonable in a prince or the legislators of a free state. But there is a point, beyond which ignorance in medical profes∣sors, becomes a crime. No science is necessary however to con∣vince any man, that most pestilences, proceed only from the de∣ranged state of the elements, aided by the morbid exhalations of cities. This is a fact that may be known to a certainty by very little reading and observation. It was well known in past ages, when men were more governed by observation, than by theories and erroneous reasoning. Mead's attempts to prove the specific contagion of plague, aided by his popularity, had a most surprising success; his treatise was received as a standard of truth; it every where suspended enquiries and checked a spirit of investigation, which might have dissipated error; it was the ba∣sis of the present laws of quarantine, which are applied, in thou∣sands of cases, where they are as improper and as little wanted, as if applied to prevent an epidemic pleurisy, or head-ache, em∣barrassing commerce, without the shadow of necessity. But these are not the worst effects. The erroneous system of specific con∣tagion,
<PB N="209" REF="036687_0564_100AA520AC820EE8"/>
has mislead mankind into a fatal security, on the subject of the local causes of diseases. Supposing the laws competent to guard public health, men have not attended to the best modes of constructing houses and cities, and to the means of watering and cleansing them—means by which all the slighter pestilences might be avoided, and the more severe ones, greatly mitigated. Hence I am persuaded, that the received theory of specific contagion is the direct cause of most of the fatal plagues that now scourge civ∣ilized Europe and America. For it will be observed, that pes∣tilence has always been the <HI>peculiar curse</HI> of <HI>populous cities.</HI> Of about two hundred general plagues, recorded in history, a few only have been so violent as to spread over countries into villages and farm houses; almost all have been limited to large towns, evi∣dently demonstrating that they would never have affected man∣kind, without the influence of the impure air generated in those places. This is a truth, as unquestionable as it is important; and on a conviction of this hangs the safety of men from that dreadful calamity. Had Mead, and other eminent physicians taken the same pains to lead mankind into truth, as into error, we should long ago have introduced improvements into the ar∣rangement and structure of our cities, which would have secured our citizens from nine tenths of the infectious diseases, by which they have been alarmed and distressed.</P>
<P>At the same time, had men understood the common operation of infection, which may be made obvious to the most ordinary minds, merchants would not, at this day, have been harrassed with the necessity of performing quarantine, to guard against <HI>epi∣demic</HI> diseases. We should not have seen a ship from the West-Indies condemned to the flames, in a British port, because she had lost her crew by the yellow fever; nor merchantmen from an American port obliged to ride quarantine in the British chan∣nel, because that disease prevailed in this country. Physicians, had they not been blinded by system, and taken opinions for granted, without enquiry into the grounds on which they rest, would have known before this, that the yellow fever will not spread in England, Scotland or Ireland. It never shows itself
<PB N="210" REF="036687_0565_100AA5230D8741C0"/>
in America, without a much greater degree of heat, than the ordinary summer temperature of those countries. The heat in those latitudes rarely exceeds, for a few hours, in a single day, 75 or at most 78 degrees by Farenheit. But no epidemic yel∣low fever is ever generated, in our climate, with that degree of heat. In general, we never see cases of that disease in America, until we have had a period of heat rising, for a considerable time, to 85 deg. or higher. In any season of ordinary temperature, the yellow fever, in the British kingdoms, and other parallels of latitude, introduced from abroad by seamen or others from war∣mer climates, would immediately subside and be extinguished, without any human efforts. The cases of malignant fever in England, which turn the body yellow, and which sometimes oc∣cur, as mentioned by Lind, are generated about marshes, in hos∣pitals, camps, ships and prisons. An epidemic yellow fever, like that which prevails in America, was never known in Eng∣land, and probably cannot exist in the climate. The quarantine enjoined on vessels from the West-Indies and United States, is utterly useless in guarding that country from this pestilence in the form of an epidemic.</P>
<P>It m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y be said, in answer to these remarks, that the yellow fe∣ver and plague are essentially the same disease; the plague has of∣ten raged in Great Britain, and therefore the climate may not re∣sist the prevalence of the yellow fever.</P>
<P>But if the plague has raged in Great Britain, which is admit∣ted, it must have arisen from the unhealthy state of the elements, which may exist in any latitude, or from very singular seasons, aided by most powerful local causes, as in London before it was burnt. I say the yellow fever will not spread in England, in the <HI>ordinary</HI> state of the elements, and the <HI>ordinary</HI> temperature of the summer. If pestilence ever invades cool northerly countries, it must always proceed principally from disorders in the elements and seasons. The ordinary causes, in temperate or cool cli∣mates, have but little influence in generating pestilence. Hence in common seasons, in England, no plague, bilious or inguinal, could be spread, unless in a crouded jail, camp, or dirty, con∣fined alley in a city. If the physicians in England observe the
<PB N="211" REF="036687_0566_100AA52694DF8950"/>
general state of health to be good; no epidemics, with unusual symptoms, prevailing: no uncommon numbers of insects; or diseases among cattle, or other symptoms of a morbid state of the elements, it is no more in the power of man to render the plague epidemic in that country, than it is the pleurisy or quin∣sey. I challenge all the faculty in Europe, to mention an in∣stance, in which plague has ever prevailed, without such phe∣nomena.</P>
<P>Besides, it seems to be probable, that more heat is necessary to generate and to propagate the bilious, than the glandular plague. My reasons for this opinion, are, that the glandular plague appears in spring much earlier than the bilious. It often appears in the northern parts of Europe, as early as March and often in May, when the weather is yet cool. But the bilious plague of our climate has not showed itself, in sporadic cases, till June, and then very rarely, and only in a few scattered cases of a less malignant type, than at a later season. To this remark, I have heard of only one exception. Generally, the disease does not appear till we have experienced some days of our hottest weather, and not till the last week in July, except in a few cases as before mentioned. It does not become formidable, as an epi∣demic, till the tenth or twentieth of August.</P>
<P>This difference seems to depend on the following circum∣stances. The glandular plague of Europe, Asia and Africa, when it breaks out in the northern latitudes, as on the Baltic or in Great Britain, seems to be more essentially and principally the product of a defective state of the elements, joined to human ex∣halations in large cities; both which causes are less dependent on heat, than the morbid exhalations of the vegetable world, which seem to give to our American plague its peculiar charac∣ter, and to be a powerful cause of the distemper. I am further confirmed in this opinion, by this circumstance. A distinction between the bili<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> fevers of our <HI>cities,</HI> and of our <HI>marshy grounds</HI> on rivers, is observed to exist, in perfect analogy with the foregoing distinction between our bilious plague and the glan∣dular plague. The mortal fevers, about marshes in the interior of our country, are less infectious, than the pestilential fevers of
<PB N="212" REF="036687_0567_100AA5281E5434B8"/>
our cities, altho they are at times as fatal, and are characterized by a yellow skin. These seem then to proceed <HI>wholly</HI> from veg∣etable exhalations. The fevers of our cities approach nearer to the plague of the east, because they proceed both from <HI>animal</HI> and <HI>vegetable</HI> exhalations, but the vegetable effluvia have a more predominating influence here, than in countries which are dry or better cultivated. Hence the mortal bilious fevers of our interi∣or country evidently form a link in the series of gradation, be∣tween the common remittents, and the yellow fever of our cities; just as the yellow fever constitutes a grade between our river or lake fevers, and the Levant plague.</P>
<P>The order of bilious fevers then stands thus in connection with their causes:—</P>

</LIST>
<P>In this gradation of diseases, there is a regular progression of symptoms. Intermittents and remittents exhibit a yellow skin, more or less, but no infection worth naming—the river or lake plague, a very yellow skin, with morbid symptoms, but little in∣fection—the bilious plague of cities, sometimes a yellow skin, sometimes not; and some cases of glandular tumors, carbuncle and petechiae; with more infection—the Levant plague, less yellowness of the skin, and usually infection and glandular swel∣lings. Thus, in proportion as the vegetable exhalations predom∣inate,
<PB N="213" REF="036687_0568_100AA52AC0BB7448"/>
in the scale of exciting causes, there is more yellowness of the skin, less infection, and less frequent affections of the glands—in proportion, as the animal exhalations abound, as the cause, the yellowness declines, and the affections of the glands multiply, with augmented infection.</P>
<P>It is the remark of the celebrated Zimmerman, that "exha∣lations from marshes do not seem to be so noxious in cold, as in hot countries; yet malignant fevers occur even in Finland. In Germany these exhalations produce tertians; in Hungary, pe∣techial fevers; in Italy, hemitritaea; in Egypt and Ethiopia, pes∣tilential fevers." On Physic, p. 131.</P>
<P>It is therefore probable that a greater degree of heat, than the ordinary temperature of Great Britain, is necessary to generate the pestilential fever of our cities. And as no degree of infec∣tion ever yet accumulated on board of a merchantman, can cre∣ate a pestilential atmosphere, sufficient to generate an epidemic, the fears of the English respecting such vessels from the United States or the West-Indies, are utterly groundless. The marsh fevers of England, Scotland and of other cool climates, are of an inferior grade. Such are the autumnal fevers near the Fenn's of Lincoln, Ely and Cambridge. In Torbat, in Scotland, a putrid fever sometimes prevails, and after death, the body turns yellow; this may be ascribed to certain natural locks or ponds which sometimes dry up in summer.</P>
<BIBL>Sinclair's Scot. vol. 6. 418, 428.</BIBL>
<P>But these diseases, tho doubtless the same in species, fall great∣ly short of the violence of our pestilential yellow fever, which never did and probably never will prevail in that climate.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XVII. Of the means of preventing or mitigating pestilential diseases.</HEAD>
<P>THE first step towards an effectual remedy for an evil, is to ascertain its nature and cause, so far as they can be understood by effects. Primary causes are above the reach of man; proxi∣mate causes, may be so far investigated, in most things, as to an∣swer all the purposes of mankind.</P>
<P>It has been proved, in the preceding pages, and every day's observation confirms the fact, that one influential cause of epi∣demic diseases, must exist in the elements, independent of all human control. In the production of epidemic catarrh or influ∣enza, for instance, no human or artificial means appear to have any share of influence. In the measles, artificial causes some∣times modify the symptoms, but have no great share in its pro∣duction or propagation. A similar remark will apply to every species of angina. The small-pox is also modified in its force and symptoms by many local circumstances; and its propagation is chiefly by means of contagion; but this disease also is some∣times, tho rarely, generated in particular bodies without conta∣gion. The appearance of those diseases in the form of epidem∣ics, excepting the small-pox which may arise from contagion, always indicates a pestilential constitution of air; and during this constitution, ordinary or annual diseases, which depend on season or local causes, assume more violent symptoms.</P>
<P>Autumnal diseases of the annual or ordinary kind, tho ren∣dered more violent, fatal and extensive, by a pestilential state of air, are however generated by subordinate causes, most of which are within the power of man. The dysentery depends partly on season, partly on situation, as to pure air, and partly perhaps on the imperfection of autumnal fruits▪ Sometimes it arises in
<PB N="215" REF="036687_0570_100AA52FB9B99E50"/>
camps from bad diet, or want of shelter from the weather; and when it once exists, is more or less propagated by infection. But this disease is rendered more malignant, by elemental causes.</P>
<P>Ordinary bilious fevers of all grades are produced usually by miasmata or morbid exhalations from low, damp, marshy grounds; where vegetables, in the hot season, are in a state of rapid pu∣trefaction. These fevers occur annually, and with a violence of symptoms proportioned to the extent and force of the morbid cause. The origin and phenomena of all this description of diseases are so well known, as to render any observations of mine, unnecessary.</P>
<P>The plague, glandular and bilious, seems to be nearly allied in its symptoms, to the ordinary bilious remittent. The point seems not altogether settled, whether the contagious yellow fe∣ver, as it is usually called, and the common sporadic yellow fever of the West-Indies, and the bilious remittent, are different grades of one species of disease; or whether they are of distinct species.</P>
<P>On this point however, the late epidemics have furnished our scientific men with proofs that appear to me to decide the question, in favor of the identity of the species. The evidence arising from the disease in Baltimore is alone sufficient to decide it, as far as it regards the yellow fever and the remitting; and the Acad∣emy of Medicine in Philadelphia is a most respectable authority in favor of the same doctrin.</P>
<P>That the glandular plague of the Levant, and the bilious, in∣fectious yellow fever of our country, are specifically the same disease, I have no doubt; but they take some different symptoms, either from climate, or other causes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>known. The glandular tumors are held, by most writers on the plague, to be the char∣acteristics of the disease, which alone decide its nature, and dis∣tinguish it from other malignant fevers. But Diemerbroeck and all the best authors agree that these external swellings are not essential to the disease, and that many have the true plague without them. They are however the usual marks of the disease.</P>
<P>In our bilious pestilence, these swellings are less common. But, tho rare, they sometimes appear, in the most unequivocal
<PB N="216" REF="036687_0571_100AA5320D31E248"/>
form of the true pesti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. I saw an instance in 179<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and they were more common in the last epidemic. An instance occurred, within my knowledge, in which two auxiliary tumors appeared, and the person was never confined by fever.</P>
<P>The yellowness of the skin has given name to the pestilence of our country; yet this is a misfortune, for it may deceive a common observer. A yellow skin often accompanies lower grades of bilious fevers, not pestilential; and is, by no m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ans, essential to the infectious yellow fever. In all our late epidemics, per∣sons have died without exhibiting this color of the skin; and it has been less common the last year, than in former years. It appears then, that the lighter the epidemic disease, the more common the yellowness of the skin; and vice versa. This is no inconsiderable proof of the identity of the bilious and ingui∣nal plague; that in proportion as the bilious plague of our cli∣mate becomes violent and approaches the true plague, it loses that yellow color of the skin, and assumes the glandular swellings. This I am informed is the fact, as observed by the physicians in New-York, the summer past. There are however some differ∣ences in the symptoms of the two species of plague, which it belongs to the faculty to observe and define. It may be that the moisture of our country, not yet cleared of its woods, and abounding with swamps and marshes, may occasion the differen∣ces in the symptoms. The parts of Europe, Asia and Africa where the plague most usually prevails, are clear of woods, and cultivated. Perhaps an increase of population, and human efflu∣via, with a decrease of vegetable exhalations in America from cultivation, may in time change the form of our pestilential fever into the true inguinal plague. I have reasons for believing such a change actually took place in Rome. Some of the plagues, described by Livy were obviously of the bilious kind, similar to our epidemic fever; but in later periods, the plagues in Rome are expressly described to be, "pestis inguinaria."</P>
<P>However this may be, the causes of pestilence I suppose to be, first some essential alteration in the primary qualities of air and water, owing to seasons, or to the action of the principle of fire, the main operative agent in the earth and atmosphere; which al∣teration
<PB N="217" REF="036687_0572_100AA5342798E2F8"/>
is demonstrated by various epidemics and especially by ca∣tarrh —secondly, the subordinate causes of plague, are, noxious exhalations of every kind, which diminish the proportion of vi∣tal air imbibed into the lungs. Both causes appear to produce dis∣ease, either by excessive excitement, inducing <HI>indirect</HI> debility; or by reducing excitement, and inducing <HI>direct</HI> debility. The äerial or elemental cause seems to produce excessive excitement; for its first effect appears in catarrh, a disease of stenic or inflam∣matory diathesis. Thus the present epidemic constitution was preceded by influenza, of universal prevalence and of severe symp∣toms.</P>
<P>Measles, another disease that rarely fails to characterize the early stages of a pestilential constitution, is also of an inflamma∣tory diathesis. The same is true of the common distinct small-pox —another disease, which, before the art of inoculation, seldom failed to rage in cities, during such a constitution.</P>
<P>Anginas are of different types; some of the milder kinds are ranged by Brown amomg stenic diseases; but the angina maligna he considers as astenic. Diseases of this class however form a part of the effects of a pestilential constitution.</P>
<P>Next to this species of diseases, may be arranged the petechial fevers, which under the names of purple, or spotted, have often overspread Europe, and rarely fail to precede the plague. These are the product of the last stages of a pestilential constitution, next to the true plague, which marks the crisis. These forms of malignant fever have never occurred in America, as epidem∣ics; but purple and livid spots, vibices and all the variety of eruptions, which belong to that class of diseases, occur occasion∣ally during pestilence.</P>
<P>It is a remarkable fact, and one that seems to have escaped ob∣servation, that a pestilential constitution of air in all ages and countries, produces epidemic disorders of the <HI>eruptive</HI> kind. I question whether in a single instance, since the days of Moses, the real plague, ever became epidemic, without one, two or all of that kind of diseases for its precursors. We cannot look into an author, who has described the diseases which prevail in such
<PB N="218" REF="036687_0573_100AA53864D060A0"/>
a constitution, from Hippocrates down to our time, but we see ignes sacri, variolae, morbilli or other <HI>eruptive</HI> disorders, consti∣tuting a part of the description. These diseases seem evidently to be classed by the laws of nature, and always to appear, in close connection.</P>
<P>Hence the propriety of Sydenham's observation, p. 120 that "the erysipelas, ignis sacer, is a good deal like the plague, and sometimes accompanied with pains in the glands—that it begins much in the same manner as the plague, but the plague is much more violent than an erysipelas."</P>
<P>Hence also we observe that Hippocrates, in describing a pes∣tilential constitution, mentions that before spring appeared "eru∣sipélata polla," many cases of the erysipelas, of a bad type, and mortal.</P>
<BIBL>De morb. Vulgar. Sec. 2.</BIBL>
<P>This is a curious phenomenon and worthy of investigation, that a particular constitution of the atmosphere, should, in its different stages or in different seasons of the year, tend to generate all those diseases, which throw out upon the surface of the body, petechiae, vibices, a general efflorescence and tumors, with various other appearances. It belongs to medical men to explain the general proximate cause, which, while its effects are various, still gives to diseases some common similitude.</P>
<P>In America, a pestilential constitution exhibits the same phe∣nomena, as measles, and anginas, but without the purple or spotted fever, as the precursor of our pestilence. The immedi∣ate precursors of the bilious plague in America, are catarrhous affections, disorders of the throat, and especially bilious fevers of a bad type, ending often in black vomit. Detached cases of this latter disease rarely or never fail to introduce or p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cede the in∣fectious epidemic.</P>
<P>But no disease whatever seems more closely connected with pestilence than catarrh. An epidemic influenza, is almost inva∣riably the signal of the approach of a pestilential constitution; and during the whole existence of the constitution, catarrhous affections are frequent in particular seasons, and especially just before or after the prevalence of a pestilential fever. This cir∣cumstance affords no inconsiderable evidence, that what we call
<PB N="219" REF="036687_0574_100AA5363022EBF8"/>
an epidemic constitution acts upon the human body as a violent stimulus. The first diseases excited by it are usually of the in∣flammatory diathesis as catarrh and measles. Hence perhaps we derive a clue to explain the mystery of the pestilential diseases which succeed.</P>
<P>The continued effect of excessive stimulus, must be debility. The epidemic constitution, when it first commences, is mild, and produces stenic diseases, not very mortal, as catarrh and measles; for a very obvious reason, the force of the stimulus is not at first sufficient to hasten on the indirect debility of the system, or to produce the astenic diathesis in a fatal degree. But as this state of air advances in strength, the stimulus is greater; and when aided by the heat of summer, produces a degree of excitement, that speedily induces universal debility. Hence the pestilential fevers of summer and autumn seem to be the effect of excessive stimulus, acting upon the system with such violence, as to produce speedy debility, in consequence of which, all the functions of the system are weakened and deranged—the stomach does not digest food—the peristaltic motion is imperfect and feeble—the liver and the gall-bladder do not perform their secretions—the energy of the brain is diminished—the extreme vessels are relaxed. The con∣sequence is, that part of aliment which ought to be separated and carried off by the intestines, as the hepatic fluid, is retained, and forced out of its proper ducts, into other parts of the system, where it excites external eruptions, efflorescence, or yellow∣ness; in every part of the body, becoming rank poison, and speedily inducing fever, morbid affections, and dissolution.</P>
<P>This process is infinitely modified by subordinate causes; as seasons, which are extremely various; local exhalations and stag∣nant air, which are deleterious according to their force; the vari∣ous modes of living, which strengthen or weaken the human body; and accidental circumstances, as fatigue, grief, fear, exposure to excessive heat, or sudden cold; and innumerable similar causes.</P>
<P>This idea of the proximate cause of the bilious plague of our climate was imbibed from observation and conversation with phy∣sicians, before I had read Brown's Elements of Medicin. I am happy enough to find, on reading that work, a confirmation of
<PB N="220" REF="036687_0575_100AA53A009A6370"/>
the opinion. That author observes, paragraph 137. "Some∣times the secretory vessels seemed crammed with a colluvies of fluids, capable of producing indirect debility, as in that over∣flowing of bile, which distinguishes the yellow fever of the tor∣rid zone."</P>
<P>This "colluvies of fluids," lodged in the secretory vessels, seems to act like poison, in disorganizing the system. And the reason why the plague is so often incurable, seems to be the ra∣pidity and the imperceptibility of the action of that poison, which appears totally to undermine the vital powers, before it exhibits much pain or fever. This is not its common mode of operation; but it is not unfrequent. Cases of this kind are soon characterized by a total prostration of strength, a cadaverous look, and a dull, glassy, languid eye, so often described by med∣ical writers. In such cases, debilitating remedies precipitate death; and stimulants are ineffectual to revive the languid func∣tions.</P>
<P>In most cases however the approaches of the disease are ac∣companied with pains, uneasiness, and febrile symptoms, while the system yet retains its stenic diathesis; in some such cases, de∣bilitating remedies are useful; but the rapidity of the progress of the poison soon changes the diathesis to astenic.</P>
<P>Boyle remarks vol. 1. 672, "that a day or two before the plague has manifested itself, in some persons, their vision has been affected; objects appearing diversified with beautiful colors. A vomit administered to such, usually gave relief." Every ob∣servation of such eminent men deserves consideration; but I do not remember to have found the same in any other author. If just, is it not an evidence that the state of air, inducing the dis∣ease, operates <HI>first as a stimulus?</HI></P>
<P>Procopius has recorded of the plague of 543, a phenomenon somewhat similar to that noticed by Boyle. He says, persons imagined they saw phantoms or ghosts, which made them suppose they were smitten by some person. Such as had this imagina∣tion, soon perished with the plague.</P>
<P>In 746 also persons were troubled with phantastical images which filled them with terror. See also the plague in Carthage before Christ 404.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="036687_0576_100B2C4ED90CF6C0"/>General appearances favor the idea, that what is usually called an epidemic state of air, produces, in the human system, unusual excitement by excessive stimulus. But then how shall we ac∣count for the angina maligna, a disease of extreme astenic di∣athesis, which often forms one of the series of epidemics, be∣longing to the same constitution? Is this also the effect of exces∣sive excitement, inducing great debility? Is not its prevalence principally among children of sound health, a proof that it is the consequence of indirect debility?</P>
<P>However these questions may be decided, certain it is that under the same constitution, and during the same pestilence, the fatal diseases assume very different symptoms, and exhibit, indif∣ferent bodies, a different diathesis. In all epidemics of this sort, a principal object of the physician is to ascertain the general di∣athesis produced by the constitution of air, and the various ef∣fects of it in different bodies. "Hic labor, hoc opus est."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Is not the doctrin of indirect and direct debility, as the source of all diseases fully implied in the first paragraph of Aristotle's first pro∣blem? It may be thus rendered. "Why have great excesses a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣cy to produce disease, but because they occasion too much or to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ittle excitement, in which all diseases consist." If this is not the precise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the author; his doctrin leads to the same results, as those which form the ingenious brunonian system. Many things appear to us <HI>now,</HI> which are 2000 years old; and solely because we neglect ancient au∣thors.</NOTE></P>
<P>The secondary or auxiliary causes of plague, coming under the denomination of <HI>impure air,</HI> are supposed to act upon the system, by directly debilitating powers. "It cannot be doubted, says Brown, 145, that the application of air, to the whole sur∣face of the body is a necessary stimulus. The air is seldom ap∣plied in a pure state; it is commonly blended with <HI>foreign mat∣ters, that diminish its stimulating power,</HI> and tho its salutary stim∣ulus depends upon its purity, it is uncertain whether ever its pu∣rity goes so far as to stimulate in excess and thereby produce stenic diathesis." I know not what this author would call "purity of air," but I am very certain that an epidemic influ∣enza procee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from some qualities in the atmosphere, and this author agrees the disease to be of stenic diathesis. If the dis∣ease is the effect of "foreign matter," infused into the air, then this foreign matter is of a stimulating quality.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="036687_0577_100AA53BB078D428"/>I suspect however that the atmosphere should be considered as composed of two principal substances, <HI>air</HI> and <HI>fire,</HI> or <HI>electricity.</HI> Morbid matter floats in the <HI>air,</HI> but the principal stimulating power probably consists in the <HI>electricity</HI> of the atmosphere.</P>
<P>The influence of morbid exhalations from putrefying substan∣ces, is, probably to diminish the stimulant power of the atmos∣phere, inducing direct debility. The lungs receive, at every breath, a certain quantity of air; that is, about the same cubic quantity. A certain portion of this, is vital air, oxygen, which serves as food for the lungs and blood, and which is separated from the rest and absorbed. Whenever therefore common air is impregnated with an undue proportion of hydrogene, or with any species of acid, which is hostile to the lungs, these viscera want their proportion of food, or stimulus; the consequence is, their action is weakened, and the heart and arteries want their due force; the effect of which is a more feeble circulation of blood. Perhaps also the septic acid, conveyed to the blood with common air, at every inspiration, gradually destroys its texture.</P>
<P>Sorbait mentions that a lighted candle being placed near per∣sons dying with the plague, a livid vapor has been seen, issuing from their mouths. Extremely vitiated must be the air from the lungs, before it can be rendered inflammable.</P>
<P>But whatever may be the process, we know the effects of respiration in air vitiated by morbid exhalations, to be fevers of various kinds, as intermitting, remitting, dysenteric, and putrid or pestilential. That state of the atmosphere which I call <HI>pesti∣lential,</HI> has a singular effect in increasing the irritability of the nervous system, by which means slighter causes than usual occa∣sion dangerous inflammation.</P>
<P>Having then arrived at the probable causes of the pestilential fevers which afflict the earth, we are prepared to consider the means of prevention.</P>
<P>The first article under this head, is, the removal of all local causes of disease; such as every species of putrescible substances, which, in the process of putrefaction, emit a species of air highly unfriendly to health. It will be observed that I speak of
<PB N="223" REF="036687_0578_100AA53FDD9E7D30"/>
<HI>putrescible</HI> substances; for flesh or vegetables, which have under∣gone the process of putrefaction, or of digestion in a healthy stomach, discharge little or none of the pernicious acid.</P>
<P>Hence we observe that people in cities rely too much on clean∣sing streets to preserve public health. Experience proves that the utmost care in cleansing streets will not always prevent pesti∣lence. The reason is obvious; most of the filth of streets con∣sists of excrementitious matter from horses or oxen, which has undergone the process mentioned, and contains no septic acid, or very little. Hence the accumulation of dung in the farmer's yard, is not known to generate diseases.</P>
<P>Various other substances, thrown into the streets of cities, are more pernicious; as green vegetables, the garbage of fish, lees of fermenting liquors, and many others, which, in hot weather, soon putrefy and discharge noxious air. Such substances how∣ever never ought to be thrown into the street in hot weather; they should be thrown into the ocean, into rivers of running water, or what is better still, <HI>buried,</HI> and that before putrefaction begins. If putrefaction is began, they should be removed in covered vessels.</P>
<P>The vaults of cloacina, altho they contain mostly substances, which have passed through digestion, and in their unmixed state, are not <HI>very</HI> pernicious, yet they are always mixed with other substances, which, in hot weather, bring on fermentation. These should be either cleansed annually in spring, or the matter in them neutralized by quick-lime.</P>
<P>All filthy substances should be removed from streets, both for the sake of decency and of health. If the pavements of streets could be covered with pure earth, it would greatly lessen the heat; but this is not practicable. The only effectual remedy, is fresh running water—the only article that unites cleanliness with coolness. Nothing, in a city, can be an adequate substi∣tute; for while it removes the causes of noxious vapors, and by cooling the sultry air of a city, prevents debility, it extricates a considerable quantity of new and wholesome air, from its own substance, and absorbs pernicious vapors.</P>
<P>Streets should also be so constructed as to give the water a con∣siderable
<PB N="224" REF="036687_0579_100AA54224D3D370"/>
velocity. The practice of levelling the surface of a city, is most pernicious. If possible, every street in a city should have a descent of fifteen or twenty degrees. Instead of levelling the earth, the police of a city should counteract even a natural level, by throwing the whole into artificial elevations; which give a brisker currency both to water and air.</P>
<P>Cellars should be so constructed, as to retain no water; and often cleansed by scraping. If the surface of the cellar can be conveniently changed, by removing a few inches of the old carth and introducing that which is fresh, it would be a very sal∣utary labor. Nothing imbibes and neutralizes infectious matter, more readily than fresh earth.</P>
<P>The liberal use of water, in and about a house, cannot be too seriously recommended. Water absorbs all noxious matter that comes in contact with it in substance. Applied to floors, wood∣en, stone or brick walls, to clothes, to furniture, to back-yards and streets; it is every where salutary in the summer months. Dr. Priestly observes, that water purifies vitiated air, by absorb∣ing the septic part. Hence its great utility as a preservative against pestilential diseases.</P>
<P>All dead animals in a city or its vicinity, should be buried or burnt; as cats, dogs and horses. The indecency alone of suf∣fering their carcases to putrefy before the eyes of mankind, ought to make it a strict article of police, to remove them. But they should be buried; not one should be permitted to offend the eyes or nostrils of a citizen.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From two years observations, made as I passed daily from New-York to my residence in the country, I judge from twenty to thirty worn-out cart-horses die and putrefy in the suburbs of that city, every year.</NOTE> They are offensive to decency, to moral sentiments and to health. The ancient method of burning dead bodies was well calculated to destroy the poison; but in Atlantic America, burial is cheaper and equally effectual.</P>
<P>Common sewers are often common nuisances. In cities, all filthy substances should be conveyed off, on the visible surface of the earth, unless sewers can be so constructed as to deposit, with certainty, all their contents in running water. Serious evils arise from putrid substances lodged in sewers, that are too level, and
<PB N="225" REF="036687_0580_100AA543DF48E170"/>
which serve as reservoirs instead of canals, accumulating putres∣cible matters, in places where their exhalations, by the influence of moisture, are doubled, instead of being removed.</P>
<P>In cities, where all filth is naturally cast by rains into the docks, it would be well that all wharves should be so constructed, as to present a smooth uniform front to the stream, and be ex∣tended into deep water. Mud, washed by the salt tides, and not mixed with putrescible matters, produces no inconvenience to health; but such matters, thrown into docks, bare at low water, and exposed to a hot sun, dissolve most rapidly, and gen∣erate morbid vapors. Many improvements are yet to be made in our sea-ports, which will lessen the accumulation of perni∣cious air.</P>
<P>A great and most desirable article in a system for the preserva∣tion of health, is, the purifying of rooms from air which has been respired for a length of time. By experiment it is found that the air of rooms that have been slept in, is very insalu∣brious; and probably more so, than the air of privies, which is found to contain less noxious air than was formerly supposed. See Encyclopedia, art. Atmosphere. Indeed, it is questionable whether there is any <HI>necessary</HI> connection between offensive smells and insalubrity. Nature has kindly provided that dead feces should not be very pernicious to health; but the effluvia of liv∣ing and fermenting bodies are to be avoided as rank poison. In this respect cleanliness is made essential to health.</P>
<P>It is impossible in a work of this kind to enter upon the details of cleansing a great commercial city. The magistrates, aided by medical men, in every city, will attend to the minute regu∣lations for preserving a pure air.</P>
<P>But there are other causes of autumnal diseases, which must not be overlooked.</P>
<P>It is remarked by writers that the diseases from marshes and stagnant waters are most violent near their sources; and gradu∣ally abate in their violence and become less common, as they re∣cede from those sources. See Buel on the marsh fevers at Shef∣field. Medical Repos. vol. 1. 457. Hence, in a country gen∣erally mountainous or hilly, dry and salubrious, but containing
<PB N="226" REF="036687_0581_100AA54654327C88"/>
here and there a pond of dead water or marsh, the bilious fevers generated by the effluvia, will be local, rarely extending beyond one mile and a half from their source.</P>
<P>But there are some extensive marshes, which may produce ef∣fects to a much greater distance. Such are the low grounds in Hungary, a sickly region; the pontine marshes near Naples, which may affect the health of people in Rome; the flat lands and rice plantations in Bengal on the Ganges—the coast of Ter∣ra Firma in South-America, and the marshes from E. Florida to the Delaware in North America. The fevers of Cambridge, Ely and Lincolnshire in England, may be classed with those above mentioned; but are of smaller extent.</P>
<P>It is an opinion in Constantinople that the frequency of the plague in that city, is to be attributed to the northerly winds, which come from the marshes of Tartary and Russia, bordering on the Euxine, sweeping that sea, and conveying moisture and noxious exhalations.</P>
<P>The position of that city is otherwise a very healthy one—the climate is temperate—the site of the city, high, dry and rising into hills and mountains on the west. No cause of unusual dis∣eases can be found in the neighborhood. The causes within the city, are powerful. Many of the streets are narrow, filthy, crou∣ded, and almost obstructed by pent-houses. But in this respect, Constantinople is not worse than one half the cities of Europe. Shall we then admit that winds will convey morbid exhalations, several hundred miles, without dissipating them, so as to render them innoxious? Let us attend to other facts.</P>
<P>No city in Europe, except Constantinople, has been more fre∣quently desolated by plagues, than Rome, from the time of Rom∣ulus to the close of the last century. Shall we ascribe this, to the vast marshes which border the shore from the mouths of the Tiber to Naples? Certain it is, that Rome has ever been consid∣ered, as a very unhealthy city; and the terrible plagues which ravaged it, when in the utmost prosperity, as well as in modern times, justify this opinion. So sensible have the inhabitants been of the prevalence of this opinion abroad, and the ill-effects of it in preventing strangers from resorting to the city, that Lancisius,
<PB N="227" REF="036687_0582_100AA5496134B3B0"/>
an eminent physician of the present century, wrote a considerable treatise, evidently with a view to remove this opinion.</P>
<P>This author observes, that south winds at Rome, if violent, humid, with clouds and heat, produce inconvenience, and if they pass over marsh, they may bring "particulas lethiferas," ve∣ry pernicious vapors, which produce pestilential diseases.</P>
<P>The Romans very early took measures to correct the evils to which the city was exposed. The enormous cloacae, or sew∣ers were raised at a vast expense, to carry off all stagnant water, and dry the soil, and while kept clean, were very useful. Hence cloacina was deified as the goddess of health. These sewers were under the care of certain officers, called "Curatores Cloa∣carum Urbis." In one instance, these drains had been a long time neglected, and were cleansed at the expense of a thousand talents. Severe laws were enacted, prohibiting individuals, un∣der penalty of a fine, to suffer water to stagnate.</P>
<P>Lancisius ascribes the severe diseases which afflicted Rome, in the decline of the Empire, to the destruction of the aqueducts and neglect of the sewers. In 1695, when the ditch of Adri∣an's tower, and the great sewer of the city Leoninae, were filled with filth, immediately on the blowing of the south wind, began pestilential diseases. By order of the Pope, at this author's sug∣gestion, the streets, vaults, ditches and all similar places, were thoroughly cleansed, and ten years after, no epidemic malignant disease had appeared. He however observes that when a south wind blows for <HI>a long time,</HI> acute fevers, tertians, pains in the head, and vertigo become epidemic. This must be occasioned by the debilitating effects of that wind, or by miasmata convey∣ed from a distance, probably from the pontine marshes.</P>
<BIBL>See Lancisius, passim.</BIBL>
<P>Egypt is a flat country, containing not much marsh, but annual∣ly overflowed, and subject to most of the inconveniences of marshy countries, from the drying of its moist surface, in very hot weather. Here again we have a nursery of pestilence.</P>
<P>The banks of the Euphrates and Tigris are nearly in the same predicament, and Bassora, is in Persia, what Cairo, is in Egypt.</P>
<P>Most of the coast of South America, from Carthagena to the Oronoke, is bordered with marsh, and is every where sickly.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="036687_0583_100AA54B82507BC8"/>But what shall we say to the marsh on our own shore? The low swampy lands that border all the rivers, in the flat country of Maryland, Virginia and the Carolinas, and the immense tract of bog in Virginia called the <HI>dismal?</HI> The effects of them on the neighboring inhabitants are well known—annual and almost universal intermittents, and often, remittents.</P>
<P>Is it not possible and probable, that the noxious exhalations from these vast hot-beds of putrefaction, are borne on the south-westerly winds, which prevail almost constantly in June, July and August, and which run parallel with the general trending of the coast, from Florida to New-York? Do they not impregnate the whole atmosphere for a considerable breadth, and sweep the country, from the eastern shore of the Chesapeek to Philadel∣phia, New-Jersey, and in a slighter degree, to New-York? I do not give a positive opinion on this subject; but the annual prevalence of flight intermittents on York-Island, and in the city, tho far removed from any marsh, and continually ventilated by sea breezes, as well as washed by rapid tides, affords some ground to believe this suggestion.</P>
<P>It is confirmatory of this idea, that soon after leaving York-Island towards the east, all intermittents disappear; unless in a very few places, where they proceed from obvious local causes: Now it must be observed, that the coast of the United States, runs generally from south-west to north-east; but at New-York, it takes a different course, and runs about east by north, for two hundred miles. This course soon carries the people on the shore, beyond the reach of the supposed stream of morbid vapor, from the southern marshes, whose course is with the south westerly winds.</P>
<P>I am not attached to this idea; but it is in conformity with the opinion of the insalubrity of the Euxine winds at Constan∣tinople; and with the effects of the southerly Calabrian wind, blowing over the pontine marshes, towards Rome. Lancisius relates a remarkable fact. Thirty gentlemen and ladies went on a party of pleasure, towards the mouth of the Tiber. The wind shifted suddenly, and blew from the marshes, "paludes ostienses," and twenty-nine of them were immediately seized with a tertian. If such was the effect of the vapors from those
<PB N="229" REF="036687_0584_100AA54D12A744C0"/>
marshes, we may suppose the vast pontine marsh would poison the air to a much greater distance.</P>
<P>That the extensive morasses, along our southern shore, are pregnant with mischief to that country is certain; that the peo∣ple of Philadelphia and New-York are affected by them, may be possible. It would therefore deserve consideration, whether the evil will admit of a remedy. There are two modes of ren∣dering marshy lands and stagnating water salub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s—one, by draining the lands and cultivating them; the other by turning into them streams of running water. It is probable that most of the marsh at the southward, being within reach of tides, and below high water, is incapable of being drained. It is the pon∣tine region of North-America. How far the second plan can be applied with success, I have not the local knowledge of the land and rivers to determin. The classic reader will recollect the instance, related in history of Empedocles, the Sicilian phi∣losopher and poet, who put an end to pestilential diseases, a∣mong the Saliuntii, by turning two streams of good water into the marshes, f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om which they originated.</P>
<P>If there is a possibility of drying any of the lands, now cov∣ered with poison, or of putting the dead water into motion, the United States have a vast interest in effecting that object; and expenses are not to be put in competition with the health and lives of our citizens.</P>
<P>The same remark is applicable to all the marshes in other parts of the country, as about some of the lakes; and to all smaller sources of disease, swamps and ponds. In every possible situation, where stagnant water contains vegetable substances in abundance, diseases must prevail. Running water, on the other hand, is salubrious. It not only does not exhale morbid air, but it generates fresh and pure air; at the same time, it creates a gentle breeze by its current, which helps to dissipate any nox∣ious particles in its neighborhood which may arise from other sources.</P>
<P>People in the country cannot be too careful in selecting a spot for their habitation. The question, of continued health or dis∣ease, of long life or premature death, hangs very often upon the choice of a salubrious situation for a house.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="036687_0585_100AA54FC5826298"/>A farmer should never plant his dwelling by the side of a marsh. Whatever may be the situation of his lands, he is inex∣cuseable, if he builds his mansion within a mile of the sources of disease and death. Better for him to go a mile and a half to his daily labor, enjoying robust health, than to live within the circulation of poisonous vapors, afflicted by diseases for three months in the year. And when a farmer has the misfortune to be obliged to labor occasionally in the vicinity of stagnant water, he should be careful not to enter upon the ground early in the morning, before the noxious vapors have been raised and attenu∣ated by the heat of the sun, nor should he continue there, till late in the evening.</P>
<P>People in the country should select hilly or elevated positions for their houses; where the surface of the earth is dry, and there is a free circulation of pure air. There is another reason —the water on high grounds is always better than in low, swampy places. Water in flat lands stagnates beneath the surface, as well as above; but on hills, it is in constant motion. Hence if men expect good water they must seek for it on mountains, hills and rising grounds. The Arabians advise that houses should be set on high, airy places, near fresh water.</P>
<P>When a choice of difficulties occurs, and men are compelled to live near marsh, they should endeavor to place their dwelling on the windward side of the marsh, which, in America, is the south and west; the summer winds being from these points. This will often make a prodigious difference in the state of health.</P>
<P>The fables of antiquity are mostly obscure and not well under∣stood by the moderns; but some of them are easily explained, and contain most excellent lessons. The story of Python, the huge serpent, which alarmed and infested the world, until he was slain by Apollo, is of this kind. Python was generated by the action of heat on the mud and slime, which covered the earth, after the recess of the water of Ducalion's flood. That is, Python was disease, proceeding from noxious exhalations, in hot seasons, which was destroyed by Apollo, the sun, which dried and puri∣fied the earth. See Ovid, Metam. lib. 1. This fable had its origin in Egypt, where Python was killed by Isis and Orus.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="036687_0586_100AA551FAC39828"/>Of what consequence is it that we read books, if we neither understand nor practise the lessons they contain?</P>
<P>But after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tending to every circumstance that can assist in guarding health from the annoyances that are local and visible, we have a further task to perform, to lessen the effects of that ele∣mental principle of disease, which has been proved to exist, in every clime, at certain unequal periods. If, it will be said, such a cause of epidemic diseases, does in fact exist, and operate on every species of life, vegetable and animal, this cause is above hu∣man control; all our efforts to avoid its effects, are useless; and we are doomed by the decrees of heaven, to be the victims of pestilence, without hope or remedy.</P>
<P>To this I answer; that if all history is not a forgery, the state of the elements, has, in few instances, been so ill-adapted to sup∣port health and life, or so positively pernicious, that men have perished by millions, in the most healthy regions, exposed to no local causes of disease whate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, except such as exist in the most healthy periods. This I must believe; but the fact affords no ground of complaint against providence; for the same fate has attended all other species of animals. The horse, the ox, the sheep, the dog, the cat, the fowls, and the fish, are subject to the same universal law of the physical world; and on what prin∣ciple will man arraign this disposition of all created life, or claim an exemption from the laws, to which all other species of animals are subjected?</P>
<P>But we are not altogether without hope, even in the desperate circumstances mentioned. If we attend to the causes of plagues, we shall find they all tend to destroy life by <HI>one general ef∣fect,</HI> which is, <HI>debility.</HI> Either directly or indirectly, all the ex∣citing causes close their operation on the system, by inducing <HI>de∣bility,</HI> leaving the nerves, muscles, and intestines in a relaxed, languid state.</P>
<P>If this principle is just, and it is agreeable to the medical idea that debility is the cause of all fevers, we have a clue that will lead us to the means of escaping the evils of pestilence.</P>
<P>In the morbid state of air, producing the uncontrollable pesti∣lences, which have assailed man in the healthiest situations on the
<PB N="232" REF="036687_0587_100AA554D470F8A0"/>
globe, we observe that the most terrible effects have been pro∣duced, in seasons, when the air has been warm, humid, une∣lastic, with light southerly breezes; as in the reign of M. Au∣relius, of Gallienus, and of Edward III. This state of the air served very much to aid the pestilential principle, in debilitat∣ing the human body. All local causes probably tend to the same effect.</P>
<P>The great desideratum then is, how to counteract the debili∣itating operation of these causes, and <HI>preserve the tone of the sys∣tem.</HI> I am persuaded that all the means of prevention are com∣prised in that idea. No man is taken ill with this furious disease, until his nervous system and his intestines cease to perform their usual functions, and secretions are suspended or diminished. Hence persons, as long as their evacuations are regular, may walk with safety in the most infected places, until their eyes and their color exhibit the poison that is imbibed; yet they will not suffer by the disease, while the vessels have strength to discharge the morbid matter by regular secretions and evacuations. This is a known and a common fact.</P>
<P>Hence some persons and even physicians have resorted, du∣ring the plague, to small doses of calomel, or other purgative, to keep open bowels. A most pernicious practice to those in health, for it induces the very evil meant to be avoided, <HI>debility;</HI> and ultimately, the intestines becoming unable to perform their functions, disease and death ensue. I am well informed of a number of cases of this kind, in New-York, the last summer, which ended in death.</P>
<P>The <HI>true means</HI> to preserve the natural tone of the body, are the <HI>most natural means.</HI></P>
<P>First. Food is the natural stimulus of the system. During pestilence therefore this article demands the first notice. It is agreed by all writers, and observation justifies the opinion, that temperance is essential to health, during a sickly season. Some persons, mistaking temperance for abstinence, have run into an extreme of abstinence, which has been fatal to them. The true point to be observed, is, to take as much food and drink, as will sustain the body in its usual degree of strength; without
<PB N="233" REF="036687_0588_100AA556858B3850"/>
overcharging it with stimulus. Too much food produces unusual excitement, which is followed by indirect debility, a state of body which invites an attack of pestilence. Too little nourish∣ment, on the other hand, induces direct debility, a state equally favorable to disease. I have good grounds for believing some very valuable citizens of New-York, of my acquaintance, fell sacrifices to their excess of caution in the use of food, during the last epidemic.</P>
<P>It is not improbable that different constitutions of air, as they produce various symptoms in the same diseases, may require or admit of very different degrees of stimulus, applied to the hu∣man body. The epidemic in New-York in 1795, like that in Philadelphia in 1793, was characterized with inflammatory di∣athesis, more frequently than in 1798. Hence venesection, which had acquired great celebrity in 1793, lost part of its credit, in 1798, and was used with more discrimination and caution.</P>
<P>I suspect the same circumstance has changed or modified the opinion of the great utility of abstaining from generous diet and liquors. This opinion was general and well received in 1795; nor have any cases come to my knowledge, in which the practice was supposed to be injurious. But in 1798, many instances oc∣curred where persons of the most slender habits, of strict absti∣nence from stimulating diet, and who weakened the system by purges, were seized with uncommon violence by the pestilence, and perished. On the contrary, I am acquainted with several physicians, who took their usual quantity of food, with some wine and more than their customary quantity of porter, who at∣tended the sick, thro the season, visiting the most infected places, without suffering the least inconvenience to their health.</P>
<P>If the point is admitted that debility is the great proximate cause of this disease, which I think cannot be contested, the consequence is plain, that whatever tends to reduce the vigor of the system below its usual standard, must be prejudicial, during its prevalence. Hence the propriety of rather increasing than les∣sening the usual quantity of food, or natural stimulus; carefully avoiding, at the same time, all excess in eating or drinking, which is equally dangerous.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="036687_0589_100AA5581EE3F198"/>Another thing to be observed, in summer, and especially in time of pestilence, is, the guarding the body, but by all means, the head, from the direct rays of the sun. Nothing is more dange∣rous than the burning heat of a clear sun, in sultry weather. It often produces sudden death, by means of an apoplexy, instan∣ces of which are related under the year 1752, to have happened at Charleston; and the same is said to have taken place there, the summer past. In other cases, the effect is, what is called a stroke of the sun, "coup du soleil," which is not always fatal, but very dangerous.</P>
<P>But the most general ill-effect of exposure to a hot sun, is, great debility, in consequence of the violent and unnatuaral ex∣citement; and this effect is most to be found in the nervous sys∣tem, when the heat has fallen directly on the head. Convales∣cents from bilious fevers have occasion to be particularly cautious, not to to expose themselves to a hot sun; a relapse is the most certain consequence.</P>
<P>The umbrella is an excellent invention; it would be still more excellent, if it could be improved, so as to render the shade more general, and completely interrupt the rays of the sun, with∣out being rendered too heavy.</P>
<P>In walking the streets of a city, in a clear hot day, the passen∣ger will naturally seek the shady side. Of so much importance is it thought, in some hot countries, to shield the body from the rays of the sun, that very discerning men contend that narrow streets and high houses, in cities, contribute to the health of the citizens, by mitigating the heat. They suppose the obstruction of air a less evil, than a hot sun. Of this opinion was Lan∣cisius.</P>
<P>But this is to embrace one evil, in shunning another. It is to be regretted that the best mode of shielding man from a hot sun, is not adopted in cities. Wide streets, bordered with rows of trees, would be infinitely preferable to all the artificial shades that can be invented. Trees are the coolers given to us by nature. They make a pleasant shade—they imbibe the septic fluids, which impregnate the atmosphere of cities, and poison their in∣habitants —they exhale pure air—they fan the earth, by creating
<PB N="235" REF="036687_0590_100AA55AC92EF3C0"/>
or augmenting currents of air, with the vibratory movement of their leaves—they invite the feathered tribe to light on their branch∣es, and with the music of their notes, to relieve the ear from the grating of rough, unnatural sounds, which stun the citizen.</P>
<P>It has been objected to trees, that they increase the danger of fire, by obstructing the free use of engines. This objection is im∣aginary. Few cases would occur, where trees, properly placed, could interfere with the operations of extinguishing fire; and in such cases, they might be levelled in a moment.</P>
<P>It has also been objected, that trees obstruct the free circulation of air. This is not true. In calm summer weather, they very much increase a light breeze, by partly obstructing the upper cur∣rent with their branches, and throwing more air below, thus augmenting the under current on the surface of the earth, where it is wanted. The leaves and branches also, by their gentle mo∣tion, agitate the air, preventing the ill effects of stagnation; and give velocity to the air that finds its way through their interstices.</P>
<P>"The streets and public squares of a city, says St. Pierre, should be planted with great trees of various sorts. A city, built of marble, would to me have a melancholy appearance, unless I could see in it trees and verdure."</P>
<BIBL>Studies of Nature, 13.</BIBL>
<P>Trees and all green vegetables diminish greatly the heat near the earth; and little do men in general think, how prejudicial to health is the operation of the extreme heat of cities.</P>
<P>It is not an uncommon thing in the country, where no mias∣mata exist, for laboring men to over heat themselves in the field, and die in six days, with a bilious fever; their bodies as yellow as saffron. This is yellow fever of a mild kind, generated in the system, by the debility occasioned by excessive heat and fa∣tigue, without any external cause. Thus the extreme heat of August and September 1798 will alone account for the unusual violence and extent of the pestilential fever of that year.</P>
<P>In the warm season, and especially in time of epidemic fevers, people should be doubly cautious not to expose their health by ex∣cessive fatigue. Labor should not be violent, and walking, mod∣erate. In extreme heat, the natural excitement of the system, is usually too great; and a small addition to it throws the body
<PB N="236" REF="036687_0591_100AA55D971921B8"/>
into a state of debility which invites disease. Not only health, but life, is often suspended on the point of half an hour's exer∣cise. Temperance in labor, bodily or mental, is as essential to good health, as in eating or drinking. The muscles and the nerves, those moving powers of the human body, if stimulated beyond a certain point, lose their excitability beyond the possi∣bility of recovery.</P>
<P>The danger incurred by sedentary and studious men, during pestilence, from the debilitating effects of their occupations, is greatly increased. Want of due exercise is directly relaxing to the solids; while application of the mind is apt to over-excite the nerves and induce indirect debility. The extreme irritabil∣ity of the nervous system, is obvious in a pestilential state of air. —I experienced it most sensibly in the summer of 1795, during the fever in New-York; and it is evidenced in the vertigo, so frequent at such times; in the seizure of many persons in the plague with apoplectic symptoms; and in the palsies and apo∣plexies which are greatly multiplied before or after the preva∣lence of a pestilence, and which in some places, have become almost epidemic.</P>
<P>During the rage of epidemic pestilence, also the animal ap∣petite should be indulged with moderation—excessive indulgence, which might have been sustained at other times, has often hur∣ried the young and sprightly, to a premature grave. Nothing can be more dangerous, according to all medical writers on this subject.</P>
<P>Celsus directs that in pestilence, persons should seek fresh air, travel, sail; or if these are not convenient, they should avoid fatigue, indigestion, cold, heat, excessive indulgence of the an∣imal desires; especially says the author, in a pestilence which is occasioned by southerly winds. Vol. 1. 40, 41.</P>
<P>These observations are not new; they are common and well known to medical men, and to all others of discernment. They are here inserted, because th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y may be, in this work, more gen∣erally read, than in medical books, which are opened only by professional men.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="036687_0592_100AA55F1E541D48"/>But all these rules, if strictly observed, will not, in a more violent plague, be sufficient to secure the body from attack. Such are the extremely debilitating qualities of the air, in some periods, that it will be necessary to counteract them by artificial powers positively tonic.</P>
<P>The application for this purpose, which is most easy and ef∣fectual, is <HI>water;</HI> an article which nature has furnished in the greatest abundance, because it is far the most useful. On this subject perhaps some of the following ideas may not be very common.</P>
<P>My attention to water, as a preventative of pestilence, was first excited by a passage in Volney's Travels in Egypt and Syria, chap. 17. where he informs us in a note that "at Cairo, it is observed, the water-carriers, continually wet with the fresh wa∣ter they carry in skins upon their backs, are never subject to the plague."—The author is there speaking of the pernicious effects of humidity on health; but the escape of the water-carriers, he ascribes to <HI>lotion,</HI> whose effects are different from those of mois∣ture by vapor.</P>
<P>If this fact is accurately stated, it is worth an empire. I am inclined to believe it and to ascribe the escape of those men to the constant application of water to their bodies, during the la∣bors of the day. Yet if true, why have not authors propagated the knowlege of so important a truth, to every part of the world? Is this neglect also the fruit of the pernicious errors res∣pecting the exclusive origin of the plague from infection? The calamities sustained by mankind, in consequence of those errors, exceed all calculation.</P>
<P>How is it possible, that, if a remedy for the calamity of pes∣tilence, is so obvious and so near at hand, the Egyptians should not have applied it universally? Can this be ascribed to the doc∣trin of predestination, which makes them careless of the means of prevention?</P>
<P>It is very certain that the laws of Moses, respecting the pro∣hibition of blood, fat, swine's flesh, and certain other animals; as also the whole system of ablutions, purifications, and use of perfumes, were intended to correct the evils of the climate; and
<PB N="238" REF="036687_0593_100AA561E0881830"/>
many of his directions became totally useless, when the Israelites left that country and its vicinity. Heaven never could intend some of the provisions of the Mosaic code, for more temperate and healthy climates.</P>
<P>The ancient Egyptians had similar practices, and probably long before the days of Moses. Their laws and customs to en∣sure cleanliness were very strict, and they involved a most liberal use of water. Herodotus expressly declares that "they scour their cups, wash their linen, and <HI>circumcise for the sake of clean∣liness.</HI> The priests bathe twice by day and twice by night, and are obliged to wear linen." Swine's flesh was also considered to be unclean and prohibited as an article of food.</P>
<BIBL>See Book 2. Euterpe.</BIBL>
<P>These regulations doubtless proceeded from the experience of their good effects. It is not improbable that the introduction of the Mahometan religion, may have been accompanied with the abolition or disuse of ancient practices, which were friendly to health. Certain it is, that the oriental nations make great use of baths; the original design of which was probably to guard a∣gainst diseases, but which have been abused and converted to the purposes of luxury.</P>
<P>Let us then pursue the idea of applying water as a panoply against the attacks of pestilence. By what means does water guard the body from that disease?</P>
<P>I have already quoted the observation of Dr. Priestley, to prove that water absorbs the septic acid. If this opinion is well founded, and I have no doubt of it, we have obtained a most essential item of knowlege. Fresh water frequently applied to the body receives and carries off all the matter of infection, thus removing <HI>one</HI> copious source of the disease.</P>
<P>Savary remarks, that pestiferous matter, passed through wa∣ter, will not communicate the distemper. This is a confirma∣tion of Dr. Priestley's principles.</P>
<P>The cessation of the plague in Egypt, on the inundation of the Nile, is no small evidence of the same principle. The wa∣ter changes the state of the air, both by absorption, that is, im∣bibing and carrying off the pestiferous sources of vapor from the earth; and by extricating a quantity of fresh air. And this
<PB N="239" REF="036687_0594_100AA5640F87E420"/>
important fact directs to the mode by which all gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cities are to prevent or lessen the force of this disease. What the Nile does once a year for Egypt, fresh streams of water should do every day, in the hot season, for all large towns—they <HI>should inundate the streets.</HI> Nature has given, in Egypt, the most an∣cient and the most common nursery of the plague, the <HI>model</HI> of the best remedy for the severest calamity incident to man; a model which few cities have been wise enough to copy.</P>
<P>But it will not be sufficient to trust wholly to the effect of a diffusion of water over a city. In the hot season, it should be applied to the body very frequently in the way of lotion or bath∣ing. By this I do not mean to recommend the practice of leap∣ing into river or sea-water, and continuing in it for half an hour —a practice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich proves fatal to many lives every summer. Cold water is the most powerfully debilitating application, that can be made to the body. No persons can bear it, even in summer, but the healthy and robust; and to save such from injury, it must not be applied when the body is over-heated, or continued too long. Many—many instances occur every year, in which a fa∣tal yellow fever is speedily induced by injudicious plunging. An instantaneous application of cool water to the body, by a single plunge, or by a shower bath, sometimes acts as a stimulant, by a sudden increase of excitability in the system; but this should be used as a remedy, under the direction of a physician. Few per∣sons can sustain the shock, unless in good health; and I am per∣suaded it would be as well for mankind, if the use of cold wa∣ter by plunging, were wholly proscribed. Judiciously applied, it is sometimes useful; but my own observations lead me to be∣lieve, the utility is more than overbalanced by its fatal or mis∣chievous effects.</P>
<P>The most safe, easy, pleasant and beneficial mode of using water, is, to bathe or wash the body in a private apartment at home. This may be done in several ways—either in a large ves∣sel immersing the whole body at once; or, what is less trouble∣some, with a single pail or bowl of water, in a bed chamber. The washing may be done with the hand, or a sponge, in a few minutes, as the person rises in the morning or retires, at night.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="036687_0595_100AA5665EABCA98"/>The temperature of the wate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> near that of the blood; a little cooler or a little warmer, and in such a temperature, it is a pleasant application, occasioning no violence to the system.</P>
<P>It may not be obvious to every common reader, that the ap∣plication of warm water to the surface of the body, in a hot day, should cool it. But such is the fact, and nature points out this mode of reducing the heat of the body, by the process of pers∣piration. In this process, the insensible vapor, which escapes by the perspiratory ducts, takes with it a portion of heat—and the more freely a person perspires, the more temperate, the heat of his body. Hence the human body is enabled to sustain heat, several degrees above that of the blood—and hence the flesh of a child, in full health perspiring freely, feels cooler than the air, in a summer's day. This phenomenon may be illustrated by a thermometer, with the utmost ease. Immerse the bulb into warm water, in a hot day. Let the water be of 75 degrees of heat and the air, of 80 degrees. The thermometer, standing at 75 deg. in the water, and taken out into a warmer medium, the air, ought to rise to 80 deg. but being wet, the evaporation will sink the mercury four or five degrees; that is to about 70 deg. until the instrument is dry, when it will rise to 80 deg. the temperature of the air.</P>
<P>On this principle warm water, as well as cool, will lessen the heat of the system; for no sooner does a person cease to apply the water, than evaporation commences and cools the body by several degrees. This effect however is temporary, in conse∣quence of the stimulus of the heat.</P>
<P>In very hot weather it is better, especially for <HI>persons in the vigor of health,</HI> to use water a little cooler, than the blood; for the effect of warm water, applied in the manner proposed, is to stimulate—and this is not what the body requires. On the con∣trary, when highly excited by the heat of the air, the body re∣quires a reduction of heat, to prevent over-excitement, and its effect, indirect debility. In general then the body in summer is to be cooled by the use of water, while in a healthy state; but if debility or disease has invaded it, it requires heat and excite∣ment.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="036687_0596_100AA567E543B410"/>Persons of a <HI>slender habit,</HI> who require additional stimulus, should use water a little warmer than the blood. The effect of cool water applied to persons in full health, and of warm water, to feeble habits, is the same; to <HI>prevent debility; indirect</HI> in the former case, and <HI>direct,</HI> in the latter.</P>
<P>Bathing a long time in very warm water, to produce profuse perspiration, is a powerful laxative; and perhaps it would be bet∣ter, if it was never used, except as a remedy for disease, under the direction of physicians.</P>
<P>The beneficial effects of the use of water, in pestilence, there∣fore, are these.—The poisonous particles composing infection, and exhalations of all kinds, are washed from the body, and their ill effects prevented—the morbid matter exhaled from the body by the perspiratory vessels, is also removed—an effect that may be aided by frequent changes of clean linen —The extreme vessels are stimulated and cleansed, by which means they are enabled to carry on more perfectly the excretions; perspiration being one of the principal resources of nature to expel the poison which enkindles the flame of pestilence.—The whole system is kept in equilibrio, by a diminution of excitement, in the robust, and an increase of it, in the debilitated; the consequence is, the sys∣tem is daily renewing its tone and vigor, the energy of the brain is preserved, the muscular fibres retain their powers, and all the functions of the body, the digestion, circulation, secretions, and evacuations, are regularly performed.</P>
<P>Medical gentlemen will excuse me for these ideas, which be∣long more properly to their province. They are not new to that description of citizens; but, if just, they ought to be universal∣ly known; for they lay the best foundation for a regular plan of economy, in domestic life, which will greatly alleviate the dis∣tresses of autumnal epidemics. I cannot help thinking that man∣kind are yet in their infancy, in this respect; and that in general they understand the true art of living, which shall secure health and happiness, as little as they understood agriculture or naval architecture, in the days of Henry the first.</P>
<P>I am persuaded that the whole art of securing ourselves from
<PB N="242" REF="036687_0597_100AA56A4508BA10"/>
pestilence, as I have before remarked, consists in this simple maxim—"preserve the natural energy of the system." That water, fresh and pure, is the instrument most efficacious for this purpose, I must believe, from reason and experiment. The fact related by Volney of the escape of the water-carriers, is of infi∣nite weight, if fairly stated; and demands immediate applica∣tion to our own case. At any rate, it demands investigation.</P>
<P>I have other proof of the success of water, used as I have prescribed. A friend of mine, who has lived many years in the West-Indies, who has seen the yellow fever in all its forms, who has tended the sick in that climate and in New-York, exposed himself to their breath and effluvia for days and nights successive∣ly and slept with his own son, when on his death-bed, with that disease, has hitherto escaped the infection. He ascribes this im∣punity to a daily use of water in the manner abovementioned.</P>
<P>We are not to calculate on the universal and invariable success of any remedy for this terrible calamity. Multitudes of men will not take the pains to use the means necessary to resist the ef∣fects of the numerous causes of disease which surround them. They will neither regulate their diet, nor cleanse their persons and habitations; and when to the influence of their own intem∣perance, and the poison generated in their houses and on their bodies, is added the debilitating operation of peculiar seasons and other causes which are above human control, great numbers of them must sink and perish.</P>
<P>Nor is it to be supposed that any human means can, in every case, guard life, in a pestilential state of air. If we admit <HI>de∣bility</HI> to be the universal proximate cause of the plague, we are not sure that our best efforts to obviate its effects will always suc∣ceed. We may not be able to find or to apply, in all cases and under all circumstances, the precise degree of stimulus, necessary to preserve the corporeal functions; and the variety of constitu∣tions, and diverse operations of the same remedies on different bodies, will defeat, in some cases, the most exact application of the best possible system.</P>
<P>Of one thing I am confident, that, in our cities as now con∣structed, no rigors of police can so effectually cleanse away the
<PB N="243" REF="036687_0598_100AA56D2BBFEBB0"/>
sources of poison, as to prevent a return of pestilence, without the universal introduction of a new domestic economy, and new modes of living. I am firmly persuaded that fruitful sources of the evil lie in these two articles—the excessive use of stimulant food and liquors, and the neglect of personal washing. The diet of the Americans, like that of the English, is of the most nourishing kind—a large portion of the best flesh meats, and high-seasoned fish and vegetables. Our drink is of the same character—the best high wines, spirits and brandy.</P>
<P>In winter, our bodies sustain this stimulant mode of living; the extreme cold continually resisting its effects by its debilitating powers. But when summer arrives, and the violent stimulus of heat, is added to the high stimulus of the best diet, two classes of men fall a sacrifice to violent fevers. First, men who push their stimulus beyond the powers of nature, by excessive exer∣tion, and imtemperance in eating and drinking—hence a robust man riots in debauch to day, and four days after is in his grave. Secondly, men who live freely in winter, and reduce their diet too low in summer, to avoid diseases, inducing a weak, languid state of the system.</P>
<P>It must be obvious to any person in America, that the French mode of living, in regard to diet, drink, and the liberal use of water, protects them from the epidemic diseases which prey up∣on the Americans, and British natives. Nor have I the least doubt, that a suitable regimen, pursued rigorously by the Euro∣peans, would have saved one half the people, who perished in the black pestilence in 1348.</P>
<P>Unfortunate souls! They believed the plague to be communi∣cated by infection only; they sought safety by flight; they em∣barked on board of vessels, and launched out upon the ocean, to <HI>escape infection;</HI> but all in vain; the disease attacked them in ev∣ery situation, and the world was almost dispeopled. Had they known that the distemper was induced solely by the debilitating qualities of the elements and the season, what multitudes would have applied the true remedy, and survived! Thanks to a kind providence, such a singularly depressing state of the air, rarely occurs, but when it does, there is no flight from the sources of dis∣ease,
<PB N="244" REF="036687_0599_100AA56F6EDDB228"/>
as in ordinary plagues, which arise in the impure atmosphere of cities only; but men must have recourse to the applications which resist the effects of debility, and maintain the energy of the system by supplying the defective powers of the elements, with artificial stimuli.</P>
<P>I cannot close this section, without a few remarks on the gen∣eral plan of building large towns.</P>
<P>The ancient mode of constructing cities bears some character∣istics of the age and taste of the nations, in which they were re∣spectively founded. Most of the old cities were evidently built with reference to a state of war and robbery; being intended for safety, rather than for convenience; as appears by their narrow streets and the projections of the upper stories of the houses. The more people could be crouded into a small space, the less military force was necessary to defend the town.</P>
<P>However this may be, those cities were very ill-constructed for the purposes of health. Savary asserts that 200 persons in Grand Cairo occupy less space than 30 in Paris. The streets are so narrow and full of people, that they jostle against each other, and sometimes a man is obliged to wait some minutes, before he can make his way. Letter 3. Yet this same author alleges the plague to be <HI>not native</HI> in Egypt! Surely a man of science need not go out of Cairo to look for causes of pestilence.</P>
<P>Many streets in Constantinople are narrow and crouded like those in Cairo.</P>
<P>The old city of London, before the <HI>fortunate</HI> conflagration of 1666, was in a like predicament; its streets narrow and almost closed above by the jutting of the upper stories of the houses. In the old streets, which escaped the fire, notwithstanding all the improvements of modern days, which have mitigated the violence of pestilential diseases, I am informed people are still infested with nervous and typhus fevers. London is however greatly in∣debted to the conflagration. In the present construction of the buildings, <HI>one</HI> person, it is said, occupies as much ground as <HI>two</HI> did before the fire. The size and arrangement of houses and apartments are also improved; and better adapted to a free circu∣lation of air. The introduction of fresh water may also be num∣bered
<PB N="245" REF="036687_0600_100AA5710E79FE60"/>
among the best preservatives from disease. These are a∣mong the causes of the non-appearance of the plague in modern London, and the diminution of the annual bills of mortality, within the last half century.</P>
<P>The plague however has disappeared in other cities of Europe, where no such improvements have been made—a curious fact, that will be hereafter considered.</P>
<P>But the disease continues to prevail occasionally in the eastern parts of Europe, in Hungary, Poland and Russia, which were severely ravaged in 1770, and 1771. The disease also raged at Oczakow, on the north border of the Euxine as late as the year 1739.</P>
<P>That part of Europe abounds with marshes and stagnant wa∣ter, and consists mostly of level land. This may account for the continuance of the plague, in that quarter.</P>
<P>The United States unfortunately contain similar sources of disease, in number and extent scarcely equalied. Yet instead of profiting by the severe distresses which all great cities have suffer∣ed once in fifteen or twenty years, from pestilence, and guarding against the artificial causes of it, our ancestors began and we are continuing to build cities, on t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Gothic plan, without more re∣gard to the lives and happiness of our citizens, than that which was manifested by the barbarians of antiquity. The moderns how∣ever proceed on the same plan from a different motive, which is, avarice. It is now the interest of the proprietors of lots in a city, to which all the pleasure of living, and the health of citi∣zens, are sacrificed.</P>
<P>We are precisely in the latitudes most favorable to the produc∣tion of pestilence. In the tropical climates, constant heat soon fits the human body to sustain it, and the <HI>natives</HI> of those climates are seldom affected by the furious rage of epidemic pestilential dis∣eases. Within the tropics <HI>strangers</HI> alone are sufferers by the climate.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Savary remarks "that the plague seldom reaches the polar circle and never passes the tropics. The caravans of Cairo, Damascus and Ispahan, which are sometimes infected, never propagate it at Mecea, and Yemen is safe from the plague." With few exceptions these observations are just. If the natives of cool regions pass suddenly into tropical cli∣mates, they are subject to violent fevers; but the reason assigned in the text is sufficient to account for the perpetual exemption of <HI>natives</HI> of hot climates from the worst form of pestilence. Their bodies mould them∣selves to the climate—their excitement or debility is always uniform. it is the great changes, in these respects, which expose people in the middle latitudes to the attacks of pestilential diseases.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="036687_0601_100AA5735207E010"/>But in the temperate latitudes, men are continually subject to the alternations of extreme heat and cold—changes hostile to the system. In winter, we may be said to be inhabitants of Lap∣land; in summer, of Mexico or the West-Indies. If we do not remove to the polar circles or to the tropics, yet the revolu∣tions of the seasons <HI>bring their climates to us;</HI> and we annually run a similar risk with the Europeans, who pass from the northern to the southern latitudes of <HI>perishing in multitudes.</HI></P>
<P>It is a most unquestionable fact that the northern states of A∣merica from New-York to Maine, are in a position on the globe, as exposed to the plague as the cities of Marseilles, Naples, Rome and Constantinople; and the southern states have a position cor∣responding with the latitude of Syria, the Barbary coast and E∣gypt; that portion of the earth which is <HI>most frequently</HI> ravaged with pestilential diseases.</P>
<P>If then we live in a climate in which the human body, from alternate heat and cold, is most irritable, and most subject to ma∣lignant autumnal distempers; and if a part of our country is pe∣culiarly adapted to the production of such diseases; the most se∣rious of all questions arises; what shall we do to prevent a fre∣quent return of such calamities?</P>
<P>To me, the path is extremely plain. Our climate we cannot change—much of our country cannot be raised into hills, nor drained of its stagnant waters—the laws of nature we are unable to control in the operation.—But <HI>our</HI> duty is plain. Men must not plant their habitations near marshy grounds—the mode of building cities <HI>must</HI> be totally changed—and so must the usual hab∣its of our citizens.</P>
<P>Throughout the whole Atlantic territory, on the low lands, it is more essential that large towns should be purposely construc∣ted for health.—Great cities are usually founded on commerce, and commerce requires the access of navigable water. Hence such towns are commonly near the sea shore or on the borders of rivers.—But if they are near low marshy grounds they cannot be
<PB N="247" REF="036687_0602_100AA5758DE1B218"/>
healthful. High and dry positions, with rocky or gravelly earth, are the proper places for populous cities, on account of fresh air and good water.</P>
<P>But in any sitation, our cities are too crouded for health or comfort. Lots are too small—too many people are crouded on to a little space of ground. A family to every lot of 25 or 30 feet by 80 or 100, connot fail to generate too much filth, and to vitiate the air in too great a degree, for the health of the citi∣zens. In every large town in the United States, however re∣mote from marsh, and however healthy its position, the effects of crouded population are obvious, every autumn, in the sickness and death of <HI>children.</HI> Multitudes and multitudes of lives are anually sacrificed, in all cities, to the avarice of the original proprietors of lots. The little narrow dirty houses, kitchens and yards surrounded with high fences, excluding air and veget∣ation; all that can dissipate or absorb the noxious exhalations; all that can purify the atmosphere and refresh the exhausted frame of a human being, panting beneath a sultry sun—every thing in our cities is contrived to <HI>waste the powers of life, and shorten its duration.</HI></P>
<P>Men, in this respect, are infinitely less sagacious than <HI>irrational</HI> animals. Instinct guides the beasts of the field to the most prop∣er habitations—and they never reside where they are <HI>annoyed.</HI> But man, with all his boasted reason, sees the effects of his fol∣ly, and hundreds and thousands of his fellow citizens falling vic∣tims to his own neglect, his mistakes or his sordid principles; he heaves a sigh in August and September, as he views the sable hearse, conveying his friends in scores to their graves; in No∣vember he shrugs his shoulders and says, <HI>it is all over;</HI> runs to the circus, the theatre and the card room; laughs away the win∣ter's evening with his jovial companions, some of whom are destined, the next season, to fall a sacrifice to the same folly and neglect, and to fill new ranges of graves by the side of the vic∣tims of the preceding year.</P>
<P>In the United States, every thing that has been done hitherto in the construction of cities, is in imitation of the old European and African mode, and of course is <HI>wrong.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="036687_0603_100AA5782800E3F8"/>The ancient construction of London cost that city nearly <HI>two hundred thousand</HI> lives in one century; and Cairo and Constanti∣nople probably lose more than that number, every half century. I firmly believe, and my belief is founded on the uniform ope∣ration of established laws of nature, that a <HI>perseverence in our pres∣ent mode of building cities, will doom them all to the same fate.</HI> I believe it, because I see no possible reason why pestilential diseases should not be as frequent and as fatal in America as in the old world, under the operation of similar local causes.</P>
<P>If a rigid police can be uniformly observed; and every possi∣ble nuisance be removed by shovels, brooms and water, cities in healthy positions, will escape the regular and constant return of malignant epidemics.—Multitudes of lives may be saved, and the loss of business prevented, by these means; and in cities al∣ready built, cleansing, washing and purifying, are the guardian angels of public health.</P>
<P>But I maintain that this is not exterminating the root of the evil. Cities <HI>may</HI> be built so as to unite all the utility of a town, with the salubrity and pleasures of the country, and in this new world, where men are as free to act as to think, it will be dis∣honorable not to invent and execute a plan for these purposes.</P>
<P>Were I called upon for a plan of a city, which should com∣bine in it the advantages of town and country, I should suggest the following as the outline:</P>
<P N="1">1. The position to be on the shore of the sea or the bank of a river, gently ascending with an angle of at least fifteen or twenty degrees; which would form a declivity for a rapid descent of wa∣ter to wash the city; at the same time, would not prevent the draft of heavy loads from the river or ocean.</P>
<P N="2">2. The wharves on the water should be extended beyond low water mark, that no part of the docks should be left bare by the recess of the tide. All the solid front of the wharves should be on a line; that no eddies might be formed; and the water might flow in a passing current. This would carry off substances thrown into the water, and contribute to keep the air pure by motion and change. Should it be necessary to extend wharfing in one place further than in another, it should be in the form of a bridge on piers.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="249" REF="036687_0604_100AA579D1A797A0"/>3. The warehouses on the wharves should not be jumbled to∣gether in a chaos; one projecting in front of another; but built in a strait range, at a suitable distance from the water; and an alley should pass between them for the admission of fresh air on every side. No wet cellars should be permitted.</P>
<P N="4">4. The streets should be strait, intersecting each other at right angles, and forming the city into squares of at least 500 feet on a side.</P>
<P N="5">5. The lots should be at least 60 feet wide, and 250 feet long. No more than 35 or at most 40 feet of the breadth of the lot to be ev∣er covered with buildings, so that a space of 20 or 25 feet should intervene between the houses. This space would leave a cartway, give free admission to air, and reduce the risk of fire 75 per cent.</P>
<P N="6">6. In the rear of the front building, out houses might cover 100 feet of the length of the lot. The remaining 150 feet should be laid out to the fancy of the owner in a garden—the po∣lice interfering no farther than to require by law that some kind of trees or vegetables should occupy the space—vegetation being the natural purifier of the air.</P>
<P N="7">7. Directly thro the center of each square, should run a nar∣row street of about 25 feet taken out of the rear of the lots, which street or alley should never be built on, but would admit a passage for citizens thro the squares; and what would be still more necessary and useful, would admit dust-carts to take up all the filth of the houses, from the rear, and prevent that intole∣rable nuisance, the depositing of offensive materials in the streets. The little flower gardens and shady lawns in these squares, would preserve the air pure, fresh and cool in summer—they would oc∣cupy many persons of delicate health, thus contributing to their comfort, diverting their minds, and in many cases, restoring them to health. Here also children would find room to gambol, without endangering their lives or annoying passengers in the streets; and here the young of both sexes would acquire a taste for gardening, for botany, and the delightful amusement of study∣ing the works of nature.</P>
<P N="8">8. The streets should be one hundred feet in breadth, and
<PB N="250" REF="036687_0605_100AA57B57899E98"/>
planted with three rows of trees. One row on each side next the foot walks, and a row in the center. The foot walks to be 15 feet wide. The trees next the walks would then be 15 feet from the houses; and a space between the center row and each side row, of 35 feet. The trees might be so pruned, as to prevent their injuring the buildings, and their distance would prevent their interfering with fire engines. These trees would be leafless in winter, when the sun is acceptable; and in summer would sweeten, purify and cool the air. The citizens at all times in the day, would walk in a refreshing shade—the center row of trees would furnish shade for horses.</P>
<P N="9">9. No city should be raised on level earth. If a natural po∣sition cannot be found, with a general declivity to the water, the streets should be thrown into artificial elevations of at least 3 feet in every hundred—five feet in the hundred would be better. This would give celerity to the water falling in showers, and wonderfully assist in removing filthy substances from the streets; for after all human efforts in sweeping, much offensive matter will remain, which water alone will reach and carry off.</P>
<P N="10">10. No pains should be spared to supply a city with fresh run∣ning water.</P>
<P>It is a point of infinite importance that citizens should not depend on water from pumps in the city. In a few years, the subterranean water becomes impregnated with the noxious parti∣cles from vaults—and this evil continues to increase with the age of the city. One of two remedies are to be provided—either the city must be supplied with fresh water by pipes from a distant source; or the vaults must be so formed as to be capable of being opened in winter and cleansed. But the last method, tho use∣ful and practised in some European cities, would be ineffectual.</P>
<P>The back houses in a city are, in many respects, a terrible nuisance. If a sewer could be carried four or five feet under ground, and every such house be set over it, a stream of water passing thro it from a distant source, would be an excellent means of cleansing a city from this source of disease. But such streams of water are rarely to be obtained.</P>
<P>Another expedient suggests itself for the same purpose. Let a sewer of three feet wide and well paved, be run in a strait
<PB N="251" REF="036687_0606_100AA57EB693B1E8"/>
line under the rear of the lots, and all back houses set over it. In suitable places, let channels be made to turn the water from the streets into the sewers, in long or violent showers, when the water is not wanted to wash the streets. In this manner, the sewers might be washed perfectly clean, a number of times every summer, and the citizens preserved from their poisonous exha∣lations.</P>
<P>On a model of this kind, I conceive cities should be con∣structed in the <HI>most healthy</HI> situations; for a crouded population, in any place on earth, will lessen the salubrity of the air. Close compact cities, in any quarter of the globe, are the graves of men. All the great cities of Europe require annually some thou∣sands of strangers to supply their waste of population. Yet there is no necessity for men to croud together in such a compact form. There is land enough on earth to suffer any extension of cities, and it makes little difference, in the first instance, whether a lot contains one hundred feet of land or half an acre. Nor would a less dense population be any inconvenience to men, in bu∣siness. They might be obliged to walk further on some occa∣sions; but in the cool shade of my proposed city, this would be a pleasure rather than a toil.</P>
<P>It is wrong, it is criminal, for legislatures to permit such crouded population. It is a nuisance, not only to cities, but to the public. It is a truth, that numbers of lives are sacrificed almost every year, among worthy country gentlemen, who have business in our large cities.</P>
<P>They come to town in the hot season, when no uncommon disease prevails among the citizens who are innured to the air— they come without suspicion—they are seized with fever and die. The air of the low grounds in our cities, even in healthy sea∣sons, is often poison to people from the country, and gives them a fever, when no epidemic is visible among citizens. I know the fact, and it is a serious calamity, especially to seamen. The low grounds in Providence, New-York, Baltimore, &amp;c. are great nuisances. The building of Water-street and Front-street in New-York, it is believed by good judges, has cost this city a thousand lives in five or six years. I say nothing of Philadel∣phia; for its position and the alterations in the original plan of
<PB N="252" REF="036687_0607_100AA580E301CEA8"/>
the city have doomed it to calamity. The citizens will not be∣lieve the evil to arise among themselves and therefore must be left to their fate. If remitting fevers <HI>every</HI> year, and yellow fever <HI>often,</HI> will not convince men that something is wrong in <HI>their</HI> city, it is in vain to reason with them. Of one thing I am con∣fident, that if all the earth in New-York on which Water and Front-streets are built, could be sunk 30 feet under water with∣out loss of lives, and the proprietors indemnified by the citizens, it would be the greatest blessing which heaven could in mercy bestow on the city and the state. I believe also, that if all the cross streets and the back houses in Philadelphia could be levelled with the earth, and the ground converted into flower gardens and grass plats, the citizens would, in twenty years, cel∣ebrate the anniversary of their destruction, with as much fervor as the republicans in France celebrate the demolition of the Bastile.</P>
<P>It is not possible, I speak it with zeal and confidence; it is not possible, under the operation of the <HI>present</HI> laws of nature, for men to be healthy in many of our cities, during the heat of summer. That open champaign country, which regularly pro∣duces intermitting and remitting fevers, will, when planted with populous cities, often produce the plague. Of that country, there is an extent in the United States, of more than one thou∣sand miles in length, and from 40 to 60 in breadth.</P>
<P>All the shore of the Atlantic from the Hudson north-eastward will admit of healthy cities. If the commercial towns on that portion of America were constructed on the foregoing plan, I would answer for it, that they would never be ravaged with yellow fever. Individual cases might occur; but the disease could not, without a miracle, become epidemic. But as our towns are now built they will at times be partially affected. In <HI>ordinary</HI> seasons and with a vigilant police they will escape, with the yearly loss of only ten, fifteen or perhaps fifty citizens, the unfortunate victims of the negligence, the folly, and the crouded population of cities. In very <HI>unfavorable seasons,</HI> the number of victims will be <HI>increased. Such is the fate of our northern cities.</HI></P>
<P>But the destiny of cities on the southern Atlantic shore, is to be more severe.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="036687_0608_100AA58269826760"/>The period of general contagion may subside, and intervals of more general public health, may be expected. The most un∣healthy parts of the earth enjoy such intervals, when the rage of malignant complaints is suspended. But the melancholy periods of epidemics will often recur—and as the plague, in all its shapes, is the offspring of <HI>causes,</HI> mankind, wherever those causes exist, are destined to be afflicted.</P>
<P>Away then with crouded cities—the 30 feet lots and alleys— the artificial reservoirs of filth—the hot beds of atmospheric poison. Such are our cities—they are great prisons, built with immense labor to breed infection and hurry mankind prematurely to the grave.</P>
<P>There is no necessity for this destruction of human life. Cit∣ies laid out on my plan would unite all the pleasures of country villages, rural seats, and commercial towns. The merchant, in his ordinary business, would enjoy the grateful shade of oaks and elms, with the luxuriant perfumes of odoriferous flowers. At the same time, this verdant city would supersede the use of sol∣itary country-seats in summer; and thus save the expense now in∣curred of possessing a town and country house. The country seat of a merchant, is a tax of ten, fifteen or twenty thousand dollars, paid to maintain the poison and pestilence of our present cities.</P>
<P>It is remarked by Boyle and other authors that China is rarely affected with the plague. The pestilence of 1347 is said to have commenced in that country; but it seems to be agreed that China and some other Asiatic countries are not often affected. This fact, if just, deserves investigation; in particular ought philoso∣phers to examin the nature and properties of the soil and the min∣eral productions.</P>
<P>China is a very populous country, filled with canals, and well cultivated. It is probable that the water in the canals is never stagnant, nor filled with vegetables—it is probable that the face of the country has been completely dried by cultivation, all swamps and moist grounds drained and covered with corn, rice and grass. How much these improvements have contributed to preserve its inhabitants from pestilence, I need not inform my readers.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="036687_0609_100AA584AB93D688"/>The cities also in China are vastly large and populou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and an enquiry will arise, how those cities escape the plague, if great population contributes so much to the calamity.</P>
<P>I answer, they do not escape all plagues—some of the most vi∣olent have ravaged China; but they probably escape the slighter plagues, which are the most frequent; and this is all that man∣kind can expect.</P>
<P>We are not sufficiently acquainted with the soil, climate, police and manners of China, to speak with certainty on this subject; but one fact ought to be mentioned. The Chinese houses have no windows in front, on the street, but in the rear, are spacious gardens filled with trees, vegetables, flowers, and fresh streams of water. Here the family is regaled and amused; the air is ren∣dered pure by cultivation, cleanliness, and the particles exhaled from growing plants, and water-falls. This arrangement alone will account for their exemption from the usual diseases of hot climates.—When the Americans, with their boasted light and science, shall become as <HI>wise</HI> as the Chinese, they may expect to share in the exemption.</P>
<P>It is a fact related by Russel and others, that in the midst of the Turkish cities, during a desolating plague, the spacious man∣sions of the wealthy Turks, which are kept clean, and well aired, often escape the disease.</P>
<P>I cannot leave this deeply interesting subject, without relating an anecdote from antiquity, which shows in what light wise men formerly viewed it.</P>
<P>In Greece, the countries of Attica and Lacedemon, consist of dry, gravelly or rocky land; and I can find but one instance, in which those countries were affected by pestilence, in the early ages. It is evident from Thucydides, that the plague had never been known in Athens before his time, since the date of the earliest traditions; and then it was probably induced principally by the croud of people collected in the siege, to escape the rava∣ges of the Lacedemonians.</P>
<P>Boeotia, on the contrary, was more frequently visited by pesti∣lence. To account for this, let us know what was the situation of this country. It is thus described.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="036687_0610_100AA586E595C7C8"/>Boeotia may be considered as a large bason, surrounded by mountains, the different chains of which are connected by high grounds. Most of the rivers from these hills unite in Lake Co∣pais, of fourteen leagues circumference, which has no apparent outlet; but, it was alleged by the ancients, to have subterrane∣an passages into the sea. The country is not without hills, but is mostly level, and very fruitful. The air in Attica is rema<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a∣bly pure; but in Boeotia, very dense; hence the ancients derived the heavy, phlegmatic character of its inhabitants from the air. This country seems to have been to Attica, what Holland now is to France.</P>
<BIBL>See Travels of Anacharsis, Ch. 34 and the authorities there cited.</BIBL>
<P>From several passages of history, it appears that Boeotia was more frequently visited by pestilence than Attica. This we should expect from the difference of their situations.</P>
<P>Justin, lib. 16. ca. 3. informs us, that the Boeotians once consulted the Delphic Oracle, how to remedy the plague that troubled them. The Oracle replied, "That they must plant a colony in the country of Pontus, sacred to Hercules." But they were so much attached to their own country, that they dis∣obeyed the injunction; until another calamity, war, drove them to consult the Oracle a second time, when, receiving a similar answer, a part of the people removed to the borders of the Eux∣ine, and founded the famous city of Heraclea.</P>
<P>This Oracle certainly understood the cause of the evil, and directed to a suitable remedy. The answer implies, "you must thin your population," or "you must seek a more salubrious cli∣mate," or it might comprehend both these ideas. The direction is full of wisdom, and is strictly applicable to many of our Amer∣ican cities. Translated into the language of our circumstances, it runs thus "thin your population, by spreading your citizens over a larger extent of ground, or you will often be driven from your cities, into the country."</P>
<P>We have Moses and the prophets, in books and experience, and if we will not listen to them, neither the Delphic Oracle, nor a messenger from the thousands of dead who have perished by the plagues of our cities, would induce belief or effect a reformation.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XVIII. Of the disappearance of the plague in some parts of Europe, and of new diseases.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a common remark that no plague has appeared in Eng∣land, since the year 1665, and that the disorder has ceased in the west of Europe, for near a century past. This happy ex∣emption from that horrible calamity has been ascribed to various causes. Many people ascribe it to health laws—a subject that has been already discussed. Some allege that the use of fossil coal has banished the plague from London; and Hoffman re∣lates that Halle in Germany, which used to be afflicted with malignant fevers, has been free from them since coal has been used as fuel. Others suppose that the great improvements in building and in the modes of living, in modern times, have been the means of preventing the return of pestilence.</P>
<P>On the first cause, I have already given my opinion, and the reasons on which it is founded. I find no sufficient evidence that health laws ever saved a country or city from pestilence, in a single instance; but abundant positive proof of their utter ineffi∣cacy, in a great number of cases.</P>
<P>With respect to the use of coal, we ought not to indulge very sanguine expectations. It may be true, that violent diseases be∣came more rare or wholly disappeared, in some places, about the time that coal became of general use as fuel. But let us ex∣amin facts, and not trust to general cursory observations.</P>
<P>The digging of coal at New-Castle for fuel commence<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> early as the year 1234, as appears by a charter of Henry III. and how much earlier, is not known. It was used in London as early as 1379, in considerable quantities; but when first in∣troduced, does not appear. In 1550, coal was in common use
<PB N="257" REF="036687_0612_100AA58B16DAE808"/>
in London—its price "twelve shillings a load." The price in 1590 was raised to "nine shillings a chaldron," which was deemed exorbitant. Thus far we have little light on the sub∣ject; but in 1615, the coal trade occupied four hundred ships; <HI>two hundred</HI> of which were employed between London and New-Castle. The present number is <HI>five hundred,</HI> and London con∣tains more than double the inhabitants it did at that time.</P>
<BIBL>See Anderson's Com. vol. 1. and Fleetwood's Chron.</BIBL>
<P>In 1615 then the use of coal must have been general in Lon∣don, and for some time before, for the growth of the trade must have been gradual. But for fifty years after this general use of coal, London was afflicted by the plague; the city indeed was rarely free from it, as appears by the bills of mortality, and three times, after that period, the city was ravaged by that dis∣temper as an epidemic, viz. in 1625, 1636 and 1665.</P>
<P>So far we have no encouragement to hope for a prevention of the plague by the use of coal. With respect to the city of Halle, I can say nothing. The observation of Hoffman may be just, and yet coal may have had no influence in checking the prevalence of pestilence.</P>
<P>It belongs to physicians to ascertain the effect of the vapor from this fossil substance on human health. Certain it is, that it occasions inconveniences to those who are not accustomed to it. So general was the prejudice against it, when first used in Lon∣don, that in the year 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>00, the nobility and citizens petitioned the king "to prohibit the further use of so noxious and un∣healthy a kind of fuel." And. Com. vol. 6. Ap. 935. There is reason to believe it is not very unhealthy, but I see no ground to suppose it has had the least influence in arresting the progress, or preventing the return of the plague.</P>
<P>To confirm this opinion, I would mention that the plague disappeared in France and other parts of Europe, about the time it did in England; in Paris, for instance, where no coal is used. In a great part of Europe therefore the same effect has taken place, without the supposed cause; which leaves us at liberty to reject that cause.</P>
<P>The third reason assigned for the cessation of the plague, viz.
<PB N="258" REF="036687_0613_100AA58D424B3C08"/>
improvements in building houses and cities, and in clothing, diet, the use of fresh water and the like, is a just one; and there can be no rational doubt that these alterations have contributed to mitigate the violence and restrain the progress, of many acute diseases. Pestilential epidemics are probably less frequent within the last century, at least in the more civilized and commercial parts of Europe, and also in America, than they had been in former periods.</P>
<P>The poverty, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, the dirty, crouded mud cottages, and the scanty supply of wholesome food, which was the common fare of the peasantry, in Europe, must have given origin or cur∣rency to many diseases; and greatly aggravated their severity. A sample of this may be seen in the early appearance of mortal diseases in the low narrow streets and small crouded apartments now occupied by the poorer people in our cities, and the difficulty of expelling a pestilential disease from such places.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following extracts will show the state of cities and of man∣ners, at the periods mentioned.</P>
<P>"Westminster and London were once above a mile asunder. The union with Scotland in 1603, did not a little conduce to make a union of London and Westminster; for the Scots greatly multiplying here, <HI>nested themselves about the court;</HI> so that the strand from the <HI>mud walls</HI> and <HI>thatched houses,</HI> acquired that perfection of buildings it now possesses."</P>
<BIBL><HI>And. Com. vol.</HI> 2. 285. <HI>from Howel.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Voltaire says, about the year 1500, "Industry had not yet changed those <HI>huts of wood</HI> and <HI>plaster,</HI> of which Paris was composed, into sump∣tuous palaces. London was still worse built, and peers of the realm carried their wives behind them on horse-back."</P>
<P>In 1504, when James IV. of Scotland was married to Margaret, daughter of Henry VII. of England, the princess made her public entry into Edinburgh, riding behind King James on a pillion.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Henry's Hist. Britain, vol.</HI> 6. 597.</BIBL>
<P>This <HI>princely</HI> custom is still preserved in New-England; where the common farmers live in better houses than many of the nobles, at the period above named.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>As a general remark it may be alleged with great probability that Europe has derived no small benefit, in regard to public health, from the following circumstances.</P>
<P>First. From the modern improvements in agriculture, by which means many places are dried and sweetened, which used to be cold, damp and fetid.</P>
<P>Agriculture not only removes, from the earth, substances po∣sitively noxious to health; but covers its surface with growing vegetables positively salubrious. This is one instance of multi∣tudes,
<PB N="259" REF="036687_0614_100AA5901125ADD0"/>
in the economy of the world, in which the happiness, com∣fort and interest of man are made to depend on his industry.</P>
<BIBL>See Dr. Rush's Works, vol. 1. p. 25.</BIBL>
<P>Secondly. Improvements in building houses may have con∣tributed to the same salutaray end. The materials are of a kind less susceptible of accumulating and retaining infectious exhalations, than formerly—the apartments are more spacious, elevated and airy.</P>
<P>Thirdly. Houses are less crouded than in ancient times, as appears by the proclamation of Queen Elizabeth, recited in the foregoing history. In London, one person, since the fire of 1666, is supposed to occupy as much space as two in the old city. This remark applies especially to the poor, who were formerly more numerous than at present. Some of the nobles, in the old city, had spacious gardens, but the mass of people were miserably poor and crouded into narrow filthy lodgings.</P>
<P>Fourthly. There is probably an immense difference in regard to general cleanliness, between the people even of the sixteenth century, and the present age. For this we are partly indebted to commerce, the source of wealth and refinement. A more gen∣eral use of linen and cotton in cloathing, articles which require washing frequently, may have contributed to the same object.</P>
<P>Fifthly. The introduction of pure water into cities from dis∣tant sources, and a liberal use of it, in houses, and the streets, have aided in the same salutary work of diminishing the calamities of disease.</P>
<P>Sixthly. It is believed that the modern diet is more friendly to health than that of former times. It is evident that to this change Europe is much indebted for the disappearance of scorbut∣ic complaints, which formerly were epidemic in Holland and other parts, and which still prevail in Iceland and Canada, where the poor live mostly on dried or salted fish, poor flesh meats, with a small portion of vegetables. The cultivation of the vine and the orchard has doubtless had a considerable effect. Cider and wine have assisted in preserving the body from debility in certain pestilential periods; and when temperately used, are of excel∣lent use.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="036687_0615_100AA592399B8730"/>But I apprehend that the moderns have ascribed too much to these causes. Any man who will read history with care, will ob∣serve that there has been, within about a century, a considerable abatement of pestilence in all parts of the world. The plague is far less destructive in the Levant, and Egypt, within 150 years, than it was in former ages. This mitigation has been cotemporary in all parts of the earth, of which we have any correct knowl∣edge. The cause of this change, I pretend not to assign; but a similar abatement has been observed in the violence of earthquakes.</P>
<P>While I admit however that the true plague has disappeared as an epidemic in many parts of Europe, I do not admit that <HI>pesti∣lence,</HI> in the general sense of the word, has wholly disappeared. If the true plague, technically so called, should never again occur in London or Paris, I should then say, that improvements in mod∣ern times may have <HI>mitigated the pestilence,</HI> but not that they have wholly banished it. Under this word pestilence, I include small-pox, anginas and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>techial fever, with other malignant disorders, which evidently depend on the same general cause as the real plague, operating with less force. These diseases still appear in all parts of Europe, and exhibit the <HI>existence of the pesti∣lential principle,</HI> altho improvements may have <HI>lessened</HI> and <HI>circum∣sc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ibed</HI> its effects.</P>
<P>I do not however consider it as certain that the true plague will not revisit all the western parts of Europe. A concurrence of causes, like that in 1348, might again produce that disease in France, England and Ireland, with all its horrors. But the probability is, that the modern improvements have removed so many of the <HI>local causes</HI> of disease, that no constitution of air will ever again produce the same mortality, as that under Vorti∣gern or that under Edward III; nor will the plague ever again be so frequent, as in former ages.</P>
<P>On this point however there is not sufficient ground to build any certain calculations, for the following reasons. Every phy∣sician and historian well knows that there have been frequent rev∣olutions or changes in the form of certain diseases—ordinary dis∣eases with new symptoms, and diseases before unknown, have appeared in various countries and in all periods.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="036687_0616_100AA593C50DBB50"/>The most remarkable of these are the small-pox, venereal dis∣ease, sweating sickness, Hungarian fever, petechial fever and an∣gina maligna, with some of less note.</P>
<P>I am not about to enter on the great question, when or how particular diseases have been introduced or modified in their symp∣toms. I suspect however there is a fallacy in the common theory about <HI>new</HI> diseases. What are usually called <HI>new</HI> are more prob∣ably nothing more than the changes that are made in former dis∣eases, by alterations in the atmosphere, climate, habits of living and a multitude of inferior causes. The small-pox and the venereal disease seem to have the best claim to the appellation of <HI>new;</HI> yet the fact of their being unknown before the periods as∣signed for their appearance, has been justly called in question. See <HI>note</HI> at the end of this Section.</P>
<P>Certain diseases however appear in particular countries, where they had not before been known, since the date of the earliest histories. Possibly some have been propagated by infection; others have evidently arisen from some general cause. Thus Pliny relates that the eliphantiasis was brought from Egypt into Italy, by Pompey's troops, but soon disappeared. It is said also that the same disease was propagated in the west of Europe by the Crusaders. Epidemic scurvy appeared in the maritime parts of Holland in 1556. The petechial fever which desolated Spain in 1557, and afterwards all Europe, was called a <HI>new</HI> disease, different from the usual purple fever, and said to be spread from the islands of the Levant through Italy to the west of Europe. The angina maligna, in Spain in 1610, was called there a <HI>new</HI> disease; and in England, where it appeared about fifty years ago, it has been called a new disease in that country.</P>
<P>But the real state of the question seems to be, that epidemic diseases, most or all of which proceed from qualities of the at∣mosphere, suffer general changes, in conformity with the revo∣lutions and alterations which take place in the physical world. A remarkable instance of this, was the sudor anglicus, which was, in its general symptoms, the plague; but some general cause in England first and afterwards on the continent, superadded a peculiar symptom, that of profuse discharges by the pores. This character of the disease, as has been well observed by the
<PB N="262" REF="036687_0617_100AA596242B75E0"/>
author of Traité de la peste, was the effect of a species of revo∣lution in the form of pestilence. Infection or contagion can have had no concern in producing this phenomenon. The dis∣ease maintained this peculiar character from 1483 to 1551, a period of almost 70 years, raging occasionally in most parts of Europe and then disappeared; at least it has never made consid∣erable ravages since that time.</P>
<P>This, in medical language, was a <HI>new</HI> disease, as demanding new modes of treatment; but in the language of philosophy, it was only a varied form of the same malady, and proceeding from a common cause, with the inguinal plague, but that cause in par∣ticular times and places, was modified in its operation. What confirms this idea is, that this sweating disease never appeared as an isolated epidemic, but was always cotemporary with the com∣mon plague in other countries—that is, it formed a part of the general effects of the pestilential principle. Thus in 1483, about the time of its first occurrence in England, all Europe was deso∣lated by the common plague. Denmark lost half its inhabitants, and many other countries fared very little better. The same may be observed of its subsequent returns, and of its prevalence in Ireland, Holland, France and Germany.</P>
<P>This is what I call a revolution in pestilence, and it will ap∣ply to many other changes in the predominant diseases of the human race.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It astonishes me to read in modern books the positive assertions, "that the plague is never generated in Great-Britain, or other north∣ern latitudes." See Mead, James' Medical Dictionary, Cullen, Ency∣clopedia and other original works and compilations without number. Lord Verulam, Sir Thomas Moore, Boyle, Erasmus, Diemerbroeck and other luminaries of former centuries, who saw the plague frequently in all its varieties, never pretended that the disease was not produced in their respective countries. The sudor anglicus, not only appeared <HI>first</HI> in England, but for the first time of its prevalence was confined to Englishmen. Yet this was the most violent and destructive form of the plague that ever has been known.</P>
<P>"Nuper novum pestilentiae genus immisit Deus, letiferum sudorem, quod <HI>a Britannis exortum,</HI> incredibili celeritate, per orbem longe lateque divagatum est—plurium exitio, summo terrore omnium."</P>
<BIBL><HI>Life of Erasmus,</HI> 347.</BIBL>
<P>How respectable writers can overlook such authorities is to me in∣explicable.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>Thus the petechial fever, which ravaged Europe in the six∣teenth century was called a <HI>new</HI> disease; but I conceive it to
<PB N="263" REF="036687_0618_100AA598DADBDAC0"/>
have been no more than a varied form of the common purple fever, induced by some general variation in the elemental cause of epidemics, or by the seasons. It formed a part of the pesti∣lential series, and was the precursor of the plague, as it is to this day, altho it has rarely been so general or fatal as about the year 1556 and from 1570 to 1576.</P>
<P>It is remarkable also that the general cause extended over the Atlantic, and gave the same character to the fevers of the West-Indies. The disease which reduced the forces of Sir Francis Drake at Carthagena, in 1586, was called <HI>calenture;</HI> a species of malignant spotted fever.</P>
<BIBL>Purchas, vol. 4. 1182.</BIBL>
<P>A similar fever infected the people under Sir Thomas Gates, bound to Virginia, in the beginning of the last century. And if Ulloa is correct in stating that the infectious yellow fever never appeared at Carthagena, till about the year 1730, we have a remarkable proof of a revolution in the diseases of that climate. We are to conclude from the facts, that the calenture was a distinct form of the pestilence incident to the country, till the beginning of the present century; since which, it has assumed the character of our bilious plague. I am however inclined to question the fact. The true yellow fever has been known in the English islands from their first settlement. It reduced Crom∣well's forces when they took Jamaica in 1655.</P>
<P>It is further to be observed that the true form of plague is never known in Spanish America. But at Quito, and other places, malignant distempers under the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me of <HI>spotted</HI> fevers, and pleurisies, sweep away prodigious numbers of people and fall but little short of the inguinal plague.</P>
<BIBL>Ulloa, vol. 1. 279—281.</BIBL>
<P>Such then is the pestilence of South-America; but in other periods, it may take a different form.</P>
<P>These observations also lead to an explanation of the phenom∣ena of the angina maligna. It was called a <HI>new</HI> disease in Spain and England, when it first appeared in 1610; but this is a mis∣take. It is evidently described as epidemic a century or two before those periods. But the truth is, <HI>that form</HI> of pestilence had disappeared for a long period and given way to some other
<PB N="264" REF="036687_0619_100AA59B10B09D10"/>
disease. After a time, it re-appeared, perhaps with some new symptoms.</P>
<P>The same remarks apply to the Hungarian fever, the peculiar symptoms of which first occurred in the sixteenth century; and to a multitude of local and temporary epidemics, which have been called, on account of some singular symptoms, <HI>new</HI> diseases.</P>
<P>These facts serve to explain my idea of the disappearance of the plague in certain parts of Europe. I consider the angina maligna as pestilence of the worst kind; and its occurrence in modern times, since the glandular plague is less frequent, may be only one of the revolutions in diseases of a malignant type, which have marked other periods. The destructive force of the pestilential principle, falls principally upon the throat, instead of the brain or the glands, and mostly upon youth. This may be the principal form of pestilence for a century or two, when it may disappear and give way to the common plague, or to some new combination of symptoms, which shall p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss for a <HI>new</HI> dis∣ease. A conjecture of this kind is authorized by several changes in the general characters of diseases, at particular periods of the world. I do not therefore consider it to be <HI>certain,</HI> that the parts of Europe, which have escaped the plague for a century, are secure of permanent exemption from that calamity.</P>
<P>This conjecture seems to be authorized by the evident mitiga∣tion of the plague in the Levant, within a century. Plagues, it has been before observed, are obviously less frequent and less severe, in Egypt and Turkey, than they were in former ages. This remark I believe to be new, but it is a fact; and this miti∣gation corresponds in time with the disappearance of the disease in the healthy parts of Europe. From this circumstance, I conclude that this change is the effect of some general cause, in the state of the elements.</P>
<P>This opinion may derive great strength, from revolutions or changes in the natural world, analagous to that in the character of epidemic diseases.</P>
<P>It is generally supposed by philosophers, that earthquakes are less frequent and violent, in modern days, that in the first cen∣turies after the Christian era, and the imperfect survey I have
<PB N="265" REF="036687_0620_100AA59CDA8ABD20"/>
taken of their history, gives me reason to believe the opinion well founded.</P>
<P>The eruption of volcanoes is very often suspended for a long period. Etna was quiet about forty-five years, at the beginning of the present century. The volcanic mountain in Teneriffe, which had been quiet ever since the year 1704, again discharg∣ed its fires in August last—after a suspension of ninety-four years. There are other volcanic mountains that have slumbered for ma∣ny centuries, as Lipari, near Sicily.</P>
<P>The aurora borealis has its revolutions. Sometimes it disap∣pears for half a century or more; then returns, and frequently illuminates the heavens.</P>
<P>The seasons, on a smaller scale, manifest analagous revolu∣tions. At certain periods, we have mild winters; very little frost and snow, with southerly winds, for a series of years. Then we have a number of long, severely cold winters in succes∣sion, with violent tempests, deep snow, and perpetual north wes∣terly winds. No less various are our summers, as to heat and moisture.</P>
<P>The vegetable kingdom exhibits similar changes, for which no visible cause can be assigned. When our ancestors first settled Massachusetts, they raised wheat on the eastern coast, in the countries of Plymouth, Middlesex and Essex; but in the year 1664 mildew appeared for the first time to injure that useful arti∣cle, and since that time, it has not been possible to raise wheat, within a considerable distance from the sea shore.</P>
<P>It is related by the French that wheat had not been known to mildew in France, until the year 1550.</P>
<BIBL>Van Helmont, p. 1093.</BIBL>
<P>In 1770, the potatoe plant, in a particular part of Scotland, was attacked by a disease which was <HI>new;</HI> and it has since been spreading. A similar fact is related of the oats in some parts of the same country, in 1775. These diseases, for they are really such among vegetables, are <HI>new,</HI> and as far as they extend, they are a serious calamity. They are the pestilences incident to veg∣etable life; which, like diseases among men, spring up and dis∣appear, without any certain causes which are within our compre∣hension.

It is customary to ascribe such phenomena to the <HI>sea∣sons;</HI> but it would be difficult to find any <HI>visible</HI> or <HI>comprehensible</HI> qualities in the particular seasons, producing such diseases among vegetables, which had not characterized innumerable seasons in former years, which produced <HI>no</HI> such effects.</P>
<P>The death of prim and black thorn in our country, is a simi∣lar phenomenon.</P>
<P>Sometimes a new species of tree will spring up spontaneously and gradually spread, where none ever grew before. The pine has thus introduced itself into Duxborough in Massachusetts, within the present century. Not twenty years ago, a man was living there who remembered the first white pine that ever grew in that town: but now one eighth part of the woodland is cov∣ered with it.</P>
<BIBL>Hist. Col. vol. 2. 5.</BIBL>
<P>The animal world displays similar changes and revolutions. We observe, not only uncommon numbers of common insects or small animals, in particular years, for which we can assign no specific cause; but we actually see certain new species of insects, and at times, known insects grow to an uncommon size. Instan∣ces of the latter phenomenon have occurred in the locusts, in the frog-kind, and in flies. The flies about Plymouth in 1633, and about New-London, the last summer, are described, as being not only distinguishable for their numbers, but for their size. Ancient authors have remarked the same phenomenon.</P>
<P>The millions of worms which spread over many hundred miles of territory in America in 1770, can no more be accounted for, than the sudor Anglicus, or any other new form of disease.</P>
<P>The insect, which about twenty years ago, first appeared among the wheat, on Staten-Island, and which has continued to multi∣ply, and essentially injure the crops, over a great extent of coun∣try, is unquestionably a non-descript as to America; a new form of animal life. Men are ever fond of propagating conjectures and vulgar tales for truth. The idle story which imported this insect from Germany, and gave it the name of Hessian fly, has been proved, by careful enquiries, to be mere conjecture; no such animal being known in Germany. Yet it has laid the foun∣dation of a durable error in natural history. So <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd are man∣kind
<PB N="267" REF="036687_0622_100AA59F2DF10450"/>
of this vulgar prejudice, of imputing all their evils to others, that even insects must, like plague, be imported!</P>
<P>This insect is doubtless a new species of animal; it is one of those varieties which nature is continually exhibiting, in the im∣mensity of her operations; it is a distemper incident to that par∣ticular plant, and others perhaps in a less degree, which, like the sudor anglicus may endure for half a century, and then disappear; or it may be derived, from permanent causes, and destined, for a longer time, to annoy that species of vegetable life, like the mildew on the same plant, on the maritime borders of Massachu∣setts and New-Hampshire. The mammoth of Siberia and A∣merica, whose enormous bones are seen in our museums, and whose race is supposed to be extinct, may be another instance of perpetual revolution in the works of nature.</P>
<P>The lofty pine, the glory of the forest, covers immense tracts of our native wilderness; but when cut down, is not propagated from the roots or stump, like most other trees. Yet I am told that in Carolina, whenever the lands are cleared of the native woods the young growth consists mostly of pines, tho far from any of that species of tree. Similar changes in the species of trees, are observed on the clearing of lands in other parts of America.</P>
<P>So also, on clearing our lands, in every part of America, the soil is soon covered with a full crop of white clover, of sponta∣neous origin.</P>
<P>These productions are usually ascribed to the seeds of the plant, scattered by birds, which lie inert, while covered with shade and leaves, and germinate on the access of the solar rays. This solution is conjectural; it is, like the importation of the fomes of epidemic diseases, founded on mere supposition; it is the re∣sort of careless, superficial observers, who will not take the pains to extend their views over the works of nature. Do birds con∣vey the <HI>seeds of pine</HI> and of <HI>clover</HI> and spread them over hundreds of miles of the wilderness? Have these seeds been all scattered within a few years? Or will the seeds endure the frost, the rain and the heat of ages, without perishing or germinating? Besides, birds feed on the seeds of other grasses and plants, as well as
<PB N="268" REF="036687_0623_100AA5A201FD4700"/>
those of white clover. Why are these not spead over our woods in the same manner?</P>
<P>The phenomena of the forests in America preclude the prob∣ability, or rather the possibility of such events. The new plants that spring up, are generated by new powers in the elements, oc∣casioned by different combinations of heat, moisture and air, in∣troduced by the labors of man; combinations which could not exist while the ground was clothed with trees of other species.</P>
<P>Plants are furnished with seeds for the purpose of propagation. This wise provision of a beneficent providence, is highly useful to man, and to animals which subsist on the seeds. But seeds are not necessary to the production of plants, in all climates. Every vegetable has some spot on the globe, where it is indigen∣ous, where it was originally produced without seed; and where it will best thrive, and grow to the highest state of perfection. Such was the origin of most of the plants now known to man. The principles of animal and vegetable life were cotemporary with the formation of the earth. New species are generated on∣ly by those gradual alterations visible in the operations of nature, or by accidental changes, induced by extrinsic and artificial causes.</P>
<P>Animals are also produced very often without any parent, but the elements. Hear what is recorded by that accurate observer, Dr. Lind, on the diseases of hot climates, p. 208. "It is a phenomenon incontestibly true, that in stagnating pools of water at Bombay, produced solely by the rains, and which have no communication with any river or the sea, living fish are generat∣ed; many persons have eaten of them. Upon the drying up of the pools, they die and frequently are very offensive."</P>
<P>I have not the least doubt of this fact; and it is on this prin∣ciple only that we can account for the existence of fish of various kinds, eels, &amp;c. in brooks and ponds, on the tops of hills, above impassible falls; and in lakes which have no outlet. And we prove the generation of such animals in the places where they exist, not only by the impracticability of their finding a passage to such situations; but by the fact, that many species of them are never found in salt water, and probably could not exist in it.
<PB N="269" REF="036687_0624_100AA5A40B000270"/>
Any person may be convinced of the utter impossibility of fish's making their way to the heads of many small streams, where they are found, by examining innumerable such streams on our moun∣tains, which are full of trout and other small fish, above perpen∣dicular falls among solid rocks, of 50 or 100 feet in height.</P>
<P>The truth is, the elements of air and water are fitted to pro∣duce animals of the kinds proper to subsist in them; and so are plants. Not a vegetable in the field is found without its worm, its fly or other insect, which it generates or feeds; and the ani∣mal when peculiar to a plant, has the color and the properties of that plant. Not a species of vegetable or animal matter, ex∣posed to a suitable degree of heat and moisture, which does not produce its insect. Even living animals are not an exception. Are not the large worms, formed in the human stomach, pos∣sessed of animal life? And are they produced by a germ deposit∣ed by an animal of the same kind? Not at all; the supposition is ridiculous. They are a disease, caused by the operation of heat and moisture, on substances in debilitated stomachs, which fail to perform the usual digestive functions.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is the common theory; some persons suppose them not a dis∣ease, but a part of the animal economy, necessary to full health. This however makes no difference, as to the manner of their production.</NOTE> All animals and plants have their diseases; and the mildew on wheat, and the scar on vines, are probably the effect of the defective energies of the elements, and a consequent defective process in the vegeta∣ble functions; or of infects which are the produce of the irregu∣lar operations of the elements.</P>
<P>In the year 1788 a horse was publicly exhibited in Philadel∣phia, with a living animal, of the worm species, in his eye. See Museum, vol. 3. 500. A worm of three inches in circumfer∣ence and 20 inches in length was found in the liver of Mrs. Holt of Philadelphia. Ibm. When these facts are known and acknowledged, will men still be found to deny the doctrin of e∣quivocal generation? Worms are often generated in the small ul∣cers on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he surface of the body produced by pestilence. Such is the power of excitement.</P>
<P>All creation is full of these varieties. Even the stellary re∣gions exhibit new stars, either stationary or revolving, which are
<PB N="270" REF="036687_0625_100AA5A5932B68E0"/>
visible for a longer or shorter time, and then recede from human view. Other luminous appearances, resembling a lamp, a spear, a beam, are often observed, for which we can assign no cause. The new stars may be revolving bodies, which appear to us only in a particular part of their orbits; but other singular celestial appearances are doubtless mere variations in the forms of the ele∣ment of fire.</P>
<P>The fish in the ocean are subject to the same revolutionary laws. They often abandon the banks where they have appeared for centuries, and appear in places where they were never before known. They are subject to epidemic maladies, as much as men or cattle; they often sicken and die, and sometimes it ap∣pears that the whole species, frequenting a particular bank, is suddenly extinguished.</P>
<P>The changes in the diseases of men; all the phenomena of ep∣idemics, in their origin and disappearance, their increased vio∣lence and novelty of symptoms, are the effects of similar altera∣tions in the elements which compose the system. We are but one species of animals, whose bodies are composed of the same materials, and subject to the same laws, as the bodies of all other animals. Animal and vegetable substances are also composed of the same elements, variously combined; they are simply varie∣ties in the forms of matter endowed with life. And the intel∣lectual endowments of man, with all his boasted pre-eminence, cannot exempt him from the operation of the general laws which govern every other form or combination of the elements.</P>

<HEAD>NOTE, On the Venereal Disease.</HEAD>
<P>I AM really surprised to observe with what pertinacious obsti∣nacy, men persist, in face of the most incontestible evidence, upon fathering great evils and calamities on others. The des∣cription of Adam's casting the blame of his sin on Eve, and Eve's charging the whole to Satan, had it been intended to il∣lustrate the practice of tracing diseases to a foreign country, could not have been a more exact representation of the fact, and of the disposition of men to shift off, not only crimes, but even moral and political evils, and cast them on their neighbors.

<P>The people in the north of Europe maintain most strenuously that the plague never originates in their countries. Mead even affirms that the measles, as well as small-pox, had its origin in Egypt.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Egypt declare that the plague does not originate in <HI>their</HI> country, but is always imported from the north, as Constantinople, Sm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>na, Greece or Syria; or from the Bar∣bary coast; and this silly notion is actually believed and circulat∣ed by most reputable travellers. The inhabitants of Constanti∣nople, I believe, admit that the plague <HI>may</HI> originate in that city; but it is believed by many persons that this disease does not originate there; and they trace it to Egypt. Many Europeans have adopted this opinion.</P>
<P>In Smyrna, Syria, Cyprus, and all parts of Europe, the plague is ascribed to foreign countries. In Algiers, Fez and all along the Barbary coast, the plague is held to be imported from Egypt or Constantinople: It is immaterial which; the great point being to shift off the origin upon neighbors.</P>
<P>Just so in America; it is not admitted by a great portion of people, that the climate can generate a pestilence. The yellow fever which is the plague of the country, is, in popular opinion, always imported from the West-Indies. When we go to the West-Indies and enquire for the origin of this disease, we are told very gravely, that it does not originate there; it comes from Siam and Bulam; and books are written by able physicians to prove the disease <HI>imported.</HI></P>
<P>If then we believe the opinion of the inhabitants of any given country, and their <HI>own story</HI> to be just, we shall prove that the plague and yellow fever are generated in no country on

My enquiry into the histories of these diseases, has demonstrated to my mind, that most pestilential diseases have originated, where they existed; and no one of them will spread or exist long, in an atmosphere in which it will not originate.</P>
<P>The small-pox does not usually spread without infection; but I can prove, by many instances, that it does originate, in spo∣radic cases, without infection. In South-America, it spreads and becomes epidemic, in certain periods, then totally disappears.</P>

<P>The venereal disease appears to be propagated solely by infec∣tion. It must however have originated at first without infection; and <HI>may</HI> still, for aught we know, originate in the same manner.</P>
<P>But the attempt of physicians to palm this disease on the na∣tives of America, is a most gross and abominable attack on truth, persevered in against the plainest and most indubitable evidence. In the annals of England, there is the clearest proof of the existence of that disease, in the twelfth century; and it was the subject of legal provisions as early as the year 1162, which laws are still extant, and were then only a renewal of those which <HI>were still more ancient.</HI></P>
<P>In the reco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds of the Lordship of Winchester, there are many regulations <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the stews which were authorized to be kept in Southwa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>; one of which expressly prohibits any "stew-holder to keep any woman, that hath the <HI>perilous infir∣mity of</HI> (Brenning) <HI>burning.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Burning</HI> is a modern orthography; the ancient was <HI>brent, brenning.</HI> So Chaucer wrote it.

<P>It is asserted by European authors that this disease was preva∣lent among the natives of America, when the Spaniards first visited the country. I cannot controvert the assertion, for I do not possess the original Spanish histories of their first voyages. But it is possible this may have been true. It is somewhat strange however, if that disease was formerly very prevalent among the natives, that in modern times, it should hardly be known among them. Ulloa, in his voyage to South-America, book 6, declares that the "venereal distemper is seldom known among the na∣tives," altho so common among the Spaniards as to have lost the infamy attached to it in other countries.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>These remarks on the origin of diseases proceed solely from my love of truth and sound philosophy.

<P>The following remark is of less consequence. The British Diction∣aries define the word <HI>Buccaniers</HI> by "Pirates of America or American Pirates." But names lead to error.

<P>The small-pox has been supposed to have originated in Egypt

or Arabia, and to have been propagated over the world by spe∣cific contagion.

<P>With respect to the origin of the lues venerea, we are left in the dark, as we are with respect to the small-pox. It is agreed on all hands that none of the Greek and Roman writers on med∣icin, have described the disease. But there is not a shadow of doubt that a species of this disease existed in England as early as the Norman conquest; and probably in the other countries of Europe. Not a medical work of that period, if any was writ∣ten in the west of Europe, has survived the ravages of time; and we are indebted to the legal establishment of stews in South∣wark, for the evidence of the existence of that disease.</P>
<P>It is however not at all improbable that about the year 1496, this disease might have acquired some new and malignant symp∣toms, and spread with a fatal rapidity, that might alarm man∣kind and render the distemper more an object of notice. An∣tecedent to that period, it might have been much more mild and less destructive. This idea is greatly strengthened by the known fact that other diseases had, about the same time undergone simi∣lar changes. It was but about ten years before, that the plague took the <HI>sweating</HI> form—an event as novel, as the generation of a new disease. What is more remarkable; in the very year assigned for the appearance of the lues venerea, an epidemic lep∣rosy overran Germany; an event equally novel. These facts confirm my ideas of certain revolutions in the symptoms of dis∣eases, corresponding with material changes in climate or modes of life.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION, Addressed to the learned Societies, in America, Europe and Asia.</HEAD>
<P>THE preceding history of Epidemic diseases was undertaken solely from a desire of investigating the truth, respecting the ori∣gin and phenomena of these terrible scourges of the human race. When the pestilence appeared in the United States in 1791 and 93, I had not a suspicion that the popular doctrins respecting con∣tagion, are not well founded. The frequent recurrence of the disease in subsequent years, in opposition to all the best efforts of health officers, in executing rigid laws of quarantine, had, in 1795, shaken my confidence in those doctrins. My investigations in that and the next year, convinced me that the pestilential fever which has visited so many parts of America, is generated in the country; but still I had not the least suspicion of a connection be∣tween epidemic diseases. The investigations of the year past, have resulted in unfolding p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nciples and facts to me altogether <HI>new</HI> and <HI>surprising;</HI> they cannot therefore be ascribed to a wish to establish a preconceived theory.</P>
<P>These results not only confirm my suspicions that the pestilence of America is of domestic origin, but they overthrow the pre∣conceived system of the origin of pestilence, in temperate lati∣tudes, from fomes conveyed to those climates from southern re∣gions; and demonstrate that it originates occasionally in all lat∣itudes from the 25th to the 65th.</P>
<P>It is demonstrated that pestilence, in temperate latitudes, is never an isolated epidemic, but the crisis of a series of epidemics; and we are furnished with the means of determining unequivo∣cally the character of pestilence in every case, on the following simple principles.</P>
<P>"If, on the appearance of pestilence in a particular place, all
<PB N="276" REF="036687_0631_100AA5B3ABE13B08"/>
other diseases cease, or take some of its predominant symptoms, that pestilence is generated in that place, and dependent on the state of the elements."</P>
<P>It is impossible, on physical laws, that this criterion should ever fail.</P>
<P>Another criterion, almost infallible, is the prevalence of cer∣tain diseases before and after the pestilence. If pestilence is im∣mediately preceded by measles, affections of the throat, inflam∣matory or typhus fevers with anomalous symptoms, and especially by catarrh, that pestilence is an epidemic, produced on the spot, and only the <HI>autumnal form of disease</HI>—the other diseases, prece∣ding and following, being the vernal and hybernal forms, produ∣ced by the same general principle.</P>
<P>Of the pestilences which afflict mankind, in all climates, an immense proportion, probably nineteen twentieths, belong to this species—they are epidemics, beginning and ending at the com∣mand of the elements, under the co-operating influence of sea∣sons and local causes.</P>
<P>These epidemic pestilences are more or less infectious, accord∣ing to their violence, or the places where they exist. In close rooms and narrow alleys they are dangerous; hence their mor∣tality in fleets, camps, jails, and particular parts of cities. But the infection of such diseases extends to the distance of a few feet only, and is capable of dissipation in a free air, so as to reduce the danger of attending the sick almost to nothing. The same is true of diseases of mere infection, not epidemic.</P>
<P>Diseases, dependent on infection only, are sometimes introdu∣ced into cities and hospitals, and occasion considerable mortality. But they are propagated by contact or near approach only, and do not affect the character of other diseases current in the place.</P>
<P>The consequence resulting from these principles is, that <HI>epi∣demic</HI> pestilence is not under human control—but diseases propa∣gated by mere infection may be arrested and subdued.</P>
<P>The only means of avoiding or mitigating epidemic pestilence are first to withdraw the aid of local causes; secondly to fit the body, by modes of living, to resist its causes—and thirdly, on failure of these, to remove from the place where its exists.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="036687_0632_100AA5B5E75AF768"/>The infection of all diseases, even those of specific contagion, as small-pox and measles, may be avoided by keeping at a dis∣tance from the diseased. The infection of diseases not specifi∣cally contagious, as plague, yellow-fever, dysentery and jail fe∣ver, may be nearly destroyed by free air, and cleanliness.</P>
<P>With respect to the primary causes of epidemic diseases, we are in the dark; but we are certain, from all history and modern observations, that the causes of epidemic diseases among the hu∣man race, affect every species of animal and vegetable life.</P>
<P>The opinions which I have suggested concerning the general cause, seem to have a foundation in the coincidence of epidemic diseases with numerous electrical phenomena. At the same time, the reader will consider these opinions rather as <HI>conjectural,</HI> than <HI>positive.</HI> No certain conclusions can be drawn from an in∣terrupted and imperfect series of facts. More materials are ne∣cessary to enable us to erect a theory of epidemics which shall de∣serve full confidence.</P>
<P>The common doctrin of contagion is utterly insufficient and unphilosophical; for if admitted, it never leads us nearer to the cause. If we trace the yellow fever to the West-Indies, and the plague to Egypt or Constantinople, we are not an inch nearer to the source; for these diseases are not always to be found in those countries; and the people there are as much puz∣zled to find the source of them, as the people of Great Britain or America.</P>
<P>If we trace these diseases to the coast of Africa, or to Siam, we are as distant as ever from the source; for many times, the diseases are not to be found in those countries, and seldom in∣deed are they ever found within the tropics, except among for∣eigners.</P>
<P>Indeed nothing is more common than for the yellow fever to be <HI>imported into the West-Indies in vessels from the United States.</HI> When vessels from northern latitudes have long passages, it of∣ten happens that seamen are seized with the disease, before they arrive at the islands; and the West-Indians may often allege the disease to be <HI>imported in such vessels, when it does not exist in the United States.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="278" REF="036687_0633_100AA5B76EF7E148"/>In short, the doctrin of deriving all pestilential diseases from contagion or infection, were it not for the immense mischief it does to society, would not deserve a serious refutation. Infec∣tion is a <HI>subordinate cause</HI> of the propagating of malignant distem∣pers; but is itself an <HI>effect</HI> of some more general cause, whose force is a hundred fold more powerful and formidable than that of infection. I have, in condescension to popular opinion, stated the evidence of the domestic origin of the bilious plague, as it stands on the arrival or non-arrival of vessels, and other facts of that kind. But I really consider all this evidence as trifling, when compared with the phenomena of the disease itself and its precursors and attendants. The uniform appearance of other epidemics, as introductory to pestilence, and manifesting an essential change in the atmosphere, with the numerous ac∣companiments of the plague and yellow fever, amounts to evi∣dence of domestic origin, which leaves no room for cavil or controversy.</P>
<P>For the purpose of collecting facts, the only safe foundation of principles, and comparing the phenomena of diseases and the elements, which occur nearly at the same time, in different coun∣tries, I sincerely wish and request that all medical and philo∣sophical societies would undertake to register facts and recipro∣cally to communicate them, by means of a general correspond∣ence. The facts to be registered might be comprized under the following heads.</P>
<P>The time of the appearance and disappearance of any epi∣demic disease, with its general history.</P>
<P>The places where it first occurs to be described, in regard to land and water, height of the land, construction of the city or streets, position as to points of compass, woods, morasses, &amp;c. The classes of people most generally affected.</P>
<P>The general state of the seasons, as to heat, and cold, drouth and moisture.</P>
<P>The time of earthquakes, meteors, lumen boreale, and all singular celestial appearances—with unusual tempests, especially when accompanied with hail—all compared with the lunar phe∣nomena.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="036687_0634_100AA5B9DAB2AFB0"/>The appearance of unusual insects of all kinds, and any cir∣cumstance attending them.</P>
<P>Diseases among cattle, sheep and other animals.</P>
<P>Sickness and death of fish of all kinds.</P>
<P>Volcanic eruptions, with the phenomena preceding, attending and following them.</P>
<P>For the purpose of ascertaining the lunar influence on the hu∣man body, or any diurnal influence, it would be desirable that medical gentlemen should note the days and the hours of the day when persons are seized with particular diseases—especially epidemics—the hours of exacerbation and of paroxisms in fever— the hours which are most fatal to the diseased—and the time when convalescents are most apt to relapse.—These facts should be compared with the position of the moon, in her orbit, and es∣pecially in regard to her perigee and apogee; conjunction and op∣position; as also with the tides in the main ocean.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The time of high and low water in rivers and bays may not be the true time, in the open sea—or of the greatest and least influence of the moon.</NOTE></P>
<P>Should the principles unfolded in the preceding work prove to be well founded, they will lead to many important practical in∣ferences.</P>
<P N="1">I. If pestilential fevers never appear in the temperate latitudes, without certain precursors, men will, with careful observations, be enabled to foresee the danger and prepare for it; or to use un∣common diligence in removing the subordinate local causes.</P>
<P N="2">II. If in certain years pestilential fevers are more predominant, than in others; and the condition of the elements fitted to pro∣duce them, is universal over sea and land, the fact is of no small moment in maritime affairs. Double precautions will be taken in fleets, and in merchantmen bound on long voyages.</P>
<P N="3">III. If pestilence is progressive and first manifested in certain malignant fevers, the fact may be of great utility to large cities. The approach may be perceived in time to save the inhabitants by flight, if not by other precautions.</P>
<P N="4">IV. If no plague or yellow fever ever appeared in temperate climates, unless announced by other distempers, the magistracy may be enabled to distinguish when there is danger, and when
<PB N="280" REF="036687_0635_100AA5BC7B947CB8"/>
not; and may avoid innumerable vexations to commerce, arising from the rigid execution of health laws, when there is not the least occasion.</P>
<P N="5">V. But a most important use to be made of the facts here col∣lected, will be, to guard public health from the ill effects of bad provisions. If, in pestilential periods, salt is less efficacious in preserving flesh, and by means of a greater fermentation of the juices, fish and flesh are more readily dissolved by a putre∣factive process, more caution will be found necessary in packing and repacking them, and more care to avoid using it in a bad state.</P>
<P>If the effluvia of dissolving flesh and vegetables are more poi∣sonous and prejudicial to health at some times, than at others, it is of importance that, on every such occasion, early notice should be given of the danger.</P>
<P>If animals, which constitute a part of the food of men, are subject to epidemic distempers, they cannot be eaten with safety, while affected by disease. When fish or fowls are sickly and many of them die, or become lean, the fact should be ascertained by the faculty or a board of health, and public notice should be given, that people might avoid using them as food. In some instances, fish are so sickly as to excite nausea; in which case the use of them should be forbidden.</P>
<P>I will close this treatise with the following reflections.</P>
<P>In the construction of the universe, we observe every part of the system to be governed by uniform laws, adapted, with infi∣nite skill, to preserve harmony and order. Limited as our un∣derstandings are, we can discover many of these laws, which are calculated to impress on our minds the most sublime ideas of the universal intelligence and wisdom of their Great Author.</P>
<P>The existence of natural and moral evils has led sceptics to question the perfections of the author of nature. But doubts on this subject argue want of knowlege or want of candor. It is extremely evident that all the necessary evils of the system are calculated to produce good. The operation of that universal principle of light, heat and fire, which pervades our system, and which is incessantly compounding and decompounding the other more sluggish materials of the earth and atmosphere, are essen∣tial
<PB N="281" REF="036687_0636_100AA5BEA1795600"/>
to the vicissitudes of the seasons, rain, snow, hail and dew, which are necessary to preserve the principles of animal and vegetable life. Storms, hurricanes, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, however inconvenient to men at particular times and places, are among the means of giving to the principles of life, more equal distribution, and of renewing their energies.</P>
<P>Epidemic diseases are some of the necessary effects of the gen∣eral laws that govern the universe. But they have also a final cause of immense value to the human race. They are destined and calculated to answer most important moral and religious purposes.</P>
<P>Men, with their present nature, under a constant course of prosperity, would degenerate into devils or brutes. Uninter∣rupted ease and quiet contract the heart and steel it against emo∣tions of sensibility—the man rushes into vices and crimes, or sinks into sloth. So often have I seen the hearts of men depraved and their moral character debased, by sudden prosperity, that I am persuaded the world, without frequent inflictions of pain and distress, would not be habitable. The natural evils that surround us, intermingled with innumerable blessings, preserve the mind in perpetual vigor, in seeking the means of protection; they lay the foundation for the exercise of the finest feelings of the human heart, <HI>compassion and benevolence,</HI> which are the sources of social virtue; they humble the pride and arrogance of man, by cre∣ating in his mind a perpetual dependance on divine power; in short, they create and preserve that sense of obligation and ac∣countability to God which is the germ of piety, and moral ex∣cellence.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Lunar Influence.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a well known fact that the moon has a great influence on the elements of this globe, the effects of which are very visible in the vicissitudes of weather. This influence is supposed to be the principal regulator of the tides, and the efficient cause of the changes in the atmosphere, which produce rain, hail, snow and wind. It is believed also to affect the growth of plants, and Pliny, followed by St. Pierre, alleges that the lunar rays dissolve snow and ice. Popular opinion considers the moon as exerting a powerful influence on animal substances, and it is an incontrover∣tible fact that its beams accelerate the putrefaction of flesh and fish. Fishermen and sailors can all attest this fact, and it coincides with what Pliny asserts. Nat. Hist. lib. 2. 101. "Id man∣ifestum esse, quod ferarum occisa corpora in tabem viso suo resol∣vat."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">St. Pierre affirms that the moon melts ice, and relies on the passage of Pliny in the chapter cited, "glaciem refundat"—but it is questionable whether the passage will bear that construction; and if it will, the as∣sertion of Pliny is not supported by modern observations. See Studies of Nature, Vol. 1. Expl. of the plates, p. 69. Ice is diminished by evaporation in moon light, without forming water.</NOTE> Moon light dissolves or corrupts the flesh of animals that are killed; it renders sound fish soft in a few hours, and fishermen are careful to cover from its rays the fish they have caught. It probably acts upon flesh by stimilus, exciting a fermentation in the juices.</P>
<P>The Newtonian theory of tides, which explains the phenom∣ena by lunar attraction, has been recently called in question and warmly opposed by the ingenious St. Pierre, in his studies of na∣ture, who substitutes a scheme of his own, which ascribes the tides to the diurnal effusions of the polar ices. I am charmed with the writings of St. Pierre, which have opened a
<PB N="283" REF="036687_0638_100AA5C26E1512C8"/>
new and entertaining volume of the works of nature. But his theory of tides seems to manifest none of that ingenuity, which is conspicuous in other parts of his writings, and is utterly un∣satisfactory.</P>
<P>In the first place, during six months or more, in each polar region, no snow or ice is melted, unless by the moon. The sun is below the horizon, and the moon's influence, if it dissolves snow and ice according to Pliny, evaporates all the water pro∣duced. This is a fact that accords with modern experiments, that ice in the night, however cold, loses a part of its weight, but it is by insensible evaporation.</P>
<P>To remove this difficulty, St. Pierre supposes the tides in one polar region to be the effect of the melting of snow and ice, in the opposite polar regions. But to this hypothesis we may oppose an insuperable objection, derived from the great and universal laws of equilibrium, observed by water. A diurnal wave or ele∣vation would inevitably subside into a level, before it could reach the equator, or even the temperate latitudes. Besides the Atlan∣tic is of very various breadth, in different latitudes. Between the coast of Brazil and Terra Firma on one side and Africa on the other, the breadth is scarcely half as great, as in the latitude of 25 deg. north. A diurnal wave compressed and dilated, in these different situations, must exhibit the tides in one place, twice as high as in another; but in the regions mentioned, this is not the fact.</P>
<P>There are many of the phenomena of the tides which cannot be explained on St. Pierre's hypothesis; but the foregoing re∣marks are sufficient for my present purpose. The tides doubtless depend on lunar and solar influence; but the phenomena cannot be solved on the common theory of <HI>attraction.</HI> In this respect, I am confident the Newtonian theory, as explained by Kepler and others is as inadequate, as that of St. Pierre. The latter author has enumerated some insuperable objections to that theory, to which the reader is referred. But I have other observations to make on this subject, which are probably new.</P>
<P>The manner in which astronomers have attempted to explain the opposite tides, is as follows. "The power of gravity dimin∣ishes as the square of the distance increases—therefore the waters
<PB N="284" REF="036687_0639_100AA5C5C9A9E468"/>
on the side of the earth next to the moon, are more attracted than the central parts of the earth; and the central parts are more attracted by the moon than the waters on the opposite side of the earth—therefore the distance between the earth's center and the waters on its surface, under and opposite to the moon, will be increased. The earth by its gravity falls towards the moon —the water directly below the moon rises and swells towards her —the water on the opposite side recedes from the center and ri∣ses— or strictly speaking, the center recedes from the water. On the sides of the earth between the points under and opposite to the moon, the water is depressed and falls below the former level."</P>
<BIBL>See Fergusons's Astronony, on the Tides, and Encyclopedia, Art. Astronomy, 363.</BIBL>
<P>As I am not about engaging in astronomical or mathematical calculations, I shall content myself with stating these general prin∣ciples of Newton, Kepler, and later astronomers, with a few objections.</P>
<P N="1">I. This theory does not explain, in a satisfactory manner, the reason why there are no tides in lakes and Mediterranean seas.</P>
<P>If the principle is just, that the earth recedes from the water opposite to the moon, leaving the surface of it at a greater dis∣tance from the center, why, when the Euxine or Mediterranean is opposite to the moon, does not the earth beneath these seas, re∣cede from <HI>their</HI> waters, as well as from the waters of the ocean, in the same longitude? The earth consists of solid substances, and by the laws of attraction, must, in all its parts, be moved equal∣ly, under the same circumstances of distance from the attracting body and density, or solid contents. To suppose the earth, when covered by an ocean, to be attracted by the moon, and not when covered by a lake or arm of the ocean, is, in my view, neither logic nor philosophy.</P>
<P>Nor is the reason assigned for the defect of tides in lakes and seas, on the side next to the moon, in the least satisfactory. It is found in the Encyclopedia in these words. "There are no tides in lakes because they are generally so small, that when the moon is vertical she attracts every part of them alike, and therefore by rendering all the water equally light, no part of it can be raised higher than another."</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="036687_0640_100AA5C7507BCD88"/>But this explanation does not meet the difficulty. The New∣tonian theory stands on the hypothesis that the waters on the side of the earth next to the moon, are more strongly attracted than the adjacent land; therefore they rise above several feet of the earth. But the solution above recited does not reach this point; for the waters of the ocean rise <HI>higher</HI> than the contiguous earth; but the waters of lakes always observe the same relative altitude on their shores. If then the moon attracts the waters of lakes at all, or occasions them to rise, it attracts the adjoining earth and raises it in the same degree as the waters; but in regard to the ocean, it attracts the water and leaves the contiguous earth behind. In short, if attraction and gravity have uniform laws, as we must believe they have, the attraction of the moon will not account for tides in the ocean, while there are none in lakes and inland seas.</P>
<P N="2">II. If the moon's attraction is the cause of tides, why is its force much less in the equatorial regions, than in the distant parts of the globe? It is a well known fact, that the tides within the tropics are very small, and that they are more con∣siderable as we recede from the equator towards the poles. This is contrary to what ought to be the case, on the principles of at∣traction; for on the Newtonian theory of gravity, the highest tides should be on the parts of the earth nearest to the moon. The reverse of this is the case, and the circumpolar regions of the earth have the highest tides. The tides within the tropics are from 12 to 24 inches—in the latitude of Greenland, al∣most as many feet.</P>
<P N="3">III. The theory of Newton is not reconcileable with his own principles of gravity, which suppose the force of it to be equal to the quantity of matter contained in bodies. Now the theory implies that on the side of the earth next to the moon, the water is attracted <HI>more</HI> than the earth; but on the opposite side, <HI>less.</HI> This cannot be solved on the principle of <HI>distance;</HI> for this is too small to account for a hundredth part of the effect. Indeed the water and the land on the shore, may be considered as at the same distance.</P>
<P>Nor can it be solved on the principle of a difference in the quantity of matter, in earth and water. If the earth, having
<PB N="286" REF="036687_0641_100AA5C95E0977E8"/>
more density and matter, is most attracted, the principle must act uniformly on both sides of the earth—on both sides, the earth must move towards the moon further than the water, which is contrary to fact.</P>
<P>If the water has most matter, the same principle must govern it on both sides of the earth, and move it farthest towards the moon.</P>
<P>But here the principles of cohesion interfere with all these deductions. These principles are so powerful, as to overcome the attraction of a distant body, nor is it to be supposed that the power of the moon overcomes the force of cohesion, and by attracting the parts of the earth next to it more than the parts on the opposite side, changes the form of the earth from a sphere to a spheroid. It is not supposed that the whole solid mass of the earth is continually changing its figure by means of lunar attrac∣tion. If so, this figure must be rotatory.</P>
<P>The theory then supposes that on the side next to the moon, the water is most strongly attracted and rises above the earth— but on the side opposite, it is attracted less than the earth. The solid globe is moved towards the moon, and the water left lag∣ging behind! What is more singular, the earth near the equa∣tor, on the side opposite, is drawn only two feet further towards the moon than the water, or perhaps but one foot; while in the temperate latitudes, it is drawn six or eight feet, and in the lat∣itudes of 60 and 70 degrees, fifteen, eighteen, and twenty-five feet further than th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> water. This may be philosophy, but to me it is utterly unintelligible!</P>
<P>Nothing is a more serious misfortune to science, than the er∣rors of a great man. Most of mankind take principles and facts upon trust, and defend them with a zeal proportioned to their confidence in the man who has published them. I revere the character of Newton, of Kepler and of Haller; but this vene∣ration does not in the least incline me to receive their doctrins without being convinced that they are well founded. After most careful investigation, I am satisfied, that the principles of at∣traction, will not account for the tides opposite to the moon, nor for the difference between the height of the tides in differ∣ent
<PB N="287" REF="036687_0642_100AA5CB0D616658"/>
latitudes. Yet I have not the least doubt, that most of the phenomena of tides are regulated by the moon.</P>
<P>If I was asked, on what principles the tides depend, my an∣swer would be, <HI>I do not know.</HI> But numerous facts, all con∣curring to the same point, lead me to <HI>suspect</HI> the vibrations of the ocean to depend on electricity, influenced by the moon, the sun, or other distant orbs, and acting by repulsion as well as at∣traction; or by increasing and diminishing the elasticity of the water.</P>
<P>In the first place, it is agreed among philosophers, that the air, when free from vapor, is an electric; that when cold, it is most electric, and when heated, it becomes a conductor; and consequently that the atmosphere in the torrid zone is always in a conducting state, while the air of the northern regions, if clear, is an electric. In short, it is agreed that the atmosphere of the temperate and frigid zones contains more electricity, than that of the torrid zone.</P>
<P>These facts correspond with the phenomena of tides. In the regions, where there is the least electricity, there is the least intumescence of the ocean—those are the equatorial regions. There, the temperature of the air also sustains very small varia∣tions; so does the height of the ocean. As we recede from the equator cold and electricity increase; so does the elevation of the tides.</P>
<P>Again, the same train of phenomena attend the barometer. Within the tropics, the variations of the mercury in this in∣strument, are very small; but in the temperate and cold regions, they are more considerable, and increase as we recede from a warm to a cold and electric atmosphere.</P>
<P>Similar phenomena attend the twilight. Within the tropics, the twilight is of much less duration, than in cold regions. "Heat, say philosophers, diminishes the air's refractive power and density, and cold increases both. The horizontal refrac∣tions are near one third less at the equator, than at Paris."</P>
<BIBL>Ferguson's Astron. 97.</BIBL>
<P>The density of the atmosphere, within the tropics, may be less than at the polar circle; but the weight is nearly the same, the barometer being in general as high at the equator, as in north∣ern
<PB N="288" REF="036687_0643_100AA5CE78945830"/>
latitudes. But the air, in hot climates, has less powers of refraction; that is, there is more power of refraction in an at∣mosphere that is most perfectly electric, or that contains most electricity.</P>
<P>It is remarkable also that, in equatorial climates, the atmos∣phere exhibits no visible streams of electricity; as it does in the polar circles.</P>
<P>I know not how far this parallel may be extended; but there is a surprising resemblance between all these phenomena. In general then we observe that in the equatorial regions, the den∣sity, weight, elasticity and temperature of the atmosphere, are more nearly uniform, than in northern climates; and the eleva∣tion of the ocean in tides corresponds with this uniformity. As we recede from the equator, the variations of the atmosphere increase, and so do the variations in the height and depression of the water.</P>
<P>From these phenomena a suspicion arises, that the medium by which the moon and sun act upon the ocean, is the electrical fluid; as their influence appears to be in proportion to the elec∣tricity of the atmosphere. Hence the highest tides at a distance from the equator, where the heat and cold and elasticity of the air are subject to great variations.</P>
<P>By what law, it will be asked, is this effect produced? I readily confess my ignorance. But the phenomena of opposite tides seem to bear a great affinity to the well known laws of electricity, <HI>attraction</HI> and <HI>repulsion,</HI> and a <HI>positive</HI> and <HI>negative</HI> state. I pretend not to account for the phenomena, for I am persuaded that the experiments on electricity which man is ca∣pable of making, will never unfold <HI>all</HI> its properties, nor explain <HI>all</HI> the laws by which this energy of nature is exerted in the government of the material system.</P>
<P>But the influence of the planets on the elements of this globe has, in all ages, been a subject of belief or of derision; and surely it is a subject in physics much more interesting to man, than many speculative questions which cannot affect his health and happiness, but which occupy the labors of investigating minds. I will therefore throw together a few observations
<PB N="289" REF="036687_0644_100AA5D001CB2AE0"/>
which may afford light on the subject; or at least may excite a spirit of enquiry.</P>
<P>In the first place, it is generally known and admitted that the influence of the sun and moon upon this globe are in proportion to their proximity. The highest tides are when the moon is in her perigee, and in conjunction with the sun, and especially when the earth is in her perihelion, or nearest to the sun. But the moon exerts more than usual influence on the atmosphere, in other positions. Her power is greatest in her perigee and apo∣gee, and in her conjunction and opposition to the sun. Her in∣fluence on the tides, under the combined and separate operations of these circumstances, has been fully illustrated. But her in∣fluence on vegetation, on the vicissitudes of weather, on health, and the phenomena of the electrical fluid in earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, seems to have passed unobserved, or at least, to have never been reduced to any thing like system.</P>
<P>One of the most striking effects of lunar influence, is observ∣able in earthquakes, which usually happen near the time of the moon's perigee or apogee, conjunction or opposition. As this fact seems to have escaped observation, I will here insert proof of it.</P>
<P>The great earthquake which demolished Lima on the 28th day of October 1746, happened six hours before the full moon, and the day before her apogee.</P>
<P>That which destroyed Lisbon Nov. 1, 1755, was three days before the change and four before her perigee.</P>
<P>The great shock in America on the 18th of the same month was a few hours after the full moon, on the day of her apogee.</P>
<P>The great earthquake in America on the 2d of June O. S. 1638 was on the day after the new moon and near her perigee. [Some accounts place this on the first of the month, in which case it was the same day with the change.]</P>
<P>The shock which convulsed America, and demolished moun∣tains in Canada January 26th O. S. 1663, was on the day pre∣ceding the new moon.</P>
<P>The great earthquake in South-America, June 3d O. S. 1744 was four days after the new moon.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="036687_0645_100AA5D18A7E5338"/>The memorable earthquake in North-America on the 29th of October O. S. 1727, was about three days before the new moon, but on the day of her perigee.</P>
<P>The shock in America on the 29th of November 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>83, was on the day after the moon's perigee.</P>
<P>That on the 16th of May 1791, was on the day of her peri∣gee and one day before the full moon.</P>
<P>The shock on the 1st of November 1761, was the day before her apogee.</P>
<P>The great earthquake in Iceland on the 10th of July 1789, was on the day of her apogee, and three days after the full.</P>
<P>That in Tuscany on the 30th of September in the same year, was two days before her apogee, approaching the full.</P>
<P>A shock at Lisbon on the 27th of November 1791, was two days after her perigee and change.</P>
<P>A shock on the 15th of January 1791 in Virginia, was two days after her apogee, and approaching the full.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A severe earthquake in the west and north of France on the 25th of January of the present year, 1799, was a few hours after the moon's perigee.</NOTE></P>
<P>These two last instances, according to another almanac, hap∣pened <HI>one</HI> day after the perigee and apogee. I have not taken pains to enter into <HI>exact</HI> calculations of the moon's place, as I do not deem it material. It is sufficient for my purpose that <HI>almost all</HI> earthquakes happen near the time of the moon's conjunction and opposition, or her perigee and apogee. Of these positions, it is obvious that her perigee and apogee have much the most in∣fluence; and the instances I have examined are almost equally divided between these two positions. Of all the earthquakes which I have compared with the moon's place, one or two only fall in her quadratures, and at her mean distance from the earth. An instance happened on the 11th of April 1799 in Carolina. I have compared several other instances, which happened near the perigee and apogee, but it is unnecessary to specify them. The examples mentioned will establish the generality of the fact, and the soundness of the principle.</P>
<P>On the principles of <HI>attraction,</HI> it will readily be admitted that the proximity of the moon to the earth, at certain periods of her
<PB N="291" REF="036687_0646_100AA5D3122EC130"/>
revolution, must <HI>draw,</HI> or excite into action and discharge, the electricity, of the earth. This accounts for earthquakes during the moon's perigee. But on enquiry we find a great proportion of the shocks take place during her apogee, when her distance is greatest and her supposed power the least; and not only so, but during her opposition to the sun, when her <HI>diminished</HI> influ∣ence is supposed to be counteracted and still <HI>further diminished</HI> by the attraction of the sun. This is an important fact and deserves investigation. That the influence of the moon is the direct ex∣citing cause of earthquakes, can hardly be questioned, after es∣tablishing the fact, that four out of five, or a much larger pro∣portion, happen when she is in particular parts of her orbit; but why her greatest distance and her least, should produce exactly the same effects, a fact equally well established, is a question which can perhaps be solved only on electrical principles.</P>
<P>That the electricity of the atmosphere and earth, is the medi∣um by which the moon acts upon the elements of the globe, is rendered probable by another fact. I possess the exact dates of very few volcanic eruptions; but by comparing such as I have, with the moon's place in her orbit, I find these eruptions begin or suffer violent exacerbations, at the time the moon is in her pe∣rigee or apogee; or in her conjunction or opposition.</P>
<P>The great eruption of Vesuvius in 1779 was augmented on the 8th and 9th of August, when the moon was in her perigee.</P>
<P>The tremendous eruption of Heckla in 1783, began on the first of June, when the moon was in her apogee, and increased till the 8th, after which it continued to be violent for a long time.</P>
<P>An eruption of Vesuvius on the 10th of May 1784 was du∣ring the moon's perigee</P>
<P>An eruption of fire near Palermo in Sicily on the 13th of March 1785 was two days after her perigee.</P>
<P>An eruption of Etna on the 19th of May 1780, the dark day in America, was the day after the full moon.</P>
<P>A dark day on the 9th of August 1732 was about the time of the new moon, and her apogee. The dark day at Detroit Octo∣ber 16, 1762 was the day after her perigee, and one day be∣fore the change.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="036687_0647_100A89E421CD9468"/>The eruption of Vesuvius March 8th, 1730 was on the day after the new moon, and a great exacerbation happened on the 14th, the day before her apogee.</P>
<P>The great eruption of the same volcano in 1794 was announ∣ced on the night of the 12th of June, nine hours before the full moon, by a violent earthquake. The eruption took place on the 15th.</P>
<P>The darkness in Canada, on the 15th and 16th of October 1785 was on the days next preceding the full moon and her peri∣gee. The obscurity on the 9th of that month was near the quadrature.</P>
<P>The eruption of Heckla in 1766 began on the 15th of April, the day before the moon's apogee.</P>
<P>The great eruption of Vesuvius and the earthquake, which bu∣ried Herculaneum, on the 1st of November A. D. 79, were the second day after her perigee.</P>
<P>The influence of the moon in producing storms of rain, snow and wind, is universally admitted; and that these happen near the positions of the moon already described, no man will under∣take to deny. The West-Indians expect hurricanes only near the time of the full and new moon; or her perigee and apogee. This is further evidence that the electrical fluid is the instrument of these commotions in the atmosphere. Electricity is known to be the ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se of winds, and its agency is visible in producing hurricanes; for experienced seamen foretel a hurricane by the unusual transparency of the water. Now it is a well known fact that electricity possesses the singular property of giving trans∣parency to opaque bodies.</P>
<P>A little before a hurricane in the West-Indies, seamen can see the lead, at an unusual depth; the sea also swells and rolls upon the shore in a singular manner, tho the air is perfectly tran∣quil. An effervescence also or bubbling is observed in the wa∣ter. Dark clouds are formed, and the atmosphere, before the tempest, is observed by vapors sensibly mephitic. See a letter from Gov. Ellis, dated March 6, 1789, in the 9th vol. of Museum, 215. Hence we observe the correctness of the com∣mon saying among seamen, that "hurricanes come out of the
<PB N="293" REF="036687_0648_100AA5D8B7A04F88"/>
sea." They are evidently generated by extraordinary dischar∣ges of electricity. Hence they are most frequent in the wind∣ward islands, which are all volcanic; some of them still dischar∣ging fire and smoke at times, and all of them evidently resting on a volcanic base.</P>
<P>Further, that electricity is the great agent in these agitations of the elements is rendered probable by the coincidences in time, between the more violent hurricanes, and great volcanic dis∣charges from Etna, Vesuvius and Iceland. Witness the terrible hurricanes of 1747, 1766, 1772, 1780, 1784 and 5, all of which happened near the time of great eruptions from the volca∣noes mentioned; all of which are distinguished in the annals of the Antilles, and still recollected with horror by the inhabitants. And this circumstance is no inconsiderable evidence, that the agent in volcanic eruptions, as well as in hurricanes, is electrici∣ty, and that this element is often disturbed or ejected from the whole globe, nearly at the same time.</P>
<P>Most of the great tempests, in all latitudes, happen near the moon's perigee and apogee; and in these positions, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e observe essential changes in the temperature of the atmosphere. I have taken some pains to compare the changes in heat and cold, with these positions of the moon, with a view to learn, whether the effects are uniform. On examining the state of the thermometer for two years, I find that, in almost every instance of the moon's perigee and apogee, especially in winter, there was a considera∣ble change of temperature. Usually the weather grew colder, as the moon approached her perigee. But the effects were not uniform; sometimes the weather became more temperate, at the perigee. But one general remark will be found true; that in re∣gard to heat and cold, the moon's apogee and perigee produce, at different times, precisely the same effects. This remark ac∣cords with what has before been observed in regard to earth∣quakes.</P>
<P>It is a general remark that the weather becomes cooler as the moon approaches the change. Should this remark prove to be well founded, the result would be this principle, that the cold is increased, or rather the heat lessened, by the combined influence
<PB N="294" REF="036687_0649_100AA5DAECCB7BC8"/>
of the sun and moon. This principle would accord with another observation just made, that the weather is cooler, during the moon's perigee, which is generally true in winter. That is, the greater power is exerted by distant orbs on our atmosphere, the more the heat is diminished. But this observation is not univer∣sally true. It is true that our winter occurs during the earth's perihelion; but this is usually explained on the principle of the obliquity of the sun's rays—a solution that perhaps is not com∣pletely satisfactory, altho, to a certain degree, it is doubtless just.</P>
<P>It is a popular opinion that vegetation is less rapid, and the flesh of animals less firm and substantial, and new shooting plants less vigorous, during the wane of the moon, than during her in∣crement. This opinion is too general and too respectable, to be considered the fruit of ignorance and credulity.</P>
<P>Aristotle alleges that the close of the lunar month is cooler than the other parts of it; and that during the decrease of the moon, the bodies of living animals possess less heat than at other times. De gener. animal. lib. 2. 4. These remarks, whether true or not, coincide with the modern popular opinion just re∣cited.</P>
<P>We are apt to neglect the opinions and practices of barbarous nations, and to hold in contempt the knowlege of ancient na∣tions. This often happens, I suspect, because we are less wise, than those whom we affect to despise. Cesar in his first book of the Gallic war, chapter 40, relates, that the ancient Germans, who were great observers of the phases of the moon, declined engaging in battle, during the wane of that planet. He had of∣fered battle to Ariovistus, but this commander declined a general action, and permitted only skirmishes. Cesar enquired of his prisoners the reason of this conduct, and was told that it was customary with the Germans to consult their venerable matrons, who, by means of lots and divination, pronounced on the pro∣priety of giving battle; and these had declared that it was not possible for the Germans to conquer, if they engaged in action before the new moon. "Non esse fas Germanos superare, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i ante novam lunam praelio contendissent." See Cesar's Com∣mentaries,
<PB N="295" REF="036687_0650_100AA5DCA1822FA0"/>
in the passage cited, and Henry's History of Bri∣tain, vol. 1. ch. 4.</P>
<P>We have this custom of the Germans presented to us, dis∣guised with superstition; but I strongly suspect it had its origin in the observation of the fact, mentioned by Aristotle, that in the decrease of the moon, animal bodies have less heat and vigor.</P>
<P>I am the more inclined to believe this, because the doctrin ac∣cords with modern observations concerning the invasion of fevers, and especially of epidemic diseases. Many medical authors concur in the fact, that diseases more generally attack the human body on the second or third day before the new or full moon. On examining the accounts of several writers, I find the times of invasion to be two or three days before or after the new and full moon, or about the time of its conjunction with the sun. See Jackson, Grainger, Lind and many other authors.</P>
<P>Diemerbroeck is explicit on this point. He relates that in the plague of 1636, "two or three days before and after the new and full moon, the disease was more violent; more persons were seized at those times, than at others; and those who were then seized, almost all died, in a very short time. Many patients who appeared before to be slightly affected, <HI>nescio qua virium labefac∣tione oppressi,</HI> says the author, by an unaccountable decline of strength, sunk and died in a few hours."</P>
<BIBL>De peste, page 9.</BIBL>
<P>From the observations of physicians it then appears, that this debility of the animal powers takes place near the time of the con∣junction and opposition of the sun and moon; near the moon's perigee and apogee; and in the same positions in which earth∣quakes and storms more generally occur.</P>
<P>Of the reality of this effect of the elements on the body, there can be no rational doubts. About the time of the change of the atmosphere, which indicates an approaching rain or storm, per∣sons of debilitated habits of body, perceive the change, by a loss of vivacity, dulness or heaviness; parts of the body that have lost their natural energy by means of wounds and tumors expe∣rience painful or uneasy sensations, by which storms are often pre∣dicted.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="036687_0651_100AA6546F1FA110"/>Fowls perceive this change in the atmosphere, and manifest their sensations. Candles sparkle and snap; the tallow melts more freely, and the flame is less steady. These things were ob∣served by Aristotle and Pliny.</P>
<P>This change in the atmosphere is not only perceptible by the sense of feeling, but becomes visible. Distant objects seen over water, and some writers say, over land also, <HI>loo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> is, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se, or appear elevated, several degrees, above their usual altit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. The ear also will aid us in foretelling rain and wind; for sounds become audible at an unusual distance.</P>
<P>Persons in full health are not sensible of these changes in the elements; at least, they are not so much affected, as to observe them. But from many years observation, I am convinced, that the catarrhal affections, which pass under the popular name of <HI>colds,</HI> are occasioned by the alterations in the atmosphere which precede changes of weather, and few of them from the applica∣tion of cold. I know this to be the case with myself; those phases of the moon, which have been mentioned as producing great effects on the earth and atmosphere, rarely pass, without affecting me with slight catarrh. This has been remarkably the case, since the fever of 1798, which left me in a state of debility. But many persons can attest the truth of the principle; nothing being more common than for persons to remark, that they can∣not tell how they took cold; and it being well known that ca∣tarrhs are more general and severe, on the transitions from cold to heat, than from heat to cold. The obstruction of the glands is evidently the effect of an insensible change in the atmosphere, probably by means of the decomposition of the electricity and the vapor or other elementary substances of the atmosphere. And the winds to which we ascribe the changes of weather are un∣questionably an <HI>effect,</HI> rather than a <HI>cause</HI> of those changes.</P>
<P>These alterations in the atmosphere appear to have some con∣nection with the tides; or rather with the cause of tides. It is said by seamen and other observers of the seasons, that full tides are apt to produce rain; that rain which begins at high water will cease, with the recess of the tide; but rain beginning at low water, will be of considerable duration. These and other obser∣vations,
<PB N="297" REF="036687_0652_100AA5DFEE446410"/>
if just, manifest an influence of the tides over the state of the atmosphere, or a dependence of both on one common cause—the same invisible energy of electricity producing both effects.</P>
<P>It is a known fact that the flowing tide often brings with it a breeze of wind. This is ascribed to the friction of the water on the air, and the cause assigned may be sufficient to account for the phenomenon. But it may be suggested whether the electricity of the atmosphere, may not produce both the tide and the wind. The intumescence of the ocean, previous to earthquakes and hurricanes, which are evidently occasioned by electricity, seems to bear a great analogy to the tides and to authorize my suspicions. The swell of the ocean during earthquakes, has usually been as∣cribed to the raising of the land beneath it; but this cannot be the cause, for such a swelling of the land never takes place over whole continents. The swell of the water is probably the effect of the elastic powers of the electricity discharged, operating on the water itself.</P>
<P>There are many diurnal and periodical phenomena, which are evidently connected with the lunar and solar influence, and de∣serve t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e mentioned in this place.</P>
<P>It is a well ascertained fact, that in the tropics, where the weight of the atmosphere is subject to very small variations, the barometer uniformly rises and falls with the tides, about two thirds of a line. Encyclop. <HI>art. wind.</HI> This is a small varia∣tion. But,</P>
<P>It is also asserted that, in those regions, "the variations in the gravity of the atmosphere seem to depend on the heat of the sun, as the barometer constantly sinks near <HI>half an inch</HI> every day, and rises again to its former station in the night." Ency∣clop. <HI>art. atmosphere.</HI> [I suspect the words "half an inch" to be an error.]</P>
<P>Now, if the barometer depends, for its fluctuations, on heat, we should suppose the same cause would operate in northern lat∣itudes, and occasion a diurnal rise and fall, in an exact ratio to heat and cold. In this case, a barometer would be a thermom∣eter
<PB N="298" REF="036687_0653_100AA5E22EA60C10"/>
reversed; rising with augmented cold and sinking with an increase of heat. But this is not the fact. The barometer often rises with the increase of heat, between sun-rise and twelve o'clock. Heat therefore cannot be the direct cause of the di∣urnal depression of the barometer in the equatorial climates; un∣less it has different laws, in different latitudes, which philosophy will not admit.</P>
<P>Let us compare the facts stated with the known phenomenon of the different forces of water, during the day and the night. The water-wheel of any mill, the altitude of the water and the resis∣tance being precisely the same, makes more revolutions, in a min∣ute, during the night, than in the day time. I have long been acquainted with the fact, and it is known to every miller; but as I have never seen a statement of it in any philosophical work, I have had the curiosity to make an accurate experiment to ascer∣tain the difference. This was done on the night after the 28th of May 1799; the weather being perfectly serene, the air free from vapor, not a breath of wind stirring to ruffle the water, and the barometer, on the evening preceding, at half past eight, standing at 30 and one tenth.</P>
<P>The first observation was made at a quarter before 7 P. M. sometime before sun set, the thermometer standing at 65 deg. when the wheel of the mill made exactly 16 revolutions in a minute. The altitude of the water was marked with precision; but the delivery of the water not having been exactly adjusted to the current entering the pond, the water rose, and at 9 o'clock had half an inch of altitude beyond the mark. By this means, my observation at that hour was lost. By raising another gate, the water was reduced to its former altitude, and by twelve o'clock the discharge of the water was exactly equal to the cur∣rent, and from that time to sunrise, the altitude continued the same.</P>
<P>At twelve o'clock and from that hour to three, the wheel made 17½ revolutions in a minute; the observations being often repeated, without a sensible variation of results. Soon after three o'clock, a small acceleration was perceptible, but it did not amount to half a revolution, until about half past three, when
<PB N="299" REF="036687_0654_100AA5E3B8115520"/>
the wheel made 18 revolutions in a minute, which accelerated movement continued till half past four, when, being near sun rise, the observations were discontinued. During the last observations, I perceived a very small retardation of movement, but it did not amount to half a revolution. To prevent any difference of re∣sistence in the mill, not the slightest alteration was made in the elevation of the stone, or the quantity of wheat delivered from the hopper, from the beginning to the end of the observations.</P>
<P>I had not a barometer with me at the mill, but about eight o'clock, on the following day, the barometer stood about one twentieth of an inch higher, than on the preceding evening. The thermometer fell, during the night, to 54 deg.</P>
<P>From this experiment, it is obvious that the weight of the at∣mosphere could not be the sole cause of the acceleration of the wheel. The acceleration at twelve o'clock was almost an <HI>elev∣enth</HI>—at a later hour, a <HI>ninth</HI> of the whole movement. The in∣creased gravity of the atmosphere will not account for a tenth of the difference.</P>
<P>We must then resort to other principles for a solution of the phenomenon. It is commonly supposed that water is a non∣compressible substance; but this opinion has been justly question∣ed. However this may be, I have little hesitation in resolving the phenomenon of the water-wheel into its increased elasticity during the night. How or why the subduction of light and heat should produce or increase this property in water, I leave for electricians to determin. The effect cannot be ascribed to the increased gravity of water, during the night, for no such increase is observed.</P>
<P>It is an observation of seamen that ships make more way in the water, by night than by day, with the same force of wind. I should suspect that the moisture on the sails might, in a de∣gree, contribute to this effect; but it must be recollected that in rainy days there is no difference in the moisture of the air by night and by day. Can the effect then be ascribed to the cause that accelerates the movement of water-wheels by night—an in∣creased elasticity? If the gravity and density of water were augmented during the night, these would render the water more
<PB N="300" REF="036687_0655_100AA5E5E70BC9E0"/>
buoyant, but retard the motion of a ship, by increasing the re∣sistance. We are therefore driven to the same hypothesis, an increase of elasticity, which renders water more buoyant when at rest, and more impressive when in motion, without an augmented density and weight. But I am not sure that the moisture of the air will not account for the whole effect.</P>
<P>If the elastic power of water is increased by the abstraction of heat, does it not follow that this power must be greater as we recede from the equator; and of course, any given force applied to the water in different latitudes, will occasion a vibration of that fluid, proportioned to its elasticity. Hence the small tides within the tropics, where the heat is nearly uniform; and the high tides in the northern regions, where the vibrations in the temperature of the atmosphere, are more considerable. Yet facts do not permit us to ascribe this elasticity to cold. It is more probably owing to the quantity of electricity, or to its pe∣culiar combination with aerial substances, of which cold is the effect. Perhaps the following observations will throw some light on this subject. Aristotle and after him, Pliny asserted that no animal dies, except during the ebb tide. "Nullum animal nisi aestu recedente expirare. Observatum id multum in Gallico O∣ceano, et duntaxat in homine compertum." Pliny, Nat. Hist. lib. 2. 98. "No animal dies, except during the recess of the tide. This is particularly observed on the coast of Gaul; and is at least true with respect to man."</P>
<P>The first part of this observation is probably too general; but modern facts confirm the assertion, within certain limitations. A late minister at Barrie in Scotland, contiguous to the German sea, made a similar remark, after fifty years observation.</P>
<BIBL>Sinclair, vol. 4. 240.</BIBL>
<P>The reason why Pliny has specified the coast of France, as remarkable for the fact stated, is very obvious. France lies on the main ocean, and the time of high and low water is the true time. On the coast of Italy, where there are no tides, the ob∣servation could not be made; and if made by the time of ebb tide in rivers and bays, it would not be just.</P>
<P>Another remark made by physicians, is, that <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI>
<PB N="301" REF="036687_0656_100AA5E89C5791C8"/>
more persons die during the latter part of the night, than at any other time in the solar day. This remark has not come to me from a sufficient number of observations to command full belief; but it accords with a few observations of my own. If univer∣sally true, it would contradict in part the remark of Aristotle and Pliny; but it is possible, both remarks may be true with certain limitations. The fact may be more obvious, when ebb tide hap∣pens between midnight and sunrise; and less so, when flood tide happens at that period; that is, under the combined or separate operation of the two causes.</P>
<P>Other facts lend their aid to support the observation that some essential change in the properties of the atmosphere takes place, in the latter part of the night. This is the time when all fevers remit or intermit. The exacerbations and paroxisms of fever in∣vade the patient, during some part of the day, and subside in the latter part of the following night.</P>
<P>Again. The chills that precede fevers usually come on in the same part of the day, that is, between midnight and sunrise. This is remarkably the case with epidemic diseases, as all physi∣cians agree. The fact has been ascribed to the debility induced by sleep; but I suspect it is owing to the debility induced by the same change in the stimulant powers of the atmosphere, which occasions the other phenomena before mentioned.</P>
<P>It is observable also that sleep, in the latter part of the night, is more sound, than at other times; an effect perhaps of the same cause.</P>
<P>Lind observes that in the East-Indies, patients generally expire at low water—the same fact is observable at the full moon—and convalescents usually relapse at these periods. See his Treatise on the diseases of hot climates. p. 86.</P>
<P>From experience I can testify that relapses usually occur, at those periods of the lunar month, when changes of weather take place.</P>
<P>Ulloa was careful to note the time of the tide when earthquakes occurred in South-America, and he found them invariably to happen at half ebb or half flood—never at high or low water.</P>
<BIBL>Voyage, vol. 2. B. 7. Ch. 7.</BIBL>
<P><PB N="302" REF="036687_0657_100AA5EABAABCA68"/>There are other periodical changes in the atmosphere which deserve notice. Great storms of wind, snow and rain, usually begin, abate and cease at certain hours, viz. at six, nine, twelve and three o'clock; especially at six and twelve. To this re∣mark there are very few exceptions.</P>
<P>Experienced accoucheurs inform me that in lingering cases of child-bed illness, paroxisms of pains recur at the same hours.</P>
<P>What is still more extraordinary, we are assured by unquestion∣able authority, that in volcanic eruptions, the discharges are more violent at these hours, than during the rest of the day. Sir Wil∣liam Hamilton, in his excellent account of the great eruption of Vesuvius, in June 1794, has the following passage. "The fe∣ver of the mountain, as had been remarked in former eruptions, showed itself to be, in some measure, periodical, and was gen∣erally most violent, at the break of day, at noon and at mid∣night."</P>
<BIBL>Univ. Magazine for August, 1795.</BIBL>
<P>These are the hours when we observe great changes in the at∣mosphere, and sudden effects on the human body in diseases. The break of day is precisely the time when the water-wheel is most accelerated—when fevers remit or intermit, and when the pa∣tient, lingering under disease, suddenly yields, and sinks into his grave.</P>
<P>To what cause shall these effects be ascribed? Not to lunar or solar attraction, in the usual sense of the word. Attraction is considered as a steady principle operating uniformly under the same circumstances; and therefore the attraction of the moon, whose position in regard to the earth is every day changed, can∣not account for periodical phenomena, at certain hours in the day. The influence of the sun will better solve the phenomena; but how can the same principle, attraction, operating by uniform laws, produce the same effects at two opposite hours, for instance at noon and at midnight, which certainly is the case in regard to the exacerbations of volcanic eruptions, as well as in regard to the commencement, abatement, and termination of storms?</P>
<P>I do not know that any principle yet discovered will solve the difficulty. But the phenomena bear a greater analogy to the op∣erations of electricity, than to any other principle in nature hith∣erto
<PB N="303" REF="036687_0658_100AA5EC446FC1E8"/>
discovered. It seems necessary to invite to our aid repulsion as well as attraction, producing in opposite points, the same ef∣fects. The nature and operations of electricity are little under∣stood, and probably will never be brought wholly within human comprehension.</P>
<P>It is to be wished that experiments on the revolutions of water-wheels, in different latitudes, may be made, with care and pre∣cision, to ascertain whether any acceleration at night takes place within the tropics, and if so, whether it equals the acceleration, in northern latitudes. And also whether the acceleration is great∣er in the latitude of 60 deg. than in the latitude of 40 deg. Our millers say that water has more force in winter, than in sum∣mer. This may be easily ascertained by experiment</P>
<P>We are enveloped in a mass of fluids, whose combinations are in a continual process of change. The energy of action seems to depend on electricity—or the principle of light, heat and fire; but I am persuaded that the manner in which changes are produ∣ced, is very little understood.</P>
<P>I will close this lengthy article by observing that the phenomena of lunar and solar influence are so well understood and clearly proved, as to justify in our minds, the great attention which the ancients paid to the influence of the planets on this globe. If they went into one extreme, by ascribing too much to that in∣fluence, the moderns have erred, on the other extreme, by holding their doctrins in contempt.</P>
<P>The sun is the great source of light, and his rays excite the heat which exists in and around the globe. It moves this uni∣versal principle, which constitutes the energy of the material system, under the control of infinite intelligence.</P>
<P>The moon is placed in the vicinity of the earth, to give vari∣ety to the seasons, and by acting on the elementary principle of heat, she occasions the vicissitudes of rain, snow, fair, calm and tempestuous weather. The changes which precede and produce these vicissitudes appear to be variations in the combinations of heat or electricity, with the other elemental principles of the at∣mosphere. These modifications of the atmosphere, without any access of new matter or diminution of its mass, produce differ∣ences
<PB N="304" REF="036687_0659_100AA5EE8A19FFA0"/>
in its density and elasticity, with all their various effects on the animal and vegetable systems. Hence a mere modifica∣tion or new combination of electricity, with vapor or other ae∣rial substance, may increase or diminish its stimulus—during the day, it may excite fever in the human body; during the night, a subduction of excitement in the atmosphere, may induce de∣bility, and favor the invasion of disease and the approach of death. These are mere hints and conjectures, intended to excite investi∣gation.</P>
<P>With respect to the supposed influence of comets on the ele∣ments of this globe, I would remark, that on the principles here suggested, that influence is very clearly proved and may be easily understood. The facts stated demonstrate that the sun and moon exert great powers on the globe; and the fact that earthquakes mostly happen in certain positions of the moon, prove that the <HI>medium</HI> of her influence is the electric principle.</P>
<P>Now comets are known to be of various magnitudes. Some of them are as large as Venus; much larger than the moon; with highly electrified atmospheres; and sometimes approaching near to the earth. The comet of 1577 came within less than a million of miles distance.</P>
<P>Those comets which pass the system at an immense distance from the earth can have no great influence; but others approach∣ing near, produce tremendous effects. Hence during their proximity to the earth, the number and violence of earthquakes and volcanic discharges; tempests, inundations from rains and extraordinary tides; and most sensible changes in the powers of animal and vegetable life. That such are the effects, is proved not only by the concurring opinions of all the ancient philosophers, who were accurate observers of nature, but by one uniform se∣ries of historical evidence, for more than two thousand years. On the principles of electricity, which is disturbed, attracted, repelled and modified in its combinations with other substances, by the approach of distant bodies, the solution of the phenomena is easy and philosophical.</P>

<HEAD>Of Electricity.</HEAD>
<P>SOME modern philosophers suppose that the earth contains vast quantities of fire, which is the source of the principal part of the heat on the earth, the cause of vegetation, of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, and of hot springs.</P>
<BIBL>See Buffon, and Darwin's Botanic Garden. Additional Notes, p. 145. New-York edition.</BIBL>
<P>There are some reasons to believe that particular parts of the earth abound with fire, or masses of burning lava. This opinion is supported by the issuing of smoke from the craters of certain volcanoes, for years in succession, without any eruption of fire.</P>
<P>But the theory which ascribes earthquakes to steam or vapor, appears to be very unsatisfactory. How can steam be collected within the bowels of the earth, sufficient to shake a continent of 3000 lengths in extent? If a great quantity of water should by accident fall on a mass of burning lava, the effect would not be a general equable shake or concussion, over a whole quarter of the globe, which sometimes happens in earthquakes; but a violent shake at the place of contact, and a disrupture of the earth, by which the force of the steam would be suddenly discharged into the atmosphere. This however is not the fact. Almost all earthquakes in North-America are progressive; beginning in the interior of the country and proceeding towards the ocean, in a direction perpendicular to the line of shore, that is, from north-west to south-east. Perhaps we can find a satisfactory solution of this phenomenon, upon electrical principles; but no cause can be found in the known properties and effects of steam.</P>
<P>One of the arguments used to maintain the theory of steam, is derived from the known fact that springs and streams are usual∣ly exhausted by extreme drouth, some time antecedent to earth∣quakes and volcanic eruptions. But the fact, instead of sup∣porting the theory, operates to destroy it.</P>
<P>The hypothesis supposes that, at certain times, the springs in the vicinity of burning lava descend and fall upon it; and the
<PB N="306" REF="036687_0661_100AA5F326126DF0"/>
water being raised into steam and extremely rarefied, expels the burning materials in volcanoes with great violence; and in earth∣quakes, the force of the steam alone ascends and shakes the earth.</P>
<P>But why should the water of the springs find passages to the lava, at some times and not at others? If the passages were al∣ways open, the water would always descend. If they are open at particular times only, there must be some subterraneous force exerted to open them, before the water comes in contact with the fire; the effect then or disrupture, must take place, in a certain degree, before the supposed cause can operate. Conse∣quently the force exists anterior to the disrupture which brings the water in contact with the fire. This conclusion supersedes the use of vapor.</P>
<P>But by what magic does it happen that all the springs and rivers in the neighborhood of a volcano for instance, disappear about the same time? By what mutual consent, can this remark∣able phenomenon be produced? And why, after the eruption, do all the springs and rivers resume their former channels? Is it possible to suppose thousands of passages, scattered over many leagues of earth, to be all opened at once, to convey subterra∣nean springs to a particular place, a few months anterior to an eruption of fire; and after the eruption, to be all closed at on; and the water compelled to run its former channels? Yet all this must be admitted on the theory of steam.</P>
<P>That large volumes of water are sometimes thrown into the basons of volcanic mountains and ejected, it true; but, in such cases, the disrupture is occasioned by a previous earthquake or force of fire, and the water is discharged in mass; not in the form of vapor.</P>
<P>It is a fact authorized by all history and observation, that great earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are often, if not usual∣ly, preceded by severe and universal drouth. This drouth of∣ten extends over whole continents; and I find that the defects of water which occasion the terrible famins in Egypt, India and China, of which we have many accounts, happen generally, (and I suspect always,) a few months before and during some
<PB N="307" REF="036687_0662_100AA5F4E390F330"/>
great discharges from volcanic mountains. I have certain evi∣dence that this failure of rain and springs sometimes occurs ten months before the eruption. This was the fact in Bengal in 1769—and in America in 1762 and 1782. At other times, the drouth happens during the eruption, and in some cases, it is continued for two or three years, in which eruptions take place in different parts of the work.</P>
<P>The drouth, on such occasioned is not occasioned solely by a failure of rain, but by the concurring influence of excessive evap∣oration. This fact is capable of demonstration. Sir William Hamilton, Univ. Mag. Aug. 1795, in his account of the erup∣tion of Vesuvius in 1794, informs us that some days previous to the discharge, the great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ountain at Torre del Greco began to decrease, so that the corn-mill worked by it moved slowly. In the wells of the town, the water f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll and it was necessary to lengthen the ropes daily. Some wells became quite dry. In a vineyard, near the town, some persons were alarmed, eight days before the eruption, by a sudden puff of smoke and explosion from the earth.</P>
<P>It is recorded that P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tycides foretold an earthquake in Greece, from a sudden failure of water in a well. These facts indicate unusual evaporation.</P>
<P>It is observable also that the exhaustion of water extends, in such cases, to a greater depth than usual. The earth, below the usual influence of the sun's heat and of rains, loses its natu∣ral moisture. Such probably was the case in 1782, when the cedar swamp in New-Jersey took fire and burnt to the depth of many feet. And this is probably what Livy meant, when, in speaking of the terrible drouth in Rome, before the great erup∣tion of Etna, B. C. 426, he uses the words "ingenito humore egens"—a failure of native moisture.</P>
<P>In the vicinity of volcanoes, this evaporation may be accoun∣ted for on the principle of subterranean heat, which is sensibly in∣creased, some time before an eruption. But this solution cannot apply to countries a thousand leagues distant, which suffer extreme evaporation, at the same time.</P>
<P>There appears <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no way to account for the phenomenon
<PB N="308" REF="036687_0663_100AA5F74A739920"/>
but by the great principle of action, electricity. Indeed the discovery of the fact, that most earthquakes happen under par∣ticular phases of the moon, and that volcanic eruptions are obvi∣ously affected by her position in her orbit, seems to place this point beyond question.</P>
<P>It seems then to be very certain that the electricity which ex∣ists in and about the earth is ess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fluenced by the sun, moon and planets, but especially by the larger comets; which pass near the earth. The influence of these bodies, or the essen∣tial laws of the universe, disturb this fluid and vary its distribu∣tions and its combinations with other substances.</P>
<P>Previous to earthquakes, volcanic discharges and hurricanes, it is evident from many phenomena already enumerated, the elec∣tricity of the earth passes out of it in unusual quantities; and as the air is often a bad conductor, the fluid acce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to it and car∣ries along, the water upon the surface and within the bowels of the earth. This process continued for some weeks and months, exhausts all the rivers and springs. The atmosphere, in the mean time, becomes more and more dry, and a worse conductor, un∣til both air and earth become perfectly electric, or non-conduc∣tors. In this situation, either a great demand for the fluid in some distant region, or a great accumulation of it in the bowels of the earth, has prepared the way for a sudden explosion, but no conducting medium exists, sufficient to convey it. A fall of rain, at this time, may create that medium; and hence the com∣mon fact that earthquakes happen soon after rain, succeeding se∣vere drouth. If no rain falls, the fluid accumulates, till it for∣ces a passage through the great apertures, formed for the purpose, the volcanic mountains, setting fire, on its way, to the hydro∣gene, and other inflammable substances, which the ocean gene∣rates or deposits in their bosoms.</P>
<P>I know not that these conclusions are just, but the facts from which I reason, are indisputable. The uncommon discharges of electricity, <HI>previous to these great concussions,</HI> are indicated not on∣ly by the exhaustion of streams and springs but by many phe∣nomena in the atmosphere, showing it to be highly electrified. Meteors, huge globes of fire, shoot through the air, not only af∣ter,
<PB N="309" REF="036687_0664_100AA5F9EFFE1260"/>
but <HI>before</HI> the eruption. Witness the meteors of 1758, 1762, and one in May 1783, mentioned in the preceding history. And Sir William Hamilton informs us that the air was unusual∣ly charged with electricity, some days before the eruption of 1794.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">May not the appearances of certain epidemic diseases of inflam∣matory diathesis be ascribed to this too highly electrified, and of course, stimulant state of the atmosphere? The influenza of 1708 was prece∣ded by a meteor or fiery globe. In 1758 was a meteor and the measles began in America. In 1771 a meteor, and then commenced influenza and measles. In 1775 a meteor, and the cynanche maligna prevailed.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In America, and in Europe, influenza.</NOTE> In 1783 two meteors, and then commenced measles and scarlatina angi∣nosa. In 1788 a meteor, and immediately began the measles. If these coincidences are all the work of chance, they are certainly a very sin∣gular kind of accidents. More facts and observations than I possess are necessary to settle this question.</NOTE> Unusual halos and mock suns, fiery and luminous ap∣pearances in the heavens, with extraordinary tempests, and hail, are evidences of the same fact.</P>
<P>The idea that the heat which we experience exists in and about the globe, is undoubtedly well founded. The sun is prob∣ably the great electric of the system, which excites into action the heat of the atmosphere and the earth; but there is no reason to believe that heat is principally derived from that body. The solar rays constitute a very small part of the heat of the earth; but they excite it by the rapidity of their motions, or by decom∣posing that which exists in the air and earth.</P>
<P>Hence there appears to be little foundation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the opinion, that the inferior planets which are nearest to the sun, have more heat, than Saturn and Jupiter. If heat is diminished in the ratio of the squares of the distances from the sun, it is on the principle that heat consists in solar rays; but this is a very ques∣tionable doctrin. Light is a substance, but does not necessarily contain heat; at least not any that is perceptible.</P>
<P>It is probable, that if the solar rays falling on Saturn are di∣minished in number, according to the doctrin of diverging lines, that this defect is supplied by an increase of density or suscepti∣bility of excitement, in the atmosphere of that planet. The density and capacity of being excited may be in a direct propor∣tion to the solid contents of the planet, or in a duplicate ratio to

the di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e. Hence the larger planets are placed at the greater distance, And on this principle there is no ground to calculate, as Newton has done, the extreme heat which comets acquite in their perihelion. No substance of which we have any knowlege, could sustain the intensity of heat which, he has calculated, the comet of 1660 must have received. It is more consonant to the general arrangement of the universe, as far as our limited understandings can comprehend it, to suppose none of the great orbs that roll in infinite space, are either over heated or over cooled. Every orb has probably its own fund of heat, and the capacity of being excited, suited to its place and destination. The planets, the comets in the parts of their trajectories most remote from the sun, and even the sun itself, may be inhabited.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I take this opportunity, in discussing the question concerning the origin of heat, to notice what philosophers have said on the subject of the internal heat of the earth. Darwin, in his Botanic Garden, note 6, alleges the earth below the depth of about ten feet, to be always of the same temperature, which is 48 deg. by Farenheit. He cites Dr. Franklin's observation, that spring water at Philadelphia is of 52 de∣grees, which, he supposes, a proof of internal heat from central fires. For as the climate of North-America is colder, than that of England, he could not account for the excess of heat in the water at Philadel∣phia, beyond that of England <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t by presuming it to be occasioned by internal fires. Yet in another passage, in note 7, the author intimates that he had an idea of a difference of heat in different latitudes, deri∣ved from the action of the solar rays. Yet I cannot find any European author who appears to have had a correct idea of this subject; and Mr. Jefferson, in his Notes on Virginia, query 5, has manifested his ignorance of it, by a most egregious mistake. Speaking of a cave in Frederick county, he informs, that the thermometer, which stood at 50 deg. in the open air, rose to 57 deg. in the cave. He then adds the following remark, "The uniform temperature of the cellars of the Observatory of Paris, which are 90 feet deep, and of all <HI>subterranean cavities</HI> of any depth, where no chymical agents may be supposed to produce a factitious heat, has been found to be 10 deg. of Reaumer, equal to 54½ of Farenheit. The temperature of the cave above men∣tioned so nearly corresponds with this, that the difference may be as∣cribed to a difference of instruments."</P>
<P>It seems a little strange that so gross an error should have passed un∣corrected, till this late age, on a point of fact so easy to be ascertained.</P>
<P>The truth is, the temperature of the earth, below the diurnal and annual influence of the solar rays, which may be perhaps ten feet in solid earth and 30 feet in open wells, is regulated by the proximity of place to the equator, subject to small variations, from the position of the place in regard to the ocean and the height of the land.</P>
<P>But what is remarkable, this temperature of the earth and water in the anterior of the globe, is precisely the <HI>mean temperature</HI> of the climate, in the place where the observation is made. Thus, let the highest and lowest points be taken daily by any good instrument, and divide the sum of all the observations by the number of days in the year, the quotient will be the mean temperature of the climate, and precisely the temperature of the water, below the variations of heat and cold. If any difference should be found, it must be owing to inaccuracy in the observations. It is more usual to take three observations daily; at 2 o'clock P. M. the warmest time in the day, at sun-rise the coldest time, and at sun-set, which is found to be the mean temperature. By observations made in the city of New-York for one year, I found the mean temperature to be 53½; but this is 1½ degree too high; owing to an excess of heat <HI>within the city,</HI> beyond the general temperature of the climate. The air in a city cools less at night, than in the country, and hence the morning observations were found to be too high. In many instances, ice as thick as glass was formed a mile from New-York, when an accurate thermometer in the city fell no lower than 40 deg. Hence the great error of determining the temperature of a climate, by obser∣vations made in a large city; which is often done in Europe.</P>
<P>The mean temperature of the climate in England, is 48 deg. That of Paris, 54½. This difference is owing to the insular situation of England; the atmosphere in the vicinity of large tracts of water being always more temperate, than on continents at a distance from the sea or great lakes.</P>
<P>The following is the mean temperature of the climate of the re∣spective places, ascertained by observations.</P>

<P>Allowing a trisle for differences of instruments, this table presents to view the various mean temperatures of the climates mentioned.</P>
<P>From this table naturally arise two observations. First the great dif∣ference between the climate in Europe and America, under the same parallels of latitude. Thus London in 51 degrees north, has a mean temperature, almost as mild as Hartford in 41, Paris in the 49th de∣gree has a climate, nearly as mild as the northern parts of Virginia in the 39th, and warmer than New-York and Philadelphia in the 40th.</P>
<P>Again we observe the great effect of the ocean upon the climate. Salem in Massachusetts is upon the sea shore, and Rutland, in Ver∣mont, fifty or sixty leagues distant; and one degree of latitude differ∣ence in the position of the places; yet the climate at Rutland it 3½ degrees colder than at Salem. On the other hand, Quebec, remote from the sea, tho on a river, with three degrees difference of northern latitude, has a difference of only 1½ degree in climate.</P>
<P>To ascertain the mean temperature of any given place, it is only necessary to plunge a good thermometer into water, taken from a depth, in which the temperature it uniform, at all seasons of the year.</P>
<P>The mean temperature of water within the tropics it not exactly known, but it must be very near 80 deg. by Farenheit. Water drawn from a depth of 200 feet in the West-Indies, it <HI>cooled</HI> by filtration in the air, above the earth in those hot regions.</P>
<P>The difference in the temperature of Europe and America under the same parallels, is nearly that of ten degrees of latitude.</P>

But modern philosophers enjoy the benefit of many discoveries made by experiments and by col∣lections of facts, which give them an eminent advantage over the great astronomers of the last century.

gravity and resistance. He supposed them to consist of vapor or smoke repelled from the nucleus by the force of the sun's heat. He seem to have been aware of the objection to this theory from the resistance that must be made to the assent of the vapor, by the celestial ether; and therefore supposes an extreme rarefac∣tion to take place, which removes that resistance.</P>
<P>But whatever rarefaction may be supposed, still it will remain an incontrovertible principle in physics, that no substance that has <HI>gravity</HI> can be supported, but in a medium which has <HI>more gravity.</HI> The vapor supposed in the present case could not be maintained in strait lines, without a medium of greater density to support it. Now, any medium capable of supporting vapor must furnish great resistance, and very much retard its velocity.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I submit it to mathematicians whether on Newton's own principles, an atmosphere of density sufficient to support a cannon ball, would not retard its ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, as much as the present atmosphere does a feather put in motion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> rarefaction does not in the least aid the ascent of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from the body of a comet.</NOTE></P>
<P>With these known principles in view, let any man calculate the velocity of vapor, driven from the nucleus of a comit, ne∣cessary to preserve a direction nearly opposite to the sun, in its perihelion passage.</P>
<P>Comets enter the solar system in various directions; the planes of their orbits making various angles with that of the ecliptic. Their orbits are nearly elliptical, and the sun is in one of the foci of the ellipsis.</P>
<P>By the universal law of planetary motion, according to which all revolving bodies describe equal areas in equal times, the mo∣tion
<PB N="313" REF="036687_0668_100AA60267E38C40"/>
of comets must be very rapid in their perihelion. The comet of 1770 was calculated to describe an arch of 50 degrees in 24 hours. This seems hardly credible; but many comets describe an arch of 180 degrees, a semi-circle, in 30, 40, or 50 days.</P>
<P>The perihelion distances also of the various comets are very different, and so are the lengths of their tails; some of them extending a small distance, and others to 60 and 80 millions of miles.</P>
<P>Suppose the perihelion distance to be 30 millions of miles, and the length of the coma to be 70 millions. In this case the ex∣tremity of the tail must be 100 millions of miles from the sun. Now, either the vapor which is supposed to constitute the tail, must be shot from the nucleus with such rapidity, as to reach the extreme point of the coma, in a few hours; that is, it must pass through 70 millions of miles, in a very short time, to pre∣serve a direction nearly opposite to the sun; or the whole coma must move forward with the nucleus. In the latter case, the extremity of the coma must pass along the periphery of a circle,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The figure would not be a circle, but it is not material to the ar∣gument.</NOTE> whose radius is a line from that point to the sun, or 100 millions of miles. Of course while the comet describes an arch equal to a semi-circle, the extremity of the coma must pass through the space of 150 millions of miles. I believe no kind of vapor of which we have any knowlege, could perform either of these journeys in the time given.</P>
<P>On the other hand that gravitating substance would not have passed thro the distance supposed, from the creation of the world to this time.</P>
<P>On subjects of this kind, we cannot arrive at certainty. All we can do is, to reason from analogy and from probable conjec∣tures. We know of no substance in creation, capable of pro∣ducing the phenomena of the comas of blazing stars, except electricity or light. No other species of matter passes with a rapidity that will solve the phenomenon of the length of the coma preserved in a direction opposite to the sun. The theories of Kepler and Hamilton are more rational, than that of New∣ton.
<PB N="314" REF="036687_0669_100AA605BA32AE80"/>
The tails must consist of electricity repelled from the nu∣cleus by the force of the sun; or must be merely the rays of light colored by their passage thro the comet's atmosphere. These hypotheses may not solve <HI>all</HI> the phenomena; but they will account for the principal; and are repugnant to no philo∣sophical principles.</P>
<P>The curvature of the coma has been alleged as an objection to this hypothesis. But in fact this is a confirmatory argument in favor of it; for it is analagous to the curvatures formed by as∣cending streams of electricity in the lumen boreale; indeed it seems to be a law of electricity to move in bending lines; and for any thing we know, this phenomenon may result from the nature of that species of matter, and be independent of resist∣ance.</P>
<P>In regard to the transparency of the tail, it resembles also the lumen boreale. Thro both of these luminous appearances, the stars shine with undiminished lustre; but vapor, however rare, would refract their light, and in a certain degree, interrupt our vision.</P>
<P>An Essay on Comets by Andrew Oliver, published 1772, as∣cribes the tails of comets to air extremely dilated and repelled from the nucleus by the power of the sun; but this hypothesis is liable to all the objections stated against the theory of Newton.</P>
<P>My own opinion respecting the material system, is this; that an atmosphere, the basis of which is electricity, fills infinite space and involves in its bosom all the solid orbs which shine in the ce∣lestial regions. This may be denominated the <HI>mundane atmos∣phere.</HI> My hypothesis rests on the following reasons.</P>
<P>First. The large meteors or globes of fire are formed in re∣gions far beyond the limit assigned to the earth's atmosphere. Their altitudes vary from 40 to 80 miles. At the height of 80 miles, then, there must be the matter of an atmosphere, capa∣ble, of generating globes of fire of half a mile in diameter; and of communicating sounds, as full and distinct, as the air near the earth; for the explosion of one of those globes resembles thunder.</P>
<P>Secondly. The lumen boreale has been often calculated to be visible at an elevation of 7 or 800 miles. I do not rely on
<PB N="315" REF="036687_0670_100AA6074BCAC4B0"/>
the accuracy of these calculations, on account of the difficulties attending them. In some instances we are very certain that this light exists in the regions of the higher clouds.</P>
<P>Thirdly. The tails of comets must be matter, or depend on matter for their coloring by which they become visible. In ei∣ther case we have evidences nearly amounting to demonstration that a material atmosphere fills the boundless regions of space.</P>
<P>Fourthly. But an argument of still more weight in my mind, is one drawn from the necessity of such an atmosphere, as the me∣dium of attraction and repulsion—the principles that connect and bind together the vast orbs that roll in etherial regions. I can have no idea of such an immense power exerted in an immense void or vacuum.</P>
<P>It seems probable that the parts of our atmosphere which con∣stitute weight, and are supposed to influence the barometer, are limited to the distance of a few miles from the earth. Water, for instance, is a substance destined to answer certain purposes on the globe, and is probably confined to its neighborhood.</P>
<P>But the principle of electricity may be, and undoubtedly is, a nongravitating and permanently elastic substance. This may be diffused through infinite space, and by its amazing elasticity, may be capable of communicating motion or force from planet to plan∣et, with the rapidity of light.</P>
<P>Newton supposed infinite space to be filled with a subtle sub∣stance which he called <HI>ether.</HI> Had this great man been acquainted with the laws of electricity discovered since his days, he probably would have exchanged the term ether, for <HI>electricity.</HI></P>
<P>By means of this powerful principle, the planets all influence each other; and become the means of diversifying each other's seasons; sometimes by attracting, sometimes by repelling, and sometimes disturbing the proportions of this substance, or influen∣cing its mechanical laws, by which it is combined or decompo∣sed with other atmospheric substances.</P>
<P>Hence we may account for the frequency of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and violent tempests, under particular phases of the moon, and especially during the proximity of comets. The electrical matter accumulated in the earth by its own laws, or by reason of an unusual demand a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> extra may, during the ap∣proach
<PB N="316" REF="036687_0671_100AA609B7BF7430"/>
of these orbs, be suddenly called into action, and occa∣sion extraordinary tumults in the atmosphere.</P>
<P>Perhaps also we may, in this hypothesis, find a solution of the phenomenon, so interesting to man, and so mysterious, why the approach of comets never fails to be attended with epidemic dis∣eases. The fact in regard to comets which come near the earth, it unquestionable; and it is equally certain that earth∣quakes, volcanic eruptions, meteors and many other electrical phenomena, are, at such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more numerous and violent, than at other times.</P>
<P>Now it is proved by experiments that the fibres of living ani∣mals are the most perfect conductors of electricity, while the in∣teguments which cover them are non-conductors. A consequence of these principles must be, that in all the motions or operations of electricity in the atmosphere, the nerves must be the principal subjects of its influence. Hence if the atmosphere is, at times, electrified beyond the degree which is usual, and necessary to preserve the body in a due state of excitement, the nerves must be too highly excited, and under a continued operation of undue stimulus, become extremely irritable, and subject to debility. Shall we not find, in this hypothesis, a rational solution of the phenomenon which has puzzled medical men, the excessive irri∣tability of the nervous system, in times of epidemic diseases, which facilitates the invasion of fever? Shall we not account for the eruptive diseases which always precede pestilential epidem∣ics, on the principle of the great debility of the extreme vessels, induced by the weakness of the nerves which spread over the human body near the surface, by which means these vessels are rendered incapable of performing their usual secretions? Shall we not be able to account for the remarkable coincidences in time between the influenza, and unusual electrical phenomena, as volcanic eruptions and earthquake? May we not account for epidemic measles, in those years when the atmosphere shows ev∣idences of high electrification? And will not this principle ex∣plain the diseases among animals, the defect of vegetation, and the extraordinary generation of insects, during pestilence? It is well known that vegetation may be greatly accelerated by artifi∣cial electricity. Is this effect produced by what is called <HI>ex∣citement</HI>?
<PB N="317" REF="036687_0672_100AA60C916D97F8"/>
And if so, how do we know that a similar power, operating on the elements, may not call into existence innumeri∣ble insects? To what other principle shall we ascribe the <HI>unusual size</HI> of common insects, when they precede and accompany pes∣tilence, a fact well attested? There must be a cause for these phenomena, and where shall we find it, but in the universal principle of excitement?</P>
<P>It is now agreed among philosophers that electricity is the im∣mediate agent in the formation of rain, snow and hail. In con∣firmation of this theory, my enquiries into the cause of epidemic diseases have led to a discovery, that those years when volcanoes discharge great quantities of fire and lava, including some months before and after the discharges, are by a great difference, most productive of hail. Hence the immense damage done by hail-storms in those seasons which are excessively dry and hot; these years being closely attendant on volcanic eruptions. The theory which ascribes hail to extreme cold is defective. We know that pieces of ice of three, six and even nine inches in circumference sometimes fall in hail-storms. By the laws of gravity, a hail-stone must begin to fall, as soon as it begins to be formed; and as it requires but a few seconds to descend, it is easy to conceive that mere cold cannot occasion a congelation rapid enough to form pieces of ice of half a pound weight. The process is elec∣trical, and almost instantaneous; and we know that real snow may be artificially and instantly produced by means of condensed air and electricity. Hence we are led to the causes which con∣nect severe winters with volcanic eruptions; we derive the ex∣treme heat of summers and cold of winters, which so generally accompany pestilence, from the same cause, a super abundance of electricity.</P>
<P>Hence we are led also to the cause of the apoplexies, lethar∣gies and eruptive diseases, which almost uniformly follow great volcanic discharges and earthquakes in Italy. The system, and es∣pecially the nerves, are excessively excited, and lose their energy.</P>
<P>It is on the same principle also that we explain the phenomena of freezings when the thermometer is above the usual point of frost. This has been observed near volcanic mountains, where the atmosphere is highly charged with electricity. In 1730,
<PB N="318" REF="036687_0673_100AA60EC7DD5610"/>
Dr. Cyrillas found by a thermometer made by Hauksbee, that water, near Vesuvius, froze with the mercury 10 degrees above the freezing point.</P>
<BIBL>Phil. Trans. No. 424. Bad. Mem. vol. 9. 299.</BIBL>
<P>The nature of this element, electricity, is little understood. It is the modern opinion that heat and light are only modifica∣tions of the same element. This is analogous to what we know of water, which exists in the form of water, of visible vapor and air.</P>
<P>It is supposed that electricity cannot be insulated in the human body. But if it cannot be insolated in the form of <HI>electricity,</HI> may it not in the form of <HI>heat,</HI> and thus be the direct cause or matter of inflammation? If it can be accumulated and insulated in this form, may not conductors be formed to draw it off in the form of electricity? Mr. Vinal relates that he speedily re∣moved local inflammation occasioned by a burn and scald, by the application of a negatively charged electrical machine.</P>
<BIBL>Mem. Amer. Acad. vol. 2. 144.</BIBL>
<P>Should this doctrin be well founded, the success of metallic points in removing topical inflammation, will be explained and established.</P>
<P>The proofs of the altitude of the atmosphere from the power of refracting light, are now known to be fallacious. No man will suppose the atmosphere to be less elevated, in the equatorial regions, than in the polar circles; yet the duration of twilight, under the equator, being less than in places remote from it, proves that the power of refraction will not determin the height of the atmosphere. The power of refraction is in a ratio to the diminu∣tion of heat, or increase of cold, in the atmosphere; or perhaps to the increase of electricity.</P>
<P>Nor will it be correct to say that the power of refraction de∣pends on the density of the atmosphere, unless density can exist independent of gravity. The atmosphere in the polar and tem∣perate regions raises the barometer no higher, than under the equator; nor is the mercury in barometers generally higher in winter, when the thermometer, by Farenheit's scale, is 20 de∣grees under cypher, than in summer when it is at 98 deg. the temperature of blood heat.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="036687_0674_100AA6104E8D47E0"/>If density implies or involves in it gravity, then the atmosphere at the equator is as dense as in any distant latitude, for the bar∣ometer is as high in one as in the other. But if the atmosphere it as dense and as heavy, caeteris paribus, in one latitude, as in another, then the powers of refraction, in different latitudes, which are various, cannot depend on density.</P>
<P>It is indeed very questionable whether density and gravity are the principles which wholly influence the barometer. The bar∣ometer falls, as it is elevated above the surface of the earth; but the atmosphere retains all its powers of sustaining respiration and circulation, at an altitude of 15,000 feet.</P>
<P>What are the aerial phenomena that attend a fall of the bar∣ometer? How can the weight of the mass of air surrounding the globe, be suddenly taken off, over a whole continent? What be∣comes of its gravity, and the principle of attraction on which it is supposed to depend? Are they removed, expelled, or sus∣pended?</P>
<P>I suspect the theory which assigns to the barometer the province of determining the gravity of air, is fundamentally defective; and that instead of variations in its <HI>weight,</HI> it indicates only va∣riations in the combinations of its parts, which diversify its <HI>elasti∣city,</HI> and its operation on the barometer, as well as on the human body. When the atmosphere is full of vapor, the barometer usually falls, and we feel a depression of spirits. It can handly be true, that the pressure of the whole atmosphere is less, at such a time, than when the air is clear and the barometer high; for this vapor circulates near the earth and the higher regions of the air are as clear and as ponderous as usual. If the density of the air near the earth should be lessened, the consequence must be the air from higher regions which retains its gravity, must instantly rush in to supply the defect.</P>
<P>The only way to account for the variations of the barometer, appears to be on the principle before mentioned. The air appears to be less elastic, when the heat is combined with vapor, and the mercury falls. It seems necessary to take into view these consid∣erations in order to solve the phenomena. The general pressure of the atmosphere or gravity, is probably uniform, and it is
<PB N="320" REF="036687_0675_100AA611E04AD498"/>
the various changes in its elastic powers, which occasion the vibrations in the barometer.</P>
<P>Every dairy woman knows that thunder and lightning will al∣most instantly coagulate milk; that is, when electricity is united with vapor, and passes, in a visible form, from cloud to cloud, or between the clouds and the earth, <HI>milk turns,</HI> or coagulates— so it does, during a rainy day, in summer, without thunder, with the thermometer at 64 deg. as I know by observation. This condition of the atmosphere, may be called its <HI>decomposed</HI> state. The barometer falls, vapor becomes visible, the functions of the body are languid, milk coagulates, objects contract mould, in short the atmosphere is unelastic, and ill-fitted to maintain vigor in animal or vegetable bodies.</P>
<P>Thus also the fermentation of beer is checked and destroyed by thunder, and no human art has been found to restore it. By what process of electricity is this sudden change effected?</P>
<P>I have remarked in the preceding pages, that a pestilential at∣mosphere is not corrected or moved by the force of wind—no tem∣pest expelling an epidemic fever from a city, unless at the close of the season, and accompanied with heavy rains. How can we solve this difficulty, but upon the hypothesis of an electrical atmosphere which it stationary?</P>
<P>Dr. Franklin proved that "an electrified cork ball at the end of a silk thread, whirled never so rapidly through the air, for a length of time, lost none of its electricity. He found also by an experiment that an electrical atmosphere raised round a thick wire, inserted in a phial of air, drives out none of the air; nor on withdrawing that atmosphere, would any air rush in." On Electricity, Lond. ed. 97. It is also proved that a most violent blast of wind, thrown across a stream of electrical matter, has not the least effect upon it.</P>
<P>These experiments prove that air furnishes no sensible resistance to the motion of electricity, and that it exists in air without ex∣panding or compressing it. In short it proves that electricity acts entirely by its own laws, and is not controlled by the agita∣tions of the air.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="036687_0676_100AA61578FF1468"/>Will not these observations throw light on the fact of a sta∣tionary atmosphere in cases of pestilential epidemics? Is not electricity the basis of the common atmosphere, and immoveable by wind? And does not a pestilential air consist partly in some combinations of this element, with other aerial substances, which are not moved by wind? This is suggested merely for con∣sideration; for it appears to me improbable. Frost destroys the pestilential condition of the atmosphere, and this is supposed to act upon the deleterious substances arising from the earth, or hu∣man body. Besides, a pestilential atmosphere rises but a few feet above the earth, which indicates that its pernicious qualities are dense and gravitating substances.</P>
<P>Indeed two causes seem to concur in the origin of pestilential fevers—an electrical condition of the atmosphere which renders the nervous system extremely irritable, and the body of course prone to fever; and a collection of morbid matters arising from living<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I mention the morbid matters from <HI>living</HI> bodies, among the causes of pestilence. I am persuaded that perspiration in cities furnishes more poison than streets and alleys. It fills all close rooms, especially bed rooms; in close-built streets, it infects the very atmosphere; and a more virulent poison does not exist, than perspirable matter in a con∣densed and fermenting state. This can only be destroyed by a liberal use of water.</NOTE> and dead animals, and putrefying vegetables. Wind may remove the latter cause, if accessible, which however is never the case in large cities; but cannot affect the influence of the former. Frost has access to all morbid causes, and renders them inert. It also reduces the stimulus acting on the human body, and renders it less irritable. But the electrical stimulus remains. Hence altho the progress of the fever is arrested by cold, the type of it is visible in the diseases of the winter. The irritability of the system, from electrical causes, still re∣mains; and gives to the fevers of winter the peculiar symptoms of pestilential or typhus pleurisy, and peripneumony.</P>
<P>A remarkable property of electricity is to give polarity to the needle of a compass. A violent stroke of electricity, destroyed the virtue of the loadstone, and reversed the ends of the needle of the compass on board of Capt. Waddell's ship in 1751; and a suitable discharge of that element will give polarity, like the
<PB N="322" REF="036687_0677_100AA61A51EF6A58"/>
magnet. Hence it is concluded that magnetism depends on electricity, but in what manner, seems to be mysterious.</P>
<P>It is well known that the needle is subject to variations, which are different in different parts of the earth; and in some degree, periodical. It has also a small diurnal variation; receding from the east or <HI>influence of the sun</HI> from 8 o'clock in the morning to 2 in the afternoon; and from the west, or the same influence, from 2 o'clock to 9 P. M.; and during the night, remaining stationary. Is not this owing to the repulsion of light and heat? If so, is there not an analogy between this diurnal variation, and the phenomenon of polarity? If light and heat, falling on one side of the needle, repel it in a small degree; is it not ra∣tional to conclude that the equatorial heat, should repel the mag∣netic point, and direct it to the north? That is, the needle points towards that portion of the atmosphere which is most per∣fectly electric.</P>
<P>It may be objected that the needle does not always direct it∣self to the same point. True; but there is some periodical revo∣lution in the electricity of the terrestrial regions; as the appear∣ance and disappearance of the lumen boreale, at certain periods, warrants this suggestion. It seems to be admitted that there is a current of electricity from the equatorial regions towards the polar regions, within the earth, and in the upper parts of the atmosphere, a current of the same element from the poles to∣wards the equator. This idea is derived in part from the lumen boreale, and receives countenance from the fact, that a bar of iron, standing directed towards the pole will acquire polarity or magnetic properties; but directed towards other points in the heavens, no such effect is produced; indicating a stream of e∣lectricity passing through the bar, from the center of the earth towards the pole, but not in any other direction.</P>
<P>Should this idea be well founded, and should it be admitted that the lumen boreale is a current of electricity from the north to the south, will not the periodical appearance and disppearance of this light, indicate a revolution in that current about the axis of the earth, or perhaps an axis of its own? If so, on what laws does it depend, and how will it agree with the variations of the compass?</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="036687_0678_100AA6183954C5E8"/>It will be said, that the variations are different in different places, and not uniform in the same place. True; but the gen∣eral course of variations in the same place is tolerably uniform.</P>
<P>With respect to different degrees of variations in various pla∣ces, I have one observation that is probably new. It is very probable, if not evident, that the <HI>distributions</HI> or <HI>forces</HI> of elec∣tricity are different in different quarters of the globe. I say <HI>distributions</HI> or <HI>forces;</HI> for a difference in the state of existence or modes of acting, will as well account for the phenomena, as difference in quantity. My reasons for this opinion are, that the barometer has different altitudes, in different places, at the same time. The mean altitude for a month or a year, in places of the same elevation, is very various. Hence we conclude that the weight of the atmosphere cannot be the cause of these varia∣tions, for this on a level of the ocean, must, on hydrostatic prin∣ciples, be every where the same. Yet the actual differences a∣mount to one half or two thirds of an inch.</P>
<BIBL>See Phil. Trans. No 435. B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d. Mem. Vol. 10. 81.</BIBL>
<P>It is easy to account for this difference of pressure on the prin∣ciple of different combinations of the electric principle with vapor or other local matter in the atmosphere, which may vary the <HI>force</HI> or elasticity of the air; but I do not see how the <HI>weight</HI> of a fluid alone, whose pressure must be equal, if of equal height and den∣sity, can account for these differences. It is utterly repugnant to all known principles of the equable pressure of a gravitating fluid, to suppose a mere change in the form or composition of that fluid, should alter the absolute weight. Water admits none of these varieties, being always of equal density and gravity at equal altitudes.</P>
<P>On the same principle of a difference of pressure or elasticity in air and water, without a change of weight, perhaps we may account for the very different elevations of the tide in different places, and in some instances, in the same latitude. It is rational to conclude that the electricity is various in its combinations or quantity, in different places, according to the heat of the climate, the neighborhood of land and high mountains, or perhaps to the seats of volcanoes? The fact that tides do not rise as high, on the main ocean, as near land, seems to countenance this idea.
<PB N="324" REF="036687_0679_100AA61C1F038F58"/>
It seems to indicate that the medium by which the moon influ∣ences the water, has different powers near the land and at a great distance.</P>
<P>Another fact that seems to favor the hypothesis that electricity is the instrument of tides, is, the great irregularity of tides. In many instances there have been preternatural ebbings and flowings of the tide—sometimes the river Thames, for instance, has been left almost dry, for many hours, when there has been neither wind nor earthquake to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unt for the phenomenon.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>A recess of this kind is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tioned in 1114, when the Thames for the whole day, on the 15th of October, was so low, that children wa∣ded over between the Tower and London bridge. In 1247 there was a cessation of the flowing of the tides for three months, before a severe earthquake. See Short vol. 2. 145. I should not be inclined to credit these relations if modern observations did not serve to confirm them. On the 11th of March 1785 and 25th of January 1787, the Tiviat, a large river in the south of Scotland, receded and left its channel dry, in the former instance, <HI>two hours,</HI> and in the latter, <HI>four.</HI> No convulsion of the earth was known in that neighborhood, nor within two or three weeks of the first instance. As earthquake happened on the 26th of January, the day <HI>after</HI> the second instance, but could not be the cause. A similar recess happened on the day of the earthquake, in the river Clyde. On the 12th of September 1784, in perfectly calm weather, the water in the Lock Tay in Scotland suddenly ebbed 300 feet and left the channel dry, then flowed again, and thus alternately rose and fell for two hours. The same phenomenon, in a less degree, occur∣red in several succeeding days.</P>
<BIBL>Sinclair, vol 6. 624.</BIBL>
<P>The facts related of the sea and rivers in Holland on the day, but not at the hour, of the earthquake, at Lisbon, in 1755, when ships snapped their cables, and water dashed over the sides of vessels, without the least sensible motion of the earth, are strong proofs of the same insensi∣ble but immensely powerful action of the electricity of the globe. The swelling of the ocean in the time of earthquakes is not so much owing to the rising of the earth beneath, as to the force of electricity. The intumescence sometimes begins <HI>before</HI> the shock, as it does <HI>before</HI> hurri∣canes in the West-Indies.</P>
<P>In Scotland, during the great earthquakes in Calabria, in 1782, the water in the locks was agitated without any motion of the earth, and the mercury in the barometer fell within the tenth of an inch of the bottom of the scale. On the 12th of February 1787, the barometer at Edinburgh fell nearly to the same point.</P>
<P>These phenomena can be resolved into no cause but some operation of electricity, and they add much weight to my suspicions, that tides are governed by some laws of electricity, which are influenced by the phases of the moon.</P>
<P>The great fall of the barometer in Scotland is a strong evidence that the same energetic principle governs that instrument. It is absurd to suppose the atmosphere could have lost such a portion of its weight. Indeed it is far from being impossible that the rise and fall of the ba∣rometer may be occasioned by the force of electricity acting on the qicksilver itself.</P>
<P>If any person should hesitate to believe that a mere change in the combination of electricity and aerial substances, may vary the spring or elasticity, without the least alteration of their weight, let him attend to the different powers of wine, cyder or beer, before and after fer∣mentation begins. It is not presumable that the liquor has more weight in a state of fermentation, than when quiescent, before that process begins; yet the force with which it acts upon the cask con∣taining it, is increased perhaps a hundred fold. I suspect that the changes in the atmosphere which affect the barometer and the human body are analogous to what we observe in liquors—mere alterations in the combinations of the parts, producing various elastic powers, with∣out any change in the general gravity of the atmosphere. Hence it is easy to conceive that the elastic power of the atmosphere may be di∣versified by substances exhaled from the earth, in different situations; this may occasion small variations of the barometer in two distant places, having the same altitude, and be one cause of differences in the salubrity of the air.</P>
<P>This idea it still better illustrated by the different properties of gun∣powder in the kernel and in a state of explosion. In the former state, an immense elastic power is confined to a compass inconceivably small —by adding to it a spark of fire, this elastic power is set loose with tre∣mendous effects.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="036687_0680_100AA61E93BBAA90"/>These irregularities have invariably happened in years, which have been remarkable for electrical phenomena. To this point I have paid particular attention. They are not always attendant on earthquakes, or volcanic eruptions; but they occur in the same year, or near the same period; evidencing that when those visi∣ble discharges take place, insensible discharges take place in re∣mote countries, and on the opposite side of the globe.</P>
<P>Should it be admitted that electricity may be unequally dis∣tributed or operate with different forces, in various places, ac∣cording to its combinations with aerial substances, at different times, we may find some probable causes of the great diversity of diseases in the same year, as well as of the different heights of the barometer. The stimulus applied to the human body, may be different in various places, according to the predominant ope∣ration of one or more of the following causes.</P>
<P N="1">I. Soil, which may affect the air in various ways.</P>
<P N="2">II. Situation in regard to elevation, to water, hills, moun∣tains, minerals, fresh air.</P>
<P N="3">III. The population of places, and all the consequent evils of noxious exhalations.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The cultivation of a country, which has a most salutary effect on the atmosphere.</P>
<P>It is very certain that the condition of the atmosphere is very different, in places which appear to be equally favorable to
<PB N="326" REF="036687_0681_100AA62164362FF8"/>
health. Children and valetudinarians are very sensible of these differences. It is hardly possible to remove an indisposed person a distance of five miles, without a sensible effect on his health; be is better or worse in his new atmosphere. Under the combin∣ed operation of such various causes, we are not to be surprised at the irregularity in the appearance of autumnal and epidemic diseases.</P>
<P>Much labor has been employed to investigate the cause of sen∣sation and perception. The most able philosophers maintain the necessity of a medium through which we receive impressions of distant objects. The rays of light are supposed to be the me∣dium of vision, and an elastic air, the medium of sounds. But by what means impressions on one part of the body are almost instantaneously communicated to the other parts, may be a ques∣tion of difficult solution.</P>
<P>It appears to me probable that the medium by which impres∣sions are conveyed from one object to another, is that most elas∣tic fluid, the principle of fire or electricity, which pervades eve∣ry object and is diffused through creation. A motion given to this fluid in the brain is instantly conveyed, by its elastic prop∣erty, to the remotest fibre, and vice versa. The same fluid, diffused through the solar system, and all creation, may and probably is the medium by which distant orbs make impressions on each other.</P>
<P>It is absurd to suppose that the bodies that compose the solar system, or any other system of worlds, can be suspended in an immense void, and revolve about a common center, at distances of many millions of miles, without some medium of connection; some tie to bind them together. It is absurd to suppose that an influence can be exerted between them, unless thro the medium of a substance. This substance is doubtless that subtle, elastic fluid which constitutes the basis of fire, heat, light, or electricity. This fluid, receiving an impression from one globe, in any part of space, may impart it to another, in a few moments, by means of its elastic powers. This theory accords with the known prop∣erties of electricity; and affords a sublime idea of the magnifi∣cent structure of the universe.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="036687_0682_100AA62302228A10"/>The heat of a fever may proceed from the same fluid; and hence the value of water, as a conductor, to carry off the heat of a fever. In all fevers, this is the indication of cure given by nature. Hence the obvious and prime utility of perspiration, in the cure of pestilential fevers, which seize the very feat of life, the essential organs of the nervous system—parts of the body which medicins taken into the stomach do not easily reach. Perspiration and salivation, by throwing out moist and fluid sub∣stances, thus conducting the heat or electric principle to the sur∣face, seem to be the most certain remedies.</P>
<P>This elastic principle, if any thing, is the substance which has given rise to the doctrins of galvanism, animal magnetism— and Perkinism. But if those doctrins have any just foundation, the nature and modifications of the principle are so little under∣stood, that all attempts to reduce the doctrins to certainty or sys∣tem have hitherto been defeated. Primary causes elude all the researches of man, and compel him to acknowlege his ignorance.</P>

<HEAD>On the popular modes of guarding against infection.</HEAD>
<P>MANKIND have, in all ages, resorted to a variety of expedients to guard themselves from pestilential distempers, and to check them when existing. The use of aromatics as a <HI>pesti∣fuge,</HI> is as old as the journey of the Israelites from Egypt; for when the plague had broke out among them, Aaron took his censer, put on <HI>incense,</HI> and standing between the dead and living, the plague was stayed.</P>
<BIBL>Numb. xvi. 47.</BIBL>
<P>Herodian relates that in time of pestilence, the Romans stuf∣fed their nostrils with aromatics, but without success.</P>
<P>Mignot relates that the Turks, at this day, make great use of aromatics, to guard themselves from the plague.</P>
<BIBL>Hist. Turk. Emp. vol. 2.</BIBL>
<P>Diemerbroeck chewed tobacco as a preservative, and alleges many instances of its good effects. It is not improbable that this article, by promoting discharges of the saliva, may prevent the
<PB N="328" REF="036687_0683_100AA6248A44FB88"/>
noxious matter from entering the system by the sauces, which are principal agents in absorbing the poison. Any other herb that will promote spitting, would probably be equally salutary. Washing the mouth frequently with fresh water is very useful in the same way; and nurses should never inhale the effluvia of the sick, without immediately washing the mouth.</P>
<P>In our country, many similar expedients are employed toward off infection. Camphor is worn in little bags around the neck, or frequently applied to the nose.</P>
<P>It does not appear that aromatics and pungent salts have much effect in resisting the attacks of pestilence. There is probably no attraction between the particles of such substances and the poison of the plague. Stimulants are useful, in some cases, when applied to the whole body; but applied to the nose, their effect is local, and wholly inadequate to the purpose. A spoonful of fresh water, taken frequently into the mouth, and discharged, is better than a pound of camphor; for water mingles the infectious particles with its mass, and renders it harmless or carries it off.</P>
<P>It is possible however that, in some cases, an atmosphere im∣pregnated with the stimulating effluvia of spiceries may preserve the body from the attacks of this disease. An instance is related in Acta Eruditorum of the year 1721, published at Leipsic, that persons living near storehouses of spices escaped the plague. We should however be cautious of drawing conclusions from a single fact. The effect may have proceeded from an unsuspected cause.</P>
<P>Skenkius, from Alex. Benedictus, informs, that it is a cus∣tom among the Tartars in the Crimea, to kill their dogs in time of pestilence and suffer them to putrefy on the earth; alleging that the fetor arrests the plague by changing the air. Page 773. This is certainly a most singular remedy, and the fact requires good authority and explanation to induce belief. It however corresponds with some instances, in which pestilence has been least severe in filthy places.</P>
<P>The burning of powder is held to be useful in checking the plague, by generating respirable air. Lernnius, lib. 2. The blowing up of a magazine has been said to put a stop to pestilence.</P>
<P>During the civil wars in England, which ended in the death of Charles I. Fuller relates that the plague in Litchfield was
<PB N="329" REF="036687_0684_100AA626617EDC10"/>
arrested by the firing of cannon, at the siege of that town. The pious author says that many ascribed this to the <HI>purging of the air by the bullets,</HI> but divines ascribed it to God's good providence.</P>
<P>It is related in Van Swieten that the fermentation of wines on the Moselle, in time of vintage, had a most sensible effect in checking the plague.</P>
<P>It has been customary to burn resinous substances in the streets to stop the progress of pestilence, but without any sensible ef∣fect. It was attempted in Philadelphia in 1793 and in New-York in 1795, but the ill success has prevented a repetition of the attempt.</P>
<P>Authors relate that the ancient physicians put a stop to the plague, by enkindling large fires in the streets. I consider the fact as doubtful, for it is not agreed among writers, whether this was done by Hippocrates, or another man.</P>
<P>It was however on the strength of the story, that great fires were kindled in London in 1665; but the deaths were more nu∣merous on that night, than they had been before. If fire can be of any use in the plague, it must be by creating motion in a stag∣nant air, or by drying a moist one. The latter effect is that which Galen supposed to have resulted from the fires used by the ancients; and there may be situations and times, when a fire in infected houses may be applied to good purpose, by removing damp stagnated air. But it is questionable whether the atmos∣phere of a city can be sensibly and beneficially changed by public fires; and the experiment is very hazardous, for if the fire should be communicated to the buildings, it would not only con∣sume property, but double the rage of pestilence. Thus the plague in Constantinople in 1539 was greatly inflamed by a fire which consumed a large part of the city. Fatigue and distress, added to the previous causes, multiplied the new cases, and one third of the inhabitants perished.</P>
<BIBL>Mignot's Hist. Turk. Emp. vol. 2.</BIBL>
<P>Every thing which collects, fatigues and alarms people, at such times, is very prejudicial; as the fire in Philadelphia, in 1793; in Providence, in 1797, and the launching of the frigate in Baltimore, in the epidemic of the latter year.</P>
<P><PB N="330" REF="036687_0685_100AA62AA4C0D810"/>The only effectual safety is in flight. When a few cases of the plague first appear, they should be removed, or other precautions taken to prevent my ill effects from infection.

But if these precautions prove fruitless, as they usually will, and as they <HI>always</HI> will, when the disease is the effect of an atmospheric principle, which is the fact, nineteen times in twenty, the only certain means of security, are in quitting the city.

<HEAD>On Venesection.</HEAD>
<P>THE extensive mortality occasioned by the plague, the ra∣pidity of the disease, and the virulence of its poison, which often defies all medical aid, have called forth all the exertions of talents and knowlege, to invent some mode of defeating its ravages.</P>
<P>It is agreed on all hands, that perspiration, if induced on the first seizure of the patient, is the most effectual prescription. Hence the universal use of alexipharmics in pestilence.</P>
<P>But it often happens, that no application whatever will excite perspiration, and especially, in the later stages of the disease.</P>
<P>No part of the practice of medicin has excited such warm controversies, as venesection. It is foreign from my plan to dis∣cuss this question; my remarks are intended rather to explain the cause of this diversity of opinions, from my observations on historical facts.</P>
<P>Most of the medical writers who were personally acquainted with the true plague, in former ages, when it frequently over∣spread Europe, have decided against bleeding.</P>
<P>In the plague which ravaged all France in 1565, Charles IX. then king, demanded of all the physicians to give information of the best mode of treatment, and they unanimously decided against the practice of bleeding liberally.</P>
<BIBL>Skenkius, p. 770.</BIBL>
<P><PB N="331" REF="036687_0686_100AA62C2C029230"/>Ambrosius Paraeus, in the same plague, made extensive en∣quiry, as to the success of bleeding and purging, the answer of his medical friends was, that in all cases, these evacuations, if powerful, were fatal.</P>
<BIBL>Sennertus, p. 356.</BIBL>
<P>Forestus, observed, in the plague of 1557, at Delph, that those all died, who were bled after twelve hours from the inva∣sion of the disease. Palmerius has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to the same effect, and so has J. Ant. Sarracenus, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cribing a plague in Ge∣neva.</P>
<P>Fallopius remarked in the plague which raged from 1524 to 1530, that all died who were bled. This was observed also by H. Florentus, a physician of Leyden—by Simonius, in the plague of 1602—Hildanus, in the plague at Lausanne, and a multitude of others. See them collected in Diemerbroeck, de peste, 130. and sequel, who found in the plague at Nimeguen "venesection∣em damnosissimam fuisse"—bleeding was extremely injurious.</P>
<P>On the other hand, we have in the same author a long list of names of eminent physicians, who warmly advocate venesection. To this list may be added the name of the celebrated Sydenham.</P>
<P>The source of this difference of opinion is doubtless the dif∣ference of the symptoms in the disease under different constitu∣tions of air, in different places, and in different habits. The great difference in the same disease, under different epidemic con∣stitutions, was most distinctly observed by Sydenham; and this variety seems to constitute no small nor easy part of the physician's investigation.</P>
<P>Sydenham observed what is undoubtedly true, that the same disease is characterized with different symptoms, under different conditions of the air; and often the same apparent state of air produces very different diseases. It is very evident, that the <HI>vi∣sible</HI> qualities of the seasons are not the <HI>only</HI> circumstances that modify diseases. The learned Boyle remarks the great diversity in plagues, requiring remedies altogether different.</P>
<BIBL>Vol. 5. p. 60.</BIBL>
<P>Hence at one time, the plague, in a few hours after invasion, induces a state of debility, in which bleeding will, in almost eve∣ry case, accelerate death. At other times, the disease may main∣tain,
<PB N="332" REF="036687_0687_100AA62DC6921D18"/>
for two or three days, a highly inflammatory diathesis, in which a timely, and judicious use of the lancet may prevent a fa∣tal termination.</P>
<P>I am persuaded that history will justify these remarks, and make practitioners very cautious of prescribing for the name of a dis∣ease. This caution is more especially necessary on the first ap∣pearance of an epidemic before the ruling type of the disease is fully manifested. The doctrins of Sydenham, in regard to the controlling influence of different constitutions of air, seem not to have been studied and pursued, with the diligence due to their importance. They are the basis of an interesting branch of phi∣losophy as well as medicin; being grounded on those varieties in∣cident to the same object, which characterize all the works of creation—varieties which constitute the revolutions in the <HI>same</HI> disease, analogous to those already described in a <HI>series</HI> of epi∣demics and in many other phenomena of the world.</P>

<HEAD>On Vapor or Mephitic Air, extricated from the earth by means of discharges of the electrical fluid.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE suggested in the preceding pages, that epidemic diseases may be sometimes occasioned by a vapor extricated from the earth. That such has been the fact in cases of earthquakes, has been proved by several examples; that a deleterious vapor may be expelled from the earth and produce diseases, without a concussion, appears from the case at Rouen in 1753, and the sickness and death of fish are strong evidences of the truth of the principle. Other considerations lead to the same result.</P>
<P>In the account which Sir W. Hamilton has given of the eruption of Vesuvius in 1794, Univ. Mag. Oct. 1795, it is ob∣served, that "after every eruption of that volcano we read of damage done by mephitic air, which coming from under the an∣cient lava, insinuates itself into low places, as cellars and wells near the foot of the mountain." Several instances happened af∣ter the eruption of 1767, of persons going into cellars and being struck down with this vapor, who would have died, without as∣sistance.
<PB N="333" REF="036687_0688_100AA6307280AE30"/>
This vapor on an open plain subsides near the earth, being heavier than common air; but it fills cellars, wells and hollow places, so as to endanger life, and actually proves fatal to birds, beasts, and vegetables; sometimes to men. This vapor or fixed air is generated by the action of vitriolic acid on calca∣reous earth; and by other means in the immense laboratory of Nature's works.</P>
<P>The facts here stated and which are well known to every chymist, will perhaps account for the <HI>damps</HI> in wells, as this fixed air is called in popular language. It is a common idea that air will become impregnated with this vapor, by mere stag∣nation in a well. This is probably a mistake. Nor is it proba∣ble that any substances in the well generate this air. It cannot proceed from water, nor from the earth, or stones, or rocks which compose the sides of the well, unless the earth is different from common earth. It is probable therefore that this mephitic vapor is expelled from the earth by force of internal heat or elec∣trical fire; and that this happens not uniformly, or at any certain times. I suspect that the discharge of it happens at particular times in various parts of the earth, from causes not yet explain∣ed; and that it occasions epidemic diseases among men, beasts and fishes. To aid us in an enquiry of this kind, it would be necessary to examin a great number of facts, and discover whether this mephitic vapor is ever found in wells, except when epidemic diseases of some sort or other prevail among animals.</P>
<P>On the 30th of August 1795, just after the pestilential fever appeared in New-York, two men fell victims to this vapor, in a well belonging to a brewery in Pine-street, within a few yards of the house where I then resided. The well had been dug but a few months, and was not used, but covered over with boards. It was about 25 or 30 feet deep, contained a few feet of water, and was so full of mephitic vapor, that a candle was extinguished within eight feet of the surface of the earth, as I found by ex∣periment. This was during the sickness, and a question arises whether the two things were connected in cause. Had not a similar vapor been silently thrown from the bowels of the earth, over all the coast and region from New-Jersey to Connecticut,
<PB N="334" REF="036687_0689_100AA63325032C88"/>
for some months previous? And may not the sickness of the oysters and shad on that coast, from 1794 to 1796, as well as the destructive epidemic angina, fevers and dysentery, be ascrib∣ed to that cause? I offer this hint to excite enquiry. Gov. El∣lis, in a paper on the subject of hurricanes, Museum, vol. 9. 215, mentions, among the precursors of those tempests, thick vapors in the air "sensibly mephitic." If this vapor is the cause of diseases, it will account for the greater prevalence of them in low situations.</P>
<P>There is reason to suspect that this mephitic air is expelled from the earth, in considerable quantities, at particular times, but incorporating itself with the common air, it does not often prove fatal to men, altho it may lessen the vital powers of the atmosphere, and aid in the production of diseases.</P>
<P>In 1729, on the 19th of July, a Mr. Adams of Boston and his servant perished by this air in a well. Let it be observed that in this year, the influenza spread over Europe. Whether it was in America or not, I cannot learn; but the measles was epidemic in Boston, in that year; and other parts of America were sickly.</P>
<P>But what among other things inclines me to the opinion that this species of air is not generated gradually in wells, but is ex∣pelled from the earth suddenly, is a fact related in the same pa∣per with the foregoing, Baddam's Mem. vol. 9. 4. Phil. Trans. 411; that on the 9th of May preceding this accident, two men at work in a well in School-street, Boston, were suddenly at∣tacked by this species of vapor, and came near losing their lives. The well had recently been dug and enlarged, the workmen ex∣periencing no inconvenience; and that the vapor did not proceed from opening a new chasm, or breaking a new stratum of earth or minerals, is certain; for the men were not the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> digging, but stoning the sides of the well.</P>
<P>In Philosophical Transactions, No. 119, it is said that damps are generally observed to come about the end of May, and to continue during the heat of summer. At that season also they are most violent in mines infested with them, during the whole year. But by a subsequent paragraph, it appears that the writer
<PB N="335" REF="036687_0690_100AA634CC45C4F8"/>
in that remark made no distinction between fixed air and inflam∣mable.</P>
<P>If it is true that this vapor is expelled from the earth in spring and summer only or principally, to what cause shall we ascribe that circumstance? Not to internal heat certainly, for that at the depth of 20 feet is always the same. We may perhaps find a solution in the excited atmosphere of summer, which may oc∣casion discharges of electricity.</P>
<P>It might be well for the world, if experiments were made to ascertain these points. If a vapor is at times thrown into the at∣mosphere from the internal parts of the earth, and becomes nox∣ious to health, it is of great consequence to the world to know the fact, as this air subsides into the lower grounds, and might often be avoided. A deep covered well and not used, might be kept for this purpose, and a lighted candle or lamp let down to its bottom once a month. If there had been a discharge of me∣phitic air, it would be found in the well; but if the air of the well should be found good, we might conclude that the atmos∣phere had received no taint from subterranean vapor.</P>
<P>This subject deserves investigation. The herbage is at times affected by a dew or clammy substance, which is visible, tangible and offensive to cattle. Instances have been related in the pre∣ceding history. The honey-dew is a curious phenomenon, not well understood. This is a substance that resembles honey or wax, deposited on the leaves of trees, and attaching itself to blades of corn. It is sweet to the taste, and the honey-bee is seen to feed upon it. To corn it is very prejudicial, by causing a blast.</P>
<P>I have not been able to ascertain whether this is a periodical or an accidental phenomenon, nor to find the causes of it in the known properties of air or water. Is it the produce of a vapor from the earth; or of some unusual combination of aerial sub∣stances?</P>
<P>We live in a fluid, composed of various ingredients, each of which has its own properties, and by various combinations, and incessant changes, these ingredients are daily generating new prop∣erties. One day, the sky is calm and cloudless; the next, the
<PB N="336" REF="036687_0691_100AA637F8B56CF0"/>
heavens are wrapped in vapor, and the earth deluged with rain. One moment, we are shrouded in chaotic darkness; the next presents to us the heavens and earth in a sheet of livid flame. In∣stantaneous is the transition from the silence of the grave to peals of thunder that shake the earth beneath our feet; and the field that smiles with its golden fruits, to day, is to-morrow torn with the raging tempest, stripped of its beauties, and converted into a barren waste.</P>
<P>Immersed in elements productive of these sudden and tremen∣dous effects, how is it possible that man should pass through life without feeling inconveniencies from principles capable of such as∣tonishing vicissitudes? Instead of wondering at the phenomenon of pestilence and other epidemic diseases, and hunting, with mi∣croscopic view, for a bundle of clothes in which to find the germ of a malady that desolates the earth, men would show more wis∣dom and more correct understanding, if they would collect facts, with care, examin them with candor, and endeavor by this pro∣cess to arrive at some knowlege of the powers and effects of those elements which compose all animal bodies, and from whose ope∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ations are immediately derived all the vital energies. There we may find, altho we may not be able to comprehend, principles of disease as powerful and as universal as the laws of nature.</P>

<HEAD>On the revolution of certain Comets.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE this work has been in the press, I have had the curiosity to trace back the revolutions of two or three comets, whose periods were calculated by Dr. Halley, to find how far his astronomical calculations are verified by the history of the ap∣pearance of comets, in former ages. The following are the re∣sults.</P>
<P>The comet of 1682 Dr. Halley found to have a period of 75 years. If this calculation is exact, the same comet must have appeared in the following years. The first column contains the years when the comet must have appeared, supposing its period to be exactly 75 years—the second, contains the years when a comet appeared, according to the preceding history.</P>

<P>I have found no mention of a comet in 1231, 1156, 1081, 931, 781, 706; but the physical phenomena at those periods, as severe winters, inundations, earthquakes, pestilence, &amp;c. ren∣der it more than probable that a comet was visible, in those years, or in the next preceding or following. In some other periods, a comet is mentioned in the next year, to that which is designat∣ed
<PB N="338" REF="036687_0693_100AA63CAD9D0080"/>
in the first column; but I take this difference to proceed from the fractions of a year—the period of the comet not being exactly a year.</P>
<P>If these calculations and facts may be relied on, this comet must have appeared in the year 256, in the midst of the mortal pestilence, in the reign of Gallus and Volusian, and in the year 31 or 32, a little before the crucifixion of our Savior.</P>
<P>The calculations respecting the return of the comet of 1661 coincide remarkably with historical facts. Its period is supposed to be 129 years. If so, then it must have appeared in the years named in the first of the following columns—the second column contains the years when a comet did actually appear, according to the history in the first volume.</P>

<P>I have no account of a comet in 887; but in page 112 of Vol. I. a severe plague and hard winter are mentioned, under that year. The events related in page 77, under the years 242 and 3, are such as lead me to suspect a comet, at that period, which corresponds with the calculations; but I have no account of any. The same remarks may be made respecting the events of the years 114 to 117, when Antioch was destroyed, as re∣lated page 70.</P>
<P>Of the events before Christ 16, I have no particular account. The three preceding periods of this comet, before Christ 145, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>74, and 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3, correspond with great pestilence. See pages 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

and 43—48—56 of Vol. I. And this might have been the star alluded to by Justin, in the passage quoted in page 43.</P>
<P>But we have an insuperable difficulty to these calculations—this star, if its period is 129 years, should have appeared in 1789 or 90; but no comet was seen. One appeared in the autumn of 1788, but I know not whether the elements of its trajectory corresponded with those of the star of 1661. Calculations of this kind are yet too uncertian to be the basis of a system.</P>
<P>It is greatly to be desired that the revolutions of the comets could be reduced to as much certainty, as those of the planets. Such calculations would enable as to account for many of the vi∣olent changes on this globe; and aid us to fix the era of certain great phenomena of antiquity: For no fact is better established, than that comets have a prodigious influence on the electricity of the earth and its atmosphere.</P>
<P>The comet of 1680 is supposed to have a period of 575; and the appearance of a splendid star of this kind in 1105 and 531, gives reason to believe the calculation just. If so, it must have appeared before Christ 44—619—1194—1769 and 2344. The latter year falls within 8 years of the period assigned to the del∣uge. But the uncertainty of ancient chronology leaves room to question all results from these calculations.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>IN the course of my investigations into the origin of the bilious plague, I have had so many opportunities to detect the error<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pro∣ceeding from <HI>common report,</HI> that I am led to question every fact that does not come directly from the persons concerned in the transaction related. I had such confidence, for instance, in the facts published and believed by the people in New-Haven, re∣specting the origin of the fever of 1794, in that city, from im∣ported sources, that I had prepared an account of it for the press, before I called on the persons best able to give me correct information. On examination, I was surprised to find most of the supposed facts totally unfounded: and Mr. Gorham and Capt. Truman, the persons concerned, when informed of the reports which had been circulated on the subject, expressed their surprise that people should have propagated such tales, without calling on them for a true state of facts.</P>
<P>It was said and published that Polly Gorham, the <HI>second</HI> per∣son seized with the fever, was present in Mr. Austin's store when the chest of clothes was opened. The gentleman who published this report, has since informed me that he had no authority for it, but the story of a child of six or seven years old. But Capt. Truman who opened the chest himself informs me, that Polly Gorham was <HI>not</HI> in the store at the time.</P>
<P>It was reported and is still believed, by most of the people in the town, that Isaac Gorham's wife washed infected clothes; but Mr. Gorham assures me that there is not the least foundation for the story, and he is astonished that such a tale could have been circulated. He cannot assign any good cause for the fever in his family, and is inclined to the opinion that no infection was received from the sloop.</P>
<P>It is possible and probable that some persons who came in the
<PB N="341" REF="036687_0696_100AA644968749C8"/>
sloop had been into Gorham's house; at least into the shop in the front room. And this is the only possible way to account for the propagation of infection from that sloop, even admitting that it contained infected clothing. But even in this case, it would seem strange that Gorham himself should escape, and his wife and niece who were usually in the back room, should con∣tract disease. But the following facts which have been re∣ceived from Capt. Truman, since the first volume was printed, will show the improbability, if not the impossibility, of such a communication of infection.</P>
<P>This sloop, called the Iris, arrived from Martinico at New-York in May. All her men and passengers were and had been, during the passage, in good health. The sloop of course was permitted to enter as a clean vessel, and she was hauled up to a wharf, where she lay ten or twelve days wind-bound, before she could proceed to New-Haven. She had no cargo on board, except a few salted hides, which were taken out and put on board of a coaster, commanded by Capt. Miles to be transported to New-Haven. This was done without the least injury to any person concerned in removing the hides. At this time happened a long series of easterly winds and rainy weather, succeeding the memorable frost after the 17th of May 1794. In these rains the vessel was washed incessantly day after day, and she was visited by many persons who had business on board; and as it happens with all vessels that lie at a wharf in such a place, hundreds, if not thousands must have been on board, while she lay at New-York. Now it happens that not a soul among all that were on board, from the time of her leaving Martinico, till she arrived at New-Haven, was affected with fever. How the sloop or the hands, after having intercourse with so many persons, came to reserve their infection for New-Haven, I submit to be determined by wiser heads than mine. The facts are here stated from the in∣formation of the persons concerned—those which have been be∣fore published, are mingled and confounded with popular rumors which can be traced to no genuin sources.</P>
<P>Let it be noted that when the two first persons were seized, no person suspected the disease to be the yellow fever. Mrs.
<PB N="342" REF="036687_0697_100AA6472E37B210"/>
Gorham probably died without ever knowing her disease—at least her physician did not suspect it, till she vomited black matter, the evening before her death. Hence it happened that no enquiry into the origin of the fever, took place till several days after∣wards, and not till after the death of Mr. Austin and his clerk. This is one reason why it became difficult to obtain a true state of facts—a difficulty that was greatly increased by the alarm and consequent perturbation of the public mind.</P>
<P>And after all the question of domestic or foreign origin is much better decided by the character and phenomena of the epidemic, than by any human testimony relating to things not visible. The case of a bilious fever, attended with black vomit, men∣tioned in page 306 of Vol. I. occurred in the last week in March, near the wharf and in the center of the ground, afterwards the seat of the fever. It was less malignant than in autumn, but from the description of it given me by the woman's mother and the attending clergyman [the physician being dead] I must con∣clude the disease to have been of the same species, and indica∣ting a disposition in the atmosphere of the place to give to fever that particular character.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The physician, Dr. Hubbard, after the fever appeared in summer, mentioned to the Rev. Mr. Hubbard, that it was of the same species with that which occurred in March. This case was nine or ten weeks before the arrival of the Iris.</NOTE> The scarlatina was then the current epidemic. In May this declined, and gradually disappeared, in June and July, as the yellow fever advanced. To a philosophic mind, these facts amount to evidence of domestic origin, that far out-weighs the uncertain and contradictory evidence of the importation of a substance which is neither visible nor tangible.</P>
<P>With respect to the origin of the fever at Hartford, I have this further evidence. The sloop mentioned in page 347, had never been in the least infected with any disease whatever, before she arrived at Hartford. Her former Captain died in May of a lingering com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ He went to New-York after he was unwell and growing worse, he returned and died at home. Captain Tucker then took the command, went to New-York and took on board a cargo of salt. From thence he sailed to New-Ha∣ven, where he lay five or six days, at the wharf, endeavoring to
<PB N="343" REF="036687_0698_100AA648B75B5B30"/>
fell the salt. While there, people indiscriminately were on board, and among them several gentlemen of my acquaintance who give me this information. This was about the middle of July, and as it was just after the Neptune arrived from China, the wharf was unusually crouded with people, who were passing and repas∣sing between the wharf and that ship. Here then the sloop did no mischief. She went to Hartford and discharged her salt. I have unequivocal evidence that not a person concerned in un∣loading her, was affected with fever, and that several of the per∣sons first seized in Hartford, had not been near her. After she left Hartford the captain and mate were seized, and the former died [not both as stated in page 347.]</P>
<P>Another vessel, I find, has by some been suspected of introdu∣cing the fever into Hartford. This also was a coasting vessel, which took in a passenger at New-York, who sickened, after he came on board, and the master landed him at New-Haven. If I am rightly informed, this vessel did not arrive at Hartford, un∣til after the first cases of fever occurred; but of this I am not certain. Certain it is, that no person on board, except the passen∣ger landed at New-Haven, was ever ill, and therefore the case deserves no consideration.</P>
<P>It ought further to be stated that two or three weeks before the alarm at Hartford, and before the arrival of those vessels, a case of fever occured of the malignant kind, and in all essential points, with the character of the yellow fever. I have lately learnt that a similar fact occurred in Boston in 1798. These cases are not usually numbered with those of yellow fever—but the truth is, and such will it appear to be, when science, philosophy and candor shall triumph over prejudice and popular tales, that these milder cases of fever, bearing the character in a degree, of the subsequent epidemic, are the precursors of the disease to fol∣low—they are the effect of the atmospheric principle on partic∣ular susceptible constitutions, before the proper season for the full force of the principle to operate—they are irresistible evidence that the diseases which they precede, are usually, if not always, generated in the place where they exist.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="036687_0699_100AA64CE55F8528"/>SINCE the first volume was printed, I have obtained from attending physicians, an account of the fever at Middle-Haddam, in the town of Chatham, on Connecticut river in 1796. [This is mentioned in page 331 to have been in 1797, but it was in 1796.]</P>
<P>This fever was traced in every instance to a vessel from a port in Hispaniola, which was highly infected. No person was af∣fected, without direct intercourse with the vessel, the clothing or the sick. About 30 persons were affected, eight of whom died. When carried to a distance, the fever did not spread.</P>
<P>That this was a disease contracted from imported infection is evident from this circumstance—that in every case it could be traced to intercourse with the sick or infected articles—it was not taken by passing along the street nor from house to house. A∣nother fact is equally demonstrative of this origin; which is, that it commenced late in September and had no precursors. When it arises from the atmosphere of the place, it always be∣gins as early as August or earlier—and this is probably true of every autumnal complaint in our latitude.</P>
<P>The fever in that place therefore was what I call a <HI>disease of mere infection,</HI> in contradistinction from yellow fever originating in the country, which begins uniformly in the hot months, is taken without intercourse with the sick or with infected articles, has its precursors and absorbs all other diseases or gives them all its predominant type. The distinction is so obvious that it is not easy to mistake it.</P>
<P>Of the diseases from imported source this is one—two or three other instances in the United States have been mentioned. But most of the instances of this fever in America, since 1790, have had the unequivocal characters of epidemics—such charac∣ters as never attend, and as cannot possibly attend, diseases of mere infection.</P>
<P>IN the summer past, the wild pigeons in the western parts of New-York state and in Pennsylvania, have been affected with a dis∣ease of which many have died. It is understood that the head or neck was swelled; but I have no correct account of the distemper.</P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="036687_0700_100AA64B39D18F38"/>FROM the report of a master of a vessel, it appears that fish of various kinds perished in September or October last, on the Carolina coast from Cape Look-out to Cape Fear, a distance of 70 miles. Some were seen dead and others dying, as far as the eye could reach. The yellow fever has also prevailed in some parts of both Carolinas. Does not the death of fish afford reason to believe that the electrical fluid or mephitic air, is occa∣sionally discharged from the earth in unusual abundance? And may not local diseases be ascribed to that cause?</P>
<P>IN addition to what I have said in the 16th section, rela∣tive to predisposition to a particular disease, I would observe, that we ought to make a distinction between a <HI>natural aptitude to a disease,</HI> and an <HI>adventitious liability</HI> to it, from artificial causes. The latter is what usually passes under the name of <HI>predisposition:</HI> And this may lead to error. When persons say, a man will not take a fever by infection unless he is predisposed, they usually mean that he has, by accidental causes, <HI>prepared</HI> his body to be affected. Hence we continually hear the doctrin that infection will not operate in a healthy atmosphere; but in order to give it force and effect, the atmosphere must be <HI>prepared;</HI> that is, must suffer a change favorable to a disease, but not sufficient to pro∣duce it.</P>
<P>I apprehend this doctrin is erroneous. The fact, as a gene∣ral one, is the reverse; and the longer a body remains in health in an infected atmosphere, the less liable is it to the disease. So true is this, that prisoners in jails suffer no injury from the air, which will destroy the lives of men who enter it, from fresh air. This fact is well known. It is equally true, in our cities, du∣ring pestilence, that persons from fresh air, are much more liable to be seized, on entering the infected atmosphere, than those who have lived in it. Hence in every case of mere infection, persons are <HI>most exposed</HI> to it, who are <HI>least prepared</HI> or <HI>predisposed</HI> by breathing an infected air.</P>
<P>But not such is the fact with regard to the influence of atmos∣pheric
<PB N="346" REF="036687_0701_100AA651399B48B0"/>
causes on particular bodies. In this case, the cause singles out and seizes the persons, who have a particular aptitude or habit of body, in a manner altogether unaccountable. Sometimes this power is evidently in operation a long time, before it pro∣duces disease.</P>
<P>Perhaps this natural aptitude of a body to receive or resist disease, may be illustrated by the following fact, which is under every man's observation. Let two apples or pears, be taken from a tree at the same time—let them be apparently alike in soundness and in every particular on which their preservation may be supposed to depend. Lay them by the side of each other—equally exposed to heat and moisture. In this case, one may and often will perish many weeks before the other. This aptitude to perish is natural, and doubtless consists in the interior organization of the fruit; but this is utterly invisible, even with the best microscope.</P>
<P>This idea seems to be important towards accounting for the operation of a pestilential atmosphere on various bodies, and is confirmed by the facts related of pestilence that has seized par∣ticular families or tribes of men, while others, equally exposed, have escaped. This may be called natural predisposition or ap∣titude to a disease, in distinction from that state of the body which is the effect of artificial or accidental causes, and which may be the commencement of the disease, according to Brown's definition.</P>
<P>SINCE the first volume was put to press, I have collected from various authors, accounts of several plagues in Egypt, which I had not then found. As I have suggested that pesti∣lence is usually marked by catarrh, it may be proper to lay to∣gether further evidence of the fact. Egypt and Constantinople are the places where autumnal fevers are most apt to take the form of pestilence. Catarrh, in those cities, seems closely to attend the plague. Witness the following examples.</P>

<P>There are some long periods in which I have no account of the diseases. The plague of 1705 in Egypt is the only one of which I have an account, that I cannot trace to a connection with uni∣versal catarrh; and I have no account of a plague in Egypt after the influenza of 1709. I ascribe this however to the imperfec∣tion of my accounts. How greatly to be regretted is the want of accurate and complete registers of epidemic diseases!</P>
<P>Let this detail of authentic facts, be compared with what eve∣ry man may recollect in America. How the present series of plagues was introduced by a double portion of catarrh! for the influenza of 1789 was followed in 1790 by another influenza— the only instance I can find on record of two of these epidemics within the short space of six or eight months! Let it be recollec∣ted also that catarrh was prevalent in the spring of 1791, 1793 and 1798, and that in our large cities, pestilence has in every instance, been introduced or followed [or both] by influenza, which has some∣times been local, that is, very much limited to the place where the pestilence had prevailed or was to prevail. Who then can deny that catarrh and plague are connected in cause? It is not pos∣sible to deny it—the evidence is conclusive—and when this sub∣ject shall be fully investigated, it will appear that pestilence, whether plague or yellow fever, is produced by the same general change in the properties of the air, which produces influenza—the tran∣sit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="349" REF="036687_0704_100AA659DE7535F0"/>
from the one epidemic to the other being caused by the sea∣sons, or other unknown cause.</P>
<P>I learn from a communication of the British Consul at Alex∣andria, that it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alculated a mill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on of people had perished by the plague in Upper and Lower Egypt between 1795 and 1796; and our accounts from that country, mention that the disease had not ceases, the last spring; that is, it returned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the proper season. I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seems therefore that pestilence in Africa runs cotem∣poraneous with pestilence in America.</P>
<P>I have recently learnt from Irwin's Travels, that there was no plague in Egypt from 1770 to 1777, and from other writers I collect that it was not there for two or three years after. This is a remarkable fact, as Egypt is seldom exempt longer than five years in one period. Now it will be remarked that in the same period, and for some time before and after, no epidemic infec∣tious yellow fever occurred in America, nor as far as I can learn, in the West-India Islands. Yet this was a time of war between Great-Britain, America and France.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">No comet was seen between 1770 and 1784—a period of more than thirteen years—such an interval had not happened within 150 years, and probably not in three centuries.</NOTE> But it is a curious fact, that in those parts of the earth most subject to pestilence, the plague and yellow fever should have disappeared at the same time; and in countries 5000 miles distant, certain kinds of diseases should have lost that peculiar character which distinguishes the plague.</P>
<P>But the history of epidemics furnishes numerous instances of similar revolutions in the prevailing type or character of diseases.</P>
<P>In Mr. Tytler's Treatise on the plague and yellow fever, which I have just read, I find a passage, in page 379, which asserts that certain quotations in my letters to Dr. Currie in 1797 were made "with a view to dispute the contagious nature of the yel∣low fever." This is not accurate. My view was to prove a me∣terial difference in the yellow fever at different times, and to show certain inconsistencies in the reasoning of my antagonist.</P>
<P><PB N="350" REF="036687_0705_100AA65B66E76190"/>It is proper now to mention that I wrote those letters, with a view if possible, to settle the question of the origin of the yellow fever, by a fair statement of facts and fair conclusions from the facts. I had not then attended to the history of epidemics; and it will be seen by one of my letters, that I had embraced the popular opinion then current, that the influenza in 1789 and 1790 was a new disease. Since I have studied this subject, I am sur∣prised not only at my own ignorance, but at the ignorance of all classes of men, in whatever regards the history of epidemic diseases, and the physical phenomena of the earth and atmos∣phere. On this subject and whatever regards the origin of the plague and yellow fever, Mr. Tytler's Treatise has disappointed my hopes and expections. His history of pestilence is from first to last imperfect and inaccurate. And how it is possible for a man to suppose that the plague was originally sent upon the Jews as a punishment, and by them has been conveyed to other nations, p. 47. or that the plague in Rome in the year 80 was occasioned by infection conveyed from Jerusalem, by the army of Titus in the year 70. p. 13. 45. 50. Or that it is of divine original, p. 369, any more than all other distempers—Or that it has been usually propagated by war and commerce p. 369, when it is evi∣dent from scripture that it was a disease in Egypt, before the days of Moses—and has in every age infested nations who had no in∣tercourse with the Jews—when also it is expressly declared by Livy and Orosious to have been usually in Rome in time of peace—I say, how it is possible, in this period of the world, for such opinions to exist, I cannot conceive.</P>
<P>On the subject of contagion also, or rather infection, Mr. Tytler, has adopted the common theory—a theory acknowleged to be inadequate to the solution of the phenomena of pestilence, as plague and yellow fever always cease, at the proper season, when the infection is most general.</P>
<P>The results of my investigations will explain most, if not all, the difficulties attending this subject.</P>
<P>The origin of pestilence is traced to essential changes in the at∣mosphere, which recur at certain unequal periods. The evi∣dence of these changes are certain epidemic diseases, as measles,
<PB N="351" REF="036687_0706_100AA65D0F0DCE38"/>
affections of the throat, and especially influenza, which pervades the globe or large portions of it within a few months or at most, in two years. Near the time of these phenomena, and usually subsequent to the influenza, the plague occurs in Egypt and Con∣stantinople, and if the change in the atmosphere is very great, the plague occurs in all parts of the Levant and in other parts of Africa, Europe and Asia. At the same time, in the more cool and healthy regions of the north, epidemics of a milder type than the plague, but malignant and infectious, prevail, and in short, ordinary diseases assume new and more fatal symptoms. In America, the same or similar changes are observed. The fe∣ver of the West-Indies, which is usually not infectious, becomes more malignant and assumes in a degree the character of the plague. In our large cities, the autumnal remitting fever is changed into the same malignant form, and the country suffers by measles, scar∣latina, dysentery, typhus and remitting fevers. These changes usually take place in both hemispheres at the same time; but sometimes the pestilential principle seems to be more severe on one continent or in one country, than in another</P>
<P>These changes are usually distinguished by visible and remark∣able phenomena in the natural world.</P>
<P>The periods of pestilence are unequal and indefinite—some∣times of only five or six years duration; at other times, extend∣ing to ten or fifteen years. But in the latter case, the epidemics mentioned usually run through a country twice—that is, two pestilential periods occur, without an interval of time.</P>
<P>During these periods, contagion and infection aid the propaga∣tion of certain diseases, particularly the measles, small-pox, whooping cough and angina maligna. In the dysentery, yellow fever and plague, infection has its effect and obviously spreads the diseases. But all those diseases originate without infection, in all countries where the heat, moisture or other local cause will permit the disease to exist. In some cases, they are introduced and spread solely by infection, but they are then always within human control, and it is the fault of man, if the sphere of their operation is not very limited. In most cases, these diseases have the unequivocal characters of local epidemics, and no human power can restrain them.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="036687_0707_100AA65FCD38E340"/>On the subject of cure, if I may be permitted to have an opin∣ion, I should concur with Mr. Tytler in the preference of the diaphoretic method. Circumstances may indeed defeat this meth∣od, and compel the physician to adopt others. But from the in∣dications of nature, and the immense capacity of vapor to ab∣sorb heat, I take perspiration to be the natural remedy for fever.</P>
<P>On the subject of the proximate cause of the plague, the opin∣ions of Mr. Tytler are highly respectable. I fully agree with him in the influence of the electrical fluid. I believe this active and elastic principle to be the great agent in all the changes visi∣ble and invisible, in our atmosphere, and I cannot but think my investigations have unlocked very important secrets on that point. I believe also that this fluid is the immediate agent in supporting life, and the intellectual powers. Received into the lungs, it supplies the body with heat, and by its elastic power, dilates those organs of life to receive new supplies. The machinery of the body is thus calculated, while it lasts, to preserve perpetual motion. At the same time, this fluid, by the same elastic power, becomes the medium of sensation, throughout the nervous system, and by its instantaneous motions, communicates sensation and thought, with the celerity of lightning.</P>
