<BIBL>ISAIAH, Chap. xl. Verse 11.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>He shall feed his flock like a shep∣herd, he shall gather the lambs with his arms, and car∣ry them in his bosom.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MANY of you, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> little friends, have spent your plea∣santest hours amidst the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the garden, and the flow∣ers of the field: and have you
<PB N="4" REF="047686_0004_10243DDD78D7B648"/>
not, in your little rambles, seen the skipping lambs looking inno∣cently gay, and sporting by the side of their dams? It delighted you to see them thus happy, and enjoying themselves in the cheerful sunshine; but perhaps at other times, you have seen the tender creatures exposed to stormy winds, or pinching frost; your little hearts have pi∣tied them, and been ready to fear that the severity of the winter would destroy them. In this distressed situation, how delightful to see the kind shep∣herd come to their relief, gather them together, and lead them to a place of shelter and safety!</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="047686_0005_10243DDFD9445688"/>
Delightful indeed! to see him take up the tender and fee∣ble in his arms, and carry them in his bosom, till the little crea∣tures are revived and cherish∣ed; but, children, I can tell you a more pleasing and won∣derful thing than this. You have heard of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> the Son of God, who came down from heaven to save sinners. You have heard how great and glorious a person he was before he came into our world. And will it not surprise you to hear, that this <HI>Jesus</HI> calls himself <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shepherd? his people, those who love and serve him, he call<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his sheep, and the young and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣der,
<PB N="6" REF="047686_0006_10243DE20136D250"/>
such as you are, he calls his lambs.</P>
<P>He calls you lambs, because, like them you are young, inno∣cent, and helpless; and like them you fly to others for safe∣ty and protection.</P>
<P>You are but of yesterday, and know but little: little in∣deed of the God that made you, of the Saviour who came to redeem you. You know little of the world in which you live, or of that world in which you are to live for ever. You stand in need of daily in∣struction, both in the concerns of your soul and body; but your compassionate shepherd has
<PB N="7" REF="047686_0007_10243DE41D1A8BD8"/>
promised, that he will feed his flock; he will feed you with the sincere milk of his word, that you may grow thereby.</P>
<P>He has said, Ask and ye shall receive, seek and ye shall find.</P>
<P>Are you at a loss what to ask? Ask, above all things, his favour, which is life: and his loving kindness, which is better than life. Ask him to teach you more of himself, of his greatness, and goodness, that you may love him more, and serve him better.</P>
<P>You are not only ignorant, but like the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeble lamb, you are helpless, and can do but little for your own safety and
<PB N="8" REF="047686_0008_10243DE705F8C730"/>
protection. You are exposed to many dangers that you know nothing of: there are many dis∣orders to which your infant years are liable, and a thousand accidents to which your tender frames are exposed.</P>
<P>How happy, amidst all this weakness and dangers, to re∣flect, that your kind shepherd has promised to gather you in his arms, and carry you in his bosom.</P>
<P>Your parents do much for you, and you have reason to thank God for them. But <HI>Je∣sus,</HI> your kind shepherd, can do much more, he can supply all your need; in sickness he can
<PB N="9" REF="047686_0009_10243DE9D75D4ED8"/>
save you, and in death deliver you; he can make you happy in this world, and happy for ever.</P>
<P>Often think, children, how much love and compassion are contained in those delightful words: He shall gather them in his arms, and carry them in his bosom. You know what it is to be folded in the fond arms of a compassionate father, and to hang on the breasts of a tender mother.</P>
<P>How often have they wiped away your tears, and eased the little sorrows of your hearts? and while you are enjoying their love and affection, think,
<PB N="10" REF="047686_0010_10243DED78E15B08"/>
thus has my kind shepherd promised to fold me in his arms. How condescending in him to notice such an ignorant and helpless creature as I am! What an honour to be called one of his lambs! How safe I am under his protection! He is Almighty, and none can pluck me out of his hands. The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want any thing that is good for me.</P>
<P>Blessed <HI>Jesus,</HI> I desire to be one of the lambs that thou wilt gather in thy arms, and carry in thy bosom. I am ignorant, but I come to thee that I may be taught.—I am weak and help∣less,
<PB N="11" REF="047686_0011_10243DEFC2688FD8"/>
but I fly to thy arms for safety and protection. Make me one of thy lambs, in love, in meekness, and humility; let me never wander from thee▪ or provoke thee to cast me ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of thy fold. Keep me from every danger in this world, and fit me to dwell with thee for ever, in thy heavenly king∣dom, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>MARK, Chap. x. Verse. 14.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>And Jesus said, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of such the kingdom of heaven.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>HOW great is your honour and happiness, children, to be thus noticed by the Son of God, the Saviour of the world▪ though he was so great, you see he was humble; though he was wise, he was condescend∣ing.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="047686_0014_10243DF7D737F458"/>
But I must tell you the whole of this pleasing story.</P>
<P>While <HI>Jesus</HI> was employed, as usual, in teaching the mul∣titude who came to him, some pious parents brought their children to <HI>Jesus</HI> that he might bless them. His disciples, in∣stead of encouraging, rebuked those who brought them; but when <HI>Jesus</HI> saw it he was much displeased, and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of such is the kingdom of heaven; and he took them up in his arms and blessed them.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="047686_0015_10243DF97214A208"/>
Good children are humble, modest, and teachable, and so must all good people be. In heaven there are none who are proud, conceited, or ill-natured. In that world the saints are all lovely and amiable, such as you children ought to be, and such as you must be, if you would live with <HI>Christ</HI> in his heavenly kingdom.</P>
<P>Heaven is full of love; God himself is love; his saints dwell in love: and can you, children, expect to go to that world of love, if you do not love God, and <HI>Christ,</HI> and one another? If you are proud, malicious, or ill-natured, do you think
<PB N="16" REF="047686_0016_10243DFB36E6B3E8"/>
that <HI>Jesus</HI> would say, of such as you is the kingdom of hea∣ven? No, these are the dispo∣sitions that would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it you only for the devil's kingdom. And would you wish to live for ever with those who are full of ma∣lice, pride, and anger? who hate God and <HI>Christ,</HI> and one another? no; we hope better things of you. You wish to be holy; for God is holy: to be modest and humble; for <HI>Jesus</HI> was meek and lowly; to be loving and kind, that <HI>Jesus</HI> may be able to say, of such as you is the kingdom of heaven.</P>
<P>How delightful must it be to those who brought the children
<PB N="17" REF="047686_0017_10243DFF431CAD38"/>
to <HI>Jesus,</HI> to see them in the arms of their compassionate Sa∣viour? And there is nothing, my little friends, that your pi∣ous parents so much wish for, as to see you coming to <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> for life and salvation. Though he is now in heaven, the arms of his love and com∣passion are still open to receive you. He can bestow upon you every blessing you stand in need of, both for soul and body; he can bless you in this world, and bless you for ever.</P>
<P>Your pious parents have al∣ready put you into the arms of this compassionate Saviour, and devoted you to his service; and
<PB N="18" REF="047686_0018_10243E021F42CEC0"/>
will you not chuse him for your Saviour and your Lord? Your parents' prayers will not save you; you must pray for your∣selves. Go, children, to this compassionate Saviour; you have every encouragement; your ministers encourage you, your parents encourage you, <HI>Jesus</HI> himself says, come unto me; and can you refuse his kind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nvitation? Say to him, Lord! to whom should we go but unto thee? thou hast the words of eternal life.</P>

<HEAD>SERMON III.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>JOHN, Chap. xxi. Verse 15.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Feed my lambs.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>YOU have heard children, that <HI>Jesus</HI> your kind shepherd, while he was here upon earth, folded the lambs in his arms, and carried them in his bosom; and as he was now about to leave this world, and go to his Father, it was natural he should be concerned about his flock—what would become of his sheep and his lambs: he was going
<PB N="21" REF="047686_0021_10243E0920E41EC8"/>
to leave them in a world full of difficulties and dangers; he was afraid they might meet with strange shepherds who would not care for the flock, nor lead them into good pas∣tures; and that they would be like sheep having no shepherd.</P>
<P>As <HI>Jesus</HI> was thus caring for his sheep, he looked round up∣on his disciples, and fixing his eyes upon <HI>Peter,</HI> who had pro∣fessed to love him better than the rest, he said unto him, <HI>Si∣mon,</HI> son of <HI>Jonas,</HI> lovest thou me? He said unto him, Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee, He saith unto him, Feed my lambs, <HI>Jesus</HI> said unto him
<PB N="22" REF="047686_0022_10243E0C32FA6A40"/>
the third time, <HI>Simon,</HI> son of <HI>Jonas,</HI> lovest thou me, <HI>Peter</HI> was grieved, because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I love thee, <HI>Jesus</HI> said unto him, Feed my sheep.</P>
<P>Why, my little friends, does <HI>Jesus</HI> so often question <HI>Peter</HI> a∣bout his love to him? he knew that <HI>Peter</HI> did indeed love him; but he was willing to try <HI>Pe∣ter's</HI> love, and to show how much he loved you, the lambs of his flock. Doest thou in∣deed love me, <HI>Peter?</HI> show thy love to me by feeding my
<PB N="23" REF="047686_0023_10243E0E9442B4E0"/>
sheep; feed my lambs; feed them with the sincere milk of my word, that they may grow thereby; tell them, though I leave this world, and go to the Father, that I still love them; that I go to prepare a place for them, that where I am, there they may be also; that I will come again, and receive them unto myself; that they shall never perish; and that none shall pluck them out of my hands. Not only <HI>Peter,</HI> but all the ministers of the gospel, are shepherds, sent by <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> to take care of his flock: and he says to them, as well as to <HI>Peter,</HI> Feed my sheep, feed my lambs.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="047686_0024_10243E10DE90BCD0"/>
Though your ministers are wise and learned, they are rea∣dy to instruct the young and ig∣norant; they are content to leave their studies and their learning, that they may teach you the first principles of reli∣gion, and the love of God; how you may be happy in this world, and happy for ever in heaven. And will you not o∣blige them by seriously attend∣ing to their instruction, and en∣deavouring to grow wise unto salvation? And, they not only instruct you, but they pray for you; they often bear you upon their hearts before God: they pray that you may grow in
<PB N="25" REF="047686_0025_10243E1264F4A5C8"/>
grace, as well as in stature, and in favour with God and man; they pray, that the love of God may be shed abroad in your hearts, and that you may know and love the God of your fa∣thers.</P>
<P>And if they thus kindly pray for you, will you not pray for them, that while they are teach∣ing others, they may be them∣selves taught of God, and that they may be blessed with every spiritual blessing in <HI>Christ Je∣sus?</HI></P>
<P>How amiable to see the mi∣nister and his flock thus pray∣ing for each other!</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="047686_0026_10243E14AD031628"/>
But above all, children, pray for yourselves, that God would enlighten your minds to understand the Scriptures, which are able to make you wise unto salvation; that you may grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> by whom alone you can be saved; that when <HI>Jesus,</HI> the great shep∣herd, shall come at the last day to gather his sheep together, you may appear at his right hand with joy.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>ACTS, Chap. viii. Verse 32.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb dumb before his shearers, so he opened not his mouth.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>UPON hearing this scrip∣ture, you are ready, perhaps, to say as the eunuch did to <HI>Phi∣lip;</HI> of whom does it speak? who was the person who was thus cruelly treated? Like <HI>Phi∣lip,</HI> we would take this text, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reach unto you—<HI>Jesus.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="047686_0029_10243E1DB4C1B108"/>
Yes, children, it was <HI>Jesus,</HI> the friend of sinners, your compassionate Saviour, who was thus cruelly put to death. But you will ask, why, what evil hath he done? He did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth; he was holy, harmless, and separate from sinners: but he was wounded for our sins, he was bruised for our iniqui∣ties; all we, like sheep, have gone astray, we have turned every man to his own way, and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquities of us all.</P>
<P>The blessed God, children, made us to be holy and happy but like the silly sheep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we
<PB N="30" REF="047686_0030_10243E1F37C724F0"/>
have wandered into the way that leads to death and destruc∣tion. All mankind have for∣saken God, broken his com∣mandments, and deserve death.</P>
<P>In this sad state, <HI>Jesus,</HI> our compassionate Saviour, saw us ready to perish; and, like the good shepherd, offered to lay down his life for the sheep; ra∣ther than we should perish, he would bear our sins in his own body upon the cross, and an∣swer for all our guilt. He knew this would be a sacrifice well pleasing to his Heavenly Father, who is not willing that any should perish.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="047686_0031_10243E2178248F00"/>
And he said, Lo! I come to do thy will, O God! and now having loved his own, he loved them unto the end; he loved them even unto death. Think, children, what he endured for your sake, for your salvation.</P>
<P>He was led as a sheep to the slaughter. You cannot think of the innocent sheep being led to the slaughter without pity and compassion: and can you read the sad history of your Sa∣viour's sufferings and death without sorrow and love?</P>
<P>He was scourged, he was crowned with thorns, he was buffetted and spit upon, he was mocked and reviled, and
<PB N="32" REF="047686_0032_10243E23A0BD0EC8"/>
then crucified between two thieves; and all this he bare like the patient lamb; dumb before his shearers, while they were stripping the wool from his back. When he was revil∣ed, he reviled not again; but while his cruel murderers were taking away his life, he said, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.</P>
<P>Now, my little friends, do not your hearts overflow with gratitude and love to this com∣passionate Saviour of sinners? Has he thus loved you, and will you not love him? Greater love he could not show, than by laying down his life for you,
<PB N="33" REF="047686_0033_10243E26EE6E2778"/>
he had power to save his life; with a look he could have struck his enemies to the ground; but how then could the Scriptures be fulfiled? How could God be glorified, and sinners saved?</P>
<P>Will you not children, for ever hate sin; because that was the cause of his sufferings and death? Surely the blessed God must hate sin, or he would not have given up his dear, his we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>-beloved Son to die for it. It was sin that brought sickness and death into our world, makes us like the devil, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell. It was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in that pro∣voked the blessed God to des∣troy
<PB N="34" REF="047686_0034_10243E29E77D9A98"/>
the world by water after he had made it: it was sin that provoked God to destroy <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah</HI> with fire from heaven: it was sin that pro∣voked God with the children of <HI>Israel</HI> in the wilderness: and it was sin that at last crucified the Lord of life and glory. And do you not think, chil∣dren, that sin must still be dis∣pleasing to God? Has <HI>Jesus</HI> died to redeem you from all ini∣quity, and will you indulge sin in your hearts? Remember <HI>Jesus</HI> died, not only to save you from the punishment of sin in hell, but to save you from sin itself; to make you holy, that
<PB N="35" REF="047686_0035_10243E2C143055C0"/>

<PB N="38" REF="047686_0038_10243E3285E3B0C0"/>
but have you been taught who this heavenly Father is? and what he has done for you? and what you must do to become his children? When you say, Our Father, do you feel such a disposition as a child ought to feel towards a tender father? Do you feel a reverence of him, and a love to him; a sorrow for having offended him, and a desire to be his dutiful and obedient children?</P>
<P>These are the dispositions you ought to feel towards your earthly parents; and much more to your heavenly Fa∣ther.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="047686_0039_10243E341C9E0108"/>
And let me tell you, children, if you have never prayed in this manner, you have never prayed at all. To say the prayers only with your lips, is not praying; you must pray with your heart, or it is no prayer.</P>
<P>It is affronting the blessed God to call him Father without loving him.</P>
<P>Though he is in heaven, he sees and knows all that you think, as well as that you say or do; in the darkness as well as in the light he sees you.</P>
<P>You will not then, children, any more affront the blessed
<PB N="40" REF="047686_0040_10243E370F024518"/>
God, by drawing near to him with your lips, while your hearts are far from him? From this time will you not call up∣on him as your heavenly Fa∣ther, with all the duty and love that becomes obedient children? He is a kind and tender Father. Like as a father pitieth his chil∣dren, so the Lord pities you.</P>
<P>It is he who gives you every good thing that you enjoy. It is his flax that clothes you, and his corn that feeds you. It is he who preserveth you from a thousand accidents, healeth your diseases, and crowneth you with loving kindness and tender mercies.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="047686_0041_10243E3892434718"/>
And above all, he has sent his dear, his well-beloved Son to redeem and save you; that you might not perish, but have everlasting life. Has your hea∣venly Father been thus kind to you, and will you not love him? Go, children, with al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your wants to this compassion ate Father: he who heareth the young ravens when they cry, will surely hear when you cry unto him.</P>
<P>Do you want food to eat? he who giveth food to the beasts of the field, will seed you also. Do you want rai∣ment to put on? he who cloth∣eth the lilies of the field, will
<PB N="42" REF="047686_0042_10243E3B91FB0ED0"/>
much more clothe you. Your earthly parents may be taken from you by death; but your heavenly Father hath said, I will never leave thee, nor for∣sake thee.</P>
<P>Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yea, she may forget, yet will I not forget thee.</P>
<P>This is the kind language of your heavenly Father; and what should be your language towards him? Should it not be all duty and love? Can you be a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a loss what to say to him? Can you ever forget to pray to

him? Go, like his dear children, and say to him, Our Father, who art in heaven, we thank thee, that thou wilt permit us to call thee by that tender, that delightful name; we would come to thee with all that du∣ty, love and affection, that be∣comes thy children. We are grieved that we should offend so kind a Father; forgive, we pray thee, the sins and follies of thy children. May we be holy, for thou art holy; and merci∣ful, as thou, our heavenly Fa∣ther, art merciful. We come to thee for all that we want; for food and raiment; but a∣bove all, we pray for a heart to

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>—AND surely, children, this ought to be the first lesson you should learn. You can not begin too soon to love the Lord your God. His mercies to yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> began with your very being; could you count them,
<PB N="47" REF="047686_0047_10243E4770F79948"/>
they are more in number than the sands upon the sea-shore. They are new every morning, and fresh every evening. You should love him, because he is the greatest and best of Beings, the Father of mercies, and the God of all grace; he is good to all and his tender, mercies are over all his works. You should love him, because he so loved he world as to give his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</P>
<P>Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pities them that fear him.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="047686_0048_10243E4B0FE66770"/>
The eyes of the Lord are up∣on the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry.</P>
<P>O taste and see that the Lord is good.</P>
<P>The rich and poor, the old and young, may all join in this delightful service. Let the rich love him, because it is he who giveth them all things richly to enjoy. Let the poor love him, because the poor man crieth, and the Lord heareth him and delivereth him out of all his trouble. Let the old love him, because he is the length of their days. Let the young love him, because he is the guide of their
<PB N="49" REF="047686_0049_10243E4DEFC5EB60"/>
youth. O love the Lord all his saints!</P>
<P>And is he thus good to you, good to all, and will you not love him with all your soul, and with all your mind? Love him above all things; let him have the first place in your af∣fections; think often upon God; think of him when you awake in the morning, and when you lay down at night; when you go out, and when you come in; let every fresh mercy lead your heart to him in gratitude, make you love him more, and serve him better.</P>
<P>And if you love God with all your heart, you will love to
<PB N="50" REF="047686_0050_10243E5022CEC058"/>
pray to him, and to praise him. You will say with <HI>David,</HI> Whom have I in heaven, but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee.</P>
<P>Lord! lift up thou the light of thy countenance upon me; and this shall put more joy and gladness into my heart, than when corn and wine increas∣eth.</P>
<P>A day in thy courts is better than a thousand elsewhere.</P>
<P>I had rather be a door-keep∣er in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of sin and wickedness.</P>
<P>This is the language of the pious soul, that loves God
<PB N="51" REF="047686_0051_10243E51ABAF8090"/>
above all things. And if you thus love God with all your heart, will it not grieve you to offend him?</P>
<P>You would not willingly of∣fend the kind parent or friend you love, much less would you sin against that God who is al∣ways doing you good? If ye love me, says <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> keep my commandments.</P>
<P>Thus, children, you must show your love to God. And if you love him with all your heart, you will delight to please him always: you will do your duty in all things, because it is well-pleasing to your God.</P>

<P>DO you, children, love God above all things? is he your Father? your heavenly Father? then, surely, it must be your highest pleasure to pray to him: you have much to say to him; much to ask of him; and much o thank him for.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="047686_0055_10243E5D26ACA280"/>
Go, children, if possible, where none can see you but God, your heavenly Father, and there pour out your hearts before him, with all the duty and affection of a child; tell him how much you love him for all his goodness to you; that you had rather have his favour, the light of his coun∣tenance, than all the good things that this world can give you.</P>
<P>You may tell him how griev∣ed you are, that your giddy hearts are so apt to forget him amidst the follies and vanities of childhood and youth; that you so often pray to him with∣out
<PB N="56" REF="047686_0056_10243E5F6D71BA60"/>
that reverence, love, and affection, which you ought ever to feel for him; that you so often read his holy word with carelessness and indiffer∣ence, as if it were the word of man, and not the word of God, and that you are not made ho∣lier and better by it.</P>
<P>You may lament over the pride, obstinacy, and perverse∣ness, that you sometimes feel in your hearts, and that you strive so little against these sins, that you may conquer and o∣vercome them.</P>
<P>Thus may you humble your∣selves before God, for all your sins and follies, and beg, that
<PB N="57" REF="047686_0057_10243E544D298D78"/>
for <HI>Christ's</HI> sake, he would for∣give them all; and grant you the assistance of his good Spirit, to help you to love him more, and serve him better.</P>
<P>It is good, children, to draw near to God, to show forth his loving kindness in the morning, and his faithfulness every night. Begin every day with this de∣lightful service. You cannot surely awake in the morning to health, to friends, to every bless∣ing of life, without thanking the God of your mercies, who giveth you all things richly to enjoy.</P>
<P>Dare not venture into the dangers and temptations of the

day, without praying that God would be with you, to keep you from sin, and deliver you from evil. Nor can you surely lie down in peace at night, without thanking the kind hand that has kept you from evil, and crowned the day with his loving kindness and tender mercies, without asking forgive∣ness of your heavenly Father for all that you have done amiss. Thus may you commit yourselves to his care, through the dangers of the night; for it is God only who can make you to dwell in safety.</P>
<P>Thus, children, you may converse in secret with your hea∣venly
<PB N="59" REF="047686_0059_1023E5454F101FF8"/>
Father; and be assured, he who heareth the young ra∣vens when they cry, will hear you when you pray unto him; he sees in secret the feeblest wish of your heart to love and serve him; he will remember the kindness of your youth, and will reward you openly. Fear not, children, though you should have only a dark corner to pray in, your heavenly Fa∣ther sees you there: fear not, though your companions should laugh at you for being so pre∣cise about your prayers; re∣member whom you are to fear: fear him who can kill both soul and body in hell.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="047686_0060_1023E565F05415E8"/>
Your heavenly Father sees when you are ashamed or a∣fraid to pray to him. <HI>Jesus</HI> has said, He who is ashamed of me, of him will I be a∣shamed before my Father and his holy angels; but he who confesseth me before men, him will I confess before my Father and his holy angels.</P>
<P>Believe it, children, you will never pray to him in vain; he will reward you in this world with every thing that he sees best for you; and at the last day, he will reward you openly before men and angels.</P>

<Q><HI>One thing is needful.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>UPON hearing these words I doubt not, my little friends, you are all eager to know what this one thing needful is? They are the words of <HI>Jesus Christ;</HI> and I will tell you upon what occasion they were spoken.</P>
<P>It came to pass as <HI>Jesus</HI> went about doing good, he entered into a certain village, and a
<PB N="64" REF="047686_0064_10243D7B58E93668"/>
woman, named <HI>Martha,</HI> kind∣ly received him into her house; and she had a sister, called <HI>Ma∣ry,</HI> who sat at <HI>Jesus'</HI> feet, and heard his words; but <HI>Martha</HI> was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said Lord, doest thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? Bid her therefore that she help me. And <HI>Jesus</HI> answered, and said unto her, <HI>Martha, Martha,</HI> thou art careful, and troubled about many things; but one thing is needful: and <HI>Mary</HI> hath chos∣en that good part which shall not be taken away from her.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="047686_0065_10243D7E487B3FD8"/>
And now, children, from this story you may learn what the one thing needful is. It is to hear the words of eternal life, and inquire what you must do to be saved. And though you cannot now sit at his feet as <HI>Mary</HI> did, while he was here upon earth, yet you may go to him as an humble learner. Like <HI>Mary,</HI> hear his words, and attend to the concerns of your souls; and like her chuse that good part which shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣ver be taken away from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>

miserable in the world to come.</P>
<P>It is needful for all; for the rich, and for the poor, for the old, and for the young. It is needful for you, children, to know God, and serve him here on earth, that you may dwell with him, and be happy for ever in heaven. It is more needful for you than riches, or honours, or all that this world <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>an give you; for what would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ofit you, if you should gain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hole world, and lose your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oul.</P>
<P><HI>Jesus Christ</HI> not only calls <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the one thing needful, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> calls it the good part.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="047686_0067_10243D836246D378"/>
Yes, children, it is a good thing to love God and <HI>Christ:</HI> the ways of religion are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked; but great peace have they who love thy law. To pray to God, and to praise him is a de∣lightful employment; to show forth his loving kindness in the morning, and his faithfulness every night.</P>
<P>Religion is a good thing: for it teaches us to be good ourselves, and to do good to all around us.</P>
<P>The religious child will be a good child; he will obey his
<PB N="68" REF="047686_0068_10243D864C3F8F20"/>
parents, not only because he loves them, but because God has said, Honour thy father and thy mother. And <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> has said, Children, obey your parents in all things; he will be merciful and kind, be∣cause his heavenly Father is merciful and kind to all: he will be diligent and industri∣ous, because his Bible tells him he must not be slothful in busi∣ness, but fervent in spirit, serving the Lord. In short, he will be a good child, that he may be the child of God, and have God for his father, and his friend for ever. And now, my little friends, must not that
<PB N="69" REF="047686_0069_10243D8877E75B08"/>
be a good thing that will make you thus good and happy?</P>
<P><HI>Jesus</HI> has said, this good part shall never be taken away from you: your parents and friends may be taken from you by death, but if you are good, God will be your father, and friend for ever. Your riches may be taken away from you; but if you are good, you have better treasures in heaven; death itself cannot take away this good part from you; for you know that the righteous shall dwell with God and <HI>Christ</HI> for ever in heaven.</P>
<P>And now, children, what shall I say more to persuade you
<PB N="70" REF="047686_0070_10243D8AAA38F5C0"/>
to chuse this good part? Your parents tell you it is the good part; they have found it so themselves, and they wish, above all things, to see you make the same choice. <HI>Jesus</HI> says it is the good part; go to him, sit at his feet, and say to him, Blessed <HI>Jesus,</HI> to whom should we go but unto thee? thou hast the words of eternal life, teach us what we must do to be saved; teach us the one thing needful; teach us, like <HI>Mary,</HI> to chuse that good part that shall never be taken away from us.</P>

<P>And is not this joyful news indeed, that <HI>Jesus,</HI> the beloved Son of God, should come down from heaven, be born into the world a feeble infant, like one of us, that he might save us

<P>And you see there is not on∣ly joy on earth, but in heaven too; the holy angels, those kind and friendly beings, rejoic∣ed to bring this good news to man.</P>

<P>They rejoiced to think, that good men should come from the east, and from the west, from all parts of the world, and dwell with them for ever in heaven. The friendly angels
<PB N="77" REF="047686_0077_10243D9D47C9D1F8"/>
had often been sent down to do service to good men here below, but they never came with so much joy as upon this occasion. This was good news to the whole world; good tidings of great joy to all people; to the rich, and to the poor, to the old, and to the young; for all stand in need of this Saviour.</P>
<P>Yes, children, to you is this salvation sent. And will you not receive it with joy? With the children in the temple, will you not cry Hosanna! blessed is he, who cometh in the name of the Lord. Will you not join with the holy angels, in say∣ing, Glory to God in the highest,
<PB N="78" REF="047686_0078_10243DA05A43F020"/>
on earth, peace, and good-will to men? Do they glorify God for his love to you, and can you be silent? Do they rejoice in the hope of your salvation, and will not you wish to be sav∣ed from sin, and hell, and to dwell with the holy angels for ever in heaven?</P>
<P>It is pleasant to think of the holy angels being employed for our service here on earth; but it is still more delightful to think of joining with them in the praises of our God and Sa∣viour in heaven.</P>
<P>Then shall we sing glory to God in higher strains than we can praise him in here on earth.
<PB N="79" REF="047686_0079_10243DA32781D888"/>
There we shall join with those blessed spirits, who cease not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almigh∣ty, which was, and is, and is to come! Then shall we join with thousands of angels, say∣ing, Worthy is the Lamb that was stain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.</P>
<P>Blessing, honour, glory, and power, be unto him who sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

not like an earthly mo∣narch, surrounded with his men of war, and adorned with trappings of gold and silver, but meek and lowly, sitting up∣on an ass, and a colt, the foal of an ass. The richest carpets he rode upon were made of the boughs of the trees, and the garments of the people: and they suited his humble appear∣ance better than the richest ta∣pestry.

<P>And the multitude who went before, and the multitude

These longs of praise were more pleasing to the blessed <HI>Jesus</HI> than all the honours they could give him; he came not to conquer his enemies, but to reign in the hearts of his people; not to save them from their enemies, but to save them from their sins. This was the kind er∣rand upon which he came. Well might the people cry Ho∣sanna! well might the children join in the song of praise to this compassionate Saviour! Sure∣ly,

<P>When they saw the wonder∣ful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the Son of <HI>David,</HI> they were sore displeased, and said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? <HI>Jesus</HI> answered, and said unto them, Yea, have ye never read, Out of the mouth of

<P>You see, <HI>Jesus</HI> was ready upon all occasions to show his love to you, the lambs of his flock; he would not suffer the scribes and priests to stop the infant mouths that were em∣ployed in his praise. It was foretold in Scripture, that you should welcome him into his kingdom; and he was pleased to hear Hosannas from the mouth of babes.</P>
<P>You cannot be too young, children, to sing the praises of your Saviour: and while you hear others welcome him as the Son of God, and Saviour of

<P>Go into his temple, chil∣dren, with thanksgiving, and enter his courts with praise.

<Q><P><HI>Are not five sparrows sold for two far∣things, and not one of them is forgot∣ten before God?</HI></P>
<P><HI>But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHAT a beautiful de∣scription is this of the goodness and compassion of God! he is good you see, even to the fee∣blest and smallest of his crea∣tures;
<PB N="90" REF="047686_0090_10243DBE2D2E2D68"/>
to the beasts of the field, and the birds of the air; even the sparrow, the meanest of the little feathered tribe, is not beneath his notice.</P>
<P>The God who made them does not forget to give them their daily bread; numerous as they are, there is food pro∣vided for them all: the trees are loaded with berries, that the birds may not want food in winter. Your heavenly Father is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all his works. And does he thus feed the fowls of the air? does he thus clothe the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lowers of the field? and do ye not think, children,
<PB N="91" REF="047686_0091_10243DC075116F18"/>
that he will much more take care of you? Yes, he has said, Fear not, ye are of more value than many sparrows; your heavenly Father will much more feed you.</P>
<P>You are of more value than many sparrows; for you have souls immortal, souls that must live for ever. When the birds and beasts die, there is an end of them; but when you, chil∣dren die, there is not an end of you; for your souls will live after your bodies are dead.</P>
<P>You are of more value; for you are made for nobler ends than they: you are made to know God, and serve him here
<PB N="92" REF="047686_0092_10243DC37B1CEB58"/>
on earth, that you may dwell with him, and be happy here∣after in heaven.</P>
<P>The sparrows know not the God who made them, the hand that feeds them; but you, chil∣dren, can know and remember your Creator; you can love the God who feeds and clothes you; you can pray to him daily for what mercies you want, and give him thanks for what you receive; you can love him as your heavenly Father, and you are sure that he will never for∣get you.</P>
<P>Thus you see God has made you a nobler creature than the fowls of the air, or the beasts of
<PB N="93" REF="047686_0093_10243DC5B0CA6310"/>
the field; and if he provides for them, he will much more provide for you: fear not, your heavenly Father will not let you want bread to eat, or raiment to put on.</P>
<P>He who heareth the young ravens when they cry, will much more hear you when you cry unto him. Are you poor? fear not; for the poor man cries, and the Lord hears him, and delivers him out of all his trouble. Are you fatherless? fear not; for God is the Father of the fatherless. Or have your father and mother forsaken you? fear not; for the Lord will take you up. He knows
<PB N="94" REF="047686_0094_10243DC734BA1F88"/>
all your wants, and all your fears; nothing can befal you without his permission. Are you sick? whom the Lord lov∣eth he chasteneth; to show how much your heavenly Father cares for you, he has said, The very hairs of your head are all numbered.</P>
<P>Does your heavenly Father thus care for you, then, chil∣dren, what have you to fear? You have nothing to fear but sin; nothing to fear but dis∣pleasing God: to make God angry with you would be sad indeed; but if you love and serve him, you need not fear that he will be angry with you,
<PB N="95" REF="047686_0095_10243DC96C9CF1B8"/>
he is only angry with the wicked, with those who do not love and serve him.</P>
<P>Remember, he expects more from you than from the fowls of the air: God has not given them reason, and therefore he expects nothing from them; but he expects that you should love him as your heavenly Fa∣ther, and be his dutiful and o∣bedient children. Go, chil∣dren, and thank your heaven∣ly Father, that he has given you more understanding than the beasts of the field, and made you wiser than the fowls of heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="047686_0096_10243DCBA1D05388"/>

<Q><HI>Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>GOD is good, and his tender mercies are over all his works.</P>
<P>This good God, children, is your Father, your heavenly Father; and we hope it is your wish and desire to be like him. You cannot be like him in greatness; but you may be like him in goodness; you may be holy, as he is holy; you may
<PB N="99" REF="047686_0099_10243DD2F12DFB28"/>
be merciful, as he is merciful; you may be good, and do good to all around you; it is your happiness, your pleasure to be merciful.</P>
<P>The man who is unkind and cruel must be unhappy; for he has no love, no compassion in his breast; he knows not the joy of seeding the hungry, and of clothing the naked: and <HI>Je∣sus</HI> shall say to him at the last day, Depart from me, I know you not; for I was an hungered and ye gave me no meat; I was thirsty and ye gave me no drink; a stranger and ye took me not in; I was sick, and in prison, and ye visited me nor;
<PB N="100" REF="047686_0100_10243E640DE70948"/>
and these shall go away into everlasting punishment.</P>
<P>But the merciful man is bles∣sed: <HI>Jesus</HI> has said, Blessed are the merciful, for they shall ob∣tain mercy; blessed is he who considereth the poor; the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble; the Lord will preserve him, and keep him alive, and he shall be blessed upon the earth: the Lord will strengthen him upon the bed of languish∣ing, he will make all his bed in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sickness; the merciful man will be blessed by the poor;—because I delivered the poor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, and the fatherless, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him who had none to help
<PB N="101" REF="047686_0101_10243E67D95BE9B0"/>
him; the blessing of him who was ready to perish came upon me, and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.</P>
<P>Surely children, there can∣not be a greater joy on earth, than to have the blessing of him who was ready to perish.</P>
<P>You have read the story of the poor man who fell among thieves, who wounded him, and left him half dead. Which do you think felt the greatest pleasure in his own breast, the good <HI>Samaritan,</HI> who took care of him, and poured oil into his wounds, or the cruel Priest and Levite, who passed by and left him to perish? You will surely
<PB N="102" REF="047686_0102_10243E6A0F72E908"/>
say, He who had mercy on him.</P>
<P>Then, children, go and do likewise; go, like your hea∣venly Father, and carry bread to the hungry, to them who are ready to perish: go, com∣fort the sick and afflicted. It is, perhaps, little you can do for them at present▪ but do what you can; carry them something from your little store to relieve their necessities: you can speak kindly to them, and even your compassionate looks may revive and comfort them; tell them you will do what you can for them, that you wish you could do more;
<PB N="103" REF="047686_0103_10243E6D5062ABF0"/>
but that your heavenly Father is merciful, he knows what they stand in need of, and can supply all their wants, and that he heareth the poor when they cry.</P>
<P>How do you think, chil∣dren, you will feel after such acts of kindness as these? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> feel happy; yes, y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eel happier than all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> riches or pleasure<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> can make you?

<P>THUS did the pious mother of <HI>Samuel</HI> devote the child that God had graciously given her, to him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to his service; for this child she had prayed. She knew that her children, as well as all her other mercies, came
<PB N="107" REF="047686_0107_10243E7AAC786258"/>
from God; therefore she went up to the temple of God, the house of prayer, and there poured out her soul before God.</P>
<P>And she vowed a vow, and said, O Lord of hosts! if thou wilt indeed look upon the af∣fliction of thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thy handmaid; but will give unto thy hand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid a man-child; then will I give him unto the Lord all the days of his life.</P>
<P>She prayed for a man-child; not because she wished for an h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n estate, or that he might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or great in the world, but that he might have
<PB N="108" REF="047686_0108_10243E7C4D5C6518"/>
the honour to serve God in his temple, and minister to the Lord in holy things. And when God had given her the child she had asked of him, she remembered the vow she had made; and as soon as he was weaned, she took him with her to the house of God, and brought him to <HI>Eli,</HI> the high priest, and there, in the most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mn manner, devoted her child, and gave him up unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Lord, in the words of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ext: for this child I prayed; and the Lord hath granted my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etition; therefore also I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent him to the Lord; as long
<PB N="109" REF="047686_0109_10243E7FAF20AE98"/>
as he liveth, he shall be lent to the Lord.</P>
<P>From this pleasing history, we learn what is the duty of pi∣ous parents: It is to acknow∣ledge, that they receive their children at the hand of God, and to devote them to his fear and service. And, perhaps, some of you, my little friends, like <HI>Samuel,</HI> have had a pious mother, who has devoted you to the Lord: They have said in some such language as this: For this child I prayed, and the Lord hath granted my request. It is God who hath given it to me, and shall not I devote it to him, and to his service?</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="047686_0110_10243E830F64CFA8"/>
He hath said, All souls are mine; the soul of the father, and the soul of the son; and when he puts this child into my hands, does he not, as it were, say, Here is an immortal soul that may be happy or mi∣serable for ever; bring it up for me and my service.</P>
<P>And is it possible that this dear child, whom I so tenderly love, may be made, through my neglect, for ever miserable? Dreadful thought! But how pleasing to think, that, with the blessing of God upon my endeavours, it may be taught to know the God who made it, to love and serve him here, and
<PB N="111" REF="047686_0111_10243E855B0E6440"/>
to dwell with him for ever and ever. Delightful thought! Soon as its infant tongue can speak, it shall be taught the praises of its God and Saviour, its little hands be lifted up to the God of its mercies, and its feet taught the way to the house of its Creator. O, my God! I desire not that it may be rich or great in this world; only give it a heart to love and serve thee: to thee who gave it to me, would I solemnly de∣vote it, and may it be thine for ever!</P>
<P>This has been the language of many a pious mother; and we would hope, children, of
<PB N="112" REF="047686_0112_10243E8731E76BD0"/>
some of yours. And surely you will not disappoint their pleasing hopes and expectati∣ons? Consider the many prayers they have put up for you, the many tears they have shed upon your account. How can they bear the thought, that their children should be the children of the devil, instead of the children of God! Do they love God above all things, and must they not desire that you should love him too? Do they hope to dwell for ever in heaven, and must they not ear∣nestly desire, that you, their dear children, may be likewise

<P>Children, you never can be thankful enough to God for such parents as these; let your behaviour to them be all duty, love, and obedience, and let not their prayers and instruction be lost upon you; go upon your knees, and thank God for all the mercies of your infant years, that you have been so early taught to know the God of your mercies, and to call him Father. Pray that your pa∣rents may have the joy of heart to see you love God above all things, and serve him with a cheerful heart and willing mind,

<BIBL>2 TIMOTHY, Chap. i. Verses 1, to 5.</BIBL>
<Q><P><HI>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I thank God whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that, without ceasing, I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first
<PB N="117" REF="047686_0117_10243E992FCCE488"/>
in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mo∣ther Eunice: and I am persuaded that in thee also.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN what an affectionate man∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er does the apostle <HI>Paul</HI> begin <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his letter to <HI>Timothy:</HI> he calls <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im his own son, his dearly be∣loved son; he wishes him the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est of blessings, not riches and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onours, but grace, mercy, and peace; not the good things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat this world can give, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he better blessings that come from God and <HI>Christ.</HI></P>
<P>Your parents, my little friends, may wish you grace; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut it is only the grace of God that can make you truly happy.
<PB N="118" REF="047686_0118_10243E9AB3AA70C0"/>
It is his mercy in <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> that must pardon all your sins, and it is the peace of God that must keep your hearts and minds in <HI>Christ Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>These are the blessings the apostle <HI>Paul</HI> wished to <HI>Timothy;</HI> and we earnestly wish, chil∣dren, that God would thus bless you. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Paul</HI> not only blesses <HI>Timothy,</HI> but he prays, for him; though he is at a distance from him he does not forget him, but prays for him night and day.</P>
<P>This was the best way in which he could show his love to <HI>Timothy;</HI> he knew it was God alone who could make
<PB N="119" REF="047686_0119_10243E9DF9C7FE00"/>
him truly good and happy; and he knew that God would hear and answer the prayers of his servants.</P>
<P>And will you not go to your parents, and ministers, and ask them to pray for you? to bear you upon their hearts before God? The prayers of the up∣right are his delight: he is a God, hearing and answering prayer, and you have reason to hope, that their prayers will descend in blessings upon your head.</P>
<P>What was it, my little friends, that made <HI>Timothy</HI> so beloved by the apostle <HI>Paul?</HI> It was because he feared the
<PB N="120" REF="047686_0120_10243EA0888175B0"/>
Lord from his youth. The apostle had been <HI>Timothy's</HI> first instructor in the gospel of <HI>Christ;</HI> he had instructed him; he had prayed for him; he had watched over him with all the affection of a tender parent; and it filled him with joy to see his son <HI>Timothy</HI> walking in the truth.</P>
<P>He remembered, with joy, <HI>Timothy's</HI> pious grandmother <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and mother <HI>Eunice;</HI> and he rejoiced to see the same faith and piety in their son.</P>
<P>And there is nothing, my little friends, can give the mi∣nisters of the gospel greater pleasure, than to see you chil∣dren
<PB N="121" REF="047686_0121_10243EA376F91AD8"/>
imitating the faith and pi∣ety of your parents. It de∣lights them when they can tell you, they remember with what tenderness they instructed you, prayed for you, and wept over you; and it fills them with joy, to see the very image of those pious parents in you; they rejoice to think, that when they are gone to heaven, you will fill up their places in the church, and in the world.</P>
<P>And they exhort you, as the apostle <HI>Paul</HI> did <HI>Timothy;</HI> that you continue to remember, and to practise the things that you have learnt: for your pa∣rents' sake, for your minister's
<PB N="122" REF="047686_0122_10243EA6DB257680"/>

<Q><HI>And that from a child thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the holy Scriptures, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> able to make thee wise unto salvation.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WE wish, my little friends, to see you like the blessed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> growing in wisdom, as well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in stature.</P>
<P>Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace, a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.</P>
<P>You will soon find much en∣tertainment
<PB N="124" REF="047686_0124_10243EABD8FA6CA8"/>
from books that tell you what sort of a world this is, and what was done be∣fore you were born into it. You will read with pleasure the histories of the wise and good, that you may learn to be like them; but, children, we wish above all things, to see you wise unto salvation. You may know much of the world, and of the works of God, and yet know nothing of the God who made the world, and all things that are in it.</P>
<P>You may be so wise as to get riches and honours in this world, and yet be so ignorant, as not to know what will be∣come of you for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="047686_0125_10243EAD5D06C558"/>
You may know much, and yet know nothing of <HI>Christ,</HI> and him crucified, which the apostle <HI>Paul</HI> thought the high∣est wisdom of all: in short, you may know much of this world, and yet know nothing of that world in which you are to live for ever.</P>
<P>Now, children, would it not be sad, if after all your knowledge, you should know nothing of God, of <HI>Christ,</HI> of heaven, of hell, or of your own souls?</P>
<P>Time here can be but short; and will it not be sad when death comes, if you should not have God for your friend, and
<PB N="126" REF="047686_0126_10243EB19EDCC990"/>
<HI>Jesus</HI> for your Saviour? Sad indeed, to hear the blessed God say at last, Depart from me, I know you not.</P>
<P>Thus, children, you see that religion is the true wis∣dom; and that he only is wise, who is wise unto salvation.</P>
<P>Will you not then eagerly inquire where you can learn this true wisdom?</P>
<P>The text informs you, that it is the holy Scriptures that are able to make you wise unto sal∣vation: they are the words of God himself; for holy men of old wrote as God taught them by his holy Spirit; they are words of eternal life; words
<PB N="127" REF="047686_0127_10243EB40FDBB140"/>
whereby you may be saved. Young as you are, there is much in them that you can un∣derstand; for they are written for the young as well as for the old, for the unlearned as well as for the learned.</P>
<P>You will there find many de∣lightful histories to entertain and instruct you; many amia∣ble examples to make you wise and good.</P>
<P>The holy Scriptures will tell you much of God, how great, and how good he is; so great, that the heaven of heavens can∣not contain him, and yet so humble as to dwell in every contrite heart. You will there
<PB N="128" REF="047686_0128_10243EB5C7E22870"/>
find, that God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not pe∣rish, but have everlasting life. That <HI>Jesus,</HI> your compassionate Saviour, came to seek, and to save that which was lost, to call you to repentance, and to save you from your sins. You will there learn, that you must be holy if you would be happy for ever; that you are to love God above all things, and to love your neighbour as your∣self; that you must be good, and do good to all around you.</P>
<P>You will there find, that time is short, and that death
<PB N="129" REF="047686_0129_10243EBA433B29E8"/>
may come at a time when you think not of it; that therefore you must watch and pray, that you enter not into temptation; and that your Lord, when he cometh, may find you watch∣ing, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it to dwell with him for ever in heaven.</P>
<P>This, my little friends, is the wisdom that the holy scrip∣tures will teach you; and you cannot begin to learn it too soon. You have souls, im∣mortal souls; and you cannot inq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e too soon what you must do to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aved; for what would it profit you, if you should gain the whole world, and lose your own soul.</P>

With what solemnity and ear∣nestness does <HI>David</HI> exhort his son <HI>Solomon</HI> to remember God, the God of his fathers; that God who searches all hearts, that God who could make him happy or miserable for ever; and is not this the language of every pious parent?

God has heard my prayers for you, and he waits to be gracious; if you seek him, he will be found of you; he will be nigh unto you
<PB N="134" REF="047686_0134_10243EC7A24020A0"/>
as your father and your friend; seek him, my child, seek him with all your heart; for the Lord searches all hearts. Dare not seek him with your lips while your heart is far from him; say to him, My father, be thou the guide of my youth; and he will be your guide even unto death.</P>
<P>But, O my child! should you forsake him, he will cast you off for ever. Dreadful thought! to be cast off from that God whose favour is life, and whose loving kindness is better than life; to be cast off from the family of God's chil∣dren, and to be no more a seed
<PB N="135" REF="047686_0135_10243EC9427BC1E8"/>
to serve him: to be cast into the lake that burns for ever and e∣ver, and to be punished with e∣verlasting destruction from the presence of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Lord.</P>
<P>My child, how can I endure the dreadful thought! seek him while he may be found, call up∣on him while he is near; if you seek him he will be found of you; but remember, if you forsake him he will cast you off for ever.

How will your hearts en∣dure the terrors of that day, when you shall be called to ac∣count for all the sins you have committed, for all the mercies you have despised, for all the prayers of your pious parents, for the lessons of piety they have given you, for the in∣structions of God's holy word, and for the blood of that com∣passionate saviour, which you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> trodden under foot and despised?

to tell, as for you to hear: but, if we alarm you, it is that you may flee from the wrath to come, and lay hold on eternal life. Forsake God! For what should you forsake him? is the blessed God ready to cast you off? O, no; he has said, I will never leave thee nor forsake thee; I would gather you as a h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n gath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reth her chickens un∣der her wings.

but you cannot live without your God; and surely you can∣not die without him. You will then have nothing left but your God; and can you be happy without him?

My little friends, you are the fig-trees in God's vineyard: God is the husbandman: you are the plants which his right hand has planted. He has planted you in the choicest ground, where streams of hea∣venly mercy slow, and words of sweet salvation sound; a∣midst all the blessings of the gospel and the means of grace. Your pious parents have nour∣ished and cherished you; they have instructed you, they have prayed for you, your ministers have taught you from God's holy word, they have fed you with the sincere milk of his word, that you may grow
<PB N="142" REF="047686_0142_10243EEA99E3F1E8"/>
thereby. Above all, <HI>Jesus,</HI> the compassionate lover of souls, the great vine-dresser in God's vineyard, has nourished you with his word and ordinances, he has drawn you with the cords of love, and he has laid down his life for you, that you might not perish, but have everlasting life.</P>
<P>And now, my little friends, suppose the great husbandman, after all that he has done for his vineyard, should come and find no fruit upon his vines and his fig-trees? Sad indeed, if he should come, year after year, seeking fruit and finding none, after he has done so much for
<PB N="143" REF="047686_0143_10243ED0B1514A38"/>
you. Will he not expect that you should bring forth the fruits of holiness to the praise and glo∣ry of God? You who are train∣ed up in piety and goodness, who have been taught from your earliest infancy to know God, to love him, and to serve him, to pray to him, and to praise him, what do you more than others?</P>
<P>Consider how many poor unhappy children there are, whose wicked parents have ne∣ver taught them to know the God who made them, the Sa∣viour who died to redeem and save them. Will you not pity and pray for them? and re∣member
<PB N="144" REF="047686_0144_10243ED3A3A2E108"/>
God expects much more from you. Young as you are, you may bring forth some fruit; he expects that you be modest, humble, and teach∣able, obedient to your parents, and loving and kind to all; but perhaps, he has come for one, two, or three years, and found none of these fruits: no fear of God, no love to him, no prayer to him, no care about your souls, no thoughts of hea∣ven or of hell. Sad indeed! He waits to be gracious, and yet you will not regard him. Have you not reason to fear he will say to his vine-dresser, Cut it down, why cumbereth
<PB N="145" REF="047686_0145_10243ED625204D90"/>
it the ground? Remember eve∣ry plant that beareth not fruit he taketh away; and how soon you may be taken away you know not. Young plants are aften removed, often in mercy taken away from the evil to come; take care that you are not removed in anger, because you bear no fruit. It is sad, indeed, to be mere cumberers of the ground; to live in the world without being good our∣selves; or doing good to those around us; we root such plants out of our garden, and cast them among the weeds that are to be burnt.</P>
<P>So at the last day God shall
<PB N="146" REF="047686_0146_10243ED90F330978"/>
say to his angels, Gather toge∣ther the tares; that is, the wicked and unprofitable, and bind them in bundles to be burnt.</P>
<P>The blessed God is not wil∣ling that any should perish; he waits to be gracious; he comes, year after year, seeking fruit; and it is not till there is no more hope, that he says, Cut it down: he was willing to hope year after year, that it would blossom, and bring forth fruit; but, alas! he has been disap∣pointed, and he now pro∣nounces the awful sentence, Cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground? But see, <HI>Jesus,</HI>
<PB N="147" REF="047686_0147_10243EDB368B9B98"/>
the kind vine-dresser, inter∣ceeds for you: O! my Father! let it alone this year also: true, thou hast done much for it, hast borne it with much pa∣tience year after year, and still it has been barren and unfruit∣ful, and there seem now but little hope that it will ever bear fruit; but spare it one year more; I know not how to give it up; let it alone this year al∣so: let instruction, reproof, and correction, be tried a little longer; perhaps the heart that is now hard may be softened and melt; the temper that is now rough and obstinate, may become gentle and teachable;
<PB N="148" REF="047686_0148_10243EDD80A54C68"/>
the disobedient child may be∣come dutiful and obedient; and the child who seemed al∣most ripe for destruction, be made a child of God, and an heir of the kingdom of heaven.

<HEAD>REMARKS, Extracted from "an estimate of the RELIGION Of the FASHIONABLE WORLD.</HEAD>
<P>IT is seriously to be regretted, in an age like the present, re∣markable for indifference in re∣ligion and levity in manners, and which stands so much in need of lively patterns of firm and resolute piety, that many who really are christians on the soberest conviction, should not
<PB N="152" REF="047686_0152_10243EE866AB94F8"/>
appear more openly and deci∣dedly on the side they have es∣poused; that they assimilate so very much with the manners of those about them (which man∣ners they yet scruple not to dis∣approve); and, instead of an avowed but prudent steadfast∣ness, which might draw over the others, appear evidently fearful of being thought precise and over-scrupulous; and ac∣tually seem to disavow their right principles, by concessions and accommodations not strict∣ly consistent with them. They often seem cautiously afraid of <HI>doing too much,</HI> and <HI>going too far;</HI> and the dangerous plea,
<PB N="153" REF="047686_0153_10243EFE1E980BE8"/>
the necessity of <HI>living like other people,</HI> of <HI>being like the rest of the world,</HI> and the propriety of <HI>not being particular,</HI> is brought as a reasonable apology for a too yielding and indiscriminate comformity.</P>
<P>But, at a time when almost all are sinking into the prevail∣ing corruption, how beautiful a rare, a single integrity is, let the instances of Lot and Noah declare. And to those with whom a poem is an higher au∣thority than the Bible, let me recommend the most animated picture of a right<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>u singulari∣ty that ever was delineated, in
<Q><PB N="154" REF="047686_0154_10243EFAD6E851A0"/>
<L>—The Seraph Abdiel, faithful found</L>
<L>Among the faithless, faithful only he:</L>
<L>Among innumerable false, unmov'd,</L>
<L>Unshaken, unseduc'd, unterrified,</L>
<L>His loyalty he kept, his love and zeal:</L>
<L>Nor NUMBERS, nor EXAMPLE with him wrought</L>
<L>To swerve from truth, or change his constant mind,</L>
<L>Tho' SINGLE.</L>
<BIBL>PAR. LOST, b. iv.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Few indeed of the more or∣derly and decent have any ob∣jection to that degree of reli∣gion which is compatible with their general acceptance with others, or the full enjoyment of their own pleasures. For a formal and ceremonious exer∣cise of the outward duties of christianity may not only be kept up without exciting cen∣sure,
<PB N="155" REF="047686_0155_1023E53E186B1170"/>
but will even procure a certain respect and confidence; and is not quite irreconcilable with a voluptuous and dissipat∣ed life. So far many go; and fo far "as godliness is profita∣ble to the life that <HI>is,</HI>" it passes without reproach.</P>
<P>But as soon as men begin to consider religious exercises not as a decency, but a duty; not as a commutation for a self-denying life, but as a means to promote a holy temper, and a virtuous conduct: as soon as they feel disposed to carry the effect of their devotion into their daily life: as soon as their principles discover themselves,
<PB N="156" REF="047686_0156_10243EED080B5380"/>
by leading them to withdraw from those scenes, and abstain from those actions, in which the gay place their supreme happiness as soon as something is to be <HI>done,</HI> and something is to be <HI>parted with;</HI> then the world begins to take offence, and to stigmatize the <HI>activity</HI> of that piety, which had been commended as long as it re∣mained <HI>inoperative,</HI> and had only evaporated in <HI>words.</HI></P>
<P>But when religion, like the vital principles, takes its seat in the heart, and sends out sup∣plies of life and heat to every part; diffuses motion, soul, and vigour, through the whole
<PB N="157" REF="047686_0157_10243EF953E24178"/>
circulation; and informs and animates the whole man: when it operates on the practice, influences the conversation, breaks out into a lively zeal for the honour of God, and the best interests of mankind: then the sincerity, or the under∣standing, of that person will become questionable: and it must be owing to a very fortu∣nate combination of circum∣stances indeed, if he can at once preserve the character of parts and piety.</P>
<P>But it is a folly to talk of being too holy, too strict, or too good. Where there hap∣pens to appear some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounda∣tion
<PB N="158" REF="047686_0158_10243EF02E750548"/>
for the charge of enthusi∣asm (as there are indeed too often in good people eccentri∣cities which justify the cen∣sure), we may depend upon it, that it proceeds from some de∣fect in the judgment, and not from any excess in the piety; for in goodness there is no ex∣cess: and it is as preposterous to say that any one is too good, or too pious, as that he is too wise, too strong, or too heal∣thy; since the highest point in all these is only the perfection of that quality which we ad∣mired in a lower degree. There may be an <HI>imprudent,</HI> but there cannot be a <HI>supera∣bundant</HI>
<PB N="159" REF="047686_0159_10243EF34EB1BFD0"/>
goodness. An ardent imagination may mislead a rightly turned heart; and a weak intellect may incline the best intentioned to ascribe too much value to things of com∣paratively small importance. Such an one not having dis∣cernment enough to perceive where the force and stress of duty lie, may innocently dis∣credit religion by a too scrupu∣lous exactness in points of small intrinsic value.</P>
<P>And even well-meaning men, as well as hypocrites, may think too much is done when their "mint" and "anise" are rigorously tithed.</P>
