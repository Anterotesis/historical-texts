</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Apostle St. <HI>Paul</HI> in his Epistle to the <HI>He∣brews</HI> informs us, <HI>That it is appointed for all Men once to die; after that,</HI> says he, <HI>comes Judgment.</HI>— And I think if any Consideration be sufficient to a∣waken a sleeping drowsy World, it must be this— That there will be a Day wherein these Heavens shall be wrapt up like a scrowl, this Element melt with fervent Heat, the Earth and all the Things therein be burnt up, and every Soul and every Nation and Language summoned to appear before the dreadful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the righteous Judge of Quick and Dead, to receive Rewards and Punishments according to the Deeds done in their Bodies.—The great Apostle just mentioned, when brought before <HI>Felix,</HI> could think of no better means to convert that sinful Man than to reason of Temperance, Righteousness, and more especially of a Judgment to come.—The first might in some Measure affect, but I am perswaded it was the last Consideration, I mean of a Judgment to come, that made him tremble; and so bad as the World is grown yet there are few have their Consciences so far scared, as with a red hot Iron, as to deny that there will be a Reckoning hereafter. The promiscuous Dispensations of Providence in this
<PB N="4" REF="040181_0003_101632B50981EDF0"/>
Life, wherein we see good Men afflicted, destitute, tormented, and the Wicked permitted Triumphantly to ride over their Heads, has been always looked up∣on as an indisputable Argument, by the generality of Men, that there will be a day in which God will Judge the World in Righteousness, and Administer true Equity unto his People.—Some indeed are so bold as to deny it, while they are engaged in the pursuit of the Lust of the Eye, and the Pride of Life.—But follow them to their Death-Beds, ask them, when their Souls are ready to launch into Eternity, what they then think of a Judgment to come? and they will tell you they dare not give their Consciencies the Lye any longer.—They feel a fear∣ful looking for of Judgment and fiery Indignation in their Hearts.—Since then these Things are so, does it not highly concern each of us, my Brethren, before we come on a bed of Sickness, seriously to exa∣mine how the Account stands between God and our Souls, and how it will fare with us in that Day? As for the openly Prophane, the Drunkard, the Whore-monger, the Adulterer, and such like, there's no doubt of what will become of them—without Re∣pentance they shall never enter into the Kingdom of God and his Christ, No, their Damnation slumbereth not, A burning fiery Tophet kindled by the Fury of God's eternal Wrath is prepared for their Reception, wherein they must Suffer the Vengeance of an eter∣nal Fire.—Nor is there the least doubt of the State of true Believers—For tho' they be despised and re∣jected of natural Men, yet being born again of God, they are Heirs of God, and joint Heirs with Christ— They have the earnest of the promised Inheritance in their Hearts, and are assured that a new and living way is made open for them, into the Holy of Holies,

by the Blood of Jesus Christ, through which an A∣bundant entrance shall be Administred to them at the great Day of Accounts. The only Question is, What will become of the almost Christian, one that is content to go as he thinks in a middle way to Hea∣ven, without being Prophane on the one Hand, or as he falsely imagined, Righteous overmuch on the other?—Multitudes there are in every Congre∣gation, and consequently here present, of this Stamp— And what is worst of all, it's more easy to convince the most notorious Publicans and Sinners of their be∣ing out of a state of Salvation, than any of these—▪ Notwithstanding if Jesus Christ may be our Judge they shall as certainly be rejected and disowned by him at the last Day, as tho' they lived in open De∣fiance of all his Laws.—For what says our Lord in the Parable of which the Words of the Text are a Reddition or Conclusion and which I intend to make the Subject of my present Discourse.—Then, that is, at the Day of the Judgment, which he had been discoursing of in the foregoing and prosecutes in this Chapter, <HI>Shall the Kingdom of Heaven</HI> i. e. the State of professors in the Gospel Church, <HI>be likened unto Ten Virgins, which took their Lamps and went forth to meet the Bridegroom.</HI> In which Words is a mani∣fest Allusion to a Custom prevailing in our Lords Time among the <HI>Jews,</HI> at marriage Solemnities, which were generally at Night, and at which it was Customary for the Persons of the Bride-Chamber to go out in Procession with many Lights to meet the Bridegroom.—By the Bridegroom then here spoken of, you are to understand Jesus Christ—The Church <HI>i. e.</HI> True Believers are his Spouse—he is uni∣ted to them by one Spirit even in this Life, but the Solemnizing of these sacred Nuptials is reserved till the
<PB N="6" REF="040181_0004_101632B790495F60"/>
Day of Judgment, when he shall come to take them home to himself, and present them, before Men and Angels, as his purchase to his Father, without Spot or Wrinkle or any such Thing.—By the Ten Vir∣gins we are to understand the Professors of Christia∣nity in General—All are called Virgins, because all are called to be Saints.—Whosoever Names the Name of Christ is obliged by that very Profession to depart from all Iniquity.—The pure and chaste in Heart are the only Persons that will be so blessed as to see God.—As Christ was born of a Virgin's Womb, so he can dwell in none but Virgins Souls, made Pure and Holy by the Cohabitation of his Holy Spirit.—But what says the Apostle? <HI>All are not</HI> Isralites <HI>that are of</HI> Israel—<HI>All are not true Christians that are called after the Name of Christ</HI>— No, says our Lord, in the 2d. v. <HI>Five of these Vir∣gins were Wise,</HI> i. e. True Believers, <HI>and five were Foolish,</HI> i. e. Formal Hypocrites.—But why are five said to be Wise, and the other five Foolish?—Hear what our Lord says in the following Verses, <HI>They that were Foolish took their Lamps and took no Oil with them: But the Wise took Oil in their Vessels with Lamps.</HI>—They that were Foolish took their Lamps, <HI>i. e.</HI> The Lamp of an outward Profession, they would go to Church, say over several manuals of Prayers, come perhaps even into a Field to hear a Sermon, give at a Collection, and receive the Sa∣crament constantly, nay, oftner than once a Month. —But then here lay the Mistake, they had no Oil in their Lamps,—no true Principle of Grace, no living Faith in their Hearts, without which tho' we should give all our Goods to feed the Poor, and our Bodies to be Burnt it would profit us nothing.— In short, they were exact, nay perhaps Superstitious
<PB N="7" REF="040181_0004_101632B790495F60"/>
Biggots as to the Form; but all the while they were Strangers to and in effect denyed the Power of God∣liness in their Hearts. They would go to Church, but at the same Time, think it no harm to go to a Ball or an Assembly, notwithstanding they promised at their Baptism, <HI>to renounce the Pomps and Vanities of this wicked World.</HI>—They were so exceeding fearful of being Righteous overmuch, that they would even persecute those that were truly Devout, if they attempted to go a step farther than themselves. In one Word, they never effectually felt the Powers of the World to come.—They thought they might be Christians without so much Inward feeling, and therefore, notwithstanding their high Pretensions, had only a Name to Live.</P>
<P>And now Sir, let me pause a while, and in the Name of God, whom I endeavour to serve in the Gospel of his dear Son, give me leave to ask one Question. Whilst I have been drawing, tho' in Minature, the Character of these foolish Virgins, have not many of your Consciences made the Appli∣cation, and with a small still, tho' articulate, Voice, said, thou Man, thou Woman art one of these foolish Virgins, for thy Practice and Sentiments agreeth thereto? Do not then stifle but encourage these Con∣victions, and who knows but that Lord, who is rich in mercy to all that call upon him faithfully, may so work upon you even by this foolishness of Preach∣ing as to make you wise Virgins before you return home?</P>
<P>What they were you shall know immediately— <HI>But the Wise,</HI> says our Lord, ver. 4. <HI>took Oil in their Vessels with their Lamps.</HI>—Observe, the Wise, that is, the true Believers, had their Lamps as well as the Foolish Virgins, for Christianity does not require us
<PB N="8" REF="040181_0005_101632B927B81B28"/>
to cast off all outward Forms.—We may use Forms and yet not be formal: For Instance, it is possible to worship God in a set Form of Prayer, and yet wor∣ship him in Spirit and in Truth. And therefore Brethren let us not judge one another. The wise Virgins had their Lamps, herein did not ly the differ∣ence between them and the Foolish, that one worship∣ed God with a Form and the other did not.—No, as the <HI>Pharisee</HI> and <HI>Publican</HI> went up to the Temple to pray, so these Wise and foolish Virgins might go to the same Place of Worship and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir under the same Ministry—But then the Wise took Oil in their Ves∣sels with their Lamps, they kept up the Form, but did not rest in it, their Words in prayer were the Language of their Hearts, and they were no Stran∣gers to inward Feelings, they were not afraid of searching Doctrine, nor affronted when Ministers told them they deserve to be damned—They were not self Righteous, but were willing that Jesus Christ should have all the Glory of their Salvation, they were convinced that the Merrits of Jesus Christ were to be apprehended only by Faith; but yet were they as careful to maintain good Works as tho' they were to be justified by them—in short their Obedience flowed from Love and Gratitude, and was cheerful, constant, uniform, universal like that Obedience which the Holy Angels pay our Father in Hea∣ven.</P>
<P>Here then let me exhort you to pause again; and if any of you can faithfully apply these Characters to your Hearts, give God the Glory and take the Comfort to your own Souls, you are not False but true Believers.—Jesus Christ has been made of God to you Wisdom, even that Wisdom, whereby you shall be made Wise unto Salvation—God sees a dif∣ference
<PB N="9" REF="040181_0005_101632B927B81B28"/>
between you and Foolish Virgins, if Natu∣ral Men will not.—You need not be uneasy if one Chance and Fate in this Life may happen to you both I say one Chance and Fate. For <HI>ver.</HI> 5<HI>th while the Bride∣groom tarryed</HI> i. e. in the intermediate Space of Time which passed between our Lords Assention and his coming again to Judgment, <HI>they all slumbred and slept,</HI> the Wise as well as Foolish dyed, for Dust we all are and to Dust we must return, its no Reflection at all upon the Divine Goodness that Believers, as well as Hypocrites must pass thro' the Valley of the Shadow of Death, for Christ has taken the Sting out of it, so that we need fear no Evil—It is to them a Passage to everlasting Life. Death is only terrible to those that have no Hope, because they live with∣out Faith in the World. Whosoever there are a∣mongst you, that have received the first Fruits of the Spirit, I am persuaded you are ready to cry out with Holy <HI>Job</HI> we would not live here always, we long to be dissolved that me may be with Jesus Christ. And tho' Worms must destroy our Bodies as well as others, yet we are content, being assured that our Redeemer liveth, that he will stand at the latter Days upon the Earth, and that in our Flesh we shall see God.</P>
<P>But it is not so with Hypocrites and Unbelievers beyond the Grave, for what says our Lord? And at Midnight, observe at Midnight, when all was hush'd and quiet, and no one dreaming of any such Thing. A cry was made, The Voice of the Arch-Angel and the Trump of God was heard sounding this general Alarm. <HI>To Things in Heaven, to Things in Earth, and to Things in the Waters under the Earth, BE∣HOLD</HI>—mark how this awful Summons is usher'd in with the Word <HI>BEHOLD</HI>—to engage our Atten∣tion,
<PB N="10" REF="040181_0006_101632BADCFB8E40"/>
<HI>Behold</HI> the Bridegroom cometh even Jesus Christ the desire of Nations, the Bridegroom of his Spouse the Church—because he tarried for a while to ex∣ercise the Faith of Saints, and give Sinners space to repent.—Scoffers were apt to cry out where is the Pro∣mise of his coming, but the Lord is not slack concern∣ing his Promise, as these Men account slackness— For <HI>Behold</HI> he that was to come now cometh, and will not tarry any longer, he cometh to be glorified in his Saints, and to take Vengeance on them that know not God, and have not obeyed his Gospel: He cometh not as a Poor despised <HI>Galilean,</HI> not to be stabled in a stinking Manger, not to be despised and rejected of Men, not to be blindfolded, spit upon, and buffeted, not to be nailed to an accursed Tree, not as the Son of Man, but as he really was the eternal Son of an eternal God: He cometh riding in the Wings of the Wind, in the Glory of the Father, and his Ho∣ly Angels; and to be had in everlasting Reverence of all that shall be round about him.—Go ye forth to meet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> arise ye dead, ye Foolish as well as Wise Virgins, arise and come to Judgment.— Multitudes no doubt that heard this awakening <HI>CRY</HI> would have rejoiced if the Rocks might fall on and the Hills cover them from the presence of the Lamb, what would they give, if as they lived as Beasts, they might now die like the Beasts that perish? How would they rejoice if those same Excuses which they had made on this side Eternity for attending on Ho∣ly Ordinances, would now serve to keep them from appearing before the Heavenly Bridegroom. But as <HI>Adam</HI> notwithstanding his Fig Leaves, and the Trees of the Garden, could not hide himself from God, when arrested with an <HI>Adam</HI> where art thou? So
<PB N="11" REF="040181_0006_101632BADCFB8E40"/>
now, the Decree is gone forth and the Trump of God has given its last sound, all Tongues, Peo∣ple, Nations and Languages, both Wise and Foolish Virgins must come into his presence and bow beneath his Foot-stool even <HI>Pontius Pilate, Annas</HI> and <HI>Cai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>phas</HI> even the proud persecuting High-Priests and <HI>Phaisees</HI> of this Generation must now appear before him: — For says our Lord then <HI>i. e</HI> when the cry was made behold the Bridegroom cometh, in a Moment, in the twinkling of an Eye, the Graves were opened, the Sea gave up its Dead, all those Virgins both Wise and Foolish, arose and trimmed their Lamps <HI>i. e.</HI> endeavoured to put themselves in a proper Posture to meet the Bridegroom.</P>
<P>But how may we Imagine the Foolish Virgins were surprized, when notwithstanding their high Thoughts and proud Imaginations of their Security, they now find themselves wholly naked and void of that inward Holiness and purity of Heart, without which no Man living at that Day shall comfortably meet the Lord. I doubt not but many of these Foolish Virgins whilst in this World were Cloathed in Purple and fine Lin∣nen, fared sumptuously every Day, and would dis∣dain to set the Wise Virgins, some of which might be as poor a <HI>Lazarus,</HI> even with the Dogs of their Flock, —These were looked upon by them as Enthusiasts and Madmen as Persons that were righteous over∣mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, and who intended to turn the World upside <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>wn— But now Death hath opened their Eyes and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> them to their et<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rnal Sorrow that he is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> who is only one outwardly—now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> late) they and not the Wise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> eyes▪—Now their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>

might dip the Tip of his Finger in Water and be sent to cool his Tongue, so these Foolish Virgins, these Formal Hypocrites, are obliged to turn Beggars to those whom they once despised.—Give us of your Oil—Oh! impart to us a little of that Grace, and Ho∣ly Spirit for the insisting on which we Fools accoun∣ted your Lives Madness: For alass our Lamps are gone out.—We had only the Form of Godliness, we were whited Sepulchers, we were Heart Hypo∣crites, we contented ourselves with desiring to be good, and tho' confident of Salvation whilst we lived, yet our Hope is entirely gone, now God has taken a∣way our Souls, give us therefore, O! give us tho' we once despised you, give us of your Oil, for our Lamps of an outward Profession, transient Convicti∣ons are quite gone out.</P>
<P><HI>Comfort ye, comfort ye, my People saith the Lord,</HI> with this.—My Brethren in Christ hear what the Foolish say to the Wise Virgins, and learn in Pati∣ence to possess your Souls, if you are true Followers of the lowly Jesus. I am persuaded you have your Names cast out, and all manner of Evil spoken against you for his Name-sake: For no one ever did or will live Godly in Christ Jesus without suffering Persecution, nay I doubt not but your chief Foes are those of your own Houshold. Tell me do not your carnal Relati∣ons and Friends vex your tender Souls Day by Day, in bidding you spare your Selves, and take heed lest you go too far; and as you passed along to come and hear the Word of God, have you not heard many a <HI>Pharisee</HI> cry out here comes another Troop of his Followers? Brethren be not surprised, Christs Ser∣vants were always the Worlds Foo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, you know it ha∣ted him before it hated you, rejoice and be exceeding glad, yet a little while and behold the Bridegroom

cometh, and then shall you hear these Formal, Scof∣fing <HI>Pharisees,</HI> saying unto you, give us of your Oil, for our Lamp are gone out. When you are revi∣led, revile not again; when you suffer threaten not, commit your Souls into the Hands of him that judg∣eth Righteously: For behold the Day cometh when the Children of God shall speak for themselves.</P>
<P>The Wise Virgins in the Parable no doubt endu∣red the same cruel mockings as you may do; but as the Lamb before the Shearers is dumb, so in this Life o∣pened they not their Mouths, but now we find they can give their Enemies an Answer. <HI>Not so lest there be not enough for us and you, but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for your selves.</HI> These Words are not to be understood as tho' they were spoken in an insulting manner: For true Charity teaches us to use the worst of Sinners and our most bitter Enemies with the meekness and Gentleness of Christ. Tho' <HI>Di∣ves</HI> was in Hell, yet <HI>Abraham</HI> does not say thou vil∣lain, but only <HI>Son remember</HI>: And I am persuaded had it been in the Power of these Wise Vir∣gins, they would have dealt with the Foolish Virgins, as God knows I would willingly deal with my most inveterate Enemies, not only give them of their Oil, but also, exalt them to the Right Hand of God.—It was not then for want of Love but for Fear of want∣ing a sufficiency for themselves, that made them re∣turn this Answer, <HI>Not so, lest there be not enough for us and you:</HI> For they that have most Grace have none to spare, none but self Righteous, Foolish Virgins think they are good enough, or have already attained.— These who are truly Wise are always most distrustful of themselves, pressing forwards to the Things that are before, and think it well if after they have done <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, they can make their Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing and Election <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="14" REF="040181_0008_101621E942D41F00"/>
<HI>Not so, lest there be not enough for us and you; But go ye rather to them that sell and buy for your selves</HI>: These Words indeed seem to be spoken in a trium∣phant, but certainly they were utter'd in the most compassionate manner, <HI>go ye to them that sell and buy for your selves</HI>—Unhappy Virgins, you accounted our Lives Folly whilst with you in the Body—how often have you condemned us for our Zeal in run∣ning to hear the Word, and looked upon us as En∣thusiasts for talking about and affirming that we must be led by the Spirit, and walk by the Spirit and feel the Spirit of God witnessing with our Spirits that we are his Children? But now you would be glad to be partakers of this Priviledge, but it is not ours to give. —You contented yourselves with seeking when you should have been striving to enter in at the strait Gate —And now go to them that sell if you can and buy for yourselves.</P>
<P>And what say you to this, ye Foolish formal Pro∣fessors? For I doubt not but curiosity and novelty hath brought many such even to this despised Place to hear a Sermon, can you hear this Reply to the Fool∣ish Virgins, and yet not tremble? Why yet a little while, and thus it shall be done to you, rejoice and bolster your selves up in your Duties and Forms, en∣deavour to cover your Nakedness with the Fig Leaves of an outward Profession and a legal Righteousness, and despise the true Servants of Christ as much as you please, yet know that all your Hopes will fail you when God brings you into Judgment. <HI>For not him who commendeth himself is justified but he whom the Lord commendeth.</HI></P>
<P>But to return, we do not hear any Reply the Fool∣ish Virgins make—No, their Consciences condemn∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> them, like the Person in the Parable without a

wedding Garment, they are struck dumb and are now filled with anxious Thoughts how they shall buy Oil that they may lift up their Heads before the Bridegroom. <HI>But whilst they went to buy, v.</HI> 10. <HI>i. e.</HI> whilst they were thinking what they should do, the Bridgroom, the Lord Jesus, the Head, the King, the the Husband of his Spouse the Church, cometh at∣tended with Thousands and Twenty times Ten-thou∣sands of Saints and Angels publickly to count up his Jewels and they that were ready—the Wise Virgins who had Oil in their Lamps, and were sealed by his Spirit to the Day of Redemption, these having on a wedding Garment of an imputed Righteousness, and a new Nature, went in with him to the Marriage.</P>
<P>But who can express the Transports that these Wise Virgins felt when they were thus admitted in a Holy triumph into the presence and full enjoyment of him whom their Souls hungred and thirsted after! No doubt they had tasted of his Love, and by Faith had often fed on him in their Hearts when sitting down to commemorate his last Supper here on Earth, but how full may we think their Hearts and Tongues were of his Praises, when they see themselves sit down together to eat Bread in his Heavenly Kingdom? And what was best of all, the Door was shut, and shut them in to enjoy the ever blessed God and the Company of Angels and the Spirits of Just Men made perfect without Interruption for evermore. I say without Interruption: For in this Life their Eyes, often gush∣ed out with Water because Men kept not Gods Law, and they could never come to appear before the Lord, or to hear his Word, but Satan and his Emissaries would come also to disturb them; but now the Door is shut, now there is a perfect Communion of Saints, which they in vain longed for in this lower World.
<PB N="16" REF="040181_0009_101632C00B9C7D08"/>
Now Tares no longer grow up with the Wheat, not one single Hypocrite or unbeliever can skreen himself amongst them.—<HI>Now the wicked cease from troubling, and now their weary Souls enjoy an everlasting Rest.</HI></P>
<P>Once more O Believers, let me exhort you in Pa∣tience to possess your Souls—God if he has freely justified you by Faith in his Son, and given you his Spirit, has sealed you to be his; and has secured you as surely as he secured <HI>Noah</HI> when he locked him in the Ark. But tho' Heirs of God and joint Heirs with Christ, and neither Men or Devils can pluck you out of your Heavenly Fathers Hands, yet you must be tossed about with manifold Temptations; but lift up your Heads, the Day of your perfect compleat Redemption draweth nigh.—Behold the Bridegroom cometh to take you to himself, the Door shall be shut and you shall be forever with the Lord.</P>
<P>But I even tremble to tell you, O nominal Christi∣ans that the Door will be shut, I mean the Door of Mercy, never never to be opened to give you Ad∣mission, tho' you should continue knocking to all E∣ternity. For thus speaks our Lord <HI>v.</HI> 11. <HI>After∣wards,</HI> i. e. <HI>after those that were ready had went in, and the Door was shut.</HI> After they had to their Sorrow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound that no Oil was to be bought, no Grace be procured, came also the other Virgins and, as <HI>Esau</HI> after <HI>Jacob</HI> had got the Blessing, cryed with an exceeding bitter Cry, bless me, even me also Oh my Father; so they come saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us.—Observe the Importunity of these Foolish Virgins implyed in these Words Lord, Lord,— Whilst in the Body, I suppose they only read; but did not pray over their Prayers: If you would tell them they should pray without ceasing, they should pray from their Hearts, and feel the want of what
<PB N="17" REF="040181_0009_101632C00B9C7D08"/>
they prayed for, they would answer they could not tell what you meant by inward Feelings, that God did not require us to be always on our Knees, but if a Man did justly, and loved Mercy, and did as the Church Forms required him it was as much as the Lord required at his Hands.</P>
<P>I fear Sirs, too many amongst us, are of this Mind. Nay I fear there are many so polite, so void of the Love of God, as to think it too great a Piece of self-denial to rise early to offer up a Sacrifice of Praise and Thanksgiving acceptable to God thro' Jesus Christ.—If any such by the good Providence of God are brought hither this Morning, I beseech you consider your Ways and remember if you are not awakened out of your Spiritual Lethargy, and live a Life of Prayer here, you shall in vain cry out with the Foolish Virgins Lord, Lord, open unto us here∣after.—Observe Further, the Impudence, as well as importunity of these other Virgins Lord, Lord, say they—as tho' they were intimately acquainted with the Holy Jesus, like Numbers amongst us, who be∣cause they go to Church, repeat their Creeds, re∣ceive the blessed Sacrament, think they have a Right to call Jesus their Saviour, and dare call God their Father when they puts up the Lords Prayer.—But Jesus is not your Saviour.—The Devil not God is your Father, unless your Hearts are purified by Faith, and you are born again from above.—It's not meerly being baptized by Water, but being born again of the Holy Ghost that must qualify you for Salvation; and it will do you no Service at the great Day to say unto Christ, Lord my Name is in the Register of such and such a Parish.—I am persuaded the Foolish Virgins could say this and more, but what Answer did Jesus make? He answered and said v. 12. <HI>Verily,
<PB N="18" REF="040181_0010_101808DA74BEB368"/>
I say unto you,</HI> He puts the Word VERILY to assure them he was in earnest—<HI>I say unto you—I am Truth it self—I whom you have owned in Words, but in Works denied, VERILY I say unto you I know you not.</HI> These Words must not be understood literrally: For what ever <HI>Arians</HI> and <HI>Socinians</HI> may say to the con∣trary, yet we affirm that Jesus Christ is God, God blessed for ever, and therefore knoweth all Things. —He saw <HI>Nathaniel</HI> when under the Fig-Trees— He sees and is now looking down from Heaven his Dwelling Place upon us to see how we behave in these Fields.—Brethren I know nothing of the Thoughts and Intents of your Hearts, in coming hither; but Jesus Christ he knows who come like new born Babes desirous to be fed with the sincere Milk of the Word. And he knows who come to hear what the Babler says, and to run away with Part of a broken Sentence that they may hereof accuse him—This Expression then <HI>I know you not,</HI> must not be understood literral∣ly, No, it implys a knowledge of Approbation as tho' Christ had said you call me Lord, Lord, but you have not done the Things that I have said.—You de∣sire me to open the Door, but how can you come in hither not having on a wedding Garment? Alas you are naked as you came into the World, where is my out∣ward Righteousness imputed to you? Where is my inherent Righteousness wrought in you? Where is my Divine Image stamped upon your Souls? How dare you call me Lord, Lord, when you have not received the Holy Ghost, whereby I seal all that are truly mine. <HI>Verily I know you not, depart from me ye Cursed into everlasting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</HI></P>
<P>And now he that hath Ears to hear, let him hear what manner of Persons these were whom Jesus
<PB N="19" REF="040181_0010_101808DA74BEB368"/>
Christ dismissed with this Answer.—Remember I en∣treat you, remember they are not sent away for being Fornicators, Swearers, Sabbath breakers, or Prodigals. No, In all probability as I observ'd before, they were, touching the outward Observances of the Moral Law, blameless—They were constant as to the Form of Religion; and if they did no good, yet no one could say they did any One any harm.—The only Thing for which they were condemned and eternally banish∣ed from the Presence of the Lord (for so much is implyed in that Sentence <HI>I know you not</HI>) was this, they had no Oil in their Lamps—No Principle of a true living Faith, and Holiness in their Hearts.— And good God! If Persons may go to Church, re∣ceive the Sacrament, lead honest moral Lives, and yet be sent to Hell at the last Day, as they certainly will be if they advance no further; where wilt thou O Drunkard? Where wilt thou O Swearer? Where wilt thou O Sabbath breaker? Where wilt thou that deniest Divine Revelation, and even the Form of God∣liness, where wilt thou and such like Sinners appear? I know very well where.—You must appear before the dreadful Tribunal of Jesus Christ.—For however you may like <HI>Felix</HI> put off the Prosecution of your Con∣victions, yet you as well as others must arise after Death and appear in Judgment.—You will then find to your eternal Sorrow what I just hinted at in the beginning of this Discourse, <HI>viz.</HI> that your Damna∣tion slumbereth not, Sin has blinded your Hearts, and hardened your Foreheads now; but yet a little while and our Lord will ease him of his Adversaries.—Me∣thinks already by Faith I see the Heavens opened, and the Holy Jesus coming with his Face brighter than Ten-thousand Suns, darting Fury upon you from

his Eyes—Methinks I see you rising from your Graves trembling and astonished, and crying out who can abide this Day of his coming.</P>
<P>And now what Inference shall I draw from what has been deliver'd? Our Lord in the Words of the Text has drawn one for me, <HI>watch therefore for ye know neither the Day nor the Hour wherein the Son of Man cometh.</HI></P>
<P>Watch, that is, be upon your Guard and keep your Graces in continual exercises: For as when we are com∣manded to watch unto Prayer, it signifies that we should continue instant in that Duty, so when we are requi∣red to watch, in general it means that we should put on the whole Armour of God and live every Day as tho' it was our last. And Oh that the Lord may now enable me to lift up my Voice like a Trumpet! For had I a Thousand Tongues, or could I speak so loud that the whole World might hear me, I could not sound a more useful Alarm, than that which is contained in the Words of the Text, watch therefore, my Brethren, I beseech you by the Mercies of God in Christ Jesus, <HI>Watch, be upon your Guard, Awake ye that sleep in the Dust: For ye know neither the Day nor the Hour wherein the Son of Man cometh,</HI> perhaps to Day, perhaps this Midnight, the CRY may be made: For in a Moment, in a twikling of an Eye, the Trump is to Sound.—However supposing the Final Day of Judgment may yet be a great Way off, yet the Day of Death is certainly near at Hand: For what is our Life? It is but a Vapour, it is but a Span long, so soon passeth it away and we are gone, blessed be God we are all here well.—But who out of this great Mul∣titude dares say, I shall go home to my House in safety? Who knows but whilst I am speaking, God may commis∣sion his ministring Spirits, immediately to call some of

you away by a sudden Stroke to give an Account with what Attention you have heard this Sermon, you know my Brethren some such Instances we have lately had given us.—And what Angel or Spirit hath assured us that some of you shall not be the next? <HI>Watch there∣fore for ye know neither the Day nor the Hour where∣in the Son of Man will come.</HI>—And it is chiefly for this Reason, that God has hid the Day of our Deaths from us? For since I know not but I may die to morrow, why O my Soul may each of us say, wilt thou not watch to Day? Since I know not but I may die the next Moment, why wilt thou not prepare for dy∣ing this? —Many such Reflections as these, my Bre∣thren crowd in upon my Mind. At present blessed be the Lord who delights to magnify his Strength in a poor Worms weakness. I am at a stand, not so much about what shall I say, as what I shall leave unsaid. My Belly, like <HI>Elihu's,</HI> is as it were full of new Wines,—out of the abundance of my Heart my Mouth speaketh. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> so great a Multitude standing before me, a Sense of the Infinite Majesty of that God in whose Name I preach and before whom I as well as you must appear to give an Account of, and the uncertainty there is whether I shall live ano∣ther Day to speak to you any more—These Consi∣derations I say, especially the Presence of God which I now feel upon my Soul furnishes me with so much Matter, that I scarce know where to begin or where to end my Application.—However for Methods sake, by the the Divine Assistance, I will branch it in two several Particulars.</P>
<P>And first, I would remind you that are notoriously Ungodly in the Language of what our Lord says in the Text: For tho' I have said that your Damnation slumbereth not whilst you continue in an Impenitent
<PB N="22" REF="040181_0012_101809D19F172310"/>
State. Yet that was only to set you upon your watch to convince you of your Danger, and excite you to cry out, <HI>what shall we do to be saved</HI>? I appeal to all that hear me, whether I have said the Door of Mercy should be shut against you if you believe on Jesus Crhist. No, If you are the chief of Sinners, if you are Murderers of Fathers, Murderers of Mothers, if you are emphatically the Dung and Offscouring of all Things —yet if you believe on Jesus Christ and cry unto him with the same Faith as the expiring Thief, <HI>Lord remember me now thou art in thy King∣dom.</HI> I will pawn my eternal Salvation upon it, if he does not shortly translate you to his Heavenly Para∣dise, wonder not at my speaking with so much assu∣rance: For I know this is a Faithful and true Saying, and worthy all Acceptation that Jesus Christ came into the World to save all truly convicted and Be∣lieving Sinners: Nay so great is his Love that I am persuaded was it necessary he would come again into the World and die a second Time for them on the Cross.—But blessed be God—when our Lord bowed down his Head, and gave up the Ghost, our Re∣demotions was finished, it's not our Sins but our want of a lively Faith in his Blood that will prove our Con∣demnation: If you draw near to him by Faith, tho' ye are the worst of Sinners, yet he will not say unto you, <HI>Verily I know you not,</HI>—No, a Door of Mercy shall be opened to you—look then, look then by an Eye of Faith to that Godman whom you have pierc∣ed.—Behold him ble<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing, panting, dying upon the Cross, with Arms s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>thed out ready to embrace you all, hark how he groans, see how all Nature is in an Agony: The Rocks rend, the Graves open, the Sun withdraws its Light, ashamed as it were to see the God of Nature Suffer, and all this to usher in Man's
<PB N="23" REF="040181_0012_101809D19F172310"/>
great Redemtion.—Nay the Holy Jesus in the very Agonies and Pangs of Death, prays for his very Mur∣derers: <HI>Father forgive them for they know not what they do.</HI>—What then if you have crucified the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open Shame, yet do not despair, only believe and even this shall be forgiven. You have read, at least you have heard no doubt how Three-thousand were converted at St. <HI>Peters</HI> preach∣ing one single Sermon, after our Lords Ascention in∣to Heaven; and many of the Crucifiers of the Lord of Glory und<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>edly were amongst them, and why should you despair? For Jesus Christ is the same Yesterday to Day and forever: The Holy Ghost shall be sent down on you as well as on them, if you do but believe: For Christ ascended upon High to re∣ceive this Gift even for the vilest of Men.—Come then <HI>All ye that are weary and heavy laden, with a Sense of your Sins, lay hold on Christ by Faith, and he will give you Rest.</HI>—For Salvation is the free Gift of God to all them that believe, and tho' you may think this too good News to be true, yet I speak the Truth in Christ I lye not, this is the Gospel, this is the glad Tydings which we are Commissioned to preach to every Creature, be not Faithless then; but believing, let not the Devil lead you Captive at his will any longer: For all the Wages he gives his Servants is Death, Death often in this Life, Death e∣verlasting in the next: But now the free Gift of God is eternal Life to all that believe in Jesus Christ— <HI>Pharisces</HI> are and will be offended at my coming here and offering you Salvation on such cheap Terms—but the more they bid me hold my Peace the more will I cry out and proclaim to convicted Sinners, Jesus <HI>David's</HI> Son according to the Flesh, but <HI>David's</HI> Lord as he was God, will have Mercy upon all that by a living
<PB N="24" REF="040181_0013_101809D5AF804B28"/>
Faith truly turn to him.—If this is to be vile, I pray God I may be more vile.—If they will not let me preach Christ crucified, and offer Salvation to poor Sinners in a Church, I will preach him in the Lanes, Streets, Highways and Hedges; and nothing pleases me bet∣ter than to think, I am now in one of the Devils strongest Holds—Surely the Lord has not sent me and all you hither for nothing. No, blessed be God, the Fields are white ready unto Harvest, and many Souls I hope will be gathered into his Heavenly Gar∣ner—It's true it's the Midnigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Church especially the poor Church of <HI>England</HI>; but God has lately sent forth his Servants to CRY, <HI>Behold the Bridegroom cometh.</HI> I beseech you O Sinners heark∣en unto the Voice, let me espouse you by Faith to my dear Master, and hence forward <HI>watch and pray</HI> that you may be ready to go forth to meet him.</P>
<P>Secondly, I would apply my self to those amongst you that are not openly prophane, but by depending on a Formal round of Duties, deceive your own Souls, and are only Foolish Virgins.—But I must speak to your Conviction rather than your Comfort—My dear Brethren, do not deceive your own Souls—You have heard how far the foolish Virgins went and yet were answered with a <HI>verily I know you not</HI>: The Reason is because none but such that have a living Faith in Jesus Christ, and are truly born again, can possibly enter into the Kingdom of Heaven: You may perhaps live honest, and Outwardly moral Lives, but if you depend on that Morality, or join your Works with your Faith, in order to justifie you before God, you have no Lot or Share in Christs Redemp∣tion: For what is this but to deny the Lord that has bought you? What is this but making yourselves your own Saviours—taking the Crown from Jesus
<PB N="25" REF="040181_0013_101809D5AF804B28"/>
Christ and putting it on your own Heads: The Crime of the Devil some have supposed consisted in this, that he would not bow to Jesus Christ when he came into the World as Mediator and the Father commanded all the Angels to worship him, and what do you less? You will not own and submit to his Righteousness, and tho' you pretend to worship him with your Lips, yet your Hearts are far from him, besides you in Ef∣fect deny the Operations of his blessed Spirit, you mis∣take common for effectual Grace, you hope to be sa∣ved because you have good desires and a few short con∣victions; and wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is this, but to give God, his Word and all his Saints the Lye? A Jew, a Turk, has equally as good Grounds whereon to build his Hopes of Salvation. Need I not then need to cry out to you: Ye Foolish Virgins <HI>watch,</HI> beg of God to convince you of your self Righteousness, and the secret Unbe∣lief of your Hearts or otherwise whensoever—The Cry shall be made, <HI>Behold the Bridegroom cometh.</HI> You will find yourselves utterly unprepared to go forth to meet him—You may cry Lord, Lord; but the Answer will be, <HI>Verily I know you not.</HI>—Thirdly I would speak a Word or two by Way of Exhortation to those who are Wise Virgins, and are assured that they have on a Wedding Garment. That there are many such amongst you, who by Grace have renoun∣ced your own Righteousness, and know that the Righteousness of the Lord Jesus is imputed to them. I make no doubt God has his secret Ones in the worst of Times, and I am persuaded he has not let so loud <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Gospel Cry to be made amongst his People as of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate has been heard for nothing. No, I am confi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent the Holy Ghost has been given to it of Faith and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as powerfully fallen upon many whilst they have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earing the Word: You are now then no longer foolish
<PB N="26" REF="040181_0014_101808D8F1006F00"/>
but wise Virgins, notwithstanding, I beseech you also suffer the Word of Exhortation: For wise Virgins are too apt, Whilst the Bridegroom tarries, to slum∣ber and sleep. Watch therefore, my dear Brethren, watch and pray at this Time especially, for perhaps a Time of suffering is at hand.—The Ark of the Lord begins already to be driven into the Wilderness.—Be ye therefore upon your Watch, and still persevere in following your Lord even without the Camp bearing his Reproach: The Cry that has been lately made has awakened the Devil and his Servants, they begin to rage horribly and well they may: For I hope their Kingdom is in danger, watch therefore, my dear Bre∣thren for if we are not always upon our Guard, a Time of Tryal may overtake us unawares, and in∣stead of owning like <HI>Peter,</HI> we may be tempted to de∣ny our Master. Set Death and Eternity often before you, look unto Jesus the Author and Finisher of your Faith, and consider how little a while it will be ere he comes to Judgment, and then our Reproach shall be wiped away: The Accusers of us and our Brethren shall be cast down, and we all shall be shut in Hea∣ven for ever with our dear Lord Jesus.</P>
<P>Lastly, what I say unto you I say unto all, <HI>WATCH,</HI> High and Low, Rich and Poor, Young and Old one with another, I beseech you by the Mercies of Jesus whom I am now preaching, be upon your Guard, fly, fly, to Jesus Christ that Heavenly Bridegroom; behold he desires to take you to himself, miserable, poor, blind and naked as you are, yet he is willing to cloath you with his everlasting Righteousness, and make you partakers of that Glory which he enjoyed with the Father before the World began. Oh! do not turn a deaf Ear to me, do not reject the Message on ac∣count of the meaness of the Messenger: I am a Child,
<PB N="27" REF="040181_0014_101808D8F1006F00"/>
a Youth of uncircumcised Lips; but the Lord has chosen me that the Glory might be all his own: Had he sent to invite you by a learned <HI>Rabbi,</HI> you might have been tempted to think the Man had done something; but now God has sent a Child that cannot speak, that the Excellency of the Power may be seen not to be of Man but of God. Let the learned <HI>Pharisees</HI> then despise my Youth.—I care not how vile I appear in the sight of such Men, I glory in it.—And I am persuaded if any of you should be married to Christ by this preaching, you will have no Reason to repent when you come to Heaven, that God sent a Child to cry <HI>Behold the Bridegroom cometh.</HI> Oh! my Brethren the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hought of being Instrumental in bring∣ing one of you to Glory, fills me with fresh Zeal. My Brethren once more I intreat you <HI>WATCH, WATCH,</HI> and pray for the Lord Jesus will receive all that call upon him Faithfully, let that CRY, <HI>Behold the Bride∣groom cometh,</HI> be continually sounding in your Ears; and begin now to live as tho' you were assured this Night you were to go forth to meet him. I cou'd say more, but the other Business and Duties of the Day oblige me to stop. May the Lord give you all an hearing Ear and Obedient Heart, and so closely unite you to himself by one Spirit, that when he shall come in a terrible Majesty to judge Mankind, you may be found having on a Wedding Garment, and ready to go in with him to the Marriage.</P>
