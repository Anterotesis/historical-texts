<BIBL>II. KINGS, II. CHAP. 12 VERSE.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>And Elisha saw it, and he cried, my Father, my Father! the Chariot of Israel, and the Horse-men thereof. And he saw him no more; and he took hold of his own Clothes and rent them in two pieces.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MY FATHER, MY FATHER! <HI>The Chariot of Israel, and the Horse-men thereof:</HI>—This is the pa∣thetic cry of Elisha, on the removal of Elijah from his head, by a whirlwind into heaven, never more to be seen! He very sensibly felt the loss; he bitterly lamented it, by expressions and actions, indicating great agitation of mind; and the deepest sorrow of heart: He lift up his voice and wept: He took hold of his clothes, and rent them in pieces; intimating, the sincerity of his affection to his departed friend; the affliction of his bleeding heart at the mourn∣ful event.</P>
<P><HI>My Father, my Father!</HI> The words experts the light in which he viewed him, as standing in the relation of a kind and tender <HI>Father,</HI> who had ad∣ministred to his instruction, protection, and com∣fort. The repetition of the terms, <HI>my Father, my Father!</HI> shews the fullness of his heart; his <HI>delight,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="037989_0004_100F6FD6357C5A30"/>
his <HI>melancholy delight</HI> in using the name, <HI>my Father, my dear Father,</HI> is no more!</P>
<P>The <HI>Chariot of Israel,</HI> and the <HI>Horse-men</HI> thereof. What an encomium is this, upon Elijah, as a pub∣lic blessing? Chariots and Horse-men were used as means in defence of the country: Elijah is here considered as equal to all the armies of Israel; to their Chariots and Horse-men prepared for war, in respect to his influence and beneficence; and Elisha laments that this, the glory and defence of Israel, was departed; is extremely affected at the public loss, sustained by such a serious, melancholy Providence.</P>
<P>These words may serve to suggest some thoughts, and excite sentiments and affections in our hearts, proper to be cherished on the present occasion for which they are chosen,<ABBR>viz.</ABBR> To improve the Provi∣dence of GOD in the removal of GEORGE WASHINGTON by death. Who, has been a <HI>Father</HI> and friend to our country; and who, in the important stations he filled as President and General, was as the Chariots and Horse-men of our Israel; in∣strumental as our political saviour.</P>
<P>The Lord JEHOVAH must be acknowledged as the supreme Governor among the nations; to use such means as he pleaseth to plant and build them up; and it becomes us to take notice of the opera∣tions of his hands; to notice the instruments he rais∣eth up, and blesseth for the good of his people; to give honor, to whom honor is due, and also, sincere∣ly to regret the loss of such, as have been Fathers and Benefactors to us.</P>

<ITEM>I. Let us consider the goodness of GOD to his people, in appearing for them under national trou∣bles, and raising up men of distinguished abilities and accomplishments, to be public blessings.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. We should seriously notice the Providence in their removal by death, and lament the loss of them.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>These propositions, if largely discussed, would open an extensive field for meditations, and lead me to further reflections upon the interposition of heaven in our behalf heretofore, than I have time at present to make; and, to give a minute detail of the character of our late beloved President and General, which may be more proper for an historian to describe, than for the preacher to relate.</P>
<P>But let us attend to some general thoughts that arise from the observations made on the text.</P>
<P>I. Consider the goodness of GOD to his people, in appearing for them under national troubles, and raising up men of distinguished abilities and accom∣plishments, to be public blessings.</P>
<P>In this case, Elijah was raised up to be a special blessing to the t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> tribes of Israel: He acted indeed <HI>principally</HI> in the ecclesiastical line, as a prophet of the LORD, to instruct and reform the people: but in this way he entered upon the most direct method to become a benefactor; for righteousness exalteth a nation; and in righteousness alone, shall it be estab∣lished. And we find him giving most salutary counsel to kings, how to conduct for the peace and happiness of the country.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="037989_0006_100F6FDB1A21AE98"/>
It was in a time of affliction, of great distress among the people, when GOD raised him up to be an eminent blessing to them. For, after the ten tribes had broken off from the house of David; their kings, for political reasons, seduced the people, and restrained them from attending the stated wor∣ship of GOD at Jerusalem; whereupon they fell into idolatry. This provoked the LORD to expose them to the will of their enemies, who grievously oppres∣sed them.</P>
<P>If we look back from this period to preceding ages of the Jewish Nation, we shall find their history will furnish us with many instances of the LORD'S appearing for their deliverance, when reduced to extremities. Presently after their settlement in the promised land, their enemies devised against them, to deprive them of their privileges, to rob them of the fruits of their labor, and make slaves of them; but when they cried unto the Lord, he had pity on them: He raised up and qualified with eminent talents, those who rescued them and wrought great salvation; Men to be Judges, Counsellors and Ge∣nerals of Armies.</P>
<P>The book of Judges contains an history of diverse instances of this kind, which is worthy perusing at this time, that our reflections may excite pious af∣fections of soul, to that God, who is so gracious in interposing, to redress the grievances of his people.</P>
<P>A very memorable instance on sacred record, is that of David's being raised from keeping sheep, to
<PB N="7" REF="037989_0007_100F6FDE018753B0"/>
be the head of the states or tribes of Israel. The nation at this period, was in the utmost distress and affliction. The government was dissolved, or exer∣cised in the most arbitrary, tyrannical manner. Civil war among themselves; the enemy entering into the heart of the country. Without were fightings, with∣in were fears, and great perplexities. David appeared by the appointment of God; and meeting the suf∣frages of the people: the enemy from abroad was subdued; Peace restored at home; the union of the tribes cordially affected and cemented; the govern∣ment established and secured, and a foundation laid for the most flourishing kingdom and happy people, in the next reign, that can be found in the annals of history.</P>
<P>And have not we experienced, are not we living witnesses of the great goodness of GOD to us, as a na∣tion, in raising up for us, in time of extremity, a <HI>de∣liverer,</HI> in the person of GEORGE WASHING∣TON, our late beloved <HI>President and General?</HI> Though many have done worthily, and have hon∣or from their fellow-citizens; yet none, I trust, will think we mean to derogate from them, when we say he hath excelled them all: considering the impor∣tant stations he so illustriously filled for the public good.</P>
<P>The Father of the spirits of all flesh brought him upon the stage of action, and gave him to this peo∣ple, when there was special need of his aid and assist∣ance. The extremity and distresses of the country at
<PB N="8" REF="037989_0008_100F6FE1628ADD70"/>
that period, are so recent, that they cannot be effac∣ed from our minds, and therefore I need not at present recapitulate them. Only to instance, that our liber∣ties were abridged and privileges wrested from our hands; our dear earned property siezed and plunder∣ed; our lives threatned; yea many of our friends and countrymen slain by the sword! in these ex∣tremities, when our eyes were unto the LORD of heaven and earth; he sent forth a <HI>deliverer,</HI> furnish∣ed with abilities for the important services designed in providence. As he had a large field to act in, many difficulties to encounter, and hardships to in∣dure▪ He was blest with a capacious mind; accu∣rate judgment, to discern men and things; an happy talent at diction; princely dignity of soul; great fortitude, tempered with moderation, conde∣scension and meekness; with unwearied patience and perseverance, fitted to preside in council to the great∣est advantage; and lead forth an host against the enemy with happy success. Being chosen of GOD and man to be the saviour of his country, he was endow∣ed with accomplishments, through the smiles of heaven, to obtain the important object. Scarce ever perhaps, so many eminent gifts and talents, entered into the character of one person, as in General WASHINGTON. Such majesty and condescen∣sion! which fitted him to perform great and illus∣trious deeds with honor; and the common actions of life, with so much affability and ease. Con∣sidering his tenderness and affection for the people; and benefactions to the country: with what pro∣priety
<PB N="9" REF="037989_0009_100F6FE2E589B5F0"/>
may we adopt the language of my text? <HI>My Father my Father! the Chariot of Israel and the Horse-men thereof.</HI> As a Father, he engaged without stipend or reward, only a bare support of his house-hold, to act as <HI>General</HI> of the united forces of <HI>Amer∣ica</HI> against the enemy. What pure disinterested be∣nevolence prompted and animated him to undertake in such an important department; and indure in∣credible hardships and severest trials, with astonish∣ing patience almost of a christian Martyr?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of this condescension and parental affection to such as are in the lower walks of life, I was witness to a very delicate instance. Riding into a po∣pulous town in the midst of thousands, who received him with the greatest cordiality and joy:—He alighted at the place of his lodgings, and imme∣diately went forth to a gate fronting the main-street, to attend a procession of youth, members of the several schools: Who were arranged in divisions, preceded by their respective Instructors. While they paid their humble respects to <HI>him,</HI> he bowed to <HI>them</HI> with a most amiable smile: And his countenance, the Index of the soul, shewed the affection and tenderness of a Father indeed—The impressions of such a scene, I believe, will never be effaced from the grateful hearts of those who were present.</NOTE> And such was his same and influence, may we not say, they were equal to an army of Chariots and Horse-men?</P>
<P>It may be further worthy remarking the goodness of GOD; and in honor to him whom he raised up in our behalf; that he was not atheistical or deistical in his principles, to influence the people to forsake the worship of the true GOD; like Jeroboam, who headed the seperation from the arbitrary King of Judah. But he shewed a profound reverence for the Deity, a regard for the divine oracles, and the insti∣tutions of holy worship, and earnestly recommended us by repeated proclamations, humbly to acknow∣ledge our dependence on the care and blessing of Hea∣ven, for all desired prosperity and happiness. What an
<PB N="10" REF="037989_0010_100F6FE6A8088130"/>
happy circumstance is it, at this day of increasing in∣fidelity, that one of WASHINGTON's station and influence, hath appeared to check its progress? Who by his counsil and example hath given his testi∣mony in behalf of our holy religion? A religion accompanied with full evidences of its divinity; tending to refine and purify the human nature; and raise it to the highest glory and felicity: A re∣ligion designed and calculated to promote our best good in time and eternity. To this religion, the GREAT WASHINGTON subscribed, and ear∣nestly recommended to the people in his affection∣ate farewell Address, when he retired from public, to private life! and yet some of an inferior rank, glory in their infidelity, as though wisdom must live and die with them.</P>
<P>But WASHINGTON is no more!</P>
<P>This great and illustrious personage is withdawn from this theatre of action to receive, we trust, a glo∣rious reward in heaven. But though taken from our sight, affectionate thoughts of him are not eras∣ed from our minds. His memory is deeply record∣ed in the grateful hearts of <HI>millions.</HI> His illustri∣ous achievements, his eminent services are immor∣talized, they are imprinted in indelible characters, to be read and known of all; to be conveyed down from parents to children, to the latest posterity.</P>
<P>What thankfulness, does it become us to cherish in our hearts to the blessed GOD, for raising up so
<PB N="11" REF="037989_0011_100F6FE82A5AF8C8"/>
seasonably for us, such a public benefactor? and should not we be deeply impressed at the same time with unfeigned grief at the loss of so great a blessing?</P>
<P>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away! let us subscribe, blessed be the name of the Lord: and say, that he is holy and righteous in so doing; humbly submiting to the rebuke of providence.</P>
<P>Let us not despise the chastening of the Lord, nor faint under his corrections; but make those re∣flections, which become us as men and christians.</P>
<P>II. We ought to take serious notice of the Provi∣dence in the removal of eminent benefactors by death, and regret the loss of them.</P>
<P>It is true they are but men, and like men they die; agreeably to the sentence passed upon all the human race: yet, as the gift of such men is a great blessing; the removal of them is a frown of Provi∣dence. There is so much virtue taken from the earth, that cannot well be spared; there is such an useful example removed from our eyes, which is needed to stimulate survivors. And though the chief design of their being raised up, may be answered; yet in their retirement, their counsels and prayers might be beneficial: in their removal, so much of our glory is departed; so much of our defence taken away, and proportionably we are left feeble and exposed.</P>
<P>Nature dictates, scripture precepts and examples confirm the sentiment, that the loss of our fathers
<PB N="12" REF="037989_0012_100F6FEA970C5C30"/>
and public benefactors, should be seriously noticed and lamented by survivors.</P>
<P>As natural affections prompt to mourn the loss of dear kindred; painfully to lament the vacancy left in the heart; so social affections and such▪as arise from benefits received, will excite symphathetic sensations in the grateful soul.</P>
<P>Gratitude and due respect to the living will la∣ment the dead. Those tender feelings of soul will be sensibly touched; and springs of sorrow burst forth in correspondent expressions. Ingratitude is a prin∣ciple of the basest kind, a bitter root of iniquity superlatively great! When there arose a King in Egypt that knew not <HI>Joseph,</HI> who had been the father of the country, and the greatest benefactor the na∣tion ever enjoyed; the most barbarous plan was laid, and executed in part, that could enter the de∣praved heart of man, to conceive of. But gratitude and esteem for worthy deeds, and worthy characters, call forth to view whatever has a tendency to em∣balm their memories, and convey their names down to posterity with sweet perfume. Thus <HI>David</HI> felt for his dear friend deceased. "I am distressed for thee, my brother <HI>Jonathan;</HI> very pleasant hast thou been unto me."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">II. Samuel, 1. 26.</NOTE></P>
<P>As nature dictates and invites to mourn on such occasions, so scripture teaches the propriety, and gives instances of seriously noticing such scenes. The sons of <HI>Jacob</HI> mourned at his death with a great and fore
<PB N="13" REF="037989_0013_100F6FEF05C80E88"/>
lamentation, insomuch that the neighboring nations took notice of it as a <HI>grievous</HI> mourning. When <HI>Moses</HI> died, the children of <HI>Israel</HI> held thirty days mourning at the affecting providence. "All <HI>Judah</HI> and <HI>Jerusalem</HI> mourned for <HI>Josiah,"</HI> at his decease. "And <HI>Jeremiah</HI> the prophet lamented him." He penned a funeral dirge on the occasion: "And all the singing men, and singing women, spake of <HI>Jo∣siah</HI> in their lamentations, and made them an ordi∣nance in <HI>Israel;"</HI> behold, "they are written in the Lamentations."</P>
<P>To weep, is human; is christian; is GODLIKE. "JESUS wept." It evidences a tender heart, im∣pressed with pious and virtuous affections. It is an honor to a people to express a sense of their loss of great benefactors in solemn mourning. It shews that they are not barbarous and uncivilized; but enlightened, well informed, benevolent, virtuous. It will get them a name and praise in the world. And when sincerely done, will meet the approbation of Heaven.</P>
<P>Decent mourning for the loss of worthy charac∣racters, is sanctioned by divine authority; and tho' it no way affects the dead, it may benefit the living. In cherishing pious reflections on the Providence, their melting hearts are made more susceptible of divine impressions, in exciting humbleness of mind, and se∣rious meditations on their own frailty.</P>
<P>If great men, and the mighty are fallen, surely then may we say, men of low degree are vanity, and
<PB N="14" REF="037989_0014_100F6FF1E5B1D760"/>
must be laid in the dust; also in attending such scenes, it may serve to call off our dependence from the creature, the most exalted; and place our trust in GOD, who, only hath immortality. "Put not your trust in Princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help. His breath goeth forth, he re∣turneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish. Happy is he that hath the GOD of <HI>Jacob</HI> for his help; whose hope is in the LORD his GOD."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">146 Psalm, 3, 4, 5.</NOTE> Again further, in reflecting upon the respect shewn to worthy characters, and who have deserved well of their country, it may stimulate survivors to worthy deeds themselves, to go and do likewise. To be in∣fluenced principally by the praise of men, is too ser∣vile, and dangerous; yet, a proper degree is ani∣mating, and may not be hurtful or ensnaring; pro∣vided a sense of duty, and the honor that cometh from GOD only be uppermost in the heart.</P>
<P>As the eye affects the heart, funeral processions, and outward forms of mourning, may serve to ex∣cite tender feelings in the soul. A sort of mechani∣cal influence will arise from associating with mourn∣ers, and viewing their faces bedewed with unfeigned tears. We <HI>shall</HI> weep, with those that weep. Hence, such impressions will be made, as cannot be easily effaced from the mind, and will tend to excite serious reflections, that may be very useful in future life.</P>
<P>We honor our deceased friends, when we imitate their virtues, and follow them so far as they followed CHRIST our divine Redeemer. In this, we shew
<PB N="15" REF="037989_0015_100F6FF367935518"/>
greater respect to their memories and esteem for their merits; than by repeated lamentations, clothed in sackcloth, and shedding tears on their graves.—Though dead, yet speaking, they cry; whatsoever things are true, honest, just and pure; whatsoever things are lovely, and of good report; if there be a∣ny virtue, if there be any praise, think on these things. Similar to this, our father and friend WASHING∣TON, when living, counselled us, and exemplified in his conduct. Among all the honors shewn him at his decease, shall we deny him that which is the greatest of all? Will we refuse to imitate his vir∣tues; his piety, his benevolence, and his public spirit.</P>
<P>In commemorating the loss of great and useful men, such as the late beloved General WASH∣INGTON; while we give honor to whom honor is due, we are better instructed, than to use servile adulation, like slaves, who live on the breath of their Lords; or like the heathen, who deified their heroes and revered them as Gods. Doubtless many of the heathen gods originated from the people, extolling the characters of their generals and emperors to an excessive height, and placing them above the stars.</P>
<P>But our religion teaches us, that there is but one GOD, supreme over all. That all gifts and accom∣plishments are derived from him; and those who are furnished with them, should be honored for God's sake, whose servants they are; should be hon∣ored for their <HI>own</HI> sakes, when improving and using
<PB N="16" REF="037989_0016_100F6FF6D23BD8C0"/>
their talents well; and the remov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of them by death, should be sincerely lamented for <HI>our own</HI> sakes, that we are deprived of so great a blessing.</P>
<P>"A Prince and great man is fallen this day," in our Israel. "The LORD hath taken away the mighty man, and the man of war, and the Judge, and the prudent and antient. But let us not mourn as those that have no hope; but trust in the LORD who hath the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the spirit, to raise up in succession▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to preside and rule over us, as shall fear GOD and work righteousness.</P>
<P>As the sons of the Prophets said, "the spirit of <HI>Elijah</HI> doth rest on <HI>Elisha."</HI> Thanks be to GOD, that such an happy portion of the spirit of our de∣ceased <HI>General,</HI> and late <HI>President,</HI> doth rest on his successor, who is now the supreme magistrate of the <HI>Union.</HI> The LORD bless him!</P>
<P>Though we are bereaved of one who was a <HI>Father</HI> to the country, and many years our political head, yet our GOD liveth, and blessed be his name. Let us by a pious conduct secure his favor and blessing. Our Redeemer liveth forever more. Let us submit to him as the Captain of our Salvation; as the Leader and Commander of the People. Let us be <HI>his</HI> pious, humble, and peaceable subjects; who is the Prince of peace. Let us be good soldiers of JE∣SUS CHRIST; fight under his banner the good fight of faith; then he will lead us on to Glory; where death will be swallowed up in victory; immortal honors crown our Heads, and ineffable felicity re∣joice our Hearts.</P>
