<P>KNOW YE NOT THAT THERE IS A PRINCE AND A GREAT MAN FALLEN THIS DAY IN ISRAEL!</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHY, my brethren, are we assembled together? Why do I see your countenances sad, and your garb the garb of mourning? Why are our fel∣low-citizens throughout the United States, assembled in their various towns, this day? Yea, why are the free born sons of America, from New-Hampshire to Georgia, this day in mourning? Ah! why? Is our country invaded by a hostile foe, threatening imme∣diate destruction? No. Does famine prevail, and ex∣cite the people to supplicate the favour of God? No. Does the pestilence walk through our streets and cause groan to answer groan, and spread desolation through all our towns? No. The reason is this, <HI>A great man has fallen</HI> in America. Your beloved WASHING∣TON is no more. Yes: WASHINGTON, the great, the wise, the humane, the father of his country and the benefactor of man, has fallen into the icy arms of death. This, you are sensible, is the cause which has assembled us together: This is the reason why all United America this day mourns.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="037182_0005_100CE3B3C14ED6C0"/><HI>KNOW YE NOT THERE IS A GREAT MAN FALLEN IN ISRAEL!</HI></P>
<P>WASHINGTON was truly <HI>great.</HI> When difficul∣ties arose between America and her mother country, our situation seemed pitiable. Our country was in∣vaded by a nation accustomed to war, a nation fur∣nished with able generals and a well disciplined army, a nation powerful in arms. But we were in an in∣fant state, unprepared and comparatively weak. Our resources were small and our citizens were unlearned in the art of war. Considering, however, that our li∣berty and property were at stake, the free born sons of America awoke: They left the plow for the sword: They left their houses, their families, their wives and cildren in the hands of providence, and hastened away to face the enemy.</P>
<P>THOUGH, perhaps, we wanted not for lovers of our country and men of courage; yet we wanted experi∣enced commanders, and discipline in our troops. Why were we not overcome? The Lord was on our side. Soon we were provided with able generals and dis∣ciplined soldiers. Under the good providence of God, our strength increased, and our little band became of some consequence.</P>
<P>EARLY in the war the name of WASHINGTON resounded. The greatness of his mind began to shine. His wisdom, prudence and valour became conspicuous. Soon he was raised to the supreme command of our armies. He was the very man we wanted: the very man that providence designed for signal service to his country. He accepted the post assigned him, and was
<PB N="7" REF="037182_0006_100CE3B5CAF023F0"/>
unwearied in his attention to his army. Far from ostentatiou<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or haughtiness, he was plain and conde∣scending in his deportment. They who were under his command were used with that lenity and humanity as convinced them that their General was their friend. How beloved was he by his soldiers! Were he in danger a thousand swords would leap from their scab∣bards to defend their beloved chief.</P>
<P>HIS prudence directed him when to avoid the ene∣my; he had wisdom to contrive his operations in the field, in the best manner; and his courage never fail∣ed him in executing his plans, when the good of his country called. He was neither <HI>rash</HI> nor <HI>cowardly.</HI> Always calm, steady and resolute, he carried his points, with unexpected success. His army, knowing his wisdom, prudence and courage, were willing to fol∣low him wherever he led.</P>
<P>SUCH was the power of the enemy, and such were the disadvantages under which we laboured, that our army had to encounter many discouragements, and to pass through many adverse scenes. But the greatness of WASHINGTON's mind was able to overcome dis∣couragements. If the army began to despond, the presence of WASHINGTON inspired every soul with animation. If obstacles presented, and instilled faint∣ness into their minds, their WASHINGTON was at their head, and by his example and direction taught them to surmount the obstacles. In adverse scenes he was like the rock in the ocean, unmoved by dash∣ing waves. His mind was too great to despair. He knew how to bear adversity. Neither did prosperity intoxicate his mind so as to tempt him to lay aside
<PB N="8" REF="037182_0007_100CE3B7E860C6D8"/>
his wonted circumspection. In prosperity and adver∣sity he was the same, calm, firm, resolute and vigi∣lant. He continued to act the part of wisdom and courage till at length, with the aid of his brave sol∣diers and fellow-citizens, together with the assistance of a foreign ally, he gained the final victory: a vic∣tory, humbling indeed to the enemy: a victory which brought freedom and independence to our country. Hail! auspicious day! a day when liberty was en∣sured to brave Americans.</P>
<P>O America, long mayest thou retain that indepen∣dence for which thy sons have bravely fought. And long mayest thou remember him who headed thine armies to the field of battle, and led them forth to victory: Yes; long mayest thou remember the name of WASHINGTON.</P>
<P>PEACE being happily settled, WASHINGTON, unambitious, did not attempt to lord it over his bre∣thren; but modestly retired to live the life of a private citizen.</P>
<P>HIS country, however, did not long suffer him to taste the sweets of retired life.—When they who were chosen to frame a new and energetic constitution for their country, were assembled. WASHINGTON was among them, and was the man to preside over their deliberations. After an energetic tho' liberal constitution was framed and adopted, a man was want∣ed to hold the executive power. Americans, tho' by this time considerably numerous, and scattered over a vast tract of country; yet <HI>all</HI> with one voice exclaim WASHINGTON, <HI>none</HI> but WASHINGTON! The A∣merican
<PB N="9" REF="037182_0008_100CE3BB2E980638"/>
Hero again obeyed his country's call and was invested with the office of president of United America. This office he executed with wisdom and firmness, and to the general acceptance of his country∣men. He was not influened by fear or flattery, to loose sight of his duty to his country. When the term for which he was chosen expired, his country <HI>repeated</HI> the call, and he <HI>again</HI> obeyed his country's voice.—At length he resolved again to retire to the life of a private citizen. Not long, however, had he thus lived till difficulties arose, and it was thought necessary to raise new troops, and put the country in posture of defence. But who should be the man to take the charge of our troops? Who, but WASH∣INGTON? The <HI>brave Veteran</HI> again was called, and he <HI>even again</HI> accepted. He was consequently invested with the office of Lieut. General of the armies of United America: and this was the last office he sustained in the service of his country.</P>
<P>FROM the manner in which he fulfilled the duties of his several stations, WASHINGTON's <HI>greatness</HI> appeared.—</P>
<P>HE was <HI>great</HI> in <HI>abilities.</HI></P>
<P>No doubt, the God of nature endowed him with <HI>great</HI> native strength and penetration of mind. Con∣sidering the multiplicity of business which devolved upon his hands, and the active service of his country, in which he was continually kept, his <HI>acquired</HI> abilities were also great, greater, perhaps, than would have been the acquirements of almost any other man under like embarrassments. In his writings his acquired a∣bilities
<PB N="10" REF="037182_0009_100CE3BCC6F357B8"/>
shine with lustre. His compositions have been generally acknowledged to contain ideas which are noble and just. His stile was elegant, unaffected, concise and comprehensive. He easily conveyed his ideas in language which was directly to the point, without ostentation and circumlocution. When we view him in the field or the cabinet, in war or in peace, or in whatever station he held, we must be con∣vinced that he was a man <HI>great</HI> in abilities.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON was <HI>great</HI> in <HI>integrity.</HI> This was manifest through the whole of his life. Never have we heard of a treacherous act which he hath perform∣ed to his country. Great indeed and almost unlimit∣ed was the confidence which was placed in him; and he did not abuse the confidence. When we consi∣der his great foresight and his unbounded influence in the army, together with the confidence placed in him by the government, we may well suppose that if he had undertaken to betray his country, incalculable would have been our misfortunes. If WASHINGTON had been a traitor, where had been our liberty, our lives and property? But far be it from us to suppose that ever a treacherous idea entered his mind. When others proved traitors, <HI>he</HI> was the stedfast pillar not to be shaken. His integrity▪ was so undisputed that it has become proverbial not only in America, but Europe and the nations of the world.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON was a <HI>great</HI> lover of his country. Who will dispute this, when his whole life declared it? From his youth to his death was he not in the service of his country? Was he not faithful in this service? Was he not exceedingly active, firm and resolute in
<PB N="11" REF="037182_0010_100CE3BE6C8AC560"/>
his country's cause? Has he not ever sacrificed his private ease to the public welfare? Did he ever re∣fuse when his country called? No dangers, no risk of reputation, no domestic enjoyments, could keep him from boldly stepping forth to serve the publick. We have no reason to doubt but that the love of his coun∣try reigned in his heart, and the public good fired his soul to action.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON manifested a sense of the divine existence and of God's Government over nations and in∣dividuals—a sense of human dependence and men's ob∣ligations to acknowledge God's hand in all their con∣cerns—a sense of the importance of the Christian re∣ligion, in order for nations to be prospered and indi∣viduals to be happy.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON was a man of morality. We ne∣ver heard of him practising that profaneness too com∣mon in the army. We never heard of him from the gaming table. We never heard of him engorging the intoxicating draught. No. He was a man of temperance—a man of exemplary deportment—a man of morality. This was his general character. I know not that his morality was ever questioned.</P>
<P>HE was a man of dignity. Though he was not haughty and ostentation; yet he maintained his dig∣nity. He was modest and condescending, but far from all meanness. I know not that an unmanly act ever stained his character.</P>
<P>HE was a man of perseverance. Whatever he un∣dertook, he was accustomed to accomplish. Cold,
<PB N="12" REF="037182_0011_100CE3C009117110"/>
hunger, thirst, fatigue, difficulties, or dangers, did not easily break him off from pursuing his plans to effect.</P>
<P>HE was a man <HI>great</HI> in the esteem and affection of his countrymen. As he loved his country, so his country loved him in return. His countrymen were not blind to his merits: They knew—they esteemed —they <HI>felt</HI> his worth. They looked to him as their deliverer—they loved him as their friend. That he shared largely in the esteem and affection of his coun∣try, is proved by the transactions of this day. Look around on this assembly. Is not this numerous as∣sembly a witness that WASHINGTON was beloved. Look further: Look to the towns around us, where the people are this day assembled. Yea, cast your eyes over the whole of these United States. See the citizens from north to south, assembled in various places. For what purpose is this, but to testify their esteem—their affection for their friend, and to mourn for the loss of their WASHINGTON.</P>
<P>THUS I have mentioned some traits of the charac∣ter of him whose loss we mourn, not because they were unknown, but to remind you that he was <HI>great.</HI></P>
<P>BUT as great as he was, he was but a man. He was but a frail, mortal man like others. <HI>Know ye not that a great man is fallen in Israel?</HI> A great man is fallen in America. Yes: the wise, the brave, the beloved WASHINGTON, has fallen a prey to death. He who remained unhurt in the field of battle, where the blood of the slain ran around—he who stood un∣moved at the lightening of the spear and the cannon's roar—he is now no more—no more in this world.
<PB N="13" REF="037182_0012_100CE3C33388BFC0"/>
No more can we receive his aid and hear his councils. <HI>He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.</HI> His vigorous arm has lost its strength: his robust constitution could not stand before the king of terrors. His eyes are for e∣ver closed, his mouth is sealed in solemn silence, and his once active limbs, now remain without life or motion. Before his death, much reliance, under God, was placed upon his wisdom and experience, in case our country should again be involved in war. But our expectations of his assistance, are suddenly vanish∣ed. No more is he to marshall our troops and lead our armies to victory. The mighty conqueror is conquered by the all-conquering power of death.</P>
<P>DESCEND, my countrymen, to the lonely tomb— Open the door, harshly grating on its hinges, look a∣round the solemn apartment, <HI>there</HI> you will find your friend—your benefactor—your father—your WASH∣INGTON. <HI>There</HI> he lies to moulder to his primeval dust.</P>
<P>OH! <HI>How is the mighty fallen,</HI> and the man <HI>of war perished!</HI></P>
<P>BUT is there nothing left of WASHINGTON, but lifeless clay? There is more indeed. He lives in the affectionate remembrance of a grateful people, and his name will be handed down, with applause, to ge∣nerations yet unborn. Many of his writings, which contain his parental advice to his country, are yet preserved. Long may they be preserved and strictly regarded.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="037182_0013_100CD68A05EDD668"/>YEA, more; his soul—his noble part, still lives— This has entered another world to exist forever, and we humbly hope has joined the happy choir above in ascribing rapturous praise to the Power Divine.</P>
<Q><L>—O WASHINGTON!—</L>
<L>"Altho' in solemn silence laid,</L>
<L>"Among the pale and sleeping dead,</L>
<L>"Where neither breeze nor genial ray</L>
<L>"Pervades the cold encircling clay:</L>
<L>"Yet—thy name shall sweetly sound,</L>
<L>"While yonder circling sun goes round,</L>
<L>"Each generous eye its tribute give—</L>
<L>"And tho' thou art dead, thy fame shall live."</L></Q>
<P>How ought we, my hearers, to improve the death of this <HI>great</HI> man, whose loss we mourn. It is im∣portant that we not only show our respect for the de∣ceased by our publick assembly, but that each of us be improved by the providence of God.</P>
<P N="1">1stly. Let the death of WASHINGTON remind us that it is God who gives and takes away blessings. All our favours are derived from him who is the giver of every good and perfect gift. It is true that he whose death we mourn has been a blessing to Ame∣rica; yet we ought to adore the giver and not the gift. The Lord was the giver, the man the gift. Let us look to the giver and acknowlege the good pro∣vidence of God in bestowing upon us the able <HI>General</HI> —the wise <HI>Statesman</HI>—the great <HI>Patriot.</HI> God raised him up as an instrument in his hand to perform what he performed. He raised him up for important purposes to his country and to mankind. These pur∣poses
<PB N="15" REF="037182_0014_100CE3C4D230D088"/>
are answered. Therefore let us bless the Lord that he raised up WASHINGTON for our country's good. Bless the Lord that he protected the man in all dangers of an eventful war—that <HI>he</HI> enabled him to serve his country with wisdom and fidelity. Be thankful that the Governour of the world continued him so long an eminent blessing to America and to man∣kind. Instead of giving too much glory to the <HI>man,</HI> give the glory to God.—From God he received his talents: To God we owe the praise. When he had done the work which God assigned him, and arrived to the bounds which God had set to his life, he was taken away. The Lord had nothing more for him to do, and therefore continued him no longer in the world. As it is God who hath taken him from us, let us seriously consider the hand of God. Infinite <HI>wisdom</HI> directs the wheels of providence. God is actuated by <HI>goodness</HI> in every providence. Therefore it is altoge∣ther for the <HI>best</HI> that WASHINGTON is dead.—As God is most <HI>wise</HI> and <HI>good,</HI> so it is reasonable that men be submissive to <HI>his</HI> will and rejoice that <HI>he</HI> reigns. Had we been to choose concerning our deceased friend, we should have wished his continuance in the world; but for some reason his continuance was not for the best. Let us realize the hand of God in this instance of mortality, and be ready to say, <HI>The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away, and blessed be the name of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2dly. LET the death of WASHINGTON teach us humility. God's providence is just. We are a sinful people. We deserve the heavy judgments of God.— Great are our national privileges, and we have deserved that they should be taken from us.—God would be
<PB N="16" REF="037182_0015_100CE3C75964DAC0"/>
just if he should take from us our wise men and leave us to loose our liberties and privileges. Let us see our ill-desert, acknowledge our wanderings from God, and humble ourselves under the mighty hand of the Lord.—</P>
<P N="3">3dly. LET the death of WASHINGTON remind us that all must die. Death is the appointment of heaven. <HI>It is appointed unto all men once to die.</HI> Job knew that the grave is the house appointed for all the living.</P>
<P>MAN is of a frail and dying nature: He is not calculated to remain long in the present state. The period will soon come when <HI>The keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow them∣selves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windowe be darkened</HI>— the period when <HI>The dust shall return to the earth as it was, and the spirit shall return to God who gave it.</HI></P>
<P>MEN die to make room for others. So it is with all things: They move in succession. The beasts of the field, the fouls of the air and the fish of the sea, leave the world and are followed by others of their kind. So it is in the vegetable world. The old tree falls and is succeeded by new ones. In autumn the forest is despoiled of its foliage; the spring returns, and the forest is again clothed in green.</P>
<P>That all must die, we may know by observation. How many thousands have lived to former days? Tho' once busy on this stage of action, they are now laid in mouldering dust. Where are the mighty
<PB N="17" REF="037182_0016_100CE3C997918220"/>
Generals, the admired Heroes and the Legislators of ancient times? Tho' they were accounted as Gods; yet they have died like men, and lie on a level with others. How many since our day have left the shores of time! How often are we called to attend the funerals of our friends and aquaintance, and to lay them in the narrow house? One falls on our right and another on our left, and are committed to their native dust.</P>
<P>A MAN's riches cannot bribe the king of terrors, nor can his poverty plead in his behalf. The rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day, died and was buried. The beggar who lay at his gate full of sores, fell a prey to death.</P>
<P>A MAN's friends cannot extend the bounds of life. <HI>No man can redeem himself or his brother.</HI> The dying look to their friends, and affecting is the scene, their friends are unable to relieve.</P>
<P>PHYSICIANS are called around the bed of death, but death baffles their skill. They are made use of as instruments to preserve life untill men arrive to the bounds which God hath set, then all their means are in vain.</P>
<P>A MAN's usefulness saves him not. There are many men who by their councils, their exertions and examples are of great service to the world. But even these must be called from their usefulness.</P>
<P><PB REF="037182_0017_100CE3CBAA12D020"/>A MAN may live long compared with the lives of some others: he may have an excellent good consti∣tution, enjoy healthful days, and, more than others, be a stranger to pain and sickness: he may enjoy ma∣ny friends and be loved and caressed by them. He may add house to house and possess fields without number—may become exceedingly rich. He may have great honour and applause. He may rise from a low state to great dignity and honours: like the son of the Blacksmith who in the reign of Henry VIII. stood next to the throne in temporal glory.—</P>
<P>HE may become a great Lawgiver, such as was Moses of Israel, the Assyrian Ninus, the Sesostris of Egypt, the Cyrus of Persia, the Alexander of Greece, the Caesar of Rome, the Conde of France, the Charles of Sweden, the Peter of Russia, and the WASHING∣TON of America. A man may be invested with pomp and surrounded with the guards of royalty: his pomp may dazzle and his power may awe mankind. But after all he must submit to the great traveller, death. <HI>Behold,</HI> says the Psalmist, <HI>thou hast made my days as an hand's breadth, and mine age is as nothing before thee: Verily man at his best state is altogether vanity.</HI></P>
<P>IF a good and robust constitution—if great abili∣ties, inviolable integrity and strict morality—if strong love to one's country and eminent usefulness—if great esteem and applause—if wisdom and prudence in the field and cabinet—if able physicians—if many friends and the sincere affection of one's countrymen —if any one of these or if all of them could save from death, WASHINGTON had been spared: For
<PB N="19" REF="037182_0018_100CE3CE792BB248"/>
these, no doubt, he possessed. Who then can hope to be exempted? None—none indeed.</P>
<P>"SHOULD we, as one expresses, carry our thoughts hence to the sepulchres of the great, or to some hum∣ble burying ground," we might see that death con∣quers all. <HI>"There</HI> lie in promiscuous ruin, the rich and the poor; the base and the brave; the honoura∣ble and the despised. There sleep the infant and the man of days; blooming youth and decayed age.— There rests deformity unmolested: There moulders beauty unnoticed. There find a place proud mo∣narchs who have changed the splendours of a palace for the humble lodging of the grave. There too are found the less noisy but more useful individuals of mankind, the friends, and benefactors of the world. Those sages, who expelled ignorance from wretched mortals, those benefactors, who relieved their wants, there mingle with the vulgar throng. There lies the philosopher, whose mind had traversed nature; there sleeps the man of taste, whose imagination had given birth to new worlds of beauty; there rests the friend to humanity, whose heart never failed to sympathize with the child of sorrow. Even the real Christian whose bosom once glowed with the sacred flame of piety, whose life was a transcript of his saviour's cha∣racter, slumbers in that gloomy repository. At the call of death, the merchant quits his favourite schemes; and the patriot his exertions for the publick good. He whose thoughts are wholly taken up with some lucrative or honourable employment, finds no respite. The friend to human kind, the patriot on whom the welfare of his country depends, obtains no release.— While his bosom swells with the pleasure of diffusing
<PB N="20" REF="037182_0019_100CE3D012869978"/>
happiness among his fellow men; while his mind is big with projects for advancing their felicity, the awful summons arrives, and puts a period to his exertions."</P>
<P>IN these United States, how many, even the last year, have fallen a prey to death! Not only many citizens of the common rank; but more than usual of rulers and superiors have bid us a long farewell. By accounts which have been received, it appears that the following are some of the number:</P>
<P>THEIR EXCELLENCIES,</P>

<P>And General WASHINGTON, to complete the mournful list.</P>
<P>THUS, not only a great man, but numbers of our superior men have fallen, in the course of a year past.</P>

<P>YOU are sensible that WASHINGTON was a ma∣sonic brother. And as he sustained an eminent office in the lodge, so it is evident that masonry received no small share of his attention. Is masonry then "fri∣volous?" Was WASHINGTON a man of dignity e∣very where else, and a child in the lodge? Is mason∣ry calculated to make men thirst for licentious liberty and disorganization? Has not WASHINGTON spent his life in the support of order and good government? Has he not manifested his regard to the Christian re∣ligion and morality? Would he approve and support the masonic institution in case it were inconsistent with good government, order, religion and morality? No—the character of WASHINGTON was uniform and consistent. But you already know the nature of ma∣sonry. It is such as WASHINGTON was not asham∣ed to approve. But no more will he meet with his brethren in this world—no more will he support them—no more will he give them his wise instruc∣tions and his parental advice—no more will he assist in raising the fallen, and no more will his noble soul aid his brethren in alleviating the distresses of the
<PB N="22" REF="037182_0021_100CE3D591C2AD38"/>
unfortunate. For he has bid adieu to the society of mortals.</P>
<P>No doubt you feel the loss: for in his death you have lost a great benefactor, a noble friend, and a worthy brother. Since he is gone, let us remember that it is the Lord's doing and acquiesce in the bereaving providence. Since he has travelled through the jour∣ney of life, to return no more, let it be remembered that we also are travelling to that country from whose bourne no traveller returns. Soon the thread of our life will be severed by the scythe of time. Soon the sands of our glass will be run out, and we must fol∣low the deceased brother to the grave, where all are level.</P>
<P>SUFFER me then to urge you to live as travellers to another world. Entertain supreme affection to the Great I Am: reverence the name of Jehovah: trust in the Lord; and travel by the unerring light of God's holy word. If you do this, you will be safely conducted through the wilderness of this world—your feet will be guided in the path of holiness and peace. If you do this, you will hold the balance of justice in equal poize, walk by the plumb line of uprightness, be restrained within the compass of duty, square your actions by the rules of equity, and bring forth the fruits of Christian benevolence. Cultivate a spirit of friendship and humanity, after the example of that sincere friend and humane brother whose death you mourn. After his example also be lovers of your country, supporters of its constitution, engaged in fa∣vour of order and good government, and never weari∣ed in promoting the publick weal.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="037182_0022_100CE3D721881758"/>LET your lives, as individuals, exemplify the chri∣stian character. Build on the holy scriptures, Jesus Christ being the chief corner stone. <HI>The stone which the builders rejected has become the head stone of the corner.</HI> Recollect that the all-seeing eye of him who built all things, pervades the universe, and that all are accountable to him. Recollect that though the body must return to dust; yet the soul will rise from the lifeless corse to exist forever. May the Lord guide you in the way of piety, so that when you leave the society of mortals, you may be found well qualified through the redeemer, and be admitted, by the almighty Architect, into the happy society of glo∣rified immortals▪</P>
<P>IN the next place, let me address those who are invested with civil authority.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="address">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured Sirs,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>As WASHINGTON was once eminent in the civil department, so you may well feel his loss. No more will our civil affairs be directed by him. But let it be remembered that our civil affairs are in the hands of God, and he is able to assist others to serve their country with fidelity in the civil office. Much of our country's welfare, depends, under God, upon the civil authority. Unless the civil authority be faithful to their trust and vigilant in seeing that the laws are obeyed, our laws will be, in a great measure, in vain— our liberty will be abused and degenerated into sad licentiousness—yea our religion will mourn and vice will triumph. If therefore our laws be worthy of notice—if our rights and liberties be worth preserv∣ing, and if religion be of any importance in regard to
<PB N="24" REF="037182_0023_100CE3D8D4DDC430"/>
our country's welfare or to our eternal peace, much depends on the civil authority. It is through the good providence of God that we have gained our li∣berties: this has been done, however, with arduous struggles and at the expence of the blood of many a brave American. We have now order, peace and good laws established—yea, we enjoy our religion un∣molested—we may set under our own vines and fig-trees without any to make us afraid. Is it not im∣portant then for us to hold our liberty precious, to obey our laws and revere our religion? Without re∣ligion there can be no <HI>good</HI> civil government—with∣out the <HI>form</HI> of religion <HI>none</HI> will long remain.</P>
<P>To you, my fathers, we look as guardians of our rights, defenders of our laws, and supporters of our re∣ligion. Though I pretend not to much knowledge in civil affairs, and though I would not presume to di∣rect you in your office; yet, permit me humbly to suggest the importance that our laws be duly observ∣ed respecting morality and the Christian sabbath. I need not enlarge on the importance of morality and the sabbath: you feel their importance. They are important if we look to the good of our government, the good of our nation, the good of ourselves, or the good of our children. And who shall watch over us and punish the immoral pest of society and the dis∣turbing sabbath breaker, if not our civil magistrates? The civil magistrate acts for God and is accountable to him. <HI>The powers that are, are ordained of God.</HI> Good <HI>Rulers are not a terror to good works but to evil.</HI> How important is it then that the civil ma∣gistrate be firm and stedfast in the discharge of his trust. WASHINGTON was unshaken, when execut∣ing
<PB N="25" REF="037182_0024_100CE3DB4403F828"/>
the laws of his country. Long may we have ma∣gistrates wise and firm like WASHINGTON. Long may we have them, who shall be a terror to evil do∣ers, and a praise to them who do well. Long may we have them, who shall hold sacred our rights and liberties—our laws and our religion. Long may we have them in office, who love our country like WASHINGTON, who are fearers of God, and faithful in the discharge of their duty.</P>
<P>MY fathers, may the Lord be with you, and sanctify to you the death of him whose loss you mourn; may God grant you wisdom and assistance in your impor∣tant station, and long continue you rich blessings to your fellow-citizens and promoters of your country's welfare.</P>
<P>AN address will next be made to those who sustain military offices.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="address">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Respected Gentlemen—</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>No man in America nor perhaps in the world has been as famous as WASHINGTON for his military talents. During the greatest part of our revolutionary war, he held the first military office, and executed it in such a masterly manner as to gain the applause of his country, and the wonder of the world. Such was his wisdom as to baffle the skill and the art of the enemy who were commanded by the wisest and most experienced generals, of whom England had to boast. Such was his bravery in the field, as caused proud Britons to flee before him. Such was his authority, that his inferior officers and soldiers obeyed him with promptitude, and such was his mildness and condescention that they loved and revered him. So irreproachable was his character as a general, that I
<PB N="26" REF="037182_0025_100CD685E87C8468"/>
know not that even his most inveterate enemies dared to utter a syllable derogatory to his military character. He silenced the voice of envy and struck dumb the tongue of calumny. How did you rejoice—how did his soldiers rejoice—how did all America rejoice, when the brave Veteran accepted his last appointment to take the charge of our new raised troops. But Oh! sad reverse! He has resigned his commission. No more do you look to him as your leader. He has pass∣ed the vale, whence there is no returning. In him you have lost your military chief—your wonderful hero.—In his death the soldiers have lost their military father, their friend and general. Should America, perchance, be again involved in war, and should any of you be called to the field of battle, would you not wish to see your WASHINGTON at your head? But you will see him not. No more will the enemy fear him —no more will you follow him to face the enemy. <HI>More</HI> then is to be done by his successors. Let me exhort you to follow the example of WASHINGTON in your military office. If ever you should be called to defend your country, think how <HI>he</HI> would have con∣ducted and do likewise. If you have wisdom like him your arrangements will be good and probably succeed. If you have dignity and authority like him, your sol∣diers will respect and obey you. If you have humani∣ty and lenity like him, they will love you as their friend. If you have prudence like him the enemy will scarcely gain an advantage. If you have bravery like him, you may expect a glorious victory.—But may God avert the calamity of war from our country: may he forbid that you should ever have occasion to enter the field of battle. May you never have occasion to go thro' the dangers, thro' which WASHINGTON has
<PB N="27" REF="037182_0026_100CE3DF391309C8"/>
gone.—should, however, the din of war be heard in our land, and should the good of your country call you to battle, shrink not from the undertaking. Rally round your country's standard, haste away to meet the enemy and bravely defend your rights and liberties, your lives and property, your wives and children. Let the love of liberty, the love of your country, the love of your families, fire your souls to action. Remember WASHINGTON: What he did was honourable.</P>
<P>LOOK to the God of war, make your peace with him, engage him on your side, and you will have no∣thing to fear. <HI>If God be for us, who can be against us?</HI> May the Lord give you his blessing: may he continue peace in our land and prosperity in our dwellings, so that you may long taste the sweets of retired life, and thro' life enjoy domestic happiness; may God enable you to fight the good fight of faith, war the Christian warfare with success, and when time is no more bestow upon you a crown of joy as the re∣ward of spiritual victory.</P>
<P>ALL that remains, is to address the citizens in general, of this numerous assembly.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="address">
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY Fellow-Citizens and Countrymen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WASHINGTON was once a private citizen. Yea, he rejoiced in being a citizen of the free and indepen∣dent states of America. Whenever his country would give consent, he retired to the life of a private citizen. In this character he did honour to his country.—As a citizen he was obedient to the laws of our land and a supporter of the government under which we live. In private life, he was attentive to husbandry and do∣mestic
<PB N="28" REF="037182_0027_100CE3E166426348"/>
concerns: He was tender and affectionate to his family, kind and obliging to his friends and forgiv∣ing to his enemies.</P>
<P>BUT America no more calls him her citizen. He has become the citizen of another country. As his death is our loss as citizens, so we may with propriety notice the mournful event. It is important that we also be suitably improved by it.</P>
<P>LET us candidly attend to WASHINGTON's in∣structions and regard his councils, for he was our friend. Let us pray the Father of mercies, that his successors in office may be enabled to serve their coun∣try with that wisdom and fidelity as <HI>he</HI> hath done. Our publick affairs are in the hands of God, and it is important that we supplicate his favour to our national concerns. And let us pay a strict regard to the laws of the land in which we live. <HI>Let every soul be subject to the higher powers: for there is no power but of God: the powers that be, are ordained of God.</HI></P>
<P>BY this instance of mortality, which has called us together, let us be reminded of the vanity of all things below the sun.—Nothing on earth is permanent: One generation goeth, and another cometh. Be reminded of the insufficiency of all things here below, to make us truly happy. Since this world is vanity, <HI>Set your affections on things above, not on things on the earth.</HI> Of what value now is this world to WASHINGTON. None indeed. "How lov'd, how valued once, avails him not." Let us then lay up treasure in heaven, where is genuine happiness and durable joy.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="037182_0028_100CE3E46A8C8460"/>SINCE WASHINGTON is dead, let us reflect on our own mortality. Death knocks equally at the doors of palaces and cottages. Others die around us: Soon it will be our turn. Yes, each of us in this assembly must soon lie in solemn silence beneath the dust.—</P>
<Q><L>In respect to us,</L>
<L>"Soon some aquaintance, mournfully will say,</L>
<L>"Here sleeps my friend, once active, young &amp; gay,</L>
<L>"Now cold in death; beneath the dust he lies,</L>
<L>"Silent his voice, forever clos'd his eyes;</L>
<L>"The immortal part, has on swift pinions flown,</L>
<L>"To take its sentence, in the world unknown."</L></Q>
<P>Our time is short. Day after day and year after year, roll almost imperceptibly away, and carry us onward to the close of life. If we live even to old age, we shall find the time to be short. While time is passing it is apt to seem long: hours often hang heavily upon us, and we drag the tedious load of life. But time when past appears short indeed. When an old man looks back on his past life, it appears like a dream, or in the expressive language of inspiration, <HI>Like the morning cloud and the early dew which soon passeth away.</HI>—What are sixty or eighty years, when compared with the lives of the Patriarchs, who lived eight or nine hundred years?—What are they, when compared with the time elapsed since the days of Adam, which is about six thousand years? Or what are these sixty or eighty years, when compared with eternity! Eternity, vast boundless eternity, will never end. Oh! let us realize the shortness of our time!</P>
<P>IF the lives of the old be short, how much shorter still are the lives of many others! It is computed by some, that one third of the human race die under the
<PB N="30" REF="037182_0029_100CE3E669168630"/>
age of one year, and nearly one half under the age of five years. Many are cut off in the vigour of life and in the bloom of youth.—How few—how very few live till old age! The frailty of human nature is proved by daily experience.</P>
<P>IT appears that WASHINGTON, a few days before his death, was robust and healthy; but how soon is he laid pale and lifeless! Oh! how precarious are all things here below! Why—why will we not realize the uncertainty of our lives?</P>
<P>Is our time short, and are our lives uncertain? then let us not mispend our time. Why should we trifle it away? Why should we not think of our danger before death stares us in the face? Why will we sail quietly down the rapid stream of life till we be unex∣pectedly launched forth into the boundless ocean of eternity?</P>
<P>Is WASHINGTON no more? then let us be ex∣cited to prepare to die. Preparation for death is the great end of life. Death is the object which we should keep in our view.—God's warnings to us are many and various. His word and providence are solemn warnings. By the frequent deaths of our neigh∣bours, friends and aquaintance—by the deaths of our rulers—yea, by the sudden death of our WASHING∣TON, God speaks in expressive language, <HI>Be ye also ready.</HI> O my countrymen, let us watch and pray for we know not what hour our Lord doth come. <HI>One thing is needful.</HI> Religion is, of all things else, most necessary.
<PB N="31" REF="037182_0030_100CE3E7FACBD588"/>
Let us chuse this good part which shall never be taken from us.</P>
<P>AFTER death comes the judgment. Yes; the day is coming, when the sound of the last trump, shall vibrate through the universe—the day, when the dead shall be raised and the living be changed—the day, when we shall behold the great funeral of nature, the earth dissolving and the elements melting with fer∣vent heat—the great day, when we shall arise to the bar of God. Then may we be found among the friends of Jesus, receive the approbation of our Judge, and through the Redeemer, be welcomed to blisful seats of never—never ending joy.</P>
