<HEAD>A TESTIMONY CONCERNING MY DEAR FRIEND AND COUSIN MARY MOLLINEUX, DECEASED, In a living Remembrance of the Benefit which I re∣ceived by her Labour of Love; and now recommend to the Youth of our Age, to excite them to Faithful∣ness, and a circumspect Conversation.</HEAD>
<P>THE worthy Author of these Writings, was one whose near Relation to me began our Acquaintance almost with our Lives; she was the only Child of her Mother, as I of my Father, and they one Brother and Sister. This gave us Op∣portunity of frequent Converse with each other; and having no Sisters of our own, and our natural Inclinations and Tempers being suitable, caused us more to respect each other: Tho' she was of more Years, and different Principles, in Matters of Religion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Being one called Quaker.</NOTE>, at that Time, yet the Sympathy and Kindness that was betwixt us, out-balanced the seeming Disparity; and we could argue without Wrangling, and dissent without Discord; and such
<PB REF="043092_0003_101CC8DCC80884C0"/>
was her prudent winning Carriage towards me, that even in my green and childish Years, she often pre∣vail'd with me to quit many trifling Things, in which I then delighted, for more profitable Employments; which she was not wanting to recommend to me, nor to tell me of my Faults; but with so much Af∣fection and good Counsel, that like a mollifying, healing Balsam, it cured almost insensibly. And so far was I from accounting her my Enemy, for telling me the Truth, that considering her Wis∣dom and Virtue, together with her plain Dealing, which I took as no small Argument of her Kind∣ness; knowing, Reproof and good Advice to be so thankless an Office, that nothing but Love and Duty can prevail with a discreet Person to act that Part: I say, upon these Inducements I made Choice of her as my particular Bosom Friend. Nor was I mistaken or disappointed, for such she approved herself; making Choice of me also as hers, soon after my Convincement. Thus was our Love reci∣procal: And this was the Beginning of our Friend∣ship, so often mentioned in her Verses; which the rather induceth me to hint it here, as an Encou∣ragement to all who profess the pure unerring Truth, to keep faithful in their Place and Testimo∣ny, that so the Lord may make Use of them to in∣vite and win their Familiars and Relations to love and embrace the precious Truth, as she was made an happy Instrument of Good to me, by her many kind Admonitions, and seasonable Cautions, verbal and literal, both in Verse and Prose: But chiefly, that prevailing Argument of good Example, and circumspect Conversation, which the Lord, in his infinite Mercy, was pleased so to bless, that they became Motives to me, to consider how much I was short of her; and to examine her Principles, as well as my own: Then did the Lord open my Eyes, and by his Light and Spirit in my Heart, gave me
<PB REF="043092_0004_101CC8DE66505598"/>
a Sight of my inward State and Condition; which I found to be unsafe, notwithstanding the Advan∣tages of a sober Education; and that, if my Righ∣teousness exceeded not that of the Scribes and Pha∣risees, in vain was it to expect an Admittance into the heavenly Kingdom. So that after much Sor∣row and many Conflicts, the Lord brought me to this Resolution in my own Mind, That if he would be pleased to discover his Way, which leads to Life and Salvation, and how I should attain Power to walk in it, so that I might enjoy his Peace, which I so much wanted, with his Assistance I would be∣come his Disciple, and follow him whithersoever he should lead: Then did the Lord, in his great Love, and never to be forgotten Condescension, shew me, that it was a straight Way, despised by many wise and prudent of the World; and walked in by a poor, self-denying, under-valued People, which it would be hard for me to be numbered with: And so I found it, being almost ready to despair, until the Lord inclined my Heart to take her Counsel, and go to some Meetings of the People called <HI>Quak∣ers;</HI> where I heard the Way of God so plainly dis∣covered, and his blessed Truth so livingly preached, that I was convinced thereof, and well satisfied that the glorious Presence of the Lord, and his Heart-mollifying Power, was with this People; which unusually tender'd my Spirit, and distinguished their Meetings from those I had formerly frequented. This made me delight to meet with them, though much wonder'd at, scoff'd and reproach'd for it; yet by her encouraged: But, praised be the great Almighty God, he brought me in his own appoint∣ed Time, to witness the Fulfilling of his ancient Prophecy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalm cx. 3.</NOTE> making me <HI>willing in the Day of his Power;</HI> willing to become a Fool and Gazing-stock to my former Acquaint∣ance; willing to be rid of the Load of Sin I had
<PB REF="043092_0005_101CC8E1226EC220"/>
laboured under: And considering that no Burden could be heavier, was also made to accept the ten∣der Invitation of our blessed Lord and Saviour, who said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat xi. 8. 29, 30.</NOTE> <HI>Come unto me, all you who la∣bour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you Rest; take my Yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in Heart, and ye shall find Rest to your Souls; for my Yoke is easy, and my Burden is light:</HI> And blessed be the eternal Goodness, I have witnessed it to be so, in comparison of the Bondage of Corrup∣tion. And I here insert my Exercise, for the En∣couragement of the Sincere-hearted, that all may depend upon the Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. xi 6.</NOTE> who is a good <HI>Rewarder of them who diligently seek him;</HI> and can give Testimony, ac∣cording to their Measure, that his <HI>Ways are Ways of Pleasantness,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. iii. 17.</NOTE> <HI>and all his Paths are Peace:</HI> Therefore let those, whose Feet are thither turned, hold on their Way, and persevere in Righ∣teousness and Purity; that so they may grow strong∣er and stronger, and be able to lend a helping-hand to them who are weak; as this my dear Friend hath often done, both to me and others. And let all, who are yet seeking the Lord and his Truth, be encouraged in his Faithfulness and Obedience to follow God's Requirings in their own Hearts;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. i. 19.</NOTE> <HI>for that which may be known of God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. v. 13.</NOTE> is there manifest; <HI>and what∣soever doth make manifest, is Light,</HI> (viz.) the Light of Jesus, <HI>which enlighteneth every Man that comes into the World:</HI> This is that which truly discovers God to Man, and Man to himself; yea, the whole Mystery of Godliness. Therefore let none tire in their Search after Truth, nor be <HI>weary in well-doing,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gal. vi. 9.</NOTE> <HI>for they shall reap in due Season,</HI> the Benefit thereof, <HI>if
<PB REF="043092_0006_101CC8E3D309E6C0"/>
they faint not, but hold out to the End;</HI> as did the Author of the ensuing Verses; of whom I am wil∣ling to give the Reader some Account.</P>
<P>She was one who, in her Childhood, was much afflicted with weak Eyes, which made her unfit for the usual Employment of Girls; and being of a large natural Capacity, quick, witty, and studious∣ly inclined, her Father brought her up to more Learning, than is commonly bestowed on our Sex; in which she became so good a Proficient, that she well understood the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue, fluently dis∣coursed in it; and made a considerable Progress in <HI>Greek</HI> also; wrote several Hands well; was a good Arithmetician, yea, in the best Arithmetick; <HI>for she so numbered her Days, as to apply her Heart unto Wisdom;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Psalm xc. 12.</NOTE> as also to the Study of several useful Arts; had a good Under∣standing of Physick and Surgery, the nature of Plants, Herbs, and Minerals; and made some In∣spection into divers profitable Sciences; delighting in the Study of Nature, and to admire the great God of Nature, in the various Operations of his Power and Goodness; the wonderful Harmony and Order of the Creation, and the infinite Wisdom by which it is govern'd; of which she would often speak: Admiring how there could be an <HI>Atheist</HI> in the World, since the Creation doth so plainly assert the Being of a Deity. And as we have been walk∣ing or riding together, would often discourse of the present Objects, much tending to Edification; making many pretty Remarks, and comparing out∣ward Things with inward: As also, upon all Oc∣casions, would draw such useful Observations, as made her Company profitable and delighting: For she was of a thoughtful, composed Temper; yet of a quick Apprehension, and ingenious; which, be∣ing season'd with Truth, in which she had many sweet Openings, these meeting in a Temper con∣versable,
<PB REF="043092_0007_101CC8E55C282140"/>
and concerned for the Good of others, made her Conversation improving and desirable. She was one who loved the blessed Truth, and they who walked according to it, from a Child, being early convinced thereof; tho' she was not satisfied with a bare Profession of Religion, but zealous for the Life of it, both in herself and others; also fur∣nished with good Arguments to defend it, being ready to give an Answer to every one that asked a <HI>Reason of the Hope which was in her,</HI> with Meekness and Fear: Nor forward to begin a Dispute, yet sound in what she undertook, and never, that I know of, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oil'd in an Argument; for she had an Eye to the Lord, and liked to be satisfied that she was in her Place, and called by him to what she did for him: Would often mention the Passage of <HI>Uzzah,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> vi. 6, 7. how Death was his Pu∣nishment, for putting forth his Hand to take hold of the Ark of God, when the Oxen shook it; it being a Service not required of him.</P>
<P>Nor was she proud, or conceited of her Parts and Learning, but adorned with an humble Modesty; having, I believe, meaner Thoughts of herself, than any one else had of her, who knew her Qualifi∣cations.</P>
<P>Plain and decent in her Cloaths, which she va∣lued for Service more than Sight; and slighted, in comparison of those better Ornaments of the Mind, which she prefer'd above splendid or costly Apparel.</P>
<P>She was one that loved to read the Holy Scrip∣tures, and such useful Authors as had a Tendency to Improvement; in which she spent much Time: God having furnished her with an extraordinary Memory to retain the same.</P>
<P>She delighted much in Solitude, and was often alone; setting apart some Time of the Day for Re∣tirement; and would frequently say to me, in the Evenings, Let us go aside, and wait upon the
<PB REF="043092_0008_101CC8E724C24740"/>
Lord; we have daily Need of daily Bread, and to renew our Strength; and how can we expect it, if we do not wait for it? And would recite the Pas∣sage of <HI>Elijah, 1 Kings</HI> xviii. 36. that at the Time of the Evening Sacrifice, the Lord answered by Fire; with other pretty Remarks, too tedious to insert, which she abounded in, upon all Occasions, to promote that which was good: In these Times of Retirement, Verses would often come up in her Mind, which she afterwards wrote: Many of these, herewith printed, being Meditations according to the Frame and Exercise of her Spirit, when thus composed.</P>
<P>Neither did she neglect publick Opportunities to worship God; for she was diligent in frequenting religious Meetings, not being apt to omit any, unless upon an extraordinary Occasion. Nor did she suffer her Eyes to wander, which the Mind too often accompanies; but the Composedness of her Countenance, shewed the Sedateness of her well exercised Mind: And the good Improvement she made of publick and private Devotion, her in∣nocent and <HI>Christian</HI> Life did clearly discover; which she well began in her early Years, and ma∣nifested her Progress therein, by her Constancy and Perseverance to the End, which crowns all; <HI>for 'tis he that endures to the End, that shall be saved:</HI> This she had a Regard to, more than the fading Enjoy∣ments of this uncertain World; and, I believe, she was in a good Condition when she left it, and laid down her Head in Peace with the Lord, leav∣ing a good Savour behind her.</P>
<P>She was one who willingly and chearfully suffer∣ed for the Truth, encouraging others to do the like, both by Precept and Example: One just, honest, and true to her Word, temperate and self-denying; keeping within the Limits prescribed for Health, which she regarded, more than to gratify a
<PB REF="043092_0009_101CC8EC91047DB8"/>
luxurious Appetite: Solid and grave in her Car∣riage, mixt with an innocent Chearfulness; not formally austere; yet rather reserv'd, than over-free; bashful, than bold.</P>
<P>To conclude, she was one whose Modesty, Charity, Friendship, and religious Conversation, came not short of her excellent Writings; to which I refer the Reader, for a fuller Character of their Author than I am capable of giving: Her own Pen having discovered the rich Treasure of her pious Mind. But what I have written, is from an ex∣perimental Knowledge of her; and no one, I be∣lieve, knew her better than myself: For she was as much without Reserve to me, I think, as one Friend could be to another; for we loved entirely, communicated our Minds and Exercises to each other freely, advising with one another on most Occasions: And great was our Nearness and Unity of Spirit, in the Truth; yea, great was her Con∣cern of my Welfare, which she zealously laboured for; as the many Letters, both in Verse and Prose, to me writ, and herewith printed, largely demon∣strate.</P>
<P>And tho' Verse is not so commonly used in divine Subjects as Prose, and but too much abused by the extravagant Wits of the Age; yet she, like a skil∣ful Chymist, had learned to separate the purer Spirits, and more refined Parts of Poetry, from the earthly, worthless Dross; and made Use of her Gift, rather to convince and prevail upon the Mind, to affect and raise the Soul upon the Wings of di∣vine Contemplation, than to please the airy Fancy with Strains of Wit, and unprofitable Invention; which she was ever careful to avoid.</P>
<P>And tho' living Testimonies to the Truth are numerous, yet few extant in Verse, which hath an harmonious delightful Faculty in it, that influences the Minds of some more than Prose, especially
<PB REF="043092_0010_101CC8EF34A416E8"/>
young People, and is more apt to imprint itself in the Memory: Therefore her Subject being divine, and so sensibly and solidly managed; as it hath been of Service to those few who have had the Perusal of it, so, I hope, will be attended with a general Be∣nefit.</P>
<P>And having reaped no small Advantage thereby myself, could do no less, than recommend her wor∣thy Labours, and exemplary Life, to others, as a Pattern well worth following. For her Acquaint∣ance may say of her, as was said of <HI>Ruth, The City of my People doth know that she was a virtuous Woman.</HI> And being a good Instrument in the Hand of the Lord to me, having also been much comforted, en∣couraged, and refreshed by her Verses, my Desire is, that the Lord may so bless them to Posterity, that they may reap such an Advantage by them, as may tend to the Promotion of Truth, and the Good of Souls in general.</P>

<HEAD>A TESTIMONY CONCERNING MY DEAR FRIEND MARY MOLLINEUX.</HEAD>
<P>AS concerning my dearly beloved Friend, <HI>Many Mollineux,</HI> I have more to testify than I shall commit to Writing, having had intimate Ac∣quaintance and Fellowship with her above sixteen Years; in all which Time, her grave, virtuous, modest Life and Conversation, deserveth singular Remembrance; because her friendly Communica∣tion, Conference, and Deportment, was always solid, sensible, and tender, mixt with a feeling and sympathizing Love to her Friends, in all Exercises and Afflictions: She was one, to whom I could freely impart my Mind and Concerns, in any Ex∣ercises; as I have often done, to my Comfort and Refreshment. My Heart is moved, in the Remem∣brance of her Faithfulness and Integrity, from the Day that I was first acquainted with her, with Sor∣row for the Loss of so near a Friend; who, although she was plentifully endued with many worthy Gifts and Parts, both natural and spiritual, yet I never knew her lifted up in any of them, nor exalted a∣bove her Measure; but rather reserved, than in any wise forwardly divulging her Gifts to the pub∣lick Censure, without weighty Consideration; so that she would not cast her Pearls before Swine: Yet not so much reserved, but that to her near in∣timate
<PB REF="043092_0012_101CC8F4C6457418"/>
Friends, whom she knew in the Fellowship and Bond of Truth, she was very free and tender. I remember, that several Years ago, when she was a single Woman, upon the Perusal of some Copies of her Verses which she gave me, I felt such Unity of Spirit with them, that I said, I thought they might be of Service, if made publick in print; but she was not then free that her Name should be ex∣posed; she not seeking Praise amongst Men, but to communicate the Exercise of peculiar Gifts amongst her near Friends and Acquaintance; but now, since it hath pleased the Lord to remove her out of the earthly Tabernacle, into everlasting Rest, in which I am well satisfied she is forever blessed, I think it would be very ungrateful to her Memory, and also a wronging of others, to keep such worthy Things unpublished; with which, I believe, the most that are of open Understandings, and unprejudiced Hearts, will have, in some measure, Unity. I de∣sire and hope, they may truly tend to the Benefit of all moderate Readers, and to the Praise of Him, who is the only Author of every good and perfect Gift.</P>

<HEAD>A TESTIMONY CONCERNING MY LATE WIFE MARY MOLLINEUX, DECEASED.</HEAD>
<P>CONCERNING my dear, loving, and late deceased Wife, <HI>Mary Mollineux,</HI> formerly <HI>Mary Southworth,</HI> whom I took in Marriage on the 10th Day of the Second Month, 1685. I was first acquainted with her at <HI>Lancaster-Castle,</HI> where we both at one Time were Prisoners, for being at a peaceable religious Meeting of the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> in the Year 1684, tho' we had seen each other before. In which Imprisonment, I believed that she should be my Wife; but never intended to express any Thing thereof, whilst we were both Prisoners there; and after she was released, I saw her, and was in Company with her several Times, before I expressed any Thing of my Concern to take her to be my Wife; several considerable Men having before attempted to prevail with her on that Account: And during the whole Time of my Ac∣quaintance with her, which was above eleven Years, her Life and Conversation was serious, in∣nocent, sweet and savoury; and she was very lov∣ing, diligent, tender-hearted, and kindly affection∣ate towards me, and our Children; and generally
<PB REF="043092_0014_101CC8FA44C340E8"/>
loving and tender towards all People, especially such as were in any Distress, Sickness, or Affliction, tho' never so poor; and the Lord blessed her En∣deavours, as well in Advice, as Administration of Remedies, to several; so that they have acknow∣ledged their Recoveries to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thereby, thro' his Blessing: And what she did therein, was free. She was very careful, that nothing of Evil might get a Place in her Children, or in any with whom she was concerned: And therefore good Advice and Admonition she frequently gave, which many re∣ceived in Love and good Esteem of her. The Lord opened her Understanding, and enlarged her Capacity, in a great Degree, upon several Accounts; yet her Mind was not lifted up thereby, so as to glory in her Gifts or Parts; but learning of Christ, the Truth, to be <HI>lowly in Heart,</HI> she chose rather to appear little to Men. She was very constant and cordial to her Friends, and true in concealing of Secrets. She was often concerned to make Peace amongst them that were at Difference, and often prevailed therein. She was plain and free in speak∣ing to the Faces of any, but abhorred to reproach any in secret. Her Heart was inclined towards God, therefore she was just in her Dealing, with all people with whom she had to do. She was con∣vinced of the Way of Truth in her Youth, by the Light or inward Appearance of Christ in her Heart, which she loved; and therefore, she retaining her Integrity to the End of her Time, a Crown of end∣less Life and Glory, I believe, the Lord hath be∣stowed upon her. She was very noble in suffering Persecution for the Testimony of Truth, and en∣during hard Exercises, occasioned by my several Imprisonments for the same Cause, whilst she was my Wife. And through several Sicknesses and Afflictions the Lord supported her, to persevere in Patience, Faithfulness and Constancy to him. She
<PB REF="043092_0015_101CC8FBE0A909C8"/>
was very punctual in Performance of her Under∣takings, and quick, discreet, and diligent in her Business; yet still she used to take a Time for pri∣vate Retirement in Evenings alone, except I was with her, to wait upon, and feel after the Lord, in the Gift of his Light; Love and Grace in her Heart; and to see that, with the wise Virgins, she had Oil in her burning Lamp, that it might not go out; but that she might be ready to enter into the Marriage Chamber, whensoever the Lord, the Bridegroom of her Soul, came. She was also very diligent, in attending the Assemblies of the People of God called <HI>Quakers,</HI> with them to meet in the Name, Power, Light and Spirit of the Lord, to wait upon him, to be opened by him, and to re∣ceive Refreshment, Strength and Comfort from him, and to feel the Renewings of his Love and Goodness in her Soul. And that Day Week next before her last Illness seized her, after a more than usual manner, she said to me, <HI>That the feeling and enjoying of the sweet eternal Love of God in her Heart, was more precious to her, than all other Things that could be enjoyed, &amp;c.</HI> She was concerned in her Spirit, that many, with her, and all that are faith∣ful to God, might come to <HI>taste and see how good the Lord is;</HI> and upon that Account, her Words, Writings and Conversation, were acceptable, pre∣valent, and serviceable to the Invitation, Convince∣ment, Strengthning and Encouragement of some to seek after the Lord, and his blessed Way and Truth, inwardly revealed, and to be revealed; wherein many have found great Satisfaction and Cause of Rejoicing. And that many more may re∣ceive Benefit by her Writings, I am desirous and concerned to publish them, and refer all sober Rea∣ders, in the Fear of God, to peruse them; not doubting but such may receive Advantage thereby; tho' she was not free to commit them to publick
<PB REF="043092_0016_101CC8FFE33C9D58"/>
View in her Life-time, yet she had nothing against the publishing thereof afterwards.</P>
<P>And now I shall give a brief Account of what I was and am a Witness of, concerning her last Illness; and some of the sweet, sensible and precious Words which she spake in the Time thereof, being very sensible to the End; so that she spake no imperti∣nent or unsensible Word therein, that I know of, who constantly attended her.</P>
<P>Upon the 8th Day of the Tenth Month, 1695, she was seized with violent Pain and Sickness, which continued, sometimes more, and sometimes less: And one Morning, soon after, she said to me thus; <HI>I have had such a Dream, as I have seldom had; it is an Emblem of my Life.</HI> And then she told it me thus; <HI>viz. She dreamed, that she was going at the Side of a pleasant broad River, and sometimes she came to Breaches; which Brooks, running into the River, or the like, had made upon the Shore of it; which Breaches she passed over, but sometimes with Difficulty, and then ran fast on still, till she came to another Breach, and having passed several Breaches, some greater, and some lesser, at last, she came to a Breach which was greater than any of the rest, and she said within herself, how shall I get over this Breach? But yet she went on, and passed through it, and it was fair on the other Side; and she awaked.</HI> Now, as she looked upon this Dream to be an Em∣blem of her Life, so I cannot, nor could not, since she told it me, expound it otherwise than thus, <HI>viz.</HI> That the pleasant broad River, signified the Lord her Creator, who is to his People <HI>a Place of broad Rivers,</HI> Isa. xxxiii. 21. and the Shore thereof, upon which she walked, signified Time; and the Brea∣ches, which she passed over, were the Difficulties and Afflictions which she passed through in her Time, and the last and greatest Breach which she came to, and passed over, signified her last Sick∣ness
<PB REF="043092_0017_101CC90289A39338"/>
and Death. From which Dream, as a signi∣ficant Parable, all may learn and consider, how fast they are hastning, or running, towards their last and greatest Breach; even the Death, or Dissoluti∣on of their earthly Tabernacles; and none know∣eth how near they are to it. About nine Days af∣ter her said Illness began, she said to me thus, <HI>viz. I am well content, if the Lord see meet, that he take me away by this Distemper, rather than to be in this Pain; for my Pain is great, and I know not what in this World I can desire to stay to enjoy, except it be my Love, and my little Lads;</HI> meaning me, and our two Children: Of whom she then said thus: <HI>I would rather have my Children enriched with the Fear of the Lord, than with all manner of worldly Riches.</HI> About the same Time she said, <HI>I am thinking of ho∣nest</HI> Richard Johnson, who was a near Friend to us, <HI>that slept much of the Time of his Illness before his Departure; methinks it seemeth like an easy Passage.</HI> And soon after that, she began to be inclin'd to Sleepiness, and slept more and more till the End; yet, at her awaking, was still sensible and chear∣ful: And tho' she was daily weaker and weaker, yet she would still sit up five or six, or more, Hours in the Evenings, and discourse freely and chearful∣ly, till within five Days of her Departure. I often desired her to accept of the Advice of some Physi∣cian, but she was still averse thereto in this Illness, tho' in other<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> she had complied. On the 20th Day of her Illness; in the Evening, discoursing very freely, as formerly, she told me, <HI>She was well satis∣fied, that if the Lord took her away by that Distemper, she should be eternally happy;</HI> with many other sensi∣ble and comfortable Expressions: Tho' she was so weak, that the same Evening, about the eleventh Hour, I thought she had been departing; but in a little Time, recovering her Breath, she spoke chearfully, and slept, At her awaking, that Night,
<PB REF="043092_0018_101CC9052C438B00"/>
I asked her, How she was? She answered, <HI>Through Mercy, indifferent.</HI> And after a little Pause, she very sensibly said, <HI>Amictum iri, vel Ami<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iendum esse;</HI> which is in <HI>English, To be cloathed hereafter,</HI> in two Expressions of it: Whereby I understood, that she was minding how the Lord would cloath her here∣after, when her mortal Cloathing was put off. Then I desired her, in <HI>English</HI> Words, for they that were present, understood not <HI>Latin,</HI> that if she had any Thing in her Mind, either concerning her Children, or any other Thing, farther to com∣municate to me, that she would do it; but she, as if all outward Things were then out of her Thoughts, quickly replied in <HI>Latin,</HI> saying, <HI>Why speakest thou such Things? Dost not thou understand me?</HI> I answered in <HI>Latin,</HI> Yes, I very well under∣stand thee, and that thou speakest of spiritual Things: She answered, <HI>Yes, but she had nothing, concerning outward Things, farther to communicate to me.</HI> The next Morning, about the ninth Hour, I again thought she had been departing; but after a little Time, somewhat recovering her Breath, and seeing me express, to Friends that were present, something of my Concern for her, she said to me, <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nimis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> es<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s;</HI> that is in <HI>English, Be not thou over-much careful, or troubled;</HI> which Advice took Impression in my Heart: And that was the last <HI>Latin</HI> Sentence that she spake, that I know of; and she never spake in <HI>Latin,</HI> in this Illness, that I remember, except when Company was present, that she would speak only to me: A little after, most of the Company being gone out, I asked her, How she was? She answered, <HI>Drawing nearer and near∣er.</HI> And many sweet and loving Sentences she spake to me that Day, and the Day next after; but afterwards was scarcely able to answer to any Question, but continued mostly sleeping as it were, sweetly and quietly: And on the 3d Day of the

eleventh Month 1695, in the Evening, she depart∣ed without the least Sigh or Groan.</P>
<P>And so, though the Lord, who, in his Love, joined us together, and gave us for Blessings to each other, and blessed us with the abundant In∣crease of his Love in our Hearts, even to the End of her Time, hath seen meet to take from me her Company, which I valued above all other temporal Enjoyments; the Loss whereof is great to me: Yet being satisfied that she is entered into Rest, in the Bosom of God's Love, with him to live in Peace and Happiness for ever; and also, being clear, in that, through his Assistance, according to the Understanding given me, I have endeavoured fully to discharge my Duty of endeared Love to her, in every Respect, in her last, as well as for∣mer, Exercises; therefore I am, in the Love of God▪ comforted, and can chearfully and freely say, The Lord's Will is worthy to be done in all Things, and his Name to be blessed, praised and magnified, over all, for ever,</P>

<HEAD>A few Words more, in Remembrance of my dear Wife, M. Mollineux.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L><HI>THO' it may seem to some that read my Lines</HI></L>
<L><HI>As a delightful Thing, because their Minds</HI></L>
<L><HI>Still their Enjoyments have; yet they must know</HI></L>
<L><HI>No lasting Joys remain in Things below.</HI></L>
<L><HI>The Sythe of Time, Death, parteth Friend from Friend,</HI></L>
<L><HI>But to true Friendship cannot put an End;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Though Friends surviving Exercise may find,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Whose Friends remov'd, whilst they remain behind.</HI></L>
<L><PB REF="043092_0020_101CC908AA93D760"/>
<HI>My Friend, my Friend, my dearest Friend, my Wife,</HI></L>
<L><HI>The greatest Joy and Comfort of my Life,</HI></L>
<L><HI>In Visibles, is now remov'd from me:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Though, as one destitute of Hope, I see</HI></L>
<L><HI>No Cause to mourn for her; but sure I may</HI></L>
<L><HI>Be, for my Loss, concern'd: Yet this can say,</HI></L>
<L><HI>The Lord hath giv'n, the Lord hath took again,</HI></L>
<L><HI>High Praises still be to his glorious Name,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Tho' mine's the Loss, her's is the endless Gain.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Although to me my Loss to bear is hard,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Yet am I from Repining quite debarr'd;</HI></L>
<L><HI>The Lord doth with his Goodness so supply,</HI></L>
<L><HI>My Soul shall ever praise him, till I die.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Bless'd be the Day, wherein my Love abounded,</HI></L>
<L><HI>At first to her, and Friendship firm was founded,</HI></L>
<L><HI>In our United Hearts, my faithful Friend:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Friendship 'twixt thee and me shall never end.</HI></L>
<L><HI>She was my Wife for full ten Years, alas,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Short Time! which we in tender Love did pass</HI></L>
<L><HI>Endearingly, which in our Hearts was sown,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Some Time before, by the Eternal One;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Which, living in our Bosoms, did increase,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Until the Time of her deplor'd Decease,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And now's as fresh as ever. Surely she,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Who wrote of Friendship, Love's extream Degree,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Although with Life, her Pen was much sublim'd,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Yet, did not, as her Bosom held it, find</HI></L>
<L><HI>Words half sufficient, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ully to declare</HI></L>
<L><HI>The faithful Love she to her Friend did bear.</HI></L>
<L><HI>True, tender-hearted, in Affection kind,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Exceeding diligent, and much inclin'd</HI></L>
<L><HI>All for to serve in Love; but much more me,</HI></L>
<L><HI>To Whom she had comply'd my Wife to be.</HI></L>
<L><HI>She to the Age of thirty-four Years staid</HI></L>
<L><HI>A modest, chaste, reserv'd, ingenious Maid;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Who did not only write of Modesty,</HI></L>
<L><HI>In Words profound, and spotless Chastity,</HI></L>
<L><PB REF="043092_0021_101CC90B0C9079F8"/>
<HI>But in Example was, as well as Words,</HI></L>
<L><HI>A Pattern in the same: Wherein accords</HI></L>
<L><HI>Her Life, Works, Writings, Words, true, lovely, sweet,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Which in concinnate Harmony did meet.</HI></L>
<L><HI>And as she wrote of Worship, Truth, and Zeal,</HI></L>
<L><HI>With Courage bold for God, she did not fail,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Being by his Arm upheld, when deeply prov'd,</HI></L>
<L><HI>To stand a faithful Witness: For she lov'd</HI></L>
<L><HI>The Praise of God, more than the Praise of Men;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Therefore was more to him, seem'd less to them</HI></L>
<L><HI>That did not choose his Fear: Wherein she found</HI></L>
<L><HI>Wisdom to stop their Mouths, their Wits confound;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Though of the chief in</HI> Babel's <HI>Learning, they</HI></L>
<L><HI>Stood as amaz'd, and knew not what to say.</HI></L>
<L><HI>A Bishop of two Counties Diocess</HI></L>
<L><HI>Her question'd, she replied, he proved this:</HI></L>
<L><HI>His Chaplain then, the Master's Cause to mend,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Attempting to dispute, was foil'd i' th' End;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Whose Brother, being Lawyer, present cry'd,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Her Learning made her mad; when she reply'd,</HI></L>
<L><HI>He, as asham'd and speechless, turn'd aside.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Thus three great learned Men, of subtil Wit,</HI></L>
<L><HI>To Silence put, did in one Hour submit</HI></L>
<L><HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a little Woman, crown'd with Wisdom's Bays,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Who, in God's Fear did celebrate his Praise,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Declaring boldly 'gainst that Worship, which</HI></L>
<L><HI>God ne'er set up, that makes its Merchants rich.</HI></L>
<L><HI>She lov'd the precious Truth, placed in her Heart,</HI></L>
<L><HI>For which she was imprison'd; but the Smart</HI></L>
<L><HI>Its Adversaries felt: For Joy to her</HI></L>
<L><HI>Thereby accru'd, who did its Cause prefer</HI></L>
<L><HI>Before all Transitories. And, when I</HI></L>
<L><HI>Was Prisouer for the same, it was my Joy,</HI></L>
<L><HI>That she great Exercise did nobly bear,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Therein rejoicing in God's holy Fear:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Though for her Sake, Grief pierced oft my Mind,</HI></L>
<L><HI>When I the Sense did of her Suffering find,</HI></L>
<L><PB REF="043092_0022_101CC911D0195A68"/>
<HI>So deep, that from mine Eyes my Sleep withdrew,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And secret Tears did frequently pursue:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Yea, without outward Notice, once was I,</HI></L>
<L><HI>When she was by Distemper, like to die,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Made sensible thereof, though in the Goal,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Distant near forty Miles, and did condole;</HI></L>
<L><HI>And for her to the Lord I pray'd, whose Ear</HI></L>
<L><HI>Was open, and through Prison-walls did hear:</HI></L>
<L><HI>And he releas'd her from her Malady,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And me from Prison, her again to see;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Though then confin'd, as firm as Men could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ye;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Praises be to God's Name eternally.</HI></L>
<L><HI>She sweetly wrote of Charity divine,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Which in her Heart and Life did clearly shine</HI></L>
<L><HI>More bright, than in her Words; which did extend,</HI></L>
<L><HI>In her, to Poor and Rich, to Foe and Friend:</HI></L>
<L><HI>To all in Plainness she, with due Respect,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Would freely shew her Sense; but to reflect</HI></L>
<L><HI>'Gainst any, being absent, did eschew;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Charity taught her better Things to do.</HI></L>
<L><HI>To any in Affliction, she was free</HI></L>
<L><HI>Advice to give, or Help with Remedy,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Where her Endeavours could; which God did bless,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Remarkably, with the desir'd Success:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Yea, sometimes, when Physicians had been try'd.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Much Money paid, and still the Cure deny'd</HI></L>
<L><HI>To their Performance, she in Freeness gave</HI></L>
<L><HI>What, from Distempers dreadful, prov'd to save.</HI></L>
<L><HI>But Charity in her did farther move</HI></L>
<L><HI>Her tender Heart, in sympathizing Love,</HI></L>
<L><HI>To use her Tongue or Pen, a Word to give</HI></L>
<L><HI>To Minds in Exercise; which did relieve,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Convince, or satisfy, and strengthen some,</HI></L>
<L><HI>The Race of Virtue in their Time to run.</HI></L>
<L><HI>For which, some have good cause to bless the Name</HI></L>
<L><HI>Of God, from whom these Words with Virtue came.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>This is not writ to magnify her Praise,</HI></L>
<L><HI>The Praise belongs to God, who first did raise</HI></L>
<L><PB REF="043092_0023_101CC913B0F6D5F8"/>
<HI>Her Mind, from Things below to seek bis Truth,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Hid in her Heart, in Time of tender Youth;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Which, truly sought, she found, and prized more</HI></L>
<L><HI>Than</HI> Ophir's <HI>Gold, or Pearls of</HI> Indian <HI>Shore.</HI></L>
<L><HI>This taught her to discern the Way of God,</HI></L>
<L><HI>From Ways of Men; this made her love his Rod:</HI></L>
<L><HI>This gave her Knowledge of her Duty right</HI></L>
<L><HI>Unto the Lord; this gave her also Sight</HI></L>
<L><HI>Into the Properties of needful Things,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Of many Kinds, that Mortals Comfort brings:</HI></L>
<L><HI>This gave her, in her tender Years, to see</HI></L>
<L><HI>The frail Estate of poor Mortality;</HI></L>
<L><HI>The Sense whereof she daily did retain,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Striving, with earnest Diligence, to gain</HI></L>
<L><HI>The precious Pearl of Immortality.</HI></L>
<L><HI>As if she knew how short her Time should be;</HI></L>
<L><HI>In Hope of which, when painful Death assail'd</HI></L>
<L><HI>Her mortal Part, her Courage never fail'd,</HI></L>
<L><HI>But did, with Sense as sound as ever, shew</HI></L>
<L><HI>Her true Content, and Satisfaction too.</HI></L>
<L><HI>To leave this World, of true Felicity</HI></L>
<L><HI>To be possess'd to all Eternity.</HI></L>

<HEAD>The following Relation, touching some Discourse that, upon Occasion, she had with Doctor Stratford, so called, Bishop of the Diocess of Cheshire and Lan∣cashire, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<Q><TEXT LANG="eng">
<BODY>
<DIV1 TYPE="text">
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Given forth and attested by my Kinsman Henry Mol∣lineux, who was there present, viz.</HEAD>
<P>UPON the 18th Day of the twelfth Month, 1690, I and another Neighbour were taken Prisoners, and brought to <HI>Lancaster</HI> Jail, upon a Writ <HI>De Excommunicato Capiendo,</HI> for not appearing at the Bishop's Court in <HI>Chester;</HI> though willing to appear, but had no Citation shewed us, nor lawful Notice given: Of which Proceedings, it being witnessed under the Hands of several who were present when such Notice was pretended to be given, she acquainted the said Bishop, he being at <HI>Ormskirk,</HI> near our Dwelling, in the sixth Month, 1691, and it was so evidently manifested to him, that he seemed satisfied of the Truth thereof, and said, <HI>They who should have given the Notice, were to be blamed, &amp;c.</HI> And moderately discoursing with her, he said, <HI>If she would come to his Dwelling-house in</HI> Wigan, <HI>within two or three Weeks, when he had conferred with his Chancellor, if he could find out any Way to do it, he would do any Kindness therein that lay in his Power for her.</HI> Now that which she de∣sired, was that the Prisoners might be admitted in his Court to put in their Appearance; for want of which they were imprisoned. So, upon his Ad∣vice, on the 24th Day of the sixth Month 1691, she went to the Bishop's House in <HI>Wigan,</HI> to receive
<PB REF="043092_0025_101CC918500618B8"/>
his Answer; where he again discoursed with her, and seemed willing that the Prisoners might be ad∣mitted to put in their Appearance; but his Chan∣cellor's Deputy there concluded, that they could not be so admitted. Then the Bishop asked her, <HI>Why they could not pay the Church-leys,</HI> for that was the Cause for which we were prosecuted; she an∣swered, <HI>They could not pay them for Conscience-sake:</HI> He required her to shew him some Scripture for it; then she asked him to shew her any Precept or Ex∣ample in the Scriptures, that the <HI>Jews,</HI> or any of the People of God, ever offered to compel any other People to pay towards the upholding of their Worship, or Worship-houses, or Temples? The Bishop replied, <HI>Tho' he could not do that, yet what Scripture have you for it,</HI> said he, <HI>that you cannot pay to ours for Conscience-sake?</HI> She answering, said, I will offer thee Scripture for it, and it is this: It is said in the Scriptures, <HI>Come out from among them, (my People) and be ye separate, saith the Lord, touch not the unclean Thing, and I will receive you,</HI> 2 Cor. vi. 17, 18. Rev. xviii. 4. Now, said she, if we had believed that you, in your Worship, had been right, we had not come out from amongst you; but because we believed, and were convinced, that it was not right, and therefore are come out from amongst you, we dare not for Conscience-sake touch with you; but if we should pay towards your Worship, or Worship-houses, we should both touch and uphold. To which Answer, the Bishop made no Reply; but he said to his Chancellor's Deputy, <HI>I pray you, Mr.</HI> Prescot, <HI>if you can find out any way, that they may put in their Appearance, that they may have their Liberty, let it be done; and do what Kindness you can for them:</HI> And so he went his way. The Bishop could give no Scripture, in An∣swer to her Question; but she answered his Ques∣tion with Scripture, so that he made no Reply:
<PB REF="043092_0026_101CC91D6FC0EA20"/>
And she, to his Face, bore a faithful Testimony against their Worship, which is prescribed by Men; which Testimony the Bishop did not contradict. And there being then present, one <HI>Entwistle,</HI> the Bishop's Chaplain, so called, and his Brother <HI>En∣twistle,</HI> a Lawyer, and another Priest, and the Bi∣shop's Daughter; when the Bishop was gone, and she and her Kinsman were come out of the House, and were going away, they all four followed; and the said Chaplain, or Priest <HI>Entwistle,</HI> began, and engaged with her in a Dispute concerning Religi∣on; and in about half an Hour, or less, he was so taken and confounded in his own Arguments, that his Mouth was stopped; which his Brother, the Lawyer seeing, as it were to excuse him, said to him, <HI>I wonder you should trouble yourself to discourse with that Woman, she hath so much Learning, it makes her mad.</HI> To which she said, What! do you (Letter-learned) now begin to vilify Learning, by which you have your Honours and Preferments? Then the Lawyer, not speaking any other Word, went away, and she left them.</P>
<CLOSER><HI>Declared and testified by my Kinsman,</HI> <SIGNED>HENRY MOLLINEUX.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</DIV1>
</BODY>
</TEXT></Q>
<P>So the Bishop, and his Chaplain, and the Chap∣lain's Brother, a Lawyer, were all put to Silence by the Wisdom wherewith the Lord endued her, to speak in Defence of the Cause of his Truth: Praises be to God for ever.</P>
<P>After this, we being out of Prison, and under∣standing that the Parish-Priest was endeavouring to get us into it again, (and so we were again impri∣soned) she spoke these Words, which I then wrote, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q><PB REF="043092_0027_101CC9219BF26758"/>
<L><HI>Esuriens agnis quantum concedet in agris</HI></L>
<L><HI>Ipse lupus, vobis jam dabid iste miser;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Crudelisque rapax, cupidus, sine jure, Sacerdos,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Nummos, non Animas, curat, egetque cupit.</HI></L></Q>
Which bears the Signification following, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q><L><HI>Even what the hungry Wolf in Field would do</HI></L>
<L><HI>To feeding Lambs, so will the Wretch to you:</HI></L>
<L><HI>The cruel Priest, fierce, covetous, unjust,</HI></L>
<L><HI>For Money, not for souls, doth cark and lust.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>And so, in getting us into Prison again, the Priest obtained his Point; but he missed of his Prey, and never got it.</P>
<P>Many were the loving, sweet and sensible Epistles, that she sent to me, when in Prison; ever shewing her free Resignation to the Will of the Lord, in all her Exercises, which then were great; and with much Cheerfulness and Patience she went through them. And since her Decease, I found these fol∣lowing Lines, which she had written, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q><L><HI>Tho' some on furious Waves be often toss'd,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And by the stormy Winds oppos'd and cross'd,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And watch'd by raving Pirates, surely they</HI></L>
<L><HI>Are kept by one, whom Winds and Waves obey:</HI></L>
<L><HI>Tho' sometimes exercis'd, thereby to learn</HI></L>
<L><HI>Who guards and sits as Pilot at the Stern,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And with his Arm of Power doth interpose</HI></L>
<L><HI>Betwixt his Children and their wond'ring Fees.</HI></L>
<L><HI>Oh who would not love, honour, and depend,</HI></L>
<L><HI>On such a potent, such a constant Friend!</HI></L></Q>
So she depended upon the Lord, and he preserved her.</P>
<P><PB REF="043092_0028_101CC923279D47F8"/>
In a Letter dated the 9th of the Twelfth Month, 1691, she sent to me in Prison these Lines, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<HEAD>TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE Author of this miscellaneous Grove,</L>
<L>Was fruitful both in Virtue and in Love:</L>
<L>Read but the following Lines, and thou may'st find,</L>
<L>She was the Mistress of a noble Mind;</L>
<L>A Soul, of more than common size, possess'd</L>
<L>Her almost, I had said, too narrow Breast.</L>
<L>True to her Friend, as plainly doth appear,</L>
<L>In dealing plainly with her Friend so dear:</L>
<L>She us'd no gilded Baits, no Flattery,</L>
<L>No feigned Words, but plain Sincerity;</L>
<L>Which doth bespeak her Love, and Virtue too,</L>
<L>Contended one the other to out-do.</L>
<L>In Numbers sweet, her warbling Pen hath try'd</L>
<L>Unerring Truth from Error to divide:</L>
<L>Her Lines, thus measur'd, have successful been</L>
<L>To turn the wand'ring Mind to search within;</L>
<L>Where that invaluable Treasure lies,</L>
<L>Unsought by most, discover'd to the Wise;</L>
<L>But yet conceal'd and hid from vult'rous Eyes.</L>
<L>'Tis not the common Way, I must confess,</L>
<L>To write in Verse; although 'tis ne'ertheless</L>
<L>To be esteem'd; because some do disdain,</L>
<L>And undervalue what they can't attain:</L>

For want of Wings their untun'd Souls to raise</L>
<L>Unto a Pitch of Harmony and Praise.</L>
<L>Oft have I seen the Lark upon the Wing,</L>
<L>Toward the Sun ascend, and sweetly sing,</L>
<L>As if she had a Tribute due to pay</L>
<L>Unto the mighty Ruler of the Day,</L>
<L>In well composed Songs of tuneful Breath,</L>
<L>Such as the Swan repeats before her Death.</L>
<L>Thus was our Author's noble Faculty</L>
<L>Employ'd to render Thanks, in Melody,</L>
<L>To Him, from whom she did her Life receive;</L>
<L>To Him, who never sparingly doth give</L>
<L>To them that, to His Praise, His Gifts do use,</L>
<L>And with His Blessings don't the World abuse.</L>
<L>'Tis such as these unto the Well can sing,</L>
<L>That bubbles up from the eternal Spring;</L>
<L>And these alone, that to themselves secure</L>
<L>A Place, where Waters fail not, and where Bread is sure.</L>
<L>I' th' Praise of noble Verse, much I might say,</L>
<L>Which, tho' by some abus'd, its Value don't allay.</L>
<L>A Pearl will not the less a Crown adorn,</L>
<L>'Cause by a filthy Swine it hath been worn,</L>

<L>We read in sacred Writ of some that wore,</L>
<L>The Jewels of the Lord, and play'd the Whore.</L>
<L>We also read, how <HI>David,</HI> with his Lyre,</L>
<L>Could still <HI>Saul's</HI> Rage, and sooth his secret Fire,</L>

<L>His Psalms are full of Hymns and Songs of Praise,</L>
<L>Prophetick mystick Flights, in heavenly Lays;</L>
<L>Which may suffice to let the Reader know,</L>
<L>He was a Poet, and a Prophet too.</L>
<L>The wisest Prince that ever fill'd a Throne,</L>

<P>IN the unfeigned Love, my Heart is concerned for thee, really desiring thy temporal and eter∣nal Welfare: I should be glad indeed to be made instrumental for thy Satisfaction, in Doubts or Scruples; but, alas! Words or Arguments cannot, without the powerful Influence of the living Eter∣nal Word in thy own Heart, resolve or disannul the Consultations and Reasonings of this kind, that may inwardly arise, or be by others suggested unto thee: Yet this is in my Mind to signify, touching the Word <HI>[Thou]</HI> that besides the Properness there∣of, it is the Phrase and Language used in Scripture, by some owned for a Rule; and 'tis mostly a slavish Fear of Men, that in the Hearts of those that would shun the Cross, deters from the Use of it. Yet I desire not to invite thee to a bare Formality, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for until thou art convinced in thy own Mind, that
<PB N="2" REF="043092_0036_101CC9391410FE50"/>
the Day of small Things is not to be despised, and knowest that Power and Love which capacitates and enables to undergo Trials; which are indeed but momentary, in comparison of the exceeding Weight of Glory, that unto the Faithful is and shall be revealed, it signifies little; but it is written, <HI>He that will be my Disciple, must take up the Cross,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>As for the Names of Days or Months, as now used, they are contrary to Scripture, where it is written, the <HI>first</HI> and <HI>second,</HI> &amp;c. as in <HI>John</HI> xx. 1, 19. and in <HI>Zephaniah</HI> iii. 9. there is a Promise, <HI>I will turn the People to a pure Language,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>I will take away the Names of Baalim out of her Mouth,</HI> Hos. ii. 17.</P>
<P>Now concerning outward Sacraments, as thou termest them; they indeed are outward only, and Shadows; but the Substance being come, they flee away. Neither can outward Water purify the Conscience, nor outward Bread nourish the immor∣tal Soul. And tho' in the Infancy of some, such Things were in Condescension permitted, as also Circumcision; yet the Baptism of Christ, which was then said to exceed <HI>John's,</HI> was with the Holy Ghost, and with Fire, which quickens and purifies the Heart, Soul, and Body; which <HI>Paul</HI> preferred before <HI>Touching,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Col. ii. 21. 22.</NOTE> <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sting,</HI> and <HI>Handling,</HI> all which perish with using, after the Doctrines of Men, &amp;c. Christ, the Substance of all Shadows, is now by many witnessed to be come, to nourish the inward Man; whereof the Lord alone, in his tender Love, can make thee truly sensible, as thou abidest faithful to what is already revealed; even in the true Fear, the Fountain of Wisdom, the chiefest Treasure, which the Thief can never break through to steal.</P>
<P>Know farther, dear Cousin, That <HI>the Secrets of the Lord are with them that fear him;</HI> and, <HI>He that

<P>THE Lord can and will preserve those that love and depend upon him, and love the Light, bringing their Deeds to it, that they may be made manifest; as it is written, <HI>Eph.</HI> v. 13. <HI>whatsoever makes manifest, is Light,</HI> and that with∣in revealed, even in the Heart.

<P>DISTANCE of Place cannot easily cancel the Characters of true Friendship from solid Minds; especially where the true Marks of Christ's Disciples are manifest, viz. <HI>Love,</HI> which is indeed the Fulfilling of the royal Law; for it beareth all Things, thinks no Evil, and seeketh not its own, but others Good: In this therefore is the true Per∣fection, which I desire we may daily more and more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> after, and travail for.

<P>I HAVE received two Letters from thee, the first of which doth signify thy going to a Meeting, where thou heardst <HI>M. Worrel,</HI> &amp;c. whereof I was very glad, desiring the Effect thereof may not easily be raced out of Mind. I do dearly desire thee, not to prolong thy Servitude in <HI>Egypt's</HI> Land, the Land of Darkness: For I may tell thee with Grief, many have suffered Loss by consulting with Flesh and Blood, and a glorious Day hath passed over their Heads, O who knows what Instruments the Lord is preparing for himself? Let us wait to be made Vessels of Honour for his heavenly House, wherein the Righteous shall dwell in everlasting Peace, and Joy unutterable, and full of Glory, in the Presence of the immaculate Lamb, who reigns in the holy City, and is alone worthy to reign for ever, and evermore, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

thou considerest the Cause, which I suppose ere this, thou art informed of, <HI>viz.</HI> Some hurryings of us before Magistrates, for being at an Evening meeting; who, having required Bonds for Appear∣ance at Sessions, we not being willing to enter into Bonds, tho' we promised to appear, were many, of us committed to be sent to <HI>Lancaster;</HI> we came to the Castle betimes the third Day of our setting out, which was the last Sixth-day, not being wearied so much as sometimes in going to our Monthly-meet∣ing: Blessed be the Name of the Lord, who pre∣served <HI>Israel'</HI>s Feet from swelling in their Travels of old. His Arm of Power is the very same as ever; and we can say, our Confinement is not grievous to us: For these strong Walls cannot se∣clude us from our best Beloved, who is our exceed∣ing great Reward. For his Presence is near, and his tender Care over us continually, beyond Ex∣pectation, making our Trials easy. This day we had a very sweet Meeting, a good Friend being come to visit us; and we daily find ourselves en∣gaged to bear with Patience (if I may so say, being not proved above the Power granted us) those Things which are for Trials to us.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>CAN any but a second Self judge how wel∣come thy kind Epistle was to confined Friends? Or can such an one ignore the grateful Reception thereof? Surely nay. And tho' thou seemest concerned, and I believe art so indeed, for these our Exercises, yet do I really desire thou mayst rather sympathize with me, in that Solace and true Satisfaction of Mind, which in great mea∣sure abolisheth the small Trouble of Confinement, especially to single Persons; for it is probably more to those that have the Charge of Families. And tho' sometimes other Friends, Prisoners in the Cas∣tle in other Rooms, keep the Key of ours, and and other Times the Under-Jailor, it is all one to us that know <HI>Israel'</HI>s King and Keeper to be our Guard; whose universal Love and Spirit penetrates the proudest Walls: And we can truly say, We lay us down and sleep in Safety; for the Lord sus∣tains us, and watcheth over us; he is our Rock and strong Tower, and he restrains the Wrath of Men as he pleaseth. But if he permits us to be proved yet more, his blessed Will be done; he is All-sufficient to support, as well as ever: Let no∣thing discourage thee from following him, who is wise to prove whom he loves.</P>
<P>I was never Prisoner before this Time, nor never better contented to be one; and the Lord hath preserved me unto a suitable Season, blessed be his Name for ever.</P>
<P>As to what Act, whereby they proceed against us, I value not, they are all alike to me; it is in vain to wage War with them their own Weapons: But the indictment, read at the Quarter

But we may not be ignorant, that the Entrance into the Kingdom is through many Tribulations: And the Power is as sufficient to preserve as ever; or else what would become of us every Day? Ah! let us never forget to lean to it; for <HI>Israel's</HI> King was well pleased with one that leaned on him of old, so that he was noted to be the Disciple whom Jesus loved: O Love incomprehensible! Who can enough admire thee?</P>

<L>MY Sins are numberless, more than the Hair</L>

<L>O how my Soul doth languish in Distress,</L>

<L>Ensnar'd with Folly, and enticing Sin!</L>

<L>That I may this deformed Sin despise,</L>
<L>And quite forsake all earthly Vanities,</L>
<L>Which me into temptation thus hath brought,</L>

<L>Truly lament my Sins, so manifold!</L>
<L>My Sins, which will, except thou grant Relief,</L>
<L>O'er whelm me with intolerable Grief.</L>
<L>Awake, awake, my Soul, do not remain</L>

From Evil, learn his Precepts, follow him,</L>
<L>Who freely gave his Life thee to redeem</L>
<L>From this vain World, from Sin and Slavery,</L>
<L>That brings to endless Woe and Misery:</L>
<L>He bought thee dear, with his most precious Blood,</L>
<L>Shed on the Cross for thine and others Good.</L>
<L>But, ah! how oft have I despis'd true Joys,</L>
<L>And plac'd my Heart on transitory Toys?</L>
<L>How oft did I the glorious Pearl refuse,</L>
<L>Vile empty Husks, that nourish not, to chuse?</L>
<L>Look down upon me, and commiserate,</L>
<L>Most gracious Lord, my lamentable State;</L>
<L>And tenderly lead thou me back again</L>
<L>Into the Land of Promise, whence I came</L>
<L>Into this Land of Darkness; where, alas!</L>
<L>I thus was brought to Bondage and Distress:</L>
<L>For, ah! thou King of Kings, if thou reject me,</L>

<L>Whither, or to what Refuge, shall I fly,</L>

<L>Renew my Strength, dear Lord, that so I may</L>

<HEAD>On GOD'S LOVE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE King of Kings, the great Eternal One,</L>
<L>Sent from his Bosom his beloved Son,</L>
<L>Lost Man to seek, and to restore ag'in,</L>
<L>From the most vile Captivity of Sin;</L>
<L>Who for our Sakes his Father's Throne forsook,</L>
<L>And, as a Servant, freely on him took,</L>
<L>The Form of Man, and among Mortals came,</L>
<L>Yea, meekly bore the Cross, despis'd the Shame,</L>
<L>Walking on Earth amongst his chosen Ones,</L>
<L>The <HI>Isra'lites,</HI> beloved <HI>Jacob's</HI> Sons.</L>
<L>But they, rebelling in disdainful Pride,</L>
<L>Their King, their Saviour disown'd, deny'd,</L>
<L>Because he did not, to the sensual Eye,</L>
<L>Unveil his Glory and his Majesty.</L>
<L>The Rays that did around his Temples shine,</L>
<L>His Mein, his Speech, bespoke him all divine.</L>
<L>Yet this vain Off-spring did him still deny,</L>
<L>Accuse, condemn, degrade and crucify;</L>
<L>Who patiently resign'd his Life, his Breath,</L>
<L>And, thro' his <HI>Lamb-like Sufferings,</HI> conquer'd Death.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="12" REF="043092_0046_101CC956C23E8A08"/>
<L>Thus they with wicked Hands did crucify</L>
<L>The spotless Lamb, descended from on high:</L>
<L>Yet him they could not long i' th' Grave detain,</L>
<L>But with great Glory he arose again;</L>
<L>Astonishing the Watchmen at the Tomb.</L>
<L>He, to their great Amazement, forth did come:</L>
<L>Which, when they to the Rulers did declare,</L>
<L>They charg'd them not to noise it in the Ear</L>
<L>Of the <HI>Plebeian</HI> Multitude; but say,</L>
<L>That his Disciples stole him thence away,</L>
<L>While they slept in the Silence of the Night.</L>
<L>Thus seeking, by Deceit, to hide the Light</L>
<L>That then was dawning, to confound its Foes;</L>
<L>But for a Leader, and a Guide, to those</L>
<L>That meekly waited for its Consolation;</L>
<L>They have entail'd a Curse upon their Nation.</L>

<LG>
<L>But <HI>Isra'l's</HI> Glory's surely broken forth,</L>

<L>A then despised Corner of the Earth.</L>
<L>Should we not now, in Lowliness of Mind,</L>

<L>TRUTH pleas'd to say, <HI>Ten Virgins typify</HI></L>
<L><HI>The heav'nly Kingdom's sacred Mystery.</HI></L>
<L>Ten Virgins, and but five were counted wise:</L>
<L>Tho' all, alas! inclin'd to slumbering Eyes,</L>
<L>Both wise and foolish; yet the King discern'd</L>
<L>Who were his faithful Ones, for they had learn'd</L>
<L>To be prepar'd and in their Vessels they</L>
<L>Had taken Oil, and labour'd in the Day,</L>
<L>And furnished their Lamps: that in the Night,</L>
<L>The Bridegroom coming suddenly, they might</L>
<L>Find Favour and Admittance in to see</L>
<L>The sacred nuptial Joys; as also be</L>
<L>Happy Partakers of the same: When they</L>
<L>That foolish were, and idly slept away▪</L>
<L>Their precious Time, not having Oil, must go</L>
<L>To buy; but then, too late returning to</L>
<L>The Door, they find it shut; where, tho' they cry,</L>
<L><HI>Lord open to us!</HI> Ah! the sad Reply</L>
<L>Will be, <HI>I know you not; depart from me,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Ye foolish Workers of Iniquity.</HI></L>
<L>Then may they wander, destitute of Light,</L>
<L>In horrid Darkness of perpetual Night.</L>
</LG>

<L>Now, you that would be number'd with the <HI>Wise,</HI></L>
<L>Take heed of sleeping in Formalities;</L>

<L>And so be unprepared in the Night:</L>
<L><PB N="25" REF="043092_0059_101CC97A60A963A0"/>
For though you imitate the Wise, and bear</L>

<L>Have Oil in th' Vessel, that your <HI>Lamps</HI> may shine;</L>

<L>The midnight Cry, <HI>Arise, prepare, prepare</HI></L>
<L><HI>To meet the Bridegroom;</HI> 'tis the Wise that shall</L>
<L>Be entertain'd, that waited for the Call,</L>
<L>And in their Vessels kept the Oil for Light;</L>

<HEAD>On TRUTH.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>TRUTH in the inward Part is my Delight,</L>
<L>To meditate therein both Day and Night,</L>
<L>And feel its pure enliv'ning Power in me,</L>
<L>Surmount all Pleasure that on Earth can be</L>
<L>Enjoy'd by Mortals: Ah, this is alone</L>
<L>More precious than the Diadem or Throne</L>
<L>Of <HI>Egypt'</HI>s Land! O how my Soul admires it,</L>
<L>And in the Secret of my Heart desires it,</L>
<L>Above all transitory fading Things!</L>
<L>For this alone true Satisfaction brings</L>
<L>To to the immortal Soul; then how can I,</L>
<L>But, in true Meekness and Humility,</L>
<L>Bow down before the glorious Majesty,</L>
<L>And Supplication make, that this may be</L>
<L>Abundantly each Day reveal'd in me</L>
<L>By th' Holy Ghost; that so a contrite Heart</L>
<L>May be prepar'd, by <HI>Truth</HI> in th' inward Part,</L>
<L>And offer'd up a living Sacrifice</L>
<L>Unto the Lord, who never will despise</L>
<L>A truly humble, broken, contrite Heart,</L>
<L>Because he loves <HI>Truth</HI> in the inward Part:</L>
<L>Who can but prize it! For th' Eternal Love</L>
<L>Distils sweet Show'rs of Blessings from above,</L>
<L>Into the Heart, where this abides and dwells;</L>
<L>Which, with its heav'nly Lustre, far excels</L>
<L>All oriental Gems: The Rubies rare,</L>
<L>Or sparkling Diamonds, may not compare,</L>
<L>Or be esteem'd with this; its Worth exceeds</L>
<L>Them all, as <HI>Sharon'</HI>s Rose all noisome Weeds</L>
<L>In aromatick Fragrancy transcends;</L>
<L>And as by sacred Influence extends</L>
<L>A spicy Sweetness to what's touch'd thereby,</L>
<L>And tinctures with a sacred Sympathy;</L>
<L>As when one formerly was pleas'd to knock,</L>
<L>T' awake his Love, the Handles of the Lock,</L>
<L><PB N="36" REF="043092_0070_101CC99937879B50"/>
Embalm'd with Droppings of sweet <HI>smelling Myrrh,</HI></L>
<L>Stream'd with a Virtue, that enamour'd her,</L>
<L>Who 'rose to open to him, so that she</L>
<L>Was wounded deep, O sacred Sympathy!</L>
<L>Nor could she rest till seeking far and near,</L>
<L>Her best Beloved did again appear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This is that princely Lover, that inspires</L>
<L>The Hearts of Mankind with such pure Desires</L>
<L>After himself: And those that be affected</L>
<L>With Love sincere, the World must be rejected</L>
<L>By such, for their Beloved's Sake; for he</L>
<L>A perfect Recompence to them will be,</L>
<L>Love can admit no Rivals; they must choose</L>
<L>But one, and then the other quite refuse:</L>
<L>For he that loves <HI>Truth</HI> in the inward Part,</L>
<L>Ought to be sole Possessor of the Heart;</L>
<L>Then in this Pilgrimage he'll grant a Guide</L>
<L>Unto their Steps, lest they should turn aside;</L>
<L>Even this for ever blessed <HI>Truth</HI> within,</L>
<L>Which, as the Light, doth first discover Sin;</L>
<L>Then, as it is obey'd, the Heart and Mind</L>
<L>Hereby comes to be cleansed and refin'd</L>
<L>(As Gold refined in the Fire from Dross)</L>
<L>From all Pollutions; and upon the Cross</L>
<L>The Enmity is slain, and holy Awe,</L>
<L>With true Submission to the royal Law,</L>
<L>Springs in its stead; thus Sin and Wickedness</L>
<L>Cast out and conquer'd, perfect Righteousness</L>
<L>Is then brought in, whereby Salvation is</L>
<L>Reveal'd, with Earnest of eternal Bliss.</L>
<L>Thus Man's redeem'd unto a blessed State,</L>
<L>That was become lost and degenerate,</L>
<L>Through Disobedience to that sacred Law,</L>
<L>Enjoin'd to Man at first, thereby to draw</L>
<L>To sole Dependance on the chiefest Good,</L>
<L>Who granted him the <HI>Tree of Life</HI> for Food,</L>
<L>Till he transgress'd; but then Man presently</L>
<L>Became a Slave to Sin and Vanity.</L>
<L><PB N="37" REF="043092_0071_101CC99B1898A950"/>
So as by Disobedience in that Day,</L>
<L>Man, hearkening to the Serpent, lost his Way</L>
<L>In Death's dark Region; if his pensive Mind</L>
<L>Begins sincerely, by some Glimpse inclin'd,</L>
<L>T' obey the Light of Life, he comes to be</L>
<L>Redeem'd from Death and Darkness, and set free;</L>
<L>Free from Captivity of Sin and Death,</L>
<L>To serve the Lord of Life, who gave him Breath,</L>
<L>Yea, Life and Being; and when e'er he pleaseth</L>
<L>But to with-hold his Power, the Creature ceaseth</L>
<L>To move: In him alone is Life and Love,</L>
<L>In whom the Righteous always live and move,</L>
<L>As led by this pure, holy, blessed <HI>Truth,</HI></L>
<L>The inward Word, the Guide of Age and Youth.</L>
<L>For by this may a young Man cleanse his Way;</L>
<L>And to the Aged, 'tis their Strength and Stay;</L>
<L>This surely is the goodly Pearl of Price;</L>
<L>And this is <HI>Mary'</HI>s well approved Choice:</L>
<L>This is the hidden Treasure that doth lie</L>
<L>So undiscerned by the carnal Eye;</L>
<L>Which, whosoever finds, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elleth all</L>

<L>SOmetimes, <HI>dear Friend,</HI> this riseth in my Heart,</L>
<L>Come let's with <HI>Mary,</HI> choose the better Part;</L>
<L>Of which the Meek shall not deprived be:</L>
<L>Her Seat was low, in deep Humility,</L>
<L>At holy Jesus's Feet, where her Desire</L>
<L>Was still to hear that Voice, which did inspire</L>
<L>Her Heart with fervent Love. She did not seek</L>
<L>Usurped Power, but learned to be meek;</L>
<L>For certainly, the humble Hearted shall</L>
<L>Exalted be; but Pride portends a Fall.</L>
<L>Whoever would be great, must first be low</L>
<L>And little, and a true Subjection know</L>
<L>To that which teacheth Lowliness of Mind;</L>
<L>And to the Truth their All must be resign'd,</L>
<L>Before they can obtain that true Content,</L>
<L>And solid Joy, that's firm and permanent:</L>
<L>Such then may say, No Solace, Joy, nor Love,</L>
<L>Like unto this, which freely from above</L>

<HEAD>Of MODESTY.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>SOME covet to be deck'd in rich Attire,</L>
<L>With Gold and Pearl, that others may admire,</L>
<L>Esteem, and honour them; and that they may</L>
<L>Advance a Beauty, that will soon decay.</L>
<L>If Imperfections did not lodge within,</L>
<L>What mean these Deckings of the fading Skin?</L>
<L>They, in whose noble Breast true Virtue dwells,</L>
<L>Need not so much t'adorn their outward Shells;</L>
<L>For Modesty doth many Ways express,</L>
<L>To all Observers, innate Comliness:</L>
<L>Modest Attire, and Meekness, signify</L>
<L>A Mind compos'd of native Purity;</L>
<L>Needs no Appendices for to set forth</L>
<L>A Jewel of more admired Worth,</L>
<L>Than <HI>Indian</HI> Mines can boast; those beautify</L>
<L>A Sepulchre, and make it fair to th' Eye;</L>
<L>But this shews innate Worth, and adds thereto</L>
<L>Such Lustre, those alone could never shew:</L>
<L>For where there is a chaste retired Mind,</L>
<L>Th' Apparel, Gesture, Speech, and Looks confin'd</L>
<L>Within the Bounds of Modesty, proclaim</L>
<L>An upright Heart, kept clear from Spot or Stain:</L>
<L>This both adorns the Gravity of Age,</L>
<L>And doth in blooming Years timely presage</L>
<L>A right heroic Heart; where Liberty,</L>
<L>That's inconsistent with true Modesty,</L>
<L>Is not desir'd: Such study to behave</L>
<L>Themselves discreetly, modest, meek, and grave;</L>
<L><PB N="65" REF="043092_0099_101CC9E65408D090"/>
But if a Smile appear, such as a Child</L>
<L>Reflects on's his Mother, in Love undefil'd,</L>
<L>'Tis guarded with such simple Innocence,</L>
<L>As gives no just Occasion of Offence.</L>
<L>For Modesty in Covenant doth bind</L>
<L>The Eyes, lest they prove Traitors to the Mind;</L>
<L>But ne'er instructs the Hand to plant a Snare,</L>
<L>Lay Nets with gaudy Garments, plaited Hair,</L>
<L>Or other golden Superfluities,</L>
<L>To captivate vain Hearts, and wand'ring Eyes:</L>
<L>No, it abhors whatever seems to be</L>
<L>A Blemish unto chaste Simplicity:</L>
<L>Yet proves itself a far more potent Charm,</L>
<L>Than <HI>wanton</HI> Looks, but <HI>daunts</HI> approaching Harm,</L>
<L>Like some strong Fortress, whence the Enemy</L>
<L>Retreats, despairing of a Victory.</L>
<L>Thus Modesty, and spotless Innocence,</L>
<L>Is often to itself a sure Defence.</L>
<L>This is the Virgin's Ornament, whereby</L>
<L>Beauty's adorn'd; for this doth beautify,</L>
<L>Where fading Colours flourish not, and may</L>
<L>Be term'd a <HI>Dow'r,</HI> whose Worth shall ne'er decay.</L>
<L>Sure Men, as Men, cannot forget to prize it;</L>
<L>Tho' some, as Brutes, not minding it, despise it;</L>
<L>Else would their Words and Gesture rarely be</L>
<L>So poisonous, with gross Impiety:</L>
<L>Obscene Discourse, that horrid Smoke that fumes</L>
<L>From scorching Darkness, that within consumes</L>
<L>Some broil'd tormented Hearts, cannot proceed</L>
<L>From a <HI>chaste</HI> Breast, no Rose brings forth a Weed.</L>
<L>For this doth always constantly retain</L>
<L>Such an Abhorrence of all frothy, vain,</L>
<L>Absurd Expressions, that 'twill manifest,</L>
<L>The sad Resentment of a troubled Breast,</L>
<L>In crimson Colours; which do oft appear</L>
<L>In modest Blushes, when th' unwilling Ear</L>
<L>Is made Partaker of such Words as be</L>
<L>A bold Affront to spotless Modesty.</L>
<L><PB N="66" REF="043092_0100_101CC9E7DFB38638"/>
Although there doth no inward Guilt upbraid,</L>
<L>Or bring Indictment; yet with Looks dismay'd,</L>
<L>They signify Disgust, and seem to fear</L>
<L>They should be censur'd, being present where</L>
<L>Such Words were utter'd (though injuriously)</L>
<L>As one with them in the Conspiracy.</L>
<L>Some say, 'tis <HI>Treason</HI> but to lend an Ear</L>
<L>To <HI>treasonable Speeches,</HI> and forbear</L>
<L>T' accuse, or else to leave the Company.</L>
<L>Thus chaste <HI>Clitomachus,</HI> through Modesty</L>
<L>Quickly departing, shew'd that he abhorr'd</L>
<L>The needless Guilt of an uncivil Word,</L>
<L>Whene'er he heard it; and 'twas worthily</L>

<L>Would, if observ'd, teach all Men to detest</L>
<L>Such criminal Expressions, as declare</L>
<L>Their Owners odious to a modest Ear;</L>
<L>Yet Precedents of Virtue may be found</L>
<L>Of good Effect, when those of Vice abound.</L>
<L>Nor let it seem to any sober Mind</L>
<L>A Paradox, that Modesty should find</L>
<L>A Place in either Sex, although it be</L>
<L>Ascribed to the one peculiarly.</L>
<L><HI>Reason,</HI> that honours Mankind more than Beast,</L>
<L>Gives forth its Laws and Dictates in each Breast;</L>
<L>Virtue should therefore in both Sexes dwell;</L>
<L>Some may in these, and some in those, excel:</L>
<L>Yet this, with many more, are not confin'd</L>
<L>To either solely; but the prudent Mind</L>
<L>In both embrace it; for it regulates</L>
<L>Deportment both in high and low Estates:</L>
<L>For where she dwells, insulting Arrogance,</L>
<L>Or any unbecoming Confidence,</L>
<L>Must not remain, lest these defile and stain</L>
<L>The Heart, where Virtue should prevail &amp; reign;</L>
<L>That Modesty may by its Influence,</L>
<L>Hide and avoid Occasion of Offence.</L>
<L><PB N="67" REF="043092_0101_101CC9EAE686B390"/>
As Scripture Record to Posterity,</L>
<L>Doth chronicle the virgin Modesty</L>
<L>Of <HI>Shem</HI> and <HI>Japhet,</HI> who went back to hide</L>
<L>The Nakedness their Brother did deride;</L>
<L>On whom the Curse became thereby entail'd</L>
<L>To after Ages, but a Blessing seal'd</L>
<L>To them, and to their Progeny, whose Names</L>
<L>(Like to a precious Ointment, that retains</L>
<L>Its Fragancy) shall still inherit Praise,</L>
<L>And be a Precedent to latter Days.</L>
<L>For though the Memory of some doth rot,</L>
<L>Virtue shall live, and never be forgot:</L>
<L>The wise in Heart esteem it, and thereby</L>
<L>Order their Conversation prudently,</L>
<L>And would not an unseemly Act commit,</L>
<L>Though mortal Eye should ne'er discover it:</L>
<L>For Modesty, that in their Bosom reigns,</L>
<L>Detests and loaths whatever spots or stains;</L>
<L>Restraining from all Rudeness, it inclines</L>
<L>To Gravity and Meekness, and refines</L>
<L>The Languages intimating, that we should</L>
<L>Be swift to hear, but never overbold</L>
<L>To speak, though eloquent; and then take heed</L>
<L>Lest Words extravagantly may exceed</L>

<L>They seem to summons in the list'ning Croud:</L>
<L>Nor should they savour of Scurrility;</L>
<L>For these are not the Effects of Modesty,</L>

<L>Whilst prudent Minds delight to contemplate</L>

<L>The sweet Experience whereof, I find,</L>
<L>Is, by a noble and ingenious Mind,</L>

<L>Who conquers Self, Virtue more noble calls,</L>

<L>No. no; for Love, the universal Love,</L>

<L>O come, and in true Lowliness of Mind,</L>
<L>Receive Instruction! <HI>Seek, and ye shall find,</HI></L>

<L>To seek the Piece of Silver, hid within</L>

<L>Unto the Voice, that doth in secret say,</L>
<L>As one behind thee, <HI>This is Wisdom's Way,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Walk in it;</HI> this will lead to lasting Joys;</L>
<L>Despise them not for transitory Toys.</L>
<L>Aim'st thou at Honour? Know, a sudden Puff</L>

<L>Seek Honour from above, and fear the Lord,</L>
<L>And hearken to his holy living Word,</L>
<L>Hid in thy Heart, that frequently reproves:</L>

Before it be a Word of Consolation,</L>
<L>And bring the Soul glad Tidings of Salvation.</L>

<L>Is not thereby approv'd, but he that does it:</L>
<L>The Doer of the Word is justify'd,</L>

<L>To spend their wretched Days in Misery,</L>

<L>They safe arrive; venture again, yet more</L>
<L>Undaunted than at first, in hopes to be</L>
<L>With more Success, kept from those Dangers free.</L>
<L>Then why should such Faint-heartedness appear,</L>
<L>In <HI>Israel's</HI> Camp, that ought of right to fear</L>
<L>None but the Lord? Can any doubt, that have</L>
<L>The Word of an almighty King, to save</L>
<L>Them to the uttermost? What! though he seem</L>

<L>We find, 'tis vain to hope for Help from Men.</L>
<L>Ah, was not <HI>Israel</HI> thus beset? Could they</L>

<L>Wherein he leads, except we ran astray?</L>

We must through Exercises overcome,</L>
<L>And bear the <HI>Cross,</HI> if we would wear the <HI>Crown,</HI></L>
<L>And fully follow him! The Recompence</L>
<L>Will far exceed when we are parted hence.</L>
<L>But who art thou, that art so loath to give</L>
<L>Up an Estate? A Thief may soon deprive</L>
<L>Thee of a greater Share, than he requires;</L>
<L>Some suffer more by Carelesness and Fires:</L>
<L>Which justly Heaven permits, to let them see</L>
<L>How vain these poor, these trifling Treasures be.</L>
<L>Or dost thou fear Confinement? Heav'n may send</L>
<L>Grievous Diseases, which Physician's Hand</L>
<L>Cannot remove, and to th' uneasy Bed</L>
<L>Make thee a Pris'ner when thy Health is fled.</L>

<L>He will a Prison much more pleasant make,</L>
<L>Than any spacious Palace: For he'll be</L>
<L>Fulness of Joy, and saving Health to thee.</L>
<L>Now, tho' some shun the Cross, as worldly wise,</L>
<L>And from the Path of Truth apostatize,</L>
<L>And yet the Judgments do not soon ensue,</L>
<L>(Altho' they be in dreadful Vengeance due)</L>
<L>So that the Wicked did of old aver,</L>
<L><HI>Surely the Lord his coming doth defer:</HI></L>

<L>Ah, kiss the Son, lest that his Anger be</L>

<HEAD>On DANIEL.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHEN <HI>Babel's</HI> Grandees, by unjust Decree,</L>
<L>With royal Signet, surreptitiously</L>
<L>Obtain'd, and seal'd an Edict, that none should</L>
<L>Exhibit a Request, or be so bold</L>
<L>To make Petition, save unto their King,</L>
<L>In thirty Days, in hopes thereby to bring</L>
<L>T' inevitable Ruin, and destroy</L>
<L>The Prophet <HI>Daniel,</HI> whose Sincerity,</L>
<L>Was well approved; Can we find, that he</L>
<L>Was e'er so startled at the rash Decree,</L>
<L>As to omit what formerly he knew</L>
<L>Was an incumbant Duty, or to shew</L>
<L>His Zeal for <HI>Israel's</HI> God? But every Day</L>
<L>Did he not, with his Window open, pray</L>
<L>As formerly, and boldly supplicate</L>
<L>For <HI>Israel's</HI> Seed in their afflicted State?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now some may say, <HI>What Daniel, couldst not thou</HI></L>
<L><HI>In Heart, and in thy private Closet bow,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And make Petition in his Ear, that hears</HI></L>
<L><HI>Deep Sighs and Groans, as well as louder Prayers;</HI></L>
<L><HI>But indiscreetly thus thyself expose</HI></L>
<L><HI>A sought-for Prey unto thy watchful Foes?</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No, no; he stood not to consult his own</L>
<L>Security, as knowing GOD alone,</L>
<L>Whom he ador'd, was able to restrain</L>
<L>The Wrath of Man, and in his sacred Name,</L>
<L>Support his faithful Ones, though Trials should</L>
<L>Be heaped on them, even sevenfold;</L>
<L>Or else would give the sweet Experience,</L>
<L>Of a desirable Deliverance.</L>
<L>Thus noble <HI>Daniel,</HI> when Spies attended,</L>
<L>He, as a Criminal, was apprehended</L>
<L>And cast, by Sentence of malicious Men,</L>
<L>Into the (now more gentle) Lions Den;</L>

Whither, approaching in the royal Robe</L>
<L>Of spotless Innocence, th' eternal God,</L>
<L>That holds the Lives of Creatures in his Hand,</L>
<L>Muzzled the Lions Mouth, with a Command</L>
<L>Of Abstinence; and whisper'd in their Ear</L>
<L>Such Dread, that they durst not approach to tear</L>
<L>The <HI>Angel guarded,</HI> Prey; but still must wait,</L>
<L>Though Hunger-bit, for other coarser Meat.</L>
<L>But <HI>Babel's</HI> King could not be unconcern'd,</L>
<L>For upright <HI>Daniel:</HI> Ah, his Bowels yearn'd</L>
<L>For this his faithful Subject: So that he</L>
<L>Could take no Rest, but early rose to see</L>
<L>What was become of him, or if the Power</L>
<L>Of <HI>Israel's</HI> God, whom <HI>Daniel</HI> did adore,</L>
<L>Was able to preserve him from the Paws</L>
<L>Of those Devourers, and their rav'nous Jaws:</L>
<L>Whereof, when <HI>Babel's</HI> King was satisfy'd</L>
<L>By <HI>Daniel's</HI> Answer, who there testify'd</L>
<L>His Loyalty to Heaven, his Innocence</L>
<L>Towards the King, he's soon removed thence;</L>
<L>Whilst his Accusers must become a Feast</L>
<L>For them that durst not touch the sacred Guest:</L>
<L>Th' eternal Arm's the same, his Love's the same,</L>
<L>To those that trust sincerely in his Name.</L>
<L>But those that doubt when he is pleas'd to prove,</L>
<L>And saw such signal Tokens of his Love,</L>

<L>Too much against us, whilst our Courage fails;</L>
<L>Do by Distrust and Doubting oft, I fear,</L>
<L>Prevent those <HI>Wonders,</HI> which might else appear.</L>
<L>Alas! 'tis Faith that conquers; he believ'd,</L>
<L>And doubted not, and therefore was reliev'd:</L>
<L>For he resisted even unto Blood,</L>
<L>Therefore the Lord brought all about for Good.</L>
<L>Shall Man prescribe a Way for him, whereby</L>

To bear the first Assault of the Enemy,</L>

<L>No, no; for he, the only wise Commander,</L>

<LG>
<L>WHen conq'ring <HI>Babel's</HI> Foes were subjugate,</L>
<L>And fair <HI>Jerusalem</HI> depopulate,</L>
<L>King <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> triumphed in Pride,</L>
<L>And his Concerns of War seem'd laid aside:</L>
<L>Who glorying in his Strength, not in the Lord,</L>
<L>Formed a golden God to be ador'd.</L>
<L>Now this great Image, made by mortal Hand,</L>
<L>Must worship'd be (such was the King's Command)</L>
<L>Tho' senseless, helpless, tho' he ne'er could bless</L>
<L>Their Warlike Enterprizes with Success;</L>
<L>But 'tis the King's Decree, and then who dare</L>
<L>Resist, but such as do a Greater fear?</L>
<L>The Sentence is, <HI>The fiery Furnace must</HI></L>
<L><HI>Consume the Rebel's Body unto Dust.</HI></L>
<L>Yet they were captive <HI>Jews</HI> of royal Blood,</L>
<L>Who, in their Zeal for <HI>Israel's</HI> God, withstood</L>
<L>That cursed Edict, that vain Law reject.</L>
<L>That Decree with them had small Effect:</L>
<L>Then the Informers, that observ'd the <HI>Jews,</HI></L>
<L>And sought for an Occasion to accuse</L>
<L>The Innocent, (as some do now) drew near;</L>
<L>And first, to gain Acceptance in his Ear,</L>
<L>Said, <HI>Live, O King, forever! Thou hast made</HI></L>
<L><HI>A firm Decree, which some have not obey'd;</HI></L>
<L><HI>E'en three conceited Jews, who neither thee</HI></L>
<L><HI>Regard, nor to thy Gods do bow their Knee.</HI></L>
<L>O how his Fury doth at this arise!</L>
<L>That any should his golden God despise:</L>
<L><PB N="109" REF="043092_0143_101CCA6011392A18"/>
His Visage doth its native Features change;</L>
<L>His Eyes, with sparkling Rage, proclaim Revenge:</L>
<L>Therefore, at his Command, they all in haste</L>
<L>The Persons of the Innocent arrest;</L>
<L>Call'd <HI>Shedrach, Meshach,</HI> and <HI>Abednego,</HI></L>
<L>And they before the wrathful King must go</L>
<L>To prove the Matter, and, it seems to try</L>
<L>If they would bow; which when they still deny,</L>
<L>As knowing, he alone that did create</L>
<L>The Fire, and all Things else, could soon abate</L>
<L>Its Violence; and from the threatning Hand</L>
<L>Of <HI>Babel's</HI> King, deliver them who stand</L>
<L>In Awe to none but him, and fear not Man;</L>
<L>But dread the living God, who only can</L>
<L>Kill and destroy, or save and keep alive;</L>
<L>For he to Man doth Life and Being give,</L>
<L>This they believing, did not study how</L>
<L>To answer; but resolved not to bow</L>
<L>To any, but the Lord: Although the King</L>
<L>Seem'd in his Wrath, to count it as a Thing</L>
<L>Impossible, that any God could be</L>
<L>So potent, to withstand his fierce Decree.</L>
<L>But great JEHOVAH did that Law confound;</L>
<L>For when all <HI>Three</HI> were in their Vestments bound,</L>
<L>And cast into the furious fiery Flame,</L>
<L>Th' Eternal Word did pow'rfully restrain</L>
<L>Its proper Quality, and so surround</L>
<L>Them with Defence, no Harm on them was found:</L>
<L>Yet did the Fire retain its former Vigour,</L>
<L>And manifest it with resistless Rigour,</L>
<L>Against those Men, who bold to execute</L>
<L>The King's Command, the Just did persecute:</L>
<L>Which, when <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> saw, dismay'd,</L>
<L>He rose in Haste, and to his Nobles said,</L>
<L><HI>Were not Three Men cast bound into the Fame!</HI></L>
<L>They answer'd, <HI>True:</HI> The King reply'd again,</L>
<L><HI>Now, in the Midst thereof, behold, I see,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Four Men walk loose, and from their Fetters free,</HI></L>
<L><PB N="110" REF="043092_0144_101CCA62B7252060"/>
<HI>Whereof the Fourth seems cloath'd in Majesty,</HI></L>
<L><HI>As Son of the immortal Deity.</HI></L>
<L>Thus was the Lofty forced to confess,</L>
<L>There was a Power above him, and to bless</L>
<L>The God of <HI>Israel;</HI> set his Servants free,</L>
<L>That, trusting in him, would not bow the Knee</L>
<L>Unto, or serve another than the Lord,</L>
<L>Their only God; but, as with one Accord,</L>
<L>Did yield their Bodies to his Will, that they</L>
<L>Might magnify him in their Trial-day.</L>
<L>Consider now, had they not faithful been,</L>
<L>The captive Seed of <HI>Israel</HI> had not seen</L>
<L>That great Deliverance, so signally</L>
<L>Wrought for them, that in true Simplicity,</L>
<L>Resign'd themselves, their All, unto the Lord,</L>
<L>Who is alone worthy to be ador'd:</L>
<L>Nor <HI>Babel's</HI> Monarch been constrain'd to bless</L>
<L>His holy Name, who reigns in Righteousness;</L>
<L>Deposing Kingdoms unto whom he sees</L>
<L>Most fit, and changing Men's perverse Decrees.</L>
<L>Lord, may thy Wisdom, in these latter Days,</L>
<L>Limit, or turn Man's Wrath unto thy Praise!</L>
<L>Put thou an Hook into the Jaws of those,</L>
<L>That study politickly to oppose,</L>
<L>Thy Works of Love and Wonder in the Land,</L>
<L>And with their Subtilty seek to withstand</L>
<L>The Progress of despised <HI>Israel,</HI></L>
<L>In their Return towards the holy Hill,</L>
<L><HI>Zion,</HI> the sacred Mount of thy Renown,</L>
<L>Which <HI>Babylon</HI> hath sought to batter down,</L>
<L>But never shall prevail; although she seem</L>
<L>To sit in Pomp, like to a stately Queen,</L>
<L>That sees no Sorrow; all her Pride is vain;</L>
<L>For fall she must, and never rise again;</L>

<L>ETernal Love, before whose glorious Face</L>
<L>All Times are present, filling ev'ry Place;</L>
<L>Uncircumscribed, unexcluded! Can</L>
<L>Thy boundless Mercy to forgetful Man</L>
<L>Be told! Or can thy long Forbearance be</L>
<L>Enough admir'd? Great dreadful Majesty!</L>
<L>Ah, let my Soul, in a true living Sense</L>
<L>Now ruminate on the sweet Influence</L>
<L>Of that abounding Goodness, which from thee</L>
<L>Did freely reach to such a Worm as me!</L>
<L>The Beast, that cleaves the Hoof, &amp; chews the Cud,</L>
<L>Was by the ancient Law proclaimed good:</L>
<L>And thou'rt pleas'd to enjoin thine <HI>Israel,</HI></L>
<L>In humble due Acknowledgement, to tell</L>
<L>Thy mighty Wonders, each one to his Friend,</L>
<L>Whereby thou brought'st 'em to the <HI>promis'd Land.</HI></L>
<L>So 'mongst the many Favours, Lord, of thine,</L>
<L>May I now call to Mind that doleful Time;</L>
<L>Wherein, as pondering of my State, I found</L>
<L>(Though Life and Virtue doth with thee abound)</L>
<L>Myself as one of those dry senseless Bones,</L>
<L>Which lay in th' open Valley, which thou once</L>
<L>Did'st shew thy Prophet, all exceeding dry,</L>
<L>Until thou pleas'd to cast a tender Eye</L>
<L>Of Pity on them, and the Answer give</L>
<L>Unto that great Demand, <HI>Can dry Bones live?</HI></L>
<L>By breathing on them, when thy gracious Hand</L>
<L>Had gather'd them, and by thy bless'd Command</L>
<L>Cloath'd them with Flesh: <HI>Great King!</HI> thy Pow'r's the same</L>
<L>It was of old, and cannot move in vain.</L>
<L>Thus, though at first my miserable State</L>

<L>VIrtue is the right <HI>sacred Spring,</HI> whence flows</L>

<L>No stormy Sea, nor utmost Land can sever</L>

<L>Is not by Place, though far remote, confin'd.</L>
<L>True Friends, when they by Distance are bereaven</L>
<L>Of verbal Converse, have their Names engraven</L>
<L>In one another's Hearts, which cannot be</L>
<L>Cancell'd or raz'd by Earth's vain Obloquy:</L>
<L>Yet, lest the same should, as a glimmer'ring Spark,</L>
<L>Seem to expire, as buried in the Dark,</L>
<L>There is by Mediums (if the place deny</L>
<L>Them, <HI>Viva voce,</HI> free Community)</L>
<L>Reciprocal Reflections of its Beams</L>
<L>Unto each other, couch'd in sable Streams;</L>
<L>Though the abounding Solace doth increase,</L>
<L>When Friends converse together Face to Face;</L>
<L>Then freely they unbosom their Requests,</L>
<L>And treasure Secrets in each others Breasts,</L>
<L>As in firm Cabinets, close lock'd, where none</L>

Is one oppress'd with Grief? He lays a Share</L>

<L>Swims one in Solace? Finds the Cause of Joy?</L>
<L>'Tis then re-doubled by Community:</L>
<L>Mourns one? The other mourns: Doth one rejoice?</L>
<L>His second Self then, both in Heart and Voice,</L>

<L>Without an inward secret Sympathy.</L>
<L>But fawning Parasites, though they pretend,</L>
<L>In Compliment to be each others Friend,</L>
<L>For meer Self-Int'rest, or some close Design,</L>
<L>Become, if not proud Enemies, in Time</L>

<L>Friendship hath try'd: Mistakes are soon forgot,</L>
<L>If any interpose, or would present</L>
<L>Some Crime, to cause a Frown in Discontent.</L>

<L>Such Scars, whereby true <HI>Love,</HI> not <HI>Rage,</HI> prevails:</L>
<L>And when it is unto Perfection grown</L>

<L>Gentle Advice, whereby one may reclaim</L>

His Neighbour lose his Way, will not direct</L>
<L>Unto a better; or that will reject</L>
<L>Good Exhortation, fancying Reproof</L>
<L>A greater Crime than he is guilty of.</L>
<L>Self-hood is often blind; therefore a Friend</L>
<L>Is not prohibited to reprehend,</L>
<L>So he proclaim not Faults, But they that would</L>
<L>Sin uncontroul'd, and hug their Errors, should</L>
<L>Never contract a Friendship, lest thereby</L>
<L>That sacred Name be stain'd with Infamy</L>
<L>Is any wise, that when Distempers do</L>
<L>Begin to seize, would not desire to know?</L>
<L>Diseases known, are sooner cur'd; but they</L>
<L>That would indulge and hide them, that they may</L>

<L>Themselves, as a Derision to their Foes.</L>
<L>True cordial Friends, without Offence, can bear</L>
<L>King Admonition, though it be severe</L>
<L>The faithful Wounds of Friends are like Incision,</L>
<L>Made by the skilful Hand of some Physician,</L>
<L>To let our noxious Humours that invade</L>
<L>The afflicted Part, and stubbornly impede</L>
<L>The hoped cure; which afterwards with Speed</L>

<L>Thus, by this needful Freedom, <HI>Friendship</HI> shines</L>
<L>With greater Lustre; but its Light declines,</L>
<L>Where this is limited. Who can but grieve</L>
<L>To be so over-power'd, not to relieve</L>
<L>A Friend afflicted; that may not apply</L>
<L>A precious Balm to heal his Malady?</L>
<L>But there's rejoicing, when with equal Mind</L>
<L>Exchanging Thoughts, they may in any kind</L>
<L>Express their Sentiments, and signify</L>
<L>Reproof or Approbation faithfully.</L>
<L>Thus still persisting in the sweet Increase</L>

But as true Virtue's rarely to be found,</L>
<L>So Friendship grows not up in every Ground:</L>

<HEAD>A Letter to a Friend.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>SOmetimes this Query riseth in my Mind,</L>
<L>Can Friends be to each other so unkind,</L>
<L>Thus to perplex, and yet not shew the Cause</L>
<L>Why Friendship should admit so long a Pause?</L>
<L>Hath Grandeur stupify'd thy fertile Quill,</L>
<L>Or Mammon metamorphos'd thus thy Will?</L>
<L>So condescending formerly, and kind,</L>
<L>As if to Love and Friendship most inclin'd.</L>
<L>Methinks Abundance of such outward Store</L>
<L>Should ne'er abridge our Time, but gain us more.</L>
<L>Not that Wealth can add Number to our Days;</L>
<L>But Time (wherein the Indigent may raise</L>
<L>Some Stipend, to procure their daily Food)</L>
<L>Might be improv'd, as for a mutual Good,</L>
<L>By such as have obtain'd a full Supply;</L>
<L>Or else wherein doth the Advantage lie</L>
<L>Betwixt the Rich and Poor? Heaven still extends</L>
<L>Bread, to sustain each to their latter Ends.</L>
<L>Then should not those, that greater Mercy share,</L>
<L>Some Time for Friendship's Privileges spare?</L>
<L><PB N="131" REF="043092_0165_101CCA9B4A418CA0"/>
But should my Grief by Words be thus express'd,</L>
<L>I'll cease to write, and only sigh the rest;</L>

<HEAD>Another Letter to a Friend.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>MY hasty Pen about to write unkind,</L>
<L>(When interrupted by my zealous Mind)</L>
<L>Again admits of dear <HI>Marcaria;</HI> tho'</L>
<L>Thy tedious Silence gives Affront unto</L>
<L>True cordial Friendship, which in ev'ry State</L>

<L>Which, seeming now to cease, gives <HI>Cause</HI> of Doubt,</L>
<L>Some new Concern hath jostled Friendship out</L>
<L>From that fair Bosom; where, if yet it dwell,</L>
<L>'Twill by its influencing Power dispel</L>
<L>Whate'er would stop its Current: For we see</L>
<L>That standing Pools oft-times corrupted be,</L>
<L>When smaller Brooks, whose Streams do gently glide</L>
<L>Along their Banks, are purg'd and purify'd.</L>
<L>Alas, that Love that burns with Fervency,</L>
<L>Is frequently perplext with Jealousy!</L>
<L>Then why so silent? Why so strangely mute?</L>
<L>Must I indeed not only find my Suit</L>
<L>Ungranted, but disdain'd? And must I be</L>
<L>Therefore unanswer'd, for a Penalty</L>
<L>To be impos'd, as for a heinous Crime?</L>
<L>Tho' I forgot once a Request of thine,</L>
<L>I did not wholly throw aside my Pen;</L>
<L>But, as full fraught with other Matter, when</L>
<L>In hopes of sending, though I did omit</L>

<L>May now so long restrain thy careless Pen,</L>
