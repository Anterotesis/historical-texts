<HEAD>Eulogy.</HEAD>
<P>OUR duty, my Fellow-Townsmen, on this distressing occasion, is dictated by the dignity and resplendent virtue of the beloved Man whose death we deplore. We assemble to pay a debt to departed merit, a debt which we can only pay by the sincerity of our grief, and the respectful effusions of gratitude; for the high∣est eulogy left us to bestow upon our lamented WASHINGTON, is the strict narration of the truth, and the loftiest character which we can as∣sign to him, is the very display of himself. When ambition allies itself to guilt, when power tram∣ples upon right, when victory triumphs in blood, when piety sits clouded in superstition, when hu∣mility is affected by cunning, when patriotism is founded on selfishness; then let adulation spread her prostituted mantle, to screen the disgraces of
<PB N="8" REF="037967_0005_10102E54B4251730"/>
her patrons, and amuse with the falsehoods of her imagination. But to our political Father, the faithful page of history is panegyric, and the happiness of his country is the monument of his fame.</P>
<P>COME, then, Warriors! Statesmen! Philoso∣phers! Citizens! assemble round the tomb of this favourite son of virtue; with all the luxury of sorrow recollect the important events of his life, and partake of the greatest legacy which a mortal could bequeath you, in the contemplation of his example. Whilst we solemnize this act, his dis∣embodied spirit, if it be permitted to retrace the scenes of its terrestrial existence, will smile with approbation on the instructive rite.</P>
<P>YOUR anniversaries have long honoured the eleventh of February, one thousand seven hun∣dred and thirty-two, as the birth-day of our il∣lustrious Chief, and the parish of his own name in Westmoreland county, in Virginia, boasts itself the place of his nativity. But to souls like his, local restrictions are not attached. Where Lib∣erty was, there would be his country: Happy for us, the Genius of Liberty, responsive to his affections, resolved that where WASHINGTON was, there also should be her abode.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="037967_0006_10102E56571BD138"/>
EDUCATED by private instruction, his virtue grew with his knowledge, and the useful branch∣es of literature occupied the whole powers of his mind. Exemplary for solidity of thought, and chastity of morals, he was honoured by the gov∣ernment of Virginia, with an important mission, at an age when the levities of the human character seldom yield to the earliest operation of reason.</P>
<P>AT the opening of the great war of encroach∣ments upon our western frontiers, he was the bearer of the remonstrance to the French. Such was the address, fidelity and perseverance with which he executed this important trust, that he was honoured at twenty-two years of age with the command of a regiment raised by his prov∣ince. His military talents were soon called to the test. At Redstone, Victory perched upon his standard; but, with that volatility by which she tries the powers of her favourite heroes, she in a few months afterwards left him, by his own exer∣tions, to save the honours of war for his little band, in an unequal, but well supported battle. In Braddock's slaughtered army, he was a wit∣ness to scenes of horror, which his caution, had it been adopted, would have prevented, and
<PB N="10" REF="037967_0007_10102E5C26799430"/>
which his steady courage assisted much to retrieve. During the remainder of this war, he was em∣ployed in fortifying his native province, in ar∣ranging and perfecting its militia, and in check∣ing the incursions of the enemy, until the crisis of the contest had passed in this country, when he resigned his command.</P>
<P>RETIREMENT to him was only a different mode of action, and his repose partook not of indolence. Amidst the honourable pursuits of agriculture, he discharged various civil offices, until we find him rising amongst the patriots of our country, as a delegate from Virginia, in the first American Congress.</P>
<P>WE shall ever remember the fifteenth day of June, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, when Providence directed to his appointment as the commander in chief of our revolutionary army. In this neighbourhood he first drew his sword. Many of you, my Fellow-Townsmen, were then languishing under the fetters of tyranny, or were imprisoned within the joyless confines of your own habitations. Your hope was fixed on him. His command, independent of the resources of his own mind, afforded no ground for the support of your feelings. He had an army brave indeed, but with
<PB N="11" REF="037967_0008_10102E5EC3344448"/>
little discipline; naked at the approach of winter; and almost subject to dissolution from temporary enlistments; a pay-master without money; a com∣missary struggling on the utmost stretch of credit. A veteran army lay under his eye strongly forti∣fied, regularly paid, warmly clothed, and boasting its superiority to militia. Yet did his victorious sword relieve you, and save your city. Justly have you ascribed "your reinstatement to his wise arrangements, which compelled your invaders to adopt a less destructive policy than that which on other occasions they so wantonly practised." Could our gratitude forget it, the heights around us bear the triumphant evidence of his conquest.</P>
<P>To trace this protector of our liberties through his unrivalled career, from his gloomy retreat through the Jersies to his several victories and his splendid triumph at York-Town, would be to narrate the varying history of our revolution. To him, public labour was amusement, suffering in the cause of freedom was a luxury, and every hour as it flew carried an offering to his country.</P>
<P>As obedience to the voice of his oppressed fel∣low-citizens drew his sword on the approach of war, so at the declaration of peace, by the same respected
<PB N="12" REF="037967_0009_10102E608FCB0F70"/>
voice he restored it to its scabbard. He left them his blessing and their liberties. O Human Nature, how hast thou been traduced! With thee, has it been said, is essentially connected that lust of power which is insatiable; which restores not vol∣untarily what has been committed to its charge; which devours all rights, and resolves all laws into its own authority; which labours not for others, but seizes the fruits of their labours for itself; which breaks down all barriers of religion, soci∣ety and nature that obstruct its course; now art thou vindicated! Here we behold thee allied to virtue, worn in the service of mankind, superior to the meanness of compensation, humbly hoping for the thanks of thy country alone, faithfully sur∣rendering the sword, with which thou wast en∣trusted, and yielding up power with a promptness and facility equalled only by the diffidence and re∣luctance with which thou receivedst it.</P>
<P>Now, will the future inquirer say, this Hero has finished the task assigned him, the measure of his glory is full. A world is admitted to free∣dom—a nation is born. Favoured beyond the leader of Israel, not only with the prospect, but with the fruition of the promised blessing, he has
<PB N="13" REF="037967_0010_10102E625AAB1660"/>
retired, like that prince of meekness, to the <HI>Mount,</HI> whence he is to ascend, unseen by a weeping people, to the reward of all his labours. No, he is to live another life upon this globe; he is to reap a double harvest in the field of perennial honour. The peo∣ple whom he has saved from external tyranny, suffer from the agitations of their own unsettled powers. The tree of liberty which he has planted, and so care∣fully guarded from the storms, now flourishes be∣yond its strength, its lofty excrescences threaten to tear its less extended roots from the earth, and to prostrate it fruitless on the plain. But, he comes! In Convention he presides over counsels, as in war he had led the battle. The Constitution, like the rainbow after the flood, appears to us, now just emerging from an overwhelming commotion; and we know the truth of the pledge from the sanction of his name.</P>
<P>THE production was worthy of its authors, and of the magnanimous people whom it was intended to establish. You adopt it, you cherish it, and you resolve to transmit it, with the name of WASH∣INGTON, to the latest generation, who shall prove their just claim to such an illustrious descent.</P>
<P>WHO was so worthy, as our great legislator, to direct the operations of a government which his
<PB N="14" REF="037967_0011_10102E642F7A3878"/>
counsels and his sword had laboured to erect? By a unanimous suffrage he was invited to the exalted station of President of the United States. The call was too sacred to admit of doubt; It superseded the happiness of retirement, the demands of private interest, the sweet attractions of domestic society, and the hazard (forgive it, WASHINGTON! for thou wast mortal) the hazard of public reputation. Behold the man on this occasion so mighty in the eye of all the world, so humble in his own! He accepts the high appointment with such distrust of his natural endowments, with such diffidence in his capacity, as can be relieved only by his reliance on that almighty BEING, "who rules over the universe, who presides in the councils of nations, and whose providential aids can supply every hu∣man defect."</P>
<P>ONE of the earliest acts of his administration was that circular visit to transfuse his love, and receive the grateful benedictions of his loving countrymen, in which you, my Fellow Townsmen, partook so liberal a share. What sensations rush∣ed upon your minds, when you compared the dreadful aspect of your besieged city, with its now smiling condition. The well-cultivated fields were screening from view the late terrific ramparts of
<PB N="15" REF="037967_0012_10102E6A35B79E10"/>
the enemy, and the groans of the distressed had yielded to the busy noise of commerce and pleasure. How grateful now is the recollection, that with tears of joy you crowded to meet him in your streets, displaying the very insignia which you this day bear in mournful procession; and your children, bowing their heads with eager solicitude to attract his fatherly eye, received his pious blessing.</P>
<P>DID the occasion admit of it, how pleasing would be the review of his administration, as our Supreme Executive Magistrate! His talents and his virtues increased with his cares. His soul seemed not to bear the limits of office, a moment after the obligations of duty and patriotism with∣drew their restraints from his universal love. When the misguided savages of the wilderness, after feeling his chastisement, had sued for peace, he seemed to labour for their happiness as the com∣mon representative of mankind. Insurrection was so struck at his countenance, that it fled from the shock of his arms. Intrigue attempted to entan∣gle him in her poisonous web, but he burst it with gigantic strength, and crushed▪ her labours. An∣archy looked out from her cavern, and was dashed into oblivion, as we trust, forever. The nations
<PB N="16" REF="037967_0013_10102E6D54C74A48"/>
of Europe saw the wisdom of our laws, the vigour of our measures, the justice of our policy, the firm∣ness of our government, and acquiesced in the neutrality of our station.</P>
<P>THE dangers of the Commonwealth having subsided at the close of his second administration, he felt himself justified, after dedicating forty-five years of his valuable life to her service, in with-drawing to receive with resignation the great change of nature, which his age and his toils dem∣onstrated to be near. When he declined your fu∣ture suffrages, he left you a legacy. What! like Cesar's to the Romans, money for your sports? Like Attalus's, a kingdom for your tyranny? No; he left you not such baubles, nor for such pur∣poses. He left you the records of wisdom for your government: a mirror for the faithful rep∣resentation to your own view, of yourselves, your weaknesses, your advantages, your dangers: a magnet which points to the secret mines and windings of party spirit, faction, foreign influ∣ence: a pillar to the unity of your republic: a band to inclose, conciliate, and strengthen the whole of your wonderful and almost boundless communities. Read, preserve the sacred deposit;
<PB N="17" REF="037967_0014_10102E6EEE322818"/>
and lest posterity should forget the truth of its maxims, engrave them on his tomb, that they may read them when they weep before it.</P>
<P>IN his second resignation of power and the charms of office, the American Leader appears superior to ancient or modern examples. Yet another grade was assigned to his virtue. Our national rights, so well defended at home, were invaded on the ocean. The alarm reaches his re∣treat; the honour of our Republic warms his heart; and he again accepts the sword for its de∣fence from the hand of another, placed by the voice of the people in that supreme magistracy, which he alone had heretofore filled. With a less dignified soul, this official inferiority might have availed to injure his country; but he who could descend from the head of a nation to discharge the minutest duties of a private citizen, was too great to allow the influence of etiquette to endan∣ger the safety of the people. His condescension raises him above himself; his spirit fires all ranks of men; he is overwhelmed with the gratitude and applause of an enraptured nation.</P>
<P>WHILST we confide in his arm, and are mar∣shalling our warriors to march under his banners,
<PB N="18" REF="037967_0015_10102E7084593090"/>
the GOD of armies, whose counsels are beyond the scrutiny of man, prepares for us the test of our submission to his chastising rod. It is decreed that our WASHINGTON shall die, but that his death shall be worthy of his life. He is to die by the hand of Virtue. The rapid disease which is selected as the instrument of his dissolution, in∣stantaneously seizes him. His humanity delays the immediate aid to which alone it may yield. Inconsolable Domestics! what storms would you not have braved, what hazards would you not have encountered, to save that life which was sacrificed to your comfort and safety! At length Science flies to save him. Alas! what avails its skill against the mandate of Heaven? It comes too late!—It is finished.</P>
<P>WONDERFUL event! Greatness departs in glory, and envy is silent! All acknowledge him to be the first of citizens, and none feel hurt by his superiority. So impartial was he that none im∣peach his justice; so moderate, none complain of his power; so magnanimous, his conquered ene∣mies applaud his humanity; so philanthropic, that neither colour, nor climate, nor religion, nor poli∣tics could exclude the unfortunate from his suc∣cour.
<PB N="19" REF="037967_0016_10102E75759DE420"/>
He had the habit of combining sentiment with action in such method and force, that he shed his benevolence on communities of men with the same ease as the sudden impulse of momentary sen∣sibility bestows it upon individuals. Unexampled virtue! allotted to its merited reward. Many founders of nations have been left to obtain from posterity that reputation which prejudice or big∣otry has denied at their deaths. The tomb has been necessary to bury anger, petty interests and emulation, which barred an equitable judgment. But in regard to this Sage, the gratitude of his country has been co-existent with his exertions. Time has not been required to remove him from our view, in order to magnify his exploits through the medium of same; nor was it requisite that we should be deprived of the good he had done us, to entertain a just sense of its importance. Medals and statues have been decreed him when living, and your tears announce his greater triumph in your hearts, when dead. Disinterested love! What motives have you, freemen, for thus offer∣ing up your applause? He has now no shield to defend you from the invasions of your enemies; his head lies cold in the grave, and no counsel can arise from his lips. His eyes were closed by his
<PB N="20" REF="037967_0017_10102E78B6C20D18"/>
own unshaken hand, and no smile can now beam from his countenance to animate your troops. Grateful Republicans! indeed you weep not from selfishness. Afflicted with the thought of the bless∣ings which he has showered upon yourselves and your children, you would call him, could your voice be heard, from the closed mansions of the dead, again to receive the tribute of your affection. You weep for her, whose tender participation in the anxieties of a husband relieved his cares, and protracted the invaluable life which love itself could no longer detain. Disconsolate woman! mourn not, for the faithful is gone to receive the reward of his uprightness. The whole desire of his heart, the whole pursuit of his labours has been the good of his fellow-men. Contrast him with those who have been raised by the emp∣ty, the criminal admiration of mankind, to the highest ranks in the Pantheon of fame. See one instead of liberating and protecting, employ∣ed in conquering and enslaving a world, and weeping that his guilty task could be contin∣ued no longer. Another retiring from the purple, not with the united blessings of all religious sects, but the bigoted persecutor of the only rational and divine religion: See the master of so many
<PB N="21" REF="037967_0018_10102E7A42FB7D20"/>
crowns, after yielding them up for a convent, in∣stead of interesting himself in the welfare of man∣kind to the hour of his departure, relapsing into the absurdities of monkish superstition! and an∣other, whose ashes are scarcely cold, slaughtering the armies of half the nations of Europe, to extend the limits of an Electorate, with as much zeal as our departed Hero laboured to extend the limits of freedom, civilization and morals. When so much worth steps off from the stage of life, the weakness of our nature is the only apology for our tears. Such an exit is not death, it is the triumph of the just.</P>
<P>SONS of Freedom! as you regard the memo∣ry of your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scended Chief, attend to the injunc∣tions of his will. Remember that it was not for you alone he laboured. It was for your posterity also; it was for the human race. For you and for them he was first in building the noblest polit∣ical system that adorns the world. It is an experi∣ment to ascertain the nature of man; whether he be capable of freedom, or whether he must be led by the reins of tyranny; whether he be endow∣ed with that moderation and understanding which checks the extreme indulgence of his will; and by allowing to others the same rational enjoyment
<PB N="22" REF="037967_0019_10102E7EF9A998C0"/>
with himself, forms the liberty of the whole upon the partial restraint of each individual; or wheth∣er he must go on attempting to follow the dictates of selfishness, and find his only restraint in a pow∣er which will establish itself independent of his con∣sent, and make him its slave. Who of us can be supposed to be so lost to himself, so forgetful of his children, and so traitorous to the world, as to con∣template the overthrow of this magnificent tem∣ple of wisdom? No, my Fellow-Townsmen, what∣ever zeal may suddenly suggest, or apprehensions tempt us to suspect, there lives not a man among us, so depraved, so cursed by Heaven. Shall it be said, that the works of his hands whom we this day almost adore; that the hope which he held out to the nations of the earth, shall be frustrated by our divisions? To the honour of our country, not a man but answers, No: all, when rightly inform∣ed, wave their particular prejudices in support of the great pillar of our national union. It is our pride; it was erected by our fathers; it is the standard of our defence. Let us then, with a view of forever maintaining it, banish all animosity, melt down all parties, wipe away all distinctions. Let us no longer designate men who have differed in senti∣ment, by odious epithets mutually reflected and
<PB N="23" REF="037967_0020_10102E81EF0166C8"/>
mutually disavowed: but if a common name be wanted, let it be formed from his whom we now seek to honour, and let it be used to denote good will to one another, respect to our Constitution, fortitude to our enemies, love to our country, de∣votion to our GOD.</P>
<P>IN the condolence of this day, we cannot fail to notice the honour which we feel by the presence of the Fathers of the State. It was not unbecom∣ing the dignity of office, on such an occasion, to suspend its occupations and join the general sor∣row. To devote this portion of time to his mem∣ory who devoted a long life to our happiness, is rational and just. Within the present political year, you, Honourable Magistrates and Legisla∣tors, in this place solemnized the obsequies of the late excellent Governor of our Commonwealth, the much respected SUMNER. Thus pass away the wise, the virtuous and the faithful; by an ir∣revocable decree, less unwelcome to them, as it respects themselves, than grievous to us. Their lives are long enough for their own glory, but, alas! still too necessary to their country's welfare. The experience, the learning, the genius, the vari∣ous coincidence of circumstances, which are neces∣sary
<PB N="24" REF="037967_0021_10102E83DC2E91B0"/>
to form that effulgence of character, by which they enlighten, polish and direct society, fall to the lot of few. When such lamps are extinguish∣ed, we are happy if our darkness be transient. But in your wisdom the people of our Commonwealth safely confide; nor as members of our united country, do they mourn like those who are with∣out hope; for although in the present gloom of our political hemisphere, their late ruling planet has travelled to the morning of another clime, yet its kindred luminary rises on the horizon, brilliant, steady, and propitious to direct their course. They lament that their beloved WASHINGTON sleeps in death; their consolation is, that his faithful Brother, the vigilant ADAMS, survives.</P>
