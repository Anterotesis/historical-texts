<Q><HI>KNOW YE NOT THAT A PRINCE AND A GREAT MAN IS FALLEN THIS DAY IN ISRAEL?</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE are the words of a mourner, who lamented the death of one not allied to him by the ties of blood; but a man of shining talents and distinguished abilities, whose services were greatly needed at that time.</P>
<P>The mourner was David, King of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. The person whose fall he lamented was Abner an offi∣cer of the first rank.</P>
<P>This Abner was captain of the host, he had been general of Saul's army, was near the pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> of the King and possessed a large share of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> confi∣dence and favor.</P>
<P>He was faithful to king Saul, during his reign,
<PB N="6" REF="038307_0004_10119E3E4ADEF198"/>
and zealously supported the interest of his family after his decease.</P>
<P>This man was not only in high favor with the King; but with the people <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ he had a large share of their confidence.</P>
<P>Some may think, perhaps, that Abner's forsa∣king Ishbosheth, Saul's son, and throwing his in∣fluence into the scale of his rival, is a blot in his character. But Abner might find Ishbosheth to be a haughty, jealous, if not an effeminate prince, and unfit to govern a kingdom, and for this reason, as also to save the blood of his country by uniting the contending parties, use<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his influence to establish the regal dignity in the hands of David.</P>
<P>But if this was any blemish in his character, the royal mourner did not take notice of it, or view it in that light.</P>
<P>But this I shall leave, and attend to the eulogium in the text, a prince and a great man.</P>
<P>His being called a prince seems to import that Abner was the chief, or head of a family in the tribe. This was a title of honor given to the head of the tribes of Israel: they were princes of the congregation.</P>
<P>It seems to have been an ancient as well as mod∣ern custom to give men in public offices an honor∣ary title; such as was attached to their office.</P>
<P>But titles of honor are not always connected with a true greatness of character. King David seems
<PB N="7" REF="038307_0005_10119E40B70C9B08"/>
to have been aware of this, and therefore mentions Abner, not only as an honorable personage, but as a great man.</P>
<P>It was the greatness of this man's character, which made him to be so much lamented. He was pos∣sessed of talents which were of importance to the State, and such as were wanted at that time.</P>
<P>There was no man so well calculated to unite the tribes of Israel, at that time divided, as was Abner. He was not only in high favor with David; but he had such influence with the tribes of Israel, as to be able to incline them to any party, and engage them to support any interest he might be disposed to favor.</P>
<P>With great ease he drew the ten tribes into his views of supporting David whom God had chosen, and anointed to be King over his people. His in∣fluence with the people was so great, as to bow the hearts of all ranks to the house of David, which happily terminated a contest for the regal dignity, that was dangerous to the State. Thus the twelve tribes were united and became one band, invincible, to their enemies.</P>
<P>Thus the hands of David were strengthened, and he was established in the kingdom.</P>
<P>So much influence in a subject may be thought dangerous to the State: and influence so extensive, employed against government, would throw all things into confusion, and might ruin a nation. But when superior talents added to influence so ex∣tensive as was Abner's, are directed by a generous,
<PB N="8" REF="038307_0006_10119E42452BE210"/>
patriotism, and employed for the support of gov∣ernment, the most pleasing and happy effects are to be expected.</P>
<P>The active genius and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> talents of Ab∣ner, were what made him appear great in the eyes of David.</P>
<P>When we consider the character of David, that he was a man of virtue, of an honest mind, yea, "a man after God's own heart," we are constrain∣ed to believe he spoke what he thought was truth, when he announced Abner to have been a great man.</P>
<P>David was a man of too nice a sense of honor, and had too great a regard to truth, to ascribe a greatness of character to a man whom he did not think worthy of it.</P>
<P>King David knew Abner: he had accompanied him in former wars—had been an eye witness of his conduct in the exalted rank of Captain of the host, or General of the army—he had seen that he behaved himself wisely—that his plans were form∣ed with judgment and executed with dispatch, that he was resolute and persevering in accomplishing whatever he undertook, and was equal to the most important enterprises, he was therefore con∣vinced that Abner merited the eulogy in the text.</P>
<P>Abner having attached himself <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the interest of David, the latter had no doubt raised expectations from his abilities and influence. He had reason to expect in that man a firm friend, and an able sup∣porter of his government—that by his exertion
<PB N="9" REF="038307_0007_10119E45E21BA8B0"/>
his (David's) interest, which might have appeared doubtful, would be much strengthened.</P>
<P>The address and talents of Abner, were of signal advantage to the Kings. By the prudent counsels, the engaging manners, and convincing argument of the former, the tribes of Israel had been won over to the interest of the latter▪ they had been made willing to acknowledge David to be their lawful King, and to follow his fortune.</P>
<P>Altho' Abner did not live to finish his great de∣sign of establishing the kingdom in the hands of David; yet, the foundation was laid so strong, that the ever▪ took place after his decease. The impression made on their minds by this influen∣tial man, continued to direct the conduct of Israel after his death; and the happy effect of his exer∣tions, were experienced by the King, when Abner was no more.</P>
<P>These were no doubt among the considerations which gave rise to the mourning recorded in the text and context.</P>
<P>Whatever services this man had rendered the King, and whatever he might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ect from his fu∣ture exertions, his hopes were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> off by his death.</P>
<P>The King wept at his grave, he lamented his fall, and, to do justice to his memory, pronounced him "a great man."</P>
<P>Mourning is decent and proper, when not indul∣ged to excess. It is no mark of a weak mind, it betrays no want of religion. On the other hand,
<PB N="10" REF="038307_0008_10119E49452EC070"/>
it discovers a sense of the dignity of human nature, and the dishonor done to man in the grave.</P>
<P>Mourning is a tribute due to the memory of the deceased, especially to illustrious characters.</P>
<P>It is proper to keep in mind their amiable virtues—to call into view the shining traits in their cha∣racters, and to make mention of their worthy deeds. This is doing them justice, it is a tribute we owe them. This justice was done to Abner, this tribute was paid to his memory in the words of the text, "a great man is fallen."</P>
<P>That such honor is due to the memory of the dead, seems to be the sense of mankind. It is im∣pressed upon the minds of people of all ranks.</P>
<P>When David lamented the fall of his predeces∣sor, and his son, he did it in terms which expressed whatever was praise-worthy in them. "Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions." "Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other de∣lights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel."</P>
<P>When the good Hezekiah, King of Judah, kept with his fathers, it is said, that "they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchers of the sons of Da∣vid; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusa∣lem did him honor at his death." They gave him an honorable burial, and lamented his fall with to∣kens of grief for the loss of so good a King.</P>
<P>Death in any form, causes mourning. Whoever
<PB N="11" REF="038307_0009_10119E4AD0078FB8"/>
the victim may be, it spreads a gloom upon the countenances of beholders.</P>
<P>We are not totally indifferent to the fall of any of our fellow creatures. Tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nconnected by the ties of blood or kindred, or the bonds of society, their death makes a melancholly impression.</P>
<P>Death is a standing token of the divine displea∣sure at man's apostacy, and every instance of it pro∣duces melancholly reflections in survivors.</P>
<P>This dreadful penalty, with which the divine law was sanctioned, is inflicted upon every age and de∣scription of man; the innocent babe of a day old, not excepted.</P>
<P>Death has laid his arrest upon the young and old, the prince and peasant, the honorable and ig∣noble: judges and rulers of the earth have undis∣tinguishingly fallen a prey to the King of terrors. These are sad reflections. Instances of this nature cannot fail to create a degree of sorrow in the thinking part of mankind.</P>
<P>How natural it is to lament over a fallen fellow creature in a language similar <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that of the old prophet of Samaria. "Alas! my brother," friend, fellow citizen or benefactor.</P>
<P>Not only do the common ties of humanity call us to mourn over the dead; but a man's charac∣ter, his exalted station in life, his distinguished a∣bilities and extensive benevolence, one considera∣tion which make his death to be universally la∣mented.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="038307_0010_10119E4E28A53A48"/>
When a man in a public station dies, his abili∣ties, however great, of whatever utility and impor∣tance they were, are forever lost to his fellow citi∣zens, to his country and to the world. All expec∣tations from his future exertions for the good of his fellow men are cut off. His opportunities to serve his friends and his country, are at an end.</P>
<P>When a great and good man in a station of emi∣nence falls the victim of death, his country feels the loss it sensibly effects the people at large, a whole nation (the sons of Belial excepted) is troubled at his death, men of all ranks and every station, feel the public loss, and mourn, alas! our brother, our friend, our public father or illustrious chief.</P>
<P>When Abner died, he was not only lamented by the King; but all the servants of David and the inhabitants of Judea wept: all felt the loss of so great a man. It is moreover said, that all the Is∣raelites were troubled at his death, which is a cir∣cumstance shewing, that he was a man greatly be∣loved.</P>
<P>The talents and virtues of great men are of al∣most infinite importance to every State or King∣dom. Where th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se are not united in public lead∣ing characters, government will grow corrupt and feeble, confusion and distress will triumph. If dis∣tinguished abilities and extensive benevolence in public characters are not essential to the being of a nation; yet are they necessary to the well being of every community, great or small.</P>
<P>"Wo to thee O land, when thy King is a child" said Solomon. And wo to the state or nation
<PB N="13" REF="038307_0011_10119E5000254310"/>
whose rulers and heads of departments are men of puerile characters, destitute of those talents which form the able statesman. Confusion and every evil may be expected.</P>
<P>On the other hand, happy is the nation whose leading characters possess that assemblage of virtues and talents, which qualifies them for governing the state, who have wisdom to discern what is for the good of their country, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to employ means for its welfare.</P>
<P>When men of distinguished abilities and virtuous integrity fill the Departments of State, the people experience the happy effects of their wise adminis∣tration.</P>
<P>Such characters are among the greatest national blessings, whether they are placed in the cabinet or the field. Such superior talents directed by a vir∣tuous patriotism, and the influence of such men ex∣erted for the good of their country, produce the most pleasing and happy effects. Therefore, when a man of this description dies, the people mourn. The words of the text may be applied, "a great man is fallen."</P>
<P>The death of great men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> like a frown of Heaven upon a people. As <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing up of able men to direct the civil or military affairs of a State is the doing of the Lord, and indicates his favorable regard to a people; so, their removal by death, seems to be a token of the divine displea∣sure, and shews that he has a controversy with that people. It therefore behoves a nation thus bereav∣ed to mourn, and enquire with penitent hearts wherefore the Lord contendeth with them.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="038307_0012_10119E54E97484B0"/>
One man, in whom a discerning mind, sound judgment, virtuous integrity, extensive influence and a generous patriotism are united and attached to a public station, is a great support to govern∣ment, yea, he is one of the main props and pillars of the State; the good produced by his exertions is incalculable. Though the death of such a man may not be an irreparable loss, yet, it is a very great one. By his fall, the nation is bereaved of an able statesman, government is deprived of a great support: the people of a steady friend and the state of a generous Benefactor. The cabinet is deprived of a wise Counsellor, or the Army of an able General, and the world of a valuable Citizen. One man of superior talents and distinguished vir∣tues in the chair of State, is of more importance than many private persons. So thought the ser∣vants of David, when they said to him as they were going out to battle against the rebellious Absalom, "thou art worth ten thousand of us." And when "they sware to him saying thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the light of Israel." As if the name and memory of Israel must die with their King.</P>
<P>Where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a rare assemblage of virtues and ta∣lents, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> are happily united in one man, his life is of inestimable worth to the nation: his death must therefore be deeply regret∣ted. Such my friends and fellow citizens, is the regret we feel this day. Great were the talents, distinguishing the virtues of the man whose death we bewail. By the late fall of a great and good man in these United States, our country is bereav∣ed of a father, a valuable friend, an able statesman,
<PB N="15" REF="038307_0013_10119E5673E2E1F8"/>
and an accomplished general. Yea, mankind have lost a friend, and the world a beloved citizen.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON, the father of his country, the zealous defender of its rights and liberties is no more! the man of the people, "the delight of man∣kind" is dead! the dignified patriot, the able statesman, the greatest general the world could ever boast of, is fallen! the man whose character does honor to human nature is gone from us to seek a repose in the grave, from the toils of this mortal life. Could the words of the text ever be applied with more propriety than they are to that illus∣trious personage? an honorable person and a great man is fallen in our Israel.</P>
<P>All the manly and amiable virtues which beau∣tify the character and exalt the nature of man, seem to have united themselves in WASHING∣TON, to make him the greatest of men. He had a capacious mind; was a person of sound judg∣ment, deep penetration and quick discernment. He was decided in his measures and conduct, inde∣fatigable in accomplishing what he undertook, and was equal to the most important enterprises, civil or military—he was a man of superior abilities, and extensive influence. His mann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> were gentle, his deportment amiable, and his address engaging, steady and even in his temper, cool and collected in the most trying scenes of difficulty and danger. In war he was terrible to the invaders of his coun∣try's rights: but was generous to his foes; hu∣mane to those whom the fortune of war threw into his hands, "the enemies themselves being
<PB N="16" REF="038307_0014_10119E592903EC78"/>
judges." In peace and war he was an unwavering friend to the rights of hospitality: he held them to be sacred, he invaded them not, nor suffered them to be infringed within the circle of his in∣fluence. He was the inflexible patriot; he loved his country sincerely, and was the friend of man∣kind.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON the great, had a good heart, and was attached to revealed religion.—His name stands recorded among the professors of christian∣ity. He was not ashamed to confess Christ and own himself to be a disciple of the crucified Jesus of Na∣zareth. As he professed, so he exemplified reli∣gion. He visited the assemblies of God's professing people, and joined with the worshippers of Jeho∣vah in their religious devotions. This I view as the most distinguishing trait in his character—and that which reflects peculiar honor upon the man, in whatever capacity we view him.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON was truly the great man in the circle of domestic life; he was great in a poli∣tical view, and great in a military capacity. His great and amiable virtues were carried into every station where God and his country placed him. His superior talents and great abilities were con∣stantly employed for the good of his fellow citi∣zens in every public station he filled. His almost unbounded influence was invariably directed by a sincere love to his country—pleasing and happy were the effects produced by his benevolent exer∣tions.</P>
<P>Designed by the Great Disposer of events to be an instrument of good to his country, he was in∣troduced
<PB N="17" REF="038307_0015_10119E5CF932DA50"/>
to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sy active scenes, and even to the hardy deeds of war, at an early stage of life.—Employed in his youth against an enemy, invading the frontiers of the ancient dominion of Virginia, he conducted the enterprise with that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and dispatch, which have characterised the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in every stage of his important life, to its close.—His conduct in all that he undertook, held him to view as a man of active genius, and promising talents.</P>
<P>When the drama of a revolutionary war, which gave liberty and independence to more than three millions of people, was opened on the plains of Lexington: WASHINGTON, as the most suitable person among the thousands of America, was ap∣pointed commander in chief to direct the operations of war. With a diffidence which argued the great∣ness of his mind, he accepted the important trust. Refusing every pecuniary reward for his services as General of the American Armies, he put on the harness, he grasp'd the sword and hastened to the seat of war. The cordial benedictions and fervent prayers of thousands in our Israel for his safety and success, followed him to the camp.</P>
<P>His conduct in the exalted rank of General of the army, through the fatigues, difficulties, and dangers of an eight years war, was such as would have done honor to the most experienced General in the world. When that great man appeared at the head of our army, the eyes of America, and even of Europe were upon him. Thousands were tortured with anxiety for the event—the breast of our country was big with expectation. He more than answered the hopes of the most sanguine—His conduct was
<PB N="18" REF="038307_0016_10119E5F687ECE58"/>
viewed with applause and admiration—He acquired those honors in the field, which will never be ob∣literated from the memory of his country—He ren∣der<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> those important, essential services, which, I hope▪ will be gratefully remembered by millions, now unborn.</P>
<P>Through the whole scene of that unhappy contest WASHINGTON remained the calm, but inflexible Patriot; the intrepid, humane General.</P>
<P>The war was at length conducted to a close; long wished for peace returned to bless our land.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON disbanded his army, resigned his command, and quietly retired to the private walks of domestic life, to enjoy there the sweets of conscious integrity, and the self approving reflec∣tions of an untainted mind.</P>
<P>When the Federal Constitution was to be organ∣ized, WASHINGTON was elected President of the United States by the unanimous suffrages of his fel∣low citizens. Eight years he filled the chair of state with peculiar dignity, and administered the Constitution with a fidelity which gave satisfaction to every enlightened virtuous patriot in the United States. His sublime virtues and exalted talents, shone with equal lustre in the cabinet as in the field.</P>
<P>By the firm, decided conduct of this great man, order was maintained through the union. The efforts of a factious few, to mislead the public mind, create disturbances in the State, and involve the nation in the horrors of an European war, were happily counteracted.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="038307_0017_10119E62020ACBF0"/>
A dangerous insurrection raised in the bowels of the State by the intrigues of an insidious foreigner, was crushed in the beginning. The hostile natives of the desert were compelled to an honorable peace, and some unhappy differences existing between the American Republic, and the Kingdom of Great Britain, were amicably adjusted.</P>
<P>Having piloted the national bark through every storm into safe port, he resigned the Chair of State, and returned to those peaceful scenes of domestic retirement, which he had reluctantly quitted in obedience to his country's call.</P>
<P>But his usefulness did not end here, one illustrious action more, remained to be added to the long list which had characterised the man from early life. At the call of God and his country, he consented to jeopard his life again in the high places of the field. He accepted a military appointment to the com∣mand of the army to be raised in the United States, for their defence against any sudden invasion by the armies of France.</P>
<P>When France, instigated by a boundless ambition and insatiable avarice, wantonly ravaged our coast, and gave American property to indiscriminate plun∣der; WASHINGTON rose indignant at the unpro∣voked insults; he saw, he felt the wrongs; wrongs done to his country by a treacherous foe, who had long been concealed under the mask of friendship. He heard his country's call, and stood ready to lead her chosen sons to the field of battle, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with his aged bosom open to meet the tempest of war.</P>
<P>The appointment he accepted, was from his suc∣cessor
<PB N="20" REF="038307_0018_10119E646BF55F48"/>
in the office of Chief Magistrate! it was a demonstration of a great and noble mind! it reflects a distinguishing lustre upon the life of that great man.</P>
<P>The name of WASHINGTON, General of the Armies of the United States, inspired the sons of freedom with a lively animation—and the veteran soldier with an impetuous ardor.</P>
<P>While government was making preparation for the defence of the country, by raising and officering an army, to be arranged and commanded by the greatest General in the world; every mind was filled with expectation, and all were waiting the events which God and time would bring forth;—Death, whose ravages are indiscriminate, laid his arrests upon our beloved Hero; General WASH∣INGTON died. His great abilities, sublime virtues and goodness of heart, could not exempt him from death, the common lot of humanity. He died as a man! as a common mortal! but he died as a good man; he left the world in peace. In the full exer∣cise of his reason, and under strong apprehensions of the time of his departure being come, he was calm, and entered the valley of the shadow of death, with a serenity of mind, which seems to be peculiar to those who have Heaven and the joys of the divine presence in the prospect before them. We hope he is now enjoying the rewards of a well spent life, that his death is infinite gain to him. But our loss is very great.</P>
<P>Though "the weapons of war, I trust, are not perished," yet, true it is, "that the mighty is fallen." A man is fallen the victim of death whose
<PB N="21" REF="038307_0019_10119E6811E09D48"/>
abilities, influence and exertions were much want∣ed at this juncture.</P>
<P>What shall we say? that "the beauty of America is fallen? that the light of our Israel is quenched?" Let us hope and pray that a double portion of the spirit of WASHINGTON may rest on his successors.</P>
<P>Lament for him we must; he was "lovely and pleasant in his life," he was our friend, he was the friend of our country and of mankind.</P>
<P>Weep over WASHINGTON, a man greatly be∣loved, he jeoparded his life in the high places of the field, in defence of our invaded rights, and was an instrument in the hand of providence of our deli∣verence from the barbarous claims of despotism, and the mean of our enjoying the sweets of liberty.</P>
<P>Americans, lament for your deceased General, who was the scourge of your country's foes. Be-wail the man, who, with the sword of magistracy, was a terror to evil doers, and a praise to them who did well.</P>
<P>Let all lament for the man who successfully fought our battles, and under the auspice of the God of armies gave to us the dear earned liberties we now enjoy. Weep for the man who guided the helm of State with unrivalled dignity—who ad∣ministered the Constitution of our country with undeviating justice and integrity.</P>
<P>Daughters of America, "weep over WASHING∣TON," who traversed the field of danger in your defence—who submitted to the fatigues of a military

life, and encountered the dubious storm of war to protect you, and the objects of your affection from the rapacity of a merciless foe; and who was an instrument in the hands of God, of preserving to you and your dearest connections all the pleasant, delightful things in life.</P>
<P>Lament for him in the language of the Prophet, alas! our father, our friend, the instrument of our political salvation.</P>
<P>But while we all lament with deep regret the un∣happy fall of that great and good man, let us offer united praises to the God of our fathers for his gift of Washington to our country, and for his continuing a life of so much importance to these States so long; and let us gratefully remember the many and signal services rendered us by him.</P>
<P>We may say in the words of the Queen of Sheba to Solomon, "blessed be the Lord our God, who delighted in that man to place him at the head of our armies, and in the chair of State," because the Lord loved us, he gave us WASHINGTON to pre∣side in the field and in the cabinet.</P>
<P>General WASHINGTON was an exemplary man, let us copy his virtues and imitate his example. May Magistrates possess a large share of the temper and spirit conspicuous in him. May those in posts of military honor, and every soldier in the States, catch the "falling mantle" of their ascending leader; imbibe his spirit, and cultivate his virtues; be di∣rected by the same spirit, intrepidity, firmness, temperance and moderation, which embellished his character.</P>

May all live under the influence of that reli∣gion, carry the virtues and graces of it into every station; then, like the deceased father of our country, shall we have confidence at the hour of death—like him shall we feel tranquil, and enjoy serenity of mind, when we know that the time of our dissolution is come.</P>
