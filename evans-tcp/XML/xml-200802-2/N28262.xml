<P>HAD I language at command, and the time and my tears would permit me, to display, in just colors to your view, the great, the pre∣cious, the extensive blessings, of which we in common with our country, so largely participate; I might, by an easy and natural transition, lead you to the contemplation of the character of this greatest and best of men, in the celebration of whose obsequies, we, my afflicted friends, are this day, with one voice, and, I trust, with one heart, and a pious sensibility, engaged.</P>
<P>THE sacred altars of our holy religion, the graceful appendage of mirth, in seasons of festivi∣ty and joy, and the only solid support and conso∣lation, in a day of tribulation and gloom, like the present, are neither removed, nor defiled with

unhallowed hands; our rulers are from ourselves, and the men of our choice; we sit under our own vine and fig-tree, without molestation or fear; the solacing endearments of domestic soci∣ety, and the pleasures of the broader and more ex∣panded circles of social intercourse, are undisturb∣ed; the hard-earned fruit of the husbandman's toil is not snatched from his hand, by the ruth∣less grasp of violence; the useful artisan finds in his labor, a reward for his ingenuity and indus∣try; in his returns the merchant admits a compen∣sation for his sagacity and enterprize—our eyes are, every where, delighted with the swelling can∣vas, the busy street, the bending harvest, and the cattle upon a thousand hills: of this assemblage of public and private happiness, how large a por∣tion shall we ascribe to the virtues, the talents, and the unexampled patriotism of this favorite in∣strument of indulgent Heaven?</P>
<P>At an important epocha of our history, when our country was threatened with the deprivation, of its invaluable rights, of every thing dear to en∣lightened freemen; when, in the infancy of our national existence, we were called, in Providence, to contend with a power grown grey in the field of Mars; when our infantine stature and armour ex∣cited the ridicule and contempt, with which the

fling of David was viewed by his renowned and boasting antagonist; in this defenceless and almost hopeless condition, how did we cling to the buck∣ler of our mighty Chieftain? his name was in∣deed then, as it has often since been emphatic∣ally stiled, <HI>a Host;</HI> in him our imbecility and all our wants were forgotten, or disregarded, or more than supplied by the confidence which he inspir∣ed; on him expectation reposed, as if he had been, as was Cyrus, expressly named, in prophe∣cy, the shepherd of Israel and the Lord's anointed— the progress and vicissitudes of an arduous strug∣gle, through eight long campaigns, unfolded the rich treasures and ample resources of his capa∣cious mind; in the profound discernment, the consummate prudence, the unremitting persever∣ance and undaunted fortitude of our American <HI>Fabius,</HI> the Sage and the Hero were equally con∣spicuous; it was reserved to his exit, in the last scene of the drama, to astonish and instruct an ad∣miring world, with the magnanimity of the <HI>man:</HI> that power which intoxicates ordinary minds, when it ceased to be useful to his country, retain∣ed no charms in his esteem; having finished the task assigned him, he exultingly resigned his high command to the hand which gave it, and surpassing all his former glory, and rising above himself, he became once more the <HI>citizen.</HI> Who was conver∣sant

with that charming transaction, and did not follow, with a thousand blessings, this revered man to the delightful shades of his long wished for retreat? in these blissful abodes, the venera∣ble seat of his ancestors, he enjoyed a compensa∣tion for all his toils, in the possession of a con∣scious integrity, and the gratifying reflections on his devotion to the public good. Here he fondly hoped to spend the rest of his days, in tranquili∣ty and usefulness, dividing by a just distribution, and a wise economy, his precious time and plen∣tiful income, to the claims of justice and charity, hospitality and religion.</P>
<P>Alas! how short is human bliss, how transitory all sublunary enjoyments! hardly was it realized that we had no more a foe without, when a state of things was perceived within, more dreadful than war itself; the band of our union was so nearly dis∣solved, that an attempt to draw it closer, would have served but to betray its weakness—jealously and distrust, the deadly bane of government, had poi∣soned our political atmosphere—a dark cloud a∣rising over our heads, portended a direful explo∣sion—countenances gathered paleness—fightings without could have given a kind relief to more a∣larming fears within—to advance or recede, or be stationary, appeared almost equally presumptu∣ous—between

dejection and despair there remain∣ed but a single step—when the voice of millions, united as the voice of one man, called to the fa∣ther of his country—to hear the voice of his country in distress, was to obey—love, ardent and disinterested as his, left him no choice—the de∣lights of Mount-Vernon, whose every circum∣stance conspired to content its beloved tenant, where the only strife was emulation to please— even this paradise lost its enchantment—behold the darling of the people once more on the stage of public action—every heart expanded, every face brightened at the spectacle—the dignity pe∣culiar to himself, with which this prodigy of vir∣tues and graces filled the Chair of State—the wis∣dom and purity of his administration—his second triumphant return to the walks of private life— his entire possession of himself on the near ap∣proach of death—these are themes on which I for∣bear to dilate—of these your thoughts must be full. That the spirit of divine wisdom directed the paths of this truly great man, the undevi∣ating rectitude and uniform tenor of his life pro∣nounce, in a stile, that cannot deceive—to this evidence other proofs might be adduced, that in all his ways he acknowledged God—and must, then, so much goodness, as well as greatness, be

prostrated in the dust? you answer, he is gone to receive the reward of the servant who had faith∣fully improved many talents—that a part of his blissful employment may be the guardianship of a country he so dearly loved. Dear man! could the love of a whole nation have prevented, the shaft of death had never reached you—but he is gone!—for the loss of so much virtue it is virtu∣ous to weep—forbid not, my friends, your hearts to swell—your tears to flow—my voice is too fee∣ble to express his praise.</P>

<P>IN obedience to those feelings which are ever excited in the human heart, at the loss of a friend, a benefactor and a father; we are now as∣sembled, to pay our last public tribute of affection and veneration, to the memory of our beloved WASHINGTON. And I doubt not, but upon this occasion, we shall give free indulgence, to that voluntary sympathy, which is so rapidly spread∣ing, from heart to heart, throughout the continent of America, and will as soon as the sad tidings reach the trans-atlantic shores, wrap even Europe in a sable mantle. For when virtue expires, na∣ture receives a shock, and the plaintive moan is echoed through the world! I apprehend how∣ever, fellow citizens, that it will not be expected
<PB N="10" REF="037666_0010_100F35F233815D20"/>
from me, that I attempt to pourtray the charac∣ter of our virtuous chief; for that task is too im∣portant, and sublime for me to undertake. Let it therefore suffice, if I make a few remarks, on the propriety of the solemn pomp now before us; and point out a few of those general traits, in the character of our venerable deceased, which seem∣ed to raise him aloof from his fellow men, and shed an unknown dignity and lustre on the hu∣man race.</P>
<P>IN touching on the character of the deceased, I shall confine myself merely to a comparative view of him, with others who have been emi∣nently distinguished in the world. And altho' I should be unwilling to tarnish the glory of any man, which has been fairly and honourably ac∣quired; whether he be living in history only, or is now active on the stage of life; yet I deem it no robbery or diminution of their glory, to say they all fade in the comparison. All other great characters of which we have any knowledge, have been distinguished for some one, extraordinary talent or virtue, which has given them celebrity and fame, when compared with common men. Of this class history, and many living characters, afford us numerous examples, and at the loss of
<PB N="11" REF="037666_0011_100F35F6875F8ED8"/>
these ornaments of society there will ever be a partial mourning, for they are valuable and im∣portant in society—perhaps a nation may deplore the loss of a great general, counsellor or judge: science may lose an able supporter, and a liberal patron: religion may lament the loss of a pious and a virtuous man, nay a doctor deep skilled in the science of theology: or even the humble walks of life, may lose a kind friend and bounti∣ful benefactor: yet the grief in all these instances is limited, for their talents and their virtues are circumscribed.</P>
<P>BUT never until the time of WASHINGTON, has a character appeared so richly adorned, with all the great and noble virtues of which humanity is susceptible. He is not like other heroes, sages or patriots, whose names are enrolled in the book of fame; for no history can polish his glory, and even malign censure, dare not pluck a sprig from his well earned laurels. Heaven seemed to have formed the man WASHINGTON, out of its choicest materials, and robbed, as it were, humanity of its virtues to form one perfect man. Being thus en∣dowed with superlative virtues and talents, he was introduced, on the stage of life, and assigned a part in a scene which had never before been acted
<PB N="12" REF="037666_0012_100F35F8CC129F38"/>
in the the nations of the earth. Passing over the earlier parts of his life, let us view him at that important crisis, when he managed the sublime and happy conflict between an infant, weak and inexperienced nation, and a haughty, imperious and overbearing kingdom! Armed with that panoply, which Jehovah had made for him, bold in the cause of justice, and secure in the smiles of his God, like David, though a stripling in the arts of war, he baffled the Goliahs of Great Britain, and led in triumph her armies, at his chariot wheels. Even amidst the dangers which for seven bloody years, marred the peace and felicity of the American people; behold the virtuous chieftain conducting the infant America, through perils and dangers before unknown. And through all this struggle which gave birth to America, self-composed and collected, his active and pervading mind, could, even in the greatest difficulties resort to avenues of prudence and safety. Even at that awful moment when Providence seemed to have withdrawn his protecting hand! at that dark hour, when despair had seized the American bosom; when the eagle of our country drooped its extended wings in token of grief! Say ye pa∣triots, who had the honor of fighting under his banners, did his dignity lessen? did his valour and wisdom appear less active and sublime, than
<PB N="13" REF="037666_0013_100F35FA5AF62538"/>
when success danced on his helmet, and glistened on his sword? Your answer is no—for with a fortitude and equanimity, peculiar to himself, he met danger undismayed, and soared above the ad∣versities of life—Nay more, that firmness, temper∣ance and majesty, which uniformly distinguished him, became more conspicuous in the hour of dif∣culty and distress. Nor was this mighty man like other great men, elated with success; but his keen mind, reviewing the past and foreseeing the future, made him calm and tranquil, even in his glory; and ever displayed such a dignified majesty as assimu∣lated him more to the gods, than mortal man. Thus by his wisdom, having protected the infan∣cy of his country, and supported her by his single arm; having trained up a numerous host of hardy and well disciplined soldiers to be her future bul∣wark, and ratified the birth and independence of his country; behold the resplendent virtues, at∣tend him to the mild and peaceful walks of pri∣vate life! And here let me ask, where is the man, WASHINGTON excepted, who with the same opportunities, would not have derived some per∣sonal advantages to himself? who would not have acquired wealth? or perhaps by force of those armies which at the close of the last war, were devoted to his name and person, would have
<PB N="14" REF="037666_0014_100F24B9332A4FF8"/>
established himself lord paramount of the country he saved? This our hero spurned; having de∣voted himself to the cause of justice, having res∣cued a sinking nation, the great object of his heart being accomplished; he retired to the se∣questered vale of life, to enjoy in common with his fellow citizens, that peace and happiness his valor won. Above the reach of mercenary views, beyond the power of adulation, behold him gently settling on Mount Vernon, like Noah's ark on the mountain of Arrarat, a sure presage that the storm was o'er.</P>
<P>TOO important however to remain long a private citizen, see him again step forth, at the voice of his country to conduct the august councils of our nation. See with what alacrity, he again aban∣doned the gentle pleasures of domestic life, to make that people virtuous and happy, whom his valor had made independent.—Was it glory that again induced him to come forth and guide the devious mazes of our national councils? Surely not, or the experiment was hazardous and uncer∣tain, and his laurels were yet blooming with their freshest verdure—Was it the desire of wealth, which prompted him to obey the second call of his country? No; for he had uniformly declined
<PB N="15" REF="037666_0015_100F35FE12315558" MS="y"/>
accepting any compensation—But it was that same virtue, which at first made him risque his life in the cause of freedom and justice, which influenced him to accept the chair of state, and conduct his beloved nation to happiness and honor—and when he had firmly established a government, which was calculated to ensure and perpetuate national felicity; having given the first example that true liberty is compatible with government and law, he again with redoubled lustre retired from public cares; having left a benizon to that people, whom he had fostered in infancy, and instructed in manhood. And here it would seem that his public career must end—and it would my friends, had not this godlike man, even in the wane of life, at a period, when by the common laws of nature, ambition slumbers, and happiness is ultimately blended, with quietude and ease, at the remote appearance of hostilities, to the coun∣try he loved, once more stepped forth, and grasped the sword of his earlier days to inspire millions and deter the foe. Here then behold a climax of glory, honor and reputation, which the deeds of four thousand years, has never equalled! At last perfectly composed, and prepared for the event, he is translated in a moment, from this
<PB N="16" REF="037666_0016_100F3601EB81B200"/>
earth, to the bosom of his God, ready to give a full account of those talents committed to his charge, and receive the meed of a well spent life, accompanied, with well done thou good and faith∣ful servant.</P>
<P>YES, fellow citizens he is no more! His body now slumbers in the dark chambers of death! his shield is broken! his sword fallen from that once nervous arm! That voice which once commanded the listening attention of the senate, is silent! yet his name stands written at full length in the volume of fame, and will continue so long as na∣ture endures, the first of heroes, patriots, sages! and his virtues still live, and will ever continue to live, in the memory of an affectionate and grateful people.</P>
<P>HOW becoming is it then in us, to pay all due honors to his memory—we all <HI>feel</HI> as though we had <HI>seen</HI> him—we know him as our earthly father; esteemed him as our friend, and revered him as our protector—we were of his family—for he re∣cognized us as his children; and nothing but un∣bounded parental affection, could have induced him to have undergone the fatigues and dangers which he did, to promote our happiness and secure our
<PB N="17" REF="037666_0017_100F360380AF6270"/>
safety. The emblems of grief, which are now exhib∣ited before us; the deep toned thunder of cannon which are now proclaiming the sad tidings! The drooping standards, which once waved in triumph round his head—the solemn procession, which is the last kind office we can afford the dead! All, ought to inspire us with manly sorrow, and im∣press our hearts with grief; for while the United States are sympathising in sorrow, at the general loss, were we to refrain, would be paying an ill compliment to our own virtue, humanity and gratitude.</P>
<P>BUT, my countrymen let us not despair—for altho' WASHINGTON is visibly departed from us; yet his spirit, shall hover over the city which bears his immortal name, and henceforth be the Guardian Genius of these United States! And may it ever inspire future patriots with the same virtue, in∣tegrity, and honor, which so eminently character∣ised his whole life.</P>
