<Q>BOTH RICHES AND HONOUR COME OF THEE, AND THOU REIGNEST OVER ALL; AND IN THINE HAND IS POWER AND MIGHT; AND IN THINE HAND IT IS TO MAKE GREAT, AND TO GIVE STRENGTH UNTO ALL.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE GREAT AND BELOVED MAN IS DEAD! <HI>The light of America is extinguished:</HI> and all the enlightened friends of merit are the subjects of deep affliction. For though the Saviour of his country "Died in a good old age, full of riches and honour," yet, at this dreadful period, when the world trembles before the horrid ravages of the combined powers of darkness, the loss of WASHINGTON, that able statesman and unrivalled General, is like the de∣parture of the sun in his zenith, and matter of great la∣mentation. Resignedly, therefore, to mourn the event be∣fore God, "who killeth and maketh alive," and pay our tribute of respect to the memory of him whose same has filled the world and will forever grace the most instructive page of history, is the present duty of every class and de∣scription of men.</P>
<P>To aid a devout and correspondent course of exercises and reflections, at this solemn season, by illustrating THE DI∣VINE INFLUENCE IN HUMAN GREATNESS, shall be the employment of the subsequent discourse.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="038547_0005_1012553EC4FD67A0"/>
THE text and the occasion we trust obviously meet, and readily harmonize. For, if the Divine Being is the author of Human Greatness, we ought gratefully to acknow∣ledge it, and submissively hold our peace before the dark dispensation of providence. Those, who are qualified to bless God for raising up Great Men, are equally qualified to adore his name when they are removed. For Christian gratitude and resignation are inseparably connected, during our probationary state.</P>
<P>THAT, God is the author of Human Greatness, it is manifest, because men as well as worms of the earth, and even the angels of light are creatures, and consequently dependent on the creator. In every possible attitude, mode and state, creatures are absolutely dependent. Longer than the duration of his dependence, no being can remain a creature. It is impossible for the most exalted creatures to survive their dependence: Dependence, absolute depen∣dence on God in all respects, is inseparable from the exist∣ence of man. For whether wise or simple they are the workmanship of God. Hence the voice of inspiration: "Both riches and honour come of thee; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all. For promotion cometh neither from the east nor from the west nor from the south; But God is Judge, he putteth down one and setteth up another. The Lord changeth the times and seasons; he removeth kings and setteth up kings; he giveth wisdom to the wise and understanding to those that know understand∣ing.
<PB N="7" REF="038547_0006_1012554133CB7DB0"/>
The heart of the king is in the hand of the Lord and he turneth it whithersoever he pleaseth as the rivers of water are turned." Reason, philosophy and inspiration unitedly conspire to impress the doctrine, that God is the author of Human Greatness. For all men, from the womb to the grave, are wholly dependent on God through all the vicissitudes of life. "The lot is cast into the lap, but the whole disposing thereof is of the Lord." Independently of the divine agency we "Cannot make one hair white nor black. For in God we live, and move, and have our being, and in him are all our ways. O Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walk∣eth to direct his steps." This is a general view of the sub∣ject; but justice, on this great occasion, requires a more particular consideration.</P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> GOD is the author of Human Greatness, by fur∣nishing those who are ordained to move in the most elevated spheres of action with an answerable source of genius. The foundation of human greatness is laid by the Creator in that depth of genius, which is not the common lot of the gene∣ral mass of man. The genius of Cyrus, Newton and oth∣ers, whose fame will keep pace with time, is imparted by the forming hand of God to those whose destination requires it: and, so necessary is a rich source of genius to attain hu∣man greatness, that no man destitute of it can excel. Com∣mon abilities, by diligent and painful application, will make a reputable figure by the side of great men; but cannot ascend the summit of human greatness. Glimmering stars
<PB N="8" REF="038547_0007_10125542D35D9888"/>
never shine like the sun. Men, whose genius is calculated to conduct them safely amid the luminaries of heaven, with great facility reach that height of science, which others cannot by the most unwearied industry, during the com∣pass of human life. All great men command great abil∣ities; and the greatest manifestly command the best abil∣ities. Genius is the peculiar foundation on which celebra∣ted characters have raised their astonishing superstructures. This being manifest, it is also equally manifest that God is the author of human greatness by the profuse donation of genius. For who has made the difference between the simple man and the great Philosopher? Who, says the sim∣ple cottager to the man of science, made thy abilities? and who made mine? Has not the skilful and sovereign hand of the creator made the wide difference between us? Let me, then be humble and contented: and be thou thank∣ful and understanding. For of those, to whom much is given, much will be required. Great men in this world ought to be great in the next. This leads us to add,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> THE agency of God is directly concerned in human greatness by amply furnishing the favoured sons of genius with an answerable education. Unless seasonably cultivated the best natural abilities will not constitute human greatness. Destitute of education, a man possessed of the genius of an angel will never excel. The most costly teints of the east, except displayed by a finished pencil, will not approach the perfection of nature: the finest piece of mar∣ble, except formed and polished by the unerring hand of
<PB N="9" REF="038547_0008_101255454C877D30"/>
the sculptor, will neither exhibit an elegant monument, nor bust: and thus that ponderous mass of genius, which God liberally imparts to some of the human race, will forever remain dormant and comparatively useless, except roused, invigorated and directed by education. How many men of genius are there among the rude Africans? How many among the wild savages of America? How many among the common people of our acquaintance, who, while destitute of generous education, yet discover some of the prime marks of original genius? The flint is full of fire; but some exertion is necessary to display the sparks. Now, we ask, what raised Newton with such celerity from the obscurity of an awkward, ignorant boy to that immortal height amid the spheres? The answer is education. What with such rapidity has distinguished many writers, states∣men and generals from their equals both in point of age and genius? Education. The influence of education makes the difference in a great measure, which is so obvious, between this nation and that, this family and that, and even between this man and the other who, when infants, were nourished together by the same breast. This in a word, other things equal, is the ground of the vast differ∣ence between Legislators and Barbarians, the great Philoso∣pher and the untutored Indian.</P>
<P>THIS point granted, that education claims the merit of making the difference between the rude and in∣formed, the comparatively useless and useful class of men, we ask who is the author of that generous edu∣cation
<PB N="10" REF="038547_0009_10125547EC577890"/>
of which some of the human race are the subjects? Shall the sons of science like the <HI>dark Illuminati</HI> of the age bless the stars, Jupiter or Minerva or Dame Nature or any other vanities of a demoralized heart as the beneficent author of education? The child of modesty will not venture on such daring ground. For, not to name Deity, the public mind, that reveres revelation, is entitled to some respect; and pays no solemn tribute to the Fates. Are, then, the instructors at colleges and schools the exclu∣sive authors of education? Are parents and the commu∣nity the prime source of education? No, my candid audi∣tors, God is the author: and our enlightened country, the instructors of colleges and schools and a thousand other ad∣vantages which we and our children possess are but the in∣struments and means which God improves to expand the minds of men and prepare them for usefulness. God maketh the children of men both wise and great. He furnishes families, schools and colleges with the means of instruction, and by countless measures which en∣tirely escape our notice brings forward the children, the youth and the men whom he has ordained for lamps and pillars of the church and state. His attention to the education of those intended for human greatness is marked with the infinitude of his love. The playful child at school little thinks of the high decree of heaven respecting his future sphere of action. Cyrus was chosen, named and gird∣ed by the Lord to dry up the river Euphrates, to open the two leaved gates, to break in pieces the gates of brass, to cut in sunder the bars of iron and to destroy the pride of Babylon. He was therefore educated in the school of
<PB N="11" REF="038547_0010_1012554B3303FB78"/>
arms both in Persia under the direction of Cambyses and in Media under the direction of Astyages. Daniel was or∣dained to bless the afflicted, captivated church in a strange land and was accordingly favoured with a princely educa∣tion in the royal college. Paul was brought up at the feet of Gamaliel that he might be qualified to stand before the potentates of the earth and publish the resurrection and the glad tidings of salvation. Luther, Calvin and several others were registered in heaven to introduce the reforma∣tion, and were therefore furnished with answerable informa∣tion, zeal and fortitude. Their minds, nerves and hearts were formed to face the opposition and intrigue of Charles the fifth and Francis the first, and to confound the bishops, legates, cardinals and father of Rome. To shake the foundation of the papal throne, and give his people rest, was the decree of the Almighty, and by his gracious influ∣ence suitable agents were raised up to execute his purpose. It is the Lord who maketh great and giveth strength unto all. He forms the minds of men for the interesting parts they have to act upon the great theatre of life, and blessed be his glorious name. For his wisdom, power and good∣ness are infinite. To illustrate the divine influence in hu∣man greatness, let me observe</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> That God not only furnishes men with ge∣nius and education, but with ample opportunity to exert and improve their abilities. Joseph, when a blooming youth, was advertised of his future greatness by several dreams. But not comprehending his visions, he like a
<PB N="12" REF="038547_0011_1012554CD100C880"/>
child, in the simplicity of his heart disclosed them to the family. This, as his suspicious brethren construed his dreams in connexion with the splendid coat and the partial fondness of old Jacob, was the occasion of their hating him with all the heart. They, therefore, after a fixed intention to terminate his days, the execution of which was seasona∣bly prevented, in the most unbrotherly and inhuman manner, sold him to a company of merciless strangers, who greedily made merchandise of him in Egypt. Thus the rigid hand of adversity followed the unhappy youth, without inter∣mission, till he was cast into prison. The history is too af∣fecting for persons of humanity to pursue, except they an∣ticipate the event. But, why must the lovely youth be stolen from the dear embraces of his aged father by unnat∣ural brethren, and plunged into the lasting furnace of af∣fliction? The answer is obvious; that he might supply a starving world with bread, and justify the ways of God to man. While we, therefore, grieve for the affliction of Jo∣seph, we cannot but rejoice in the view of his superior great∣ness and excellency. To ease the insupportable burden of his trembling and afflicted brothers, he therefore wisely with∣out exculpating the guilty, says "For God did send me before you to preserve life." By the peculiar afflictions and trials, which he long experienced, the Lord made him great. Like Christ, his great antitype, he was made perfect through suffering.</P>
<P>To emancipate the oppressed Hebrews from the rigour of Pharaoh, Moses the servant of God was born with a great
<PB N="13" REF="038547_0012_1012554F49C25638"/>
mind, and educated in a princely style at the court of Egypt. The ever watchful eye of heaven was upon him from the moment he escaped the bloody hand of the executioner, by being concealed among the flags till his education was compleated: For he was the goodly child whose face dis∣played the peculiar features of future greatness. As soon, therefore, as the period arrived for him to discover his abili∣ties by the most noble exertions, God led him into the school of affliction. In circumstances of adversity Moses began to exhibit his talents and unfold the great design of heaven respecting his future dignity. When he termina∣ted the strife between the Hebrew and the Egyptian; when he returned from the burning, emblematic bush to authenticate his divine legation before Egypt's proud and inflexible king; when amid the plagues and horrors of the land he chose the affliction of God's people rather than all the honours and emoluments of the world; when he led the reluctant, complaining nation of Israel to the fright∣ful margin of the dividing sea; when we behold the man executing his part of the great deliverance, we are dazzled with the splendour of his greatness: For he shines brightest in the furnace of affliction. He became great by the difficulties he removed, by the obstacles he sur∣mounted and by the trials he endured. He was destined by God to dispel the night, and rise and shine like the opening day. In honour, therefore, to the memory of the righteous, which is precious, when he had finished his course, the Lord said to Joshua, his prime minister: "Mo∣ses my servant is dead." The Eulogy is short but divine∣ly
<PB N="14" REF="038547_0013_10125552C8461E48"/>
sentimental. More would be superfluous and less defi∣cient. Blessed are those who deserve the approbation of God. Joshua, that spotless character also became the great and excellent statesman and general in consequence of being confined by Jehovah to the practical school of war. His peculiar circumstances in the course of events made him the peerless general: For upon him devolved the great work of dispossessing the heathens, and planting Jacob in the promised land.</P>
<P>THE same course of providence put the sword of the Lord into the hand of Gideon, and invested him with hu∣man greatness. While threshing wheat at Ophrah to hide it from the ravaging enemy, he was called by the angel of God to be the deliverer of his nation. He obeyed the com∣mand, he quitted his work, he marched, he accomplished the divine purpose, and is enrolled among the great men whose peculiar embarrassments and afflictions gave them op∣portunity to express their valour and dignity.</P>
<P>DAVID, in this connexion, must not be passed by in silence. For the extensive field of action into which he was called from the simple employment of a shepherd obviously crowned him with human greatness. He was born for the day in which he lived, and his abilities were adequate to the arduous task reserved for him by providence; but as gold is proved and purified by fire; so David's superior greatness was displayed in consequence of the pe∣culiar dangers and evils which he experienced. Though
<PB N="15" REF="038547_0014_1012555535FAC960"/>
no merit can be imputed to his enemies, we cannot but re∣mark that they, under the direction of providence, were the occasion of his superlative honour both in the field and on the throne.</P>
<P>WE have previously taken notice of the agency of God relative to the education of Daniel▪ whom he formed for the subject of human greatness. But we have equal liber∣ty to observe, in this connexion, that the great dangers and calamities, to which Daniel and his captivated friends were exposed, made them great and distinguished characters. From Babel's den of lions and burning furnace the page of inspiration furnishes the greatest and best of human cha∣racters. For these displays of excellency we are not in∣debted to their enemies, but to the God of heaven.</P>
<P>WE will mention but one instance more. It was the peculiar scene of difficulty, affliction, danger and distress to which the Apostles and primitive christians were subjec∣ted, which gave them opportunity to distinguish themselves so gloriously in favour of the cause of Christ. God gave them abilities and information as their mission required, and in the course of events gave them full opportunity to display their excellency. By the divine agency, in this manner, all great men have been formed; and aside from this course of operation there have been but few great men on earth.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly.</HI> GOD is the author of human greatness, by
<PB N="16" REF="038547_0015_10125556D5915108"/>
directing men to embrace and diligently pursue those em∣ployments which correspond with their abilities. "Nature, says a celebrated author, has thought fit to make a distribu∣tion of her talents among men. She has pitched upon some particular persons, to give them aptitude to perform rightly some things which she has not rendered possible to others. Nature indeed has made an unequal distribution of her blessings among her children; yet she has disinherit∣ted none; and a man divested of all kinds of abilities is as great a phenomenon as an universal genius." These obser∣vations merit attention; but, as no man can be the subject of common information who will not listen to the voice of instruction; so, the greatest genius will not excel, in his proper sphere of action, unless he diligently applies. Noth∣ing short of well directed attention to his own particular employment will make the child of genius a man of emi∣nence. He who attempts every thing will accomplish nothing. It is frequently said that some men are born poets, others, musicians and others, generals. The remark is not groundless. But the import is neither more nor less than this, that they are the subjects of peculiar aptitude of genius for their respective spheres of employment. For we all know that no man will excel in poetry, music or the field of war, who is destitute of diligent application. The all attentive providence of God permits none to excel but the diligent. The diligent hand maketh rich; but drowsiness will clothe a man with rags. In but few in∣stances is the hand of divine agency more conspicuous, than in directing some men whose motives will not bear exam∣ination
<PB N="17" REF="038547_0016_10125559850DCED8"/>
to excel in those arts and sciences which are so ben∣eficial to the world. How many thousands of bold soldiers are there in the bloody field of battle who have no relish for the discipline of Christ? The serious and consoling con∣sideration is this, that whether men of genius or simplicity choose or refuse to be influenced by good motives, God will improve them to magnify his great name. "For he hath made all things for himself, yea even the wicked for the day of evil. The wrath of man shall praise the Lord, and the remainder thereof he will restrain."</P>
<P>BUT, the field opened by the subject is too extensive to be farther explored in this discourse. Let us, however, remark in connexion with the preceding observations, that the circumstances and events which concur in the course of providence to constitute a great character, are innumerable. As many things are necessarily effected by God to furnish a piece of bread; so many more are effected to clothe a man with human greatness. Divine agency does not make a great man in a day. God spends more time in making a great general or statesman than was spent in making the worlds. All the events and circumstances connected with the infant, the child, the youth and the man, are under the direction of God in order to constitute human greatness. Hence David, the renowned king of Israel, while contem∣plating the character of God, who formed him, and qual∣ified him for great actions and placed him upon the throne, in this most devout and humble manner celebrates the di∣vine praise: "Both riches and honour come of thee; and
<PB N="18" REF="038547_0017_1012555CCDDC8DB0"/>
thou reignest over all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make great and to give strength unto all. But who am I and what is my father's house."</P>
<P>LET us now improve the subject by several inferences and reflections answerable to the solemnity of the oc∣casion.</P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> WE infer the sovereignty of God in the unequal distribution of natural abilities to the children of men. For the inequality among men, in point of genius, is as obvious as any thing in nature. To some God gives great natural abilities, to others small ones, and to many others genius of the moderate size; and who shall complain of the un∣equal distribution? Has the prince of angels reason to com∣plain, that his mind is not equal to the mind of the creator? Shall Newton complain, that he was not made an angel? Shall the least mind of the human race complain of not be∣ing the greatest? For if all men were generals, the field would be destitute of soldiers; and if all men were angels, the world would be destitute of inhabitants. The infinitude of the divine wisdom and goodness must silence every com∣plaint of the nature. For God knows best what agents to employ, and in what manner to accomplish his glorious pur∣pose by the creation.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> WE infer the sovereignty of God in the un∣equal distribution of the advantages of education. A large proportion of mankind are now in a savage state. Many
<PB N="19" REF="038547_0018_1012555F410CF390"/>
others, in consequence of their situation, are almost desti∣tute of the common means of information. Comparatively, the bible and the rudiments of knowledge are in but few hands at the present day. But while we lament the igno∣rant state of the generality of men, we see some of the race favoured with the peculiar advantages of erudition. Why this striking difference between man and man, one nation and another? For all men are equally dependent. Has God made the great Philosopher and the ignorant savage of the mountains? Has he furnished the one with the wings of a seraph to soar amid the stars and left the other to roam the forest like the leopard? Why this great inequal∣ity amid the offspring of man? For God is as able to make one man the subject of human greatness as another. But the objection is easily invalidated, in the view of every im∣partial and informed mind. For God is light and love; and if variety and contrast were not necessarily connected with the great interest of eternity, neither light, nor dark∣ness, nor land, nor water, nor men, nor angels, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature would exist. But, who will presumptuously assert that creation is destitute of value and will in the final issue of events tarnish the honour of the creator? For God has made angels and men and all other objects, and governs them according to the counsel of his own will to answer the best end. Be silent then, O man, and remember, that the difference between the genius and information of one man and another, is the fruit of in∣finite wisdom and goodness. Shall not God do what he will with his own? Is thine eye evil because God is good?
<PB N="20" REF="038547_0019_10125560DAC4B4F8"/>
Is not the universe the property of God? and who shall teach the proprietor of all things what improvement to make of his possessions? Let us adore the Divine Being and en∣joy the perfection of his administrations. For, while God makes the difference between the mind and information of one man and another, his requirements invariably cor∣respond with the advantages which he confers.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> WE infer the peculiar darkness of the present dispensation of providence. For <HI>Washington,</HI> the corner stone of the American fabric, is removed. The Lord gave him to the nation and the Lord hath taken him away. Had he survived his abilities and usefulness and become a burden to himself and friends, the public mind would be very differently affected by his departure. But, he did not out live himself. For though he almost reached the com∣mon limits of life, yet till death arrived he retained that majesty of mind and vigour of body which he enjoyed in the active period of man. Like the declining sun whose undiminished orb cheers the world at the close of day, so the light of America retained his verticle greatness and splendour, even at the horison of human life. We have therefore, lost the great statesman, the deep counsellor, the unshaken patriot, the matchless general and the man of science whose same has filled the world. While other great captains have blazed like the lightening to destroy, he like the sun shone to protect and preserve. Beloved by his country and revered by her enemies, he led our arms to victory and final conquest without wading through rivers
<PB N="21" REF="038547_0020_1012556351C51E38"/>
of blood: And never, except at the doleful period of the war, when he commanded the discouraged, destitute and bleeding army, whose influence cheered their sinking hearts, was <HI>Washington's</HI> presence more needed than at this dark period. The President and Congress mourn the termina∣tion of his counsel and direction and the army laments the loss of his military arrangements. The States at large present distinguished tokens of the deepest sorrow in conse∣quence of his death, and we ardently hope that the increas∣ing influence of our enemies, at home and abroad may not teach us in the heat of war to realize our present professions. For the trump of war would, if possible, rouse <HI>Washington</HI> from his tomb, once more to direct our arms and save Ame∣rica. Though we have confidence in our generals, yet if called to arms we should in case of discouragement and dis∣tress, greatly need his presence and military address. We still remember, that during the most dangerous period of the late war his personal influence effected more than could be effected by Congress or the power of the states. But, alas, he has left the field of action! He has dropped his ar∣mour. His victorious sword is safely suspended as a pecu∣liar memorial of the conqueror. But let us not injure his ashes by extravagant tears. Rather let us submissively re∣member, that the God of armies has dismissed our General from the field; and let us wisely improve the providence. Let us sympathize and condole like christians with the be∣loved and bereaved Lady of our late General. Her afflic∣tion is great because her loss is great. She weeps freely, but no earthly friend can console her broken heart. Let
<PB N="22" REF="038547_0021_101229D66EFA8510"/>
us then beg God to visit her lonely mansion, which is full of sorrow, with his gracious presence; and send a condoling angel to wipe away her willing tears as they flow from the fountain of grief. Let us mourn with the President; for he has lost the man who diligently travelled by his side through the wide and hazardous field of public life. Let us condole with the American soldiers, who have lost the General whose presence and martial dispositions were the confidence of battle and the preludes of victory and triumph. Let us mourn with our country that her great luminary shone no longer. For we need his beams to dispel the dismal night in which we are involved. While the ene∣mies of America will clap their hands and stamp with their feet and rejoice with all their heart to hear that <HI>Washington</HI> has closed his eyes, let us be humble that we need the af∣fliction. For he was worth ten thousand other men. In his breast, face and deportment there was the influence of an army. Our domestic and distant enemies have much less to fear at present from our arms, than before he resigned the command to the messenger of heaven. For he was able to inspire his country with fortitude, when ready to despair. O how did his seasonable addresses, in the course of the war animate the hearts of the people and add vigour and energy to the authority of the states! In the darkest times his wisdom guided Congress and his influence sup∣ported the union. Not to derogate from the dignity of others, <HI>Washington</HI> was the grand spring of the Federal Ma∣chine. We lately experienced his influence when discour∣agement seized our minds in consequence of the daring in∣solence
<PB N="23" REF="038547_0022_10125565C92BC358"/>
of France. The public mind, when it was judged necessary to raise an army, was highly agitated, and in a trembling manner began to anticipate the horrors of a French war. The prospect was gloomy; for the Ameri∣cans in the full enjoyment of liberty were averse from war. But upon Washington's accepting the command of the army, the gloom was dispelled. Every bosom beat with joy and the public face appeared cheerful, when the Hero expressed his readiness to quit the evening pleasures of life for the hardships and dangers of the field. The event at once created both officers and soldiers and organized a respectable army; for the proved veterans, whose strength was not exhausted by following him during the late successful war, were emulously engaged to enjoy his command. The account of Washington's being at the head of the army no sooner reached us, than even the little boys were fired with the martial spirit and paraded the streets as though they thirsted for the honour of battle. His same, in a word, has made an army of little soldiers, who are determined never to survive the liberty of their country. For this token of good we are indebted to the peculiar influence of that military genius who still lives in the rising, expanding mind of America. But alas the He∣ro is gone! The most able and successful general in the world lies in the dust! How are the weapons of war perished! Let us mourn; let us be skilful in lamentation. For he was conducted into the field and dismissed from it, by the Lord of Hosts, who directs the armies of heaven and all the inhabitants of the earth.</P>

<HI>Fourthly.</HI> If God is the author of human greatness, let us be thankful for Washington the distinguished instrument of his goodness to America. Being ordained for the most renouned character, God furnished him with a great mind and a correspondent education. Aside from the testimony of many learned characters with whom he was long and intimately connected both in private and public life, his writings and actions exhibit ample evidence that he was a man of great genius and erudition. These necessary foun∣dations of future greatness being laid, God gave him early opportunity to exert his abilities and display his worth. In 1755, he was Colonel of a regiment under General Brad∣dock who commanded an army near the Allegany moun∣tains, for the purpose of repelling the combined force of French and Indians. Braddock was a European officer, an enthusiast for discipline; but by no means qualified, as he scorned the advantage of fighting behind rocks and trees, to meet an army of skulking Indians. Young Washington, who was well acquainted with ambush fighting, it is said, advised him better than to expose his army in battle, in open sight of the skulking, invisible foe of the wilderness. But Braddock, who was not afraid to fight Indians at mid∣night with a lanthorn in his hand, spurred his horse and led on his troops. Suddenly, but not unexpectedly to Col. Washington, the Indians fired upon the vanguard of the army which immediately fell back in confusion on the main body and the panic became general. Bold Braddock with the greatest obstinacy remained on the spot calling to order while his officers were falling thick around, until he had several horses shot under him. At length he received a ball
<PB N="25" REF="038547_0024_1012556AB0EC79A0"/>
through his lungs and dropped, and total confusion ensued. With such bold generals Indians choose to fight. Alas for the day. But then, then was the time for the martial foul of <HI>Washington</HI> to display itself. Then in the midst of the dying groans of brave men and the horrid shout of sav∣age conquest God began to raise him above other officers. His direct course to future greatness in the field was point∣ed out. For the young colonel took the command and guided the wounded and vanquished troops safely through the dangers of the wilderness. Till that distressing scene neither he nor his country knew the vast resource of his military genius.</P>
<P>IN consequence of making this retreat, and other ex∣ploits, he was necessarily, at the commencement of the re∣volution, appointed by Congress commander of the Ame∣rican army. In the summer, 1775, he took the command of the undisciplined troops at Cambridge, but too late to direct and improve the military abilities of Warren and other brave men whose memory will survive the marble pil∣lars and monuments on which their names are inscribed.</P>
<P>THOUGH a minute detail of <HI>Washington's</HI> atchieve∣ments from the commencement to the termination of the war is not expected from the pulpit, yet the occasion re∣quires a summary: for gratitude will retain his doings and sufferings in favour of his country. The most pressing ad∣versity necessarily attended his first efforts, in consequence of confronting disciplined Britains with undisciplined Ame∣ricans, whose term of service was too short to season their
<PB N="26" REF="038547_0025_1012556D261F1FF0"/>
bodies and form their minds for the field. The General had more to fear from the contracted inlistments and sup∣plies of his own army than from the whole force of the en∣emy. He requested of his country nothing but patience and a permanent army properly supplied. "<HI>Furnish us with men and provisions, and by the blessing of Providence, we shall secure our liberty,</HI>" was the import of his melting ad∣dresses to the public. But what tongue or pen can fully describe the embarrassments and obstacles with which he struggled, in consequence of not being properly supported? His distressing flight through the Jerseys in '76, at the head of a handful of discouraged men, with elated Britains at his heels, is still fresh in the memory of Americans: for, instead of divesting him of generalship, it only roused his great mind and prepared him for the shout of cardinal vic∣tory which he immediately gained both at Trenton and Princeton. If we recall his military condition in the middle states, where he made the most interesting exertions and was subjected to the greatest afflictions to defend his coun∣try, while the balance of victory remained long in a wavering, doubtful state, we are astonished at the man: for his wis∣dom, fortitude and perseverance all shine superlatively bright. Neither of his military talents can be extolled be∣yond the rest: for his peculiar assemblage of abilities ap∣proaches the perfection of the soldier. In a word, while we follow him both in prosperity and adversity, through the states, during the war, and remember his extensive ar∣rangements from north to south, while the weight of em∣pire rested on his shoulders, we are filled with admiration before the standard of human greatness. For, though he
<PB N="27" REF="038547_0026_101255707329FDF0"/>
had sacrificed his ease and interest, and diligently spent the most valuable period of his days in the midst of the ex∣treme labour, hardship, sufferings and dangers of the field to defend his country, yet when his work was done, like a patriot, he declined any pecuniary consideration. The sal∣vation of America was his reward; and instead of styling himself Emperor of America before he disbanded his suc∣cessful, disciplined army, he in a flood of tears, thanked his brave officers and soldiers for their faithful service in the cause of liberty, dropped his sword, congratulated his coun∣try, styled himself GEORGE WASHINGTON, and returned to Mount Vernon. On his own plantation, at a distance from the clash of arms and the concerns of public life, we behold the <HI>Virginia Farmer.</HI> But the author of great men does not permit long retirement, because they are raised up to direct great concerns. Washington was, therefore, call∣ed by the suffrages of the states to the Presidency of the Union. To gratify a fond nation that hailed him as the Saviour of his country, he accepted the office and presided as chief magistrate, at a dark period, in the most dignified manner, till he was tired of the weight of the public, and once more retired. But once more he was recalled from his delightful retirement into the field of war; and final∣ly, he was summoned from the field of war to resign his armour, not to the nation, but to the God of armies, and to sleep in the dust. The author of his matchless greatness has long improved him as the grand instrument of his mercy to this nation and to the world, and wisely terminated his career.</P>

WHILE, then, we honour the memory of the <HI>creature,</HI> let us, with all the heart HONOUR THE CREATOR. For God is the author of human greatness. Let us also look to the Lord for other <HI>Washingtons</HI> to fill the cabinet and command the field. If we trust in the Lord he will be our rock and salvation.</P>
