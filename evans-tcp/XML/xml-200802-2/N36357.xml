<L>OUR Poet's rules, in easy numbers, tell</L>
<L>He felt the passion he describes so well.</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that soft art successfully refin'd</L>
<L>Tho' angry <HI>Caesar</HI> frown'd, the fair were kind.</L>
<L>More ills from love, than tyrants' malice flow;</L>
<L><HI>Jove's</HI> thunder strikes less sure than <HI>Cupid's</HI> bow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>Ovid</HI> both felt the pain, and found the ease;</L>
<L>Physicians study most their own disease.</L>
<L>The practice of that age in this we try;</L>
<L>Ladies should listen then, and lovers lie.</L>
<L>Who flatter'd most the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>air, were most polite;</L>
<L>Each thought her own admirer in the right;</L>
<L>To be but faintly rude was criminal,</L>
<L>But to be boldly so, aton'd for all.</L>
<L>Breeding was banish'd for the fair one's sake;</L>
<L>The sex ne'er gives, but suffers ours should take.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Advice to you, my Lord, in vain we bring.</L>
<L>The flow'rs ne'er fail to meet the blooming spring.</L>
<L>Tho' you possess all nature's gifts, take care;</L>
<L>Love's queen has charms, but fatal is her snare.</L>

<L>On all, that goddess her false smiles bestows,</L>

<L>But he that once embarks, too surely finds</L>
<L>A sullen sky, black storms, and angry winds.</L>
<L>Cares, fears, and anguish, hov'ring on the coast,</L>
<L>And wrecks on wretches, by their folly lost.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When coming time shall bless you with a bride,</L>
<L>Let passion not persuade, but reason guide:</L>
<L>Instead of gold, let gentle truth endear:</L>
<L>She has most charms, who is the most sincere.</L>
<L>Shun vain variety, 'tis but disease:</L>
<L>Weak appetites are ever hard to please.</L>
<L>The nymph must fear to be inquisitive:</L>
<L>'Tis for the sex's quiet to believe.</L>
<L>Her air an easy confidence must shew,</L>
<L>And shun to find, what she would dread to know▪</L>
<L>Still charming with all arts that can engage,</L>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>OVID'S <HI>Art of Love,</HI> having lately appeared in <HI>French</HI> with <HI>Observations</HI> written by the transla∣tor, which have been very well received in <HI>France;</HI> it has been thought proper to add such of them as are most curious to this <HI>version,</HI> and to make other new <HI>remarks</HI> in some places, where the <HI>English translators</HI> have gi∣ven another <HI>turn</HI> to the <HI>original.</HI> The <HI>introduction</HI> to these <HI>observations</HI> is entirely the <HI>French</HI> author's; so are most of the reflections. 'Tis hop'd those that are not ta∣ken from him, will not be found to be of less importance than those that are▪</P>
<P>A great many people are mistaken in these books: and though they were made use of as a pretence to drive the author from the court of <HI>Augustus,</HI> and confine him to <HI>Tomos,</HI> on the frontiers of the <HI>Getae</HI> and <HI>Surmatae,</HI> yet they were not the true cause of his confinement. They are very far from being so licentious as the writings of several other poets, both <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin.</HI> However, we must own he might have been a little more discreet, especially in some places.</P>
<P>That which offended the <HI>Romans</HI> most in this work, cannot touch us. It has always been more dangerous in <HI>Italy</HI> to converse with women of honour, and frequent their houses, than 'tis with us: Though there is more li∣berty, and what in that country may be an occasion of debauchery, would not at all be so in ours.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding all that has been said against these books <HI>of the Art of Love,</HI> by some over-scrupulous per∣sons, whose discretion has too much of affectation in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; they are not only necessary for the knowledge of the <HI>La∣tin</HI> tongue, and the <HI>Roman</HI> history, concerning which they contain several things very particular; but for the no∣ble <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we find in them, which the most <HI>grave</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> have thought worthy to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="047526_0005_1023BD6573B6AD90"/>
In a word, there's nothing in them that comes near the <HI>licence</HI> of some <HI>epigrams</HI> of <HI>Catullus Martial,</HI> and <HI>Au∣sonius,</HI> of some <HI>satyrs</HI> of <HI>Horace</HI> and <HI>Juvenal,</HI> and seve∣ral other pieces of <HI>ancient</HI> and <HI>modern</HI> authors which are read and commented upon; and about which even cele∣brated <HI>Jesuits</HI> and other religious persons, as eminent for their piety as their erudition, have employed their stu∣dies. Yet who has condemn'd or complain'd of them? We must confess, such things should be manag'd with address: and those of them who have meddled with any of the authors I have named, have shewn that it may be done so, by their succeeding so happily in it.</P>
<P>As for this treatise of the <HI>Art of Love,</HI> for which the author has also prescrib'd a <HI>remedy,</HI> as it is liable to be all interpreted by those whose pens poison every thing they touch; so it may bear a good construction, by such as know how to turn every thing to advantage.</P>
<P>I will yet say, this <HI>Art</HI> may be apply'd to those that intend to marry. There is nothing sure against decency in all that. I agree, if you will have it so, that it ex∣tends so far as to direct one to the means to gain a mis∣tress. If this was not lawful heretofore in <HI>Italy,</HI> on ac∣count of the jealous humour of the <HI>Italians,</HI> we cannot, for the same reason only, say it ought to be forbidden in our country, any more than in several others, provided we could be sure the ladies modesty would not be offend∣ed, before whom youth should be always careful not to exceed the bounds of the respect that's due to them.</P>
<P>Be it as it will, I have thought of endeavouring to ap∣ply all that is said in those books of wanton <HI>love,</HI> to the <HI>art</HI> of loving the <HI>sciences.</HI> The <HI>emblem</HI> is not disagreea∣ble, neither is it impossible to explain all that <HI>Ovid</HI> has written here upon the love of <HI>beauty</HI> by that of the <HI>arts.</HI> What do we not sometimes understand by the loves of a shepherd and shepherdess? By a lover of incomparable beauty, and his fair one passionately in love? But, keep∣ing to the fable, how often has the loves of <HI>Jupiter</HI> and
<PB N="vii" REF="047526_0006_1023BD69AB0F5C78"/>
<HI>Juno</HI> been moraliz'd upon, as well as those of <HI>Apollo</HI> and <HI>Daphne, Mars</HI> and <HI>Venus, Myrrha</HI> and <HI>Cynaras,</HI> and several others, the examples of which are almost in∣finite? Yet these things are seen every day, all the world read and admire them. Tho' the outside of them is a lit∣tle strong, and the literal sense more suspected, than any of the precepts laid down in <HI>Ovid's Art of Love</HI> are li∣centious.</P>
<P>But, to soften this thought a little, let us figure to ourselves, that the poet is not only a <HI>gallant</HI> of the court of <HI>Augustus,</HI> but a philosopher of the <HI>Portic</HI> and <HI>Lyceum;</HI> who proposes to us, as to his disciples, excellent rules to acquire the <HI>virtues</HI> and <HI>sciences,</HI> represented under the name of the <HI>muses,</HI> or ladies of various beauty, who may be met with every where, especially in great academies, in the schools, in courts, in walks, and in holy places; figured by <HI>cirques, theatres, galleries, portices,</HI> and the <HI>temples</HI> of the <HI>Roman</HI> deities, where great assemblies were held. And when we have chosen that which pleases us best, and is most agreeable to our nature; let us en∣deavour to gain its good graces, and enjoy it, that we may become more wise, and more virtuous. Thus we may deceive our imagination: and 'twill be easy for us to make the reading of this treatise, not only pleasant, but profitable. We need not then have any scruple upon us, because there is nothing unchaste in the expression, though such things as are entirely gallant are not ne∣glected; at least no farther than modesty and decency requir'd. I will, if I can, explain my thoughts in this matter, according as occasion may offer.</P>
<P><HI>Of the Art of Love.</HI> By this we ought to understand how we must love, or how we must preserve the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of our love, when we have once acquir'd it. Otherwise 'twas useless to write an <HI>Art of love.</HI> For <HI>love</HI> is form'd in the heart without <HI>art,</HI> and all are without <HI>art</HI> suscep∣tible of that passion. It generally surprizes us, and we know not from whence it comes, though we feel it very sensibly. For this reason the poets so often endeavour to
<PB N="viii" REF="047526_0007_1023BD6CE5BB5128"/>
persuade us that <HI>love</HI> is a potent <HI>god,</HI> who wounds every thing with his darts; and that there is no creature able to resist him. We therefore need no <HI>art</HI> to teach us to <HI>love,</HI> or even to <HI>love</HI> any thing reasonably; but 'tis of very great importance to each of us, that, when we are in∣spir'd, the inspiration should be for a proper object, and a good end, as I design to shew you.</P>
<P><HI>Ovid.</HI> This poet wrote these books a few years before his exile, under colour of which the <HI>decree</HI> of the senate for his banishment was procur'd▪ though they certainly were not the <HI>cause</HI> of it; and indeed could not reasonably be so, unless <HI>Ovid</HI> wrote them in favour of <HI>Augustus'</HI>s grand∣daughter, whom he visited with a little too much fami∣liarity, and did it to please her. For she, no more than her mother, <HI>Agrippa'</HI>s wife, was not so modest as persons of quality and high condition ought to be, as well for their own glory, as for an example to others.</P>
<P>The two first books of the <HI>Art of Love,</HI> contain the pre∣cepts which the author lays down for young men to fol∣low in their courtship to the ladies, and the third teaches the ladies how they ought to make themselves belov'd. The allegory is not uneasily applied to the <HI>sciences</HI> and the <HI>virtues,</HI> represented as lovely women, after my way of imagining it.</P>

<L>IN <HI>Cupid'</HI>s school, whoe'er would take degree,</L>
<L>Must learn his rudiments, by reading me▪</L>
<L>Seamen with failing arts their vessels move;</L>
<L>Art guides the chariot; <HI>a</HI> art instructs to love▪</L>
<L>Of ships and chariots, others know the rule;</L>
<L>But I am master in love's mighty school.</L>
<L><HI>Cupid</HI> indeed is obstinate and wild.</L>
<L>A stubborn god <HI>b;</HI> but yet the god's a child:</L>
<L>Easy to govern in his tender age,</L>
<L>Like fierce <HI>Achilles</HI> in his pupilage.</L>
<L>That hero, born for conquest, <HI>c,</HI> trembling stood</L>
<L>Before the centaur, and receiv'd the rod. <HI>d</HI></L>
<L>As <HI>Chiron e</HI> mollify'd his cruel mind</L>

To teach her softest arts; to sooth the mind,</L>

<L>Yet <HI>Cupid</HI> and <HI>Achilles,</HI> each with scorn</L>
<L>And rage were fill'd; and both were goddess-born.</L>
<L>The bull, reclaim'd and yok'd, the burden draws:</L>
<L>The horse receives his bit within his jaws.</L>
<L>And stubborn love shall bend beneath my sway,</L>
<L>Tho' struggling oft he strives to disobey.</L>
<L>He shakes his torch, he wounds me with his darts;</L>
<L>But vain his force, and vainer are his arts.</L>
<L>The more he burns my soul, or wounds my sight,</L>
<L>The more he teaches <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o revenge the spite.</L>

<L>I sing the brothels loose and unconfin'd,</L>
<L>Th' unpunishable pleasures of the kind;</L>
<L>Which all alike, for love, or money find.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>You, who in <HI>Cupid's,</HI> rolls inscribe your name,</L>

<HEAD>NOTES TO BOOK I.</HEAD>
<P><HI>a</HI> Art is certainly requisite, in every thing, to suc∣ceed well: and he who does not understand the art of writing, especially of making verses, ought never to meddle that way.</P>
<P><HI>b</HI> Love is very seldom guided by reason. <HI>Ille ferus est,</HI> I confess he is cruel, or wild.</P>
<P><HI>c Chiron. Ovid</HI> calls <HI>Philly rides,</HI> that is the son of <HI>Phillyra;</HI> for <HI>Chiron</HI> was the son of <HI>Phillyra,</HI> daughter of <HI>Oceanus</HI> and <HI>Saturn;</HI> who made love to her in the shape of a horse, according to <HI>Aratus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>d</HI> This alludes to the killing <HI>Hector.</HI></P>
<P><HI>e Achilles</HI> submitted to the discipline of the centaur <HI>Chiron;</HI> and when he had committed a fault, held out his hands to the <HI>Ferula,</HI> or rather rod for correction.</P>
<P><HI>f Cupid</HI> was the son of <HI>Venus,</HI> and <HI>Achilles</HI> of <HI>Thesis.</HI> Both were children alike, and both hard to govern. For indeed the passions of love and glory, are not easily over∣come by reason, which ought always to be mistress.</P>
<P><HI>g</HI> This is, (says he) to shew us that love may always be tamed by habit.</P>
<P><HI>h</HI> The poets, as is well known, always invoked this divinity; but <HI>Ovid'</HI>s manner is here particular; he ad∣dresses <HI>Venus</HI> to be propitious to him, the subject relat∣ing to that goddess. From whence the ancients drew their auguries. To which the poet here <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. As if

he would have said, I am not <HI>Hesiod,</HI> who, as he kept his flocks in the vale of <HI>Asera</HI> (that poet being a shepherd) saw the nine muses, who inspired him to make verses. The vale of <HI>Asera</HI> was at the foot of mount <HI>Helicon,</HI> where <HI>Dius</HI> and <HI>Lycemede, Hesiod's</HI> father and mother dwelt.</P>
<P><HI>i</HI> It has been before observed, that he invokes the god∣dess of love to assist his song.</P>
<P><HI>k</HI> The poet here gives his advice as to three things; to seek after an amiable object; to win it by respect and complacency; and not to lose it after once got∣ten.</P>
<P><HI>l</HI> Allusion to <HI>Paris,</HI> who sailed from <HI>Troy</HI> to <HI>Greece</HI> to look for a wife, where he stole the famous <HI>Helen,</HI> so much talked of, and carried her off.</P>
<P><HI>m</HI> Generally interpreted, and is supposed to mean the temple of concord, built by <HI>Livia, Cermanicus'</HI>s mo∣ther.</P>
<P><HI>n</HI> The <HI>Danaides,</HI> so called from their father <HI>Danaus,</HI> king of <HI>Argos;</HI> and sometimes <HI>Belides,</HI> from the name of their grandfather <HI>Belus,</HI> who had two sons, <HI>Egyptus</HI> and <HI>Danaus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>o</HI> It was the custom among the <HI>Romans,</HI> to meet in the temple of <HI>Venus</HI> to mourn <HI>Adonis;</HI> of which the Prophet Ezekiel speaks, Ezek. viii. 14. <HI>Ovid</HI> means the temple of <HI>Venus,</HI> where that goddess was worshipped at <HI>Rome</HI> with <HI>Adonis,</HI> according to the manner of the <HI>Assyrians.</HI></P>
<P><HI>p</HI> There were a great number of the <HI>Jews</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> in <HI>Augustus'</HI>s reign, who were allowed full liberty to exercise their ceremonies, according to the law of <HI>Moses▪</HI> And the <HI>Roman</HI> ladies went often to see them out of cu∣riosity, which gave occasion for assignations at their <HI>Sy∣nagogues.</HI></P>
<P><HI>q</HI> This relates to certain ceremonies in the temple of <HI>Isis,</HI> after the manner of the <HI>Egyptians.</HI> He calls this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mple the <HI>Cow of Nile.</HI> The feast of <HI>Isis</HI> was cele∣brated every year by the women ten days together, and
<PB N="36" REF="047526_0035_1023BDBEAEF25F20"/>
not without allowing themselves great liberty on those occasions.</P>
<P><HI>r</HI> Many women were debauched by <HI>Isis'</HI>s means, as she was by <HI>Jupiter</HI> under the name of <HI>Io,</HI> whose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able all the world have heard of.</P>
<P><HI>s</HI> The idea of the <HI>Roman</HI> theatres in their infancy, may put us in mind of our own, which we read of in old poets in <HI>Bluckfryers,</HI> the <HI>Bull and mouth,</HI> and <HI>Barbican,</HI> not much better than the strollers at a country fair.</P>
<P><HI>t</HI> These races were in the <HI>Cirque,</HI> or in the <HI>Hippo∣dromes,</HI> or the field of <HI>Mars,</HI> and were commonly run in the month of <HI>April,</HI> in the grand <HI>Cirque,</HI> between the <HI>Aventine</HI> and <HI>Palantine</HI> hills. The word <HI>Circus,</HI> or <HI>Cir∣ques,</HI> comes from the horses running round the course o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Metes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>u</HI> 'Tis plain by this the ancient <HI>Romans</HI> used to make love by signs on their fingers, like the modern <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Portuguese.</HI></P>
<P><HI>x Amphitheatres,</HI> where the gladiators fought: Of which <HI>Juvenal</HI> speaks especially in the 6th <HI>Satyr:</HI> He calls it <HI>Tristis Arena,</HI> on account of the murders that were com∣mitted there; and the <HI>Romans,</HI> with all their politeness, must have a great mixture of cruelty in their tempers▪ or they would not have taken pleasure in seeing men cut one another's throats, and look on with so much in∣difference, that they could make love in those very places.</P>
<P><HI>y</HI> The naval combats were represented in a place dug on purpose on the banks of the <HI>Tiber;</HI> 'twas called <HI>Nau∣machia</HI> and, when occasion requir'd, the river water was set into it. This alludes to the triumphs of the <HI>Roman</HI> conquerors; They were wonderfully magnifi∣cent, accompanied with rich spoils, and pictures of ri∣vers, mountains, cities, and provinces conquered by them; not to speak of the captive kings and great cap∣tains that followed the victor's car in chains.</P>

<HI>aa.</HI> The poets gave horns to this god, to shew his ma∣lice and obstinacy, very well represented by horns. This is <HI>Fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s'</HI>s thought: and the ancients us'd to say so of such as were drunk. The night is an ill time to chuse a mis∣tress <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P><HI>bb. Seneca,</HI> among others, observes, that 'twas not only a place of pleasure, but of debauchery. The deli∣cious bat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s that were there, tempted <HI>debauchees</HI> to fre∣quent them.</P>
<P><HI>cc.</HI> The sovereign priest of <HI>Diana, Aricina,</HI> called himself king, and often got that dignity by gaining the better of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> oponent in single combat.

<L>E'er happy men beneath the roof were laid,</L>
<L>When oaks provided them with food and shade;</L>
<L>Some gloomy cave receiv'd the wanton pair;</L>
<L>For light too modest, and unshaded air.</L>
<L>From public view they decently retir'd,</L>
<L>And secretly perform'd what love inspir'd.</L>
<L>Now scarce a modish fop about the town,</L>
<L>But boasts with whom, how often, and where done;</L>
<L>They taste no pleasure, relish no delight,</L>
<L>Till they recount what pass'd the happy night.</L>
<L>But men of honour always thought it base,</L>
<L>To prostitute each kinder nymph's embrace;</L>
<L>To blast her fame, and vainly hurt his own,</L>
<L>And furnish scandal for a lewd lampoon.</L>
<L>And here I must some guilty arts accuse,</L>
<L>And disingenuous shifts that lovers use,</L>
<L>To wrong the chaste, and innocence abuse.</L>
<L>When long repuls'd they find their courtship vain,</L>
<L>Her character with infamy they stain:</L>
<L>Deny'd her person, they debauch her same,</L>
<L>And brand her innocence with public shame.</L>
<L>Go, jealous fool, the injur'd beauty guard,</L>
<L>Let ev'ry door be lock'd, and window barr'd!</L>
<L>The suff'ring nymph remains expos'd to wrong.</L>
<L>Her name's a prostitute to ev'ry tongue;</L>
<L>For malice will with joy the lie receive,</L>
<L>Report, and what it wishes true, believe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With care conceal whate'er defects you find:</L>
<L>To all her faults seem like a lover blind.</L>
<L>Naked <HI>Andromeda</HI> when <HI>Perseus</HI> view'd,</L>

<L><HI>Andromache</HI> was tall, yet some report,</L>

At first what's nauseous lessens by degrees.</L>
<L>Young loves are nice, and difficult to please.</L>
<L>The infant plant that bears a tender rind,</L>
<L>Reels to and fro with ev'ry breath of wind:</L>
<L>But shooting upwards to a tree at last,</L>
<L>It stems the storm, and braves the strongest blast.</L>
<L>Time will defects and blemishes endear,</L>
<L>And make them lovely to your eyes appear:</L>
<L>Unusual scents at first may give offence;</L>
<L>Time reconciles them to the vanquish'd sense.</L>
<L>Her vices soften with some kinder phrase;</L>
<L>If she is swarthy as the negro's face, <HI>ii</HI></L>
<L>Call it a graceful brown, and that complexion praise:</L>
<L>The ruddy lass must be like <HI>Venus</HI> fair,</L>
<L>Or like <HI>Minerva</HI> that has yellow hair.</L>
<L>If pale and meagre, praise her shape and youth,</L>
<L>Active when small, when gross she's plump and smooth.</L>
<L>Ev'ry excess by soft'ning terms disguise,</L>
<L>And in some neighb'ring virtue hide each vice.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor ask her age, consult no register,</L>
<L>Under whose reign she's born, or what's the year▪</L>
<L>If fading youth chequers her hair with white,</L>
<L>Experience makes her perfect in delight;</L>
<L>In her embrace sublimer joys are found,</L>

<L>The hours enjoy whilst youth and pleasure last,</L>
<L>Age hurries on, and death pursues too fast:</L>
<L>Or plough the seas, or cultivate the land,</L>
<L>Or wield the sword in thy advent'rous hand;</L>
<L>Or much in love thy nervous strength employ,</L>

In vary'd ways they act the pleasure o'er,</L>
<L>Not pictur'd postures can improve you more. <HI>kk</HI></L>
<L>They want no courtship to provoke delight,</L>
<L>But meet your warmth with equal appetite:</L>
<L>Give me enjoyment when the willing dame <HI>ll</HI></L>

<L>I love to hear the soft transporting joys,</L>
<L>The frequent sighs, and tender murm'ring voice:</L>
<L>To see her eyes with vary'd pleasure move,</L>
<L>And all the nymph confess the pow'r of love.</L>
<L>Nature's not thus indulgent to the young,</L>
<L>These joys alone to riper years belong.</L>
<L>Who youth enjoys drinks crude unready wine,</L>
<L>Let age your girl, and sprightly juice refine,</L>
<L>Mellow their sweets, and make the taste divine.</L>
<L>To <HI>Helen</HI> who'd <HI>Hermione</HI> prefer?</L>

<P><HI>c</HI> The poet makes use of the example of <HI>Atlanta,</HI> to shew there's nothing so wild but may be made gentle.</P>
<P><HI>d</HI> There is nothing more difficult, than to explain the ancient gaming, especially to make it any way agree with the modern.</P>
<P><HI>e</HI> They were commonly in use at the theatres, or in walks, to keep off the heat of the sun, the rain and the wind. Sometimes they were made of feathers; for, ac∣cording to most commentators, by <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> we must un∣derstand feathers sewed or otherwise fasten'd together. <HI>Ovid</HI> advises the lover not only to hold an umbrella over his mistress, but to descend to meaner offices, to pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> off or put on her shoes or slippers.</P>

<P><HI>i</HI> This has allusion to a festival celebrated at <HI>Rome</HI> by the servants, in remembrance of a great piece of service their predecessors had done, the <HI>Romans,</HI> soon after the invasion of the <HI>Gauls;</HI> the time of celebrating it was in <HI>July.</HI></P>

<P><HI>m</HI> Indeed what <HI>Ovid</HI> complains of in his time, may with much more reason be complained against now; for the muses are not only neglected but despis'd. 'Tis too true, that learning of all sorts is not in that esteem which it was in <HI>Augustus'</HI>s days; and if there are few men who write good books, there are fewer still who read them.</P>
<P><HI>n</HI> They curl'd their hair with a bodkin, and some∣times with a hot iron, as in our days; but they shew'd more of it, than 'tis the fashion of our modern ladies. The next care <HI>Ovid</HI> recommends to the lover, is the complaisance he is to observe towards his mistress when she is sick. Alluding to a ceremony practis'd by the <HI>Romans</HI> of purifying the bed; an office which belong∣ed to the nurse. And this was done with sulphur and eggs; a sort of religious worship, when vows were made of the health and rest of the patient.</P>
<P><HI>o</HI> This and the following similies are taken from coun∣try affairs, which have an agreeable effect on this oc∣casion, when the poet speaks of the tendency of every living thing to love.</P>

<L>Why should you thus your loyal poet wrong,</L>
<L>Who in your war has serv'd so well and long!</L>

<L>Rules for your vot'ries I did late impart,</L>
<L>Refining passion, and made love an art.</L>
<L>Nor do I now, of that of thee take leave,</L>
<L>Nor does the muse her former with unweave.</L>
<L>Let him, who loves where love success may find,</L>
<L>Spread all his sails before the prosp'rous wind;</L>
<L>But let poor youths, who female scorn endure,</L>
<L>And hopeless burn, repair to me for cure:</L>
<L>For why should any worthy youth destroy</L>
<L>Himself, because some worthless nymph <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪</L>
<L>Love should be nature's friend; let hemp and steel</L>
<L>Hangmen and heroes use, whose trades to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</L>
<L>Where fatal it would prove, let passion cease:</L>

A child you are, and like a child you play;</L>
<L>And gentle as your ears should be your sway.</L>
<L>Keen arrows, and to wound the hardest hearts,</L>
<L>You are permitted—but no mortal darts.</L>
<L>Let your step father <HI>Mars,</HI> on sword and spear <HI>d</HI></L>
<L>The crimson stains of cruel conquest wear;</L>
<L>You should your mother's milder laws observe,</L>
<L>Who ne'er did childless parent's curse deserve.</L>
<L>Or if you must employ your wanton pow'r,</L>
<L>Teach youths by night to force their mistress'd door:</L>
<L>How lovers safe and secretly may meet,</L>
<L>And subtle wives the cautious husband cheat:</L>
<L>Let now th' excluded youth the gate caress,</L>
<L>A thousand wheedling soothing plaints express;</L>
<L>Then on th' ill-natur'd timber vent her spight,</L>
<L>And to some doleful tune weep out the night.</L>
<L>For tears, not blood, love's altar should require:</L>
<L>Love's torch, design'd to kindle kind desire,</L>
<L>Must seem profane, to light a fun'ral fire.</L>
<L>Thus I.—The god his purple wings display'd,</L>
<L>And, <HI>forward, finish your design,</HI> he said.</L>
<L>To me, ye injur'd youths, for help repair,</L>

<L>The hand that wounded shall your health restore.</L>

<L>Such was the cure th' <HI>Arcadian,</HI> hero found, <HI>e</HI></L>
<L>The <HI>Pelian</HI> spear, that wounded, made him sound.</L>

<L>In like distress may serve the female tribe:</L>
<L>And when beyond your sphere my methods go▪</L>
<L>You may, at least, infer what you should do.</L>

While yet in breath, ere yet your nerves are broke,</L>
<L>Cast from your gen'rous neck the shameful yoke:</L>
<L>Check love's first symptoms, the weak foe surprise,</L>
<L>Who, once entrench'd will all your arts despise.</L>
<L>Think, wretch, what you hereafter must endure,</L>
<L>What certain toil, for an uncertain cure.</L>
<L>Slip not one minute; who prefers to-day,</L>
<L>To-morrow will be harden'd in delay.</L>
<L>'Tis love's old practice, still to sooth you on,</L>
<L>'Tis your disease gets strength, and till your strength is gone.</L>
<L>Rivers small fountains have, and yet we find</L>
<L>Vast sets of those small fountain'd rivers join'd,</L>
<L>Lock'd up in bark poor <HI>Myrr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a</HI> ne'er had been,</L>
<L>Had she the progress, of her crime foreseen;</L>
<L>But pleas'd with the soft kindling of love's fire,</L>
<L>We, day by day, indulge the fond desire;</L>
<L>'Till like a serpent it has eat its way,</L>
<L>And uncontroul'd does on her entrails prey.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet if the proper season you have pass'd,</L>
<L>Though hard the task, I'll use my skill at last;</L>
<L>Nor see my patient perish by his grief,</L>

<L>Will none, in last extremities, refuse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Or try to quench the kindling flames, or stay</L>
<L>'Till their spent fury on itself does prey.</L>
<L>While in its full career, give scope to rage.</L>
<L>And circumvent the force you can't engage.</L>

Distemper'd minds, distracted with their grief,</L>
<L>Take all for foes, who offer them relief.</L>
<L>But when the first fermenting smart is o'er,</L>
<L>They suffer you to probe the ripen'd sore.</L>
<L>'Tis madness a fond mother to dissuade</L>
<L>From tears, while on his hearse her son is laid:</L>
<L>But when grief's deluge can no higher swell,</L>
<L>Declining sorrow you'll with ease repel.</L>
<L>Cures have their times; the best that can be try'd</L>
<L>Enflame the wound, unseas'nably apply'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If therefore you expect to find redress,</L>
<L>In the first place, take leave of idleness. <HI>h</HI></L>
<L>'Tis this that kindled first your fond desire,</L>
<L>'Tis this brings fuel to the am'rous fire.</L>
<L>Bar idleness, you ruin <HI>Cupid's</HI> game,</L>
<L>You blunt his arrows, and you quench his flame.</L>
<L>What wine to plane-trees, streams to poplars prove,</L>
<L>Marshes to reeds, is idleness to love.</L>
<L>Mind business, if your passion you'd destroy;</L>
<L>Secure is he, who can himself employ.</L>
<L>Sleep, drinking, gaming, for the foe make way,</L>
<L>And to love's ambuscade the roving heart betray.</L>
<L>The slothful he seeks out, and makes his prize,</L>
<L>Surely as he the man of business flies.</L>
<L>Make business (no matter what) your care;</L>
<L>Some dear friend's cause may want you at the bar:</L>
<L>Or if your courage tempts you to the field,</L>
<L>Love's wanton arms to rough campaigns will yield.</L>
<L><HI>Parthia</HI> fresh work for triumph does afford,</L>
<L>Half-conquer'd to your hand, by <HI>Caesar's</HI> sword.</L>

To death's cold arms what made poor <HI>Phillis</HI> fly</L>
<L>'Twas less her grief, than want to company.</L>
<L>Wild as a Bacchanal, her way she took,</L>
<L>With hair dishevell'd, and distracted look;</L>
<L>Far out to sea she cast her prying eyes;</L>
<L>Now stretch'd upon the sandy beach she lies:</L>
<L>Faithless <HI>Demophoon!</HI> to deaf waves she cry'd,</L>

<L>Hard by a lonesome tree its shadow cast,</L>

<L>Think on your rival in her chamber kept;</L>

Now to perform a true physician's part,</L>
<L>And shew I'm perfect master of my art;</L>
<L>I will prescribe what diet you shall use.</L>
<L>What food you ought to take, and what refuse.</L>
<L>Mushrooms of ev'ry fort provoke desire,</L>
<L>Salacious rocket sets your veins on fire:</L>
<L>The plant I'd recommend is wholesome rue,</L>
<L>It clears the sight, and does the blood subdue:</L>
<L>But in a word, of all the herbs that grow,</L>
<L>Take only such as keep the body low.</L>
<L>If my opinion you would have of wine,</L>
<L>It quenches love, and does to love incline.</L>
<L>A little breath of wind but fans the fire,</L>
<L>Whose flame will in a happier blast expire.</L>
<L>In wine you must no moderation keep:</L>
<L>You must not drink at all; or drink so deep,</L>
<L>So large a dose, as put your cares to sleep.</L>

<LG>
<L>Now to our port we are arriv'd: bring down</L>
<L>The josly wreath, our leaky bark to crown, <HI>oo</HI></L>
<L>Your grief redrest, and now a happy throng,</L>
<L>Ye nymphs and youths applaud my healing song.</L>

<L>ONCE as I lay by heavy sleep oppress'd,</L>
<L>With this strange whim my fancy was possess'd,</L>
<L>I dreamt that <HI>Cupid</HI> call'd me to his court</L>
<L>On mount <HI>Cithera,</HI> where his slaves resort:</L>
<L>Where <HI>Venus,</HI> queen and <HI>Goddess,</HI> fills the throne,</L>
<L>Her kingdom sharing with her darling son;</L>
<L>There was I straight commanded to appear, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></L>
<L>By <HI>Mercury,</HI> the winged messenger:</L>
<L>Away I went, thro' strange and distant lands,</L>
<L>The coast enquiring where <HI>Love's</HI> palace stands;</L>
<L>At last a crowd of travellers I found,</L>
<L>And ask'd them whither they so fast were bound;</L>
<L>One, looking like a maid, cry'd, gentle friend,</L>
<L>To <HI>Cupid</HI>'s court our willing steps we bend;</L>
<L><PB N="141" REF="047526_0139_1023BEEB55DF4610"/>
Oh! where's his court? said I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> The nymph reply'd,</L>
<L>High on <HI>Cithera</HI> stands, with tow'ring pride,</L>
<L>A stately castle, his imperial seat,</L>
<L>In which he lives magnificently great.</L>
<L>Her steps I follow'd till my eager sight,</L>
<L>Reaching the hill, found her description right▪</L>
<L>Amaz'd I saw the building large and strong,</L>
<L>Vast were the domes, the marble turrets long,</L>
<L>But gold and jewels hid the massy stone,</L>
<L>And stretching to the skies with lustre shone;</L>
<L>Saphires and rubies mingled various lights</L>
<L>More sparkling than the stars in winter nights;</L>
<L>And <HI>phoebus</HI> darted on this happy place</L>
<L>His lustre, to regain the <HI>Queen</HI>'s good grace;</L>
<L>For chancing once unluckily to find</L>
<L><HI>Mars</HI> in her arms, he had enrag'd her mind;</L>
<L>But now to please th' offended <HI>Queen</HI> he strove,</L>
<L>Which shew'd his longing for the sweets of love.</L>
<L>For all the <HI>Gods</HI> that on <HI>Olympus</HI> dwell,</L>
<L>Ev'n <HI>Jove</HI> and <HI>pluto,</HI> kings of heav'n and hell,</L>
<L>All things that live on earth, or breathe above,</L>
<L>The mighty joys of this best realm approve.</L>
<L>Arriv'd at court, I found the palace-rooms</L>
<L>Adorn'd with hangings made in costly looms;</L>
<L>Fair maids I met, that mov'd with heav'nly grace,</L>
<L>And young men walking with a lusty pace;</L>
<L>Old men I saw too, but I could not dream</L>
<L>What service <HI>Venus</HI> could receive from them.</L>
<L>Pensive I stood, and scarful to be seen.</L>
<L>'Till one I spy'd belonging to the queen,</L>
<L>Call'd <HI>Philomel;</HI> I knew her once a maid,</L>
<L>But all her life she lov'd: My friend, she said,</L>

<L>Receiv'd from <HI>Mercury</HI> a summons here.</L>
<L>I answer'd, Yes; She said your negligence</L>
<L>will then be thought a wilful dire offence;</L>

To this fam'd palace early should repair,</L>
<L>And hasten to the service of the fair;</L>
<L>But you that absent durst so long remain.</L>
<L><HI>Without a boat had better cross the main,</HI></L>
<L>Than bear the curse that disobedience draws</L>
<L>On bold contemners of love's sacred laws.</L>
<L>For no unhappy man such torments bear,</L>
<L>As wretches doom'd to feel affliction here.</L>
<L>Soon they perceive their appetite decay'd.</L>
<L>Love makes their health decrease, their colour fade,</L>
<L>Long since I tempted you to <HI>Cupia</HI>'s court:</L>
<L>Now he'll receive you with a sullen port.</L>
<L>Perhaps repentance may the god assuage;</L>

<L>I answer'd thus:—With sorrow I repent,</L>
<L>Wretch that I am, a life so vainly spent;</L>
<L>And, having spoke, by her I straight was led</L>
<L>To a vast hill, with various carpets spread,</L>
<L>And cloth of gold; on which I wond'ring found</L>
<L>A throne of state, erected from the ground.</L>
<L>Where <HI>Venus</HI> sat, with her imperial son;</L>
<L>Each had a sceptre, and a radiant crown,</L>
<L>To see their pomp I could 'till now have stood,</L>
<L>Thoughtless of drink, and destitute of food:</L>
<L>The pleasures of the fam'd <HI>Elysian</HI> field,</L>
<L>Can no such rapture to a stranger yield.</L>
<L>No wonder <HI>Venus,</HI> blest with such a mein,</L>
<L>And such a person, reigns, of beauty queen,</L>
<L>Her golden hair, dishevell'd, crisp and long,</L>
<L>In easy curls, around her shoulder hung;</L>
<L>And every beam that's darted from her eyes,</L>
<L>Piercing and sharp, like pointed arrows flies,</L>
<L>The <HI>king of Love,</HI> had danger by his side,</L>
<L>The <HI>Queen</HI> despair: And looking further wide,</L>
<L>Attendance, fear, and flattery, I view'd,</L>
<L>And hope, with strength, above the rest endu'd;</L>
<L>And wrinkled jealousy, with young delight,</L>
<L>Open and free, and cheerful to the fight;</L>
<L><PB N="143" REF="047526_0141_1023BEEF92A7B608"/>
And envy lurking in a secret place,</L>
<L>Lean was her body, leering was her face;</L>
<L>Repining at the fortunate she sat,</L>
<L>And at that distance one might see her fret.</L>
<L>Below the throne, an humble sighing crowd</L>
<L>With pressing suits, and warm petitions bow'd.</L>
<L>Then <HI>Philomel</HI> I ask'd whence came the tide</L>
<L>Of all those througing suppliants? She reply'd,</L>
<L>From diverse realms they come: Those drest in blue,</L>
<L>Shew by that colour, they have still been true.</L>
<L>The men in black lament, that those they love</L>
<L>Are sick, or dead, or that they cruel prove.</L>
<L>What makes those priests, said I, in court appear?</L>
<L>Have they the privilege of serving here?</L>
<L>The dame reply'd, full many maids can tell</L>
<L>None are more welcome, and none serve so well.</L>
<L>While thus I view'd, with <HI>Philomel,</HI> the crowd,</L>
<L>A herald from the king cry'd out aloud,</L>
<L>Come all ye strangers, to the throne, draw near,</L>
<L>And instantly before the king appear.</L>
<L>In haste I ran, and kneel'd before the throne,</L>
<L>All pale and trembling; as a wretch undone:</L>
<L>The king look'd sternly, and demanded, why</L>
<L>I came so late, and what I could reply?</L>
<L>Weeping, I answer'd, Oh, my sov'reign lord,</L>
<L>One act of mercy to your slave afford;</L>
<L>If yet, a rebel both in word and thought,</L>
<L>I never lov'd so truly as I ought;</L>
<L>I will henceforth endeavour to fulfil</L>
<L>The just decrees of your almighty will.</L>
<L>Well, all is pardon'd, he reply'd, If now</L>

Yours be the choice, I only wish to find</L>
<L>A faithful mistress, beautiful, and kind;</L>
<L>No woman yet my settled passion moves;</L>
<L>One I have seen, whom most my soul approves;</L>
<L>Of stature low, cast in a lovely mould,</L>
<L>Healthful and young, with hair more bright than gold;</L>
<L>Her looks are fresh, her countenance demure,</L>
<L>Her eyes tho' killing, look like crystal pure:</L>
<L>Her could I serve; but if your high decree</L>
<L>That fair denies, some other find for me,</L>

<L>Let monks and friars her disciples be.</L>
<L>Thus in the temple having said my pray'r,</L>
<L>Another image I discover'd there;</L>
<L>A tender maid, said <HI>Philomel,</HI> does claim</L>
<L>That sacred shrine, and <HI>Pity</HI> is her name:</L>
<L>In all the court, none knows so well the art</L>
<L>To help a lover, or to save a heart:</L>
<L>Her all-commanding int'rest cannot fail;</L>
<L>Gain but her friendship, and you must prevail.</L>
<L>Now you shall see the fairest thing alive,</L>
<L>Come on with me, and by your carriage strive</L>
<L>To please a Lady of the nicest taste.</L>
<L>Whose air is prudent, as her life is chaste:</L>
<L>Call'd <HI>Rosalinda;</HI> could you gain her grace,</L>

<L>Take care your sense and modesty to show,</L>
<L>She hates a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt, insipid, prating beau,</L>
<L>Then straight she led me to a spacious room,</L>
<L>Where <HI>Rosalinda</HI> sat in beauty's bloom:</L>
<L>At the first fight a shiv'ring pain I found;</L>
<L>In all my veins, my heart receiv'd a wound;</L>
<L>I dreaded much to speak, my voice was broke,</L>
<L>Yet when my sighs permitted, thus I spoke;</L>
<L><PB N="147" REF="047526_0145_1023BEFB1191C998"/>
Accept my service, thou celestial fair,</L>
<L>And oh! receive a dying lover's care;</L>
<L>To your commands my painful heart I bind,</L>
<L>And have for ever liberty resign'd.</L>
<L>She made no answer, and I soon retir'd,</L>
<L>To press not daring, tho' by love inspir'd;</L>
<L>But still her image dwelt within my breast,</L>
<L>Too excellent to be in verse exprest.</L>
<L>Her head is round, and flaxen is her hair,</L>
<L>Her eye-brows darker, but her fore-head fair,</L>
<L>Straight is her nose; her eyes like em'ralds bright:</L>
<L>Her well-made cheeks are lovely red and white;</L>
<L>Short is her mouth, her lips are made to kiss,</L>
<L>Rosy and full, and prodigal of bliss;</L>
<L>Her teeth like iv'ry are, well-siz'd and even:</L>
<L>And to her breath etherial sweets are given:</L>
<L>Her hands are snowy white, and small her waist,</L>
<L>And what is yet untold is sure the best.</L>
<L>Had <HI>Jove</HI> himself beheld this heav'nly fair,</L>
<L><HI>Calisto</HI> never had been made a star;</L>
<L>He ne'er had borne <HI>Europa</HI> on his back,</L>

<L>For all their beauties had too mean appear'd.</L>
<L>With <HI>Rosalinda</HI>'s matchless charms compar'd.</L>
<L>Soon I return'd her heav'nly form to view,</L>
<L>And still my wound's impression deeper grew;</L>
<L>And thus I spoke: O nature's boasted pride.</L>
<L>For torments caus'd by you some cure provide:</L>
<L>Prais'd be my fate, and ever blest the hour,</L>
<L>That made me subject to your lawful pow'r:</L>
<L>Not <HI>Antony</HI> could greater passion boast,</L>
<L>Tho' for one woman the whole world be lost.</L>

<L>That in the muses happy garden shoot,</L>

<L>Thus, gentle muse, my humble breast inspire</L>

<L>And, <HI>Pallas,</HI> thy propitious light convey,</L>

<L>Unless some pity on my pain you shed,</L>
<L><HI>The frosty grave will quickly be my bed.</HI></L>
<L>Thus having spoke, my voice began to fail,</L>
<L>My colour sunk, and turn'd like ashes pale;</L>
<L>I swoon'd, and down I fell. Thou slave, arise,</L>
<L>Cry'd <HI>Rosalinda;</HI> now thy love I prize.</L>
<L>I only try'd thy heart; and since I find</L>
<L>'Tis soft and tender, know that mine is kind.</L>
<L>Swear but to keep the oath you lately took,</L>
<L>And I'll not be so cruel as I look.</L>
<L>Her eyes then languish'd and her face grew red.</L>
<L>And squeezing fast my hand, she laughing said.</L>
<L>I know a way thy passion to appease,</L>
<L>And soon will set thy simple heart at ease.</L>

<HEAD>LEANDER's EPISTLE TO HERO.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Leander accustomed nightly to swim over the Hellespont to visit Hero, (priestess of Venus's temple) being at last hindered by storms from his wonted course, sent her the following epistle.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<L>READ this; yet be not troubled when you read,</L>
<L>Your lover comes not, in his letter's stead,</L>
<L>On you all health, all happiness attend,</L>
<L>Which I would much, much rather bring than send.</L>
<L>But now these envious storms obstruct my way,</L>
<L>And only this bold bark durst put to sea.</L>
<L>I too had come, had not my parents' spies,</L>
<L>Stood by to watch me with suspicious eyes,</L>
<L>How many tedious days and nights are past,</L>
<L>Since, I was suffer'd to behold you last!</L>
<L>Ye spiteful gods and goddesses, who keep</L>
<L>Your watry courts within the spacious deep,</L>
<L>Why at this time, are all the winds, broke forth?</L>
<L>Why swell the seas beneath the furious north?</L>
<L><PB N="153" REF="047526_0151_1023BF0AC8E83A48"/>
'Tis summer now when all should be serene:</L>
<L>The skies unclouded, undisturb'd the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>;</L>
<L>Winter is yet unwilling to appear,</L>
<L>But you invert the seasons of the year.</L>
<L>Yet let me once attain the wish'd for beach,</L>
<L>Out of the now malicious <HI>Neptune's</HI> reach:</L>
<L>Then blow, ye winds; ye troubled billows roar;</L>
<L>Roll on, you angry waves, and lash the shore.</L>
<L>Ruffle the seas, drive the tempestuous air;</L>
<L>Be one continu'd storm, and keep me there.</L>
<L>Ah! <HI>Hero,</HI> when to you my course is bent,</L>
<L>I seem to slide along a smooth descent.</L>
<L>But in returning thence, I clamber up.</L>
<L>And scale, methinks, some lofty mountain's top.</L>
<L>Why, when our souls by mutual love are join'd,</L>
<L>Why are we sunder'd by the sea and wind?</L>
<L>Either make my <HI>Abydos</HI> your retreat,</L>
<L>Or let your <HI>Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>os</HI> be my much lov'd seat.</L>
<L>This plague of absence I can bear no more,</L>

<L>Nothing but death shall keep me from thy arms:</L>
<L>Yet may that death at last to friendly prove,</L>
<L>To float me to the coast of her I love.</L>
<L>Let not the thought occasion any fear:</L>

But that delight my muse forbears to sing.</L>
<L>She knows the weakness of her infant wing.</L>
<L>AS when the painter strove to draw the chief</L>
<L>Of all the <HI>Grecians,</HI> in his height of grief:</L>
<L>In ev'ry limb the well-shap'd piece excell'd,</L>
<L>But coming to the face, his pencil fail'd.</L>
<L>There modestly he staid, and held, for fear</L>
<L>He should not reach the woe he fancy'd there;</L>
<L>But round the mournful head a veil he threw.</L>
<L>That men might guess at what he could not shew.</L>
<L>So when our pleasure rises to excess,</L>
<L>No tongue can tell it, and no pen express.</L>
<L>Love will not have his mysteries reveal'd,</L>
<L>And beauty keeps the joys it gives conceal'd.</L>
<L>And 'till these joys my <HI>Delia</HI> lets me know,</L>

<L>Ah! <HI>Delia,</HI> would indulgent love decree,</L>
<L>Thy faithful slave that heav'n of bliss with thee;</L>
<L>What then should be my verse? What darling flights</L>
<L>Should my muse take? reach what celestial heights?</L>
<L>Now in despair, with drooping notes she sings,</L>
<L>No dawn of hope to raise her on her wings,</L>
<L>In the warm spring the warbling birds rejoice,</L>
<L>And in the smiling sun-shine tune their voice.</L>
<L>Bask'd in the beams, they strain their tender throats,</L>
<L>Where cheerful light inspires the charming notes.</L>
<L>Such, and so charming should my numbers be,</L>
<L>If you, my only light, should smile on me.</L>

<L>And make my song as soft and sweet as theirs.</L>

<L>To raise his fame, who only writes for thine;</L>
<L>I'd sing such notes, as none but you can teach,</L>
<L>And none but one who loves like me can reach.</L>

<L>THUS young <HI>Achilles,</HI> in <HI>Bithynia's</HI> court,</L>
<L>Had made a private, and a long resort:</L>
<L>Drest like a maid, the better to improve,</L>
<L>With his fair princess, undiscover'd love.</L>
<L>Where hours and days, he might secure receive</L>
<L>The mighty bliss that mutual love could give.</L>
<L>Where in full joy the youthful pair remain'd</L>
<L>And nought a while but laughing pleasures reign'd.</L>
<L>'Till at the last, the gods were envious grown,</L>
<L>To see the bliss of man surpass their own.</L>
<L>All <HI>Greece</HI> was now with <HI>Helen's,</HI> rape alarm'd,</L>
<L>And all its princes to revenge her arm'd.</L>
<L>When spiteful pow'rs foretold them their desent</L>
<L>Would be in vain, unless <HI>Achilles</HI> went.</L>
<L>In vain they might the <HI>Phrygian</HI> coast invade.</L>
<L>Scale <HI>Troy</HI> in vain, no onset could be made,</L>
<L>That should succeed without that hero's aid.</L>
<L>And now <HI>Ulysses</HI> by a crafty sleight.</L>
<L>Had found him out in his disguise's spight,</L>
<L>Who, tho' betray'd by his unhappy sate,</L>
<L>Had too much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> honour to retreat.</L>

<L>She to her late discover'd lover flew,</L>

<L>All this, and more, the lovely mournful maid,</L>
<L>Told the sad youth, who sigh'd at all she said.</L>
<L>Yet would he not this resolution break,</L>
<L>Where all his fame and honour lay at stake.</L>
<L>Now would he think on arms; but when he gave</L>
<L>A side-long glance on her he was to leave,</L>
<L>Then his tumultuous thoughts began to jar,</L>
<L>And love and glory held a doubtful war.</L>
<L>'Till with a deep-drawn sigh, and mighty course</L>
<L>Of tears, which nothing else but love could force,</L>
<L>To the dear maid he turns his wat'ry eyes,</L>

<L>Curse on that artifice by which I fell,</L>

<L>To thee the glory of the bloodless field.</L>
<L>With liquid fires, melt the rich beauties down:</L>
<L>Rifle thy wealth, yet give thee all my own.</L>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF PYGMALION:</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Imitated from the Tenth Book of OVID's <HI>METAMORPHOSES.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>HOW art thou envy'd? let <HI>Pygmalion</HI> prove;</L>
<L>Who by a miracle obtain'd his love:</L>
<L>Who living in an age, when women led</L>
<L>The lewdest lives, all shame and honour fled:</L>
<L>For a long time declin'd the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uptial bed.</L>
<L>He saw them all debauch'd with monstrous crimes,</L>
<L>No virtuous maid, no <HI>Delia</HI> bless'd the times.</L>
<L>Had she liv'd then, his skill had ne'er been shewn,</L>
<L>Nor the strange miracle that crown'd it known.</L>
<L>There had he fix'd, nor form'd his fancy'd maid;</L>
<L>Not fondly been by his own art betray'd.</L>
<L>The nymph in polish'd iv'ry glitter'd bright.</L>
<L>So smooth, she seem'd too slipp'ry for his sight.</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o curious was her shape, so just her frame.</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o quick here eyes appear'd so full of flame,</L>
<L>They would have roll'd, if not restrain'd by shame.</L>
<L>From his strong art, the statue had receiv'd</L>
<L>Such lively strokes, one would have thought it liv'd</L>
<L>Ev'n he himself could hardly, hardly know,</L>
<L>But doubting long, whether it liv'd, or no.</L>
<L>Yet from her, as she was, he gather'd fires:</L>
<L>And fierce and boundless were his mad desires</L>
<L>He felt her flesh (his fancy thought it such)</L>
<L>And fear'd to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> with too rude a touch.</L>

Presents her now, with all he thought might please,</L>
<L>With precious gums distill'd from weeping trees.</L>
<L>Small singing birds, who strain their tuneful throats,</L>
<L>And hov'ring round, repeat their pretty notes.</L>
<L>With sweetest flow'rs he crowns her lovely head,</L>
<L>And lays her on the softest downy bed.</L>
<L>In richest robes his charming idol drest,</L>
<L>Bright sparkling gems adorn her neck and breast,</L>
<L>And she—look'd well in all, but look'd when naked best.</L>
<L>Now <HI>Venus</HI> kept her feast; a goodly train</L>
<L>Of love-sick youths frequent, and fill her fane.</L>
<L>The snow-white heifers fall by sacred strokes,</L>
<L>While with rich gums the loaded altar smokes.</L>
<L>Among the rest, the hopeless lover stands,</L>
<L>Tears in his eyes, his off rings in his hands;</L>
<L>More furious than before he feels his fires,</L>
<L>Ev'n his despair redoubles his desires.</L>
<L>A long, long time, his orisons deferr'd,</L>
<L>He durst not pray, left he should not be heard.</L>
<L>'Till urg'd by love, his tim'rous silence broke,</L>
<L>Thus (but still tim'rously) at last he spoke.</L>
<L>If you, ye sacred pow'rs that rule above,</L>
<L>And you, great goddess of propitious love;</L>
<L>If all we want is plac'd within your pow'r,</L>
<L>And you can give whatever we unplore:</L>
<L>Exert you god-head now, now lend your aid,</L>
<L>Give me the wife! I wish, one like, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e said,</L>
<L>But durst not say, give me my iv'ry maid.</L>
<L>This finish'd; thrice auspicious flashes rise</L>
<L>And wreaths of curling smoke ascended <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></L>
<L>Half hoping now, and yet still half afraid,</L>

<L>And closely clasps her in his longing arms.</L>
<L>When all at once, with joy and wonder fill'd,</L>
<L>He feels her stubborn sides begin to yield.</L>
<L>Soft was her bosom grown, her throbbing breast,</L>
<L><PB N="169" REF="047526_0167_1023BF3B9417F390"/>
Heav'd with her breath, swell'd gently to be prest.</L>
<L>Surpriz'd, and glad, he feels her oft, and oft:</L>
<L>And more, and more, perceives her warm and soft.</L>
<L>Warm were her lips, and ev'ry pointed kiss.</L>
<L>With melted touches, met and moisten'd his.</L>
<L>Her blood now circled and her pulses beat,</L>
<L>And life at last enjoy'd a settled seat.</L>
<L>Slowly she lifts her new and fearful sight,</L>
<L>And sees at once, her lover and the light.</L>
<L>An unborn maid, both life and lover found;</L>
<L>And he too, had his desp'rate wishes crown'd.</L>
<L>Desp'rate indeed; what prospect could he see,</L>
<L>Or how at first, hope any more than me?</L>

<L>With awe and wonder, mixt with love and fear,</L>
<L>He stands as motionless as shame made her.</L>

<L>What fatal mischiefs jealousy may breed.</L>
<L>Hear that unhappy wretched huntsman tell,</L>

<L>Hear him, lamenting his mischance, complain</L>
<L>In the soft <HI>Ovid's</HI> sadly charming strain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Happy a while, thrice happy was my life,</L>
<L>Blest in a beautiful and virtuous wife.</L>
<L>Love join'd us first, and love made life so sweet,</L>
<L>We prais'd the gods, that 'twas our lot to meet</L>
<L>Our breasts glow'd gently with a mutual flame,</L>
<L>The same were our desires, our fears the same.</L>
<L>Whate'er one did, the other would approve,</L>
<L>For one our liking was, as one our love.</L>
<L><PB N="179" REF="047526_0177_1023BF4CF801B520"/>
Then happy days were crown'd with happier nights,</L>
<L>And some few months roll'd on in full delights.</L>
<L>Joys crowded to appear, and pleasures ran</L>
<L>A while in circles, e'er our woes began.</L>
<L>'Till I one fatal morn the chace pursu'd</L>
<L>Of a wild boar, thro' an adjacent wood:</L>
<L>Where, as I hunted eager on my prey,</L>
<L><HI>Aurora</HI> stop'd me in my hasty way.</L>
<L>You may believe I do not dare to feign,</L>
<L>(For mis'ry never made a man so vain)</L>
<L>She, tho' a goddess, straight began to move</L>
<L>A fruitless suit, and vainly talk'd of love.</L>
<L>Tho' she look'd bright as when she shines on high,</L>
<L>In all the glories of a morning sky;</L>
<L>Tho' earlier than the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>un's, her beams display,</L>
<L>And shew the first approaches of the day:</L>
<L>I told her <HI>Procris</HI> all my soul possest,</L>
<L>That she alone reign'd sov'reign of my breast,</L>
<L>Which never would admit another guest.</L>
<L>Enjoy thy <HI>Procris</HI> then, the goddess cry'd;</L>

<L>Stung with her words, with doubts and fears opprest,</L>
<L>A sudden jealousy destroys my rest,</L>
<L>Mads all my brain, and poisons all my breast.</L>
<L>I thought the sex all false, ev'n <HI>Procris</HI> too.</L>
<L>Again I thought, she could not but be true.</L>
<L>Her youth and beauty kindled anxious ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</L>

<L>I thought her faith too firmly fix'd to fall.</L>
<L>Yet a true lover is afraid of all.</L>
<L>I knew not what to think, but straight I go,</L>
<L>Resolv'd to cure, or to compleat my woe.</L>
<L>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> habit diff'rent from my own I took.</L>
<L>Which with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> aid <HI>Aurora</HI> chang'd my look</L>

To <HI>Athens</HI> straight, unknown to all, I came,</L>
<L>Ev'n to myself I scarce could seem the same.</L>
<L>Hardly I got admission to my house,</L>
<L>But far, far harder to my weeping spouse.</L>
<L>The house itself from ought of blame was free.</L>
<L>And ev'ry place exprest its grief for me.</L>
<L>A dismal silence reign'd thro' ev'ry room.</L>
<L>To mourn my loss, already safe at home.</L>
<L>Ev'n that sad pomp of woe, some charms could beast,</L>
<L>But when my <HI>Procris</HI> came, she charm'd me most.</L>
<L>Black were her robes, her solemn pace was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>low,</L>
<L>Her dress was careless, yet becoming too.</L>
<L>A virtuous grief dwelt deeply in her face.</L>
<L>But matchless beauty gave that grief a grace.</L>
<L>Whole show'rs of tears her streaming eyes let fall,</L>
<L>Yet something wond'rous lovely shone thro' all.</L>
<L>Scarce could I at the charming sight forbear</L>
<L>From running to embrace my mournful fair,</L>
<L>Scarce hold from telling whom she law (tho' alter'd there)</L>
<L>But yet at length, my first design pursu'd,</L>
<L>With words I flatter'd, and with gifts I woo'd?</L>
<L>All the most moving arguments I us'd,</L>
<L>Oft pray'd, and prest, but was as oft refus'd.</L>
<L>She said another had before ingross'd</L>
<L>All her affections, and my suit was lost.</L>
<L>would any but a mad-man further try?</L>
<L>But ah! that mad, that desp'rate fool was I.</L>
<L>I grew the more industrious to destroy</L>
<L>Her matchless truth, and ruin all my joy.</L>
<L>Redoubled presents, and redoubled vows.</L>
<L>I made, and offer'd to betray my spouse.</L>
<L>At last, her stagg'ring faith be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to yield,</L>
<L>And I'd just won the long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>.</L>

She, at these words, almost of sense bereav'd,</L>
<L>With sad confusion found herself deceiv'd.</L>
<L>Fix'd on the ground, she kept her downcast eye,</L>
<L>And silence with her shame made no reply.</L>
<L>But to the mountains like a huntress hies,</L>
<L>And for my sake from all mankind she flies,</L>
<L>Which when I found, abandon'd and alone,</L>
<L>My dearer half thro' my own folly gone;</L>
<L>Love fiercer than before began to burn,</L>
<L>'Till I was raging for my wife's return.</L>
<L>My pray'rs dispatch'd with eagerness and haste</L>
<L>That she would pardon all offences past;</L>
<L>Found her as kind as she was truly chaste.</L>
<L>She came and crown'd my joys a second time;</L>
<L>Forgot my jealousy, forgave my crime.</L>
<L>'Twas then I thought my greatest mis'ries o'er,</L>
<L>But fate it seems had worse, far worse in store.</L>
<L>Soon as each early sun began to rise,</L>
<L>To glad th' enlighten'd earth, and gild the skies,</L>
<L>I with his first appearance rise, and trace</L>
<L>The woods, and hills, that yielded game to chase.</L>
<L>Alone I hunt, a long and tedious way,</L>
<L>And seldom fail to kill sufficient prey.</L>
<L>Then spent with toil, to cooler shades retreat,</L>
<L>And seek a refuge from the scorching heat.</L>
<L>Where pleasant valleys breathe a freer air,</L>
<L>For my refreshment I address this pray'r,</L>
<L>Come, air, I cry, joy of o'er-labour'd swains.</L>
<L>Come, and diffuse thyself thro' all my veins;</L>
<L>Breathe on my burning lips, and fev'rish breast.</L>
<L>And reign at large an ever-grateful guest.</L>
<L>Glide to my soul, and ev'ry vital part,</L>
<L>Distil thyself upon my panting heart.</L>
<L>By chance I other blandishments bestow,</L>
<L>Or destiny decreed it should be so;</L>

<L><PB N="182" REF="047526_0180_1023BF5702075920"/>
Thou, who dost nature's richest sweets excite,</L>
<L>And mak'st me in the desert woods delight:</L>
<L>Breathless, and dead without thee should I be,</L>
<L>For all the life I have, I draw from thee.</L>
<L>While thus I sung, some one who chanc'd to hear.</L>
<L>Thought her a nymph, to whom I made my pray'r,</L>
<L>And told my <HI>Procris</HI> of her rival air.</L>
<L>She, kind, good soul, half dying at the news,</L>
<L>Would now condemn me, now again excuse.</L>
<L>Now hopes 'tis all a falsehood, now she fears;</L>
<L>Suspects my faith as I suspected hers.</L>
<L>Resolv'd, at last to trust no busy tongue,</L>
<L>But be herself the witness of her wrong;</L>
<L>When the next day with fatal haste came on,</L>
<L>And I was to my lov'd diversion gone,</L>
<L>She rose and sought the solitary shade,</L>
<L>Where, after hunting, I was daily laid.</L>
<L>Close in a thicket undiscern'd she stood,</L>
<L>When I took shelter in the shady wood.</L>
<L>Then stretching on the grass my fainting weight,</L>
<L>Come much-lov'd air, I cry'd oh! come abate</L>
<L>With thy sweet breath, this most immod'rate heat.</L>
<L>On this a sudden noise invades my ear,</L>
<L>And rustling boughs shew'd something living there.</L>
<L>I rashly thinking it some savage beast,</L>
<L>Threw my unerring dart with heedless haste,</L>
<L>Which pierc'd, O gods! my <HI>Procris</HI> thro' the breast.</L>
<L>She at the wound, with fearful shrieking fell,</L>
<L>And I alas! knew the dear voice too well.</L>
<L>Thither distracted with my grief I flew,</L>
<L>To give my dying love a sad adieu.</L>
<L>All bloody was her lately snowy breast,</L>
<L>Her soul was hast'ning to eternal rest.</L>
<L>With rage I tore my robe, which close I bound,</L>
<L>To stop the blood, about the gaping wound.</L>
<L>What pardons did I beg? what curses frame,</L>
<L>For my damn'd fate that was alone to blame?</L>
<L><PB N="183" REF="047526_0181_1023BF5885ED3258"/>
When weakly raising up her dying head,</L>
<L>With a faint voice, these few sad words she said,</L>
<L>" Draw nearer yet, dear author of my death,</L>
<L>" Hear my last sighs, and snatch my parting breath.</L>
<L>" But ere I die, by all that's sacred swear.</L>
<L>" That you will never let my rival air,</L>
<L>" Profane my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, or find reception there.</L>
<L>" This I conjure you by your nuptial vow;</L>
<L>" The faith you gave me then, renew me now</L>
<L>" By all your love, if any love remain,</L>
<L>" And by that love which dying I retain.</L>
<L>" Assure me but of this before I go.</L>
<L>" And I shall bless thee for the fatal blow."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To her sad speech abruptly I reply'd,</L>
<L>In haste to shew her error ere she dy'd.</L>
<L>Quickly I ran the tragic story o'er.</L>
<L>Which made her pleas'd, amidst the pangs she bore.</L>
<L>That done, she rolls, in death her dizzy eyes,</L>
<L>And with a sigh, which I receiv'd, she dies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here did the youth his doleful tale conclude,</L>
<L>A tale too doleful to be long pursu'd.</L>
<L>But this ill-chosen instance will not do,</L>
<L>Unless my <HI>Delia</HI> could be jealous too.</L>
<L>But she, whene'er I woo some other fair,</L>
<L>Shews no resentment, and betrays no care.</L>
<L>She sees me court another, as unmov'd,</L>
<L>As she has always seen herself belov'd,</L>

<HEAD>The PASSION of SCYLLA FOR MINOS.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>FROM THE Eighth Book of <HI>OVID'</HI>s <HI>Metamorphoses</HI></BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>A TOW'R with sounding walls erected stands,</L>
<L>The sacred fabric of <HI>Apollo's</HI> hands.</L>
<L>His harp laid by, the strings their airs dispense,</L>
<L>And vocal stones receiv'd their virtue thence.</L>
<L>This <HI>Scylla,</HI> in the time of peace, ascends,</L>
<L>And thence her look o'er all the lawn extends:</L>
<L>Now with delight she views the spacious town,</L>
<L>Now, pleas'd with dropping little pebbles down,</L>
<L>Strikes a sweet music from the warbling stone.</L>
<L>In times of wars the self-same prospect yields,</L>
<L>The pleasing horror of the bloody fields;</L>
<L>Long had they now in equal balance hung,</L>
<L>And doubtful victory depended long.</L>
<L>This gave her leisure to discern and know</L>
<L>The sev'ral leaders of the neighb'ring foe.</L>
<L><HI>Minos,</HI> their gen'ral, most of all she knew,</L>
<L>More than a virtuous virgin ought to do,</L>
<L>Whether his helmet glitter'd form afar,</L>
<L>And with its waving feathers threat'ned war;</L>
<L><PB N="186" REF="047526_0184_1023BF62810BBEF8"/>
Whether his hands, the shining sword would wield,</L>
<L>Or hi strong arm raise his refulgent shield;</L>
<L>Whate'er she saw him do, she prais'd and lov'd,</L>
<L>And kept him still in view, where e'er he mov'd.</L>
<L>When e'er he shook a spear, or cast a dart,</L>
<L>She knew not which excell'd, his strength or art.</L>
<L>When e'er he drew a shaft, she'd swear, that so</L>
<L>Ev'n <HI>Phoebus</HI> would himself discharge his bow.</L>
<L>But when his naked visage he disclos'd.</L>
<L>His charming face to public view expos'd;</L>
<L>When on his foaming horse he rode the plains,</L>
<L>Ruling with skilful hands, the stubborn reins;</L>
<L>Then like tempestuous seas her passions roll,</L>
<L>Mad her sick brain, and rack her troubled soul.</L>
<L>Happy, she calls the courser which he press'd;</L>
<L>Happy, the lance he couch'd within his vest</L>
<L>Happy, the vamplate that secur'd his breast.</L>
<L>Now would she think of flying to the foe,</L>
<L>And would have gone, had she a way to go.</L>
<L>Now, headlong form the tow'r herself have sent,</L>
<L>And ventur'd life, to reach her lover's tent.</L>
<L>Open the brazen gates, when love inspir'd,</L>
<L>Or act what e'er the foe she lov'd desir'd,</L>
<L>Silent she sat with a distracted look,</L>
<L>Till passion gave her leave, and then she spoke.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In this unhappy war, and fatal strife,</L>
<L>I know not which to yield to, joy or grief.</L>
<L>Tho' 'tis my fate to love my country's foe,</L>
<L>I had not seen him, had he not been so.</L>
<L>Yet might they let their fierce contention fall,</L>
<L>And making peace, make me the pledge for all.</L>
<L><HI>Minos</HI> and I once join'd, our wars might cease,</L>
<L>And that alliance fix a lasting peace.</L>
<L>Well might our mother's charms a god subdue,</L>
<L>If ever she could charm dear nymph like you.</L>
<L>Happy! thrice happy had I wings to fly</L>
<L>To yonder tents, where the lov'd foe does lie.</L>
<L><PB N="187" REF="047526_0185_1023BF6403AAF700"/>
I'd tell the dear disturber of my rest,</L>
<L>All that I feel, could it be all express'd,</L>
<L>And pour my soul into the charmer's breast.</L>
<L>Give all I can to make him once my own,</L>
<L>All he would ask, all,—but my father's crown.</L>
<L>This love shall cease, these fierce desires shall die,</L>
<L>E'er I by treachery my wish enjoy.</L>
<L>Yet when a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> foe disputes the field,</L>
<L>It is not safest to resist, but yield.</L>
<L>The tragic dest<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oy of his darling son,</L>
<L>Has brought at last these fatal mischiefs on.</L>
<L>In a just cause his vengeful sword he draws,</L>
<L>Strong is his army to maintain his cause.</L>
<L>Needs must my charming hero prosp'rous prove,</L>
<L>Then let him owe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> conquests to my love.</L>
<L>Thus thousands must be sav'd who else must bleed,</L>
<L>And daily perish, if the wars proceed.</L>
<L><HI>Minos,</HI> wilt thou be safe, and I be blest;</L>

<L>Some rash u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>owing hand his spear may dart</L>

<L>My country, and myself, one gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> I'll join,</L>
<L>And make the merit of his conquest mine.</L>
<L>To will is nothing, when we can't fulfil,</L>
<L>For wretch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> want of pow'r, the things we will.</L>
<L>The gates are kept with a sufficient guard,</L>
<L>And ev'ry night my father sees them barr'd.</L>
<L>'Tis he destroys my bliss; 'tis him I fear;</L>
<L>Would he were with the dead, or I were there.</L>
<L>Might I (not inj'ring him) my bliss pursue?</L>
<L>Indulgent gods! but why invok'd I you?</L>
<L>We our own gods, have pow'r ourselves to bless,</L>
<L>And form ourselves, derive our own success.</L>
<L><PB N="188" REF="047526_0186_1023BF66DB3E5998"/>
The only way to prosper is to dare.</L>
<L>For fortune listens not to lazy pray'r.</L>
<L>Others enflam'd with such a fierce desire,</L>
<L>Have forc'd thro' all, to quench their raging fire.</L>
<L>Shall any other then more res'lute prove?</L>
<L>Thro' fire and sword I'll force my way to love.</L>
<L>Yet to assist me here, I need not call</L>
<L>For fire, or sword: my father's heir is all.</L>
<L>That, that must crown my joys and make me blest,</L>

<LG>
<L>THY bounties, LOVE, in thy soft raptures when</L>
<L>Timeliest the melting pairs indulge, and how,</L>
<L>Best to improve the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mal joy, how shun</L>
<L>The snakes that under flow'ry pleasure lurk,</L>
<L>I sing: if thou, fair <HI>Cytherea,</HI> deign</L>
<L>Gracious to smile on my attempt Tho' thou</L>
<L>None of the muses nine, yet oft on thee</L>
<L>The muses wait, oft gambol in thy train,</L>
<L>Tho' virgins. Come, nor leave the <HI>Boy</HI> behind,</L>
<L>Blind but unerring archer, <HI>Hymen,</HI> raise</L>
<L>Aloft thy sacred torch. Your gifts I sing.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ye youths and virgins, when your gen'rous blood</L>
<L>Has drunk the warmth of fifteen summers, now</L>
<L>The loves invite; now to new rapture wakes,</L>
<L>The finish'd sense: while stung with been desire,</L>
<L>The madd'ning boy his bashful fetters bursts;</L>
<L>And, urg'd with secret flames, the riper maid,</L>
<L>Conscious and shy, betrays her smarting breast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet nature not in all her sons maintains</L>
<L>An equal progress. This with kindly warmth</L>
<L>concocts to manly vigour straight; while that</L>
<L>Pines, crude and chill, and scarce at last attains</L>

Imperfect life. Some slight their varnish'd steed.</L>
<L>And (wondrous instinct!) bent on manlier sport.</L>
<L>Cope with the maids. <HI>Alcides</HI> thus, they say,</L>
<L>Rose brawny from his cradle, while the snakes,</L>
<L>Hung hissing round him, horrible and fell,</L>
<L>Sent by enrag'd <HI>Saturnia</HI> to destroy</L>
<L>Her rival's hope: the mighty infant grasp'd</L>
<L>His speckled foes, and smiling dash'd them down</L>
<L>To hell, their native clime; the spumy gore</L>
<L>Blotted the frighted pavement. Early thus</L>
<L>Was future chivalry presag'd.—Meantime</L>
<L>Others slow ripen: men there are who scarce</L>
<L>Feel the soft thrillings of untaught desire,</L>
<L>While pallid maids scarce ruminate on man.</L>
<L>Till twenty; well if then. It boots thee much</L>
<L>To study the complexion, much the clime,</L>
<L>And habitudes of life. Meanwhile with me</L>
<L>Credit these signs. The boy may wrestle, when</L>
<L>Night-working fancy steals him to the arms</L>
<L>Of nymph oft wish'd awake, and, mid the rage</L>
<L>Of the soft tumult, ev'ry turgid cell</L>

<L>Bland and of azure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inct▪ Nor envy thou</L>

<L>Sagely th' alarming case.—The rising down</L>

<L>This sign obtains. For nature provident</L>
<L>Now when both sides stand equal for the fray,</L>

<L>Of propagation, and domestic charge,</L>
<L>Or soft encounter more attract, renounce</L>
<L>The vice of monks recluse, the early bane</L>
<L>Of rising manhood. Banish from thy shades</L>
<L>Th' ungen'rous, selfish, solitary joy.</L>
<L>Hold, Saticide, thy hand! for thee alone</L>
<L>Did nature form thee? for thy narrow self</L>
<L>Grant thee the means of pleasure? dream'st thou so?</L>
<L>That very self mistakes thy wiser aim;</L>
<L>Its finer sense ungratify'd, unpleas'd,</L>
<L>But when from active soul to soul rebounds</L>
<L>The swelling mingling tumult of delight.</L>
<L>Hold yet again, ere idle callus wrap</L>
<L>In sullen indolence th' astonish'd nerves;</L>
<L>When thou mayst fret and tease thy sense in vain,</L>
<L>And curse too late th' unwisely wanton hours.</L>

Thousands; she sees are noble, wise and brave,</L>
<L>Th' enamour'd poet is no vulgar slave;</L>
<L>And mine th' applause that pride herself might chuse;</L>
<L>The muse of <HI>Edwin</HI> is no common muse.</L>
<L>Severely chaste. she walks erect and bold,</L>
<L>Unstain'd by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>latt'ry, undebauch'd by gold;</L>
<L>Not poorly barter'd, nor at random giv'n.</L>
<L>Her praise is hoarded for th' elect of heav'n.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O friend of man! O last and dread repose!</L>
<L>Dear sacred harbour from the storm of woes.—</L>
<L>O when shall death—Alas! I vainly rave—</L>
<L>Sure I shall love thee ev'n beyond the grave.</L>
<L>From pangs to pangs the weary spirit cast,</L>
<L>Midst changeful woes may find its passion last.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Deluded wretch, no more pursue the flame</L>
<L>That draws thee wide from ev'ry noble aim,</L>
<L>Blasts thy fair hopes, and vain existence fills</L>
<L>With dreams of good, and certainty of ills.—</L>
<L>Where now the gen'rous toils that warm'd thy youth?</L>
<L>The path of science, and the light of truth?—</L>
<L>O shame of manhood!—Reason wakes my soul.—</L>
<L>I tear thy chains, I spurn thy base controul.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That heav'nly smile!—my fondly changeful mind!</L>
<L>What hope would whisper—<HI>Clara</HI> may be kind.</L>
<L>Deluded novice!—poor believing child!—</L>
<L>The fondest wretch that woman e'er beguil'd!—</L>
<L>Behold the creature of thy high command,</L>
<L>The pliant wax beneath thy forming hand;</L>
<L>No more, my <HI>Clara,</HI> shall thy slave rebel,</L>
<L>No more complaints, my vain despair farewel;</L>
<L>The star of <HI>Venus</HI> in th' ascendant tow'rs.</L>
<L>There <HI>Clara</HI> sits, and guides the smiling hours;</L>
<L>With peace and love she fills the gladsome sphere,</L>
<L>And rising good and beaming hopes are there.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Strange pow'r of woman! with what high controul</L>
<L>A smile or glance can take the prison'd soul,</L>
<L>And hurl it far from reason and from rest;</L>
<L>Or toss it like a loaf within the breast!</L>

<HEAD>1.</HEAD>
<L>MY fruitless love, with many a lavish'd song.</L>
<L>And altars, grac'd thee midst th' immortal throng;</L>
<L>Ungrateful maid! neglected and forlorn,</L>
<L>I stand the mark for all thy shafts of scorn;</L>
<L>Ungrateful maid, thy fierce contempt deplore,</L>
<L>With sighs of living flame, and tears of streaming gore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>2.</HEAD>
<L>When my fond numbers would conceal her hate,</L>
<L>And snatch her beauties from oblivious fate,</L>
<L>From pole to pole when <HI>Clara's</HI> praises sound,</L>
<L>Ungrateful maid! she mocks the am'rous wound.</L>
<L>Her single word a healing balm might show'r,</L>
<L>Yet she that word withholds, and vaunts her cruel pow'r.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>3.</HEAD>
<L>Dear galling yoke, which I must never rend!</L>
<L>Dear cruel maid, whom pray'rs must never bend!</L>
<L>By one last blow, my hand, fulfil her doom,</L>
<L>And rest, my sorrows, in eternal gloom!</L>
<L>Thou wretch, at once thy chains and life resign;</L>
<L>With courage worthy love, and worthy charms divine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>4.</HEAD>
<L>Tremendous pow'r, thou demon pale deform,</L>
<L>Who ne'er art call'd, but when the gather'd storm</L>
<L>O'er life is spread, nor hope remains below,</L>
<L>Despair, I call thee to relieve my woe!</L>
<L>O come, thy kindly cruel aid impart:</L>
<L>Teach me to heal the pangs that gnaw my bursting heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>5.</HEAD>
<L>Come, ghastly phantom, with thy direful band.</L>
<L>Come, guide the stroke with unrelenting hand.</L>

O bring me peace, and close my weary days,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pomp of death my settled woe dismays.</L>
<L>Since <HI>Clara's</HI> eyes withdraw their cheering light,</L>
<L>The genial beams of heav'n but pain my aching sight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>5.</HEAD>
<L>I see thee come▪ with horror in thy train,</L>
<L>Affliction, phrenzy, rage, despair, and pain;</L>
<L>Devouring flames and swords around are seen,</L>
<L>The baneful aconire, and poniard keen.</L>
<L>That set sad <HI>Pyramus</HI> from anguish free,</L>
<L>And gave to <HI>Caro's</HI> soul its darling liberty.</L>

<L>That angry heav'n defy, and fortune's hate;—</L>
<L>I see the pangs for me reserv'd by fate,</L>
<L>And shame the wrath the ling'ring purpose chide,</L>
<L>"O fly, thou wretch, from life, nor future woes abide."</L>
</LG>

<L>Yes, I will die, to g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d thy savage heart.—</L>
<L>Receive the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of thy cruel art.—</L>
<L>Yes, thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> see,—no longer mock my pain,—</L>
<L>I burst the prison of thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> disdain.</L>
<L>When pity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to balm the lover's wound,</L>
<L>The rest of death remains, and poison may be found.—</L>
