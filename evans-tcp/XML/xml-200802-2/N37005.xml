<Q><HI>For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of re∣joicing? are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE second coming of Christ is a source of peculiar joy and consolation to the people of God: it is a day in which their hopes and expectations will be fully answer∣ed. Tribulation attends the good man while in this life; the scenes of divine provi∣dence are mysterious, and many things un∣accountable and insignificant without a day of judgment; they will▪ then be explained and adjusted to the joy and admiration of all who love Christ's appearing. Many of the events that take place in this life, stand in a solemn relation to the judgment day, and none more so than the gospel ministry; hence it is that the attention of the true servants of Christ is so much taken up with a future state. St. Paul being detained from the Church of Thessalonica▪ sends this epistle as a token of his love and respect to them; in which he anticipates that blessed period, when he should meet them at the bar of Christ, which would afford such joy and satisfaction as to more then compensate for all their sorrow, more especially for his being prevented a per∣sonal inteview with those to whom he wrote. <HI>For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of re∣joicing? are not even ye in the presence of
<PB N="4" REF="048467_0003_102515EDF5C6B940"/>
our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?</HI> We have two very important ideas suggested in the words. One is, that ministers and their people must meet each other at the day of judgment.—The second is, that although ministers are often separated from their hear∣ers in this life, yet the people of God among whom a pious preacher finish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s his work, will be a cause or crown of peculiar joy and satisfaction at the second coming of Christ.</P>
<P>With respect to the first point we may observe, to give us a striking contrast between this and the coming world, we are in the present state subject to many vicissitudes.</P>
<P>What changes are taking place in em∣pires, states, societies, and families? In noth∣ing is this more observable than in matters relating to ministers and the people of their charge. A persecuting spirit, that prevailed in the apostolic age, was often a mean of par∣ting friends, and especially of driving preach∣ers from churches: the same cause has had influence in every age of the church; but if religious societies are so happy, as to escape such a calamity, yet it pleases the Great Head of the church in his sovereign wisdom, to sepa∣rate ministers and their people by death; this gives feeling to a pious preacher, and in some degree has influence in every sermon he delivers. That all mankind will be collected before the bar of Christ, to see the great and intricate affairs of the universe adjusted, is a plain dictate of reason and scripture; but that
<PB N="5" REF="048467_0004_102515FDC91082C8"/>
many will meet there as having mutual con∣cerns with each other, is evident.—More especially, ministers and the people once com∣mitted to their charge, doubtless will appear in some sense as distinct societies, as having particular and personal matters to attend to.—This supposes that they will have a knowledge of each other: for without this the purposes of their meeting in such a man∣ner could not be answered. How far this will extend, or by what means it will be conveyed, is too curious to enquire. It seems, unless we are able by some means to distinguish those from others with whom we have been intimate in this life, the designs of a future judgment will in some measure be frus∣trated. The great end of that day is to illus∣trate divine truth, or make that appear con∣spicuous to created intelligence; to effect this, God will make use of mankind as instru∣ments; this is the method he takes in this life, and doubtless it will be most eligible in the world to come. For our acquaintance to be summoned as witnesses for or gainst us at this court, will perhaps be the best means to administer conviction. In this way the great God can speak in language easy for finite creatures to understand. One design of the world, being divided into distinct societies and communities, is doubtless to prepare matters for the day of judgment. The re∣lation between ministers and people is such as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enders them capable of saying much a∣bout each other; in this way the justice and mercy of God will be illustrated, divine pro∣ceedings
<PB N="6" REF="048467_0005_1025160AAB9B5C50"/>
vindicated, and every mouth stop∣ped. It is our conduct in this life that will direct divine proceeding towards us at the fi∣nal judgment; that the equity of God's ad∣ministrations may appear, 'tis necessary that our characters be clearly investigated. The salvation and damnation of many souls will be through the instrumentality of faithful and unfaithful watchmen: this is an idea contained in the charge God gave to Ezeki∣el, 32d Chapter. It will be necessary that the motives by which ministers have been influenced in their work, be brought out to view: for without sincerity of heart they can never execute their office with any degree of true faithfulness, and are an high affront to God, and a vile imposition on the people.</P>
<P>At the day of judgment the <HI>doctrines</HI> with which a minister has entertained his hearers must be examined. However, doctrinal preaching may be discarded by many and such words as <HI>metaphysical abstruse,</HI> &amp;c. are of∣ten made use of to obstruct free and candid enquiry. Yet it is evident that one great end of the gospel ministry is to disseminate right sentiments; hence it is that Paul so of∣ten exhorts Timothy to take heed to his <HI>doc∣trine.</HI> Sound doctrine, as well as good prac∣tice is necessary to constitute the christian character; whosoever transgresseth and abid∣eth not in the <HI>doctrine</HI> of Christ hath not God, 2 John, 9.</P>
<P>A careful inquiry will be made whether an

empty parade of learning, elegancy o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, &amp;c. have been the main things with which a people have been entertained; tending on∣ly to gratify vain curiosity, and to fix the at∣tention of the hearers on the Speaker. This made St. Paul contemn such a mode of preach∣ing, and determine not to know any thing save Jesus Christ, and him crusified, 1. Cor. 2. 2. Whether vague equivocal expressions have been used to convey, or rather to ob∣scure the truths of the gospel; by which any thing, and almost every thing may be under∣stood. This is causing the trumpet to give an uncertain found; &amp; has no tendency to im∣press, or give feeling to the mind, as is the case with the words of the wise, being as <HI>goads</HI> and <HI>nails,</HI> Eccle. 12. 11.—Whether to please men has had greater influence in our composing and deliver our sermons and the glory of God and the good of souls. People will be examined at the bar of Christ, wheth∣er they have not been dealt plainly with—Been told their characters and danger—That they are wholly opposed to God, destitute of every thing that is holy, or morally good.—That they are by nature under the curse of God's law, exposed every moment to endless woe—That they are hopeless and helpless in themselves—The necessity of the renewing influences of the spirit—The nature of their imputency, that it consists in an evil heart; that therefore they are altogether inexcusable, and are criminal in proportion to the degree of their inability—That nothing short of re∣pentance towards God, and faith in the Lord
<PB N="8" REF="048467_0007_1025163478A98610"/>
Jesus Christ, is the immediate duty of all that hear the gospel.</P>
<P>Ministers and their people must meet be∣fore the Judgment Seat of Christ to give an account whether the true character of God has in any good measure been investigated—As a sin hating and sin revenging God—As one who in his sovereign wisdom and good∣ness has elected some to everlasting life, and others for the display of his power and justice to eternal death—That he governs all things by a fixed unalterable plan. That of him, and to him, and through him are all things.</P>
<P>Without this, the character of God is kept out of sight, people left in the dark, and ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not able to determine whether they love or hate the true God.</P>
<P>It must be known whether people have had the character and work of the Redeemer set before then—The design of his sufferings; the efficacy of his blood, and the necessity of our union to him. The manner in which divine truth has been delivered, will be a matter worthy of serious examination at that day; Whether with that earnestness &amp; servor, becoming the vast importance and so-solemnity of gospel truth, tending to effect the mind. The deportment, or examples of ministers among their people will be closely attended to: their private visits, exhortations and reproofs, holy desires and wrestlings for the souls of their hearers, will not escape
<PB N="9" REF="048467_0008_10251646C4B8ADE0"/>
public notice; the improvement that people have made of such advantages will be bro't into public view.</P>
<P>How often people have attended on the ministration of the word, and the manner how, will he matters of serious concern at the judgment day. Those excuses that men make for neglecting public worship, will be weighed in a just scale. Whether people have so far contributed to the temporal support of their ministers as to enable them to devote themselves to the service of Christ: or by too great neglect, have not obstructed the gospel, robbed God, wounded their own souls.</P>
<P>It will be useful that the <HI>time</HI> of a ministers continuance among a people be known, as it will serve to set the characters of gospel despisers in a true point of light. That min∣isters and the people of their charge will meet each other at the bar of Christ is sug∣gested in my text, and in other parts of the sacred writings.—It has already been obser∣ved, that in this way truth will appear con∣spicuous, and the conduct of God will be vindicated, and the designs of a judgment-day in the best manner answered. It may further be observed, that the matters relating to the gospel ministry are of such magnitude that it appears important that they be attended to; they concern a judgment day, and an e∣ternal state. When ministers and people meet in the house of God it is an acknowl∣edgment
<PB N="10" REF="048467_0009_1025168C0B8C3128"/>
that they believe in a future state of retribution, and is a sort of appeal to the day of judgment. The influence of a faith∣ful, or unfaithful minster is such as to effect unborn ages; it will commonly determine the sentiments and characters of their suc∣cessors; and in this way they may be doing good or evil after they are dead and even to the second coming of Christ. That God's ha∣tred towards false teachers, and against those who choose them, together with their crimi∣nality may appear, it will be necessary that these matters are laid open at the tribunal of Christ.—As a proof of the matter under consideration I may only add: That there al∣ways has been an important controversy in a greater or less degree between ministers and part of their people; it is so with faithful preachers and some of their hearers; wicked men oppose the doctrines they preach, and will not be convinced. Unfaithful preach∣ers, they have advocates and opposers; the dispute involved the character of Christ, it cannot be settled in this world: how neces∣sary that ministers and people meet at the great day, to have the matter decided, the doctrines of Christ vindicated, and the char∣acters of ministers or people exonerated?</P>
<P>II. Another important idea contained in the text is, That the church, or people of God, among whom a faithful minister finishes his work, will be a cause, or crown of pecu∣liar joy or rejoicing at the coming of Christ. It will be matter of great satisfaction to set
<PB N="11" REF="048467_0010_1025169795CAD798"/>
down with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and other saints at that day; but the scriptures represent that godly ministers will derive peculiar joy from the pious part of their congregations. Dan. 12. 3, 2. Cor. 1. 14. Phil. 2. 16. Reflecting on past providences, will be a source of great joy at the day of judgment: and as many things have taken place between a minister and his people in which they are more particularly conversant and interested, when they come to be ex∣plained, it will afford special joy and admira∣tion, as they have been companions in tribu∣lations, so now it is likely they will be in a more peculiar sense co-partners in joy, and help each other in magnifying the Lord for special favors, and displays of divine power and grace on their behalf.</P>
<P>The prayers &amp; struggles of pious teachers have been for Zion in general, and for those over whom the Holy Ghost has made them over∣seers in particular: Now God will give their hearers who have been converted through their instrumentality as a kind of reward and fruit of their travel or labor. When it ap∣pears that God has made use of the true min∣isters of Christ for the conversion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> some of the souls once committed to their charge, it will excite wonder joy, and humility in the minds of pious teachers, that God should deign to honor them as instruments of such glorious work, by which they will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led to adore sovereign grace, and condescending love. As it is often through the painful la∣bors
<PB N="12" REF="048467_0011_102516A8F5CAACF8"/>
of Christ's servants that souls are bro't home to God, doubtless he will approve of such virtues by confering signal honors on such who have turned many to righteous∣ness, who will shine as stars forever and ev∣er.</P>
<P>Pious people will give such account of their faithful teachers as will meet with ap∣probation of God, which will be expressed by that heavenly plaudit. "Well done good and faithful servant! Their mutual accounts will be given up with joy, and not with grief, Hebrews 13. 17. The hopes and ex∣pectations of such ministers are great, as the apostle suggests in the text—For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? are no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> even ye? &amp;c. He speaks of it as the earnest hope and expectation of all Christ's ministers, by calling it <HI>our</HI> hope. They reflect with pleasure on the approaching happy moment, and when it comes it will greatly gratify their holy desires.</P>
<P>That it will be possible to hold equal communion with all the saints, especially at one time in the invisible world, perhaps is not admissible. It appears that the wicked, who have been associates in sin here, will be companions of torments hereafter, Luke 16. 28.</P>
<P>They are to be gathered like the standing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orn, and to be bound in <HI>bundles</HI> to burn.—It is more than possible that the righteous
<PB N="13" REF="048467_0012_102516BF78B0D140"/>
who have lived together in this life, will have a more intimate access to each other in the world to come.</P>
<P>If it will be useful for them to meet in some sense as distinct societies, perhaps it will subserve the interest of the universe that they in a degr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee continue so—It is the character of the true church of Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t that they treat his ministers with respect in this life, accounting them as the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God, 1. Cor. 4. 1. They help them in their work, 2. Cor. 1. 11. God will in the great day re∣ward people for such kindness; as hereby they express their love to Christ, Mat. 25. 40. This will gratify the benevolent feelings of Christ's servants; at the same time fill them with holy admiration, and deep humility, that what has been done to such poor sinful creatures should be taken notice of.</P>
<P>Ministers and the people of their charge will assist each other, and be united in bring∣ing a verdict against the wicked and impeni∣tent, among whom they lived while on earth. The saints are to judge the world, 1. Cor. 6. 2. One way by which they will do this, will doubtless be to declare before angels &amp; men that they know about them, or their conduct <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n this life. An attachment to divine justice will make this delightful work. Ministers just declare what and how they have preach∣ed to them, and the bad improvement they
<PB N="14" REF="048467_0013_102516CD5A10CE48"/>
have made of the gospel, so far as it has come under their observation; how they have despised and mocked the messengers of the Lord, contemned his word and ordinances. Pious hearers can witness to the same things, and in this way the mutual testimony of god∣ly ministers and people will be strengthen∣ed and supported, and divine proceedings a∣gainst impenitent sinners vindicated. Thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a crown of joy to her faith∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪</P>

<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. WE may infer from this subject, that the gospel ministry is of God, and that we ought to seek its welfare, and use suitable ex∣ertions for its support.</P>
<P>Does scripture and reason dictate that it is of so much importance, especially as it re∣lates to a judgment day, we may con∣clude that God would not do without it, and we may see divine wisdom and goodness in the institution. Nothing more conducive of divine glory, and salutary to men, than the preaching of the gospel.—Without these glad tidings are proclaimed, the Incar∣nation of Christ is vain. Nothing but oppo∣sition to God, and disregard to his glory, will make them indifferent to the preaching of the gospel. A rejection of Christ and his ministers, have commonly vice, and open prophanity, for their inseparable companions. The opposition that the impenitent part of
<PB N="15" REF="048467_0014_102516DA53B86A88"/>
mankind have made to the servants of Christ, has doubtless in some measure had its rise from a consciousness that they must meet them at the bar of Christ, to their disadvan∣tage.</P>
<P>We may conclude that since the gospel ministry is so very useful, that it will be con∣tinued to the end of the world.</P>
<P N="2">2. When a faithful minister is taken away it ought seriously to be regarded. But few ways perhaps that God shews greater dis∣pleasure against a people than in calling his am∣bassadors home. By this he threatens to put an end to his treaty of peace, and become irre∣concilable. It may sometimes be the case that God has no more chosen or elect ones among them. When Paul and Barrabas were preaching at Antioch, as many as were <HI>ordained</HI> to eternal life, believed, then they departed, Acts 13. All the encouragement for a minister to preach among a people, so far as the salvation of souls ought to be a mo∣tive, is the doctrine of election. After the death of a faithful minister there is less hope of a people.</P>
<P>We may further observe, when it is con∣sidered, that we are to meet them no more in the house of God, to hear them declare unto us the words of reconciliation; but our next interview will be at the tribunal of Christ, to hear them testify, for or against us, how affecting the consideration! It is more solemn to die than if we had never been favored
<PB N="16" REF="048467_0015_102516ED49BDED50"/>
with the gospel ministry. People, whether they hear, or forbear, shall know to their joy, or sorrow, that there hath been a proph∣et among them, Ezek. 2 5.</P>
<P N="3">3. The subject affords <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> direction how ministers should preach, and how a people ought to hear, viz. with death and judg∣ment in view. It is this that makes preach∣ing and hearing a serious matter, and renders the house of God so very solemn. We must soon meet before the bar of Christ, and per∣haps before the next Sabbath, to have our sermons and our hearing examined, by him who is infinite in knowledge, and is present in every congregation. Did we always con∣sider these things, it would tend to abolish that coldness, drowsiness and indifference, that too often attend the ministers of the gospel, and that formal spirit which is too apparent among hearers. How would it check that levity of mind, and disorderly behaviour, that presumptuous creatures often indulge in the house of God. <HI>How dreadful is this place!</HI>—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a reflection suitable on all occcasions, and more especially when we meet for public devotion.</P>
<P N="4">4. The surviving widow and children will for a moment suffer the word of exhortation. Are not you in some sense his hope and joy? Was it not a reflection that tended to smooth the rugged road through death, that he should meet you before the bar of Christ, and that you would be a crown of rejoicing in that
<PB N="17" REF="048467_0016_102517018B52C5F0"/>
day? If ministers and people are to meet each other before the tribunal of Christ, as having special business together, then we may conclude that this will be the case with particular families, such as husbands and wives, parents and children; you can say much about each other upon that occasion, having for so long a time composed one fami∣ly on earth.</P>
<P>You, who are this day called to mourn▪ must give an account how you have im∣proved his public and more private admo∣tions: &amp; especially this providence. The pre∣sent occasion, however solemn, will appear more so at the great day. Consider, that although he is gone to return no more, yet God the source of consolation ever lives—His promises are always new to the widow and fatherless. That God who gave, has ta∣ken him away. But still he lives in another state, and is more useful to the universe, than he could be in this world. God's people always die in the best time, manner, and place. You have only time to take up the body and bury it, set your houses in order, &amp; follow him. Manifest your love to the de∣ceased by preparing to meet him, and make his heart glad in the day of the Lord Jesus. Contemplate the rectitude of divine government, and a future world, and b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> still.</P>
<P>Let the children remember, that to have pious faithful parent taken away, is an un¦speakable
<PB N="18" REF="048467_0017_1025171168773508"/>
loss. Your father has done much for your bodies, but we trust more for your souls; never, never forget his prayers and admonitions. Can you, dare you meet him at the bar of Christ in impenitence? Should this be the case, instead of those endear∣ing and parental caresses that you have r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ived from him in this life, be will join with the judge of all in saying, <HI>depart!</HI> He will declare what he has done for you▪ and condemn you. Let your mother experience that tender regard and kind assistance, dur∣ing her short continuance with you, as be∣comes dutiful obedient children. Make her heart glad by a holy life, and let your father live daily before her eyes, in your pi∣ous examples.</P>
<P>Let me say a word to the Church, and congregation in this place:—Dear Friends, I am not a stranger to those mournful sensa∣tions that the present melancholy prov∣idence tends to inspire. I trust I am a hear∣ty mourner with you, and am a share in your loss.</P>
<P>By the foregoing observations you have eason to conclude that you have lost a faith∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ul minister.</P>
<P>You can't forget those solemn &amp; affectionate warnings that he has given you from the desk: Nor those pious examples he has set before you. He has preached his last sermon. Your next meeting must be before the tribunal of Christ, where those sermons you have heard him
<PB N="19" REF="048467_0018_10251721A619FB88"/>
deliver in this life, will come to view, and the improvement you have made of them. Will you, my brethren, be his crown of re∣joicing in that day? If you were his hope and joy in this life, you doubtless are still. It is with satisfaction we trust that he this moment looks foward to that day, when he expects to see this the dear people once committed to his charge; and doubtless he hopes to meet some of you as crowns of rejoicing. Oh! do not disappoint the hope, and expectations of your Rev. Pastor. Manifest your love to him by imitating his holy examples, and by having those heavenly instructions, that he so often inculcated, always in remembrance; &amp; by preparing to give him joy in the day of the Lord Jesus. Examine what improvement you have made of the gospel ministry while you had it: and whether too great inattention has not had influence in its being removed. Have you ever experienced the power and efficacy of the gospel upon your own souls▪ Have you by the holy spirit been formed in∣to the moral likeness of the blessed God, and into the image of his son Jesus? Or have you been contented with the mere form of God∣liness? Have you not through sloth and un∣belief, neglected attending on the preaching of the gospel, during the residence of your pastor among you? Oh! what account will such gospel despisers have to give another day! Consider, I intreat you, how dreadful it will be to have these things bro't into view, when you come to meet your ministe▪ who was once, &amp; perhaps is now an eye-w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ess of your

<P>Your minister, though dead, now speak∣eth. He preaches a most solemn lecture to us all this day on mortality.</P>
<P>You will, as it were, hear his voice when you look on the place of public worship, where he and you so often attended—When you look on his grave, which is here among you—and when you look to the second com∣ing of Christ.

<HEAD>MEMOIRS OF THE LIFE OF THE REV. ABRAHAM CARPENTER.</HEAD>
<P>HE was born on the 23d of Sept. 1739▪ at Rehoboth, Massachusetts: was son of Mr. Abiel Carpenter of that place; who was a man of piety and industry; by which means his family received a religious education▪ the fruit of which was conspicuous in his children, especially in his son, the subject of these me∣moirs, who dates his conversion in the 23d year of his age, when he became a member of the church under the pastoral care of the Rev. Mr. Rogerson. He was married to Miss Elizabeth Bliss, daughter of Mr. John Bliss of Rehoboth, in his 21st year. They had ten children, four sons and six daughters; their mother and six children only survive.</P>
<P>In his 24th year he moved to Killingsly, in Connecticut, where he resided eight years, and commenced a preacher of the gospel.—Soon after he removed to Plainfield, N. Hamp∣shire, where he had a call to settle in the work of the gospel ministry, which he ac∣cepted; and continued pastor of a church there for 15 years, and was much esteemed by his people and acquaintance.</P>

with a great depreciation of numbers in the church, an ecclesiastical council was called, and for the reasons above, thought it expedient to dismiss him from his pastoral relation to that people.</P>
<P>The church at the same time cordially u∣nited in <Q>Recommending him, as one who had approved himself able and faithful in his work, during the time of his having exer∣cised the pastoral care of the church among them.</Q> The council at the same time con∣curred with the church in recommending their pastor, so far as their acquaintance would admit. This appears from a result of coun∣cil left among Mr. Carpenter's papers. He removed to Rutland, State of Vermont, March 13 1789, and was again settled in the work of the ministy, and discharged the du∣ties to which he was called, to the great sat∣isfaction of his people, and gained the love and esteem of all who knew him. But few give greater evidence of this love to Christ and the souls of men, than Mr. Car∣penter, both in his public ministry, and private deportment. He always discovered that sim∣plicity and chearfulness, mixed with christian sobriety, as endeared him to all his acquaint∣ance, to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se especially with whom he con∣versed, we may say without flattery, that he was a rare example of piety. His health evi∣dently began to decline several months before his death, which at times impeded his pub∣lic ministry—Love to his divine master and to the souls of men, often urged him on be∣yond his strength. For some weeks before

his death, he was much troubled with a billious disorder, to which he had been much subject, which greatly debilitated his constitution, but had in some measure recovered; when he was seized with a violent <HI>diarrhoea,</HI> which carried him off on the evening of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> August, 1797, in his 58th year. He was speechless for some time previous to his exit; but while able to speak, manifested the most placid resignation to the will of God; earnestly exhorted others to prepare for death; He said, <HI>he had no will as to living or dying, but chos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to submit the matter to that God, to whom belong the issues of life and death, that the great truths that he had preach∣ed to others, were those on which he could now venture his soul for eternity, that he had no de∣sire to out-live his usefulness.</HI></P>
<P>We trust he has fallen asleep in Jesus.</P>
