<HEAD>Introduction.</HEAD>
<P>THIS treatise prescribes plain, safe, and easy means for persons in every capacity, and to cure themselves of most, if not all the most grievous and dangerous disorders our country is incident to, and with very little charge; the medicine being chiefly this country growth, and on every man's plantation; and those that are imported are cheap, and may be had from almost every Doctor and Apothecary's shop, so that every man may get and keep the imported ones by him, and send his son or servant and get and prepare them of our own growth; by which means he may be cured, if cura<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le,</P>
<P>"But many shapes of death, and many are the ways that leads to his grim cave; dismal, yet to sense more terrible at the entrance than within, some as thou sayest by violent stroke shall die. By fire, flood, famine; by intemperance more in meats and drinks which on the earth shall bring diseases dire! And Doctors still more terrible." Milton.</P>
<P>The most acceptable service we can render to God, is beneficience to man. There are three ways of benefitting our fellow-creatures; we may be useful to their souls by good instruction and example; we may be helpful to their bodies by feeding the hungry, and cloathing the naked; we can aid them in their fortunes by encouraging industry, and prescribing easy remedies to the sick; and in this we shall relieve the distressed;
<PB REF="048490_0003_10254c224fbd6b40"/>
which in a word is doing all the good we can to our fellow-creatures. These are the ways of improving our talents, which God has entrusted us with; and we must expect hereafter to give an account how we have employed them.</P>
<P>I wish it were in my power to serve mankind more than I do, but alas! Vain wish: how often did I publish in the Virginia Gazatte in the time of the great distress of the Flux, (I believe in the year 1773) and two hundred and sixty-four receipts I had printed, and gave out in the year 1774; from which instructions numbers have testified of the good received, both in being pre∣served from catching, as well as well as being restored to perfect health, when beyond all hopes of recovery, which gave me great encouragement to write; but the troubles of the late war, and being in an unsettled situation, has prevented one, though it▪ has laid long and heavy on my mind: yet I have put it off till now, I pray God it may be accepted and blest of him, of which I make no doubt as he so graciously accepted the widows mite. I publish this treatise to lead the poor in the pleasant path of health, and when they have the misfortune to be sick, to shew them the cheapest, easiest, safest, and best way to get well again.</P>
<P>The lower part of our country are subject to more disorders than the upland, there being so many swamps, marshes, bogs, and the over∣flowing of fresh water rivers, from which pro∣ceeds fogs, a damp air, with loathsome and bad scents, from which proceed agues, and followed with long inward fevers, dropsies, coughs, pleurasy, consumptions, and with many others which the upland is not so subject to; yet our upland is not exempt from all disorders; for be∣cause of swearing, the Land mourneth, sayeth
<PB REF="048490_0004_10254c26e6685620"/>
the good old prophet Jeremiah many hundred years ago: so our upland is afflicted as well as the low, and with the rheumatism, fluxes, can∣cers, and with a dismal train of other disorders which make a sad havock all over our states. Is it possible to see these calamities rage without the tenderest compassion? Surely, what can be more melancholy than to have so many poor people perish for want of using timely means for their preservation? They neglect to take any re∣medy till their case is grown desperate, and death begins to stare them in the face. They consider not that a moderate skill may recover them in the begin∣ning of a distemper while he has strength to go through all the necessary operations, but when the whole college should not be able to save him after his spirits are sunk, and all the principles of life are nearly extinguished.</P>
<P>This unhappy distemper occasions a great deal of mortality, and what makes the misfortune the greater, is, that it falls heavier on the younger sort who are most liable to harringing distempers. Indeed some would be glad of assistance if they did not think the remedy nearly as had as the disorder; for our doctors are so exorbitant in their fees whether they kill or cure, that the patient had rather trust to his constitution than run the risque of beggaring his family:</P>
<P>These considerations made me, count it a work of charity, and public spirit to communicate to these extensive states, and particularly the poor the method of curing themselves when they shall fall into any of our common disorders. For their great encouragement, the remedies I shall pre∣scribe may be procured at little trouble and ex∣pence, being for the most part such as grow on their own plantations, or may be easily procured.</P>
<P>Providence has been so good as to furnish al∣most
<PB REF="048490_0005_10254c28697aaed0"/>
every country with medicines proper for the distempers incident to the climate, and such domestic remedies are always sufficient for the cures of such disorders, if a right use be made, with the blessing of God. Their cases are seldom compleated, but proceed for the most part from cold, or such slight transgressions in such ail∣ments; the symptoms cannot easily be mistaken, nor is the cure difficult: all the secret lies in taking the distemper in time, and this will be the most necessary, because most disorders that happen from cold, are exceedingly violent, and call aloud for speedy assistance. Always remember, that the sooner any disorder is taken in hand, the easier the cure; because nature is strong and able to co-operate with the medicines they take—nor can we hope, that Heaven will assist us in our calamities unless we endeavour at the same time to assist ourselves.</P>
<P>In setting down the following prescriptions, I have been cautions of not talking like an Apo∣thecary, that is, of using hard words that per∣haps neither my patient nor I my self understands, not have I taken them lightly upon trust, but I am able to recommend most of them upon more than thirteen years experience; for the rest I have creditable authority for. In the mean time, I hope none will object like Noeman, the Syrian, to the easiness of any of these remedies; but rather rejoice that any can have so great a bles∣sing, so very cheap; and in truth people must love difficulty extreemly well to slight health for being gained with little for my own body, being sickly brought me easily into a capacity to know that health was the greatest of all earthly blessings▪ and truly he was never sick that doth not believe it than first I studied the human body, and secondly, I considered that all medicines
<PB REF="048490_0006_10254c2c5de774e0"/>
were compounded of herbs, roots, barks, flower, and seeds and this first let me to work in studying the nature of simples; most of which I knew by sight before. Then I consulted with my two brothers, Doctor Reason, and Doctor Experi∣ence, and took a voy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge to visit my mother Na∣ture, by whose advice, together with the help of Doctor Diligence, and the blessing of the God. I at last gained my desire, and being warned by Mr. Honesty, a stranger in the present days, to pub∣lish it to the world, I have done it.</P>
<P>But, you will say, what need had I to have wrote on this subject when so many famous and learned men have wrote so much already. To this I answer of a truth; much have been wrote, but in so high a style, that the poor could not understand it; and I write for the poor, yet I make no doubt but the rich will be glad to make use of this treatise for many of the disorders that are herein mentioned, the Doctors call incura∣ble; and besides, if the rich send for the Doctor very time a child or a servant is sick, it will take their whole income: and what then will pay their taxes, and cloath them? Secondly, before the Doctor could be got, perhaps the pa∣tient might die, and if not he might suffer greatly.</P>
<P>There are many parts that there is no Doctor to be got at all; now you see a reason for it: a reason it is said, makes a man differ from a beast, because out of thy thoughts God should not pass his image stamped, is on every weed and grass if you please to make use of this little treatise. I make no doubt but it will answer your desired effect; and then I am sure you will not think your money thrown away, nor spent in vain; but I hope you will give all the praise to God, which is the ardent wish of the public's friend and humble servant.</P>

The patient is generally costive and feverish, though sometimes neither; but a griping in the bowels or stomach, and sometimes shooting into different parts of the body, shoulders, and back. For this grievous complaint, take as follows: the inside of white oak bark, the inside of poplar root, root bark of each, one small handful, the same of woods ditiny, properly called bitiny, put these in two gallons of water, and reduce it over a slow fire to one; then bottle it up for use: of this take a teacup full as hot as you can drink it, adding to it fifteen drops of the compound spirits of lavender: if it doth not give ease in five or six minutes, take a second in like manner, and also to the third, which will certainly give ease; but to root out the disorder entirely, take the same medicine about three times a day for three orlour weeks; living only on what is fresh, light and easy of digestion, and abstaining from spirituous liquors during said time.</P>

When discovered, give a tea spoonful of the spirits of camphire, with twenty drops of the compound spirits of lavender, three or four times

This will cure, if taken in time; but if the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ux should return after the purge is worked off, and the patient should be much griped, take a tea-spoonfull of common snake root, the same of ginger, the same of calamas, (called by some cin∣namon flag) and the same of poplar root bark, all in fine powder; put them in a half pint of rum or brandy, and a half pint of water, sweeten it with loaf sugar, and give the patient every time he is griped a tea-cup fall as hot as he can drink it, which will immediately give ease. When the griping is quite stopped, take one handful of white oak bark, the same of poplar root bark, of the inside, and one handful of woods bitiny, boil them in two gallons of water till reduced to one, give the patient a tea-cup full blood warm four or five times a day for three days; then take one handful of sweet gum root, one do. of presimmon bark, the inside, one do. of red root, boil them in two gallons of water till reduced to one, and give in like manner as in the above mentioned decoction till well. Yet if the patient finds no amendment in four or five days, but grows worse at night, let him eat a slice of cheese; then give one grain of gum opium made in a pill with brown sugar: after taking this pill, perhaps the patient will rest all night; in the morning let the patient eat a little thickened milk and bread, and another slice of cheese; then give one grain of opium, again continue this three days; then let it alone twenty-four hours to see if the lax is stopt; if it is not stopt, give one grain of the opium in like manner night and morning till well: opium will as when the pre∣paration of the gum roots will not.

<P>It is good for every person strictly to watch their children when they are getting well of the flax when it draws near the full or change of the moon, for the worms are apt to rise and kill the child, perhaps when thought out of all danger, which may be known by a hacking cough, or the child often putting the hand to his throat, or complaining of something choking them. In this case, give the child without delay, a tea-spoonfull of the juice of sage, or the same of the juice of tausey or wormwood eight or ten times a day, till the danger is over; for I have cause to believe that as many children die by the worms in the flux, or on the first full or changing of the moon is die by the flux.</P>

cold weather keep it warm, if the bone breaks through the skin, so that it cannot be got in again saw it off, and then put in the remaining part carefully, observing that the limb is straight, then add to the above mentioned egg and vinegar a little tincture of mirrh, to heal the outward wound.

<HEAD>FEVERS.</HEAD>
<P>In all fevers if the patient should be costive, called in common bound; it is expedient to give a glister, which may be prepared thus: boil creeping mallows in clean water, sweeten it with brown sugar or molasses, add to this a little hogs grease,</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="048490_0054_10255334e3f323e8"/>It is expedient that every house-keeper, should keep by him a lancet, clister-pipe, and sullenger, that the time may not be spent in getning them, at ought to be spent in using them.</P>
<P>Thus: having gone through the most of the common complaints, to which the inhabitants of our states are subject to, and prescribed such safe and easy cures, as will generally succeed if timely applyed. Yet I am far from pretending that any of them are infallible, we all know that death strikes so strong in some cases, that all physick are in vain; yet if curable and you will follow these directions, you need not doubt a cure, in the mean time I make no question, but some of my brothers Quacks will make themsel∣ves merry with these prescriptions; remember well what the wise man sayeth, I said of laughter i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and of mirth it is a folly! —Again, some men are so proud and invious, that they would have no body to know any thing but them∣selves, the one I hope will shortly learn better manners, and the other be a burden too heavy for the earth long to bear. Tho' after all, it is not impossible that they may do by some of these medicines, just as the English do by the French fashion, laugh at them first, and make use of them afterwards. The within mentioned dis∣orders, are the most fatal and troublesome we are afflicted within these states. I have been as short as I could, the remedies I have prescribed are almost all of our own growth, there being very few imparted medecines, and them are so cheap, that if it happens to not cure my patient, I am sure it will not ruin himself, and surely man cannot say, he does very unfairly, when there is so little to pay, either to the doctor or apothicary; neither do I make my patients belly an apothicary's shop.</P>
