<Q><BIBL>11. SAMUEL, iii.38.</BIBL>
<P>KNOW YE NOT THAT THERE IS A PRINCE AND A GREAT MAN FALLEN THIS DAY IN ISRAEL?</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>YOU cannot hear these words, my Brethren, without thinking of an event, which, as the tidings of it fly from one messenger to an∣other, from one city to another, and from one state to another, spreads a gloom throughout this widely extended continent, and throws a whole nation into the deepest mourning. Like the shock of an earth∣quake, or thunder from heaven, sudden and unex∣pected, we have heard the alarming intelligence, that WASHINGTON <HI>is dead.</HI>—What concern and grief overwhelm the minds of all virtuous citizens! In our American Israel <HI>is fallen a prince,</HI> eminent and distinguished above all the other princes of the age; a man <HI>great</HI> in whatever can contribute to the ex∣cellence, dignity, and greatness of the human char∣acter, above all the other great men who dwell upon the face of the earth. Since the exit of the inspired leaders of God's ancient Israel, it may be doubted, whether, among the generals, heroes, and statesmen, who have since passed over the stage of life, and filled the world with the glory of their names and ex∣ploits, so finished a character as the father of his
<PB N="6" REF="038170_0004_10111465638BFDA8"/>
country, whom we this day lament, has departed from these regions of mortality.</P>
<P>At all times, and through every age, a few men are distinguished from the common mass of their species, and, as compared with others, are denomi∣nated great. On account of eminence in several dif∣ferent respects, this appellation is given. In vulgar ap∣prehension, great riches and power entitle their pos∣sessors to be called great men. Speaking of Abner, David, in the text, calls him <HI>a prince and a great man,</HI> because he was exalted, not only above his fellow-citizens in general, but above all the other high of∣ficers under the crown, having been, through a great part of his life, captain of the host, entrusted, under Saul, and afterward under his son, with the chief command of the armies of Israel. In this high sta∣tion, he was universally known; and had acquired a weight of character, and an extent of influence, in the affairs of the nation, beyond that of any other citizen. His fall "must have inspired every mind with grave and serious reflections. <HI>A great man fallen!</HI> and fallen by so unexpected and so surprising a treachery; and in the eye of a great revolution, seemingly dependent upon his fate!" Yet it must be remembered, that his was a worldly greatness only, without any mixture, or, at least, predominance of real goodness. This great man had deliberately op∣posed himself to the known will of the great God; and had sported with the lives of his brethren. He was not ignorant of the divine designation of David to the throne of Israel; yet, through motives of in∣terest and ambition, had <HI>made himself strong for the house of Saul.</HI> Putting himself at the head of this nu∣merous and powerful faction, he commenced a civil war; and, for a series of years, compelled the nation
<PB N="7" REF="038170_0005_10111468746F08E0"/>
to endure its calamities. "It is true, that he was now returned to his duty; but it is as true, that he returned to it now, as he departed from it before, upon a pique, and from motives of ambition, interest, and revenge." By such principles was this captain of the host influenced, even in his best actions, and when he projected schemes for the public peace and prosperity. Still he was a great man in the estima∣tion of the world, and had the power of a prince among the tribes of Israel.</P>
<P>SIMILAR to his, has been the character of no small proportion of the great men of the earth, through every successive age. From the bustle and noise which they have made in the world; from their victories and triumphs; from the changes and revo∣lutions which their counsels or exploits have effected in the affairs of states and nations, they have been denominated great. History informs us of Alexan∣der the great, of Pompey the great, of Charlemagne, Lewis the fourteenth, and the late Frederick; but when their characters are analyzed, the principles and motives of their conduct are scrutinized, what are they better than the great man in the text? They stand, it is true, as on an eminence, above the rest of their species, the objects of general homage and admira∣tion. The glory of their names, and the splendor of their achievements, are preserved in the annals of history, and handed down with eclat from one gen∣eration to another. We are dazzled with the lustre that surrounds them. When thus viewed at a dis∣tance, we admire their abilities, the vastness and ex∣tent of their schemes, their reach of thought, their penetration, their quick discernment of every advan∣tage, their dexterity in seizing it; their perseverance, intrepidity, and success. But, upon a closer inspec∣tion
<PB N="8" REF="038170_0006_1011146C1CEEC0E8"/>
of their characters, of their governing princi∣ples and views, the tendency of their plans, and the nature of the means by which they were prosecuted, our reason and judgment must withhold from them the approbation of the heart. We see these great men pursuing the same kind of policy, and influenced by the same passions and interested views, so apparent in the conduct of Abner. Whether they meditated peace or war, the tranquillity or disturbance of the world, the prosperity or devastation of countries; still interest, ambition, or revenge was their leading motive. While they governed nations and com∣manded armies, it often appeared, that they had no command over themselves. After gaining victories, taking citadels, and subduing countries, by <HI>having no rule over their own spirits,</HI> by setting no bounds to their ambition and cupidity, their minds resembled the ruin which they had spread, <HI>a city broken down and without walls,</HI> constantly exposed to the ravages of ex∣orbitant desires and lawless passions.</P>
<P>BUT though this want of self-government has been the common defect in the character, not only of the great heroes and conquerors of the world, but of its great politicians and statesmen, by whose counsels the affairs of nations and empires have been directed; yet, through the mercy of God, there have been some exceptions, some who have been <HI>good</HI> as well as great, whose great abilities have been accompanied with great virtues; and who have risen to eminence and distinction by the joint display of both. At the head of armies, and at the helm of government, there have been some, who, in the height of their elevation, amidst all the allurements of interest, pride, ambition, and sensuality; while covered with glory, invested with power, and abounding in wealth, have
<PB N="9" REF="038170_0007_1011146FB6E836A0"/>
yet shown themselves able to control their passions, to moderate their desires, to forego all selfish views, and preserve a character for piety, benevolence, dis∣interestedness, justice, meekness, temperance, purity; in short, for whatever is amiable, lovely, and praise∣worthy in religion, morals, and manners. Amidst the greatest difficulties, embarrassments, and dangers of their public stations, their minds have been supe∣rior to fear, to mean compliances, unworthy conces∣sions, or dishonourable expedients. Firm and con∣stant to the principles of rectitude and patriotism, they have uniformly conducted with integrity and uprightness. The vicissitudes of fortune effected no change in their character or manners: they were the same, both in prosperity and in adversity. Un∣dismayed at the most formidable prospects, and un∣contaminated amidst the strongest temptations to corruption; no bribe could seduce them, no terror could overawe them. They were never melted by pleasure into effeminacy, nor sunk by misfortunes into despondency. In every situation, they steadily persevered in discharging what they apprehended to be their duty, without being swayed by the applause or censures of the world, when these would have se∣duced them from following the dictates of con∣science. Though they were far from despising the opinions of their fellow-men, yet, considering them∣selves accountable to God, and making his approba∣tion their chief and ultimate aim; in comparison with this, it was <HI>a small thing with them to be judged by man's judgment.</HI> It was their great concern to be faithful to the Being whom they devoutly worship∣ped, and to the principles of the religion which they seriously and sincerely professed. Abounding in be∣nevolence towards mankind in general, they were faithful to their friends, generous to their enemies,
<PB N="10" REF="038170_0008_10111473051B9248"/>
easily touched with compassion for the poor, the un∣fortunate and distressed; apparently insensible to lit∣tle ill offices towards, and uncandid strictures upon, themselves; often self-denying with respect to smaller private interests and pleasures, but always zealous and ardent in whatever concerned the public welfare. In their private deportment and public conduct, they displayed dignity and magnanimity, without pride; humility, without meanness; justice, without par∣tiality, harshness or severity; liberality, without pro∣fusion; courage, without rashness or presumption. With a nice sense of propriety, they did every thing in the best manner, and at the most suitable season. Wary and circumspect, though not artful or design∣ing, they were wise and penetrating in discovering and eluding the snares of enemies and opponents; sagacious and prudent in foreseeing and guarding a∣gainst dangers and accidents; never exposing them∣selves, or the cause with which they were entrusted, to any risk, detriment, or embarrassment, which could be decently and honourably avoided. Com∣posed on the greatest occasions, and respectable on the least; they were simple in their manners, though manly in their feelings. Their looks never deceiv∣ed; their word inspired confidence; their professions were always the effusions of their hearts.</P>
<P>CHARACTERS, like these, my brethren, will bear the closest scrutiny. The more minutely you ex∣amine them, the more rigidly you try them by the test of reason, truth, and rectitude, the more you will be constrained, in your hearts, to admire, reverence, esteem, and love them. The lustre of their most splendid actions, instead of being lessened, is height∣ened and increased by taking into view, the excel∣lence of their motives.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="038170_0009_1011147651EA78B8"/>SOME such characters, my hearers, through the different ages, and among the different nations of the world, have exalted and adorned human nature, and shed a benign influence on human affairs. So sel∣dom, indeed, has been their appearance, that they have been mere phoenomena in the earth. With such a phoenomenon, however, in its most full and perfect state, it has pleased the Almighty to bless, honour, and distinguish the inhabitants of this new world, above all modern nations. Nay, I do not re∣member to have read in any volume of profane his∣tory, whether ancient or modern, nor even in the fictions of romance, of a single character so exempt from every spot of vice, every shade of weakness or indiscretion; so complete in the abilities of a General, in the talents of a Statesman, in the virtues of a Cit∣izen, and, in all other respects, equal to Him, who, at the call of his country, headed our armies through the long series of trying scenes, which attended our revolution; whose influence saved our all from be∣ing lost by division; held together, or, at least, was the most important tie in preventing the disjunction and dissolution of the first slender and ill-cemented union of these states; who presided on the great oc∣casion, when, by an ameliorated national compact, they were consolidated; when the admirable machine of our present general government was constructed; who put this machine in motion, and, through the course of eight years, so guided its operations, as to enable his fellow-citizens fully to enjoy all its signal advantages; and after having retired, with the ut∣most dignity and honour, from the cares of state, to spend the short remains of life in preparation for its closing scene; foreign violence and intrigue, com∣bined with the turbulent, malignant spirit of domes∣tic faction, rearing their gorgon form, and menacing
<PB N="12" REF="038170_0010_1011147998E1CBF8"/>
the fair fabric which his labours had been so instru∣mental in raising, his patriotic ardour grew indignant; stepping back from his beloved retreat, he again bran∣dished his sword; and, with all the majesty of hea∣ven-inspired virtue, frowned on the rebel-rout of "demons let loose." At this awful juncture, Divine Providence removed him from a world no longer worthy of such goodness.</P>
<P>IT remains, that we mourn, as we ought, the fall of this great and good man in our Israel. Not for his sake personally, indeed, have we any occasion, or ought we, to lament. From his work of righteous∣ness on earth, he is released, that he may enjoy its reward in heaven. But for ourselves, and our coun∣try, we have abundant reason to weep, exclaiming at his departure, <HI>my father, my father! the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.</HI> To the living, the loss of such a treasure is incalculable. To him, the virtuous and good, all enlightened and true patriots, all the friends of real liberty, not only in America, but throughout Europe, looked up, as to a kind of head and exemplar; especially at the present eventful and alarming era, when the name of liberty, the rights of man, and the nature of good government, are so dreadfully misunderstood, and so horribly abused; when so heavy a cloud overspreads the civilized world, and the blind hurricane of revolution con∣tinues its devastation. Our own government had indeed, upon his retreat, devolved upon able and faithful men; but still he continued as a pillar for its support. The weight of his opinion, and the influ∣ence of his example, were highly important in the balance against the novel and strange opinions so pre∣dominant at the present moment. What may ensue upon the loss of such a prop, we cannot but be ap∣prehensive.
<PB N="13" REF="038170_0011_1011147CDD56A2A8"/>
We know it to be one of the methods of Divine Providence, when heavy calamities are in store for any people, previously to remove from among them, those who would stand in the gap, and be instrumental in warding them off. Previous to the misery and ruin of his ancient people, <HI>because their tongue and their doings were against the Lord,</HI> it was threatened, that <HI>the Lord, the Lord of hosts, would take away from Judah and Jerusalem, the mighty man, and the man of war; the judge and the prophet, the prudent and ancient, the honourable man and the counsellor.</HI> In fulfilment of this denunciation, a seemingly prema∣ture death was allotted to the eminently good Josiah, on purpose that so meritorious a character might no longer avert or delay the deserved punishment of a sinful people; and in mercy to himself, that he might neither know nor share in their miseries. It is mentioned as a proof, both of the guilt and stu∣pidity of the incorrigibly wicked, that <HI>they lay it not to heart; nor consider that the righteous are taken away from the evil to come.</HI></P>
<P>NOTHING, my brethren, can be more proper or reasonable, more prudent or interesting to ourselves, than that our grief and boding fears, on the present melancholy occasion, should induce us to forsake all our evil habits and practices; and rouse us to a sin∣cere repentance and thorough amendment. To this we are called by the voice of providence, not in a single event only, but by a continued series of awful dispensations. For a long time past, the judgments of Heaven, in their most tremendous form, have been abroad in the earth. We cannot hope ultimately to escape them, unless we speedily learn righteousness. To this, as the only way of safety, natural reason and conscience prompt us, and divine revelation most
<PB N="14" REF="038170_0012_101114824103F2E0"/>
earnestly exhorts us. In this way we are allowed to hope, that our peace and tranquillity may yet be lengthened out and prolonged.</P>
<P>WHEN we consider the absolute dependence of the universe of creatures upon its great Author; how he superintends all human affairs, changing times and seasons, suspending on high the invisible balance, containing the fates of nations, often giving to slight occurrences the power of turning this balance; of <HI>setting up kings and kingdoms,</HI> and then of <HI>putting them down;</HI> of <HI>enlarging and increasing the nations,</HI> and then <HI>of straitening them again;</HI> and that <HI>at what time he speak∣eth concerning a nation or kingdom, to build and to plant it, or to pluck up, pull down and destroy it;</HI> all shall be done according to his counsels; that all the commotions and revolutionary movements in every country, and among every people throughout the earth, with their hidden springs and causes, as well as their visible consequences and effects, are irresistibly controled and unerringly directed by his universal providence, so as exactly to accomplish the destinations of his will; when we think of these things, we cannot but feel how much it concerns us, both as individuals and as a nation, to be in a state of favour with this omnipotent Ruler.</P>
<P>IF we sin against him, he has many ways in which to make us feel the effects of his displeasure. It is not by death only, that he deprives such a people of their benefactors, of those good rulers who shield them from calamities. As it is he <HI>who giveth wisdom to the wise,</HI> and <HI>knowledge to them who know understand∣ing</HI> —who are <HI>skilful in the times,</HI> and in <HI>what Israel ought to do;</HI> as all the abilities of good rulers are from him, so he has threatened to withhold these blessings from a disobedient people, to infatuate their
<PB N="15" REF="038170_0013_1011148596E64630"/>
public counsels, rendering <HI>their diviners mad,</HI> causing <HI>the wisdom of their wise men to perish, and the understand∣ing of their prudent men to be hidden;</HI> suffering all their affairs, through intestine division and the violence of faction, to become embroiled, and to fall into such confusion, that there shall be <HI>no peace or safety to him that goes out, or to him that comes in.</HI> A sorer judg∣ment, or a greater misery, can hardly be conceived, than a people thus set loose from order and govern∣ment, and abandoned to the misrule of their passions and the rage of parties.</P>
<P>AMONG the many rich blessings, which Heaven has poured upon the people of these United States, through the medium of a WASHINGTON, one of the first magnitude has been our preservation from this misery. With what unwearied efforts, through the whole course of his public life, did he labour, night and day, to save us from being wrecked on this fatal rock? To the very last, he was so appre∣hensive of our continued hazard in this respect, that, in his farewell address, there is no other topic which he labours with such copious and persuasive elo∣quence. Indeed, it is the chief and main object of the address, to impress our minds with a sense of the infinite importance of our continued union; and to put us upon our guard against the causes and circum∣stances which may possibly occasion division. He tells us, that "the government, which constitutes us one people, is a main pillar in the edifice of our in∣dependence, the support of our tranquillity at home, our peace abroad; of our safety; of our prosperity; of that very liberty which we so highly prize." He warns us, that, "as this is the point in our political fortress, against which the batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly and actively
<PB N="16" REF="038170_0014_10111487293D7EC0"/>
(though often covertly and insidiously) directed, it is of infinite moment that we properly estimate the immense value of our national union, to our collec∣tive and individual happiness; that we cherish a cor∣dial, habitual, and immoveable attachment to it; ac∣customing ourselves to think and speak of it as the palladium of our political safety and prosperity; watching for its preservation with jealous anxiety; discountenan<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>g whatever may suggest a suspicion, that it can, in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> event, be abandoned; and indig∣nantly frowning upon the first dawning of every at∣tempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest, or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the various parts." In short, no dying father ever enjoined love and union upon his chil∣dren with more tender solicitude, more affectionate earnestness, or more pathetic anxiety.</P>
<P>NOW he is gone, forever gone, must not his sage advice, his most interesting, solemn, and paternal counsels, return upon the reflecting minds of a be∣reaved nation with redoubled force and energy, pen∣etrate all hearts, and have a permanent, a perpetual influence upon their conduct? Shall they not be handed down to posterity, as a legacy more precious than any other inheritance from the best of ances∣tors; and through successive generations, be regard∣ed with that filial reverence, and strict observance, with which the descendants of Jonadab, the son of Rechab, continued, through a course of ages, to obey the more abitrary and apparently less important in∣junctions of their father?</P>
<P>SUCH a deference to them in general will be se∣cured, if one part of them in particular, I mean that which urges the necessity of religious principle, be generally felt, and duly estimated. "Of all disposi∣tions
<PB N="17" REF="038170_0015_10111488B23A69E8"/>
and habits," says this venerable and unequalled patriot, "which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who would labour to subvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to respect and cherish them. A volume could not trace all their connexions with private and public felicity. It is substantially true, that morality is a necessary spring of popular govern∣ment. Reason and experience both forbid us to ex∣pect, that national morality can prevail in the exclu∣sion of religious principle." From such a personage, how important, especially in the present times, is this testimony to the usefulness and necessity of religion!</P>
<P>WHAT he here, by precept, so forcibly urges upon us, he has, in the most alluring and engaging man∣ner, exemplified in his own practice. On religious principle, as their grand basis, we have every reason to believe, his own great character, illustrious vir∣tues, and extensive usefulness, were built. No other foundation ever did, or can sustain so noble and fin∣ished a structure.</P>
<P>GREAT men, indeed, there have been, of whose religion we have yet reason to doubt. But from what were their greatness and celebrity derived? from the high station, perhaps, to which birth, court-fa∣vour, popular prejudice, corruption, usurpation, or even violence succeeded in raising them; from excel∣lence in some particular profession, art, science, or branch of knowledge; from a lucky discovery or useful invention; or, it may be, from the mere ca∣price of fortune, in making them her chosen favour∣ites; from some splendid action, which chance gave
<PB N="18" REF="038170_0016_101114901C0756B8"/>
them the opportunity of performing; from an occa∣tional display of abilities in a particular situation, or during a certain portion of their lives. Not a few have blazed forth for a moment, and received, for a while, the applause of the public; who have, after∣ward, dwindled and sunk into forgotten obscurity. But no man, I will venture to affirm, not animated and supported by religious principle, ever passed a long life of incessant labour in the highest public sta∣tions, diversified with ever varying and constantly trying scenes; and yet, through his whole progress, conducted with such wisdom, diligence, fidelity and disinterestedness, as uniformly to dignify and adorn each successive station, and every vicissitude of condi∣tion; reflecting to the last, a steady, undiminished lustre in the eyes of an admiring and applauding world.</P>
<P>MY brethren, it is incumbent upon us this day, with hearts glowing with gratitude, most devoutly to thank God, not only for the success and prosperi∣ty which he has already conferred upon our nation, through the instrumentality of its now departed friend, but for the great benefits which we may hope still to derive from the influence of that example of wisdom, patriotism, virtue, and religion, which, as his falling mantle, we still retain. What could have been more important to us, after our national and solid union under one general government, than the having of such a character for our first chief magis∣trate; the excellence of whose measures, counsels, and manner of administration, might serve as a model for his successors in office. Indeed, his dili∣gence, prudence, faithfulness, and integrity, are a model for all public officers, of every grade and de∣scription, from the highest to the lowest. In what
<PB N="19" REF="038170_0017_10111493C7A66F60"/>
he was, they may see what they ought to be. Nay, from the manner in which he presided at the head of the nation, we may all learn how we ought to pre∣side in our respective families, and maintain order, peace, unity, virtue, and religion, in our houses. In no way can we so honour his memory, as by the imitation of his virtues. This too will be the proper improvement of that melancholy dispensation of pro∣vidence which has removed him from us. If, as a people, we copy after that example of rectitude and goodness which he has set us, we may hope that Heaven will continue to bless us with a succession of rulers resembling him. But, what is yet infinitely more important to us individually, by this only can we have a rational hope of dwelling forever hereaf∣ter with him, and others like him, in the general as∣sembly <HI>of the spirits of just men made perfect. The memo∣rial of virtue is immortal. It is known with God and with men. When it is present, men take example at it; and when it is gone, they desire it. It weareth a crown and triumpheth forever, striving for undefiled rewards.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>FRIENDS AND FELLOW-CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE period for a new election of a citizen, to ad∣minister the executive government of the Uni∣ted States, being not far distant, and the time actually arrived, when your thoughts must be employed in designating the person, who is to be clothed with that important trust, it appears to me proper, espe∣cially as it may conduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice, that I should now apprise you of the resolution I have formed, to decline being con∣sidered among the number of those, out of whom a choice is to be made.</P>
<P>I beg you, at the same time, to do me the justice to be assured, that this resolution has not been taken without a strict regard to all the considerations apper∣taining to the relation, which binds a dutiful citizen to his country; and that, in withdrawing the tender of service which silence in my situation might imply, I am influenced by no diminution of zeal for your future interest; no deficiency of grateful respect for your past kindness: but am supported by a full con∣viction that the step is compatible with both.</P>
<P>The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in office, to which your suffrages have twice called me, have been a uniform sacrifice of inclination to the opinion of duty, and to a deference for what appear∣ed
<PB N="22" REF="038170_0019_10111496DEF87F50"/>
to be your desire. I constantly hoped, that it would have been much earlier in my power, consis∣tently with motives which I was not at liberty to dis∣regard, to return to that retirement, from which I had been reluctantly drawn. The strength of my in∣clination to do this, previous to the last election, had even led to the preparation of an address to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then perplexed and critical posture of affairs with foreign nations, and the unanimous advice of persons entitled to my confidence, impelled me to abandon the idea.</P>
<P>I rejoice, that the state of your concerns, external as well as internal, no longer renders the pursuit of inclination incompatible with the sentiment of duty, or propriety: and am persuaded, whatever partial∣ity may be retained for my service, that, in the pres∣ent circumstances of our country, you will not dis∣approve my determination to retire.</P>
<P>The impressions, with which I first undertook the arduous trust, were explained on the proper occasion. In the discharge of this trust, I will only say, that I have, with good intentions, contributed towards the organization and administration of the government, the best exertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. Not unconscious, in the out-set, of the inferiority of my qualifications, experience in my own eyes, perhaps still more in the eyes of others, has strengthened the motives to diffidence of myself: and every day the increasing weight of years admon∣ishes me more and more, that the shade of retire∣ment is as necessary to me as it will be welcome. Satisfied that if any circumstances have given pecu∣liar value to my services, they were temporary, I have the consolation to believe, that, while choice and prudence invite me to quit the political scene, pat∣riotism does not forbid it.</P>
<P>In looking forward to the moment, which is in∣tended
<PB N="23" REF="038170_0020_1011149F82AEC868"/>
to terminate the career of my public life, my feelings do not permit me to suspend the deep ac∣knowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my beloved country, for the many honours it has conferred upon me; still more for the steadfast con∣fidence with which it has supported me; and for the opportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifesting my inviolable attachment, by services faithful and persevering, though in usefulness unequal to my zeal. If benefits have resulted to our country from these services, let it always be remembered to our praise, and as an instructive example in our annals, that un∣der circumstances in which the passions, agitated in every direction, were liable to mislead, amidst appear∣ances sometimes dubious, vicissitudes of fortune, of∣ten discouraging in situations, in which not unfre∣quently want of success has countenanced the spirit of criticism—the constancy of your support was the essential prop of the efforts, and a guarantee of the plans, by which they were effected. Profoundly pen∣etrated with this idea, I shall carry it with me to my grave, as a strong incitement to unceasing vows, that Heaven may continue to you the choicest tokens of its beneficence—that your union and brotherly af∣fection may be perpetual—that the free Constitution, which is the work of your hands, may be sacredly maintained—that its administration, in every depart∣ment, may be stamped with wisdom and virtue— that, in fine, the happiness of the people of these States, under the auspices of liberty, may be made complete, by so careful a preservation and so prudent a use of this blessing, as will acquire to them the glory of recommending it to the applause, the affec∣tion, and adoption of every nation which is yet a stranger to it.</P>
<P>Here, perhaps, I ought to stop. But solicitude for your welfare, which cannot end but with my life,
<PB N="24" REF="038170_0021_101114A123A42158"/>
and the apprehension of danger natural to that solici∣tude, urge me, on an occasion like the present, to offer to your solemn contemplation, and to recommend to your frequent review, some sentiments, which are the result of much reflection, of no inconsiderable observation, and which appear to me all-important to the permanency of your felicity as a people.— These will be offered to you with the more freedom, as you can only feel in them the disinterested warn∣ings of a parting friend, who can possibly have no personal motive to bias his counsel. Nor can I for∣get, as an encouragement to it, your indulgent re∣ception of my sentiments on a former, and not dis∣similar occasion.</P>
<P>Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every liga∣ment of your hearts, no recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or confirm the attachment.</P>
<P>The unity of government, which constitutes you one people, is also now dear to you. It is justly so; for it is a main pillar in the edifice of your real inde∣pendence; the support of your tranquillity at home, your peace abroad; of your safety; of your pros∣perity; of that very liberty which you so highly prize. But, as it is easy to foresee, that from differ∣ent causes, and from different quarters, much pains will be taken, many artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth; as this is the point in your political fortress, against which the batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly and actively (though often covertly and insidiously) directed, it is of infinite moment that you should properly estimate the immense value of your National Union, to your collective and indi∣vidual happiness; that you should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immoveable attachment to it; accus∣toming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the palladium of your political safety and prosperity;
<PB N="25" REF="038170_0022_101114A2A956DAF0"/>
watching for its preservation with jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may suggest even a sus∣picion that it can in any event be abandoned; and indignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest, or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the various parts.</P>
<P>For this, you have every inducement of sympathy and interest. Citizens, by birth or choice, of a com∣mon country, that country has a right to concentrate your affections. The name of AMERICAN, which be∣longs to you in your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of patriotism, more than any ap∣pellation derived from local discriminations. With slight shades of difference, you have the same religion, manners, habits, and political principles. You have, in a common cause, fought and triumphed together; the Independence and Liberty you possess are the work of joint councils, and joint efforts, of common dangers, sufferings and successes.</P>
<P>But these considerations, however powerfully they address themselves to your sensibility, are greatly out∣weighed by those which apply more immediately to your interest. Here every portion of our country finds the most commanding motives for carefully guarding and preserving the union of the whole.</P>
<P>The <HI>North,</HI> in an unrestrained intercourse with the <HI>South,</HI> protected by the equal laws of a common gov∣ernment, finds in the productions of the latter, great additional resources of maritime and commercial en∣terprise, and precious materials of manufacturing in∣dustry. The <HI>South,</HI> in the same intercourse, benefit∣ing by the agency of the <HI>North,</HI> sees its agriculture grow, and its commerce expand. Turning partly in∣to its own channels the seamen of the <HI>North,</HI> it finds its particular navigation invigorated; and while it contributes, in different ways, to nourish and increase
<PB N="26" REF="038170_0023_101114A5CB0A2818"/>
the general mass of the national navigation, it looks forward to the protection of a maritime strength, to which itself is unequally adapted. The <HI>East,</HI> in a like intercourse with the <HI>West,</HI> already finds, and, in the progressive improvement of interior communications, by land and water, will more and more find a valu∣able vent for the commodities which it brings from abroad, or manufactures at home. The <HI>West</HI> derives from the <HI>East</HI> supplies requisite to its growth and comfort; and, what is perhaps of still greater conse∣quence, it must of necessity owe the <HI>secure</HI> enjoyment of indispensable <HI>outlets</HI> for its own productions to the weight, influence, and the future maritime strength of the Atlantic side of the Union, directed by an indis∣soluble community of interest as <HI>one nation.</HI> Any other tenure, by which the <HI>West</HI> can hold this essential advan∣tage, whether derived from its own separate strength, or from an apostate and unnatural connexion with any foreign power, must be intrinsically precarious.</P>
<P>While, then, every part of our country thus feels an immediate and particular interest in Union, all the parts combined cannot fail to find, in the united mass of means and efforts, greater strength, greater re∣source, proportionably greater security from external danger, a less frequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations; and, what is of inestimable value! they must derive from Union an exemption from those broils and wars between themselves, which so frequently afflict neighbouring countries, not tied to∣gether by the same government; which their own rivalships alone would be sufficient to produce, but which opposite foreign alliances, attachments, and in∣trigues would stimulate and imbitter. Hence, like∣wise, they will avoid the necessity of those overgrown military establishments, which, under any form of government, are inauspicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as particularly hostile to Republi∣can
<PB N="27" REF="038170_0024_101114A928F5AC08"/>
Liberty. In this sense it is, that your Union ought to be considered as a main prop of your liber∣ty; and that the love of the one ought to endear to you the preservation of the other.</P>
<P>These considerations speak a persuasive language to every reflecting and virtuous mind, and exhibit the continuance of the UNION as a primary object of a patriotic desire. Is there a doubt, whether a com∣mon government can embrace so large a sphere? Let experience solve it. To listen to mere speculation, in such a case, were criminal. We are authorised to hope, that a proper organization of the whole, with the auxiliary agency of governments for the respec∣tive subdivisions, will afford a happy issue to the ex∣periment. It is well worth a fair and full experi∣ment. With such powerful and obvious motives to Union, affecting all parts of our country, while ex∣periment shall not have demonstrated its impractica∣bility, there will always be reason to distrust the pat∣riotism of those, who in any quarter may endeavour to weaken its bands.</P>
<P>In contemplating the causes which may disturb our Union, it occurs as matter of serious concern, that any ground should be furnished for characterising parties, by <HI>Geographical</HI> discriminations—<HI>Northern</HI> and <HI>Southern—Atlantic</HI> and <HI>Western</HI>—whence designing men may endeavour to excite a belief, that there is a real difference of local interests and views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence, within particular districts, is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other districts. You cannot shield your selves too much against the jealousies and heart-burn∣ings which spring from these misrepresentations: they tend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together by fraternal affection. The inhabitants of our western country have lately had a useful lesson on this head: they have seen, in
<PB N="28" REF="038170_0025_101114AC58727BE0"/>
the negociation by the Executive, and in the unan∣imous ratification by the Senate, of the treaty with Spain, and in the universal satisfaction at that event, throughout the United States, a decisive proof how unfounded were the suspicions, propagated among them, of a policy in the general government and in the Atlantic states unfriendly to their interests in re∣gard to the Missisippi: they have been witnesses to the formation of two treaties, that with Great-Britain and that with Spain, which secure to them every thing they could desire, in respect to our foreign re∣lations, towards confirming their prosperity. Will it not be their wisdom to rely, for the preservation of these advantages, on the UNION by which they were procured? Will they not henceforth be deaf to those advisers, if such there are, who would sever them from their brethren, and connect them with aliens?</P>
<P>To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a government for the whole is indispensable. No al∣liances, however strict, between the parts, can be an adequate substitute; they will inevitably experience the infractions and interruptions which all alliances, in all times, have experienced. Sensible of this mo∣mentous truth, you have improved upon your first essay, by the adoption of a constitution of a govern∣ment, better calculated than your former, for an in∣timate Union, and for the efficacious management of your common concerns. This government, the off∣spring of your own choice, uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full investigation and mature delibera∣tion, completely free in its principles, in the distribu∣tion of its powers, uniting security with energy, and containing within itself a provision for its own a∣mendment, has a just claim to your confidence and your support. Respect for its authority, compliance with its laws, acquiescence in its measures, are duties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty.
<PB N="29" REF="038170_0026_101114AFDB2510F0"/>
The basis of our political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter their constitutions of government. But, the constitution which at any time exists, till changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the power and the right of the people to establish government, presupposes the duty of every individual to obey the established government.</P>
<P>All obstructions to the execution of the Laws, all combinations and associations, under whatever plau∣sible character, with the real design to direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and action of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this fundamental principle, and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize faction, to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put in the place of the dele∣gated will of the nation, the will of a party, often a small, but artful and enterprising minority of the community; and, according to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make the public administration the mirror of the ill-concerted and incongruous pro∣jects of faction, rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome plans, digested by common councils and modified by mutual interests.</P>
<P>However combinations, or associations, of the a∣bove description, may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely, in the course of time and things, to become potent engines, by which cunning, ambi∣tious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to sub∣vert the power of the people, and to usurp for them∣selves the reins of government; destroying after∣wards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.</P>
<P>Towards the preservation of your government, and the permanency of your present happy state, it is re∣quisite, not only that you steadily discountenance ir∣regular opposition to its acknowledged authority, but
<PB N="30" REF="038170_0027_101114B4DA05A2E8"/>
also that you resist, with care, the spirit of innovation upon its principles, however specious the pretexts.— One method of assault may be to effect, in the forms of the constitution, alterations which will impair the energy of the system, and thus to undermine what cannot be directly overthrown. In all the changes, to which you may be invited, remember, that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true character of government, as of other human institutions; that experience is the surest standard, by which to test the real tendency of the existing constitution of a coun∣try; that facility in changes, upon the credit of mere hypothesis and opinion, exposes to perpetual change, from the endless variety of hypothesis and opinion; and remember, especially, that for the efficient man∣agement of your common interest, in a country so ex∣tensive as ours, a government of as much vigour as is consistent with the perfect security of liberty, is indis∣pensable. Liberty itself will find in such a govern∣ment, with powers properly distributed and adjusted, its surest guardian. It is, indeed, little else than a name, where the government is too feeble to with∣stand the enterprises of faction, to confine each mem∣ber of the society within the limits prescribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the secure and tranquil enjoyment of the rights of person and property.</P>
<P>I have already intimated to you, the danger of parties in the state, with particular reference to the founding of them on geographical discriminations. Let me now take a more comprehensive view, and warn you, in the most solemn manner, against the baneful effects of the spirit of party, generally.</P>
<P>This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having its root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists, under different shapes, in all governments—more or less stifled, controled, or re∣pressed; but in those of the popular form, it is seen in
<PB N="31" REF="038170_0028_101114B816284978"/>
its greatest rankness, and is truly their worst enemy.</P>
<P>The alternate domination of one faction over an∣other, sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural to party dissention, which, in different ages and coun∣tries, has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism: but this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries, which result, gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual; and, sooner or later, the chief of some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation, on the ruins of Public Liberty.</P>
<P>Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind, (which nevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight), the common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.</P>
<P>It serves always to distract the Public Councils, and enfeeble the Public Administration. It agitates the community with ill-founded jealousies and false alarms; kindles the animosity of one part against another, and foments, occasionally, riot and insurrec∣tion. It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which find a facilitated access to the gov∣ernment itself through the channels of party passions. Thus the policy and will of one country are subject∣ed to the policy and will of another.</P>
<P>There is an opinion, that parties in free countries are useful checks upon the administration of the gov∣ernment, and serve to keep alive the spirit of Liberty. This, within certain limits, is probably true; and in governments of a monarchical cast, patriotism may look with indulgence, if not with favour, upon the spirit of party. But in those of the popular charac∣ter, in governments purely elective, it is a spirit not
<PB N="32" REF="038170_0029_101114B99BB6A290"/>
to be encouraged. From their natural tendency, it is certain, there will always be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose. And there being con∣stant danger of excess, the effort ought to be, by force of public opinion, to mitigate and assuage it: a fire not to be quenched, it demands uniform vigi∣lance to prevent its bursting into a flame, lest, instead of warming, it should consume.</P>
<P>It is important, likewise, that the habits of thinking, in a free country, should inspire caution, in those en∣trusted with its administration, to confine themselves within their respective constitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one department to encroach upon another. The spirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers of all the depart∣ments in one; and thus to create, whatever be the form of Government, a real despotism. A just esti∣mate of that love of power, and proneness to abuse it, which predominates in the human heart, is suffi∣cient to satisfy us of the truth of this position. The necessity of reciprocal checks in the exercise of the political power, by dividing and distributing it into different depositories, and constituting each the guar∣dian of the public weal against invasions by the oth∣ers, has been evinced by experiments, ancient and modern; some of them in our country, and under our own eyes. To preserve them, must be as neces∣sary as to institute them. If, in the opinion of the people, the distribution or modification of the consti∣tutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the constitution designates: but let there be no change by usurpation; for though this, in one instance, may be the instrument of good, it is the customary wea∣pon, by which free governments are destroyed. The precedent must always greatly overbalance, in perma∣nent evil, any partial or transient benefit which the use can at any time yield.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="038170_0030_101114BB237BC168"/>Of all the dispositions and habits, which lead to political prosperity, Religion and Morality are indis∣pensable supports. In vain would that Man claim the tribute of Patriotism, who would labour to sub∣vert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of the duties of Men and Citizens.— The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not trace all their connexions with private and public felicity. Let it simply be asked, where is the security for property, for reputation, for life, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths which are the instruments of investigation in courts of jus∣tice? and let us with caution indulge the supposition, that Morality can be maintained without Religion. Whatever may be conceded of the influence of refin∣ed education on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national Morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.</P>
<P>It is substantially true, that virtue or morality is a necessary spring of popular government. The rule, indeed, extends, with more or less force, to every species of free government. Who that is a sincere friend to it, can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the foundation of the fabric?</P>
<P>Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for the general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a government gives force to public opinion, it is essential that public opinion should be enlightened.</P>
<P>As a very important source of strength and secu∣rity, cherish public credit. One method of preserv∣ing it, is to use it as sparingly as possible; avoiding oc∣casions of expense by cultivating peace; but remem∣bering also, that timely disbursements, to prepare for danger, frequently prevent much greater disburse∣ments to repel it: avoiding, likewise, the accumula∣tion
<PB N="34" REF="038170_0031_101114BFF60A4A20"/>
of debt, not only by shunning occasions of ex∣pense, but by vigorous exertions, in time of peace, to discharge the debts which unavoidable wars may have occasioned, not ungenerously throwing upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear. The execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives, but it is necessary that public opinion should co-operate. To facilitate to them the performance of their duty, it is essential that you should practically bear in mind, that towards the payment of debts there must be revenue; that to have revenue, there must be taxes; and none can be devised, which are not, more or less, inconvenient and unpleasant; that the intrinsic embarrassment in∣separable from the selection of the proper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties) ought to be a decisive motive for a candid construction of the conduct of the government in making it, and for a spirit of acquiescence in the measures for obtaining revenue, which the public exigencies may at any time dictate.</P>
<P>Observe good faith and justice towards all nations; cultivate peace and harmony with all: Religion and Morality enjoin this conduct; and can it be, that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be worthy of a free, enlightened, and (at no distant pe∣riod) a great nation, to give to mankind the mag∣nanimous and too novel example of a people always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence. Who can doubt, that in the course of time and things, the fruits of such a plan would richly repay any tempo∣rary advantages which might be lost by a steady ad∣herence to it? Can it be, that Providence has not connected the permanent felicity of a nation with Virtue? The experiment, at least, is recommended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature. Alas! is it rendered impossible by its vices?</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="038170_0032_101114C5180DDA28"/>In the execution of such a plan, nothing is more essential than that permanent, inveterate antipathies against particular nations, and passionate attachments for others, should be excluded; and that, in the place of them, just and amicable feelings towards all should be cultivated. The nation which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an habitual fondness, is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its animos∣ity or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead it astray from its duty and its interest. Antip∣athy in one nation against another, disposes each more readily to offer insult and injury, to lay hold of slight causes of umbrage, and to be haughty and intractable, when accidental or trifling occasions of dispute occur.</P>
<P>Hence frequent collisions, obstinate, envenomed and bloody contests. The nation, prompted by ill-will and resentment, sometimes impels to war the government, contrary to the best calculations of pol∣icy. The government sometimes participates in the national propensity, and adopts through passion what reason would reject; at other times, it makes the animosity of the nation subservient to projects of hos∣tility, instigated by pride, ambition, and other sinister and pernicious motives. The peace often, sometimes perhaps the liberty, of nations has been the victim.</P>
<P>So, likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for another produces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favourite Nation, facilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest, in cases where no real common interest exists, and infusing into one the enmities of the other, betrays the former into a par∣ticipation in the quarrels and wars of the latter, with∣out adequate inducement or justification. It leads also to concessions to the favourite nation of privileges denied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the concessions, by unnecessarily part∣ing
<PB N="36" REF="038170_0033_1010DD42F8A3D8F0"/>
with what ought to have been retained, and by ex∣citing jealousy, ill-will, and a disposition to retaliate, in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld: and it gives to ambitious, corrupted, or deluded citi∣zens (who devote themselves to the favourite nation) facility to betray, or sacrifice the interests of their own country, without odium, sometimes even with popularity; gilding, with the appearances of a vir∣tuous sense of obligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable zeal for public good, the base or foolish compliances of ambition, corrup∣tion, or infatuation.</P>
<P>As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, such attachments are particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent patriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic factions, to practise the arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion, to influence or awe the public counsels; such an attachment of a small or weak, towards a great and powerful nation, dooms the for∣mer to be the satellite of the latter.</P>
<P>Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to believe me, fellow citizens), the jea∣lousy of a free people ought to be <HI>constantly</HI> awake; since history and experience prove, that foreign in∣fluence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government. But that jealousy, to be useful, must be impartial; else it becomes the instrument of the very influence to be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ided, instead of a defence against it. Excessive partiality for one foreign nation, and excessive dislike of another, cause those whom they actuate to see danger only on one side, and serve to veil, and even second the arts of influence on the other. Real patriots, who may resist the intrigues of the favourite, are liable to become suspected and odi∣ous; while its tools and dupes usurp the applause and confidence of the people, to surrender their interests.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="038170_0034_101114CA2DBAC598"/>The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to foreign nations, is, in extending our commercial re∣lations, to have with them as little <HI>political</HI> connexion as possible. So far as we have already formed en∣gagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let us stop.</P>
<P><HI>Europe</HI> has a set of primary interests, which to us have none, or a very remote relation. Hence she must be engaged in frequent controversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns.— Hence, therefore, it must be unwise in us to impli∣cate ourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary vicis∣situdes of her politics, or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships or enmities.</P>
<P>Our detached and distant situation invites and en∣ables us to pursue a different course. If we remain one people, under an efficient government, the period is not far off, when we may defy material injury from external annoyance; when we may take such an at∣titude as will cause the neutrality, we may at any time resolve upon, to be scrupulously respected; when belligerent nations, under the impossibility of making acquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giv∣ing us provocation; when we may choose peace or war, as our interest, guided by justice, shall counsel.</P>
<P>Why forego the advantages of so peculiar a situa∣tion? Why quit our own, to stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with that of any part of Europe <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tangle our peace and prosperity in the toils of European ambition, rival∣ship, interest, humour, or caprice?</P>
<P>It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances, with any portion of the foreign world; so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty to do it; for let me not be understood, as capable of patronizing infidelity to existing engagements. I hold the max∣im no less applicable to public than to private affairs,
<PB N="38" REF="038170_0035_101114CF305EEF40"/>
that honesty is always the best policy. I repeat it, therefore, let those engagements be observed in their genuine sense. But, in my opinion, it is unnecessary, and would be unwise to extend them.</P>
<P>Taking care always to keep ourselves, by suitable establishments, on a respectable defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary alliances for extraor∣dinary emergencies.</P>
<P>Harmony, liberal intercourse with all nations, are recommended by policy, humanity, and interest. But even our commercial policy should hold an equal and impartial hand; neither sending or granting exclusive favours or preferences; consulting the natural course of things; diffusing and diversifying, by gentle means, the streams of commerce, but forcing nothing; estab∣lishing, with powers so disposed, in order to give trade a stable course, to define the rights of our merchants, and to enable the government to support them, con∣ventional rules of intercourse, the best that present circumstances and mutual opinion will permit, but temporary, and liable to be, from time to time, aban∣doned or varied, as experience and circumstances shall dictate; constantly keeping in view, that it is folly in one nation to look for disinterested favours from another; that it must pay, with a portion of its independence, for whatever it may accept under that character; that, by such acceptance, it may place itself in the condition of having given equivalents for nominal favours, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> being reproached with in∣gratitude for not giving more. There can be no greater error than to expect, or calculate upon real favours from nation to nation. It is an illusion which experi∣ence must cure, which a just pride ought to discard.</P>
<P>In offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels of an old affectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the strong and lasting impression I could wish; that they will control the usual current of the
<PB N="39" REF="038170_0036_101114D0B4106650"/>
passions, or prevent our nation from running <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> course which has hitherto marked the destiny of na∣tions: but if I may even flatter myself, that they may be productive of some partial benefit, some occasional good; that they may now and then recur to mode∣rate the fury of party spirit, to warn against the mis∣chiefs of foreign intrigue, to guard against the im∣postures of pretended patriotism; this hope will be a full recompence for the solicitude for your welfare, by which they have been dictated.</P>
<P>How far, in the discharge of my official duties, I have been guided by the principles which have been delineated, the public records, and other evidences of my conduct, must witness to you and to the world. To myself, the assurance of my own conscience is, that I have at least believed myself to be guided by them.</P>
<P>In relation to the still subsisting war in Europe, my Proclamation of the 22d of April, 1795, is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your approving voice, and by that of your Representatives in both Houses of Congress, the spirit of that measure has continu∣ally governed me; uninfluenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.</P>
<P>After deliberate examination, with the aid of the best lights I could obtain, I was well satisfied that our country, under all the circumstances of the case, had a right to take, and was bound in duty and interest to take a neutral position. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ng taken it, I deter∣mined, as far as should <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on me, to maintain it, with moderation.</P>
<P>The considerations which <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the right to hold this conduct, it is not necessary on this occasion to detail. I will only observe, that according to my understanding of the matter, that right, so far from being denied by any of the belligerent powers, has been virtually admitted by all.</P>
<P>The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be in∣ferred,

without any thing more, from the obligation which justice and humanity impose on every nation, in cases in which it is free to act, to maintain inviolate the relations of peace and amity towards other nations.</P>
<P>The inducements of interest for observ<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> that con∣duct will best be referred to your own reflections and experience. With me, a predominant motive has been to endeavour to gain time to our country to set∣tle and mature its yet recent institutions, and to pro∣gress without interruption, to that degree of strength and consistency, which is necessary to give it, hu∣manly speaking, the command of its own fortunes.</P>
<P>Though in reviewing the incidents of my admini∣stration, I am unconscious of intentional error; I am nevertheless too sensible of my defects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. Whatever they may be, I fervently beseech the Al∣mighty to avert or mitigate the evils, to which they may tend. I shall also carry with me the hope that my country will never cease to view them with indul∣gence; and that after forty-five years of my life ded∣icated to its service, with <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be consigned to oblivion, as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest.</P>
