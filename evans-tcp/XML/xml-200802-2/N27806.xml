<HEAD>A SERMON, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><P>CONVENED for the purpose of making some suitable reflections, upon the death of GENERAL GEORGE WASHINGTON; the Man who, in life, was highly ven∣erable, amiable and beloved; and who, in his death, is great∣ly lamented, and universally honored by public and respect∣ful ceremonies;—the following pathetic and ejaculatory Aphorism of Israel's inspired King, is highly applicable to the occasion: "HELP, LORD; for the GODLY MAN cea∣seth; for the FAITHFUL fail from among the CHILDREN of MEN."</P>
<BIBL>PSALMS, CHAP. xii. VERSE 1.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ALL terrestial things and beings are of a transitory and perishable nature. Even the Sun, that bright emblem of the Deity, which has for ages shone with undistinguishable lustre upon surrounding worlds, must at length cease to shine, and be removed from its exalted station; among the shining worlds in the expanded firmament.—The principles of de∣cay and dissolution, are inseperably connected with all the visible objects of nature.</P>
<P>THAT all the human race are mortal is a truth which neither the godly, nor the ungodly dispute. The most wise and amiable and the most godly and esteemed of men, can∣not be exempted from the stroke of death. To death, the rich as well as the poor, the noble as well as the ignomini∣ous, must submit and bow. Neither the virtues nor honors of WASHINGTON, could secure him from the arrest of death.—WASHINGTON, the faithful and godly, has fallen; —he is removed from us into the world of spirits,—it should therefore be the prayer of United Columbia, Help, or save us O Lord, for the godly Man hath ceased; for the faithful Man from among us has failed!</P>
<P>THE death of the wise and virtuous in public life, is a just cause of public lamentation, sorrow and prayer. Tho' all things and beings are under the wise and sovereign direction
<PB N="6" REF="037056_0004_100C31EFDFCF1100"/>
of HIM "whose kingdom ruleth over all,"—and tho it be the duty of all mankind to submit to the events of his prov∣idence as just and right, yet when persons of eminent worth and usefulness, of singular piety and goodness, are taken out of the world, it is lawful to express grief, and to mourn that they are no more. When persons of this character, in pub∣lic life, are taken away by death, it cannot be displeasing to the Holy Governor of the universe, to see those of the same community or nation, noticing with religious ceremonies, such an event of his providence, and respecting their virtues by public testimonies of veneration. This may be done with all due submission to his holy government, and to the particular instance of his providence, by which their sorrow and mourning are united.</P>
<P>As the venerable Man, whose death we now lament, was possessed of extraordinary virtues, and was more than uncom∣monly useful in public life,—it becomes the sons and daugh∣ters of Columbia, to unite in public testamonies of grief, and in public ceremonies of respect for his memory.</P>
<P>"THE ILLUSTRIOUS GENERAL GEORGE WASHING∣TON IS DEAD." Let COLUMBIA be clothed in an HA∣BILIMENT of MOURNING. He has died, as expressed in the public Papers, "mature in years, covered with glory, and rich in the affection of the American people."</P>
<P>HOWEVER the Citizens of United America have been, and are yet divided in their political sentiments,—yet con∣cerning the death of the illustrious WASHINGTON, they lay aside their divisions and animosity, and are united in paying a public respect to the talents, usefulness, virtues and memory of this their departed Hero.—In all our populous towns, the several Houses of public worship, have been dressed in mourn∣ing, while the Bells, with solemn sound, have announced that some public Calamity has come upon our country: And what is the Calamity? Have either famines, earthquakes, or epidemic disorders, become the cause of these public testimo∣nies of sorrow and mourning? No! "The illustrious LEADER; the SOLDIERS FRIEND; the FATHER of his COUNTRY," is forever removed from this sublunary world. Numerous are the Orations, Sermons, and Eulogies, which have been pronounced, in honor to his superior talents and virtues:—And in the commemoration and celebration of which, numerous hymns, psalms, and dirges, have been sung in solemn strains:—The vocal and instrumental music, which have been performed on the occasion, have smitten the mind
<PB N="7" REF="037056_0005_100C3E2D942EF248"/>
with pungent anguish, while they have caused reflections highly useful and important. The several funeral proces∣sions and military honors, which have been formed, as public testimonies of sorrow for the melancholy event of his death, are calculated to teach us the uncertainty and final <HI>End</HI> of all worldly greatness and honors.</P>
<P>AMONG the many public tributes of respect with which he has been honored in his death the speaker will now hum∣bly attempt, to shew that he was, according to the text, "A Godly and faithful man."</P>
<P>WITH one voice, all the true Citizens of United Colum∣bia, who respect the divine government over mankind, must readily unite in this solemn and pathetic Address to God, "Help, Lord; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among us."—</P>
<P>WHATEVER might have caused the pious king of Israel, to make this address, none of us can be insensible of its ap∣plication to the death of Washington, the Hero, the Sage, and Patriot of United America.</P>
<P>HE was a Godly-man, because he always respected &amp; vin∣cated the character and government of the Supreme Ruler of the Universe.—He was never known to trifle with the names by which the Creator and Governor of the world is distinguished from other beings. He always reverenced his sacred names, titles, and attributes; and of things sacred he always spake with solemnity and reverence. It has been remarked by those who have had a personal acquaintance with him, and who have attended him both in the private and public walks of life, that he never took the name of the Lord God in vain. His countenance indicated a solemn mind, and all his private and public actions manifested that he was a Godly-man.</P>
<P>IN his public addresses, and in his answers to the many thousand which he has received, and especially in his FARE∣WELL ADDRESS to the people when he last retired into pri∣vate life, his <HI>Piety</HI> is evidently discovered. With Godly rev∣erence, he always mentioned the Divine government, relat∣ed the Divine goodness and expressed the Divine blessing, confer'd on the American Nation.</P>
<P>AMIDST all the honors which his fellow Citizens could confer upon him, and while living in the most affluent cir∣cumstances, his heart and affections aspired to things of a more glorious and duriable nature. He lived as being fully sensible of the uncertain and transitory nature of all human
<PB N="8" REF="037056_0006_100C3E2FA2811D58"/>
greatness and glory. He lived as one who lived not to him∣self, but to the glory of his Creator, and for the good of his fellow creatures. His heart was enlivened by pious affec∣tions; his mind enlarged with exalted conceptions of Jeho∣vah and his providences; and his conduct made amiable by a course of uniformity and virtue. Realizing the view and glory of making the people of these United States virtuous and happy, under an equitable Constitution and Govern∣ment, in their National existence and independence; and animated by the hope of leaving virtuous examples of mar∣shall heroism, and of a just administration in the high de∣partment of Government, both legislative and executive, he encounter'd the greatest dangers, and cheerfully passed thro' many trying scenes. Endeavouring to promote the honor and kingdom of Jehovah in the world, he has lest a name, which will be revered by the virtuous of succeeding ages. In all the dangers and distresses with which he has been sur∣rounded, he has found abundant consolation in the applause of a good conscience, and especially in the reasonable ex∣pectation of having the approbation of the Supreme Ruler of all nations. Such consolations shall survive the wreck of worlds and ages: "they are independent solaces" far be∣yond the reach of time's destroying power. These, in a degree, the Godly of all ranks and stations enjoy; and for them, with the most servent zeal, we should all aspire.</P>
<P>PERSUADED that Jehovah governs the world, with the most perfect wisdom and holiness, justice and benignity, and that all his requirements of mankind are perfectly just and holy, this godly Man lived superior to all those altercations and divisions which have been raised, and for ages carried on by religious bigots. Sensible that modes of faith and religi∣ous sentiment were of no importance, only as they tended to promote true benevolence, kindness, charity, and virtue among mankind, —his religion, was constituted in supreme reverence for the character, perfections and government of Jehovah, and of universal "good will to man."</P>
<P>THO' he was a professor of religion in the Church of England, yet it is evident that he was a sincere believer in the absolute unity of the Deity, as disconnected from all human opinions, and inventions, with which the doctrine has long been taught, and handed down from one generation to another.</P>
<P>BELIEVING that there were virtuous persons, among the sev∣eral classes &amp; different denomination of people in the United
<PB N="9" REF="037056_0007_100C3E312B41CE88"/>
States, and unwilling to dictate others in their religious sen∣timents, he in his Proclamation for a day of public Thanks∣giving in the year ninety-five, called on the people to ex∣press their gratitude to the ONE ONLY SUPREME over all, on account of his wonderful goodness manifested to them as a nation. He said nothing about any particular system of religion, or any of the controversal doctrines among Chris∣tians, and others: But he fully expressed the great funda∣mentals of all religion; such as the acknowledgement of the existence, perfections, and providence of Jehovah; the gra∣titude due to him for all his blessings, both of a public and private nature; and our obligations to Him, as also our hap∣piness, in the regulations of our affections and conduct by a faithful obedience to the demands of that religion, which requires repentance and an implicit reliance upon the Di∣vine mercy for the pardon of sin, and for every temporal and spiritual favor. He was therefore GODLY by the exercise of universal CHARITY and "GOODWILL" which are directly opposed to the disposition and conduct of those professors of religion, who confine their charity and GOODWILL to those only of their peculiar sentiments. As such characters are so few in the world, especially in public life, we have the highest reason to mourn for the loss of the Man of this char∣acter, who has lately fallen in death:—With the utmost propriety may we pray as in the words of the text, "Help, LORD; for this godly man hath ceased; for this faithful Man hath failed from among us."</P>
<P>THAT WASHINGTON, who is justly stiled the illustrious, was faithful, in the exercise of that power and confidence re∣posed in him, is a fact too evident to be denied by his great∣est enemies. In what instance, has he ever acted incon∣sistent with his dignified and exalted station? Did he ever abuse the power with which he was intrusted? Or, Did he ever betray the high and important TRUST committed to him, by the united suffrages of his fellow Citizens? The greatest error which has ever been attributed to him in his public administration, was the signing the British treaty. But as we have the highest reason to suppose, that he was sincere in this act, the enemies to the Treaty, should spare censure, and be candid and charitable, when speaking of this instance of his public conduct.</P>
<P>POSSESSED of all the honors and powers which his Coun∣try could bestow upon him; and possessed of an Independent fortune, can we conceive of any motive, by which he could
<PB N="10" REF="037056_0008_100C3E32B7D54620"/>
have been induced, to sign such a public Instrument, either to aggrandize or enrich himself:—On the contrary, Have we not every reason to suppose, that he was actuated in this instance from a sincere and disinterested regard for the public good? What the consequences might have been, if the Treaty had not been ratified by his public sanction, it is <HI>now</HI> impossible for us to determine: Perhaps much greater depredations on our commerce, and war devastation, and bloodshed among us. But we will spare our conjectures, while we consider him as having the general good of his country at heart, when to the Treaty he put his public sanct∣ion. As the treaty is approbated by a Majority of both branches of Government, and by the Majority of the people, a certain deference is due to their opinion and judgment from the Minority.</P>
<P>A MAN elevated to the exalted station in which the Ven∣erable MAN, whose death we now deplore, was; and pos∣sessing the power with which he was intrusted, might have been wholly actuated, in his public conduct, from the selfish principles of avarice and ambition. History is filled with unnumbered evils of sceptered ambition and avarice, abused power and domination. History teaches us the fatal effects of the selfishness, avarice, and ambition of Rulers both in the cabinet and field. Many of the Kings of Israel, several of the Roman Emperors, such as Nero and Caligula, with in∣numerable others of almost all the kingdoms and nations of the world, have converted their supreme magistracy and au∣thority, into engines of oppression and cruelty, and for the accomplishment of the most tyrannical and selfish purposes. Such characters have ever been the greatest instruments of national profligacy and destruction. Jeroboam, King of Is∣rael, finned, and made his nation to sin. Hence we find it repeatedly said in the history of the wicked Kings of Israel, He "did like unto Jereboam, King of Israel, who made Is∣rael to sin." This character is applicable to every wicked ruler. Such characters in their public administration, cause oppressive laws; burthensome taxes; injurious promotions; causeless ejections from office; cruel executions, internal devastation; and foreign domination. From the conduct and example of such rulers, profligacy and ruin spread through the community, and stop the streams of national health and glory. But how very different were the public measures and administration of the illustrious Personage, whose death we now lament. Was he ever known to be cap∣tivated
<PB N="11" REF="037056_0009_100C3E35083D4C78"/>
by the splendor of dignity? or wrongly allur'd by the dazzling effects of honnor &amp; influence? Was he ever know to distribute justice with an uneven balance? Was virtue ever opposed by his conduct, or discountenanced by his examples? Did he ever designedly elevate the vicious to stations which claim respect and confidence? Are not the whole of this assembly, and indeed the millions of confederated America, ready to reply with one voice, No! —Where in our own Country, or indeed in any other Country, can we find anoth∣er such a Character, so illustrious and useful, whom Heaven has selected for an instrument of such public good? Impel∣led by similar emotions, the whole American nation are now in mourning for the loss of a Man <HI>so</HI> "godly and faith∣ful." He was a Job, for patience, in danger and distress; a Moses, for a national Deliverer and Saviour; a Joshua for a Commander of a numerous and respectable Army, in de∣fence of his Country's rights and liberty; and a David for the public administration of the constitution and government of an highly favoured nation. Such an assemblage of hero∣ic and religious virtues, were never found in any human char∣acter before. Grecian nor Roman Annals, have never de∣lineated such exalted virtues and talents, in the lines of any of their boasted and deified heroes, legislators or philosophers. Under the superintending providence of JEHOVAH who ex∣alteth &amp; humbleth nations, he has done more than any other man, "in founding this our wide spreading Empire," and in establishing in this western world a grea &amp; independent nation.</P>
<P>IN a period of the deepest calamity, he was appointed Commander in chief of the united army of the <HI>then</HI> thirteen States of America; in which station he always acted with undaunted courage and uniform dignity. With a heroism and military wisdom wholly unprecedented, and in dangers the most difficult, trying and distressing, he has been instru∣mental of establishing our national existence, independence and greatness. Having accomplished the great and highly important OBJECT, for which he was appointed the Com∣mander in chief of the American armies, he according to the elegant language of prophecy, converted the implements of war, such as the sword into the ploughshare and the spear in∣to the pruning hook; and with cheerfulness, retired into pri∣vate life. But as soon as it became obvious that it was ne∣cessary and highly expedient that there should be a constitu∣tion founded, and a general Government established for the United States, he again, at his country's call, forsook the re∣tirements of domestic life, and in a time of political convul∣sions,
<PB N="12" REF="037056_0010_100C3E382943F700"/>
when a National storm had arisen, came forward into public view; and with virtue and honor, presided over the confederated States of America, as their first and chief Ma∣gistrate. At the close of the last term for which he was elect∣ed to the chief Magistracy of the United States, he volunta∣rily choose to retire again into the private walks of life, even when his unanimous "re-election could not have been doubted."—But as soon as his beloved Country, was again in danger, by the threatenings and assaults of foreign ene∣mies, he was ready to step forward in its defence. He therefore accepted accordingly the appointment and office of Lieutenant General of the American Armies; in the dis∣charge of which office he was faithful unto death.</P>
<P>HENCE, "by the purity of his character," and by a long series of the most important services of a public nature, he has rendered himself illustrious, not only in this Country, but throughout the World.— He always acted in such a man∣ner, as naturally tended to allure others to the practice of vir∣tue and righteousness, and not to vice and licentiousness. In the shade of retirement, in the field, in the cabinet, and in the chair of State, he was respectable and virtuous. He was "a Lion in the day of battle, and great and powerful in command." The gentleness and simplicity of his manners, and his virtuous and amiable conduct, united in forming a character truly grand and illustrious: a character which was calculated to command attention and inspire confidence. His natural genious, acquired talents and virtues; brought him at an uncommon early period of life into public notice and esteem. In danger, and while others were in dismay, he al∣ways acted with firmness and moderation. One instance of which, may be noticed in his conduct at the banks of Mon∣ongahela: There consider the youthful Washington, in an awful time of Indian victory and triumph, collecting the re∣mains of the defeated Army of Bradock.—and saving, by a discernment and valor uncommon for his years, the lives of hundreds whose hearts had failed for fear, and whose lives were in jeopardy every moment by the unrelenting savage foe.</P>
<P>DURING the period of almost Fifty Years, he was em∣ployed in the performance of a series of great and important services to his country; the splendor and glory of which, eclipse all the glittering royalty of all the crowns and dig∣nified names, of all the Monarchs which ever sat upon the thrones, of all the Kingdoms and Empires of either Europe, Asia, or Africa.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="037056_0011_100C3E3A49508968"/>RELIGION was his "constant angelic guest," and the di∣vine paraclete of his heart.—During the whole of his life, he exhibited a uniform and illustrious example of the most distin∣guished virtues. Under his auspicious protection and pat∣ronage, piety and righteousness, as by "kindly rains and temperate suns" sprang up and flourished, and have yielded a profitable harvest. Like the unclouded Sun, he arose into public view; in the meredian and evening of life, attracted the attention and admiration of millions; with refulgent brightness, sat below the horizon of this life, in the serene <HI>Eve</HI> of this existence; and has arisen, with holy splendor, in the Horizon of Immortality.</P>
<P>FROM hence we learn, That, in every instance, in which we, in our respective stations and employments, can imitate his virtues, it is our most indispensible duty thus to do.—We all have parts to act upon the theatre of time: and justice, goodness, and religion are necessary for their right perfor∣mance: Let it be our constant and greatest concern to live, like the venerable WASHINGTON, godly and faithful in the present evil world: And when this world shall recede from our mortal view, as it has from his, May we, as he did, have a religious peace in such a solemn and awful period:— then we shall stand firm and sure at the final Retribution, when the dissolution of all terrestial things and scenes, shall astonish the thronging MULTITUDE, pressing forward to the general Judgment.</P>
<P>FINALLY—My Brethren, by this instance of Mortality, we learn, the vanity of all human greatness and glory.</P>
<P>ALASS! WASHINGTON, the Hero, the Friend, and the Father of his Country, is gone, forever gone!!—His sacred Relics must remain under the power of death, until the solemn Morn of the general Resurrection:—And shall his unparralled talents, virtues, services, and NAME, be forgot∣ten▪ No!—For Columbia's Sons and Daughters, shall, to the latest generation, celebrate them with rapture and de∣light.</P>
<P>"O WASHINGTON, thou HERO, Patriot, Sage," May we not say concerning thee, in the sublime language of the celebrated Bard, to which thy Country has given birth.</P>
<Q><L>"Thy glorious life a volume shall compose,</L>
<L>"As Alps immortal; spotless as it snows.</L>
