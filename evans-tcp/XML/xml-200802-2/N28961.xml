</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TO the primitive christians, to those who heard the words of CHRIST himself, or who obeyed the inspired dictates of his immediate successors, the text refers. They describe the effects which necessarily arise from true and vital piety. These effects are, an attachment to the peculiar and important doctrines of the gospel, a spirit of conde∣scension and benevolence to our fellow christians and our fellow men, and a deep reverence for, as well as a punctual attendance upon, the ordinances of divine worship. These are the genuine fruits of righteousness, flowing spontaneously from a renewed and holy heart.</P>
<P>IN every age of the christian church, its real members have deserved and received the character given in the text. The word, the will, the precepts of CHRIST have always been dear to them, and en∣gaged their attention and obedience. Those who
<PB N="6" REF="038619_0004_1012A87418E07820"/>
are truly conscientious cannot be easy when sacred truth is either denied or corrupted; neither will they be easy when they are "taught for doctrines the commandments of men," or are obliged to sub∣mit to ceremonies which they do not consider as authorized by the word of GOD.</P>
<P>IT was this noble and christian spirit which peo∣pled with civilized and christan inhabitants the wilds of New England. Our venerable ancestors felt themselves aggrieved in their native land. They were forbidden to practice the worship and discipline which they deemed scriptural and important, and were obliged under heavy penalties to conform to such as they viewed in a different light. Now that the controversy is mellowed by time, and mutual harmony has removed the roughness, which, for want of candor and more frequent communication, ad∣hered to both parties, we are ready to wonder that so much keenness should be discovered, and so great sacrifices made to what we esteem matters compara∣tively indifferent.—But it is not possible for us to dis∣cover the motives of men, and therefore we have no right to judge or condemn them. That the foun∣ders of our churches were actuated by motives really conscientious, we are certain: For, only to the claims, the strong claims of conscience, will men sacrifice their native country and their domestic happiness, by emigrating to a foreign and inhospita∣ble shore. They loved GOD, and "went after him into the wilderness." Here they established a civil polity, the spirit and energy of which remain to the present day. They established literary and religious
<PB N="7" REF="038619_0005_1012A876F7BE2828"/>
institutions, which have been the great sources of the freedom and happiness of our country. They foun∣ded churches which, "having obtained help of GOD, continue unto this day."</P>
<P>A GREAT degree of harmony prevailed in our Country, and between our Churches, for many years. It was sometimes interrupted indeed by sec∣taries who inserted themselves among us, and endeav∣ored to establish tenets of doctrine and discipline, which would have overthrown all civil government; spread anarchy and confusion over the face of the new settlement, and would probably in the issue have defeated the designs of the original emigrants. The principles of self defence led to measures, which under other circumstances, might not have been jus∣tifiable. The intruders were banished from the ter∣ritory, and some were more heavily punished. Our fathers had purchased an asylum for themselves, an abode where they could hold their own sentiments and practice their own modes. They supposed therefore that they had a right to enjoy this liberty in quiet. They supposed that those who differed from them had no right to invade the wilderness they had subdued or to interrupt their tranquillity, but ought to find some other place where they might worship in peace in their own way without disturb∣ing their neighbors.</P>
<P>AMONG the Churches of New England, that which I now address has always held an honorable place. One hundred years were, the last week, compleated, since the respectable founders of this in∣stitution first assembled publicly for the worship of
<PB N="8" REF="038619_0006_1012A8788AB84B10"/>
GOD upon the very spot which we now cover. This circumstance has led my thoughts to the subject be∣fore us, and induced me to attempt giving you a brief summary of the affairs of this Church from its first settlement to the present day, and to suggest to your minds and my own, such reflections as may make us wiser and better.</P>
<P>A NUMBER of good men, distinguished for their liberality of thinking, as well as for their regard to the gospel and its ordinances, laid the foundation of this church. While they respected the religious practices of the day, they thought that in some re∣spects they might be improved. The country had then been settled seventy years, and in this period very little alteration had taken place in doctrine, disci∣pline or manners. As to the doctrines of religion, these good men did not professedly differ from their brethren of other churches. In a manifesto, pub∣lished with a view to make known their purposes in the undertaking before them, they thus express themselves on this point, "We approve and sub∣scribe the confession of faith put forth by the assem∣bly of divines at Westminster. We design only the true and pure worship of GOD according to the rules appearing plainly to us in his word."</P>
<P>BUT in several respects they differed from other churches as to modes of order and discipline. In worship they differed from them as to reading the scriptures and the use of the LORD's prayer in pub∣lic. To the first of these practices it was objected, that the scriptures could not be understood fully without an exposition, and that unlearned and un∣stable
<PB N="9" REF="038619_0007_1012A87B98F85580"/>
men would be apt to wrest them to their own destruction. In reply to this, our founders justified their conduct by saying, that this objection would operate equally against reading the scriptures in pri∣vate, because they might be thus abused, and thus the practice of the church of Rome in withholding the scriptures from the people would be justified; that the word of GOD could not be injurious to those who honored and obeyed it, and that many ought not to be deprived of a privilege because a few might abuse it; that we should hear the lan∣guage of GOD himself, and then exercise our own judgment (not that of any earthly teacher) in deter∣mining its true meaning; and that it was doing honor to the scriptures to have them read (agreeably to the practice of the primitive church) in their pure unadulterated state, during the public worship of GOD.</P>
<P>THE ancient dissenters did not approve the frequent use of the LORD's prayer in the liturgy of the church of England. They stiled this a vain repetition. Their separation made them wish to keep as far as possible from the customs of the parent church, and they accordingly seldom or ever used this excellent form. The founders of this church avoided both extremes. They concluded to have this concise and comprehensive prayer used once in each season of public worship. The practice has been invariable to the present day.</P>
<P>THE admission to full communion was justly deemed, by the first settlers of this country, a mat∣ter of great importance. The general opinion was, that none should partake of this privilege but such
<PB N="10" REF="038619_0008_1012A87E7818D318"/>
as were truly born of GOD. In order that the church might judge of this fact, a relation of his christian experiences, either written or oral, was re∣quired of every candidate for this privilege. This usage had degenerated into a matter of mere form, and such a similarity prevailed in these instruments, as gave too much occasion for ridicule. In this church therefore the practice was disused. At least it was not required, while every one was left at lib∣erty to do it, which, however, has never in a single instance been improved. They required that the pastor or pastors should be satisfied as to the qualifi∣cations of those who offered themselves to baptism or the communion, and this satisfaction, properly expressed, they considered as a sufficient reason for admission, without a formal vote of the church.</P>
<P>"We apprehend (says the manifesto before men∣tioned) that a particular church, as such, is a society of christians by mutual agreement usually meeting together for public worship in the same place and under the same ministry, attending on the ordinances of GOD there. Under this principle we have never been in the habit of requiring or giving dismissions from or to other churches. If any person statedly congregates or communicates with us, we consider him as a member of our church, and admit him to all christian privileges. At the same time we view him as subject to christian discipline from us in case of offence."—So liberal has the spirit of this church always been as that its arms have been opened to re∣ceive christians of all protestant sects and denomina∣tions,
<PB N="11" REF="038619_0009_1012A882AFB159C0"/>
and admit them to the same privileges as they enjoyed in their own communities.</P>
<P>IN ancient days the choice of a minister (as well as the choice of all civil officers) was confined to those who were in full communion with the church. In this respect also our original constitution differed from the general practice. "We cannot, says the manifesto, confine the right of choosing a minister to the communicants alone, but we think that every baptized adult person, who contributes to the main∣tenance, should have a vote in electing." This principle, founded in strict justice and reason, has been invariably practiced upon ever since.</P>
<P>So proper and necessary do these alterations ap∣pear to us, and so generally are they adopted at the present day, as that we wonder any person should oppose them. But there were many men, some from a reverence to ancient institutions, and a con∣viction of their propriety, some from dread of inno∣vation, and others from a fear that this new and popular society would diminish their own societies and lessen the influence they held; who exclaimed loudly against this new establishment. Respectable and opulent as were the men who formed it, they found it difficult for a time to stem the torrent of public opinion which ran strongly against them, and overcome the jealousy which their neighbors felt of being eclipsed by them.</P>
<P>UNDER these circumstances, it was necessary for them to choose a minister who agreed with them in sentiment; who had a liberal mind, and who had firmness enough to support his own opinions in the
<PB N="12" REF="038619_0010_1012A884432DC438"/>
face of prejudice and passion. Such a one they found in Mr. BENJAMIN COLMAN, a young man born in their own town, educated at their own col∣lege, but who, by a residence of four years in Eng∣land, had overcome local prejudices; and was rea∣dy to pursue a mode of church worship and dis∣cipline similar to that of the dissenting churches in England; among whom he had been an useful and acceptable preacher.—From an apprehension that he might meet with difficulty in procuring an ordi∣nation here, they requested him to ask it of the minis∣ters in London, who readily granted his desire, and by prayer, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery, he was separated to the work of the ministry, August 4, 1699.</P>
<P>THE church continued to flourish under the min∣istry of this excellent man for many years. Not long after his settlement, a proposition was made to join with him in the pastoral office a Mr. ELIPHA∣LET ADAMS. He preached to the society under this idea for two years and an half. This proposi∣tion did not succeed.</P>
<P>THE commencement of our intimate connexion with the first church in this town was in the year 1711. In consequence of the destruction of their meeting-house by fire, they assembled here for a year and an half, when their present edifice was compleated. This connexion was cemented by our being united in the lecture preparatory to the sacra∣ment. The latter union took place in the month of March, 1720. The happiness and edification of both societies have been greatly promoted by this
<PB N="13" REF="038619_0011_1012A8877994B130"/>
measure. We have felt ourselves to be in a sense one. And when either of us have needed accom∣modation, in consequence of repairing or rebuilding our respective places of worship, we have always found it with each other.</P>
<P>THE prejudices or rather taste of the age may be found from observing the refusal of the society to ac∣cept an organ bequeathed them by THOMAS BRAT∣TLE, Esq. who was their principal benefactor,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since that period there have been many large donations made to the society by its affluent and respectable members. It would be dif∣ficult to particularize all these. It is but justice however to remark, that the late Governor HANCOCK was the greatest benefactor the so∣ciety ever had. He gave the bell and a pulpit made of mahogany, and curiously carved, besides a very handsome subscription in money, at the time of rebuilding the meeting-house. He presented us also with an elegant folio bible to be read in public. He subscribed very large∣ly, and more than any individual, towards the expense of purchasing the present organ. The late Governor BOWDOIN also, with his fami∣ly and connexions, have been great benefactors to the society.</NOTE> and in a sense their founder. This took place in the year 1713, when they voted, "that they did not think proper to use the same in the public worship of GOD."</P>
<P>Aug. 16, 1715, Mr. WILLIAM COOPER was cal∣led to the pastoral office in connexion with Dr. COL∣MAN. His youth and his modesty led him to beg, that his actual separation to the work of the ministry might be delayed as long as possible. With a re∣quest, which did Mr. COOPER so much honor, the church complied, and he was not ordained till May, 1716.</P>
<P>WITH two pastors distinguished for their literary and ministerial qualifications; both warmly engaged in the service of their master, and united in their
<PB N="14" REF="038619_0012_1012A88C0264B390"/>
sentiments, their exertions and their ardent zeal, the society increased from year to year in numbers and respectability. Many "were added to the church of such as, we trust, are saved," and the candle of the LORD shone brightly on our tabernacle.</P>
<P>No cloud intervened to diminish this brightness till the month of December, 1743, when Mr. COOP∣ER was suddenly snatched from the arms of his fami∣ly and flock, and translated to a better world. Could the warmest affection, the highest esteem, the most fervent prayers of his people poured out in secret, in the family and in the church of GOD, have pro∣tracted his life, it would not have been taken away. But the will of GOD was done, and he fell in the midst of his days and usefulness.</P>
<P>BUT this heavy loss was compensated by the ap∣pearance of his son, the late excellent Dr. COOPER, in the sacred desk. In this place he commenced and terminated his ministerial labors. His mild and gen∣tle manners, his delicate taste, his brilliant talents for the services and devotions of the pulpit, as well as their regard to the memory of his father, fixed the eyes of this people upon him. Within a very few weeks they called him to office. Having dis∣covered the same modesty and made the same delay as his father had done in similar circumstances, he was ordained on the twenty-first of May, 1746.</P>
<P>THIS event was succeeded by one of a very dif∣ferent nature. On Aug. 29, 1747, the venerable Dr. COLMAN died suddenly! This great and good man possessed a capacious mind, a strong inclination for what is called belle lettre, as well as more serious
<PB N="15" REF="038619_0013_1012A88D914C0A20"/>
learning, a natural politeness, and an easy dignity of manners which commanded respect and conciliated esteem. His foreign correspondence was extensive, and his influence was always exerted to serve our college and his country.</P>
<P>No proposal has since been made to have more than one pastor at a time in the church. The late Dr. COOPER, by his exemplary life, his elegant dis∣courses, his fervent prayers, his patriotic services, and his graceful manners, acquired a very high reputation at home and abroad.—No remarkable event took place during the course of his ministry, excepting an alteration in the version of the psalms and the demo∣lition of our ancient place of worship, with the erection of the present elegant and <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This building cost six thousand pounds sterling.</NOTE> costly edifice, in which public worship was first celebrated July 25, 1773.</P>
<P>For thirty-seven years, in the course of which term our trying and distressful but glorious revolu∣tion began and was completed, Dr. COOPER contin∣ued the beloved, the useful and successful pastor of this church. But death, with inexorable hand, ar∣rested him in the zenith of his popularity and ac∣ceptance, Dec. 29, 1783. Few men have lived more esteemed, or died more lamented.</P>
<P>ON Jan. 12, 1785, I received the pastoral charge of this church. With the events which led to and succeeded this solemn transaction you are all ac∣quainted. With truth I can say, that you have done all which affection could dictate or bounty bestow, to render my life easy and respectable. That I have been so little useful to you and your children, has
<PB N="16" REF="038619_0014_1012A890779F3260"/>
been my constant burden. But may we yet see bet∣ter days on this account; And may my life and my usefulness terminate together!</P>
<P>As an evidence of the change of public opinion, I observe that the grand and melodious organ, which now assists our plasmody and devotions, was opened for the first time on the 17th day of June, 1792. That, which eighty years before was rejected when offered freely, was then procured at a great expense.</P>
<P>IT has been the honor and felicity of this church that its union has never been interrupted. In all societies there will of course be men who have an attachment to their own opinions. In this society, the gentleness of manners, the candor, condescen∣sion and brotherly love, which are the ornament and the band of religious associations, have conciliated the affection and quieted the minds of those who have thought differently from the majority. "No root of bitterness has sprung up among us." The love of peace and harmony has ever prevailed, and we have a fair prospect of continuing a happy so∣ciety.</P>
<P>AND now, my brethren, be thankful to GOD, who has so remarkably smiled upon your predecessors and yourselves even to this day. "The vineyard which his own right hand planted," has flourished and increased for one hundred years. No furious blast has overthrown it. No insidious enemy has undermined or extirpated it. We behold it this day flourishing in its original beauty, and bringing forth, we trust, the clusters of Canaan," good fruit unto GOD. It is our hearts desire and prayer to
<PB N="17" REF="038619_0015_1012A8920D610C80"/>
GOD, "that a pure and a spiritual church may be continued here so long as the sun and the moon shall endure. When we shall be gathered to the dust of our fathers, and the "places" which now know us shall know us no more, may a generation rise up which shall love GOD more, and serve him better than ever <HI>we</HI> have done. May the members of this church be more exemplary, and its ministers more useful, through all succeeding ages! May it flourish with the vigor of youth and the wisdom of age, till the present dispensation shall be compleated, and the church universal shall be translated from earth to heaven!</P>
<P>LET us reflect with delight and reverence on the immutability of GOD! The men and the things of time pass rapidly away, but he abideth "the same yesterday, to day and forever!" Although we may not "put our trust in princes nor in the sons of men, for their breath goeth forth and they also are vani∣ty," yet we may safely rely on the wisdom and good∣ness of the ruler of the universe! To his Son, our Saviour, we may safely confide our immortal inter∣terests; and in his universal government we may al∣ways rejoice, for the judge of all the earth will do right!</P>
<P>How swiftly, my brethren, does time pass away! Another year, and a full century since the institu∣tion of our religious society, have now elapsed! E∣vents, the most important to our country and the world, have taken place in it! Some of us have wit∣nessed these scenes, and others have lived many years of this century! Let us all make a solemn pause, and inquire what is our state and condition!
<PB N="18" REF="038619_0016_1012A897DA780BF8"/>
Have we improved our time and our talents, and what is the foundation of our hope towards GOD! We may never witness the close of another year; and there is not the most distant probability, (I had almost said possibility) that any one of us will see the end of another century! There is no hazard in pre∣dicting that, before another hundred years revolve over this church, every one of us, of every age and description, will be numbered with the dead, and gone to our account! Where shall we then be? In happiness or misery, in heaven or in hell? How shall we appear before the judgment seat of CHRIST, and what will be our sentence at the last day? These are solemn questions. They relate to our souls and eternity. They require serious examina∣tion, and deliberate answers. Let us this day "think on our ways, and turn our feet unto GOD's testimo∣nies. Let us make haste, and not delay to keep his commandments."</P>
<P>"OUR fathers, where are they, and the prophets, do they live forever?" The men, who once worship∣ed on this very spot, are "gone the way of all the earth," and their bones are now mouldering to dust in the dark and silent grave! Soon shall we follow them, and have no more share in any thing that is done under the sun! May GOD prepare us for this solemn hour! May GOD enable us to "serve him and our generation according to his will! And may we so worship him in his courts below as that we may be prepared to serve him, with perfect puri∣ty and happiness, in his temple above!</P>
