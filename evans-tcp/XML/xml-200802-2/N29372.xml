<Q><HI>Moreover the man Moses was very great.</HI>"</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SINGULARLY brilliant was the station, and in the highest degree important the part allotted unto Moses. To him it was assigned by the Creator and Go∣vernor of the Universe, to abase the despot Pharoah, to afflict the idolatrous Egyptians, to redress and de∣liver the long enslaved Hebrews: and finally to per∣form the many prodigies which have excited the as∣tonishment and commanded the veneration of that and of all succeeding generations. But to preserve and fit him for the accomplishment of these divine purposes, what singular providences attended him, e∣ven from the moment which announced his birth.—by parental affection at the risk of life he is preserved from the murderous mandate of a policy unexampled in cruelty; by maternal ingenuity buoy'd above the devouring surges of the Nile. In this moment of pe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il divine providence interposes, an asylum opens <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>use of his enemy. The daughter of Pharoah (and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of her hardened sire) beholds with compassion the weeping babe. Adopting him for her own son <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he immortalizes her memory as the pious patroness of the greatest of Prophets. Whilst under her sof∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>g care the foundation of his future greatness is laid▪ for science irradiating his mind; he becomes skilled in all the wisdom of the Egyptians. But now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ived at his fortieth year, and beholding an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> brother feebly contending with a too power∣ful
<PB N="4" REF="039116_0003_1013A907CE2BD2A8"/>
and insulting Egyptian, he, under an impulsive presentiment, slays the petty despot. But his breth∣ren, not knowing that by him is their future deliv∣erance to be wrought, refuse his mediation in their quarrels; and ungenerously threatening his life he is constrained to fly for refuge to the land of Midian, where generously succouring the daughters of Jethro', he tarries in the land, and becomes the son-in-law of Midian's priest. Possess'd of true greatness, he chear∣fully exchanges the splendours of a court for the sim∣plicity of the pastoral life; and during an exile of forty years, in undecaying vigour, partakes all the en∣joyments of domestic bliss.</P>
<P>BUT Israel's oppressions wax heavier, their groanings penetrate the skies, their God comes down to deliver them, their champion is forced from his beloved so∣litude, he must now endure the gaze of the multitude, the bustle of a court, and amidst the toils and anxie∣ties of a camp spend the residue of his devoted days. But he goes not a warfare at his own expence, he is commissioned to Pharoah, and arrayed in divine ar∣mour, his rod becomes a serpent; it is stretched forth, the waters of Egypt become blood; he predicts, and murrain and blain arrest both man and beast; the listing up of his hand is more terrible than armies with banners. It is the signal, and reptiles and locusts in hosts innumerable devour the blasted crops. The sun also refuses his chearing beams, and fire, hail, and tem∣pest fill with consternation the smitten and despond∣ing Egyptians. At this period it was that the eleva∣tion of character mentioned in our text was ascribed to the Hebrew champion, viz. that <HI>"The man Moses was very great in the Land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharoah's servants, and in the sight of the people."</HI>—But how much greater will he presently appear, when according to his word we behold the sudden fall of Egypt's first born, the emancipation and triumphant march of Israel's hosts, when at the stretching forth of his rod the red sea cleaves in sunder, and for Israel rears on either hand its adamantine walls; and when
<PB N="5" REF="039116_0004_1013A90950F59168"/>
on the same signal it entombs Pharaoh and his pur∣suing legions. But we cannot trace through forty years the progress of his rising greatness, suffice it to observe, that as the Jews beheld in Moses (as the instrument of divine providence) the founder of their religion and institutor of their civil polity: So to him as an historian and prophet are all nations indebted for the only genuine elements of the history of man; and accurate developement of the true principles of morality; whilst in his mighty works, the friend of religion, adoringly, beholds displayed the finger of his God.</P>
<P>BUT the doctrinal inference which we would here deduce for the theme of this occasion is, The providence of God over human affairs; and more especially as displayed in his raising up at eventful periods, preeminently distinguished characters, for the accomplishment of purposes in the highest degree benevolent. Tracing then, briefly these providen∣tial dispensations, we will advert to them as relating to the Jewish nation—as displayed towards the Gen∣tiles—and lastly, as affecting the most important in∣terests of these highly favoured States.</P>
<P>As to the Jewish nation, we behold their fathers seeking in Egypt an asylum from famine. To their descendants it proves an house of bondage. But are the purposes of Abraham's God now baffled, or shall his promises fail of accomplishment—nay in the pre∣dicted deliverence of his covenant people and over∣throw of their task-masters, we behold pourtrayed, in the most striking characters, his compassion for the distressed, and indignation against oppressors. Yes, ye oppressed Poles—ye long enslaved sons and daugh∣ters of Africa! ye hapless children of bondage, in every age and nation, in Israel's deliverance behold the certain pledge of your own—Whilst in Pharoah's overthrow, ye tyrants of the earth, learn to anticipate your own swiftly approaching doom.—But e'er Is∣rael has reached the promised land, is their venera∣ble
<PB N="6" REF="039116_0005_1013A90C1CE406D0"/>
deliverer called to sleep with his fathers! Still they are not forsaken—their God he slumbereth not—the faithful and valiant Joshua leads them over Jor∣dan. The iniquity of the Amorites is now full, and their land becomes the inheritance of more faithful Israel. But is Joshua also called to go the way of all flesh, and is back-sliding, but now penitent Israel, groaning under the yoke of surrounding nations—behold in their turns what champions are raised up, a Sampson, a Jephtha, a Gideon, a David, an Elijah and Elisha, a Jehosephat and Josiah, and a Judas Maccabeus.</P>
<P>BUT when the Lord called Abraham and his pos∣terity did he cast away the Gentiles? Regarded then no more the God of the universe the nations whom himself had formed. Nay even amongst the Gentiles is found the patient and perfect Job, the approved Cyrus, and pious Cornelius, and over the interests and concerns of all nations and individuals does the common parent of all, unceasingly extend his watch∣ful Providence. In the fall of Belshazzar, and tri∣umphs of the Medes and Persians, we behold redres∣sed the wrongs of prostrate nations. The Persians degenerate, and in their turn are the spoilers of the earth; how are their innumerable hosts discomfited at Marathon! and how their perverted power ut∣terly broken by Macedonia's impetuous youth. Is it designed that Greece should in her politics exhibit the models of well ordered communities; that in her liberty should long display her all-invigorating influence; and that as the lamp of science and the re∣fined arts, she should shine on surrounding and re∣motest nations. But to constitute this very Greece, or to preserve it from enemies potent and malignant; how at successive and eventful periods, as the instruments of God, do arise an Homer and Solon, a Lycurgus and Thales, a Socrates, and Aristotle, a Demosthenes, a Themistocles and Aristides, with others not less il∣lustrious</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="039116_0006_1013A9100FD72D00"/>
Is Rome to become next the theatre of events au∣spicious unto man? Is a greater than Moses, under her jurisdiction, seat to dispel the mists of superstition, which long had degraded the character and debased the hearts of men? Is he in miracles more numerous and benevolent than the prodigies of Moses to pro∣claim himself at once the Prince and the Messenger of Peace? Is he, and are his Apostles, to disseminate through the nations that religion which, uniting man to man, in the sacred bonds of brotherhood; and which by faith elevating them to union with the Father of Spirits brings into vision the regions of im∣mortal felicity?</P>
<P>To effect then purposes, so superlatively bene∣ficial, it becomes expedient that Rome should arise, should extend her influence, civilize barbarians, unite distant and remote provinces, and establish through her wide domain, laws equal and uniform. But to rear and sustain a fabric so stupendous, belonged not to feeble hands, it required the prowess and talents of a Romulus and Numa—a Brutus and Poplicola—a Cincinnatus and Fabius. The amiable Scipios, and others, with genius and virtues no less transcendant. Nor have modern nations and times been destitute of characters great, amiable, and illustrious. Britain justly boasts her great Alfred—France (even repub∣lican France) her Henry the Fourth. With Doria's greatness towers that of his country. Helvetia produ∣ces the illustrious Tell. And even barbarous Russia receives with the arts a polish from her first Peter.</P>
<P>BUT whilst the Eastern Continents thus soar each in its turn to distinguished greatness, the Western, though more vast in extent, various in its climes, and luxuriant in its productions, is but too much a blank in the system of the universe; for with some excep∣tions it is but the haunt of the monsters of the wil∣derness; or of men scarce less ferocious than their brethren of the desert. To give it then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>

the Maps of the World; and rescue from oblivion<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>It is supposed that the ancients had some faint idea of this country.</HI></NOTE> so vast a portion of the globe, it required the efforts of a genius no less penetrating, adventurous and per∣severing than that of the immortal Columbus.</P>
<P>BUT what availed it to us, that he thus exploring the trackless deep, had enlarged the boundaries of the habitable universe; that your ancestors fleeing from oppression civil and ecclesiastical had sought a refuge in the wilds of America. Or that thro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h theirs, and the toils, privations and virtues of their children and successors, the wilderness had become a garden, and towns and cities, numerous, populous and flou∣rishing had arisen; I say what had availed all this, if when a power become unnatural through pride, in∣solent from wealth, and imperious through victory, now trampling on your rights and sporting with your properties, your liberties and lives, if in this day of calamity divine providence had not raised up for you a champion, rivalling in fame and transcending in glory, the renowned heroes of the old world? It is true when Britain's canvas whiten'd the ocean, when it groan'd beneath the hosts of her mercenaries, myriads of brave men, in whose estimation death was preferable to bondage, suddenly arose in their coun∣try's defence, but as ardour without discipline, and valour without order are impotent, so multitudes without a leader must have yielded in the day of con∣flict▪ on WASHINGTON then every eye was fixed; in him all hearts confided. Auspicious choice! he that at three and twenty sagely counselled Braddock; who with his gallant Virginians saved from the tom∣ahawk and scalping knife, legions of flying veterans; will not in the sanguine field disappoint his country's expectations.—Nor will that citizen who in rural scenes, or legislative councils for twenty years, hath evinced the combination of public and private vir∣tues and abilities when victorious subvert the vin∣dicated
<PB N="9" REF="039116_0008_1013A91691E7EC60"/>
rights of his native land. Illustrious man▪ thy fame bestrides the Universe. Poets sing thy mighty deeds, and orators pourtray thy many virtues; and yet thy character needs only the historian's faithful pen, simple narration is alone sufficient; for so di∣versified and numerous are thy great actions, that they contain in themselves embellishments beyond the pow∣ers of feeble art. But as custom hath authorized, and as the circumstances of the day may require some tribute to his memory, permit me to attempt a faint portraiture of the Mount-Vernon Hero. The cha∣racter of WASHINGTON to be justly appreciated, and properly understood, must be contemplated in a variety of lights. It is military, it is political, it is moral, and it may also be estimated from comparison. Nor will this variety exhaust it, it is like the pure gold which diminishes not in the crucible. His mi∣litary talents altho' the most splendid, yet perhaps were the least estimable trait in his high character; not that his abilities in the field were slender, but be∣cause the science of slaughter seems to partake in it∣self of the nature of calamity; and is only valuable from its averting evils of greater magnitude. De∣fensive warfare is alone rational and just; and it was in this that our Fabius peculiarly excelled. Yes, he was the man of whom truly it hath been said, "his prudence saved what valor would have lost." But in what a cause is he engaged, the liberties of his country. The independence of numerous states, the glory of a rising and vast republic hanging dubious in the pendant scale; on the one hand are hords of veterans with every implement of destruction, led on by chiefs long drilled in military science; on the o∣ther are the sons of freedom, but often few in number, half armed, conflicting with hunger, nakedness and want; but WASHINGTON is there; the die is cast, the scale preponderates, and Columbia's chief, crowned with victory, and rewarded with the applaud∣ing voice of his grateful country, like another Cin∣cinnatus, retires to his beloved scenes of husbandry.</P>
<P>But as in his military atchievements, with prudence the most consummate, he displayed dauntless courage▪ and a fortitude that was invincible; so in his politi∣cal
<PB N="10" REF="039116_0009_10136E73744462E8"/>
capacity he was no less transcendant. When he assumed the highest station in the Federal Govern∣ment, that government was itself, but in imperfect o∣peration▪ no precedents to guide his dubious way, he must himself originate them. In Europe already had the fermentation of Liberty, of Tyranny, and of Crimes, mingled their chaotic mass. With that country these states were connected by existing trea∣ties. There the political horizon darkened, tremen∣dous concussions were felt, revolution succeeded re∣volution; whilst civil liberty, religion, morality, rea∣son and property, became alternately the sport of conflicting factions, of regal tyrants, or of philoso∣phising lunatics. And whilst the most disastrous of wars laid waste the fairest provinces of the world, this country though distant three thousand miles, yet it was menaced by the approaching and dire calamity. But if with the preservation of our faith with all na∣tions, we yet enjoy so great a measure of peace, and if in those days of adversity which seldom have had a parallel, such a tide of unexampled prosperity has flowed in on us, I would ask, to whom, under provi∣dence are we indebted? Or who hath parried from us the blow, which robbing us of peace, would have wrested from us, this accumulating good? Is it not to WASHINGTON we are thus indebted? and was it not his quick, discerning mind, which foreseeing, repelled the efforts of our foes, by his well-timed pro∣clamation of neutrality. But whilst the first interests of his high charge, were thus secured under his guar∣dian eye, need you be informed that those of smaller magnitude were also duly cherished under his foster∣ing hand; you have seen it in his repeated Addresses to both Houses of the Federal Legislature; in his in∣comparable Farewell Address, and uniformly through his illustrious administration of eight years. The virtues of WASHINGTON demand now attention; but though thus mentioned subsequent to his military and political talents, it is not from a supposition that they were either less evident, or less valuable. The evi∣dences of his virtues were so brilliant and irresistable as to convince enemies and annihilate suspicion. And so important is virtue itself, as ever to transcend all
<PB N="11" REF="039116_0010_1013A91D03866F70"/>
other gifts or acquirements however splendid. An able General, or profound Politician, if destitute of justice, of integrity, or compassion, or what is the same thing, if void of the fear of God, from whence those virtues originate, may become like Arnold, a traitor, or like Attilla, "the scourge of God;" but if power or interest invites, never like WASHING∣TON, the benefactor of his Country. The victory which this illustrious man obtained over his passions, how did it elevate him above the Ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ian, who was lately the chief dependence of the leagued monarchs. Suwarrow grown grey in victory, and conqueror in thirty pitched battles, meets with a single repulse in Switzerland, his haughty soul chagrined, and brood∣ing over his disaster, feels all the mortification of de∣feat. He who had predicted that like a tyger he should howl in Italy, now in rage retiring to Lindau, and yielding to all the impotence of passion, in his chamber growls like a monster in his den. But WASHINGTON with the same dignified compo∣sure, as when victorious, he received a check, or sus∣tained defeat; for resigned to and confiding in the God of Battles, even from disaster he soon finds means to originate fresh victories.</P>
<P>IT is sometimes the frailty of even great men, to be avaricious; the alloy in others is the undue love of power. Had any tincture of the former been in the heart of the man we all admire, the corrupt∣ing millions of Britain would have discovered the contaminated spot, had the latter been his propensity, he had the opportunity to have become a second Cromwell. But as the virtues of Washington were luminous so they were also solid; and for this reason because they originated from the fear of his Creator; and because they originated here, they were uniform through the variety of high stations which he filled, and from this uniformity, arose that peculiarity of character, by which he is so pre-eminently distin∣guished.</P>
<P>MILITARY Talents alone, have often procured the appellation of greatness to their possessors; politi∣cal abilities have been viewed as meriting the same reward, and superior virtue is self-evidently more
<PB N="12" REF="039116_0011_1013A91F9D072ED0"/>
worthy of it, than either; but when in one man we thus behold the concentration of them all, and of them all in so transcendant a degree; we discover a subli∣mity and elevation of character, but rarely if ever found amongst the frail descendants of Adam.</P>
<P>BUT in estimating this high character from com∣parison,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Some little addition is here <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; from a discourse delivered by the Author. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Sunday, Jan; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th; 1880; from I Thes. IV. 14 occasioned by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> personage in question.</HI></NOTE> we must recall the great theatres of action on which this very character itself, exhibited to pub∣lic view, its every trait.</P>
<P>WE must remember that WASHINGTON was a member of the first Congress. That he accepted the chief command of the Colonial Armies when subjec∣tion would have denominated him the leader of re∣bellion. That through a long and arduous struggle he had not only an army to command, but in some measure also; that army to create. That his final tri∣umph was the establishment of his country's inde∣pendence. That in the Convention which origina∣ted the admired fabric of our Federal government he filled the first and most influential place.—That as he was the first, so he was twice unanimously chosen to be the Magistrate who should guide the supreme councils of the newly constructed government.—That though stricken in years, the voice of his coun∣try finds him once more obedient to her call, and rea∣dy if needful to lead her vigorous youth against the embattled foe. And lastly, That when his cup of human felicity is full, his country rejoicing around him, and he just about to step into the infirmities of old age▪ he in peace is called to sleep with his fathers; and with a placid confidence worthy of his former greater greatness, bids his last adieu to terrestrial ob∣jects; I ask where, amongst men is the greatness that can compare with his? Amongst the Kings there is none worthy, Freedom's Champion will not rank with those who combined to strangle her at her birth—La Fayette and Kosciusco, even if successful were but his pupils. Doria and Tell, tho' great of stature were not half his height. The first Brutus bore some resemblance, but he fell in battle, e'er his country's
<PB N="13" REF="039116_0012_1013A92120BE7240"/>
cause was vindicated; in short to form the portrait∣ure of our hero, you must select the wisdom of a So∣lon, the integrity of an Aristides, the amiableness of the Scipios, the prudence of a Fabius, the simplicity and greatness of Cincinnatus, with the piety and pros∣perity of Cyrus: concentrate these and you behold a WASHINGTON</P>
<P>BUT what is human glory? or what the life of the most illustrious? The one is a vapor—the other like the fading flower.—Oh death▪ potent is thine arm; Kings hast thou slain and Nobles hast cast down—but now greater is thy triumph, for before thee the mighty is fallen—the man of war—the pru∣dent—the ancient—the honourable. Venerable Pa∣rent of thy country! vain for thee are now our plaints. The tears of millions confess to thee in vain the weight of obligation—thou art now beyond the reach of mortal tribute—with thy God alone is the measure of thy actions, with him the weight of thy reward.</P>
<P>THE numerous testimonials of gratitude, dis∣played throughout these States; although they en∣hance not the bliss of our regretted Benefactor; yet they may stimulate successors high in office, to tread a luminous path already traced; and by impressing on our national character the ideas of ability to discern, and eagerness, to reward merit, may contribute to wipe from Republics, the reproach of jealousy and ingratitude towards their most brilliant and deserv∣ing sons. But whilst we thus secure the character of being grateful and political, let us not forfeit that of being religious; let nothing that is done favour of idolatry; let not that tribute be paid to a creature, that is due to God alone; from second causes let our gratitude, our affections, our hopes, all ascend to the great, the first, the only, the transcendant cause of all. If WASHINGTON was prepared, was raised up, was girded with strength, and made victorious, to Jehovah alone belongeth the high praise, to him who raised up the wise, the illustrious, the mighty of all ages—and who, should we need, and be found worthy of them, will raise up yet to us, heroes and deliverers not less excelling.</P>
<P>PAUSING now to contemplate the subjects thus
<PB N="14" REF="039116_0013_1013A922AC25D588"/>
discussed, we discover an error no less popular than pernicious, viz. the modern doctrine of the equality of man. That all men have (unless forfeited by crimes) an equal claim to the unmolested possession of liberty, of property and life, none but the assassin, the robber, or the despot will deny. And christianity in maintaining our descent from one first pair, pro∣claims aloud our equality in nature. But when we behold the transcendant characters from Moses down to Washington, vast inequalities appear. We then perceive men, rising above men, even as the lofty pine or towering cedar out tops the shrubs on which the cattle browse. And how essential this variety, without it there were no heroes to have rescued from oppression, no Columbus to have led our way across the dreary deep—no Sages, Prophets or Apostles who teach the way to God—no accommodating artist nor ingenuity which yields embellishment—no Newton scrutinizing nature's poize—nor Herschel, who, to bring us tidings, traversed the lunar orb—nor yet a Bacon making visible the microscopal world.</P>
<P>AND thro' this variety, are we not admonished of the expediency of order, and subordination in socie∣ty? Is not the latter as an army in the day of con∣flict, where insubordination yields but defeat and ru∣in? Or is it not a body politick, with an head and various members; all suited to their several offices; no part superfluous, but each essential, to the vigour, health and safety of the whole? Nor let us be dis∣couraged, should ours be an inferior station in this body. The part alloted us, if adapted to our talents is the only one we can perform with honour or ad∣vantage. Let us remember, that in the estimation of God it is not greatness but goodness that is rewarda∣ble with bliss. And that superior talents, abused or neglected here, will receive hereafter but the greater condemnation; whilst the meanest talent faithfully occupied in this life, will through the rewards of grace in Christ, entitle its pious possessor, to inconcievably greater felicity and honour, in the immortal regions, than even WASHINGTON possessed, in this world in all his glory. But I would now address the mili∣tary officers, who assembled in the house of mourn∣ing,
<PB N="15" REF="039116_0014_1013A925449BBBB8"/>
feel impressively, in their Country's loss, a double portion of bereavement.</P>
<P>GENTLEMEN, You have now heard the small tri∣bute paid the memory of the late illustrious Head and Arm of our Republic. Like Sheba's Queen you are ready to say "The one half hath not been told us." You know better his great worth. There are some amongst you who stood with him in the day of his Country's danger; who beheld him stand as an host where danger most impended, who imbibed his spirit and learned from him to conquer. You saw him at Trenton and Princeton nobly roll back the swelling tide of adverse war—You saw his many victories, his final triumph, and virtuous retirement to rural scenes. You beheld him twice unanimously chosen to fill, with unrivalled dignity and talents, the Presidential chair. Again he girds his armour on, and you rejoice that under such a Leader you shall repel the hostile approaching foe. But you have heard the tidings our Father is no more—Have witnessed your Country all in tears—Our temples shrouded in the habiliments of sorrow—and now you wish to honour the memory of him, whose name ages yet unborn shall long revere. Transcribe then into your hearts and lives his many virtues. If called to the sanguine field combine prudence with valour—scientific ingenuity with force. In civil life be like him the first to yield homage to the laws. In office, civil or military, let integrity, punctuality, and vigilance, characterize like his your every action, maintain inviolably the Federal Consti∣tution. WASHINGTON aided in its construction and was clad in armour for its defence; it is the for∣tress, in which are deposited the liberties and inde∣pendence of your Country. But above all contem∣plate eternity; this only is substance, all else is shadow. What availed it in the moment of mortality to our be∣loved prostrate Chief, that a nation should decree him many honours, that millions should weep for him, or his name fill the fairest page of history? Nought then availed him but religion. Secure then by faith the favour of him, in whose name alone is salvation; whose death destroyed the power of death: and whose resurrection, proclaims immortality, the por∣tion of the just.</P>

PERMIT me also now, to address, briefly, the assembly?</P>
<P>FRIENDS, Brethren and Fathers: With our deep regret we should this day also combine grateful ac∣knowledgements: for, rich has been the distribution of providential gifts to these states. There was a WASHINGTON—a <HI>Montgomery</HI>—a <HI>Greene</HI>—a <HI>Warren</HI>—and many whom we must now omit—There is still an ADAMS, and others high in office, replete with talents and virtues. The best expres∣sions of our gratitude to God for characters so inesti∣mable; will be to encourage these his servants in their several stations, by our earnest prayers for their prosperity, and by a chearful and ready submission to all their constitutional and lawful appointments.</P>
<P>BUT whilst we pay tribute to illustrious merit found in men, or mourn our fallen chief; let us not forget his bereaved consort. He was freedom's champion, she at his intimation announces the free∣dom of her slaves; he endured the toils, anxieties and dangers of eight years warfare, she yielded him up, and sympathising partook the whole. He now bath ceased his labours, but she bereaved feels with indi∣vidual force a nation's sorrow. Illustrious woman <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> worthy such an helpmate? Thy sex too have adorn∣ed the page of history: even from the fair and pious patroness of Moses down to thy favoured self. Was there a valiant and victorious Barak.
