<P>HE DIED IN A GOOD OLD AGE, FULL OF DAYS, RICHES AND HONOUR.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the course of the Providential dispensations of Almighty God, our nation is called to contemplate an event, which arrests the powers, and awakens the most pathetic sensibilities of the human heart. Alrea∣dy, for a considerable time, have our eyes witnessed the tokens of general mourning, and our ears been assailed with the language of public grief. From ev∣ery part of our common country, does the plaint of sorrow arise, and every gale, as it passes by, is loaded with the groans and sighs of a distressed people. Not only do our sanctuaries of justice and of law, and our sacred asylums of religion, mourn; not only do our officers of state, our distinguished citizens, and the war-worn veteran, appear in the badges of woe; but all, from the aged who remembers the deeds of former times, to the youth who anticipates the future; all of
<PB N="6" REF="037709_0005_100EF1AF12BA24C8"/>
every description and every rank, feel an oppressive heaviness at the heart. And, when we look around upon this great and respectable assembly, and mark the eye suddenly suffused with the tear of sad recol∣lection; when especially we reflect that on <HI>this</HI> day, a whole nation, moved by the impulse of one great sor∣row, is engaged in the observance of solemnites, of which these before us form a part, we are constrained to conclude, that some disastrous change has occurred, that some dreadful loss has been sustained.</P>
<P>What then thou nation highly favored of heaven! what has produced this universal appearance of dis∣tress? From thy loftiest mountains, and thy loveliest vales, why ascends to the sky, the plaintive concert of <HI>weeping, lamentation</HI> and <HI>woe</HI>? Has the enemy rolled like a flood upon thy peaceful shores, and threatened to deluge with crimes and blood, thine extensive plains? Are thine old men devoted to death, thy daughters to shame, thy sons to slavery? Has the arm of tyranny seized upon thy rights, and extinguished the hallowed flame upon thine altars of freedom?— No!—But the leader of our armies—the founder of our infant republic—the guide of our councils—the patriot, who united and swayed all hearts—is no more! The great, the illustrious WASHINGTON, the pride of his country, the ornament of mankind—sleeps in dust!</P>
<P>Draw near, ye companions of his toils, ye who
<PB N="7" REF="037709_0006_100EF1B09AF07430"/>
fought by his side, who were animated by his patriot∣ism, and breathed his martial spirit; draw near, ye counsellors, who shone in the cabinet, and assisted his efforts by your wisdom and your virtue; draw near, ye sons and daughters of America, whose sacred birth∣right he defended with his sword, and guaranteed by the bulwark of his impregnable name; draw near, with solemn step to his tomb. Here, behold once more, your hero, friend, father; and while the copious tear bedews your cheek, and the strong beat of the heart, checks your utterance, look a long—a painful—a last adieu. August in death, "his form has not yet lost all her original greatness." Firmness, prudence, valor, resignation, still are seated upon that countenance, now fixed and pale, where they lately shone in the most vivid expression; for they presided over all the emotions and energies of his heart. But the immortal <HI>spirit has returned to God who gave it,</HI> and left the earthly habitation to assimilate with its native dust. That eye no more beams on virtue, with the cheering ray of friendship; nor with its piercing glance, unnerves the strength of vice, and overawes the confi∣dence of base ambition. That great heart, which al∣ways beat in unison, with the impulse of patriotism, and glowed with love for his country, is now lifeless as the tongue of calumny, and cold as the clay which surrounds it. His arm is deprived of its vigor, and his
<PB N="8" REF="037709_0007_100EF1B337577EE8"/>
sword, the terror of our foes, sleeps harmless at his side. That singular assemblage of virtues and of tal∣ents, which constituted the unprecedented glory of his character—which was more than a host for the defence of a nation's rights—more efficacious than the force of law, sanctioned with the dread of penalty, to repress the licentious daring of faction—and which, under the guidance and patronage of Providence, asserted our lib∣erties, and achieved our independence—is now, unex∣pectedly removed from the terrestrial sphere, which it illumined and adorned. It can now no longer be displayed in the wisdom of counsel, in the splendor of action, in the consummation of great design. Placed beyond our view, it flourishes and expands in those regions where <HI>mortal puts on immortality,</HI> and perfection is added to perfection.</P>
<P>While therefore as men, and as Americans, we lament the loss which our country and the world has sustained, let us mingle the tears of joy with the tears of grief, and with the sadness of sorrow unite the sentiment of gratitude—that humanity is susceptible of such ex∣cellence, and that America can boast such a transcen∣dant character, as appeared in that illustrious person∣age, whose exit we deplore, but whose pre-eminent greatness we can never cease to admire. Let us not forget to praise that Almighty and Merciful Being, who is good, both in what he gives and in what he
<PB N="9" REF="037709_0008_100EF1B5134FC960"/>
takes away. Let us thank him that WASHINGTON has been continued so long with us; and that he has <HI>died in a good old age, full of days, riches and honor.</HI></P>
<P>Through numberless toils, and imminent dangers, he has been preserved, by the protection of Providence, to be a most distinguished instrument of blessings to his country. At the commencement of his bright ca∣reer, at the origin of that grand movement, which gave birth to a nation, and laid the broad basis of a mighty empire; what impenetrable darkness hovered over the prospects of adventurous hope! What certain destruction seemed to threaten the bravery which should dare to resist oppression! At that eventful cri∣sis, when insult and wrong goaded a patient and suf∣fering people into desperation, and urged them to seek redress by an appeal to arms, America called up∣on her WASHINGTON, and placed her interests under his guardianship. Go, unfurl my banners—fight my battles—seek the post of danger—gain lasting renown by victory—or die, covered with glory. He bowed, and received the shining blade from her hand, the in∣signia of office from her authority, and the honor of high responsibility, from her unlimited confidence, in his virtue. Already does the lambent flame begin to play around his head—pledge of that splendor which was soon to irradiate and encircle his name. Already does his country feel the animation of hope, and an∣ticipate
<PB N="10" REF="037709_0009_100EF1B7448E07E8"/>
an early and successful issue of the eventful contest.</P>
<P>But before this hope could be realized, he must first ascend those "steep acclivities of fame," where the deathless laurel had never yet been plucked by mor∣tal band. Who can justly estimate and duly praise that disinterested and sublime magnanimity, which, had it met with final defeat, must have encountered death, and more hateful ignominy? For, the noblest motives, the purest principles of action, and the very heaven of virtues, when marshalled against ty∣ranny, cannot fail to be detestable to tyrants, and devoted to infamy by their adherents and their slaves. What would have been the unhappy fate of that hero, whom God and man now delight to honor, had not success crowned his exertions, I leave you to ga∣ther from the rewards of defeated patriotism, in other ages and among other nations. But nothing moves his firm mind. The danger of infamy vanishes, and the hedious spectacle of ignominious death, appears invested with the badges of renown, when he turns his eye upon his country. The scene before him is truly grand; but it is the grandeur of terror. It is the ocean tempested into fury, and shrowded with the mantle of sevenfold night! Such a scene, nothing but fortitude, rendered invincible by trust in God, could have contemplated with composure, much less have launched into it, with the dependant interests of millions yet unborn.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="037709_0010_100ED3CDF8ACD1D0"/>A mighty kingdom, rich in resource, proud in the prowess of her arms, terrible to the nations of Eu∣rope, pours into the bosom of our country, her trained and intrepid bands. To oppose this front of menacing danger, he had an army, not destitute in∣deed of patience, of principle, and of native va∣lor; but, collected from the plough, and the various employments of domestic tranquillity, where was that strict dicipline, that consummate military know∣ledge, that prompt and accurate obedience to orders, the effect only of experience and martial habit, which communicate to an army the identity of one soul, and the momentum of one great exertion? All was wanting with those whom he led to the field. All must be supplied by his ever-active valor, by the wisdom of plan, by the choice of position, by the all-important precautions of his unfailing prudence, by a fortitude which disaster could never depress, nor prosperity elate, by the unwearied and wonderful ef∣fects of a quick, comprehensive, divining genius, in a word, by inspiring his fellow soldiers with a con∣fidence which no disappointments could shake, and no suspicions undermine.</P>
<P>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se faculties and qualifications, ever prepared to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, displayed themselves during the continuance of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> war, with exhaustless energy and undiminish∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.

<PB N="12" REF="037709_0011_100EF1BAA595D380"/>
moment to defeat the enemy by surprize; or, in avoiding battle, to conquer him by delay. Now he exerts his undaunted <HI>fortitude</HI>—deaths surround him,—thick darkness covers—destruction threatens his country. Now, we see him exercise his large and consummate <HI>knowledge of the human heart,</HI> in silencing murmurs, in allaying fears, in rekindling hope, in communicating to a small, destitute, defeated army, a portion of that greatness which upheld, and that patriotism which inflamed his soul. He was the spring which moved, the very spirit which informed and actuated that system of measures, which wrought our political redemption. Had he then fallen, who but could have predicted the disastrous consequences? Then, you my fellow citizens, would have fallen— thou my country—never more to rise! Had he then fallen, the American eagle, who hovered with sub∣lime wing over the standard of freedom, would have dropped the immortal wreath from his beak, and the thunders from his grasp, and been no more a bird of war.</P>
<P>But that God, who loved our country, protected her most favored son. The winged death which prostrates thousands, on his right hand and on his left, harms not him; for the ANGEL of the LORD of HOSTS interposes his shield, and averts from the bo∣som of our chieftain, the perilous stroke.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="037709_0012_100EF1BC456E6180"/>He lived to see the prospects of hope brighten into reality. After experiencing the various fortunes of war, be saw his country victorious; rise resplendent among the nations, and repose upon the bosom of peace. Through eight years of toil, embarrassment and blood; led by the unexampled perseverance, un∣bending fortitude, unerring prudence, and ardent pat∣riotism of her beloved WASHINGTON, she advanced with augmented greatness, with increasing prowess and splendor, to independence, liberty, glory. On her progress, the eyes of the just and good, of every clime, were fixed, with the most painful solicitude. On the great result, the nations of the earth gaze with growing wonder. Such a combination of virtues had been displayed; such feats of valor had been achieved; such exhaustless hatred to tyranny, and such unquenchable love of liberty had pervaded the country, that the whole series of events connected with the revolution, and their splendid consummation, proclaimed the distinguished interference of Heaven.</P>
<P>But while many partook of the acquired renown, WASHINGTON shone the most magnificent object of a nation's love, and a world's admiration. Victory, he had won in the field; but he had gained a more noble conquest over the hearts of his countrymen. The flood tide of his fortune was now full, and could have
<PB N="14" REF="037709_0013_100EF1BEF9534330"/>
borne him to empire, accompanied with acclamation and surrounded with fame.—But, no darkness gath∣ers upon the disk of his glory. High authority, he possessed, but he exercised it only for the public good. Great power, he wielded, but after the ends for which it had been conferred were accomplished, he deposit∣ed it, with the badges of supreme command, on the altar of his country. The laurels which covered him, now shot forth into bloom, and he retired from office, "bearing his blushing honors thick upon him."— <Q>Sublime spectacle! more elevating to the pride of virtue, than the sovereignty of the globe, united to the sceptre of ages! Enthroned in the hearts of his countrymen, the gorgeous pageantry of prerogative, was unworthy the majesty of his dominion.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eulogy, by <HI>Thomas Paine,</HI> Esq. of Boston.</NOTE> Am∣bition had no place in his heart, or now, it would have protruded its aspiring front. Ambition—shrunk into timidity at his frown, and crouched to the earth, whence it sprang. Ambition—was infinitely be∣neath the towering sublimity of his mind; for his pure heart was fixed on heaven. Had he been sway∣ed by the selfish principles, which roused the soul of a Caesar; which animated the bravery of an Alexan∣der; which nourished the guile, and governed the conduct of a Cromwell; with equal eclat your battles might have been fought, and your victories won; but
<PB N="15" REF="037709_0014_100EF1C0D7B9E9E0"/>
the great object of your contest would have been lost; perhaps, lost forever. <Q>But that effulgence of mili∣tary character, which in ancient states, has blasted the rights of the people, whose renown it had brightened, was not <HI>here</HI> permitted by the hero from whom it emanated, to shine with so destructive a lustre.</Q><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See the Eulogy before mentioned.</NOTE></P>
<P>No! his sword thirsted not for blood. His arm was not lifted up for conquest. While he fought for the <HI>defence</HI> of all you hold most dear, the havoc ne∣cessary for attaining success, he sincerely deplored. Amid the din of arms, the carnage of death, and the hottest rage of battle, he listened to the <HI>still small voice</HI> of humanity in his breast. In the midst of his most bril∣liant exploits, his eye was turned toward the shades, and his heart panted for the tranquillity of domestic scenes. He lived to gratify this ardent, inherent desire; and with the unaspiring dignity of the first of citizens, re∣turned to his humble retirement, pursued by the tears, the prayers, the affections of an emancipated, a grateful people. There repose, thou magnanimous hero! There feast upon the sweet recollection of the past, and the delightful hope of the future. There cultivate those virtues which always governed thine own great heart; and cherish that divine religion, which afforded thee unfailing support in the severest
<PB N="16" REF="037709_0015_100EF1C263340620"/>
emergencies; and which thy conduct and thy death∣less name, honor with perpetual eulogy. There, let the growing splendors of thy greatness, continually surround and guard the retreat of hallowed solitude.</P>
<P>But no! Heaven saw fit to counteract this predom∣inant inclination—for the orb of his glory was not yet full. Heaven had made him for distinguished use∣fulness—had raised him up and furnished him with the most admirable qualifications, for enlarging the sphere of human happiness. Again he is called upon by his country; again he deems it the voice of God. His most favorite pursuits are instantly abandoned, and he appears once more, with the renewed and swelling-applause of the people whom he loved, on the splen∣did theatre of action. Again—but why need I rep∣resent him presiding over those deliberations of the collected wisdom of America, which gave birth to a constitution, free in its principles; wise in its divi∣sion, arrangement and balance of power; admirable for the energy which it communicates to authority, and for those wholesome restraints, to which that au∣thority is subjected: a constitution, not only the ad∣miration of the present age, but destined to command the reverence of posterity, to the latest generations? Why need I mention, that, after a free people had sanctioned with their high approbation, this sacred charter of their rights, he was chosen by unanimous
<PB N="17" REF="037709_0016_100EF1C4EB34F578"/>
suffrage, to fill the chair of Chief Magistrate; to give the first impulse to a grand and comprehensive sys∣tem; to enter upon a new and untried field of ope∣rations; to expose his untarnished laurels to the mil∣dew of calumny; and under the burden of encreased years, to wield, to adjust, to harmonize the various interests of a widely-extended empire? Shall I endeav∣or to delineate the features of that wisdom, which was quick to discern, and of that prudence, which was prompt to pursue, the only path of safety and honor, amid the jealousies and contentions of rival nations, and the commotions of the most astonishing revolu∣tion, that ever shook and appalled the earth? Must you be informed, that like the angel, "who rides in the whirlwind, and directs the storm," he reigned over the inflamed passions of men; and by the mighty ma∣gic of his influence, restrained and assuaged the tem∣pest of faction? Standing upon the broad basis of his own impregnable virtues, he could hear unmoved the censures of mistaken zeal, and pity, while his duty obliged him to oppose, that blind affection and stu∣pid gratitude, which would have plunged our country into the whirlpool of European politics? Need you be told, that he did not aim at popularity, riches, glo∣ry; but that the invariable object of his pursuit, was the real interests of his country? Yes, Americans, the peace which we now enjoy, and the tranquillity with
<PB N="18" REF="037709_0017_100EF1C6E258B598"/>
which we are blessed, are, under the kind Providence of Heaven, to be ascribed to that anticipating wisdom, that rectitude of principle, that undeviating justice, which were conspicuous in all the prominent features of his administration. And, whatever variety of sen∣timent, excited by circumstance, or produced by time, may have transiently prevailed in the breasts of his fellow-citizens, and diffused a foreign tinge over the face of society, the opinion was never uttered, nor <HI>con∣ceived,</HI> which dared to impeach the invulnerable puri∣ty of his intentions.</P>
<P>Though continually "admonished by the increas∣ing weight of years, that the calm of retirement was as necessary for him, as it would be welcome," yet he continues with unabated vigilance, and unwearied labor at his arduous post, until the improved state of things made his duty compatible with his repose. A∣gain we see him seek the solitude on which his heart was unalterably set. After communicating to you the maxims of sound policy and the instructions of good advice, which were the result of long experience and mature research; and after expressing the grate∣ful sense which he entertained of his country's love, and calling down upon her bosom the blessings of the ETERNAL, he divests himself of his high authority; and bowing under the vast burden of his honors, re∣tires beneath the shades of Vernon—and soon finish∣ing
<PB N="19" REF="037709_0018_100EF1C8E5D8FED0"/>
his earthly course, arises to receive his heavenly crown.</P>
<P>But he has departed <HI>in a good old age, full of days, riches and honor.</HI> The annals of nations are not adorned with so illustrious and finished a character. We see and admire particular traits of excellence, in men of renown, who flourished in the days of former times. But, which of them exhibits such a consistent and harmonious whole, as is here presented to our contemplation? To the splendid round of official duties and civic virtues, which displayed themselves, without effort, and without ostentation, in the beau∣tiful tenor of his life, he added as the crown of all, a regular and exemplary respect to the GOSPEL of JE∣SUS; a uniform and sincere piety to GOD. Religion was the star of superior radiance, which reflected a celestial and inextinguishable lustre through the con∣stellation of all his virtues. On every proper occasion, he acknowledges an overruling Providence, and as∣cribes to its guidance and defence, the success of his efforts and the independence of his country.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See his farewell orders to the Army.</NOTE> In his circular letters to the particular States, he speaks in the highest terms of eulogy respecting the word of revelation, and in the highest expressions of honor, respecting the Divine Redeemer. He knew that his talents and exaltation came from God, and he was
<PB N="20" REF="037709_0019_100EF1CA8C3B6C88"/>
not ashamed to acknowledge before the world, the author of his benefactions. Hear him again, in his parting address, dictated by the warmest affection for his people, earnestly inculcate, with all the fervor and authority of parental concern, the necessity of morality and religion to the prosperity of nations, and the necessity of religion to the existence of morality. He knew, from long experience, that their influence upon the soul was a feast of delight. In the midst of his most urgent employments, even during the tu∣mults of war, you behold him consciencious and reg∣ular in devoting a certain portion of every day to re∣tirement. This uniform retreat, we have reason to believe was sacred to meditation and to God. The unhallowed foot of officious presumption, was forbid∣den to intrude; and the sweet insinuations of friend∣ship were never suffered to steal upon those hours, consecrate to heaven. He stands a monument for the admiration of the world, for the instruction of fu∣ture ages, for an example to heroes, legislators and kings.</P>
<P>I speak not of those wise political maxims, those rules calculated to make a nation great and happy, which lie scattered through his writings, but are more particularly bequeathed to us in his valedictory ad∣dress. I need not repeat his animated exhortations to the observance of justice, to the love of liberty, to
<PB N="21" REF="037709_0020_100EF1CD12492318"/>
the extension of literature, to the exercise of fraternal affection, to the cultivation of the principles of our union. I need not mention his excellent advice, to guard against the poison of party asperity; the strat∣agems of ever-working, ever lying faction; the dan∣ger from cumbrous, unnecessary, overgrown military establishments; the contagion of foreign influence, and the enchantment of intimate foreign connexion: for he, <HI>though dead, yet speaketh,</HI> and his warning voice is heard in deep toned majesty from the tomb.</P>
<P>Fellow Citizens, he loved you to the last. He bore your interests on his heart, when he encountered the hostility of peril. The welfare of his country, was the theme of his prayers, whenever he bowed in the presence of his God. The recollection of her tri∣umphs, and the prospect of her happiness, smoothed the path of his age, and gilded the gloom of his de∣parting hour.</P>
<P>Illustrious shade, farewell! first of men, thy name is immortal. Father, Deliverer, Friend—the aged patriot mourns thy loss! The valiant youth, erewhile animated by thy virtues, looks with speechless agony upon thy grave, and clasps his hands in the extacy of grief. Thy bereaved country, in vain stretches forth her arms, to give thee a last embrace—Borne down by sorrow, she rests against the tomb, which preserves the
<PB N="22" REF="037709_0021_100EF1CF3A032688"/>
ashes of her departed chieftain. Father, Hero, Friend, once more farewell! Time, who shall crumble into dust, the monumental marble, which deathless grati∣tude consecrates to thy memory, shall continue to brighten the splendors of thy fame; and WASHING∣TON SHALL LIVE FOR EVER—in the HEARTS OF HIS COUNTRYMEN, and in the BOSOM OF HIS GOD.</P>
