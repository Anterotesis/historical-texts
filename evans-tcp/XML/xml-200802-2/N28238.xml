<BIBL>ISAIAH iii. 1, 2, 3.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>BEHOLD! the LORD, the LORD of hosts, doth take away the mighty man, and the man of war</HI>—<HI>the prudent, and the ancient</HI>—<HI>the honourable man, and the coun∣sellor.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>UNHAPPY the nation, destined to experi∣ence so great a calamity! Unhappy our na∣tion; for such, alas, is its own destiny! The characters, drawn by the prophet, if distributed a∣mong many members of a community, constitute its glory and defence: but if, what rarely occurs, they are concentrated in ONE MAN, who can estimate his importance? By his might, by his military skill and bravery, by his prudence, by his age and experience, by the weight of his character, and by his counsels; his influence toward the security and happiness of a nation is incalculable. To be deprived, then, of such a man—how great the judgment! how affecting the calamity!</P>
<P>No event, less melancholy than this, could have caused the solemn stillness, and the sorrowful aspect, of this assembly. Yes: <HI>This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears:—for, behold!</HI> in the removal of
<PB N="6" REF="037641_0004_100F29ABF9C3C3F8"/>
WASHINGTON, <HI>the</HI> LORD, <HI>the</HI> LORD <HI>of hosts, doth take away the mighty man, and the man of war—the prudent, and the ancient—the honourable man, and the counsellor.</HI></P>
<P>Will it be superfluous, on this affecting occasion, to exhibit the union of all these characters in the great and beloved Man, whose loss we are now call∣ed to deplore? New information, indeed, cannot be given you concerning him; for not a few of you have personally witnessed his talents and his virtues; and those, whose years admit not this testimony, have been taught from the cradle to lisp his name, and to revere his character. Nor can the panegyric of the Preacher add aught to his transcendent fame. A summary review of his character, however, and of the services which he has rendered to his country, is what Gratitude demands; and it may be happily conducive to our moral and religious improvement.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON was <HI>the mighty man.</HI> Lofty in sta∣ture, robust and vigorous in constitution, he was formed for active enterprises, and heroic achieve∣ments. At the present day, indeed, corporeal strength and agility are far less material to the warrior, than they were in ancient times, when the battle was fought in personal combats, and when the chief wea∣pons in use were the javelin and the spear. They have always, however, their importance; nor, with∣out them, could the American Hero have been uni∣formly energetic for action, or have sustained the complicated cares, and oppressive fatigues, of the camp.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="037641_0005_100F29AD8F81AE48"/>
He, too, was <HI>the man of war.</HI> Endowed, by na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re, with singular capacities for the formation of a mili∣tary character, he became, by the aids of art and experience, a warrior of the first distinction. At the early age of twenty two years, he so highly signalized himself,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At Fort du Quesne, in 1754; and at Braddock's defeat, 1755.</NOTE> at a very critical juncture, for his military skill and bravery, as to excite great expectations of his future eminence; and it was, even then, pre∣dicted,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">By the Rev. Mr. <HI>Davies,</HI> then in Virginia, afterwards Presi∣dent of Princeton College.</NOTE> that he was raised up to be the Saviour of his country. At length, the important crisis arriv∣ed, when the prediction received its accomplishment. When, in the contest with the Parent State, it be∣came necessary to <HI>resist unto blood;</HI> an army of citizen soldiers spontaneously sprung into existence, and rush∣ed into the field, in defence of their invaded liber∣ties. Collected, however, from the various colonies; diverse in their habits and manners; unaccustomed to discipline; unskilled in war; and unsupplied with arms and ammunition; they composed a body, which seemed to promise nothing more propitious than early disquietude, obstinate insubordination, fre∣quent desertion, and speedy dissolution. At this in∣teresting and hazardous moment, the eyes of the people were directed to GEORGE WASHINGTON, at Mount Vernon, in the distant colony of Virginia. No sooner did he receive a commission from the American Congress, to take the command of the ar∣my,
<PB N="8" REF="037641_0006_100F29AFA73523D0"/>
my than he exchanged his tranquil home for <HI>the con∣fused noise of the warrior,</HI> and for the perils and hard∣ships of the camp. Though he accepted his commis∣sion with unaffected diffidence, he commenced its ex∣ecution with the steady zeal of enlightened patriot∣ism. Believing the American cause to be just, he relied on the concurrent support of his fellow-citi∣zens, and committed himself to the auspicious gui∣dance and benediction of ALMIGHTY GOD. From <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> very temple, we can behold the spot of the first <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>mpment, to which he repaired to execute "the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> behest" with which he was entrusted.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was unanimously elected commander in chief of the American forces, by Congress, June 16, 1775; and arrived at Cambridge, and took command of the army July 2, following.</NOTE> And how did he execute it? With what diligence and success did he organize the heterogeneous troops? How soon did he acquire the unlimited confidence of the army; and, by a fascinating influence, estab∣lish subordination; inspire a spirit of patriotism; and so firmly attach the soldiers to their General, and to the cause of their country, as to render them determined to conquer, or to die?</P>
<P>To trace the series of events, during a war of seven years, and to point out the influence of this great Commander, in giving, under Providence, a propitious course to those events, and in bringing the war to a happy conclusion, would swell a Dis∣course into a Volume. Let the Historian record those events, and point out that influence. Let the Poet make them the theme of his heroic verse. Let

the marble monument preserve them in legible char∣acters, for the perusal of distant posterity. We need only say, That the events of this revolutionary war astonished Europe, astonished the world: That, un∣der the auspices of WASHINGTON, the ablest generals of Britain were baffled, and her veteran troops re∣pelled: That, in addition to repeated victories, two of her armies, with her most experienced command∣ers at their head, were made prisoners of war: That her Parliament was constrained to acknowledge the Independence of America: and, That, by the Treaty of Peace, which terminated the contest, the liberties of our Nation were placed on the most respectable and permanent basis.</P>
<P>In WASHINGTON, then, we behold <HI>the man of war:</HI> not an Alexander,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The British Poets have delighted in celebrating the praises of WASHINGTON. The following compliment to him is as just, as it is elegant:
<Q><L>—"not such</L>
<L>As rise in causeless war, troubling the world</L>
<L>By their mad quarrel, and in fields of blood</L>
<L>Hail'd victors, thence renown'd, and call'd on earth</L>
<L>Kings, heroes, demi-gods, but in high Heaven</L>
<L>Thieves, ruffians, murderers; these find no repose:</L>
<L>Thee rather, patriot Conqueror! to thee</L>
<L>Belongs such rest; who in the Western world,</L>
<L>Thine own deliver'd country, for thyself</L>
<L>Hast planted an immortal grove, and there</L>
<L>Upon the glorious mount of Liberty</L>
<L>Reposing, sit'st beneath the palmy shade."</L>

defend the Capitol, and to save his own nation from servitude: not a Cesar, plotting to establish his own power on the ruins of the Republic; but a Cato, ready to devote his fortune and his life to the salva∣tion of his country: not a Sylla, terminating his military career by the usurpation of the civil author∣ity; but a Cincinnatus, voluntarily relinquishing the sword for the plough, and retiring from the camp to the farm: not, in fine, a mere warrior, but a Man, blending the feelings of the citizen with those of the soldier, and tempering the ambition of the conqueror with the humility of the Christian.</P>
<P>Uniting quick perception with deep discernment, he formed and executed his own schemes with pro∣found judgment; while, with wonderful facility, he penetrated and defeated those of his enemy. Fertile in resources, he was never at a loss for an expedient, in cases the most critical, in junctures the most haz∣ardous. He was deliberate, without perplexity; calm, without apathy; animated, without enthusi∣asm; decisive, without pertinacity; and bold, with∣out temerity. Dignified in his person, he command∣ed respect; amiable in his manners, he conciliated affection; successful in his enterprises, he inspired confidence. In camp, he maintained economy, with∣out parsimony; order, without restraint; and disci∣pline, without severity. In action, he was ardent, yet collected; intrepid, yet cautious; confident, yet unpresuming.—By so rare an assemblage of talents and virtues, he was admirably formed for the com∣mand
<PB N="11" REF="037641_0009_100F29B65FB4AB30"/>
of armies; and the series of his successes, dur∣ing a long and unequal contest, with the final tri∣umph of the American arms, demonstrates, that, as <HI>the man of war,</HI> he is entitled to primary distinction in the annals of military fame.</P>
<P>He, also, combined in his character, the <HI>prudent, and the ancient.</HI> All his measures were the result of serious thought, and deep reflection. Every avenue to danger seemed disclosed to his piercing eye; and no one of those avenues was left unguarded.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Washington's Letters.</NOTE> Vigi∣lantly attentive to seize an advantage, or to ward off an evil, he seasonably secured every attainable benefit, and cautiously guarded against the surprise of his enemy. Though never reluctant, when justified by the occasion, to jeopard his own life and the lives of his brave soldiers, on the high places of the field; yet, as became a prudent general, he studiously shun∣ned unnecessary danger, and was more anxious for the safety of his country, than ambitious for the hon∣our of a victory. Like the Roman Fabius, he chose rather to exhaust the enemy, by studied delays, than to put the liberties of a whole nation to the hazard of a single battle. In the peculiar situation of our infant country, the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of WASHINGTON was <HI>bet∣ter than weapons of war.</HI></P>
<P>When called to a political station, he discovered the same prudence in the cabinet, for which he had signalized himself in the field. Justly appreciating those invaluable blessings, which had been earned with blood, he watched over them with paternal vigilance,
<PB N="12" REF="037641_0010_100F29B88745E870"/>
and adopted the wisest methods to insure their per∣petuity. What ruler could have more prudently ex∣erted his authority to prevent the evils of foreign influence, and of domestic faction; and to maintain inviolably the Peace and Independence of America?</P>
<P>Both in the civil and military departments, he de∣rived great advantages from age and experience; for he was <HI>the ancient.</HI> Employed for nearly fifty years<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To the years of public service, mentioned in his Valedictory Address, it is incumbent on us to annex that portion of time, which, in the very evening of his days, he magnanimously held pledged to the call of his country. Having been appointed, by the PRESIDENT, "Lieutenant General and Commander in Chief of all the armies raised or to be raised for the service of the United States;" he accepted the appointment July 13, 1798, and retain∣ed his commission till his death.</NOTE> in public offices; possessing, at the same time, a capacious mind; and habituated to an attentive ob∣servation of men and things, of causes and effects; great were his improvements in useful knowledge, and eminent his qualifications for <HI>guiding the affairs</HI> of our infant Republic <HI>with discretion.</HI></P>
<P>He was, also, <HI>the honourable man.</HI> If the union of distinguished personal virtues with great military and political talents, and a long series of patriotic services, entitle a man to honour; let honour be affixed to the name of WASHINGTON. Habituated to the gov∣ernment of his appetites, he was exemplary for his temperance; and equally habituated to the govern∣ment of his passions, he set a noble example of equa∣nimity. Accustomed to order and method, he did
<PB N="13" REF="037641_0011_100F29BA179AB980"/>
every thing by rule, without the pedantry of exact∣ness; and, by his nice arrangements and precision, he found time for the accomplishment of every in∣teresting purpose, however complex in its nature, however laborious in its execution. He united be∣nevolence with justice, and piety with morality.—Unlike the impious philosophists of the present day, he aimed not to separate the duties which man owes to GOD, from those which he owes to Society. He was not too wise, to be above the instructions of di∣vine wisdom; nor too unconscious of guilt, to des∣pise the redemption of the cross. He received the Holy Scriptures as the oracles of God; and treated with reverence the institutions of JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>But who will attempt a complete delineation of his many virtues? Like stars, composing a fair con∣stellation, they reflected a mild and steady radiance, on which the eye delighted to dwell, and from which its steadfast gaze could not, without regret, be averted.</P>
<P>Whatever were his virtues, whatever were his tal∣ents, they were consecrated to God, and to his coun∣try. His patriotism was too disinterested, to admit impeachment, or suspicion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is well known, that he refused to receive any pecuniary compensation for his public services.</NOTE> In relinquishing his calm and favourite abode, for the tempestuous sea of public life, he uniformly sacrificed his personal ease and interest, comfort and tranquillity. What more was needful to give him the fairest claim to the title of <HI>the honourable man?</HI>—Nor were his fellow-citizens
<PB N="14" REF="037641_0012_100F29BD9AF31028"/>
insensible to his claims on their gratitude and praise. He was THE MAN <HI>whom</HI> they <HI>delighted to honour.</HI>—Greater proofs, than those which they gave, of their just estimation of his merits and services, could not have been exhibited. The deep and affecting in∣terest, taken by all classes of citizens in the melan∣choly tidings of his death, does infinitely more hon∣our to his name than the storied urn, or the mon∣umental marble.—"Illustrious Man! deriving hon∣our less from the splendor of his situation, than from the dignity of his mind; before whom all borrowed greatness sinks into insignificance." So said an illus∣trious Member of the British House of Commons,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charles J. Fox.</NOTE> when speaking of our great and beloved WASHING∣TON. Yes: His praises have resounded through the empire of Britain; they have been echoed through the world.</P>
<P>It need only be added, that he was <HI>the counsellor.</HI> In critical emergencies, he was often called to assist his fellow-countrymen with his counsels, as well as by his arms. What reliance was placed on his judg∣ment appears from the uniform deference paid to it, both in the cabinet and in the field. During the re∣volutionary war, how greatly were the measures of the American Congress influenced by his seasonable advices! When that war was closed, and it became expedient to devise a new and improved form of government for the United States; we behold him placed in the presidential Chair of the National Con∣vention,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In 1787.</NOTE> and essentially aiding, by his advice and in∣fluence,
<PB N="15" REF="037641_0013_100F29C05E230EB0"/>
the formation of that admirable Constitution, which is the grand palladium of our liberty.</P>
<P>Here, again, his counsels and authority were deem∣ed essential to the union, to the interests and happi∣ness, of America. By the unanimous suffrages of the people, he was invited to take a part in the ad∣ministration of that government, which he had assist∣ed to form; and solicited to accept the Presidency of the United States. With his usual diffidence he ac∣cepted the important trust. Twice four years did he continue to act in the Presidential office.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">He was elected President in 1789; re-elected in 1793; and left the Presidency in 1797.</NOTE> How much, in that interesting period, he contributed, by his judicious and enlightened Administration, to the peace, to the prosperity, to the glory, of our Nation, the public Records will shew, and a grateful People will carefully transmit to generations yet unborn.</P>
<P>While his fellow-citizens could perceive no dimi∣nution of his corporeal or mental energies, the "in∣creasing weight of years admonishing him to retire," and his love of rural and domestic retirement, height∣ened by the contrasted cares of public life, alluring him back to the shades of Mount Vernon; he de∣clined to be considered as a candidate for the future suffrages of his countrymen. But he resigns not his charge, before he has given the American People his last and best advice. Here <HI>the Counsellor</HI> appears in his greatest glory. The <HI>Address,</HI> which he delivered on this occasion, contains the result of much observa∣tion,
<PB N="16" REF="037641_0014_100F29C1EC74B8D8"/>
and deep experience; and admirably points out the true interests of United America. It is the Ad∣dress of a father to his children, while deeply im∣pressed with an apprehension of their dangers; and tenderly solicitous to guide them to security and hap∣piness.</P>
<P>America was loud in the applauses of his Adminis∣tration. His own remarks, on a retrospective view of it, are worthy of a mind superior to the inflations of vanity; and they furnish a model of humility and philanthropy, which it would be the glory of kings to resemble: "Though in reviewing the incidents of my administration I am unconscious of intentional error; I am, nevertheless, too sensible of my defects, not to think it probable, that I have committed ma∣ny errors. Whatever they may be, I fervently be∣seech the Almighty to avert or mitigate the evils to which they may tend. I shall also carry with me the hope that my country will never cease to view them with indulgence; and that, after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service, with an up∣right zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be consigned to oblivion, as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest."</P>
<P>Words, alas, too prophetic! To those mansions, revered and beloved Man! art thou already consign∣ed: <HI>For, behold! the Lord, the Lord of hosts, doth take away the mighty man, and the man of war—the prudent, and the ancient—the honourable man, and the counsellor▪</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="037641_0015_100F29C45D94E040"/>
WASHINGTON is no more!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On Friday night, December 13, he was seized with an in∣flammatory sore throat, <HI>[Cynache Trachealis]</HI> which terminated his life at half after eleven on Saturday night, after an illness of about twenty-four hours. He retained, to the last, a full posses∣sion of his reason, and expressed an entire resignation to the event, which, from the very commencement of the disorder, he fully ex∣pected. "He closed his mouth and eyes with his own hands, and expired without a sigh or a groan." "During the short period of his illness, he economized his time in the arrangement of such few concerns, as required his attention, with the utmost serenity; and anticipated his approaching dissolution with every demonstration of that equanimity, for which his whole life was uniformly and singularly conspicuous."—He was born in West-moreland county, in Virginia, February 22, 1732, and died De∣cember 14, 1799, AEtat. LXVIII.</NOTE> We are reminded, by the prophet, of the divine AGENT, by whom his removal is effected. It is JEHOVAH. <HI>The great, the mighty GOD, the Lord of hosts is his name. He doth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What dost thou. He changeth the countenance of the</HI> MAN GREATLY BELOVED, <HI>and sendeth him away.</HI> Strength and agility, military skill and fortitude, pru∣dence and penetration, avail him nothing. <HI>There is no wisdom, nor understanding, nor counsel, against the</HI> LORD. To his control the most potent and formidable com∣manders of armies are equally subjected with the com∣mon soldiery under their command. His orders are absolute, and must be instantly and universally obey∣ed: for <HI>there is no discharge in that war.—What man is he that liveth</HI>—whatever are his talents and his vir∣tues, however he is endeared to Society, and how∣ever
<PB N="18" REF="037641_0016_100F29C737ED90E0"/>
ever important his life and services to the world—<HI>what man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave?</HI> No: let no man expect it; for WASHINGTON is dead.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON is dead! Here, then, let us unite in paying that tribute to his memory, which his eminent talents, virtues, and services, demand. <HI>Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man sallen, this day, in Israel?</HI> Yes: These sable hang∣ings, that awful silence, those tributary tears, testify that ye know too well the sad event, which has over∣whelmed our nation with unutterable sorrows. Well may ye, who have witnessed the military skill, the patriotism, and the many virtues, of WASHINGTON, during his residence in this very place, unite, this day, to lament his fall. Well may ye, who once worshipped with him in this house of prayer, pour forth your tears at the recollection of that exemplary piety, which shone conspicuously amidst the confu∣sions of war, and the vices of the camp. Well may this Temple, which has often witnessed the sincerity and the solemnity of his devotions, appear clothed in sackcloth. What object around us can forbear to assume a sober sadness, and to participate in the uni∣versal gloom? Ye circumjacent hills, that witnessed the mighty operations of this great Commander, whose summits still shew the vestiges of war, and whose soil has been wet with the blood of our citi∣zens! <HI>let there be no dew, neither let there be rain upon you.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="037641_0017_100F29C8CD0586D0"/>
Where, now, are those veteran Generals, who, on yonder heights, accompanied <HI>the man of war,</HI> and aided him in the glorious contest? Come, mingle your tears with our's. Alas! Ye yourselves have departed. <HI>The Lord of hosts</HI> hath taken you away; and we have already wept over you. But do none of these mighty men, these hoary chiefs survive? Yes: LINCOLN, with a little band, remains. Brave and patriotic man! come, grey with years and with the toils of war, covered as thou art with wounds, and lead the funereal procession to the tomb of WASHINGTON. Ye war-worn Soldiers, who once fought under his banners! come, join the solemn train, and pay the last military honours to the mem∣ory of your much loved General. Ye venerable Sages! who co-operated in council, with his exer∣tions in the field, for the establishment of our Inde∣pendence, come—Alas! ye too are gone. Illustri∣ous ADAMS! thou livest—livest to weep over the remains of thy beloved Co-patriot, who was <HI>very pleasant unto thee.</HI> Come, then, venerable Sire, and bring with thee the few remaining Fathers of our country, to pay this last sad tribute.—Ye Daughters of America! come, <HI>weep over</HI> WASHINGTON, <HI>who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on or∣naments of gold upon your apparel.—How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!</HI></P>
<P>But let not the deluge of our grief obliterate our gratitude to GOD, for raising up such a Man to be the Saviour of his country. <HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>of hosts,</HI> who
<PB N="20" REF="037641_0018_100F29CAE894FE08"/>
hath now taken him away, originally formed him for the high purpose of our national salvation. He endowed him with those great talents, which quali∣fied him to command in our armies, and to preside in our councils, with such wisdom and skill, and with such admirable success. <HI>The inspiration of the Almighty gave him understanding. The</HI> LORD <HI>of hosts</HI> himself <HI>taught his hands to war, and his fingers to fight. If it had not been the</HI> LORD <HI>who was on our side,</HI> vain had been his wisdom, and impotent his strength, <HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>of hosts was with him;</HI> therefore he was <HI>valiant in fight,</HI> prudent in council, and successful in the defence of our liberties. With our tears, there∣fore, let us intermingle our grateful acknowledg∣ments to Almighty GOD, for so rich and invaluable a blessing. Let us praise his holy name, for protract∣ing the life of this great and good Man, till our na∣tional Liberty was completely vindicated, and our Peace and Independence effectually established. <HI>Now, Lord, lettest thou thy servant depart in peace; for his eyes have seen</HI> the <HI>salvation</HI> of his country.</P>
<P>Humble, however, it becomes us to be, under the chastisement of Heaven. <HI>The stay and the staff,</HI> the pride and the glory, of our Nation are removed.—<HI>My father! my father! the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof!</HI> In the death of One, whose life was so interesting to America, and to the world, and whose fame resounded through both hemispheres, we see the insignificancy of human power, and the vani∣ty of earthly greatness. <HI>The Lord of hosts hath pur∣posed
<PB N="21" REF="037641_0019_100F29CCDB14E068"/>
it to stain the pride of all glory.</HI> Let us <HI>hear the rod,</HI> and Him <HI>who hath appointed it.</HI> How strikingly are we here admonished to <HI>put not</HI> our <HI>trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom is no help! for his breath goeth forth, he returneth to the earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.</HI> Such is the monitory use, which the prophet himself makes of the melancholy truth, this day illustrated: <HI>Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils; for wherein is he to be accounted of? For, behold! the Lord, the Lord of hosts doth take away the mighty man, and the man of war—the prudent, and the ancient—the honourable man, and the counsellor.</HI></P>
<P>Transferring, then, our confidence from mortal man to the living GOD, who is <HI>the same yesterday, to∣day, and forever,</HI> let us seek from Him that aid, which He only can furnish; and that solace, which He only can bestow. GOD <HI>is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.</HI> Guided by his counsel, and protected by his power, we shall still dwell in perfect safety. <HI>With Him is wisdom and strength, He hath coun∣sel and understanding.</HI> He can always furnish the in∣struments, and prosper the means, of our national de∣fence and happiness. <HI>Sanctify,</HI> therefore, <HI>the</HI> LORD <HI>of hosts himself, and let Him be your fear, and let Him be your dread.—Trust in Him, at all times, ye people, pour out your hearts before Him.</HI></P>
<P>But, with your pious confidence in GOD, neglect not the means of security and prosperity. <HI>Only fear the Lord, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for consider how great things he hath done for you.</HI> Practise

<HI>righteousness,</HI> which <HI>exalteth a nation.</HI> Follow the coun∣sels, and obey the laws, of the excellent rulers, who <HI>proceed from ourselves,</HI> and who are the constituted <HI>min∣isters of God</HI> to us <HI>for good.</HI> Under a mild and equita∣ble administration of government, <HI>lead quiet and peace∣able lives, in all godliness and honesty.</HI>—But why does the Preacher offer his humble advice? The <HI>prudent</HI> Man, <HI>the ancient, and the counsellor,</HI> hath pointed us the way to national happiness. Would we, at once, en∣sure our highest prosperity, and pay the most hon∣ourable tribute to the memory of our revered and beloved WASHINGTON; let us follow his parting ad∣vice. He designed, that, <HI>after his decease,</HI> we <HI>might be able to have it always in remembrance.</HI> His VALEDICTO∣RY ADDRESS, then, let every one study; its principles let every one adopt; its counsels let every one re∣gard; and we shall yet be a happy people, <HI>saved of the Lord,</HI> and <HI>made high among the nations in praise, and in name, and in honour.—Hear this, ye old men! and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land! Tell ye your children of it, and let your children tell their children, and their chil∣dren another generation.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A Hymn, Composed and sung at CAMBRIDGE, on the occasion of the death of General WASHINGTON.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>GREAT GOD <HI>of hosts!</HI> we own thy sway,</L>
<L>Nor dare thy will explore;</L>
<L>But, when thy judgments we survey,</L>
<L>We tremble and adore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thy potent hand hath far remov'd</L>
<L>The Man of war, and might:</L>
<L>The Prudent, Ancient, and Belov'd,</L>
<L>Sinks to the shades of night.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To Thee we lift our sorrowing eyes,</L>
<L>To Thee for aid repair:</L>
<L>Have pity on a Nation's sighs,</L>
<L>And listen to its prayer.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O GOD <HI>of hosts!</HI> while we bemoan</L>
<L>The Great, the Good, the Brave;</L>
<L>Look down from thy celestial throne,</L>
<L>To solace, and to save.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Be Thou our GOD, and Guardian still;</L>
<L>For us thy power display;</L>
<L>Thy vast designs begun fulfil,</L>
<L>And wipe our tears away.</L>
