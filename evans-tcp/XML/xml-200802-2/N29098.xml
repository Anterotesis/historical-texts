<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen of the Senate, and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN compliance with the request in one of the reso∣lutions of Congress, of the 21st of December last, I transmitted a copy of those resolutions by my Secretary, Mr. Shaw, to Mrs. Washington, assuring her of the profound respect Congress will ever bear to her per∣son and character—of their condolence in the late af∣flicting dispensation of Providence, and entreating her assent to the interment of the remains of General GEORGE WASHINGTON, in the manner expressed in the first resolution. As the sentiments of that virtuous lady, not less beloved by this nation than she is at pre∣sent greatly afflicted, can never be so well expressed as in her own words, I transmit to Congress her origi∣nal letter.</P>
<P>It would be an attempt of too much delicacy, to make any comments upon it; but, there can be no doubt, that the nation at large, as well as all the branches of the government, will be highly gratified by any ar∣rangement which may diminish the sacrifice she makes of her individual feelings.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHILE I feel with keenest anguish the late dis∣pensation of Divine Providence, I cannot be insensible to the mournful tributes of respect and veneration, which are paid to the memory of my dear deceased husband; and, as his best services, and most anxious wishes were always devoted to the welfare and happi∣ness of his country, to know that they were truly ap∣preciated and gratefully remembered, affords no incon∣siderable consolation.</P>
<P>Taught by the great example which I have so long had before me, never to oppose my private wishes to the public will, I must consent to the request made by Congress, which you have had the goodness to trans∣mit to me; and, in doing this I need not, I cannot say, what a sacrifice of individual feeling I make to a sense of public duty.</P>
<P>With grateful acknowledgments, and unfeigned thanks for the personal respect, and evidences of con∣dolence expressed by Congress, and yourself,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>I remain very respectfully, Sir, Your most obedient humble servant, MARTHA WASHINGTON.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
