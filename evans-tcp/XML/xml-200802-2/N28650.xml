<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>JOB xxx.23.</BIBL>
<P>FOR I KNOW THAT THOU WILT BRING ME TO DEATH, AND TO THE HOUSE APPOINTED FOR ALL LIVING.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WITH the time, or circumstances of our removal from life, we are not acquainted; but of the ultimate certainty of the event, there is no ground to doubt.</P>
<P>PERSONS may conjecture that they shall not out∣live a particular season; or that they shall die by a particular disorder, or calamity: and yet be sup∣ported through that season, and saved from the evil they apprehended.—On the other hand to presume on a course of years, imagining that we are exempt from disease, or casualties, would not only be a sin, but might prove an experimental mistake. By causes not foreseen, or which were not considered dangerous, we might be aroused from security, and brought to the grave.</P>
<P>THE hour of death, like the coming of the Son of man to judgment, is known to no one; but of the certainty of death there is the fullest evidence from the experience of man in all ages, and the general state of nature: from the indications of frailty in
<PB N="6" REF="038196_0004_101141BCCD6AC8B0"/>
our own constitution, and the testimony of the word of GOD.</P>
<P>THE grave is represented as <HI>the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> appointed for</HI> ALL <HI>living.</HI> The characters and conditions of mankind are exceedingly diversified in a number of respects; but whatever distinctions may subsist between them, they are all alike in this, that they must die, and make their bed in the dust. Here <HI>the rich and poor meet together,</HI> and the <HI>servant is free from his master.</HI> In this place all distinctions are obliterated, all relations dissolved, all acquisi∣tions relinquished: <HI>Naked came</HI> we from the earth, <HI>and naked</HI> do we <HI>return thither,</HI> Job i.21. <HI>All go to one place: All are of the dust, and all return to dust again,</HI> Eccles. iii.20.</P>
<P>IT is said, "<HI>I know, that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house</HI> APPOINTED <HI>for all living;</HI> implying that it is the certain, unchanging purpose of GOD, that all shall die. Death is not an occa∣sional event; but is pre-determined in the plan of divine providence, is the fixed ordination of Heaven. In conformity with this, no provision is made in nature, by which any one can possibly avoid the change. Frequently when a person lies in death, we behold an example of the inefficacy of all created expedients to preserve life. None of the productions of the fields could afford nourishment: and the powers of medicine, aided by the most dis∣cerning skill, and sympathetic kindness, could not relieve and heal; but the appointment of GOD was carried, without interruption, into full effect.</P>
<P>THIS passage of scripture leads us to consider, not only the <HI>certainty</HI> and <HI>universality</HI> of death, but that
<PB N="7" REF="038196_0005_101141BFCF095D80"/>
it is a dispensation of the divine hand, <HI>I know that</HI> THOU <HI>wilt bring me to death.</HI>—</P>
<P>GOD, though infinitely exalted and blessed, re∣gards the state of the children of men. He appoint∣ed the general frailty of their nature, and determines the order, and manner in which it shall be executed, exercising over each one a providential care. <HI>It is not in man, who walketh, to direct his steps; but in the hand of</HI> GOD <HI>are all his ways,</HI> Jer. x, 22. He observes our going out, and coming in: he is ac∣quainted with our state in prosperity and adversity; in sickness and health: in the various relations we sustain—and it is not without a due consideration of all connected circumstances, that any change is produced, and that death is experienced.</P>
<P>IF persons be brought to death, by the appoint∣ment and will of GOD, there is infinite wisdom in the dispensation. To consider any event as under his government; and yet opposed to infinite wisdom, is inconsistent. Though death in itself is evil and afflictive, and a reversion of the original order of nature; yet that it is subordinated to wise and holy purposes, is evident from the infinite perfection of Deity, and from the declared and known reasons of the appointment.</P>
<P>THE entrance of sin into the world rendered the sentence of death just.—Wisely to adapt the con∣dition of mankind to a season of trial, finally to be terminated, it was ordained that the system of crea∣tion should be frail, and with all other objects that human life should be transitory. If we be con∣vinced of the wisdom of GOD in determining that the heavens should wax old as a garment, and the foundations of the earth be removed, and that all
<PB N="8" REF="038196_0006_101141C26292D098"/>
the human race should die; then we may reconcile with wisdom his removing particular persons from life; for in these instances he gives an example of the general sentence, and carries it, as it respects the human race, into effect.</P>
<P>SHOULD it be objected, that the time and circum∣stances of a person's death appear, in some instances, to militate against divine wisdom in the production of it? To this it may be replied, that what is con∣sidered the weakness and frailty of man in old age, is nothing more than the appointment <HI>that he shall die,</HI> exhibited in example. There is no necessity, in the constitution of his nature, that he should be∣come feeble at threescore years and ten, or that he should be at all impaired by age, more than that the Sun, by continuing to shine, should finally lose his lustre. Indeed, but for experience, it would be thought more strange that the sun, a vast body of fire, should be kept burning for many thousand years, without the least apparent diminution, than that the human body should be sustained in vigor, forever.</P>
<P>IF it be owing solely to the decree of death, that man becomes feeble and helpless at a certain age, then it may consist with divine wisdom, that he should experience sickness and death in an earlier season. If the decree find man in vigor, though a thousand years old—interested in a variety of relations, en∣gaged in important labors, with scenes of enjoyment and hope around him, GOD alone can determine when that vigor shall abate, when those relations shall be dissolved, and those prospects closed. To plead the importance of relations and pursuits against the time of removal designated in Divine Providence, may ever delay the stroke of death, and is an implied claim to immortality on earth. If wisdom be ex∣pressed
<PB N="9" REF="038196_0007_101141C59873E340"/>
in the general sentence of death, it is doubt∣less expressed in the particular time and circum∣stances in which it is executed.</P>
<P>IT may further be observed, that if death be the appointment of GOD, it is subservient to infinite goodness.</P>
<P>THE goodness of GOD is as unquestionable as his wisdom, or power. In the permission of sin, and in all the evils which result from it, he was influ∣enced by benevolence as truly as in the creation of the world. Unless he were, there is a contrariety in his character; or he is less glorious and excellent in the government of creatures than in giving them existence.</P>
<P>IT is asserted in scripture, <HI>Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof,</HI> Eccles. vii.8.— Existence is good, or evil, chiefly in reference to its objects. If GOD do not exercise goodness in gov∣erning, he exercised none in creating. Unless it were his object that creatures should be subservient to wise and holy purposes, no advantages would re∣sult from their existence: for however curiously they might be formed, or liberally endowed, their end would be vain, and thus their organization and endowments would be useless.</P>
<P>THE object of GOD in governing is the highest general good. In pursuing this he indulges no re∣spect of persons; but is impartial, just and uncon∣trolable. The condition of no one on earth, nor of any creature in the universe is the same, as if his interest were alone consulted: as if it were the sole object of GOD to exalt him, and promote his ad∣vantage.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="038196_0008_101141C85AFED7C8"/>CREATURES are viewed by GOD not as separate individuals, but in a collective capacity, and are all subordinated to the greatest good. By this the ex∣perience of each one is determined, whether prosper∣ous, or adverse: whether life, or death.</P>
<P>TO choose the accomplishment of this object, and voluntarily to conform to it, is a universal duty, and in this consist the highest dignity, and the highest happiness of which a creature is capable. In the temper here defined a person will be willing to live, or die, as GOD shall determine: he will be happy in the blessings with which he is favored, and content to resign them when required in Divine Providence: he will acquiesce in the removal of his friends, in the calamities which befal the world, and in all the evils of which creatures are the subjects.</P>
<P>AS the general is superior to individual good, and is ever pursued by GOD, death in being inflict∣ed by him in subservience to this, is subservient to good, even the highest of which we can conceive.</P>
<P>HAVING attempted to illustrate the text, by con∣sidering the certainty and universality of death, and that it is a dispensation of infinite wisdom and bene∣volence, productive in every instance, of the greatest good, I would conclude my discourse with an</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<HEAD><HI>IMPROVEMENT</HI> of the subject.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. WE may infer, that we cannot place depend∣ance on life.</P>
<P>IT is not only certain that we <HI>shall be brought to</HI> DEATH, <HI>and to the house appointed for</HI> ALL <HI>living;</HI> but of the time, or manner of our removal, we are ignorant. These will be determined, not by our
<PB N="11" REF="038196_0009_101141CB5F21D558"/>
connections in this state; but by our relation to GOD and his government. We may be spared for years, or may soon be taken. It is our duty to con∣sider our frailty, and not depend on life; but be devoted to the divine will.</P>
<P N="2">2. WE may infer, that it is improper to place confidence in any of our acquaintance and friends.</P>
<P>INNUMERABLE are the testimonies given in Divine Providence, that the most intimate relations must be dissolved: that persons of skill and generosity, of eminence and great usefulness, must be removed. Of this we have witnessed a number of instances: but few have been so impressive as the one which lately took place among us; by which not only a family is overwhelmed in sorrow, but the town is sensible of a loss.</P>
<P>HE is justly to be regretted, as a man sustaining many important relations,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He left an affectionate wife and five children—was honorary Member of the Philadelphia and London Medical Societies, and President of the <HI>Cincinnati,</HI> of this State.</NOTE> and of a great, generous, humane spirit. He will be lamented as a husband, father, and benefactor: He will be regretted as at the head of a class of citizens, distinguished for their exer∣tions in the late revolutionary war, and on whom de∣pendence is placed in the future emergencies of the country, among whom he presided with affectionate solicitude and dignity. He will be deeply regretted, as eminent in the very useful and important profession in which he was extensively employed; and for which he was qualified, not only by the acuteness of his discernment and accuracy of his opinions—by his decision and judgment; but by a choice of the most instructive books, an extensive correspondence, and great experience.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="038196_0010_101141CE20291010"/>THE Ministers in general of the Town received his prompt, his vigilant, his patient attention, in the hour of affliction and disease, to themselves and fami∣lies, without any claim of compensation:—and this tribute is doubtless small, compared with the one due to his kindness and liberality in other instances.</P>
<P>SUCH was the general confidence in his skill, that some might think, under his care, they were in a peculiar degree secure from death. But this confi∣dence was vain—his own life he could not prolong: and in his removal in so early a part of existence we are taught <HI>his</HI> dependence, <HI>our</HI> dependence, and the dependence of all things on <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P N="3">3. FROM the subject we learn the nature of resig∣nation, and the reasonableness of the principle.</P>
<P>TRUE resignation is founded on a belief, not that man, from a necessity of nature, must die; but that this and every change is appointed, and carried into effect by GOD: in a belief, not that our particular wishes and interests are consulted; but that the highest good is promoted.—It implies sensibilities corresponding to the nature of events; but, both in what is pleasing and in what is afflictive, that we sub∣mit with chearfulness to the divine will.</P>
<P>ON this principle we may safely rest all the inte∣rests of existence, for it is the sum of all its duties, and the temper is a foundation for the highest joy, and for peace in every trial and adversity. In this temper we shall be supported in the experience of death our∣selves —supported in the loss of those much dearer than life. It will be the language of our hearts▪ <HI>It is the Lord,</HI> the infinitely wise and just and compas∣sionate GOD, <HI>let him do what seemeth him good.—The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away: blessed be the name of the Lord.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>A PRAYER,</HI> suited to the preceding SERMON. [PUBLISHED FROM RECOLLECTION.]</HEAD>
<P>O LORD, who art self-existent, and of whose <HI>years there shall be no end!</HI>—We adore thee as the Creator of all things, and as exercising dominion over the work of thine hands.—We bless thee as regarding every creature, and event; and as making thy glory, and the highest felicity of thy works, the object of thine administration.</P>
<P>ENABLE us, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> reverence, to submit to thy will —to those dispensations in which our expectations are disappointed, as well as to those in which they are accomplished. Impress us with a sense of our ignorance of events, necessary in a government in∣finitely wise and good: and of the guilt of censuring thy measures, and opposing THEE.</P>
<P>MAY we suitably consider, that we are <HI>Strangers and pilgrims on earth:</HI> that <HI>thou wilt bring</HI> us <HI>to death, and to the house appointed for all living:</HI> that <HI>man, at his best estate, is altogether vanity:</HI> that his <HI>days are an hand's breadth</HI>—his life, as a <HI>tale that is told.</HI></P>
<P>MAY we consider thy condescension, in regarding our state:—thy care and infinite compassion:—and trust thee in all seasons and circumstances:—and, though we <HI>walk through the valley of the shadow of death,</HI> may we <HI>fear no evil.</HI></P>
<P>FOR life, and all worldly blessings, we offer thee a tribute of gratitude. We praise thee for the richer blessings of the gospel: for the pardon of sin, for
<PB N="ii" REF="038196_0012_101141D2CAC39D80"/>
spiritual life, and support:—that submitting to thy will, and trusting in thy Son, we shall be subjects of thy love, shall be led from strength to strength, and admitted to never ending glory and happiness.</P>
<P>WE acknowledge, and bemoan that principle of depravity, which is productive of disorder and mise∣ry, and is displeasing in thy sight. May we be de∣livered from its influence; overcome the world and the powers of darkness, and be devoted sincerely and entirely to thy service—respecting all thy com∣mands, and taking thy promises as our heritage.</P>
<P>SANCTIFY to us the dispensations of thy Provi∣dence: particularly the afflictive event we have been called lately to experience, and at this time to con∣sider. May it be rendered conducive to an impres∣sion of the most important truths, and the exercise of the most essential virtues.</P>
<P>LOOK down in compassion on thine handmaiden, the bereaved <HI>Consort.</HI> Greatly hast thou afflicted her: her heart is broken with sorrow. Thou alone art able to bind it up, and give her peace. Teach her to observe thine hand in this chastisement: may she realize, <HI>tho' clouds and darkness are round about Thee,</HI> that <HI>justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne.</HI> May she trust in thee, and enjoy the light of thy countenance, and be blessed forever.</P>
<P>REGARD in mercy the bereaved children—pro∣vide for their wants. Reward into their bosoms the liberality of thy servant to others.—May they be trained to usefulness and honor, to virtue and piety. May they look to thee as their GOD and heavenly Father, and in the shadow of thy wings find a refuge from every evil.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="038196_0013_101141D6C6EBAAE0"/>SANCTIFY the bereavement to all the connections and acquaintance of thy servant. May not their estimate of earthly good, contradict the measures of thy Providence: May they, from a sense of the frailty of man, and the transitory nature of his connections here, be led to place their affections on things above, and consider the importance of thy friendship, which alone is without change.</P>
<P>MAY this loss be sanctified to the inhabitants of the town: and wilt thou, in mercy, raise up one, whose heart thou wilt endue with equal discretion and fortitude, and whose hand thou wilt guide with equal skill, in relieving the distresses of thy people.</P>
<P>LOOK in compassion on all who mourn. May they consider <HI>that thou dost not willingly afflict:</HI>— may they trust in thee, as the only source of consola∣tion and hope: and though <HI>no chastisement is, for the present joyous, but grievous; may it yield the peace∣able fruits of righteousness.</HI></P>
<P>SMILE upon thy Churches.—May not the gates of the grave, nor of hell prevail against them.—May all things be over-ruled for their advantage.—May they exhibit a bright example of every Christian grace, and be extended from the rising to the setting sun.</P>
<P>BLESS the nations of the earth.—May the dispen∣sations of thy Providence be connected with the in∣structions of thy word to all people, and be attended with thy gracious influence.—May the calamities which are experienced, and the punishments which are to be feared, be a means of awakening the chil∣dren of men to a sense of the evil of sin, and the ne∣cessity of obeying thy commands—and <HI>may thy name
<PB N="iv" REF="038196_0014_101141DA91F02DA8"/>
be hallowed:</HI> may <HI>thy kingdom come, and will be done, on earth, as it is in Heaven,</HI>—through Jesus Christ.— To the Father, the Son, and Holy Spirit, be ascribed all honor and praise,</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>II SAMUEL, iii.33.</BIBL>
<P>KNOW YE NOT THAT THERE IS A PRINCE, AND A GREAT MAN, FALLEN THIS DAY IN ISRAEL.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Nation of Israel was favoured with a succession of characters, eminent in wisdom, and in all those talents and virtues by which human nature is exalted and adorned.</P>
<P>MOSES was the first of Prophets and Legislators: Aaron the most venerable of Priests: Joshua the most intrepid, regular and successful of Generals: Samuel the most equitable of Judges: David the most paternal and pious of Kings, and Solomon the wisest of men.</P>
<P>THE characters which arose in that nation, will not only appear with lustre to the end of time; but are a model to which succeeding generations may be referred, for greatness in civil rule, in war, and in piety.</P>
<P>IN the reign of Saul, and part of the reign of David, there was a person of distinction, Abner, the son of Ner, Saul's Uncle. After Saul was invested with regal authority, he appointed Abner, Captain
<PB N="6" REF="038196_0018_101141E4A1F0D7C0"/>
of his host. His talents were tried in a variety of enterprizes, against Moab, against Ammon, against Edom, against Zohath, against the Philistines and against the Amalakites; and his spirit and good con∣duct justified the appointment; <HI>he was a valiant man,</HI> and there was <HI>none like</HI> him <HI>in all Israel.</HI></P>
<P>ON the death of Saul, though the right of govern∣ment belonged to David, but one tribe acknowledg∣ed him, that of Judah. Abner, from his reputation and great influence, was the most proper person to attempt the reconciliation of the other tribes: and having made a solemn league with David, he re∣ceived a commission and entered on the busi∣ness. —But before he had proceeded far on the journey, Joab, Captain of the host of David, sent for him in the name of the King, and as he returned met him, and taking him aside, treacherously slew him.</P>
<P>DAVID greatly lamented his death. He appoint∣ed an honorable burial, and followed the bier: and in the language of our text, addressed his Officers and the People, <HI>Know ye not that there is a Prince and a Great Man fallen this day in Israel?</HI></P>
<P>THIS country, like the ancient Jewish Nation, has been blessed with characters, eminent in civil and religious offices: distinguished as Statesmen and Divines; as Legislators, Philosophers, Judges, and Generals. It would be presumptuous as it were vain, to attempt to point them out, or exhibit the proofs of their talents, their virtues and usefulness.</P>
<P>OUR attention is, at this time, called to <HI>one,</HI> not only on account of his distinguished greatness and excellence; but the afflictive event of his death.—
<PB N="7" REF="038196_0019_101141E7D3343E98"/>
So publicly known, so illustrious, so beloved was <HI>Washington,</HI> that the pathetic exclamation must ex∣press the sentiments and feelings of every heart, <HI>Know ye not, that there is a Prince, and a Great Man, fallen this day in</HI> our <HI>Israel!</HI></P>
<P>JUSTLY to delineate his virtues and endowments, would be a difficult task in the calmest hours of re∣flection; but is much too critical to be executed un∣der the confused and tumultuous pressure of grief.— The rationality of our sorrows, and the duty of reli∣giously improving them, require that we pay a gene∣ral attention to his character.</P>
<P>HE may truly be stiled <HI>great,</HI> if abilities to dis∣charge the duties of the most important stations in society constitute greatness.</P>
<P>NOT to take a more distant retrospect—in the commencement of the revolutionary war he was appointed to the chief command of the armies of the country. Not long after, Congress, "maturely con∣sidering the crisis, and having perfect reliance in his wisdom, vigor and uprightness," invested him with extraordinary powers; which were renewed from time to time, so long as the exigency of affairs ren∣dered it necessary.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Journals of Congress, Dec. <HI>27, 1776;</HI> Nov. <HI>14,</HI> Dec. <HI>10, 1777,</HI> and April <HI>23, 1778.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>THE justice of this reliance, and the ability with which he executed the trust, are evident from the support and discipline of the army, and its various and important operations in the course of eight cam∣paigns: and from the issue of its successes, in the ac∣knowledgment of our Sovereignty and Independ∣ence, and the return of peace.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="038196_0020_101141EA956C4890"/>HIS greatness, as General, comprised courage and skill, moderation and enterprize, and resources of mind suited to seasons and circumstances. His courage was not less to be doubted, than his prudence was conspicuous. He hazarded no interests by rashness: he lost no advantages by delay. He was patient in trials, fortunate in decisions, had great self command —was great in his authority over others, and distin∣guished for disinterestedness and humanity.</P>
<P>BY his public communications and example, he relieved the country from many discouragements, and in seasons of embarrassment and danger was the greatest support of its hopes; and animated his fellow-citizens in arms, sharing their burdens, recon∣ciling their differences, directing their ardor to ob∣jects most useful to the Country and conducive to <HI>their</HI> honor, teaching them effectually to preserve the character of <HI>citizens</HI> in the armour of <HI>soldiers.</HI></P>
<P>IT was not the majesty of his appearance, the light∣ning of his eye, nor the high authority of his commis∣sion, that influenced the troops to endure hardships and meet the enemy with fortitude—it was a sense of the union of the most endearing virtues in his heart, with the most enlightened skill: a conviction that in their General they had a Father, who was soli∣citous to mitigate their distresses, and in toils and dangers would appear at their head; and that in the love of him they loved their Country—it was these sentiments and feelings, which rendered them pa∣tient in sufferings, and in the day of battle inspired them with such courage, that though their bodies might be cut down, their spirit could not be subdued.</P>
<P>HE was great, not only in the character of <HI>General</HI>; but, when the necessity of military labours was over, in retiring to the rank of a <HI>private citizen.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="038196_0021_101141ED58193468"/>WITH the highest objects of personal grandeur and authority that ever stimulated ambition, and with peculiar advantages to secure those objects, that like an affectionate, faithful son, he should bow to the au∣thority of his Country, rejoicing only in her protec∣tion and esteem, laying at her feet those honors which kings could not confer, nor take from him—was an act of greatness which sanctified his former exer∣tions and atchievements, and gave the fairest lustre to his character.</P>
<P>CONSIDERED in his political capacity and as a <HI>civil Ruler,</HI> he was likewise great.</P>
<P>HE must early have been distinguished in this re∣spect, to be chosen to the first Congress which con∣vened on the grievances and interests of the Coun∣try.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chosen a Delegate by the then Colony of Virginia, Aug. <HI>5, 1774.</HI>—Took his seat in Congress, Sept. <HI>5, 1774.</HI></NOTE> His character is more fully illustrated in his numerous letters, and other writings: it is still more highly attested in his being a member and President of the Convention by which our present Constitution of Government was formed;—but it is most clearly displayed in his administration as President of the United States.</P>
<P>THAT he supported this high Office with dignity, and faithfully executed its very important and com∣plicated duties, not only the voice of the constituted authorities, and of the country at large; but the prosperity of the country is a testimony.</P>
<P>HE was the <HI>first</HI> President on the present system of Government. Under him, the public regulations in general, in our internal and external relations, were adjusted: those officers who have conducted,
<PB N="10" REF="038196_0022_101141F020AA3690"/>
and continue to conduct, the public business, with so much discretion, vigilance and integrity, were appointed: that decree of neutrality, which has pre∣vented our being involved in the perils and expen∣ces of a fruitless war, was promulged—and our relations to foreign nations settled, in a manner as conducive as possible to our prosperity and peace.</P>
<P>A FURTHER instance of his greatness appears, after he had retired from public service, in his ac∣cepting the command of the forces, to be raised for the support of our rights and privileges as Citizens, and the defence of the country.</P>
<P>WHEN he had labored, with little intermission, for a long time in the most arduous fields of public action; when he had long borne the weight of pub∣lic cares and interests, even till he had become old and grey headed: and when, from confidence in the ability and experience of others, he had resigned his public Office, and withdrawn to the shade of his patrimonial dwelling—that, at the appearance of danger, and his country's call, he should again come forth▪ that he should arise from his seat and gird on his armour, willing to sacrifice the repose of his last days to the public good—was an instance of great∣ness, not exceeded in any of his former actions, and which only such peculiar circumstances admit of being exhibited to view.</P>
<P>IT may further be observed, that he was great in <HI>reputation,</HI> and in <HI>influence.</HI></P>
<P>HIS <HI>fame went into all lands, and the fear of him was upon all nations,</HI> 1 Chron. xiv.17.—No other person on earth was so universally loved and respect∣ed. His influence was particularly great in this
<PB N="11" REF="038196_0023_101141F2DFCE6908"/>
country. Many, who appear to mistake the public interests, were convinced of his merit; and though not apprehending the force of his example in obey∣ing the laws, listened to his advice and approved of his conduct and opinions. As <HI>Abner,</HI> from his cha∣racter and reputation, might manage the tribes of Israel as he pleased; and as it was said of <HI>David,</HI> on a certain occasion, II Sam. iii, 36, that <HI>all the people took notice</HI> of his behaviour, <HI>and it pleased them; as whatever the king did pleased all the people:</HI> so it may be said, the people were disposed to observe the words and actions of <HI>Washington</HI>; and all that he said, or did, gave general satisfaction. His opinion, with few exceptions, was the public sentiment, and re∣gulated the public will.</P>
<P>THIS confidence resulted, not only from his dis∣tinguished endowments and reputation: but from the <HI>integrity</HI> of his heart. No one could accuse him of a wrong intention; or mistrusted, that he would be biassed by self-interest, or party zeal, or any other perverse and injurious principle.</P>
<P>INDEED, my afflicted, respected Auditors, if any thing great in its nature, or consequences, have taken place in the political experience of this coun∣try, since <HI>Washington</HI> came on the stage of action, then he was great: for he was the chief instrument, in the hand of Heaven, of accomplishing the events, and effecting the changes, for which that epoch is distinguished.</P>
<P>IF it were great, for an infant people to assert their own rights, and those of mankind; and to op∣pose one of the most formidable, and to us, before, the most venerated of earthly powers: then was
<PB N="12" REF="038196_0024_101141F589310318"/>
<HI>Washington</HI> great; for he assisted in the counsel, and took command of our armies.</P>
<P>IF it were great, for a people to form and amica∣bly agree in a Constitution of general Government, comprehending a great diversity of dispositions, manners and habits, and harmonizing an infinite variety of interests: a constitution the boast of our country and reason, and beneficial to mankind as an example of regard, in freemen, to order and civil rule, then was <HI>Washington</HI> great: for in that au∣gust Convention, where this Constitution was form∣ed, he Presided.</P>
<P>IF it were great, to introduce the operation of this new system of government; to execute the highest Office, with approbation and applause, and leave an example, which it is one of the first wishes, both for the good of the country and <HI>their</HI> honor, that his successors may imitate, then was <HI>Washington</HI> great: for with his administration, the operation of the Con∣stitution commenced; and on his final resignation, the public regret was more expressive, than their profuse applauses, of the ability with which he had discharged its duties.</P>
<P>IF it were great, for a person advanced in years, and worn with labour, and blessed with the privileges of domestic peace, to return to public service; to take the command of a <HI>patriotic</HI> army, to guard the liber∣ties and government of the country▪ to resist, if neces∣sary, a perverted, licentious, threatening <HI>world</HI> in arms—then was <HI>Washington</HI> great; for, from the calm retreat, where he hoped to close his days, he came at the call of his country. Her dangers, and the thought of meeting her sons, with here and there a veteran, in the field, strengthened his knees, and
<PB N="13" REF="038196_0025_101141F86188F218"/>
invigorated his arm, renewing <HI>his youth like the ea∣gle's:</HI> and he was still considered the safest of guides, and our greatest earthly defence.</P>
<P>HIS character, in the various stations and lights in which it has been viewed, was great. Had he appeared in only one of them, he would have been thought distinguished. How is his greatness enhan∣ced when his character is collectively considered!</P>
<P>HIS talents must have been pre-eminent. He must have been formed by Heaven, to give an example of greatness and goodness—expressive of divine benevo∣lence▪ useful to us and instructive to the human race. Of true greatness, goodness is the support and lustre. The greatness of this person was connected with good∣ness, and the result of it. He appears to have acted with a view to the approbation of conscience, enlight∣ed by a belief of the being and superintending provi∣dence and government of God, and the principles and representations of the Gospel: and his character, in its disinterestedness and generosity, its utility, its self-diffidence, its decision, its piety, its faithfulness and glory, is a striking example of what is the object of the Gospel to produce.</P>
<P>THIS character is removed from among us. <HI>Know ye not, that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in</HI> our <HI>Israel! Washington</HI> is dead! Let us pause a moment—Our feelings are chilled at the reflection—utterance fails me.</P>
<P>—BUT we have assembled in the house of God to consider and improve this afflictive dispensation of providence<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and it must be the</P>
<P>FIRST of our reflections, that it is a just subject of deep▪ and general grief.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="038196_0026_101141FB25BD1648"/>IF we have any sensibility to the frowns of provi∣dence, any respect for the characters of the great and good, any love for our country, we must be, deeply affected with this bereavement.</P>
<P>IF the divine favor were expressed, in raising up such a person, and continuing him for such important purposes, that he should be taken away is a chastise∣ment; and ought to be deplored, as we should feel the afflictive hand of Heaven.</P>
<P>AS we venerated and admired his talents and vir∣tues, we must lament his removal: for though in its consequences an infinite acquisition, as we trust and and believe to him, the evil to us is great: we shall behold his face, be instructed by his counsels, bene∣fitted by his exertions no more.</P>
<P>THE love of our Country justifies our sorrow at his death. Great to her were the advantages of his character in what he had done, and might do. He was not only a chief instrument of the political bles∣sings we enjoy, and the head of our military forces; but more than any other individual character a cen∣tre of union to all classes of citizens; and might be an important means of prolonging our peace, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our prosperity. If David lamented the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> General, who might have united the tribes of Israel, and brought them to obedience; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pro∣priety may <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a character <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> father of our country, the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> is wit∣ness, that we sincerely <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.— Were it poison that took <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> could have drank it for thee—were <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of an assassin, we could have received it into our own bosom— But it was the hand of God. That hand, which
<PB N="15" REF="038196_0027_101141FCCD75FBE0"/>
closed thine eyes, may yet support our hearts: may teach them to submit: may grant them consolation and peace: may avert the evils which we appre∣hend, and continue the blessings we enjoyed in thee!</P>
<P>THIS event likewise exhibits in an impressive light, that we should not place our confidence in man.</P>
<P>IN all ages, the great and good have, with other characters, been brought to death. <HI>Our fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever?</HI> The grave is <HI>without any order:</HI> the <HI>great</HI> and <HI>small</HI> are there. Abner, the important character and chief General mentioned in our subject, was prematurely slain. David, who lamented him, and was far his superior in virtues and station, became old and final∣ly gave up the ghost. <HI>Washington,</HI> who has long been a subject of public confidence, an object of pub∣lic admiration and esteem, is gone. <HI>Man is not to be accounted of, whose breath is in his nostrils. The days of his years are threescore years and ten: and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years; yet is their strength, labor and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we flee away.</HI> From the frailty of human life, we ought not to rely on man. If we cannot depend on his existence, it is evident we cannot depend on his exertions for our good.</P>
<P>THE subject further teaches, the reason for gra∣titude, that the character we have considered was brought into existence, and so long continued.</P>
<P>SUCH a character was of great importance—was necessary to our welfare, as a people. It was an act of great goodness in GOD, that he should form his
<PB N="16" REF="038196_0028_101141FFBAB59E08"/>
servant with such endowments, and lead the public mind to observe them: that he should continue his servant through a series of trials; support him in his <HI>labors,</HI> till he had arrived at old age, and in his use∣fulness till death.</P>
<P>IN some instances persons of talents, and capable of promoting the public welfare, are not discriminat∣ed. They are like those flowers which, in the lan∣guage of the Poet, are
<Q><L>"—born to blush, unseen;</L>
<L>"And waste their sweetness on the desert air."</L></Q></P>
<P>IN some instances, when called into action, and public expectations are excited, and the public con∣fidence engaged, they are prematurely cut down, either by treachery, or disease, and thus are like chil∣dren <HI>carried from the cradle to the grave.</HI> But the talents of this person did not escape public observa∣tion: and he was continued in public office till his principles and modes of conduct could be ascertain∣ed, and marked; forming an example, in fair and full proportion, calculated to instruct and engage imitation.</P>
<P>WE have likewise reason for gratitude, that he was left to no action by which his reputation would be fullied, and his example rendered pernicious.— Many persons outlive their characters; but his was uniform till <HI>death</HI> put the seal upon it, and precluded the possibility of its being tarnished. The public eye will ever behold it with admiration and pleasure, and the imitation of it will conduce to individual great∣ness and excellence, and the general good.</P>
<P>FINALLY, the subject, in its various parts, enforces the duty of trusting alone in GOD.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="038196_0029_10114204B530A748"/>WHEN a created being is removed, the divine arm is not shortened: to think it is, implies that we viewed the creature in the place of the Creator. When a created being is removed, he, indeed, is deprived of ability to assist us; but the ability of God is not impaired. He is infinite and unchange∣able: the source of all power and goodness. As distinguished public characters are a testimony of his merciful agency, so their removal should lead us to make him the sole object of confidence.—In this temper, we may be certain of his support and pro∣tection.</P>
<P>THAT he is able to relieve and bless, appears, not only from his infinite perfection, and from his forming characters, once useful and important; but from his raising up others to supply the place of these, when removed. In many instances, when great and in∣fluential characters were taken from the people of Israel, and they appeared in danger of anarchy and ruin, the Lord interposed, and preserved them in or∣der and peace. When Moses died, Joshua was cal∣led to the command: when Elijah was taken, his <HI>spirit rested on Elisha:</HI> when David slept with his fathers, Solomon was established on his throne: and reigned with wisdom and glory, and in peace. The same divine power and goodness which formed <HI>Washington,</HI> may bless us with continued advantages in other characters, and increase our prosperity and happiness.</P>
<P>THE welfare of our Country is an object too dear and important to be resigned, but from necessity:— and added to the present loss, would render it truly overwhelming. If it were a maxim with heathens, that "no one ought to despair respecting the Re∣public;" it is still more improper that we should de∣spair
<PB N="18" REF="038196_0030_101142064305FCA0"/>
as Christians—as subjects of the highest civil and religious privileges.</P>
<P>UNGRATEFUL would it be, not to perceive and acknowledge, the various testimonies, which GOD is yet giving, in favour of our support.</P>
<P>IT was a blessing, in this sense, that the person we this day lament, was not taken while at the head of government; but from a station, where his example of obedience to the laws is calculated to strengthen, rather than interupt the public harmony.</P>
<P>WE have reason to be thankful, in this sense, for the Constitution of general government; which is now established, and is armed with power to silence faction, as well as repel foreign invasion.</P>
<P>WE have likewise a testimony of divine goodness in the character of the present Chief Magistrate, the <HI>President</HI> of the <HI>United States</HI>; to whose hands <HI>Wash∣ington,</HI> with satisfaction, saw the reigns of government committed; and in whose high talents, and tried integrity, and regard to religion, we may not only be assured of a faithful and honorable discharge of the duties of that office, but the beneficial influence of an example, far more extensive than his authority.</P>
<P>WE have likewise encouragement from the public spirit, the talents and experience of our Officers in general, civil and military; and the patriotism of a large majority of the people.</P>
<P>THE grief which overspreads the country; which pervades all orders of characters, and appears in mourning in every place, is an evidence, we trust, that the example of <HI>Washington</HI> will be imitated.— Then, under the divine blessing, our councils will be
<PB N="19" REF="038196_0031_10114207CC8F2DF0"/>
wise, our arms invincible; government will be re∣spected, and our interests will prosper.</P>
<P>MAY the Lord sanctify his example, and his death, to these important purposes. May he bless the vir∣tuous <HI>Relict</HI> of his deceased servant: and be her God and never failing portion—and support with his favor, the particular connections, under this bereavement. May he bless the President of the United States, grant∣ing him the light of his countenance and his direction. May he bless all our Rulers and Officers, with the people of the country, and build us up as a nation.— May he subdue the spirit of sin and violence, and mi∣tigate the evils which result from it; and cause the earth to be the suburbs of that glorious state, where love has universal influence, and peace eternal reigns —where all tears are wiped forever from the eye, and the righteous rest in the bosom of God.</P>
