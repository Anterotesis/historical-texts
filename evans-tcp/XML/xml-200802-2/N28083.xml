<HEAD>AN <HI>Eulogy moralized.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS anniversary, we used to celebrate with joy, as the Birth Day of one of the greatest and best men; but our joy is turned into sorrow:—instead of the emblems of joy and festivity, we are shrouded with the insignia of sorrow and heart-felt <HI>grief:</HI>—for this great and good man is no more!—His death, which took place on the 14th of last December, has inervated and paralized all the springs of hilarity, which were set in motion at the remembrance of his birth-day, which (allowing for the alteration of stile) took place on the 22d of February, 1732.</P>
<P>BUT why! why should his death eclipse all the joy of his natal day? for does not the wise king say, that a good name is better than precious ointment, and the day of ones death is better than the day of ones birth?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ecc. vii. 1.</NOTE>—And who says the contrary? Certainly, the fragrancy of a good name, justly acquired, is more extensively diffused, more beneficial in its influence, and more permanent in its duration:—It will live in the page of history, and continue to shed its be∣nign influence to unborn generations, when the most pre∣cious ointment shall lose all its perfume, and its subtle ef∣fluviae will evaporate into empty air.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="037433_0003_100D4210ACF3ACD8" MS="y"/>"SURELY the righteous shall be had in everlasting re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>embrance." Therefore the day of a good man's death is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etter for himself, than the day of his birth.</P>
<P>AT his birth he sets out upon a very precarious journey, with no certain objects in view, is attended on the way with sin and sorrow: "for man who is born of a woman is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f few days and full of trouble." At death he obtains the object of his desires; escapes from sin and sorrow, and en∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers upon a life of immortal joy and triumph.</P>
<P>MAN is born a frail dying creature, but at death he rises <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto perfection, and puts on the lucid-robes of immortality, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd mortality is swallowed up of life.</P>
<P>FOR these and many other reasons, the death of a good man may be said to be better than his birth. Why then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o we mourn and lament the death of our beloved General? Who has justly acquired a name "which is better than pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious ointment; a name which is better than that of sons <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r daughters," The answer is easy.—It is not on his ac∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ount that we mourn: we hail him honored and happy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eyond expression: But we are met, not merely to recog∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ize his birth, but to pay a debt of gratitude we owe to God—to departed merit—and to ourselves and posterity which became due at his death. To God, we owe our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nfeigned gratitude and thankfulness for this invaluable gift. He formed him with all those athletic powers of body which enabled him to endure hardships as a good soldier, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd with those well proportioned limbs, and expressive fea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ures, which commanded respect and esteem. He inspired
<PB N="5" REF="037433_0004_100D421358C01EE0" MS="y"/>
him with all that wisdom and courage which enabled him to foresee, face and conquer, or to escape from those diffi∣culties and dangers he could not overcome. He adorned and inriched him with all those illustrious virtues which made him outshine all his co-patriots both in the field and in the cabinet—at the head of a brave army, or as the first magistrate in the chair of state. For it is thine O God to give both riches and honor, and in thine hand is power and might, and it is in thine hand to make great and to give strength unto all." Let therefore the tear of ingenuous sorrow which has bedewed the cheek of millions, be mixed with the tear of gratitude to God for such a seasonable, such an accomplished instrument of his glory and our salvation.</P>
<P>HE was but the instrument, and his wise and energetic administrations was the channel, through which flowed to us, the greatest and the choicest national blessings "from the Father of Lights, from whom cometh down every good and perfect gift." Gratitude to the Father of the universe has a just claim upon us, for this tribute of respect which we this day pay to the memory of the "man whom he de∣lighteth to honor."</P>
<P>IT is a debt due to departed merit, which can in no way be paid so well, as by the spontaneous effusions of sin∣cere sorrow;—by strictly adhering to his wise counsels, and by immitating his amiable and illustrious virtues.</P>
<P>IT is a rate thing to see true greatness and real goodness blended in one character:—We have heard of great men, an <HI>Alexander,</HI> a <HI>Caesar,</HI> a <HI>Pompey,</HI> a <HI>Lewis</HI> and a <HI>Frederic:</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="037433_0005_100D4215391E8348" MS="y"/>
and from the bustle and noise which they made, and the devastations and slaughter which they spread, they, with oth∣ers of similar characters were called <HI>great</HI> but without an abuse of language they could not be called <HI>good:</HI>—For whether they meditated <HI>peace</HI> or <HI>war</HI>— the tranquility or disturbance of the world—whether they sought the prosperity or de∣vastation of countries; whether they govern nations▪ or command armies, still interest, ambition or revenge, were their leading-motives; and while they ruled or tyranized over millions they had no rule over their own passions, and they set no bounds to their ambition and avarice.</P>
<P>BUT rare as it is for great men to be good, we have one instance at least and we hope we have many, but the great abilities of the good man whose death we this day lament, was combined and adorned with eminent virtues.</P>
<P>WE saw him early rise to eminence by the joint display, of both great abilities and illustrious virtues. We saw him rise and shine the <HI>Patriot,</HI> the <HI>Hero</HI> and the <HI>Saint.</HI> At the head of a victorious army, at the helm of government, and in the humble retreats of rural life.</P>
<P>THOUGH surrounded with all the fascinating alurements of ambition, interest, sensuality and licentiousness, cov∣ered with glory, invested with power, and abound∣ing in wealth; yet foregoing all selfish and mercenary views, he maintained that absolute self-government as gave him a just claim to the character of the pious, benevolent, just, meek, temperate, and <HI>good man.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="037433_0006_100D421733507D68"/>WE have seen him, unappalled in the midst of great dangers and embarrassments; extricating himself and his faithful bands or constituents, "without having recourse to mean compliances, or dishonorable expedients."</P>
<P>THIS favorite son of fortune was unaffected with her ca∣pricious <HI>favors</HI> or <HI>frowns</HI>:—He was undismayed at the most formidable aspects, uncontaminated amidst the strongest temptations—"No bribe could seduce him, no terror could overawe him." He acknowleded God in all his way, and looked to him to direct his steps for him; and ever approv∣ed himself to God, and to his own conscience as in the sight of God;—In comparison with <HI>this,</HI> it was with him "a small thing to be judged by men's judgments." But it was his great concern to be found faithful to that Being, who had intrusted him with so many talents, "that he might give up his account with joy." And agreeable to that religion which he publicly professed, he was benevolent to all men kind and faithful to his friends, generous to his enemies compassionate to the poor and distressed.</P>
<P>NEVER perhaps was there a severer conflict between th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> softer passions of the man and the christian, and the sterne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> virtues of the judge and the commander in chief, when by the defection and treachery of Arnold, imperious necessit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> directed his trembling hand to sign the warrant whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> consigned the hapless, but young and generous And<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to an ignominious death; while his heart melted into be¦nevolence and pity, he did justice and loved mercy; coul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> keep the balance of his spirit in the most trying scenes.— He appeared insensible to the little ill-offices, which un¦provoked
<PB N="8" REF="037433_0007_100D4219C967C2B8" MS="y"/>
malice or envy employed to blot his character, or to the uncandid censures which little minds passed upon a partial view of his public conduct; but he was all sensi∣bility, activity and zeal in whatever concerned the public welfare.</P>
<P>HE, (as one observes) both in his public and private walks, "supported dignity without pride, humility with∣out meanness, justice without partiality or severity, liberal∣ity without profusion, courage without rashness or presump∣tion; and with a nice sense of propriety he always did eve∣ry thing in the best manner and time." Such a character is a <HI>phenomenon</HI> in our degenerate world; but such a <HI>phe∣nomenon</HI> Almighty God, has caused to appear in our <HI>Hemis∣phere,</HI> and by its benign influence has blessed, honored and distinguished us as a nation above all modern nations be∣sides.</P>
<P>I CAN say as a learned writer on this occasion said.— <Q>I never met in any volume of ancient or modern history, or even in the fictions of <HI>romance</HI> a single character so ex∣empt from every spot of vice, from every shade of weak∣ness or indiscretion, or so complete in the abilities of the general, in the talents of the statesman—so uniform and replete in the virtues of the citizen and the christian.</Q></P>
<P>BUT he is no more!—Shall we not lament such a loss!—Is there not a debt due to such departed merit! —If I should attempt to trace the series of events of a seven or eight years war, and delineate the martial skill of this great commander, this man of war, I should attempt

what is beyond my power <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> accomplish, and it would re∣quire much more time than we have at present to spare▪ This must be le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the faithful pen of the historian—to the just paintings of the poet in his heroic verse, and to the sculptured marble pillar erected to his honor by the hand of a grateful people—Let it suffice to say—His military virtues astonished all <HI>Europe</HI>—baffled the ablest Generals— compelled the veteran troops of Great Britain to submit to his superior talents, and constrained her Parliament to ac∣knowledge the Independence of <HI>America,</HI> and concede to such articles of peace as placed the liberties of our nation on the most respectable and permanent basis.</P>
<P>WE saw our WASHINGTON not a mere soldier, like other great warriors, grasping at empire by the destruction of foreign nations, or aspiring to a civic crown, through seas of blood and slaughter; but the greater warrior who could blend the feelings of the citizen with those of the sol∣dier, and temper the ambition of the conqueror with the humility and meekness of the Christian:—Such a rare combination of talents and virtues, admirably formed him for command and intitled him to the first distinction in the list of military fame.</P>
<P>He shone equally in the chair of state at the head of the national council, as he did at the head of the combined armies of America. And justly estimating the invaluable blessings which had been earned by blood, and acquired by the dangers of military life, he watched over them with more than parental care—no ruler ever did, or could have adopted wiser maxims, or have taken more prudent mea∣sures,
<PB N="10" REF="037433_0009_100D421E88D3E728" MS="y"/>
to prevent the evil consequence of undue foreign in∣fluence or domestic faction and maintain the peace and in∣dependence of America.—And what gave a dignified lustre to all his talents and virtues was, that he united piety and morality in his whole deportment; for whatever were his talents, or whatever were his virtues, he consecrated them all to his God and his country. Not like the impious philosophers and disorganizers of the present day;—He made no separation between the duties we owe to God and the duties we owe to our fellow men, or to society at large. He was not too wise to be above the instruction of divine wisdom, nor so inconscious of guilt as to despise the redemption of the <HI>Cross,</HI> but devoutly attended upon the institutions of <HI>Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>THESE are some of the out-lines of this great and good man's character whose death we this day lament; and I appeal to you again to say whether such departed merit does not justify these extraordinary effusions of grief. For great and good as he was, <HI>He is gone</HI>—for ever gone—"The Lord the arbiter of life has removed him into darkness—He changed his countenance and sent him away:—strength and agility, military skill and fortitude, prudence and penetra∣tion, piety and morality—could not obtain for him a dis∣charge in this war. For behold! the Lord, the Lord of hosts doth take away the mighty man, the man of war, the prudent and the ancient, the honorable man and the counsellor, and we must be still and know that it is God who hath done it."</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="037433_0010_100D422014F23690" MS="y"/>BUT this public and ingenuous grief is a tribute we thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> day owe to ourselves and posterity.</P>
<P>IT is, my friends, of great importance that we mour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as we ought, not for him of whom the world was no longe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> worthy, but for ourselves and for our children;—for it wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for us, that he was formed, by the great Father of our spi¦rits, to move in a sphere of the first magnitude here below till he had obtained to full orbed glory, and touched th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> highest point of human greatness;—It was for us be fought it was for us he lived, and it was, in one sense, for us h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> died; that by the virtues of his life, and by the pious for¦titude of his dying behaviour, he might teach us how t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> live and how to die;—how like him we might fill our re¦spective spheres with light and truth, "in simplicity an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> godly sincerity," and at the close of life, rise superior t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> death the last enemy, and like Him, come off more tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> conquerors, and bear away the crown of glory.</P>
<P>FOR us and our country we have abundant reason t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> weep and mourn, and with <HI>Elisha</HI> to exclaim <HI>"My Father my Father!</HI> the chariot of America and the horsemen there of."

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e cannot tell. We know that it has been the method of Divine Providence, when the judgments of God are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mpending over a sinful people, to remove from among <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem the favorites of Heaven, who stand in the gap, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y their wisdom, counsel and prayers warded off the blow. The righteous are taken away from the evil to come: Noth∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng is more seasonable for, or interesting to us, than that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his melancholy event should excite in us sincere repentance, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd work in us a thorough amendment of life, "so that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>niquity may not be our ruin."</P>
<P>WE learn from this awful providence, that we must not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut our trust in princes, nor in any of the sons of men; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat we must transfer our humble trust and confidence to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat God who is the absolute sovereign of the universe; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho superintends all human affairs:—And while we con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>der that all the commotions and revolutions, in any coun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y, with all their hidden springs and causes are under the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ontroling, restraining and directing providence of God, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e cannot but see, nay feel, how much it concerns us, both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s individuals and as a nation, that we are in favor of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mnipotent <HI>Ruler.</HI> If we remain a sinful people, we must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xpect some way or another to feel the effects of divine an∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er:—And God has many more ways to manifest his dis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leasure than by the death of great and good men "though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey are the shields of the earth;" and their removal may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pen the flood-gates of divine wrath. A people, therefore, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom whom such characters are removed, should prepare to meet God in the way of his judgments.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="037433_0012_100D4223A8CF24C0" MS="y"/>BEFORE the breach is healed or we had dried up our tea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s at the grave of our good and beloved Governor SUM∣NER, the tear fountain is broached anew by the death of our well-beloved General WASHINGTON.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH we, for the present, are blessed with good rulers, both in Congress and in this Commonwealth, and have one at the head of the united federal government as discerning in times and seasons as his predecessor, yet it is not certain we always shall have; for as all the abilities of good rulers are from God, so He has threatened to withold from a sinful people those invaluable blessings, "causing the wisdom of the wise to perish, and the understanding of the prudent to be hid." The consequence is, intestine broils—the violence of party faction, anarchy, confusion and every evil work:—A greater calamity can scarcely fall to the lot of any one nation. And among the many bless∣ings which have flowed to, and enriched the United States through the medium of a WASHINGTON; one of the first magnitude is, a preservation from this dreadful calamity.— With what pains did he labor night and day, to guard the political ship, of which he was the pilot, that he might preserve her from being dashed on the rocks of party faction, or swallowed up in the vortex of foreign intrigue. How apprehensive he was of danger in these respects, appears in the strongest colours, in that almost divinely inspired vale∣dictory Address which he has left as a precious leg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y to the people of his late charge:—No dying father enjoined love and union upon his children with more tender solicitude, affectionate earnestness and pathetic anxiety. Having men∣tioned this <HI>Address,</HI> I need say no more nor can I say any
<PB N="14" REF="037433_0013_100D4225A0446810" MS="y"/>
thing so pertinent, or binding on all, or which would so clearly and so forcibly point out and injoin the duty we owe to ourselves and posterity on this melancholy occasion.— And the best evidence we can give of our sincerity in pay∣ing this public tribute, will be our paying a sacred regard to his wise counsels, his salutary instructions and his friendly advice exhibited in that address:—Read it, my friends, can∣didly, digest it thoroughly, and practice it religiously:— Were we to do this as a nation, it would not be in the power of earth or hell, or both combined, to interrupt our peace, impede our prosperity, or obstruct our national ho∣nor and happiness. Was I to extract from it, I should not know where to begin nor where to end, every sentence be∣ing fraught with so much good sense, wisdom and philan∣thropy, as to merit equal attention; or should I essay an abridgment, I should only mutilate and injure the whole: Therefore could I be heard by all the United States, I would strongly recommend <HI>this</HI> as the first of human com∣position, in which union, peace and piety, are the three central points at which all the rays of this compendium of wisdom, truth and goodness meet.—Union among our∣selves, peace with all nations, but alliance with none, piety of heart and morality of life form the paladium of our political safety and prosperity. And as Moses, the Wash∣ington of Israel, said, so may we say, "this is our life, our wisdom and understanding in the sight of all the nations, who shall hear of these statutes and shall say, sure∣ly this great nation is a wise and understanding people. What nation is there so great and who has God so nigh unto them."</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="037433_0014_100D42272CA2C200" MS="y"/>Now the father of his country is gone! this patriotic instructor is forever gone! And is it not a debt we owe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ourselves and posterity, that his sage advice, his patern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> counsels and instructions should return with redoubled force upon every reflecting mind of a bereaved nation, and be esteemed as "apples of gold in pictures of silver."</P>
<P>ON the principles of pure and undefiled religion as its sure basis, we have every reason to believe that his ow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> great character, his illustrious virtues and his extensive use∣fulness was built: no other foundation could sustain so noble, so refined and so finished a structure; especially since he exemplified in his own life what he has recommended to the observation of others.</P>
<P>MY hearers, it is a duty we owe to ourselves and posteri∣ty, that with hearts glowing with gratitude, we bow the knee in humble thankfulness to God, for all that peace and prosperity, He has conferred upon our nation and land, through the instrumentality of its founder, friend and ben∣efactor, and that he has left us as his falling <HI>mantle,</HI> the ex∣ample of his wisdom, virtue and patriotism.</P>
<P>WHAT more important favor could we receive from the Father of Lights, than a person of such a character to fill the chair of state and to preside over a nation born of his labors and cares, and nourished by his fostering hand till she had acquired a considerable degree of strength and sta∣bility, exulting in the quiet possession of freedom and in∣dependence? the rectitude of whose measures, the wisdom of whose counsels, and whose firm, prudent and energetic administrations formed a complete model for his successor.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="037433_0015_100D4228EFE07840" MS="y"/>NAY, we may all learn from the manner in which he presided in his public and domestic offices, how we should preside in our respective departments through life, and maintain a becoming dignity, order, peace, integrity and economy in our families and society.</P>
<P>THEN may we hope that God would continue to bless us with a long succession of good rulers, and in the path of peace and piety we shall finally meet our ascended father with all the faithful, in those blissful mansions where the spirits of just men are made perfect.</P>
<P>I MUST conclude, not because I have exhausted my subject, but because it is too tender to pursue any further.</P>
<P>COME then, my fellow mourners—let us unite with weeping millions and pay on this natal day the tribute we owe to God—to the memory of departed merit and to ourselves and posterity. We have lost the father of our country, which calls for the filial tear from every true Ame∣rican.</P>
<P>COME then, ye war-worn soldiers, who fought under his banner! Your general is no more! He has resigned his commission—He has dropped his sword—and all that was mortal of him, submitted to the stroke of death, and rests in the bed of dust.

<HEAD>THE <HI>Address,</HI> OF THE LATE <HI>General George Washington,</HI> TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>FRIENDS AND FELLOW-CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE period for a new election of a Citizen to admini∣ster the executive government of the United States, being not far distant, and the time actually arrived when your thoughts must be employed in designating the person, who is to be clothed with that important trust, it appears to me proper, especially as it may conduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice, that I should now apprise you of the resolution I have formed, to decline being con∣sidered among the number of those out of whom a choice is to be made.</P>
<P>I BEG you, at the same time, to do me the justice to be assured, that this resolution has not been taken, without a strict regard to all the considerations appertaining to the re∣lation which binds a dutiful citizen to his country; and that, in withdrawing the tender of service which silence in my situation might imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, I am influenced by no dimi∣nution of zeal for your future interest; no deficiency of grateful respect for your past kindness: But am supported by a full conviction that the step is compatible with both.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="037433_0019_100D4231A100E5F8" MS="y"/>THE acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in the office to which your suffrages have twice called me, have been a uniform sacrifice of inclination to the opinion of duty, and to a defference for what appeared to be your de∣sire. I constantly hoped that it would have been much earlier in my power, consistently with motives which I was not at liberty to disregard, to return to that retirement from which I had been reluctantly drawn. The strength of my inclination to do this, previous to the last election, had even led to the preparation of an address to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then perplexed and critical posture of affairs with foreign nations, and the una∣nimous advice of persons entitled to my confidence, impel∣led me to abandon the idea.</P>
<P>I REJOICE, that the state of your concerns external as well as internal, no longer renders the pursuit of inclination incompatible with the sentiment of duty o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> propriety: And am persuaded whatever partiality may be retained for my services, that in the present circumstances of our country, you will not disapprove my determination to retire.</P>
<P>THE impressions with which I first undertook the ardu∣ous trust, were explained on the proper occasion. In the discharge of this trust, I will only say, that I have with good intentions, contributed towards the organization and ad∣ministration of the government, the best exertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. Not unconscious, in the outset, of the inferiority of my qualifications, experi∣ence in my own eyes, perhaps still more in the eyes of others, has strengthened the motives to diffidence of myself; and
<PB N="21" REF="037433_0020_100D4234784570F8" MS="y"/>
every day the increasing weight of years admonishes m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more and more, that the shade of retirement is as necessary to me, as it will be welcome. Satisfied, that if any circum∣stances have given peculiar value to my services, they were temporary, I have the consolation to believe, that while choice and prudence invite me to quit the political scene, patriotism does not forbid it.</P>
<P>IN looking forward to the moment, which is intended to terminate the career of my public life, my feelings do not permit me to suspend the deep acknowledgment o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that debt of gratitude, which I owe to my beloved coun∣try for the many honors it has conferred upon me; stil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more for the stedfast confidence with which it has sup∣ported me; and for the opportunities I have thence enjoy∣ed of manifesting my inviolable attachment by service▪ faithful and persevering, though in usefulness unequal to my zeal. If benefits have resulted to our country from these services, let it always be remembered to our praise and as an instructive example in our annals, that under cir¦cumstances in which the passions, agitated in every direc∣tion, were liable to mislead, amidst appearances sometime dubious, vicissitudes of fortune, often discouraging in sit∣uations, in which not unfrequently want of success has coun∣tenanced the spirit of criticism—the constancy of you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> support was the essential prop of the efforts, and a guaran¦tee of the plans by which they were effected. Profoundl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> penetrated with this idea I shall carry it with me to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> grave, as a strong encitement to unceasing vows, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Heaven may continue to you the choicest tokens of its be¦neficence—that your union and brotherly affestion may b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="22" REF="037433_0021_100D423608082ED0" MS="y"/>
perpetual—that the free constitution, which is the work of your hands, may be sacredly maintained—that its admin∣istration in every department may be stamped with wisdom and virtue—that in fine, the happiness of the people of these States, under the auspices of liberty, may be made complete, by so careful a preservation and so prudent a use of this blessing, as will acquire to them the glory of recommending it to the applause, the affection, and adoption of every na∣tion which is yet a stranger to it.</P>
<P>HERE perhaps, I ought to stop. But solicitude for your welfare, which cannot end but with my life, and the apprehension of danger natural to that solicitude, urge me on an occasion like the present, to offer to your solemn contemplation, and to recommend to your frequent review, some sentiments which are the result of much reflection, of no inconsiderable observation, and which appear to me all important to the permanency of your felicity as a people. These will be offered to you with the more freedom, as you can only feel in them the disinterested warnings of a parting friend, who can possibly have no personal motive to bias his counsel. Nor can I forget, as an encourage∣ment to it, your indulgent reception of my sentiments on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> former and not dissimilar occasion.</P>
<P>INTERWOVEN as is the love of liberty with every liga∣ment of your hearts, no recommendation of mine is ne∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essary to fortify or confirm the attachment.</P>
<P>THE unity of Government which constitutes you one people, is also now dear to you. It is justly so; for it is a
<PB N="23" REF="037433_0022_100D423793E4BE30" MS="y"/>
main pillar in the edifice of your real Independence, the support of your tranquility at home, your peace abroad; of your safety; of your prosperity; of that very liberty which you so highly prize. But, as it is easy to foresee, that from different causes and from different quarters, much pains will be taken, many artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth, as this is the point in your political fortress, against which the batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly and actively (though often covertly and insidiously) direct∣ed, it is of infinite moment that you should properly esti∣mate the immense value of your National Union, to your collective and individual happiness; that you should cherish a cordial, habitual and immoveable attachment to it; ac∣customing yourselves to think and speak of it as of the pal∣ladium of your political safety and prosperity, watching for its preservation with jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may suggest even a suspicion that it can in any event be abandoned; and indignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest, or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the various parts.</P>
<P>FOR this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest. Citizens, by birth or choice, of a common coun∣try, that country has a right to concentrate your affections. The name of American, which belongs to you in your na∣tional capacity, must always exalt the just pride of patriot∣ism, more than any appellation derived from local discrim∣inations. With slight shades of difference you have the same religion, manners, habits and political principles.
<PB N="24" REF="037433_0023_100D4239D5E20148" MS="y"/>
You have in a common cause fought and triumphed toge∣ther; the Independence and Liberty you possess are the work of joint councils, and joint efforts, of common dan∣gers, sufferings and successes.</P>
<P>BUT these considerations however powerfully they ad∣dress themselves to your sensibility, are greatly outweighed by those which apply more immediately to your interest. Here every portion of our country finds the most com∣manding motives for carefully guarding and preserving the union of the whole.</P>
<P>THE North in an unrestrained intercourse with the South, protected by the equal laws of a common govern∣ment, finds in the production of the latter, great additional resources of maritime and commercial enterprise, and pre∣cious materials of manufacturing industry. The South in the same intercourse, benefitting by the agency of the North, sees its agriculture grow, and its commerce expand. Turning partly into its own channels the seamen of the North, it finds its particular navigation invigorated—and while it contributes, in different ways, to nourish and in∣crease the general mass of the national navigation, it looks forward to the protection of a maritime strength, to which itself is unequally adapted. The East in a like intercourse with the West, already finds, and in the progressive im∣provement of interior communications, by land and water, will more and more find a valuable vent for the commo∣dities which it brings from abroad, or manufactures at home. The West derives from the East supplies requisite to its growth and comfort—and what is perhaps of still
<PB N="25" REF="037433_0024_100D423CA5814D98" MS="y"/>
greater consequence, it must of necessity owe the secure enjoyment of indispensable outlets for its own productions to the weight, influence, and the future maritime strength of the Atlantic side of the union, directed by an indissoluble community of interest as <HI>one nation.</HI> Any other tenure by which the West can hold this essential advantage whether derived from its own separate strength, or from an apostate and unnatural connection with any foreign power, must be intrinsically precarious.</P>
<P>WHILE then every part of our country thus feels an im∣mediate and particular interest in union, all the parts combi∣ned cannot fail to find in the united mass of means and ef∣forts, greater strength, greater resource, proportionably greater security, from external danger, a less frequent in∣terruption of their peace by foreign nations; and what is of inestimable value! they must derive from union an exemp∣tion from those broils and wars between themselves, which so frequently afflict neighbouring countries, not tied toge∣ther by the same government; which their own rivalships alone would be sufficient to produce, but which opposite foreign alliances, attachments and intrigues would stimulate and imbitter.—Hence likewise they will avoid the necessity of those overgrown military establishments, which under any form of government are inauspicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as particularly hostile to Republi∣can Liberty: In this sense it is, that your union ought to be considered as a main prop of your liberty, and that the love of the one ought to endear to you the preservation of the other.</P>
<P>THESE considerations speak a persuasive language to every reflecting and virtuous mind, and exhibit the conti∣nuance
<PB N="26" REF="037433_0025_100D423E2FE53B00" MS="y"/>
of the UNION as a primary object of a patriotic de∣sire. Is there a doubt, whether a common government can embrace so large a sphere?—Let experience solve it. To listen to mere speculation in such a case were criminal. We are authorised to hope that a proper organization of the whole, with the auxiliary agency of governments for the respective subdivisions, will afford a happy issue to the experiment. It is well worth a fair and a full expe∣riment. With such powerful and obvious motives to the union, affecting all parts of our country, while experi∣ment shall not have demonstrated its impracticability, there will always be reason to distruct the patriotism of those, who in any quarter may endeavour to weaken its bands.</P>
<P>In contemplating the causes which may disturb our uni∣on, it occurs as matter of serious concern, that any ground should be furnished for characterising parties, by Geogra∣phical discriminations—Northern and Southern —Atlantic and Western; whence designing men may endevour to ex∣cite a belief, that there is real difference of local interest and views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence within particular districts, is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other districts. You cannot shield yourself too much against the jealousies and heart burnings which spring from these misrepresentations; they tend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together by fra∣ternal affection. The inhabitants of our western country have lately had a useful lesson on his head: They have seen, in the negotiation by the Executive, and in the unani∣mous ratification by the Senate, of the treaty with Spain, and in the universal satisfaction at that event throughout the United States, a decisive proof how unfounded were the suspicious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="27" REF="037433_0026_100D423FC048C8D0" MS="y"/>
general government and in the Atlantic States unfriendly to their interests in regard to the Missisippi; they have been witnesses to the formation of two treaties, that with Great Britain and that with Spain, which secure to them every thing they could desire, in respect to our foreign re∣lations, towards confirming their prosperity. Will it not be their wisdom to rely for the preservation of these advan∣tages on the UNION by which they were procured? Will they not henceforth be deaf to those advisers, if such they are, who would sever them from their brethren, and con∣nect them with aliens?</P>
<P>To the efficacy and permanency of your union, a gov∣ernment for the whole is indispensable. No alliances, how∣ever strict between the parts can be an adequate substitute; they will inevitably experience the infractions and interrup∣tions which all alliances in all times have experienced— Sensible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon your first essay, by the adoption of a constitution of gov∣ernment better calculated than your former for an intimate union, and for the efficacious management of your com∣mon concerns. This government, the offspring of your own choice, uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full investigation and mature deliberation, completely free in its principles, in the distribution of its powers, uniting secu∣rity with energy, and containing within itself a provision for its own amendment, has a just claim to your confidence and your support. Respect for its authority, compliance with its laws, acquiescence in its measures, are duties en∣joined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty. The basis of our political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter their constitutions of government. But
<PB N="28" REF="037433_0027_100D4241DC320868" MS="y"/>
the constitution which at any time exists, until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people, is sa∣credly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the power and the right of the people to establish government, presuppo∣ses the duty of every individual to obey the established government.</P>
<P>ALL obstructions to the execution of the laws, all com∣binations and associations, under whatever plausible char∣acter, with the real design to direct, controul, counteract or awe the regular deliberation and action of the constitu∣ted authorities, are destructive of this fundamental princi∣ple, and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize faction, to give it an artificial and extraordinary force—to put in the place of the delegated will of the nation, the will of a party, often a small but artful and enterprising minority of the community; and according to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make the public administration the mirror of the ill concerted and incongruous projects of fac∣tion rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome plans digested by common councils and modified by mu∣tual interests.</P>
<P>HOWEVER combinations or associations of the above description, may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely in the course of time and things, to become po∣tent engines, by which cunning, ambitious and unprincipled men, will be enabled to subvert the power of the people, and to usurp for themselves the reins of government; de∣stroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o unjust dominion.</P>
<P>TOWARDS the preservation of your government, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he permanency of your present happy state, it is requisite
<PB N="29" REF="037433_0028_100D4243D9404390" MS="y"/>
not only that you steadily discountenance irregular opposi∣tion to its acknowledged authority, but also that you resist with care, the spirit of innovation upon its principles, how∣ever specious the pretext. One method of assault may be to effect, in the forms of the constitution, alterations, which will impair the energy of the system, and thus to undermine what cannot be directly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited, remember that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true character of govern∣ment, as of other human institutions; that experience is the surest standard, by which to test the real tendency of the existing constitution of a country—that facility in changes upon the credit of mere hypothesis and opinion, exposes to perpetual change, from the endless variety of hypothesis and opinion; and remember, especially, that for the effi∣cient management of your common interest, in a country so extensive as ours, a government of as much vigor as is consistent with the perfect security of liberty is indispensa∣ble. Liberty itself will find in such a government, with powers properly distributed and adjusted, its surest guardian. It is, indeed, little else than a name, where the government is too feeble to withstand the enterprises of faction, to con∣fine each member of the society within the limits prescribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the secure and tranqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> enjoyment of the rights of person and property.</P>
<P>I HAVE already intimated to you, the danger of partie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the state, with particular reference to the founding o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them on geographical discriminations. Let me now tak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a more comprehensive view and warn you in the most sol∣emn manner against the baneful effects of a spirit of party, generally.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="037433_0029_100D42464C8EAD08" MS="y"/>THIS spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our na∣ture, having its root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under different shapes in all governments— more or less stifled, controuled, or repressed; but in those of the popular form, it is seen in its greatest rankness and is truly their worst enemy.</P>
<P>THE alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural to party dissen∣tion, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism— But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries, which result, grad∣ually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the absolute power of an individual; and sooner or later <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he chief of some prevailing faction, more able or more for∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unate than his competitors, turns this disposition to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urposes of his own elevation, on the ruins of Public Lib∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rty.</P>
<P>WITHOUT looking forward to an extremity of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind (which nevertheless ought not to be entirely out of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ght) the common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arty are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ise people to discourage and restrain it.</P>
<P>IT serves always to distract the Public Councils and en∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eble the Public Administration. It agitates the commu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity with ill-founded jealousies and false alarms; kindles the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nimosity of one part against another, foments occasionally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot and insurrection. It opens the door to foreign influ∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce and corruption, which find a facilitated access to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>overnment itself through the channels of party passions. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hus the policy and will of one country are subjected to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e policy and will of another.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="037433_0030_100D4247D7FCEA38" MS="y"/>THERE is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks upon the administration of the government, and serve to keep alive the spirit of Liberty.—This within certain limits is probably true, and in governments of a monarchial cast, patriotism may look with indulgence, if not with favor upon the spirit of party. But in those of the popular character, in governments purely elective, it is a spirit not to be encouraged.—From their natural tend∣ency it is certain there will always be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose. And there being constant danger of excess, the effort ought to be by force of public opinion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to be quenched; it demands uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a flame, least instead of warming it should consume.</P>
<P>IT is important likewise, that the habits of thinking in a free country, should inspire caution in those entrusted with its administration, to confine themselves within their respective constitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one department to encroach upon another. The spirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to create, whatever the form of government, a real despotism. A just estimate of that love of power, and proneness to abuse it, which predominates in the human heart is sufficient to satisfy us of the truth of this position. The necessity of reciprocal checks in the exercise of the political power; by dividing and distributing it into different depositories, and constitut∣ing each the guardian of the public weal against invasions by the others, has been evinced by experiments ancient and modern; some of them in our country and under our own
<PB N="32" REF="037433_0031_100D424A39E50798" MS="y"/>
eyes. To preserve them must be as necessary as to institute them. If, in the opinion of the people, the distribution or modification of the constitutional powers be in any particu∣lar wrong, let it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the constitution designates—But let there be no change by usurpation; for though this, in one instance, may be the instrument of good, it is the customary weapon by which free governments are destroyed—The precedent must always greatly overbalance in permanent evil any par∣tial or transient benefit which the use can at any time yield.</P>
<P>OF all the dispositions and habits which lead to polit∣ical prosperity, Religion and Morality are indispensable supports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who would labor to subvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to respect and to cherish them.—A volume could not trace all their connections with private and pub∣lic felicity. Let it simply be asked, where is the security for property, for reputation, for life, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths which are the instruments of in∣vestigation in Courts of Justice?—And let us with caution indulge the supposition, that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded of the in∣fluence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principles.</P>
<P>IT is substantially true, that virtue or morality is a ne∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essary spring of popular government. The rule indeed extends with more or less force to every species of free gov∣ernment. Who that is a sincere friend to it can look with
<PB N="33" REF="037433_0032_100D424C418E77D0" MS="y"/>
indiffere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e upon attempts to shake the foundation of the fabric?</P>
<P>PROMOTE, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for the general diffusion of knowledge. In pro∣portion as the structure of a government gives force to pub∣lic opinion, it is essential that public opinion should be en∣lightened.</P>
<P>As a very important source of strength and security, cherish public credit—One method of preserving it is to use it as sparingly as possible; avoiding occasions of expence by cultivating peace, but remembering also that timely dis∣bursements to prepare for dangers, frequently prevent much greater disbursements to repel it. Avoiding likewise the accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasions of expence, but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to dis∣charge the debts which unavoidable wars may have occa∣sioned, not ungenerously throwing upon posterity the bur∣then which we ourselves ought to bear. The execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives, but it is ne∣cessary that public opinion should co-operate. To facilitate to them the performance of their duty, it is essential that you should practically bear in mind that towards the pay∣ment of debts there must be revenue—that to have reve∣nue there must be taxes—and none can be devised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant—that the intrinsic embarrassment inseperable from the selection of the proper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties)— ought to be a decisive motive for a candid construction of the conduct of the government in making it, and for a spirit of acquiescence in the measures for obtaining revenue which the public exigencies may at any time dictate.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="037433_0033_100D424EAB2929F0"/>OBSERVE good faith and justice towards all nations— cultivate peace and harmony with all—Religion and mo∣rality enjoins this conduct; and can it be, that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be worthy of a free, en∣lightened, and (at no distant period) a great nation, to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a people always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence. Who can doubt that in the course of time and things, the fruits of such a plan would richly repay any temporary ad∣vantages which might be lost by a steady adherence to it? Can it be, that Providence has not connected the perma∣nent felicity of a nation with Virtue? The experiment, at least, is recommended by every sentiment which enobles human nature. Alas! is it rendered impossible by its vices?</P>
<P>IN the execution of such a plan, nothing is more es∣sential than that permanent, inveterate antipathies against particular nations, and passionate attachments for others should be excluded; and that in the place of them, just and amicable feelings towards all should be cultivated.—The nation, which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an habitual fondness, is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its animosity or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead it astray from its duty and its interest. Antipathy in one nation against another disposes each more readily to offer insult and injury, to lay hold of slight causes of umbrage, and to be haughty and intractable, when acci∣dental or trifling occasions of dispute occur.</P>
<P>HENCE frequent collisions, obstinate, envenomed and bloody contests. The nation, prompted by ill will and re∣sentment, sometimes impels to war the government, con∣trary to the best calculations of policy. The government sometimes participates in the national propensity, and adopts
<PB N="35" REF="037433_0034_100D425036A8E3B0"/>
through passion what reason would reject; at other times, it makes the animosity of the nation subservient to projects of hostility instigated by pride, ambition and other sinister and pernicious motives. The peace often, sometimes per∣haps the liberty, of nations has been the victim.</P>
<P>So likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for another induces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favor∣ite nations facilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest, in cases where no common interest exists, and infu∣sing into one the enmities of the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels and wars of the latter, without adequate inducement or justification. It leads also concessions to the favorite nation of privileges denied to others which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the concessions; by unnecessarily parting with what ought to have been retained; and by exciting jealousy, ill-will, a disposition to retaliate, in the parties from whom equal pri∣vileges are witheld:—And it gives to ambitious, corrupted or deluded citizens (who devote themselves to the favorite nation) facility to betray, or sacrifice the interests of their own country, without odium, sometimes even with popu∣larity; gilding with the appearances of a virtuous sense of obligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a laudable zeal for public good, the base or foolish compli∣ances of ambition, corruption, or infatuation. As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, such attachment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and inde∣pendent patriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic factions, to practice the arts of se∣duction, to mislead public opinion, to influence or awe th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> public councils; such an attachment of a small or weak towards a great and powerful nation, dooms the former to be the satllite of the latter.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="037433_0035_100D425244851EA8" MS="y"/>AGAINST the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I con∣jure you to believe me, fellow citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake; since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government.—But that jealousy to be useful must be impartial; else it becomes the instrument of the very influence to be avoided, instead of a defence against it. Excessive partiality for one foreign na∣tion, and excessive dislike of another, cause those whom they actuate to see danger only on one side, and serve to veil and even second the arts of influence on the other. Re∣al patriots who may resist the intrigues of the favorite, are liable to become suspected and odious; while its tools and dupes usurp the applause and confidence of the people, to surrender their interests.</P>
<P>THE great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign na∣tions is, in extending our commercial relations, to have with them as little political connection as possible. So far as we have already formed engagements, let them be fulfil∣led with perfect good faith. Here let us stop.</P>
<P>Europe has a set of primary interests, which to us have none or a very remote relation. Hence she must be enga∣ged in frequent controversies, the causes of which are essen∣tially foreign to our concerns. Hence therefore, it must be unwise in us to implicate ourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her politics, or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships, or enmities.</P>
<P>OUR detached situation, invites and enables us to pur∣sue a different course. If we remain one people under an efficient government, the period is not far off, when we may defy material injury from external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will cause the neutrality we
<PB N="37" REF="037433_0036_100D4254457DD2A0" MS="y"/>
may at any time resolve upon, to be scrupulously respect∣ed; when belligerent nations, under the impossibility of making acquisitions upon us will not lightly hazard the giving us provocation; when we may choose peace or war, as our interests, guided by justice, shall counsel.</P>
<P>WHY forego the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our own to stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with that of any part of Eu∣rope, entangle our peace and prosperity in the toils of Eu∣ropean ambition, rivalship, interest, humour or caprice?</P>
<P>'TIS our true policy to steer clear of permanent allian∣ces, with any portion of the foreign world; so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty to do it: for let me not be under∣stood as capable of patronizing infidelity to existing engage∣ments. I hold the maxim no less applicable to public than to private affairs, that honesty is always the best poli∣cy. I repeat it therefore, let those engagements be ob∣served in their genuine sense. But in my opinion, it is unnecessary and would be unwise to extend them.</P>
<P>TAKING care always to keep ourselves, by suitable es∣tablishments, on a respectable defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary alliances for extraordinary emer∣gencies.</P>
<P>HARMONY, liberal intercourse with all nations, are re∣commended by policy, humanity and interest. But eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> our commercial policy should hold an equal and impartia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hand; neither sending or granting exclusive favors or pre¦ferences—consulting the natural course of things; diffusin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and diversifying by gentle means the streams of commerce but forcing nothing; establishing, with powers so disposed in order to give trade a stable course to define the rights <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our merchants▪ and to enable the government to suppo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="38" REF="037433_0037_100D42563A32BA38"/>
them; conventional rules of intercourse, the best that pre∣sent circumstances and mutual opinion will permit, but tem∣porary, and liable to be from time to time abandoned or varied as experience or circumstances shall dictate; con∣stantly keeping in view, that 'tis folly in one nation to look for disinterested favors from another: that it must pay with a portion of its independence for whatever it may accept under that character; that by such acceptance, it may place itself in the condition of having given equivalents for nom∣inal favors, and yet of being reproached with ingratitude for not giving more. There can be no greater error than to ex∣pect, or calculate upon real favors from nation to nation. 'Tis an illusion which experience must cure, which a just pride ought to discard.</P>
<P>In offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels of an old affectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the strong and lasting impression I could wish—that they will controul the usual current of the passions, or prevent our nation from running the course which has hitherto marked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he destiny of nations: But if I may even flatter myself, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat they may be productive of some partial benefits, some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccasional good; that they may now and then recur to moderate the fury of party spirit, to warn against the mis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hiefs of foreign intrigue, to guard against the impostures <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f pretended patriotism; this hope will be a full recom∣ense for the solicitude for your welfare, by which they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave been dictated.</P>
<P>How far in the discharge of my official duties, I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een guided by the principles which have been delineated, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e public records and other evidences of my conduct must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itness to you and to the world. To myself, the assurance
<PB N="39" REF="037433_0038_100D4258835D8E98"/>
of my own conscience is, that I have at least believed my∣self to be guided by them.</P>
<P>IN relation to the still subsisting war in Europe, my Proclamation of the 22d April, 1795, is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your approving voice, and by that of your representatives in both Houses of Congress, the spirit of that measure has continually governed me, unin∣fluenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.</P>
<P>AFTER deliberate examination, with the aid of the best lights I could obtain, I was well satisfied that our country, under all the circumstances of the case, had a right to take and was bound in duty and interest to take a neutral po∣sition. Having taken it, I determined, as far as should depend on me, to maintain it with moderation.</P>
<P>THE considerations which respect the right to hold this conduct, it is not necessary on this occasion to detail. I will only observe, that according to my understanding o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the matter, that right, so far from being denied by any o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Belligerent Powers, has been virtually admitted by all.</P>
<P>THE duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred without any thing more, from the obligation which justice and humanity impose on every nation, in cases in which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is free to act, to maintain inviolate the relations of peace and amity towards other nations.</P>
<P>THE inducements of interest for observing that conduct will best be referred to your own reflections and experience With me, a predominant motive has been to endeavour to gain time to our country to settle and mature its yet recen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> institutions, and to progress without interruption, to tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> degree of strength and consistency, which is necessary t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> give it, humanly speaking, the command of its own fortunes</P>
<P>THOUGH in reviewing the incidents of my administra¦tion,
<PB N="40" REF="037433_0039_100D425A52C73C58" MS="y"/>
I am unconscious of intentional error: I am neverthe∣less too sensible of my defects not to think it probable that I have committed many errors. Whatever they may be, I fervently beseech the Almighty to avert or mitigate the evils to which they may tend. I shall also carry with me the hope that my country will never cease to view them with indulgence; and that after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service, with an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be consigned to oblivion, as my∣self must soon be to the mansions of rest.</P>
<P>RELYING on its kindness in this as in other things, and actuated by that fervent love towards it, which is so natural to a man who views in it the native soil of himself and his progenitors for several generations; I anticipate with plea∣sing expectation that retreat, in which I promise myself to realize, without alloy, the sweet enjoyment of partaking in the midst of my fellow-citizens, the benign influence of good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aws under a free government—the ever favorite object of my heart, and the happy reward as I trust, of our mutual cares, labors and dangers.</P>
