<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>2 KINGS, ii. 12.</BIBL>
<P>—MY FATHER, MY FATHER, THE CHARIOT OF ISRAEL, AND THE HORSEMEN THEREOF!—</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHEN the death of General WASHINGTON was announced, these significant and ex∣pressive words were among the first that occurred to my thoughts. They are the words of the prophet Elisha, on beholding Elijah translated from earth to heaven!</P>
<P>THE idea of the many distinguished benefits, which this eminent servant of God and man had conferred on his country, rushed into his mind, and inspired him with such an affecting sense of the unspeakable loss, sustained in his departure, that, overwhelmed with grief and regret, he cried out, "My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof!"</P>
<P>THE propriety of this apostrophe will be seen and felt by every one, who reflects, that warlike chariots, as well as horsemen, were in general use, both among
<PB N="6" REF="037438_0003_100D42CB6F211428"/>
the Jews and Pagans of antiquity; and that on these they principally relied in the day of battle. In this short, but comprehensive sentence, therefore, Elisha not only recognizes in Elijah, the venerable, endear∣ing, and provident qualities of a parent; but ascribes to him all the influence and energy of a numerous host; and bewails his exit as a misfortune, which reduced the kingdom to a weak and defenceless condition!</P>
<P>PURSUANT to this interpretation of the text, I propose briefly to consider, I. The singular favour which Heaven bestows on a people, by raising up men of elevated genius and patriotism to take part in the conduct of public concerns: II. The deplora∣ble calamity of being deprived of their abilities and labours, by death: and then, to improve the subject by pointing out the uses to be made of such afflictive bereavements.</P>
<P>BY far the greater part of mankind, in every re∣gion of the earth, however disposed, are, in the na∣ture of things, incapable of managing the affairs of state. Engrossed by the cares and pursuits which personal desires and wants create, they have neither leisure nor inclination to prepare themselves for so important a trust. For this purpose, a concurrence of circumstances and properties, which can fall to the share of but very few, are indispensably requisite. Beside undeviating rectitude of intention, a capacious understanding, much study, accurate observation, ex∣tensive knowledge, inflexible firmness, and great
<PB N="7" REF="037438_0004_100D42CE373583B0"/>
presence of mind, are essential characteristics of a good magistrate, or leader. I need not remark, that persons of this description are rarely to be found, and therefore proportionably estimable.</P>
<P>WITH such men at the head of the different de∣partments, a nation has little to fear, but from its own degeneracy. Like the sun in the firmament, they are the centre and source of light; and, while they regulate the motions of the several parts of the system, and confine the most excentric to their proper spheres, they shed a benign and salutary influence on the whole. Meanwhile, by their vigilant circum∣spection, they guard against the hostilities of foreign powers; and, in case of actual annoyance or invasion, furnish the best human means of indemnity and de∣fence. Under their administration, tumult and fac∣tion disappear, and every thing conspires the promo∣tion of order, peace, and security.</P>
<P>HAPPY the land, whose rulers are thus commission∣ed and sent, not to tyrannize and oppress; but "for the punishment of evil doers, and for the praise of them that do well:" and peculiar are the obliga∣tions of its inhabitants to Him, "by whom kings reign and princes decree justice," for his distinguish∣ing goodness!" "For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south. But God is the judge: He putteth down one, and setteth up another."</P>
<P>THIS, my brethren, has hitherto been our favour∣ed lot. Few nations can boast a more ample supply
<PB N="8" REF="037438_0005_100D42D0DEC37918"/>
of illustrious statesmen and warriors than America. We have now at our head, a man whose integrity and wisdom demand our highest confidence and es∣teem; and we can recount many in the legislative and judiciary branches of our government, in the military line, and even in private life, who are bles∣sings to their country, and ornaments to human na∣ture!—Still, however, we cannot but deeply feel and lament the loss of one of the greatest and best men, whom this, or any preceding century, has produced.</P>
<P>I PROCEED, then, II. To consider the deplorable calamity of being deprived of such characters, by death.</P>
<P>AMONG the severest judgments which the prophets, of old, denounced against the Jews, were the follow∣ing: "Behold the Lord, the Lord of hosts, doth take away from Judah, and Jerusalem, the mighty man, the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient. And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them. And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honorable."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah iii. 2, 4 5.</NOTE> A more just and striking description of that anarchy and confu∣sion, to which the want of able politicians and skilful chiefs invariably exposes a community, can hardly be conceived. Every people, in this situation, is more or less exposed to these distresses. For although there may be others, capable of succeeding and doing
<PB N="9" REF="037438_0006_100D42D269C19EF8"/>
honor to the station of the deceased; yet it cannot be certain that the preference will be given to the most deserving survivor. It is possible, at least, that ignorance, party zeal, or self-opinionated obstinacy may vest with the authority those who are totally unfit to govern: the consequence of which would be, a change of measures, fatal to the dignity and happiness of the nation!—But imagination must paint the long catalogue of evils which would inev∣itably follow such a mistaken decision; for language is inadequate to the task!</P>
<P>How great and portentous, then, is <HI>"our</HI> breach! Who can heal us?"</P>
<P>THE father, the friend, and the deliverer of his country sleeps in the silent tomb! And where is the man who will refuse to pay a tribute of the sincerest respect to his memory; or to contemplate, with un∣dissembled gratitude, his multifarious labours of love for the land in which we dwell?</P>
<P>HAVING previously signalized himself, both by his courage and conduct, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THE reader will scarcely need to be reminded, that the au∣thor here alludes to the gallant behaviour of General [then Col.] WASHINGTON, at Braddock's defeat, in 1755, and to the many other valiant achievements of his youth; too many to be enume∣rated in a single discourse.</NOTE> he was early invited to the supreme command in the revolutionary war. During that long and arduous struggle for liberty, he sur∣mounted the most perplexing difficulties, outbraved the most formidable opposition, and, with a degree of perseverance and address which astonished the
<PB N="10" REF="037438_0007_100D42D4092DEE08"/>
world, finally compelled one of the greatest powers in Europe to acknowledge the independence and sovereignty of its colonies. Yet far from being ela∣ted by his unexampled success, or, like the haughty monarch of Babylon, ascribing it to the might of his own arm, his language was uniformly the language of piety, gratitude, submission, and confidence to∣wards God.</P>
<P>AT the conclusion of the war, the army, who had fought and bled in the American cause, had claims, to a large amount, upon the public; nor was it pos∣sible that these claims should be immediately satisfied. Hence discontent and murmurs prevailed; and a re∣fusal to lay down their arms, till they were indem∣nified, was even contemplated. In this state of things, had the commander in chief been actuated by those ambitious views which have usually governed the conduct of heroes, both ancient and modern, how easily might he have subjected to his own control, those provinces, which he had been able to protect against foreign invaders! But he recoiled at the thought; and instead of availing himself of the un∣limited ascendency he had gained, to distress his country, no sooner was the object, for which an army had been raised, completed, than he persuaded his troops peaceably to disband, and wait with patience the reward of their toils; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>"AFTER the return of peace, the United States were redu∣ced to the disagreeable necessity of dismissing their brave troops, without paying them their stipulated wages. In this emergency, an attempt was made, by spirited and anonymous publications, to inflame the minds of the officers and soldiers, and induce them, previously to laying down their arms, to unite in redressing their own grievances.</P><P>"As soon as General WASHINGTON was informed of the na∣ture of these papers, he requested the general and field officers, with one officer from each company, and a proper representation from the staff of the army, to assemble on an early day. When they were convened, he addressed them in a pathetic and animat∣ed speech, in which he pledged himself to exert all his abilities and influence in their favour; requested them to rely on the faith of their country, and conjured them, "as they valued their honor; as they respected the rights of humanity; as they re∣garded the military and national character of America, to express their utmost detestation of the man, who was attempting to open the floodgates of civil discord, and deluge their rising empire with blood."</P><P>"THE patriotic exertions of their beloved General saved the states from impending danger. The army was disbanded, and returned peaceably to their respective places of abode." Vid. Miss H. Adams's History of New-England, page 478, 479.</P></NOTE> while he himself retired
<PB N="11" REF="037438_0008_100D42D626AEBD90"/>
to private life, and rejected every other compensation but the heartfelt pleasure of having emancipated mil∣lions from the yoke of bondage, and laid a founda∣tion for the freedom and prosperity of millions more, yet to be born!</P>
<P>HE did not, however, so far seclude himself from society, as to become indifferent to its welfare; nor was his fondness for the calm enjoyments of his hap∣py retreat, though great, sufficient to prevent his hearing and obeying the call of his country, when her exigencies again demanded his attention and his talents. He readily stepped forth, and with other long-tried patriots, formed that excellent constitution, which is, at once, the pride and security of every
<PB N="12" REF="037438_0009_100D42D9A7297788"/>
free-born American. When this constitution had received the sanction of the different states, and was to be brought into operation; and when all eyes were fixed upon him, as the first president, and su∣preme executive of the Union, disclaiming the wish and expectation of reward, he assumed the reins of government, and exchanged the pleasures of rural solitude, for the anxious cares and arduous duties of the most public and responsible office in the nation. When he had discharged the functions of this office, during the terms for which he was successively cho∣sen, with a degree of rectitude and discernment, no less honorable to himself, than advantageous to his constituents, he felt at liberty to revisit the peaceful shades of his retirement.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">"HAVING been twice chosen," says Gen. Marshall, in a pa∣thetic address to Congress, on this mournful occasion—"Having been twice unanimously chosen the Chief Magistrate of a free people, we see him, at a time when his re-election, with the uni∣versal suffrage, could not be doubted, affording a rare instance of moderation, by withdrawing from his high station, to the peace∣ful walks of private life."</NOTE> Once more, therefore, he took an affectionate leave of his country; and while he gave them such admonitions and advice, as ought to be engraved on every heart, <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">SEE his Farewell Address.</NOTE> he left the cabinet with a renown, equalled only by that, with which he had before quitted the field!</P>
<P>DESTINED to be necessary and beneficial to the multitude of his brethren, even to the last, it was not long before he was again placed between them and impending danger.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="037438_0010_100D42DB32297228"/>THE disgraceful and bloody contests of Europe began to bear a threatening aspect on the well-being of the United States; and there was an alarming prospect, through the rapacious ambition of unprin∣cipled tyrants, that, instead of adhering to that im∣partial neutrality, which had been wisely recom∣mended and adopted, we should be driven to arms, in defence of our dearest rights. In these perilous circumstances, who so proper to defeat the machina∣tions, and repel the assaults of our enemies, as <HI>He,</HI> who, under God, had given us our national exist∣ence? To him, therefore, our worthy President di∣rected his thoughts, and judiciously nominated him Generalissimo of the American forces.</P>
<P>THOUGH grown old in the service of his country, and having a claim, on this account, to rest and re∣pose, for the remainder of his days; yet the revered patriot, in the style of his accustomed magnanimity, consented to fill the important, laborious, and haz∣ardous station. His bare acceptance of this trust has doubtless been attended with the most salutary effects. Known and venerated, as he was, in every part of the civilized world, who could question the justice, and the ultimate success of a cause, which so great and so good a man had voluntarily espoused? That power, from which, at the eventful moment, we had most to apprehend, had witnessed his military skill, and the unbounded affection and confidence, which the people at large cherished towards him. When, therefore, its leaders beheld him entrusted with the
<PB N="14" REF="037438_0011_100D42DCC292E7B0"/>
conduct of our troops, and observed the promptitude and spirit with which our defensive arrangements were made, is it not probable, to say no more, that this spectacle, so contrary to their avowed expecta∣tions and sentiments, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">SEE the dispatches of our first envoys to France: in which it is more than intimated, that the French rulers believed the people of the United States detached from their government; and that so great a portion of our citizens were in their interests, that it would be dangerous, if not impracticable, for Congress to resist or counteract their designs.</NOTE> gave rise to their subsequent policy in refraining from menaces and insults, and taking a more pliable and pacific tone? Hence, we are authorized to believe, that, by his declared readi∣ness to come forward for the purpose, when occasion should require, he has contributed, even in retire∣ment, to our safety and deliverance. As the guar∣dian and watchman of the nation, his very attitude filled our foes with dismay, and constrained them to relinquish, or▪ at least, to suspend their hostile designs.</P>
<P>SUCH, O Washington, greatly esteemed in life, and universally lamented in death—Such were the dig∣nity and usefulness of thy character! To thy latest breath thou hast promoted the prosperity and honor of the land which gave thee birth! With what pro∣priety, then, may every true American exclaim, "My father, my father, the chariot of our Israel, and the horsemen thereof!" For no more, alas! shall we enjoy the benefit of thy wisdom in council, or of thy prowess in arms, except by the happy fruits they have produced, and the invigorating influence
<PB N="15" REF="037438_0012_100D42DEF397B7C8"/>
of their recollection! Adieu, therefore, venerable shade—Adieu, till the heavens be no more! Re∣ceive, in the regions of immortality, that recompense of thy labours for the good of mankind, which earth could not confer! "Though dead, thou yet speak∣est;" and never, never may thy country ungrate∣fully forget thy distinguished services and virtues! Never may she forfeit that independence and glory, which, under the direction of an indulgent provi∣dence, thou hast procured for her; that providence, the superintendency and blessing of which thou hast constantly and devoutly recognised, as the origin of all thy brilliant achievements! May thy mantle fall upon many, and may a portion of thy spirit be dif∣fused through all classes of thy surviving countrymen!</P>
<P>I AM, now, to improve the subject by pointing out the proper uses to be made of this afflictive be∣reavement.</P>
<P>A CRISIS, when the abilities and exertions of emi∣nent men were more necessary to the preservation of her sovereignty and peace, America has never seen. At this crisis, therefore, to be deprived of <HI>one,</HI> who has been so invariably, and so conspicuously useful to us, is a manifest token of the divine displeasure at our sins, and calls loudly upon us to lie low in the dust before that God, from whom we have revolted. Let us, then, lay it seriously to heart, and submis∣sively inquire, "wherefore it is that the Lord hath this controversy with us?" A general reformation
<PB N="16" REF="037438_0013_100D42E24769CBF0"/>
is, certainly, desirable, expedient, and necessary.— Such a reformation, nevertheless, cannot be effected, but by the amendment of individuals; for, of indi∣viduals the community is composed. Under this impression, let each one critically examine the pre∣vailing tenor of his desires and pursuits, and compare it with the rule of his duty, in relation both to God and man. However contracted the sphere, in which we move, it is in our power, either to counteract, or to advance the commonweal. Indeed, one or the other of these must be the perpetual result of all our actions. Taught, therefore, both by reason and scripture, that "as righteousness exalteth a nation, so sin is the reproach of any people," let us studiously avoid transgression, and "abstain from the very ap∣pearance of evil." First of all, let us cultivate the profoundest reverence for the authority of Jehovah; and under the influence of this corrective and com∣manding principle, let us pay a constant and consci∣entious attention to all the intimations of his will. Not content with mere pretensions to piety, moral∣ity, or patriotism, let us investigate the nature and extent of these obligations, and from christian mo∣tives, display a cheerful and unreserved conformity to them, in the whole series of our deportment.</P>
<P>I KNOW it has been alleged by some infidel writers, that the gospel no where enjoins the love of our country. But this allegation I conceive to be un∣founded. Does not every page of the New-Testa∣ment implicitly inculcate this duty? And does not
<PB N="17" REF="037438_0014_100D42E3D38F9D38"/>
the uniform course of our Saviour's life intelligibly and powerfully recommend it? Who ever prayed more earnestly for the welfare, or wept more sincere∣ly at the misfortunes of his country, than he? Did he discover no appropriate attachment to it, when he made its inhabitants the first offers of his religion; and when, in defiance of the most cruel persecutions, and with the certain prospect of the most ignomin∣ious death, he persisted in his endeavours to promote their virtue and felicity?</P>
<P>SHALL we, then, extol those pagan worthies, who, though exiled from their native clime, continued in∣flexible, notwithstanding, in their regard to its inter∣est, and unwearied in their endeavours to increase its honor? Shall we represent them, as instructing all succeeding ages in the noble principles and offices of patriotism? And shall we, in the mean time, refuse an equal, nay, a far superior degree of the same honor to Jesus of Nazareth? No, my brethren, for Jesus of Nazareth was a perfect pattern of this, as well as of every other excellence. This, therefore, is incumbent upon us, not only as citizens, but as Christians. We are especially urged to it by the critical situation, into which we are thrown by the loss we now deplore. Bereft of the counsel and guidance of him, who has been so long and so exten∣sively viewed as our safeguard and defence, will not those, who seek our hurt, be emboldened to redouble their arts and intrigues, to facilitate and hasten our ruin? And are we not furnished, by this apprehen∣sion,
<PB N="18" REF="037438_0015_100D42E65120D3A0"/>
with the strongest arguments for union, firm∣ness, and public spirit among ourselves?</P>
<P>HAPPY for us, while the departure of our beloved Chief admonishes us of the <HI>importance,</HI> his example clearly teaches us the <HI>nature</HI> of the patriotic affec∣tions: thrice happy, if we be disposed to walk in his steps! The system of his politics was pacific, and yet dignified and consistent. Perseverance in such a system, alike independent of every foreign power, and of all foreign interference, is manifestly requisite to save us from national degradation. Nor let any imagine, because he is incapable of contributing, like him, to its adoption and prevalence, that, therefore, he has nothing to do in so good a cause. Every man has his influence in society; and every man is bound to exert it, not by sowing the seeds of dissention and jealousy; not by indulging party feelings and de∣signs; not by obstructing the measures of govern∣ment, or calumniating the characters of those who administer it. These are the ebullitions of disap∣pointed ambition, which grasps at every place of honor and emolument, and would sacrifice an empire at the shrine of pride and avarice! Such were nei∣ther the temper, nor the practice of WASHINGTON. He was not eager for promotion; and when it was forced upon him by the united voice of the people, he was apparently induced to accept it, not so much by the impulse of inclination, as by the dictates of conscience. He was willing to serve his country in any station, to which she called him; and to his im∣mortal
<PB N="19" REF="037438_0016_100D42E8A1264848"/>
honor be it remembered, the rank which he held at his death, was a voluntary descent from his former exaltation! It is equally incumbent upon us all, to aim rather at usefulness, than distinction; and, satisfied with the post which nature and the public have assigned us, to discharge, with fidelity, the va∣rious duties it imposes; and contribute, though it be but a single mite, to the harmony, order, and sta∣bility of the great whole. To this end, we are visi∣bly obliged, without conferring with self, or selfish men, to make the general good the rule of our de∣cisions and actions. Deaf to the importunities of clamorous seekers, (for such are of all mankind the most unqualified to rule), we should countenance none, either by our conversation, or our suffrages, but those whom we believe, in our hearts, both ca∣pable and desirous of rendering service to the nation.</P>
<P>WHEN, by these means, we have done our utmost to place integrity and talents in the administration, it is no less our duty to "strengthen the hands, and encourage the hearts" of our rulers, not only by a personal submission to the laws; but by inducing others, as far as in us lies, to "lead quiet and peace∣able lives in all godliness and honesty."</P>
<P>COULD these pure intentions, and this laudable conduct, universally prevail, peace at home, and re∣spectability abroad, would be our favoured lot! We might set every adversary at defiance, and trust in God, that, as those illustrious names, who have hith∣erto been our shield and protection, are numbered
<PB N="20" REF="037438_0017_100D42EA9C83DDA0"/>
with the dead, others will be raised up in their stead, to defend our rights, and perpetuate our prosperity!</P>
<P>ANOTHER thought, which the subject and occa∣sion jointly suggest, while it additionally enforces the preceding obligation, particularly invites us to "lay up in store for ourselves, a good foundation against the time to come."</P>
<P>HAD wealth, had fame, had friends been sufficient to "redeem from death," WASHINGTON had not died! But "there is no discharge in that war!" High and low, learned and ignorant, free and bond, must "lie down alike in the dust: for the small and the great are there!" Such being "the end of all the living," how vain and insignificant, in compari∣son, are the possessions and acquisitions of time; and how infinitely important is a seasonable preparation for eternity! "Let not the wise man, then, glory in his wisdom; neither let the mighty man glory in his might; let not the rich man glory in his riches; but let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he un∣derstandeth and knoweth the Lord!"</P>
<P>OUR chief emulation should be, to "obtain an in∣heritance among all them that are sanctified;" and since "we have no continuing city here, to seek one to come. For the world passeth away, and the lust thereof; but he that doeth the will of God, abideth forever." Soon shall the fierce contentions of king∣doms and states, and the bustling rivalries of indi∣viduals, be superseded by the more awful war of elements, and conflagration of matter! But sooner
<PB N="21" REF="037438_0018_100D42EC9AC90A58"/>
still shall a final period be put to all <HI>our</HI> sublunary cares and pursuits! The king of terrors is not far from every one of us! "In such an hour as we think not," we may be summoned into the invisible state, and called to a strict and solemn account for "the deeds done in the body!"</P>
<P>"SEEING then we look for such things," and are apprised of their speedy and certain approach, by the dictates of reason, the declarations of scripture, and the awakening admonitions of providence, "what manner of persons ought we to be, in all holy con∣versation and godliness!" Can we cherish anticipa∣tions of this kind, and yet presume unduly to covet the pleasures, the profits, or the honors of this lower creation? Can we consent, for the sake of these mo∣mentary and perishable attainments, to forfeit the complacency and approbation of Heaven, or to in∣jure the community to which we belong? Let us rather resolve, never to gain the least gratification, or to receive any degree of applause, but as the re∣ward of laudable designs and exertions; designs and exertions, at once, acceptable to God, and service∣able to man.</P>
<P>IF, in this way, we rise into public estimation, let us improve our increased influence in the cause of truth and righteousness. But if, after all, it be our fate to remain in the humbler walks of life, let us not repine at the divine ordination; but exercise a pious resignation and obedience to the will of our Maker, and strive, even in the narrow circle by which we
<PB N="22" REF="037438_0019_100D42EEC835F590"/>
are circumscribed, to mitigate the ills, and enhance the enjoyments of humanity.—In any event, whether in affluence, or in poverty; whether "in good report, or in evil report," let us "serve God and our generation" faithfully; hold ourselves in habitual readiness for our last change, and "give all diligence to make our calling and election sure. If we do these things, we shall never fall: for so an entrance shall be ministered to us abundantly, into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ."</P>
