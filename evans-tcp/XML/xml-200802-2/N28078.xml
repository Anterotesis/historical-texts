<P><HI>THE flattering testimony of esteem, which you have shown me, in re∣questing for the press a copy of my Discourse, delivered on occasion of the Death of our late much beloved President, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, aside from the view, which I may have of the institution itself, a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> remembrance. To bestow flattering encomiums, becomes the character, which I ought to sus∣tain, as little, as to pass unmerited censure; and, it is, really, a gratify∣ing consideration, that my plainness of speech has not given offence.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Amidst the numerous and well digested compositions, which this occa∣sion will present to the public, I am persuaded, that the publication of my Discourse, will neither do honor to myself, nor add celebrity to its pat∣rons. Willing, however, to gratify your wishes, and to contribute my mite, towards perpetuating the memory of our beloved President, I shall not refuse a copy.</HI></P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE conduct of man towards his fellow creatures in different circumstances, not only affords a curious subject for specu∣lations but, if carefully traced out, would be found fully to develope the principles of human action. The circumstances, in which mankind are providentially placed, rather than the characters they sustain, seem to be the crite∣rion, by which is determined the degree of respect, that shall be paid them. Hence, real worth, if cloth∣ed in rags, must live and die in obscurity; while gaudy attire, and high sounding titles procure for many a worthless person, a tribute of respect, which is due to the virtuous only. For this cause, among others, did Solomon inscribe on all the pursuits of human life, "vanity of vanities." And to place the subject in a striking light, he sets before us a familiar example, expressed in the plain, unadorned language
<PB N="4" REF="037427_0004_100D40E85619A378"/>
of inspiration. "There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it. Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city;" but mark the returns which he received: "<HI>Yet no man remembered that same poor man.</HI>" Incapable through poverty of flattering their pride by a splendid equipage, or grat∣ifying their appetites by sumptuous entertainments, his good deeds are forgotten, he must retire to his former obscurity, and have the mortification of ex∣periencing the ingratitude of a people, whom he had saved from destruction.</P>
<P>Were mankind universally disposed to render to each other that tribute, which gratitude requires, the circumstances, in which persons might be placed, would make no alteration as to the respect, which would be paid them: A real benefactor, whether he were found among the rich or the poor, the high or the low, would ever receive the tribute of a grateful remembrance. This concise narrative, therefore, virtually contains this charge against mankind, that they are not naturally inclined to remember their benefactors, as they ought to remember them.</P>
<P>To illustrate this general proposition, we shall first say how a benefactor should be remembered; and then offer some considerations to show, that mankind are not naturally inclined thus to remember them.</P>
<P>1. We are to say how a benefactor should be re∣membered. Barely mentioning such expressions as these; <HI>remember the poor; remember thy Creator,</HI> is sufficient to convince any person, that the term <HI>re∣member</HI> often includes more, than merely retaining in
<PB N="5" REF="037427_0005_100D40E9E33824D0"/>
the mind an idea of the thing remembered. He, that says to the hungry, <HI>be ye fed,</HI> or to the naked, <HI>be ye clothed,</HI> does more than merely retain in his mind an idea of their necessities, and yet, his conduct falls short of what is implied in remembering the poor. In all cases, it is necessary, that <HI>works</HI> bear testimony to the truth of our assertions, and therefore, by works, as well as by words or thoughts must we remember a benefactor.</P>
<P N="1">1. We should remember our benefactors by doing them good. That command, which bids us "pray for those that hate us, and do good unto those, that despitefully use us," doubtless requires, that we do good unto those, that do good unto us. This is what the law of benevolence requires; it is what the nat∣ural unenlightened conscience of all mankind teaches them, as their duty. Are our benefactors in necessi∣tous circumstances? we should cheerfully afford them relief, if it be in our power. Are their characters un∣justly aspersed? we should openly espouse their cause, and defend their injured innocence. Do they merit a respectful attention? we should grant it to them in customary forms. And, does their devotedness to our interests claim our confidence! we should spare them the painful sensations, which result from seeing a stranger preferred before them▪ Sensations, which in∣gratitude alone would ever wish to excite. And, though our chief and principal attention is to be paid them, while living, yet the "pale shades of death" have their demands, and the voice of a benefactor calls to us even from the grave. There is something inhuman in the thought of vilifying the memory of the dead, or even, in forbearing to pay some testimo∣ny
<PB N="6" REF="037427_0006_100D40EB72F55D48"/>
of respect to a departed friend. A respectful at∣tention to the deceased, is what every benefactor has a right to expect; it is what humanity requires; it is what that providence, which reminds us of our own approaching dissolution, demands.</P>
<P N="2">2. Our benefactors are to be remembered by an imitation of their benevolent example. The simple idea of a benefactor implies something, that is worthy of imitation. It implies, that an unpurchased good has been conferred: And, whatever may have been the conduct of a benefactor in other respects, it pro∣poses to our imitation, in one instance at least, the example of a benevolent disposition. An example, which gratitude requires, that we ever bear upon our hearts. Are we, therefore, in circumstances, in which we can do good to others, and do it not? we are chargeable with having forgotten the example of our benefactors. Are we able to relieve the distressed, to supply what is lacking in the circumstances of the needy, and to cheer with the soothings of friendship the disconsolate sufferer, and do it not? each bene∣faction, which we have received, reproaches us with the forgetfulness of ingratitude. Are we capable of doing good to public bodies—to societies—to our country, and do it not? those, who have devoted themselves to the service of their country, those, who have "jeoparded their lives in the high places of the field," and the blood, which has been shed, in defend∣ing the rights of mankind, rise up against us, and re∣sent the neglect, as a fruit of the basest ingratitude.</P>
<P N="3">3. Our benefactors are to be remembered by be∣ing considered and received as a gift from God. It is not sufficient, that we trace the streams of benefi∣cence,
<PB N="7" REF="037427_0007_100D40EE06671D48"/>
which are flowing to us in many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, to their immediate sources, and render due <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a fellow creature; we should follow them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their ul∣timate source, and learn to adore that divine good∣ness, which animates all nature, and demands, from the united tongues of created intelligences, a tribute of thankful praise. It is God, we are told, that forms the spirit of man within him, that gives a benevolent disposition, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d an ability to exert it: It is God, that prepares the heart, that moves the disposition, and prompts to action: And, it is God, that directs the steps of man, and enables him to put his benevolent intentions into execution. The whole process, there∣fore, originates ultimately in divine goodness; and, while we forget, that this is the case, or neglect to acknowledge it by an affectionate attachment to the service of our Maker, we do not remember, in their true character, those, who have been made the instru∣ments of divine goodness to us, and are not in a suit∣able situation to render them those constant returns of gratitude, which they have deserved. While we forget <HI>even in our hearts,</HI> that there is a God, on whom our benefactors are entirely dependent, we as∣sign to them, in a certain sense, the rank of Gods, and when we find them incapable of supporting that station in the scale of being, to which we in an idola∣trous manner have exalted them, we are generally ready, not only to pull them down, but even to tear from their brows the laurels, which they really de∣serve to wear.</P>
<P>Upon this idea, I would wish to be indulged the liberty of dwelling for a moment, as it not only shows the importance of religion to those, who have deserv∣ed
<PB N="8" REF="037427_0008_100D40F1233F9710"/>
well of their country, but also as it points out a considerable source of that complaint and calumny, which is often cast upon the administration of civil government. While we, from a principle of religion, which governs our <HI>feelings</HI> as well as our <HI>belief,</HI> ascribe the success, which attends the plans of a General, or a Politician, to the goodness of an over-ruling Provi∣dence, and revere the men, who have been our ben∣efactors, as instruments in the hands of God, we as∣sign them the place, that belongs to them; we give them just the praise, that is their due, and, upon a reverse of fortune, should not find ourselves greatly disposed to load them in an ungrateful manner, with unmerited calumny. The thought, that they are but instruments in the hands of a holy and wise God, will forbid every complaint, and be a powerful check against ascribing their want of success to a want of benevolence. On the contrary, while we forget, that there is an over-ruling hand in all these events, and ascribe the benefit received almost wholly to the wis∣dom and goodness of the immediate agent, we shall be ready, upon every unfavorable occurrence, to sus∣pect, that he has not exerted himself as he might have done, or, that, under the influence of some sinister motive, he is disposed to neglect our good, or to make us the victims of his own ambition or revenge. And by such a thought we at once blast his well-earned laurels, and rob him entirely of the tribute of a thank∣ful heart, which his conduct has deserved. By ascrib∣ing too much to our benefactors, in the instances, in which they have done us good, we are naturally led to demand too much of them in future, and, if our expectations are not equalled, we are strongly inclined
<PB N="9" REF="037427_0009_100D40F2ADAEE2A0"/>
to load them with curses, and to forget, that we ever owed them any returns of gratitude. So long, therefore, as the course of human affairs is variable, so long as pure religion does not warm the hearts of mankind in general, so long the wisest, and most faith∣ful administrators of public affairs have no reason but to expect, that their administration will at times be censured in an ungrateful manner. However grati∣fying, of course, it may be to the vanity of the hu∣man heart to have its successes attributed wholly to itself, to the exclusion of divine Providence, it is in fact putting it into a situation, that is incompatible with that steady, persevering respect, which gratitude demands. It is, therefore, the spirit of religion only, that places our benefactors in their true light, and secures to them a continuance of that attention and confidence, which their benevolent conduct has mer∣ited; and of course, where true religion is wanting, it is impossible, that there should be that remem∣brance of a benefactor, which there ought to be.</P>
<P>Having thus shown how a benefactor should be re∣membered, we proceed</P>
<P>II. To offer some considerations to prove, that mankind are not naturally inclined thus to remem∣ber them.</P>
<P>It is a painful task to draw the dark side of the hu∣man character, and point out those detestable princi∣ples, by which the human heart is often actuated. It is necessary, however, that it should at times be done. Our divine Redeemer, whose compassionate soul could weep at the follies and sins of an apostate world, was much employed in unfolding the human heart, and in exposing the hypocrisy and wickedness,
<PB N="10" REF="037427_0010_100D40F5F34C2FD8"/>
to which it is often abandoned. And, in following his example as a public teacher, it is frequently nec∣essary, that we lay aside the language of palliation, that we strip off the disguise of external appearance, and expose in all their deformity, the worst principles by which the human heart is actuated.</P>
<P>It may, perhaps, be thought, that forgetfulness of benefactors is no very prominent feature in the hu∣man character; and, that in this, they err less, than in many other respects. A regard, however, for truth, and a belief in the justness of sacred represen∣tations, bids me assert, that such an opinion is not well founded; and, we presume, that a careful re∣view of the conduct of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> will fully justify the assertion.</P>
<P>In support of this, let the following things be no∣ticed.</P>
<P N="1">1. In the human character there is a great degree of selfishness. The numerous commands, which are found in the word of God, <HI>to love our neighbors, and to look on the things of others,</HI> as well as the more posi∣tive declarations, that <HI>all seek their own things,</HI> are a sufficient proof, that selfishness is deeply rooted in the human heart. And, in support of this painful truth, may we not appeal to that conduct, which generally characterizes the different classes of mankind? Is it not selfishness, that lies at the foundation of a desire for property, and which suggests to busy seekers that variety of methods, which are adopted for its attain∣ment? Is it not selfishness, that stimulates to exces∣sive indulgence, those, who sacrifice at the altar of sensual intemperance? Is it not selfishness, that nour∣ishes the dissocial passions of anger, envy and re∣venge,
<PB N="11" REF="037427_0011_100D40F787348738"/>
from which a conduct shocking to humanity often proceeds? Is it not selfishness, that excites am∣bitious desires, that supplies an heroic courage, and that often prompts to actions called great and noble? Is it not selfishness, that leads many in the paths of morality, while pride or ambition only curb the im∣pure desires which rankle in their hearts? Is it not selfishness, that leads us almost to adore a truly great and conspicuous character, whose virtues may flatter the vanity of his admirers, while a poor benefactor, from whom no such advantage is to be derived, is neglected and forgotten? And, is it not owing to the prevalence of the same disposition, that com∣plaints, rebellions and revolutions are much more frequently attempted under a mild and peaceable ad∣ministration, from which little is to be dreaded, than under one, that is more severe? And when these things are considered, is it possible not to believe, that mankind are naturally selfish, and of course, that they are not naturally inclined to render to their benefac∣tors that, which is their due? To some, it is true, we may be ready to make suitable returns, because in some circumstances, such a conduct would accord with the selfish feelings of the heart; but, so long as there is one benefactor unnoticed or unrewarded by us, let his circumstances be what they may, so long we claim in vain the possession of a thankful disposi∣tion. While, therefore, the evidence, that selfishness prevails to so great a degree in the human heart, is so complete, we cannot believe, that a real disposition to remember benefactors, prevails there also.</P>
<P N="2">2. Mankind are naturally attached to certain sys∣tems, and divide themselves into certain parties, with∣in
<PB N="12" REF="037427_0012_100D40FA59AD1AD8"/>
the limits of which their benevolence is generally confined. There is scarcely any subject, in which mankind are generally interested, respecting which they are not divided. And the effects of such divis∣ions are almost invariably inconsistent with that im∣partial regard, which public benefactors have a right to expect. In religion, the friends of certain senti∣ments class themselves together, imbibe a peculiar re∣gard for each other, and will generally extol the vir∣tues, and endeavor to exalt as much as possible, the reputation of their own denomination; while those, who have embraced a different system of faith, are greatly disregarded, and their virtues treated with pe∣culiar coldness. In politics, the effects of party spirit are not less evident, nor are the different parties in any respect more just in their comparative representations of each other. In social life, the distinction of fash∣ionable and vulgar is chargeable with the same con∣sequences, though on a smaller scale. And, may I not add, that particular societies, not excepting even those, which are professedly founded on the princi∣ples of benevolence, are not free from party attach∣ment, or from its unhappy consequences. A public benefactor, therefore, can only expect, that his mer∣its will be duly appreciated, and rewarded by those of his own party, and need not be surprised, should he, from others receive the coldness of inattention, or the more painful effects of unjust suspicion or ma∣licious calumny.</P>
<P N="3">3. This painful truth is further evident from that general neglect of religion, which prevails among mankind. When we consider, that all things here below are the workmanship of a God, and that all
<PB N="13" REF="037427_0013_100D40FCA24963B8"/>
events are under a superintending Providence, we can∣not but <HI>believe,</HI> whatever we may <HI>feel,</HI> that "every good and perfect gift cometh down from the Father of Lights." And, when this is considered, would it be possible, if we were possessed of a right disposition, for us to forget our maker? Would it be possible for us not to notice in a most thankful manner the hand, that supports, defends, and nourishes us from day to day? The fact, however, is certain: We do forget our heavenly benefactor: We do conduct toward him in a most ungrateful manner. Instead of reverential expressions, his ears are often assailed with the lan∣guage of profaneness and blasphemy. Instead of a just sense of dependence, and a thankful acknowledg∣ment for favors, he hears a vainglorious boasting in language like this, "by the strength of my hands I have done it, and by my wisdom, for I am prudent." Instead of confidence in God, and a cordial reliance upon his grace through a crucified Savior, he sees little but a presumptuous resting on an arm of flesh. And, instead of a cordial obedience to his commands, he beholds every where the most evident tokens of a most unnatural rebellion. Such are the natural feel∣ings of the human heart, and at such a distance is it from the exercise of that religion, the first precept, of which is, "thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart." Now, if this be the case, where is the evidence, that mankind are naturally just to their benefactors? Why is it, that their first and greatest benefactor is totally disregarded? Or, can they be supposed to possess a principle of justice even to their fellow creatures, while they are so evidently unjust to their Creator?</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="037427_0014_100D40FE395B6538"/>
We may, therefore, assume it as an undoubted truth, that mankind have not naturally within them, that disposition, which is implied in remembering a benefactor: A truth, which we ought to lament, and for which it becomes us to be deeply humbled before a holy, and a righteous God. It is a truth, which ought to be most sensibly impressed upon our minds this day, lest, while we are attempting to do justice to the memory of one, who was raised up in divine Providence for our good, we are found want∣ing in the most essential part of our duty.</P>
<P>While we are endeavoring to realize and improve that afflictive Providence, which has this day called us together, we may doubtless be allowed to adopt the language of inspiration, and say, "truly a great man is fallen in our Israel." Whether we consider him in public or in private life; in the field, in the cabinet, or in the domestic circle, he appears equal∣ly the great man—the conspicuous character. His cool unshaken courage, while encountering a supe∣rior foe; his address in supplying a want of the means of defence, and in securing the confidence of his country amidst complicated disasters; his ani∣mated zeal, which could transform a small undisci∣plined band of men into a formidable army; the plans, which he concerted, and by which he was en∣abled to free our land from a powerful invasion; his coolness and deliberation in council; his readiness to listen to advice, coming from whatever quarter it might; his ardent love of liberty, and his zealous attachment to the cause of his country, all declare, that he was raised up for the time and place, in which he lived, and that he was particularly fitted for the
<PB N="15" REF="037427_0015_100D4100950D53F8"/>
important part, which he acted upon the public thea∣tre of life. And when to this portrait of his public character, we add the virtues, that adorned the man; his amiable disposition; his love of industry and or∣der; his freedom from vice of every description; his attachment to the arts of civilized life; his rev∣erence for the name of God; and his uniform re∣gard for religion, we behold one of the most finished characters, which the higher sphere of life has ever produced: We behold one who, as we trust, was truly wise; one, who to us was highly useful; and one, who will ever demand our grateful remembrance.</P>
<P>While he was living, there were not wanting num∣bers, who duly appreciated his merits, and who uni∣formly paid him that tribute of respect and confidence, which was his due. Did suspicion attack the purity of his intentions? Numbers were found, who readily stepped forward and espoused his cause. Did partyism misrepresent the measures, which he adopted? Num∣bers were found, who readily justified them, and ex∣posed the insidious designs of his opposers. Did en∣vy industriously strive to blacken his character, and prejudice the minds of his countrymen against him? Numbers were found, who met such attempts with a becoming resentment, and supported with a grateful firmness, both his character and the measures of his administration. Though some few may be chargea∣ble with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>hankful neglect, yet the unanimity, with which the highest and most dignified office in the be∣stowment of his country was successively conferred upon him, and the unaffected testimonials of sorrow, which his death has fixed upon every countenance, clearly evince, that the great body of the people are
<PB N="16" REF="037427_0016_100D410301E375A0"/>
free from such a charge. But, have we remembered him with that disposition, which real gratitude im∣plies? WASHINGTON was born in the higher sphere of life; he was ever a conspicuous and dignified char∣acter, and it has long been our glory, that we have duly noticed and rewarded his merits. But, while our minds are, as it were, dazzled by the splendors of this great man, may it not be, that there is some "poor, wise man," who as really claims our grati∣tude, though not to the same degree, but, who is now suffering the pain and mortification of unmerited ne∣glect? If there is such a character thus neglected by us, WASHINGTON himself feels the neglect; for, it proves, that the respect, which we have shown to him, arises rather from the lustre, which his greatness re∣flects upon ourselves, than from a really grateful disposition.</P>
<P>The virtues of our WASHINGTON are also to be imitated, or we do but poorly requite the good, which he has done for us. And in this view there is much, that claims our attention. When called by the voice of his country to defend her insulted rights; his ready obedience, entering the field with scarcely a distant prospect of success, devoting himself entirely to the good of his country, and uniformly refusing any conpensation for his numerous and painful ser∣vices, evinced the benevolence of his disposition, and says unto us, <HI>go ye and do likewise.</HI> Amidst the tu∣mults, irregularities and temptations of war, the uni∣formity of his temper, the propriety of his conduct, and the frowns with which he invariable and severe∣ly checked every species of profaneness, intemperance and dissoluteness of manners, attest both the purity,
<PB N="17" REF="037427_0017_100D410601F7FB88"/>
and firmness of his heart, and say unto us, <HI>go ye and do likewise.</HI> In the dignified station of President, his attachment to the principles of union, to the harmo∣ny of jarring parties, which must ever exist in a land, where freedom of thought and speech is the boast of each individual, and to a system of neutrality amidst the disturbances of Europe, clearly indicate an ardent love of his country, and say unto us, though acting in a humbler sphere, <HI>go ye and do likewise.</HI> In leaving the arduous task of government, in descending vol∣untarily to the rank of a private citizen, and in sub∣mitting, without any kind of indignant resentment, to be chosen to some of the lowest offices of civil gov∣ernment, he evinced such an uncommon greatness or magnanimity of mind, as is of itself superior to grades or distinctions of honor, and thereby says unto us, <HI>go ye and do likewise.</HI> In private life, the delicate at∣tachment, which he showed to his companion; the tenderness, with which he treated his domestics; the gravity and moral purity of his deportment; the at∣tention, which he paid to the arts of civilized life, and to useful industry; and the uniform regard, which he discovered for the religion of his forefa∣thers, form a most beautiful character, and say unto us, in a manner peculiarly persuasive, <HI>go ye and do likewise.</HI> Though like us, he was but man, and though at certain times the imperfections of human∣ity might be visible in his conduct, yet there was cer∣tainly much in him, that we may well remember by a careful imitation. And if we do it not, whatever may be the testimonials of our grief and respect up∣on this occasion, we do but, in fact, insult the mem∣ory of this truly great and virtuous man.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="037427_0018_100D41085D3BA868"/>
But while we are endeavoring to remember in a grateful manner, the good deeds, which he has done for his country, we should be careful not to forget, that all is to be considered as a gift from God. Up∣on a subject like this, we are perhaps in danger of ascribing too much to the instrument, and of paying to that a kind of idolatrous homage, while we almost forget the Great, the Wise Disposer of all human e∣vents. It ought ever to be deeply impressed upon our minds, that, whatever may be ascribed to our benefactors, the glory should ultimately redound to that God, who gave them to us. We should never forget, that it was God, that raised up to us a WASH∣INGTON, and qualified him for the important part, which he was called to act. We should never forget, that it was God, that disposed him to step forth in defence of his country's rights; that endowed him with a cool and steady courage in the day of battle; that gave him persevering firmness in the midst of disasters and gloomy prospects; that concerted his plans; that fought his battles; that bid him con∣quer; and made him, in a political sense, the father of his country. We should never forget, that, what∣ever is due to the illustrious man, the glory of his whole life must be ascribed to that invisible hand, that gave, that made him useful, and that has again taken him away.</P>
<P>Permit me now, in applying the subject more im∣mediately to ourselves, to ask, whether, considering the things, which have been said, we have not reason to look within ourselves, and to blush for the degen∣eracy of our hearts? Can we say amidst all the re∣spect, which we have shewn him; amidst all the con∣fidence,
<PB N="19" REF="037427_0019_100D410AC5C35F50"/>
that we have reposed in him; and amidst all the testimonials of grief, which his death has oc∣casioned, that we have really possessed those feelings, which are implied in remembering a benefactor? Can we say, that we have uniformly imitated his example, and ascribed his merits and usefulness to the good∣ness of an over-ruling Providence? Can we say, that our hearts like his, have been filled with a love of vir∣tue for virtue's sake; and that the sincerity of our re∣ligion testifies, that we are not unmindful of our divine benefactor? Have we not, on the contrary, reason to mourn, and should not this day be to us a day of sor∣row, a day of deep humiliation and repentance be∣fore that God, whom we have almost uniformly slighted? And does not that solemn providence, which has this day called us together, and which teaches us, that no qualifications, no character, nor no situa∣tion is a preservative from the grave, urge upon us this duty, in a manner peculiarly forcible?</P>
<P>The circumstances of this day's meeting, and the objects which I behold, admonish me, that, before I close, some particular addresses will be expected. My first attention is due to that society, which, without any knowledge of the intentions of our Supreme Ex∣ecutive, has made choice of this day, to manifest their participation in the general sorrow, which now per∣vades our land.</P>
<P>GENTLEMEN,</P>
<P>I SHALL not take this opportunity either to jus∣tify, or to condemn the principles of your institution, not even so far as they are submitted to public in∣spection. An object of more importance and solem∣nity
<PB N="20" REF="037427_0020_100D410D9AE51608"/>
demands our attention. A tribute of gratitude is due to the memory of our beloved WASHINGTON; and still more, to that God, who in goodness has fa∣vored us with such a gift. While that afflictive Prov∣idence, which has taken from you an illustrious broth∣er, and from our country a faithful parent, bids our tears to flow, it is our duty, not only to submit to the hand of God, but to endeavor to improve in the best possible manner, this distressing dispensation.</P>
<P>It is not to be denied, that the institution of Mason∣ry receives a real lustre from the name of WASHING∣TON. It is your part, on the contrary, to see, that the institution does not eventually prove a disgrace to him. How much soever you may pride yourselves in his virtues, it is still a truth, which you ought to feel, that the nature and tendency of your institution will be judged of, in part, by the characters, which you sustain. If, therefore, while you boast of a fra∣ternal connection, you should be guilty of bringing a stigma upon the institution, and, in that way, of insulting his memory with a conduct, at which he himself would blush, how could you answer it to his injured virtues? If, from your mouths the lan∣guage of profaneness should often be heard; if your social meetings should be devoted to bacchanali∣an revels; if they should be prostituted to the base purposes of political intrigue, if your names should be enrolled among the dissolute disturbers of do∣mestic felicity; if you should be found favoring each other at the expense of the rights of your fellow cit∣izens; if, in fine, there should be in you an apparent contempt of the cross of our divine Redeemer, with what propriety could you be considered as the breth∣ren
<PB N="21" REF="037427_0021_100D410F27EB40E8"/>
of one whose life was purity itself, and who ever discovered a serious regard to the institutions of our holy religion? Or, if you must be thus considered, will not the character of your illustrious brother suffer from the connection? Should such characters as these be indulged amongst you, you may possibly think, that the reputation of Masonry is safe, while shielded by the virtues of an illustrious brother. But, can you offer such an affront to humanity, as to demand, that the <HI>virtues of the dead</HI> be made to pro∣tect the <HI>vices of the living?</HI></P>
<P>Do not indulge a thought, that these things are spoken with a view to reproach your society, or to depreciate the institution in the view of your fellow citizens. Receive them rather as testimonials of re∣gard for the memory of our common defender, and as proofs of a real desire to have the respectability and usefulness of your order supported. Flattering enco∣miums are here useless: For, you cannot be insensi∣ble, that while the veil of concealment is industrious∣ly thrown over your peculiar concerns, suspicion will be watching you in the most critical manner; that every action and word will be severely scrutinized, and that the character and tendency of your institu∣tion will be judged of, rather by the character of the individuals, who compose it, than by any thing, that may be said respecting it. And, if in an unguarded hour you should be left to reproach the character of that august personage, on whose account you exhib∣it those badges of mourning, at your hands, doubt∣less, will his country require it.</P>
<P>The solemnities of this day, the precepts of benev∣olence, the demands of gratitude, and the rights of
<PB N="22" REF="037427_0022_100D4110E7525478"/>
humanity, all require, that you take heed to your∣selves. And, while pressing these things upon you▪ I can, most cordially, recommend to your imitation the example of that illustrious brother whose death you now lament: And, will assure you, that, if you make him your constant pattern, and study to walk in his footsteps, your institution will not only be con∣sidered as useful, but will even command the respect∣ful attention of your country. Let, therefore, his venerable image be ever present to your minds; let a remembrance of his virtues be a check upon the first sallies of every impure, every unsuitable desire, and, under a sense of your dependence, let your knees be bent in humble adoration at the throne of grace, while you supplicate that divine assistance, which a∣lone can lead you in the paths of virtuous usefulness, and of religious improvement.</P>
<P>Beholding in this assembly a respectable number, who are not included in that society, which we have just been addressing, but who are equally interested in the solemnities of this day, I shall not be excused, should I pass them by in silence.</P>
<P>I do not doubt, my friends, that you really parti∣cipate in the sorrows of this mournful occasion, and that you are animated with an ardent desire to testify your respect for the memory of that great man, who has fallen. And, while you are mingling your tears with those of your country, over the tomb of your beloved chief, let them not be the tears of bereaved affection merely, let them be the tears of deep re∣pentance—the tears of returning gratitude.</P>
<P>Before you I have endeavored to discuss an impor∣tant subject, and to lead your minds, into what ap∣pears
<PB N="23" REF="037427_0023_100D4112B6037BF0"/>
to me, to be the path of duty. May the spirit of divine grace make it effectual to your hearts; That you have been wanting in returns of gratitude to this truly useful man, I would, by no means, be thought to suggest. Whatever may have been the case with others, I shall be justified in asserting, that, notwithstanding the calumnies raised against his ad∣ministration, and the arts, which have been used to prejudice him in your minds, your confidence has ever remained unshaken; you have uniformly reject∣ed with a becoming resentment the aspersions cast upon his character, and it has long been your glory, that you were the friends of your country's chief defender. But, can I say, that you have done all, that duty requires? Can I say, that suitable returns of gratitude have been rendered to that God, who gave you a WASHINGTON to sight your battles, to guide your councils, to teach you how to live, and again, to teach you how to die? If I find that, which I can commend, do I not also find that, which I must in faithfulness censure? And, may I not be allowed to improve the solemn objects, which this occasion pre∣sents, with a view to the interests of your immortal souls? Transport yourselves for a moment to the tomb of your beloved chief, and imagine, that you hear his departed spirit addressing you in language like this: <Q>I have past the gloomy portals of the grave: Do you prepare to pass them also. I have passed them with composure and serenity of mind, because my life was virtuous, and my conduct useful: Do you prepare to pass them thus, by walking in the path, which my footsteps have marked. I have passed them with the glow of
<PB N="24" REF="037427_0024_100D4116B1F8D8C0"/>
hope, because I confided in God, and trusted in a crucified Savior: Do you prepare to pass them thus, by subjecting every thought, and every feeling to the revealed will of your holy Sovereign. I have met my God, my final Judge in the world of spir∣its: Do you prepare to meet him there also, for meet him you must, either in mercy or in anger.</Q></P>
