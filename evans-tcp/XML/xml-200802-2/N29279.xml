<HEAD>THE WILL, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<HEAD>IN THE NAME OF GOD, AMEN.</HEAD>
<P>I GEORGE WASHINGTON, of MOUNT VERNON, a CITIZEN of the <HI>United States,</HI> and lately <HI>President</HI> of the same. DO make, ordain, and declare this Instrument, which is written with my own hand,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the original manuscript, GEORGE WASHINGTON'S name was written at the bottom of every page.</NOTE> and every page thereof subscribed with my Name, to be my last WILL and TESTAMENT, revoking all others.—<HI>Imprimus.</HI> All my debts, of which there are but few, and none of magnitude, are to be punctually and speedily paid, and the Legacies herein after bequeathed, are to be discharged as soon as circumstances will permit, and in the manner directed.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI>—To my dearly beloved Wife, <HI>Martha Washington,</HI> I give and bequeath the use, profit and benefit of my whole Es∣tate, real and personal, for the term of her natural life, except such parts thereof as are specially disposed of hereafter.—My improved Lot, in the town of Alexandria, situated on Pitt and Cameron streets, I give to her and her heirs forever; as I also do my Household and Kitchen Furniture, of every sort and kind, with the Liquors and Groceries which may be on hand at the time of my decease, to be used and disposed of as she may think proper.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI>—Upon the decease of my wife, it is my will and desire that all the Slaves which I hold in my <HI>own right</HI> shall receive their freedom. To emancipate them during her life, would, though earnestly wished by me, be attended with such insupera∣ble difficulties, on account of their intermixture by marriages with the dower Negroes, as to excite the most painful sensations, if not disagreeable consequences from the latter, while both de∣scriptions are in the occupancy of the same proprietor; it not being in my power, under the tenure by which the dower Ne∣groes
<PB N="4" REF="038994_0003_10128B3CC1F51D28"/>
are held, to manumit them. <HI>And whereas,</HI> among those who will receive freedom according to this devise, there may be some, who from old age or bodily infirmities, and others, who on account of their infancy, that will be unable to support them∣selves, it is my will and desire, that all who come under the first and second description, shall be comfortably clothed and fed by my heirs while they live; and that such of the latter descrip∣tion as have no parents living, or if living, are unable or unwil∣ling to provide for them, shall be bound by the court until they shall arrive at the age of twenty five years; and in cases where no record can be produced, whereby their ages can be ascertained, the judgment of the court, upon its own view of the subject, shall be adequate and final. The Negroes thus bound, are (by their masters or mistresses) to be taught to read and write, and to be brought up to some useful occupation, agreeably to the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, providing for the support of orphan and other poor children. And I do hereby expressly forbid the sale or transportation, out of the said Commonwealth, of any Slave, I may die possessed of, under any pretence whatso∣ever. And I do moreover, most pointedly and most solemnly enjoin it upon my Executors hereafter named, or the survivor of them, to see that <HI>this</HI> clause respecting Slaves, and every part thereof, be religiously fulfilled at the epoch at which it is directed to take place, without evasion, neglect or delay, after the crops which may then be on the ground are harvested, par∣ticularly as it respects the aged and infirm; seeing that a regu∣lar and permanent fund be established for their support, as long as there are subjects requiring it; not trusting to the uncertain provision to be made by individuals: And to my mulatto man, <HI>William,</HI> (calling himself William Lee) I give immediate freedom, or if he should prefer it (on account of the accidents which have befallen him, and which have rendered him incapa∣ble of walking, or of any active employment) to remain in the situation he now is, it shall be optional in him to do so; in ei∣ther case, however, I allow him an annuity of Thirty Dollars during his natural life, which shall be independent of the vict∣uals and clothes he has been accustomed to receive, if he chooses the last alternative; but in full with his freedom, if he prefers the first; and this I give him, as a testimony of my sense of his attachment to me, and for his faithful services during the Revo∣lutionary War.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI>—To the Trustees (Governors, or by whatsoever other name they may be designated) of the Academy, in the town of Alexandria, I give and bequeath, in trust, Four Thousand Dol∣lars,
<PB N="5" REF="038994_0004_10128B40AC043810"/>
or in other words, twenty of the Shares which I hold in the Bank of Alexandria, towards the support of a Free School, es∣tablished at, and annexed to, the said Academy, for the purpose of educating such Orphan Children, or the Children of such other poor and indigent persons, as are unable to accomplish it with their own means; and who, in the judgment of the Trus∣tees of the said Seminary, are best entitled to the benefit of this donation. The aforesaid 20 Shares I give and bequeath in perpetuity; the dividends only of which are to be drawn for, and applied by the said Trustees, for the time being, for the uses abovementioned; the Stock to remain entire and untouched, unless indications of failure of said Bank should be so apparent, or a discontinuance thereof, should render a removal of this fund necessary. In either of these cases, the amount of the Stock here devised is to be vested in some other bank, or public insti∣tution, whereby the interest may with regularity and certainty be drawn and applied as above: And, to prevent misconception, my meaning is, and is hereby declared to be, that these Twenty Shares are in lieu of, and not in addition to, the Thousand Pounds given by a missive letter some years ago; in conse∣quence whereof, an annuity of Fifty Pounds has since been paid towards the support of this institution.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI>—WHEREAS by a law of the Commonwealth of Vir∣ginia, enacted in the year 1785, the Legislature thereof, was pleased, as an evidence of its approbation of the services I had rendered the public, during the Revolution, and partly I be∣lieve, in consideration of my having suggested the vast advanta∣ges which the community would derive from the extension of its inland navigation under Legislative patronage, to present me with One hundred shares, of One Hundred Dollars each, in the incorporated Company, established for the purpose of ex∣tending the navigation of James' River, from tide water to the mountains;—and also with Fifty shares of £100 sterling each, in the corporation of another company likewise established for the similar purpose of opening the navigation of the river Po∣towmack, from the tide water to Fort Cumberland; the ac∣ceptance of which, although the offer was highly honorable and grateful to my feelings, was refused, as inconsistent with a prin∣ciple which I had adopted, and had never departed from—viz. not to receive pecuniary compensation for any services I could render my country in its arduous struggle with Greatbritain for its rights; and because I had evaded similar propositions from other States in the Union. Adding to this refusal, how∣ever, an intimation that, if it should be the pleasure of the leg∣islature,
<PB N="6" REF="038994_0005_10128B44E68AA748"/>
to permit me to appropriate the said shares to <HI>public uses,</HI> I would receive them on those terms with due sensibility; and this it having consented to, in flattering terms, as will ap∣pear by a subsequent law, and sundry resolutions, in the most ample and honorable manner, I proceed after this recital, for the more correct understanding of the case, to declare—That as it has always been a source of serious regret with me, to see the youth of these United States sent to foreign countries for the purpose of Education, often before their minds were formed, or they had imbibed any adequate ideas of the happiness of their own; con∣tracting too frequently, not only habits of dissipation and extrav∣agance, but principles unfriendly to Republican Government, and to the true and genuine liberties of mankind; which there∣after are rarely overcome.—For these reasons it has been my ardent wish, to see a plan devised on a liberal scale, which would have a tendency to spread systematic ideas through all parts of this rising empire, thereby to do away local attachments and State prejudices, as far as the nature of things would, or indeed ought to admit, from our National Councils.—Looking anxiously forward to the accomplishment of so desirable an ob∣ject as this is, (in my estimation) my mind has not been able to contemplate any plan more likely to effect the measure than the establishment of an UNIVERSITY in a central part of the U∣nited States, to which the Youths of fortune and talents from all parts thereof, may be sent for the completion of their educa∣tion, in all the branches of polite literature; in arts and scien∣ces, in acquiring knowledge in the principles of politics and good government, and, (as a matter of infinite importance in my judgment) by associating with each other▪ and forming friendships in juvenile years, be enabled to free themselves, in a proper degree, from those local prejudices and habitual jealousies which have just been mentioned; and which, when carried to excess, are never sailing sources of disquietude to the public mind and pregnant of mischievous consequences to this country, under these impressions, so fully dilated.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI>—I give and bequeath in perpetuity, the Fifty shares which I hold in the Potowmack company (under the aforesaid acts of the Legislature of Virginia) towards the endowment of an U∣NIVERSITY▪ to be established within the limits of the district of Columbia, under the auspices of the General Government, if that government should incline to extend a fostering hand towards it; and until such Seminary is established, and the funds arising on these shares shall be required for its support, my further WILL and desire is that the profit accruing therefrom, shall, whenever
<PB N="7" REF="038994_0006_10128B4923F790B8"/>
the dividends are made, be laid out in purchasing Stock in the Bank of Columbia, or some other Bank, at the discretion of my Excutors, or by the Treasurer of the United States for the time being, under the direction of Congress—provided that Honorable body should patronize the measure; and the divi∣dends proceeding from the purchase of such Stock, is to be vest∣ed in more Stock, and so on, until a sum, adequate to the accom∣plishment of the object is obtained; of which I have not the smallest doubt before many years pass away, even if no aid or encouragement is given by the Legislative authority, or from any other source.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI>—The Hundred Shares which I hold in the James River Company, I have given, and now confirm in perpetu∣ity, to and for the use and benefit of Liberty Hall Academy, in the Country of Rockbridge, in the Commonwealth of Vir∣ginia.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI>—I release, exonerate, and discharge the Estate of my deceased Brother <HI>Samuel Washington,</HI> from the payment of the money which is due to me for the land I sold to <HI>Philip Pendleton</HI> (lying in the County of Berkley) who assigned the same to him, the said <HI>Samuel,</HI> who by agreement, was to pay me therefor: <HI>And whereas,</HI> by some contract, (the purport of which was never communicated to me, between the said <HI>Samuel</HI> and his son, <HI>Thornton Washington,</HI> the latter became possessed of the aforesaid Land, without any conveyance having passed from me, either to the said <HI>Pendleton,</HI> the said <HI>Samuel,</HI> or the said <HI>Thornton,</HI> and without any consideration having been made, by which neglect neither the legal nor equitable title has been alienated; it rests therefore with me to declare my inten∣tions concerning the premises; and these are to give and be∣queath the said land to whomsoever the said <HI>Thornton Wash∣ington</HI> (who is also dead) devised the same, or to his heirs for∣ever, if he died intestate, exonerating the estate of the said <HI>Thornton,</HI> equally with that of the said <HI>Samuel,</HI> from pay∣ment of the purchase money, which, with interest, agreeably to the original contract with the said <HI>Pendleton,</HI> would amount to more than a Thousand Pounds; <HI>And whereas,</HI> two other sons of my said deceased Brother <HI>Samuel,</HI> namely <HI>George Steptoe Washington,</HI> and <HI>Lawrence Augustine Washington,</HI> were, by the decease of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se to whose care they were committed, brought under my protection, and in consequence, have occas∣ioned advances on my part, for their education at College, and other schools, for their board, clothing, and other incidental expenses, to the amount of near Five Thousand Dollars, over
<PB N="8" REF="038994_0007_10128B4ABA1241B8"/>
and above the sums furnished by their estate, which sum it may be inconvenient for them or their father's estate to refund—I do for these reasons, acquit them and the said estate from the pay∣ment thereof—my intention being that all accounts between them and me, and their father's estate and me shall stand balanced.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI>—The balance due to me from the estate of <HI>Bartholo∣mew Dandridge,</HI> deceased, (my Wife's Brother) and which amounted on the first day of October, 1795, to four hundred and twentyfive pounds, (as will appear by an account ren∣dered by his deceased son <HI>John Dandridge,</HI> who was the act∣ing executor of his father's will) I release and acquit from the payment thereof—and the Negroes (then thirtythree in num∣ber formerly belonging to the said estate, who were taken in execution, sold and purchased in on my account, in the year <HI>(blank)</HI> and ever since have remained in the possession, and to the use of <HI>Mary,</HI> widow of the said <HI>Bartholomew Dandridge,</HI> with their increase, it is my WILL and DESIRE shall continue and be in her possession, without paying hire, or making com∣pensation for the same, for the time past or to come, during her natural life; at the expiration of which, I direct that all of them who are forty years old and upwards, shall receive their free∣dom; and all under that age and above sixteen, shall serve sev∣en years and no longer; and all under sixteen years shall serve until they are twentyfive years of age, and then be free—and to avoid disputes respecting the ages of any of these Negroes, they are to be taken into the court of the County in which they reside, and the judgment thereof, in this relation, shall be final, and record thereof made, which may be adduced as evidence at any time thereafter, if disputes should arise concerning the same—And I further direct that the heirs of the said <HI>Bartholomew Dandridge</HI> shall, equally share the benefits arising from the ser∣vices of the said negroes, according to the tenor of this devise, upon the decease of their mother.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI>—If <HI>Charles Carter,</HI> who intermarried with my Niece, <HI>Betty Lewis,</HI> is not sufficiently secured in the title to the lots he had of me in the town of Fredericksburg, it is my WILL and DESIRE that my Executors shall make such conveyances of them as the law requires, to render it perfect.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI>—To my nephew, <HI>William Augustine Washington,</HI> and his Heirs (if he should conceive them to be objects worth prosecuting) a Lot in the town of Manchester (opposite to Richmond) No. 265, drawn on my sole account, and also the tenth of one or two hundred acre lots, and two or three half a∣cre Lots, in the city an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>inity of Richmond, drawn in part∣nership
<PB N="9" REF="038994_0008_10128B501DE26400"/>
with nine others, all in the Lottery of the deceased <HI>William Byrd,</HI> are given; as is also a Lot which I purchased of <HI>John Hood,</HI> conveyed by <HI>William Willie</HI> and <HI>Samuel Gor∣don,</HI> Trustees of the said <HI>John Hood,</HI> numbered 139, in the town of Edinburgh, in the County of Prince George, State of Virginia.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI>—To my Nephew, <HI>Bushrod Washington,</HI> I give and bequeath all the Papers in my possession, which relate to my civil and military administration, of the affairs of this country—I leave to him also, such of my private Papers as are worth pre∣serving; and at the decease of my Wife, and before, if she is not inclined to retain them, I give and bequeath my Library of Books and Pamphlets of every kind.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI>—Having sold lands which I possessed in the State of Pennsylvania, and part of a tract held in equal right with <HI>George Clinton,</HI> late Governor of Newyork; in the State of Newyork, my share of land and interest, in the Great Dismal Swamp, and a tract of land which I owned in the County of Gloucester—withholding the legal titles thereto, until the con∣sideration money should be paid—and having moreover leased, and conditionally sold (as will appear by the tenor of the said leases) all my lands upon the Great Kenhawa, and a tract upon Difficult run, in the County of Loudoun, it is my WILL and DIRECTION, that whensoever the contracts are fully and re∣spectively complied with, according to the spirit, true intent, and meaning thereof, on the part of the purchasers, their heirs or assigns, that then, and in that case, conveyances are to be made, agreeable to the terms of the said contracts, and the money arising therefrom, when paid, to be vested in Bank Stock;—the dividends whereof, as of that also which is already vested therein, is to inure to my said Wife during her life, but the Stock itself is to remain and be subject to the general distribu∣tion hereafter directed.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI>—To the <HI>Earl of Buchan</HI> I recommit the "Box made of the Oak, that sheltered the great Sir <HI>William Wallace,</HI> after the battle of Falkirk" presented to me by his Lordship in terms too flattering for me to repeat, with a request "to pass it, on the event of my decease, to the man in my country, who should appear to merit it best, upon the same conditions that have induced him to send it to me." Whether easy or not to select the <HI>Man</HI> who might comport with his Lordship's opinion in this respect, is not for me to say; but conceiving that no disposition of this valuable curiosity can be more eligible than the recommitment of it to his own cabinet, agreeably to the o∣riginal
<PB N="10" REF="038994_0009_10128B52696C0CB8"/>
design of the Goldsmiths' company of Edinburgh, who presented it to him, and at his request, consented that it should be transferred to me—I do give and bequeath the same to his Lordship; and in case of his decease, to his heir, with my grateful thanks for the distinguished honor of presenting it to me, and more especially for the favorable sentiments with which he accompanied it.</P>
<P><HI>Item.</HI>—To my Brother <HI>Charles Washington,</HI> I give and be∣queath the gold headed Cane, left me by Dr. <HI>Franklin</HI> in his will. I add nothing to it, because of the ample provision I have made for his issue. To the acquaintances and friends of any juvenile years, <HI>Lawrence Washington</HI> and <HI>Robert Wash∣ington,</HI> of Chotanck, I give my other two gold headed Canes, having my arms engraved on them; and to each, as they will be useful where they live, I leave one of the Spyglasses, which constituted part of my equipage during the late war. To my Compatriot in arms and old and intimate Friend, Dr. <HI>Craik,</HI> I give my Bureau (or, as the cabinet makers call it, Tambour Secretary) and the circular Chair, an appendage of my study. To Dr. <HI>David Stuart</HI> I give my large Shaving and Dressing Table, and my Telescope. To the Reverend, now <HI>Bryan, Lord Fairfax,</HI> I give a Bible, in three large folio volumes, with notes—presented to me by the Rt. Rev. <HI>Thomas Wilson,</HI> Bishop of Sodor and Mann. To General <HI>De La Fayette</HI> I give a pair of finely wrought steel Pistols, taken from the ene∣my in the revolutionary war. To my Sisters in Law, <HI>Hannah Washington</HI> and <HI>Mildred Washington</HI>—to my friends <HI>Elea∣nor Stuart, Hannah Washington,</HI> of Fairfield, and <HI>Elizabeth Washington</HI> of Hayfield, I give, each a mourning ring, of the value of one hundred dollars. These bequests are not made for the intrinsic value of them, but as mementos of my esteem and regard. To <HI>Tobias Lear,</HI> I give the use of the Farm which he now holds, in virtue of a lease from me to him and his de∣ceased wife (for and during their natural lives) free from rent during his life; at the expiration of which, it is to be disposed of as is herein after directed. To <HI>Sally B. Haynie,</HI> (a distant relation of mine) I give and bequeath three hundred dollars. To <HI>Sarah Green,</HI> daughter of the deceased <HI>Thomas Bishop,</HI> and to <HI>Ann Walker,</HI> daughter of <HI>John Alton,</HI> also deceased, I give each one hundred dollars in consideration of the attach∣ment of their fathers to me; each of whom having lived near∣ly forty years in my family. To each of my Nephews, <HI>William Augustine Washington, George Lewis, George Steptoe Wash∣ington, Bushrod Washington</HI> and <HI>Samuel Washington,</HI> I
<PB N="11" REF="038994_0010_10128B565269FD40"/>
give one of the Swords, or Cutteaux, of which I may die possess∣ed; and they are to choose in the order they are named.—These swords are accompanied with an injunction not to un∣sheath them for the purpose of shedding blood, except it be for self defence, or in defence of their country and its rights; and in the latter case, to keep them unsheathed, and prefer falling with them in their hands to the relinquishment thereof.</P>
<P>AND NOW, having gone through these specific Devises, with explanations for the more correct understanding of the meaning and design of them, I proceed to the distribution of the more important parts of my Estate, in manner follow∣ing:</P>
<P><HI>First.</HI>—To my Nephew, <HI>Bushrod Washington,</HI> and his Heirs, (partly in consideration of an intimation to his deceased Father, while we were Bachelors, and he had kindly undertak∣en to superintend my Estate during my military services, in the former war between Greatbritain and France that if I should fall therein, Mount Vernon, (then less extensive in domain than at present) should become his property, I give and bequeath all that part thereof, which is comprehended within the follow∣ing limits, viz.—BEGINNING at the ford of Dogue Run, near my Mill, and extending along the road, and bounded thereby, as it now goes, and ever has gone, since my recollection of it, to the ford of Little Hunting Creek, at the Gum Spring, until it comes to a knowl, opposite to an old road which former∣ly passed through the lower field of Muddy Hole Farm; at which, on the north side of the said road, are three Red or Spanish Oaks, marked as a corner, and a stone placed—thence by a line of trees, to be marked rectangular, to the back line or outer boundary of the tract between <HI>Thomson Mason</HI> and my∣self—thence with that line easterly (now double ditching, with a post and rail Fence thereon) to the run of Little Hunting Creek—thence with that run, which is the boundary between the lands of the late <HI>Humphry Peake,</HI> and me, to the tide water of the said Creek—thence by that water to Potowmack river—thence with the river to the mouth of Dogue Creek—and thence with the said Dogue Creek to the place of beginning at the aforesaid ford, containing upwards of four thousand acres be the same more or less, together with the Mansion House, and all other buildings and improvements thereon. SECOND—Inconsideration of the consanguinity between them and my Wife, being as nearly related to her as to myself: as, on account of the affection I had for, and the obligation I was under to, their Father
<PB N="12" REF="038994_0011_10128B57E7668088"/>
when living, who from his youth had attached himself to my per∣son, and followed my fortunes through <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e vicissitudes of the late Revolution, afterwards devoting his time to the superintendence of my private concerns for many years, whilst my public employments rendered it impracticable for me to do it myself thereby afford∣ing me essential services, and always performing them in a man∣ner the most filial and respectful: For these reasons, I say, I give and bequeath to <HI>George Fayette Washington,</HI> and <HI>Law∣rence Augustine Washington,</HI> and their heirs, my estate east of Little Hunting Creek, lying on the river Potowmack, includ∣ing the farm of three hundred and sixty acres, leased to <HI>Tobias Lear,</HI> as noticed before, and containing in the whole, by deed, two thousand and twentyseven acres, be it more or less; which said estate, it is my will and desire should be equitably and ad∣vantageously divided between them, according to quantity, qual∣ity, and other circumstances, when the youngest shall have arriv∣ed at the age of twentyone years, by three judicious and disinter∣ested men; one to be chosen by each of the brothers, and the third by these two. In the mean time, if the termination of my Wife's interest therein should have ceased, the profits arising therefrom are to be applied for their joint uses and benefit. THIRD—<HI>And whereas</HI> it has always been my intention, since my expectation of having issue has ceased, to consider the grand∣children of my Wife in the same light as I do my own relations, and to act a friendly part by them, more especially by the two whom we have raised from their earliest infancy, namely, <HI>Elea∣nor Park Custis,</HI> and <HI>George Washington Park Custis,</HI> and whereas the former of these hath lately intermarried with <HI>Law∣rence Lewis,</HI> a son of my deceased sister, <HI>Betty Lewis,</HI> by which union the inducement to provide for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> both has been increased—Wherefore, I give and bequeath to the said <HI>Law∣rence Lewis,</HI> and <HI>Eleanor Park Lewis</HI> his wife, and their heirs, the residue of my Mount Vernon estate, not already devised to my Nephew, <HI>Bushrod Washington,</HI> comprehended within the following description, viz. all the land north of the road leading from the ford of Dogue Run to the Gum Spring, as described in the devise of the other part of the tract to <HI>Bushrod Washing∣ton,</HI> until it comes to the stone and three red or Spanish oaks on the knowl, thence with the rectangular line to the back line (between Mr. <HI>Mason</HI> and me) thence with that line westerly a∣long the new double ditch to Dogue Run, by the tumbling dam of my Mill, thence with the said run to the ford aforementioned: To which I add▪ al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the land I possess west of the said Dogue Run and Dogue Creek, bounded easterly and southerly thereby:
<PB N="13" REF="038994_0012_10128B5B06F572C8"/>
together with the mill, distillery, and all other houses and im∣provements on the premises, making together about two thousand acres, be it more or less. FOURTH—Actuated by the principle already mentioned, I give and bequeath to <HI>George Washington Park Custis,</HI> the grandson of my Wife, and my ward, and to his heirs, the tract I hold on Four Mile Run, in the vicinity of Alexandria, containing one thousand two hundred acres, more or less, and my entire square, No. 21, in the city of Washington. FIFTH—All the rest and residue of my estate, real and personal, not disposed of in manner aforesaid, in whatsoever consisting, wheresoever lying, and whensoever found, a schedule of which, as far as is recollected, with a reasonable estimate of its value, is hereunto annexed, I desire may be sold by my Executors, at such times, in such manner, and on such credits, (if an equal, valid and satisfactory distribution of the specific property cannot be made without) as in their judgment shall be most conducive to the interest of the parties concerned; and the monies arising therefrom to be divided into twentythree equal parts, and ap∣plied as follow, viz. To <HI>William Augustine Washington, E∣lizabeth Spotswood, Jane Thornton,</HI> and the heirs of <HI>Ann Ashton,</HI> sons and daughters of my deceased Brother, <HI>Augustine Washington,</HI> I give and bequeath four parts; that is, one part to each of them. To <HI>Fielding Lewis, George Lewis, Robert Lewis, Howell Lewis</HI> and <HI>Betty Carter,</HI> sons and daughters of my deceased sister, <HI>Betty Lewis,</HI> I give and bequeath five other parts; one to each of them. To <HI>George Steptoe Wash∣ington, Lawrence Augustine Washington, Harriott Parks,</HI> and the heirs of <HI>Thornton Washington,</HI> sons and daughters of my deceased brother, <HI>Samuel Washington,</HI> I give and beqeath other four parts; one to each of them. To <HI>Corbin Washing∣ton,</HI> and the heirs of <HI>Jane Washington,</HI> son and daughter of my deceased Brother, <HI>John Augustine Washington,</HI> I give and bequeath two parts; one to each of them. To <HI>Samuel Wash∣ington, Frances Ball</HI> and <HI>Mildred Hammond,</HI> son and daugh∣ters of my Brother, <HI>Charles Washington,</HI> I give and bequeath three parts: one part to each of them: And to <HI>George Fayette Washington,</HI> Charles Augustine Washington, and <HI>Maria Washington,</HI> sons and daughters of my deceased Nephew, <HI>George Augustine Washington,</HI> I give one other part; that is, to each a third of that part. To <HI>Elizabeth Park Law, Martha Park Peters,</HI> and <HI>Eleanor Park Lewis,</HI> I give and bequeath three other parts, that is, a part to each of them. And to my Nephew, <HI>Bushrod Washington</HI> and <HI>Law∣rence Lewis,</HI> and to my ward, the grandson of my Wife.
<PB N="14" REF="038994_0013_10128B5F0342D6C0"/>
I give and bequeath one other part, that is, a third thereof to each of them. And if it should so happen, that any of the per∣sons whose names are here enumerated (unknown to me) should now be dead, or should die before me, that in either of these cases, the heirs of such deceased person shall, notwithstanding, derive all the benefits of the bequest in the same manner, as if he or she was actually living at the time. And by way of advice, I recommend it to my Executors not to be precipitate of dispos∣ing of the landed property (herein directed to be sold) if from temporary causes, the sale thereof should be dull; experience having fully evinced, that the price of land, (especially above the falls of the river, and on the western waters) have been pro∣gressively rising, and cannot be long checked in its increasing value. And I particularly recommend it to such of the Lega∣tees (under this clause of my will) as can make it convenient, to take each a share of my stock in the Potowmack Company, in preference to the amount of what it might sell for; being tho∣roughly convinced myself, that no uses to which the money can be applied, will be so productive as the tolls arising from this nav∣igation when in full operation, (and thus, from the nature of things, it must be, ere long) and more especially if that of the Shenandoah is added thereto.</P>
<P>The family vault at Mount Vernon requiring repairs, and being improperly situated besides, I desire, that a new one of brick, and upon a larger scale, may be built at the foot of what is commonly called the Vineyard Inclosure, on the ground which is marked out: In which my remains, with those of my deceased relations, (now in the old vault) and such others of my family as may choose to be entombed there, may be deposited. And it is my express desire, that my corpse may be interred in a pri∣vate manner, without parade, or funeral oration.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> I constitute and appoint my dearly beloved Wife, <HI>Martha Washington,</HI> my Nephew, <HI>William Augustine Wash∣ington, Bushrod Washington, George Steptoe Washington, Samuel Washington,</HI> and <HI>Lawrence Lewis,</HI> and my ward, <HI>George Washington Park Custis,</HI> (when he shall have arrived at the age of twentyone years) Executrix and Executors of this Will and Testament: In the construction of which it will be readily perceived that no professional character has been consult∣ed, or has had any agency in the draught; and that although it has occupied many of my leasure hours to digest, and to throw it into its present form, it may, notwithstanding, appear crude and incorrect; but, having endeavored to be plain and explicit in all the devises, even at the expense of prolixity, perhaps of tautolo∣gy,
<PB N="15" REF="038994_0014_10128B61C4DD3188"/>
I hope and trust that no disputes will arise concerning them. But if, contrary to expectation, the case should be otherwise from the want of legal expressions, or the usual technical terms, or because too much or too little has been said on any of the de∣vises to be consonant with law, my will and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ction expressly is, that all disputes, (if unhappily any should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>) shall be de∣cided by three impartial and intelligent men, known for their probity and good understanding; two to be chosen by the dis∣putants, each having the choice of one, and the third by those two—which three men, thus chosen, shall, unfettered by law, or le∣gal constructions, declare their sense of the Testator's intention; and such decision is, to all intents and purposes, to be as binding on the parties as if it had been given in the Supreme Court of the United States.</P>

<L><HI>In witness of all and of each of the things herein contained, I have set my hand and seal, this ninth day of July, in the year One Thousand Seven Hundred and Ninety,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It appears the word "Nine," was omitted by the Testator.</NOTE> <HI>and of the Independence of the</HI> United States, <HI>the twenty fourth.</HI></L>

<HEAD>NOTES.</HEAD>
<P><HI>(a)</HI> THIS tract, for the size of it, is valuable, more for its sit∣uation than the quality of its soil; though that is good for farm∣ing, with a considerable proportion of ground that might very easily be improved into meadow. It lies on the great road from the city of Washington, Alexandria and Georgetown, to Lees∣burgh and Winchester. At Difficult Bridge, nineteen miles from Alexandria, less from the city of Georgetown, and not more than three from Matildaville, at the Great Falls of Potow∣mack there is a valuable seat on the premises, and the whole is conditionally sold for the sum annexed in the schedule.</P>
<P><HI>(b)</HI> What the selling prices of lands, in the vicinity of these two tracts, are, I know not; but▪ compared with those above the ridge and others below them, he value annexed will appear moderate; a less one would not obtain them from me.</P>
<P><HI>(c)</HI> The surrounding land, not superior in soil. situation or properties of any sort, sell currently at from twenty to thirty dol∣lars an acre. The lowest price is affixed to these.</P>
<P><HI>(d)</HI> The observations, made in the last note, apply equally to this <HI>tract;</HI> being in the vicinity of them, and of similar quality, although it lies in another country.</P>
<P><HI>(e)</HI> This tract, though small, is extremely valuable. It has on Potowmack River, about 12 miles above the town of Bath or Warm Springs, and is in the shape of a horseshoe; the river run∣ning almost around it. Two hundred acres of it is rich low grounds, with a great abundance of the largest and finest walnut trees; which with the produce of the soil might, (by means of the improved navigation of the Potowmack) be brought to a shipping port, with more ease, and at a smaller expense, than that which is transported 30 miles only, by land:</P>
<P><HI>(f)</HI> This tract is of second rate Gloucester low ground; it has no improvements thereon, but lies on navigable water, a∣bounding in fish and oysters. It was received in payment of a debt, (carrying interest) and valued in the year 1789, by an im∣partial gentleman, to £800. N. B. It has lately been sold and there is due there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n a balance, equal to what is annexed in the schedule.</P>
<P><HI>(g)</HI> These 373 acres are the third part of undivided purchase made by the deceased Fielding Lewis, Thomas Walker and my∣self; on full conviction that they would become valuable. The Lord lies on the road from Suffolk and Norfolk, touches, (if I am not mistaken) some part of the navigable water of Nanse∣mond river; the Rich Dismal Swamp is capable of great im∣provement; and from its situation must become extremely val∣uable.</P>
<P><HI>(h)</HI> This is an undivided interest, which I held in the Great Dismal Swamp company, containing about 4000 acres, with my part of the plantation and stock thereon, belonging to the com∣pany in the said Swamp.</P>
<P><HI>(i)</HI> These several tracts of land are of the first quality on
<PB N="21" REF="038994_0019_10128B713B535120"/>
the Ohio river, in the parts where they are situated; being al∣most, if not altogether, river bottoms. The smallest of these tracts is actually sold at ten dollars an acre, but the considera∣tion therefor not received. The rest are equally valuable, and sold as high; especially that which lies just below the Little Kenhawa, and is opposite to a thick settlement on the west side of the river. The four tracts have an aggregate breadth upon, the river of sixteen miles, and is bounded thereby that distance.</P>
<P><HI>(k)</HI> These tracts are situated on the Great Kenhawa river, and the first four are bounded thereby for more than forty miles. It is acknowledged by all who have seen them, (and of the tract containing 10990 acres, which I have been on myself, I can assert) that there is no richer or more valuable land in all that region; they are conditionally sold for the sum mentioned in the schedule, that is▪ 200,000 dollars; and if the terms of that sale are not complied with, they will command considerably more. The tract, of which the 125 acres is a moiety, was taken up by General Andrew Lewis and myself, for, and on account of a bituminous spring which it contains, of so inflammable a nature as to burn as freely as spirits, and is as nearly difficult to extin∣guish.</P>
<P><HI>(l)</HI> I am but little acquainted with this land, although I have once been on it. It was received, (many years since) in dis∣charge of a debt to me from Daniel Janifer Adams at the value annexed thereto, and must be worth more. It is very level; lies near the river Potowmack.</P>
<P><HI>(m)</HI> This tract lies about 30 miles above the city of Washing∣ton, not far from Kittoctan. It is good farming land and by those who are well acquainted with it, I am informed that it would sell at twelve or fifteen dollars per acre.</P>
<P><HI>(n)</HI> This land is valuable on account of its local situation, and other properties. It affords an exceeding good stand on Brad∣dock's road, from Fort Cumberland to Pittsburgh, and besides a fertile soil possesses a large quantity of natural meadow, fit for the scythe. It is distinguished by the appellation of the Great Meadows, where the first action with the French in 1754 was fought.</P>
<P><HI>(o)</HI> This is the moiety of about 2000 acres, which remains un∣sold of 6071 acres on the Mohawk river, (Montgomery county) in a patent granted to <HI>Daniel Coxe,</HI> in the township of Coxebo∣rough and Carolinas, as will appear by deed from <HI>Marinas Wil∣let</HI> and wife, to <HI>George Clinton,</HI> (late Governor of Newyork) and myself. The latter sales have been at six dollars an acre, and what remains unsold, will fetch that or more</P>
<P><HI>(p)</HI> The quality of these lands and their situations, may be known by the surveyors' certificates, which are filed along with the patents. They lie in the vicinity of Cincinnati; one tract near the mouth of the Little Miami; another seven, and the third ten miles up the same. I have been informed that they will com∣mand more than they are estimated at.</P>
<P><HI>(q)</HI> For the description of these tracts in detail, see <HI>General Spo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>'s</HI> letters, filed with the other papers relating to them.
<PB N="22" REF="038994_0020_10128B72D5FC43F0"/>
Besides the general good quality of the land, there is a valuable bank of Iron Ore thereon, which when the settlement becomes more populous, (and settlers are moving that way very fast) will be found very valuable; as the Rough Creek, a branch of Green River, affords ample water for furnaces and forges.</P>
<P>LOTS, viz. CITY OF WASHINGTON.</P>
<P><HI>(r)</HI> The two lots near the Capital in square 634, cost me 963 dollars only. But in this price I was favored, on condition that I should build two brick houses, three stories high each; without this reduction, the selling prices of those lots would have cost me about 1350 dollars. These lots, with the buildings thereon, when completed, will stand me in 15,000 dollars at least.</P>
<P><HI>(s)</HI> Lots No. 5, 12, 13 and 14, on the Eastern branch, are ad∣vantageously situated on the water, and although many lots, much less convenient, have sold a great deal higher, I will rate these at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>2 cents the square foot only.</P>
<P>ALEXANDRIA.</P>
<P><HI>(t)</HI> For this lot, though unimproved, I have refused 3500 dol∣lars. It has since been laid out into proper sized lots for build∣ing on; three or four of which are let on ground rent forever, at three dollars a foot on the street, and this price is asked for both fronts on Pitt and Princess street.</P>
<P>WINCHESTER.</P>
<P><HI>(u)</HI> As neither the lot in the town or common have any im∣provements on them, it is not easy to fix a price; but as both are well situated▪ it is presumed that the price annexed to them in the schedule is a reasonable valuation.</P>
<P>BATH.</P>
<P><HI>(v)</HI> The lots in Bath, (two adjoining) cost me, to the best of my recollection, between fifty and sixty pounds, 20 years ago; and the buildings thereon, 150<HI>l.</HI> more. Whether property there has increased or decreased in its value, and in what condi∣tion the houses are, I am ignorant; but suppose they are not valued too high.</P>
<P>STOCK.</P>
<P><HI>(w)</HI> These are the sums which are actually funded; and though no more in the aggregate than 7566 dollars, stand me in at least ten thousand pounds, Virginia money, being the amount of bonded and other debts, due to me, and discharged during the war, when money had depreciated in that rate, ☞and was so settled by public authority.</P>
<P><HI>(x)</HI> The value annexed to these shares is what they have ac∣tually cost me, and is the price affixed by law; and although the present selling price is under par, my advice to the Legatees. (for whose benefit they are intended, especially those who can afford
<PB N="23" REF="038994_0021_10128B75B81C22C0"/>
to lie out of the money) is, that each should take and hold one; there being a moral certainty of a great and increasing profit, arising from them in the course of a few years.</P>
<P><HI>(y)</HI> It is supposed that the shares in the James River Com∣pany must be productive. But of this I can give no decided o∣pinion, for want of more accurate information.</P>
<P><HI>(z)</HI> These are the nominal prices of the Shares in the banks of Alexandria and Columbia; the selling prices vary according to circumstances; but as the stock usually divide from eight to ten per cent per annum, they must be worth the former, at least, so long as the banks are conceived to be secure, although from circumstances, they may sometimes be below it.</P>
<P>The value of the live stock depends more upon the quality than quantity of the different species of it, and this again upon the demand and judgment, or fancy of purchasers.</P>
