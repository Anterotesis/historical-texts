</LG>
<LG>
<PB REF="040398_0011_1015E41986FA3588"/>
<L>Now as he from the Waters came,</L>
<L>He lifts his Soul in Prayer,</L>
<L>And gloriously the Holy Ghost</L>
<L>From Heaven doth appear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In Shape like to a harmless Dove,</L>

<L>Now with the Holy Ghost being fill'd,</L>

<LG>
<PB REF="040398_0012_1015E41B0D503400"/>

<LG>
<L>And many wondrous Works he wro't,</L>
<L>When at the Paschal Feast;</L>

<LG>
<L>Then <HI>Nicodemus</HI> own'd the Lord,</L>

<HEAD>Absence of CHRIST intolerable.</HEAD>

<L>THine Absence, Lord, makes me to cry,</L>

<L>Like lonesome Night becomes my Day.</L>
