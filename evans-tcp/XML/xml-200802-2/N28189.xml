<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>MURDER is a crime of so atrocious a nature, and at the same time so seldom committed in the <HI>United States</HI> of <HI>America,</HI> that whenever it is perpe∣trated, our souls shudder at the depravity of human nature, and we become eager to find out the wretch, who should be so sunk in villainy, as to imbrue his hands in innocent blood.</P>
<P>To this crime of so deep a die, a proportionate share of punishment is annexed: murder and treason being now, according to the ameliorated laws of our state, the only felonies for which those who are found guilty of them, can be condemned to suffer an igno∣minious death.</P>
<P>But if our minds revolt with horror, at the idea of murder, it unfortunately happens that this crime may frequently be committed in such a manner, as to ren∣der it impracticable for us to obtain <HI>direct</HI> and <HI>positive</HI> proof against the guilty. Hence the verdict of a jury must in such cases be entirely dependant on <HI>circum∣stantial evidence.</HI> These, however, ought to be re∣ceived with the utmost caution; as circumstances may appear exceedingly strong against the suspected person, who may, notwithstanding be perfectly innocent of the crime laid to his charge.</P>
<P>He must, indeed, be little acquainted with the histo∣ry of jurisdiction in Great-Britain, Ireland, and the other nations of Europe, who does not know, that va∣rious instances have occurred, in which juries, actuated by the purest, though no doubt, the most mistaken motives, have, by placing too much stress on circum∣stantial
<PB N="iv" REF="037576_0003_10111B7B033D3940"/>
proof assigned to undeserved punishment, per∣sons, who, in consequence of their verdict, have, after suffering an ignominious death, been fairly and posi∣tively proved to have had no share in the crimes for which they have suffered.</P>
<P>Upon the first intelligence of a murder being com∣mitted, suspicion will naturally be attached to somebo∣dy—The rumour against the unfortunate man, whe∣ther innocent or guilty, is propagated with unremitting assiduity, either by those, who entertain some animo∣sity against him, or by credulous persons, who greedi∣ly swallowing what they hear, are eager to disseminate their opinions as widely as possible. Thus the tale goes round, daily accumulating further strength, till at last a prejudice, which at first might only have influ∣enced the minds of a few individuals, becomes popu∣lar, a mole-hill becomes a mountain—and the unfor∣tunate victim become the object of horror and indigna∣tion to the unthinking multitude, who, if it were not for the just rigour of the laws, would make him, with out judge or jury, a sacrifice to their own wild and distracted imaginations.</P>
<P>The above remarks could never, perhaps, with more propriety have been applied to any particular case, than that of Mr. LEVI WEEKS, a young gen∣tleman of respectable character, against whom, at the last court of <HI>Oyer and Terminer, and general Gaol-de∣livery,</HI> a bill of indictment was found, for the Mur∣der of Miss JULIANNA ELMORE SANDS.</P>
<P>The circumstances of his guilt appeared at first, ve∣ry trivial. They were however, afterwards, either by the malicious and studied designs of his enemies, or what is more probable, by that prepensity which thoughtless people generally exercise, in propagating slander, without, perhaps, having any particular de∣sign in view, augmented to such a degree, as in a great measure, to render him the object of universal abhor∣rence. Those who dared to suppose him innocent,
<PB N="v" REF="037576_0004_10111B85664DEC68"/>
were very generally considered as partakers in his guilt. Tale after tale, succeeded to irritate the pub∣lic mind. Hand-bills were soon after his first con∣finement, generally distributed throughout the city, ei∣ther by the industry of those bent upon his destruc∣tion; or, perhaps, by some unprincipled scribbler, who, regardless of the effect, which his productions might have upon the weak part of the community, could conjure up thousands of ghosts and goblins <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We have seen hand-bills, announcing the appearance of dancing devils: a ghost in the debtors' apartment: various accounts of witch∣craft, strange and wonderful prophecies, &amp;c. &amp;c. On due examina∣tion, where are those supernatural appearances to be found? Shall we never learn wisdom, or must we ever be the dupes of imposture?</NOTE> at the Manhattan Well, for the sake of raising a few pence to purchase a dinner.</P>
<P>Happy, thrice happy the people, who entertaining true notions of rational liberty, whilst, on the one hand, they are ready to bring <HI>real</HI> criminals to that punish∣ment, which the laws of the land inflict on their de∣merits, are on the other, bound by the ties of the social compact, never to condemn a man without a hearing —nor to suppose him guilty, till his crime shall be proved against him, in a court of justice—</P>
<P>An impartial court, composed of such wise and up∣right magistrates, as at present adorn our bench; and a jury of such citizens as ever have, and I trust, ever will compose the jurors of the city of New-York, will, no doubt, on all occasions, endeavor to divest themselves of <HI>that bias which popular rumours may have instilled into their minds, against the accused;</HI> examine the tes∣timony, which may be brought before them, with calmness, coolness, and deliberation, and without pre∣justice, favor, or affection, pronounce the innocence or guilt of the prisoners who may be brought before them.</P>
<P>In the case of MR. LEVI WEEKS, who was brought to the bar on Monday the 31st of March last, the
<PB N="vi" REF="037576_0005_10111B86EB8F9898"/>
attention of the public was in general attracted, though his name had been very generally marked with undeserved obloquy, since the middle of the preceding January, and many had been taught to believe, that the charges to be adduced against him would not only be of the most serious nature, but also that no excul∣patory proof could possibly appear in his favour, yet we find that after the most lengthy, and impartial trial which perhaps was ever held in the city of New-York, the jury, after having withdrawn for the short space of <HI>about four minutes,</HI> pronounced him <HI>innocent,</HI> and the surrounding multitudes, who, a few days before, were crying out <HI>crucify him, crucify him,</HI> began in a manner unknown in our courts of justice, to express their approbation by loud applauses. Such is the benefit of impartial courts and juries, from whose decision resulted this TRIUMPH OF INNO∣CENCE.</P>
<P>It need scarcely be premised, that the case of a young man who is a native of this place, and who had, therefore, been <HI>universally beloved by the most respec∣table inhabitants of New York, for his probity, in∣dustry, temperance, suavity of disposition, gentility of manners, &amp;c. in short, for a display of all those virtues, which are most ornamental in the human character,</HI> when accused of so heinous a crime, as that of murder, would attract a large share of the pub∣lic attention: particularly, when it is considered, that the reports concerning him were so numerous and contradictory as to leave no place whereon the im∣partial mind wearied in endeavouring to investigate the truth, could find a rest.</P>
<P>Accordingly, when the trial came on, the concourse of people was so great, as was never before witnessed on a similar occasion in New-York. Indeed, it is probable, that though the room in which the court was held is very large, not one fourth of those who attended could procure admission.</P>
<P>On the evening previous to the trial, I had ex∣pressed
<PB N="vii" REF="037576_0006_10111B096F3AC648"/>
to a few friends my intention of going to the Federal Hall, on the ensuing day, and waiting its re∣sult. They suggested the idea, that the public were gaping with eager anxiety for the issue, and that an account of it would no doubt be very generally ac∣ceptable.</P>
<P>Not being acquainted with the art of stenography, I am incapable of giving verbatim what was said up∣on this solemn and awful occasion. Indeed if I were, I should, in the first instance, think it proper to give only a cursory sketch.</P>
<P>The prejudices respecting him, who was so lately a prisoner, but who is now so honorably cleared, have been disseminated far and wide. The sooner this can be announced to the public the better, so that all false impressions may be done away.</P>
<P>The vast concourse of people, which upon this oc∣casion, not only crouded the outer hall, but even the bar itself, prevented me from taking my notes with that accuracy, which I could have wished. I believe, however, that from what I wrote on the occasion, and what my memory can supply, the following sketch may be deemed, with respect to the most important points, authentic.</P>

<HEAD>THE TRIAL.</HEAD>
<P>SEVERAL of the jury summoned on this occasion, were objected to by the prisoner; but the following gentlemen were at last impannelled:</P>
<P><HI>Garret Strong, Simon Schermerhorn, Robert Lil∣burn, George Scriba, Wm. G. Miller, Richard Ellis, James Hunt, Samuel Ward, John Rathbone, Wm. Wharton, jun. Wm. Wilson,</HI> and <HI>Jasper Ward.</HI></P>
<P>The indictment being read, the purport of which was, that on the evening of the 22d December, about 8 o'clock, he had taken from the place of her residence Miss JULIANNA E. SANDS, that after beating, abus∣ing, &amp;c. the body of the said ELMORE, he had thrown her into a well belonging to the Manhattan company, near Bayard's Lane, which contained a great quantity of water, and that he had been the means of killing or murdering the said ELMORE—To which Mr. WEEKS pleaded <HI>Not Guilty.</HI></P>
<P>The judges, upon this occasion, were Judge Lan∣sing, Richard Varick, Esqr. Mayor, and Richard Harrison, Esq. Recorder.</P>
<P>Richard Furman and Robert Lenox, Esqrs. Alder∣men, likewise attended during a great part of the trial.</P>
<P>The Council on behalf of the state, was, Mr. Col∣den, assistant Attorney-General—and on the part of Mr. WEEKS, Gen. Alexander Hamilton, Col. Burr, Brockholst Livingston, Abraham Skinner, James Woods, Charles Baldwin, and Francis Lynch, Esqrs.</P>
<P>The business was opened by an elegant address from Mr. Colden, in which, after paying a handsome com∣pliment
<PB N="10" REF="037576_0008_10111B8A1A53DE40"/>
to the talents of the attornies for Mr. WEEKS, and noticing that influence which they might acquire by the force of oratory, he observed, that if from the mass of evidence, he should adduce, he could draw truth, he would, in that case, fully discharge the duty of a public prosecutor.</P>
<P>With respect to the person, who now stands as a pri∣soner at the bar, it was certainly much in his favour, that he had heretofore been universally considered as a young man of unblemished character, and irreproach∣able morals; and that indeed, the crime of which he was accused, was of such a horrid nature, as scarcely to make it possible that he could have committed it; and that when all circumstances were considered, it could scarcely be supposed, that human nature was ca∣pable of such a crime.</P>
<P>He, however, on the other hand, stated, that not∣withstanding these favourable appearances, he could ad∣duce proofs, that Mr. LEVI WEEKS had seduced the affections of the deceased Miss E. SANDS that he had promised her marriage; taken her in a sleigh, on the evening of the day mentioned in the indictment, carri∣ed her to the fatal spot and murdered her.</P>
<P>This was the general purport of the attorney gene∣ral's adddress. He, however, condescended, on a number of particulars, which, though no doubt neces∣sary in a court of justice, is incompatible with the bre∣vity contemplated in the present sketch.</P>
<P>He concluded by observing, that whether Mr. WEEKS was guilty of the crime laid to his charge or not, it was certain, that a most inhuman murder had been committed by some one on the body of the de∣ceased: that the nature of the testimony could, in such a case as the present, be only circumstantial; but that a chain of circumstances, supported by a number of witnesses, should often be more conclusive with a Jury than a direct proof—inasmuch, that in the latter case, there might be perjury, whereas in the former no
<PB N="11" REF="037576_0009_10111B0CA144E438"/>
such thing could be suspected. He added, that as the trial would undoubtedly be long, and the witnesses on the part of the people numerous, he would now pro∣ceed.</P>
<P>[☞ And here I would observe, before I enter up∣on the evidence on either side, that it is not my inten∣tion to give even a DETAIL of ALL the different testimonies. Many of them appeared to have no sort of connection with the point in question. Indeed the learned Judge, in summing up the evidence at the con∣clusion of the trial, spoke to the following purpose— That in the great mass of evidence before them, there was a considerable portion, which would seem to dis∣grace the records of a Court.—Nothing, therefore, shall appear here, except what is more immediately connected with the subject.]</P>
<P>The first, and perhaps the most material evidence on the part of the people, was Mrs. Ring, who <HI>affirmed,</HI> that in the month of July last, Levi Weeks came to board in her husband's house and was soon after observed to pay particular attention to Elmore Sands, who had lived with them as one of their family for the last three years: that about the 10th or 11th September, being apprehensive of the fever she went to the country and was desirous of ta∣king Elmore along with her, who was, however, un∣willing, and that she therefore remained at home. That about four weeks after her departure she receiv∣ed a letter from her husband advising her to return home, with which she soon after complied, and re∣turned accordingly. That Elmore being taken un∣well, Mr. Weeks was very assiduous in his attention towards her; sat by her bed, expressed great uneasiness at her affliction, and wished to call a physician; that about the end of November or 1st of December, El∣more usually slept in her own room; and that going up about twelve o'clock one night, she found Mr. Weeks sitting by the bed-side with his cloaths on▪ and
<PB N="12" REF="037576_0010_10111ADFB1A11FB8"/>
that the door was shut against her. (Here Mr. Ring, the husband of this evidence, was ordered to leave the court, during the time his wife was giving evidence.) That the deponent asked Mr. Weeks what was meant by the door being shut against her; to which he an∣swered that he did not know that it was she, upon which the witness asked, why the door was shut at all, to which M. Weeks replied, that as Elmore was sick, he was afraid to trust her with any other person for fear of neglect. That at another time when the deceased was unwell, Mr. Weeks was found sitting by her bed side, that they were often found together, and alone in different parts of the house, and that every day gave corroborations to prove that Mr. Weeks inten∣ded to marry her. That on the morning of the 22d of Dec. Mr. Weeks went out immediately after break∣fast, saying he was going over to his brother's. When he returned some time after he said he had hurt his knee: upon which one observed that he would not be able to go out that day. He said, he would be able at night. After Elmore had dressed his knee he went up stairs accompanied by her, where they re∣mained more than an hour; that some time after eleven o'clock he came down stairs and was soon after followed by her. That a little before night Mr. Weeks and Elmore were in the dining room together, from whence they soon after went up stairs and staid about half an hour. That about dark Elmore had dressed herself as neatly as she possibly could; and that as it was cold and she was to go out that evening, she borrowed a muff from a neighbour: that Mr. Weeks came in a little before eight; and that when the clock struck eight, her husband, the deceased and Mr. Weeks were sitting together; that the witness then adjusted Elmore's shawl, which was crooked, and that she had the muff in her hand: that Mr. Weeks then went to the door with his hat in his hand; that Elmore was then up stairs, all ready to come down:
<PB N="13" REF="037576_0011_10111B12C791B2C8"/>
that immediately after, the door being opened, she heard a person come down stairs, and that there was a whispering by the door, which was instantly shut: that she was a good deal agitated upon this occasion, and that the supposed going out of the two attracted the attention of her husband: that she did not see Mr. WEEKS again till ten o'clock, when William Ander∣son, his apprentice, was waiting for the key to go to bed: that he then came to the fire and gave the key to the apprentice, desiring him to go to bed, and that he appeared to be agitated, and his countenance pale: that he asked whether Hope, the sister of this depo∣nent, who had gone out in the morning, had returned, to which she answered, No: that he then asked whe∣ther Elmore had gone to bed, to which she answered, that she had gone out: that he then expressed his sur∣prise that she should go out alone at so late an hour, to which the witness answered, that she had no reason to suppose that she had gone out alone, to which he made no reply: and that Mr. Weeks went to bed in about half an hour after he came in, and that he was apparently much distressed: That under the expecta∣tion of the return of Elmore, she had sat up till about twelve o'clock, at which time she searched the house, and not finding her, went to bed, leaving the door un∣locked. On Monday the 23d, Mr. Weeks along with the other boarders breakfasted as usual, and that a lit∣tle after Mr. Weeks went out: that she then heard some person go softly up stairs, whom she supposed to be Elmore: that Mr. Weeks then came into the room and asked concerning Elmore, to which the deponent answered, that she had not seen her: that he then ex∣pressed his surprize where she should be, to which she answered, that perhaps she might be upstairs; and that the deponent being nettled at his questions, farther observed, that she supposed he knew best where she was, upon which he went up stairs, and upon coming down said she was not there: that the witness not be∣lieving
<PB N="14" REF="037576_0012_10111B8BA63AC228"/>
him went up stairs herself, and found that what he had said was true▪ that about fifteen minutes after he came again, making enquiry about Elmore, and expressing his surprize where she could be, to which the witness answered, that she had reason to believe she had gone out with him, to which he replied, that he had not seen her since the time she left the room the preceding evening, on which he appeared much con∣cerned: that about twelve o'clock, upon observing to Mr. Weeks that she had been fifty times at the door looking for Elmore, he replied, that he had looked of∣tener than that himself: that on the next morning the 24th December, after breakfast, Mr. Weeks perceiv∣ing her (the witness) to be exceedingly distressed, took hold of her arm, saying, "Don't be uneasy; things may turn out better than you expect." That on the afternoon of the same day, the witness told Mr. Weeks, that matters had now become exceedingly se∣rious, and that she could stand it no longer; that she asked him what had become of her, at the same time observing, that if it had not been for the unlimited con∣fidence which she entertained of him, she would have been much more unhappy than she now was; and he then expressed great sorrow at the deponent's distress: That in a farther conversation upon this subject, the deponent had mentioned to Mr. Weeks, that Elmore previous to her going out had mentioned to her, that she was to be married to him that evening at 8 o'clock; upon which he appeared to be much agitated, and be∣gan to cry, saying, that he was ruined and undone, un∣less she appeared to clear him, and that he would ra∣ther die than live under it: That on the Thursday fol∣lowing Mr. Weeks came in about seven o'clock P. M. at which time the witness being much afflicted, said, she was sure that he had got her, and begged he would tell the truth; to which he replied, "It is my firm belief she is now in eternity. It really is." That upon be∣ing asked what made him say so, he answered, "that
<PB N="15" REF="037576_0013_10111B9359C6C910"/>
he had frequently heard her say, she wished that she had never been in existence." The witness, upon be∣ing questioned with respect to the disposition of the de∣ceased, replied, that she was exceedingly lively, and that the evening she last went out, she appeared more chearful than usual: that on Thursday the muff was found in the Manhattan well. Being questioned con∣cerning the character of Mr. Weeks, she replied, that he was a kind, friendly, and sober young man, and al∣ways very sociable in the family. The witness being questioned, whether she had ever enquired of Mr. Weeks, about his being engaged to Elmore, replied, that she never had, till the Tuesday after her disap∣pearance. On being asked whether she did not know of the deceased being intimate with any other person besides Mr. Weeks, she answered, No. Whether there was reason to suspect any improper conduct be∣tween her husband and Miss Sands, she replied, not in the least.</P>
<P>Hope Sands, sister of the last witness, <HI>affirmed</HI>— That she had once found Mr. Weeks and the deceas∣ed locked up in a room together; but did not know what passed between them: That upon her asking him on Monday, the 23d Dec. whether he knew where Elmore was, he replied, he did not. On being ques∣tioned with respect to Mr. Weeks' general character, she replied, that he was loved by all the family, but that his attachment appeared to be more particularly fixed upon Elmore than any other person.</P>
<P>Elias Ring, <HI>affirmed</HI>—That during his wife's ab∣sence in the country, from the tenth or eleventh of September, till about six weeks thereafter, Mr. Weeks and the deceased were frequently alone together in dif∣ferent parts of the house; that one night, believing them to have been in bed together, he next morning went to Mr. Weeks' room, found the bed greatly tumbled, and the clothes, which Elmore had worn the preceding evening, lying in the room. On being
<PB N="16" REF="037576_0014_10111B185EF896C0"/>
asked whether he had ever said, that Mr. Weeks was engaged to Elmore, he replied, that probably he might —He likewise deposed, that Mr. Weeks was much more attentive to Elmore, than he was to Hope Sands, or Mary Clark, both of whom were unmarried wo∣men living in the house: That Elmore was a girl of a lovely disposition, and decent character, and that he was not at first uneasy on account of her disappear∣ance, because he thought that Mr. Weeks, in whom he reposed the greatest confidence, was along with her. That upon the twenty-sixth of Dec. Mr. Weeks, af∣ter taking him, (this deponent) up stairs, had enquired whether he had said any thing about his, (Mr. Weeks') knowing any thing about Elmore, to which he, (the deponent) answered, that he had, and that he verily believed he knew all about her. On being asked, whe∣ther he had ever said, that if he could do it privately, he would kill Mr. Weeks, he replied, that he had ne∣ver even thought of such a thing.</P>
<P>Margaret Clark being <HI>sworn,</HI> deposed that she had lived in Mr. Ring's house, in the capacity of servant some time before Mr. Weeks had come to reside there as a boarder; but that she was not there during the time that Mrs. Ring was in the country, that she knew that Mr. Weeks and the deceased had been in bed together the Monday before her disappearance, but that she did not believe, that Mr. Weeks had engaged to marry her. That he was always very at∣tentive to any one in the family who might be sick; but not more so to the deceased, than to any other person. That the deceased was an active and lively girl, and that during the conversation, which at any time had passed between them, she had never said, that she was engaged to marry Mr. Weeks.</P>
<P>Isaac Hatfield being <HI>sworn,</HI> said that he had gone to lodge in Mr. Ring's house about the 14th or 15th of September, where he continued four or five weeks, during which time he observed a great intimacy to
<PB N="17" REF="037576_0015_10111B99245617F0"/>
subsist between Mr. Weeks and the deceased, who seemed to be exceedingly fond of each other: that when he left the house, there was no boarder there except Mr. Weeks; being asked with respect to the disposition of the deceased, he said, that she appeared to him to be a very lively and chearful girl.</P>
<P>Mr. Croucher being <HI>sworn,</HI> deposed that he had lodged in the house from the 2nd week in September, during which time he had observed great intimacy between Mr. Weeks and the deceased; and that he had never observed any courtship to be more warm; that for two nights, the deceased had been a great while in Mr. Week's bed-room, and that one evening, the door being left unguardedly open, he had seen them engaged in an indecent act: Upon being asked wheth∣er he had any difference with Mr. Weeks, he answer∣ed that he once had, and in consequence of that difference, he had called Mr. Weeks an impertinent puppy; that the evening on which the deceased was missing he had been at a house in the Bowery, from which he returned about half past eleven o'clock, an hour later than usual, as he had engaged with Mr. Ring always to be at home by ten o'clock; that he had never been on bad terms with the deceased, ex∣cept that there was some dryness between them for a while, in consequence of his difference with Mr. Weeks: that on the night of Sunday, the 22d Dec. on Monday night, and every night thereafter as long as Mr. Weeks continued there, he had been disturbed by a noise in Mr. Week's room, &amp;c. On being asked whether he had passed near the Manhattan well the night of the 22d, he answered that he had not; he further observed, that the night was cloudy and walking very bad.</P>
<P>Henry Ronalds having <HI>affirmed,</HI> said, that he had been acquainted with the deceased from her infancy, concerning whom he never knew any thing unbeco∣ming
<PB N="18" REF="037576_0016_100EDF0BB94E93F8" MS="y"/>
in her conduct or character, and that she was a lively and active girl.</P>
<P>John Benson having <HI>affirmed,</HI> said, that he had re∣sided in the house of Mr. Ring for some days, in the month of September last, during which time he had perceived nothing extraordinary in the conduct of the deceased, or Mr. Weeks. He added that the deceas∣ed was a lively and active girl.</P>
<P>Susannah Broad, an aged woman, being <HI>sworn,</HI> de∣posed, that she lived in the vicinity of the house of Mr. Ezra Weeks, and that about eight o'clock, on a Sunday evening, she heard the gate open, which made her believe that somebody was stealing: that a sleigh or chaise had been brought out, she knew not which, and that about twelve days after the body of the de∣ceased was found. That she had never before nor since, heard a sleigh or carriage go out from that gate.— On being cross-examined, she seemed quite indecisive with respect to the sleigh going out, and gave no satis∣factory answers with respect to other circumstances, concerning which she was questioned. Chief Justice Lansing, in summing up the evidence, mentioned her testimony as being entitled to no consideration.</P>
<P>Several evidences were now brought to prove, that on the evening of the 22d December, a one horse sleigh, without bells, had been met driving down the middle road, at a great rate, containing, as some of them said, a man and a woman, and others, two men and a woman: that on Monday the track of a one horse sleigh had been observed near the Manhattan Well, and that, on the preceding evening, cries of the most extreme distress were heard. As, however, there did not appear the smallest shadow of evidence, that Mr. Weeks had any share in these transactions, it is unnecessary to detail them.</P>
<P>Dr. Skinner being duly <HI>sworn,</HI> deposed, that he had visited the body of the deceased, after it had been taken out of the well, both in the house of Mr. Ring,

and in the street: but more particularly in the latter.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the sake of such of my readers as may not be acquainted with the subject, it may be proper to observe, that the body of the deceased continued exposed to public view, at the house of Mr. Ring▪ for two or three days previous to interment: and that for some hours before the removal of the corps, it was placed in the street. Hundreds, per∣haps I might say thousands, came to view it.</NOTE> That he found several bruises on her legs, neck, left breast, forehead, and chin, which he supposed to be oc∣casioned by compression: that he observed several redish and black spots, the cause of which he did not exactly know; that her neck was not broken; that he was unacquainted with both the parties; that he did not believe that the appearances which he saw could be the effect of cold or heat.</P>
<P>James W. Lent being <HI>sworn,</HI> says, That while sit∣ting at dinner, he had been called upon to assist in searching for the body of a young woman in the Man∣hattan well; and that he had gone thither, accompani∣ed by Messrs. Andrew Black, Lawrance Myers, — Page, and Elias Ring; that they took along with them a pole, in which they fixed some nails; that upon put∣ting down the pole into the well, they found some∣thing, which upon attempting to draw up became hea∣vier and heavier; that upon seeing some calico appear upon the top of the water, they were convinced they had got the body of the young woman of which they were in quest; that in order to get her up the more easily, a rope was procured from the neighbourhood and placed under her arms, by which means she was pulled up in such a manner as to do no injury to the body; that her appearance was such as to induce him and the others who were present upon the occasion, to suppose that she was murdered; that her hat, handker∣chief and shoes were off; that her stockings were down and partly torn, and that her toes were scratched, and also her hands, but not in such a manner as to induce a belief, that she had sustained the injury by attempting to climb up the well; that immediately after finding
<PB N="20" REF="037576_0018_100EDF0DE563E258"/>
the body, they went to the Police Office, where a war∣rant appeared to be in readiness for the apprehension of Mr. Weeks; that upon finding him to be the per∣son suspected, he was exceedingly astonished, as he could not conceive him to be guilty of an atrocious deed; and that immediately after his caption, he ask∣ed, whether the body was not found in the Manhattan well? The witness, on being asked whether the disco∣very had been kept a secret amongst those who took the body out of the well, replied that it had.</P>
<P>Dr. Snedeker being <HI>sworn,</HI> deposed, that he had seen the corps two or three days after it was taken out of the well—that the collar and breast bones were hurt—and the neck much injured: that he could move the collar from the breast bone: and that, upon her breast, there was a livid appearance as large as a dol∣lar. The witness being asked whether a corpse might assume a livid appearance by exposure to the air or cold, replied, he believed not—Being questioned, whe∣ther such an appearance might not be occasioned by suffocation, he answered, that he was not certain.</P>
<P>Dr. David Hossack having <HI>sworn,</HI> deposed, that he had seen the body of the deceased, and had observed three or four spots on the neck, and that her forehead was bruised: both of which he consi∣dered to be the effect of violence from some other person than herself, and that in his opinion, she could by no act of her own, have inflicted such wounds on herself as appeared on his examination of the body.</P>
<P>Mrs. Osborn, being <HI>sworn,</HI> deposed that the de∣ceased Miss Sands, with whom she was well acquainted, was a lively girl, received the muff, which was after∣wards found in the Manhattan well from Mrs. Blonk.</P>
<P>William Williams being <HI>sworn,</HI> deposed that he had rode from the house of Mr. Ring with a horse to the Manhattan well in sixteen minutes, and at another in fifteen, that he was then only on a trott and hat very probably it might have been done in less time.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="037576_0019_100EDEE3075DBA18"/>Mr. Buskirk being <HI>sworn,</HI> deposed exactly to the same purpose as the evidence immediately preceding.</P>
<P>William Cross being <HI>sworn,</HI> deposed that the horse belonging to Mr. E. Weeks was a good runner, smart and active, and that such a horse with a sleigh, moderately loaded might, when there was good sleigh∣ing run a mile in five minutes.</P>
<P>The evidence being now closed on the part of the people, colonel Burr addressed the court and jury in one of the most eloquent speeches, which we have ever heard. His eloquence was however, in the present case unnecessary, as the guilt ascribed to Mr. Weeks, appeared to every person present upon the trial to have been unsupported by any substantial evidence.</P>
<P>Colonel Burr then addressed himself in behalf of the prisoner to the court and jury, in one of the most masterly speeches both with respect to composition and oratory, which we have ever heard, the purport of which is as follows.</P>
<P>He began by taking notice of the great calmness, with which the jury had listened to the subject in discussion for many hours. He observed, that in criminal cases, it was essentially necessary for a jury who did not wish to be hereafter tortured with remorse of conscience that circumstantial evidence was, in general, improper, and ought in no case whatever, to be relied on, unless that they were uniformly and completely connected together in one regular chain. He spoke of the influence which prejudice might have upon the imaginations, as tending in such cases to prevent a wise and just decision: that in a court of justice, if there were any biass it ought rather to be in the favour of the prisoner's innocence, than of his guilt, and at all events, every man should be deemed innocent of the crime laid to his charge, 'till he was proved guilty: that tales of every species had been <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>gated against the prisoner, which had left the
<PB N="22" REF="037576_0020_100EDF1007B0EEE0"/>
most unfavourable impression upon the public mind. That with respect to these it was essentially necessary for the jury to fortify themselves, in order to their fixing upon a just and proper verdict; and that he was persuaded, that if the whole evidence aqainst Mr. Weeks was fairly and impartially examined, there was not a single circumstance on the face of the testimony, which could influence a jury to pronounce the prison∣er guilty.</P>
<P>He observed, that, notwithstanding the intimacy, which was said to have subsisted between the prisoner and the deceased, it did not amount to courtship, or a well-founded expectation of a future marriage; and that his attention to her appeared by no means to indi∣cate any such views: that the deceased had manifested equal partiality for other persons, as for Mr. Weeks: and that she was frequently in the habit of going out late at night, and that in her apologies for such con∣duct, it would be found, that she had asserted, that she had spent her time in houses, where it afterwards appeared she had not been:—and that hence it might fairly be concluded, that if the conduct of the deceased had not been irregular, it at least had been very indiscreet, and might have expo∣sed her to danger, both with respect to her morals and person; and that if she really had been murdered, the suspicion might, with more propriety be attached to some other person than to Mr. Weeks. That it would appear, on the evidence, which would hereafter be produced, in what manner the prisoneer was em∣ployed on the evening of the 22d Dec.: from which it would be evident, that he could not possibly have had any share in throwing the deceased into the Man∣hattan Well—and that about half past 8 o'clock, be∣ing nearly the time at which the unfortunate transac∣tion was supposed to have happened, he was at the house of his brother, where he supped, and sat till ten o'clock, in a calm, composed, and cheerful manner, as
<PB N="23" REF="037576_0021_100EDEE526DB4400"/>
usual, and without discovering the least perturbation of mind.</P>
<P>He observed, that before a jury could be justified in bringing a verdict against a prisoner, upon circum∣stantial evidences, circumstances upon which they were to found their opinion, must be closely connected together, and that there must be no breach in the chain —but that the old woman's deposition, with respect to the story of the sleigh, was so exceedingly defective, that it did not deserve the smallest attention—that she was obviously lost in recollection, with respect to dates and time.</P>
<P>He observed, that on this occasion, the utmost in∣dustry and ingenuity had been exercised, to irritate the public mind against the prisoner—that upon ob∣serving every circumstance, he could have no motive in perpetrating so horrid a deed: that there could be no love connected with jealousy—that he could not possibly have harboured any resentment—which was more than could be said with respect to some others, who were her acquaintances, and whose interest it might be greater to have destroyed the deceased, than Mr. Weeks.</P>
<P>He then proceeded to state, that Mr. Weeks was a young man highly esteemed by many of the most respectable inhabitants of New-York; that there could not possibly be any good ground for suspecting that he was the murderer of the deceased; that con∣sidering every circumstance, viewing his general character and appreciating any motive, by which it might be supposed, he could possibly be actuated, he could not be guilty.</P>
<P>That there was nothing extraordinary in the cir∣cumstance of his being appalled, when taxed with the charge of murder, as this might be produced at the astonishment of the charge, or resentment against the persons who dared to harbour such a supposition.</P>
<P>He warned the jury against paying attention to popular rumours and mentioned two cases▪ in which
<PB N="24" REF="037576_0022_100EDF11F169BFF0"/>
persons after having been generally supposed guilty of the crimes alledged against them, were afterwards found innocent.</P>
<P>The first was with respect to a man who was indict∣ed for having murdered a young woman. Although entirely innocent of the crime laid to his charge, he got affrightened and in order, as he hoped, to save himself from the agony of death, upon the gibbet, got another woman to represent the person who was supposed to be missing—the fraud was discovered and this connected with other circumstances induced the jury to bring their verdict <HI>guilty.</HI> The man was hanged; but the woman supposed to be murdered, afterwards made her appearance, by which every per∣son was convinced that the jury had been mistaken in their verdict.</P>
<P>The second case which he mentioned was respect∣ing a rape supposed to be committed, some few years ago upon a young woman of this city, the circum∣stances of which must be fresh in the memory of most people: the public mind was in that case greatly in∣censed, and notwithstanding the verdict of a jury declaring the presoner not guilty, the irritation of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> minds was so great as to induce them to insult the magistrates and to pull down the house of a per∣son who was believed to be aiding and abetting this supposed rape—A civil suit was afterwards commenc∣ed against the person accused, who, though acquited by a jury, was for a long time, to gratify the ven∣geance of some vindictive individual, immured with∣in the walls of a prison—The accusation, however, against the prisoner, has of late appeared to be ab∣solutely false and groundless<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Colonel Burr previous to the jury being inclosed, quoted the case of three other persons, who were executed for supposed crimes of which it was afterwards clear they were innocent.</NOTE>—Thus he was a suffer¦er on account of popular prejudice.</P>
<P>Without mentioning these things he had reason to suppose the jury now before him was fully armed
<PB N="25" REF="037576_0023_100EDEE70361E3F8"/>
against prejudice, which, in many cases, had been found to operate against the innocent: that they should impartially weigh the whole mass of testimo∣ny before them and give no scope to the effect, which previous reports might have had upon their imagina∣tion, that in cases of this sort every body knew some∣thing: every day added more and more to the report —incessant talk upon the subject inflamed the public mind: frequent repetition induced belief and that ima∣gination formed reality.</P>
<P>He concluded by observing, that the circumstance of Mr. Weeks, when first apprehended, having asked whether the body of the deceased was found in the Man∣hattan well was not in the least extraordinary, as he had been previously apprised that the muff had been found there. On the whole he believed that the proof against his client, was so little to the purpose and that the evi∣dence which would now be adduced in his favour, was such as to induce the jury to bring in a verdict in his favour without leaving their seats.</P>
<P>After having finished this eloquent address, of which I have given a cursory sketch, the evidences were then brought forward in favour of Mr. Weeks.</P>
<P>Wm. Seaman being <HI>sworn,</HI> deposed, that he lives in the house of Mr. Ezra Weeks, as an apprentice; that amongst other things assigned to his care, there was that of the horse and sleigh, concerning which Mr. E. Weeks paid little or no attention: that upon the evening of the 22d December, he had as usual locked up the gate and had either put the key in his pocket or on the mantle-piece, he could not say which—nor could he recollect whether he had found it in his pock∣et, or on the mantle piece, the next morning— that, however, when he went there, he found eve∣ry thing in the same situation as he had left it—that the sleigh had eight bells affixed to it with leather strings, which it would take some time to unloose▪ and that he believed if the knots had been unloosed, and
<PB N="26" REF="037576_0024_100EDF13F99DF448"/>
afterwards tied by some other person, he was inclined to believe, that he would have observed it. He added farther, that he had been home on the evening of the 22d of Dec, saw Mr. Levi Weeks there, about half past 8 o'clock, and that he was perfectly mild, compo∣sed and cheerful as usual.</P>
<P>Mrs. Forest being <HI>sworn,</HI> deposed, that she lived in the neighborhood of the house of Mr. Ring, and of course was near at hand, when the unfortunate cir∣cumstance of the disappearance, and afterwards the discovery of the deceased took place. That upon the second of Jan. about twelve in the forenoon, pre∣vious to Mr. Levi Weeks being arrested, she had men∣tioned to him the circumstance of the muff, which the deceased had worn, being found at or near a well close by Bayard's lane: that he received this information with the utmost composure, and from every appear∣ance, did not discover the smallest degree of perturba∣tion.</P>
<P>Joseph Watkins being <HI>sworn,</HI> deposed, that he had been called upon by Mr. Ring, on the twenty second of Dec. for the purpose of assisting in fetching up the body of the unfortunate Miss Sands: that after get∣ting a pole properly prepared, with nails in it, and a rope, by which they might with more convenience, take up the corpse. That upon its being got out of the well, her hair appeared to be down and tumbled, her shawl torn off, her face much swelled: and being questioned with respect to the other injuries which appeared on her body, he seemed to consider them rather as scratches than bruises. He observed farther, that her stockings were down; that with respect to her feet, he had not obsereed whether they had been inju∣red or not: that the neck of the deceased was swelled; but that he had not perceived any marks.</P>
<P>This witness further declared, that in September or October last, during the time that Mrs. Ring was absent in the country, he heard a noise in a room in
<PB N="27" REF="037576_0025_100EDEE8CD51C658"/>
Mr. Ring's house which was only separated from his own appartment by a thin partition, and that the noise was similar to that, which might happen when husband and wife were in bed together, that two distinct voices could be heard upon these occasions, the one of which was loud and rough, and the other low; that he be¦lieved the voice of the former was that of Elias Ring, and the latter that of Miss E. Sands; that this struck his mind with astonishment, and that he was appre∣hensive, it might occasion great disquietude in Mr. Ring's family. That the voice of the man was not that of Mr. Weeks because his was very smooth; that of Mr. Ring on the contrary was rough, and that he was well acquainted with the tone of Mr. Ring's voice: and that for 12 or 14 times he had heard a noise of a similar kind between the middle of the months of September and October, that after Mrs. Ring's return no noise of that nature was heard; that one morning after the discovery of the de∣ceased body, Mrs. Ring appeared exceedingly sorry for the situation of Mr. Weeks, whom she represented as being a young man of the most friendly disposition, and exceedingly attached to her family: and that if any person was sick he would without discrimination pay the utmost attention. This deponent further added, that the body of the deceased had, in a room of Mr. Ring's house been exposed for several days, and afterwards for a few hours previous to its interment, in the street: that Mr. Croucher was very assiduous in spreading suspicions against Mr. L. Weeks.</P>
<P>Mrs. Watkins, the wife of the aforesaid deponent, being from sickness, confined to her room, was sworn by the chief justice, and her testimony was as follows: That between the room in which she and her husband slept, and another in the possession of Mr. Ring, there was only a thin lath and plaister partition, that from the middle of Sept. to the middle of Oct. she had fre∣quently been disturbed by the rustling of the beds,
<PB N="28" REF="037576_0026_100EDF16D0B23F08"/>
such as might be occasioned by man and wife▪ that the voice was evidently rougher than that of Mr. Weeks: that he possibly could not be the person who was with that woman: That Mr. Watkins appeared greatly alarmed about the business, and said that the devil would be to pay in Mr. Ring's family, upon the return of Mrs. Ring—That up∣on Mrs. Ring's return, no noises of a similar na∣ture were heard: on being asked with regard to Miss E. Sands's general conduct she answered, that she be∣lieved it was in general regular and proper, that Mrs. Ring had told her that Mr. Weeks was amiable in his manners and kind to the children; that in fact he was considered rather as one of the family than a boarder.</P>
<P>Anthony Rutgers being <HI>sworn,</HI> deposed that he had fallen in with Elias Ring in Gre<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>wich Street, accom∣panied by another person, that the weather at that time, was exceedingly bad, admitting neither of walking or riding with convenience, that Mr. Ring asked him if he knew any thing about a muff; upon which the deponent expressed great surprise when Mr. Ring told him the girl had been missing about eight days, that she might be dead for ought he knew, and her death might be occasioned by a love fit, that this deponent supposing her body might be in the river, advised them to employ George Wallgrove who was one of the most expert persons of any in this city for sweeping for drowned persons; the deponent fur∣ther declared that from the conversation which passed betwen him and Mr. Ring, he did not believe at the time that Mr. Ring had any idea of the girl's having been murdered.</P>
<P>Mrs. Forest being again called, mentioned a conver∣sation which had passed between her and Mr. Grouch∣er—That Mr. Croucher was sorry for the unfortu∣nate affair: that he had spent the evening of the twen∣ty second of Dec. at a friend's house in the bowery: that he was very sorry that on his way home, he had
<PB N="29" REF="037576_0027_100EDEEA5A2158A8"/>
not come past the Manhattan well, as in that case he might have been the means of saving the life of the de∣ceased.</P>
<P>Elizabeth Watkins, daughter of Joseph Watkins, being <HI>sworn,</HI> deposed, That she was acquainted with Miss E Sands, and that she knew the room in which she slept, to be adjoining to that of her mother's. Up∣on being questioned with respect to the general char∣acter of Mr. Weeks, she declared in her opinion he was a quiet, peaceable, and benevolent young man.</P>
<P>Doct. Mackintosh being <HI>sworn,</HI> deposed, That he had been called upon to attend a coroner's inquest, upon the body of Miss E. Sands, and that going thi∣ther, had fallen in with Dr. Prince, who accompanied him, and who was also desired by in officer to attend upon the occasion. That upon examining the body, nothing appeared to vindicate a supposition of exter∣nal violence, as the injuries which she had reveived, seemed more like scratches, than wounds or bruises: that he had opened her head, breast and body, and that no extravasion of blood appeared: that there was no dislocation of the neck, that, however, there were livid spots—That being particularly required by the coronore's inquest, to examine whether she was pregnant or not, he was decidedly of opi∣nion she was not: that there was no marks of vio∣lence on the belly, and that the collar bone was not dislocated.</P>
<P>Dr. Prince being <HI>sworn,</HI>, appeared exactly to coin∣cide with Dr. McIntosh in opinion.</P>
<P>Dr. Romayne, being <HI>sworn,</HI> seemed to coincided in the same opinion.</P>
<P>David Forest being <HI>sworn,</HI> deposed, that in a conver∣sation with Mr. Croucher, who came into his store where this deponent was, said if Miss Sands was dead, it would be nothing strange to him, after he had heard what the landlord expressed: he further told him, that there was a material evidence, who would come from
<PB N="30" REF="037576_0028_100EDF18A12D9B48"/>
the Jerseys, that would be fully sufficient to have Mr. Weeks arraigned, condemned and hanged!</P>
<P>Israel Lacey being <HI>sworn,</HI> deposed, that he was a lodger in Mr. Ring's house at the time Miss Sands dis∣appeared. That he came home that evening, about ten o'clock, and in about four minutes after, went to bed along with his companion, Mr. Russel; that du∣ring his, the deponent's stay at that house, he did not perceive that Mr. Weeks appeared more attentive to Miss Sands than to any of the other females about the house. That upon the night of Miss Sands' disappear∣ing, and on the ensuing night; he did not hear any noise in Mr. Weeks' room: that on the contrary, in all his actions he appeared to be as cool, tranquil and collected as ever. That he understood Mr. Ring had expressed himself to this purpose: That it would be no harm to shoot Mr. Weeks, if it could be done without discov∣ery.</P>
<P>Mr. Dustan being <HI>sworn,</HI> deposed, that on Friday last, a man, at that time unknown to him, but whom he afterwards knew to be Mr. Croucher, had come in∣to his store, between 6 and 8 o'clock in the morning, who saluted them with "good morning, gentlemen— Levi Weeks is taken up by the high sheriff—Some more fresh proof will be brought forward against him —A material evidence will come forward from Hackensack." After announcing his name to be Croucher, he took his leave, apparently having no o∣ther business than to communicate this news.</P>
<P>Hugh M'Dougal being <HI>sworn,</HI> deposed, That he had for some time past been acquainted with Mr. Croucher, concerning whom, however, he did not en∣tertain the most favorable opinion: that upon going through Greenwich street about the 2d of January, and passing the house of Mr. Ring, he found Mr. Crouch∣er amazingly assiduous in drawing in the multitude who came past, to view the corpse: that he mention∣ed a variety of circumstances against Mr. Weeks, in
<PB N="31" REF="037576_0029_100EDEEC7507B6D0"/>
the propagation of which he appeared very diligent that the said Croucher had been occasionally in the ha¦bit of coming to his (the deponent's) house with such articles as shawls, &amp;c. to sell; that he made it a gene∣ral point to come at dinner time, but not liking him, his visits were not welcome; that he had told his wife if Mr. Croucher should come with more goods, she should tell him that if they wanted any they would call upon him: that upon Thursday last he had called up∣on him while busy in his garden, and his sole business appeared to be, to inform him of fresh evidence from the Jerseys: To which the deponent replied, that as a difference had subsisted between him and Mr. Weeks, his conduct appeared to him to be extremely indelicate and improper; and that for his part, notwithstanding all the tales which might be propagated to Mr. Weeks <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>advantage, he should suppose him innocent till he <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rd more about it.</P>
<P>☞ In support of the testimony of Mr. Croucher <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>dence, were brought forward to depose, that on the evening of the 22d of December, he had supped at a house in the Bowery, in which he continued from sun∣down or before that period till nearly eleven o'clock at night, during which time he could not have been gone ten minutes from the house without being missing. Mrs. Brown, who resides in the upper end of the Bow∣ery, deposed, that upon the anniversary of her child's birth-day, she had invited some friends to supper, a∣mongst whom was Mr. Croucher, who continued in the house from about half past four till eleven o'clock in the evening: but upon being more particularly ex∣amined, she could with great difficulty condescend up∣on the precise day, on which this birth-day feast hap∣pened.</P>
<P>A School-Madam, who lives in that vicinity, being <HI>sworn,</HI> deposed, that she had on the evening of Mrs. B.'s child's birth-day, been at her house, during the lat∣ter part of the day, along with several other persons, a∣mongst
<PB N="32" REF="037576_0030_100EDF1ABAB305F8"/>
whom Mr. Croucher was one, who continued there from about sun-down till about eleven o'clock. On being questioned on what day this happened, she could not tell. Whether before or after Christmas she could not recollect. Was it on a Sunday or week day—she could not at first remember: but at last as∣sented that it was on a Sunday: but what particular Sunday, she could not expressly determine.</P>
<P>Two more persons, who were said to have been present at this birth-day feast, deposed, that Mr. Crou∣cher had been one of the party, and that he continued in the house from about sun-down till towards eleven o'clock. They, however, were equally undecisive with respect to the month and day on which this trans∣action happened as the two preceding evidences.]</P>
<P>Timothy Crane being sworn, deposed, That he boarded some time at the house of Mr. Ring, du∣ring which he could perceive no partiality of Mr. Weeks to either of the girls about the house; that the deceased was sometimes more cheerful than at others; that he worked in the shop with Mr. L. Weeks, on whose conduct he perceived no difference after the absence of Miss Sands; that he laid out the work as usual, and attended to every part of his business as heretofore.</P>
<P>John M'Comb being <HI>sworn,</HI> says, That about 6 or 7 o'clock in the evening, his wife and he had gone to the house of Mr. E. Weeks, where L. Weeks stay∣ed till about 8 o'clock; that some time previous to his departure, he stood leaning on the back of a chair, listening to the conversation which passed be∣tween me and his brother, without indicating the smal∣lest confusion or perturbation of mind.</P>
<P>Amos Mead being <HI>sworn,</HI> says, That on the even∣ing of the 22d of December, Mr. and Mrs. M'Comb were at the house of Mr. E. Weeks; that L. Weeks stayed there from about half past eight till about ten o'clock, when he went away.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="037576_0031_100EDEEE499B2310"/>Ezra Weeks being <HI>sworn,</HI> says, That on the morn∣ing of the 22d of December, L. Weeks had come to his house, where he remained till he (the deponent) went to church, and that he did not return till about 5 o'clock in the afternoon: that between 6 and 7, L. Weeks came in and continued till about 8, conversing cheerfully with Mr. and Mrs. M'Comb, and himself; that he then left the room and returned in about 20 minutes, supped, and talked in his usual manner, spoke about the business of the ensuing day, took minutes of the work to be done with accuracy, and had the work done with punctuality.</P>
<P>Charles Thurston being <HI>sworn,</HI> says, That he wrought in the shop with Mr. E. Weeks, first as a journeyman, then as a foreman; that upon the report of Miss Sands being missing, Mr. L. Weeks still ap∣peared to be as attentive to business as formerly; that the books were kept with the same accuracy; that he appeared to be perfectly composed in his mind.</P>
<P>Among the numerous witnesses who have been al∣ready mentioned, there were none who, when question∣ed with respect to Mr. Weeks's character, did not speak of him in terms of the highest applause.</P>
<P>To substantiate this point, which, however, appear∣ed to be disputed by nobody, a great number of the most respectable citizens were called as evidences. And their unanimous opinion with respect to him was, that he was a young man of amiable character, and the most irreproachable manners; that he was mild, hu∣mane, benevolent, industrious and temperate, and that in short, he was universally esteemed by all who knew him.</P>
<P>After the examination of the witnesses, which conti∣nued from Monday morning at eleven o'clock, till Wednesday morning at two, the Counsel for Mr. Weeks, without a single remark upon the testimony, submitted the whole to the Court. Mr. Chief Justice
<PB N="34" REF="037576_0032_100EDF1CD964BB80"/>
Lansing, after briefly commenting upon the testimony before them, expressed the opinion of the Court, that he was innocent. The Jury then withdrew, and after having chosen Mr. Simon Schermerhorn as their fore∣man, returned in about four or five minutes, with the verdict—NOT GUILTY.</P>
