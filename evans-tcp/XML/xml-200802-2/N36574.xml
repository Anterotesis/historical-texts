<HEAD>OF EDUCATION. <FIGURE>
</FIGURE> Emblem I.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>SEE in what evil plight yon vine appears,</L>
<L>nor spread∣ing leaves, nor purple cluster bears:—</L>
<L>But if around the elm her arm she throws,</L>
<L>or by some friendly prop supported 
<PB N="6" REF="047814_0005_1024AC8837364AE8"/> 
grows,</L>
<L>soon shall the stem be clad with foliage green,</L>
<L>and clustered grapes beneath the leaves be seen.—</L>
<L>Thus prudent care must rear the youthful mind,</L>
<L>by love supported, and with sense refin'd:</L>
<L>'Tis thus alone the human plant can rise,</L>
<L>Unprop'd it droops, and un∣supported dies.</L>
</LG>
<P>There cannot be a truer em∣blem of the state of infancy, than in this of the vine, which, when it is reared with care, rewards us with its luscious fruit; but, if neglected, pre∣sents us with nothing but leaves and stalks.</P>

<LG>
<L>OBSERVE, thou sluggard, but the little ant,</L>
<L>mid'st sum∣mer's plenty think of winter's want;</L>
<L>by constant journies careful to prepare her stores,</L>
<L>and bringing home the corny <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></L>
<L>lest it elude her care and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> again,</L>
<L>she bites the end of
<PB N="8" REF="047814_0007_1024AC8BE6BEEE18"/>
every little grain.</L>
<L>Behold each insect, how their deeds appear,</L>
<L>what marks of thought, con∣trivance, hope and fear.</L>
</LG>
<P>When we behold but the little, seemingly insignificant ant, what a moral and instruc∣tive lesson may be drawn from it, in that excellent proverb, "Employ well the hour pre∣sent." Idleness is the cause of many evils; it brings both mi∣sery and want; it destroys the health of body, and the peace of mind. But industry, besides giving us plenty, gives us health, without which there can be no solid enjoyment.</P>

<HEAD>Improvement. <FIGURE>
</FIGURE> Emblem III.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>SEE how the little bee em∣ploys her hours,</L>
<L>in sipping fragrance from the various flowers:</L>
<L>no plant, no herb, that nature's hand prepares,</L>
<L>but yields her honey to reward her cares.</L>
<L>Learn from the bee, from each event to find,</L>
<L>some
<PB N="10" REF="047814_0009_1024AC909A1936A0"/>
hint of use or profit to your mind.</L>
<L>Nothing so small but you may draw from thence</L>
<L>improvement for your virtue or your sense.</L>
<L>Honey like this life's evils will assuage,</L>
<L>and give you sweets in your declin∣ing age.</L>
</LG>
<P>The bee, like unto the ant, is one of those little insects that teaches us to provide in due time, what we may have occa∣sion for at a future period.—The bee is ever busy in the summer season, and there is no flower but yields something for their winter's support. Fol∣low her example.</P>

<LG>
<L>THE busy insect hovering round the light,</L>
<L>pleas'd with the taper's beams which gild the night,</L>
<L>still round and round in giddy circles flies,</L>
<L>till caught within the scorching blaze it dies.</L>
<L>Ah! silly thing, the source of all thy joy,</L>
<L>a
<PB N="13" REF="047814_0012_1024AC978E75D7E0"/>
beauteous mischief, shines but to destroy.—</L>
<L>Even so the youth who burns with wild desires,</L>
<L>oft falls the victim of un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al∣lowed fires.</L>
<L>Avoid the glit∣tering evil, shun the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</L>
<L>which sin and guilt for artless youth prepare;</L>
<L>lest with the moth one common fate you prove,</L>
<L>and perish by the ex∣cesses which you love.</L>
</LG>
<P>Shun all temptations, if you are wise, and be not deceived by appearances. Vice, folly and danger, lurk often under the most inviting charms.—</P>
<LG>
<L>Sweetest leaves the rose adorn,</L>
<L>Yet beneath they hide a thorn.</L>

<HEAD>Vain Pursuits. <FIGURE>
</FIGURE> Emblem VI.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>FROM sultry noon till night's dull shades descend,</L>
<L>behold the boy his fruitless chace attend;</L>
<L>To gain the insect's painted wings he flies,</L>
<L>and pleas'd at last obtains the gaudy prize;</L>
<L>but whilst its beauties he sur∣veys with joy,</L>
<L>those hands
<PB N="15" REF="047814_0014_1024AC9B61C04240"/>
which seize them fatally des∣troy.—</L>
<L>Even so those pleasures which we sigh to gain,</L>
<L>and sa∣crifice our quiet to obtain,</L>
<L>with gaudy flutterings tempt us to pursue,</L>
<L>but while we grasp them, vanish from our view;</L>
<L>or gain'd, but ill reward our labor past,</L>
<L>crush'd as we seize them by our eager haste.</L>
</LG>
<P>This is an apt emblem of the impetuosity of youth, who with a blind precipitancy pur∣sues vain pleasures, that can afford no solid enjoyment. Be moderate in the pursuit of pleasures, and you will then truly enjoy them.</P>
</DIV1>

<HEAD>Vain Glory. <FIGURE>
</FIGURE> Emblem VII.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>BEHOLD the silly bird, how proudly vain</L>
<L>of the bright co∣lours of his gaudy train!</L>
<L>Even to a proverb grown his idle pride,</L>
<L>by outward show alone is worth supplied;</L>
<L>for no har∣monious sound, no cheerful note,</L>
<L>must ever issue from that
<PB N="17" REF="047814_0016_1024ACA08412E860"/>
hideous throat;</L>
<L>nor of the hundred eyes that grace his tail,</L>
<L>can one for sight, or real use avail.—</L>
<L>O son of vanity, be wise in time!</L>
<L>apply the moral of this homely rhyme:</L>
<L>To real worth alone should praise be given,</L>
<L>for real worth inhe∣rits it from heaven.</L>
</LG>
<P>Like the proud peacock is the son of vanity; and surely it is more ridiculous in a ration∣al creature to indulge this pride than in an unreasonable ani∣mal. How worthless is man, however finely clad, without mental qualifications! A fine house unfurnished is but an un∣comfortable dwelling.</P>

<HEAD>Evil and its Punishment. <FIGURE>
</FIGURE> Emblem VIII.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHILE the sweet nightin∣gale chaunts forth her lays,</L>
<L>her warbling throat the hidden nest betrays,</L>
<L>eager to seize it hastes the thoughtless boy,</L>
<L>and all the mother's comfort to des∣troy;</L>
<L>when lo! the faithless branch in pieces broke,</L>
<L>his
<PB N="19" REF="047814_0018_1024ACA4691A79E8"/>
limbs are shattered with a dreadful stroke.—</L>
<L>So when we seek some dear prized joy to gain,</L>
<L>and buy our pleasure with another's pain,</L>
<L>our slippery steps to evil are betray'd,</L>
<L>we fall unpitied in the snare we made.</L>
</LG>
<P>This is a just emblem of those who seek their own good at the expence of that of others, and often meet with a bitter disappointment, and lament too late the evils which themselves have occasioned. Hence learn the danger of fraud, lest, like the boy in the emblem, you prove the author of your own destruction.</P>

<HEAD>Tyranny and Oppression. <FIGURE>
</FIGURE> Emblem IX.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>LO! the fierce lion, how he lordly stalks,</L>
<L>grimly majes∣tic in his lonely walks;</L>
<L>when round he looks, all living crea∣tures fly,</L>
<L>and clears the desert with his rowling eye.</L>
<L>By the pale moon he takes his destin'd round,</L>
<L>and lash'd his side, and
<PB N="21" REF="047814_0020_1024ACA970887428"/>
furious tears the ground,</L>
<L>while shrieks and dying groans the desert fill,</L>
<L>and rage and rend; their ravenous jaws distil</L>
<L>with crimson foam, and when the banquet's o'er,</L>
<L>he strides away, and paints his steps with gore.</L>
<L>In flight alone the shepherd puts his trust,</L>
<L>and shudders at the talons in the dust.</L>
</LG>
<P>The lion is a fit emblem of tyranny; his royalty consists in cruelty, strength, and pow∣er; in raising terror, instead of confidence and love; in be∣ing a destroyer, and not a safe∣guard; hence he is called the sovereign of the forrest.</P>

<HEAD>Temptation. <FIGURE>
</FIGURE> Emblem X.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE silly fish, while playing in the brook,</L>
<L>hath gorg'd and swallowed the destructive hook—</L>
<L>In vain he flounces on the quivering hair,</L>
<L>drawn panting forth to breathe the upper air.</L>
<L>Caught by his folly—in the glittering bait</L>
<L>he meets his ruin,
<PB N="23" REF="047814_0022_1024ACADDA5610C0"/>
and submits to fate.—</L>
<L>Avoid base bribes—The tempting lure display'd,</L>
<L>if once you taste you perish self-betray'd.</L>
<L>Be slow to take, when strangers haste to give,</L>
<L>lest of your ruin you the price receive.</L>
</LG>
<P>What a fit emblem is this of those heedless persons who suf∣fer themselves to be deluded by glittering temptations, or drawn into snares by the arti∣fices of the vicious and design∣ing! The offers of some men are dangerous; let the charac∣ter of the giver, and the con∣ditions he is likely to exact be well considered before you re∣ceive the gift.</P>

<L>LO! here the valiant twins whose glorious name</L>
<L>the poets consecrate to endless fame!—</L>
<L>Two bodies sway'd by one a∣greeing mind,</L>
<L>loving in life, and not in death disjoin'd.—</L>
<L>For feats of arms through all the world renown'd,</L>

<PB N="25" REF="047814_0024_1024ACB2CDECFCB8"/>
more, the brother chiefs were found:</L>
<L>Through life's whole race one common fate they share,</L>
<L>alike united, or in peace or war.—</L>
<L>Learn hence true friendship and fraternal love,</L>
<L>an offering grateful to the throne above.</L>
</LG>
<P>By this emblem we are in∣formed that man was by na∣ture framed for society, and that there can be no happiness without the benefit of friend∣ship. By this we mutually sup∣ply the wants of each other, and enjoy those blessings of life, which, without it, we could seldom purchase.</P>

<P>The dog is of all animals the most faithful and sagacious.—There are few things which a good dog may not be trained up to do to serve his master; and, if he be well used, there are fewer still that he will not do to defend him.</P>
<P>Gratitude and fidelity to our friends, are the best qualities that can adorn our natue. In this respect, the emblem of the dog is a very just one, and a good example for man.</P>

<L>THE tender pelican with ceaseless cares,</L>

<L>Emblem of heaven's supernal graces known</L>
<L><PB N="29" REF="047814_0028_1024ACBCABC717A0"/>
and parent's love to dearest children shewn.</L>
<L>To God a∣bove, and to your friends be∣low,</L>
<L>still let your breast with zeal and duty glow;</L>
<L>much to your parents, more to heaven you owe.</L>
</LG>
<P>The pelican is the only bird that feeds her young with her own blood. In this emblem is expressed the state of depend∣ence we are in, on the one hand, and the great goodness of God on the other, who e∣qually supplies our temporal and our spiritual wants, and who sent his only Son to be a propitiation for our sins, who
<PB N="30" REF="047814_0029_1024ACBECF266330"/>
for us shed his own blood, and by whose stripes we are healed—The pelican, indeed, grants this supply but to her own brood; but the great Author of our salvation did this for wicked offenders, he died e∣ven for his greatest enemies, and bore our sins, that we might be made righteous, and that we might proceed from grace to grace, till at last we are made heirs of his glorious inheritance.</P>
