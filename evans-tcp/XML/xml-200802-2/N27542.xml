<HEAD>THE Author wishing it may be improved and enlarged, by some abler pen, now calls in her mite, to the Memory of that worthy Person, whose Loss we severely feel.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>HANNAH WHEATON.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>MY FATHER! cries the <HI>United States,</HI></L>
<L>Pray leave us not our Guide and Light:</L>
<L>The shining Chariot swiftly rolls,</L>
<L>And takes the Patriot from our sight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Absorb'd in grief, with anxious hearts,</L>
<L>Each freeborn Son stands looking round,</L>
<L>In vain they ask in fruitless search,</L>
<L>Who has the sacred Mantle found?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come noble souls your tears refrain,</L>
<L>Take from your garb the sable hue,</L>
<L>Yonder! above Etherial Skies,</L>
<L>A brighter scene presents in view.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Celestial Gates unfold your leaves;</L>
<L>The Harpers strike their golden strings,</L>
<L>Around the Arch the music plays,</L>
<L>With shouts of joy the Palace rings.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thrice welcome from the dusky globe,</L>
<L>Victorious Hero of renown,</L>
<L>Faithful thou wast on Earth below,</L>
<L>Now take possession of a Crown.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This is the man who quell'd his foes,</L>
<L>In virtue's cause he boldly stood,</L>
<L>When danger star'd him in the face,</L>
<L>He valu'd not his dearest blood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A full reward he now shall meet,</L>
<L>For all the labours of his love:</L>
<L>Regale thy Soul with spicy fruits,</L>
<L>On banks of fair EMMANUEL's grove.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No longer let the Sacred Desks,</L>
<L>And walls in gloomy Sackcloth mourn,</L>
<L>Far distant dwells the immortal Man,</L>
<L>That from our eyes was lately borne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Cheer up brave Patriots, one and all,</L>
<L>The sacred Page a Cordial gives,</L>
<L>If GOD hides <HI>Moses</HI> for a while,</L>
<L>A Saviour <HI>Joshua</HI> for us lives.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Farewell! none shall his bliss envy,</L>
<L>Who soars beyond the Warriors noise,</L>
<L>No groans, or garments roll'd in blood,</L>
<L>Shall there molest his endless Joys.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>An heavenly Beam illumes our hearts,</L>
<L>We soon shall meet our Friend again</L>
<L>No more to feel a parting stroke,</L>
<L>But as triumphant Victors reign.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wrote on an <HI>adamantine Stone,</HI></L>
<L>Great WASHINGTON's dear name will stand;</L>
<L>Ages unborn may sing for joy,</L>
<L>His Wisdom sav'd our sinking Land.</L>
