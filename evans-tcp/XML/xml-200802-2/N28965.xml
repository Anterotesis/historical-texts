<HEAD>Eulogy.</HEAD>
<P>HOW great are the trophies of inexora∣ble Death! How honorable the tears of this great assembly! How expressive the symbols of public sorrow, which every where attract the eye! ILLUSTRIOUS SHADE, couldest thou descend from the high seats of glory, thou wouldest listen with complacence to the sighs of a mourning EMPIRE.</P>
<P>PIOUS gratitude, my FELLOW CITIZENS, has this day assembled us in the TEMPLE OF THE LORD OF HOSTS. As men, we ought to retrace the his∣tory of our obligations; and as Christians, it is our duty to imprint it on the tablet of memory. We have met to cultivate the best sensibilities of the soul; to indulge the luxury of sympathy; to muse on the recollection of greatness no more; and to embalm with our tears the URN OF THE VENERABLE WASHINGTON.</P>
<P>THIS example we were taught by ancient RE∣PUBLICS. At the public funeral of those ATHE∣NIANS, who were first slain in the war of PELO∣PONNESUS, an Eulogy to their memory was pro∣nounced by Pericles. It was to animate the living to imitate the virtues of the dead. Thus likewise, when the great soul of the first BRUTUS winged its flight to the enjoyment of celestial liberty, the
<PB N="4" REF="038623_0003_1012A9A5E848E978"/>
Councils of ROME ordained the most public testi∣monials of sorrow; and female beauty, in grief for the loss of its noble avenger, shrouded its charms in sackcloth.</P>
<P>GEORGE WASHINGTON was born Feb. 11, 1732, O. S. His early youth gave proofs that he possessed no common mind. At the age of fif∣teen▪ he received a naval commission; but paren∣tal affection, or rather the destinies of Heaven, re∣served him for a nobler fate. The ILLUSTRIOUS HERO, whom we this day celebrate, commenced his public career by a commission to Canada, then under the dominion of FRANCE. He discharged this trust with industry, intelligence, and address. His military talents were first displayed in the field where fell the unfortunate Braddock: and here the tried courage of veterans confessed its inferi∣ority to his youth. In 1759, disease threatened his precious life; but Virtue watched over her son, and he lived, that he might die with the blessings of millions. He progressed in life honor∣ably and honored. As an instructor in arms, a representative of <HI>Freemen,</HI> and a guardian of jus∣tice, he shone conspicuous. Fortune, virtue, and domestic joys,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He married Mrs. Custis, who is still living.</NOTE> were his friends, and all united to make him happy.</P>
<P>ROUSED from these peaceful scenes by the voice of his country's wrongs, and placed by CONGRESS at the head of an army, scarcely in being, without arms, undisciplined, and strong only in the good∣ness of its cause, he accepted the trust with that
<PB N="5" REF="038623_0004_1012A9AA1B6653F8"/>
modesty, which is the companion of true greatness. When the important commission was presented him by the President of Congress, on the success of which, in the view of an ill-judging world, de∣pended his glory or his infamy, "Sir," said he, "though I am truly sensible of the high honor done me in this appointment, yet I feel great distress, from a consciousness that my abilities and military experience may not be equal to the extensive and important trust. And lest some unlucky event should happen, unfavorable to my reputation, I beg it may be remembered by ev∣ery gentleman in the room, that I this day de∣clare, with the utmost sincerity, that I do not think myself equal to the command I am hon∣ored with."</P>
<P>IN the prosecution of our great and glorious revolutionary war, what a field of triumph opens on the mind! I might show our HERO struggling with difficulties, which, to minds less than his, would have been insuperable; I might point to him, great in victory, but greater in misfortune. With the fortitude of CAESAR, the prudence of FABIUS, and the unyielding virtue of OLD REGU∣LUS, he sternly buffetted the adverse waves of war. And ye, his companions, ye noble defenders of our country's rights; while we weep over the tomb of your IMMORTAL CHIEF, your services are deep∣ly engraved on our hearts, and your honor will ever be dear to fame.</P>
<P>AT the close of the AMERICAN REVOLUTION, a circumstance occurred, in which General WASH∣INGTON
<PB N="6" REF="038623_0005_1012A9ABAAACB2A8"/>
displayed a moderation, fortitude, and patriotism, unrivalled in the most virtuous peri∣od of antiquity. Deep discontent had pervaded the ranks of the army. This spirit threatened to destroy the TREE OF INDEPENDENCE, just trans∣planted into our soil, before we had tasted its fruit. Had not OUR HERO loved his country, more than the most splendid title of dignity; had he possess∣ed a soul like that of CAESAR; he would have seized this happy moment, and assumed the <HI>Impe∣rial Authority.</HI> He might then have been number∣ed among the successful conquerors of others; but his glory aspired to the more difficult, and far nobler conquest of himself. He assembled around him his veteran brothers; a tear, such as angels shed at spectacles of human weakness, dropped on his venerable cheek; he spoke to them of the in∣trigues of emissaries, of the honor of soldiers, and of the duty of citizens. He spoke to the reason, but awoke every passion. He retired—it was the voice of their father, which they had been accus∣tomed to obey; and they instantly <HI>Resolved,</HI> THAT THE ARMY CONTINUED TO HAVE AN UNSHAKEN CONFIDENCE IN THE JUSTICE OF CONGRESS AND THEIR COUNTRY.</P>
<P>THIS great EXEMPLAR of precept had now on∣ly to crown his military, by a brilliant display of civic virtues. VERNON'S EDEN received the AMERICAN CINCINNATUS; but its peaceful shades served only to increase the lustre of his laurels. It was the roof of hospitality, the delightful residence of sentiment and virtue. Thither resorted the
<PB N="7" REF="038623_0006_1012A9AD3A21A338"/>
Philosopher and Traveller; for WASHINGTON was the <HI>Star,</HI> which attracted the "wise men" of the world. Even KINGS and POTENTATES paid homage to his virtues, reflecting by this some share of glory on themselves.</P>
<P>WERE I here to finish the portrait, I should do injustice to the character of one, whom all the world admires. If as a SOLDIER he excelled, as a SENATOR he astonished; if as a WARRIOR he was magnanimous, as a STATESMAN he was profound. His activity and bravery in the field rendered him an HOST, and his sagacity in the cabinet rais∣ed him superior to all political delusion. His wis∣dom regulated the decisions of jarring councils; his goodness charmed the affections of the people, and his ARM crushed their enemies. Faithful to his GOD, could he be unfaithful to his COUNTRY? Not malignity, not calumny, nor envy, which loves to prey on goodness, can charge him with one habitual vice.</P>
<P>AS PRESIDENT of the CONVENTION, which formed our NATIONAL CONSTITUTION, he gave it his entire approbation; and perhaps it is not too much to say, that to this circumstance it owed its establishment. AMERICANS, this is the great pal∣ladium of your honor and felicity; it connects liberty with honor, the happiness with the rights of Citizens. It is an experiment on the question, whether mankind can bear to be free. Let me tell you, if you suffer foreign or domestic in∣trigues to wrest this invaluable inheritance from your hands, you will richly deserve to be <HI>Slaves.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="038623_0007_1012A9B178DFE7F0"/>
AMONG the many illustrious characters, who had distinguished themselves in our glorious strug∣gle for Independence, WASHINGTON was so pre-eminent, that all eyes were turned to him as a common centre; and twice, by the unanimous suffrages of the nation, he was declared the RULER OF THE FREE.</P>
<P>AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, how important were his services! I trust while grati∣tude is a virtue, we shall not forget them. In this, were it possible, rather than in his military character, he is justly esteemed the INSTRUMEN∣TAL SAVIOUR OF HIS COUNTRY.</P>
<P>AS a FRIEND OF VIRTUE, he firmly opposed the Atheistical opinions of the day; as a PATRIOT, he presented his breast to the dangers, which threat∣ened his country's peace. To him, the voice of the people was always an interesting considera∣tion; but though few among the great can resist the charms of popular applause, though none ever enjoyed more popularity than WASHINGTON, yet HE ever preferred the dictates of his own in∣corruptible mind, to the violence of the inconstant multitude. At a moment, when foreign intrigue succeeded, when the popular passions were raised into a ferment, he was requested not to do<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sanction the British Treaty by his signature.</NOTE> what his sound judgment dictated: he firmly replied, <HI>I have determined on the duty before me.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The President's Answer to various Addresses.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN the Address to the people of these States, de∣clining again their suffrages, he seemed to concen∣trate all his great qualities. It has justly been es∣teemed
<PB N="9" REF="038623_0008_1012A9B5A7F50100"/>
the LEGACY OF A FATHER. It has been preserved in the archives of our country; let it be deeply engraved on our minds; for the heart which conceived it ceases to beat, and the hand which wrote it will rise no more. He retired again.—I ask you, my fellow-citizens, did not our prayers go with him? did we not all say, 'Peace to the HERO'S rest? May guardian spirits watch his declining years, and may his grey heirs, <HI>with∣out</HI> sorrow, come to the grave!' But before he was to be called to the communion of CELESTIAL SPIRITS, his war-worn sinews were again to renew their youthful vigor, and again he rose with the Fabii and Decii to avenge his country's wrongs.</P>
<P>IN his Letter to PRESIDENT ADAMS, in which he accepts the command of the American armies, he displays that same unappalled courage, that strength of intellect, and that zeal for his coun∣try's honor, which had formerly been exerted with success against the power of GREAT BRITAIN. "The conduct," says he, "of the DIRECTORY OF FRANCE towards our country; their insidious hostility to its government; their various prac∣tices to withdraw the affections of the people from it; the evident tendency of their acts, and those of their agents, to countenance and invigorate op∣position; their disregard of solemn treaties, and the law of nations; their war upon our defence∣less commerce; their treatment of our ministers of peace; and their demands amounting to trib∣ute, could not fail to excite in my mind, corres∣ponding sentiments with those my countrymen
<PB N="10" REF="038623_0009_1012A9B737371608"/>
have so generally expressed, in their affectionate addresses to you. Believe me, Sir, no one can more cordially approve of the wise and prudent measures of your administration. Satisfied that you have sincerely wished for peace, and endeav∣ored to avert war, and exhausted to the <HI>last drop</HI> the cup of reconciliation, we can with pure hearts appeal to Heaven for the justice of our cause." With what spirit did this appointment animate every class of citizens; America seemed to possess one soul. The young men assumed the soldier's character, and even the enfeebled veteran grasped his arms, which he had fondly hoped would rust in quiet.</P>
<P>AND why do I hear the solemn knell of death? Why am I surrounded with these habiliments of the grave? Why that gloom on your counte∣nances? Why that involuntary tear, which I see start from your eyes? I hear the sad response, OUR FATHER IS NO MORE.</P>
<P>HIS FRIENDS and COMPANIONS IN ARMS encir∣cle his grave. You have seen him, like some su∣perior form, leading you to glory and victory. You have heard him in the embattled ranks, an∣imating you to contest by motives of duty and patriotism; and you have seen him weep over the soldier's wounds. <HI>"How have the mighty fallen!"</HI> That countenance which beamed benevolence, and that stature which inspired confidence, lie shrouded in death. VERNON, from the PARADISE, is converted into the MAUSOLEUM of AMERICA. Its trophies are now the trophies of death. But
<PB N="11" REF="038623_0010_1012A9BA2468E470"/>
we will not forget thee. The tomb of WASH∣INGTON shall be the ALTAR of LIBERTY. When ages on ages have revolved, when we and our children are numbered with the silent dead, thith∣er will resort the friends of freedom; and while his happy spirit beholds with complacency the af∣fecting scene, they will appeal to Heaven, that they will save their country.</P>
<P>MY FELLOW-CITIZENS, by whose appointment I stand in this place, will accept my sincere condo∣lence on this solemn and affecting occasion. It is the last tribute of respect, which we can pay to the memory of a MAN, who still lives enthroned in all our hearts. It is respectful to the revered deceas∣ed, and is it not honorable to our nature? Yes, our tears are honorable to ourselves! Could our WASHINGTON once more address us from the BRIGHT ARMIES of the SKY, what would he say? 'Weep not for me, my children. Your individ∣ual and political happiness depends on your rev∣erence to GOD, and your devotion to your coun∣try. Cherish the virtues, and obey the laws. Watch, as with an eagle's eye, against the in∣trigues of demagogues; and let it be written on your hearts, as with "the point of a diamond," that <HI>foreign influence is the destroying angel of Re∣publics.'</HI></P>
<P>THE YOUNGER CITIZENS demand our sympa∣thy and attention. Respect for the character, gratitude for the services, and grief for the death of your POLITICAL PARENT, has covered you with mourning. When yet in infancy, before
<PB N="12" REF="038623_0011_1012A9BD0A81F4E8"/>
time had brought into exercise the reflective fac∣ulties, or reason in any degree had matured judg∣ment; HE was in the field, fighting your cause, and defending your rights. If ever your sensibilities were awakened, it must be on this occasion; for you have cause to weep. Study, my young friends, the HERO'S LEGACY; it will shew you the true interest of your country, and make you po∣litically wife. Let the impressive solemnities of this day be fixed on your minds. And as the most sacred of all duties, as you regard the dear∣est interests of yourselves and country, preserve your minds uncontaminated by the religious and political heresies of the day, which will inevitably lead to the destruction of all government, of all so∣cial order, and of public happiness.</P>
<P>WE pass to the closing scene. The AMERICAN FABIUS died as he lived, calm and resigned. As though common mortality must not approach de∣parting glory, his own <HI>firm hands</HI> performed to himself the last sad office of humanity!</P>
<P>SHADES of WARREN, MERCER, GREENE, and MONTGOMERY! a KINDRED SOUL arrives! it is your CHIEF! 'tis WASHINGTON! Rest, GREAT SPIRIT, in thy native skies; sleep sweet, till the ARCHANGEL sound:—But thy name we will re∣member; thy deeds, thy greatness, thy virtues, we will affectionately cherish, and "tell them to our children's children."</P>
