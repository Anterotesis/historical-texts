<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>ISAIAH xxviii. 26.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>For his God doth instruct him to discretion, and doth teach him.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ALL who acknowledge God to be the Crea∣tor of man, and that He commands his birth in the division of the earth he chooses, toge∣ther with the peculiar circumstances in which he is placed, will hear our text as the voice of indis∣putable truth when addressed to any individual of mankind. "His God doth instruct him to dis∣cretion, and teach him:" He affords him both speculative knowledge, and ingenuity to improve it to wise and useful ends.</P>
<P>How far <HI>minds</HI> may be equal in an independent state, is one of those abstruse questions which <HI>we</HI> have not abilities to ascertain.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="036896_0003_100B2E8ABB3CCB80"/>
But this we know, putting aside all our own exertions, there are innumerable differences be∣tween men—their tastes, their discretion, their capacity of instruction, and their improvements—which we cannot but think are greatly owing to causes which we can neither controul nor direct—to the peculiar formation of our bodies, to the climate where we are born, the circumstances in which we are stationed; to peculiar conjunctures favourable to the display of our particular abilities. The objects of knowledge and discretion to which some are passionately attached, and which they learn to comprehend with great ease, others turn from with indifference and disgust: in their nature and use it seems impossible to instruct them, unless we could communicate to them powers which they have not, or have but in a very feeble degree. Some are born into, and are continued in, situations which are unfavourable to their in∣struction, though their faculties are strong; they are like the diamond in the quarry, which cannot display its brilliancy for want of light and the polish of the artist. Great numbers, no doubt,
<PB N="5" REF="036896_0004_100B2E8D5B7EE120"/>
of this class die in every quarter of the earth, who neither suspect themselves their abilities of emi∣nence and usefulness, nor are esteemed by those around them above the rank of ordinary men. Some, though they have been in an indulgent situation for the acquisition of knowledge, and the discreet use of it; and, had they been called to action in circumstances favourable to their use∣fulness and fame, would have made a conspicuous figure in the world, and been distinguished bles∣sings, have by an uniform series of events been hindered any striking exhibition of themselves. If these remarks are just, and we feel their force, must we not promptly say, with deep-felt humility, and lively gratitude, that "God doth instruct us to discretion, and doth teach us," while with vigo∣rous zeal we devote ourselves to his honour and service? Did not He give us our constitution of body, united with the strength of our minds, and the liveliness of our imagination? Has not He blessed us with the health necessary to our enjoy∣ment, and the successful improvement of our abi∣lities? He appoints the place of our birth, either
<PB N="6" REF="036896_0005_100B2E8EDF0E9F60"/>
in barbarous climes which knowledge never en∣lightened, the very air of which enervates the soul; where, if any, there is but a feeble stimulus to the exertions which render men great, amiable and good; or in a situation which fosters both bodily and mental vigour, and where all causes conspire to render us the ornaments of human nature, and the blessings of mankind. He orders "the times and the seasons," in the exercise of his sovereign wis∣dom, so as to bring forward our discretion and va∣rious knowledge in those striking attitudes which raise our reputation and fortune high, and give us a benignant influence upon the worth and hap∣piness of our fellow men; or, continues us in cir∣cumstances which doom us to concealment and inaction, while we are conscious of those excellent powers which, indulged, would greatly benefit our country, and gloriously distinguish ourselves.</P>
<P>Nor may we conclude, as we shall be apt to do if we think but superficially upon this subject, that, because we are ultimately indebted to God for our discretion and mental improvement, it is therefore wholly unnecessary we should labour to acquire
<PB N="7" REF="036896_0006_100B2E9096787CB8"/>
them by the exercise of the original powers He gave us, which grow with our growth, and render us capable of increasing judgment and knowledge: For He—and certainly He has a right to convey his undeserved blessings to his creatures in the mode He chooses—has seen fit inseparably to con∣nect these together. God has seen fit to command us "to lift up our voices for understanding, and search for wisdom as for hidden treasure," whom we are sacredly bound to obey, by the principles of duty, and the motives of honour and happiness.</P>
<P>Having made these observations, always impor∣tant, I shall now lead you to a consideration of several ways in which the ALL-WISE AND BENE∣FICENT BEING, who rules over all, "instructs men to discretion," and teaches them how to in∣crease the security and welfare of the societies to which they belong, and the individuals with whom they are intimately connected, and to secure and promote their future happiness as accountable be∣ings. I shall conclude with several practical reflec∣tions upon the effects which the liberal distribution of His invaluable gifts in our NATION should have
<PB N="8" REF="036896_0007_100B2E95023381D0"/>
upon our minds, affections and actions. Nor shall I fail to make honourable mention of the Great and Good Man who has lately "fallen in our Israel, and for whom the whole land so sincerely mourns."</P>
<P>We consider, then—</P>
<P>I. Several ways in which the ALL-WISE AND BENEFICENT BEING, who rules over all, "instructs men to discretion, and teaches them" how to in∣crease the security and welfare of the societies to which they belong, and the individuals with whom they are intimately connected; to secure and pro∣mote their future happiness as accountable beings.</P>
<P>FIRST. Our text is spoken by the prophet of the Farmer; and therefore AGRICULTURE will claim our attention before any other kind of in∣struction which God has given our race. By agri∣culture in a large sense is meant a judicious method of preparing the earth for the reception of seeds, and dressing the fruits she yields so as to be fit for the food and nourishment of man. This was, after man became ignorant and barbarous in any of those abodes to which he wandered from the state of civilized knowledge, however familiar the busi∣ness
<PB N="9" REF="036896_0008_100B2E97716CADF0"/>
may have become to us, who have by long experience been better instructed, esteemed the most useful art of which he could be made master. In the mere savage state we should be in frequent want of the necessaries of life; we should be obli∣ged to seek a precarious and unplentiful subsistence with incessant labour; and ofttimes would our most painful searches be wholly in vain: we should esteem him, therefore, in this state of morti∣fication and want, the most eminent of our num∣ber, and hail him our first benefactor, who should teach us the discretion necessary to cultivate the soil, and cause it to yield a sufficiency of food to satisfy the cravings of hunger, and invigorate our bodies.</P>
<P>In the short history we have of our first parent there are expressions which admit not of an easy ex∣planation, unless we suppose he was peculiarly taught of God this most useful art. Before his creation, it is there said, "there was not a man to <HI>till</HI> the ground." But, uninformed either by ob∣servation of other men, or by his own experience, how to perform this important work, whence
<PB N="10" REF="036896_0009_100B2E995AFB4D88"/>
could he derive his knowledge but from his Maker? After his creation, we are told also, "the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it, and to keep it." This knowledge he no doubt communicated to his immediate de∣scendants, and they to theirs. Yet some of his chil∣dren, in the successive ages since his day, have through misfortune and distress sunk into the pure state of ignorance and barbarity, and lost, almost entirely, this beneficial art. The wise and good, who have entered amongst tribes of men in so de∣graded and afflictive a condition, have taught them agriculture, as a most efficient means of their civi∣lization, and of increase to the comforts of their lives, as tenants of the earth. Duly appreciating the benefit, they have esteemed themselves under such immense obligations of reverence and grati∣tude to them for their lessons, and the happy alte∣ration they have made in their modes of life, that they have hailed them divine persons, who have visited the earth for their good. They have conse∣crated their memory with religious honours, though they were in reality only men better taught than
<PB N="11" REF="036896_0010_100B2E9C343F9858"/>
themselves by God, who alone deserves adoration. Agriculture indeed ought ever to rank in our minds as a most valuable species of knowledge communi∣cated to us by the Father of our spirits. Under her benignant influence "the wilderness becomes a fruitful field, and the desert blossoms as the rose;" man lives without constant dread of want, and is far more agreeably fed and clothed; his body and his mind both are pleasingly and honourably employed in obedience to her direction; and in a way which tends powerfully to the common and universal good of his race with whom he has any communication.</P>
<P>SECOND. Military discretion seems, in the course of things, to have been taught men by their Divine Instructor, next to the knowledge how, pro∣fitably, to cultivate the earth. Universal history proves whereever tribes of men have by their know∣ledge and industry acquired a fruitful inheritance, there have been other tribes around, who, either from the motives of ambition and power or the desire of more plentiful accommodation, have at∣tempted, when artful measures have failed of the
<PB N="12" REF="036896_0011_100B2E9F35F74EC0"/>
end, to gain the dominion over them by violence. We may exclaim, Alas! why do men increase the miseries of their present existence by the harsh ca∣lamities of war, when evil enough are our days without them? Why do they shorten each others' lives, when they will quickly go down to the grave, though they have nothing singular to hasten them? We may pray, and we ought to pray with fer∣vency, that the just, the mild, the benevolent re∣ligion of Christ may prevail, aud men learn war no more. We may join our reasonings and ad∣vices to succeed its complete influence; and we ought to do it, because no order of things would more advance the tranquillity and happiness of mankind. But still God hath given us abilities to learn the regular processes, aud the various stra∣tagems, of attack and defence: "He hath taught our hands to war, and our fingers to fight." The course of the Divine Providence seems also to prove, that we must make use with spirit of the ar∣mour which is given us, in every just and honour∣able method, during the continuance of the present corruption of human nature, until it is essentially
<PB N="13" REF="036896_0012_100B2EA2D485BD08"/>
altered for the better, unless we are willing to be oppressed, to be slaves, and miserable. Hence we find, that upon necessary occasions men in ge∣neral are easily roused to war, and soon learn to perform its duties, as well as bear its hardships. Nor doth the Wise and Beneficent Being, who rules over all, and tenderly regards his injured creatures, fail to raise up for them on such emer∣gences intelligent commanders, and celebrated generals, to guide and direct them.</P>
<P>THIRD. After men have taken up their abode together in a situation which they have chosen, enjoy a fair and good inheritance, and are able to defend themselves in their possession, still they need interesting instruction from God, their great Teacher. If they are at all worthy their lot, they will wish to be acquainted with constitutions of civil government favourable to their freedom and happiness; and with the peculiar motives which, placed before the minds and passions of those raised to their administration, shall render them content with their legitimate reverence, honours, and support, while with unremitted fidelity they
<PB N="14" REF="036896_0013_100B2EA535806558"/>
exert themselves for the public safety and happi∣ness. With extensive, beautiful and luxuriant territory, with numbers and martial skill equal to their defence and aggrandizement, while alone, they may yet mourn the choicest blessings of soci∣ety. But, when to these are added well-chosen and equal governments, carried into effect by well-improved, just and patriotic men, they then have as much security and enjoyment as public bodies of men can have in this state of imperfection. Yea, wise and equal government, with intelligent, faith∣ful and kind rulers, softens the harshest climates, fructifies barren soils, inspires man with the love of country, and causes him to rejoice in circumstances naturally calculated to dispirit him, and render him habitually unhappy.</P>
<P>The knowledge which produces this admirable order is slow in its growth, and sparingly diffused amongst the inhabitants of the earth; owing either to indisposition on the side of those in power, or to the necessity and indolence of their subjects. Until within a short period of time a well-balanced government has not been contemplated by the
<PB N="15" REF="036896_0014_100B2EA6F6E8C340"/>
human mind, like other objects which are inti∣mately connected with the improvement and feli∣city of man. The governments which illustrate this idea are rare, amidst the innumerable ones which would be made use of to show, in a pointed view, how vastly important to the dignity and hap∣piness of mankind that it should be universally realized, in the authorities which govern them.</P>
<P>There is perhaps in all civilized countries, blest with the means of good education, a sufficient number of wise and faithful men, who, invited from their retirement, and patronized, would produce forms of government in theory excellent, and which, in operation, would yield them quietude and freedom, order and prosperity. If they are not brought forth to this good work, through the influence of causes so commanding that it would be imprudence and madness to counteract them, the evil must be borne with resignation, as an evil which the Supreme Ruler ordains or permits, in abatement of their worth and felicity. But if this failure is owing to their neg∣ligence, and unworthy attachment to their in∣dividual
<PB N="16" REF="036896_0015_100B2EA940943180"/>
interests, or the interest of any particular order to which they belong, all they lose and suffer must be charged to a degree of criminality which deserves his rebuke and chastisement.</P>
<P>FOURTH. COMMERCE and the ARTS are cheerfully embraced and improved by individuals and nations in situations which are favourable to their acquisition and growth. Commerce they prize a fruitful source of private and national wealth, which they dearly love for the distinction, splendour and varied enjoyments it so liberally confers. The arts increase their necessaries and conveniences, and greatly embellish human life; they are therefore objects of their strong desires. And who, that passes over the chart of the world with attention, but will be convinced that, where-ever the Father and Benefactor of men has allotted them habitations indulgent to commerce and the arts, he has given them, though in different de∣grees, discretion and spirit to gain and advantage∣ously exert themselves in their improvement?</P>
<P>FIFTH. Nations, in proportion as they be∣come civilized, and engage in the profitable and
<PB N="17" REF="036896_0016_100B2EAC4C6B7180"/>
ornamental businesses of life, esteem the means of a good and useful, a more improved and liberal education amongst the important blessings which their God confers upon them. As the stages of society advance, we find we are not accomplished for our condition, unless we have the knowledge of language and figures. Without these, we may have pleasing persons, agreeable qualities, and sound understanding; and yet shall be compara∣tively despised. We cannot, though every thing else should favour us, rise beyond very lowly cir∣cumstances. Yet a young man, who is only master of these branches of knowledge, and yet ris∣es to easy circumstances; who has mental industry, and has ardent wishes to know all that the most enlightened men know, may rise to their state of in∣tellectual improvement. Such examples, however, are very uncommon. Nations well instructed therefore in the best-appointed means of public and private knowledge, connected with individual reputation and enjoyment, as well as the general security and welfare, have made ample provision
<PB N="18" REF="036896_0017_100B2EADCFBCF610"/>
for the higher grades of education, which those may improve who have inclination and taste.</P>
<P>SIXTH. God has taught his children of man∣kind the divine and moral knowledge they possess, which tends to the purification of their hearts, and their progress in virtue; which blesses them, whenever it has its suitable effect upon them, with peace and joy in this state, and prepares them for higher felicity in future scenes of existence. This he has done in sundry ways, and in different proportions, as has seemed best to his unsearchable understanding. Some he has instructed in these important truths only by their reason, conscience, and moral feelings, aided by the labours of philosophers. Holy men, righteous patriarchs, and inspired prophets, have been his teachers to a different division of the human race; while others, in which number we are, through his discri∣minating bounty, are more highly illuminated by Jesus, the Great Light of the moral world. The design of this varied instruction is to encourage us to virtue as our highest health and happiness, to excite within us an expectation, notwithstand∣ing
<PB N="19" REF="036896_0018_100B2EB010B20858"/>
we must perish here, yet that we shall live for∣ever hereafter in a state of just retribution; an ex∣pectation which communicates superior vigour to the motives of virtue, and the dissuasives from vice. However incompetent we may be to judge why; however firm our conviction that the Judge of all the earth can be neither unjust nor cruel; yet we must acknowledge the disciples of Christ are far better taught in religion and virtue than the rest of their fellow-creatures have been, or are now; have more powerful motives and assis∣tances to well doing; have a future state of reward and punishment placed before them in a much clearer, more splendid and more influential light.</P>
<P>Thus I have considered mankind "instructed to discretion, and taught" by their God, in several views which are calculated to inspire us with the liveliest sentiments of gratitude and love to Him for his goodness, and to engage us to serve Him with constant fidelity. I proceed, as was pro∣posed in the second place—</P>
<P>II. To several practical reflections upon the influence which the liberal distribution God has
<PB N="20" REF="036896_0019_100B2EB28100CE30"/>
made in our nation of his invaluable gifts, should have upon our minds, affections, and manners.</P>
<P>FIRST. When we consider the degree of knowledge of our national interests, and disposi∣tion well to improve it, which God has kindly communicated to us—should we not address him with unfeigned thanksgiving and praise?</P>
<P>Agriculture, commerce, military and naval science, accompanied with rapidly-increasing num∣bers of hardy sons; a just and enlarged acquain∣tance with civil obligations and rights, and there∣fore of the line which forever distinguishes liberty from licentiousness; constitutions of government which are the genuine offspring of such knowledge, administred by men of our own election, and removeable at our choice, whenever they betray their trust; advantages of education, rising gradually from the lowest to the highest form; a religion pure and beneficent, which frowns upon vice, and encourages piety and virtue with those alarming considerations which tend to render us good citizens of particular societies here, and of the great society hereafter formed out of
<PB N="21" REF="036896_0020_100B2EB5CAA3DC98"/>
"every nation, kingdom, and tongue;"—These, these are now operative causes, in the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, which will, unless we basely counteract them, render us a virtuous and happy, a great and powerful nation. Often should we meditate upon these rich and undeserved bles∣sings of the Divine Providence and Grace, and, whenever we do, we should say, with exulting and grateful spirits, "Bless the Lord, O our souls, and let his praise be continually upon our lips."</P>
<P>SECOND. We ought ever to remember with honour and affectionate gratitude those who, though now removed from this world by the wise providence of God, yet have passed through life "instructed to discretion, and taught by Him," and have uniformly exerted their abilities for the safety and prosperity of their country.</P>
<P>Be this, our hearts immediately rejoin, thy praise, O WASHINGTON! The grave now shrouds thee from our sight! No more shalt thou be in∣strumental on earth in doing us good! But we will still draw thee up before us by the aid of ima∣gination; we will behold thee with increasing sa∣tisfaction
<PB N="22" REF="036896_0021_100B2EB7573669D0"/>
and delight: never will we behold thee, but we will praise thee?</P>
<P>General WASHINGTON was truly a great and good man. While history records the truth, his character will ever stand super-eminently high; and in every country where her pages are read he will be esteemed and admired. But the view of him, which must most endear him to us, is that of the Father of this People, their constantly active and powerful friend, both in the quietude of retire∣ment, and amidst the threatening evils of war. Though, at home, independent in his circum∣stances, happy in his family, respected and loved by all around him, yet, whenever called upon by his country, he has cheerfully resigned ease, and en∣joyments which were dear to him, and devoted himself to her interests. Call after call he has ne∣ver disobeyed. His fortitude has borne him through hardships oftentimes very severe. He al∣ways exerted his good sense, his amiable qualities, his military skill and bravery, to render his nation independent and prosperous. He was a great farmer, he was a friend to commerce and the arts,
<PB N="23" REF="036896_0022_100B2EB9F6F08F58"/>
a friend to useful education and literature, a friend to christianity; to the purity of heart and excel∣lent manners which she enjoins—<HI>The Man</HI> pre∣destined in the counsels of God, which take in all ages, from the beginning of time, until time shall be no more, to be at the head of the new empire in the new world: an empire which cannot fail to rise to great celebrity while its rulers and people continue to follow his wise and good example. He died with the same greatness he had lived. We are told, by an authority which we cannot dispute, "His last scene corresponded with the whole tenour of his life. Not a groan, not a com∣plaint, escaped him, though in extreme distress. With perfect resignation, and a full possession of his reason, he closed his well spent life." Yet, no doubt, with fervent prayer, at this awful season, with more fervency than he ever before experienced, he failed not to entreat the forgiveness and mercy of his God—and added still—O Great Protector of men, and Friend of human happiness, continue to preserve and bless my country! Shall we ever forget affectionately to remember and praise this
<PB N="24" REF="036896_0023_100B2EBBB9619B10"/>
man? No—each one of us should reply for him∣self—"If I forget thee, let my right hand forget her cunning. If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth."</P>
<P>THIRD. Could this great and good person au∣dibly address our nation, assembled in the act of mourning for his departure, would he not thus ad∣dress us?—My countrymen and friends! I more delight in your freedom, stability and happiness, than in any thing human! The fabled pulpits—the mourning bells—the slow-sounding artillery—the sad countenance so universally spread amongst you in consequence of my death, I esteem high testimonials of your respect and affection for me. But the best and most sincere respect ye can pay my memory is, the treasuring up my advices in your hearts, joined with obedience to them in your lives. <HI>Let no arts persuade you to loosen your</HI> UNION. <HI>Treat all other nations with justice and kindness; but impressively remember, this is your nation, and sacrifice not her interests from predilection to any other. Be eco∣nomical, industrious, punctual. Take care that the fear of God, and those works of righteousness, are a∣mongst
<PB N="25" REF="036896_0024_100B2EBF8BF9B068"/>
you, the fruits of which "are peace, quietness and assurance forever.</HI>" Can we hearken to more salutary advice? Can we more properly testify our esteem and love for our departed Chief, than by steady obedience to his excellent counsels?</P>
<P>FOURTH. If we improve with fidelity the know∣ledge and advantages we enjoy, we may firmly hope we shall never want statesmen and military commanders "instructed by their God to discre∣tion, and taught" how to defend us in time of danger, and lead us on to continued safety and prosperity. From the PRESIDENCY through the various important departments of GOVERNMENT we have persons of approved talents and integrity to rule over us, at the present time. Who will question the skill and bravery of our Land and Sea Officers whenever they shall be called into action? "Our Fathers have told us" upon how many oc∣casions God appeared for their deliverance when there was seen before them no human resource of safety. His loving kindness and tender mercies have repeatedly been displayed towards this people during our own experience. Why then should we mistrust his continued protection and blessing?
<PB N="26" REF="036896_0025_100B2EC10F8A8400"/>
No doubt He will continue our friend and bounti∣ful benefactor, until we basely forsake our duty and our happiness.—I conclude.</P>
<P>My conclusion will be in honour of JESUS CHRIST. He was the Wisdom of God in the most emphatical sense of the terms. For our sakes he left the highest honours of heaven; "he became a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; strick∣en, smitten of God, and afflicted," that he might enlighten, purify and save us. We ought there∣fore to venerate, love and obey him with far more reverence, affection and zeal than we do any other instructor and friend in our form. The MEMORI∣AL of his death and benefits some of us are soon to enter upon. I pray God there may soon be a lar∣ger number to "do this in remembrance of him."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was Communion Day.</NOTE> His religion affords us the highest consolation and joy upon such instances of mortality as we are this day peculiarly called to mourn. With respect to himself he says, "Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life that I might take it again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself: I have power to lay it down, and
<PB N="27" REF="036896_0026_100B2EC29AFEC828"/>
I have power to take it again. This command∣ment have I received of my Father." With respect to his followers he says, "I am the Resurrection and the Life;" and assures us, all the just shall be raised incorruptible and immortal. When his dis∣ciples began to degenerate, and grow less mindful of his instructions, he commanded his beloved John thus to address the churches: "I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord, from henceforth: yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their la∣bours; and their works do follow them."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"There was solemn Music adapted to these words after the Sermon.</NOTE> May these assurances rejoice our hearts when we con∣template the wise, the good, and the great, under the dominion of death: may they engage us all, in our several characters and relations, to act a wise, good and christian part here, that we may hereafter, in our several measures, partake with them in their joys, through the mercy of God in Him who lov∣ed us, and died for us.</P>
