<HEAD>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>T was foretold &amp; Prophesied of, in <HI>Joel</HI> 2 28, 29 How that <HI>the Lord would pour out His Spirit upon all Flesh, and that the Sons and Daughters of His People should Prophesie and their Old Men should dream Dreams, and their Young Men should see Visions. and also that upon the Servants and Hand∣maids He would pour out His Spirit.</HI> If it be now in sundry Places of this Land so, that they behold in any Remarkable manner and measure the Accom∣plishment of that Prophecy and Promise, as it is in∣deed very credibly Reported to be so with sundry Places, I can the more easily Credit such a matter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>m <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>stance of Mrs. <HI>Elisabeth</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th Relate and set forth.</P>
<P>These mentioned Persons were formerly of the Church of CHRIST here in <HI>Ashford</HI>; and the mentio∣ned Mr <HI>John Mixer</HI> was the first <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acon with us. And they need not now a Testimonial from us, of their Christian and Religious Conversation and Management while they dwelt here, though we have Reason always to Remember the same.</P>
<P>As I was very much knowing, in the time of it, to the things set forth in this Account of Mrs <HI>E∣lisabeth Mixer,</HI> and that either by being Present with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aring &amp; believing what others, who were Ear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itnesses did say concerning her: So I have been (as I was de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir'd) gathering together <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> now Related of her, from the several Pa∣pers written by diverse Hands that contained them,
<PB REF="040101_0003_10162BB4A6162AF8"/>that so they might be the better read &amp; perused than they could be when lying so scattered as they were before in sundry Papers. And if they should be∣come (by my pains in the matter) more communi∣cated to the Knowlege of others than they have ever as yet been. I hope the knowlege of such things will be of great Use and Service to Excite and stir up People to seek the LORD and the Manifestations of His special Love and Favour, to make sure of a Saving Interest in CHRIST, to prepare for Death and Judgment and Eternity, to Escape the Miseries the Wicked shall for ever Ensure in Hell, and to Obtain the Everlasting Blessedness and Joys of the Triumphant Saints in Heaven: To make sure of Saving Grace here, and so of Glory hereafter▪ And to a care to live above the World, avoiding the Pride and Sinful Vanities so much practised and followed in the World▪ And particularly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> than their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Lusts and Vanities.</P>
<P>To be sure it is of great Advantage to see in lively Instance thereof, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of our Holy Christian Religion and of the Grace of GOD, such as the Instance here set forth is. It proves Religion to be truly what the Pious Discourses and the Sermons of Faithful Ministers of the Gospel do Assert it to be, and not a meer Notion.</P>
<P>It is well to be Remark'd that the holy and pious Conversation of the Person here spoken of, as Ex∣periencing her self and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, has been answerable to their thing and so long maintained, and that she has Engage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so much the Comforts and Peace of GOD's chosen People since those her Remarkable Experiences.</P>
<P><PB REF="040101_0004_10162B9038872548"/>I desire the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> of this Collection of Things, would overlook the <HI>Imperfections</HI> thereof, and observe the good <HI>Harmony</HI> there is between what was Noted and taken down by several Hands, concerning the Spiritual Experiences and Rapturous and Pious Expressions of this <HI>Young Woman,</HI> and here Collected together, and the Relation she de∣livered to me to be Read, in order for her Ad∣mission into full Communion in the Church of CHRIST here in <HI>Ashford.</HI></P>
<P>And now, as it may be of some particular Service to give a more full and clear Account about her Re∣lation, aforesaid; I would mention, That accord∣ing to the Church Record I have, she was Received into full Communion <HI>November</HI> the 6<HI>th,</HI> 1720, And it seems then it was Publickly Read, accord∣ing to our Custom, <HI>viz.</HI> her Relation of her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. Moreover, I may mention, that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> before <HI>June</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> strongly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, that she hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Sound in the Air.</P>
<P>But to come to a Conclusion of this <HI>Prefatory Epistle,</HI> I pray the LORD, That the Person so distinguished from most, by the Manifestation of the Favour of GOD to her in such a wonderful manner, may Live Answerable to such Discoveries of the Love of GOD, always while she Lives in this World, and that she may in due Time arrive to the Possession of that Blessedness which she has had such Foretasts of: And that we who know con∣cerning such Grace of GOD towards her, may be careful so to Live here, in our Probation Time, as that we may have now the Earnests of Future Glory▪ and at last the Full Possession of Heavenly Blessedness.</P>

<HEAD><HI>AN ACCOUNT</HI> OF SOME <HI>Spiritual Experiences</HI> OF Mrs. <HI>Elisabeth Mixer.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ON the 28<HI>th.</HI> of <HI>June</HI> 1720, the Re∣verend Mr. JAMES HA<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>E, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> for in the Morning very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, came &amp; Prayed three <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>es with <HI>Elisabeth Mixer,</HI> who was then in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> very weak &amp; low Condition, attended with strong Pains; and was under Darkness and the buffetings of Satan at the same time: Not long after the mentioned Prayers, GOD ap∣peared very graciously for her Help, and in a moment (as it were) turned her Mourning into joy, and caused the light of His Coun∣tenance to shine upon her and gave a more than ordinary sight of Heavenly Things: Which caused her to speak then, in the hear∣ing of sundry credible Ear-witnesses, after a Rapturous manner.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="040101_0006_10162B91D6A05FA8"/>She said then to this purpose, <HI>CHRIST Smileth! I behold Heavens Gate Open; the Angels with golden Caps in their Hands! I see sparkling Crowns and Diamonds, and the Angels and Saints singing Hallelujahs, Praising GOD. Oh! Death is sweet. Not one of you can tell the Glory which I behold. I can smile on Death. The Joy is unspeakable! I am afraid I shall be turned back to Live again in this World; and I am afraid if it should be so, I should forget. The Heavens shine like transparent Gold. The Angels are wait∣ing for to carry my Soul into that Glory. Now I can go! I long to go to Glory. O sweet Death! O Death, where is thy Sting? O Grave, where is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> If People did see the Loveliness of CHRIST, they would not Sin as they do.

Oh! That you were all a going with me. But I hope to meet you all there.</HI></P>
<P>She looking Earnestly upon her Fingers, said, <HI>My Nails begin to change. Death has be∣gun to seise upon me. It is a welcome Messenger of Peace to me. I long for Death. Just now I was afraid of Death, Now I long for it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="040101_0007_10162BBC99104668"/>And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> looking upon some that stood by her, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ <HI>If you did but know what a Loving GOD <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is, you would never Sin against Him any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> What Joy has He prepared for them that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve and Fear Him?

<P>She admired at the Free Grace of GOD to her, saying; <HI>O that CHRIST should Die for me! O that He should look upon such a miserable Sinner as I am!</HI></P>
<P>Said she, <HI>Oh! CHRIST shines, He is Beauti∣ful, He is Beautiful! O that you could behold him and see how Beautiful he is! Oh! The Amiable∣ness of the Lovely JESƲS.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="040101_0008_10162B9684E05E08"/>Oh! <HI>said she,</HI> How the Saints &amp; Angels Praise GOD. Oh! The Heavenly melody. Oh! How they sing Hallelujahs to GOD and the LAMB! O that you could hear them! O, I long to be with them, to help Praise GOD! I can't Praise Him here enough. Oh! the infinite Love of CHRIST, in his coming into the World to die for poor Sin∣ners! He wore a Crown of Thorn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that we might wear Crowns of Glory. Jesus Christ has Purcha∣sed white Raiment for all Souls that will come <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Him. Although the Soul be stain'd with Sin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there is Merit enough in the sweet Blood of Jes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Christ to wash out the stains of Sin, and make them clean in the si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of God. Oh! 'Tis Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> that adorns the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd makes it Beautiful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Grace is far more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and it is Grace <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Soul shine. Oh! The Spirit of Christ is a Dove-like Spirit: It is not a Spirit of Envy and Malice, but a Loving and Forgiving Spirit.</P>
<P>How will the Saints Triumph at the Judg∣ment-Day and Praise God for his finding out such a way for their Redemption?</P>
<P>But what an Amazing Day will it be to the Wicked, when they shall Crawl out of their Graves like Toads? (as I read in a Book) and will then call to the Saints and say, Take us along with you! But the Devils will catch them away to Hell and
<PB N="5" REF="040101_0009_10162BBE24A0CCF0"/>there they must be Barred in Hell amongst De∣vils and Damned Souls.</P>
<P>At another time, as declaring her own Spiritual discerning, so giving good Counsel to People, which she was Enabled wonderfully to do. Especially to give good Counsel to Young People.</P>
<P><HI>She said to this purpose,</HI> I see that Eternity is Boundless and Endless, so as I never did see it before. Were it not for Eternity, the Saints in Heaven could not be happy.</P>
<P>And speaking with respect to the never∣Ending Joys the Saints have in Heaven, she also said, <HI>Oh! That I were with them Praising of GOD. When millions of millions of Years are at an End, their Joys are as fresh as at their first Entring.</HI></P>
<P>And speaking to them that were round about her, she said, <HI>Look into Eternity; his E∣ternity that makes Hell miserable. How dread∣ful is it for any Soul to go to Hell, to Perish for Ever?</HI></P>
<P><HI>And she said to them that were Present with her, to this purpose;</HI> If you did but see what Amiableness there is in Jesus Christ! Sweet Jesus Christ! He is altogether Lovely. His Grace is much better than Gold. Gold is not to be mentioned with it. It is Christ that Beautifies and Adorns the Soul by His Grace and makes it
<PB N="6" REF="040101_0010_10162B9921240DF8"/>to shine. If you did but see how Heaven shines, the Angels shining, and the Saints with their white Robes and white Garments! Oh! That persons would mind their precious Souls. Oh! what a precious thing is the Soul? Oh! The never Ending Eternity. Oh! That God would help me this once more to Praise Him, that I might warn Per∣sons of their danger of Perishing. O that any Soul should Perish! That any of the <HI>Indians</HI> Souls should go to Hell! That there ever should be a sin∣ful Thought, or a wicked Word spoken! Al∣though there is none Perfect, that can live without Sin. Sin dwells in persons and will be always warring and fighting: but by the strength of Christ persons can overcome. Persons mind the World; but Heaven should be in their thoughts and mind, and in their speech and discourse. They should talk of nothing of the World but what is necessary. They should keep Christ nearest their hearts, the World under their feet, and Eternity in their eye.</P>
<P>The sin of Pride is an heinous Sin in the sight of God, and reigns among People. Young People take care to prink and fine up their Bodies, but they have more need to take care of their Souls, to get Christ to stand their Friend. O that any should put a dust of Powder upon their Hair, or a Ribbon on their Caps, that have more need to put on Sack∣cloth. God abhors the Proud, but it is an humble contrite Spirit that God accepts.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="040101_0011_10162BBFD5E7A2B0"/>There is filthy Communication, foolish Jesting. O that God would give me strength, once more to Warn persons of their Souls and Eternity.</P>
<P>She said to them that were present with her, <HI>O Friends, I intreat you not to forget ETER∣NITY.</HI></P>
<P>And she desired that their Souls might have on them the white Robes of Christ's Righ∣teousness, and that every Soul of them present with her, might be washed clean in the Blood of Christ.</P>
<P>She spake to them that were present, con∣cerning the Judgment to come, and how that they must appear before the Judgment Seat of Christ to give an account of every Thing; and how Joyful it would be and Blessed for the Righteous then, that their Sins should be blotted out. But she spake as to the Wicked, that their Sins should Condemn them, and that the Devils would drag them into Hell∣fire, where he would tare and torture them; and that they should shriek throughout the never-ending Ages of Eternity.</P>
<P>She called to the <HI>Young People</HI> that were present, Warning them not to go to Frolicks, nor to spend their Time Idly nor Vainly, but to mind their precious Souls She told them that they should improve heir precious Time and Opportunities, Sermons and Sabbaths.
<PB N="8" REF="040101_0012_10162B9AB9C72728"/>She spake unto all in general, that were then present with her, Telling them that they could not Love God Enough, that they could not Serve Christ Enough. That if they could see the Infinite Love of God in Christ's Dying to save Sinners, in His shedding His Precious Blood ... And she spake to them, mentioning that Christ spilt his Precious Blood on the Cross, to Redeem Souls from Sin. And saying, <HI>GOD is Spotless and Holy and cannot look upon Sin with any Allowance. O Sin, Sin! That ever any should sin and grieve so good a GOD! The Holiness, Holiness there is in Heaven! No man without Holiness shall see God.</HI></P>
<P>Further, At another time (it being Lord's-day-Evening, <HI>July</HI> 3<HI>d,</HI> 1720,) she spake to this purpose; <HI>Oh! The Loveliness of Jesus Christ: Christ has Merit Enough to Save every Body. Oh! that ever any Soul should be Lost. Oh! Let all Young People Seek God.</HI></P>
<P>And speaking to the Young People then present in particular, she said to such a pur∣pose as followeth; <HI>That You may have on the white Robe of Christ's Righteousness. Oh! That you may have Christ to Smile upon you when you come to lie on your Death-beds. Against whom∣soever the Gate of Heaven is shut, it will be opened to Young Persons. ☜ Oh! Whensoever you get together, don't spend your Time in Evil Communi∣cations; but let your Time be spent about Heaven
<PB N="9" REF="040101_0013_10162BC2E6FA4198"/>and the things of another World. One sight of Christ would wean your Hearts from the Vanities of this world. Christ has died to Save such poor Sinners as You be. God takes notice how you rise in the Morning, and how you lie down at Night. Christ's Arms are open to Receive you, if you will but come to Him. Oh! the Preciousness of Time. The Grave is waiting for you, and Eternity is hast∣ning. Oh! Let every Body Improve their Season of Grace. You cannot Love and Serve Christ Enou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪</HI></P>
<P><HI>As it is said in Prov.</HI> 8.17. I Love them that Love Me, and those that Seek me Early shall find me.</P>
<P><HI>And as it is said in Eccl.</HI> 12.1. Remem∣ber thy Creator in the days of thy Youth, while the Evil Days come not, nor the Years draw nigh, when thou shalt say I have no pleasure in them.</P>
<P><HI>And Chap.</HI> 11.<HI>v.</HI>9. Rejoice O Young man in thy Youth, and let thy heart chear thee in the days of thy Youth, and walk in the ways of thy Heart and in the sight of thine Eyes; But know thou, that for all these things, God will bring thee into Judgment.</P>
<P>No worldly Joys can afford you any Comfort upon your Death-beds: Only your Friend CHRIST can Comfort you. I intreat you would not forget the Warnings I have given you. I pray God to
<PB N="10" REF="040101_0014_10162B9E482799C8"/>Bless it to every Soul that stands round about to be∣hold me▪ You must give a strict Account for this Sabbath-Day, and for the Sermons you have heard, and for every Sabbath &amp; Sermon you have heard. Whatsoever you do, do all to the glory of GOD.</P>
<P>And as Expressing how Extensive her Coun∣sels were, and how sensible she was of things in a spiritual and thankful manner, it may be convenient to give an Account, how, that at some of the Times already mentioned, (or near them) she manifested concerning her self and spake concerning things, as followeth.</P>
<P>She admired God's wonderful <HI>Goodness</HI> to her; for she could now say, as in Psal. 40.2, 3 <HI>He brought me up also out of an horrible Pot, out of the miry Clay, and set my feet upon a Rock — And he hath put a new Song in my mouth, even Praise unto our God. Many shall see it and fear and shall trust in the Lord.</HI> And as in Ps. 116.7 <HI>The Lord hath dealt bountifully with me.</HI> Ver. 12 <HI>What shall I render unto the Lord for all his bene∣fits towards me?</HI></P>
<P>She desired to be Thankful to the Rev'd Mr. <HI>Eleazer Williams</HI> of <HI>Mansfield,</HI> who came to see her and Prayed with her, and he told her of that Scripture, Job 42.5, 6. <HI>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the Ear, but now mine Eye seeth thee. Wherefore I abhor my self, and

<P>She desired to be Thankful to the Reverend Mr. <HI>Hale,</HI> for his former Instructions, and Catechising of her; and of his often Visiting of her and Praying with her in the time of her Sickness.</P>
<P>She spake, saying, <HI>How good it was for Mi∣nisters to be Faithful; and what a Crown of Joy and Rejoicing shall be given to all the Faithful Mi∣nisters of Jesus Christ at the Day of His Appear∣ing.</HI></P>
<P>She spake also concerning <HI>Parents</HI> bringing up their <HI>Children,</HI> how they ought to Teach and Instruct them, and bring them up in the Fear and Admonition of the Lord.</P>
<P>And she desired to be Thankful for her own Early Education by her Parents.</P>
<P>She mentioned her being Awakened when she was about <HI>Six or Seven Years Old,</HI> by the thoughts of Death and another World; and how when she was about <HI>Thirteen Years Old,</HI> she had great Desires to the Holy Ordinance of the <HI>Lord's Supper</HI>: But fears of her own Un∣worthiness,
<PB N="12" REF="040101_0016_10162BA080F0EFB0"/>caused her still to Neglect. She mentioned Scriptures that were Comfortable or Affecting to her; And thus that Scrip∣ture,</P>
<P>Joh 14 1, 2, 3. <HI>Let not your heart be trou∣bled, Ye believe in God believe also in me. In my Fathers house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you, I go to prepare a place for you. I will come again and receive you unto my self, that where I am there ye may be also.</HI></P>
<P>And so, Heb. 12.22, 23, 24. <HI>But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the City of the Living God, the Heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innume∣rable company of Angels▪ to the general Assembly and Church of the First-born, which are written in Heaven, and to GOD the Judge of all, and to the Spirits of just man made Perfect, and to JESUS the Mediator of the New Covenant, and to the Blood of Sprinkling that speaketh better things than the blood of Abel.</HI></P>
<P>And Rev. 7.14, 15, 16. <HI>These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their Robes and made them white in the Blood of the Lamb. Therefore are they before the Throne and serve him day and night in his temple: And he that dwelleth on the Throne shall dwell among them. They shall hunger no more, neither shall they thirst any more, neither shall the Sun light on them, nor any heat.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="040101_0017_10162BC9236975D0"/>And Rev. 21 4. <HI>And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain; for the former things are passed away.</HI></P>
<P>And 1 Joh. 1.7. <HI>The Blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth us from all Sin.</HI></P>
<P>And Rom. 16.20. <HI>And the God of Peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly.</HI></P>
<P>And Rom. 8 15. <HI>For ye have not received the spirit of Bondage again to fear: but ye have re∣ceived the spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. The Spirit it self beareth witness with our spirits, that we are the children of God; and if children, then heirs, heirs of God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> joint-heirs with Christ.</HI></P>
<P>And Heb. 11.1. <HI>Faith is the substance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not seen.</HI></P>
<P>And Psal. 77.3. <HI>I remembred God and was troubled, I complained and my spirit was over∣whelmed.</HI></P>
<P>And Psal 22.1. <HI>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</HI></P>
<P>And Psal. 30.7. <HI>Thou didst hide thy face and I was troubled.</HI></P>
<P>And Psal. 63.1, 3 6, 7. <HI>O God, thou art my God, Early will I seek thee; my soul thirsteth for thee — Because thy loving kindness is better than
<PB N="14" REF="040101_0018_10162BA4249C3528"/>life: my lips shall praise thee. When I remember thee upon my bed, &amp; meditate on thee in the right-watches. Because thou hast been my help; there∣fore in the shadow of thy wings I will rejoice.</HI></P>
<P>And Job 21 32, 33. <HI>Yet shall he be brought to the grave and remain in the tomb. The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as there are innumera∣ble before him.</HI></P>
<P>And Chap. 19 25, 26, 27 <HI>For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth. And though after my skin, worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God: Whom I shall see for my self, and mine ey<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> shall behold, and not another: —</HI></P>
<P>And Chap 14.1, 2 12, 13, 14 <HI>Man that is born of a woman, is of few days, and full of trouble. He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not. So man lieth down, and riseth not, till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep. O that thou wouldst hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldst appoint me a set time, and remember me! If a man die, shall he live again? All the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my Change come.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE RELATION OF <HI>Mrs.</HI> Elisabeth Mixer, As desiring to Join to the Church in full Communion, to this purpose relating.</HEAD>
<P>I Have cause to bless GOD, that I was Born and brought up in a Land of Light, under the joyful Sound of the Gospel; That I was Baptized in my Infancy, being a Child of the Covenant. I have cause to bless God for my Education by my Father and Mother, who often Instructed me to fear God and keep his Commandments.</P>
<P>Betwixt Seven &amp; Eight Years I was awake∣ned &amp; stirred up to the duty of Secret Prayer, from the thoughts of another World.</P>
<P>When I was about Thirteen Years of Age, God wrought in me, by His Holy Spirit, longing Desires to come to the Holy Ordi∣nance of the Lord's Supper. Hearing the Reverend Mr. <HI>Hale</HI> Preach from, Isa. 1 18. <HI>Come now, let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool</HI> I was thereby Encouraged to come to God.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="040101_0020_10162BA7D7D5F590"/>I have been Encouraged, by Joh. 7.27. <HI>In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst let him come unto me and drink.</HI> And by that, Mat. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 28 <HI>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</HI> By these I was Encouraged to come to Christ.</P>
<P>Luk. 14 23. <HI>And the Lord said unto the ser∣vant, Go out into the high-ways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled,</HI> Was an Encouragement to me to come to the Ordinance of the LORD's SUPPER.</P>
<P>But it being such an high and holy Ordi∣nance; and I having a sense of my own Unworthiness, it made me to delay coming, lest <HI>coming Unworthily, I should eat and drink Judgment to my self.</HI> I was then desiring Grace of God, that I might be fitted for it: The Preparations of the heart in man <HI>being from the LORD.</HI></P>
<P>When my Sister <HI>Rebecca</HI> lay upon her Death-bed, she told me that I should not put off Repentance till I came to a Sick-bed. She said it was no time then to prepare in for Eternity. She put me in mind of my Duty &amp; of my own Mortality.</P>
<P>And after a while God was pleased to visit me with Sickness, which seem'd to threaten my dissolution &amp; departure out of this world, by reason of strong Pain. I was in great
<PB N="17" REF="040101_0021_10162BCF84BE66B8"/>Darkness, and may say as the Psalmist, Psal. 30 7 <HI>Thou didst hide thy face and I was troubled.</HI> And Psal. 11 6.3. <HI>The sorrows of death compassed me. I found trouble and sorrow.</HI> And when I thought upon my former Experiences of Christ's love to me, it seem'd to be gone from me. That place (<HI>Luk.</HI> 13.24.) came into my mind; where we read, <HI>Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</HI> Which put me into fears lest I should not be able to enter in. But that place come into my mind, Heb. 2 18. <HI>For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.</HI> And it seem'd to afford me some Encouragement.</P>
<P>But I yet remain'd in Darkness; and here were many Prayers put up for me, by the Re∣verend Mr <HI>Hale,</HI> and by my Christian Friends and Neighbours And in answer to their Prayers, God appeared very wonderfully for me. God returning to me I immediately saw Heavens gate opened, Christ smiling upon me seem'd to welcome me to his Kingdom. I beheld Jesus Christ altogether Lovely, the chiefest of Ten Thousands; surrounded with glorious Angels And the Heavenly City the <HI>New Jerusalem,</HI> was brought into my view; it lay four Square, and the City was of pure transparent Gold: It had no need of the Sun
<PB N="18" REF="040101_0022_10162BA98AD56C18"/>or the Moon to shine in it for the LAMB was the Light thereof. Jesus Christ was Cloathed with Glory and Majesty▪ The Angels shined with a glorious shining▪ No Tongue can Express the Glory I then behold. Oh! how I long'd to come to Heavens gate. Then I thought I could Die: That Death would be welcome and sweet unto me. I thought I could lie in the Grave as in the sweet Bed of Christ. I thought if People knew how good GOD is, they would be careful to Serve Him and would fear to Sin against Him</P>
<P>Such things as I then saw, I Expressed in the time of it, as I had strength; having such a real sight of things, that I even wondred that Others saw not with me.</P>
<P>This was on the Tuesday, <HI>June</HI> the 18<HI>th.</HI></P>
<P>On a certain Night some time after that, I had a deep sense and fore sight of the Praising of God. Jesus Christ was pleased to Visit my Soul with his Light and Love I saw Light round about me. The Room seem'd to be full of the Presence of Christ: and the holy Angels seem'd to be about the Bed and in the midst of the Room.</P>
<P>I was so full of the joys of Heaven, I had cause to bless God that I was Born, that ever I had a Being▪ I wish'd that every Room in the House had been full of People, to help me to Praise God.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="040101_0023_10162BD261C93B20"/>I thought the Stones of the Street, if they had sense, would have shouted for Joy.</P>
<P>I admired the Free grace of God in Christ's Undertaking for such a poor wretched Sin∣ner as I was.</P>
<P>Jesus Christ gave me assurance that He would stand by me and be with me, when I passed thro' the valley of <HI>the shadow of Death.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Friday night</HI> following, God gave a wonderful sight of Eternity, as I never saw Eternity look so before. And I saw it as Endless and Boundless. I saw all the World was hastning apa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e into the endless Ocean of Eternity. I did see then that it was E∣ternity that made Heaven and the Saints Happy. Oh! the endless Joys of the Saints. I saw how they were there Praising God, and Praising God for ever; which made me long to be where I might Praise Him for ever: That I might be in his full Pre∣sence, where I might behold my dear Re∣deemer face to face, and see Him as He is Lovely, Glorious and Shining. I thought that I could readily leave Father &amp; Mother, Brethren and Sisters, to go to Christ</P>
<P>I saw that it was Eternity that made Hell and the Damned Miserable.</P>
<P>Jesus Christ was pleased to give me a fore∣sight of His Coming to Judge the World. I saw how that the Saints would shine and
<PB N="20" REF="040101_0024_10162BADAA938558"/>glisten at Christ's right Hand, made like unto his glorious Body. I saw how they would triumph &amp; sing Hallelujahs unto God and to the Lamb, for finding out such a way for their Salvation; which made me rejoice to think there was such a glorious Day a coming, 1 Thes 4.15 <HI>Them that sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.</HI> Ver. 16. <HI>And the Lord him∣self shall descend from heaven with a shout, and with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first.</HI></P>
<P>I thought I should rejoice to hear the sound of the last Trumpet, and to see Christ coming in the Clouds with Ten Thousands of his Saints and Angels, with Power &amp; great Glory, to Judge the World.</P>
<P>I saw what an amazing day that Day will be to the Wicked, when they shall see such Lightnings, &amp; hear such Thundrings, as will pierce into the very bowels of the Earth.</P>
<P>I saw how the now careless World would stand trembling before their offended Judge. I saw how terrible the Wrath of such a glo∣rious Judge would at that Day be, against great Sinners, especially gospel Sinners, who Perish from under the Light of the Gospel.</P>
<P>I saw how the Wicked would be banished from Christ's Presence, and from the glory of his Power; and should be shut down in utter Darkness, to be there for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="040101_0025_10162BD3FA46C708"/>I saw how careful Persons ought to be, to improve their precious Time and Day of Grace, especially Sabbath Opportunities &amp; Sermons; in Crying to God for Grace and Mercy now, while it is called to day, while the Lord is waiting to be gracious. For the Son of Man will come in a day and an hour when Sinners look not for him.</P>
<P>I saw how Christ suffered and shed His Precious Blood on the Cross, poured out his Soul even unto Death, to purchase Life E∣ternal for us.</P>
<P>I saw that Christ was able and willing to Save unto the uttermost, all that come unto Him, even the chiefest of Sinners. Although their Souls were stained with Sin, yet that there was Virtue enough in the sweet Blood of Christ, to wash out the stains of Sin, and make them clean in the sight of God. That God delighted not in the death of a Sinner, was not willing that any should Perish, but that all should be Sav'd &amp; come to the know∣ledge of the Truth. And how that, as in Joh. 3.16. (For) <HI>God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</HI></P>
<P>And I was made to see that it was Grace that adorned the Soul and made it lovely in the sight of God. And I did see how Grace shined, that it out-shined the Sun in bright∣ness.
<PB N="22" REF="040101_0026_10162BB0570FA408"/>And I saw that none but they that have Grace and Holiness, should enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</P>
<P>And I saw that I must first shine in Grace, before I could shine in Glory. The Beauty and Amiableness that I did see in the Lovely Jesus! I thought if <HI>Young People</HI> did but see the Loveliness that there is in Christ Jesus, it would soon wean their hearts from the Pride and Vanity of this world.</P>
<P>I did see how that Jesus Christ stood with his Arms open ready to receive any that wou'd come to Him: As in Prov. 8 17. <HI>I love them that love me and those that seek me early shall find me.</HI> And Ver. 11. of the same Chap. it is said, <HI>For wisdom is better than rubies and all the things that may be desired, are not to be compared to it.</HI> Eccl 11.9. <HI>Rejoice, O Young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: But know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into Judgment.</HI></P>
<P>And he gave me new Assurance, that I was in his Favour then. I thought if all the world was against me, I should value it as nothing.</P>
<P>I was enabled to see that it was an Honour to suffer for Christ; for them that were his Disciples to suffer reproach for His sake, and to lay down their lives, if called to it, for
<PB N="23" REF="040101_0027_10162BD6838BE1F8"/>Christ's sake 1 Pet. 4.14 <HI>If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you.</HI> Rev. 7 14. <HI>These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</HI> And as in ver. 15. <HI>Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night.</HI></P>
<P>After this I had conflicts with Satan, but that in, Rev. 2.10. <HI>Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</HI> And in, Phil. 1.6. — <HI>He which hath begun a good work in you, will perform it to the day of Christ▪</HI> These Scriptures were strengthning to me.</P>
<P>God gave me to see by an eye of Faith, that Jesus Christ was to me Justification, A∣doption and Sanctification, to Justify me be∣fore God.</P>
<P>By this God Enabled me to overcome Sa∣tans temptations, Jam. 5 11. <HI>Behold, we count them happy which endure. You have heard of the patience of</HI> Job, <HI>and have seen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy.</HI> Rom. 5.3, 4 <HI>But we glory in tribulation also, knowing that tribulation worketh patience; and patience, experience; and experience hope.</HI></P>
<P>These Scriptures strengthned me to be Patient under my bodily Weakness. And now I can say, as in Psal. 119.71. <HI>It is good for me that I have been afflicted: that I might
<PB N="24" REF="040101_0028_10162BB1E7AB5988"/>learn thy statutes.</HI> Job 14.1, 2 <HI>Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trou∣ble. He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.</HI> Ver 5. <HI>Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou hast ap∣pointed his bounds that he cannot pass.</HI> Lam 3 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>6. <HI>It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord.</HI> Which Scrip∣ture Encouraged me to trust in the Lord in my affliction that I was in by reason of bodily weakness Rev. 3.20. <HI>Behold, I stand at the door &amp; knock; if any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in unto him, and will sup with him, &amp; be with me.</HI> And in Ver. 8 of the same Chap. <HI>I counsel thee to buy of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in the fire, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> be cloa∣thed.</HI> Which further encouraged me to come to the holy Ordinance of the <HI>Lord's Supper.</HI></P>
<P>I desire to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Jesus Christ in all His O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, as my <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> King.</HI> As my Prophet to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> me; and as my Priest to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>; and as my King to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> over me <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Reign</HI> in me.
