<HEAD>TRUE STORY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>A Lieutenant of a regiment in gar∣rison at St. Christopher's died, and left his son an orphan. A particu∣lar family had promised him on his death∣bed to take care of his boy, but he was wholly abandoned, and forced to keep among the negro children, and live on such scraps as he could find.</P>
<P>In this state, he caught that loathsome disease called the Yaws, which became a new reason for giving him up to his fate.</P>
<P>In this condition BABAY, a poor ne∣gro woman, found him, took him to her hut, got him cured, and divided what food she had with him, till he was able to work for himself. The first mo∣ney that he earned, went to purchase her freedom.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="037158_0003_100CD5DEE9230D38"/>
He was prosperous in the world, and took her home to his house and as long as she lived afterwards, which might be upwards of forty years, treated her with the most respectful kindness. He gave her a very expensive burial, and had a funeral sermon preached over her. As this sermon was delivered before people acquainted with her character, and men∣tioned such circumstances as I wish here to remark, I shall give an extract of what was addressed to the slaves that attended her.</P>
<P>"This good woman was like many of you a slave, and as such laboured under every disadvantage, which you can plead, for not doing her duty; yet, in this situation, she shewed in her conduct the noblest fruits of religion and charity; a helpless child, left an orphan in a strange country, far from relations, or even acquaintance to his family, aban∣doned by those who undertook to raise him, from her alone could raise pity, or engage attention, when left by all of his own rank and colour, to perish in a loathsome disease, though son to a ser∣vant

of the Public, with whom every true lover of his Country should have sympathized. She alone lodged him, nursed him carefully, got him cured, and put him into a way to provide for himself.</P>
<P>Take notice this woman was a chris∣tian, and you will cease to wonder. This instance of generosity found in one of her condition, is a proof that noble and great actions are not, as many think, con∣fined to advantages of birth and educa∣tion, for she had nothing to direct her but GOD'S grace working on a tracta∣ble heart, and this benevolent temper, shewed itself in every part of her beha∣viour through life, and was accompani∣ed in her, with a true sense of religion; or to speak more truly, she was charita∣ble because she was religious.</P>
<P>She was well instructed in what she ought to know, and believe, and always acted upon those christian principles she professed to believe. She always spoke on religious subjects, with an
<PB N="6" REF="037158_0005_100CD5E4CD0A5930"/>
earnestness, seriousness, and knowledge, which I wish were more general than I have found them among her betters; here then is a shining example of good∣ness, on your own level for your imita∣tion. "If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them."</P>

<LG>
<L>A TALE I tell whose first beginning</L>
<L>May set some giddy folks a grinning;</L>
<L>But only let it all unfold,</L>
<L>A sadder tale was never told</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some people, who for years before,</L>
<L>Had seldom pass'd their outer door,</L>
<L>For once determin'd to be gay,</L>
<L>And have one merry-making day.</L>
<L>Agreed, "a sailing we will go:"</L>
<L>Thus all was settled at a blow.</L>
<L>With hats and bonnets duly ty'd,</L>
<L>They bustle to the water side;</L>
<L>And as the women stem the gale,</L>
<L>They seem already under sail:</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="037158_0007_100CD970598D3E98"/>
Here, while we find them safe and sound,</L>
<L>A sailing only on dry ground,</L>
<L>We'll take occasion to declare</L>
<L>Who all these merry people were.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>First, there was John; a Trader he</L>
<L>Clever and smart as you shall see;</L>
<L>High on the shelf, in nice array,</L>
<L>His various wares and Patterns lay;</L>
<L>Call when you will the thing's at hand,</L>
<L>And John is ever at his stand.</L>
<L>I grant, indeed, his price was high,</L>
<L>But then his shew-glass caught the eye;</L>
<L>Besides, 'twas known and understood,</L>
<L>His things were all extremely good.</L>
<L>Walk in, and if you talk with John,</L>
<L>I warrant he will draw you on:</L>
<L>Not that he ventur'd on the sin,</L>
<L>Of taking any strangers in;</L>
<L>For John, dispute it he who can,</L>
<L>Was a plain, open, honest man;</L>
<L>You saw it written in his face;</L>
<L>And then he serv'd you with a grace;</L>
<L>With gentle air, and accent sweet,</L>
<L>Powder'd and dress'd so spruce and neat▪</L>
<L>And most obliging in his speeches,</L>
<L>Unnumber'd ribbons down he reaches;</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="037158_0008_100CD973CE266408"/>
Presents before the Lady's view,</L>
<L>Each flow'ry edge, each beauteous hue,</L>
<L>Rolls and unrolls the slippery things,</L>
<L>And every finger has it wings;</L>
<L>Then waits, with rare command of face,</L>
<L>While Miss, in sad distressful case,</L>
<L>Puzzles, and frets, and doubts, between</L>
<L>A greenish blue, and blueish green.</L>
<L>At length each anxious mind is eas'd,</L>
<L>The bargain's struck, the Lady's pleas'd;</L>
<L>John humbly bows, then takes his flight</L>
<L>To write his bill as swift as light;</L>
<L>And ere the stranger's march'd away,</L>
<L>He next as sweetly asks for pay.</L>
<L>Yet if there enter'd one he knew,</L>
<L>John always gave the credit due;</L>
<L>Welcom'd the friend with joyful looks,</L>
<L>Yet clapp'd the debt into his books:</L>
<L>And tho' he begg'd the bill might wait,</L>
<L>'Twas sent at Christmas sure as fate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At Christmas too (I tell his fame,</L>
<L>That traders all may do the same)</L>
<L>John calmly takes his books up stairs,</L>
<L>And balances his whole affairs;</L>
<L>Sees how his total credits stand,</L>
<L>And values all his stock in hand;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="037158_0009_100CD975555BA6C0"/>
Then fairly puts on t'other side,</L>
<L>The debts he owes both far and wide;</L>
<L>The diff'rence is the sum he's worth,</L>
<L>'Tis all he has this year on earth:</L>
<L>Compares it with the year before,</L>
<L>"'Tis less than then"—"O, no; 'tis more—"</L>
<L>"'Tis vastly more," he says with glee,</L>
<L>"'Tis right, 'Tis right, my books agree!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But who, except a trader's self,</L>
<L>Can paint these joys of growing pelf!</L>
<L>Or rather, to correct my song,</L>
<L>Who paint the pleasures that belong</L>
<L>To honest industry and thrift,</L>
<L>While God is thank'd for every gift!</L>
<L>Ah! foolish John, so blest at home,</L>
<L>What need hadst thou so far to roam?</L>
<L>Could thy new-fangled joys out-top</L>
<L>The hourly pleasures of thy shop:</L>
<L>Or if thy health an airing need,</L>
<L>And one grand holiday's decreed,</L>
<L>Couldst thou not go, to change the scene,</L>
<L>And take a turn upon the green?</L>
<L>Ah! foolish John, from what strange quarter</L>
<L>Could come this fancy for the water!</L>

Well hast thou prosper'd while on shore,</L>
<L>There lab'ring nobly at the oar;</L>
<L>But if the wat'ry flood should ride thee,</L>
<L>Methinks some evil will betide thee:</L>
<L>And shouldst thou dare, when once afloat,</L>
<L>Thyself to <HI>steer,</HI> or row the boat,</L>
<L>The hour shall come—I see it nigh,</L>
<L>With my prophetic poet's eye,</L>
<L>When know, vain man, that thou shalt smart,</L>
<L>And all thy glory shall depart.</L>
<L>Then hear, ye Britons, while I preach,</L>
<L>This is the truth I mean to teach—</L>
<L>That he who in his shop is bright,</L>
<L>And skill'd to keep his reck'ning right,</L>
<L>Who steers in the good middle way,</L>
<L>And gets some custom, and some pay,</L>
<L>Marks when sad Bankrupt times prevail,</L>
<L>And carefully draws in his sail,</L>
<L>Keeps watch, has all his lanterns out,</L>
<L>And sees the dangers round about;</L>
<L>Pushes his trade with wind and oar,</L>
<L>And still gets forward more and more.</L>
<L>This trader, skill'd as he may be,</L>
<L>On shore a man of high degree,</L>
<L>May prove a very dunce at sea.</L>
<L><PB N="12" REF="037158_0011_100CDD8B044FF930"/>
Ah! foolish John, no thoughts like these</L>
<L>Once enter'd to disturb his ease;</L>
<L>Onward he goes, and thinks it grand,</L>
<L>To quit the plain and simple land;</L>
<L>Leaves a good house of brick and mortar,</L>
<L>To try mere wood upon the water.</L>

<L>'TWAS told you in a former lay,</L>
<L>How on a luckless evil day,</L>
<L>The trader John, a landsman brave,</L>
<L>Lest the dry ground to try the wave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But here the Poet must rehearse,</L>
<L>In soft, and sweet, and tender verse,</L>
<L>How gentle Johnny had a wife,</L>
<L>The joy and solace of his life,</L>
<L><PB N="13" REF="037158_0012_100CDD8DADC2A538"/>
The sharer of his griefs and cares,</L>
<L>Privy to all his great affairs;</L>
<L>One who when ty'd in wedlock's noose</L>
<L>Had prov'd a helpmate fit for use;</L>
<L>One whom he married—not for whim—</L>
<L>But who could keep his house in trim;</L>
<L>No high-flown Miss, or belle, or beauty,</L>
<L>A simple girl that knew her duty;</L>
<L>Had well obey'd her father, mother,</L>
<L>And counsell'd well her younger brother;</L>
<L>Healthy when young, and rather stout;</L>
<L>Moral?—nay, more, she was devout;</L>
<L>And now a Christian quite at heart,</L>
<L>She carefully fulfills her part,</L>
<L>Well skill'd alike her house to guide,</L>
<L>And serve the shop at Johnny's side.</L>
<L>See now she works to help the trade,</L>
<L>And now instructs her under maid.</L>
<L>But 'tis her chief and special care,</L>
<L>Her husband's daily toil to spare,</L>
<L>When sick, or weary and opprest,</L>
<L>To ease the troubles of his breast,</L>
<L>To sooth his sorrows, calm his fears,</L>
<L>And help him thro' this vale of tears;</L>
<L>Remind him where his treasure lies,</L>
<L>And point to realms above the skies.</L>
<L><PB N="14" REF="037158_0013_100CDD8FDEC6F7A0"/>
Where, when this shifting scene is o'er;</L>
<L>The faithful meet to part no more.</L>
<L>Now twenty summers, or above,</L>
<L>Have glided by and prov'd her love;</L>
<L>And tho' they may have marr'd her face,</L>
<L>Have ripen'd many a Christian grace:</L>
<L>Hence it may now be fairly guess'd,</L>
<L>Her latest days shall be her best.</L>
<L>John knows her worth, and now-a-days,</L>
<L>He grows quite eager in her praise;</L>
<L>For ev'ry calling friend is told,</L>
<L>"My wife is worth her weight in gold."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To this blest couple there was born,</L>
<L>One daughter cheerful as the morn;</L>
<L>A maiden she of spotless same,</L>
<L>E'en in her mirth quite clear from blame.</L>
<L>Train'd in Religion's "narrow way,"</L>
<L>Her mind untainted by a play,</L>
<L>She hates your giddy glitt'ring scenes,</L>
<L>Tho' long since enter'd on her teens;</L>
<L>Sees all things in a proper light,</L>
<L>And vice quite puts her in a fright;</L>
<L>Prompt and obedient from a child,</L>
<L>Obliging, humble, meek, and mild;</L>
<L>Still, before strangers, as a mouse;</L>
<L>Yet vastly useful in the house:</L>
<L><PB N="15" REF="037158_0014_100CDD91EA1BA9C0"/>
Toils for the shop, tho' seldom seen;</L>
<L>—Ah!—there she sits behind the screen;</L>
<L>There, like some flower both sweet and gay,</L>
<L>She shuns as yet the blaze of day;</L>
<L>(Well does her praise adorn my tale)</L>
<L>A new-blown lily of the vale.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now should perchance some fool draw near,</L>
<L>And get to whisper in her ear,</L>
<L>Of plays, and balls, and fairs, and races,</L>
<L>Fine midnight routs, and public places,</L>
<L>And wonder how she can endure,</L>
<L>A life so useful, and so pure—</L>
<L>Extol her form, her piercing eyes,</L>
<L>And tell a hundred flatt'ring lies;</L>
<L>—While the sweet praise he thinks she sips,</L>
<L>The tortur'd maiden bites her lips;</L>
<L>Thinks his fine flatt'ry mere pretence,</L>
<L>And longs to tell him to talk sense;</L>
<L>Yet dreads to take the dunce in hand,</L>
<L>Lest he should still not understand.</L>
<L>But should he let his <HI>vice</HI> peep out,</L>
<L>The meek-ey'd girl can then turn stout;</L>
<L><PB N="16" REF="037158_0015_100CDD9380388C90"/>
For <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce ('tis said) in terms direct.</L>
<L>A spruce and saucy spark she check'd;</L>
<L>(She grew so solemn in her speeches,</L>
<L>The bucks gave out that "Nancy preach∣es")</L>
<L>And once put on the sweetest air,</L>
<L>And begg'd a carman not to swear.</L>
<L>Thus while she spends her peaceful days,</L>
<L>Her parent's care she well repays;</L>
<L>Honours her father, loves her mother,</L>
<L>She'll prove, methinks, just such another;</L>
<L>And tho' scarce seen, except at church,</L>
<L>The men won't leave her in the lurch;</L>
<L>Some honest Christian man she'll strike,</L>
<L>No buck or blood—for like loves like.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next in my song, of equal same,</L>
<L>Comes a good honest antient dame;</L>
<L>John's mother—with no fault but one—</L>
<L>I mean—she doated on her son;</L>
<L>For when her own dear spouse was gone,</L>
<L>Her whole affections fell to John;</L>
<L>'Twas then the widow's age so great,</L>
<L>Her prospects small, her income strait,</L>
<L>That Johnny weigh'd the matter well,</L>
<L>And took her to his home to dwell:</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="037158_0016_100CDD958D28B6A0"/>
No cost or trouble did he grudge,</L>
<L>For John had rightly learn'd to judge,</L>
<L>That people, once of little fame,</L>
<L>But now of high and mighty name,</L>
<L>Oft owe the glory of their station,</L>
<L>To the mere help of Education.</L>
<L>Quoth he—Were all men good and true,</L>
<L>Their wealth, methinks, might half be due,</L>
<L>To some good dame, who now is found,</L>
<L>Quite thrust upon the mere back ground:</L>
<L>Besides (he added, half in tears)</L>
<L>A child is always in arrears,</L>
<L>In debt, alas! o'er head and ears.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh, with what joy, what thanks and praise,</L>
<L>To the great length'ner of her days;</L>
<L>What feelings, not to be outdone,</L>
<L>Tow'rds her dear John, her only son,</L>
<L>Did the good parent take her station,</L>
<L>And kindly own the obligation!</L>
<L>And now his tenderness she pays,</L>
<L>By helping in a thousand ways.</L>
<L>Deck'd in her best, she comes in view,</L>
<L>And serves the shop from twelve to two;</L>
<L><PB N="18" REF="037158_0017_100CDD99A8833B28"/>
Knows not each price, perhaps, quite pat,</L>
<L>Yet keeps the croud in civil chat,</L>
<L>Till John himself comes up to sell</L>
<L>A yard of lutestring, or an ell:</L>
<L>Next to the cook her aid she brings,</L>
<L>And does a hundred little things:</L>
<L>Loves her own self to lay the cloth,</L>
<L>To dress the sallad, skim the broth:</L>
<L>At shelling peas is quick and nimble,</L>
<L>Tho' now grown tardy with her thimble;</L>
<L>And always puts you quite at ease,</L>
<L>Walks out, and leaves you, if you please:</L>
<L>Plain as she seems, has much good sense,</L>
<L>And hence she never takes offence;</L>
<L>And all agree, for all are lenient,</L>
<L>The good old Lady's quite convenient.</L>
<L>Yet let me add, if things go wrong,</L>
<L>Madam soon shews her fears are strong;</L>
<L>And then she gives a certain spice</L>
<L>Of plain and downright good advice;</L>
<L>Talks in a most convincing tone,</L>
<L>Of what <HI>she'</HI>s seen, and what <HI>she'</HI>s known;</L>
<L>And in a way that vastly wins,</L>
<L>Will warn you of her own past sins:</L>
<L>Tranquil at eve, in elbow chair,</L>
<L>Tells what her former follies were;</L>
<L><PB N="19" REF="037158_0018_100CDD9BD44B57D0"/>
Recounts her dangers, nice escapes,</L>
<L>Sad sufferings once, and aukward scrapes;</L>
<L>And while she paints her varied life,</L>
<L>Adds wisdom e'en to Johnny's wife:</L>
<L>John, warn'd of her, each matter weights,</L>
<L>And Nancy trembles and obeys.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus, some old seaman, once so brave,</L>
<L>And buffeted by wind and wave,</L>
<L>Of the rude seas too long the sport,</L>

<L>Upright upon his mere hind heels;</L>
<L>So have we started at the view</L>
<L>Of what our John is now to do,</L>
<L><PB N="21" REF="037158_0020_100CDD9F07B822A0"/>
Have gaily frisk'd it round and round,</L>
<L>Nor gain'd as yet an inch of ground.</L>

<LG>
<L>Come, gentle Muse, the tale declare,</L>
<L>Sing how this bold advent'rous pair,</L>
<L>With mother brave, and willing daugh∣ter,</L>
<L>March'd to the borders of the water.</L>
<L>Sing how they trod the beach so steep,</L>
<L>Gaz'd at the wonders of the deep,</L>
<L>And stopt to view, as in a trance,</L>
<L>The awful ocean's vast expanse;</L>
<L>Then gaz'd at ev'ry passing boat,</L>
<L>Till they quite long'd to get on float.</L>
<L>The boatmen, as they cross the Strand,</L>
<L>Spring from an alehouse just at hand;</L>
<L>All on the party down they burst,</L>
<L>And each is sure that he was first.</L>
<L>Oh! how they press and fill the ground,</L>

<L>Each to a Lady makes his suit,</L>
<L>Till Nancy starts, as at a brute:</L>
<L>While prudent Johnny, marching down,</L>
<L>Hires a snug boat for half a crown,</L>
<L>Of smaller size, but stiff and tight,</L>
<L>And having seen that all is right,</L>

Rallies his daughter, claims his wife,</L>
<L>Burst through the croud and ends the strife.</L>

<LG>
<L>And now with self complacent grin,</L>
<L>The favour'd boatmen hands them in;</L>
<L>But first he plants, as is his rule,</L>
<L>On the wave's edge his little stool,</L>
<L>And while he begs them to take care,</L>
<L>Presents his elbow high in air.</L>
<L>All in they stept, all down they sat;</L>
<L>All safe, all even, and all flat:</L>
<L>The boatmen pushes off the boat;</L>
<L>Was e'er such treasure all afloat!</L>
<L>And now amid the sun's bright gleam,</L>
<L>See how they cut the silver stream!</L>
<L>See how the breeze begins to play!</L>
<L>See how it wafts them far away!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Scarce had the party lest the shore,</L>
<L>When Ruffman longs to spare his oar,</L>
<L>Points to the bench where lies a sail,</L>
<L>And begs to profit by the gale.</L>
<L>At first the boatman's words appal,</L>

Mean time old Ruffman, with a sneer,</L>
<L>Forbids each vain and silly fear;</L>
<L>Talks of the seas that he hath cross'd,</L>
<L>Beaten, and blown, and tempest toss'd;</L>
<L>Tells of his dangers now no more,</L>
<L>While a green youth in days of yore,</L>
<L>Of feats perform'd by way of fun,</L>
<L>And boasts of matches he has won:</L>
<L>Then drops his tone, and quite allays</L>
<L>All the new fears he seem'd to raise;</L>
<L>Pleads his great care, asserts his skill,</L>
<L>Begs each dear Lady'll dread no ill;</L>
<L>For if he keeps the rope in hand,</L>
<L>The water's just as safe as land.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus all objections down he beat,</L>
<L>And now the awful sail is set;</L>
<L>Ah how! how they plough the whit'ning seas,</L>
<L>So fine, so glorious is the breeze;</L>
<L>How fresh and cooling too the air,</L>
<L>While the sail shades them from the glare;</L>
<L>The boatmen, who a while before</L>
<L>Sat coatless, heated at the oar,</L>
<L>Now lolls his ease, observes the wind,</L>
<L>Steers with one careful hand behind;</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="037158_0023_100CDDA661AE2588"/>
While his right fist holds hard the sail,</L>
<L>Resists or humours well the gale;</L>
<L>Then half-appearing to turn back,</L>
<L>At once he stops and makes a tak;</L>
<L>Points at the distant land once more,</L>
<L>And seems to run you right ashore;</L>
<L>But ere he lets you quite touch ground</L>
<L>Again he spins his vessel round,</L>
<L>And shifts across, with skill so nice,</L>
<L>The flutt'ring canvas in a trice;</L>
<L>Scuds o'er the spacious seas again;</L>
<L>Again he plows the mighty main;</L>
<L>Again the less'ning shore retires,</L>
<L>Woods, hills depart, and distant spires</L>
<L>While the bright sun, yon clouds between</L>
<L>Shines forth and gilds the glorious scene.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The party, eas'd of all their fright,</L>
<L>Gaze round and round with sweet delight▪</L>
<L>Praise with one voice both land and seas,</L>
<L>And now they languish for a breeze;</L>
<L>Dread lest the slack'ning wind should fail,</L>
<L>And welcome every growing gale:</L>
<L>Swift o'er the swelling waves they fly,</L>
<L>And pleasure beams in every eye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="25" REF="037158_0024_100CDDA86AD276A0"/>
<L>But, ah! how oft with genial sun,</L>
<L>While the gay course of life we run,</L>
<L>And fancy as we taste the treat,</L>
<L>Our human bliss is now complete:</L>
<L>How oft in that same favour'd hour,</L>
<L>Does the whole sky begin to lour!</L>
<L>The cheering sun-shine's pass'd away,</L>
<L>There comes a dreary doleful day:</L>
<L>Afflictions gather like a cloud;</L>
<L>The swelling tempest roars aloud;</L>
<L>While from yon threat'ning heav'ns so dark,</L>
<L>It thunders round our little bark:</L>
<L>Unskill'd to struggle thro' the breeze,</L>
<L>We toss in new and troubl'd seas,</L>
<L>And life's gay morning all so bright,</L>
<L>Ends in some woeful tale at night.</L>

<HEAD>PART IV.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>COME, mournful Muse, and now relate</L>
<L>The awful change in Johnny's fate,</L>
<L>And while the doleful song is sung,</L>
<L>Tell from what cause the ruin sprung.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Cool'd by the breeze, and half undrest,</L>
<L>The rough gale blust'ring round his breast,</L>
<L>Robb'd of the sun's bright noon-tide ray,</L>
<L>And oft besprinkled by the spray,</L>
<L>Forth from you bottom of the boat</L>
<L>Old Ruffman lugs his sailor's coat,</L>
<L><PB N="27" REF="037158_0026_100CDDAD003D4B68"/>
And while he casts the jacket on,</L>
<L>Leaves rope and rudder all to John.</L>
<L>Ah! now begins the tragic tale,</L>
<L>For now the landsmen holds the sail!</L>
<L>He sees around the watery realm,</L>
<L>Yet goes and seizes on the helm;</L>
<L>And seated just in Ruffman's place,</L>
<L>Shews his cock'd hat and tradesman's face:</L>
<L>And now, without one sailing art,</L>
<L>E'en simple Nancy bears a part;</L>
<L>Sits playful by her father's side,</L>
<L>And light and gay, and merry-ey'd,</L>
<L>Holds with that hand that held a fan,</L>
<L>Rude ropes, as if she were a man,</L>
<L>While idle Ruffman, freed from care,</L>
<L>Half sleeping earns his easy fare.</L>
<L>—But hark! from yonder distant shore,</L>
<L>Did you not hear the thunder roar?</L>
<L>See! See! the vivid light'nings play,</L>
<L>And the dark cloud deforms the day:</L>
<L>Now too there comes the whistling breeze,</L>
<L>And sweeps the rudely swelling seas;</L>
<L>Fill's with one blast the sail so full,</L>
<L>Wife, mother, daughter, help to pull.</L>
<L><PB N="28" REF="037158_0027_100CD5D2E88E1098"/>
Now sailors, if it seems to blow,</L>
<L>For safety let the canvas go;</L>
<L>But women, not like passive men,</L>
<L>In vengeance always pull again.</L>
<L>Besides, as each her strength apply'd,</L>
<L>Each crouded on the leeward side;</L>
<L>And though a lady's like a feather,</L>
<L>E'en feathers weigh when heap'd toge∣ther.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fierce blows the whirlwind, and o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> course</L>
<L>The lad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> double all their force;</L>
<L>Each pulls and strains, and tugs and strives,</L>
<L>Like people pulling for their lives;</L>
<L>John, honest landsmen! simply lets them;</L>
<L>Fear lends them strength, and oversets them.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fain would I urge the frighted Muse</L>
<L>To paint the scene which next ensues—</L>
<L>To tell how Ruffman, rous'd from sleep,</L>
<L>Fell headlong down amid the deep;</L>
<L>Then mounting, ey'd the distant shore,</L>
<L>How Nancy sunk to rise no more—</L>
<L><PB N="29" REF="037158_0028_100CDDAF23CB2988"/>
But ah! we'll leave it quite alone,</L>
<L>'Twould break methinks a heart of stone.</L>
<L>—Plung'd in the deep, half lost in death,</L>
<L>Struggling and panting hard for breath;</L>
<L>John thought to struggle now no more,</L>
<L>When his hand lights upon an oar;</L>
<L>His chin uplifted o'er the wave,</L>
<L>He thus escapes a watery grave;</L>
<L>Saves, hardly saves his wretched life—</L>
<L>Bereft of mother, daughter, wife!</L>
<L>Thus dearly for his fault he pays;</L>
<L>Henceforth a mourner all his days.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here ends the tale—My friends arise</L>
<L>And wipe, I pray, your weeping eyes:</L>
<L>My fable—did you think it true?</L>
<L>Was fram'd in fact to picture you;</L>
<L>So next I'll preach to all the nation;</L>
<L>And first, ye sons of Innovation!</L>

<LG>
<L>When Britons, wearied with their lot,</L>

<L>When Frenchmen lead the mazy dance</L>

<L>They're leaving land to try the wave;</L>
<L><PB N="30" REF="037158_0029_100CDDB0C2FAF468"/>
They're quitting ancient house and home,</L>
<L>Mid the wild winds and seas to roam.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When coblers meet in grand debate,</L>
<L>And little folks feel vastly great;</L>
<L>When each forsooth would quit his station,</L>
<L>And Jack and Will would rule the nation,</L>

<L>Such ladies never mend my hopes—</L>
<L>Here Nancy's handling all the ropes.</L>

<L>When Parker rules as grand dictator,</L>

<L>When seamen sit like kings in state,</L>

<L>And flush'd with joy, resolves to stand</L>
