<P>AND ALL JUDAH AND JERUSALEM MOURNED FOR JOSIAH.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE mourning of affectionate survivors for deceased friends, prevails among all kindreds and languages on earth without exception; it is co-ex∣tended with death's unlimited sway, and will descend down through the unborn ages of all future time, 'till the universal conqueror shall be subdued. The custom is not blameable, but eminently laudable, as evincing a tender susceptible disposition which both Reason and Revelation approve.</P>
<P>THE mourning of States and Nations over con∣spicuous merit departed, is likewise common and equally commendable. When transcendently useful characters are removed, the loss must be severely felt, and will be sincerely deplored. Let the lamentations of both kinds proceed even to an extreme—palliating circumstances may induce us to commiserate the extravagance as a pardonable weakness, rather than blame it as a criminal excess. Corresponding appearances of the impressions made will be displayed,
<PB N="4" REF="036802_0003_100B10F999CD25F8"/>
lively evidences of them will be exhibited, on every suitable occasion. Should these indications of inward distress also pass moderate bounds, sympathetic spec∣tators will again find an adequate apology. Persons dear to us as our own souls are taken forever away. "The survivors die"—no testimony of regard seems too great to bestow on their precious memories. With equal readiness the heart and hand expand to attest our veneration for the father of his country, for the friend of mankind called from the land of the living. Superior attainments in religious excellence may give some an extraordinary self-command, which enables them to controul the usual tenderness of hu∣manity, so as to restrain expressions of grief within so∣ber limits. Such acquisitions will shew their reality in an habitual course of exemplary virtue; where this is wanting, and a steady attention is paid to the dictates of cool deliberate saving, under sore bereavements▪ we perceive not the energy of religious principle, but genuine proofs of an unfeeling and insensible make. We do well then to imitate the conduct of the He∣brews mentioned in the text, when a similar occur∣rence brings it to our remembrance, and recommends it our adoption.</P>
<P>THE favorite of God and Man for whom they sorrowed, gave early presages of future eminence, and 'till near the fortieth year of his life in which he fell, undeviatingly realized their fond expectations. It is no wonder if they wailed their irreparable loss in unusual strains of woe. To mourn for him was made an ordinance in Israel to be annually observed,
<PB N="5" REF="036802_0004_100B10FB945CFB70"/>
a book of lamentations was composed for the purpose. When any signal calamity befel them afterwards, they compared their distress to the mourning for Jo∣siah, as the most expressive representation of its dread∣ful extremity.—May no vengeful hand be permitted to renew the degree and extent of sorrow excited in our Nation by the melancholy event which we now commemorate.</P>
<P>IT has been observed that the practice of man∣kind in this respect rests on the best and soundest-principles. Nature has implanted in our hearts ten∣der passions, which must therefore have objects adapt∣ed to work upon them, and call forth their opera∣tions. Without the last the first would prove unne∣cessary and improper. Nor does religion condemn their exercise, or attempt to destroy their existence, but cherishes and improves them both by precept and example. Peruse David's lamentation over Saul and Jonathan, whereby you will learn the sensibili∣ties of a Hero and a Saint under the sore pressure of deep-felt sorrow. "Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew upon you, neither let there be rain upon you, nor fields of offerings.—The beauty of Israel is slain on the high places; how are the mighty fallen and the weapons of war perished." Solomon tells us there is a time to weep and a time to mourn; but a greater than Solomon is here; Jesus wept; he wept at the death of a friend; he wept over the approaching ruin of Jerusalem; his conduct justifies the indulgence of private and public affections, per∣mitting both to be raised by suitable occurrences▪
<PB N="6" REF="036802_0005_100B10FD983A2600"/>
While on earth he was a man of sorrows and acquaint∣ed with grief. He died for sinners, and now exalt∣ed to glory inconceivable, he is touched with the feeling of human infirmity. May we be effectually engaged to rely on Him as our only Saviour from the tyranny of sin, and the restorer of our spiritual free∣dom.</P>
<P>THE meditations we are engaged in further ad∣monish us to enlarge our views, that we may realize the vanity of the surrounding scene, with relation to its present uncertainty and final consummation. Lo mighty Empires rise and fall! the power of one passes to the hands of another; constant revolutions agitate our trembling astonished globe; multitudes are busi∣ly employed in pulling down and in building up; myriads of human beings anxiously contrive and ar∣dently execute, according to the endless variety of parts assigned them, and the infinite diversity of situ∣ations in which they are placed. Soon will the num∣berless actors finish the drama to make room for oth∣ers, 'till the stage be removed. A few years of rapid flight will lay the whole present generation low; their successors must share the same fate, and ere long the end will come. Desolation hastens to overwhelm the most finished productions of nature, and the most durable monuments of art. Our own much loved country, not long since the theatre of eager and un∣certain strife, where freedom's intrepid defenders con∣tended valiantly in her cause, and established her In∣dependence, must partake in the universal ruin and sink into nothing. But what becomes of those vir∣tuous
<PB N="7" REF="036802_0006_100B10FFBA94B828"/>
patriots, who resented her wrongs, who vindi∣cated her rights, and repelled ignominious slavery from her affrighted shores? Must they perish in like manner, must they be obliterated from the scale of existence, and extinguished in the common mass of destruction? No—they awake from the repose of the grave, they arise out of their own ruins to live again.</P>
<P>WHILE we look forward with solicitude to the dissolution of the elements, and a triumphant re∣surrection, our proper business is to act our parts well, to perform faithfully the duties required in every progressive stage of our continuance, attending to the distinct calls and claims of each. The obli∣gation of this hour directs us to examine more fully than we have yet done, the talents, the qualities and functions of our first of citizens, whose death has occasioned the present meeting, whose death United America deplores, whose death, I am almost tempted to add, a widowed world bewails.</P>
<P>WHEN we reflect on the number, ability and zeal of his admirers, on the time elapsed since his re∣moval, on the elegance, eloquence and sublimity of eulogies consecrated to his memory, it may be pre∣sumed that the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is exhausted—but the theme is inexhaustable! And though a repetition of some things becomes unavoidable, it must gratify us to join the universal voice by considering the subject in our own peculiar way, according to our previous conceptions of its nature and excellence.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="036802_0007_100B11023251F158"/>THO' various appointments civil and military were conferred on him, and honorably executed by him, notwithstanding his juvenile years, previous to the defeat of Gen. <HI>Braddock,</HI> in the year 1755; yet my ob∣servations shall commence with that memorable event, which spread more trepidation and dismay through America, than the most brilliant victory at∣chieved by our enemies during the whole revolution∣ary war. On that inglorious and disgraceful day GEORGE WASHINGTON acted as a volunteer aid to the British commander, and it is said he was the only officer on horseback who withdrew from the bloody field without a wound. More ex∣posed than most, braving danger with that fearless intrepidity which never forsook him, no hostile wea∣pon prospered, which aimed to injure or take away his life. This and similar uncommon deliverances from apparently inevitable PERILS, made a Clergy-man of our Church express himself thus in a printed note on a discourse.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Rev. <HI>Samuel Davies,</HI> then a citizen of Virginia, af∣terwards President of New-Jersey College.</NOTE> "As a remarkable instance of a martial spirit, I may point out to the public that heroic youth Colonel WASH∣INGTON, whom I cannot but hope provi∣dence has hitherto preserved in so signal a manner for some important service to his country." How prophetic a hope! how completely realized in the se∣quel! how striking the interposition of that Being, who can cover the warrior's head in the day of bat∣tle! But I cite the passage to shew you further the
<PB N="9" REF="036802_0008_100B110436D12848"/>
expectations he must have raised, and the estimation in which he must have been held at an early period, to justify the remark from a very respectable author. These will inform you sufficiently af∣ter what manner he <HI>had</HI> conducted himself, and how perfectly the commencement of his effulgent day agreed with its progress and conclusion.</P>
<P>IT is not necessary to specify the share he after∣wards bore in the then war, on retiring from which he formed a most auspicious conjugal union, and pursued the dignified occupation of a farmer, im∣proving a large estate with commendable industry and success; fulfilling his engagements with punc∣tilious honor; inspiring with uncommon respect every description of citizens, avoiding ostentation and pa∣rade, but supporting an elegant hospitality, and dis∣playing a handsome stile of living, suited to the opu∣lence of his circumstances. In this interval like∣wise, he accepted the trust of Delegate to the Assem∣bly of Virginia, and of Magistrate on the Judiciary Bench of his county. How well he improved the opportunities thereby afforded him to understand ci∣vil rights, and learn to respect them, fully shone thro' his subsequent behavior on many tempting and trying occurrencies.</P>
<P>A CRISIS approached which brought him to act in a more conspicuous sphere. It became necessary for the American people to assert their privileges by an union of Councils, to denounce encroachments made on them, and expose certain ruinous principles adopted, which threatened their total subversion. To
<PB N="10" REF="036802_0009_100B110661134CE8"/>
accomplish these <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> designs, a Congress was ap∣pointed to be held, con<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ting of deputies from the thirteen provinces into which they were at that time divided. And it so happened, without the existence of any prejudice or partiality; without the discrimination being designed, that native sons of America were uni∣versally selected on the great conjuncture. A review of the appointments revealed a remarkable fact, which I mention as truly honorable to the American cha∣racter. Our future protector attended that august assembly, inferior to none ever elected to transact our political concerns.</P>
<P>IT soon appeared that a sharper weapon than the pen must be employed—the sword was drawn, and entrusted to the hands of GEORGE WASHING∣TON, as commander in chief, by an unanimous vote of Congress, cordially seconded by the warm appro∣bation of their constituents. Willingly would he have declined the commission, and preferred any other man who might be supposed qualified to fill the elevated and enviable office. No such man could be found—the salvation of his country called on <HI>him</HI> to accept the high trust, and he obeyed the call. For a while his want of military experience was reckon∣ed a disadvantage; other military characters were therefore looked to for supplying the defect. The fallacy and folly of these impressions soon yielded under convincing evidences of the contrary, and he gradually rose to the summit of unbounded confi∣dence. Civil authorities seemed to depreciate; sus∣picion, distrust and jealousy threatened extensive mis∣chief
<PB N="11" REF="036802_0010_100B110830B9D8B0"/>
—but all believed in him as their bond of union and centre of security. While he lived and led our armies, we thought ourselves safe, if our safety under Providence, was to be accomplished. Severe reverses transiently tarnished his glory; provoking disap∣pointments deeply wounded the feelings of his manly breast—still he bore up with unbending firmness. Accumulated disasters and unparalleled trials could not shake his confidence. Terror and consternation seized the thousands of Israel—yet he remained un∣moved and immovable; never despairing, never de∣pressed, always prepared to improve every opportuni∣ty and make the best of every situation. No dread of reproach, no impatience for the glare of momentary conquest could tempt him to hazard the fate of his country, or relinquish those prudent maxims which his enlightened judgment embraced and confided in for ultimate success. How vigilant and discerning was he in chusing suitable instruments to retrieve or conduct affairs thro' the vast, the extended variety of the hostile scene? Whose merits did he ever refuse to appreciate; whose glory did he attempt to dimin∣ish; at whose praise did he sicken, tho' his own vo∣luntary sacrifices and masterly arrangements laid the foundations of their fame? His mighty soul disdained emotions from the most hateful, perhaps the most general passion that disgraces human beings. View him at the head of an undisciplined mutable army, incompetently officered, suffering intolerable hard∣ships from various sources.—Observe him soothing refractory civil functionaries, uniting divided coun∣cils, reconciling discordant interests, conducting cor∣respondencies,
<PB N="12" REF="036802_0011_100B110AC2A05D00"/>
whose diversity, magnitude and per∣plexity were sufficient to engross the time and reflex∣ions of an individual without other employment.— Consider him pressed by all this huge weight of com∣plicated business—then ask, what civility, written or verbal, did not he acknowledge? What attention did not he return, thro' the whole, even down to the inferior compliment of a common salute? Such traits afford intelligent observers the clearest insight into the human character, and enable them to make a just estimate of its real worth. Great minds alone can attend to what is great and small in their proper place and connexion—which will not be permitted to make mutual encroachments, nor will the perform∣ance of the one absorb a regard for the other.</P>
<P>WHEN our finally victorious and apparently ne∣glected army were almost ready to revolt—when treated in their opinion with injustice and cruelty, some meditated redress by the terror of their arms— how tempting a prospect opened for an ambitious leader to gratify the feverish wishes of his heart, and seize that prize for which seas of blood have been often shed? Without a pang of suspense or an instant of hesitation, this leader arrests the rising spirit with irresistible decision, quells the dangerous tumult, and restores a perfect calm. To the uninterrupted respect he paid the civil rights of mankind; to the venera∣tion he invariably shewed for the laws, together with-his farewell address and subsequent personal deport∣ment, we may without offence ascribe in part a pecu∣liar characteristic in that highly and justly celebrated
<PB N="13" REF="036802_0012_100B110CCC02C4A0"/>
band. No army ever restored to their country so large a proportion of orderly, industrious citizens, who cheerfully resumed the occupations of civil life, and successfully cultivated the useful arts of peace.</P>
<P>IT is not an article in the creed of a Republican or of a Christian, that the safety of a country de∣pends on the life and actions of any one man. This was acknowledged here during the continuance of our Revolutionary War; at the same time it was ar∣dently prayed—it became the prayer of America, that we might not be put to the trial of carrying on that war under the direction of any other command∣er. The supplication met a gracious hearing.—Un∣der his auspices the important contest concluded in splendor and prosperity; Independence rested on a solid basis; our nation took rank among Thrones and Dominions under the sun, and he retired to his farm covered with glory, followed by the sincere ap∣plauses of grateful and admiring millions.</P>
<P>HIS native State, wishing to express the lively sense they entertained of his transcendent worth and mag∣nificent atchievments, came forward with an offer in the most delicate manner, which he might have ac∣cepted without impeaching his reputation in the smallest degree. Subordinate commanders accepted similar compliments for inferior performances, nor did or could the least imputation attach to their ac∣ceptance, in any respect. Had he complied with the proposal, not the only one made, it would have been followed by others of the same kind; it would have grown into fashion; we should have beheld rival
<PB N="14" REF="036802_0013_100B110F02ECEAA8"/>
States contending for pre-eminence in grateful retri∣butions. But his resolution was, when he assumed the supreme military command, in his own empha∣tic words, "to shut his hand against every pecunia∣ry recompence"—from which nothing could move him thro' the whole of his future public course.—He had no descendants to provide for, you may surmise, and therefore insinuate that he had no inducement to augment his estate—Say then ye sagacious judges of human nature, whether thirst and quest of gain ex∣clusively apply to those who have posterity to ag∣grandise and enrich, while they reach not hearts un∣moved by parental feelings? The experience and ob∣servation of the present day—the recorded experi∣ence and observation of the days that are past throw contempt upon your position, and furnish its com∣plete refutation. He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver, nor he that loveth abundance with increase, but constantly covet additional sup∣plies: whereas he whose native grandeur of mind raises him above the ignoble and sordid attachment, remains contented with his possessions, and displays the independence of a disinterested spirit, which holds it more blessed to give than to receive. Conforma∣bly to these observations we represent our now de∣parted benefactor declining emoluments annexed to his public functions, refusing rewards for superemi∣nent exploits, patronising designs of public utility, considering the poor with judicious attention, and completing the benevolent catalogue by the distri∣butions of his last testament.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="036802_0014_100B1110B2348618"/>THE Government first adopted for the Union proved essentially defective, inadequate to the pur∣pose of its institution—a change became indispensa∣bly necessary. A Convention was called to under∣take the arduous work, from whose enlightened la∣bors proceeded our invaluable Federal Constitution. As his engaging in that service might not prove te∣dious or severe, and as all the wisdom of his counsel and all the weight of his authority were necessary to assist and sanction the proceedings—his aid was ex∣pected—the late Commander of our Armies accord∣ingly consented to accept a new civil appointment▪ and presided in the Assembly. Having discharged this trust with faithfulness and ability, we might suppose him excused from every future employment of a pub∣lic nature.</P>
<P>A harder task awaited him than any yet attempted. Who shall preside in introducing the adopted frame; in arranging its departments; in administering its executive branches; in establishing precedents to re∣gulate its future operations? Many pens were brand∣ished against it; many shafts were aimed at it, not∣withstanding the venerable sanction it could boast;— violent opposition was dreaded; the dissolution of the Union was apprehended. What wisdom of counsel and weight of authority equal this exigence? Will WASHINGTON the Great commit himself in a station, where it is impossible but offences must come? Will he hazard on so stormy and perilous an ocean a richer treasure than ever was embarked? How imminent the danger of being wrecked; how
<PB N="16" REF="036802_0015_100B111328C4A540"/>
incalculable the loss! Had not he loved his country more than he valued his renown, he would have repos∣ed under the shade of those laurels which spread over him their unfading verdure. But personal considera∣tions yielded before public obligations; &amp; he received from the unanimous decision of his fellow-citizens the highest office they had power to bestow. High office indeed, of immense responsibility and uncertain issue! Wonderful Man—combining such various and rare talents, and devoting them invariably to the public good!</P>
<P>WHAT competition, what contention, what exer∣tion have been exhibited in Europe to gain Po∣land's once elective crown, inferior in consequence to the presidency of the United States? There the requisite unanimity resulted from fear and terror, from intrigue and art, from bribery and corruption —here the union of choice was unsought and un∣bought, free and unconstrained—out of the abun∣dance of the heart the mouth spoke. The same harmony of suffrage was renewed, and would have been repeated, had not the secure distinction been explicitly declined.</P>
<P>IN conducting a civil administration, among a free peo∣ple especially where the scene is new &amp; untried, multi∣plied difficulties will unavoidably occur. Every citizen has a right to think for himself—to judge of govermen∣tal measures—to declare his sentiments.—A great di∣versity of opinions must unavoidably prevail—fault will often be found with what is done, and with what is left undone, however the case may be. Many
<PB N="17" REF="036802_0016_100B11159BEC4508"/>
appointments are to be made. Applicants for offi∣cial honors and emoluments are numerous, earnest and urgent. Insinuation and address, importunity and misrepresentation will exert their influence, and mislead in spite of the most upright intentions. It is not within the compass of limited fagacity to make always the best selection, it is not an attribute of man to be infallible—'tis not in the nature of things possible to prevent exceptions and give universal sa∣tisfaction. Granting these several considerations their full force, what judgment would be passed on president Washington's administration, when he de∣clined the helm. Concerning David it is said, save in one instance—which we must und<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tand in con∣nection with its concomitants and consequences— "he did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life." Perhaps a similar qualified encomium on our first supreme magistrate would be concurred in even by those who withheld an approbation of all his measures, with this luminous attestation in favor of consummate internal rectitude; that at no period of his existence, had they any reason, or pretended any reason, to ques∣tion his ardent unabating zeal to promote the best in∣terest of America.</P>
<P>AFTER he has moved in the highest sphere so long, is it not presumable that the fruition of it has grown in∣to a fixed habit with him, rendering the continuance a desirable, an indispensable inherritance? The acquisiti∣on of chief command is the foremost wish of noble minds
<PB N="18" REF="036802_0017_100B1117A2633518"/>
—the desire of it is called their last infirmity. Weak and unfortunate rulers may have been driven into obscurity by weakness or misfortune—but "to descend voluntarily from the supreme to a subordi∣nate station, and to relinquish the possession of power in order to attain the enjoyment of happiness, seems to be an effort too great for the human mind." Such is the beautiful reflexion of Dr. <HI>Robertson,</HI> when mentioning the Abdication of <HI>Diocletian</HI> and <HI>Charles</HI> the 5th. However great the effort is, it has been dis∣played before our eyes under circumstances rendering it peculiarly striking and extraordinary. The abdi∣cating Emperors had already "impaired their consti∣tutions, and brought on the infirmities of old age." The retiring President retained the full health and strength, the vigor and activity of a strong body and sound mind, equal to the functions of his elevation, and fitted to relish the fascinating charms of his grandeur. But these were not the motives for his consenting to appear at the head of a mighty nation▪ When his country could spare his agency, no induce∣ment remained with him to continue in her service, and he resolved once more, "to pass the remainder of his days in honorable repose, and place his glory beyond the reach of fortune."</P>
<P>But will he again put all to risque, if that coun∣try's safety requires it? Will he relinquish beloved retirement in declining years, to encounter the vicis∣situdes of doubtful war? When he might have com∣manded, will he stoop to a grade which requires to obey? Matchless example of real magnanimity and
<PB N="19" REF="036802_0018_100B1119CA945408"/>
inflexible patriotism. Thro' the whole of his diver∣sified career the applauses of his fellow citizens were beyond parallel. Wherever he went, acclamations accompanied him; glowing addresses poured on him from every quarter. Nothing is more likely to in∣toxicate the firmest mind, making it inattentive to the frailty and mutability of humanity. Assailed by these, and knowing he was the theme of exuber∣ant praise in many different lands, his moderation and equanimity preserved their influence undiminished, unimpaired—no assuming airs of consequence, no displays of self-importance, no indications of inso∣lence marked a single word of his mouth, or action of his life. With what humility did he piously ac∣knowledge the interposition of Providence at proper seasons, and recommend a reliance on Almighty God for national blessings—How anxious was he to re∣cognise co-operation and assistance in transactions where he might have claimed exclusive merit? Af∣ter passing thro' a scene of so much celebrity, what old acquaintance did he forget; of what former friend was he ashamed; whose society did he de∣cline, among circles that knew him and were known by him previous to the era of his seductive elevation? This is Republican, in his life you have—in his life you had, a living lecture on Re∣publicanism—with heart-felt exultation I add that, he died in the Republican saith.</P>
<P>ATTEND the hero and statesman to the shade you find him entirely consistent, his private de∣portment augments the lustre of his public reputa∣tion.
<PB N="20" REF="036802_0019_100B111BC97E5410"/>
His character, in public and in private, is stain∣ed by no vice, disfigured by no vain affectation, no disgusting peculiarity or pitiable weakness, which have repeatedly debased the most exalted names. At the feat of his residence you trace the order and regularity of a camp without its rigor, discovering the sound clear understanding which will shew itself in every walk. His conduct may be compared to his style in composition, for they bear a strong re∣semblance of each other in dignity, uniformity, and propriety. Were I obliged to designate the most prominent feature in his rich portrait, perhaps my opinion would select the talent displayed by his writings. Destitute as he was of a learned education, and untrained in studies favorable to the exercise of the pen, his literary productions, are of themselves sufficient to secure for their author an everlasting me∣morial.</P>
<P>THUS far have we proceeded in our deli∣neation without perceiving any blemish, to wound our feelings, or make us change the general strain of well-earned praise. But let no character be pro∣claimed beyond the reach of danger, till death has done his work. Many celebrated men have to∣wards the last fallen from their eminence, and obscu∣red the splendid glory of an illustrious life. Many have survived their parts, and sunk down under mul∣tiplied imbecilities, the melancholy objects of sympa∣thy and compassion. How deplorable a sight, the breathing ruins of a great man, how mortifying to human pride his second infancy! Peradventure

some afflictive revolutions await America's favorite Son, whom we have till now beheld with unspeaka∣ble complacency and approbation. No, the gra∣cious God who gave him being, and distinguished his day with an uninterrupted flow of prosperity, was pleased to continue his beneficence till the short ill∣ness which laid him low. Do you wish to contem∣plate the mild radiance of his setting sun? Alas, that sun is set forever. I am able to gratify your desire by reading a letter from the Rev. Dr. MUIR, of Alexandria, written the 19th December, which con∣tains an interesting detail of particulars respecting the death we unfeignedly deplore.</P>
<P>"I RECEIVED yours last evening, upon my return from attending the remains of our illustrious neigh∣bor to the tomb—Friday the 13th, he had been riding among his farms, the day was damp and cold, he felt a little unwell at bed time, before morning he was extremely ill. He was unwilling to send for his physician, Dr. CRAIK, during the night, but sup∣posing bleeding might relieve him, one of his over∣seers who had been accustomed to bleed, was called in to do this office, and Dr. CRAIK was sent for in the morning. He found him sitting up, but was greatly alarmed at his situation. He bled him a se∣cond time, and called in Dr. <HI>Dick,</HI> with whom to con∣sult; Dr. <HI>Brown,</HI> from Port Tobacco had also been sent for. Dr. <HI>Dick</HI> bled him a third time. The disorder was the croup. When Dr. <HI>Dick</HI> arrived breathing was difficult, and he swallowed with pain, yet he endeavored to get down whatever medicines
<PB N="22" REF="036802_0021_100B111F6518E708"/>
were prescribed. He desired Mrs. <HI>Washington</HI> who was in the room, to take a certain key and bring him two papers. He looked over them with care. Take that one, said he, and put it in the fire, this one is my last will. He spoke little, finding it almost im∣possible to articulate. Towards the conclusion of the day he said to the physicians: "Gentlemen, you have done your duty, let me now die in peace." Then he undressed and went to bed. He enquired at 9 and 10 the hour. "I die hard said he to his physicians, but I hope I have nothing to fear." A few minutes before he expired, he said, my breath grows very short, and at the moment of death shut his own eyes and mouth, and went off without a groan. These circumstances shew great strength of mind, which even death could not shake. The corpse retained marks of firmness impressed in the countenance which could not be observed without astonishment and respect: I supposed you would be gratified by these circumstances, which I know from the Physicians themselves, &amp; therefore cannot ques∣tion their Accuracy."</P>
<P>SUCH was the latter end of GEORGE WASH∣INGTON, raised up by providence to make a most distinguished figure on this mortal Theatre, deter∣mined to render his country essential advantages, in the most eventful and awful periods of her history— advantages far more and greater than any other in∣dividual ever rendered any Nation under Heaven. His country—defended by his arms, guided by his counsels, adorned by his accomplishments &amp; immortalis∣ed

by his fame—his greatful country, penetrated with a just sense of his transcendent worth, has dedicated this day to commemorate his virtues, and to detail his services—they exhibit to our view not a perfect man, but the greatest and best of men among the living or the dead.</P>
<P>SHOULD the remembrance of our grand national transactions reach an approaching world, and reflex∣ions on them share in its exalted employments; those virtues and those services, now consigned to the perishable records of time, will survive the last flame, and live in the annals of eternity.</P>

<P>ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, creator and upholder of the universe; preserver and governor of the world: thy presence fills all places, thy Pro∣vidence embraces all nations and ages. Thou rulest in the kingdoms of men, and givest them to whomsoever thou pleasest. In exercising sovereign sway, thou preparest fit instruments to accomplish thy various designs of pulling down and building up. Thou impartest of thy spirit to the children of men, in such portions as are required by the des∣tinies they are ordained to fulfil; counsel is thine and sound wisdom; thou hast understanding, thou art strength. We desire unfeignedly to bless thee for the illustrious character, whose memory has been this day honored among us. To thy goodness we owe the rare talents with which he was endowed, to

thy guidance the eminent services he performed, to thy mercy the happiness and glory of his bright and useful life. In him we acklowledge the greatest &amp; best of men among the dead or the living, who tho' dead yet liveth by what he has said, and speaketh by what he has done. Render his name precious to the people of this land till the end of time. Let the remembrance of his public and private virtues excite others to go and do likewise, according to their different abilities and opportunities. It has pleased thee to take him from us by a short and painful dis∣ease, advanced in days and full of honor.</P>
<P>WE are silent and adore, humbly hoping that he was not removed in displeasure against us, and that thou wilt not with him withdraw thy loving kindness from our peaceful and prosperous nation. With thee is the residue of the spirit, we implore a continu∣ance of thy benevolent intentions, and a constant supply of suitable agents to execute these. We ask the same favors for other states and countries. Wherever or whenever any people virtuously contend for their just rights, may a leader be found to espouse their cause, like unto him whom thou didst gracious∣ly raise up for us in the hours of our need. Hasten the glorious period when violence shall be no more heard in any border, wasting or desolation in any land; when knowledge and virtue and liberty shall universally prevail, when the kingdom of this world shall become the kingdom of Jesus Christ, the only mediator thro' whom our supplications are humbly offered up to Thee. Our Father who art in Heaven, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
