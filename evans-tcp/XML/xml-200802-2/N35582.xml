<HEAD>THE CASE OF Robert M'Knight, A Bankrupt, Written by himself in Prison at Philadelphia, 1792.</HEAD>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>OM the month of August 1780, until March 1782, I was in partnership <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Hampton Rownd, on the close of which, it appeared that the profits were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 17—one half of which was mine. During this partnership, William Alli∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the executors of John Mease, had frequently called on me to assist him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ating his account for that estate. This I did, and, had a good deal of my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> then taken up with that business—no satisfaction for which has ever been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> nor for any writings performed by me for him since.</P>
<P>A suit had been brought against him before the orphans court in 1774, respect∣ing the commissions allowed by the register general on an account of that estate to September 1773. Matthew Mease and other legatees were dissatisfied with the sum of £2,420 commissions allowed to the executors, and their account was laid be∣fore auditors, who reduced the commissions to £1,500. This, William Allison, the acting executor demurred to, and a hearing was to have been had before the orphans court in 1775: but by reason of the departure of Matthew Mease to Eu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the latter end of 1774, and soon after that of his lawyer R. Tilghman to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Indies, no further step was taken in this business until the late war was pretty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> advanced, during which time the courts were not much troubled with civil <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ters. But in the year 1780, on the arrival of Matthew Mease from Europe, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tation issued to William Allison to appear before the orphans court with his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccount, which was done in December of that year. On this business I attended with William Allison to explain the account. Several meetings were had and in the spring 1781 the court gave a decision so as to allow £58 more for commissions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>han the auditors did. This decision respected the transactions of the estate so far only as September 1773. Another account was called for, of the transactions which had taken place from 1773 to 1781. This was drawn out by me and con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd of a full quire of paper, and when presented to the court was referred to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tors. I had to attend them several times and a great deal of my time was tak∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in drawing a statement of the case, which was somewhat complex, owing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he receipt of continental money, a variety of calculations, and other circum∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ances, not now necessary to relate. The report of these auditors was not satis∣factory, either to William Allison or the legatees, and an appeal was had to the supreme court; where if the advice of the writer had been followed, Wm. Allison would have saved some thousand pounds; but by suffering the cause to go to re∣ferees, the legal ground was lost and the referees decided in such manner as to do great injury to William Allison.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="046494_0002_10217829269238C8"/>It may seem trite and not at all pertinent to introduce the affairs of John <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> into a vindication of my conduct, but it appeared necessary to the writer to in what manner the partnership of Allison and M'Knight arose, because <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> been asserted that I was under great obligations to William Allison, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> verse is the truth: for it was in consequence of the frequent applications <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> William Allison made for my assistance in writing during the partners<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> M'Knight and Rownd, that he took a favourable opinion of my attention <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦siness, and of the safety of a capital should he employ one in a partnership, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> revolved in mind to be proposed. Early in 1782, I had resolved to close the par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ship of M'Knight and Rownd, and in several conversations with William A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> prior to its dissolution, I thought I could perceive that he had a desire to join <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in trade: this was as I then thought a more promising view than any I could expect b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> remaining the partner of Rownd. I had lived as a clerk to William Allison <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 1766 and 1767 and knew him then to be a man who had considerable wealth, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> believed that from that time, by the sugar baking business he had acquired <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more considerable property. I therefore concluded that such a partner would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> very valuable one, but in this I have found my mistake. On the same day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Rownd and I had resolved to part, William Allison proposed himself as a pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and asked me if £2,000 in cash would not be sufficient capital for him to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I told him I had upwards of £1,500 myself in trade, and that I thought with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sum he mentioned a clever trade might be supported in the retail way, as at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> time little or no credit was given. On the night of this same day John Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mentioned to me that he understood that Rownd and me had parted, and he a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me if I would have a partner. I told him it was too late for I had engaged: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> did not say with whom, for it was the wish expressed by William Allison that the business should be conducted under my name only, nor did it appear otherwise un∣til September 1783 when a store was opened at his house in Front Street. When the partnership commenced, the shop in Second Street was in want of printed goods, which I mentioned to William Allison and told him Mr. Woodward had an invoice, it would answer to purchase, amounting to near £400, on whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> could have a month's credit. The purchase was agreed upon, and late in Ap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> called on William Allison for the money to pay for this and other parcels whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were bought at vendue: he gave me £600, and while I was writing a receipt for it, he said "perhaps I might not like to be concerned in the goods you have on hand." The receipt was nearly finished when this observation was made, I there∣fore added words to this effect, that if a loss should obtain on the goods I had on hand at the commencement of the partnership, such loss should be charged to me. With this he was satisfied.</P>
<P>In the summer of 1782, two parcels of goods arrived from France, in which William Allison was interested. These were brought by him into the partner∣ship; but they consisted for a great part in Marseiles quilting for men's wear, dimit∣tys and other goods by no means saleable, many of which remained on hand seve∣ral years after the peace and were sold at vendue to a loss: these two parcels a∣mouted to about £1,600. A further sum of £150 in cash was put into the capi∣tal by William Allison this year. The business was chiefly conducted in 1782 and 1783 until the peace by purchases of invoices and at vendue, to amount of £400<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and the sales were very promising to amount of £6000 and upwards, and although the peace caught us with a considerable value on hand and reduced that value at least to one half, yet on a rough statement in December 1783 and on a low valua∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

the goods then on hand, a profit appeared of £2000 supposing them sold at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow valuation. While John Moylan was clothier General and when it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lt to procure funds by the government to pay the people who worked up the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng. I called on him with a friend and offered to supply those people to whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>derable amount was due, goods at retail prices, on his orders, provided he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to me the amount in notes of the financier, this he agreed to and I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and 1783 before the news of peace arrived to the amount of about which enabled the company to meet the fall in value of goods, much bet∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would otherwise have been the case, had not this speculation offered.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n summer of 1783 when I was at vendue buying such goods as I knew to be go∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> off low, a message was brought to me from William Allison by his son, to de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from purchasing any more at vendue. This I was chagrined at, because I knew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irst cost to be considerably above the prices I was buying at, and that we were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o vend the goods to a profit by retail. I however desisted, though at this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my own name only appeared in the business.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> August of this year three regiments of Massachusetts troops were ordered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hiladelphia, who had been paid three months pay for January, February <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arch of that year—one month in cash and two months in the notes of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ier. The officers and privates had drawn orders on their regimental paymast∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r other months in that year, and it was expected by the officers, that though the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y would be settled with up, and paid to the 1st of January 1783, with notes of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> paymaster General—yet that their future pay would be in money or the finan∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> notes. Some of the officers and privates had passed their orders for goods <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th several shopkeepers, and it was suggested to me by John Lisle sen▪ that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erhaps it would be a good speculation. On hearing this I called on Peter White∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of whom I had bought goods to a considerable amount to be paid for with the notes to be received from John Moylan, and I asked Whiteside's opinion: he said it seemed to be a good speculation, and gave me some goods to sell in that way, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> did Stephen Austin also. Whiteside promised to ask <HI>one</HI> who could give the best <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>formation. I was sitting at my door at night, when Samuel Caldwell was go∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> home and I mentioned it to him—he did not discourage it, but signified that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> called on him early in the morning, he would walk out with me to the en∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pment and consult major Gibbs. I called, we went out, and Gibbs gave it as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> opinion and as the expectation of the army, that their pay from January, would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> paid in cash and notes of the financier—but that some delay might take place. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmediately begun a sale, to the officers and soldiers of these regiments and con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ued it during five days to amount of 6000 dollars and upwards. In this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> been frequently to enquire whether the speculation was safe, but not until the fifth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y did Whiteside signify it was dubious. I then stopped further sales, and in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llowing year procured the paymaster General's notes for the goods sold. It may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be improper to add, that the goods were sold at fair retail prices such as I had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> selling at for cash, having had a good opinion that the money was safe, though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ht not be very soon obtained. And to prevent the least reflection that might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on this business, I would not sell to the privates but in presence of a Captain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>baltern, who staid to see that the men took no articles but such as were pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for apparel. They were therefore marched into town in companies under care of commissioned officers. The paymaster General's notes were exchanged for treasury notes and equally divided one half in the name of William Allison and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther half in my name—his half was delivered to his executor John Bleakley, on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e 10th of March, 1789. The drawing of such a sum out of a small capital, was
<PB N="4" REF="046494_0004_1021782C72895CD8"/>
no doubt a heavy inconvenience—but I contend it was with the most upright vie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and at worst can be termed an unfortunate speculation.</P>
<P>In September 1783, William Allison signified that he could wish to go into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whole sale business; that he had a good store unoccupied at his house in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Street; that he expected several sums of money paid in, that were out at int<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and he would be in time prepared to make remittance for goods to be imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> from England—intimating also, that if we could not punctually remit, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would only draw 5 per cent, and that borrowing here was not easily done <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> per cent. I was no doubt pleased with a prospect of increasing wealth, hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> then a growing family to provide for. Accordingly the uncut goods on hand at my dwelling in Second Street were moved to his house in Front Street to amount of £3000 and upwards, and purchases were made of invoices to amount of £5000, and in the fall of that year he applied to Jeremiah Warder for a letter of introduction to his brother John then in London to supply to my order a quantity of dry goods <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> exceeding £4000 sterling. The order was sent and goods shipt per the Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦merce Captain Truxton to amount of £1349 sterling and per the Prince of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Captain All to amount of £1367 sterling. Those by the Commerce arrived <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> spring 1784 to good sales—but those by the Prince of Leige were unfor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> carried to Fayal and left there until the ship Merchant came from Lond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> took them on board for Philadelphia. It was about September they arrived to a glutted market, and entirely out of time for the intended spring and summer sales▪ Here was a disagreeable situation, little money collected towards remittance, no hope of immediate or early sight of money for the certificates, which induced us to think of making no importation for one year at least. At this time it was my opinion that the whole stock of goods should be sold off at public sale and the mo∣ney thence arising laid out in balloon certificates, but William Allison would not hear of it. That kind of certificates were then about 2s9 to 3s in the pound, not counting the interest due on them, and in fact there was more interest due, than the purchase money would amount to. This speculation would have been attend∣ed with uncommon success, for,</P>
<P>In the fall of 1784, Francis Allison (nephew of Captain Allen formerly of the British navy, who died leaving his estate to be equally divided among the children of his three sisters, one of whom Francis Allison was) applied to William Allison to assist him in the recovery of his legacy. This was done by application to Mier<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Fisher who prepared the papers necessary for the identification of the person <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Francis Allison, and the house of Allison and M'Knight transmitted them to Warder &amp; Co. of London to obtain the legacy. While the writings were draw¦ing, it was considered, that as the sum was expected to be about £6000 sterling and that the Fishers house wanted £2000 in England, they would give a conditio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦al bond for that sum to Francis Allison for so much to be placed to their cre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>there</HI>—and pay him <HI>here,</HI> as he might have occasion for the money. It was there<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> concluded that the remaining £4000 should be placed to the credit of Allison an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> M'Knight with Warder &amp; Co. and a like conditional bond given and paymen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> made to Francis Allison, when knowledge was received of the application. Thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> being in this train, but a few small sums would have been necessary for our purpo¦ses <HI>here,</HI> had a sale and investment taken place such as I proposed.

These, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ile William Allison lived were sold <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>der the name of George Seneff, because William Allison would not have them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nown as ours. With the money thence arising and sums borrowed from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of David Caldwell and John Bleakley, those drafts were paid. In this year <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> consent of William Allison, the remaining goods were brought from his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to mine, where I had kept a few to sell by retail. Some were sold in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay, and much more sent to vendue—and to amount of £770 0 9 were sold to John M'Henry and Co. of Baltimore, which it is believed will with other claims of William Allison against the heirs of David Caldwell, extinguish any claim of that estate from his.</P>
<P>John Bleakley, in the year 1783, before his departure to Europe, appointed William Allison his attorney in fact, who at that time owed him as a balance of a former account £816. During his absence, the rent of Bleakley's Island and his other estates were received, money and bills remitted. Part of this business pas∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> through—the books of Allison and M'Knight, and appear therein when the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fections took place—other part of this business was done by William Allison, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o about a fortnight before his death (which happened suddenly on the 11th of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me 1787) told me, that he was pressed by John Bleakley for an account between <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem from 1783 to 1787. I accordingly drew out from the company books all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat had come to my knowledge—this I furnished, but it was not satisfactory. Then William Allison put his cash account for this estate into my hands, to draw out a full account of all the monies of Bleakley, had and paid by William Allison. This I did—and of course all the items of the account drawn from the books of the company, were included in this last account of William Allison, as the attorney in fact, for John Bleakley, the balance of which was £2518, in his favour: and to make the books of the company conform with this account, the balance of Bleakley's account in them was carried to the credit of William Allison. In the said <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccount William Allison makes a charge for commissions on the business done▪ of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>71.—no part of which ever came as a credit to the company; therefore, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hole was considered by me as a transaction which took place between William Alliso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and John Bleakley, and in this light it will be viewed now, as it was when the account was drawn out, because it is impossible to prevent the estate of Wil∣liam Allison from being liable to the estate of Bleakley, for the balance. Yet this debt of William Allison, has been claimed from me, and suit brought in the year 1790—to which special bail was given.</P>
<P>In March 1787, I was appointed a Justice of the peace, for Walnut w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd: the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecessary attention to the duties of which office, I soon found would employ the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eater part of my time and the emoluments, I expected would prevent my d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>w∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> out of the funds of the company, any sum of consequence. I had no hope <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m the deranged situation of the partnership, to expect to do more than close the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ounts in the best manner possible—which was well known to William All<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>son. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> April or May of this year, Levi Hollingsworth and Miers Fisher, who had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een appointed trustees for Francis Alison, urged a meeting to take place relative <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o his affairs. William Allison and myself went from his house, and on the way <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he told me, that should a mortgage be required on his house in Front street—he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould not refuse it. I then replied, that sooner than his real estate should be en∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umbered, I would consent to the sale of all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> goods at vendue, although it
<PB N="6" REF="046494_0006_10217831865C4FA8"/>
would be inevitable ruin to me. The conversation with Fisher and Hollingswo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> ended in this—that we would in the quickest manner obtain money to pay the debt—and on our return from Fisher's house, William Allison expressed his plea∣sure with the interview and could not account for how he got over giving a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣gage. It may not be impertinent here to note, that when it was known <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ladelphia, how much Francis Allison was to receive, viz. £8000 inste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> £6000 sterling, he made a deed of gift to his daughter of £1500 currency, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a like sum was to be secured for his wife. One of these was to remain with A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦son and M'Knight, on interest at 6 per cent. per annum. The sum applied <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our credit in London, of Francis Allison's legacy, was £5773 sterling, all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which has been paid or drawn for in favour of him, or his trustees, excepting only the £1500—with some interest and a part of a few notes.</P>
<P>The pressing demands for money, induced William Allison to ride into Bucks County on the 11th of June, 1787, to obtain payment of £800 long due—and to settle other matters. He left town in his usual good health, but died suddenl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> before night, in walking from one plantation to another. He was removed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> town, and after his funeral, a rough statement of the partnership effects was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦nished to his executors: some days after, John Caldwell expressed his fea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> John Bleakley as executor, would take the company claim against John M'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and Co. in payment of the claim of Bleakley against William Allison's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Caldwell seemed pleased, that I had got back the rough statement which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had furnished. Soon after, a particular inventory of the goods remaining on hand; was drawn out, and the goods were valued by John Smith and Joseph Swift. Hol∣lingsworth and Fisher, being pressing for payment of all but the £1500, I was con∣strained to dispose of the goods by public sale, with the privity of William Al∣lison, Junior, the only male heir of my late partner, then about twenty years of age. He took some of the goods to vendue himself, and paid the proceeds to Levi Hollingsworth. In October or November 1787, William Allison the young∣er died, after a short illness, and I continued making sale of the goods, principally at vendue, to make the necessary payments. Towards the end of this year, I settled the account of Francis Allison, with his trustees Fisher and Hollingswort<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by giving a variety of notes, payable at several times in 1788—the most of which were paid—some remained unpaid in the hands of Levi Hollingsworth—on which partial payments were made, until September 1789. At this time, suit was brought by Fisher and Hollingsworth—against me, on the bond for £4000 sterling and judgment was had in Ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y term 1790, with stay of execution until the 15th of September in that year.</P>
<P>Several applications had been made by the executor of William Allison, for a settlement of the partnership accounts, but it was impossible to render any sati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦factory account, until the whole of the goods were sold and such debts collecte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as there was a probability of being good—but an expectation I had of borrowin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> such sum as I might be found to owe the company, and a wish to procrastinate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> settlement, until I was enabled to make payment—as also waiting for the appr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ciation of the value of my share of the certificates, were motives that governe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and to me appeared insuperable barriers to the effecting such settlement. Besid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the executor was the creditor, of my late partner—and his claim was great. I was fearful that the few lands I had purchased for my children, would be sold from them—and I was certain that the landed property belonging to the heirs of my
<PB N="7" REF="046494_0007_10217834C58C5190"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tner, would be sacrificed. I therefore wished to procrastinate the settlement, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> order that not only my own certificates, but also those of the heirs—should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>preciate—for I knew my partner had a little before his death, at least 5000 dol∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in the public funds, which with 3000 of his in my hands and afterward de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>red his executor—was an object worth striving to save—his real estate in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>delphia, though valuable, could not have been sold at the time, at any thing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> its real worth: neither could his plantations in Chester county—nor his un∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed lands in Westmoreland and Northumberland counties. However, because <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> could not name a precise day, when the accounts should be settled—after the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>it was brought by Fisher and Hollingsworth—John Caldwell, brought an action <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> account render against me. This chagrined me much, because I had sacri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ced a great part of my share of the goods of the partnership to prevent the estate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the heirs from loss: and was striving and did prevent suit being brought for more than two years after the death of my partner; whereas had I opened up the business at his death, more loss to his heirs would have taken place, because his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> estate and certificates as well as the goods on hand, must have been sold at a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> value.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> may be objected that my share of the certificates obtained for the goods sold to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Massachusetts line, were not applied to pay the partnership debts: to this I answer, that it was my desire to retain them until they should be worth 20s. in the pound—but unfortunately for me I employed John Caldwell, to defend an action, which the Bank of North-America brought against me, as the drawer of two lent notes, one to Mease and Caldwell for 250 dollars—the other to Samuel Caldwell, after the death of James Mease, for 250 dollars to take up the former, both of which were left unpaid at Bank, by Samuel Caldwell, although he pro∣mised they should be taken up—and the president, while I was at Bank—on other business, was shewn these notes by one of the clerks, when he told the clerk not to mind, for that Mr. Caldwell promised to settle them. John Caldwell neglect∣ed to acquaint me of the day of trial, until the day before it, though he knew well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat I wished every legal delay to take place, and I suppose from the delicacy of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se, which I wished opened in court, he declined speaking to it. I then told <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im I would employ another lawyer, which I did with his approbation, who I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elieve did all he could to put it off, but was obliged to confess judgment, though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e said he could have procrastinated it, had he been earlier employed. This is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ufficiently confirmed by the management of another suit brought by the bank, against Allison and M'Knight, at the same time with that against me, which that lawyer kept off until April 1792—when judgment was given for £384 odd, whereas the other judgment was obtained in 1789: after which a <HI>fieri facias,</HI> issued <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich obliged me to sell a certificate of 2500 dollars, to make payment of about <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>00 dollars—the amount of the notes interest and costs, which I paid to William <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>wis. I sold the certificate to Matthew M'Connel; to whom I also sold the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mainder afterwards. Although suit was brought against me by the Bank for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ese notes—I considered that I was by no means liable to pay them, especially <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mease and Caldwell had two shares of Bank stock, which the directors had it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their power to apply in payment of them. They were lent notes and should have been taken up by Samuel Caldwell, for although I had an unsettled account <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith Mease and Caldwell—it is my belief <HI>that</HI> house on a fair settlement, will be found in my debt. The first note lent was for 1000 dollars, which was taken up at maturity, and another lent, for 800—this was taken up and another lent for 600 which was taken up and another lent for 400, this was also taken up, and another <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent for 250 which was <HI>not</HI> taken up, but another lent to take it up with; neither

of which were paid until judgment was obtained against me, when I was ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to pay them with near £.900 of my certificates, which, together with one hal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the losses in the partnership, will constitute the sum which will be found to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> greater part of my debt to the company. When Samuel Caldwell assigne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> effects to James Miller and Robert Millegan, in the list and opposite to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> stock, he writes—that if on a settlement of account between Mease and Cal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Robert M'Knight—they should fall in his debt—this stock should be a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the payment of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se notes—or words to this effect, as well as I can remem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the said list being left some time in my custody. But lately I have been infor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that the Bank had set off the stock of Mease and Caldwell, against some indo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ment of theirs for a friend.</P>
<P>On the 16th of September 1790, Miers Fisher and Levi Hollingsworth as tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦tees of Francis Allison had me taken on a casa—this I understood at the time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by the persuasion of the executor of William Allison, (which has been confirm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by a note lately received from Miers Fisher,) although it has been asserted o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦wise. Since that day I have been confined in prison; a great deal of slander <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hear has been passed upon me; no advantage has been obtained by my co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ment, without it be thought an advantage to oppress a man who has done <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was in his power to procrastinate the day of payment by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eirs of Willia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦son—for had suit been brought immediately on his death the estate would no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sold for one half, nay a third of what it will now sell for, the certificates belon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to it, if held to this time, are above par, and much less difficulty has arisen to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> heirs by the management of the company effects, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n would have taken place <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an earlier knowledge of the business of the partnership, and had I not had go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> reason to hope to obtain a loan sufficient to enable me to pay my debt to the com∣pany, I undoubtedly would have shewn such statement of the accounts as was i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my power. That other motives than those of prudence governed those who ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦sed my confinement, to the taking that step, is evident from this, that my ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦tels if taken on a <HI>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ri faci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> would have paid part of the debt, that a <HI>levari faci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> might then be had for my lands in Pennsylvania, and in case that they proved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦sufficient, a <HI>ca sa</HI> (should it be thought necessary) might still have been had t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I was under special bail for £.1200, and that every sentiment of honour must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> left me, before I would do any act, to prejudice the gentleman who was my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that I had a tye that would prevent my absconding (which my persecutors ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ended to suppose) a wife and five children, who could alone depend on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for support—one of whom by their inhumanity I was precluded a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight of, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dying, although it was much desired by the child, a boy of near nine years o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> every offer that could be made at the time proved nugatory, to the unfeeling pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦sons I had to do with, though no advantage would have been taken on my part.</P>
<P>A few days after my confinement some of my friends wished me to make o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦tures, which I did in writing to this effect, that if all the suits were withdraw <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would state the accounts charging each partner with his share of outstanding d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and bonds as also the real estate of the company, that then on a fair investigat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whatever sum should be found due by me to the partnership I would give my be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for, to the heirs of William Allison, to be paid by installments, and in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> time I would assign all my share of the debts, bonds and lands, as a security to t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> heirs.—But this offer was contemned. In August 1791, Doctor M'Henry calle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to see me a little before the death of Mrs. Allison, he seemed inclined to do e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> good office to obtain my enlargement, to whom I made this offer, that I w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> engage to pay two thirds of any salary I might obtain in any office, annually, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the extinguishment of whatever balance might be found due by me. But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tor took some pains in this business as he told me, yet the final an∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was, that nothing short of an assignment of all my effects would satisfy. This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould not consent to, because I considered that the landed property I had would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> than pay all my debts if time was given and I did believe that I could not be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a bankrupt, my case in strictness not coming within the bankrupt acts. On <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th of September 1792, John Lisle, Jan. called to acquaint me of an adver∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent which appeared that morning in Dunlap's paper, for an accountant i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of North America. This being an office which I could fill in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Mr. Lisle to call on John Bleakley and acquaint him that should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> would apply two thirds of the salary to the payment of my debt and wrote him in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hese words.
<Q>Sir, I understand that the bank of North America has adverti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed for a complete accountant, this office I am able to fill and if I should obtai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it, I engage to let two thirds of the salary go in extinguishment of the claim <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the heirs of Captain Allison or yourself may have against me, on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ment of the partnership accounts, which will not depend on me totally, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> must be established before the Supreme Court. The judgment against <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the bank will be looked for from the heirs: which may be prevented by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> industry of Robert M'Knight.</Q>
On the 7th not having had any commu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion with John Bleakley, and fearing the place in the bank might be fil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>other, I wrote the President in these words.
<Q>Sir, Having seen an advertise∣ment in Dunlap's paper for a complete accountant, for the bank of North America, and being conscious of my capacity of filling that office with advan∣tage to the institution and with honour to myself, and more especially being anxious for an exoneration by payment of the debt due to the bank for which judgment was obtained against me in April last—I offer my services to fill that office. I have signified my intention to John Bleakley the executor of Captain Al∣lison my late partner, and offered to apply two thirds of the salary towards the extinguishment of such balance as may be found against me, on a decision of the Supreme Court. As yet I have not received his full de∣termination—but I suppose should no obstacle prevent my approval by the directors—Mr. Bleakley will accept the proposed terms, and relieve me from a long, unprofitable and unnecessary confinement.

I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w, because I hear from a friend, who has been assured by one of the directors <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Bank, that a conversation was had, relative to the office for which I applied, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d that there was the highest probability that it would be given me, was I not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> confinement.

Notwithstanding th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> on my part, the managers for the heirs of William Allison, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦cept it. On the 26th of September, I wrote John Bleakley <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<Q>Sir, I did expect you would have called on me yesterday, with Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> well, when we might have talked over matters, for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Captain Allison. I think I could convince you, that the harthness of my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣finement, has produced no good to the heirs; but a temporary injury to them, and a very heavy loss to me. Two years confinement, from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of my industry, for a family, who depend on me for support, is not a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣nience. But setting aside every other consideration but that of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the heirs of Captain Allison, by my liberation—I assure you it was from that motive, more particularly than any other that I addressed you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in order to fill an office in the Bank, which would prevent the heirs <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> cal∣led upon for payment of the judgment obtain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the firm of Allison and M'Knight—than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> as well as the Bank, that I should fill the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mploy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> eye to my own advantage, I could not even suppose, you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tention to any overture of mine, since you took the harsh <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦finement under a <HI>ca sa</HI>—especially when you knew that I was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> specia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to an action of your own for £1200, and that sentiments of prop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> I hope will never leave me) would have prevented my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> or its neighbourhood.

the accounts of the partnership come to be closed, my actions will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in a favourable rather than a contrary light. What do I offer but thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the sum sound against me—not my own statement of it, but <HI>that</HI> first scru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by auditors, and afterwards reviewed and adjudged by the Supreme Cour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on this sum, I will continue to pay two thirds of such salary as may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me, in a public or private office, or at least the interest of the debt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> paid, or in failure thereof, to suffer the lands mortgaged to be so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ask is, that by complying with the payments stipulated, the lands <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for ten years. Every one knows that nothing near their value, can no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦tained for them, and that if any accident should happen to me, they will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦tually belong to the heirs. But this as I understand cannot be complied with unless a settlement of the partnership accounts take place first: this ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cannot be done with precision, until the present <HI>ca sa</HI> against me be satisfied, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is supposed to be satisfied. If I am to be confined until I find funds for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> payment, it may be a considerable time before I can find a friend, to advanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them, and then the heirs will be chargeable with the half thereof. But if it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> paid by them, I will be chargeable with one half of what they pay. If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Bank think proper to employ me, the heirs will be chargeable with on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> what I answer to the Bank—So it will follow with all other debts, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> partnership owes. As for those debts owed to it—each partner is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> one half, and when received (if assigned to the heirs) credit should be g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to me, for my half of such sum received. The losses will be charged in equal portions to each partner, and what the partnership owes to one, the other part∣ner will owe to it, or in other words, the balance of both partners accounts will be the same, only on different sides of the account. These principles of settle∣ment will meet the conviction of every mind, and a settlement on those p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ples will not bring me indebted to the heirs (as I think) so great a sum a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> balance due to you by Captain Allison, as stated by him in the account, he furnish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ed you May 28, 1787, which was £ 251872 and which comprised every receipt and payment for you, which came within the partnership, as well as the sums he used for his own purposes. I have understood indirectly, that you would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have kept me confined one minute on your own account—if this is truly rep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you have it in your power to take <HI>me</HI> for that balance, if I should be fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> much in debt to the heirs, secured by a mortgage as above mentioned, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the claim of the heirs should be established above that sum; which I much que<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦tion, such excess may be secured by the same real estate; which I am confident is more than sufficient to secure every just claim against me—especially as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> industry is also bound. This latter subject being within your power, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> less than I would do if our situations were changed—which is the only apol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦gy I can offer for mentioning it, for Mr. Caldwell, seemed disinclined throug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to mention any thing to you, that might any way lessen a responsibili<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the heirs, for the sums particularly chargeable to them by you. I know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> claim you have against them, is better secured than I can make it—but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> censure in any respect you may be induced to take—those lands of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> than contribute to the further confinement of Robert M'Knight.

When furnished with more facts, I can be more explicit. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you will believe me, when I assure you that no one deplored the necessity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> compelled the measure of confinement more than myself.</Q>
To th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> note <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the following answer.
<Q>Sir, Yours of this day reached me about 1 o'clock, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of yesterday I find, was dated one day earlier by mistake. Though y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u may have been urged by other than your own feelings to cause my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent, I think that after its continuance for upwards of two years, you me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edge it has produced no <HI>good,</HI> but great loss to me, and pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nted my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> make payment to the heirs. The accounts would have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he balance paid, had I not been disa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pointed in the loan <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble prospect of borrowing. The settlement will however <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ebt for which the <HI>ca sa</HI> was taken, is satisfied—while I am in my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tuation, the settlement can be made only on suppositions that may never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>duced to facts—and on facts alone, can the settlement be made. But when it is made, immediate payment cannot be expected, of a man however willing to exercise his industry, who has been so long precluded from that exercise, and whose character has, as he hears, suffered from the telling of one side of a story, only. To himself, being conscious of rectitude, such stories will not be felt—though they have too much weight in the minds of those, who will not take the trouble to hear the whole matter. The necessity for my confinement, I cannot see—the interest of the heirs of Captain Allison, would be more pro∣moted by the endeavours of those concerned, to obtain me such post, from the emoluments of which I might be enabled to make payment—rather than by a hindrance of the exercise of such talents as I possess, and would have employed for two years back,—for that purpose. And notwithstanding the error commit∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed by my confinement and the consequent loss that has taken place, I still hope to see the day, that I will be able to satisfy every debt by payment. I cannot tell how many years may be considered as necessary to keep me in a prison, in order to pay my debts—but I believe very few will suppose, that a continuance of the present harsh treatment, can hasten the wished for event. I rather sup∣pose that as the error is committed, it is continued, to keep up an appearence of consistency—but I know, if I had committed such an error, I would as early <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> possible, take such measures as are feasible to make things as easy as possible. The facts within your knowledge are, that since the death of Captain Allison, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have paid debts of the partnership above £1300, that I paid yourself 3000 dol∣lars in certificates—that the partnership owed two debts, on both of which judg∣ments have been had—that because you thought it would be advantageous to the heirs, you persuaded Hollingsworth to confine my person, by a <HI>casa</HI> for one of them,—that although two years have elapsed no payment has been made by me, that the settlement of the partnership accounts must depend on facts—that those facts cannot be ascertained while my confinement continues—that I have cer∣tain lands in Northumberland county Pennsylvania, which I am willing to mort∣gage as well as my half of others in Virginia and Kentucky, if it is agreed to
<PB N="14" REF="046494_0014_1021784990F0BB20"/>
accept them in a way safe for myself, and not unsafe for the heirs—th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there was a probability of obtaining a good office in the Bank, and in o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pay the whole of a debt against the partnership, I made such overtures <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as almost any distinterested person will say were proper, because you as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦tor can be accountable for no more than does reach your hands—that tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> might have scruples as an executor, yet the estate being in your debt, to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erable amount—you can without the least blame, take a debtor of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> instead of the heirs [yet I dont urge this, because I do not cons<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦pert as being as fully sufficient as theirs]—that I had an equal sum in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with those delivered you—that I was obliged to sell the greater part of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pay a judgment obtained by the Bank for notes given to—that I did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> until a <HI>fieri facias</HI> was out against me, and this at a time I had hopes very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> borrow as much as would pay the balance against me, in the partnership— should a settlement be made in prison, while under the present <HI>ca sa,</HI> it may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tinued until another take its place—this I mention because you act or scen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> act from the influence or persuasion of others rather than from your own se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ments, and I am not to suppose that those who urged so cruel a step as my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦finement, will be very willing, even if their interest was against it—to confes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> error. Let me now draw a few inferences from those facts, as well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> which perhaps you are not so well acquainted with, in order to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ter in the light in which it ought to be viewed. Upwards of £5700 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was placed to the credit of Allison and M'Knight in London, (they had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦sion for only £3300) every farthing of which has been paid or drawn for, favour of the attorneys of Francis Allison, excepting £1500 currency with for interest, and a few notes not totally paid to Hollingsworth— how it has be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> worked up to more than £1900 I know not. £1700 sterling of this mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> might have been drawn for and applied to the purchase of certificates, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had I done would certainly deserve censure—though it would have been succe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ful. Warder on a disputed balance of the account, offered me £110 sterlin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which I might have applied in the same way—but I assigned the partnership claim against him to Fisher and Hollingsworth—for I never considered that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> company had a right to account with Francis Allison for more than was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to its, credit for its own purposes. The £1300 currency paid since the dex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Captain Allison, might have been laid out in certificates also, and altho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was my opinion that money laid out in that way, would be the most adva<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ous—yet as I had none of my own to spare; I never applied any in that way— if I had, I would now be called a second Daniel. My wish was, in fall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to sell off the whole stock at public sale, and invest the proceeds in certifica<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 2s. 9d. to 3s. in the pound, as I knew some others were doing—because th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> goods business then, was in a languishing way, and it was dangerous to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> goods or procure good prices for them—but this Capt. Allison would not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦sent to—therefore it was not done, though I was advised to do it. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Pierce's notes were obtained, for the goods sold in 1783, to the Massach<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> line, I had them exchanged at the treasury of the United States, in two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> portions, thinking they should be divided in that manner, because of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> price they bore at the time, and that they must eventually be charged to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> partner at 20s. in the pound. My share I kept as long as I could, the other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> delivered you, without the least reluctance as you may remember. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in Northumberland, were divided in like manner, as by copy of a letter I re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to Mr. Caldwell appears, and which I suppose he informed you of. At the times I did apprehend that no loss would a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>crue—nor would there, if my advi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had been followed.

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aptain Allison's death, because of the pressing demands for money, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of funds to carry on an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> importation business on <HI>hopes</HI> only—for it canno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>posed that I would have consented to give up a retail trade, that was promi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, without the hope of a larger capital being put into the company, by Capt. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>son. My own was all in. I was rather averse to begin a foreign trade and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted out the inconvenience to him in his own house—but he thought he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> good store unoccupied and to my misfortune, I agreed to his views: for he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> several sums then due him, which I am sure he believed to be able to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hortly. The debt that will be found against me, will appear to arise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ally from losses in the partnership—not of my making: therefore I con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all the censure that I hear has passed upon me, as a robber of the widow and fatherless—to be entirely unfounded, and as I before mentioned, as long as I can view my conduct in that unbiassed light, I do—I am careless of and above censure. My views in a settlement on the other side of Schuylkill, are innocent and not at the cost of the heirs, as I have understood is said. My industry in prison, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> raised funds to get an abiding place for my family, should it be my hard lot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be longer continued in confinement—there my children will learn industry <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> get their bread in the most quiet and honourable way by agriculture: if I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> procure employment where I am, I will continue to exert all my abilities <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ir advantage—and when it shall please the guardians of the heirs of Capt. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to perfer <HI>their interest,</HI> to considerations foreign to it—I may be rendered in such situation, as to make full payment in a reasonable time—which perhaps may never be in my power, if a prison must be my portion many years longer. From the whole, I think this conclusion may be fairly drawn—that it is more for the interest of the heirs and all those concerned to accept my offer, by which something will be got, if not immediately in money, yet with a feasible pros∣pect of obtaining full satisfaction of every farthing that may be legally establish∣ed against me—whereas the contrary must produce temporary inconvenience to the heirs, and much loss to me, which no doubt will retard my exertions in their favour. Besides, if I was at liberty to look after business, it may be shortly in my power still, to find a friend to lend me what will be due to the heirs; which anticipation be assured would be most agreeable to, Sir, your most hum∣ble servant, Robert M'Knight.</Q>
Some days elapsed, before I had an inter∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th John Bleakley and John Caldwell, which interview I have reason to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve was with intention of finding out by my conversation, whether I would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e a bankrupt—and on my saying I certainly would not—John Cald∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> plum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d himself in the discovery and said, come away Bleakley—soon after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch they retired. I considered my case is such, as did not strictly come within <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> bankrupt act: for the debt due to Fisher and Hollingsworth, arose from trans∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons prior to its passing—and the debt due to Bleakley, was properly that of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lliam Allison as his attorney in fact. Besides it was rather straining of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to make me a trader under it: however it is done and I shall submit, though <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I money to spare to fee council, I could have contended and succeeded too. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he 16th of October, I sent my books and papers, with the deeds of my lands <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he bankrupt office, and on the 18th conformed before the commissioners in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, because the same harshness was continued, as had caused my confinement. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et I thought that having taken all my property—my person might have been libe∣rated, and the commissioners saved the trouble of calling upon me in prison. For this purpose I wrote to John Bleakley—but he informed John Lisle, Junior, he could not interest himself in my liberation, Hollingsworth and Fisher, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere the persons to whom application should be made: I then wrote to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Fisher who sent me a verbal message that he informed Clement Biddle
<PB N="16" REF="046494_0016_10217850E3A7E630"/>
the day before that if John Bleakley would send a note signifying his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sent, they would discharge me. I then wrote John B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>akley the follo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> note.
<Q>Sir, I have received a line from Mr. Lisle since I w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>te you this mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> informing me that you called on him and told him you could not interest y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> self in my liberation and that Fisher and Hollingsworth were the persons to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> application should be made. In consequence of which I have written to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Fisher, and he informed the bearer of my letter that if you would apply to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for a discharge, they would approve by signing it this night, how you w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in this business I know not, but if your profession<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the last letter I had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you is to be explained in a favourable manner, I think you have humanity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦nough to do all in your power to relieve my person, as you have taken all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> property from Robert M'Knight.</Q>
My son carried this and Bleakley told <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he could not do it, because it would make him liable to the heirs of Captain A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦son, and John Caldwell advised Bleakley not to do it. On the 19th October, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wrote to Miers Fisher in these words.
<Q>Sir, It is very disagreeable to me to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> troublesome to you, but as I have made application to Mr. Bleakley and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> averse to write to you on the subject I could wish to know if any other st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> necessary to be taken in order to release my person from confinement.

In April 1784, Charles Gillespie who had been con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he taking up land in Northumberland county with William Allison be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> war—came to town and applied to him to purchase the share obtained for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>overy and trouble. This was agreed to, as the payment was to be made in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to amount of £343, which were charged to William Allison. At this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>llespie shewn us a draft for 2037 acres which he said was a blind survey made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the war by a surveyor since dead—and he offered to take payment of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ery partly in dry goods—accordingly an agreement was made and the land <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. When conveyances were to be made, he sent down John Painter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and the following is an extract of the letter wrote to him on the subject <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>85.

The conveyances were accordingly made, patents obtained and I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ered to William Allison his four, reserving my own, which together amount <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>18 ½ acres of land. When John Painter got the blank conveyances, he told <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f a discovery he had of between 800 and 1000 acres, and offered it to me, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o in goods which I agreed for—at that time having by me a few depreciation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ficates which I received from John Snell in payment of a debt he owed me be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the partnership of Allison and M'Knight commenced. With these I paid the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se money—and I had the land patented, the quantity being 868 acres. In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ber 1784 Samuel Young called upon me and signified that himself, Doctor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Joseph North and Richard Renshaw were about sending out Benjamin Ste∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> into Kentuckey and each to have 10,000 acres surveyed. The expense to each <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to be only 300 dollars, one hundred of which was to be paid immediately for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> land warrants another by a draft from Kentuckey abo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the time the surveyors <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> going out and the remainder when the patents were delivered. I had sold <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> £400 worth of goods to James Watt, who was to have paid for them in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rch 1784, but he had run off to Kentuckey where I heard he was, and in hopes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etting some or all the money by Stevens, I engaged him to apply to Watt, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he obtain the money <HI>there</HI> I was to have recourse on the persons <HI>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re</HI> who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>yed him. I therefore agreed for taking up 10,000 acres for 300 dollars on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> terms with Young, &amp;c.—but did not get the patents for a considerable time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>wards. I however recovered part of the money which Stevens obtained from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t and have his bond—so that the whole can be secured that he received, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he said was 300 dollars. In April 1785, Isaac Sidman sailed and I was chosen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> assignee with John Shields, William Key, and others. Sidman had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> William Stuart to have 80,000 acres of land surveyed for him in Virginia, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>greement was—that Stuart was to have one third of the land he should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that it should be patented for him—clear of any expense.

<P>In July 1790 fearing that judgment would be confessed against me, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> brought by Hollingsworth and Fisher, and knowing that it would be di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to purchase goods for sale, as they might be levied on to the prejudice of tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who might be willing to sell to me on credit, I declined to go into any mercan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> transactions—for at this time few or no emoluments were obtained from my offic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as a justice of the peace—I applied to John Shields to purchase a place of a hundre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> acres on the other side of Schuylkill. We went out in his chair to see the land <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> there was no dwelling house on the premises such as I could expect my family <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> occupy—yet I thought that if I could exercise the duties of my office in the cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, I could erect a dwelling—for at that time I did not know that the place w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in Montgomery County, the deeds which I saw being expressed as in the count<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Philadelphia. The price was to be £300. About this time Captain Feariss ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> resolved to accept the award of referees in four actions he brought against Andre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Caldwell, and as I had assisted him in stating his claims, without the hope or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> reward save only a sum of money sufficient to pay my company debts, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> would have secured to him by a mortgage of my lands—and as the award fell <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦ry short of my expectations, I thought that he might advance so small a su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> would purchase this place. I asked him and he agreed—but when Mr. Shie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> put the papers into my hands to draw a deed from, I found that William Tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣bull had given power to sell—but not until January 1791, of course all that cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> be done was to draw an agreement, Feariss to purchase and John Shields <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> convey, for it never was my purpose to have the fee simple in me until I could pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> purchase money. This agreement was completed, and I expected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er me to cut down the wood and sell it in the winter, in ord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to pay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. But this he would not agree to, as John Shields told him he wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bring an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction of waste. However, Feariss continued to assert that he would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for the place when he got his money from Andrew Caldwell, which when he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ceived <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e excused himself from doing. This obliged Shields to bring an act<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> against Feariss, on the agreement—and as I understood that, should Feariss be— obliged to pay for the place, he would take the deed in his son's name, and tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> therefore my view in s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tting down my family there, would be defeated—I was no doubt very much discon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rted.

<P>That I have not been unsolicito<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of employment, during my confinement, will appear from a letter written by me to Judge Wilson on the 6th of February, 179<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the following words.
<Q>Sir, in a conversation with my friend Mr. J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Shields about a fortnight ago, I mentioned my desire of being employed in doing any writing, while I remain in this place, to enable me to support myself, a wife and four children—and more especially to prevent the necessity of my selling a property belonging to the firm of Allison and M'Knight, which will in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> years completely pay all our debts, as I think. Much undeserved censure, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> been passed upon me as I hear, which I am well able to refu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e by incontrover<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> facts. The partnership was unfortunate and entirely owing to the very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> deference which I paid to the opinion of Captain Allison—for had my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="21" REF="046494_0021_1021786242BF7208"/>
obtained, which was to sell off the stock at public rate, and invest the proceeds <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> certificates,—the latter end of 1784, when at 2s 9d to 3s in the pound—no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>jury but a very great advantage would have accrued. This opinion of mine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> operated to my disadvantage, because it is supposed that I carried it into act had on the supposition I am confined, as I have heard). So far from that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase—the very goods which I wanted sold in 1784 at vendue, were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>terwards in 1786 and 1787, with the consent of Captain Allison sold at pub∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, to raise money to pay off pressing demands. And since his death, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> obliged to sell the remainder in the same manner, and for the same pur∣pose, a great part of which was with the knowledge of his son. Since the death of Captain Allison, I have paid debts to the amount of £1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>00 and up∣wards, which if I had laid out in certificates, instead of paying the debts, would have now produced more than sufficient to pay off all claims against the part∣nership—for as to personal debts of my own £100 would extinguish them: and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se have mostly accured since my confinement. But if I had invested the £1300 in certificates, a much earlier application would have been made by the creditors and the estate of Captain Allison been sold when it would not produce half as much as it will now. Perhaps a greater misfortune could not have hap∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed me, than a partnership with him, as I can easily demonstrate. It was with a view of being able from the emoluments of the office of Justice of the peace, and to prevent my drawing out of the funds of the partnership, that I accepted that office—this was well known to Captain Allison—for he exerted himself very much to obtain it for me, which can be averred by the freeholders of Walnut ward. Mr. Bleakley the executor of Captain Allison, called on me sometime after his death, and asked me for Captain Allison's share of certain certificat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s for which some goods were sold in 1783—which I gave him without the least reluctance—they exceeded 3000 dollars. My own share I was under the disagreeable necessity to sell to Mr. Matthew M'Connell, to raise money to pay a judgment obtained by the Bank of North America against me, as in∣dorser of two notes for a friend, who sometime ago failed. When I was put here, I had not one certificate, nor have I any now, although I hear it has been confidently asserted that I have. When Docter M'Henry was in town, last summer, he interested himself in my behalf—but Mr. Bleakley would do noth∣ing without consulting Mr. Sargent, who advised (as the Doctor told me) to take an assignment before my liberation. This I cannot think of doing, because <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> believe time will enable me to pay every person, and have something left for myself and my children—but this I offered, that if I was liberated I would state the accounts of the partnership and submit them to auditors, and whatever sum might be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound due by me to the heirs of Captain Allison, I would assign my half share of the partnership property if they t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought fit, or give my bond payable by instalments and interest on each payment—this is refused, and noth∣ing short of an assignment in prison will satisfy. As I have it not in my power immediately, to raise money sufficient to pay off the claim for which I am con∣fined under a <HI>ca sa</HI>—I must remain here, as contented as I can, until some occur∣ence turns up to put it in my power to exonerate myself from debt. I men∣tioned to Doctor M'Henry, that if I could obtain any post under the govern∣ment, that I would allot two thirds of the income towards the extinguishment of my debt—but my being here precludes, my obtaining an employment to fur∣ther my wishes. I have however done a considerable quantity of writing, per∣haps to amount of 450 to 500 dollars, during my confinement, and could wish to do as much at would fill my whole time—which is the intention of my addressing you at this time—for yesterday Mr. Shields told me, he mentioned me to you,
<PB N="22" REF="046494_0022_102178655B7EA2A0"/>
and it was your desire that I should write to you on the occasion. I hope <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> will pardon this long letter—but it appeared necessary to me, to state my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on facts, in order to remove the undeserved censure cast upon, Sir, your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> humble servant Robert M'Knight.</Q>
To this letter I have received not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> answer than this—that Mr. Shields enquired if Mr. Wilson had any w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in readiness for me to be employed about, and that he understood there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> none ready. However, lately I have heard that Colonel Nichola under<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> that some person in a high public office would have employed me, if my ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ter had not been represented in so bad a light. This I attribute to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦lence of those uninformed implacable men, with whom I have had to do. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it will appear to every disinterested mind on a cool review of the foregoing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that so far from deserving censure as being the cause of loss to the heirs of Willi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Allison—that a more unfortunate circumstance could not have happened to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> than that of a connection in trade with such a man as him—one of reputed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wealth, who as I thought, could have brought into stock a large capital—wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> under the management of a man of some knowledge in trade—could be im<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦ed to mutual advantage. Instead of which, the reverse was the case—a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> capital with great designs. Some misfortunes, its true were sustained—b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> not having resolution to make the best of contingencies, has in effect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> loss to me of ten years, of the most precious part of my life—and a capita<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> £1500 at least—on which had I not joined him, I would most certainly have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦quired an handsome independance—being ever a man cautious of taking cred<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦somuch so, as to be found fault with by my particular friends. Had I been fin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in trade—and any misfortune happened, I might by a composition have m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> terms with my creditor: but by being the partner of a man of reputed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wealth—nothing but money would be taken as payment. And if my council <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> been adopted no loss at all could have happened; I would now be worth £20,00<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in certificates at least; the estate of William Allison would be proportionably a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦vantaged;—the partnership accounts would be closed, and I might have gone i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the brokerage or other business on my own account, which would no doubt ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> been beneficial to myself and my family—instead of which, I was tied down t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>exion I could not shake off—the unnecessary cruelty of my enemies would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be evidenced in a confinement of my person, upwards of twenty six months <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the loss of twenty five thousand acres of land; to my children, have happened▪</P>
<P>It will no doubt be objected, that I did not settle the partnership accounts on t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> demise of William Allison—that I did not apply the certificates to the payment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> partnership debts—and that I did not accept the offer of Doctor M'Henry—th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of taking the goods at the appraisement and his engagement to pay Francis All<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦son. To the two first I have already replied in this narrative—to the last I answ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> that £<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>00 was all that was offered for what stood us in £2700, that at the ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> I had a hope to raise more money in cash for them—that some had already be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> sent to vendue—and that the sums to be paid to Levi Hollingsworth I was co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦stantly dunned for—and had I not made payments from time to time as I did. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> suit would have been instituted and the property of the heirs as well in lands, &amp;c▪ as the certificates would have been sacrificed—and I thought less loss would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> occasioned by sale of the goods—though this has proved greatly to my disadvantag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></P>
<P>In order to shew truly the funds which William Allison had in the partnership <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it is sufficient to exhibit a statement of this account from the books, by which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> appears that at the commencement there was due to him.</P>

<P>Now as William Allison by an account delivered by him to John Bleakley on the 28th of May 1787, (only fourteen days before his death) did owe a balance of £2518 7 2 to Bleakley: it follows, that he had less stock in the partnership by
<PB N="24" REF="046494_0024_1021786A859E52F0"/>
upwards of £300 than this debt—and therefore he had no money of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> stock in the company—for credit is given to William Allison for every fart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> which the company received of Bleakley's money, which will appear by inspe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦on of the said account which shews the balance of £2518 7 2. To lessen his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the estate of David Caldwell, I was very willing to sell the goods to M'Hen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and happy for the company it would have been could that house have found <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for more of them—but money could not be raised with these—for very lit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> ever remitted from M'Henry, but as William Allison was indebted to C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> estate—those goods answered him as well as cash. Could they have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> here for money—it would be most certainly my advantage to have paid off <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to Francis Allison—but this could not be done in any other way than at public <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>That the estate of William Allison will be liable for the debts of the company a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> well as that to Bleakley will follow—because I am in capacitated to pay any p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> save what my lands may bring at public sale—the proceeds of which must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦vided in proportion among my personal creditors, as well as to the heirs aft<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> have paid off the debts of the partnership—which they can have no clai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦fore. Contrast this with my offer of mortgaging the lands in a way safe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> heirs and not (as I thought) unsafe or dishonourable to me—because, shou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> been helped by the interest of their friends to such office as I am able to fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> one I mean as would require constant application—not a sinecure (which I hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> reason to expect) it would give me pleasure to save from injury the heirs of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who has injured me, though I believe without the least design.</P>
<P>To shew the impracticability of stating precisely the just sum which the heirs <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> William Allison will have against me, it is only necessary to observe, that all deb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> due by the company must first be paid, that the partnership lands must be sold— that those of Sidman cannot be even known until decision of an amicable actio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> instituted or agreed to be instituted in the Supreme Court, between the assigne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> under the first assignment and those under the second—for the pleading to w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> several lawyers are retained. That a question of law may arise relative to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦nies received by me since the death of William Allison, for the creditors of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Wallace and Isaac Sidman, as to how far the heirs are concerned in those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦ions—and perhaps there may be others not now recollected by.</P>
