<HEAD>To the PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>SOME years ago there was in England a company of foot-pads and highway-men, connected to∣gether under certain laws and regulations, having a language (and books printed in that language) pe∣culiar to themselves, called the Flash Company,—a similar gang of plunderers has infested the United-States ever since the late war; and almost all the persons who have been hanged of late in North-America, have belonged to this company. Of this company are the two convicts <HI>Thomas Mount</HI> and <HI>James Williams,</HI> now lying in Newport gaol under sentence of death, for burglary. Both of these are noted villains, as well by legal evidence as their own confession; and were there no others, these were sufficient to contaminate all the unwary youth up∣on the continent, and to deprive the good people of these States of one of the highest blessings of heaven, that of sitting quietly under their vine and under their fig-tree and none to make them afraid. <HI>Wil∣liams,</HI> whether from artifice or an inferior degree of guilt, has not divulged the Flash proceedings near so fully as <HI>Mount,</HI> whose information, therefore, is the subject matter of the following sheets, and this is the cause why <HI>Williams'</HI> name occurs so seldom here. The discerning public will readily see my motives for handing these papers to them. From my constant attendance upon these convicts, perhaps my opportu∣nities <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, &amp;c. are equal i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not greater, than any oth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> person; and the public may depend upon their authenticity, having commit∣ted to writing their respective confessions and infor∣mations generally before one or more competent witnesses.</P>

<HEAD>The Voluntary Confession of Thomas Mount.</HEAD>
<P>I THOMAS MOUNT, now under sentence of death in the gaol of Newport, and to be executed agreeable to my sen∣tence, at Little-Rest, on the 27th of this month of May— in bodily health and sound mind, and full of sorrow and regret for my wicked life, in sincerity and truth make the following confession:</P>
<P>My parents, Samuel Mount and Mary Dobbs, lived in Mid∣dletown, in East-Jersey, where I was born some time, I believe, in 1764. My father, for the benefit of his family, removed to New-York when I was about four or five years old, where I and my brothers were put to school; they, viz. Adam and Joseph, now living in good repute in New-York, profited in their studies —I played truant, hated learning and every sort of good instruc∣tion. upon Sundays especially was fond of doing mischief such as robbing orchards, and spreading my wicked example among all the boys I could get acquainted with.—I began to despise my parents, and to count every thing they said to, or did for me, as beneath my regard; and having never learned to know my duty, either towards God, or towards man, or myself, I despised all religion; and at the age of 10 or 11, quitted my parents, who often told me I should one day come to an evil end, and went to sea on board one Capt. Hammond, bound for Antigua, thence to Statia, Navis, St. Kitts, Santacruiz, Sanctakes and Savannah. At Savannah I left him, and went on board the Florida brig bound for Jamaica; then I left him and went to live with one Mr. Kennedy in Kingstown, with him I lived about five or six weeks, then left him and got aboard of a sloop Capt. Alboy, and returned in her to New-York. In 1775, the war breaking out, I quitted my parents again, and li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted with Capt. Palmer, and went with him to Albany, thence to Fort George, thence to Ti∣conderoga, thence to Crown-Point, thence to St. John's, thence to Montreal, thence returned to Albany, and being sick was dis∣missed. As soon as I recovered, I lifted again, and went to Fort George, where I remained five weeks, and was dismissed on ac∣count of my youth, so I returned to live with my parents, at New-York. Not relishing the good rules and advice of my par∣ents,
<PB N="4" REF="046227_0004_1020FDEFA1CF4600"/>
again I left them and went to live with one John Mino<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, at Stonnington-point, with whom I remained six or seven months; when he was drafted to go with the militia—I proposed to go in his stead; accordingly went, and at Groton, near New-London, availing myself of the privileges of a militia man, I listed in the continental army under Col. Huntington, and accompanied him to Denbigh, when the British troops landed and burnt it.—At Valley-Ford, in Pennsylvania, I deserted the American, and went over to the British army, then lying in Philadelphia. In a few days after this, I and two companions broke into a soap-boilers' store (this is my first act of theft) and stole some soap. When the British troops left Philadelphia, I came along with them through the Jersies, to New-York, thence to Staten-Island, where I broke open a store in the night soon after our arrival, and took a large quantity of goods, and about twenty dollars in cash, and the night following I broke into the same store and took a larger quantity of goods than I had done the former night. Determin∣ed to desert for fear of a discovery, I and two of my companions confined the corporal that commanded the patrol, and so we es∣caped and went off to the American army, into the Jersies.— With my uncle Joseph Cox, at Embley's-Town, who married my father's sister, I remained some weeks; but soon wearied of this too quiet sort of life, I left my uncle and went to Philadelphia where I entered on board a schooner, Captain Strong, bound to Cape-Francois from whence I returned safe to Philadelphia; and in about four weeks after my return I entered again on board the same vessel, and then run off with the advanced pay, and entered on board the St. James, Capt. King, and cheated him of a month's advanced pay; next entered on board the Plow brig, Capt. Browster, with whom I went to sea, and in 24 hours were taken by the Cyble frigate, carried into New-York and put on board the Jersey prison-ship, from whence in about eleven or twelve days I escaped to New-York, where I entered on board the Macaroni privateer, and cheated the Captain of four or five guineas, the advance money. In a day or two after this I en∣tered on board a schooner, received the advance money and made off with it. Next I was apprehended by the British regiment (the fourth battalion of Jersey volunteers) to which I formerly belong∣ed; and was brought before a court-martial, but received no punishment on account of my youth. Under no restraint, and already hardened by the escapes I had made, I determined to double my diligence, if possible to arrive at the head of my pro∣fession; accordingly, next stole a watch from one Mr. Kelly;
<PB N="5" REF="046227_0005_1020FDF4B0BE1E70"/>
next broke open a store belonging to Mr. Kiz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k; next stole nother watch; next stole a gilt-case watch; next <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> watch, next stole a large bag full of English boot and bend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> next in company with one William F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>negin, in the evening, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shop door standing open, stole a piece of corduroy about thirty yards; in Queen-Street, a few days afterwards, I went into a shop in the day time, and stole a paper of worsted stockings; and a few days after, out of a shop in Hanover-Square, I stole a piece of linen about twenty-five yards; about a week or so, after this, I stole another piece in Broad-Way; next, in the night time, I and one John Delevan knocked down a sailor and took his money —I knocked him down, but Delevan took the money and run off with it from me. The regiment now removing to Newtown, on Long-Island, I went with them, and in a few days after our ar∣rival, I and one Henry Milton stole two horses and rode off with them to Brookland, and then let them go; next day after we came to Brookland, we were apprehended and carried back to the regiment and tried for desertion: Henry Milton was acquitted, and I sentenced to receive 500 lashes; but the day before my punishment commenced, I broke out of the guard-house, and es∣caped to the east end of the island, but there was taken up by Colonel Thomson's light horse, and carried to Huntington, thence under guard to Jerico, there committed to the care of one of the Yougers to carry me to the regiment.—The Youger's pocket I picked, as he sat by me in the waggon, and threw all his papers down on the road within five or six miles of Jamaica; some time after we came out of the carriage at Jamaica, I told him that I saw the driver pick his pockets and take all his papers and throw them down on the highway, about five or six miles from hence. Seeing the waggon at some considerable distance, the Youger, desiring me to follow him, pursued after the wag∣goner, that instant I took a contrary direction and so escaped. I went down as far as South-Hole and then got over in a trading boat to the main, and travelled towards New-Haven, there one day went into a shop and stole out of a drawer a small quantity of cash; next day, out of another store, I stole from the cash-box five or six crowns and dollars with two French guines; same day in the afternoon I went into another shop and stole about ten pounds in silver and one English guinea. Leaving this place, I set off for Philadelphia, where I listed into Col. Myland's light-horse, he fourth regiment of dragoons: soon after this peace took place, I quitted the army entirely. Immediately after my leaving the army, I broke open
<PB N="6" REF="046227_0006_1020FDF63A9AA3C8"/>
a continental store, and stole two pair of boots, and a parcel of shirts; a few days after I stole a piece of calico, thirty yards, in company with James Dawson; some little time after this, I stole from a kitchen door a silver tankard belonging to Mr. Penrose,— it was instantly missed; Dawson had cut it up, but one of the Captains of the garrison intercepted it, and Dawson and I were taken up and tried for the theft; he got 25 lashes, and I 100 lashes for the theft, and 25 for giving the court saucy answers. No sooner was this account settled, but I proceeded in my old way, and stole three large silver spoons from Mr. Joseph Carson, in Water-Street; next day or so, in the evening, I went into an apothecary's shop and took his cash-box, containing about ten pounds; a week after this I went into a shop in—street, and took another piece of calico; some days after I was taken up for a debt I owed to Mr. Carson and put in gaol; whilst in gaol, the woman to whom I and Dawson had sold the calico, which I stole from Mr. Pool, was apprehended, having on a gown of it, in∣formed that she had bought it of me, accordingly I was tried for the theft and received 21 lashes, and sentenced to imprisonment for court charges of fine and restitution money; the very second day after I broke gaol and escaped, I picked the pocket of one Hag∣gaty or about three or four dollars and two depreciation notes of about sixty pounds each; leaving Philadelphia, I went to Bur∣lington, and there passed the notes; thence went to New York, and lived with my brother Adam about one or two months at the baking business; here I got acquainted with John Lipton, and we broke open a hen-roost and stole a parcel of fowls; next day leaving New-York, we went upon Long-Island, thence to Ostend, and so on to New-London; upon the road Lipton stole a watch, but the owner missing it, pursued us, and we in a very cowardly manner give it up to him. We journeyed to Sagg-Harbor, thence crossed over to New-London, and from thence to Boston; there the first day of our arrival we stole a few articles, such as shoes, and other wearables; but finding Boston no proper place for us then, on account of the alarms about stolen goods before our arrival, we set out to go back to New-York. —Having travelled about twelve or fourteen miles from Boston, in the night we broke open a store that stood upon the road, and took some cash and twenty five pair of women's shoes, a large quantity of nutmeg and a gun; and travelling along with our booty, we came up to a waggon with a trunk of goods tied on it, standing at a tavern door, we broke open the trunk and taking out of it a large quantity of chintz, laces, silk and cotton hankerchiefs, we left in their stead the shoes and gun;
<PB N="7" REF="046227_0007_1020FDF951A476D8"/>
our next step was to secure our flight, by taking two horses out of the stable at the same place, and rode the remainder of the night, and in the morning turned them off, whilst we retired to the woods during the day; and when night came on we pursued our journey toward Worcester; but hearing a waggon behind us, we went out of the road a little till it should go past us, we fixed our eye upon it, and saw one man only in it and he seemed to be asleep; the waggon soon stopt, we suppose at the onwers' house, straitway we made up to it, robbed the sleeping man of all he had, about four or five dollars, and left him sound asleep to pursue our journey, selling our goods after the best manner we could, pretending to be speculating sailors, till we arrived at New-York. Soon after our arrival at New-York, we listed with the troops destined for the Ohio expedition; the second or third night after our enlistment, we broke open a dwelling-house belonging to Mr. Hyde, where Lipton formerly lived, and took a silver watch, a guinea, some small money, and a silver stock buckle; a few nights after being informed by one Millar, whose right name was Copy Gelly, that there was money in a house close by Mr. Lither's ship-yard, Millar, Lipton and I broke into this house, took a watch, and a pair of silver buckles, but were discovered just as we were ready to seize upon the mo∣ney, yet we escaped. Having now received the bounty and our clothes, we deserted from the regiment, and we three, viz. Lipton, Millar and I, went out about five or six miles from New-York, and there Millar went down a chimney and stole a watch, and handed it to me through a window. Our next route was to∣wards New-Haven, and within about four or five miles of New-Haven, we broke into a dwelling-house where a physician lived, at the sign of the ball, here we took some money and departed; thence to Hartford, here we listed with the troops going against the Indians with Capt. Hart; we received the bounty-money, and in two or three days deserted. Lipton chose to re∣main a little while at Hartford; Millar and I set off for Boston. Within about four or five miles of Providence we broke into a dwelling-house and stole some silver spoons, then strait to Provi∣dence; and the very same night broke into a dwelling-house near Mr. Sterry's house and took a large silver spoon and a quantity of clothes; and next day leaving Providence, set out for Boston: here we went to board with Mrs. Ritch, and when ready to leave her, we stole from her a pattern of a silk and cotton jacket, and set off for Dedham, where we broke open the dwelling-house of Mr. Newall, and stole a large quantity dry goods, for which we were apprehended and tried, and being found guilty, received 30

lashes, I was put upon the gallows one hour with a rope round my neck, and sent to Castle-William for three years. After about eighteen months confinement, in a foggy day I escaped from thence by swimming three miles, and just as I was approaching the wharves a boat took me up, with an intention of delivering me up to the Castle, from whence they supposed I had escaped; a little after we were on shore, and being favoured by the dark∣ness of the night, I run off from them. Next day I arrived at Providence, and got into employ with one Capt. De Wolf, late from Guinea; soon left him, and set out for Norwich Landing, where I fell in with an old companion, Archibald Taylor (since executed in Boston) and nex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> day setting out for Boston, upon the road we robbed a woman of a gold earlock and a silk handker∣chief, and used her very ill besides; a few miles further on the road, I stole a gold ring and a tortoise shell silver mounted fan, in Plainfield; here we changed our minds, and returned to Nor∣wich Landing, where I stole a surtout; the first night after our return we broke into a store belonging to Mr. Devitt, and took about seventy or eighty pounds worth of dry goods; took the goods along and set off for New-London, and within two or three miles of that place; hid the greatest part of them in Mr. Parson's barn among hay: at New-London we were both apprehended on suspicion, I having the art of representing myself innocent got clear, but my companion was confined in gaol. Being set at lib∣erty, I went to Mr. Parson's house, where I staid two or three days, and set off one evening towards New-York with a part of the goods, which I disposed of by the way. As soon as my mo∣ney was spent, in New-York, I left that place and set off to go back to Mr. Parson's for the rest of the goods; at Milford I got a companion to go with me, one John Delavan, we found the goods just as I had left them, and set out with them to New-Ha∣ven, where we tarried a few days; in the mean time Dela∣van received from me a part of the goods for his trouble; and making free to steal more of them made off with them to his house at Milford. In a day or two after De∣lavan left me, having sold the rest of the goods to different people, I and one Harry M'Cormic hired a boat to carry us to Milford; we run her ashore among the rocks, and before morn∣ing she stove all to pieces; from hence walking to Milford, I called upon Delavan, made him deliver up to me such goods as he had not sold. Leaving Milford, M'Cormic and I sat out for New-York, where in two or three days we fell in with another of our companions, George Gardiner (from Greenock, a famous key-maker.) Just before leaving New-York, where M'Cormic
<PB N="9" REF="046227_0009_1020FDFED1A6A958"/>
stayed behind, I called on my brother Adam and received about four dollars from him; prepared for our journey, we then set out for Philadelphia, where next day after our arrival, Gardiner and I opened a barber's shop in Water-street, with a false key, and stole razors, tooth drawers, &amp;c. next day I stole some paper money; some days after fell in with John Lipton and Daniel Kalaghan; by agreement we four set out for Baltimore, upon our way through Charleston, there, with a false key, opened a store, and took about twenty pounds worth of goods; we carried them as far as Susquehanna ferry and there hid them, and pur∣sued our journey. At Bushtown we attempted to break open a store, but were discovered, yet we escaped. Arrived in Baltimore, we fell in with our old friend Holmes, and on the third day after Holmes and I went to fetch the goods we had hid at Sus∣quehanna ferry; we found them as I left them, and returned, selling them by the way. In Baltimore I stole a watch and a surtout out of a house; a few nights after we broke open a house and stole a large quantity of clothing and a piece of broadcloath. Gardiner and Kalaghan chose to remain in Baltimore, whilst I and Lipton should set off for Annapolis and sell the goods we had upon hand: At Annapolis Lipton was apprehended for breaking open the store in Baltimore and imprisoned. Before I left Annapolis, to mend my luck, I stole some black ribbon and a few more trifles. Again Kalaghan joined me, and another companion (I cannot remember his name.) We three set out for Alexandria, where I fell in with James Brown; he and I one day stole some silk handkerchiefs and a beaver hat; next day Gardiner and Stewart joined us; they had fled from Alexandria, where they broke into a shop and had taken a large quantity of goods, and hid them; next day they went for the goods they had hid, and we all four in company set out for Dumfries, where I and Stewart were apprehended and all the false keys found with us. Gardiner and Brown escaped, Stewart and I were thrown into Dumfries gaol, and thence carried to Alexan∣dria. We were tried, and nothing found against us, neverthe∣less we were all sentenced to lie in gaol a year and a day, or get some one to be surety for our good behaviour. In the second week of our imprisonment we broke gaol: At Wilmington, on our way to Philadelphia, we broke into a dwelling-house and stole a great many things, next day were apprehended and sent to Newcastle gaol, from whence in two or three weeks, we escaped. Arrived at Philadelphia, I left Stewart and took another com∣ponion, one Griffin, passed some counterfeit New-York money, stole some handkerchiefs, a beaver hat, a surtout, and two shawls, from different shops; next, in company with Griffin and one
<PB N="10" REF="046227_0010_1020FE016B3FA7C0"/>
Fogg, in the night time, broke into a store and took cheese, sugar, coffee, and several other grocery goods. Fogg was ap∣prehended, Griffin and I escaped, and quickly leaving Philadel∣phia, we set off for New-York: On our way, at Perthamboy, we stole some black silk handkerchiefs. Arrived at New-York, Griffin, John Taylor and I broke into a store belonging to Mr. Ford, and took a large quantity of shoes, tea, cherry-rum, &amp;c. next day, for this transaction, we were all apprehended and tried; I got clear, my companions were branded, getting the benefit of clergy, and so were dismissed. Then Ford swore his life against me, and got me shut up in prison about eight or nine months: I got out upon condition of quitting the place in twelve hours, and returned to Philadelphia, where, next day after my arrival, I stole a piece of chintz and a piece of calico, from a store in Market Street; a few nights after I and David Griffin, and one Logan, a tailor, in Irishtown, broke open a dwelling-house in Walnut-Street, and stole a large quan∣tity of dry goods; next day I and Griffin were apprehended, the goods were found where we had hidden them in a church then building; I and Griffin were committed to gaol; next day after our imprisonment, a man appeared who swore high-way robbery against me, which I was innocent of. After being confined about eight weeks I broke out, and in company with George Williams and Daniel Kalaghan set off to pass through the Jersies; upon our way stole some money, about two dollars, from a man into whose house we had gone to rest our∣selves; and in Allentown we attempted to break open a store, but did not succeed; thence to Middletown, crossed over to Long-Island; thence to Huntington; thence to Norwalk, where we three broke open a schooner and stole some clothes; on the same night broke open a store belonging to Squire Lockhart in Norwalk, from whence we took about seventy or eighty pounds in goods and some silver buckles, and about two pounds in cash; next day we were apprehended and tried, first for robbing the schooner; I and Kalaghan were found guilty and received 10 lashes a piece, Williams got clear; and then we were all three com∣mitted to Fairfield gaol, and tried for breaking open the store. I took all the blame upon myself and cleared the other two, and received the punishment, 35 lashes and five years imprisonment. Eight or nine days after my whipping broke out of gaol, and I, Kalaghan, Kennedy and Williams set off for Norwich Landing, with an intention of breaking open a store, but did not succeed. Upon the way we stole some shirts and trowsers, and then we parted, Kalaghan and Kennedy took the road for Providence,
<PB N="11" REF="046227_0011_1020FE0311181940"/>
Williams and I to Norwich Landing; and at a dance in Nor∣wich Landing I took a silk cloak from a young lady, and sold it about two or three miles from Pockatanock bridge, and then set off for Providence; here I stayed and wrought a week or two with Mr. Brown, under the name of Charles Minor; then leav∣ing Providence I set off for Boston, where I fell in company with James Williams, for the first time of our connection. I stole some buckles, and then, in company with Williams, set out for Newbury-Port, there I broke open a schooner, and took out of her some clothes, chocolate, and tobacco, and a bottle of rum; Williams stood upon the wharf and helped to take the things, we then set off for Portsmouth, and on the way I stole an axe and sold it for a pair of shoes. At Portsmouth I left Williams, and returned to Newbury-Port, there I fell in company with one Mr. Farrington, a gentleman thief: Next night we two broke open a dwelling-house, and took some silk gowns and womens ap∣parel out of it; there I got apprehended on account of robbing a brig in Portsmouth, having part of the goods with me that were taken out of her by Williams, I was confined two or three days in gaol and then liberated. Leaving Newbury-Port I set off for Boston alone, where I broke open a schooner and took a parcel of clothes out of her; from thence returned to Providence, where I fell in company with John Hickcock. Leaving Provi∣dence in a few days, we two set off for Norwich Landing, there we attempted to break open a store, and while I was lifting up Hickcock in at the window, the gentleman of the house alarmed us and we escaped: From thence we went to New-London, where we broke open a store and took some money, twenty or thirty shillings, and some cotton and silk handkerchiefs, &amp;c. and then set off for Newport and sold some of the goods in Newport; here Hickcock and Weathers broke open a store belonging to Mr. John Hadwen; for this I was apprehended and committed to gaol for two or three days, then was cleared, and set off for Hartford, upon the way I attempted to break open a house in Stonington, but being discovered I fled out of town to Hartford, thence returned towards Providence, upon the way broke open a dwelling-house in Connecticut, and stole some silver and pew∣ter spoons, a hat and a tankard Carrying the goods with me I arrived at Providence and sold them; here I worked with Mr. Brown a week or two under the name of Charles Minor; then I stole a pair of shoes out of Mr. Roger's store where I had gone to receive my pay; next I went to Nancy Smith and told her I was a fortune-teller, and repeating several things that I had heard of her, she thought I was really a fortune-teller; then I
<PB N="12" REF="046227_0012_1020FE0648E53CA8"/>
proposed to marry her, and she approved of my offer; then I said I wanted to tell Miss Sally Brown's fortune, but could not in her father's house lest it should offend him, and asked whether it would be agreeable to bring down Sally Brown to her room; but this I could not do unless I was disguised; accordingly I desired her to give me some clothes for the purpose; she gave me a cloak and a surtout, but my plan was to run off with them. All this while I was aboard the Washington, Capt. Donalson, and Mr. Nightengale, as he thought he knew me aboard the Alliance frigate, but was not the purser, trusted me with money in advance. Leaving Providence with the advance money, I set off for Boston, there I took some sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s; from thence I went to Newbury-Port, where I fell in company with a young sailor going to visit his friends, carrying some handkerchiefs and shawls, we walked together about 14 or 15 miles, and at night we put up at Mr. Lovet's tavern betwixt Newbury-Port and Portsmouth; in the night I got up and robbed him of all he had, I took a∣bout four or five dollars in cash, a piece of calico, and two or three shawls, a pair of new stocklngs, a pair of new shoes, a pair of new buckles, a pair of new trowsers, a new shirt, and a beaver hat, a cotton and silk jacket, and a silk striped jacket, a pot of sweet pomatum, two books and two letters, and a parcel of oranges; from thence I went to Boston by the way of Exeter; arrived in Boston, I fell in company with Robert Tresson and Thomas Sheridan, where I took one or two shawls, and set out from Boston to go to Connecticut, about ten miles from Pom∣fret, Tresson and I attempted to rob a house, but were disap∣pointed; then on we went to Pomfret, where we all three were concerned in robbing a waggon, and took two pieces of home∣made bearskin, and on the same night broke open a blacksmith's shop, and got some tools wherewith to break open a store belong∣ing to Lemming Grosvernor, took about 110 pounds worth in goods, and about two or three dollars in cash, then set off to Norwich Landing; about two miles from Norwich Landing, one Mountseer lives, who is known to this sort of business, there we got apprehended, and sent to Windham gaol; Sherridan turned evidence against us, and we were tried and found guilty, and I received 40 lashes and to be imprisoned six months, Tresson 30, and to be imprisoned three months: Within the first two months of our imprisonment, Robert Tresson, William Stanton, Gershom Palmer and I, being all in one apartment, broke gaol. Tressan, Stanton and I went to Voluntown, there Stanton left us and Tresson and I went to Boston, where I stole two patterns of silk jackets. Here meeting with William English, one of our com∣pany,
<PB N="13" REF="046227_0013_1020FE0A423984E0"/>
we three set off for Portsmouth; there we attempted to rob a store, but a fire breaking out in the town at that instant, prevented us; hearing the fire called we ran to where the fire was, there Tresson stole a jacket from Oliver Whipple, Esq. in the pockets thereof were a forty pound note of hand, a penknife and a comb; next day we three were apprehended on suspicion of setting the house on fire, but were acquitted; then I set off alone to Kennebunk, in Massachusetts, eastward of Portsmouth, and there broke open a store belonging to Messrs. Condy and Clark, and stole a large quantity of dry goods and escaped about 70 miles, and then was apprehended, in consequence of an adver∣tisement, and committed to Old-York gaol, from whence after three weeks I broke out and set off for Portsmouth. The next night after my arrival at Portsmouth, I broke open the house of Mr. Chadwick, the gaoler, and stole some money and a quantity of mens and womens clothes, and gave Tresson (whom I found here in prison) part of the money and two saws, and then set off towards Newbury-Port: Next morning Tresson called the gaol∣keeper and told him that it was I that robbed him, and had given him two saws and a dollar in money, wherewith to effect his escape; then the gaoler sent a pursuer after me, who appre∣hended and carried me back to Portsmouth gaol, from thence I was carried to Exeter for my trial; upon Tresson's evidence I was found guilty, but received no punishment by reason that I promised to inform of all those persons who received stolen goods, and how the house was set on fire; and therefore the court ad∣journed one month, and I carried back to Portsmouth gaol; but before the month was expired I broke gaol and set off for Boston, and fell in company with Joseph Kelly who had two coats and jackets he had stolen to bear our expences to Newport. We set off for Newport, and immediately upon our arrival, Kelly stole a pair of silver buckles from Mr.—a Jew, and I stole three or four black silk handkerchiefs from Mr. Wickham; next I and Kelly broke open a cooper's shop to get tools to break into Mr. Wickham's store, but daylight coming on we could not complete our business. No body pointed out the store to us I had been in it the day before. Then leaving Newport, Kelly and I went to Mansfield, and there we parted; there I broke open a store belonging to Mr. Gilbert, and took a quantity of goods, to the value of about twenty pounds, and with these goods set off to Voluntown to one Mr. Stedman's a receiver of stolen goods; there I again met with Kelly, and getting some money of Stedman for some of the goods, I returned to Provi∣dence, where I got playing cards with a countryman, cheated
<PB N="14" REF="046227_0014_1020FE0CE4468F60"/>
him of some money and two dressed sheepskins; there Kelly re∣commended me to one Lewis who supplied us with tools, and then Kelly and I set out to break Mr. Roger's store, and had almost completed our business; but being alarmed by two or three men, made our escape, and took a couple of horses and rode almost to Voluntown, and then turned them off. At Voluntown we stayed one day, and the next sell in company with James Williams, who told me he was going to Providence to get on board Mr. Brown's Indiaman: I asked him to go with me the way of Ston∣ington, and he consented; so Williams, Kelly and I set off to William Stanton's (we turned Kelly off telling him that two might keep a secret, but three could not) then Williams, Stanton and I set off for Hopkinton with an intention to break a store, but did not succeed; but Williams and Stanton took a dozen pair of stockings off a fence.—Upon our return to Stanton's, I held the horses at the bridge, Williams and Stanton broke open a mill, and took all the meal and corn they could find, and we carried it to Stanton's house: Stanton next day sent some of the corn to Rowse Babcock's for rum. Next night Stanton, Williams and I set off to break into Joseph Potter's store; I broke open a mill and took a crow-bar out of it, and went to the door and broke it, and we all three went in, I first, and they following. Being most forward in this business, I lighted a candle and handed down the goods, about seven hundred dollars worth, and some money, two or three dollars, and carried them to Stanton's house, where we divided them into three parts and cast lots. Williams and I took our shares; after giving Stanton out of my share eight or nine pounds worth of goods for a mare, and hiding the goods under two corn stacks and under a barn, about five miles from Stanton's house, we set off for Voluntown, there were appre∣hended, and brought back to Hopkinton, where Stanton, I and my wife were tried for breaking open the miil; Stanton's wife and Williams were admitted as State's evidence: accordingly I was sentenced to receive 20 lashes and my wife 10 (though she was innocent).—I paid the fine by giving up part of my clothes, then committed to Newport gaol, and tried for breaking Potter's shop, found guilty, and received the sentence of death—And the Lord have mercy upon me.</P>
<P><HI>To the above Confession I here add my last Speech and Dying Words:</HI></P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="speech">
<PB N="15" REF="046227_0015_1020FE0FF38A4660"/>
<HEAD>The <HI>LAST SPEECH</HI> and <HI>DYING WORDS</HI> of <HI>THOMAS MOUNT,</HI> published at his own Desire, for the public Good in general, and for that of his Comrades in particular.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN I see that every attempt to break gaol is unsuccessful and every effort to prevent my suffering an ignominious death, is like to be fruitless, I Thomas Mount, in conformity to the custom of publishing a last speech or dying words, for the benefit of my survivors, do hereby declare this to be my <HI>last speech and dying words.</HI></P>
<P>And first—I pray that the Lord may have mercy upon me, and that all good people may pity and pray for me; and that my shameful end may deter others from those actions which have brought me to this dreadful hour.</P>
<P>Secondly—I desire to be truly penitent for my crimes, both against the law of GOD and the laws of MEN; and to believe that Divine goodness hath thus arrested me in my career of wickedness, for his glory and my everlasting good. I desire to be more re∣signed to my sentence than I fear I am. So great has been my propensity to stealing, even from my childhood, that were my days prolonged, 'tis more than probable I should get into my old way again. I am horribly afraid to die; and yet confess I deserve not to live: but am certain, that the mercy of government in par∣doning thieves, is no mercy at all to them, for every pardon they get hardens them so much the more in their villainy. The only way to reclaim <HI>one</HI> thief, is either to banish or hang all the <HI>other thieves</HI> and all the <HI>receivers</HI> of stolen goods; for so long as there are <HI>receivers</HI> and <HI>thieves</HI> living and at liberty, however penitent <HI>one thief</HI> may be the hour he receives his pardon and freedom yet whenever he gets abroad among his old acquaintances, they will wish him joy of his escape from the gallows; they will get drunk with him; they will carry him to the places of rendezvous, where the women and liquors are all in common, and with rela∣ting their wonderful escapes from justice, with the stimulating songs of his comrades, with the artful behaviour of the scandals of their sex, he becomes ten-fold more a child of the devil than he was before.</P>
<P>Thirdly—Nothing corrupts young fellows more, than idleness and bad women, who are first the seducers to all evil, and if their extravagancies are not gratified to the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, become our betrayers: and therefore, as a dying man, would intreat all young men to get married and settled at some honest oalling as soon as possible</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="046227_0016_1020FE13891EFDD0"/>Fourthly—At my desire, the language and songs of the Ameri∣can flash company are published, to inform the world at large how wicked that company is, and how necessary it is to root them up like so many thorns and briers which if suffered to remain would destroy the rising crop of young fellows throughout the Continent. The whole of the secrets concerning this business, the names of the persons concerned in carrying it on, whether as thieves or receivers, or setters on, or suppliers with tools where∣with to break out of gaols, or into houses, to a good friend of mine when under sentence of death, I have communicated; at the same time taking his promise that he will transmit the same to the Governors of the United States of America immediately after my decease, that they may be of general utility to this country.</P>
<P>Fifthly—I have communicated likewise to this gentleman, the various ways of discovering thieves and house-breakers, so that in future it will be next to impossible to practise the thieving bu∣siness without detection: And as all thieves are great cowards (for the bark of a dog will make them run) I will advise every honest man who wishes to preserve his property, to remenber the rules I have communicated, and to act upon them; if he does, there is no great chance of being robbed, or having his house broke. Likewise I would submit it to the judgment of our rulers, whether it would not be proper to fine every man who was rob∣bed on the high-way, provided only two thieves attacked him, because he did not defend himself; for the heroism of <HI>one</HI> honest man is, or ought to be, sufficient to make <HI>two</HI> thieves run.</P>
<P>Sixthly—As a dying man, a debtor to my country, and desir∣ous of making all the compensation in my power, I further make known how any man of the least common sense may discover a thief,—by his often looking back—turning quick up lanes— standing to gaze at signs—and stopping to enquire for the houses of persons who do not live in the place—going into shops and giving the merchant a deal of unnecessary trouble in calling for a sight of one thing and another, and of twenty more, without buying one article. If a thief appears in the day time, you ne∣ver see him without his rogue's face on; look at him pretty sharply, and you will see how suspicious and timorous he looks; take him by the hand, it feels soft, and your touch makes him shrink, you may perceive his hand nervous; but in nothing is this nervousness more perceptible than, if he takes a pen at your desire, to write with—it will therefore be to ask all suspected persons to write, and their hand will instantly tell upon their heart.</P>
<P>Seventhly—I must complain to the public of the receivers, or fences, as we call them in the flash language,—they are our set∣ters
<PB N="17" REF="046227_0017_1020FE15A2CABD00"/>
on, and they cheat us confoundedly; we seldom receive from them more than a tenth part of the value, and must take it in what pay they please, and when they please; and by getting us drunk with our whores, every now and then, they generally steal from us all they can possibly come at, and then set us a fighting with one another about the goods they had taken. These receivers being in league with our whores, make them very extravagant in their demands upon us, who, after treating them with the best of our spoils, if we do not promise quickly to get them more, threat∣en to inform against us.—In one word, a thief or highway-man is a pitiable animal; he risks his life every adventure he engages in, and all the recompence he gets for his pains, is the treachery of his whores and comrades, and last of all an ignominious death. Though at any time we take a large quantity of goods, we can∣not sell them to any account; and after giving hush-money to some, paying a comrade for his help (for we hire one another on such like expeditions, as breaking a shop or house, or way-laying the stage-coach, &amp;c.) and gratifying our pretended friends with presents, we have seldom or never enough to buy decent cloaths, wherein to assume the character and appearance of honest men and quit bad company, had we ever so much mind for it.</P>
<P>Eighth—When I look back upon a company of thieves, with their whores, met after some house or shop breaking match, full of plunder, and recollect the scenes of cursing, singing, dancing, swearing, roaring, lewdness, drunkenness, and every possible sort of brutish behaviour, I detest myself for having so often been one in such companies.—Under these circumstances we are very liable to be apprehended: and therefore, good people and bad people, thieves and honest men, take warning by my fate, and mind my advice; for if ye get into the way of thieving, nothing can cure you but the gallows —I never heard of a thief that was re∣claimed but one, and that under such circumstances as can never be the lot of any other thief to the end of the world.</P>
<P>Pray for me good people—I am wicked, and there are many others in the United States perhaps as wicked as myself; I pray they may depart from their wickedness, before their cup of ini∣quity becomes full, and they entail upon themselves the death I am going to suffer. It is but justice that such as have lived like wolves and beasts of prey, should die like dogs, and not like men.</P>
<P>And the Lord have mercy upon me—farewel.</P>

<HEAD>One day, in a frame of mind more devout than ordinary, I composed the following <HI>LAMENTATION,</HI> which I desire may be published ex∣actly as I have dictated it, as a conclusion to my last speech and dying words.</HEAD>
<L>ALL ye good people who are assembled here this day,</L>
<L>Let my shameful end a warning be to you I pray,</L>
<L>Behold a dying victim who for his sins doth pardon crave,</L>
<L>Who once liv'd in good credit among his friends both fine &amp; brave.</L>
<L>THOMAS MOUNT is my name,</L>
<L>And to my shame cannot deny</L>
<L>In New-Jersey I was born,</L>
<L>And on Little-Rest now must die.</L>
<L>Of robbing I own that I guilty be,</L>
<L>O may my dear redeemer from further torments set me free,</L>
<L>Through all this country 'tis well they know my name;</L>
<L>From Boston to New-York 'tis well they know my fame;</L>
<L>From New-York to Philadelphia, from thence unto Charlestown,</L>
<L>So basely I've behaved in roving up and down;</L>
<L>From Charlestown to Baltimore, I quickly have set out,</L>
<L>For robbing of a merchant I was oblig'd to scout;</L>
<L>For robbing of another man I closely was pursu'd,</L>
<L>And my faithful comrade Lipton was taken on the road;</L>
<L>From thence to Newport gaol, which is the truth of my song,</L>
<L>So here I lie dismal bound down in irons strong.</L>
<L>Come all ye young men a warning take by me,</L>
<L>Love your wives, and mind your work, and shun bad company;</L>
<L>Quit gaming, and fine whores,</L>
<L>Pay off your tavern scores,</L>
<L>For they'll be flaring at your daring,</L>
<L>When you can spend no more.</L>
<L>My wife pities my misfortune, alas! both night and day;</L>
<L>My comrades take good council and go no more astray:</L>
<L>I tried hard myself for to clear,</L>
<L>My relations will shed many a tear,</L>
<L>My wife she cries and tears her hair,</L>
<L>Oh! go I must, and the Lord knows where.</L>
<L>I hope my soul to heaven may flee,</L>
<L>And there remain to eternity:</L>
<L>Hoping that Christ will receive my soul.</L>
<L>And pardon my sins which are many fold.</L>
<L>Now on my dying day,</L>
<L>Pray for me all ye standers by,</L>

<HEAD>The <HI>OATH</HI> at the Admission of a <HI>Flat</HI> into the <HI>Flash Society.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE oldest Flash cove takes the <HI>Flat</HI> by the hand, asks him if he desires to join the Flash Company. The <HI>Flat</HI> answers, yes. The Flash cove (head man) bids him say thus:—I swear by— that to the Flash Company I will be true—never divulge their secrets, nor turn evidence against any of them—and if a brother is in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tress, that I will hasten to relieve him at the risk of my life and liberty—and if he suffers, endeavor to be revenged on the person or persons who were the means of bringing him to pun∣ishment.—After taking the above, or a similar oath, the <HI>Flat</HI> receives a <HI>pall,</HI> i. e. a companion, and they two are sent out up∣on some expedition.</P>
<P>N. B. By the confession of <HI>Mount</HI> and <HI>Williams,</HI> it appears the Flash Company have spread themselves all over the continent, from Nova-Scotia to the remotest parts of Georgia—that the principal seaport towns are their places of general rendezvous— and that the number of the society a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> present, are from about 70 to 80 males and females. They have receivers in the princi∣pal towns of each State, who not only receive the stolen goods, but point out shops and houses for them to break into and plunder.</P>
<P>☞<HI>Sometimes they swear by</HI> GOD, <HI>and sometimes by the</HI> Devil: <HI>when they use the name of</HI> GOD, <HI>they swear by the Ola <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> knows all things; and when by the</HI> Devil, <HI>by the Cove of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n!</HI></P>

<HEAD>A Highwayman's Flash Song.</HEAD>
<L>COME an ye roving scamping blades,</L>
<L>That scamping take delight,</L>
<L>That go out on the bonny throw</L>
<L>Upon a darky night;</L>
<L>With pops into your pocket,</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="046227_0022_1020FE271BFB44E0"/>And lashes in your hand,</L>
<L>We'll ride up to the Dilligence,</L>
<L>And boldly bid her stand.</L>
<L>By stopping of the Diligence,</L>
<L>Put Jervis in a fright,</L>
<L>Who said I'll have your body hung</L>
<L>Before to-mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>w night.</L>
<L>I said ye gallows rogue</L>
<L>Haul in your bridle reins,</L>
<L>Or else a leaden bullet</L>
<L>Shall pierce your bloody brains.</L>
<L>Then to the inside passengers</L>
<L>Straightway we did repair,</L>
<L>To do them of their lowr,</L>
<L>It was our only care.</L>
<L>We dunn'd them of their lowr,</L>
<L>And thought it all our own.</L>
<L>We bid them a good darky,</L>
<L>They roll'd the road to town.</L>

<L>She's up to all the cross roads,</L>

<HEAD>A London Ken-cracking Song.</HEAD>
<L>COME all ye scamps both far and near,</L>
<L>Listen a while and ye shall hear,</L>
<L>How five young lads, who in their prime,</L>
<L>Were all cut off before their ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e.</L>
<L>Up Ludgate hill we did set cut,</L>

<L>Says Harry Jones, "as true's my name,</L>
<L>With iron chisels and crow-bars too,</L>
<L>To's iron Peter we'll soon break through."</L>
<L>And when his Peter we did burst,</L>
<L>His golden chain I hobbled first;</L>
<L>The next it was a diamond ring,</L>
<L>This was doing quite the thing.</L>
<L>With active hands and tongues <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> still,</L>
<L>With wedge and bit our sacks did till,</L>
<L>But when call'd for to be try'd,</L>
<L>The fact we all bore, I deny'd.</L>
<L>Frank being cast, to's mush did say,</L>
<L>With other prigs ne'er live I pray;</L>
<L>Jack Brim was there, Lyons the Jew,</L>
<L>Who turned snitch on lads so true.</L>
<L>There was Franc Finis, a hearty blade,</L>
<L>Isaac Barton besides my dad,</L>
<L>Charley Jones, Bill Thomson too,</L>
<L>Five cleverer lads ye never knew.</L>
<L>Your honest trades pray don't forsake,</L>
<L>For if ye do, ye'll rue the day</L>
<L>That e'er you scampt upon the lay.</L>
<L>Would'nt it grieve your hearts to see</L>
<L>Five clever lads hung on a tree,</L>
<L>Taking their leave and last farewel?</L>
<L>I hope in heaven their souls may dwell.</L>

<HEAD>Mount's flash song upon himself.</HEAD>
<L>COME ye prigs, and scamps full bold,</L>
<L>I'll sing you of a lad of fame,</L>
<L>Who in New-York town once did dwell,</L>
<L>And Thomas Mount it is my name.</L>
<L>As I was going out on the scamp,</L>
<L>Void of any dread or fear,</L>
<L>I was surrounded by the traps,</L>
<L>And to the quod they did me steer.</L>
<L>And when I come into the quod,</L>
<L>Captain R—ds did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e know,</L>
<L>Tommy come tip me the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it, he said,</L>

<L>Ram'd into his closest gaol,</L>
<L>I had some bits, his traps well know,</L>
<L>I lent some bits to fetch me s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck,</L>
<L>And then to cracking we did go.</L>
<L>And now I crack'd the quod again,</L>
<L>Away to thieving I will go,</L>
<L>Gardiner went to fetch me tools,</L>
<L>Away to — we did flow.</L>
<L>We dunn'd him out of all he had,</L>
<L>And then to Lovelies we did steer,</L>
<L>For to whet the bit ye know,</L>
<L>And in the ken we hobbled were.</L>
<L>Again they brought me to the quod,</L>
<L>The quaecall said, you ne'er shall go,</L>
<L>Hand me down large heavy irons,</L>
<L>On Thomas Mount a pair must go."</L>
<L>When the quaecall shut me up</L>
<L>I did not break my heart with woe,</L>
<L>I broke my slangs, then crack'd the quod.</L>
<L>Again to thieving I did go.</L>
<L><HI>Chorus,</HI> To thieving and cracking,</L>
<L>To scamping and napping,</L>
<L>Of coves with praddles,</L>
<L>Of kens with daddles</L>
