<P>POTTSTOWN, JANUARY 12th, 1800. Yesterday the Inhabitants of this village and its vi∣cinity assembled, to add their tribute of love and veneration for the great and good GENERAL WASHINGTON, to that so universally paid by other parts of his admiring country.—The morning was ushered in by firing six∣teen guns, and a gun was afterwards fired every half hour during the day. About noon a military and masonic procession was formed, which proceeded in the following order to the Church, the music playing a solemn dirge—the bell being muffled, and minute guns firing during the whole ceremony.</P>

<P>Forming the most numerous procession ever as∣sembled in this town. The Military marched with re∣served arms, their drums muffled, and standards and music in mourning. On arriving at the Church, they opened their ranks to the right and left, the whole

facing inward, and resting on reversed arms; form∣ing an avenue through which the Bier and remainder of the Procession passed into the church, where a sui∣table discourse was delivered by the Rev. Mr. John Armstrong, from 2 Sam. iii. 38—"<HI>Know ye not that, there is a Prince and a great Man fallen this Day in Israel.</HI>" The Bier was then taken from the church, and the ceremonies concluded by firing three vollies over it—After which the troops were formed, and marched off; the drums unmufflled and colours dis∣played, the Music played <HI>Washington's march,</HI> to the place of parade, and were dismissed. Capt. M'Clen∣tuch acted as officer of the day.</P>
<P>It would be injustice to the Military and to the Citizens not to observe, that the greatest order prevail∣ed during the whole of the ceremonies. The solem∣nity of the occasion impressed every mind, and the con∣duct of each individual displayed the sincere sorrow felt for the loss of the illustrious Man to whose memory they were paying the merited honours.</P>

<HEAD>SERMON ON THE DEATH OF GENERAL WASHINGTON PREACHED BY The Rev. JOHN ARMSTRONG AT POTTSTOWN.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>2 SAMUEL, Chapt. 3, vers 38.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Know ye not that there is a Prince and a great Man fallen this Day in Israel.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>These are the words of King David, when Abner fell by the hand of Joab. It was indeed at a critical moment, at the time when the house of Saul and
<PB N="6" REF="036848_0005_100B21BAE351DEC0"/>
the house of David were to be united. And happy it is, when contending na∣tions come to this blessed period, that they will no longer bath their swords in human blood, but be united in love, and agree to have one King to rule over them; and that is Christ, the King of Kings. David seemed much troubled for Abner, for he said to his servants, <HI>Know ye not that a Prince and a great Man is fallen in Israel</HI>—As if he had said, do you know, are you sensible of the loss of such a man at this time, a time of trouble, and great changes taking place. It is said, that David and the people wept over Abner. But my dear friends and fellow citizens; may I not say, know ye not that there is a Prince and a great Man fallen—Know ye not, ye Sons of America and of those nations who are involved in war, and staining the field with human blood, that WASHING∣TON the Great is fallen; but not by the hands of a Traitor as Abner fell, but by the hands of a kind Providence. He that in mercy gave him to his Country, has taken him from us; and it ought to be the language of every Christian, the
<PB N="7" REF="036848_0006_100B21BD087F4718"/>
Lord gave and the Lord has taken away, and blessed be the name of the Lord. It is our duty to bless the everlasting God, that he has spared him so long in the Land of the living. But it is only the grace of God that can enable us to glo∣rify him at <HI>all</HI> times. It may justly be said that a Prince and a great Man is fallen. In the first place it will be necessary to no∣tice the Appellation that is given in the Text, in the scripture sense of the words, namely <HI>a Prince and a great Man,</HI> and see how far these words agree with the present solemn occasion—The first of these that comes under our consideration is the appellation of a <HI>Prince.</HI> It is well known, that it is a title of honour given to the Son of a King, a Sovereign or a Chief Ruler—but some of my hearers may say, <HI>that</HI> was never given to our late General. Now I grant it was not. According to our Constitution, titles are done away. Yet is it not plain to every understanding, that he possessed those sublime qualifi∣cations, which justly merit the title of a Prince. My friends, were they not like the Sun, giving Light and heat, and dis∣persing the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and bringing great
<PB N="8" REF="036848_0007_100B21C0B32C20D0"/>
things to light? But this title is not only given to King's Sons, but to God the Governor of the world, and likewise to Christ, the Saviour of Mankind. It is said Isaiah Chapt. 9, vers 6, "For unto us a Child is born—Unto us a Son is given, and the governement shall be upon his shoulders, and his name shall be cal∣led the wonderful Counsellor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, the <HI>Prince</HI> of peace." He may well be called the Prince of peace, for it is through him and by him that we have Peace of Soul now, and Everlasting peace in the world to come—and it is <HI>such</HI> that the world can neither give nor take away—Sweet peace he gives to that Soul, that is weeping and longing for his presence, and is willing to become a true and a faithful Subject to the Prince of peace. Blessed be God, this was Christ's Legacy, which he left to all his followers to the end of time, John, Chap. 14, v. 27. "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you, not as the world giveth, give I unto you, let not your heart be troubled. Neither let it be afraid." And as Prince he gives peace to his subjects, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mighty Prince
<PB N="9" REF="036848_0008_100B21C2D7EA2970"/>
he maintains that Peace as in the case of the children of Israel, when Pharaoh pursued them, Exodus Chap. 14, v. 28. "And the waters returned and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh, that came into the Sea after them, there remained not so much as one of them." The Lord in all ages has appeared in their behalf. "The Stars in their courses shall fight for Is∣rael." Or does he countermand nature in any of its motions, and bid the Sun stand still in Gibeon, and the Moon in the val∣ley of Ajalon, it is that the armies of his people may have long Daylight, to sub∣due their enemies. Hailstone and Thun∣der shall break out of the clouds, to de∣stroy the Cananites, when Israel is at war with them. But if Israel wants bread in the wilderness the clouds shall drop down Manna, and give them bread from heaven. And how did the Lord appear for Peter, when he was kept in prison, Act, Chap. 12, v. 7. "And behold the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison, and he smote Peter on the side and raised him up, saying, arise up quickly, And his chains fell off
<PB N="10" REF="036848_0009_100B21C511E56BC0"/>
from his hands." Here you see Peter is bound, the angel unties him, he knows not where he is, the angel goes before him and guides him. In Revelation, Chap. 1 &amp; 5. Jesus Christ is styled "the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the Prince of the Kings of the Earth." As a Prince and a King he has a right to give laws and rule over his Subjects. Their dependance is upon him, from whom they receive their power and government, their protection and domi∣nion. But more especially are his people, indebted to him—for he leads them from victory to victory until he brings them to that Kingdom of Glory, that shall never end. His power as a King is great, for none dare say unto him, what doeth thou—he can turn the children of men into dust, and bring down the mighty from their Seats—and who can stay his hand? The Kings and Princes of this world have great power over their subjects. Many of them wantonly spil the blood of their people, and lay many heavy burdens upon them. But let them remember, they must appear before the mighty Prince, and answer for
<PB N="11" REF="036848_0010_100B21C698CD51C8"/>
their conduct. And as it is common for the Kings and the Princes of this world, to punish those that rebel against them; so will the Judge of all the Earth punish those who despise his Council and his reproof, especially every open and profane sinner. And as Paul tells us—Titus Chap. 1. 16. "They profess that they know God, but in works they deny him, being abominable and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobates." There are no sort of persons so odious to God, and so abominable in his sight, as those who make a profession of his holy name and truth, but walk contrary in their lives to that profession. And in ge∣neral, those that profess to love their Prince and prove Traitors, are severely punished—and of such St. Paul is speak∣ing; and I fear there are too many in this our day.</P>
<P>But in order that we may know them, let us see if we cannot discover them in 2 Tim. Chap. 3, vers 4 &amp; 5: "Traitors, heady, highminded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of Godliness, but denying the power thereof—from such turn away." Is not
<PB N="12" REF="036848_0011_100B21C8348C8B90"/>
this the case with many, who deny the power of God, and the love of God in the soul; and positively declare, that there is no such thing as knowing that Sin is forgiven, and the Spirit of God bearing witness in men that they are the children of God—"From such turn away," for they are robbers of Christ, and dishonour him in the greatest degree—and yet they will go to the table of the Lord; And like Judas betray the Son of Men. But remember that he will appear as a mighty Prince to the utter desolation of all his enemies, as it is written in Thessa∣lonians Chap. 1, v. 8 &amp; 9. He will come "in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them, that know not God, and that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the Glory of his Power." Remember what he decleared concern∣ing the Jews and Jerusalem, and that the prophecies came to pass. We are told by "Josephus, fearful sights and great things were seen, a Star in a shape like a sword, hanging over Jerusalem for a long time together—Armies fighting in
<PB N="13" REF="036848_0012_100B21CB964F74D0"/>
the clouds, and what he reckons worse than all, the extraordinary conduct of one Jesus, an apparent Lunatic, who for more then seven years went about the city, proclaiming, woe to Jerusalem? woe to the city, and to the temple and to the people, and could by no means be restrained."</P>
<P>The Supreme Judge and Prince of the Kings of the earth did not let the bar∣barous conduct of the Jews go unpunished. The most signal marks of divine Justice pursued them. We are informed by Dr. Mosheim's Church history, Vol 1. p. 323: "As indulgence was given by Julian for the Jews to rebuild the temble of Jeru∣salem, they set about it, from which how∣ever they were obliged to desist before they had even began to lay the foundation of the sacred edifice. For while they were removing the rubbish, formidable balls of fire, issuing out of the ground with a dreadful noise, dispersed both the works and the workmen, and repeated earthquakes filled the spectators of this astonishing phenomenon, with terror and dismay. This signal event is attested in a manner that renders its evidence irre∣sistable
<PB N="14" REF="036848_0013_100B21CD19E1D2F0"/>
"God will not be mocked." Call to your minds these words in the Revelation Chap. 6, v. 15—And the Kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every free men, hid themselves in tde dens, and in the rocks of the mountains." When Christ will ap∣pear an angry Lamb, the great ones in the world will fall before him; those that do not comply with the heavenly Prince, shall feel his wrath. Where my Fellow Citizens, where can you go from his pre∣sence,—none but Jesus can do helpless Sinners good—
<Q><LG>
<L>Sinners turn, why will ye die?</L>
<L>God your maker asks you, Why?</L>
<L>God, who did your being give</L>
<L>Made you with himself to live.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>But the Appellation, is given to the Church of Christ—they are called Princes, in Samuel 2 Chapt. 8th vers. "He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among <HI>Princes,</HI> and to make them inherit the throne of glory, for the pil∣lars
<PB N="15" REF="036848_0014_100B21CEA167C9D0"/>
of the Earth are the Lords, and he hath set the world upon them." But some of my hearers may say, are they so by nature? I answer—NO, they were children of wrath as others, born in sin and brought forth in iniquity, as the A∣postle tells us of some who had been guilty of great crimes—1 Cor. Chap. 6, vers 11. "And such were some of you, but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justifyed in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God." Thanks be to God, those who are of a princely nature, are changed by the Grace of God; that grace that enab∣les them to press forward to that heaven∣ly Prize. They know that this is not their resting place, for their Prince and King has a better country for them—they have a building with God, not made with hands, they can sweetly sing:
<Q><LG>
<L>Theer is my house and portion, for</L>
<L>My treasure and my heart is there</L>
<L>And my abiding home;</L>
<L>For me my elder Brethren stay</L>
<L>Till Angels beckon me away,</L>
<L>And Jesus bids me come.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="036848_0015_100B21D0EEDE7578"/>
It is natural to think that the fol∣lowers of Christ will strive to be like him; for he says: Learn of my, for I am meek and lowly of heart. It is their wish and desire, that their souls should be happy here and glorious hereafter. Remember what the Apostle saith: Those that are born after the Spirit, do mind the things of the spirit—and the same Spirit purifyeth their Souls by faith in Christ, and longing for a growth in grace, such as Love, Peace, long-suffering, gentleness, good faith, meekness. These are the beautiful ornaments the Christian desires to wear. The King doth greatly desire thy beauty, and holiness of heart. They are born for a noble end. It ts common for the Sons of Kings to wear costly garments—so do the Princes of God—they are clothed with a costly garment, not of their own making, No, that will not cover them.</P>
<LG>
<L>Thy Righteousness wearing,</L>
<L>And cleans'd by thy Blood,</L>
<L>Bold shall we appear,</L>
<L>In the Presence of God.</L>
</LG>
<P>It is true many of them are labouring under great troubles, and sorely buffeted
<PB N="17" REF="036848_0016_100B21D4623F8078"/>
by Satan, and meanly thought of by the wicked and the ungodly—It will be but a little while, and when Christ shall ap∣pear they shall be like him. Yet they are princes and shall wear the glorious garment, Psalm 45, v, 13, 14, 15. "The Kings Daughter is all glorious within, her clothing is of wrought Gold, she shall be brought unto the King in Remnants of Neadle Work—the virgins, her compa∣nions, that follow her, shall be brought into thee, with gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought, they shall enter unto the Kings Palace." Let the fol∣lowers of Christ rejoice, for it will not be long until they shall enter into his glory. The Sons of Kings have a great many attendants and so have the Princes of Christ, for all is yours for God is yours. Are not angels ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation; Those glorious spi∣rits are their attendants in life and in death,—they convoy them to the re∣gions of light. And what is best, they have God—"Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel, for I am with you." Happy People! When the Prince of
<PB N="18" REF="036848_0017_100B21D5E7CD21F8"/>
Princes, the King of Kings, doth meet with them, they can truly say, he brought me to the banquetting house, and his ban∣ner over me was love. But as they are Princes, they are entitled to a crown, and a kingdom—In the Revelations, Chap. 1, v. 6 "And he hath made us Kings and Priests unto God—And his father, to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever, Amen." Their king∣dom is an everlasting kingdom.</P>
<LG>
<L>How can it be thou Heavenly King;</L>
<L>That thou shouldst us to Glory bring</L>
<L>Make Slaves the Partners of thy throne</L>
<L>Deck'd with a never-failing Crown.</L>
</LG>
<P>They reign as Kings, not in a tem∣poral but in a spiritual sense, they reign as Kings over unruly lusts and corrup∣tions, over Satan, over the world, over death, the King of terrors—They reign upon earth, without which it is impossible to triumph in heaven—when the Christian has finished his course with patience and perseverance—"he shall wear the Crown of Life."</P>
<P>Earthly Princes have great power—and so have the Princes of God—It is said of Abraham "thou art a mighty Prince
<PB N="19" REF="036848_0018_100B21D76E588850"/>
among us." Great is their power with God. When the Lord was going to destroy So∣dom, Gen. Ch. 19, v. 22, he said to Lott, Haste thee, escape thither, for I can not do any thing till thou become thither." And Abraham plead with the Lord for that very city—I realy believe if it were not for the Princes of God, there would soon be an end to this world; they often plead with God in mighty prayers. The Angel that wrestled with Jacob, said: "Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel, for as a Prince hast thou power with God and with man, and hast prevailed." I pray God, that there were more wrestling Jacobs, that the Lord would revive his work in this our day, that there might be an ingathering to his king∣dom—There should we meet, where the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest. I can not yet leave this head, without admiring the patience of the blessed God, and King of Kings, who, tho' so strong and powerful, yet is provoked every day.—Surely as is his majesty, so is his mercy. If I villify but the name of a monarch, I lose my liberty and am confined to the dungeon or
<PB N="20" REF="036848_0019_100B21DA3B530300"/>
slavery. If I appear in arms and draw the sword against my national sovereign, my life is forfeited, and my very blood will scarcely atone for the crime. But have we not all dishonoured thee O thou King, immortal and invisible—happy are they that are under the shadow of his wings—But wo unto his enemies! Hear what the Prophet Samuel saith, Chapt. 2-10: "The adversaries of the Lord shall be broken to pieces, out of heaven shall he thunder upon them—the Lord shall judge the ends of the earth and he shall give strength unto his King, and exalt the horn of his anointed."</P>
<P>But we are told in the Text, that he was a <HI>great Man:</HI> A man may be great, and not be great in the sight of the Lord. We some times call a rich men a great men, and often they are very wicked—and God is not in all their thoughts—There are great philosophers and men of learning and eloquence—many of whom deny that Christ is the Son of the most high God. How little does God esteem the things that men count great! the endowments of wit and
<PB N="21" REF="036848_0020_100B21DD131715C0"/>
eloquence that men admire so much:—Alas<HI>!</HI> How poor are they to him! "for it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and bring to nothing the un∣derstanding of the prudent—where is the wise, where is the scribe, where is the disputer of this world—hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?" This may be applied to God for he alone is great, great in goodness and mercy, love and wisdom—and great in punishing the wicked, for great is sin when it is com∣mitted against a great God. Deuter, Chap. 10, v. 7. "For the Lord your God is God of Gods, and Lord of Lords, a great God, a mighty and a terrible God, who regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward." For to be great in the sight of God, is to know God, to have our sins pardoned, and the witness of his holy Spirit and Grace, to overcome the world, and say with a heartful expe∣rience, 1 John Chap. 4, v. 16: "And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us—God is love and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him." This indeed may be called great, where the Lord dwelleth. It
<PB N="22" REF="036848_0021_100B21DF3AB19AB0"/>
is said, by Isah. 5, Chap. 57, and vers 15: "For thus saith the high and lofty one that inhabits eternity, whose name is holy—I dwell in the high and holy place—with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the heart of the contrite ones." If God reigns in their hearts, they must be great in love and in saith, in usefulness and in integrity: for the glory of God, and the good of man∣kind are truly great objects—They are little men in the sight of God, that live in the world to little purpose, who do little for God and mankind—The Christ∣ian has a great desire, that all should come and pertake of the goodness of God—Psalms, Chap. 18, 35. "Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation, and thy right hand hath holden me up and thy gentleness hath made me great Grat shall be their reward, and great shall be their glory in the world to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome. And they shall be a great number, which no man can number, when the Lord shall appear in yonder clouds, then we shall see him face to face. Remember he is great, and he will help the weak.</P>

<L>The Lord shall in your front appear,</L>
<L>And lead the pompous triumph on,</L>
<L>His glory shall bring up the rear,</L>
<L>And perfect what his grace begun.</L>
</LG>
<P>Let us now enquire and see, how far the words of our Text agree upon the present solemn occasion—first, we may view our deceased Hero as a wise States∣man, as a warrior, and as a noble friend to the revealed religion of Christ and to his country.</P>
<P>But it is said, "<HI>that a Prince and a great Man is fallen</HI>"—Our brave WASHINGTON is fallen—O Death! thou mighty destroyer, thou, who hast brought Kings from their thrones and Princes from their seats—and hast cut down the youth in the prime of life, and vigour of health, while his breasts were full of milk, and his bones moistened with marrow. O Death! how dost thou surprise the youth, and bring the aged to the grave! Man's best estate is alto∣gether vanity.—O! trust not in youth or strength, or in any thing mortal, for there is nothing certain, nothing to be depended on beneath the unchangeable
<PB N="24" REF="036848_0023_100B21E3B417A1E0"/>
God. O death! thou art preparing a bed in the dust whither we shall shortly be followed by weeping mourners, and must take up our lodging, till the heavens are no more. Well might Solomon say: "And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the daughters of music shall be brought low." O death! thou hast taken one of the best of Generals, why didst thou take him? his country weeps—thou king of terrors—but it is the Lords doings, let him do what seemeth him good. But did I say the king of terrors? No, he is not the king of terrors to the new born soul—Death opens the gate for the beloved of the Lord—"lift up your heads O ye gates—and be ye lift up ye everlasting doors, that the heirs of glory may enter in." How calm is their eve∣ning of life—In what a smiling serenity does their sun go down—the followers of the Lord seem pleased and triumphant, even in their last moments—"God's everlasting arms are underneath them." When they find themselves surrounded by guardian Angels, instead of weeping

friends, how swiftly do they wing their way and pass to the regions of light.</P>

<L>No pain the inhabitants feel,</L>

<P>They quit the field not as captives but as conquerors, with hopes full of im∣mortality—here they sit down with Abra∣ham and Isaac and Jacob, in the kingdom of their father—here they are numbered with the innumerable company of Angels, and rejoice around the throne of the Lamb—here may I for ever live with all the saints I knew on earth! O comfor∣table meeting of my old acquaintances, with whom I prayed and wept, and suf∣fered!—O what a change is this—Fare∣well sin and suffering for ever! "But this mortal hath put on immortality, and the corruptible incorruption, and death is swallowed up in victory—O death were is thy sting, O grave where is thy victory!" Awake then O my drowsy soul, and look above this world of sorrow, what is honour? what are riches? and all the

glory of this world, compared to the en∣joyments of the saints in the blissfull regions of light.</P>
<P>There <HI>has fallen a Prince,</HI> but only to rise in glory. Like Elijah. they go swift∣ly in a chariot of fire—Let me live the life and die the death of the rigtheous, O let my latter end and future state be like theirs."</P>

<P>Let us be more particular in taking a view of our much lamented WASH∣INGTON. I am sensible my friends,
<PB N="27" REF="036848_0026_100B21E98F6FBC88"/>
of my incapacity of doing justice to the memory of this truly great Man. It re∣quires a genius like his own. Where shall I begin? Tell me, ye great men, who often heard wisdom drop from his lips—and ye noble warriors, who fought under his banner; you saw him, when troubles surrounded him; you, who saw him lead the armies of America into the field of battle—to maintain your rights—and saw him with honour returning from the field of blood. View him as a warri∣or, he was not like many of the proud kings and princes, who do not regard the lives of their subjects, but are deaf to the cries of the widows and fatherless children,—NO, he knew, that their lives were dear to their families and to their country, and to themselves. How many Generals, by their base conduct have been unable to lead their men on in the day of battle—and have fallen before their enemies. This was not the case with our WASHINGTON—he watched over your camps as well as your liberty—often surprised your enemies when they thought themselves secure.</P>
<P>May not the words of David be ap∣plied
<PB N="28" REF="036848_0027_100B21EC648B8F70"/>
to him, Psalm 18, v. 36: "Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip. I have pursued mine enemies and overtaken them. Neither did I return again, till they were con∣sumed. For thou hast girded me with strength unto battle. Thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me. They cried, but there was none to save them. Even unto the Lord, but he an∣swered them not. Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people, and thou hast made me the head of the heath∣en, a people whom I have not known, shall serve me. The Lord liveth, and blessed be my rock. And let the God of my Salvation be exalted."</P>
<P>When we consider the successes, and the victorious armies under our pious Ge∣neral, through the various events of long and bloody war against deep coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s and formidable strength, we may say the Lord was on our side.</P>
<P>When he returns from the field, he is not like many victorious generals, he is willing to assume the humble title of a ci∣tizen—here is a great proof of his love to his country.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="036848_0028_100B21EF5B7718F0"/>
But view him when his country calls on him for their Ruler, as President over a great nation—with what wisdom and sound judgment does he rule the nation. When you saw him walking through your streets, you saw the Man whom the people delighted to honour, and guided the political helm with great wisdom.</P>
<P>I think my hearers, the words of Job may properly be applied to him, Job, ch. 29, v. 7: "When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared my seat in the street, the young men saw me and hid themselves, and the aged a∣rose and stood up, the princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth. The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth. When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me. Because I de∣livered the poor that cried, and the fa∣therless, and him that had none to help him. I put on righteousness, and it clo∣thed me: my judgment was as a rope and a diadem." The queen of Sheba came from Ethiopia, to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and see his glory.
<PB N="30" REF="036848_0029_100B21F0E110DBE8"/>
Many kings and princes have been asto∣nished at the wisdom of our General, and many thousand that came from different nations, were ready to say, as the queen of Sheba said to the king: "It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts, and of thy wisdom—Howbeit, I believed not the words, until I came and mine eyes had seen it, and, behold, the half was not told me. Thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard. Happy are thy men—happy are those thy servants, which stand con∣tinually before thee, and hear thy wis∣dom."</P>
<P>After he had filled that important station as President of his country with honour—he retired to prepare for a more glorious kingdom, not regarding the honour of this perishing world, and I have no doubt but he saw it all vanity of vanities.</P>

It appears, my hearers, that our great WASHINGTON, in all the chan∣geable scenes of life, had his eye fixed on the great Creator of all things. He was not ashamed to confess his God, as the only ruler of the world, and the fountain of all happiness. But we trust he is gone to receive the glorious reward: Well done good and faithful servant.—And no doubt, it will be remembered with applause what he has done for this nation, as long as it exists. May I not say as Moses said: "Happy art thou, O Israel, who is like unto thee O people saved by the Lord,—the shield of thy help: and who is the sword of thy Ex∣cellency—and thy enemies shall be found liars unto thee, and thou shall tread upon their high places."—</P>
<P>What Nation enjoys such civil and religious liberty as we do—remember what troubles the Christians underwent in ages past—the followers of Christ were often put to death by wicked kings and rulers. Under some princes we see the most diligent search made after the fol∣lowers of Christ, and on bare information, or their own confession, immediately
<PB N="32" REF="036848_0031_100B21F6EBB018E8"/>
dragged away to execution—unless they prevented their punishment by Apostacy. Under others, we see inhuman ma∣gistrates endeavouring to compel them by all sorts of tortures to renounce their profession. Many fell by the hand of bloody persecutions, and expired in the cause of the divine Saviour—The Christ∣ians suffered under that monster of cruel∣ty. Nero—he accused them of having set fire to the city of Rome, that horrid crime which he himself had committed, with a barbarous pleasure.—In avenging this crime upon the innocent Christians he ordered matters so, that the punishment should bear some resemblance to their of∣fence: he therefore wrapped up some of them in combustible garments, and or∣dered fire to be set to them, when the darkness came on, that thus, like torches they might dispel the obscurity of the night; while others were fastened to crosses or torn in pieces by wild beasts, or put to death in some such dreadful manner. According to some ancient ac∣counts, St. Paul and St. Peter suffered martyrdom then.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="036848_0032_100B21F9C80832B8"/>
Others have since suffered for the cause of Christ, under Lewis the XIV.—What horrid scenes then took place! Fathers and mothers having beheld their suckling infants perish in their sight, were themselves afterwards put to death by the most cruel tortures—and if any to escape these barbarities endeavoured to save themselves by flight, they were pursued into the fields and woods, and were shot at like wild beasts.</P>
<P>Many also in England, Scotland, and Ireland, suffered greatly. But those that are not much acquainted with history, may think these things not true: they are however established on the best autho∣rity. What a great mercy that we are not under these bloody Princes! But I fear we do not sufficiently value our pri∣vileges. We have line upon line.—Li∣berty is only sweet to those who have lately groaned under the cruel bondage of tyranny and oppression—and health is only sweet to those who have long been afflicted with sickness. Happy it will be for us, if we are truly thankful to God for all his mercies and the privileges of
<PB N="34" REF="036848_0033_100B21FB4CA39498"/>
his Gospel. Deut. Chap. 4, v. 6-10. "Keep, therefore, and do them, for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all those statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and under∣standing people. For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto them, as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for? And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and judgments so righteous, as all this law which I set before you this day? Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life; but teach them thy sons, and thy sons sons."</P>
<P>Ingratitude is a great sin in the sight of God. The prophecy of our Lord we have seen remarkably fulfilled in our days—and yet God has been graciously pleased not to suffer any one of those ca∣lamities to come near our dwellings.</P>
<P>We have seen nations rise up against nations, and kingdoms, against kingdom;
<PB N="35" REF="036848_0034_100B21FD74B30338"/>
we have seen fire and sword consume round about us, and many fruitful coun∣tries ravaged and destroyed, yet at the same time we have sat, every man under his vine and under his fig-tree, enjoying all the blessings and happiness of peace—we have seen want and famine spread de∣solation over different countries, whilst we have been even luxurious in the abun∣dance of overflowing plenty,—we have heard of populous and flourishing towns, overthrown in one day by an earthquake; while our habitations have been, as the Scripture speaks, the munition of rocks; he that feareth God shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty, under his secure protection. When we look to the histo∣ry of the Jewish nation, from the coming out of Egypt to their final captivity, it is one continued instance of Providence, watching over the righteous—when they came to enter into the promised land, no force was able to stand before them. And when they were possessed of it, no nation was able to drive them out, parti∣cularly when the whole body of them went up to Jerusalem to appear before the Lord thrice in the year,—their land
<PB N="36" REF="036848_0035_100B21FF9B815220"/>
was by a peculiar providence preserved from being invaded. So long as they kept God's commandments, so that he did not behold iniquity in Jacob, neither had seen perverseness in Israel; they were constantly happy and dwelt safely—And though we often read indeed, that they were oppressed by their enemies, and brought to great distress, yet this never happened, but when they had first depar∣ted from their integrity. Let us remem∣ber, if we forsake God, He can commis∣sion his destroying Angel, to smite us in a moment—Or if we continue to provoke him, he can inflict judgments upon us much more severe, than the most devou∣ring pestilence, by delivering us into the hands of men, whose mercies are cruelty, and equally destructive of the lives and the souls of men, by taking away the key of knowledge, and establishing ignorance and utterly destroying the foundations <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all regard to God, and all truth, justice and righteousness towards man. Then let us with one consent, strive to walk in the fear of God—and when we make choice of men for our rulers and judges and ma∣gistrates, let them be men of clean hands,
<PB N="37" REF="036848_0036_100B22028F6D6EB0"/>
and firm friends to the religion of Jesus Christ. God forbid that we should make choice of those men, that are enemies to the Gospel of our Lord. If we do, we shall bring down the judgments of God upon us—They will be the greatest ene∣mies to our nation, however, wise they may be in politics. Let them be men that follow the practice of virtue and true re∣ligion, and especially where it is more ne∣cessary, as in the choice of governors, who, if truly pious most illustriously ap∣pear the true vice-gerents of God. Re∣member the words of our late President, in his Address to the People of the United States: "<HI>Of all dispositions and habits, which lead to political prosperity, Religi∣on and Morality are indispensible supports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who should labour to subvert these great pillars of human happiness—these firmest props of the duties of man and citizens, the mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to respect and to che∣rish. A volumn could not trace all their connections with private and public felici∣ty—let it simply be asked, where is the security for property, for reputation, for
<PB N="38" REF="036848_0037_100B220414030818"/>
life, if the sense of Religious obligations desert the oaths, which are instruments of investigations in courts of justice.</HI>"</P>
<P>May the Lord send down his holy Spirit upon our President—and upon all our Governors, and Judges! And may he raise up more like our worthy Gene∣ral, who will prove friends to their coun∣try, and supporters of the gospel of Christ—Let us contribute our utmost, each in our proper station, to support a Government so happily established—that it may be as little burdensome as possible in the hands wherein it is lodged, Jer. 29, 7: "To seek the peace of the city," or country, wherein we dwell, is Man's duty and interest, even under bad Go∣vernments: how much more so under the best and most wisely constituted Go∣vernment in the world, by which our rights, liberties and religion are firmly secured.</P>
<P>Now my fellow citizens, and sol∣diers, you that are soldiers in defence of your country, let me intreat you, to be soldiers of Christ, and "put on the
<PB N="39" REF="036848_0038_100ADCAFB8A261F0"/>
whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the viles of the devil." You have lost your General. But may Christ, the King of Kings be your King—and may you fight under the banner of <HI>him,</HI> that died for <HI>you.</HI>—</P>
<P>And, my Fellow Citizens, we have lost a Friend, and Father to his Coun∣try—if the Lord takes an Elijah, he is able to raise up Elisha—and I trust, that we <HI>have</HI> one.—Let me conclude with a few words by way of application—I fear there are some here, this day, that very seldom come to the house of God, and who are rebels against the Prince of life.—But remember, if you are yet in your sins, I say unto you, as the Apostle Peter said to the Jews, "Repent ye there∣fore, and be converted that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord." God is calling by his Spi∣rit, by death and judgments, and yet I fear, you sit still, and trifle away your time. What do you mean, what do you think of the world? It is passing away, its pleasures are fading, its honours are
<PB N="40" REF="036848_0039_100B2208A3B72870"/>
leaving you, its profits will prove unpro∣fitable to you—heaven or hell are a little before you. God is just and jealous, his threatnings are true—the great day of his judgment will be terrible, your time runs on, your lives are uncertain—I fear, some of you are far behind hand—you have loitered long—you are strangers to God:—you are hardened in all evil customs—have you any assurance of comfort to shew, if you die tomorrow: are you rea∣dy—(is the love of God in you) if not, with what terror will your souls go out of your bodies? God standeth all this while waiting your leisure—his patience beareth, his justice forbeareth, his mercy entreateth you.—Christ standeth offering you his blood and merits, you may have him freely—O! take warning in time—Remember, if he is not your prince to reign over you, and in you, he will laugh at your calamity—and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mock when your fear cometh, when your fear cometh as a desolation, and your destruction as a whirlwind—when distress and anguish cometh upon you.—Remember what a nation you live in—you have the light of the glorious Gospel
<PB N="41" REF="036848_0040_100B220AC8BEEFF8"/>
of Christ—Let your prayer be like the blind man: "Thou Son of God, have mer∣cy on me." If you turn unto God, you will be good Citizens here and reign with your Prince the King of Kings, in glory; which may God Grant, Amen.—</P>
