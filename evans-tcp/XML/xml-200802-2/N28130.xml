<HEAD>AN ORATION, &amp;c. FEBRUARY 22, 1800.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY FELLOW CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE are now assembled to review the life and to lament the Death, of the first of uninspired Men. We have often met to celebrate our national Independence. We never be∣fore assembled to weep over the memory of the man, who un∣der the auspices of heaven established us an Independent Na∣tion. The grateful tribute, which America this day pays her Washington will not be forgotten. It will be registered in the annals of our country for the instruction of mankind, and remotest posterity will read with mournful pleasure and admiration our expressions of gratitude and grief. As the death of this great man is a national calamity, there is a pro∣priety in our national conduct. And since this day, sixty eight years, introduced him into life, this day is fitly chosen, for the people to assemble in their respective cities and villa∣ges, as a nation to recollect his virtues and bewail his death.</P>
<P>WHEN great and good men fall, in proportion to their greatness and goodness is the public loss, and in the same proportion should be the public grief. If the character of Washington may be estimated by the effusions of grief, which in the moment of general feeling have been poured forth to his memory, he was great and good. His memory shall live. It shall live, to stimulate others to live like him, and as a tri∣bute due to departed merit.</P>
<P>WHEN Moses died, the Children of Israel wept for him in the plains of moab thirty days. With equal justice may the inhabitants of this land weep for their beloved Washington. By his death every description of citizens is called to mourn∣ing, and such as are skillful in lamentation to wailing. And while freedom waves her banner over this happy land, all the singing men and singing women will speak of him in their lamentations.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="037493_0003_100D4636AE685B18"/>IF we search the pages of ancient or modern times, in what age or country shall we find a character so universally belov∣ed and respected? Such is the reputation, which he acquir∣ed and preserved thro' life, that the man, who attempts to wound his fame, brings dishonor upon himself. His eminent talents were consecrated to the service of his country. His exalted virtues gave him the first seat in the hearts of his Fellow Citizens. He lived and died the ornament of human nature, his country's pride and boast.</P>
<P>Illustrious men have frequently risen up, who have been eminently useful in their day. But they have generally ex∣hibited to the world a versatility of character. Not so the illustrious Washington. However diversified his lot, he ex∣hibited himself the same. In prosperity and adversity he has been uniformly great and good.—Men of talents, devoid of principle, instead of being blessings to the world, generally prove scourges to mankind. The man, whose memory we now honor, was endowed with uncommon talents, and pos∣sessed of virtuous principles. These united have rendered him a rich blessing to his country; and while talents and vir∣tue are respected, he will command the esteem, &amp; stand forth the admiration of the world.</P>
<P>IN all the relations and characters, which he sustained, he merits attention. Whether we view him in <HI>public</HI> or in <HI>pri∣vate</HI> life, as a WARRIOR, a STATESMAN, or a CITIZEN, we love &amp; admire the man. The transactions of this day, my friends, will rather diminish, than add to his Glory. For as the finest pencil cannot paint like nature, so no portrait will be drawn of his character, which will justly represent him. Too low or too high coloring will mar every picture. The most strik∣ing resemblance will be the most beautiful.</P>
<P>BUT however deficient we may be in taking the portrait of our Washington, we shall express our gratitude for his ser∣vices, and our admiration of his character. We shall ex∣hibit a Phaenomenon, new in the history of nations; a repub∣lic, which knows how to appreciate and reward the services of her citizens.</P>
<P>THE highest happiness of Rome consisted in sending into exile the men, who had rendered her the most signal services. Ingratitude has hitherto been characteristic of republics. We shall rescue them from this reproach. It is left to the eighteenth
<PB N="5" REF="037493_0004_100D4638AA54C2F0"/>
century, and to this western world, properly to respect merit. America has never lost sight of the virtues, nor forgotten the good deeds of her Washington. And she will this day re∣view his life with as much pleasure, as the traveller repeats the story of his travels, the seaman his adventures, and the warrior the battles he has won.</P>
<P>GEORGE WASHINGTON was the 3'd son of Mr. AUGUSTINE WASHINGTON, a wealthy farmer of distinguished reputation in Virginia. His ancestors came from England about the year 1657. He was the first fruit of a second marriage, and at the commencement of our Revolution had living three Brothers, and one sister. Under a private tutor he was taught the ru∣diments of the Latin language, English Grammar, &amp; the ele∣ments of the Mathematics. At the age of ten years he bu∣ried his Father. The morning of his days however did not pass inactive, nor was it spent in vanity and vice. While a pure mountain air and the healthy occupations of rural life favoured the production of a large and well proportioned bo∣dy, his application to useful studies tended to the formation of a correct and solid mind. Having laid the foundation of his eminence in its proper season, he entered the theatre of life, peculiarly well calculated to act the noble part, which we have seen him exhibit. No man ever walked the stage to better advantage, or left it with greater applause.</P>
<P>WITH what satisfaction may we take a view of him in the character of a CITIZEN? Virtuous simplicity adorned his pri∣vate life. In his family seat at Mount Vernon, we behold him exhibiting to his fellow citizens an example worthy of Imitation. He was the greatest farmer of which his Country did boast. In 1776 his landed property was estimated at "more than a hundred and sixty thousand pounds sterling." He raised in one year <Q>seven thousand bushels of wheat, &amp; ten thousand of Indian Corn.</Q> The year following he raised <Q>two hundred lambs, sowed twenty seven bushels of flax seed, &amp; planted more than seven hundred bushels of potatoes. He had manufactured under his own eye, by his domestics, linen and woollen cloth sufficient for his household, which confus∣ed of nearly a thousand souls.</Q> The strictest oeconomy and most exemplary method were established in all his depart∣ments. Reports were weekly received by him from his overseers, and correctly registered in his agricultural books: and at the end of every year, he was able accurately to de∣termine the labor and produce of his farm. Husbandry was
<PB N="6" REF="037493_0005_100D463A983CC1F8"/>
his delight, and as he cultivated his farm with pleasure, so with equal pleasure he <HI>contributed more</HI> than any <HI>Farmer</HI> in America to the support of that Government, which confirmed him in the possession, and secured to him the profits of his farm. The blessings of good Government he knew how to appreciate, and while he gloried in American Freedom, he yielded, as a subject, implicit obedience to his country's laws.</P>
<P>IN domestic and social life, he was a kind husband, a gentle master, an unfailing friend, and a bountiful benefactor. <HI>When the ear heard</HI> him <HI>it blessed</HI> him, <HI>and when the eye saw</HI> him, <HI>it gave witness to</HI> him; for he <HI>delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him.</HI> In his intercourse with his fellow men, the strictest honor &amp; integrity were stamped upon his conduct, and punctuality marked all his engagements. Kind and generous in his dis∣position, <HI>the blessings</HI> of many <HI>ready to perish came upon</HI> him, and he <HI>caused the widows heart to sing for joy.</HI></P>
<P>REGULARITY, temperance &amp; industry were habits in which he lived. He generally rose at the dawn of day and his usual hour for retirement was nine in the evening. Every hour had assigned to it its proper employment: &amp; to his own &amp; his country's honor be it spoken, in these assignments religion had its place. Amidst the multiplicity of his concerns he remem∣bered God. This is the brightest part of this great man's Character. Feeling his entire dependence, he daily, at stat∣ed seasons, paid his acknowledgements to his maker and sought his blessing. With what pleasure do we behold him expressing the morality of the gospel in his life, and ascribing, in his public, writings, <Q>the meliorated condition of man∣kind, and the encreased blessings of society, <HI>to the</HI> PURE <HI>and benign light of</HI> REVELATION?</Q> With what pleasure do we behold him, offering up earnest prayer to God, that he would dispose us all, to exhibit in our lives those virtues, <Q>which were the characteristics of the DIVINE AUTHOR <HI>of our</HI> BLESSED RELIGION; <HI>without an humble imitation of whose example,</HI></Q> in this respect, <Q><HI>we can never hope to be a hap∣py nation?</HI></Q> He was punctual and devout in his attendance upon the instituted worship of Christ. He honored Gods Sab∣baths: &amp; may we not charitably hope, that God gave him in his house and within his walls, <HI>a place and a name, better than of sons and of daughters?</HI></P>
<P>LET us now turn and view him in PUBLIC LIFE. Here he

presen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s himself to us in two important characters, that of a warr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r and a statesman. In the Cabinet and in the Field he has none with distinguished lustre, and we may contemplate hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in both with peculiar pleasure.</P>
<P>His talents as a CIVILIAN did not pass unnoticed by his na∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve state. From the year 1759, when he resigned his com∣mission, as Commander in chief of all the Virginia forces, which had been raised, to repel the French, who were endea∣vouring to subjugate these colonies, and annex them to the Crown of France, he was constantly a member of assembly, till the year '74; when he was called to take a more conspic∣uous part in the politicks of his country. He was <Q>a magis∣trate of the county in which he lived, and a judge of the court;</Q> and in this capacity discharged his duty with sin∣gular applause. Clothed with righteousness, he was <HI>eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame, and the cause,</HI> which he <HI>knew not,</HI> he <HI>searched out.</HI> When the rapacious hand of Britain was grasping at the liberties of America, he was honored by his fellow citizens with a seat in the first and second Congress, which assembled to consult the interests of the nation.</P>
<P>SINCE the establishment of our Independence, we have seen him acting a very interesting and dignified part. We have seen him in our public councils like the stately cedar in the forest. He was President of that Convention, which in the summer of '87, in Philadelphia, framed that excellent Con∣stitution of Government, which is the Bulwark of American liberty. When, according to the Constitution, a man was sought for, to sit at helm and execute the laws, by the united voice of his country he was called to this important station. On the 30th of April '89, in the City of New-York, amidst the acclamations of thousands, he was inaugurated President of the United States.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">At this time he was clothed in a suit of American Man∣ufacture.</NOTE> Twice was he thus publickly invested with the highest Office, which a grateful people could bestow. With what honor to himself and advantage to his country he discharged the duties of this elevated action, let the blessing of millions testify, which followed him from the chair of state to the peaceful retreats of private life. Thro' two successive periods of the presidency, while great convulsions were agi∣tating the nations with whom we stood connected, with what wisdom did he steer our national bark upon the <Q>tempestuous sea of Liberty?</Q> Haughty Briton preyed upon our Com∣merce.
<PB N="8" REF="037493_0007_100D463F4F6E2260"/>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>British Order</HI> for bringing in neutrals was issued <HI>June</HI> 8<HI>th,</HI> 1793. France had issued a <HI>similar Order</HI> on the 9<HI>th</HI> of the <HI>preceding</HI> month, in consequence of which the vessels of the <HI>United States</HI> were <HI>captured,</HI> and their <HI>cargoes disposed</HI> of in the ports of France.</NOTE> Crafty <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">When <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>net,</HI> the first minister from the Republic, arrived in America, he declared in his <HI>public addresses,</HI> that <HI>France</HI> did <HI>not</HI> wish us to <HI>engage</HI> in the <HI>War.</HI> Upon being recalled, he published his <HI>Instructions,</HI> in which he was directed to <HI>bring us in at all adventures.</HI></NOTE> France attempted to exercise the rights of sovereignty <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Genet landed at Charleston, and before he reached Philadelphia and could possibly be acknowledged as a Minister, he began to <HI>exercise</HI> the <HI>rights of sovereign∣ty.</HI> After his reception, he <HI>continued</HI> to exercise these rights, tho' <HI>expressly pro∣hibited,</HI> by the <HI>President.</HI> All this was done, at a moment, when the greatest part of Europe was leagued against France, and America was the only power ac∣knowledging the Republic.</NOTE> and prostrate our Independence. Jarring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nti∣ments disturbed our public councils and the tranquility of our citizens: superior to them all, we see him acting with a decision peculiar to himself, and having assumed a neutr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l station, resolved to maintain it. Unawed by fear, uninflu∣enced by party, like a rock in the midst of the sea against which the waves dash in vain, he resolved that we should be respect∣ed as an Independent nation, and that no act of his should in∣volve us in those calamities under which Europe groaned. Successful in his measures, and grown old in his country's service, with a glory equal to his years, he nobly retired from the <Q>boundless field of public action, incessant trouble and high responsibility,</Q> and cheerfully assumed the Citizen.</P>
<P>LET us now turn and contemplate this great man in the character of a WARRIOR. In the morning of life he exhibited proofs of his military Genius. "At the age of 15 he was entered a midshipman on board a British ship of war, and had his baggage prepared for embarkation": but in compli∣ance with his mother's wishes, who expressed a "reluctance at his engaging in that profession," he relinquished the plan. Before he reached the age of 21 he was honored with the rank of major in the military department. In 53 we find him engaged in an important and perilous embassy to the French and Indians, who were making encroachments upon our western frontiers. Behold the illustrious Washington, at the age of 21, pressing through the wilderness on foot, with his provisions on his back, to remonstrate with the French commander, and treat with the hostile Tribes. Be∣hold him with patriotic ardor entering upon this important service, in an uncommonly severe season, accompanied with few attendants! Ramsay, the Historian, says, but one.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="037493_0008_100D464156946928"/>THE next year, we find him with a Colonel's Commission at the head of 300 men, going forth with dauntless courage to oppose these invaders of his country. Learning from a prisoner, that the enemy were 1500 strong, he encamped with his little army, now encreased to about 400 effective men, at a place called the <HI>Great Meadows.</HI> Here he threw up some temporary works, which from his peculiar situation he named <HI>Fort Necessity.</HI> While he here waited, expecting reinforcements, he was attacked by nearly four times his number of French and Indians. In this desperate situation, after a brave resistance, worthy of himself, he nobly capitula∣ted, and marched out at the head of his troops with the honors of war.</P>
<P>THE year following, GENERAL BRADDOCK came over with two veteran Regiments to the assistance of the colonies. But such was the arrangement of rank that "no officer who did not <HI>immediately</HI> derive his commission from the KING, could command one who did." Colonel WASHINGTON there∣fore resigned his commission, and as a volunteer and extra aid de camp, joined the General. In marching for fort <HI>du quesne,</HI> they were unexpectedly met by the enemy. A hard fought and bloody battle ensued, which terminated in the total defeat of Braddock's army. Colonel WASHINGTON nobly distinguished himself on this trying occasion. By <HI>his</HI> valor many were rescued from slaughter on that calamitous day. <Q>He was the only officer, whose duty obliged him to be on horseback during the battle who was not either killed or wounded. Providence seemed to reserve him to save from utter destruction the wreck of a defeated army.</Q> With his brave provincials he covered the confused retreat, and hasten∣ed to concert measures for their future safety. Notwithstand∣ing the fatigues of the preceeding day, we behold him with two guides travelling the dreary wilderness, in the darksome night, and so exausted in the morning, as to be under the ne∣cessity of being supported with cushions on his horse! Noble youth! how did the love of country inflame thy breast? President Davies, in a sermon preached to a military compa∣ny in the year '55, points him out to the public, as one, whom Providence had hitherto preserved, in the most signal manner, for some important service to his country.</P>
<P>The government of Virginia, sensible of his merits, in a new commission, placed him at the head of all the troops
<PB N="10" REF="037493_0009_100D464306BDA988"/>
raised, and to be raised in that colony. This commission he held with singular credit, till the French and Indians were entirely vanquished, and tranquility was restored.</P>
<P>IN '59 he exchanged the soldier for the citizen, married the widow Martha Curtis, and settled as a farmer at Mount Vernon. Here he cultivated the arts of peace, till the year '75, when by the unanimous vote of Congress, of whom he was himself a member, he was placed at the head of the ar∣mies of the United States.</P>
<P>WE come now to an interesting period in the life of this great man. His actions from that day forward are familiar to our minds. We no longer contemplate him, as directing the forces of an individual state; but as heading the armies of 13 states in union; and founding an empire, which will rise and rise, till it shall far exceed the most celebrated empires of ancient date.</P>
<P>LET us cast ourselves back to the commencement of the <HI>American Revolution.</HI> With what feelings will a recollecti∣on of the hopes and fears of that anxious day inspire our minds? Happy in the inheritance left us by our fathers, we hoped still to enjoy it; and to transmit it unimpaired to pos∣terity. The projects of Great Britain alarmed our fears. We saw this haughty nation, whom we had been taught to look up to, as to a parent, envying us the happiness of free born sons, and grasping at our liberties. On the one hand, to depress our spirits, the power of Britain was great. On the other, to excite our hopes and stimulate our exertions, the prize for which we were to contend was greater.</P>
<P>WE were sensible, that we were in possession of a goodly land, where we might eat in safety the increase of the field, and suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock. We considered, that it was the gift of Heaven to our fathers, who fled from persecution in their native land. We called to mind the dangers, which they braved: how they gat their bread by the peril of their lives because of the sword of the wilderness. We remembered how God was with them: how he protected them as the apple of his eye, and bore them as on eagles wings. We encouraged ourselves, that the God of our fathers would be our God; and relying upon his aid, we resolved to <HI>live</HI> and <HI>die</HI> like <HI>Freemen,</HI> in the full possessi∣on of our rights.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="037493_0010_100D4644ADA1D2E0"/>STILL, <HI>fears</HI> were in the way. From one end of the con∣tinent to the other, the cry was made: There is no <HI>king</HI> in us and our <HI>counsellor</HI> is perished. The GOD of our pious fathers heard the cry, and presented <HI>himself</HI> as our <HI>king.</HI> We paid him homage. He raised us up <HI>counsellors.</HI></P>
<P>Our hearts were soon pained within us at the sound of the trum∣pet &amp; the alarm of war. He raised us up <HI>warriors.</HI> He raised up WASHINGTON to head our armies, &amp; lead us on to Victory and Independence. To the astonishment of the world, the earth brought forth at once, &amp; a <HI>nation was born in a day!</HI></P>
<P>TIME will not permit us to recapitulate the various incidents of the revolution in which the illustrious WASHINGTON ap∣peared so glorious. Clouds and darkness many times rested upon our prospects; but in the most gloomy season, this great man retained the affection and confidence of his fellow soldiers and fellow citizens. In the darkest hour, when hearts of oak were ready to yield, he remained firm and undaunted, &amp; never lost sight of the pillar of cloud, and the pillar of fire.</P>
<P>BEHOLD him in the Jerseys, with his little army, hunted up and down like a Patridge upon the mountains. Who but WASHINGTON could have inspired his feeble band with courage, fleeing before a victorious enemy, and inscribing upon the <HI>frozen</HI> ground, with their <HI>naked</HI> feet, their attachment to their General, in <HI>letters of blood?</HI></P>
<P>BUT perhaps in no instance during the revolutionary war, does this great man appear so great, as in the closing scene. A victorious army was about to be disbanded. The exhausted resources of the country rendered it impossible to give them present compensation for their services. By the artful insinua∣tions of an anonymous writer the minds of Officers and Sol∣diers were inflamed, and they were just ready to turn their swords upon that very country, which they had so gloriously defended. The illustrious WASHINGTON stepped forth. He conjured them by the rights of humanity, by the honor of soldiers, by the patriotism of citizens, not to <Q>open the flood gates of civil discord, and deluge their rising empire with blood.</Q></P>
<P>HIS unbounded influence, over an army, which had parti∣cipated in his toils and dangers, and been witnesses of his wisdom and valor, rendered him victorious. The tumult
<PB N="12" REF="037493_0011_100D46471AFB6110"/>
subsided. They unanimously resolved, that <Q>no circumstances of distress or danger, should induce a conduct, that might tend to fully the reputation and glory they had acquired.</Q></P>
<P>WITH what splendor does the, the noble WASHINGTON appear in this transaction? Why did he not, by a single word, blow up into a <HI>blaze</HI> the seditious spark, and like Octavianus in∣spire his soldiers to demand the <HI>consulate</HI> for their General? Why did he not, like the conqueror of Italy and Egypt, with the unmeaning expressions of Liberty and Equality in his mouth, <HI>seize upon the administration of his country;</HI> and be∣cause he could swear by no greater, <HI>swear</HI> in <HI>his own name</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onaparte's speech, at the Bar of the Elders, Nov. 9th 1799, when he had <HI>forcibl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> over turned the Constitution of his Country.</NOTE> and in the name of his comrades in arms, that he would main∣tain a republic, upon the basis of rational liberty &amp; equal rights? Deeds, like these, how hateful to the pure and elevated mind of WASHINGTON! With a dignity peculiar to himself, he sur∣rendered into the hands of Congress, the appointment, which he "accepted with diffidence"; and with heartfelt satisfaction, the blessing of millions attending him, retired from the ser∣vice of his country, hoping never to embark again on the "tempestuous and uncertain ocean of public life."</P>
<P>THE wishes of his fellow citizens corresponded with his own, that he might never again be called to assume the cha∣racter of a soldier. But how vain are mortal wishes? His country once more demands his aid, as commander of her forces. He obeys the summons.</P>
<P>HIS obedience could not result from motives of <HI>private interest</HI>: for with a noble generosity, such as he had been accustomed <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">When appointed to command the American forces in 1775; and when he accepted the Presidency of the United States, he expressly declared receiving any pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uniary compensation for his services.</NOTE> to exercise, he expressly declined receiving any emolument annexed to the appointment. It could not result from a desire of <HI>aggrandizing himself</HI> and <HI>family,</HI> by the de∣struction of our <HI>republic,</HI> and the establishment of a <HI>monarchy</HI> upon its ruins: for he knew that his lamp was nearly <HI>ex∣pended,</HI> that a crown would <HI>tarnish</HI> his glory, and that he had neither <HI>child</HI> nor <HI>brother.</HI> It must therefore have re∣sulted from that patriotism, which ever fired his breast, and from a conviction of the <HI>necessity</HI> of the <HI>measures</HI> adopted
<PB N="13" REF="037493_0012_100D4648C0DF1560"/>
by <HI>administration.</HI> This conviction is completely stamped upon his letter of acceptance. Writing to the President he says: <Q>Satisfied, that you have <HI>sincerely</HI> wished and endea∣vored to avert war, and exhausted to the <HI>last drop</HI> the cup of reconciliation, we can with pure hearts appeal to Hea∣ven for the justice of our cause; and may confidently trust the final result to that kind Providence, who has heretofore, and so often, signally favored the people of these U. States. Thinking in this manner, and feeling how incumbent it is upon <HI>every person</HI> to <HI>contribute</HI> at all times to his coun∣try's welfare, and <HI>especially</HI> in a <HI>moment like the present, when every thing we hold dear and sacred</HI> is so <HI>seriously threatened,</HI> I have finally determined to accept the com∣mission of Commander in chief of the Armies of the Uni∣ted States. I take the liberty to mention, that I must de∣cline having my acceptance considered, as drawing after it any immediate charge upon the public; or that I can re∣ceive any emoluments annexed to the appointment, before entering into a situation to incur expense.</Q></P>
<P>WITH what a glowing pencil does our beloved WASHING∣TON here paint the sentiments and feelings of his heart? And how many patriotic breasts has this painting inspired with similar sentiments and feelings?</P>
<P>What pity is it, that such friends to the world, such pro∣tectors of the rights of men, should ever die? But what man is he that liveth &amp; shall not see death? This great man has fal∣len! His lustre as a CITIZEN, his eminence as a STATESMAN, his celebrity as a WARRIOR, were props too feeble to support him. His coat of mail, which had shielded him, for such a length of time, from the greatest dangers, was no security. He fell in all his military trappings, and with all his martial honors upon him. While Capt. of the American host, and in full possession of himself, at the first summons, he resigned his commission into the hands of death. How great is that power, to which so great a General, so readily submits!</P>
<P>WE shall retire to our dwellings impressed with the vanity of all earthly greatness. God has taken from us the judge and the prudent, the ancient and the honorable, the mighty Man, and the Man of War. How humbling to our pride is the consideration, that no circumstances or degree of greatness, are of any avail when the King of Terrors advances? The greatest general must die like men, and fall like one of the Peasants.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="037493_0013_100D464AD6643938"/>WE shall retire to our dwellings, filled with Grief, that so much greatness and goodness must submit to death. What gloom overspreads the mind, when we contemplate in dust, the illustrious citizen, who with patriotic fervour espoused the cause of mankind, emancipated his country from impend∣ing bondage, and secured the happiness of millions?</P>
<P>WE shall retire to our dwellings, inspired with sentiments of gratitude to God, for raising up and continuing to us so long, a man so extensively great and good. God is never in want of instruments to accomplish the important purposes of his providence. When the time drew near, in which this land was to be planted with civilized men, he raised up Colum∣bus, and endowed him with a spirit of enterprize, adequate to the important discoveries, which he made. When the days were accomplished, and we must emerge from under tutors &amp; governors, and assume a station among the nations of the earth, he raised up and sent us Washington, furnished in a peculiar manner for the part assigned him in this grand event. He, who raised him up, has chosen the best time for his removal. America has never seen the day, when she could have spared him so well. Age might have diminished, but nothing could have encreased the glory of his Character. He had complet∣ed his work, and it was just, that he should receive his wages. He has gloriously retired in his full strength; and neither time nor mortals have it in their power to obscure his bright∣ness. The unerring judge of men will weigh all his great actions in an even ballance, and distinguish him with suitable rewards.</P>
<P>THERE is a wonderful coincidence of character, between the LEADERS of God's ancient &amp; his American Israel. They were both peculiarly watched over and instructed in the days of youth. They were both Presidents in council and Gene∣rals in the Field. They both delivered their Brethren from bondage, and established them in Freedom and Independence. They both brought their respective nations in sight of a per∣manent seat for their public councils. A few steps more, &amp; the israelitish nation would have pitched their Government in Canaan. A few steps more, and the American nation would have pitched their Government in the City of Washington. MOSES longed for the completion of his peoples travels, and to go with them, and see them in full, possession of the good land, which was beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain and

Lebanon. WASHINGTON longed for the completion of his peo∣ple's foreign and domestic trials, and to go with them, and see their Government permanently seated in that goodly city, which is called by his own name. Both were denied the sight. And to complete the picture, both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a few hours warning, when their eyes were not dim, nor their natural force abated.</P>
<P>THE Jews wept for Moses: and we this day weep for Washington. Go with me to Mount Vernon, and behold him great even in death. With what nobleness of mind does he receive the summons to submit to the King of terrors, &amp; resign his body a prisoner to the grave? Behold this un∣equalled man, closing his mouth and eyes, with his <HI>own hands,</HI> and expiring without a <HI>sigh,</HI> or a <HI>groan</HI>!!!</P>
<Q><L>YET Vernon <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vernon</HI> is here used simply for the domestics of the General, or the inhabi∣tants of the village—as we say; the whole city is in confusion.</NOTE> <HI>sighed</HI> and when the tidings spread,</L>
<L>Thro' this vast Empire, WASHINGTON is dead!</L>
<L>The nation <HI>groan'd,</HI> the Sons of Freedom wept:</L>
<L>Columbia's Daughters mourn'd: the WARRIOR slept.</L></Q>
<P>BEHOLD an affectionate people assembled in crowds, to tes∣tify their esteem and bear his body to the burial. The man∣sion of joy was now the seat of sorrow. He who once en∣livened the scene, and brightened every object, was no longer to be found. Where is he, who once welcomed the stranger to his hall? Where is the good man, who opened his door to the traveller? They looked for him in vain. The noble frame which he once animated was found; but in mournful ruins! They viewed it. They wept! Blame them not. Hearts of marble would have wept! Had you been present your hearts would have melted within you. They viewed it, and wept again, and weeping conveyed it to the tomb!</P>
<P>LET us this day ascribe righteousness to our MARER, and reverence that Being, who liveth and reigneth, while great and good men die, and the fashion of this world is passing. HE should be the object of our hope and trust. To him we com∣mend our afflicted nation. When a WASHINGTON fails from among us, to him will we direct our eyes, to raise up other WASHINGTONS, who shall be the chariots &amp; horsemen of our land.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="037493_0015_100D464F5088C1F0"/>LET us all stand admonished, and prepare for that war in which there is no discharge. The King of Terrors is ad∣vancing. When the greatest general falls, how can the fee∣ble soldier stand? Christ Jesus is our strength: the captain of our salvation. He only can make us conquerors. He alone can put into our mouths that triumphant song: "O death where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory."</P>
