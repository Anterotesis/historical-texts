<HEAD>A SCHEME FOR A Paper Currency.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">R</SEG>EADING in some of the News-Papers, the last sitting of the Honourable Assembly of this Province, of a Peti∣tion sign'd by a great Number of the Freeholders of this Town, was presented to the Court, for Relief under their present difficult and distressing Circumstances, for want of a sufficient Medium; whereby the Trade and Business of the Town is very much decayed, Law-Suits increased, and Cash to purchase the Necessaries of Life hard to be attained, even by many of good Estates among them. It must plainly appear, to a Mathematical Demonstration, that nothing can help or relieve this Town out of its present great Difficulties and bad Circumstances, but Frugality and Industry, and pursuing just and reasonable Schemes. For any reasonable Man living to think that the Printing a few Rheams of Paper, with∣out the least Shadow of Foundation, and calling it Money, will relieve them, they are vastly mistaken, it will only lead them into a vast Labyrinth of Evils.</P>
<P>THE following Scheme will appear to a full Demonstration what vast Service it will be to this Town.</P>
<P>IT must be allowed that a Number can perform more than a few, which is just and r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asonable: For the Gentlemen in <HI>England, Holland</HI> and other Parts of the Trading World, form themselves into SOCIETIES and COMPANIES for the carry∣ing on <HI>vast</HI> Designs in Trade and Commerce. The <HI>Dutch</HI> are the only People
<PB N="2" REF="040159_0005_101630F7AED42CA8"/>
who have got Money by their first Scheme: Their Maxims are thus, when they have a Mind to bring any Manufactury into their Country, they always procure the best Workmen from that Country where that Manufactury is carried on to the utmost Perfection. Having procured Workmen, they perform to those Men their Engage∣ments and Contracts to the least Tittle: And those Workmen finding themselves justly dealt withal, they directly bring that Manufactury to as great Perfection as it is carried on in the Country they came from. And thus from these wise Maxims, which the <HI>Dutch</HI> have followed, they have brought them to that glorious Figure which they now make in the World.</P>
<P><HI>NOW to my Scheme.</HI> There is the compleatest Place for the Erecting and Build∣ing Twenty Mills on of any Place I ever saw in my Life; it is from the Warehouse of JO<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> LEWIS, Esq. near the Fortification, across to his Warehouse on <HI>Dorchester</HI> Point. I suppose, was it possible, that such a Place could be procured as near <HI>Amsterdam</HI> as this is to <HI>Boston,</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> would give <HI>One hundred Thousand Pounds</HI> Sterling for such a convenient Place.</P>
<P>OUR <HI>Mother</HI> Country will be much pleas'd with this Scheme, because not one Mill will interfere with any of the Manufactur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in <HI>Great Britain.</HI> I shall explain the great Benefit and Advantage of sundry of these Mills▪ which by the Parity of Reason will explain the test. It's plain to a Demonstration, that those Corn Mills which are erected on the Mill Pond, will in a few Years be of no Service. The Reason is▪ Be∣cause the Pond fills so fast with Filth, that there will not be sufficient Water to carry on the said Mills. And such a fine, beautiful Tract of Land will be more fit to build Streets of Houses on▪ and ten Times the Improvement than they are at present em∣ploy'd in. And these Corn Mills (to be built on the aforementioned Place) may be built to the same Advantage as they are now in <HI>England.</HI> The Corn Mills have been vastly improved in <HI>England</HI> within these Twenty Years. And those Mills being built to the same Perfection they are now built in <HI>England,</HI> they will grind more Flour by six lb. Weight out of a Bushel of Wheat, and make better Flour, than any Mill now built in <HI>America.</HI> (For all the Mills now built in <HI>America,</HI> are built in the old Form) So that the Merchants of <HI>Boston</HI> may purchase Wheat from the Wheat Countries, and supply the <HI>West-Indies</HI> Cheaper than either <HI>New-York</HI> or <HI>Philadelphia.</HI> For the Tenth of these Fac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I appeal to the Millers and Bakers of <HI>Boston.</HI> A Number of Saw-Mills for the Ship Builders and Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers, they will be able to de∣monstrate Leather Mills, the Gentlemen Leather-Sellers will be able to inform. L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Oil Mills, the Consumers of Oil will able to inform. There being vast Quantities of Iron B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g Ore at the Eastward. Mills to run into P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ggs for <HI>Great-Britain.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mills for grinding Tanners Bark, both for home Consumption and <HI>Ireland,</HI> se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eral Gentlemen will be able to inform. A Number of Logwood Mills, a Num∣ber of Merchants will be able to inform: And so by a Party of Reason all the rest of the Mills are explained. The Place lies entirely on Water Carriage, and has a constant Supply of Water all the Summer, which is the only Time to perform Busi∣ness. It has already been justly Surveyed, and a Plan taken. And was a Number of Gentlemen to be incorporated by the General Assembly, they might bring this Scheme to Perfection immediately, to the vast Service of this Town and Province in general. I can with Modesty say, this is the best Scheme that ever was on the
<PB N="3" REF="040159_0006_101630FA2DB89ED0"/>
Tapis since the Colony has been settled. It is not like the Uncertainty of the Min<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Adventurers, but as soon as these Mills are built they will produce a certain Profit, as sure as the Sun that moves. The Corn Mills at <HI>Bow</HI> near <HI>London,</HI> with twelve Pair of Stones, are let at <HI>Nine hundred Pounds</HI> Sterling a Year, and I will Mathe∣matically prove, that twelve Pair of Stones built on the abovementioned Place will produce as much Profit as the Mills at <HI>Bow.</HI> And such a fine Scituation for Mills can∣not be better in any Place in the World. There is now an absolute Necessity for coming into a just Scheme in order to have Money pass for a Supply of our com∣mon Necessities, till such time as by our Frugality and Dent of Industry we bring Silver and Gold to pass as a proper Medium; which was the real Design of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Majesty's Royal Instruction not to make any more Paper Bills, which is absolutely a common Cheat, let them be made in any Form or Shape whatever, without a solid Foundation to support their Value. Was a Number of Gentlemen to be in∣corporated, and the whole Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y liable to be sued as one Man, their Notes of Hand would pass better th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n any Money to be made by the Province, because the Pro∣fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ising by the Mills would be a solid Foundation. I shall only mention one Company in <HI>London,</HI> that is the <HI>New River</HI> Company, which pays them Twenty <HI>per Cent</HI> interest; then, would not the Notes of such a Company pass equal with Bank Notes, or Gold or Silver. I will Mathematically demonstrate to any Man living, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at these Mills will produce Twenty <HI>per Cent.</HI> then consequently their Notes must pass equal to Silver and Gold. All Mechanicks are now brought to be proved by mathematical Demonstrations, so that it is impossible to err in building these Mills, for it may be computed to a single Farthing what each Mill will cost. And these Mills <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng built according to the Mathematicks, then it may be easily demonstra∣ted what each Mill will produce yearly, so that the Company may proceed like wise Master-Builders. And when the above Mills are brought to Perfection, a vast Number of great Schemes may be laid before the Company, which they will natu∣rally come into: For we have a common Proverb, <HI>Mathematical Demonstrations can a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> And it would certainly be for the interest of <HI>New-England</HI> not to make one Paper Bill m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re: The Reason is, The Notes of Head made by the Company will answer the Ends and Purposes of purchasing all the Necessaries of Life▪ and these Notes not being made a Tender in Law, it would absolutely oblige the Merchants to bring Gold and Silver to answer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Specialties, or else it would be impossible for them to carry on Trade and Merchandi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e. For so long as the Assembly continues to make Paper Bills the whole Publick will depend on them. Each Gentlemen will flatter himself he shall be able to procure as many Bills as will answer all his Designs. But any Man that knows the just State of the Pro∣vince must allow that according to its present Scituation it requires a Million ready Specie to carry on the Trade of the Province: It is therefore a meer jest to make a few Paper Bills, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>king that will answer the End, it will only embarrass and entirely Ruin hundreds of Families, and bring on Law-Suits almost numberless. It must be allow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d that a Merchant managed his Affairs with Prudence and Caution, when he has brought his Trading to such a Point that his Profits may be large, and his Loss not considerable. But should a Man of Traffick put <HI>Twenty thousand Pounds</HI> on board a leaky Vessel, and send it to the <HI>Spanish West-Indies,</HI> through as many Dangers as there are Shelves in the Sea, or Points in the Compass, with the
<PB N="4" REF="040159_0007_101630FBB79B5A00"/>
bare Hopes of gaining <HI>Six Peace,</HI> would not all Mankind post up such a Merchant for a mad Man: I leave the Application.</P>
<P>THIS Body Politick may be justly compared to a Merchant beginning the World with <HI>One hundred Thousand Pounds,</HI> and directly advanceth to a Trade that requires <HI>One Million</HI> ready Specie. Notwithstanding the Merchant has an exceeding good Character in all Parts of the trading World, and his Credit supported a vast many Years with a fair Shew, yet in the End it will be the intire Ruin, not only of him∣self, but of vast Numbers of other Men. The Reason is, it is plain that for want of a sufficient Sum to carry on his Trade, he is often obliged to part with his Goods for less than Prime Cost, besides making use of Userers and griping Extortioners, which will always Prey on him like so many Vultures or Horseleach's: And the poor honest Gentleman, so far from growing Rich for the Reward of his great Pains and Industry, not only sinks his own private Patrimony of <HI>One hundred thousand Pounds,</HI> but a great many Hundreds besides. His Character is entirely ruin'd in all Parts of the Trading World, and his End may be in Ruin and Want And his Sub∣stance, with other honest Gentlemen's, who consign'd to him, got into the Hands of base unworthy Knaves, who have watched all Opportunities to take Advantage of the poor Gentleman's Necessity.</P>
<P>HIS Excellency <HI>JONATHAN BELCHER,</HI> Esq▪ our Governor, hath twice recommended to the General Assembly the employing a Number of Men to take an exact Survey of this Province, and the Extent of its Bounds. For this Province is hardly known by our Mother Country. And I can with humble Modesty observe, that the State of this Province was never yet fairly stated.</P>
<P>OUR Mother Country never was so full of Men and Money <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce the glorious House of HANOVER came to reign over us. And was a just Plan to be taken of this Province, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid before the Nobility. Gentry and substantial Farmers in <HI>England,</HI> the young Branches will bring their Fortunes into <HI>New-England</HI> and purcha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Lands. For it may be Mathematically demonstrated, for a Gentleman to bring to <HI>New-England Five thousand Pounds</HI> Sterling, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay it out in Lands, it would in twenty Year time be worth <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty thousand Pounds</HI> Sterling, if they are improved after the same Man∣ner they are in <HI>England.</HI> For the Lands there are prodigiously improved within these Twenty Years past: For a vast Quantity of Land was then Let for <HI>Eighteen Pence per</HI> Acre, which are now Let for <HI>Twenty Shillings per</HI> Acre. And I will demonstrate to any Man living, that the Lands in <HI>New-England</HI> are as good as they are in <HI>Old.</HI></P>
<P>AS I am obliged to go to <HI>England</HI> with all my Law Suits, for want of a Court of Equity in the Country: And being forc'd to stay some Time there before: can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my Affairs to a final <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.

And I further observe, these young Branches of our Nob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lity, Gentry and substantial Farmer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bringing large Substance, would be able to proc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re all Sorts of Naval Stores for <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and entirely prevent the <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> Trade.

<P>And I verily think that the Opinion of the ingenious Dr. <HI>Mather</HI> will certainly come to pass: For the Doctor in his Letter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o one <HI>Anthony William <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leme,</HI> late Chaplain to his Royal Highness GEORGE when Prince of <HI>Denmark</HI>: The Contents of which Letter was this, That Dr. <HI>Mather</HI> had remitted so much Money by Bills of Exchange (collected from private Gentlemen in <HI>New-England</HI>) for the Propa∣gation of the <HI>GOSPEL</HI> in <HI>Malla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> in the <HI>East Indies</HI>: The Money was to be sent to Professor <HI>Fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s</HI> at <HI>Hall</HI> in <HI>Saxony.</HI> After Dr. <HI>Mather</HI> had given a beautiful Description of Church Affairs, he concludes his Letter with political Affairs, and gives a fine Account of this Part of the World, and hear∣tily lamenting the Misfortune of the <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Expedition, (but wholly lays the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lame on the <HI>Old-England</HI> Men) for he declares, That no Men on the Earth could proceed with more Courage and Resolution than the <HI>New-England</HI> Men: But the Dr concludes with this noble Saying▪ That I really and verily think, that in less than fifty Years, the glorious House of HANOVER will be Emperors of all <HI>America,</HI> and then it will the greatest Empire in the whole World. Now to any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>king Man, the Doctor's Thoughts will certainly come to pass▪ For we see what a glorious Settlement is carrying on at <HI>Georgia,</HI> and how the English Nation are spirited to support that Province. And it is not in the least to be doubted but by proper Application to his Royal Majesty and Parliament, they would come into any Measures to make the Frontiers of this Province a strong Barrier against <HI>Canada</HI>; and then if the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> dare to go to War with <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> so certain we shall take <HI>Canada</HI> and the <HI>Spanish West-Indies</HI> which will put a final End to all the Villanies committed on us by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and there is no true <HI>Englishmen</HI> but hopes and wishes to see that Day.</P>
<P>The worthy ingenious Capt. <HI>Plais<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed</HI> informed me he had received a Letter from Mr. <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s Hooper,</HI> Merchant in <HI>London,</HI> dated <HI>October</HI> 8, 1738▪ wherein he informs him▪ That the <HI>Pot-Ash</HI> remitted from <HI>New England</HI> to him, was allowed to be as good as that Pot-Ash which comes from <HI>Russia.</HI> It appeared by our Book of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, there was upwards of Two Thousand Tuns imported from the Northern Kingdom in one Year: And Pot-Ash being worth <HI>Thirty Pounds</HI> per Ton, (the said 100 Tons at 30 <HI>l</HI> per Ton, amounts to <HI>Sixty Thousand Pounds</HI>) And as the Pot-Ash pays to his Majesty <HI>Six Pounds</HI> per Ton Duty; I do not doubt in the least for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncouragement of this Manufactury in these Parts, by properly applying to

the Parliament for the Drawback to be taken off, it would be done, and a Royal Bounty granted: And the Gentlemen of this Province coming to a just Way of thinking, they might flow in Riches as they please. And these Gentlemen or Society that are concerned in the aforementioned Mills, might directly bring this Scheme of the Pot-Ash to Perfection; and what glorious Farms would be produced from this Scheme of Pot-Ash?</P>
<P>I had almost forgot to mention one more great Benefit to this great Town of <HI>Boston</HI> in the building these Mills, which all Mankind must allow to be just; that is thus, Suppose it should happen a War, by having such a fine Communication with the Castle, we might soon supply that Fortress with Ten Thousand brave Fellows that would face any Enemy on the whole Earth. And by this Scheme the great Town of <HI>Boston</HI> may be made impregnable. We may see to what a glorious Spirit the English Nation are arrived to, in improving every Thing that's possible to be done for the Good of the Publick; witness the advancing 700,000 <HI>l.</HI> towards building a Bridge from <HI>Westminster</HI> across to <HI>Lambeth</HI>; and there is no Gentlemen, that are thinking Men, but knows the Profits arising by Tole of the said Bridge will not bring in more than Two per Cent Interest; but they all know it's for the Good of their Country, therefore they see it necessary it should be done notwithstanding the Insufficiency of the Premium for such a vast Undertaking. Therefore as the aforementioned Mills can be mathematically proved, to produce Twenty per Cent. it will be look'd upon in <HI>England,</HI> if it is not done, that the Gentlemen of this Country do not consult their own Interest and the general Good the whole Country will reap therefrom. And for any Person or Persons to send Home any dismal Complaint of the State of the Province, it will be look'd upon as only noisy Faction and Clamour.</P>
<P>I have been always suprized to think what vast Improvements have been performed by the Gentlemen of this Province in one Century. But now, provided our young Nobility, Gentry and Farmers come over, with their Pockets full of Money, what vast Improvements may be expected in the next Century.</P>
<P>I don't in the least doubt but these fifteen Colonies will arrive to as great a Pitch of Glory as those fifteen Provinces of <HI>China.</HI> And as Sir WILLIAM TEMPLE ob∣serveth, it must be allowed to be the greatest, richest and most populous Kingdom now known in the World; and will be found perhaps to owe its Riches, Force, Civility and Felicity to the admirable Constitution of its Government, more than any other. The Empire consists of fifteen several Kingdoms, which are govern'd by Vice-Roys, who yet live in Greatness, Splendor and Riches, equal to great and sovereign Kings. In the whole Kingdom there are 145 Capital Cities, of mighty Extent and magnificent Buildings; and 1321 lesser Cities, but all walled round; the Number of Villages is infinite: And no Country in the known World is so full of Inhabitants, nor so improved by Agriculture and Manufacturies, by infinite Growth of numerous Commodies, by Canals of incredible Length, Conjunction of Rivers, by Convenience of Ways for the Transportation of all Sorts of Goods from one Province to another; so as no Country has so great a Trade.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="040159_0011_1016310A4F8E6048"/>THERE is a vulgar Error, to the vast Damage of this Province, that the <HI>New-England</HI> Oak is far inferiour to the Oak in <HI>Old England</HI>; and the Error has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o long prevailed that it's now really allowed by all Sorts of People to be Fact: And the only Reason I find to Support this Opinion is, that the Ships built in <HI>New-England</HI> will not last so long as those built in <HI>Old</HI>: I grant what they say. Those Ships that have been hitherto built, are not so good as those built in <HI>England.</HI> The Reason is plain to a Demonstration why they are not so good▪ The People that procure the Timber cut it down in Season and out of Season, for they are obliged to cut it as fast as they cut it.

For in the present Age, no Man that has or really pretends to have the least Shadow or Foundation of common Reason, will by any Means be Hoodwink'd, but shew him mathematical Demonstration and he will come into your Scheme directly, so that any Man that Grounds his Hypothesis on solid Truth will certainly gain his Scheme.</P>
<P>I humbly make bold to make use of an Observation of a worthy, learned Gentle∣man, who is look'd upon by all Men in the Province to be a Gentleman of solid Knowledge and Learning, he lately wrote an Essay concerning Silver and Paper Currencies; and it is allowed to be comple<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly done: He observeth thus on a private Bank.

<P>YOU plainly see what a just Sense of the Merits of this Gentleman his Royal Majesty conceived. And I must humbly observe to the Gentlemen of this most noble Province, that they could not express their just Value and Esteem for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> great Deliverer, our late most august and glorious King WILLIAM, than by erecting to his Memory his Majesty's Statue on Horseback, erected on a Pedestal, and placed before the Town House facing <HI>King Street</HI>: And there is not one Man in the Province, that is a Lover of Liberty and Property, but what will contribute towards such a noble Undertaking▪ The Gentlemen of <HI>Ireland</HI> have, notwithstanding the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Monument in the City of <HI>Dublin,</HI> erected soon after, and in Memory of his Majesty's glorious Act<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, further to perpetuate the same, erected another of glorious Structure in the great River of <HI>Beyn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> where the chief Scene of their Deliverance was, by the Almighty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Majesty's Arms, fully compleated.

Labour and Pains in serving this most noble Province. Mankind nothing more imitates almighty God, than by rewarding those that lay out their Powers and Faculties in ser∣ving Mankind, This <HI>Coasting Pilot</HI> gives me a just Idea of the Coast of his Majesty's Provinces from <HI>New-York</HI> to the Bay of <HI>Funday.</HI> The very Islands are able to contain Millions of People; which absolutely destroys that vile selfish Principle of some People which say they are not for Strangers coming amongst them, because they shall not have Land enough for their Children; which is really a childish Story.</P>
<P>UPON moderate Computation the Gentlemen Farmers have borrowed on Bond and Mortgages upwards of <HI>Five hundred thousand Pounds</HI>; of which the greatest Part is let at 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> And according to the present Scituation of Affairs, it is impossible for those Gentlemen to pay off their Securities: So that a Gentleman that has Mortgaged his Form for 500 <HI>l.</HI> that is worth 2000, his Farm on Prosecution is certainly forfeited for want of the 500 <HI>l.</HI> And its impossible it should be otherwise whilst the griping Usurers Monopolizes into their own Coffers, the Bulk of that small Quantity of running Specie that is now Extant amongst us. And as the old saying is, The just Value of any Commodity whatever, is what it will fetch. The only Remedy to avoid this great Evil, is for the Assembly of this Province, as I observed before, to lay just Schemes, to perswade and allure our young Nobility, Gentry and Farmers to come and settle among us▪, and it's not to be doubted, but these Gentlemen would purchase the Farms of those Gentlemen that have involved themselves, and are now in a State of Bondage; and they may put Money sufficient in their Pockets to proceed on the Settlement of new Farms on the out Lands, with Resolution and Vigour. And in a few Years, by com∣mon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndustry, they will have as good Farms as they at first parted with, and an entire Freedom from the grand Oppression they then labour'd under. And upon the Arri∣val of a Number of our young Nobility and Farmers, with a Quantity of Money, it would make it a Year of Jubilee for all those Gentlemen that now labour under the present grand Oppressions. For all Gentlemen well knows what a vast Number of Farms must be put to Sale in few Years▪ And no Purchasers can appear to buy of these Country People The Reason is, because they will not have Money to pay for them. And further, I observe to the Gentlemen Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pkeepers not to purchase large Quantities of English Goods, for some time, till the Ballance of Trade is brought to a more fix Standard, for it may be mathematically proved, that as certain as any Man buys large Quantities of Goods, so certain he will be ruined: For as some Gentlemen have lately got Estates by the prodigious Rise of Goods, so certainly some Men will be ruined by their great Fall▪ which will come to pass, as sure as the Sun that moves.</P>
<P>I must observe, by way of Comfort, to the Gentlemen that labour at present un∣der great Oppressions, that we have a common saying. <HI>A desperate Disease must have a desperate Cure</HI>; but if more pacifick Measures can be found out, it will be vastly more pleasing to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Body Politick. For as Harmony and sincere Love are the just Foundation of all Happiness both in this World and the World to come, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> General Assembly are the proper Physicians, it is not in the least doubted but they will make a sound Cure of this Body Politick, and lay a solid Foundation of Happiness for the rising Generations. And what more noble and grand than to lay great Designs for future Ages to copy after▪ which will be lasting Monuments of Pra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to our great Assembly.</P>
