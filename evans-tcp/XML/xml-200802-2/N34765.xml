<HEAD>To the READER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE following Discourse was preached at the opening of a new school-house, at the request of the proprietors, without the least suspicion that one would propose its publication. And when I heard that some persons were desirous it should be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ted, I was much averse to it, supposing it to be inconsiderable a performance to be made any more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lick than by preaching it where it was delivered. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> being informed there was a large number, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>efond of having it in their own possession, I gave up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> own judgment in the matter, and conceded to their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uest, being willing to hope it might, by the divine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ssing, to which I would humbly commit it, be of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther use to those who heard it, and perhaps to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e others into whose hands it may fall. The subject <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>confessedly important, but too copious to be fully <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ated in so short a discourse as this is. But if even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>at is here offered to the publick should be a means further encouraging the well-disposed to go for∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rd, in aiming to establish and maintain good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ools here, or elsewhere, and of exciting others to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>end to the right education of their children, it will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> publick benefit, and a comfort to all who wish <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll to the rising generation.

<Q><HI>Train up a Child in the Way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE right education of children is a matter of great importance, and has been viewed in this light by wise men in all generations. No creatures come into the world in a more needy and helpless condition, as to the body, than mankind; being naked and feeble, they re∣quire much care and nursing before they are able to help themselves: and they equally stand in need of assistance as to their minds, which are void of knowledge and wisdom, and (which renders their condition more piteous) naturally inclined to im∣bibe error rather than truth, and to prefer the paths of vanity, folly and sin to the ways of virtue, wis∣dom and religion. It is written, Job xi. 12. "Man is born like the wild ass's colt," which is a lively similitude of ignorant and depraved mankind, for
<PB N="6" REF="045482_0004_101FFED0638379F8"/>
an ass is a silly, ignorant creature, even to a pro∣verb: and a wild ass has something in him where∣by he more fully resembles fallen man; this crea∣ture is noted in scripture for wantonness, Jer. ii. 23. and also for stubbornness and an ungovernable disposition. Job xxxix. 5. "Who hath sent out the wild ass free, or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass? whose house I have made the wil∣derness, and the barren land his dwellings. He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regard∣eth he the crying of the driver." <Q>The horse must travel and the ox draw the plough; the one has a bit put into his mouth, and the other is under a yoke: but a wild ass is a stranger to discipline, and likes not to hear of any master but himself, or to be a servant to any but his own will. Such is the nature of man, he loves to be free, or ra∣ther to be dissolute. He cannot endure to be subdued to order; he would know no law but his own lust, nor rule but his own desire. He is so much for sinful liberty, he cares not for true liberty. The liberty he seeks makes him a bond-slave to corruption.</Q> Thus man is born like the wild ass's colt, ignorant, wanton and licen∣tious. And as he is thus born, so, without right education, he is in danger of growing up wild, rude, and destitute of profitable knowledge and true wisdom. As uncultivated land brings forth briars and thorns, so, in untutored and uninstructed minds, odious and hurtful lusts grow up, nume∣rous and strong, which, in their operation, render the subjects themselves unhappy, and often disquiet all around them, or with whom they are concern∣ed,
<PB N="7" REF="045482_0005_101FFED2C8FA7640"/>
Those who have had no good education are liable to become the slaves of every lawless appe∣tite and passion, to be led astray by every tempta∣tion to evil, to take wrong methods to procure the supports of the present life, and to walk in the broad road which leads to ruin hereafter. And hence appears the importance of right education, with respect to the interest of children themselves, that they may be preserved from such evils as have been mentioned, and be led in the way which leads to virtue and wisdom, peace and comfort here, and to glory, honour and immortality here∣after. It is of importance also with respect to civil society, that this may be supported, and the bene∣fits and blessings which result from thence enjoy∣ed. It is of importance with respect to the church of Christ, that this may be preserved on earth, and true religion maintained in the world. In a word, the interest not only of the present, but of future generations, is deeply concerned in this matter. It has therefore been justly accounted a wise act in parents and others to pay a particular attention hereunto, and to spare no suitable pains and cost in having the rising generation well instructed.</P>
<P>To this end we have the injunction in the text, from a wise king, under the influence of divine in∣spiration, to "train up a child in the way he should go;" which implies, that there is a wrong way, in which children ought not to go, and for prevent∣ing of which, right education is necessary, and also a right way, in which they ought to walk, and to which a good education must point and introduce them; and for our encouragement to the practice
<PB N="8" REF="045482_0006_101FFED671CE03E8"/>
of this duty, it is said, "when he is old he will not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>epart from it."</P>
<P>It may be objected here, that sometimes we see <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ose, who have been favoured with the best educa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion, miserably apostatizing from it, and exhibiting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> melancholy proof that all the cost and pains that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave been bestowed upon them has been to no good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urpose. How then does it appear, that such as have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad a good education, when they come to maturi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, will act or conduct themselves agreeably? To <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is it may be answered, (1.) "That this is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> most likely means of bringing persons to walk <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in right ways, or conduct themselves in a right <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> manner, that they were taught so to do from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their childhood and youth." Though it be but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> means, yet it is a means well adapted to the end, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd that which is often, or most commonly, suc∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ssful to answer this end. Mankind often walk <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> after life, outwardly at least, according as their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ducation has been: yea, we may say that a good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ducation has been blest and sanctified as a means <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> saving conversion unto God; though it is not a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eans that can of itself reach this high end, yet it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as been often sanctified to promote it. The in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ructions received in youth often abide with persons <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> after life: and if good knowledge and sound <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isdom enter the minds of those who are young, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ey will not be effaced or eradicated afterwards. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>2.) When children are rightly instructed and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ained up, they will not easily and ordinarily de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>art from such an education." They will find <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore difficulties than others do, in breaking over <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e rules of virtue and religion, and of walking in
<PB N="9" REF="045482_0007_101FFED8EB250370"/>
the paths of vanity and folly. They have not only the light of conscience, but the light of education, to conflict with; and many a struggle they must have in their own minds, and many upbraidings of conscience, before they can easily go contrary to all the wise instructions that have been given them, and addict themselves to vicious courses. (3.) If they do depart for awhile, there is great hope that they will see their error, and be reclaim∣ed. Even the great and wise King Solomon, the author of this book of Proverbs, turned aside, for a time, from the right way, but was brought to true repentance and reformation, as is evident from the book of Ecclesiastes, which, it is highly pro∣bable, he wrote in his old age, and which contains a publick testimony of his repentance and abhor∣rence of all those sinful courses to which he had been addicted. So that when it is said in the text, that those who are trained up in the way wherein they should go, will not depart from it in after years, we may understand, that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill not easily and ordinarily depart from it, or if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ey do so for a time, yet that there is great reason to hope they will be happily recovered. There are no general rules without exceptions; and though upon some, all care and pains prove but lost labour, yet, as to many others, it is otherwise. And if the labour is lost as to the youth themselves, yet those, to whose care and instruction they have been committed, will have the satisfaction of having discharged their duty, though they have not attained the end they desired.</P>
<P>If it be inquired, wherein does a right educa∣tion
<PB N="10" REF="045482_0008_101FFEDA7475A830"/>
consist, or how we must conduct to afford <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ch an one to children? it may be answered, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> few things comprise the whole, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> suitable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>structions, good examples, and a wise discipline <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> good government; all being attended with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ayer for the divine blessing, to render them effect∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l to the great end proposed. It is observed, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> original word, translated <HI>child,</HI> is used with great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>titude in scripture, and runs through all the dates <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> infancy, childhood and youth. And the word <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndered <HI>train up,</HI> signifies to dedicate, initiate, in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uct, and set in order.</P>
<P>Instruction, therefore, in the necessary parts of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>man learning, and whatever else is likely to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eful and beneficial to the persons taught, is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>incipal part of a good education. These instruc∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ns should be suited to the age, capacities and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er circumstances of children. They should be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmunicated with judgment, as to time, and as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the quantity at any one time. The learners <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ould be led on from those things that are more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ple and plain, to those which are more difficult <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d abstruse. These instructions should be repeat∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> from time to time, with a patient, persevering <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rit, as the children or youth are able to receive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>em. They should consist both of matters of art <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> science, and also things of a moral and religious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ture, that children and youth may obtain the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eful parts of human learning, and come to know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at is just and right, what is decent, lovely and good report, that they may embrace and prac∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> these things: and also understand and per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve what is evil, sinful and base, that they may
<PB N="11" REF="045482_0009_101FFEDD23248948"/>
abhor and avoid it. And further, still, that, by the divine blessing, they may be induced to re∣member their Creator in the days of their youth, and fear the Lord betimes.</P>
<P>Good examples must accompany and follow good instructions, or the latter, so far as relates to moral conduct, are not likely to be very beneficial. Nak∣ed precepts, as to civil, moral or religious conduct, where there is no suitable example attending, are commonly heard with indifference, and but poorly observed. Examples carry strong conviction to the mind, and make deep impressions on the heart; these, therefore, should always accompany pre∣cepts, as a means to persuade to a compliance, or enforce an observation. They, therefore, who are instructors of children, but careless whether they exhibit any good examples of moral or religious behaviour before them, ought not to wonder if they see the greatest inattention and disregard paid to the most solemn injunctions; while the instructor who practises agreeable to the rules he gives unto his scholars, will convince their judgments, win their affections, and persuade them to imitation.</P>
<P>A wise discipline or government must be inter∣mixed with instructions and examples. This is absolutely necessary in families and schools, for maintaining good order, correcting the disobedi∣ent, restraining and overawing the viciously in∣clined, and encouraging the well disposed. Where there is no rule or right government, disorder, confusion and every evil work will soon take place; the progress of learning is impeded, and no great good is to be expected. Government of children
<PB N="12" REF="045482_0010_101FFEE0721B4540"/>
and youth should be managed with care, concern <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd judgment, with steadiness and lenity, firmness and impartiality. All milder methods should be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ken with children before chastisements or corpo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l punishments are administered. But when no other means will answer, these must not be with∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ld: and whenever the case calls for the disagree∣able task, the instructor and governour should en∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>avour to convince the child of the necessity of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ch correction, and that he does it not to gra∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y any passion or resentment of his own, but in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve and faithfulness to him and others. These <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nishments should be adapted to the nature of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imes, and be greater or less, in proportion to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>grees of criminality, and the age and other cir∣cumstances of the offenders, and be always free <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>om every species of cruelty or unjust severity.</P>
<P>These several parts of education should be ac∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mpanied by servent prayer to the God of all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ace, for his blessing, to succeed and render effect∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l our endeavours. We should always maintain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> humble sense of our need of the divine blessing, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> prosper all our lawful undertakings, and parti∣cularly to render the means of education effectual, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> communicating useful knowledge and true wis∣dom, to those we are aiming to train up in the way therein they should walk. Under this apprehen∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n, instructors and governours of children ought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be daily committing their charge to the divine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e and benediction. They should pray with and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them, every day, that God would shew them fa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ur, and give them knowledge and understand∣ing, and sanctify them to himself, keep them from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and bless them in all respects.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="045482_0011_101FFEE1FB3DE4C0"/>
This matter of a good education s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ems to be di∣vided between parents or guardians, and those who preside and instruct in schools and other seminaries of learning. Parents and guardians should endea∣vour to afford to their children, and those under their care, all the useful instruction they can; they should direct, restrain and govern them in a right manner, set good examples before them, and so do all in their power to train them up in a right man∣ner. If parents, who are able to do it, neglect all instruction of their children, and will not be pre∣vailed with to govern them according to the rules of right reason and religion: if they are so far from setting good examples, that they exhibit evil ones before them, such as using profane language, teach∣ing their children, by example, to be disrespect∣ful and impudent to superiors, injurious and op∣pressive to equals and inferiors, and careless and negligent with respect to the fear and worship of God; as they do the greatest injury to their child∣ren, so they impose an hard task upon a school∣master to instruct and govern them aright, and cannot expect they should reap any great advantage from school instruction. Some parents expect too much from a school-master, both as to instruction and government. As to instruction, they some∣times suppose their children may learn so far in such a space of time, when it is beyond their capaci∣ties or powers to attain thus far within that space. Or they may expect that a master should bestow more time and pains upon a single scholar than it is in his power to afford, considering the numbers he has under his care, all which are to be attended to
<PB N="14" REF="045482_0012_101FFEE464D2E910"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their turn: and many times parents are displeased <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith masters without reason, because their children <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not come up to their expectations in learning, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ough the master uses his utmost endeavours to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing them forward. And the same thing may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>served with respect to government, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me parents expect more from a master than they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght to, with regard to government, while they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ould have him to govern his scholars, not only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en they are under his inspection, but at all other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, so as to call them to account for all misde∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anors committed abroad, or at home, as well as school. But this matter of governing at home <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s not so properly belong to the master as to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ents, who, if they would have their children <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll taught and governed at school, should endea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r to perform their part of these duties at home, the utmost of their power. Parents must not forward to receive complaints from children <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st the master, nor talk disrespectfully of him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore them, but endeavour to aid him in his in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ctions, and to render the just exercise of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hority easy to him and beneficial to them, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they would hope to see their children well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cated.

<P>A person who undertakes the employment of keeping school ought to be competent to the busi∣ness in which he engages. A grammar school∣master should be capable not only of teaching other things, but also the Latin and Greek languages, that if any one has a desire that his child should be initiated in the knowledge of these tongues, he may have an opportunity for it in the place where he resides. But all school-masters should have a good understanding of the English Language, and be able to teach English Grammar, right spelling and pronunciation, according to the most approved standards. They ought to be able to teach Wri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ing in a fair and elegant manner; and also Arith∣metick, or the science of numbers, in its most use∣ful branches.

to falsehood, and other vices. Yea, if any can∣didate for this employment manifests an open con∣tempt of religion, and the worship of God, he is not to be put therein, though he may be capable on other accounts. A school-master should be virtuous and prudent; he should be possessed of a good spirit of government, and know how to render himself both beloved and revered by his scholars. He should be one who will condescend to little children, and endeavour to find out the best me∣thods of instilling knowledge into them, and of leading them on to an acquaintance with the most useful things. He should not put on a for∣midable aspect before young children, left he so intimidate and discompose their tender minds as utterly to disqualify them from attending to learn∣ing, and, it may be, fix lasting prejudices against it. A winning, alluring method is best. He should be patient to bear with the dulness of some scholars, and be disposed to take all suitable pains with them. A man of an hasty spirit and violent passions is not so suitable, as one of a more sedate and dispassionate constitution. A man whose air, mien and language savour of an haughty, scornful disposition, is not to be chosen; but rather such an one as is meek and affable, kind and benevo∣lent, though firm and steady, at the same time, in supporting his authority, and doing whatever is necessary in his station.</P>

to their capacity, age, and the particular parts of learning in which they are employed.</P>
<P>Thus have I endeavoured to give some outlines of a good education of children, both at home and at school. Let us now, by way of improvement, make some reflections on what has been offered.</P>
<P N="1">1. Hence we may see, that parents and others are well employed, when they are doing what is in their power, that their children, and others under their care, may be well instructed, that, if their lives are spared, they may fear the Lord, and be useful members of society in thier generation; and if they are taken away while young, that they may be blessed hereafter. If any think the time and necessary expense bestowed this way is to little or no purpose, it is because they do not rightly con∣sider the benefits of a good education. Certainly it is to the commendation and praise of any peo∣ple, when they are careful to institute and support good schools, at suitable distances from each other, for the instruction and right education of children. In this respect, perhaps the endeavours of the in∣habitants of this town are equal, according to their numbers and ability, to those of any other people in these parts. We have a number of school-houses, in different parts of the town, which are some∣times all at once in use. We are now worshipping in a new and elegant one, erected for the same no∣ble purpose. Our wishes, with respect to this edifice, and every other appropriated to this use, are, that they may always be supplied with suitable instructors, and that the most useful learning may

<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> We may see that the office of a school-master <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>onourable, and the employment most benefi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>. As some of the best authors have conde∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ded to write many things for the instruction of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dren, so others, who have been persons of good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ning and wisdom, have willingly spent their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, or great part of them, in keeping schools of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ral kinds; and those who have been instructed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem, have esteemed them among their great∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enefactors. Certainly it is an useful and hon∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>able employment, to open the tender mind to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> rays of truth, and to bring those, who are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng, into a capacity of obtaining knowledge, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eing useful in their day; to instill the max∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of wisdom and prudence into young minds, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> form them to virtue and religion. Those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are capable and faithful in this business, merit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> esteem and respect, and should be suitably <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arded.</P>

<P>To parents. Be exhorted, in every point, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o your part, that your children may be well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cated.

prayer and praise be offered up in your houses, and implore the divine blessing on your housholds continually. While you are laudably employed in the institution and support of schools, be not remiss in aiding and forwarding a school education, by all those means which are in your power. Depend not entirely upon the master; but let your endea∣vours precede, accompany and follow his, that your children may reap the greatest profit and ad∣vantage. Be anxious for them, that they may ob∣tain useful knowledge, and become virtuous and soberminded.</P>
<P>Let it be the matter of your constant prayer, that they may know the true God, and Jesus Christ, whom he hath sent, which is life eternal. And also, that they may be endowed with prudence and discretion, humanity and benevolence, integ∣rity and truth, which may lay a foundation for their becoming blessings hereafter, in the church and commonwealth: That they may rejoice your hearts, by their suitable deportment and behaviour in the world; and that you may have good hopes concerning them, as to future happiness and glory. The author of this book says, (chap. xxiii. 15.) "My son, if thine heart be wife, my heart shall rejoice, even mine; yea, my reins shall rejoice when thy lips speak right things." That you may possess this joy, you should use those means with diligence which are most suited to attain it.</P>
<P N="2">2. To children. You see what pains, care and expense your parents are at, that you may be taught and instructed in a right manner, while you are young. Let it be your desire and endeavour,

Be in love with learning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd your books. Attend to the instructions that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> given you. Respect and obey your instructors, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> all their lawful requirements. Be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mulous to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xcel in every thing that merits commendation and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aise. Be a credit to your families, and to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hools to which you respectively belong. Above <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> things, fear your Maker while young, obtain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> saving acquaintance with the Redeemer, and de∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te yourselves to God in Christ Jesus, to be his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rever. Avoid all profane, lewd and vicious com∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>any. Imitate the best examples. Be modest and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umble, respectful and civil. Always be aiming <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther to get good, or do good: and may the Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur God, in whose favour there is life, give you an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>terest in his gracious covenant, and make you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>artakers of all its blessings: may he enrich your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inds with the most valuable knowledge, and qua∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y you for usefulness in your generation: may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> render you blessings on earth, and make you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ever happy hereafter.</P>
<P>To conclude: Let us all be concerned to know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he way wherein we should walk, so as to please <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od, and serve him in our generation, according <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his will. This is no other than the way of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith in Jesus Christ, and new obedience.

general course they live to the glory of God; and as their fruit is now unto holiness, so their end will be everlasting life. May the God of all grace fend forth his light and truth into all our minds, shew us his glory in the face of Jesus Christ, and incline our hearts to come to him for life, and dis∣pose us to obey him in all things. May he enrich us with that wisdom which is from above, and enable us to serve him in this world, and make us meet for the mansions of bliss, and finally receive us there, to be with him in glory: To whom, through Jesus Christ, be everlasting praises.</P>
