<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IT has always been my opinion, that a person of genius, who dedi∣cates superior talents to the in∣struction of young people, d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>serves the highest applause and the most enthusiastic admiration. To write with a constant attention to the li∣mitted understanding or informa∣tion of children; to restrain a lively imagination, and employ a mind capable of the most brilliant pur∣suits o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> subjects of a puerile kind, seems to be a sort of heroic sacri∣fice</HI>
<PB N="iv" REF="047559_0003_1023C4025CA19AE8"/>
<HI>of gratification to virtue, which I cannot doubt is acceptable to the Supreme Being.</HI></P>
<P><HI>We have, in the present age, many striking examples of this kind. The names of Barbauld and Genlis will be sufficient to prove this, al∣though with them many others might undoubtedly claim that im∣mortal honour, which the union of genius with virtue ought always to bestow.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To rank with such characters as these, however it may be my ambi∣tion, will, I fear, never be my lot! But a noble emulation, whether or</HI>
<PB N="v" REF="047559_0004_1023C403E8806C68"/>
<HI>not it be successful, can never be despicable; and whatever are my talents, the desire of making them subservient to the cause of virtue, will, at least be approved by the candid and the good: to</HI> them <HI>I de∣dicate the following simple pages, happy, most happy, if they serve to awaken, in the rising generation, that lively wish for goodness they were intended to inspire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>My principal aim, it will be seen, is to repress that excessive softness of heart, which too frequently in∣volves its possessor in atrain of evils, and which is by no means true</HI> sen∣sibility, <HI>that exquisite gift of hea∣ven,</HI>
<PB N="vi" REF="047559_0005_1023C39B19D2C378"/>
<HI>which no one can esteem more highly than myself, though its abuse every day serves more and more to convince me, it can never be suf∣ficiently discouraged and condemn∣ed. With this short explanation of the motives which have induced me to give this Work to the Public, I resign it with implicit obedience to the decrees of these who are much more able than myself to judge of its merits.</HI></P>
<Q><LG>
<L>Yet while I hail the sympathy Di∣vine,</L>
<L>Which makes, O man! the wants of others thine:</L>
<L>I mourn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> justice scarcely own'd,</L>
<L>And <HI>principle</HI> for <HI>sentiment</HI> dethron'd!</L>

While feeling boasts her ever tearful eye,</L>
<L>Stern <HI>truth,</HI> firm <HI>faith,</HI> and manly <HI>virtue</HI> fly!</L>
<L>—As this strong feeling tends to good or ill,</L>
<L>It gives fresh pow'r to vice or principle▪</L>
<L>'Tis not peculiar to the wise and good,</L>
<L>'Tis passion's flame, the virtue of the blood.</L>
<L>But to divert it to its proper course,</L>
<L>There wisdom's power appears, there reason's force.</L>
<L>If ill directed it pursues the wrong,</L>
<L>It adds new strength to what before was strong;</L>
<L>Breaks out in wild irregular desires,</L>

<L>But if the virtuous bias rule the soul,</L>

<HEAD>THE BLIND CHILD.</HEAD>
<P>MR. WYNDHAM, of whose family I am about to relate some Anecdotes, was an eminent mer∣chant. He married an amiable woman, by whom he had four children. Their residence, dur∣ing the winter, was in one of the best streets in the city of London, and in the summer months, at his fine estate in the country, on which he had built an elegant house, and where the
<PB N="10" REF="047559_0008_1023C4983A289490"/>
riches his industry, and that of his father, had gained, were part∣ly employed in decorating his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rounds, and partly distributed with a liberal hand among the neighbouring poor. But it is not of Mr. Wyndham only I mean to speak, though his bene∣volence, his probity, and vari∣ous virtues, might well employ a more able historian than my∣self. It is true, he will sometimes appear to great advantage in the following pages: but since I ad∣dress myself to a yout<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> class of readers, it is pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e they will be more interested in what respects his children. It is their dispositions, their co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>duct, their manners, I mean to descri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and Mr. Wyndham will appear in a more amiable light as their fa∣ther than any other. As a good mother too, Mrs. Wyndham will,
<PB N="11" REF="047559_0009_1023C408C91466E0"/>
I doubt not, excite many grate∣ful comparisons in my young friends, who will read in her cha∣racter those virtues which have been exerted by their own mo∣thers; and not one sentiment of regret will, I hope, be awaken∣ed by a review of her actions, except in that feeling youthful bosom, which mourns the loss of an indulgent parent.</P>
<P>Mr. Wyndham's eldest child was a daughter, named Emily. She was, at the time when this history commences, just turned of fourteen, and at that age gave promise of every amiable and virtuous quality; I say gave <HI>pro∣mise,</HI> because at that time of life, the character cannot be decided. Neither had she been injudicious∣ly brought forward according to the fashion of the times, which, hastening the summer of life,
<PB N="12" REF="047559_0010_1023C410C2292578"/>
shortens the spring, and conse∣quently denies a proper time for the unfolding of the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lken bud, and forces an immature fruit, neither fair to the sight, nor pleasing to the taste. This re∣flection, excited by my subject, may, I hope, be excused; for, should my young readers pass it over as unimportant <HI>now,</HI> it may hereafter recur to their memory, as neither untrue nor uninter∣esting.</P>
<P>Emily, with a form of the most delicate order, had been accus∣tomed so early to habits of in∣dustry and exercise, that her frame had acquired a strength which nature had denied, and her countenance a bloom, which en∣livened it with the most graceful vivacity. She was not a beauty, but she was perfectly agreeable. Her healthy appearance, her in∣telligent
<PB N="13" REF="047559_0011_1023C412467B12A8"/>
and modest smile, the ingen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious candour that shone in her eyes, gave he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> charms infi∣nitely preferable to a cold regu∣larity of features, because they were graces which rose from the heart, and could not have ex∣isted without a corresponding sweetness of disposition. In the mild countenance and elegant manners of Emily, you might read the excellence of her tem∣per, and the intelligence of her soul. In her eyes, as in a mir∣ror, you saw reflected every mo∣tion of her heart: she was with∣out disguise; and her natural graces were infinitely preferable to any which art and affectation could have taught her. But her character will reveal itself; and my young readers, tho' charm∣ed with Emily, may be impatient to hear more of her brother
<PB N="14" REF="047559_0012_1023C39E2D88B530"/>
and sisters. Mrs. Wyndham's second child was a son, near twelve years of age. He was named Arthur, and he deserved equally with Emily the affection of his parents. He was natural∣ly of a bold, impetuous disposi∣tion, which they had taken the utmost pains to keep within due bounds, and had so far succeed∣ed, that, except in a very few instances, his behaviour was per∣fectly becoming. Sometimes, in∣deed, his natural impatience sub∣jected him to inconvenience; but that Mr. and Mrs. Wyndham did not much regret, because it served to convince him how right they were, when they warned him against yielding to the ea∣gerness of his temper. He had an excellent sense, great tender∣ness of heart, and a most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>c∣tionate disposition, which show∣ed
<PB N="15" REF="047559_0013_1023C413CA0E8DF0"/>
itself to peculiar advantage <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> behaviour to his sisters.—To the second of them, he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more mindful than to the other. Alas! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he most needed h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s attention. She was nine years old. Her name was Helen; and when she was about a year old, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had the misfortune of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r sight by a violent cold, so that she was now entirely blind; her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dark e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es turned mournfully round without re∣ceiving a single ray of light.—She had become blind so young, that she had no idea of the ob∣jects <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> her: she knew not what was meant by the sun, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or any thing that was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> beautiful; and what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more affected her tender heart, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he knew not the cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of her father and mother! What grief to them was this sad
<PB N="16" REF="047559_0014_1023C3A03114BE38"/>
affliction! with what anguish did they perceive the impossibility of giving her equal advantages of education with their other chil∣dren! with what ardour did they pray for the restoration of her sight.</P>
<P>The youngest child was also a girl. She was about seven years old, and was named Maria. She was very pretty, very gentle, and sweet in her temper, and entire∣ly the favourite of all the fami∣ly. Thus would Mr. and Mrs. Wyndham have been completely happy in their children, but for the misfortune of poor Helen; for which, however, they were partly consoled, by the tender∣ness and compassion it excited in her brother and sisters. At the time I have chosen for the com∣mencement of these Anecdotes, Mr. Wyndham's family had just
<PB N="17" REF="047559_0015_1023C499DCEE1120"/>
passed the winter in London, and were preparing for their remove to Belle-Ville, their seat in the country. The children were all extremely rejoiced and delighted with the thoughts of so pleasing an exchange. They were all bu∣sily employed in packing up their cloaths, except Helen, who sat on a window seat in the nursery, attending to their conversation.</P>

<P>Emily, sha'n't you be very glad to see your birds again?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes indeed, brother: I hope the hard winter has destroyed none of them. I charged Jenny to throw the crumbs into the fil∣bert-tree-walk; and I hope we shall find it well stocked with as many little pensioners as usual.
<PB N="18" REF="047559_0016_1023C3A4C980EC20"/>

<P>If I like it, that's enough; you need not trouble yourselves to correct my language.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HELEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I say, Arthur, that Papa does not choose you should use those words.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARTHUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, then, Papa can tell me of it without your assistance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HELEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>But not—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hush, my dear Helen. Arthur don't be angry. Come, what were we talking of?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, of Charlotte Neville;—and I shall be very glad to see
<PB N="20" REF="047559_0018_1023C41B3B81A480"/>
her too. I shall then show her my new doll, and this pretty coach Mr. Jones gave me, and this new book—look, what nice pictures there are in it—<HI>"This is the house that Jack built."</HI>—Who <HI>was</HI> Jack, sister?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HELEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>How her little tongue runs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARTHUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Emily, to ask you rather a more important question than Maria's, do you know how Mrs. Neville is?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Mamma's last letter says, she is very ill indeed.</P>
</SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="21" REF="047559_0019_1023C41DF9EF4898"/>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, for you know they have always loved each other. To lose Mrs. Neville, would be the same thing to Mamma, as it would be to Helen if I were to die; they have always loved like sisters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HELEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>To die! I don't understand that; I never could have thought of it!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(<HI>to Arthur, with tears in her eyes.</HI>)</STAGE>
<P>Poor thing, how she affects me! She means, she can have no idea of it. Alas! how many ideas m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st she want in consequence of her blindness!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HELEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Emily, you don't answer me. Tell me, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> what it is to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪</P>

<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>You ask too hard a question for me to answer, my dear Helen; I can only tell you, that when a person dies, they have no longer any sense: they seem as if they were asleep, except that they do not breathe, and they wake no more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HELEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not quite understand;—but I know enough to be sure, that it cannot be the same thing to Mamma, if Mrs. Neville was to die, as it would be to me if you died; for if you were always asleep, you could not lead me a∣bout—you could not tell me such amusing stories. Now Mamma can walk by herself, and read stories, and what you call work. I can do none of all this. Oh, it is quite another thing!</P>

<SPEAKER>ARTHUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't talk so, my dear Helen; you make us all sad.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>And Emily is crying.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HELEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where, where is she? lead me to her, Maria.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will come to you, my dear sister.—</P>
</SP>
<P>Emily then ran to her, embrac∣ed her, and here the conversa∣tion ceased for that time: the next morning they all set off for Belle-Ville, which they reached in the evening, and were too much tired to stir from the house that night. The next morning they rose very early: the three girls
<PB N="24" REF="047559_0022_1023C423ED5B30D8"/>
were soon dressed; and then they rapped at Arthur's door, which he opened, and they all went down together. Arthur, impa∣tient and eager, in a few min∣utes found himself several yards before her sisters. He was close∣ly followed by little Maria, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kipped from place to place like a young bird, and made many thousand exclamations about flowers and trees. Emily, with Helen leaning on her arm, con∣tinued to walk more slowly on the terrace, which commanded a beautiful view, and where they held the following conversation:</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HELEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I feel the air very warm and and pleasant; and how sweetly the birds sing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a glorious morning; the
<PB N="25" REF="047559_0023_1023C42570962028"/>
spring returns in all its beauty, and the birds enjoy the young leaves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HELEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, Arthur and Maria are run away! I no longer hear their voices; and you, my dear Emily, how good you are to remain with me. If you will lead me to a bench, I will set down, and you may run also.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my dear, I feel no incli∣nation to do so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HELEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is so good! You say so, because you would not have me feel sorry for keeping you here.—Yes, yes, I understand that; and I ought never to feel un∣happy, since I have such kind re∣lations.
<PB N="26" REF="047559_0024_1023C3ABE2124E28"/>
But, Emily, you said just now, it is a <HI>glorious morning;</HI> why cannot I have any notion of a <HI>glorious morning?</HI> You talk of the sun, you say how <HI>bright he shines:</HI> why does he shine, as you call it, in vain only for me? I cannot help sighing when I think of it!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(embracing her.)</STAGE>
<P>It makes me sigh too, my dear girl; it makes me as sad as it does you. But do not say the sun shines in vain for you: 'tis true, you cannot see him; but it is by his assistance the air is warmed and purified, that the birds are enlivened and caused to sing; that these flowers which you smell, are produced: thus, then, he shines not in vain even for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="27" REF="047559_0025_1023C428499385D8"/>
<SPEAKER>HELEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true; I ought not to be unhappy. But there are so many things I do not understand, so many words which have no meaning to me—The other day when you le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the room, Mr. Thomson said to Mamma, "Miss Wyndham grows very handsome—she is charming." No, Sir, Mamma said, she is not very handsome, but she is a very good girl. What did he mean by <HI>handsome?</HI> and why did Mamma say you were not so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mamma was in the right: he said so because he thought she would be pleased with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HELEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how is that? Would Mam∣ma be pleased with you for being
<PB N="28" REF="047559_0026_1023C3AD64D59890"/>
handsome? why then are you not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Mamma is too just; she would not love me the better for being handsome; only foolish people are pleased with that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HELEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, then, Mr. Thomson I guess is not very wise to take Mamma for a foolish person!—But how is it you cannot be handsome?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear, I can no more make myself handsome, than you can make yourself see. To be hand∣some, we must have regular <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea∣tures, a good complexion, and a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine shape. It is only God who can give these. They are given to many persons; but these are
<PB N="29" REF="047559_0027_1023A15A41D160B8"/>
not always the most happy. They frequently become vain or proud with their beauty; they attend to nothing but its improvement; they learn nothing but how to dress themselves; they are idle, frivolous, and useless: while children, they are inattentive to their parents; when parents, they are careless of their chil∣dren. These are my mother's ideas, almost her words. But this picture is not universal; some people render beauty more pleasing by good sense, by accom∣plishments, and by virtue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HELEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand you in part; but I can have no notion of beauty.</P>

<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! why do you think so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARTHUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because we are such chatter-pies, and you are so grave and so good. Come, what is all this about? Have you been weeping over the lamentable tale of Blue Beard, or the melancholy history of Cinderilla?</P>

<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>What nonsense is that you are talking?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARTHUR.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you laugh—Well, that is all I wanted, so my nonsense has succeeded; and Helen laughs too, that is right. Do you know it is almost breakfast time? I fancy we shal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be expected. Come, He∣len, lean on me; Emily, take the

<SPEAKER>HELEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Arthur makes me laugh, he is so droll.</P>
</SP>
<P>They then went into the house, and after breakfast was over, the children gave an account of their morning ramble. Helen was gone out of the room, and Emily remained silent. Mrs. Wyndham observing this, asked her how she found her birds and bees?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not see them, Ma'am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>How happened that, my dear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was walking on the terrace
<PB N="34" REF="047559_0032_1023C430C1EAEBC8"/>

<P>What, then you were the only one with Helen: Arthur and Ma∣ria had run away; was it not so?</P>

<P>Yes, Ma'am, but—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, my dear, I shall not speak of this as a serious matter; I dare say their vol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tile spirits only were the cause of their in∣attention. They should, how∣ever, have considered that you, who are particularly fond of the birds and bees, no doubt wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed to see them as much as they could; they ought, therefore, to have

<P>But, indeed, Ma'am, I thought Emily and Helen would have followed us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I am sure you did, Ar∣thur; and so we should, had we not insensibly engaged in an in∣teresting conversation, which pleased me better than seeing my birds; therefore, pray, Ma'am, do not be displeased with my brother and sister.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARTHUR</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(with warmth.)</STAGE>
<P>You are too good to us, Emily. As to Maria, she is excus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able, as being a child; but I ought to
<PB N="36" REF="047559_0034_1023C3B9CB22CCB0"/>
have known better. I said, in∣deed, I thought you would have followed us; but the real truth is, I believe, that I did not think any thing about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is right, Arthur; I like this candid avowal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis a thousand times better than any excuse. Let no more be said on the subject, except that I give you a general caution to im∣itate the attention of Emily to Helen. Restrain, my dears, those lively spirits, which I delight to see, when they do not interfere with <HI>her</HI> enjoyments. <HI>Poor thing, she is blind!</HI> and is thereby cir∣cumscribed in her pleasures: they all depend on our attention; and let me intreat you in this, as in
<PB N="37" REF="047559_0035_1023C4325B1BBE38"/>
all other circumstances, to do as you would be done by.</P>
</SP>
<P>At the words, <HI>"Poor thing, she is blind,"</HI> and the pathetic manner in which Mrs. Wynd∣ham pronounced them, the tears started into the eyes of Emily and Arthur, they each kissed a hand of their mother, and she uttered the promise their hearts made her, never to neglect the helpless object of their cares.—Helen just then returned, and they entered immediately on the employment of the morning.—Emily and Maria worked, while Arthur read aloud; and Helen, who by great attention had been taught to knot, employed her∣self with that, and listened to her brother. He then withdrew to take his Latin and other les∣sons with his father. Emily then
<PB N="38" REF="047559_0036_1023C4A2527CB250"/>
took a book, and afterwards Maria; then Miss Wyndham practised for an hour on the harp∣sichord, to which Helen listened with great delight: she was ex∣cessively fond of music, had an agreeable voice, and could sing several songs. While they em∣ployed themselves thus, Maria wrote with her Mamma. The children were then dressed, and Mrs. Wyndham ordered the car∣riage, and with her three daugh∣ters set out for an airing. She bade the coachman drive to Mrs. Neville's, whom she was imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tient to see, as the children were to embrace their little play-fel∣low, for whom they had brought several toys from London.</P>
<P>When the coach stopped at Mrs. Neville's door, little Char∣lotte came running out, and in an instant the young Wyndham's
<PB N="39" REF="047559_0037_1023C4389F123940"/>
were out of the coach, they ea∣gerly embraced her.—"Oh, I am so glad to see you," exclaim∣ed Charlotte: <Q>Mamma said she thought you would call to∣day.—How is your Mam∣ma to-day, my dear?</Q> said Mrs. Wyndham. <Q>Oh, very poorly indeed,</Q> the little girl replied; <Q>she is very weak too, and now she cannot walk with me at all!</Q>—Mrs. Wyndham sighed deeply, and taking little Charlotte by the hand, was led by her into the parlour, where they found Mrs. Neville. Mrs. Wyndham embraced her with that cordiality which their long friendship demanded.—Tears started into the eyes of each.—Mrs. Neville's arose from the satisfaction she felt in seeing her friend; Mrs. Wyndham's, from grief for the sad alteration a few
<PB N="40" REF="047559_0038_1023C3BC9A2EA6E8"/>
months had made in Mrs. Ne∣ville's countenance. The chil∣dren, struck by its mournful and interesting paleness, kept a pen∣sive silence, and Emily's eyes were filled with tears; she leaned down and caressed Charlotte. At length Mrs. Wyndham, conquering her emotion, broke silence.</P>

<P>She stopped, interrupted by a sudden emotion, and Charlotte's little countenance was over∣spread with sadness, when she beheld her Mamma in tears.—"Why do you cry, Mamma?" said she; <Q>you said you should be happy when Mrs. Wyndham came.—Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</Q> Mrs. Wyndham said in a low voice.

<P>Mrs. Neville paused a minute—She trembled, changed colour, and seemed so much affected, that Emily's heart beat with appre∣hension for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.

<P>My heart has ever understood yours; it does so still! But I distress you.

<P>She stopt, exhausted by speak∣ing; for both Mrs. Wyndham and her daughter were too much affected to reply. She resumed her discourse, after an instant's pause.</P>
<SP>

<P>Forgive me for speaking so much of myself; it is to recon∣cile you to an event which soon, very soon must take place. My dear Emily, be not so affected; recover yourself.</P>

<P>Emily, through her tears, stole a glance at her mother, and saw her change colour so often, that she dreaded her fainting. A sud∣den motion alone spoke her ap∣prehensions. Mrs. Wyndham saw it, and waved her hand to forbid

Then he entered victorious into Narva, accompanied by the Duc de Croi and the other Muscovite officers; he returned to them all their swords; and knowing that they wanted money, and that the merchants of Narva would let them have nothing on credit, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e sent a thousand ducats to the Duc de Croi, and five hundred to each of the other Muscovite o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icers, who were astonished at this

treatment, of which they could not have formed an idea.—At Narva was written an account of this victory, to send to Stock∣holm and to the allies of Sweden, but the King retrenched with his own hand all that was too advan∣tageous to him, and too injurious to the Czar."</P>

<P>Emily is much improved; she reads French much better than she did, and translates with spirit. That is the great thing to be de∣sired in learning a language; as to little common-place phrases, or mere conversation, they may be amusing, and they may at times be serviceable; but a language can never be entirely useful, till one can translate it liberally and easily.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MR. WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a more shining one at least, and I fancy has dazzled Arthur's eyes; but, my boy, recollect how much more easy it is to be vali∣ent than moderate. Valour is a sort of instinctive quality, few

men are without it, the noise and hurry of a battle alone would in∣spire it—nay, even in the weaker sex, a martial piece of music will frequently seem, for the time, to raise that enthusiastic spirit, which is called courage. But after a hard fought battle, to repress that sort of madness, to become immediately cool, temperate, for∣giving, and generous; oh, my boy! what an empire over the passions does this show! What an equal and heroic frame of mind!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>What enhances the merit of Charles is, that he was very young; this was his first victory of any consequence. I should scarcely have wondered, had cir∣cumstances so seducing and in∣flammatory put his moderation to slight.</P>

<P>While you atone for a hasty decision, by a candid allowance of its impropriety, there is no harm done; but accustom your∣selves, children, not to judge of ac∣tions for yourselves.

How seldom can the answer be in the affirmative when we are reading the lives of those who are called <HI>heroes!</HI> History is often a danger∣ous study, it is apt to instil false principles; there are few that a young person should read alone.
<PB N="65" REF="047559_0063_1023C46067321E60"/>
Emily has always read with her mother, therefore her decisions are generally right.</P>
</SP>
<P>Emily was delighted with her father's praises, but she showed her pleasure only by a modest animated blush, and down-cast eyes; she threw not a single glance of exultation on Arthur, who seemed a little hurt. Mr. Wynd∣ham then produced some excellent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ps of Sweden, Muscovy, and Denmark, in which they traced the <HI>routes</HI> of the Swedish and R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>an armies; during which Helen and Maria went to bed, Emily and Arthur sat an hour longer, and then retired. Mr. and Mrs. Wyndham spent the rest of the exciting in talking over the events of the day. Mrs. Wyndham re∣lated, as well as her emotions would permit, Emily's behaviour in the morning, and they mutu∣ally
<PB N="66" REF="047559_0064_1023C3D9598D59F0"/>
rejoiced in the amiable and happy dispositions of their chil∣dren. What felicity, to them thus to gratify the hearts of their parents! What misery to those wretched beings, who plant sor∣row in the breasts of an indulgent father or mother!</P>
<P>After the children had taken their accustomed ramble the next morning, Emily went to call her Mamma, whom she was rather surprised, not to have found in the breakfast-room; Mrs. Wynd∣ham was almost drest, and the following conversation passed be∣tween them:</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good morning to you, my dear Mamma, I fear you are not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ite well this morning, as you are la∣ter than usual.</P>

<P>Yet, Emily, you are less over∣come than you have seen Miss Somerville.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>That is true, Mamma; when her little brother was ill, she lay all day on the bed, she cried and took no nourishment, re∣peating continually, that she was distracted with grief.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the mean time, Mrs. So∣merville sat continually by her sick child, she allowed herself no time to rest, she attended to every thing respecting him herself. She had no assistant in whom she

<P>I trust you would have done so; thus you see, in a well-regu∣lated mind, <HI>duty</HI> is superior to <HI>feeling.</HI> We ought never to in∣dulge the one at the expence of the other. Miss Somerville has lived a good deal with an aunt of hers, who has praised and inflamed that nervous kind of sensibility you have observed; thus her mind is weakened, her tears flow upon the most trifling occasion; she does not endeavour to restrain

After breakfast, Mrs. Wynd∣ham sent a servant to know how Mrs. Neville did; and heard, with pleasure, she found herself something better; and, therefore, proposed to Mr. Wyndham, that they should spend the afternoon with their neighbours, Mr. and Mrs. Sidney: she intended to take only Emily and Arthur with her, leaving Helen and Maria with an old faithful servant, who was accustomed to take care of them when Mr. and Mrs. Wynd∣ham were absent.</P>
<P>This plan was accordingly put into execution; they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led on Mrs. Nevillein their way, whom they found tolerably well.—About half past six o'clock they reached Mr. Sidney's house, and on entering the drawing-room, found only Mr. and Mrs. Sidney, neither of their children (they
<PB N="74" REF="047559_0072_1023C3E0CF20B610"/>
had two) were present. In a few minutes Mrs. Sidney rung the bell, and ordered the servant to send Edward and Harriet into the drawing-room, as their visitors were come. Presently Miss Sid∣ney ran into the room, and with∣out regarding either Mrs. or Miss Wyndham, exclaim'd: "Mam∣ma, Ned says he won't come!"</P>

<P>Emily rose to meet her, but Miss Sidney hung down her head, and would not speak; her frock was dirty, her hair looked as if it had not been disentangled for a week, her face was heated, and

a very pretty little girl looked ex∣tremely plain and disagreeable.</P>

<P>Miss Sidney then muttered a few words to Emily, who felt quite confused for her; they sat down together, and Emily tried, in vain, to make Miss Sidney speak.

Here they were interrupted by a knocking at the window, which Harriet opened; it was Master Sidney, who called to her to come round to the drawing-room window, where she would see something <HI>"monstrous droll."</HI></P>

<P>After a little more talk about the mouse, whose distress seemed to afford great amusement to the party at the window, Mr. Wynd∣ham's carriage was announced, and that amiable family, with pleasure, took leave of a circle so different from themselves. In their way home they talked of their visit—and when Mrs. Wynd∣ham heard of the poor goldfinch, she warmly exprest her abhor∣rence of such extreme cruelty; soon after the coach stopped, and nothing more was said on the

<P>Come, Emily, tell us what you did at Mr. Sidney's last night?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing agreeable, I can as∣sure you. I went with Miss Sid∣ney into her play-room, but her books were torn to pieces, and then we came back into the draw∣ing-room to see the cat play with a mouse.</P>

<P>The cat play with a mouse; but did she not hurt it? Mamma

<P>Oh yes, she hurt it enough, I believe, but they did not <HI>mind that,</HI> as Miss Sidney said, when I asked her if her goldfinch was not unhappy when they first con∣fined him.</P>

<P>Not mind hurting any thing! I fancy this Miss Sidney is not very good?</P>

<P>Her cap was torn half off, her

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>ARTHUR</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(laughing.)</STAGE>
<P>Ah! that is just like her, with her arms swinging, and her mouth open.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>HELEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>But did she not speak to you?</P>

<P>Oh dear, how strange!</P>

<P>Oh, you never saw such a cow∣ardly fellow; when we overtook the boy who had got it, Mr. Sid∣ney gave him two or three blows, and took it from him; but poor thing, one of its legs was broken, so then Mr. Ned cried like a mad thing, and flew at the boy, beat∣ing and scratching him without mercy, and the boy did not dare to strike again. At last Mr. Sid∣ney said, <Q>Come away, Ned, let him alone now; but if he affronts you again, I'll horse∣whip him handsomely.—Do it now, Papa, said Ned, do it now! Fie, Master Sid∣ney, said I, two against one is not fair, Oh, who minds <HI>fair,</HI> said he, with such a beggar's boy as that!</Q>—and Mr. Sidney never told him he was wrong.</P>

<P>What, that his father did not teach him better? Yes, I believe so!</P>

<P>And, Emily, do you not think the same cause may have produ∣ced the same effect in Miss Sidney?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Ma'am, for she said no∣body
<PB N="100" REF="047559_0098_1023C4AD78D66270"/>
body had ever told her it was wrong to torment her bird.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then why have you ridiculed her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I—I—did not mean any harm, Mamma!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you not mean to make her appear an absurd, ridiculous cha∣racter? Did you not mean to make your brother and sisters laugh at her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Ma'am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Could you, then, had you it in your power, do her greater unkindness? In making people
<PB N="101" REF="047559_0099_1023C4B7ADBDB398"/>
ridiculous, we injure them ex∣tremely. A nick-name, as it is called, given to children, grows up with them, they are known by it; those who are not acquainted with them, form a light, if not a bad opinion of their characters: in the mean time, perhaps, they correct the faults or the follies that gave rise to it, but that is not known, while their nick∣names precede their entrance in∣to every company. It is the same with every species of ridi∣cule; if your brother and sisters were to hear to Miss Sidney ten years hence, they would connect with her name, the awkward, disagreeable idea you have given them of her character; they might, perhaps, unguardedly, express the opinion they had formed of her, and thus punish her for the faults she might have long
<PB N="102" REF="047559_0100_1023C4B931242F58"/>
before have corrected. Do you perceive to what extent this might injure her? It might de∣prive her of friends, perhaps of an establishment for life!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Mamma, I have, indeed, been very wrong; I beg of you to pardon me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>I allow to you that Miss Sid∣ney's behaviour <HI>was</HI> very blame∣able; and, therefore to <HI>me</HI> in whom you have a perfect confi∣dence, I admit you to remark on it, but not to do it with ill-nature o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> severity. I expected from the goodness of your heart, pity and generous allowance for Miss Sid∣ney, who wants the advantages you are more happily possessed of. Do you believe, that without
<PB N="103" REF="047559_0101_1023C4BBE6E85F78"/>
better advice and example, you should have been better than Miss Sidney?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, no, indeed; I must be both ungrateful and presumptuous if I could believe it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Even were there no excuse to be made for Harriet Sidney's faults, I could not allow you to employ <HI>ridicule</HI> to expose them. Personal ridicule, in general, arises from envy or ill-nature, a mean desire of lowering those vir∣tues we cannot reach, or a cruel wish to expose those follies we take a malicious pleasure in ob∣serving. Who, indeed, is there in whom nothing ridiculous can be found? The most perfect cha∣racters, by a little exaggeration, may be made ridiculous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="104" REF="047559_0102_1023C4BFDB6EB480"/>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see, Mamma, that I have been guilty of a very great fault, I am much concerned for it, and willing to submit to any punish∣ment you shall think proper. But permit me to observe, since I do not do so out of perverseness, on what you last said—for in∣stance, what is there ridiculous in you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>You pay me a great compli∣ment, Emily, which for once I will accept. But you will, perhaps, scarcely believe so striking a picture was once drawn of me by a young mimic of my acquaintance, who was not aware of my seeing her, that I could not help laughing at it myself. My little cough, the trick I have of rather leaning my head
<PB N="105" REF="047559_0103_1023C4C25E0184C0"/>
when I speak, and the slow man∣ner which I have of talking were imitated, and made to appear ri∣diculous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Mamma, but these are not ridiculous!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in themselves, perhaps, but by a little exaggeration, which a true mimic never spares, they become so; nay, Emily, even my tender attention to my grand-mother, who was very old, and required constant, assiduity, was set in the same point of view; it was deemed a disturbing and importunate <HI>"rout about nothing."</HI> an affectation of fondness and at∣tention.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Mamma, what an odious
<PB N="106" REF="047559_0104_1023C4C519C2C1D0"/>
character! Were you not very angry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means—I pitied my young acquaintance very much; it had been laughed at, and she was encouraged to mimic everybody, and no one had ever told her it was wrong.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I shall never mimic any body again. But, Mamma, you used to laugh very much at Mr. Harris, when he imitated some of the players in London.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true—but that was not personal ridicule; he merely imitated the particular style of speaking in each; some of them, you remember, were not laugh∣able
<PB N="107" REF="047559_0105_1023C4C7DF61B100"/>
only those of the comic actors, and that because they were exactly like. He also imi∣tated the manners of sailors and clowns, but that was not per∣sonal ridicule, it was aimed at no <HI>one</HI> in particular.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then that is allowable?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Under certain circumstances it may be, but it requires a very nice judgment to direct it, and in a <HI>woman</HI> it never can be right. It discovers an inclination to set herself off; besides, it must be accompanied by a self-possession, inconsistent with the modesty of the female character. Every ap∣proach to what is called <HI>humour,</HI> ought to be discouraged in a wo∣man; it puts her too forward
<PB N="108" REF="047559_0106_1023C4CAC223FD28"/>
and too much upon a level with an actress; add to that, it makes her many enemies. People who see how much she excells in gene∣ral imitation, believe she is equally capable of personal mi∣mic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, and that she is only re∣strained by their presence.—They fancy that when she is under no restraint, she is less guarded, and think that they may be of the number of those she ridicules; thus she is shunned and hated.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see, Mamma, the force of all you have urged, and I am quite determined never more to be a mimic; but, at present, I hope you pardon me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since you have not been wil∣fully and obstinately wrong, I
<PB N="109" REF="047559_0107_1023C4CD8CADA2D0"/>
pardon you, my dear; in the mean time, however, you have given me great pain, because I had hoped you had more reflection; thus I find myself under the ne∣cessity of imposing a punishment: I meant to have given you Smel∣lie's Natural History to read to∣day, but the childishness you have shown, will prevent me from putting it into your hands till a month from this time; if during that space you commit no serious fault, I shall believe this was a mere temporary return to the faults of infancy, and that you are capable of relishing the useful information contained in that pleasing book; if, on the contrary, you again do wrong, I shall still longer defer the plea∣sure I have promised you.</P>
</SP>
<P>Emily felt excessively hurt and
<PB N="110" REF="047559_0108_1023C4CF10A3A4C0"/>
disappointed on the occasion; however, she felt too much the constant justice of her mother to have murmured, even if she had not been convinced that in this instance she deserved her punish∣ment.</P>
<P>In the afternoon Mrs. Wynd∣ham went to Mrs. Neville's, whom she found so extremely ill, that she could not prevail on her∣self to quit her, but sent word home, that she should remain with her friend that night.—In the morning Mr. Wyndham sent to know how Mrs. Neville was, and heard, with great concern, that she could not live many hours; he communicated this intelligence to Emily, and immediately went to Mrs. Neville's house, leaving Emily excessively distressed. She felt the most restless anxiety, ac∣companied
<PB N="111" REF="047559_0109_1023C4D372303888"/>
by ardent wishes, to alleviate her mother's anguish; she had an incessant struggle to restrain her tears; but a wish to emulate the fortitude and equa∣nimity of her mother, prevailed on her to repress them as much as possible, and to sit down with her sisters, supplying, as well as she could, the place of Mrs. Wyndham. About four in the afternoon, Mr. and Mrs. Wynd∣ham returned, bringing with them little Charlotte Neville.—Mrs. Wyndham immediately re∣tired to her own room, while Mr. Wyndham led little Char∣lotte into the parlour, and sent for Emily, who, pale and trem∣bling, appeared immediately.</P>

<P>Mr. Wyndham then left them, and Emily, though deeply af∣fected, endeavoured to lead the
<PB N="116" REF="047559_0114_1023C4B50D3685C8"/>
little girl to other subjects, in which at times she succeeded; but Charlotte frequently spoke of her mother, in a way which affected all who heard her.—Mrs. Wyndham remained alone till the evening, when she admitted Emily, who remained with her till bed time. The next morn∣ing Mrs Wyndham returned to her family, composed though deeply dejected, thus ennobling grief by not yielding to its pas∣sionate impulses; though for many weeks it required a violent struggle between her reason and her feelings, to appear with that dignified serenity she so much wished to retain. Emily, struck by this example of fortitude, de∣termined to profit by it; it car∣ried a lesson to her heart, which she never afterwards forgot.—From this time she strove, with
<PB N="117" REF="047559_0115_1023C4B0C29D5F60"/>
undeviating attention, to cor∣rect her own faults, that she might be a worthy pattern for Charlotte to follow; she ceased not to exert the utmost tender∣ness and patience towards the lit∣tle girl, who, in being an orphan, seemed to have a sufficient claim on the affections of this amiable family, and shared equally with Maria the fondness of them all. Helen became very much attached to her, and Charlotte vied with her sisters in assiduous attendance on her.</P>
<P>Emily, however, notwith∣standing her earnest wishes to do right, was too young not to err sometimes, an instance of which occurred once every day, in her ex∣pressing some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> wish<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and particularly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> she could know what some r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ions of hers

were doing who lived in a distant country; Mrs. Wyndham smiled and told her, she would give her a story to read which had been written by a friend for her on a similar occasion when she was a girl.—Accordingly in the even∣ing, when her sisters were gone to bed, Emily read aloud the following story.</P>

<HEAD>PART THE THIRD.</HEAD>
<HEAD>ELFRIDA, OR, THE MIRROR. A FAIRY TALE.</HEAD>
<P>THE limitation of man's know∣ledge has been, in all ages, a theme equally chosen by the mo∣ralist and the discontented. The first of these characters has from
<PB N="120" REF="047559_0118_1023C5991D6E5128"/>
thence deduced many profitable conclusions to the chastisement of our present vanity, and the exaltation of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uture hope.—While the last has murmured at this confinement of his faculties, which reach not even to the per∣fect understanding of those things more immediately under his in∣spection, and are consequently very unequal to the discernment of future events or distant cir∣cumstances. To check, in some degree, the dissatisfaction of the latter, and to add strength to the reasonings of the former, the tale of Elfrida shall attempt; nay more, in spite of its puerile ap∣pearance, it shall strive to place the subject in another point of view, and consider the narrow∣ness of our capacity in this state of our existence, as one great source of the comfort we enjoy.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="047559_0119_1023C4E1DAE30E80"/>
Fashioned by the hand of na∣ture with every charm to capti∣vate the senses, Elfrida possessed also a soul of the highest order: and that aspiring genius which grasps eagerly at knowledge, and having received all that its in∣structors have to bestow, like Alexander, weeps for more <HI>worlds</HI> of <HI>information</HI> to subdue. Elfri∣da was the daughter of an Eng∣lish Baron, who was high in the favour of the third brave Ed∣ward. In the various wars of that king, Elfrida's father took an active part. She was now ap∣proaching the close of her six∣teenth year, when Fitz-Richard was summoned from his castle to attend his sovereign to the Scot∣tish wars. But a few months had he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> freed from the weight of his armour, yet he resumed it with alacrity, and felt a regret
<PB N="122" REF="047559_0120_1023C4E491E43340"/>
only in parting from his fair and innocent child.—He left her overwhelmed with grief under the care of her governess and her women, for her mother had slept many years in the silent tomb. Elfrida, who enthusiasti∣cally loved her father, and cen∣tered in him all the affections of a very sensible heart, lamented his departure with incessant regret.—The solitude in which she had been educated, and which, dur∣ing his residence in it, had for her every charm, now became insi∣pid. She frequently wandered from her governess and her wo∣men to indulge her sorrow, and waited for hours, at the extre∣mity of the park, in the hope of sooner receiving intelligence from the Baron. One day, when she had finished her morning stu∣dies, which were become unin∣teresting
<PB N="123" REF="047559_0121_1023C4E613F2FEA0"/>
to her, she retired from the heat of the sun into a natural sort of grotto, formed in a rock▪ through which perpetually ran a clear stream, and whose en∣trance was shaded by a luxuriant growth of jessamine and honey suc∣kles, which had been planted and reared by the <HI>sportive</HI> labour of Fitz-Richard and Elfrida. This place recalled to her mind the im∣age of her father in all its force.—"He has been gone," she ex∣claimed, <Q>three weeks, and I have heard from him but once. Perhaps at this moment, fa∣tigued by toilsome marches, he faints beneath the heat of this burning sun. In vain may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e now wish for his Elfrida to prepare the simple fruits which she has so often decorated with bands of flowers for his noon∣tide refreshment. While I am
<PB N="124" REF="047559_0122_1023C4E908282A50"/>
enjoying the luxurious cool∣ness of his favourite retreat, to what perils may my father be exposed? Shortly, too, new dangers will surround him; the dangers of unsparing war! His valour will place him foremost in the ranks of of battle, and who can tell.</Q>—The suggestion which her heart inspired, her tongue refus∣ed to express; a shower of tears fell from her eyes—she trembled and was silent. At length she proceeded—<Q>Oh that I could be at this moment informed of thy welfare, my father! that some beneficent being would instruct me how thou art em∣ployed! Why, alas! has hea∣ven denied the privilege of knowing how those we love are situated during their absence from us▪</Q>—Elfrida had no
<PB N="125" REF="047559_0123_1023C4ED5E0C13E0"/>
sooner pronounced these words, than she was struck with a sense of their impropriety, and has∣tened to implore the pardon of Heaven for an expression which her delicacy of feeling taught her immediately to renounce as presumptuous. Still, however, her heart acknowledged a desire that a constant information of her father's situations might be made consistent with the will of Heaven.</P>
<P>Deeply engaged in these re∣flections, Elfrida scarcely heard a flight noise in the back part of the cavern; but at length, ima∣gining she heard the sound of light footsteps, she raised her eyes, and started on beholding a figure, whose appearance spoke it of a different order of beings. The stature of this form scarcely exceeded a foot in height, and
<PB N="126" REF="047559_0124_1023C4F0194C70C0"/>
its dimensions were proportion∣ably small. Its features, how∣ever diminutive, were regularly beautiful, and its countenance bespoke tender benevolence.—On its head was placed a turban of the finest blue, the texture of which seemed like the leaf of a flower. It was ornamented with a circlet of precious stones, which, though small, was of in∣credible brightness. Its gar∣ment was a sort of robe descend∣ing in folds to the ground, of the most exquisite whiteness, and shining like the flight threads which in the autumn are seen floating over the grass at sun-set. In one hand it held an ivory wand, and in the other a <HI>mirror</HI> of the most admirable polish.</P>
<P>Elfrida, startled by this super∣natural appearance, would have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed, but was withheld by a sort
<PB N="127" REF="047559_0125_1023C4F19B2F80D0"/>
of irresistible impulse. Her eyes eagerly surveyed the shining stranger, who, advancing, said: <Q>Be not alarmed, Elfrida; for innocence, and goodness of heart like yours, have from me nothing to fear. You have heard, and, with propriety, despised, a thousand idle tales of the fairies, which have no existence but in imagination. You have rightly judged it in∣consistent with the wisdom of the Supreme Being to suffer a set of inferior agents to tor∣ment mankind with impunity. But learn, fair Elfrida, that although they exist not for purposes so vain, they yet <HI>do</HI> exist. Under the controul of superior power, they are per∣mitted, by their invisible agen∣cy, to direct the smaller con∣cerns of man's life. Once in
<PB N="128" REF="047559_0126_1023C4F424B7B438"/>
an age their personal appear∣ance is allowed to some favour∣ed mortal, who, like yourself, possesses a heart simple and un∣seduced by the allurements of vice. I have heard your re∣gret and your wishes, and to me it is given, though I can∣not remove the one, yet to fulfil the other. Your father is gone on a service of danger, but it is also a service of glory. He is himself perfectly satisfi∣ed with his situation, nor would he exchange it for the inglorious repose of a peace∣ful station. The only allay to his satisfaction is the necessity of quitting you, but he anti∣cipates the time of his return with hopeful pleasure. Be it your task to improve the in∣terval of his absence by an un∣remitting attention to your
<PB N="129" REF="047559_0127_1023C4F850022118"/>
improvement in those accom∣plishments he wished you to possess. Do not by vain regrets impair the health, and lavish the sensibility on which Fitz-Richard depends <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r his future happiness.</Q></P>
<P>Elfrida, who had listened at first with some degree of terror, which insensibly wore away, now hastened to assure the fairy, that she was perfectly convinced of the propriety of her remarks, and to promise, that she would in future more steadily endea∣vour to repress a too great sen∣sibility.—<Q>You say well, gentle Elfrida, replied the fairy, and I read in your heart the sincerity of your purposes.—But why wander the eyes of my fair favourite? I see you are curious to know more of me. I am the queen of the
<PB N="130" REF="047559_0128_1023C4FB586C9428"/>
fairies, and to me is particu∣larly allotted the care of the young and beautiful. This wand is the scarce of my pow∣er, and this mirror, Elfrida, shall be to you, if you still wish it, all you have asked from Heaven. Tell me, do you yet seek to be constantly informed of your father's situ∣ation? I see you do.—Take, then, this mirror: three times in every day, (with the inter∣val of at least half an hour between each time) for five minutes, it shall dep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> to you the exact image and employ∣ment of your father.</Q></P>
<P>Elfrida eagerly extended her hand, and for the first time los∣ing her attention to the fairy, she cast her eyes on the so-much desired gift. She there beh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld the image of her father, who
<PB N="131" REF="047559_0129_1023C4FCDB2AAE70"/>
walked conversing with a friend; his countenance expressed health <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d happiness. Elfrida's tears <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with pleasure at the sight, and when she had gazed on it till it vanished, she turned eagerly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>und, and thanked repeatedly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and generous fairy.—<Q>You are then satisfied with my gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, Elfrida?</Q> said she with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> smile; <Q>you persist in the determination of accept∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> it? Ah, mistaken—but I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ve you to experience the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ice you have made! If at any time you become tired of possessing the mirror, come hit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>am, and when you have dipped it in the water of this stream, I will appear and re∣ceive it from you.</Q></P>
<P>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y then disappeared, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Elfrida, after pausing for a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> minutes to recover from her
<PB N="132" REF="047559_0130_1023C4FF755ED398"/>
astonishment, returned to the eastle. To her governess alone, in whom she had a perfect confi∣dence, she repeated the circum∣stance of this surprising vision; at first the governess treated it as a vapour of the imagination▪ but on seeing the mirror, began to believe in the truth of the sto∣ry. Elfrida, that her mind might be perfectly satisfied, beg∣ged her to cast her eyes on it at the same time with herself; the governess complied, and they both saw the Baron Fitz-Richard. He was on horseback, and while they gazed, the horse fell and thr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w his rider to the ground: Elfrida shrieked and dropped the mirror! Instantly she caught it again from the earth; but, alas! in that moment the picture had vanished! The excess of her anxiety and dread may, perhaps
<PB N="133" REF="047559_0131_1023C50369FC0048"/>
be conceived; she wept, she trembled, and at intervals giving herself up to the horrors of her imagination, she screamed aloud in agony.—Thus passed the al∣lotted half hour which must in∣tervene ere she could again see any thing; the moment it expired, she seized the glass, and beheld her father extended on a couch pale and languid, his arm was bound round by a scarf, and El∣frida believed he had broken it; this was all that appeared, and Elfrida remained as unsatisfied as ever. In this interval her go∣verness endeavoured to impress on the mind of Elfrida the folly of seeking to know more than Providence had revealed; but Elfrida, distracted with anxiety, heard her not, waiting, with her eyes fixed on the mirror, till the alotted half hour should expire.
<PB N="134" REF="047559_0132_1023C50610045780"/>
At length the heavy minute; de∣parted, and the same scene was again presented to her view. And now the mirror had for that day lost its power, and in vain El∣frida wept and rejected sleep. Ere the night was spent, an express arrived, who brought letters from the Baron. Elfrida opened them with impatience, they were dated five days before, and though they gave the most satisfactory accounts of his health at that time, Elfrida, who knew what had passed since, received no pleasure from them. She threw them aside, and waited for the morning dawn with a passionate impatience, which destroyed the natural sweetness of her temper. Ere it arrived, however, sleep closed her weary eyes, and she opened them in consequence of the sun-beams which darted
<PB N="135" REF="047559_0133_1023C50793A6DE58"/>
through her windows. Angry with herself for having slept she seized the mirror, and saw her father at the door of his tent; he raised his hands in thankfulness to Heaven, and Elfrida at once perceived that his arm had not been broken, and that by the quickness of his recovery, in all probability, the accident had been comparatively slight. She first ardently thanked Heaven for his escape, and then exclaim∣ed, <Q>Ah, mischievous present, what grief has it caused me! Had I not accepted this mirror, these letters would have been to me a source of delight; I should have known nothing of a circumstance which has been in itself of little consequence, and which, even had it been worse, I could not have reme∣died. I will return this mirror
<PB N="136" REF="047559_0134_1023C50A8FBD1938"/>
to the fairy, and henceforth content myself with the gifts which Heaven has bestowed.</Q> Her governess applauded her re∣solve, and Elfrida hastened to the grotto, she impatiently dip∣ped the mirror into the stream, and the fairy immediately ap∣peared.—<Q>Take back your fatal gift,</Q> said the fair Elfrida, <Q>I have already proved the misery which attends it, already have discovered the folly of my wishes.—With pleasure I receive it, replied the fairy, a pleasure which arises from the joy I feel in such an instance of your prudence. I knew when I gave it to you, the sor∣rows which must accompany the knowledge you desired, but scarcely hoped that you would have been so soon convinced of its inefficacy to make you happy.
<PB N="137" REF="047559_0135_1023C50EB2118CF8"/>
—'Tis true, I might have made the gift more perfect, but if it had continually reflected the image of your father, you would have neglected every thing to gaze upon it, and your time would have passed unmarked by improvement. I see you have no desire of the kind remaining; but, Elfrida, although this gift is useless to you, yet the experience it has brought will not prove so. Henceforth you will be con∣vinced when you are tempted to form <HI>wishes,</HI> that if granted, they would in all probability conduce as little to your real happiness as <HI>this</HI> has done. None could wear a more speci∣ous appearance than this, which seemed prompted by filial af∣fection; but suspect in future, Elfrida, that every desire of
<PB N="138" REF="047559_0136_1023C5115725A4D8"/>
whatever sort, is unreasonable and improper, if it leads to <HI>discontent.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The fairy ended, and Elfrida, after sincerely thanking her, re∣turned to the castle with a mind deeply impressed by the circum∣stances which had befallen her.</P>
<P>This story, and the comments it occasioned, employed the re∣mainder of the evening. Emily requested to know why her mo∣ther objected to Helen's and Maria's hearing it, and Mrs. Wyndham explained to her the difficulty which such young minds would have had to sepa∣rate the fiction from the truth of the story.</P>
<P>A few days afterwards, Em∣ily
<PB N="139" REF="047559_0137_1023C512D9322E18"/>
and Helen were invited by a lady who lived near them, to accompany Mrs. Wyndham to hear her concert, which she had formed at her own house to ce∣lebrate the birth-day of her son; this party they anticipated with the greatest delight, they were both extremely fond of music, and it formed, indeed, almost the only pleasure which Helen could enjoy without imperfec∣tion; opportunities of hearing good music in the country are scarce, and thus the two girls fixed all their wishes for several days before on the accomplish∣ment of this scheme. They were accordingly drest to go, and the carriage was ordered, when a message arrived from the lady to whose house they were going, saying, that she was very sorry
<PB N="140" REF="047559_0138_1023C5154EEC6388"/>
it was not in her power to re∣ceive them, as she had just heard of the death of a relation, which obliged her to renounce her in∣tended plan for the evening. Emily immediately said, <Q>Poor Mrs. Selwyn, how sorry am I for her!</Q> and seemed to for∣get her own disappointment in concern for the cause; but He∣len directly burst into tears, and seemed quite overwhelmed with mortification. Mrs. Wyndham took no notice of her for a few minutes, hoping she would of herself overcome the impatient sorrow into which she had fallen; but perceiving she indulged it, and sullenly rejected the sooth∣ings of her sisters, she spoke to her.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Helen, you both surprise and vex me! my dear child, you
<PB N="141" REF="047559_0139_1023C517F21A33D0"/>
must not suffer yourself to be thus overcome by such a trifle. Cease crying, Helen, and speak to me.</P>
</SP>
<P>Helen, however, continued crying with great violence, and as Maria attempted to caress and console her, she pushed her a∣way with an impatient air.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, I see you are determined to be a naughty girl; go, then, from me to the farthest part of the room, and when you are more quiet, and more like a reasonable being, I will speak to you again. Lead her away, Emily, if she does not push you from her.</P>
</SP>
<P><PB N="142" REF="047559_0140_1023C51DA8D73EF8"/>
These words seemed to make some impression on Helen, but passion again got the better of her feelings, and she suffered herself to be led from her mo∣ther, who, much hurt, desired Emily to change her dress, and then as the carriage was ready, she would take a ride with her, as the evening was delightful—Emily cheerfully obeyed, and by the time she returned, Helen was once more quiet. Mrs. Wyndham then called her to her, and said,</P>
<P>Now, Helen, tell me why you cried?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HELEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because, Mamma, I was so much disappointed.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="143" REF="047559_0141_1023C51F2CA801C0"/>
<SPEAKER>MRS. WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>But did you suppose that your tears would overcome Mrs. Sel∣wyn's just reason for not receiv∣ing us, or oblige me to have a concert to entertain you?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>HELEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Mamma, but I could not help crying.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Helen, if we suffer ourselves to say we cannot help being foolish and unreasonable, we shall soon become really incapa∣ble of avoiding it, and thus throw away the best of our pos∣sessions, reason and self-com∣mand. Do you suppose Emily was not disappointed?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can you be sure of that? But even allowing it to be so, you may suppose she was some∣what mortified; at least, then, you would have expected her to appear dissatisfied.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>HELEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>But Emily is older than I am.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true; but if Emily, from your age, had permitted herself to fall into a passion on every disappointment, don't you suppose by this time she would
<PB N="145" REF="047559_0143_1023C52508EDCFF8"/>
have been still more violent than you are? From an infant I have accustomed Emily to bear dis∣appointment patiently; and this is one instance out of many in which she has found the advan∣tage of it. She has neither fretted herself sick, nor made me uncomfortable.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>HELEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have I made you uncomfort∣able, Mamma?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: a child can never do wrong without inflicting a pang on the heart of a parent. Be∣sides, in this instance, I have another reason for being dis∣turbed; the fear that I have
<PB N="146" REF="047559_0144_1023C527D2A2C850"/>
been the first cause of your im∣patience: knowing that your enjoyments were few, and your inconveniences many, I have al∣ways endeavoured to increase the first and remove the latter. I have always studiously tried to prevent your being disappointed of any expected pleasure, and have even taken pains to pro∣cure them for you, knowing af∣ter all my endeavours, how li∣mitted they still must be!</P>

<P>Oh, Mamma, how good you are!</P>

<P>But, Helen, if in return for my indulgence, I find that I have

The children were excessively delighted, and setting out in the highest spirits, they enjoyed their ride without any mixture of regret.</P>
<P>In the course of a day or two, Mrs. Wyndham went with her eldest daughter to pay a visit in the neighbourhood; there were three or four young people, and it was proposed they should stroll a while in the garden; they did so, and on their return, Mrs. Wyndham, accustomed to ob∣serve the looks of Emily, saw that she returned dissatisfied with her companions, and much dis∣turbed at something which had happened. When they were seated in the carriage to return, Mrs. Wyndham questioned her on the subject, and Emily re∣plied thus:</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="047559_0150_1023C5387B2163E0"/>
It is true, Mamma, I was displeased with the behaviour of the young ladies with whom I walked.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, my dear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>When we first went into the garden, Miss Darnford said to me, <Q>You'll excuse me, Miss Wyndham, if I walk with Miss Smithson, I have not seen her before to-day, and I have a great deal to tell her.</Q> I thought this a little strange, however I begged she would do as she liked best; and accord∣ingly she took Miss Smithson by the arm, walked on with her, and entered into a long talk, laughing and speaking with so much agitation, that I concluded
<PB N="153" REF="047559_0151_1023C53BA20D73F8"/>
she must have met with some∣thing remarkably droll and plea∣sing. Miss Martin, who walked with me, said, <Q>I think Miss Darnford is very rude, when one of her <HI>friends,</HI> as she calls them is with her.—She ap∣pears, I said, to have something of consequence to relate to Miss Smithson.—Nonsense,</Q> replied Miss Mar∣tin, <Q>she saw her last night, and she only behaves in this way to give herself an air to to you of being very clever, and very fond of her friend. As to what she has to tell her, <HI>I'll lay you a wager</HI> I know it beforehand; she told me be∣fore you came a great deal about it, and her father would be very angry with her if he knew she told.</Q></P>

<SPEAKER>MRS. WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think, Emily, as you re∣present her, Miss Martin has a very blunt, odd manner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh yes, Mamma, she used very odd expressions, and I thought spoke strangely. She told me, then, that Miss Darn∣ford was repeating a conversation which had passed before her be∣tween her father and a gentle∣man on some business, about which they had quarrelled. I was quite shocked to think she should ever mention what had passed in her father's house! By this time the story was ended, and the ladies joined us, Miss Darnford saying, <Q>Be sure you don't mention it, Papa would be very angry if he should
<PB N="155" REF="047559_0153_1023C53FEB425B28"/>
hear of it.</Q> They then walked with us, and Miss Darnford be∣gan to ask me questions, how I employed myself, whether I learned music and dancing, and whenever I answered, I saw she looked at Miss Smithson, and they both seemed ready to laugh, which confused me very much. At last Miss Darnford said, <Q>So you've no governess, and your Mamma teaches you herself; well that is very odd!</Q> I asked her "Why?" and she said, <Q>Oh, I don't know, only I hear she goes on quite different from the common way, and that you and your sisters are to be <HI>vastly clever!</HI></Q>—Here both the ladies laughed, and Miss Smith∣son said, <Q>Well, thank my stars, my Mamma has no such whims—she does not trouble her
<PB N="156" REF="047559_0154_1023C543E1B17D00"/>
head much about us; why they say, Miss Wyndham, that you never go out without your Mamma—that you are employed all day with her—and that she makes you tell her every thing you know.</Q> I found by this time, Mamma, that these young people were not well educated, nor very ami∣able, so I said very coolly, <Q>You are mis-informed, my mother is incapable of <HI>whims,</HI> she is all goodness, I am never hap∣py but when I am with her; and as to telling her all I know, I never knew any thing with which she is not acquainted.—What,</Q> said Miss Darn∣ford, <Q>do you tell her the se∣crets your friends trust you with?—I told her, I was too young to be entrusted with
<PB N="157" REF="047559_0155_1023C546C6671960"/>
secrets of any importance, and that I had no particular friends out of my own family.—How, no friends!</Q> said Miss Darnford, adding in an af∣fected tone, <Q>poor thing! How unhappy you must be! Oh, I pity you, since you never knew the delight of <HI>perfect con∣fidence.</HI></Q>—"Pardon me," I said, <Q>I talk with perfect con∣fidence to my mother!—Oh, said she, that is im∣possible.</Q> And here, Mamma, the conversation was stopped by our being called into the house. But will you explain to me why these young ladies behaved so strangely?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can do that easily, but it will take up some time, since al∣most
<PB N="158" REF="047559_0156_1023C5494E2A05B8"/>
every word they spoke con∣tained some false principle. I knew something of the charac∣ter of Miss Darnford, and had you been a year younger, or your principles less fixed, I should not have permitted you to walk with them. In the first part of her behaviour to her <HI>friend,</HI> (a name abused by such an applica∣tion) Miss Darnford showed great want of good-breeding—for politeness forbids us, if ever so much attached, to single out the object of our <HI>affections,</HI> as the sole object of our <HI>attention</HI> in any party; even if we are wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h two people whom we love in differ∣ent degrees, we are not permit∣ted to mortify that person we love least, by excessive marks of attachment to the person we love most; a real friendship needs
<PB N="159" REF="047559_0157_1023C54AD1044320"/>
not these constant testimonies of love, it trusts in its friend, and believes her incapable of miscon∣struing our attention to others. We ought, then, never to l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t any person have reason to believe they are in our way, or that we wish their absence, because both humanity and politeness forbid us to mortify any person so se∣verely, who certainly has not deserved it of us.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the next place you may ob∣serve in Miss Darnford, an in∣stance of that hateful <HI>exaggera∣tion,</HI> against which I have so of∣ten warned you. At thirteen (Miss Darnford's age) it is not
<PB N="160" REF="047559_0158_1023C54DA0174D30"/>
possible that the character should be sufficiently formed, the under∣standing enough enlightened, to admit of our choosing a real <HI>friend.</HI> At that age, in general, the imagination has most power. A fine face, an interesting figure, are recommendations sufficiently powerful to win the heart. Some young people are brought up, particularly at schools, with the idea that they must form an inti∣macy with some one; thus they select the first person who pleases their fancy, her only recommen∣dation, perhaps, what they call being very <HI>good-natured;</HI> they tell her all they know; they de∣tach themselves from their family; its secrets if they can learn them, are divulged; a thousand ill con∣sequences follow, of which you will one day, my dear Emily, be
<PB N="161" REF="047559_0159_1023C551B0E4A9A0"/>
more sensible than I can make you now. When you shall be of age to judge, do not suppose I shall object to your forming a strict intimacy with any one, whom you shall then believe wor∣thy of your esteem—at present I hope your mother is your friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, the best, the dearest of my friends—she must always be so!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must have seen in Miss Darnford enough to disgust you with that ridiculous affectation of friendship which at her age cannot exist. Young people are too apt to deceive themselves on this point; they find the deceit at last, and the next person they see at all agreeable, supplies the place of the discarded friend; they have chosen lightly, again
<PB N="162" REF="047559_0160_1023C554452AB160"/>
are deceived, and again change their connexion. Thus they con∣tract a habit of sickleness and ca∣price; they learn to exaggerate their feelings, the most danger∣ous of all errors. They never con∣sult their reason, never ask them∣selves whether they really love her whom they call their <HI>friend,</HI> whether they are capable of pain∣ful sacrifices for her sake, whe∣ther they really esteem her cha∣racter. These are the only proofs of <HI>real</HI> friendship, and judge, then, whether false intimacy and confidence are worthy of the name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, surely not! Besides, what becomes of the discarded friend, she must think herself very ill treated.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly; she did not, per∣haps,
<PB N="163" REF="047559_0161_1023C555C7052268"/>
seek, the connexion, it was forced upon her; if she is un∣generous, finding herself thus dismissed, she believes herself at liberty to repeat all that has been said to her. At least she makes the young person ridiculous, and if, like Miss Darnford, she has dared to disclose the affairs of her family, think what dreadful consequences may ensue. How many quarrels, how much ha∣tred, how many horrid events have flowed from these ill judg∣ed connexions! If, fearing these, a young person acts more <HI>pru∣dently,</HI> and does not discard the <HI>friend</HI> she no longer loves, think what misery she has proposed for herself, to live in habits of inti∣macy which she dares not break, with a person she has no regard for, whom, perhaps, her better
<PB N="164" REF="047559_0162_1023C558A7B17408"/>
judgment even obliges her to despise! if the same lightness and inconstancy be carried to a more advanced age (as it fre∣quently is) when people have af∣fairs of their own, think what mischief it must do!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am convinced of the neces∣sity of choosing a friend with at∣tention and caution, and I thank you, Mamma, a thousand times for saving me from this false sen∣sibility.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MRS. WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think you need no caution to warn you against ever repeating any thing you hear in your fa∣ther's house. A child whose lips are not sealed respecting all that reaches her of family affairs and opinions, is the most dangerous
<PB N="165" REF="047559_0163_1023C55B783F98E0"/>
enemy of her connexions: she is unsuspected, no one believes her capable of so great an im∣prudence or so black a treachery, and thus to do much evil is put into her power. As to what the young ladies said of me and my pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of education, you have sense enough to pity it, as arising only from that thoughtless folly which very often induces weak minds to form a hasty decision on what they cannot comprehend.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMILY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Atleast, Mamma, I shall draw one advantage from this visit. I shall learn that it is my best and safest way always to tell you all that appears strange to me, and so to preserve myself from the bad effects of ill example.</P>

<SPEAKER>MRS. WYNDHAM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Such an observation does you
<PB N="166" REF="047559_0164_1023C55F98B541A0"/>
credit, my dear; to draw the best instruction we can from any event is always wise and good. Do not tell what has passed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>to Helen and Maria, they are too young to understand it. Tell them only that you walked in the garden, and that you did not much like your visit.</P>

<P>In regular attendance on their several studies, the Wyndhams passed the summer; however, for the first time, they saw the approach of winter without re∣gret, as the oculist, whose ad∣vice they had taken, gave them hopes that by that time he should be able to perform an operation on Helen's eyes, which would, if any thing could, restore her to sight. We may judge with what extreme anxiety the whole family awaited this important period;
<PB N="167" REF="047559_0165_1023C5623362D8A0"/>
they took care not to inform Helen of their hopes, left they should be disappointed, and she should be more dejected than be∣fore. The autumn they spent very agreeably, enjoying the set∣tled serenity of the weather and the different scenes of harvest and fruit-gathering, in all of which the children were permit∣ted to assist. At the end of October the whole family went to London, and in a week after that, Helen was to submit to the decisive operation, from which they all hoped so much. Her mother, with infinite feel∣ing and tenderness, prepared her for it, and received her promise to sit patiently and quietly. The day arrived, and the anxious fa∣mily assembled to witness the event, Charlotte Neville and Ma∣ria
<PB N="168" REF="047559_0166_1023C564DD6E1A78"/>
excepted, whose vivacity they feared would interrupt the sur∣geon. Mrs. Wyndham, alike unable to fee the operation, or to quit the room, retired to one end of it, trembling, pale, her hands and her heart lifted up to God, but concealing her face on the shoulder of Arthur, whose arms were thrown round his mother, while his tears fell fast on her cheek. Emily, struggling with the extreme agitation of her mind, but by a strong effort com∣posed, knelt with her eyes fixed on Helen, and one of her arms round her waist, while the other hand held both the hands of Helen. It is not possible to de∣scribe the conflicting emotions which were visible on her coun∣tenance; hope, fear, tenderness, and devotion, were mingled in
<PB N="169" REF="047559_0167_1023C56792BCAD38"/>
her eyes, which were now raised to Heaven, now fixed on her sis∣ter, and at intervals seeking to penetrate the thoughts of the operator. Mr. Wyndham stood on the other side of Helen, ex∣horting her to have courage, yet feeling on his heart every touch of the instrument which the skil∣ful and tender oculist applied to the eyes of the patient, quiet Helen; behind whose chair stood two female servants; hardly da∣red they breathe, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t they should interrupt or discompose the pa∣tient or the surgeon. In about ten minutes Helen gave a faint shrick, and exclaimed—<Q>Ah, my God! What is this! <HI>Do I see!</HI></Q>—At this exclamation Mrs. Wyndham rose suddenly, but unable to endure her sensa∣tions, she fainted. Mr. Wynd∣ham
<PB N="170" REF="047559_0168_1023C56A26847558"/>
by a sign, requested Emily not to quit her sister, and ran to support his wife, whom, with Arthur's assistance, they con∣veyed out of the room. Emily, her complexion changing every instant from white to crimson, the tears streaming down her cheeks, could no longer suppress her anxiety.—"Oh, Sir," she said, "does she see!"—"Hush," replied the surgeon, and Emily was again silent. Helen ex∣claimed in broken words, but the surgeon having finished the operation, with the help of the servants covered her eyes, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bade them to remove the ban∣dage, as every thing depended on her not being suffered to use her eyes.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>HELEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, this is Emily who weeps so! Do not my dear Emily; I shall see in time. I had such an odd thought just now, I seemed to feel something with my eyes.</P>
</SP>
<P>Just then Mr. Wyndham re∣turned. Emily rising, threw her∣self into his arms. <Q>Ah, my dear Father, she whispered, Helen will see; she has seen! But my mother,—Go to your mother, my dear,</Q> said Mr. Wyndham, <Q>she is b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ter, but unable to return hither; compose yourself, and prevail on her to be composed.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="047559_0170_1023C56E2F683330"/>
Emily then flew to her mo∣ther, she told her what had pass∣ed, and in about ten minutes they were both composed enough to return to Helen, whom they found lying on her own bed, with all the windows closed.—The surgeon ordered that she should be kept in darkness some days, and light be admitted only by degrees: he bestowed on Emily the highest praises, for the united sensibility and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ti∣tude she had shown. "This," said he, <Q>is true sensibility; in the course of my practice, I witness so much affectation, so much exaggerated feeling; I see people unable to attend their nearest connexions when it is absolutely necessary; run∣ing away from scenes of pain and inconvenience, with so much selfishness, as quite sick∣ens
<PB N="173" REF="047559_0171_1023C57273CBA8A8"/>
me sometimes of <HI>sensibility.</HI> But you, my dear Miss Wynd∣ham, have reconciled me to it, since I perceive you make it assistant to, not destructive of your duties. Such scenes as that of to-day seldom oc∣cur: nothing could be more trying, and it might very well have happened that a delicate frame had sunk under the ex∣ertions of a strong mind.—What I principally allude to, is the common practice of people, who run from the sick <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of those whom they ought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sooth and comfort, because, truly, they cannot bear to see them suffer!—That, said Mrs. Wyndham, is exactly what I have always warned Emily against. True sensibility is active and useful; fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nderness enervates the
<PB N="174" REF="047559_0172_1023C5757628E228"/>
mind, and renders its best wishes unavailing.</Q></P>
<P>In the course of a few days, light was gradually admitted in∣to the apartments of Helen, and she was suffered to <HI>see</HI> those dear friends to whom she owed so much. But no description can do justice to the circumstances of their meeting, nor can any idea be given of the delight with which she gazed on the counte∣nances of her mother and sister. By degrees she became familiar with the objects about her, which at first she knew not how to avoid in walking across the room; nor was it for some time she could enjoy the beauties of nature, scarcely understanding the meaning of her own sensa∣tions. By degrees, however, her mind became more composed, and the sight of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="175" REF="047559_0173_1023C576F7A792E8"/>
stars, the clouds, a river, or a flower, were to her a source of delight for hours; her genius expanded, and her mind was so shuck by these objects, at once so new and so interesting, that every one observed her thoughts were more sublime, and her lan∣guage more expressive than those of other people. Even the sin∣gularity of her expressions, the eagerness of her gestures, were interesting.</P>
<P>Restoration of her sight com∣pleted the happiness of her amia∣ble family; when her eyes were sufficiently strengthened to ad∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t of it, she learned rapidly to write and read; and for painting, she discovered a genius so re∣markable, as induced her father to give her the best masters. In both portraits and landscapes she succeeded wonderfully. At∣tached
<PB N="176" REF="047559_0174_1023C579D2874170"/>
with enthusiasm to her parents and sisters, she never for∣got their cares in her helpess state. If they were sick, she de∣voted herself to them, saying fre∣quently, <Q>Oh, can I ever repay your attention to me when <HI>I was blind!</HI></Q></P>
<P>Emily remained the same ex∣cellent character. She attended entirely to the education of Char∣lotte Neville, who became all she could wish her. Arthur and Maria in the same manner ful∣filled the wishes of their parents. Prosperity and peace to the end of their lives attend this amiable family, who were constantly employed in the performance of their several duties, and whose goodness was recompensed by as much felicity as this life is ca∣pable of receiving.</P>

<HEAD>THE STORY of MR. WENTWORTH. From the MIRROR, No. 27. [A periodical Paper, very deserving of at∣tention.]</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q>There is a kind of mournful eloquence
In thy dumb grief, which shames all clamorous sorrow.</Q>
<BIBL>LEE'S THEODOSIUS.</BIBL>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>A VERY amiable and much respected friend of mine, whose real name I shall conceal under that of <HI>Wentworth,</HI> had lately the
<PB N="178" REF="047559_0176_1023C5808ADCF5C8"/>
misfortune of losing a wife, who was not only peculiarly beauti∣ful, but whose soul was the man∣sion of every virtue, and of every elegant accomplishment. She was suddenly cut off in the flower of her age, after having lived twelve years with the best and most af∣fectionate of husbands. A perfect similarity of temper and dispo∣sition, a kindred delicacy of taste and sentiment, had linked their hearts together in early youth, and each succeeding year seemed but to add new strength to their affection. Though possessed of an affluent fortune, they pre∣ferred the tranquillity of the country to all the gay pleasures of the capital. In the cultiva∣tion of their estate, in che∣rishing the virtuous industry of its inhabitants, in ornamenting a beautiful seat, in the society of
<PB N="179" REF="047559_0177_1023C58343364018"/>
one another, in the innocent prat∣tle of their little children, and in the company of a few friends, Mr <HI>Wentworth</HI> and his <HI>Amelia</HI> found every wish gratified, and their happiness complete.</P>
<P>My readers will judge then, what must have been Mr. <HI>Went∣worth'</HI>s feelings, when <HI>Amelia</HI> was thus suddenly torn from him, in the very prime of her life, and in the midst of her felicity. I dreaded the effects of it upon a mind of his nice and delicate sen∣sibility: and, receiving a letter from his brother, requesting me to come to them, I hasted thi∣ther, to endeavour by my pre∣sence, to assuage his grief, and prevent those fatal consequences of which I was so apprehensive.</P>
<P>As I approached the house, the sight of all the well-known
<PB N="180" REF="047559_0178_1023C5866DE2B828"/>
scenes, brought fresh into my mind the remembrance of <HI>Ame∣lia;</HI> and I felt myself but ill qual∣ified to act the part of a comfort∣er. When my carriage stopt at the gate, I trembled, and would have given the world to go back. A heartfelt sorrow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at on the countenance of every servant; and I walked into the house with∣out a word being uttered. In the hall I was met by the old b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ler, who was grown grey headed in the family, and he hastened to conduct me up stairs.—As I walked up, I commanded firm∣ness enough to say, <Q>Well, Wil∣liam, how is Mr. Wentworth▪</Q> The old man, turning about with a look that pierced my heart, said, <Q>Oh, Sir, our excellent Lady!</Q>—Here his grief overwhelmed him; and it was with difficulty he was able to open
<PB N="181" REF="047559_0179_1023C5892B925BA0"/>
to me the door of the apartment.</P>
<P>Mr. Wentworth ran and em∣braced me with the warmest af∣fection; and, after a few mo∣ments, assumed a firmness, and even an ease, that surprised me. His brother, with a sister of Ame∣lia's, and some other friends that were in the room, appeared more over powered than my friend him∣self, who, by the fortitude of his behaviour, seemed rather to mo∣derate the grief of those around him, than to demand their com∣passion for himself. By his gen∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and kind attentions, he seem∣ed anxious to relieve their sor∣row; and, by a sort of concerted traquillity, strove to prevent their discovering any symptoms of the bitter anguish which preyed up∣on his mind. His countenance was pale, and his eyes betrayed
<PB N="182" REF="047559_0180_1023C58BB6DF7C40"/>
that his heart was ill at ease; but it was that silent and majes∣tic sorrow which commands our reverence and our admiration.</P>
<P>The next morning after break∣fast, I chanced to take up a vo∣lume of Metastasio, that lay amongst other books upon a ta∣ble; and, as I was turning over the leaves, a slip of paper, with something written on it, dropped upon the floor.—Mr. Went∣worth picked it up; and as he looked at it, I saw the tears start from his eyes, and, fetching a deep sigh, he uttered, in a low and broken voice, <HI>"My poor Amelia!"</HI>—It was the translation of a favourite passage which she had been attempting, but had left unfinished. As if uneasy le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t I had perceived his emotion, he carelessly threw his arm over my
<PB N="183" REF="047559_0181_1023C58D3A4DD7A0"/>
shoulder, and reading aloud a few lines of the page which I held open in my hand, he went into some remarks on the poe∣try of that elegant author.—Sometime after, I observed him take up the book, and carefully replacing the slip of paper where it had been, put the volume into his pocket.</P>
<P>Mr. Wentworth proposed that we should walk out, and that he himself would accompany us. As we stepped through the hall, one of my friend's youngest boys came running up, and catching his Papa by the hand, cried out with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oy, that <HI><Q>Mam∣ma's Rover was returned</Q></HI> This was a spaniel, who had been the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avourite of Amelia, and had followed her in all her walks; but after her death, had been
<PB N="184" REF="047559_0182_1023C59017B50FB0"/>
sent to the house of a villager, to be out of the immediate sight of the family. Having somehow made his escape from thence, the dog had that morning found his way home; and, as soon as he saw Mr. Wentworth, leaped upon him with an excess of fond∣ness. I saw my friend's lips and cheeks quiver. He catched his little Frank in his arms; and, for a few moments, hid his face in his neck.</P>
<P>As we traversed his delightful grounds, many different scenes naturally recalled the remem∣brance of Amelia. My friend, indeed, in order to avoid some of her favourite walks, had con∣ducted us an unusual road; but what corner could be found that did not bear the traces of her hand? Her elegant taste had
<PB N="185" REF="047559_0183_1023C594C3080FE0"/>
marked the peculiar beauty of each different scene, and had brought it forth to view with such a happy delicacy of art, as to make it seem the work of na∣ture alone. As we crossed cer∣tain paths in the woods, and passed by some rustic buildings, I could sometimes discern an emotion in my friend's co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nte∣nance; but he instantly stifled it with a firmness and dignity that made me careful not to seem to observe it.</P>
<P>Towards night, Mr. Went∣worth having stolen out of the room, his brother and I step∣ped out to a terrace behind the house. It was the dusk of the evening, the air was mild and serene, and the moon was rising in all her brightness from the cloud of the cast. The fineness
<PB N="186" REF="047559_0184_1023C597999AB3E8"/>
of the night made us extend our walk, and we strayed into a hollow valley, whose sides are covered with trees overhanging a brook that pours itself along over broken rocks. We ap∣proached a rustic grotto, plac∣ed in a sequestered corner, un∣der a half-impending rock. My companion stopped. "This," said he, <Q>was one of Amelia's walks, and that grotto was her favourite evening retreat. The last night she ever walk∣ed out, and the very evening she caught that fatal fever, I was with my brother and her, while we sat and read to each other in that very place.</Q>—While he spoke, we perceiv∣ed a man steal out of the grot∣to, and, avoiding us, take his way by a path through a thick∣et
<PB N="187" REF="047559_0185_1023A162D3CA0E28"/>
of trees on the other side. "It is my brother," said young Wentworth; <Q>he has been here in his Amelia's favourite grove, indulging that grief he so carefully conceals from us.</Q></P>
<P>We returned to the house, and found Mr. Wentworth with the rest of the company. He forc∣ed on some conversation, and even affected a degree of gentle pleasantry during the whole evening.</P>
<P>Such, in short, is the noble de∣portment of my friend, that, in place of finding it necessary to temper and moderate his grief, I must avoid seeming to per∣ceive it, and dare scarcely ap∣pear even to think of the heavy calamity which has befallen him. I too well know what he feels; but the more I know this, the
<PB N="188" REF="047559_0186_1023C59D68850430"/>
more does the dignity of his re∣collection and fortitude excite my admiration, and command my silent attention and respect.</P>
<P>How very different is this dig∣nified and reserved sorrow, from that weak and teazing grief which disgusts, by its sighs and tears, and clamorous lamentati∣ons? How much does such no∣ble fortitude of deportment call forth our regard and reverence? How much is a character in other respects estimable, degra∣ded by a contrary demeanor? How much does the excessive, the importunate, and unmanly grief of <HI>Cicero,</HI> diminish the ve∣ry high respect which we should otherwise entertain for the ex∣alted character of that illustrious Roman?</P>
<P>Writers on practical morality
<PB N="189" REF="047559_0187_1023C5A05E419330"/>
have described and analyzed the passion of grief, and have pre∣tended to prescribe remedies for restoring the mind to tranquilli∣ty; but, I believe, little benefit has been derived from any thing they have advised. To tell a person in grief, that time will relieve him, is truly applying no remedy; and to bid him reflect how many others there may be who are more wretched, is a very inefficacious one. The truth is, that the excess of this, as well as of other passions, must be prevented rather than cured. It must be obviated, by our at∣taining that evenness and equali∣ty of temper, which can arise only from an improved under∣standing, and an habitual inter∣course with refined society. These will not, indeed, exempt
<PB N="190" REF="047559_0188_1023C5A1E3453878"/>
us from the pangs of sorrow, but will enable us to bear them with a noble grace and proprie∣ty, and will render the presence of our friends (which is the on∣ly remedy) a very effectual cure.</P>
<P>This is well explained by a philosopher, who is no less elo∣quent than he is profound. He justly observes, that we natural∣ly, on all occasions, endeavour to bring down our own passions, to that pitch which those about us can correspond with. We view ourselves in the light in which we think they view us, and seek to suit our behaviour to what we think their feelings can go along with. With an intimate friend, acquainted with every circumstance of our situ∣ation, we can, in some measure, give way to our grief, but are
<PB N="191" REF="047559_0189_1023C5A4B48E6438"/>
more calm than when by our∣selves. Before a common <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣quaintance, we assume a greater sedateness. Before a mixed as∣sembly, we affect a still more considerable degree of compo∣sure. Thus, by the company of our friends at first, and af∣terwards, by mingling with so∣ciety, we come to suit our de∣portment to what we think they will approve of; we gradually abate the violence of our passion, and restore our mind to its wont∣ed tranquillity.</P>
