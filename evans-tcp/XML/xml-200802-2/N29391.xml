<P>SO Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab—And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days—And there arose not a pro∣phet since in Israel like unto Moses.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is well known to those of my hearers, who have ac∣customed themselves to attend the public administration<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Sanctuary, that it has not been my custom; nor do I approve of the practice of introducing political subjects in the house of God, on the Lord's Day: when subjects of supreme and divine importance may be furnished, for greater edification to the immortal mind. Nor do I de∣sign to introduce them upon this occasion, farther than their connexion, with the character of a great and good man, may require.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="039139_0004_1013EB92D700EE68"/>SHOULD I be entirely silent at this time, I might, and perhaps justly, be considered insensible of the obligations, which we owe one to another, wanting in respect to a great and illustrious character, and ungrateful to the Governor of the Universe, who alone raises up saviours and deliverers for his people.</P>
<P>THEN let me drop a tear, grateful to the memory of the man, who was favored of his God, and honorable in the sight of all the people; tho it be lost among the tears of thousands, whose hearts may be touched, with more pungent sorrow.</P>
<P>THE world, my Brethren, hath in every age, produ∣ced characters celebrated by fame: Conquerors, Tyrants, Philosophers or Lawgivers. But how rarely have the characters of the humane conqueror, a humble lawgiver, a submissive citizen, and a meek and humble christian been united in one man. When Tyrants fall, they are to be pityed, when wise Legislators, they are to be re∣gretted: But when men of this excellent combination of character, we, like the children of Israel, should weep, or like the devout men who carried Stephen to his buri∣al, make great lamentation over him.</P>
<P>THE character now described, and the duty to be practised, at the departure of such a man, if not fully ex∣pressed in the passage under consideration, may be farther illustrated under the following particulars.</P>
<P N="1">I. THE character of Moses as hereafter expressed, "And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses."</P>
<P N="2">II. THAT human greatness and excellency afford no exemption from Death.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="5" REF="039139_0005_1013EB946ADD82C0"/>III. THE duty of a people when characters eminent∣ly useful are removed.</P>
<P>IN pursuance of this plan we are in the</P>
<P N="1">1st place, To consider the Character of Moses. Here we may observe, many important circumstances coinci∣ded to render it truly illustrious. Possessed naturally of a sound penetrating mind, the foundation, and just prelude of his future greatness. Brought up in an empire, where the arts and sciences, then known, flourished to a great degree of perfection; and indulged with all the privile∣ges and advantages, which, such a high state of national improvement, could afford. And, whatever might be the system or principles, by which, the nation was gov∣erned, Moses must have been acquainted with them all. To which may be added, an opportunity of acquiring all the embellishments of the Egyptian Court.</P>
<P>THIS high state of refinement, in addition to his meek and placid temper, was, but truly, calculated to teach his heart to feel another's woe. To animate his soul with strong desires to be the deliverer of his brethren, from the Egyptian yoke.</P>
<P>NOW suffer me, for a moment, to lead your minds to consider the state of God's covenant people.—From the days of Joseph, God's people Israel, gradually, sunk into a state of slavery.—Having preserved themselves a distinct people, living within the jurisdiction of the E∣gyptian Court, and, under the blessing of divine provi∣dence, becoming very numerous; the jealousy of an im∣perious haughty nation was easily excited.—Pride, the foster parent of luxury and extravagance, desires un∣lawful means for its gratifications, and often leads to cruelty and oppression. The most suitable means, now to be devised, for its gratification, and the
<PB N="6" REF="039139_0006_1013EB9693938538"/>
subjection of this infant nation, were, to lay them under contribution. And to augment that tribute from time to time, till they should become complete slaves and vas∣sals. —But, however this might enrich her coffers, as it proved insufficient to check the progress of their growing numbers, recourse must be had to murder and destruction. —Thus reduced to the greatest distress and poverty, the situation of the house of Israel was truly helpless, defence∣less and forlorn.</P>
<P>AT this critical moment, God raised up a deliverer for his people.</P>
<P>HERE let us admire the power and wisdom of that God, under the superintendency of whose providence all things subsist; who alike feeds the oppressor and the op∣pressed: Yet assuredly, sees the affliction of his people, hears the cries of the oppressed, and comes down to de∣liver them from their enemies with a mighty hand and with a stretched out arm.—Nor are the instruments which he raises up and uses for affecting the great purpose of his providental Government, less worthy, honorable or deserving, for having received their power and com∣mission from God.</P>
<P>THO' the miraculous power of God wonderfully inter∣posed, yet the firmness and intrepidity of Moses was highly expressed in his conduct at the Egyptian Court. The imperiousness and power of the Egyptians, the pov∣erty, fears and prejudices of the Israelites, were circum∣stances, contributing equally to evince his valour and wis∣dom. —I need not particularize the instances of his wis∣dom and valour, at the Red sea, at the conquest of Ame∣lek, at Sinai, at Taberah, at Zin and Median.</P>
<P>NOR was his character less conspicuous as a <HI>legislator,</HI> than a leader of the host. No sooner had he brought the
<PB N="7" REF="039139_0007_1013EB98E5BAE3C8"/>
people through the red sea, and placed them in some de∣gree of safety, than he became intent upon the admini∣stration of justice. By the advice of Jethro his father in-law, he established a civil government, that justice might be more perfectly administered, long and deservedly held in high esteem. The method apparently met the divine approbation. Very soon, <HI>the Governor of the Universe</HI> called Moses to the top of Sinai, and committed to him <HI>that perfect code of moral precepts,</HI> which he afterwards delivered to the children of Israel. These, <HI>the great pole Star of Legislation,</HI> are of equal importance to direct the due execution of just and equitable laws, by proper con∣stituted authorities. Moses was the head of Legislative and Executive authorities, and from this period was in∣dulged with the most sensible and most frequent com∣munications from the Divine presence. Whom, ac∣cording to the sacred historian, <HI>the</HI> LORD <HI>knew face to face.</HI></P>
<P>WHILE <HI>Legislative</HI> and <HI>Military talents</HI> made him fa∣mous, <HI>meekness</HI> and the <HI>Christian graces</HI> rendered him ami∣able. However, in these and many others, he might be a type of the great CAPTAIN <HI>of our salvation,</HI> yet his character as a man was truly deserving.</P>
<P>THOUGH God raised up <HI>Joshuas</HI> to lead his hosts, and <HI>Samuels</HI> to judge his people, yet in no character have these talents been so agreeably united, <HI>for there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses.</HI></P>
<P>AND notwithstanding such a combination of the most excellent talents, as rarely centre in one man, yet they afford him no shield from calumny, nor shelter from the reproaches of an ungrateful rebellious people. That people often sinned against God, in murmuring against Moses, at the <HI>red sea,</HI> in the <HI>wilderness,</HI> at <HI>Sinai</HI> and the water of <HI>Meribah.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="039139_0008_1013EB9C31060C80"/>NOR are such talents a sufficient security against sin. Even <HI>Moses,</HI> after he had carried the children of Israel through the wilderness, with much patience and tribula∣tion, sinned against God at the waters of <HI>Meribah kadesh.</HI> But the Lord forgave him his sin. Notwithstanding he said, thou shalt see with thine eye, but shalt not pass over this Jordan, into the good land, whether the children of Isarel go to possess it. Therefore <HI>get thee up into this moun∣tain Abarim, into mount Nebo; and die in the mount whether thou goest up, and be gathered to thy people.</HI> Which leads us to consider in the</P>
<P N="2">2nd. place, THAT human greatness and excellency afford no exemption from death.</P>
<P>IF a single testimony could establish a truth, this had been sufficient. But we are not reduced to the necessity of relying on a single testimony. Our Fathers where are they, and the Prophets do they live forever? Death hath passed upon all men,—for death hath reigned from Adam until Moses—and from Moses until now.— Death stalks, alike unconcerned, over the Prince upon the throne, and the peasant in the cottage. Oh! thou relent∣less tyrant, wilt thou never be satisfied? Can no ties of nature or affection move you? Shall not the love, nay, I had almost said the adoration of millions make thee re∣lent? —Wilt thou pay no respect to the highest talents— to the greatest achievments—to the most essential services rendered to the world, nor to those christian graces which advance men near to the perfection of Angels? No!— no!—But rather like the envious fair, who eagerly des∣cries, and crops the finest flower!—</P>
<P>Will there never be an end?—O yes! my heart exults! That holy one, who led captivity captive, and re∣ceived gifts for men, shall disarm thee of all thy terrors,
<PB N="9" REF="039139_0009_1013EB9ECE740708"/>
and dispoil thee of all thy powers, for the last enemy which shall be conquered is Death. But in the mean time there is a suitable and proper temper to be exercised by the people of God. Which will lead me in the</P>
<P N="3">3d place, To consider the duty of a people when characters eminently useful are removed.—</P>
<P>THIS is expressed in the second paragraph in the text. <HI>"And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plain of Moab, thirty days."</HI></P>
<P>MANY and various methods have been adopted to ex∣press sorrow. By external deportment, sadness of the countenance, forms of dress, mournful sounds, and bitter lamentations. But none appear to be so natural, ration∣al or sincere as that of weaping. It is not certain, that every heart which is sincerely affected can express its sor∣row by a flowing tear. The heart may be so swelled with sorrow, as entirely to forbid the tear to flow. When, to give aloof to tears, would afford great relief to a bur∣dened soul. But men can rarely weep, except the heart is sensibly impressed. Hence it is considered as carry∣ing with it the highest evidence of sincere sorrow. That the grief of the children of Israel, at the removal of so great and amiable a character as Moses, was sincere, is hardly to be doubted. And we have still farther evidence of its sincerity, by its universality. It was not a few of the Elders of Israel, of the family connexions, or more intimate acquaintance and relations, who were affected by this dispensation, but the whole house and family of Israel. This was farther expressed by the long period which they devoted to sorrow and woe. However many in∣stances may be recorded in the Jewish History of long periods of sorrow and weeping, yet few, if any, have exceeded the present account; and few which have ex∣hibited
<PB N="10" REF="039139_0010_1013EBA0AFCEC8E8"/>
greater evidence of its propriety and sinceri∣ty.</P>
<P>DEATH, as the consequence of sin, hath given just oc∣casion of great sorrow. That sorrow, upon such occa∣sions, is a dictate of nature, is founded on experience. That it is a duty is made plain, by a train of divine ap∣probation and precepts. And that it is consistent with the most lively oracles of our holy religion, appears, from the illustrious comment which it received, from <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> at the Grave of Lazarus. Still my Brethren, this sorrow should bear some proportion to the magnitude of its exist∣ing cause. When Individuals die, <HI>friends, relatives</HI> and <HI>neighbours</HI> may weep. But when <HI>great</HI> &amp; <HI>illustrious Char∣acters</HI> fall, the <HI>fathers</HI> of the people, it becomes a <HI>whole na∣tion</HI> to put on garbs of the deepest humiliation.</P>
<P>I TRUST by this time, my hearers have formed some just idea of the improvement, I design to make of the present subject—</P>
<P>INDEED my Brethren, in many respects, our situation is not dissimilar from the children of Israel. They be∣wailed a <HI>Moses,</HI> we a WASHINGTON. A character, than whose, none can be more deservedly esteemed, nor any ought, more sincerely to be loved. Since the days of Moses, there hath not a character arisen, to grace the page of History, more unsullied, or, who hath a juster claim to honor and renown. A second Moses raised up of God, to be a deliverer of this American Israel.</P>
<P>MANY of you, on painful recollection, can remember, when your liberties were in danger. When you were oppressed by a great and powerful nation. A nation skilled in arts and wars: Who sat Mistress of the seas, and governed nations with a nod. A nation, whom suc∣cesses
<PB N="11" REF="039139_0011_1013D685B3B50B98"/>
had rendered lofty and imperious, and whom pride and haughtiness had made as listless to your entreaties, as the Egyptians to the miracles of Moses.</P>
<P>NOR can you fail to recollect the state of this infant nation. How weak, how defenceless? How unskilled in warlike atchievments? How helpless in the sight of the nations? Without were fightings, within were fears. This was our situation, when the <HI>Lord</HI> raised up a <HI>Cap∣tain</HI> for the host, added <HI>strength</HI> to his <HI>Courage, wisdom</HI> to his <HI>strength,</HI> and <HI>prowress</HI> to his <HI>wisdom.</HI> Made him a deliverer of his people. Repeated successes, and innu∣merable praises which would have elated the heart of any other man, seemed only calculated to teach him hu∣mility, and dependence on God. Such was the human∣ity and benevolence of this conqueror, as to put to silence the tongue of malice and envy.</P>
<P>NO sooner, under the providence of God, was the <HI>peace</HI> and <HI>Independence</HI> of this nation secured, than the eyes of all the people were upon him. By their united voice, he entered the Cabinet, with as much dignity, as he re∣tired from the field. There for years he held the reins of rising empire. Altho, there he displayed talents which have astonished the world, yet it could not be expected, but some, who were prejudiced in favor of the <HI>leeks</HI> and <HI>Onions</HI> of <HI>Egypt,</HI> or strongly attached to the <HI>idolatries</HI> of <HI>Canaan,</HI> would instigate a rebellion against him.</P>
<P>HOWEVER God may raise up in his successors, Joshu∣as to lead the host and Judges to rule the people; Yet they never can, under existing circumstances, nor ought they ever to expect, to arrive, at that degree of unsullied universal fame with their predecessor.</P>
<P>EVEN here, I know not whether most to admire, that
<PB N="12" REF="039139_0012_1013EBA70ADFDFE0"/>
train of shining talents expressed in the cabinet and field, or the dignity with which he retired from rising empire to private life. In this, he leaves on long record, an ex∣ample without precedent for the great. The eastern world may boast of an Alexander, Ceazar, Pompey, So∣lon or Lycurgus, but where is the man, in the meredian of life, on the summit of human greatness, at the head of empire; who freely did resign the reins of state, and retire with pleasure to the humble station of a private cit∣izen. In submitting himself to those laws, whose sig∣nature had rendered valid, he exhibited the most unques∣tionable evidence of his own integrity. He manifested himself a faithful imitator of his Lord and Master; in being willing to be governed by those laws which he had framed for his people.</P>
<P>FAIR Virtue shone—in this blessed retreat—to crown his name—But here alas! the joyful theme must end.</P>
<P>DISEASE was short, and his flight was rapid, lest the united prayer of Millions had prevailed, e're his fleeting spirit had reached the world of bliss. Methinks he sound all heaven in joy, but left the world in tears.</P>
<P>NOW boast thou Tyrant of thy superior conquest, for thou hast no more WASHINGTONS to conquer. Or rather say, his trust in God, disarm'd thee of thy ter∣rors, and resignation to the King of Saints, deprived thee of a conquest.</P>
<P>'TIS all the same to us, we mourn him dead. How happy when our duty and inclination coincide. Your solem garbs bespeak a heart of sorrow.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The House of God was dressed in deep mourning. Most of the inhabitants as they approach'd, joined and walked in solemn procession to the sanctuary, and generally wore some ex∣ternal badge of mourning.</NOTE> While your
<PB N="13" REF="039139_0013_1013EBA956497990"/>
external show is lost amidst the pomp of cities, and par∣ade of thousands, let not the sincerity of your sorrows be called in question. Nor let the tear of sorrow be dis∣guised, before the eye of him who tries the heart. Nor should your sighs be unattended by your prayers. These pious breathings, under God, a like affect the <HI>ruler</HI> and the <HI>subject.</HI> These are the best Armada for a defenceless Country. These inspire our hosts with fortitude and courage, for the most daring enterprizes: and fill our enemies with terror and dismay. These change the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness. These, under the plentiful effusions of the spirit of God, as have been poured out upon many of his churches, if continued, will render Zion a praise in the whole earth. Will make our <HI>Senators wisdom</HI> and our <HI>exactors</HI> righteousness. Will still tumults, settle divisions, heal animosities, and make us an humble obedient and happy people.</P>
<P>MAY he, who is the chosen head of this people, while he stands gazing at the ascent of his predecessor, catch the falling mantle, and be disposed to rule this people in obe∣dience to him, <HI>by whom Kings reign and princes decree jus∣tice.</HI></P>
<P>MAY he also, who is raised up to be the <HI>Joshua</HI> of our hosts, who hath accompanied our Moses thro' the trials of the wilderness, have the presence of that God, before whom the walls of Jericho were laid prostrate, and the waters of Jordan were drawn backward. And may that God, who hath hitherto compassed us with favor as with a shield, again fill our hearts with joy and gladness, <HI>through him that hath loved us and given himself to die for us.</HI></P>

<HEAD>AN APPENDIX, Giving a particular account of the behaviour of Gen. WASHINGTON, during his distressing illness, &amp;c. by two of his Physicians.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, (VIRGINIA,)
<DATE>DEC. 30.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>SOME time in the night of Friday the 13th inst. hav∣ing been exposed to a rain on the preceding day, Gene∣ral WASHINGTON was attacked with an inflammatory affection of the upper part of the windpipe, called in the technical language <HI>Cynache Trachealis.</HI> The disease commenced with a violent ague, accompanied with some pain in the upper and fore part of the throat, a sense of stricture in the same part, a cough, and a difficult, rather than a painful deglutition, which were soon succeeded by a fever, and a quick and laborious respiration. The necessity of bloodletting suggesting itself to the General, he procured a bleeder in the neighbourhood, who took from his arm in the night 12 or 14 ounces of blood. He could not by any means be prevailed on by the family to send for the attending physician till the following morning, who arrived at Mount-Vernon at about 11 o'clock on Saturday. Discovering the case to be highly
<PB N="15" REF="039139_0015_1013EBAD660CFB68"/>
alarming, and foreseeing the fatal tendency of the disease, two consulting physicions were immediately sent for, who arrived, one at half after three, and the other at four o'clock in the afternoon: in the mean time were employ∣ed two pretty copious bleedings, a blister was applied to the part affected, two moderate doses of calomel were given, and an injection was administered, which operated on the lower intestines, but all without any perceptible advantage, the respiration becoming still more difficult and distressing. Upon the arrival of the first of the con∣sulting physicians, it was agreed, as there were yet no signs of accumulation in the bronchial vessels of the lungs, to try the result of another bleeding, when about 32 ounces of blood were drawn, without the smallest apparent alleviation of the disease. Vapours of vinegar and water were frequently inhaled, ten grains of calomel were given, succeeded by repeated doses of emetic tar∣tar, amounting in all to 5 or 6 grains, with no other effect than a copious discharge from the bowels. The power of life seemed now manifestly yielding to the force of the disorder; blisters were applied to the ex∣tremities, together with a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of bran and vinegar to the throat. Speaking, which was painful from the beginning, now became almost impracticable; respira∣tion grew more and more contracted and imperfect, till at half after eleven on Saturday night, retaining the full possession of his intellects—when he expired without a struggle.</P>
<P>HE was fully impressed at the beginning of his com∣plaint, as well as through every succeeding stage of it, that its conclusion would be mortal; submitting to the several exertions made for his recovery, rather as a duty, than from any expectations of their efficacy. He con∣sidered the operations of death upon his system as coeval
<PB N="16" REF="039139_0016_1013EBB0A15518A8"/>
with the disease; and several hours his before death, after repeated efforts to be understood, succeeded in expressing a desire that he might be permitted to die without further interruption.</P>
<P>DURING the short period of his illness, he oeconomis∣ed his time, in the arrangement of such few concerns as required his attention, with the utmost serenity; and an∣ticipated his approaching dissolution with every demon∣stration of that equanimity for which his whole life has been so uniformly and singularly conspicuous.</P>
