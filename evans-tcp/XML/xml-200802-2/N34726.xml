<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>To those who are acquainted with the merit of Mr. Berquin's first publication, for the use of Children, which he justly entitled the</HI> CHILDREN'S FRIEND, <HI>it will be unnecessary to advance any other circumstance in favour of the following work, than that it is the production of the same Gentleman, by whom that elegant and moral performance was given to the world. Being calculated for the perusal of Children of a tender age, it naturally admitted a kind of Sequel or Counterpart, for the instruction and en∣tertainment of young persons, who are rather past the period of childhood, and yet may be supposed incapable of thinking for themselves. The following Sheets contain what has hitherto been published entire by the Author, on this plan, under the title of</HI> THE FRIEND OF YOUTH. <HI>It is necessary to be observed, that this work, in the original, came out, as did the</HI> Children's Friend, <HI>in detached periodical pieces, and therefore has not yet arrived at the ultimate point to which Mr. B. proposes to continue it. Nevertheless, it was thought more advis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able, to gratify the impatience of the public, with what is finished of in, than to wait the uncertain arrival of the little which remains to be added.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In order to make amends far this deficiency, what∣ever it may be, the Translator has joined the History of</HI> Little Grandison, <HI>(from which an extract is previ∣ously given in the first volume) to the pieces which com∣pose the Friend of Youth. It was translated from the Dutch by Mr. B. who found it to possess nearly the same spirit with his own works, and, therefore,</HI>
<PB N="iv" REF="045437_0003_101FFABF38B5A3A0"/>
<HI>judged it a proper present for those readers to whom be had dedicated his pen. This Gentleman's laudable industry, has led him to examine the productions of several modern languages, and from them, to select such as appeared to answer the purpose which he had in view. Among the rest, he has introduced, in the fol∣lowing collection, a piece or two from the English, of which it will be sufficient to observe, that they are here inserted in the language of the several originals to which they belonged, as being obviously the most natu∣ral dress that they could assume, and beyond compari∣son, the most satisfactory to an English reader. No translation can be supposed capable of conveying the spirit and freedom of the original: and this would be found particularly to be the case in the latter of the pieces alluded to,</HI> The Narrative of a Shipwreck on the Island of Cape-Breton, <HI>which opens the se∣cond volume. The subject of this narrative being partly nautical, it would be sound to suffer considera∣bly, and appear to much less advantage, if delivered in any other style than the English, in which it was first composed. Indeed, the absurdity of transla∣ting from a foreign language, what would be read with infinitely more satisfaction as an original, is so apparent, that it does not require any further comment.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If a critical inspection of this work should discover some of the pieces, in their present form, to contain, now and then, a slight improbability, it will, no doubt, be attributed to its real cause, the difference of national manners. The effect of this circumstance is so important, that a small defect of probability could not absolutely be avoided in some cases, without mili∣tating against both the intent and moral of the Au∣thor,
<PB N="v" REF="045437_0004_101FFAC1C7AB3DD8"/>
as well as deranging the whole plot and conduct of many of his pieces. An imperfection, which will always be found to subsist inherently in every perform∣ance like the following, where it is proposed to adopt, for instance, French manners and actions to English characters. A copyist in painting, would, probably, often find it a difficult task to support the propriety of any particular action represented in a picture, were he obliged to alter the</HI> costumé <HI>of the figures exhi∣bited in the original. Thus, it may be presumed, the picture of an Augustan Triumph would not so strong∣ly impress the spectator with an idea of grandeur, were the personages in the procession habited like Dutchmen: or, on the other hand, if a company of Roman Senators were represented as busily engaged in the fantastical chace of a Pantomime, the mummery of the action would no longer be preserved, but must unavoidably be overclouded with a cast of solemnity un∣natural to it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Imaginary actions, therefore, when adapted to one particular national character, are not easily transfer∣able; or, whenever it is attempted to make them so, either the action or the character, is liable to suffer a partial disguise, and be seen, as it were, through a mist. In such a case, they will, neither of them, af∣fect the imagination of the reader with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>ively a force, as when they appear with the advantage of their orginal congruity. But this observation applies more conspicuously to Novels, where a single moral results from a series of complicated actions intersper∣sed, perhaps, with a variety of episodes appending to the main story. I know not whether</HI> Gil Blas, <HI>the</HI> Fortunate Villager, <HI>and a few other novels, may not be adduced as instances to elucidate what has been a∣bove
<PB N="vi" REF="045437_0005_101FFAC352569C50"/>
remarked: but in a work like the present, con∣sisting of short pieces, in which we quickly arrive at the moral, and find it generally to constitute the most leading feature, it is not so difficult to accommodate the manners and actions of each personage, to the ge∣neral uniformity of human life, and to divest them of that</HI> nationality <HI>which would be more observable in narrative pieces of greater extent.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Upon the whole, it lies with the judicious reader to determine, whether any considerable offences against verisimilitude occur, in the following collection. The Translator hopes he has reason to console himself in the reflection, that he has used all possible diligence to avoid any such; and if, notwithstanding his endeavours, the censure of criticism should fasten on a few imperfecti∣ons of this nature,</HI> quas aut incuria fudit,</P>
<P>Aut humana parum cavit Natura, <HI>he has only to shelter himself behind the well-earned reputation of the Author, whose labours, so eminently beneficial to youth in general, he has endeavoured par∣ticularly to adapt to the improvement of the rising ge∣neration in this country.</HI></P>

THE FRIEND OF YOUTH.</HEAD>
<DIV1 TYPE="essay">
<HEAD>THE FICKLE YOUTH.</HEAD>
<P>JACK WHIRLER was endowed, by nature, with a happy memory, a ripe understanding, and a lively, active, and fruitful imagination. Fortune seemed to ensure the accomplishment of every hope, that could be founded upon so pro∣mising qualities, by allotting him parents, whose warmest wishes ever were, to cultivate, in their son, that pregnancy of parts, which he had re∣ceived from the hands of nature. An extraor∣dinary quickness of apprehension had advanced him, considerably, in his tender studies, at an early period, and he was already eager to unite the ornament of exterior accomplishments, to the more solid acquirement of mental instruction.</P>
<P>It happened, that, on a visit to one of his young companions, he found him engaged in drawing a Roman head, which, from the charac∣teristic greatness of the countenance, impressed him with the most lively sentiments of admira∣tion. As his friend advanced toward the finish∣ing of his portrait, young Whirler felt these sen∣timents grow in his mind with additional ardor. Some other pieces, which the room afforded in the same style, completely inspired him with such
<PB N="10" REF="045437_0008_101FFAE0A2599828"/>
an enthusiasm as Raphael experienced on first taking the pencil in his hand.</P>
<P>He returned home at full speed, and, meeting his father on the stairs, he threw his arms fond∣ly round him, and requested him to go immedi∣ately, and engage him a drawing master. His father, charmed with the earnestness that he ex∣pressed, was easily induced to gratify this desire. They went, therefore, together, to the most ce∣lebrated master in town; and Jack Whirler would have been happy, could he have prevailed on him to give up all his other pupils, and confine his instructions to him alone, from morning to night. As he could not obtain this sacrifice, he insisted, however, that each lesson should conti∣nue, at least, two hours every day. He had no conception, how any one could refrain from de∣voting every moment of his life, to the cultiva∣tion of so divine an art.</P>
<P>His master was not to come until the next day. I will not tell you how many faces he had sketched before night. His port-folio was already full of beads, drawn in every possible variety of character, though you will certainly excuse him, if they did not discover that correctness which is the result of lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> practice. There was, perhaps, a large eye, to match a small one, in the same face; the nose was made, sometimes, to rise out from the middle of the forehead, and the ear would come to hear the mouth, or the mouth to bite the ear, across the whole breadth of the cheek: but, except these trifling faults, his performance had all the correctness that could be reasonably expected.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="045437_0009_1020273828C45EF0"/>
He had, himself, prepared an enormous sheet of paper, the largest that was to be had in town. This was soon found too small to contain the number of eyes, ears, arms and legs, that he had sketched out under the direction of his mas∣ter. The hospitals of Greenwich and Chelsea, would here have met with excellent patterns to replace all the lost members of those honest ve∣terans who inhabit them. His natural impati∣ence was a little fretted by the tedious sameness of those essays, to which, his first lessons were ri∣gidly confined, in order to steady his hand. As soon, therefore, as he was alone, he launched out freely, beyond the bounds of this slow pro∣cess, aspiring already in idea, to the execution of complete and grand pictures. The garret-walls had been newly white-washed; he formed the design of painting them with the history of Rome, which he was just then reading at school; and, in effect, at the week's end, there appeared drawn upon them, in charcoal, a comely successi∣on of heads and busts of tribunes and of con∣suls, with dictators a-foot, and emperors on horseback; and I doubt not, that if the names had been placed under their respective figures, in order to render them perfect resemblances, an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>quary might have found means to bring forth a number of interesting and learned remarks, touching this gallery.</P>
<P>He was proposing to himself to represent, in the same style of execution, the progress of our history, down from the conquest, when he one day found his whole work effaced by the servants,
<PB N="12" REF="045437_0010_10202739B5416858"/>
who pretended, that these Roman heroes upon the wall only frightened the cats, but did not drive the mice away. This mishap a little aba∣ted the ardor of his passion for drawing: his disappointment at seeing himself still far behind his young friend, whom he had expected at his first attempt to overtake, alienated still more his liking for the art. He presently grew fearful of dirtying his fingers with the chalks, or, of making gaps in his pen-knife, by cutting them. His master, who at first had so much trouble to moderate his eagerness, now found it a more difficult task to re-animate it. In vain, did he enumerate to him the wonderful effects of paint∣ing; and the curious anecdotes that are found in the lives of the great artists. He had introduced to him, a pupil of his, just returned from Rome; on purpose to entertain him with an account of the superb paintings that he had seen and studied in Italy. This young gentleman, in expressing his admiration of those performances, made use of Italian words, either as being more ready, or more significant; the founds were new to Jack Whirler's ears; and it struck him in a moment, that to speak so melodious a language was a much finer thing, than to draw heads; which, let them be ever so expressive, could not talk. He ran immediately to communicate this reflection to his father, who, though grieved to see him thus quit an agreeable accomplishment, of which he had before been so passionately desirous, did not however chuse to oppose this new taste of his; and the next day, Jack Whirler had an Italian master, in the room of his teacher in drawing.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="045437_0011_1020273B6A224910"/>
I must do Jack the justice thus publicly to de∣clare that his progress for the first two or three days kept pace with his resolution. Every gram∣matical difficulty gave way to the quickness of his comprehension. He grew fond to enthusi∣asm of a language so full of sweetness and har∣mony; and was incessantly talking it to the peo∣ple of the family, without troubling his head whether they could understand it. He addressed the cockmaid with <HI>Vostra Signoria,</HI> and called the gardener <HI>Cor mio.</HI> The Italian translation of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Tragedy of Cato, written by Mr. Addison, was translated into Italian by Salvini, and acted at Flo∣rence.</NOTE> Cato became as familiar to him as the original. In examining his father's library for authors in this language, he laid his hands by chance on a Spanish Don Quixote. Don Quixote! the fa∣vorite of his earliest studies! Oh! what a plea∣sure to be able to taste the droll proverbs of his honest 'squire, when seasoned with all the hu∣mour of their native language! Cato's grave so∣liloquy was not to be compared to the delectable sallies of Sancho; nor the little senate of Uti∣ca, to the council-chamber of the Baratarian go∣vernor. This undertaking, however, required courage. Here he was to engage incessantly with strange words, like the knight of the rueful vi∣llage with windmills and flocks of sheep. He came off, however, with at least as much honor as the knight in this first campaign. But will you believe me? Before the hero of La Mancha had sallied forth a second time in quest of adven∣tures,
<PB N="14" REF="045437_0012_1020273CFB690BA0"/>
Jack Whirler had quitted the Spanish to learn French, which he soon gave up in order to study the German. So that at the end of the year he was already a smatterer in four living lan∣guages, but so imperfect was he in each, and jumbled them together in his discourse after such a fashion, that he should have had an audience composed of deputies from these different nati∣ons, to interpret one to the other the unconnect∣ed scraps and phrases that each might happen to understand in his conversation.</P>
<P>Dexterity in exercises of the body seems to lend both help and ornament to a well cultivated mind, and the most extensive knowledge will not atone for awkwardness, in the eyes of the fairer part of society. Jack Whirler had met with a disagreeable proof of this, at a ball which was given by his papa on some particular occasion. In the course of this, Jack, notwithstanding his erudition, had put all the dancers out several times. He therefore resolved to instruct himself in the principles of this agreeable art; but scarce∣ly had he begun the minuet steps, when his head ran upon the rigadoon, and nothing else. What he most earnestly wished to learn in each lesson was exactly the part of dancing that he should not be taught as yet. Always eager after what he did not know, and dissatisfied with what he had learned, he could lay up nothing in his me∣mory with the least order. Thus he would sometimes <HI>figure in</HI> when he should <HI>cross over,</HI> and <HI>shuffle</HI> when he should <HI>sink.</HI> He found no diffi∣culty in dancing the hays when the company set out with a cotillion, nor had he ever occasion for
<PB N="15" REF="045437_0013_1020273EB9FCCD88"/>
a change of time in the music to start off him∣self in a Scotch reel, while he left his partner moving a minuet.</P>
<P>All this, it may be supposed, produced no small confusion among the young people his companions of the dance; in order therefore to reinstate himself in the favor of the ladies, which he had lost by this absent and volatile dis∣position, he set about learning music, that he might be able to accompany either the voice or the harpsichord. But what instrument should he attempt first? To take his word for it, there was nothing easier in the world than to practise them all at once. However his father did not think proper to risk this experiment, and gave him only the liberty of chusing his instrument. While he was uncertain as to this point, the vi∣olin seemed a proper one to take in hand by way of trial, and it was not till six months after, that he fixed his choice decidedly on the flute, just as he began to attempt an open shake, and to bow with tolerable steadiness.</P>
<P>In the mean time his father grew somewhat uneasy on observing this unsettled and change∣able disposition of his son, though a parent's fond∣ness induced him to attribute the fault to youth alone. With a view therefore to advance the improvement of his understanding by observation and experience, he determined to send him upon a tour to the continent. Jack Whirler desired no better than to shift the scene. The narra∣tives of travellers had always been a favorite reading with him, and his imagination had a thousand times transported him to the countries
<PB N="16" REF="045437_0014_10202747A844A7A0"/>
which they describe. A young friend of his, who was just returned from France, gave him so favorable an account of the reception that he had found in that country, and drew so pleas∣ing a picture of the improved state of arts and society there; described in so warm terms the engaging vivacity and elegance of the ladies, with the frank and open politeness of the men; offered him such flattering letters of recommen∣dation to some of the nobility at Paris, equally eminent for exalted talents and amiable qualities; in fine, the happy effects already produced by the commercial union of the two nations, and the prospect opened to both of enriching themselves by a free and reciprocal interchange of their pro∣ductions, and of preserving the repose of Europe by the envied example of their happiness, as well as by the terror of their arms; all these ideas, united in description, did so inflame his natural enthusiasm, that he could not contain his desire of visiting that polite nation; nor was it possible to moderate his joy, when the moment arrived that he was to set out, under the direc∣tion of a preceptor, equally remarkable for his good sense and attachment to the family of his pupil.</P>
<P>One should have viewed the extensive plains of Picardy, interspersed with the agreeable land∣scape of distant hamlets, or sloping hills crown∣ed with orchards and hopyards in full bloom, to conceive the impression which this enchanting sight produced on the mind of our young travel∣ler. Even the rapidity of <HI>his</HI> imagination could scarcely keep pace with the succession of striking
<PB N="17" REF="045437_0015_1020274935CE0C40"/>
objects which his tour afforded. A continued rapture of admiration conducted him to the gates of Paris, where it was still further heigh∣tened by a view of the superb palaces and other magnificent buildings which adorn that capital. The first few days after his arrival, he spent in viewing every quarter of it. The grandeur of the public edifices, the innumerable concourse of inhabitants, the delicious gardens which abound both in the city and its environs, the splendor and elegance that shone in the dresses of the no∣bility, the sightly decorations of their places of public resort, and the unbounded festivity that reigns in their private and convivial circles; all these charms united, might be supposed, with the addition of novelty, to produce sensations pro∣portionable to the ardour and susceptibility which young Whirler's imagination possessed.</P>
<P>So they did at first; but the impression, lively as it was, soon vanished. His eager curiosity once satisfied, he felt this passion succeeded by languor and satiety. His tutor perceived it, and proposed to him to visit some of the provinces. Jack Whirler, in the height of his joy, could on∣ly answer him by pressing entreaties to engage a post-chaise for that purpose against the next day.</P>
<P>I shall not follow them in the whole of their excursion, for fear of growing tiresome to my young reader; I will only stop with them a mo∣ment at Salency, a town celebrated for the per∣formance of a ceremony the most affecting and singular, that perhaps the whole world can afford, in this age of degeneracy. There the younger female inhabitants are early inspired with the
<PB N="18" REF="045437_0016_1020274C2BDEF500"/>
love, and encouraged in the practice of truth, probity, and innocence. She who is by univer∣sal consent pronounced the most virtuous maiden of the village, receives from the hands of its il∣lustrious proprietor a crown of roses; which ho∣nour is conferred once a year, on a day that is observed as a festival from the public celebration of the custom; and this ornament, simple as it is, bath more powerful and universal effect on the morals of the rising generation, particularly the female part of the peasantry of Salency, than the most laboured or ostentatious panegy∣ric, the warmest effusions of popular applause, or in fine, than any other incentive whatsoever, up∣on those of their superior; in rank and under∣standing. There virtue and merit are habitually revered, and the acquisition of the rose garland, the reward of unblemished same and purity of manners, is viewed with more honest and more justly founded emulation, than trophies of mili∣tary prowess, or the tinsel decoration and titles of a statesman, can excite in the bosoms of the great.</P>
<P>Objects attractive and interesting surrounded Jack Whirler in every part of his tour; he found every where a sufficient variety of matter both for instruction and amusement; but it was the misfortune of his disposition never to wish for anything but what was out of his reach, and ne∣ver to think any place agreeable, unless he were a hundred leagues distant from it. What most employed his thoughts during this tour in France, was, (as he sometimes termed it in a rapture) his <HI>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> Italy. In the Louvre at Paris, he looked
<PB N="19" REF="045437_0017_1020274F191639D8"/>
round for the Roman Capital, or the Temple of the Sun, and was now sighing for the shattered villages of Calabria in the midst of the vineyards of Champagne. His tutor had tried all possible means to cure him of this restlessness, but soon became apprehensive, left his endeavours to that purpose should only serve to throw his pupil into a consumption, and therefore he seconded the re∣quest which the latter had made to his father for permission to set out for this same Italy, which he now longed to behold as much as ever the wan∣dering Trojans did in the days of yore.</P>
<P>Except in crossing the channel, all Jack Whir∣ler's travels had hitherto been upon dry land, and it was now two months since he had begun mea∣suring the post-roads of France. This was e∣nough to put him out of humour with all tra∣velling unless by sea. His tutor conceived hopes of bringing him to a reasonable disposition by a∣greeing to the experiment, and pretended to re∣lish it as much as he did. They embarked there∣fore at Marseilles, on board a vessel bound to Leghorn.</P>
<P>Jack Whirler passed the first day entirely upon deck, where he could not help admiring the waves of the sea, which were gently impelled by the wind, and seemed to come in playful succession sporting round the ship's sides. The next day he was still so clever in his own eyes for having had the courage to undertake this expedition, that his self-complacent reflexions on the subject kept off the approaches of satiety. But the third day, both his agreeable musing on the beau∣ties of the sea, and his satisfaction in thinking so
<PB N="20" REF="045437_0018_102027536AFD3020"/>
highly of himself, quite forsook him. Nothing remained but the wearisome disgust that he felt in the sameness of his voyage. He now longed to be on shore, all the wishes of his heart were directed towards the land: but unfortunately it was too far off to gratify his caprice. Nor did old ocean seem to use any extraordinary haste in transporting him to the term of his wishes, so that he was obliged to be patient, or rather (as his temper inclined him) to be out of patience, until the ship's arrival at her port.</P>
<P>Happy power of imagination, which, through the sweet illusions of hope, steals from us the remembrance of our troubles! Jack Whirler forgot all his at his landing. He was now at length happily arrived in that famous country, the store∣house of all the riches both of nature and art. After reposing himself two days at Leghorn, he set out for Florence. He knew that the famous gallery of paintings in that city made it the re∣sort of travellers, many of whom, even after continually viewing it for six months, found their curiosity still unsatisfied, and remained in town in spite of their resolutions of departing every day. This did not seem so strange to him at his first casting his eye upon that superb col∣lection of master-pieces. Perhaps he would even have remained in the same mind until he had got to the end of the gallery, if it had not been for the idea of St. Peter's at Rome, and the Vatican Library, that just then struck him. These two edifices took up his thoughts the whole day, and presented themselves in unbounded magnificence to his imagination. In order to form a decisive
<PB N="21" REF="045437_0019_102027565A35A3F8"/>
estimate of their splendour and dimensions, he pressed his tutor that same evening to set off for Rome. Never tell me of those tedious travellers that pry without end, and take an age to exa∣mine any remarkable object! Jack Whirler, in three days, had seen every thing that was curious in the antient capital of the world, and had even some of that time to spare, which he employed in putting together his baggage for a trip to Na∣ples, whither he was already transported in idea. It was not however the particular beauties of this latter place which excited his curiosity so strong∣ly; he had lately, it is true, passed through many magnificent cities, but all that he had hi∣therto seen were above the surface of the earth, whereas Herculaneum and Pompeia were buried in its bowels. Cities under ground were all that he now thought worth his notice. The roman∣tic fruitfulness of his imagination formed to him a thousand pictures of the terrible event which had reduced them to that state. He was sur∣prised, on going down amongst their ruins, to find that he had fallen in love with a heap of rub∣bish; for he saw nothing more at that time, notwithstanding the many curious remains of antiquity that have been discovered among them. Another would at least have found some consolation in admiring, at Naples, one of the finest harbours in Europe, but Jack Whirler could not help contrasting it with those of Am∣sterdam, Portsmouth, or Constantinople; which appeared to him much finer, because they were at a distance. As to that burning mountain which commands the town of Naples, and makes
<PB N="22" REF="045437_0020_10202757E777F548"/>
its situation awful, as well as picturesque, by in∣cessantly threatening to bury it in ashes and flames; did not all travellers allow AEtna to be far before Vesuvius? Certainly; and the dread∣ful effects of its last eruption conveyed to his mind every idea of terror and admiration that a vul∣cano can excite. Thus in that dear country which Jack Whirler had so earnestly desired to visit, there remained but one single town, the sight of which could recompense the fatigues of his journey. This was Venice, so singularly different from all the other cities, rising from the middle of a huge morass, with her canals, her gondolas, and her five hundred bridges. To ar∣rive there, he must travel, it is true, the whole length of Italy, but his imagination, as it was bold in smoothing every obstacle, so it was clear-sighted in shortening every distance, and he only waited to have his portmanteau packed up, that he might take the road towards Venice.</P>
<P>I am afraid, my young friends, that you have before now suspected his tutor to have been too tamely complaisant, as you have seen him give way to all his pupil's whims. I see that to jus∣tify him, I must here discover to you a family se∣cret, reposing at the same time the strictest confi∣dence in your discretion. During the whole of his tour, Jack Whirler had written home regu∣larly to his father, who remarked, that his letters always expressed a sort of disgust for the place from which they were dated, while he seemed in raptures with that which he was next to visit: thus it appeared that every country, though it presented him at a distance with flattering pro∣spects,
<PB N="23" REF="045437_0021_1020275C2B955558"/>
never failed to send him away tired and disappointed. These remarks, confirmed by those of his son's tutor, which after what you have read, you may easily imagine were quite to the same effect, gave him to understand, that his son was not of a temper or frame of mind cal∣culated to receive much improvement from tra∣velling. However, he did not chuse, by hastily recalling him, to furnish him with a pretext for complaining at a future period, that he had there∣by lost the opportunity of improvement. He barely recommended to the tutor not to oppose his son's changeable whims, which would of themselves be sufficient to bring him home in a short time. Thus Jack Whirler, after he had seen Venice, Turin, Switzerland and Flanders, all at full speed, did now, in a fresh fit of incon∣stancy, wish for no more than to return to his own fire-side, even before the time which he him∣self had stipulated.</P>
<P>A parent never forgets that name: you may imagine, therefore, what Mr. Whirler felt at the return of his son. But why have I not here those transports of joy to describe to you, which possess a father's heart, when a child, worthy of his warmest affection, is restored to him after ab∣sence? Why can I not represent them to you, clasped in each other's arms, speechless with joy, and mixing their tears together; the father proud of the new accomplishments that he observes in his son, and the latter happy to shew them to ad∣vantage before the eyes of a parent, as the pro∣perest return that he could make to his fatherly affection and good wishes? How happy should I
<PB N="24" REF="045437_0022_1020275F1FA691D0"/>
have been to lay before you so touching a scene, even though it should lose by my description! You would at least, as well as your parents, have observed in it, with pleasure, the artless expressi∣on of those sentiments with which you feel your∣selves mutually affected. It was in Jack Whirl∣er's power to have made us all thus happy, by a better improvement of the attention that had been paid to his earlier years. Nothing would have been wanting to his education, either as to learning or accomplishments, if he could have had the resolution to conquer the restlessness of his disposition, and confine himself to a more constant and uniform course of application. In∣stead of that fickle taste which hurried him from one study to another, wading through the diffi∣culties that render the beginning of each dry and disagreeable, and never taking time to enjoy the satisfaction which a more advanced progress affords; instead of those delusions of fancy, which dressed out distant objects in a flattering manner, only to make those which were present, appear in more unfavorable colours; instead of being perpetually disgusted and out of humour with the saint, unsatisfactory ideas, which a close inspection afforded him, of objects that his ima∣gination had exaggerated while at a distance; what a fund of sincere pleasing ideas might he have laid up for himself! Not to mention the delight which a youth of spirit feels in outstrip∣ping the expectations of his family, how great would have been his satisfaction in this import∣ant respect, that the first and strongest principle of nature would have made his improvement the
<PB N="25" REF="045437_0023_10202760ABA32480"/>
source of happiness to his parents, in the most exquisite degree!</P>
<P>You have seen Jack Whirler, from his child∣hood equally fond of learning and agreeable ac∣complishments, set out in pursuit of them with the most unbounded eagerness, and thinking to carry every thing at the first attempt, struggle gallantly with the most disheartening difficulties for a while, and then give up the contest at the very moment when he was about to get the bet∣ter of them. In addition to his natural desire of knowledge, and the encouraging applause of his parents, had he been endowed with a little more command over himself, he might have ac∣quired every thing that would add ornament as well as happiness to his future life. His reason early matured by study, and his taste for agreeable relaxations would have preserved his youth from that restlessness which torments him, and from that wearisome disgust which he conceives to every object that becomes once familiar to him. From his acquaintance with both the principles and practice of the fine arts, he would have looked upon nothing with indifference in the course of his travels. The view of those master∣pieces of art which foreign countries afford, while it gratified his curiosity, would have improved his taste. His understanding would have been enlightened by the variety of objects that met his view, his judgment corrected by studying their differences and relations, his knowledge of the world enlarged by observing the manners and characters of men in different countries. Strangers, flattered with the desire which
<PB N="26" REF="045437_0024_10202763ED8D8B78"/>
a youth of education testifies to visit their country, conceive the most advantageous pre∣judice in his favor, and receive him with the politest attention. Thus admitted into every distinguished circle, he might have done honour to his name and country, by that manly frankness and sincerity of manners which I would recom∣mend to my young countrymen as the most essential accompaniment to politeness, inasmuch as it certainly best conciliates friendship, esteem, and respect. He would have returned home re∣gretted by those whom he had left, welcomed by his former friends, and doubly so by his parents, to whom he would then have afforded the most reasonable ground of hope for his future success in life.</P>
<P>How far was Jack Whirler from this happy situation, to which his circumstances seemed so naturally to lead him! In all the towns through which he had travelled at full speed, his con∣versation was chiefly with the landlords of the hotels where he took a short repose after the fatigues of riding post. His countrymen had little to promise themselves from the feeble stock of information that he had collected; his father saw all his hopes disappointed; and his friends—but his fickleness was inconsistent with such a re∣lation—Jack Whirler had no friends. Unhappy youth! I pity him when I think, my dear Ho∣ratio, that our friendship was formed at an age as tender; our friendship, which has never since wavered a single moment, and which would now, as in the first warmth of its commencement, lead us to unite our lives and fortunes, and share them
<PB N="27" REF="045437_0025_1020276857C05280"/>
for the future equally and inseparably! Sweet moments of our youth! when the same senti∣ments and inclinations drew our hearts together by every tie that could bind them. How swiftly did the days glide away between our studies, and the free intercourse of our sentiments! Every pleasure, every pain was felt by both in common. Always together in town, together in the coun∣try; for eight years we felt it necessary to our happiness to be so, and what tears did our sepa∣ration cost us! At this day, if we chance to wan∣der to those charming walks by the side of a pleasant rivulet, or up some romantic hill, where formerly, with a Shakespeare, a Fenelon, or a Goldsmith in our hands, we so oft enjoyed at once the charms of friendship, of poetry, and of nature, how pleasing still to find our mutual sen∣timents ever the same, and to repose in a firm confidence that nothing but death can extinguish them in us.</P>
<P>O you, my young readers, who are witnesses to this effusion of my heart, if you have a friend like mine, if you love him, and are beloved by him as I am, you will pardon it. Besides, have I not a right of speaking to you concerning what∣ever interests my feelings? Otherwise I should have assumed in vain, the title under which I of∣fer you this work. Whatever affects either you or me, can never henceforward be indifferent to the other party. We are united by ties that can never be broken on either side, without a gross want of gratitude. If the care which I take in forming your hearts and understandings have any value in your eyes, I on my side owe you my
<PB N="28" REF="045437_0026_1020276B9909ED68"/>
warmest acknowledgments. Thanks to you, all nature looks gay and smiling round me; for my fancy places me in the midst of your pleasing countenances, on which innocence, chearfulness and candor, are painted so expressively. It is from your own mouths that I catch those artless sallies which make you smile, and those senti∣ments of tenderness and generosity that cause your tears to flow, or impress your young breasts with an early sense of honor. Would I could present you to my country, accomplished objects of her warmest hopes!</P>

<P>Do you give the name of ceremony to your duty? This shews you as heedless as u∣sual: but the young Lady's behaviour does not shew that reserve or discretion that I could wish in the person whom you desire to make your friend. I think, she should have waited for my invitation:</P>

<P>How can she know me? I never saw her but once, and then by chance at a third person's.</P>
</SP>

<P>Well, that interview was enough to form her opinion of you. She has drawn so fa∣vorable a picture of your good qualities, that I shall be always proud of having such a mother.</P>

<P>I shall be apt to fear that she did not reckon diffidence among the number of your happy qualities.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps you are joking, and yet she was almost tempted to chide me for having too much. However, she agreed at the last, that dif∣fidence was more necessary to me than another, to disarm the envy of such as do not possess e∣qual accomplishments.</P>

<P>Have you been often in her com∣pany?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Only twice, with the Miss Delmores, at their house. She has a great deal of friend∣ship for them, but they do not seem sufficiently to return it. Do you think that the Miss Del∣mores possess much penetration? I have visited them these four years, and in that time they have not been able to know me as perfectly as Miss Bland in three days.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>What makes you imagine so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because they have sometimes taken upon them to find little defects in me, which, however, I flatter myself do not belong to me. I should suppose them to be something envious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>It happens pretty often that <HI>I</HI> take the same liberties with you. Do you imagine me also to be jealous of your merit?</P>

<P>Oh! that is quite different. You on∣ly speak to me out of friendship, and for my good; But—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why cannot you suppose your friends to have the same motive? Without be∣ing so strongly interested in your improvement as your own family, may they not wish it neverthe∣less very affectionately, in order that you may be more worthy a continuance of that intimacy

which has subsisted between you from your child∣hood? Besides, I know them sufficiently to be convinced, that in their remarks and advice to you, they have always preserved the discretion of friendship.</P>

<P>But then they chid me for such trifles.</P>

<P>Your self-love is ingenious enough to impeach their delicacy; however, I see for my part, stronger reason from their behaviour, for your valuing their attachment. I am persuaded that nobody in the world, next to your relations, can be more worthy of a distinguished place in your friendship.</P>

<P>Pardon me, madam, I cannot tell how to express my admiration of your cha∣racter. Look where I will, I find none that can be compared with your ladyship: and, as to Miss Downright, what young lady of her age can dis∣pute the palm with her for wit, grace, or accom∣plishments! I am not apt to be blindly partial even to those that I esteem; for instance, I have the greatest friendship for the Miss Delmores, and wish to shut my eyes to all their faults, but how awkward, stiff, and inanimate they are when compared to your daughter!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>You certainly forget that they are her friends, and that this description of them cannot be agreeable to us, particularly as they by no means deserve it. Besides, I hear that you have a thousand times complimented them on their agreeable qualities, and that in the most pompous style.</P>
</SP>

I see every reason not to delay a moment longer what I have to say to her, concerning the danger of silly cre∣dulity, as well as the meanness of servile flattery, and I should fear that such topics might not be agreeable to you.

Did not she speak in the same style to the Miss Delmores, and have not you heard how she treated them? Did you not mark with what unnatural adulation she would have com∣plimented me at the expence of her own mother?

That she might rule you with more absolute domini∣on, did she not endeavour to alienate your friend∣ship from two amiable young ladies, by ridicul∣ing them, or by hinting them to be secretly envi∣ous of these imaginary perfections that she as∣cribed to you? Had she succeeded in thus intox∣icating

<STAGE>(embracing her tenderly.)</STAGE>
<P>Yes, my dear, we are now re-united for ever. I perceiv∣ed your surprize at seeing me treat Miss Bland with so much freedom and seeming incivility, but you know that all my happiness is centered in you; judge then of my feelings, when I saw it so near being embittered by her seducing arts. You have as yet no idea of the unhappy condition of a woman who is early spoiled by flattery. Com∣ing into the world with pretensions that nothing can justify, and an opinion of her own merit, in which nobody else joins her, what mortifica∣tions must she experience! As to the homage that she expected, the more her pride exacts it, the more she finds it withheld, and the sneer of contempt supply its place. If, blinded as she is with self-opinion, a transient ray of reflexion should enlighten her for a moment, and shew her the true state of herself, what shame must she feel on finding herself destitute of a claim to those qualities which she imagined herself to possess, and what regret at having lost the oppor∣tunities
<PB N="37" REF="045437_0035_10202784B93631C8"/>
of acquiring them! On what should she, for the future, found her pretensions to public esteem, to the love of her husband, or the respect of her family? To stifle the reproaches of her mind, as well as the troublesome consciousness of her own want of merit, she can suffer none a∣bout her, but despicable flatterers of the same stamp with those who first corrupted her under∣standing; and, to crown her disgrace, while she contemns them, she feels herself worthy of their contempt. Irritated by all these mortifications, she is still further tortured at the sight of desert in another, even in her own children. If she distinguishes any by her regard, it is those whom she has tutored to a servile compliance with her folly; and thus she is condemned to the crime of corrupting their veracity, in order to make them worthy objects of her affection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear madam, turn away this picture; it fills me with horror.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, in order to rest your im∣agination upon more agreeable objects, picture to yourself a young woman adorned with that mo∣desty which is so graceful, and with that diffi∣dence in her powers of pleasing, which gives them their highest charm. Even the flatterers respect her, even the envious receive her with a smile. By modestly yielding to her rivals all that they assume, she takes the surest way to gain a superiority over them. She seems to appear every day with a constant addition of good qual∣ities, as the esteem which she inspires puts people upon finding new graces in her character. As∣sisted by the advice of her friends, which her
<PB N="38" REF="045437_0036_10202787B8FA8470"/>
diffidence induces her to accept, she is beloved by them as the creature of their good wishes. The homage addressed to her from all quarters, enhances her value in the eyes of her husband, who therefore studies to become more worthy of her affection by his constancy and attention. Her children, nourished by her virtues, look up to no other pattern, and indeed the experience of her own success, will make her the more proper to direct their education. She will be able to qual∣ify them for the happiness which she herself en∣joys. More and more pleased every day with herself, and with every thing that is round her, she will be happy in the prime of life, and secure to herself, in a more advanced age, the grateful esteem of her acquaintance, whose attachment her merit will have rendered both zealous and sincere.</P>

<HEAD>THE CAVERN IN THE PEAK</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Described in the relation of a TRAVELLER.</HEAD>
<P>I HAD left London behind me a hundred and seventy miles, and had crossed several moun∣tains and vallies, when at length I saw myself near the end of my journey, being arrived in the wilds of Derbyshire.</P>
<P>The mountains which I had now to climb grew more steep and difficult; and behind them I deserted others still higher, that were totally bate of trees, and presented a surface of heath and greensward, so that at a pretty good distance I could distinguish the flocks feeding upon their sides.</P>
<P>When I had reached the top of one of these mountains, I was all at once surprized with the sight of a delightful valley below me, intersected with rivulets, and surrounded on all sides with lofty hills. At the bottom of this valley is situ∣ated the village of Castletown, consisting of a few indifferent cottages, that seem to announce the poverty of their inhabitants.</P>
<P>A narrow road winding down the declivity of the mountain, conducted me to the bottom of the valley, and so into the village, where having stopped a moment at an inn to refresh myself, I took the road towards the Cavern of the Peak,
<PB N="41" REF="045437_0039_102027908D0A45A8"/>
being guided to its entrance by a small stream that runs near it, after having passed through the town.</P>
<P>I stopped now and then in order to indulge my eyes with a more leisurely view of the singu∣lar object before me. Between two groves of the finest verdure, an enormous rock, crowned with the ruins of an ancient castle, reared its ton to the very clouds. At the foot of this opened a vast Cavern, which, when viewed from with∣out, while the beholder enjoys the light of noon∣day, presents to his eyes a huge abyss of dark∣ness.</P>
<P>A man soon appeared at the mouth of the Cave, who asked me if I chose to go down. I followed him down an easy descent, the day∣light, which came in at the entrance, gradually losing itself in a sort of <HI>darkness visible,</HI> something like the faint twilight of a November evening.</P>
<P>After we had advanced a few steps, I was much surprized to see on my right hand, a subterrane∣ous town under the immense vault of the rock. It happened to be a holiday, and the inhabitants were enjoying a relaxation from their labors, most of them sitting with their children before the doors of their cottages, and amusing them∣selves. I guessed the nature of their usual em∣ployment to be spinning, from the number of large wheels that were every where to be seen.</P>
<P>As we went farther in, the opening which still admitted the feeble light of day, seemed to nar∣row more and more, and soon appeared <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> large hole in the rock, while the rays <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="42" REF="045437_0040_1020279375BC5518"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> as they were, gave a tinge to the smoke that rose from those subterraneous cottages which we had left behind. The gloom, however, thick∣ened every step, till at length the vault of the rock, and the darkness, both together, seemed to enclose all round.</P>
<P>My guide, who was before me, then opened the door of a small cabin cut in the hollow of the rock, and an old woman, who lived in it, came out and furnished us with lights. Each of us took one, and we continued our march, be∣ing obliged however to stoop very low for a con∣siderable length of way. But what was my as∣tonishment when, at the end of this close pas∣sage, I saw the Cavern widen round me all at once, and the vault rise to a height which we could not distinguish by the help of our lights. I passed in silence through the extent of this ca∣vity, like a benighted traveller that has lost his way, and arrived at length on the side of a pret∣ty broad stream, whose silent waters, when our candles approached their surface, threw all round us a pale reflexion of light, that was still more full of horror than the darkness. A small boat was made fast to the bank, and my guide, bid∣ding me enter it, jumped into the water up to his middle, and taking the rope of the boat over his shoulders, began to drag it after him.</P>
<P>The still horror of this place resembled the si∣lence of the grave. As I advanced I saw the roof of the rock become gradually lower, like a dark cloud descending towards the earth. My guide cried out to me to lie down on my back; and I had scarcely been a moment in that posture,
<PB N="43" REF="045437_0041_10202797BB0B2C60"/>
when I found myself under a part of the vault so low, that stretched as I was at full length in the boat, I could scarcely hold the candle upright by my side. While I was thus buried as it were, I confess the stories of the river Styx, and of Cha∣ron's ferry-boat, began to appear not quite so fa∣bulous. I seemed as in a dream, going to land in the gloomy regions of Erebus, condemned by an unusual destiny to carry my own funeral torch. Fortunately this dreary vision did not last long, we soon crossed the streights, and I landed alive and well on the opposite side.</P>
<P>The vault over our heads presented us once more in our walk with the same irregular surface, sometimes rising to a prodigious height, and sometimes sinking all at once as if to stop up our way. I perceived all round me a number of plants and small animals petrified, and would willingly have examined them, but I was obliged to decline the gratification of my curiosity, for fear of burning out our candles.</P>
<P>A second piece of water appearing before us, I imagined that we were now arrived at the end of our journey, as I saw no boat. This stream was not so broad as the former; we could easily dis∣tinguish the opposite side. My conductor took me upon his back, and carried me safe over.</P>
<P>A little farther we found a small current which ran parallel with our path. Our ground here became moist and slippery, and our path so nar∣row that we could hardly get one foot before the other. Yet, notwithstanding these and such disagreeable obstacles, I followed with pleasure the course of the subterraneous water. Every
<PB N="44" REF="045437_0042_1020279AA5AEB698"/>
object that I could discover, in this empire of darkness, appeared to me to carry with it some∣thing of the marvellous. My mind was lost in a chaos of agreeable musings, when suddenly a murmur of distant harmony struck my ear.</P>
<P>I stopped my guide, and asked him whence these sounds proceeded, which my fancy (already in a romantic mood) represented to me so delight∣ful? He answered me that I would soon satisfy myself. Each step that I advanced, this mur∣mur, which at a distance was indistinct and con∣fused, grew more articulate. I presently distin∣guished a sort of pattering noise, like that made by drops of rain. It was no more than a small water-fall, the stream of which separating as it fell, came down in a thick shower; and the noise of this, prolonged from echo to echo, through the silent vault, formed, by its mingled and gra∣dual reverberation, a succession of sounds full of harmony. I could already see these drops spar∣kle like diamonds at the approach of our candles, but I did not dare to go too near them, for fear of seeing our candles go out, and of being redu∣ced to grope our way back in the dark, perhaps unsuccessfully.</P>
<P>In the sides of the rock, at different places, I observed large openings, which led probably to other caverns. I barely peeped into them, and was sorry that my time would not permit me to explore them thoroughly. My guide, in order to give me an agreeable surprize, bid me shut my eyes, and suffer him to lead me. I gave him my candle, and holding him by the coat, followed him blindfold. He stopped short, and when I
<PB N="45" REF="045437_0043_1020279C2F492DC8"/>
opened my eyes, I found myself in an august temple, the dome of which, irregularly suspended upon enormous pillars, possessed all that awful beauty and magnificence, which is seen in the great works of nature. I could not help falling on my knees to adore the majesty of the Almigh∣ty, who seemed to have formed even this subter∣raneous spot, as a temple where he might be fit∣ly worshipped.</P>
<P>I quitted this contemplation with reluctance, in order to continue our expedition, which was now drawing to a period. The faithful stream conducted us to the extremity of the Cavern, where the rock bends down for the last time. Its arch descends to the very waters, where it unites with them, and closes up the passage so complete∣ly, that the most adventurous traveller cannot pass the bounds which here set to his curio∣sity.</P>
<P>We now therefore turned back, and as I im∣agined, were to come out by the same path by which we had penetrated thus far; but I very soon saw my guide turn off to the left, by one of the lateral openings of the rock. He gave me notice that I should find myself much fatigued in this new expedition, and must be satisfied to creep for some length under a part of the rock which nearly touches the ground. As he found me resolved to follow him, he advised me to take good care of my candle.</P>
<P>We were obliged to creep on our hands and feet for a pretty long time, upon a moist sand, the passage being sometimes so streight, that we could hardly squeeze our bodies through. When
<PB N="46" REF="045437_0044_102027A0D76699C0"/>
I rose from this painful posture, I saw a steep hill full before me, the top of which seemed to lose itself like a cloud, among the hardly distinguish∣able extremities of the surrounding rock. The ascent was so steep from its moisture, that I fell back at every step. My guide, more active at this exercise, took me by the hand, and at length succeeded in helping me to the top. I shudder∣ed at sight of the depths which surrounded me on all sides. He bid me sit down, and requested me to wait for his return. Leaving me there∣fore in this solitude, he descended the hill pretty rapidly, and was soon lost to my view. All at once I saw re-appear, not him, but his light, which shone like a spark in an abyss of darkness.</P>
<P>After suffering me to enjoy this spectacle for a moment, my guide returned: I went down with him to the same depth where I had before lost sight of him. He now reascended the hill, and through an opening in the rock, he gave me a view of his candle, while I removed mine. It was to me as if, in the darkest night, I saw a sin∣gle star twinkle in the narrow space between two dark clouds.</P>
<P>This part not offering any fresh objects to gratify my curiosity, we re-entered our former creeping passage, in order to arrive once more on the bank of the small stream which now conduct∣ed us back. I beheld the wild temple again with the same impression of awe; I heard with the same pleasure, the harmonious murmur of the cascade; but I repassed with less terror beneath the vault which my fancy had before compared
<PB N="47" REF="045437_0045_102027A40BD213C8"/>
to a tomb. I considered myself as Theseus re∣turning victorious from his expedition to Hell: and how great was my joy, when, after the vener∣able Sibyl had extinguished the remainder of our candles, which we returned to her, I at length discovered the feeble gleam of day! How I bles∣sed it, after so long a confinement in darkness!</P>
<P>I now came chearfully forward amidst a very picturesque distribution of light and shade. At every step I saw the veil of darkness gradually unfold. As the opening of the Cavern enlarg∣ed, it gave me an idea of Aurora, opening the splendid portals of the dawn. I arrived in the light as in a new world, where the sun now a∣waited me on the borders of the West, surround∣ed with clouds of purple and gold, to contrast, as it were, by the grandeur of such a spectacle, the gloomy objects which were still pictured in my memory.</P>

<HEAD>THE PEASANT, HIS COUNTRY'S BENEFACTOR.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Stanley, tired with the noise and bustle of the town, had purchased a small coun∣tryhouse, in which he promised to himself the en∣joyment of rural tranquillity, amidst the study of books and the exercise of benevolence. Being naturally of a pensive turn, he was fond of soli∣tude and the amusement of walking, in which he occasionally indulged himself in all the quar∣ters round his new habitation. One day, his wandering steps led him to a small valley the sight of which alone was sufficient highly to gratify his contemplative inclination. Surrounded by high hills, the slopes of which presented an agree∣able variety of corn fields, groves and cottages, it seemed to be the retreat of rural happiness. The stillness of this retired vale was only inter∣rupted by the murmuring found of a rivulet,
<PB N="52" REF="045437_0050_102027B2A1390140"/>
which falling down a rock, reflected from its broken waters all the colors of the rainbow, as the sun's rays enlightened it at a certain ele∣vation. Its froth expanded in white volumes round the bason which it had hollowed out by its fall. The rivulet afterwards divided itself into several smaller ones which intersected the valley in many directions, and freshened the verdure of the meadows by their beneficent con∣tributions of moisture.</P>
<P>Yet the most pleasing sensations of Mr. Stan∣ley's breast were not occasioned merely by the natural beauties of the spot. The whole extent of the valley was covered with new cottages, each having its small farm annexed, with an orchard and kitchen garden. These parcels of land were only separated by plain gooseberry hedges, which seemed at once to indicate the value of the ground and the mutual confidence of the inha∣bitants. Mr. Stanley rejoiced to see that no single person had engrossed to himself the whole of this delicious plain. He was pleased in the reflexion that many families might there enjoy the sweets of ease and tranquillity. While he in his own mind, congratulated the owner of the land, who had a number of so happy tenants, he thought some praise was also due to his bene∣ficence, which had certainly, by its encourage∣ment and assistance, occasioned the rich speci∣men of cultivation that he admired. So wholly was he rapt in meditation upon this interesting subject, that he had not observed the gathering of thick dark clouds that was forming over his
<PB N="53" REF="045437_0051_102027B2A1390140"/>
head. A shower of rain, accompanied with lightning, soon obliged him to seek for shelter. He ran therefore and knocked at the door of the first cottage, which was opened by a woman far advanced in years, but whose countenance old age had made venerable. She received him in a free and friendly manner. I am very glad, said she, that our cottage happened to be the nearest to you, though, I am pretty sure, our children would have received you kindly too. As the storm surprized you in the middle of the plain, you could hardly miss of applying for shelter to some one or other of our family. But I see, you are quite out of breath. Compose yourself. I will make up a good fire for you, that you may dry yourself by it.</P>
<P>While she was laying on some wood, Mr. Stanley was looking about him very attentively. He observed an appearance of plenty and regu∣larity in the disposition of the furniture, that pleased him very much. He had understood, by the good woman's words, that a great part of the habitations of the plain was occupied by her chil∣dren. His curiosity was roused by the circum∣stance, and he was preparing to ask a few questi∣ons in order to satisfy it, when he heard somebo∣dy from the inner room say, "I hope, dame, you will make the gentleman welcome." "Yes, yes, gaffer, answered she, never fear."—"That is your husband, then, that speaks to you," says Mr. Stanley. "Yes, Sir, he is within there, in that room."—"Will you give me leave to pay my respects to him?" "And welcome, Sir; you will perhaps be glad to know each other; walk
<PB N="54" REF="045437_0052_102027B8D21C6210"/>
in." Mr. Stanley entered, and perceived an old man lying in a bed, the covering of which was remarkably neat. His head was bare; his locks, white as snow, fell down to his shoulders; his countenance, which time had respected, was ex∣pressive of the tranquillity and goodness of his soul; there was a smile upon his lips, and his eyes sparkled with the fire and vivacity of youth. Mr. Stanley, attracted by an exterior so prepos∣sessing, approached him.</P>

<P>What is the matter with you, my good man? are you sick?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, I thank heaven, I am not. But when one has seen fourscore years, one can hardly count one's self well, though not under any actual disorder. Yet it is not long since I have left off daily labor, and if it were not for fear of grieving my children—But they will not have me work any more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Stanley.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are right. You must have purchased this repose pretty dearly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>Though I say it, I think I have earned it sufficiently. How many sheaves of corn have I tied up in the course of my life! How many have I threshed out! I have wearied my poor body sadly, that is certain. Well, in the midst of all these labors and fatigues, I have always carried a chearful countenance and a mer∣ry heart; and so I wish still to pass gently through the small remainder of the days that I have to live.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Stanley.</SPEAKER>
<P>But after so stirring and labori∣ous a life, how can you pass a whole day in bed without being tired?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="55" REF="045437_0053_102027BBC1149898"/>
<SPEAKER>Old Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tired? I'faith, I have somewhat else to do than to be tired. It is only my limbs that are out of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; my head is still employ∣ed. The thoughts of ten children, and fifty grand children and great grand children, will scarce let my time hang heavy. There are not too many hours in the day to think of so many people. Every one of them gives me an account of his business, and the state of his family, and upon that I must go to work. I have always some of them to marry, and I look twice before I match them. If they have all prospered, they may thank me for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. There is not a single one of them settled in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orld, who did not take up my thoughts a year beforehand. I have now three marriages to conclude, and I hope that the parties will live as happily as their parents before them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Stanley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you are satisfied with the situation of your family?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Sir! it makes me happy to speak of them. Dame, go fetch us a cup of that old ale. It will help me to talk about our young ones.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Stanley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you many of them here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only two grand-daughters. I could as soon quarter a regiment as lodge them all. It was not my cabin, but my lands that I wished to enlarge. I thank God, I have been able to give a pretty parcel of land to each of them, without hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing myself. There was a good deal of ground hereabouts that had been impoverished; it was let to me at a low rent. I took care first to put it into good heart again, and
<PB N="56" REF="045437_0054_102027BD4E10B158"/>
parcelled it off among my daughters for their portions. It brings in money now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Stanley.</SPEAKER>
<P>And in this great number of children has none ever caused you any sorrow?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sometimes, by their sickness; but I have always been able to recover them by re∣gular diet and simples with which I am acquaint∣ed. In other respects they have always made me happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Stanley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Apparently because you have always given them a good example.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>I dare take upon me to say so. When I was young, to be sure, I was all alive, like other folks; I ran about to every wake and revel; but as soon as I had once pronounced the solemn word <HI>I will,</HI> in church, I left off all those youthful tricks. Happily my wife was hand∣some, good-natured and virtuous. That keeps a man in awe. Besides, children began to come on apace. I was not rich at the time, and it I had been sufficiently so for myself, I had affection enough for my family, to wish them also a com∣petency. I trained my children up to work ve∣ry young. I carried them to the fields as soon as they could walk. The youngest I seated upon the plough, while the rest played round about us. My daughters amused us with singing, while they spun at their wheel. In short, I taught them all to work chearfully for their bread, that they might eat it happily.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Stanley.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you see them some∣times?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>See them Sir? When I was light∣er, I used to go my rounds among them once a
<PB N="57" REF="045437_0055_102027C038DA9890"/>
week, to see that every thing went on well in their families. Now, when I cannot go out, it is their turn to visit me. Every Sunday after pray∣ers, my daughters, my grand-daughters, and my daughters-in-law, bring their children here. It would be a good sight to see me in the middle of twenty women, dressed in their Sunday clothes, and as fresh as roses. These all vie with each other in their fondness to me; and their chil∣dren have a certain family resemblance that charms me. I have generally a dozen of them in my arms and playing about me. Then there is such a buz, and a chatter, as would stun ano∣ther person, but it is music to my ears.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Stanley.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can easily imagine that it must be a delightful moment for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>And for them too, I flatter myself. I like to see chearfulness all round me. Behind my barn I have a grass plat on purpose for danc∣ing. It is the last spot of ground on which I e∣ver worked. I open the ball with my dame, and then every one falls a capering about us. They take care to play some of the old fashioned coun∣try dances of my time. Methinks then the ground lifts me up, and I bound as lightly as any of the young folks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Stanley.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you fiddlers then herea∣bouts?</P>
</SP>

<P>None that play for money. But my grandson Arthur can manage a fiddle charm∣ingly. The young rogue is only fifteen, and he plays on it so, as to set the whole village in mo∣tion. Oh! if I had him here to shew him to you! he is the very model of me, except these

<P>If I have not those, I have others. Having never been from this part of the coun∣try, I know it as well as I do my own cabin, and all the inhabitants likewise. I have been at the birth of them all. They come to consult me about laying down their grounds. They have only to bring me a basket of the earth of each farm. I handle it, and taste it, and tell at once what sort of grain it will produce best. If they are poor folks, I lend them seed, which they pay me after the harvest; and I prevail upon those whom I have served, to lend them a day's work, which is all the return that I ask for my services. I have seen the time when every one worked only for himself, and would have thought that he en∣riched himself by ruining his neighbour. I con∣trived, however, at length, to persuade them, that the richer the country was, the richer each would be in particular; that the fruits of the earth would sell better, and attract manufacturing peo∣ple to this quarter, by the plenty of them and their good quality; and that, in order to effect this, they ought to assist each other. According as the season is wet or dry, the crop of the low grounds is more or less forward th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n that of the uplands. I prevail upon them to unite and be∣gin
<PB N="59" REF="045437_0057_102027C614129C60"/>
with the first ripe; thus the whole is got in at its just point of maturity. In fact, you may enquire at the markets all round concerning our grain. The factors strive which shall buy it up. Sometimes they come and take it in the crop, and our corn has been sold before it was put in∣to the ground; whereas if there come ten bush∣els of bad corn from a parish, it is enough to give all the rest a bad name.</P>

<P>These reflexions are simple, and yet it is seldom that they occur to country peo∣ple. How came you to make them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Old Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>By degrees, from the experience of each year. Besides I must say, I have been well assisted. Our vicar is a sensible man; I had made him as rich as a dean, by the weddings, the christenings, and the tithes that I brought him. He sometimes touched upon the good ef∣fects of my practice, in his sermons. Besides, when our head landlord came down to reside here, he saw his lands quite changed, they let for double the rent; upon which he shewed me marks of his regard. If there was any new ex∣periment of agriculture, in your London papers, they will come both of them to consult me. I made the experiment before their eyes, and as soon as it succeeded, it was presently spread. Far∣mers follow their old way, and despise any dis∣coveries taken from books, but those that I had approved, there was no contradicting. They put them in practice, and found the good effects of them. Besides my doctrine is not very long∣winded. I deliver the whole of it in a few

words. <HI>War with our lands, and peace with our friends.</HI></P>

<P>It is true, I have taken many a cause out of his worship's hands. I should be as rich as a judge, if I had only taken a shilling for every dispute that I have settled. There is always some little quarrel, in a country village, upon one subject or another. They come to ask my advice. If one of the parties be at a distance, they take me in a chaise cart, and convey me to the spot. There upon hearing the merits of the cause, I endeavor to accom∣modate matters satisfactorily. If they refuse to agree, I invite them to come to my house against next day. I have some excellent old ale, that would soften hearts of stone. They taste it, and as soon as it begins to have its effect upon my disputants, I make them sensible that a law suit would cost them ten times more than the thing in dispute; that they would lose their time, their money, their rest, and the pleasure of being friends. I mention to them the example of those, who, through not taking my advice, have impoverished themselves to make lawyers rich. Before the first mug of ale is finished, they no longer look shy on each other, and the second is scarce half emptied, before they would go through fire to serve each other. Thus I give away my ale, but I get, in return, pleasure and satisfaction in this life, and good hopes for that which is to come.</P>

<SPEAKER>Old Man.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, I govern here upon my bed, as another upon his throne. But I am not only loved, but feared also. Go nearer to that wall. Do you see there names, with dates of the year, that I have cut with my knife? Some of them are for good actions, but those that you see written backwards, are marks of disgrace. As our head landlord and the vicar are so good as to come sometimes and see me, and as all the vil∣lage are constantly flocking to my cabin, this re∣gister on the wall, has as much effect, as if the folk's names were put in the newspapers. Your name written backwards up there, is a sort of public infamy. Every body shuns you, even to the children. You must mend your manners, or decamp. If you reform, well and good, I re∣verse your name; in the first place, to remove the memory of your disgrace, and then to en∣courage you in good behaviour. Of twenty names, in all, that I have thus engraved back∣wards, there remain but three which will serve as an example for a long time to come; whereas a name written up there, straight forwards, is al∣most enough to make one a gentleman, and to see a single letter turned backwards, would be as dreadful us death to the party, so great is the ad∣vantage of a good reputation.</P>

<P>I am much indebted to it for the advantages that I have enjoyed from it in my old age. For these ten years past, it has renew∣ed the strength of my stomach, and warmed the blood in my veins. I never drank more of it than was necessary to quench my thirst, and for that reason, I find it now more wholesome. A glass of it is sufficient to give me fresh life, and always makes me young again, for a couple of hours. I don't know whether you are grown dry with hearing me, but I am a little so with speaking. I feel that a drop of it would come very seasonably to me at this moment. But what is the matter with my poor wife? how long she is in coming!

<P>I should be much more so, had I spent it ill, had I been idle, and a libertine; if I had not done all the good that was in my pow∣er, or if I had left a large family in a state of po∣verty or vice, through my fault. Instead of such an afflicting retrospect, I look back on fourscore years of useful labor, of lands improved, and friends assisted. I see my sons and grandsons well to live, honest and laborious, united in friend∣ship together, beloved and respected by all the country. I leave my eldest son my cottage, he will fill my place in it, and my duties. As head of the family, he will be for his brothers and their children, what I have been for mine.

I will represent all this to my children, when they shall assemble round my death bed; I will make them sensible that my Maker, after having given me a long and happy old age, crowns all his blessings to me, by taking me from life, before it becomes a burthen by pains and infirmities. I will tell them that I on∣ly leave them, to go and join my Heavenly Fa∣ther, who holds forth his hand from above to receive me, and that I will never cease to look

O Gracious Lord, after so many blessings as thou hast showered down upon my head, shall I dare to ask thee for one more? Behold the compani∣on whom thou hast given me, to share with me the pleasures and the cares of life: we have grown old together, grant that we may die both at once. How should I be able to survive her? Could my trembling hand have strength to close her eye-lids? And again, what would become of her, at so advanced an age, were she to lose me, and no longer hear me answer to her plain∣tive call? Were she to be buried in the solitude of this cottage as in a tomb? Permit not death to separate two persons whom nothing has sepa∣rated for fifty years. Grant us this request, O Lord, this last request. It is the only one that thou hast left us under the necessity of asking thee. We wish not to prolong our term of life; dispose of us when thou wilt. Let us only die
<PB N="66" REF="045437_0064_102027DACB0912C0"/>

</SP>
<P>The old man, who had raised himself up in his bed, to address these words to his Creator, fell back with fatigue as he finished them. Mr. Stanley was terrified, and ran for his wife to assist him. She had fallen on her knees, in a corner of the cottage, at the beginning of his prayer: her hands were still listed up to heaven. He led her, trembling as she was with terror, to the old man, who dispelled the apprehensions of both, by a smile, and by the liveliness of his action, as he waved his hand to them. However, Mr. Stanley judged that repose would be necessary to him, after an emotion so violent, for his age; he therefore thanked these good people for their hospitality, and promised to come again and see them, after a few days.</P>
<P>The storm which had forced him to seek shel∣ter in the cottage, was now over. Nature, com∣ing forth from her gloomy dress, had once more assumed a radiant cheerfulness. The sun, who was now near setting, seemed to shine with new splendor. These objects brought back the thoughts of the old man to Mr. Stanley's ima∣gination. They represented his soul spotless and unsullied, alternately yielding to impressions of tenderness and gaiety; and the strength and fer∣vor of his spirit just then blazing forth, when it was going to be finally extinguished. He ima∣gined to himself all that one single man, in the most humble station, could do for the advantage
<PB N="67" REF="045437_0065_102027DF50E2A990"/>
of society. Fifty industrious citizens given to the state. His active years employed in bring∣ing up his children to honest labor, and his old age dedicated to the maintenance of peace and unanimity among his neighbors. With what freedom, thought Mr. Stanley, did he speak to me of the good that he had done, and the con∣fidence which he reposes in the Supreme Being! what tranquility of conscience! how happy a state of assuredness! Who would not prefer the sound old age of this honest peasant, the bene∣factor of his country, though allotted to a state of obscurity, proud of his own esteem, and en∣joying the truest honor, that of leaving behind him a respectable memory, to the decrepitude of those great men who only use their riches in scattering round them corruption and obloquy, who feel the public contempt fall light upon them, habituated as they are to the contempt of their own souls, and whom even the grave will not have power to rescue from infamy and exe∣cration.</P>
<P>But why introduce these images, so afflicting to the virtuous, while there are others so proper to inspire them with consolation and delight? While the portrait of a Howard is at hand, that benevolent traveller who has already several times gone over a great part of Europe, visiting the children of captivity, and who, by his eloquent writings, and the authority of his virtues, has procured more humane treatment to a race of men, often more unfortunate than guilty! or of a Hutton, who crosses the seas at the age of six∣ty,
<PB N="68" REF="045437_0066_102027E2418BA910"/>
and without assuming any other character than that of minister of humanity, treats with those of the state, concerning the exchange of prisoners of war, and returns modestly to his own coun∣try, to assist those unfortunate persons of whom he is the friend and supporter. Generous men! you need not my praise to recompense your vir∣tues. They find a reward worthy of them, in that very sentiment which inspired them, and in the good that they have produced. More need is, that I endeavor to consecrate them in the memory of tender youth, a shrine suitable to their purity, and to preserve your name as long as I can upon the earth. If the love and rever∣ence of humanity can be kindled in the souls of youth, let them owe it to the force and impressi∣on of your examples, and to the noble desire of imitating them.</P>

<HEAD>SYSTEM OF THE WORLD.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. Crosby had retired, in the third year of her widowhood, to a small, but com∣modious house, at some distance from London. Here she endeavoured to amuse the grief which she felt for the loss of her husband, by attending to the education of a daughter whom she regard∣ed as the only remaining pledge of their mutual affection. She herself had been married very young, and her father, when he made an advan∣tageous bargain, as it is called, in the disposal of
<PB N="69" REF="045437_0067_102027E3CCC30378"/>
her hand, imagined that the splendor of a large fortune, and a few shewy accomplishments, would enable her to appear in the world with sufficient distinction. As he was always invol∣ved in the hurry of business, or engaged in tu∣multuous dissipation, he had never reflected, that, in a calmer state of life, his daughter would have any more occasion, than himself, for those re∣sources of the heart and understanding, which arise from a proper cultivation of both, or that the better choice he made of a husband for her, the more necessary these advantages would be to her in order to gain his esteem, and preserve his attachment. These considerations, obvious as they were, never once occurred to him, and of all the cares that he felt for the happiness of his daughter, the most useful were, those to which he least attended.</P>
<P>It was not long, before Mrs. Crosby felt and regretted this neglect, particularly as she was now placed in the society of a man, distinguished for delicacy of sentiment, and clearness of under∣standing, and who united a large portion of knowledge, to a refined taste. While she sought therefore to supply the deficiency of her own e∣ducation, she resolved, above all things, to avoid any such neglect in that of her daughter. The amusements of town had never totally divert∣ed her from this project, and the solitude in which she proposed to pass her widowhood, af∣forded her there all the leisure necessary for put∣ting it in execution. She had already taken advantage of the first years of Emily's childhood, to perfect herself in those things which she pro∣posed
<PB N="70" REF="045437_0068_102027E6ECA04160"/>
one day or other to teach her. Her appli∣cation and force of memory, her quick and just apprehension, so well fulfilled the views which her affection had suggested, that she was now perfect mistress of ancient and modern history, geography and the elements of mathematicks, and had some general notions of astronomy and natural philosophy. In order to be able by her∣self alone to instruct her daughter, she had ac∣quired her own knowledge, without any other aid, than good books of introduction to those several sciences. Thus, while she sought for herself the most pleasing and effectual mode of instruction, she studied beforehand that which would be most proper for Emily's understanding, whose acute∣ness and vivacity, from an infant, afforded the most favorable hopes; nor did her subsequent improvement disappoint them. Emily, now scarcely thirteen, had already, by her progress in learning, and her dutiful behavior, began to re∣ward the pains which her mother had taken in instructing her. Their hours were spent in the purest enjoyment of mutual happiness. The company of a few particular acquaintances in the neighborhood, and the visits which they sometimes received from their friends in town, were the only interruptions to their studies, the variety of which, together with the culture of flowers, and the care of their singing-birds, served as a relaxation to them.</P>
<P>Whether it was to purge her daughter's heart of every sentiment of vanity, or to rid her house of a load of visitors, Mrs. Crosby had thought proper to conceal her fortune, and assumed as
<PB N="71" REF="045437_0069_102027EB6C340658"/>
a pretext for her country retirement, the necessi∣ty of retrieving her affairs, by strict oeconomy. Thus, while she avoided the tiresome details and useless expense of a great house, she had more time to apply to her labors, and was better able to indulge her generosity by the private be∣nefactions which she so liberally dispensed. From the tranquility of so agreeable a life, the satis∣faction of seeing her daughter equal her hopes, and a good state of health acquired by exercise, temperance, and regularity, she had contracted an unchangeable serenity of temper, and such a sprightliness in conversation, as made her com∣pany highly delightful to little Emily. The feelings of her young heart were wholly dedicated to her mamma, and the memory o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> her father which Mrs. Crosby took care to keep up, by the example of her own sorrow for his loss, and by the remembrance that she expressed of his good qualities. Emily, brought up in all the freedom of ingenuous innocence, had not a thought, that she needed to conceal from her affectionate friend, and therefore had preserved that amiable simplicity, which is the sweetest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ornament of reason. As all her reflections had arisen from what she heard in conversation with her mother, they were of a lively and animated turn, such as the warmth of conversation generally produces, and she delivered her thoughts with equal clear∣ness and force, equal correctness and vivacity.</P>
<P>Mr. Glanville, brother to Mrs. Crosby, whom she loved affectionately, from a child, was settled in London, where he held an honourable post under government; and the duties of this, together with the study of natural science, which
<PB N="72" REF="045437_0070_102027EE5C8E7C60"/>
he cultivated successfully, were his chief employ∣ments. Two daughters, as yet under the first cares of their mother, and little George, now twelve years old, made up his family. Amidst the corruption of a capital, his house was a stranger to immorality. His son had never been far from his presence. Born with a lively ima∣gination, an ardent and fearless spirit, frankness, generosity and resolution, George was mild, and at the same time susceptible of the most impetuous emotions. He was even, at his age, strongly in love with glory, and whatever was great. When he heard an instance of bravery and generosity related, you would see his breast heave, and the fire sparkle in his eyes. While Mr. Glanville conceived the best hopes, from such a disposition, he was thoroughly sensible of the anxiety that it might cause him. However, his son's tender affection for him, alleviated his fears. He had early accustomed himself to manage him by kind∣ness. A cold look would have filled George with terror; a reproach would have been a severe punishment to him.</P>
<P>In consequence of a pressing invitation, which they both received from Emily's hand, though dictated by her mamma, to spend a few days of the summer vacation at her house, they arrived there, as it happened, the day before her birth-day; the addition of this company made it therefore a sort of festival, which Emily adorned by her gra∣ces, and George animated by his vivacity. Mrs. Crosby repaid, with tears of joy, the amiable attentions of these charming children; but this happiness was still more increased, when she had an opportunity of discoursing at freedom with
<PB N="73" REF="045437_0071_102027EFE7834F88"/>
her brother, of their projects and expectations concerning their children. Dinner time, which assembled them and their young family, was a new scene of delight. After a long separation, to find themselves once more together, amidst all the beauties of nature, a fine country, and de∣lightful weather, and in the presence of objects so mutually interesting! to feel the sweet emotions of parental tenderness, and all the <HI>mingled chari∣ties</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Milton.</NOTE> of duty and affection! you would have but a faint idea of their happiness, if you could sup∣pose that these terms give an adequate description of it.</P>

<P>THE fineness of the evening having invited them to walk out, they went all together upon the terrace. The sun was going to set, he was just touching the edge of the horizon. Mrs. Crosby, breaking off her discourse all at once, went and seated herself on the end of a stone seat which fronted a large walk of the garden. Mr. Glanville, thinking that his sister was taken ill, made haste to follow her, and anxiously asked her what was the matter? Nothing at all, an∣swered she, smiling, but without moving her eyes, which were fixed upon the setting sun. I will satisfy your surprize and curiosity in a mo∣ment, but first let the sun disappear.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="045437_0072_102027F330A0D658"/>
Mr. Glanville, and the children, looked at each other in silence, not daring to interrupt her. Presently the sun was out of sight, and Mrs. Crosby then rising with a chearful air, I am sa∣tisfied, says she, every thing goes on well in the universe. These words, and the hasty manner in which I quitted you just now, must surprize you; I shall therefore explain. This is, you know, my birth-day. It seems as if every object in nature became this day unusually interesting to me. I observe with more attention whatever passes, and every thing affords me matter for re∣flection. This morning, as I walked in my or∣chard, I endeavored to remark the changes that might have taken place in the trees during the course of the last year. I saw that some began to lose their youthful look, and others to succeed them in stature and vigor. The first afforded me a serious lesson, but the latter comforted me with a pleasing type of my own youth, renewed in my daughter.</P>
<P>Emily kissed her mother's hand, and heaved a sigh.</P>
<P>That remark, says Mr. Glanville, pleases me as much for its fortitude and philosophy, as the sentiment which is connected with it, does by its tenderness. But do your observations reach to the star of day? were you uneasy to know if he had lost his force or his brightness?</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Crosby.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, brother, my thoughts do not extend so far. Last year, on this same day, I was sitting all alone, on this same seat, and lost in an agreeable musing. I was observing the sun set, and took notice that I lost sight of him, ex∣actly

<PB N="76" REF="045437_0074_102027FA97B123C8"/>
us; for the stars see as little of our earth, as they judge of her inhabitants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! while we have perhaps five hundred telescopes in the air to observe them, they do not vouchsafe so much as to look at us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Crosby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now trust your poets, that talk of extolling the praise of their mistresses to the very stars.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without being more credu∣lous than those ladies, why should you be less in∣dulgent? If the flattery of this fiction could e∣ver turn their heads, it has at least never offended them. It carries its own pardon with it, as it arises from the poet's wish to see it realized.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>But for all that, papa, it is hard to be so little noticed in the universe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not be uneasy, my dear; Mars and the Moon have a pretty full view of us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>And are they all the witnesses to our existence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mercury and Venus, which are placed between us and the sun, distinguish us, perhaps, if they are not dazzled by the vast light that surrounds them; but as to Jupiter, Saturn, and the <HI>Georgium Sidus,</HI> I doubt whether they know the least tittle about us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>And suppose they did, it is not by such planets as our own, that I should care about being remarked.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Crosby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I see George is among those ambitious ones, who disdain the homage of their equals. To satisfy such as him, their
<PB N="77" REF="045437_0075_102027FC246B6CE0"/>
fame must reach the sovereign's notice, and that of foreign courts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, I should wish our globe to make a noise, even among the fixt stars.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why my poor little friend, how do you suppose that they can discern us, since, if the earth were to fill up the whole orbit of 630,000,000 miles that she describes in a year, she would swell to no more purpose than the frog in the fable, and be but a point in the immensity of space.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bless me! is it possible?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>I could prove it to you in a moment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>But however, uncle, if we were in∣creased to the size that you mention, we should be much larger than the sun. The stars see the sun, and they would be much better able to see us, in that case.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hark ye, Emily, do you see that candle, which has just appeared at some house, I take it, about two or three miles off?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, certainly, uncle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>The house is much larger than the candle, which throws its light upon it; can you distinguish the house?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, not in the least.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>You see, then, that a body, which is luminous in itself, can be discerned at a great distance, while a much larger body, that only reflects the light which it receives, is im∣perceptible to us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="78" REF="045437_0076_102027FF109D0570"/>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now reduce the earth to its real proportion: instead of being large with re∣spect to the sun, as the house is with respect to the candle, it would be no more, in comparison, than a pin's head to a lighted torch. So you may judge of the splendid figure that we make in the universe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! George, all our pretensions to the notice of the stars, are brought very low.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Crosby.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I see one of our great folks in London, full of the idea that all the whole kingdom have their eyes upon him. One might perhaps tell him with truth, that he is known at Hackney, or even that his name has been mentioned in Croydon, but that certainly his renown never reached as far as Whitehaven.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I should be so much out of con∣ceit with it, were I my cousin, that I would even wish to hide myself from the moon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Emily; such sullenness might cost us dear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, how, uncle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why if we were to hide our∣selves from the moon the moon in return would hide herself from us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I should be sorry to lose her mild light.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Crosby.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess, too, that I am partial to her. She seems, by her modest and bashful air, to be formed for the sun of our sex.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>A happy idea enough! how many pretty whimsies might then be explained by the variety of her phases, and the inequalities of her motion! You see by this, my friend, that
<PB N="79" REF="045437_0077_10202802032924A0"/>
we have nothing to lose, and that the earth is happy enough in receiving the light of the stars that surround her, without vainly aspiring to be distinguished by them for her splendor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a great pity, that we are not a little more luminous, for, you must confess, papa, that we could not be placed to more advantage, to make a shining figure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>What induces you to think our position so advantageous?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! it is plain; only look at the vault of the heavens. You see that it is quite round above the earth, and that the stars are placed in it at equal distances from us. We are just in the middle of the universe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear, do you remember the handsome prospect that you pointed out to me here, this morning? the hill, the wood, those ruins of an old castle, and the village-steeple that seemed to lose itself in the clouds?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, papa, and that fine large walnut tree that we passed yesterday evening, when I felt such an appetite for some of the walnuts. I was glad to see it again, though at a distance, for it appeared to me, as I stood here, to be just on the edge of the horizon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your perspective is not quite exact; for you might see far behind it that large gothick castle, that is falling to ruin; you know it is a good way farther off; when we had passed it in the chaise, was it not a full quarter of an hour before we reached the walnut-tree?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true, but one cannot judge exactly of distances which are so remote. I
<PB N="80" REF="045437_0078_10202806551F7498"/>
should suppose the tree, I assure you, from this spot, to be in the same circular line with the hill, the wood, the castle, and the village-steeple; and our terrace here, to be in the centre of the pro∣spect. I took particular notice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you talk of, child? how far do you count it, sister, from hence to the village?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Crosby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Almost nine miles, brother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>And to the hill?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Crosby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Full six.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>And to the wood?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Crosby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only a mile and a half; I fre∣quently walk to it, and with ease.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now I guess, by the time of our coming, that the castle is about two miles and a quarter from this place, and the walnut-tree about half that distance, at most. But how do you compute? those objects, some so far off, and some so near, to be in the same circular sweep from this point! all those inequalities, both of distance and surface, to form a round and regular horizon! and our terrace to be exactly in the centre of all that! May it not be the same, George, with respect to the seemingly regular arch of the heavens, and those stars that appear to be fixed in the same concave surface? and, in short, with respect to us who think ourselves to be in the centre of this beautiful sphere?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot deny it, papa; if my sight deceives me at a small distance, it very well may, where the space is so immense. But that we are not in the middle spot under the heavens, I can hardly give up. I would have wagered, that
<PB N="81" REF="045437_0079_10202807DF869268"/>
there are not two inches more on one side than the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us try that. Before we sat down to dinner, you know, we went to see the clergyman of the parish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, he is a very good man! he gave me a fine pear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>That must prove him to be an honest man. However, we do not talk of his orchard now, but of his garret. You remem∣ber how much he praised the prospect that is to be seen from the window of it; you know, we went up; well?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and his garret window is not higher than the level of this terrace.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! is not there a wider prospect from it than from this spot?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, indeed, papa, it is exactly the same. I remarked the same objects quite at the edge of the horizon, as here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, was his house the cen∣tre of the view?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, papa.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you were not in the cen∣tre here. A circle has not two centres.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>But then we are not far from the clergyman's house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Full two hundred yards.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>But that is nothing to the distance of the objects which we viewed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>It follows then, that when, from two different points, we imagine distant ob∣jects to retain still the same distance, these points cannot be very far asunder. In short, it is as
<PB N="82" REF="045437_0080_1020280AD48353D8"/>
if they were only one point: Is not that the case, George?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Exactly, papa; you have just hit my meaning; I like your way of explaining it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, there is something to en∣courage me; well then, let us go a little further. You know, I suppose, as well as Emily, that the earth moves in an orbit round the sun. I will draw it here upon the ground. Do you see? it is a sort of oval, called an ellipse, as you have been told. There, it is finished. You can see it pretty well by the light of the moon, which is just rising. I will put down my hat within the orbit for the sun.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>A fine sun, truly! all black! stop, stop, <STAGE>(runs hastily towards the house.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where are you going, George?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(without stopping.)</STAGE>
<P>I shall be back in an instant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>What does the mad creature mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us wait till he returns, before we past judgment on him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George. </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(returning in few minutes, with a servant carrying a torch.)</STAGE>
<P>Have I made you wait? There, John, put the torch in the place of this hat. I think, papa, that makes a better sun than yours; you would have caught cold in looking at the other. Pray put on your hat, papa, for fear of the dew.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you, my dear, for your amiable attention. This torch will serve us too, for another purpose. Stay here, John. Come, children, will you march round the sun, that you may know your orbit? <STAGE>(Emily and
<PB N="83" REF="045437_0081_1020280F76AA2018"/>
George walk round.)</STAGE> Mighty well. Now, John, take the torch again, and run to the further end of the walk; there hold it, that we may see it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John. </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(going.)</STAGE>
<P>Yes, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are you going to do, uncle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall see. Is John at his post?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>There; he holds us the torch now. Oh! how little he is grown.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad that you have re∣marked that. Come hither, to this end of the orbit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but they have taken away our sun.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is of no use to us at present, we will suppose him to be set. It must be night, before we can see the stars; the torch shall be one. Look well at it first, to be sure of its size and distance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I have remarked it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, now begin to march slowly along the circular line of the orbit, with your eye still on the torch, that stands for a star. Move forward, do you see the star become lar∣ger or nearer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, papa, it seems to be still the same, and in the same spot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then go farther still, as far as the opposite part of the orbit to that from which you sat out. There, stop; well, how is the star?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>It has not changed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="84" REF="045437_0082_1020281262BDB128"/>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! does not it appear lar∣ger or nearer? and yet you have moved towards it!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, a good deal. But it is perhaps sixty yards off, and I am only come nearer to it, by the length of the diameter of this orbit, which is about six feet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>These six feet are nothing, then, compared to the distance of the torch; and you may think, it would be still less, if the torch were to be removed farther off; for instance, three miles, till it appeared no bigger than a spark.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, then the whole orbit would be no more than a point, quite imperceptible. Let us try a larger scale, papa.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, then, to satisfy you; take a diameter of two hundred millions of miles, which is that of the real orbit of the earth, and instead of the torch, your imaginary star, take a real one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, that will be something.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, 'tis talking to the purpose. Come, then, begin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Softly, let us recollect our∣selves a little. I remember, I told you, when I <HI>just hit your meaning</HI> so well, that whenever from two different points, one imagines distant objects to preserve still the same distance, those two points must be supposed not very far asunder; and in short, it is just as if they both made but one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, that was it, word for word.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now do not forget what you said just now, that our little orbit here, on the ground, would be no more than an imperceptible
<PB N="85" REF="045437_0083_10202813EC4DD3D0"/>
point, compared to the distance of the torch, if it were so far removed as not to appear bigger than a spark.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>I remember it, papa; I said so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is acknowledged, that the diameter of the earth's orbit, is 200,000,000 miles. The earth, therefore, at one extremity of this diameter, sees the opposite star 200,000,000 miles nearer than at the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is plain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if the earth, from two points so different, and notwithstanding the enor∣mous distance by which she is nearer in one of them, sees this star preserve still the same distance; if, notwithstanding the immense bulk of this star, which I shall make appear to you by and by, she never perceives it to be larger than a sparkling point, the two extremities of the diameter of her orbit, for all the vast interval between them, may then be imagined to coalesce in one point, and this immense orbit itself will appear as no more than such a point, become imperceptible with re∣spect to the infinite distance which the star will preserve from her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my poor George, what have you to say, in reply?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if this immense orbit be no more than an imperceptible point, compared to the distance of the star, what will the globe of the earth be then, compared to this same distance, the earth being no more than a point, as it were, in the immense space of her own orbit? Will this proud planet then imagine, that the arch of the Heavens is built only to form a pavilion over
<PB N="86" REF="045437_0084_1020281730B25EA0"/>
her, in which the stars are set at equal distances for ornament, and that she is of consequence e∣nough to occupy the middle place of the uni∣verse, in which she is hardly so much as perceiv∣ed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>We must be content; but I feel this littleness of ours very mortifying.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Crosby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well now, what mortifies me much more, is, that all the famous philosophers of antiquity, would place our inconsiderable planet in the centre of the universe, and no where else. I see, that in the first age of wisdom, men were still but a composition of pride and folly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pythagoras had brought from Egypt and India, the foundest notions of astro∣nomy, which he extended no farther during his life-time, than the compass of the school that he had founded in Italy; his disciples, however, carried them into Greece, after his death. By this great man, the sun was placed in the centre of our system, the planets moving round him in this order, Mercury, Venus, the earth, with her moon, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. He did mis∣take, it is true, as to their distances and magni∣tudes; but the geometry of his age, was not sufficiently advanced, nor instruments brought to their present perfection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Crosby.</SPEAKER>
<P>That accounts for his deficien∣cy: however, he was still the philosopher: and was his system followed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>How could he succeed among people who were taught, by their men of genius, that the earth was flat, like a table, and the hea∣vens an arched vault of hard solid matter, like
<PB N="87" REF="045437_0085_1020281A1A87B7B0"/>
the earth; or that the sun was a mass of fire, somewhat larger than Peloponnesus; that comets were formed by the accidental concourse of se∣veral wandering stars; that stars were only rocks or mountains carried up by the revolution of the ether, which had set them on fire; or, in short, that the stars were lighted up at night to be put out in the morning, while the sun, which they made a fiery cloud, was kindled in the morning, to go out at night; and that there were several suns and moons to enlighten our different cli∣mates? Now, if the star of day was, according to all these notions, less than the earth, could it be expected that she would resign the centre of the universe to him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Crosby.</SPEAKER>
<P>This was reasoning indeed, wor∣thy of the <HI>people,</HI> but hardly deserved the name of philosophy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ptolemy finding these opini∣ons received in his time, and building on the fal∣lacious evidence of the senses, easily persuaded himself and others, that the opinions of Pytha∣goras were only visionary, that the earth was the centre of all motion, both of the planets (the sun being reckoned among them) and of the fixed stars, with his glass heavens, which he blew out at one whiff. This system held its ground for more than fourteen centuries, patched up every day with some additional absurdity, which its fa∣vorers adopted, in order to defend themselves a∣gainst the objections that pressed hardest upon them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Crosby.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think the centuries that you mentioned, come down pretty near to our times.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="88" REF="045437_0086_1020281E6B2E4A70"/>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, it is but two hundred and forty years ago, that Copernicus undeceived us: And even since that period, error has pre∣dominated in the science, though under another form.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Crosby.</SPEAKER>
<P>How was that, brother? for I would wish to know all the absurdities that we have broached on this subject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Although Copernicus, while he restored the system of Pythagoras, which I have just now explained to you, at the same time made use of it to lay open the insurmountable difficul∣ties of that which he overturned, yet Tycho Brahe, the greatest astronomical observer, of his age, persisted to support the earth in her claim to the post of honor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Crosby.</SPEAKER>
<P>This was then no more than Ptolemy's principles, revived.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>There was a difference. He did make all the planets now turn about the earth, she had only the moon left her. The sun, taking the rest in his train, moved round her in the course of a year; which, however, did not hinder him, together with the whole assemblage of the stars, from repeating the same mark of respect to her once in every twenty-four hours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Crosby.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not see what is gained by this change. I think it still ridiculous, that so many immense bodies should be obliged to run so fast round us, who are so small.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have just hit upon the absurdity of the system. However, as it is very ingenious in every other particular, and was for∣tified by the great name of its founder, perhaps it
<PB N="89" REF="045437_0087_1020281FF52BADD8"/>
would have still prevailed, unless Galileo, with the assistance of the telescope, had confirmed the real order of the universe, as discovered by Py∣thagoras and Copernicus; unless Kepler, by a stroke of fortunate sagacity, had hit upon the laws which govern it; and unless Newton, our countryman, had demonstrated them with all the force of genius and truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Crosby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank Heaven, the sun is fixed at last in his resting place, in the centre of our world! I can now, with safety of conscience, begin my reform.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, sister, have you some new plan to propose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Crosby.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, brother, I am very well sa∣tisfied with your arrangement; it seems agreea∣ble to the wisdom of nature. I am only out of humor with that yellow-haired gentleman, Phoe∣bus, who has deceived poor mortals so scurvily.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what moves your pretty rage against him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Crosby.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! for three thousand years here have we fed his coursers with ambrosia, for which they have done nothing but puff over it, and grow fat in his stables.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, aunt, since he no longer drives the chariot of light, let us discharge this lazy coachman, and sell off his stud.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess, I felt that pas∣sion, in some degree, last year, when I went to see his statue at Cambridge. Roubilliac, a French sculptor, has represented him in an erect attitude, looking at the sun, and shewing him, with one hand, a prism, which he holds in the other to decompose his rays. While I was lifted up in thought, to the vast height to which he has raised human knowledge, I imagined Nature as she formed him, to address him thus. "Though man has studied my laws for so many ages, he has still misconceived them; it is time now to reveal them to him. Thou art born to publish them upon earth; go then, renew astronomy, en∣large geometry, and lay the basis of natural phi∣losophy. I assign thee these sciences, at the same time, with the genius that attends thy birth. Thou shalt tell the extent of the universe, and
<PB N="91" REF="045437_0089_10202825CC7E49B8"/>
the simplicity of the order that governs it. Thou shalt weigh the mass of those immense bodies which I have scattered through it; thou shalt point out their form, determine their revoluti∣ons, and measure their distances; thou shalt re∣duce to precise calculation, even the inequalities of their movements. In the midst of them, thou shalt fix the sun, and shalt say by what power he rules them, and how he distributes to them light and activity. For thy reward, I will place thee thyself, as a new luminary, in the midst of all the great men who are to follow thee. Whilst thou givest a rapid impulse to their genius, thou shalt make it incessantly tend to∣wards thine own; and they shall move round thee with respect, in order to receive light from thee. As for those who would depart from it, like rebellious comets, that to shrink from the empire of the sun, lose themselves for ages in the viewless depth of space, but which he constantly brings back to the foot of his throne, so they, from the darkness of their errors, shall be forced to return to thee, nor shall they shine in any part of their course, even with transient light, save when at your approach, they are enveloped in the splendor of your rays."</P>
<P>Here the servant came to inform Mrs. Crosby, that supper was served up. Emily and George would have been glad it were kept back, that they might still listen to Mr. Glanville. For their satisfaction, he was obliged to promise, that after supper, he would take another turn in the garden, and that they should be of the party.</P>

<HEAD>SECOND CONVERSATION.</HEAD>
<P>An agreeable chearfulness reigned during the time of supper. Mr. Glanville and his sister were delighted with the readiness of apprehen∣sion, and fondness for instruction, which their children had discovered. They smiled, to observe the dispatch that Emily and George made of their supper, who spoke not a word the whole time, so eager were they to return to the terrace, and resume the subject of their conversation. Our little philosophers had already finished their re∣past, and began to fret upon their seats with im∣patience, which Mrs. Crosby, who observed it, probably took a pleasure to prolong. Be that as it may, Emily, in order to lose no time, began to joke upon George's romantic pride, in wish∣ing to be visible to the stars. George bore this pleasantry with a good grace, until he saw his father and aunt (whom he had been watching for some time) finish their supper; then turning short to Emily, "cousin," said he, loud enough to draw the general attention, "I was reading the other day a story which, I dare say, my papa knows, and your mamma too, but which, I dare say, you do not. I will tell it to you. Mahomet had once a mind to give his army a proof of the power which he exercised over na∣ture, and promised to perform a very great miracle in their presence. This was no less than to make a pretty high mountain move and come to him, from a considerable distance. One fine morning, therefore, he assembles all his soldiers, who already gave their great prophet credit for
<PB N="93" REF="045437_0091_1020282D0CE05360"/>
the performance of something prodigious, and placing himself at their head, he orders the moun∣tain to approach. The mountain turns a deaf ear to his word of command. Mahomet is sur∣prized. He calls it a second time, with a voice more terrible than at first. The mountain, as you may imagine, did not stir the more for this summons. How is this! cried the impostor, with an air of inspiration, the mountain will not walk to us) Well then, my friends, let us walk to the mountain.—I have no more ill-nature in me, than Mahomet; if the stars do not see us, why then, cousin, let us go see the stars.</P>
<P>At these words he rose briskly from table, and bounced towards the door, leaving Emily a good deal surprized at this conclusion. Mr. Glan∣ville and Mrs. Crosby smiled at his ready turn, and followed him into the garden.</P>
<P>It was a most beautiful clear night; not a cloud intercepted the sight of the sky. The moon which had now begun to appear above the horizon, suffered those stars which she had just before obscured, to resume their lustre, as she gradually withdrew from them. The children had often admired the grandeur of this sight, but now, when their curiosity upon the subject was going to be satisfied, they beheld it with additio∣nal rapture. The bright star of Sirius was the first that attracted George's notice. He wished to know its name; and when he had heard it, I like Sirius, papa, cried he, for it is the largest of any of the stars.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>I like it too, for being the brightest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps, my dear children,
<PB N="94" REF="045437_0092_101FFAB771FA20E0"/>
it is in fact, no larger nor brighter than the rest, but then it is nearer the earth. If it were brought to the distance of the sun, it would un∣doubtedly appear at large as he does. Indeed, if we consider that it is 200,000 times farther off, we must be astonished that it is so visible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>You talk very easy about it, papa; 200,000 times farther off than the sun! How can any body tell that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will not deny that all the at∣tempts of astronomers to measure the magnitudes of stars, and by means of them their distances, have been ineffectual. But this very impossibi∣lity is sufficient to prove, at least, that the distance is prodigious; for the magnitudes of the planets have been determined with sufficient accuracy, even the most distant ones, and among the rest, this handsome planet, Jupiter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hah! is that Jupiter? and yet, pa∣pa, Sirius appears larger to the naked eye. If they have been able to measure the size of Jupi∣ter, why can they not that of Sirius?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Before I answer you, pray look from this spot at the taper that you see burning in the back parlor, as the window stands open; do not you observe a circle of light round it, that makes it appear larger?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, papa, it is very true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Just like the sun, which appears lar∣ger by the whole crown of rays that encircles it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, then, the stars being lu∣minous of themselves, like the sun and the ta∣per, have also that same irradiation, which makes them appear much larger than they otherwise
<PB N="95" REF="045437_0093_10202834422F7A90"/>
would; insomuch, that their apparent bulk is supposed to be magnified nine hundred times, by this cause.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oho!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now tell me: When the moon is in the full, and, consequently, shines brightest, have you ever remarked the same ra∣diance round her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, never; her light is bounded by the circle that forms her face.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>One may remark the same in Jupi∣ter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whence should this difference arise?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose, as Jupiter and the moon only reflect a borrowed light, this light cannot have the same force of motion as when it comes from bodies that shine of themselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surprizingly well explained: and thus it is, that Jupiter's disk does not appear magnified; and small as his distance shews him, astronomers have instruments of sufficient pre∣cision to measure him. But the stars, with that dazzling radiance that surrounds them.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Could not means be found to strip them of it, so as to see them in their real bulk?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is exactly the effect which a telescope produces, by uniting and concentra∣ting all their rays into a point. But then that point is so small; and the more perfect the te∣lescope is, the more this point, while it grows brighter, becomes also smaller, until, at last, it eludes all measure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="96" REF="045437_0094_10202835CB1ED128"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Crosby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but how have they been able to compare the sun's distance with those of the stars?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>By a very ingenious method. The magnitude and distance of the sun is known from the surest reasoning. They have also cal∣culated, both how much he should be diminished, or how far removed, to bring him down to the size of Sirius. From these calculations, we ne∣cessarily infer the prodigious distance of this star, which is, nevertheless, the nearest to us of any. Most astronomers even judge this distance to be more considerable, because it is to be doubted, whether the best telescope can totally divest a star of its superfluous light, and make it preserve, to our view, the size which it should, at that dis∣tance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! since the stars are so far off, I can easily believe, as we have been told, that they are real suns. If they possessed only a borrowed light, how could their rays reach, even to us, with such a lively brightness, after having passed through immense space?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, my boy, your ob∣servation is quite just. It has been demonstrated, that the light of a star might be diminished ma∣ny millions of times, by removing it farther from our sight, and yet it should still appear no fainter than a piece of white paper by moonlight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>If some of the stars, then, appear so small, it is because they are still farther from us than Sirius.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="97" REF="045437_0095_1020283755584390"/>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps there is as great an interval of space between them, as even between Sirius and the sun.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George. </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(surprized.)</STAGE>
<P>Oh, Papa!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet they seem placed one beside the other. Nay, there are some that one would take to be double.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can answer you both at once by a single example, that is familiar to you. No doubt you have sometimes remarked, from Black∣friar's-bridge, of an evening, the lamps on Lon∣don-bridge, and those of Fleet-market. You know the lamps are of the same size in general?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, have not you observed that those of Fleet-market, which were the near∣est, appeared with a livelier and stronger light than those of London-bridge?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I think I have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, suppose that between any two of the latter, you saw one of the same size at Tower-stairs, which, consequently, would be about twice as far off. You remember what we said before supper, that objects, at a certain degree of remoteness, appear equally distant from the eye, though they may be much farther off some than others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, we have not forgot it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>You understand then, my dear, that the lamp at the Tower-stairs, would appear ranged in the same circular line with those of London-bridge, and that you can judge it to be farther off no otherwise than by the smallness of its flame, and the weakness of its rays.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="98" REF="045437_0096_102028393610DDB8"/>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are right, uncle; this agrees ex∣actly with the large and small stars. I under∣stand how, very well, that one may be at a great distance behind the other, and, for all that, ap∣pear to us in the same line, but some larger and brighter, others smaller, and of dimmer light. Do you comprehend that, George?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George. </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(with an air of importance.)</STAGE>
<P>Yes, I think I do, and I have a comparison too, which, though I say it, is ten million times better than my papa's</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is modest enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so it is; for it will serve for our whole globe, while his stands good only for a lit∣tle way down the river. But there is a reason why mine is best: I do not take it from the earth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, that would be too low for so lofty a genius as yours. But is this celestial comparison within our comprehension?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will try and bring it down to your level. Those stars that are about Jupiter, would not one suppose them as near to us as he is him∣self? If the moon was now on the same side, would not one think Jupiter as near as the moon? And if there was a cloud in the neighborhood of the moon, would not one think her also as near to us as the cloud? The cloud, the moon, Jupiter, and the stars, would then appear all in the same arch, as it were. Now, do you know, cousin, that their distances are very different?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; so well, that I can tell you too, that the very largest cloud would not be visible at the distance of the moon, that the moon
<PB N="99" REF="045437_0097_1020283D89057A90"/>
would not be visible at the distance of Jupiter, and that Jupiter would be still less visible at the distance of the stars.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is well, my little friends. I like this repartee. Luckily, those last words of Emily, bring us back to what we were just now mentioning, that the stars must needs shine with their own light, and that this light must needs be very strong, to reach us from a distance at which Jupiter would have ceased one thousand times to be visible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I see; I have no doubt about it now; they are real suns.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is my opinion too; but do you suppose these suns to be made for the earth?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of what service could they be to her? If we depended upon them to ripen the corn, it would be long before the country folks could sing harvest home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>They have nothing that can be of use to us, but their dim light. And even the moon from behind a cloud, hardly gives a hun∣dred times more.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Besides, you know, there are some stars which cannot be discerned, without a telescope; and those we may set down as useless, in every respect. In the same manner, therefore, if these suns were made for us, they would cer∣tainly have been placed as near to the earth as our own sun is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! thank ye, papa, we have e∣nough already in one. Besides, then, my little cousin's fine lily complexion would be <HI>so</HI> tanned.
<PB N="100" REF="045437_0098_10202941E72A90C8"/>
The brownest filber in our nut-grove would then be fair to my poor Emily.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>And those fine young gentlemen that I have somewhere seen with a parasol, in bright weather, how many hands, and how many large round hats should they have to shade themselves on every side.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if all these suns, at their present distance, can neither give us heat nor light, if when placed nearer to us, they would only serve, according to your silly notions, to tan the complexion of the ladies, or incommode the pretty jassmines of the day; and, according to my more serious fears, to scorch the earth up in a moment: if, with the good leave of some phi∣losophers, they are not made merely to amuse and gratify our sights, are we to suppose them scattered with such magnificent profusion through the universe, for no purpose whatsoever?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is exactly what puzzles me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us consider this a little; since the sun is intended to furnish light and heat to the planets, why then, if the stars are suns, they must also have planets which they warm and en∣lighten.</P>

<P>Do you see that, cousin? But, papa, must we allow planets to all these suns?</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>If such be the destination of each of them in particular, you are sensible that it must be the business of them all in general.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>So am I. I see that every thing is well disposed. Our sun has planets which move round him, whilst, at the same time, they have their satellites moving round them.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right. It required some im∣agination on our parts to conceive, hat these suns, which seem to us to be so near each other, are, nevertheless, prodigiously distant one from the other.

<P>How so, pray, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have not Jupiter and Saturn atten∣dant planets or moons, which reflect to them the borrowed light of the sun, and so assist his feeble rays to illuminate them? The Georgium Sidus is a good deal farther off than any of them; it is therefore likely, that he also has satellites, which we do not know yet, and, perhaps, more of them: And when the outermost of these sa∣tellites is beyond its planet, is it not much far∣ther removed from us? I think, for once, I am at the extremity of our system.</P>

<P>I will not mention that of 1769, the period of whose revolution has been fixed at about five hundred years, nor yet that of 1680, which is supposed to be five hundred and seventy-five years in performing its orbit. We

<P>From the point where it is nearest to the sun in each of these revolutions, let us suppose it to set off on its journey of near three centuries, and let us divide its period equal∣ly, one half for its departure, and the other for its return.

<P>More still than you think; for the comets do not move like the planets in an ellipse that differs little from a perfect circle, by which means they would be always nearly at an equal distance from the sun▪ They describe an ellipse excessively oblong, and so increase their distance continually, until they arrive at that point of their orbit from which the sun forces them to return by the opposite side; but when arrived at this so distant point, where, neverthe∣less, they yield to the force by which the sun continually attracts them, they must be still a good deal farther from the suns of the neighbor∣ing systems, otherwise the nearest one would force them to enter within its dominions: at this distance, therefore, which our comet takes nearly a century and a half to measure, it must still leave beyond it, an immense space unoccupi∣ed,
<PB N="105" REF="045437_0103_101FFAD8F4E5BF80"/>
by way of frontier between its own and the nearest system to it on that side. Apply this cal∣culation to the other-worlds, and conceive, if you can, how immense each of them must be!</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Crosby.</SPEAKER>
<P>But do you think them all, bro∣ther, as large as ours?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Recollect your philosophy a little, sister. What pretensions can man have to suppose the empire of his sun the most extensive, while he inhabits himself but one of the smallest provinces of it? The reasoning of his pride is particular enough: as long as he thought all the heavenly bodies formed for him alone, he sought, from age to age, to enlarge them: now when astronomy demonstrates that they have another use, he aims at contracting their extent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Crosby.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can oppose nothing to your argument; but this immensity dazzles me, and, perhaps, you are going to confound me still more. What do you suppose to be the number of the stars?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>The most minute and accu∣rate observations have enumerated something more than three thousand in our hemisphere, and ten thousand in the southern.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Crosby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heavens! Thirteen thousand suns! Thirteen thousand worlds in the universe!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>And then the stars, which can scarcely be distinguished with a telescope! Those which that instrument would enable us to disco∣ver, were it still further improved! The thou∣sands which form those little clouds that you can see with the naked eye, and which are therefore called nebulous stars; and those others, forming
<PB N="106" REF="045437_0104_101FFADC53925C58"/>
clouds, which cannot be seen, without an instru∣ment! The millions that are contained in the milky way! the very idea of their number is sufficient to terrify the imagination. At the sight of a high mountain, a man feels himself particularly affected: he shudders, when he re∣flects on the vast extent of the earth: the ocean and its unfathomable depths, make his blood run cold; and yet what is this whole globe, compa∣red to the burning mass of the sun, which is one million four hundred thousand times larger? and the space occupied by this luminary, immense as it is, what will it be found, on comparison with that space in which the bodies move, that are subject to its action? But while he makes the planets, surrounded by their satellites, move round him, what would you say, if he, as well as other suns, followed like him, by their retinue, moved round some other body still more power∣ful than all of them at once.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Crosby.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, brother, our sun and those of all the other worlds, to be no more than planets wandering through the skies! I fear your imagination is the only thing that moves, of all this system?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what would you say if this conjecture, advanced by Halley, and support∣ed by Mr. Lambert, one of the greatest geome∣tricians of this age, was become the opinion of the most distinguished astronomers at present, such as Mess. Bailly and Delalande, and that wise, profound, and religious observer of nature, Mr. Bonnet of Geneva?</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Crosby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Such great names are certainly enough to dazzle me: but on what foundation is this opinion built?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>The motion of the sun round its axis would alone be sufficient to render i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> probable. Nature has impressed this motion on all bodies which move in an orbit round another more powerful, that governs them; thus the satellites turn on their axes, while they encircle their proper planets, and the planets, while they encircle the sun. Would Nature, ever uniform and consistent in its law, have given the sun this vertiginous motion, if he had no other? All the planets, at the same time that they go round him, move thus, in order to receive his warmth suc∣cessively in all their parts. Now, since he is endowed with this same movement, may we not suppose him to have the other also, and to be carried round a central power, still superior to himself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Crosby.</SPEAKER>
<P>These conjectures appear natural enough, and, at the same time, important enough to make me wish them supported by some ob∣servation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, to satisfy you: the motion of three of the largest stars, Sirius, Arc∣turus and Aldebaran, is acknowledged; it is well known that Arcturus moves, every year, two hundred and seventy millions of miles to∣wards the south: so prodigious is the distance even of those stars which are nearest to the earth, that their change of place is scarcely perceptible after several years: judge if other stars, infinitely farther distant, may not have a movement full as
<PB N="108" REF="045437_0106_10202844B75D81F8"/>
considerable, though not perceptible to us, until after whole centuries of observation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Crosby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Since the moving of those great stars is so certain, I have nothing to offer against your conjecture: nay, I can very well imagine, according to your idea, that the smallest may move, without visibly changing place, till after a long period of time, an account of their incon∣ceivable distance: but is it not sufficient, in order to satisfy you of the immensity of the universe, that certain stars move in an orbit, of whose ex∣tent, even the imagination cannot form to itself an idea? Why will you still disturb the repose of others?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should otherwise impeach Nature. You have been obliged to acknow∣ledge, that if the stars are all suns, and if one of these suns has a planetary system, which he governs, it is agreeable to the wisdom of Nature that all the rest should perform the same func∣tions. Now would it not be a strange incon∣sistence to give motion to some stars, whilst others, destined to the same purposes, remain immove∣able? But take care, sister; that repose, which you would be weak enough to allow these latter, must be their inevitable destruction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Crosby.</SPEAKER>
<P>You terrify me. brother.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the midst of all these suns, absolutely immoveable, let us suppose but one in motion; like a conqueror that marches through his own dominions in good order, while he advances to foreign devastation, so he moves peaceably within the bounds of his own empire; but when once he reaches the frontiers of the
<PB N="109" REF="045437_0107_1020284646D42370"/>
neighbouring system, behold him, as he pro∣ceeds through it, swallow up all the planets be∣longing to it in his mass of fire; and, perhaps, attack, on his immoveable throne, this very fun whom he has just despoiled: from that moment the balance of the universal machine is over∣turned. How shall those systems, which were poised by the equality of their forces, resist the usurper, strengthened with the addition of an in∣vaded world, and pushed forward in his course with a new impetuosity? As a fire attracts the light straw, he sees those worlds, which border on his passage, rush in crouds into the vortex of his flames: thus he moves on, consuming as he goes, and becomes the wandering fire-brand of general conflagration to the universe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Crosby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I beseech you, set those suns in motion again, which my folly would have made to stand still, our own especially; let us not spare his going; let him flee from the terri∣ble disaster to which I exposed him. I am afraid, his activity will be retarded by the weight of his vast retinue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Make yourself easy, sister; his strength is proportioned to the mass of bodies that he draws after him. The earth, only sixty times larger than the moon, can yet sway her course; Saturn carries his ring and his Satellites along with him; nor is Jupiter ever forsaken by his. If these planets, by their governing mass, compel the bodies in their train to accompany them as they revolve round the sun, certainly the sun, with a mass of matter vastly more consider∣able than all the comets, planets and their Satel∣lites
<PB N="110" REF="045437_0108_102028483B8D9EE8"/>
together, will be able to take them all with him at once, round whatever luminary it is that governs him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Crosby.</SPEAKER>
<P>So then the master of so many slaves is himself only a slave in his turn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whatever motion you allow him, it must necessarily be round a superior bo∣dy, the centre of his orbit, as he is the centre of the orbits of all the bodies that are subject to his sway. This is a law which Nature invariably follows in the system of the universe. Comets, whose motions, according to our ideas, are the most irregular, are subject to it in their greatest excentricities; while they run almost in a straight line to the extremity of their ellipse, they are continually describing their ap∣pointed orbit round the sun.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Crosby.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then! for every sun, should a superior body be created round which he must move?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nature has more resources. Several planets, with their satellites, move round the same sun; several suns, with their planets, may move round a superior body; several supe∣rior bodies, with their suns, may move round o∣ther bodies still superior to them. This grada∣tion of systems of superior bodies continually in∣creasing in bulk, and decreasing in number, may terminate in the central body of the whole uni∣verse, on which, no doubt, reposes the throne of the Supreme Being, who, with one look, beholds the whole of his admirable work.</P>

<P>As an admiral who commands a large fleet, formed for instance into three squa∣drons, each squadron consisting of several men of war, a prodigious number of frigates, and an in∣finity of merchantmen; suppose him to com∣mand a general naval review; to order the three next in command to sail round him in a large circle, with their flags flying; each of these to give the same order to the men of war in his squadron; each man of war to a number of fri∣gates, each frigate to several merchantmen, and each merchantman to its boat. They would take up, indeed, a vast space to perform these e∣volutions with freedom, and to execute them with rigorous precision. It would, no doubt, appear complicated enough to the outermost ves∣sels: they would see nothing but a number of confused and irregular motions among all these floating bodies. Yet you see that it is extremely simple; the admiral would have occasion for on∣ly one order, one signal; the boats would only have to sail at different distances round each of the merchantmen to which they belonged, while several merchantmen would move round each frigate, several frigates round each man of war, the men of war round the commanders of squa∣drons; and lastly, these round these admiral.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>This comparison sets before my eyes the whole system of the universe. But how is it possible to conceive this gradation of bodies, one more powerful than another, of which the enormous bulk of the sun would make but the extreme term?</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Has not your imagination al∣ready made a bolder effort, in rising even to the immensity of the sun himself, which is now es∣tablished beyond dispute? This luminary, which the ancients thought to be less than the moon, and infinitely smaller than the earth, could make more than fourteen hundred thousand globes like the earth, and more than eighty millions of moons. What progression of magnitude can now stop your imagination? If each new disco∣very of error enlightens the understanding of man; if each new instance of weakness and im∣perfection that he discover<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in his organs, enlar∣ges his genius, why should he fear to give a no∣bler scope to his genius and understanding? Be∣fore the use of the microscope, did not he sup∣pose animated nature to terminate at the smallest insect that his eyes allowed him to discern? Now how many millions of creatures does he discover still more minute? A drop of prepared water, the transparence of which seems not the least al∣tered, exhibits to him a sea swarming with whales: a piece of mouldy fruit presents to his view a mountain covered with forests, (like the Apennine to us) and towering to the clouds. He sees those small animals, of which he was far from suspecting even the existence, devour o∣thers still smaller; he sees them provided with organs suitable to all their wants, loaded with thousands of eggs ready to burst into life, which are to keep up the prodigious population of the species. If at this fight, he lets drop the micro∣scope with surprize, let him take up the telescope, and discover for the first time in the skies, an in∣numerable
<PB N="113" REF="045437_0111_1020285290F5B0A8"/>
crowd of unknown stars, beyond which lie an infinitely greater number, that he never will discover. On what side will he now be hardy enough to limit the creation? If to the Eternal Being time is without end, why should space and matter have bounds for the Almighty? Is the one less worthy of his glory than the o∣ther? The ages which our calculation can com∣prize, are, perhaps, to the duration of eternity, no more than the space occupied by the millions of worlds, that we can distinguish, are to the ex∣tent of infinity.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Crosby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, brother, what a sublime i∣dea you give me of the Supreme Being!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Glanville.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have hitherto only ad∣mired his power in the number and greatness of those prodigious bodies that fill the universe. But what wisdom, much more worthy of admi∣ration, hath he shewn in the equipoise in which they are kept up by the eternal concord of their movements! Cast your eyes first upon our solar system; beside the seven planets, and their sa∣tellites, which move through it in unchangeable order; behold upwards of sixty comets in the whole, revolve in it, whose dark excursions are traced: what an infinitely greater number still that we have never discovered. Geometry de∣monstrates, that from the form of their orbits, a million of these bodies could move round the sun, without incommoding each other's course. Rise now upon the wings of thought, traverse all those worlds in which the same harmony reigns throughout; go prostrate yourself at the foot of the Creator's throne, and behold from thence
<PB N="114" REF="045437_0112_1020285589628AC8"/>
the march of universal nature. What a specta∣cle opens to your eyes! Those stars, which to us here below, appear but immoveable lights, you behold in all their splendor, like suns moving in silence, with all their planetary train, round more powerful suns, who carry them also round suns still more glorious. What just proportions be∣tween these heavenly provinces, empires and worlds! what majesty of domination, and even of dependence! how all these intermingle with∣out confusion! What then shall be the invisible chain sufficiently strong to connect all the parts of an infinite whole? The great Newton has discovered it to us. It is one single principle of mutual attraction which the Supreme Being hath implanted in all bodies. This, combined with the impulse which they received on coming from his creative hand, and regulated by the propor∣tion of magnitudes and distances, is the universal agent of nature. This tends to re-unite what the projectile motion would separate. These two forces perpetually acting, balance each other and preserve among the worlds, that order which was established since the creation. Each body, nay, each system, attracts all the rest, as it is at∣tracted by them. A general reciprocity of at∣traction unites them, while it keeps them sepa∣rate, and acts as a prop to their orbits, without breaking in upon them. The suns which en∣lighten them, receive their reflected rays, that not an atom of light be dissipated in vain through the immensity of space. It seems as if the Al∣mighty would have traced, in this same law, the greatest principle of human morality; "Mor∣tals,
<PB N="115" REF="045437_0113_10202859D855FB00"/>
assist each other with your lights, and with your powers tend one towards the other, without departing from the sphere in which my provi∣dence has placed you. This order is establish∣ed as much for your happiness, as for the support of the universe."</P>
<P>The two children had not suffered a single word to escape them during the latter part of this conversation: but they were not silent from ab∣sence, it was from the impression of surprise with which they had been struck, and the attention that they had paid to the magnificent picture which was presented to them. Mr. Glanville, nevertheless, feared, left part of his discourse might have been lost to their apprehension, as he had not given them time to reflect on it: and therefore, as soon as he rose the next morning, he wrote down from memory, the two conver∣sations of the preceding evening. Emily and George read them over several times in the course of the day. Mr. Glanville promised to give them, in an evening walk, every explanation that they could desire on the subject of attraction, while he explained, at the same time, the motion of the earth round the sun, and that of the moon round the earth.</P>

<HEAD>SCENE Fairfax's tent before the walls of Colchester.</HEAD>
<P>THE civil war in England under Charles I. being, as it were, re-kindled, after a short cessation, the parliament, by resolving to present no more addresses to that unfortunate prince, then a prisoner in the Isle of Wight, filled the hearts of all honest men with indignation. Scot∣land, Wales, some towns in the North, part of the county of Surry, and even seventeen men of war in the parliament's pay, declared for the king. There were some risings also in his favour in the counties of Essex and Kent, which were supported by the zeal of the Earl of Surry, Lord Capel, Sir Charles Lucas, and Sir George Lisle. Against these Sir Thomas Fairfax was sent with a pretty numerous army. That able
<PB N="131" REF="045437_0129_1020288AB6681DA8"/>
General found no difficulty in defeating a few troops newly raised, and ill disciplined. He gained a complete victory over them at Maid∣stone in Kent; and pursuing their scattered re∣mains, he obliged both them and the royalists in Essex to shut themselves up in the town of Col∣chester, which he hastened immediately to invest.</P>
<P>The siege of Colchester is one of the most re∣markable events of that unfortunate period, on account of the obstinate defence made by the be∣sieged. It lasted from the 18th of June, to the end of August, 1648. The walls and fortifica∣tions of the town, said to have been built by the Romans, and remarkable for that strength and solidity which their works usually display, still exhibit dreadful marks of the fury of the siege. The greatest part of the churches in particular were half demolished by the batteries of the par∣liament army; but the besieged, notwithstanding the violent assaults of their adversaries, notwith∣standing the extremities to which they were re∣duced for want of provision, insomuch that they had nothing left for subsistence, but the horses of the garrison, continued to make brisk sallies, and defied all the force of the besiegers, in the un∣certain expectation of relief from some quarter or other.</P>
<P>At this period commences the action of the following drama, in which the principal object is, to delineate in its proper stre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gth, the resolute and generous character of Lord Capel, which was invariably displayed in every circumstance of his life and death. Such a character, it is
<PB N="132" REF="045437_0130_1020288C46239820"/>
presumed, will not be found uninteresting to the mind of a young reader; and in order to re∣present it to the fullest advantage, at the end of the drama, are subjoined some interesting par∣ticulars concerning the death of that virtuous nobleman.</P>
<P>It remains, however, to be observed, that the fact upon which the drama principally turns, is by no means advanced as authentic. Neither Lord Clarendon, or any other writer of that age, takes the least notice of it. Nor has Hume, or such modern historians, as from their aversion to the republican party, it might be supposed would not let slip such an incident, made any mention of the circumstance. It depends, there∣fore, entirely upon the credit of Monsieur Ra∣guenet, who in his life of Cromwell relates it at large, with many particulars, which at least give it the appearance of probability.</P>

I will indulge him with the satisfaction of seeing and embracing his son; but when I represent to him the calamities into which his obstinate rashness will inevitably draw him, I should wish Arthur to enforce my remon∣strances with his own entreaties and solicitati∣ons.</P>

<P>Ah, father! I fear—</P>

<P>I know Arthur well; he is too du∣tiful a son to attempt dissuading his father from what he thinks his duty.</P>

<P>When necessity obliges him to do so, it is the strongest proof that he can give him of his respect and affection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edmond.</SPEAKER>
<P>He will never think so.</P>

<P>His interest requires that he should be convinced of it. Are not you his friend?</P>

<P>O Sir, can you ask that? Next to my parents, I love him best upon earth. At this very moment, when our fathers are opposed in arms, I would lay down my life to save his.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fairfax.</SPEAKER>
<P>Far from condemning this ardor, I admire it; it shews me that my son's heart is ca∣pable

of the noblest efforts of generosity. Such sentiments make us worthy of the godlike blessing of friendship. You would die for your friend; then surely you will save him.

<HEAD>SEQUEL.</HEAD>
<P>Cromwell, who was sent by General Fairfax to oppose the Duke of Hamilton and Sir Mar∣maduke Langdale, having defeated those two ge∣nerals successively, and taken the duke prisoner, and the Earl of Holland having also been defeat∣ed, and made prisoner, by another detachment of the parliament-army; the inhabitants of Col∣chester, who only held out, in hopes of being re∣lieved, saw themselves, at length, reduced to the necessity of capitulating: they deputed persons to Fairfax, to treat of the surrender of the town upon honorable terms; but he, provoked at the obstinacy of their defence, offered them no other than to surrender at discretion. Upon receiving this answer, the besieged spent two days more in consultation: the first resolution taken by the of∣ficers, was, to force their way through the ene∣my's camp, sword in hand; but the few horses, which their hunger had spared, were found too weak for this attempt: on the other hand, the soldiers, exhausted with fatigue, were unable to sustain another assault; so that they were obliged, at length, to open the gates to Fairfax, and to submit to the conditions that he should think proper to impose on them.</P>
<P>He suffered the soldiers to depart, but without arms or baggage; but the officers he ordered to be confined in the town-hall, and a list of their names to be sent to him. Ireton, whom Crom∣well,
<PB N="159" REF="045437_0157_102028DC28827FA8"/>
in his absence, had left as a spy upon the unsuspecting general, chose out of this lift such as were more particularly his enemies, in order that they might be put to death. Sir Charles Lucas, therefore, Sir G. Lisle, and Sir Barnard Gascoyne, were brought before the council of war, where Fairfax declared to them, that for a punishment of their obstinate resistance, and a warning example to all others who should be in∣clined to imitate it, they were sentenced to die, that very day, at the foot of the castle-walls.</P>
<P>When this sentence was communicated to the other prisoners, Lord Capel prevailed upon an officer of the guard which was over them, to de∣liver to the council of war a letter signed by the principal officers, intreating them to revoke their cruel sentence, or else to extend it to all the pri∣soners, who blushed to see themselves excepted from it. This generous request had no other ef∣fect, than to hasten the execution of their unfor∣tunate companions.</P>
<P>Sir Charles Lucas, who was the first officer shot, gave the signal to his murderers to fire, with as much coolness as he would have delivered the word of command to his own men. Lisle, see∣ing him fall, ran to him, and embraced his dead body, and then rising, looked with a stern air upon the soldiers by whom he was to be shot, and ordered them to come nearer. One of them answered him, that they were near enough, and that they should not miss him. My friends, re∣plied he, smiling, I have been nearer to you, and yet you have missed me.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="045437_0158_101FFAC99453DB80"/>
Sir B. Gascoyne, or Guasconi, a Florentine gentleman, was spared by the council of war, under the apprehension left the Grand Duke of Tuscany, informed of such a violation of the laws of war, should retort upon the English who might be found in his dominions.</P>
<P>After the execution of Lisle and Lucas, Ge∣neral Fairfax, accompanied by G. Ireton, went to the town-hall to see the prisoners. In ad∣dressing himself to the Earl of Norwich and Lord Capel, he endeavored, with a soothing ci∣vility, to excuse the rigour which military justice had exacted from him. But Lord Capel, who looked upon Ireton as the sole instigator of this barbarity, loaded him with the bitterest reproaches, which, however, the latter very soon found an opportunity of revenging.</P>
<P>The parliament having ordered the Lords Norwich and Capel to be confined in Windsor Castle, they found the Duke of Hamilton there before them, with whom they had the melancho∣ly satisfaction of deploring their misfortunes in common. They were soon, however, removed to the Tower, there to await the destiny which parliament should think proper to allot to them.</P>
<P>About a month after King Charles I. was be∣headed, another high court of justice was formed for the trial of these three noblemen, as also of the Earl of Holland and Sir John Owen, who had taken an active part in Wales, in favor of the king, and killed, with his own hand, a sheriff of the opposite party.</P>
<P>Lord Capel appeared with the greatest firmness and dignity in the presence of his judges, and re∣fused
<PB N="161" REF="045437_0159_102028DF20272F98"/>
to acknowledge their authority; alledging, that as a soldier and a prisoner of war, he was not amenable to the civil law. Upon which Bradshaw, who was president of the court, an∣swered him with unfeeling insolence, by alluding to their form of proceeding against the king, "that they had tried a much better man than his lordship." After some debates, in which Ireton broke out with all the violence and fury of his natural disposition, sentence was passed upon Lord Capel and the other prisoners. They were all condemned to lose their heads; upon which it is said, that Sir John Owen made the judges a low bow, and thanked them for the high honor which they conferred on him, in or∣dering him, who was but a poor Welch gentle∣man, to lose his head in company with noblemen of so considerable rank; adding, that his greatest fear had been, lest the common hangman should have terminated his destiny. The prisoners were allowed but three days to set their affairs in order, and to prepare for death.</P>
<P>Lady Capel employed this short space in draw∣ing up a petition to be laid before parliament; when read, it was very strongly supported by se∣veral members, who spoke in the highest terms of Lord Capel's many and eminent virtues. E∣ven Cromwell praised his lordship so highly, and professed so much respect and friendship for him, that every one expected him to be inclined in his favor, when he added, in a hypocritical canting tone, that his zeal for the public cause got the better of all his private affections; that he knew Lord Capel to be the last man in England who
<PB N="162" REF="045437_0160_102028E0B5148810"/>
would abandon the royal party; that his inflex∣ibility of principle, his experience and valor, the number and attachment of his friends, made him the most formidable enemy that parliament had; that as long as he lived, let him be reduced to whatsoever condition he might, they would find him always a thorn in their sides; and he con∣cluded with protesting, that his conscience, and the interests of the commonwealth, imposed it on him as a duty to give his vote against the pe∣tition.</P>
<P>The implacable Ireton vented his hatred and animosity with less disguise: he vehemently main∣tained, in the house of commons, the sentence which he had procured to be passed in the high court of justice. Though there was not a single person who knew Lord Capel's character, but entertained the highest esteem and veneration for him, and very few who had any subject of per∣sonal quarrel against him, yet Cromwell and Ire∣ton thus appearing his declared enemies, the jus∣tice due to his virtues, and the compassion which his misfortunes inspired, were put to silence by the terror of those two names, and his fate was given up to their revenge.</P>
<P>Of the number condemned, the Earl of Nor∣wich and Sir John Owen received a pardon. The former having presented a petition to par∣liament, the house divided upon it, and the num∣bers on both sides were found to be equal; the Speaker, therefore, whose vote was to determine the earl's destiny, having formerly been under o∣bligations to him, was induced, from a motive of gratitude, to save his life.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="045437_0161_102028E6C5033BD0"/>
Sir John Owen was so indifferent about his, that he had not so much as thought of petition∣ing. Ireton whimsically made this very negli∣gence a plea in his favor, when he moved the house to spare his life. He thought, perhaps, by this exception, to offer a fresh insult to the three noblemen, and to make their death more grat∣ing, by shewing them a private person saved from the rigour of his sentence, without ever pe∣titioning, while their applications were so con∣temptuously rejected.</P>
<P>A scaffold was therefore erected under the windows of the parliament house. After the Duke of Hamilton and the Earl of Holland had suffered, Lord Capel was called: he walked down Westminster Hall with a serene counte∣nance and a firm step, saluting his acquaintances with dignity. Dr. Morley, his friend, who had not quitted him, from the moment of his con∣demnation, was solicitous to accompany him now, that he might receive his last commands: but he was stopped by the soldiers, at the foot of the scaffold. My lord took leave of him, em∣braced him affectionately, thanked him for all his attentions, and would not suffer him to go any further, lest he should be exposed to the bru∣tality of the guards. Advancing then towards the edge of the scaffold, he looked round him with a placid countenance, and asked whether the other lords had spoken to the people unco∣vered, and being answered in the affirmative, he gave his hat to one of the attendants to hold; then, with a clear bold voice, he declared that he came to lose his life for an action which he could
<PB N="164" REF="045437_0162_102028E9B111D038"/>
never repent of; that having been brought up in principles of attachment to the constitution of his country, loyalty to his sovereign, and fidelity to his religion, he had never violated any of these principles; that he was now condemned to die, contrary to all the laws of the realm, and that, nevertheless, he submitted to this unjust sentence.</P>
<P>He then enlarged upon the praises of that king whom they had recently murdered, and be∣sought heaven not to avenge this crime on the deluded nation. He concluded, with earnestly exhorting them to acknowledge the son of Charles as their rightful sovereign. Lastly, after a short and fervent prayer, he stretched his neck to the fatal blow, which deprived England of the most virtuous citizen that she had left her.</P>

<HEAD>THE LAWSUIT.</HEAD>
<P>FARMER BLUNT, when he died, left two sons, the one named Roger, the other Hum∣phrey. His death put them in possession of farms sufficiently advantageous to afford them a decent competency. Very little was wanting to their happiness. Alas! then, why could they not live in that harmony and good understand∣standing which Nature designed should subsist be∣tween brothers, when she formed them of the same blood?</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="045437_0163_102028EB3AD0FDD8"/>
Among the possessions left by their father, was a very fine orchard, which he had cultivated in his life time with particular care. As it bore, most years, a prodigious quantity of apples, re∣markable for making the best cyder, it appeared to both the brothers a very desirable lot; but, unfortunately, in the partition of their father's lands made by his will, the property of this was left undetermined.</P>
<P>Each, therefore, claimed the possession of it, and obstinately persisted in supporting that claim. They no longer spoke to each other in amicable terms; on the contrary, their mutual obstinacy degenerated on both sides into a confirmed ha∣tred. You are not an honest man, said Roger, for claiming what is my property, and you do not deserve to be master of so good a piece of ground. Humphrey, in a rage, would answer, it well becomes you to talk so, lazy fellow as you are: Have you not always made my father un∣happy, by your drunkenness? What would be∣come of those trees, in your idle hands? In two or three years the orchard would not be worth sixpence.</P>
<P>The curate of the village being informed of their quarrel, went to them, and expostulated with them in the most friendly manner. What are you doing, my friends? said he; wherefore are you weary of living happily together? Shall this orchard be the means of disuniting you? Why not rather join your industry to improve it, and afterwards divide the produce?</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="045437_0164_102028EE8A010130"/>
I do not intend any such thing, said one, I will have it all to myself. We shall see that, re∣plied the other, I think <HI>I</HI> shall have it.</P>
<P>Well, then, said the clergyman, let the most reasonable of you resign his claim, upon receiv∣ing a suitable consideration from the other.</P>
<P>With all my heart, cried they, both at once, let my brother give it up to me. I have most right to it, said the eldest. It belongs to my farm, said the youngest.—Oh, I am resolved to have it, now I have once taken it in my head.—You may take it out again, if you will; I would sooner give you my right hand.</P>
<P>Since you are both so obstinate, said the cu∣rate, and cannot agree together, will you leave the decision of the matter to fortune, and dispose of it by lot? No, I will risk nothing, said Hodge. Nor I, neither, said Numps. Last of all, the gentleman proposed to them to sell the orchard, and divide the money; but this proposal also was equally rejected on both sides.</P>
<P>I see, said the worthy clergyman, nothing can overcome your obstinacy: you will soon find the miserable effects of mutual hatred in hearts, which were intended by nature to be dear to each other.</P>
<P>The brothers did not trouble themselves about this prophecy, but each of them went to the man of law whom he thought most capable of setting off his claim to advantage. Thus began a lawsuit, which seemed easy enough to be deci∣ded, but was kept on foot, nevertheless, for five whole years; the counsel on both sides being veterans in the business. If one party put in a
<PB N="167" REF="045437_0165_102028F2D99DF7D8"/>
<HI>plea,</HI> the other intercepted it with a <HI>demurrer.</HI> It was, every term, fresh <HI>writs, declarations,</HI> and <HI>re∣joinders.</HI> The orchard all this while, we may suppose, was not so well cultivated as in the time of honest Farmer Blunt: those fine apple-trees were neglected, and did not produce near their usual quantity. Horses and pigs were suffered to break in and damage them; Humphrey, who had the orchard in his hands, being too much taken up with his lawsuit to attend to the culture of it.</P>
<P>They were both married to very amiable wo∣men, and had many children, in whom they would have been perfectly happy, had their minds been more at ease.</P>
<P>Each of their wives would sometimes accost them thus: My dear husband, why are you so uneasy? We have every thing that our hearts can wish; Have we not? You are in very good health, so am I. Our little family goes on charmingly; then we have an excellent farm; and, you know, it is your own fault if you do not make money by it. Why will you not chuse to be happy? Each of them would mutter be∣tween his teeth, and answer, How can I be hap∣py, while I have such a good-for-nothing bro∣ther? His injustice and obstinacy are poison to my happiness.</P>
<P>When, at their return from the field, they saw their children running joyfully towards them, they would cry out to them, before they came near, What do you want with me? Get away. I am not in a humour, now, to mind your tricks; I am too angry: and if the poor children strove
<PB N="168" REF="045437_0166_102028F5D1AC79A0"/>
to soften them, by their innocent fondness, they would push them away harshly, and sometimes give them very violent blows.</P>
<P>At table, nothing could please them, because their hearts were filled with gall; and, in bed, it was out of their power to sleep, because they were eternally thinking how to hurt each other.</P>
<P>Perhaps you may suppose that I have now told the worst. Alas! no. From ill-will they were carried to slander and calumny: each strove how to blacken the character of his brother the most. If Numps happened to be in company with o∣ther farmers, he would strive to persuade them that Hodge was a very bad man, who labored to ruin him first, and would then go to law with every man in the parish. And as Hodge, for his part, was not backward in saying much the same of Humphrey, the end of it was, that people be∣lieved them both: so that, in short, they were shunned by every body, as dangerous persons; and there was not one of their neighbours who did not wish to see the village fairly rid of them.</P>
<P>After five years of jarring and brawling at law, judgment was given; and he who gained the cause, saw himself obliged, very soon, to sell not only the orchard, but the greater part of his farms, to pay the expenses of the suit.</P>
<P>I leave you to guess how the loser came off. In fact, the confusion of them both may more easily be imagined than described.</P>
<P>Well, said Numps, we have both of us deser∣ved this. It was in our own power to have a∣voided it. We might still have had our farms and our money. Instead of all the trouble that
<PB N="169" REF="045437_0167_102028F75B29A8B8"/>
we have each caused the other, we should have made one another, as well as our own families, happy, and have gained the friendship and esteem of our neighbors.</P>
<P>See, said Hodge, all this we have lost by our folly. Ah! if things were to begin again!</P>
<P>Marry, said Numps, let us be wiser for the fu∣ture. Come, brother, here is my hand, I will never be your enemy as long as I live.</P>
<P>Nor I your's, replied Hodge, taking his hand. So saying, they both shed tears, and the bitter∣ness of hatred departed from their hearts.</P>
<P>They very soon found themselves much easier in living upon friendly terms with each other; but the ill effects of their former perverseness they were destined to feel for a long time. They saw their orchard, which had been the possession of their family for some generations, turn to good account in the hands of strangers, while the little that remained to them of their own farms took some time to recover from the ill-manage∣ment of five years. Besides, derision was swift to pursue them in the village, while confidence and amity returned to them with a slow pace. The alacrity of their advocates, in receiving the fee, had thinned their purses, while fatigue, fret∣ting, and large draughts of unwholesome law, impaired their health. Even their children did not now salute them with the free unconstrained affection which appears in the children of the virtuous and the benevolent. And their wives—Alas! it was some time before they could view their husbands with the tenderness of former years.</P>

<HEAD>LOST TIME RECOVERED.</HEAD>
<P>LORENZO'S parents were so much engaged in the way of business, that they found it impossible to superintend his education them∣selves. They had heard of a remarkably good school, where a number of young persons had been bred, who were distinguished for their im∣provement in learning, and for the principles of honour which they had imbibed. Though it was upwards of a hundred miles from his house, yet Lorenzo's father sent him thither, recom∣mending him, in the strongest terms, to the master. This gentleman, who regarded each of his pupils as his own son, spared no pains to correct his faults, to encourage him to study, and to implant sentiments of honour and generosity in his young breast. The persons also, whom he had chosen to assist him in these labours, ex∣erted their utmost to promote the same laudable purposes.</P>
<P>Yet these endeavours, so affectionately under∣taken in his favour, were not so successful as might naturally be hoped: Lorenzo was of a rest∣less, inconstant disposition, and would forget the sensible advice which was given him, even at the very moment that he received it. In the hours alotted to study, he suffered his thoughts to wander in such a manner, as not to possess the smallest attention for the lessons of his masters.
<PB N="171" REF="045437_0169_102028FD365A4E80"/>
All his occupations were sacrificed to the most frivolous amusements; and he shewed the same negligence in the care of his person and his books. His clothes were always in disorder; and, not∣withstanding his agreeable face and figure, one could not approach him, without feeling a certain distaste arise, on seeing so much slovenliness.</P>
<P>It is easy to conceive how prejudicial this in∣attention was to his advancement in learning. All his class-fellows left him far behind. There was not one, even to the smallest, who came to the school long after him, who did not look upon him with contempt, as they were, every day, outstripping him. Whenever any strangers of condition visited the house, he was always sent out of the way, left his shabbiness and wild ap∣pearance should disgrace his companions. He never appeared in the public yearly examinations that were held in the school: his ignorance would have been considered as a reproach to the esta∣blishment.</P>
<P>All these humiliating circumstances made no impression on him: still he continued in the same levity, the same dissipation, the same negligence. His teachers beheld him with a sort of inward regret; and their zeal for his improvement grew, every day, cooler and cooler. They would often say to each other, Poor Lorenzo! how unhappy he will make himself! What will his parents say, when they see him return home so full of ill habits, and so deficient in learning?</P>
<P>Two whole years had thus slipped away, with∣out the least profit to his education, when, at
<PB N="172" REF="045437_0170_1020290193ADF2D8"/>
the end of that time, he received a parcel, sealed with black: he opened it, and read the following letter:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Son,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have no longer a father. Heaven has deprived us of our protector and our friend: there now remains but you upon earth, who can afford comfort to my sorrow, by shewing your actions and your sentiments to be worthy of my affection; but if you were to deceive my expectations, if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> must renounce the pleasing hopes of seeing the virtues of him, whom I have lost, revive one day in your breast, I should have nothing left, but to die in despair.

Consider that you hold my destiny in your hands, and that you alone can now afford a moment's happiness to your</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Affectionate MOTHER.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Lorenzo's giddiness had not suppressed the feelings of nature in him; and this letter awaken∣ed them effectually. He burst into tears, wrung his hands, and, in a voice, broken with sobs, he cries, Ah! my father, my father; have I then lost you for ever! Taking the portrait, he presses it to his heart and his lips, and apostrophizes it
<PB N="173" REF="045437_0171_102029031D0B7878"/>
with these words: O dear author of my being, you have expended so much for my instruction, and I have not profited from it! You were so worthy a man, and I—No, I do not deserve to be called your son.</P>
<P>He spent the whole day in these bitter reflec∣tions. At night he went to bed, but in vain he turned himself to and fro: sleep visited him not. His imagination represented before his eyes, the form of his father, who, in an angry and terrible voice, thus rebuked him: unworthy boy, I have sacrificed my repose and my life, to make you happy, and you bring dishonour on my name, by your misconduct. His thoughts would then turn on his mother, and on the distress that he must occasion to her, instead of the con∣solation which she expected to receive from his return. What will be her distress, said he, when I shall appear before her, and have none but the most mortifying testimonies of my inattention to shew her, from my instructors! Instead of having cause to be proud of the education that she has given me, I shall force her to blush: she will wish to love me, and I shall deserve but her hatred. O my dear parent! I shall, perhaps, be the cause of her death. Oh, that I had pro∣fited better by the instructions that have been lavished upon me! Oh that I could recover the precious time that I have lost!</P>
<P>Thus did he torment himself the whole night, and bathe his bed with his tears. As soon as it was light, he rose in haste, intending to begin an immediate and persevering application to his studies; but meeting the head master, as he de∣scended
<PB N="174" REF="045437_0172_1020290667CA5B08"/>
to the school, he fell on his knees before him, and, O Sir, said he, you see here the most unfortunate child upon earth. I have not at∣tended to your words. I have learned nothing of what I should now know perfectly. Have com∣passion on me; I would not wish to make my mother die of grief.</P>
<P>The master was sensibly touched with this ad∣dress: he raised Lorenzo, and embraced him. My dear child, said he, since you see your fault, you may still repair it. You perceive how dread∣fully mortifying it is to have cause for self-reproach. Before you had a clear sense of your folly, you were barely blameable; but a con∣tinuance of it would be criminal in you now. Two whole years you have entirely lost: you have but another for the finishing of your studies. Judge how you must exert yourself. However, be not discouraged: there is nothing that cannot be accomplished with assiduity and perseverance. Begin, this very moment: it shall not be the fault of my zeal, if you are not very soon as well satisfied with yourself as you now have reason to be otherwise.</P>
<P>Lorenzo could thank him no otherwise, than by taking his hand, and pressing it to his lips. He than ran immediately to his form, and began to study his lesson, and continued to do the same every day following. His masters, astonished at such persevering diligence, sat immediately about cultivating his natural parts, with more care and attention than they had ever used be∣fore. His companions, who had conceived a mean opinion of him, were soon obliged to
<PB N="175" REF="045437_0173_1020290ADBB4DD70"/>
change it, for esteem. Encouraged by all these fortunate circumstances, Lorenzo every day re∣doubled his ardour and vigilance. He was no longer that giddy child who neglected every duty, to indulge himself in silly, trifling amusements. Order and cleanliness succeeded to his former slovenly manner; and his teachers were now obliged to force him away from his studies, in order to make him enjoy some relaxation. He would, sometimes, indeed, find himself insensibly relapsing towards his old habits, but he needed only to cast an eye upon his father's picture, to strengthen him afresh in hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>dable resolution.</P>
<P>The year which his mother had allowed him for the finishing of his studies, was drawing near a period: it seemed to glide away very rapidly, as he filled up every moment of his time, and therefore found it hardly sufficient for the sub∣jects of his application.</P>
<P>At length the hour of departure arrived. The change wrought in his character, had attached his companions to him so affectionately, that the thoughts of parting with him gave them extreme concern. His masters were grieved to see a youth depart, who now began to do credit to their instructions; and he was grieved no less at leaving his masters, whose prudent advice had so well supported him in his resolution: the head master, in particular, who began to felicitate him∣self on Lorenzo's progress, as his own proper work, was inconsolable; and his concern ap∣peared very strongly expressed, in a letter which he wrote to Lorenzo's mother, rendering her the
<PB N="176" REF="045437_0174_1020290C644E3C38"/>
most advantageous account possible, of her son's behaviour.</P>
<P>During the whole journey, Lorenzo's emo∣tions of hope, joy, and expectation, kept him <HI>tremblingly alive.</HI> His heart throbbed with the idea of re-visiting the scenes of his infancy; nor did he now dread so much to shew himself be∣fore his mother, because he was conscious, that for a twelvemonth past, he had neglected nothing that could tend to his improvement. Yet he could not help saying to himself, now and then, Fool that I was! Could I not have done the same thing three <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ears ago? I should be, at this day, much farther advanced in learning. How many things, of which I am now ignorant, might I not have learned in that interval! Alas, I might have spared myself many sorrowful and mortifying reflections.</P>
<P>His mother had come a part of the way to meet him. With what joy did she behold her dear son once more! The head master's letters had before informed her of his happy reforma∣tion: he now brought one from him, the con∣tents of which were still more flattering. A mother only wishes for new reasons, to love her son with redoubled fondness. Those reasons she found in the idea that Lorenzo had reformed his conduct, only out of affection for her; and, with a mother's eye, she looked presagingly forward to the happiness of his future life.</P>
<P>Lorenzo did not disappoint these hopes. Af∣ter dedicating a few days to the visits of his re∣lations and friends, he returned, with fresh ardor, to a life of application. The habit of being al∣ways
<PB N="177" REF="045437_0175_1020290F5B309240"/>
employed, gave strength to his understand∣ing, so that he soon acquired every information necessary, to qualify him for putting himself at the head of his family affairs. The manage∣ment of them was too laborious for a tender wo∣man, already much depressed by her grief; and her son's activity, diligence and skill, soon brought them into a flourishing state. A wealthy establishment, which he formed soon after, and the good order with which he conducted it, pla∣ced him in a situation, sufficiently at ease, to ena∣ble him to undertake, himself, the education of his numerous children. He endeavored, above all things, to make them thoroughly perceive the inestimable value of time; and to caution them, by his own experience, against ever exposing themselves to the unpleasant regret of having illy employed it.</P>

<HEAD>JASPER AND EMILIUS.</HEAD>
<P>MR. MEANWELL, who had been long absent from his native country, on ac∣count of a considerable employment that he held in the East-Indies, was at length returned to his family, in order to enjoy, in their peaceful soci∣ety, the ample fruits of his labors. He had but one son, about fourteen years of age, in whom his fondest hopes were centered. It was in or∣der to secure to this son the advantages of a
<PB N="178" REF="045437_0176_102029124FF44250"/>
splendid fortune, that he had devoted his life to business of the most laborious nature, far from his country and his friends. His views, in this respect, had been gratified beyond the extent of his wishes. He returned, loaded with wealth; but, alas! he very soon perceived how much better the time which he had spent in acquiring it, would have been employed, in personal atten∣tion to his son's improvement, and how much more likely such an attention would have been, to ensure him happiness, than all his riches.</P>
<P>Mrs. Meanwell, who was as w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>k in under∣standing as in constitution, had put young Jas∣per under the care of a family-tutor, who, in or∣der to keep his employment, had only studied to gratify the child's whims, and impose on the blind fondness of a mother, who idolized her son. Intoxicated with the flattery of all about him, Jasper had insensibly grown hardened in all the ill-habits that he had been suffered to con∣tract from his infancy. His tutor, whose igno∣rance, though tolerably profound, scarce equalled his meanness, frequently gave him to understand, that with the treasures which he was one day to possess, he had no occasion to impair his health by a close application to study; and that For∣tune, by the care which she had taken of him, had too favorably distinguished him from the rest of mankind, to subject him to the same labours. These perfidious insinuations accorded so well with the natural weakness and presumption of his pupil, that they effected the complete corrup∣tion of his heart and his understanding; Jasper was therefore become a confirmed liar, slothful,
<PB N="179" REF="045437_0177_1020291544F03C88"/>
insensible to the affections of his fellow-creatures, and so disgustingly conceited, as to look down upon all who were his inferiors in fortune, as if they were no, better than beasts of the field. Of all the stories with which the tutor amused his idleness, he listened only to those that afforded examples of pride and effrontery. Instances of courage, greatness of soul, and humanity, made no impression upon him; nor were his eyes ever moistened with those delicious tears which the recital of a virtuous action draws from the eyes of those who possess true generosity.</P>
<P>This odious character was not long concealed from Mr. Meanwell's observation. What a fa∣tal discovery for an affectionate father, who, re∣turning from the farthest parts of the earth, with the hopes of one day finding, in his son, the comfort and glory of his old age, saw him al∣ready possessed of every quality that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> unpro∣mising and disgraceful. His first care was, to dis∣miss the contemptible person, who had been made his instructor. Notwithstanding the bodi∣ly infirmities which already began to attack him, he resolved to take upon himself alone, the charge of remedying the faulty education of his son. He imagined, however, that he should succeed better in this undertaking, if he placed near him a child of a good disposition, and nearly his own age, whose behaviour might inspire him with a noble emulation. The choice of such a com∣panion, he thought, should not be left to chance. For several weeks he sought ineffectually for such an one, but happening one day to be riding in the country, and earnestly meditating upon his
<PB N="180" REF="045437_0178_10202918311EBCD0"/>
project, he perceived, at the entrance of a village, a number of young boys at play: one of them was possessed of so happy a physiognomy, that, at the first fight, Mr. Meanwell was captivated with him. He approached him, asked him a few questions, in a mild tone of voice, and received answers so replete with candor and simplicity, that they effectually confirmed in his mind the good opinion which the youth's countenance had excited. He learned from him, that he was the eldest of six children, that his father was the apothecary of the village, and barely able to maintain him and the rest of his family in the most limited mediocrity. These particulars hav∣ing given Mr. Meanwell some hopes, he begged the boy, whose name was Emilius, to conduct him to his father. He found him to be a sensi∣ble man, and one whose abilities, in a more en∣larged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>here, might have procured him the high∣est estimation. But, moderate in his desires, he preferred the tranquility of a retired country life, to the noisy bustle of the capital, and contented himself with the happiness of doing good to his poor neighbours, and of fulfilling the duty of a parent, to his numerous children. His wife, who was still young, had adopted his views, and pru∣dence seemed to divide, with happiness, the go∣vernment of his family. Mr. Meanwell, after having, for some time, discoursed with them con∣cerning their children, in order the better to un∣derstand the principles which they had followed in their education, soon perceived them to be such as corresponded with his own ideas. In the fullness of his joy, he took the apothecary by the
<PB N="181" REF="045437_0179_1020291B299CB9A8"/>
hand, and imparted to him the design that he had in view, with respect to his son, assuring him, that he would bring him up as his own, and that from that day forward he would take upon him the care of his fortune. The well-known integrity of Mr. Meanwell, and the reputation of his wealth and interest, would have induced pa∣rents, who were less affectionate, or more ambi∣tious, to accept his offers, without hesitation: but the parents of Emilius found a difficulty in parting with a son, who formed their principal happiness; and the boy himself was no less a∣verse to the proposal, than they were. However, the more objections they raised to the scheme, the more Mr. Meanwell, actuated by fresh senti∣ments of esteem, adhered to it. In short, he redoubled his solicitations so powerfully, that he, at length, shook their resolution. The frequent opportunities which would offer of seeing their son, and the hope that his advancement might, one day, contribute to that of his brothers and sisters, induced them, at length, to yield their consent; and Mr. Meanwell took his leave, filled with the most perfect and heartfelt satisfaction.</P>
<P>Three days were demanded by the parents of Emilius, to prepare him for appearing in town; at the end of that time, Mr. Meanwell appeared at their door. I will not attempt to describe to you the grief occasioned by the departure of a child, so dearly loved by his family. Emilius, who had had the courage to restrain his tears in the presence of his mother, for fear of increasing her sorrow, was no sooner seated in the carriage, than he let fall a flood of tears. Mr. Meanwell
<PB N="182" REF="045437_0180_1020291F8244F690"/>
did not seek, at first, to interrupt them, otherwise than by silent caresses; but when the first gush of sorrow was over, he took Emilius by the hand, and, kissing him, My boy, said he, be not afflicted; you see in me a second father, who will cherish you with as much affection as the parent whom nature has given you. Be honest, cour∣teous, and diligent, and nothing shall ever be wanting to your happiness.</P>
<P>Emilius was something eased by these marks of tenderness and affection. Then you shall be my other father, said he, pressing Mr. Mean∣well's hand between his, and I will make myself worthy of your friendship and regard.</P>
<P>Mr. Meanwell introduced Emilius into his house, upon the footing of a son, and ordered all his servants to treat him with the same respect; and his mild and sensible manner, soon gained him the affection of all that approached him. Jasper was the only person of the family, who could not behold him, without an emotion of envy. He soon perceived that the presence of this rival laid him under the necessity of altering his behaviour, and of becoming more diligent in his studies. Not being able to find in his heart any just foundation for hating Emilius, he thought that he might at least reasonably despise him, as the soon of a poor country apothecary. Dread∣ing, however, his father's displeasure, he was o∣bliged to keep these thoughts to himself, and therefore disguised them under the mask of friend∣ship. Emilius, who could not suspect in others a falshood to which his own heart was a stran∣ger, grew tenderly attached to him; he endea∣voured
<PB N="183" REF="045437_0181_102029214901D110"/>
to assist him in all his exertions, and to facilitate the labours of his study; at the same time, he put up with his pride and capriciousness, as one usually winks at the defects of a beloved friend.</P>
<P>He had already been accustomed, under the immediate direction of his father, to exert his powers of apprehension, so that he met with no∣thing, in the course of his study, that was capa∣ble of damping his ardour. Endowed with a lively penetration, and a powerful memory, and, especially, animated with the desire of meriting the applause and encouragement of Mr. Mean∣well, he made so rapid a progress, that his masters could scarcely believe it possible. He improved himself no less successfully in the exercises of the body; thus his manners became graceful, at the same time that his understanding was enlighten∣ed, and his heart expanded with sentiments of honor and generosity. Mr. Meanwell beheld him every day, with renewed affection; and even strangers were seldom twice in his company, with∣out feeling a secret prepossession in his favour. Polite, without affectation, attentive, without ser∣vility, chearful, without thoughtlessness, he enli∣vened, by his presence, the joy and happiness of the whole family. In the midst of these flat∣tering circumstances, Emilius, far from suffering the illusions of vanity to steal upon him, became only the more modest. Although he could not be insensible to his own superiority over Jasper, he would have been contented to call it in ques∣tion, and still better pleased to have hid it from the observation of others, for fear of mortifying
<PB N="184" REF="045437_0182_102029259E866078"/>
his friend. He was the first to defend him, or to make him appear to advantage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Ah! said he to himself, if my friend had not been so benefi∣cent to me, and so powerfully assisted me in eve∣ry laudable acquirement, 'spite of the affection∣ate cares of my father, I should still be far from knowing even what little I know. Other chil∣dren, in my situation, would, perhaps, have pro∣fited better from the opportunities indulged me by Providence. Jasper himself would, perhaps, have surpassed me, had he been in my situation, and I in his. He can do without learning, better than I can; the absolute necessity of acquiring it, has done every thing for me.</P>
<P>Eight years passed on thus, during which, E∣milius made himself master of every accomplish∣ment that is conferred by the most liberal educa∣tion. Time and place would fail me, were I de∣sirous to particularize to you the various mental acquirements with which he had stored his un∣derstanding. As to Jasper, it would be a still longer task, to enumerate all those which he had not. His natural self-sufficiency had persuaded him, that with a few terms of science, which was all that remained to him from his studies, he was a match for some of the ablest masters. His disposition, in the mean time, was, at bottom, very little altered; the fear of his father had, indeed, a little restrained his vicious impetuosi∣ties, but, in return, it had bestowed on him hy∣pocrisy, as a convenient mask to conceal them.</P>
<P>Mr. Meanwell, whose penetrating eye observed them, even through this veil, would have fallen a victim to the chagrin which he felt on this mor∣tifying
<PB N="185" REF="045437_0183_102029288FA13C68"/>
discovery, if the good behaviour of Emi∣lius had not afforded him a pleasing consolation. Nevertheless, when Jasper had reached his twen∣tieth year, the apprehensions that he formed to himself of his son's future impropriety of con∣duct, overbalanced every other consideration. While his heart was torn with these cruel reflec∣tions, he was seized with a violent disorder, which carried him off in a few days, in spite of the affectionate cares and ardent wishes that E∣milius testified for his recovery, even to the fatal moment which separated them for ever.</P>
<P>Jasper, freed as he now was from the curb which formerly restrained his passions, had scarce∣ly paid the last offices to his father, before he be∣gan to shew forth his natural disposition. Un∣grateful to the memory of an excellent father, in the person whom he had adopted as a second son, and forgetting the obligations that he him∣self bore to the same youth, he furiously shut his doors upon him, and flew down to his paternal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat in the country, there to make himself amends for his former constraint, by indulging a life of savage tumult and unbridled licentiousness.</P>
<P>How different were the emotions which im∣pelled the heart of Emilius, who was now re∣turned to the mediocrity of his father's house! he grieved, indeed, but not on account of his change of condition. Mr. Meanwell had made him a handsome provision for life; but his in∣terest gave him very little concern; it was the loss of his generous benefactor that he felt most sensibly: the recent loss of that friend who had taken care of his youth, whom he was accustom∣ed
<PB N="186" REF="045437_0184_1020292A1CE95630"/>
to look upon as a father, and in whom he had found all the affections of one. The sorrow oc∣casioned by this loss, brought on a sickness, which had nearly sent him after the friend whom he mourned. In the most violent fits of his deliri∣um, he pronounced only the name of Mr. Mean∣well. He even called his father by this name, whenever he sat by his bed, as the disorder de∣prived him of all knowledge of his relations. They were long apprehensive for his life: in ef∣fect, he owed his recovery to the vows and inde∣fatigable cares of a family, who all seemed only to exist in him.</P>
<P>After devoting a few months to the satisfacti∣on which his friends enjoyed in seeing his health re-established, and in admiring his virtues and accomplishments, Emilius returned to the capi∣tal, intending to enter upon one of the learned professions, and, in the mean time, resuming his studies with more eagerness and advantage than ever. He had gained the friendship and esteem of many persons of quality, during his residence at the house of Mr. Meanwell, who now united all their interest to procure him an advantageous establishment. The duke of—, having just finished his studies, was about to make the tour of Europe, and Emilius was recommended to his family, as a proper person to accompany him. Though he appeared very young, for such an office, he, nevertheless, impressed them so fa∣vourably, with respect to his character and con∣duct, that he was judged to be as trusty and in∣telligent a governor as they could send with the young nobleman. In the course of this tour, he
<PB N="187" REF="045437_0185_1020292EAC383C78"/>
found numberless opportunities of enlarging and applying the knowledge that he had acquired from study. His sprightly wit and engaging manners, made him a favorite at every court which his pupil visited. There were even some foreign princes, who distinguished him in a very flattering manner, and wished to attach him to their service; but his engagements to the young duke's family, made him decline every offer, how∣ever splendid. He was not long, without receiv∣ing the reward of his fidelity. He had scarce conducted his pupil home to his native country, when a nobleman of the same family, being ap∣pointed ambassador to one of the foreign courts, chose him for his secretary. During a long ill∣ness of the ambassador, Emilius managed the principal business of the embassy, which he per∣formed with so much ability, that, upon the mi∣nister's recommendation, he was entrusted with a very delicate negociation, in which he had the honor, as well as satisfaction, of rendering his country a service of the most important nature.</P>
<P>Jasper, in the mean time, had met with very different fortune: we left him in the country, upon his estate, harassing his game and his te∣nants. This way of life gave the finishing stroke to his manners; that is to say, it rendered them those of a brute, and his understanding seemed degraded to the grossest degree of rusticity. A quarrel with a neighboring country gentleman, in which his paltry behaviour covered him with shame and mortification, forced him to quit his country residence, and to come up again to Lon∣don: but even thither his infamy pursued him;
<PB N="188" REF="045437_0186_1020293034A399E8"/>
and being aggravated with the additional im∣peachment of fraud, became a subject of the most public notoriety.</P>
<P>Jasper now found himself excluded from all genteel company, where his father's name had formerly procured him a welcome. Unable to find a resource, either in study or reflection, he suffered himself to be carried away by the torrent of vicious example; and gaming soon suggested to him the design of selling his estate, and after∣wards furnished him with opportunities of dissi∣pating his money, while intemperance and de∣bauch, at the same time, made rapid havock with his constitution. In order to elude his creditors, whose importunities now became pressing, he determined to transport himself to the continent, and, by a singular accident, arrived in the very same town where Emilius resided, and where, for his many amiable and respectable qualities, he enjoyed the universal esteem of all parties.</P>
<P>The unhappy Jasper carried with him still his extravagant passion for play: fortune seemed at first to favour him in this new scene; and his ex∣pensive manner of living procured him credit. But it was not long, before his affairs fell into confusion; and his creditors, finding that he had treated them with the grossest impositions, sent him to prison, upon his not being able to satisfy their demands. The rumour of such a disgrace happening to one of his countrymen, soon occa∣sioned Emilius to come to the knowledge of his name. "Heavens!" cried he, "is the son of my dearest benefactor in a prison?" for he im∣mediately forgot Jasper's ungenerous behaviour
<PB N="189" REF="045437_0187_1020293323E5AE98"/>
toward him. He flew, therefore, to the dunge∣on where he was confined. But, alas! in what a dreadful condition did he find him! Pale, dis∣figured, pining in distress, wasted by pain, har∣rowed by remorse, and a prey to all the convul∣sions of rage and despair. He strikes off his chains, snatches him from this mansion of hor∣ror, carries him to his own house, and there treats him with the most affectionate care and attenti∣on. He would have sacrificed all his fortune to restore him to life, and to be the author of his happiness. But heaven had already dealt the a∣venging blow. Jasper survived this event but a few days. Emilius was grieved at his death, as much as if he had lost the most affectionate friend. He was inconsolable, that fate had put it out of his power to render to the son of his benefactor the kindnesses which he had received from the father. This reflection depressed his spirits a considerable time. Images of gloomy sadness were ever before his eyes, and haunted him, even in his most collected hours of business; but the alacrity with which he attended to his duty, and the command which he was accustomed to exer∣cise over himself, restored him at length to his u∣sual serenity of mind; and he continued to per∣form the offices of his employ, with a zeal and integrity, that soon advanced him to the exalted station in which we see him at this day.</P>

<HEAD>THE PUNISHMENT OF PRIDE.</HEAD>
<P>RUPERT, the son of an honest laborer, had early testified a strong inclination for the profession of arms. He was continually exerci∣sing with his spade, and had scraped acquaintance with every game-keeper in the neighborhood, in order that he might have an opportunity of hand∣ling their fowling-pieces. At the age of eigh∣teen, he enlisted as a soldier; and being (through the good care which his father had taken of his education) a tolerable proficient in writing and figures, he was very soon made corporal, and, af∣ter that, serjeant.</P>
<P>At the commencement of the war, his regi∣ment going abroad, he behaved himself so re∣markably well, the first ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>paign, as to obtain a pair of colours. He had been sent upon several hazardous expeditions, in which he shewed him∣self to be equally intelligent and brave; and it was remarked, to his praise, that a soldier had never turned his back, while under his command.</P>
<P>The general, who had been a witness to his bravery, in many engagements, now promoted him to the command of a company, in order to raise the emulation of his troops, by the exam∣ple of Rupert's good fortune. And, some cam∣paigns after, a very splendid action, that he per∣formed in a battle in which most of the elder cap∣tains
<PB N="191" REF="045437_0189_1020293913AEDD38"/>
were killed, was the occasion of his being elevated to the post of major.</P>
<P>Honorable mention had frequently been made of his name in the public papers; and his bro∣thers were often gratified by their neighbors, with the recital of actions considerably to his praise. It may easily be imagined how proud they were of being so nearly related to him. Whenever they spoke of him, they shed tears of joy. Their affection to him seemed to entitle them to a share in his reputation; and they wished for the hap∣py moment of his safe return, that they might embrace a brother who did so much honor to his kindred.</P>
<P>With all these good qualities, however, Ru∣pert possessed one which was very odious; his words and actions were marked with the most insupportable arrogance. There was no man in the world (to take his word for it) so sensible, or so intrepid as himself. He spoke of his own va∣liant deeds, as a flattering courtier would of those of a sovereign prince, before his face. He arro∣gated to himself more glory from them, than was justly due to him; and seemed insensible to the merit of the other officers, whenever they ac∣quitted themselves with as much gallantry as him∣self.</P>
<P>At the conclusion of the war, his regiment re∣turning home, was sent into country quarters, and (as it happened) by a route that led very near his own native village. As soon as ever his bro∣thers were apprized of this circumstance, they went off to meet him on the road, accompanied by a few friends, and arrived in a neighboring
<PB N="192" REF="045437_0190_1020293D6CF56640"/>
town, just as the division which he commanded of the regiment had entered, and was forming in the market-place.</P>
<P>My dear Rupert, said the elder brother, how happy I am to see thee, and how happy would our aged father be, were he alive this day! Hea∣ven be praised that we behold you safe returned from the dangers of war. For my part, I never felt myself so happy in my life as at this moment. Saying these words, he held out his hand, invi∣ting Rupert to a similar demonstration of frater∣nal amity. But the major, swelling with shame and indignation, to see a man, in a frize coat, call him brother, rejected his proffered salutation. You had better go home, said he, my friend. I have not time to talk to you at present. How! cried the younger brother, do not you know me neither? Look well at me: I am your brother George. You used to be very fond of me. It was from you that I learned to plow, when I was a boy.</P>
<P>The major now foamed with rage and despite, and having no other means to be rid of his un∣welcome relations, he caused his soldiers to make a sudden movement or evolution, which obliged the surrounding populace, and, among the rest, his brothers, to fall back, and retire from the spot of ground where he stood.</P>
<P>The two peasants, who had promised them∣selves so much joy and happiness in meeting with a brother that had been absent from them so ma∣ny years, returned home, full of grief and resent∣ment. They were scarce able to credit their senses, that such had been their indifferent recep∣tion
<PB N="193" REF="045437_0191_1020293EF654E3C8"/>
with one whom, notwithstanding his unna∣tural pride, they found themselves ready still to love as a brother.</P>
<P>The soldiers who were present at this disgust∣ing scene, did not, it is true, express their senti∣ments of it aloud, but they said to each other, in whispers, A man must have a very bad heart in∣deed, to be ashamed of his relations. Does our major think it a disgrace to be the same as we are? He ought, much rather, to be proud of having made his way, in the army, by merit, than to put on the airs of a man of family.</P>
<P>Rupert had not a soul formed for thinking so nobly: instead of remembering that he had once been a private soldier, he thought, by his assumed loftiness, to make his former comrades forget it. He treated them, therefore, with the last degree of contempt; but he appeared, in their eyes, much more worthy of this passion. His prefer∣ment, which before had given them so much sa∣tisfaction, now only served to mortify them. They obeyed his orders, but with reluctance; and every soldier in the regiment, wished him fairly out of it.</P>
<P>One day, when the corps to which he belong∣ed, was passing in review before a general, this officer made some remarks on the manoeuvres performed by the major, with his division, to which the latter replied in terms of the most pointed disrespect. His supercilious deportment had, already, more than once, offended his gene∣rals. This fresh breach of military subordina∣tion, underwent the severest animadversion; for, as it was too public and gross to be passed over in
<PB N="194" REF="045437_0192_101FFAC6DBA25F10"/>
silence, it became the subject of a general-court-martial, the decision of which compleated his ruin; for, even here, he expressed himself in lan∣guage so unguardedly personal against his prose∣cutor, and persisted, with such inflexible haughti∣ness, in refusing to make a submission, that he was sentenced to be cashiered, to the universal joy of his regiment.</P>
<P>Reduced, by this stroke, to his original pover∣ty, he was obliged to embrace the alternative, ei∣ther of struggling with indigence and necessity, or of employing means for his subsistence, which, before, he would have spurned, as unworthy of his rank and consequence. He had a small farm (if a piece of ground might be so called, that was scarcely large enough for a cabbage-garden) situated close by his native village. As (by his father's will) he had not the power of selling it, in the life time of his brothers, he had let it to one of them upon his entering the army, but al∣ways thought the rent of it, though accumulat∣ing, an object of so small importance, particular∣ly after he was made an officer, that he had, since that time, in his own mind, almost wholly re∣nounced the property of it, as he had the memo∣ry of his origin, and the relationship of the per∣son who was his tenant. He now found him∣self, however, under the necessity of deriving, from this patch of ground, the means of his im∣mediate subsistence, by making application to his brother for the rent arising from it. For this purpose, a journey to the place of his nativity was, if not indispensable, at least highly expedi∣ent; and then it was when the peasants and vil∣lagers,
<PB N="195" REF="045437_0193_10202944D4EAA510"/>
his former acquaintances, saw him come down among them, stripped of his plumes, and reduced to the same state of harmless obscurity with themselves, that they repaid him his former insolence, with usury. However, as he courted the friendship of none, in return none offered him their society. Thus he saw himself depri∣ved of one of the greatest blessings that human life can afford, particularly to those who are un∣der the pressure of adversity.</P>
<P>If the other inhabitants of the village were of∣fended at Rupert's unnatural pride, his brothers had, certainly, the first cause to resent it, having been the more immediate objects of his insult. Perhaps, therefore, you fear, lest they should, in their turn, have slighted him. "We know you not," would have been a just answer to all his applications and advances toward reconcili∣ation: but, fortunately for him, the brothers possessed that real greatness of spirit which he wanted. They sought no other satisfaction, than that of conferring kindnesses on him. For this purpose, the renter of his little farm, not only re∣stored it to him in good condition, together with the revenues thence accruing, but concerted with the other brother, the means of settling him comfortably, on a moderate farm, if he chose to embrace that way of life. This, as they were thriving, responsible persons, they found no great difficulty to effect; and Rupert returned once more to the happy occupation, from which am∣bitious and chimerical dreams of glory, had for∣merly seduced him. But he was, by no means, happy in his condition. Every day, as he went
<PB N="196" REF="045437_0194_102029493044B850"/>
about those labours, which he had so long dis∣dained, the thoughts of his former elevated hopes and expectations, continually haunted him. How did he suffer, under the mortifying thought, that he owed almost his present existence, to those, whom he, on the contrary, might, comparatively speaking, have made rich men. Accursed pride! he would say, to what a pitiable degree hast thou humbled me!</P>
<P>This cutting reflection filled his hours with bitterness; and he died, in a short time, devour∣ed with chagrin, leaving a melancholy example to those whom the same intoxicating passion might tempt to despise the sound admonitions of reason and modesty.</P>

<HEAD>THE INCREASE OF FAMILY.</HEAD>
<P>HONEST farmer Townsend was on a vi∣sit to his sister, who had been a few years married, and lived at the distance of nine or ten miles from his habitation. One evening, a little before supper, as he sat with her and her husband beside their cottage door, and discoursed with them concerning family affairs, there passed by a little girl about five years of age, and totally in rags. Townsend remarked the miserable ap∣pearance of her whole person, and said to his sister, "There is a poor little girl, very much to
<PB N="197" REF="045437_0195_1020294AB9C12FD0"/>
be pitied. Not one rag about her seems to af∣ford her a covering. It is a disgrace to your pa∣rish. Her father must have very little industry, and her mother very little feeling."</P>
<P>Alas! answered his sister, she has no father nor mother, and there are two other children, beside her, of the same family, who are equally wretched. Through some dispute between two different parishes, (each asserting this destitute family to belong to the other) the poor children wander up and down the country, without house or home. They lie, at night, in barns, or under hedges. When hunger becomes trou∣blesome, they go and sit down before the doors of cottages. If any body gives them a morsel of bread, they receive it with joy; but they ne∣ver ask any thing. Their father, who was a man of spirit, though reduced by sickness, to the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st deplorable state of poverty, forbad them, with his dying lips, to beg.</P>
<P>This recital affected the honest farmer very much. It is shocking, said he, that any poor creatures should be so neglected by the rest of their species: I will take them, added he, under my care, since nobody here wishes to be charged with them. His sister, and her husband, thought it their duty to dissuade him, as strongly as possi∣ble, from this undertaking. They told him, that he had children of his own, that he knew nothing about these, that they were, for three months past, accustomed to a lazy vagabond life, and that it was a matter of doubt, whether they would ever turn to good. Then, brother, con∣sider, added they, what an addition of trouble
<PB N="198" REF="045437_0196_1020294DE05EE938"/>
they will cause to your wife, and what a burden they will be in your family.</P>
<P>Townsend was not one of those weak men, who suffer themselves to be diverted from the performance of a laudable design, by a few diffi∣culties accompanying it. He was not very soli∣citous to hear all their objections, and still less to answer them.</P>
<P>He rose, therefore, from his seat, in order to retire to rest: but his scheme of benevolence, in favour of the orphans, kept him long awake, by exciting, in his mind, reflections of a tenderer cast than usual; and the moisture of generous compassion was still upon his eyelids, when they closed in sleep for the night.</P>
<P>The next morning early, he sent for the eldest girl, who was about twelve years of age. I was given, said he, to understand, yesterday, that your father and mother are dead, and I see, by your dress, that they have not left you any great mat∣ters of fortune.</P>

<P>Ah! if you would take me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Townsend.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, then, that is settled: but I am going home on horseback, and could not take you all three together. It was the youngest sister that I saw first: I will begin with her.
<PB N="199" REF="045437_0197_10202950D346A588"/>
Bring the child to me. Let us be acquainted together.</P>
<P>The youngest girl soon came. She had a countenance so mild, and gained so much upon the farmer, by her little fond caresses, that he looked upon himself already as her father. He took her up, therefore, before him, on his horse; and when they arrived at the farm-house, his wife asked him whose child that was. It is your's, Maria, answered he, and began withal to relate to her, how, the day before, he had seen the little child, and been informed of her wretched and friendless situation; how he had compassion on her, and took her home with him, in order to support her as one of his own children.</P>
<P>During all this relation, the little girl crept close to the farmer's skirt, and shed tears without ceasing. Maria, who was as compassionate as her husband, sympathized with the little orphan; she took her up in her lap, and endeavoured to soothe her with these words: "Since my hus∣band has promised to be your father, I will be your mother too. Come then, my dear child, do not cry any more."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Townsend.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, wife, there are two others be∣sides, who are equally worthy of our compassion, the brother and sister of this little one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! my dear, I see what you mean. Well, we must send for them.</P>
<P>The next day, the farmer put the horse to his chaise-cart, and went for the other two orphans.</P>
<P>Go, said his wife, embracing him at his depar∣ture, go, my dear; and that Being, who sends
<PB N="200" REF="045437_0198_102000BF9F8EB858"/>
us these children, will not fail to send us, also, bread for their nourishment.</P>
<P>Mr. Justice Garboil, however, thought other∣wise. He had been landlord to the father of these unfortunate little ones, and was well appri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed of their distress. Hearing the farmer had taken them home to his house, he dispatched his clerk to him, with a peremptory injunction to send the children to their own settlement, (which, it has been observed before, was in litigation) or, in failure thereof, to give security to his own pa∣rish, that they should never become chargeable to it.</P>
<P>Farmer Townsend was filled with indignation on receiving such a message. If this, cried he, be his worship's humanity, I would rather be the child of misery, for an age, than accept the con∣dition of that overswoln bashaw, during his most self-complacent hour. Let me know, however, what bail is required; I am ready. Poor inno∣cents! the more I see oppression endeavour to tread you down, the dearer you become to me, and the more I feel myself interested to protect you.</P>
<P>After the farmer had satisfied every demand of Justice Garboil, he returned to his house, and now, said he, surely these children are mine. No∣body will question my being a father to them, by one title or other.</P>
<P>You are anxious, no doubt, my young friends, to know what became of these children, in the se∣quel. Luckily, I can inform you, by relating to you a conversation between Farmer Townsend
<PB N="201" REF="045437_0199_101FFC6B45D3C688"/>
and a person who happened to be travelling in that part of the country, some years afterwards.</P>
<P>All the little family were at play together, one evening, before the farmer's door, while Maria was getting their supper ready. He himself was in the midst of them, partaking of their sport and festivity. The traveller happened to pass by, just at the time, and stopped to gaze on this speci∣men of rural happiness.</P>
<P>Are all these children your's, neighbour? said he to the farmer.</P>
<P>Yes, Sir, answered Townsend: I have ten of them alive; seven that Providence bestowed on me, and three that I have purchased.</P>
<P>Purchased? said the traveller, much surpri∣zed.</P>
<P>Why, Sir, it was, in some sense, a purchase, replied the farmer, and, upon this, told him the whole story, adding, as he concluded it, thank heaven, neither my wife nor I have, at any time, repented of the action. It was the best bargain that ever I made in my life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The traveller.</SPEAKER>
<P>There must be no small ex∣pense in the maintenance of such a family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Townsend.</SPEAKER>
<P>It seems, at first view, a difficult matter to find bread for them all, without an es∣tate; for any one can easily spend the fruits of his own labour: and, unless you were to make a trial, you would scarcely think it possible to be done. I owe, perhaps, to this difficulty, the good management which has ever kept me above want; but when a man is sober, laborious and circumspect, he will always have a trifling super∣fluity for the unfortunate.</P>

<P>And your children are not jea∣lous of these strangers?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Townsend.</SPEAKER>
<P>Strangers? There are none here. We are all one family promiscuously. There is no strife, but which will be the most loving and affectionate. I give you leave to guess which are my children by birth; at times I can hardly distinguish them myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The traveller.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I do not see the elder of the girls among them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Townsend.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I dare say not, for she has o∣ther business in hand; she must look after her own houshold.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The traveller.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is she married, then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Townsend.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, that she is. She fell into the nets of a fisherman, one that hauls them to some account, I promise you, and makes a good liveli∣hood by his trade. It is true, I furnished him pretty plentifully with stock.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The traveller.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, did you give her a por∣tion, then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Townsend.</SPEAKER>
<P>That' must be done, to get a daughter off your hands. Look you at his boats and fishing-tackle, if they are not the compleatest on this coast.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The traveller.</SPEAKER>
<P>Still you have no occasion to have done that. She was nothing to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Townsend.</SPEAKER>
<P>No? She made me happier than any of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y own has been able to make me as yet, on account of their age. She has a young daughter already, who calls me grandfather.—That sounds so droll!</P>
<P>Farmer Townsend then entertained the tra∣veller with the happiness and satisfaction that he
<PB N="203" REF="045437_0201_101FFC6F5D44CC40"/>
enjoyed, in the improvement of the other two orphans.</P>
<P>The youngest girl, says he, is big enough al∣ready, to assist my wife in the business of the house. As to the boy, there is not his fellow in the country, for tending a flock. Ah! if you knew how fond they all are of me, and how much I love them in return!</P>
<P>His heart was softened at this recital of his own, and a tear of benevolence moistened his eye. He wiped it away, however, immediately, and said, with an ironical smile, Ah! Justice Garboil, Justice Garboil, you might have had all this happiness, if your heart could have known a duty beyond the letter of the law. You forced me to give bail; but you little thought it was to ensure to me, for life, a happiness to which you have ever been a stranger.</P>

<HEAD>THE HUMOUROUS ENGAGEMENT.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This story is taken from the history of Sandford and Merton, and the following piece from a Dutch novel, in a series of letters.</NOTE></HEAD>
<P>TOMMY Merton, the son of a gentleman of fortune, and Harry Sandford, the son of an honest farmer, were both under the care and instruction of Mr. Barlow, a country clergy∣man. Harry, in one of his walks with Mr. Bar∣low, had saved a young chicken from the claws
<PB N="204" REF="045437_0202_101FFC710F77ABC8"/>
of a kite. He had taken the greatest care possi∣ble of its little wounds, and fed it every day with his own hands. The little animal was now per∣fectly recovered of the hurt it had received, and shewed so great a degree of affection to its pro∣tector, that it would run after him like a dog, hop upon his shoulder, nestle in his bosom, and eat crumbs out of his hand. Tommy was ex∣tremely surprized and pleased, to remark its tame∣ness and docility, and asked by what means it had been made so gentle. Harry told him he had taken no particular pains about it, but that, as the poor little creature had been sadly hurt, he had fed it every day till it was well, and that in con∣sequence of that kindness, it had conceived a great degree of affection toward him. Indeed, said Tommy, that is very surprizing, for I thought all birds had flown away, whenever a man came near them, and that even the fowls which are kept at home would never let you touch them.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Barlow.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what do you imagine is the reason of that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tommy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because they are wild.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Barlow.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what is a fowl's being wild?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tommy.</SPEAKER>
<P>When he will not let you come near him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Barlow.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then a fowl is wild, because he will not let you come near him; and will not let you come near him, because he is wild: this is saying nothing more than, that when a fowl is wild, he will not let you approach him. But I want to know what is the reason of his being wild?</P>
</SP>

<PB N="205" REF="045437_0203_101FFC73BAAD4938"/>
<SPEAKER>Tommy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Sir, I cannot tell, unless it is because they are naturally so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Barlow.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if they were naturally so, this fowl could not be fond of Harry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tommy.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is because he is so good to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Barlow.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very likely. Then it is not natural for an animal to run away from a person that is good to him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tommy.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, I believe not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Barlow.</SPEAKER>
<P>But when a person is not good to him, or endeavours to hurt him, it is natural for an animal to run away from him; is it not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tommy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Barlow.</SPEAKER>
<P>And then you say that he is wild; do you not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tommy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Barlow.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, then, it is probable that animals are only wild, because they are afraid of being hurt, and that they only run away, from the fear of danger. I believe you would do the same from a lion or a tyger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tommy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed I would, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Barlow.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet you do not call your∣self a wild animal.</P>
</SP>
<P>Tommy laughed heartily at this, and said, no. Therefore, said Mr. Barlow, if you want to tame animals, you must be good to them, and treat them kindly, and then they will no longer fear you, but come to you, and love you. In∣deed, said Harry, that is very true: for I knew a little boy that took a great fancy to a snake that lived in his father's garden, and when he had his milk for breakfast, he used to sit under a nut-tree and whistle, and the snake would come to him, and eat out of his bowl.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tommy.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did it not bite him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="206" REF="045437_0204_101FFC78CB173FA8"/>
<SPEAKER>Harry.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; he sometimes used to give it a pat with his spoon, if it ate too fast; but it never hurt him.</P>
</SP>
<P>Tommy was much pleased with this conver∣sation, and being both good natured, and desirous of making experiments, he determined to try his skill in taming animals. Accordingly he took a large slice of bread in his hand, and went out to seek some animal, that he might give it to. The first thing that he happened to meet, was a sucking pig that had rambled from its mother, and was basking in the sun: Tommy would not neglect the opportunity of shewing his talents; he therefore called Pig, pig, pig, come hither little pig! But the pig, who did not exactly com∣prehend his intentions, only grunted, and ran away. You little ungrateful thing, said Tom∣my, do you treat me in this manner, when I want to feed you? If you do not know your friends, I must teach you. Saying this, he sprung at the pig, and caught him by the hind leg, in∣tending to have given him the bread which he had in his hand; but the pig, who was not used to be treated in that manner, began struggling and squeaking to that degree, that the sow, who was within hearing, came running to the place, with all the rest of the litter, at her heels. As Tommy did not know whether she would be pleased with his civilities to her young one, or not, he thought it most prudent to let it go; and the pig, endeavouring to escape as speedily as possible, unfortunately ran between his legs, and threw him down. The place where the ac∣cident happened was extremely wet; therefore
<PB N="207" REF="045437_0205_101FFC9D740F2218"/>
Tommy, in falling, dirtied himself from head to foot, and the sow, who came up at that in∣stant, passed over him, as he attempted to rise, and rolled him back again into the mire. Tom∣my, who was not the coolest in his temper, was extremely provoked at this ungrateful return for his intended kindness; and losing all patience, he seized the sow by the hind leg, and began pummelling her with all his might, as she at∣tempted to escape. The sow, as may be imagined, did not relish such treatment, but endeavoured with all her force to escape; but Tommy keep∣ing his hold, and continuing his discipline, she struggled with such violence, as to drag him several yards, squeaking in the most lamentable manner, in which she was joined by the whole litter of pigs. During the heat of the contest, a large flock of geese happened to be crossing the road, into the midst of which the affrighted sow ran headlong, dragging the enraged Tommy at her heels. The goslings retreated with the greatest precipitation, joining their mournful cackling to the general noise; but a gander, of more than common size and courage, resenting the unprovoked attack which had been made upon his family, flew at Tommy's hinder parts, and gave him several severe strokes with his bill. Tommy, whose courage had hitherto been un∣conquerable, being thus unexpectedly attacked by a new enemy, was obliged to yield to for∣tune; and not knowing the precise extent of his danger, he not only suffered the sow to escape, but joined his vociferations to the general scream. This alarmed Mr. Barlow, who, coming up to
<PB N="208" REF="045437_0206_101FFCA1E13772D0"/>
the place, found his pupil in the most woful plight, daubed from head to foot, with his face and hands as black as those of any chimney-sweeper. He enquired what was the matter, and Tommy, as soon he had recovered breath enough to speak, answered in this manner; Sir, this is all owing to what you told me about taming ani∣mals. I wanted to make them tame and gentle and to love me, and you see the consequences. Indeed, said Mr. Barlow, I see you have been very ill-treated, but I hope you are not hurt; and if it is owing to any thing I have said, I shall feel the more concern. No, said Tommy, I cannot say that I am much hurt. Why then, said Mr. Barlow, you had better go and wash yourself; and when you are clean, we will talk over the affair. When Tommy had returned, Mr. Barlow asked him how the accident had happened, and when he had heard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he story, he said I am very sorry for your misfortune, but I do not perceive that I was the cause of it, for I do not remember that I ever advised you to catch pigs by the hinder legs.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tommy.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir; but you told me that feeding animals was the way to make them love me, and so I wanted to feed the pig.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Barlow.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it was not my fault that you attempted it in a wrong manner. The ani∣mal did not know your intentions, and there∣fore when you seized him in so violent a manner, he naturally attempted to escape, and his mother hearing his cries, very naturally came to his as∣sistance. All that happened, was owing to your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>experience; before you meddle with any ani∣mal,
<PB N="209" REF="045437_0207_101FFCA366B725E8"/>
you should make yourself perfectly acquaint∣ed with its nature and disposition. Had you observed this rule, you would never have at∣tempted to catch the pig by the hinder leg, in order to tame it; and it is very lucky that you did not make the experiment upon a larger animal.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE part which James I. king of England, took, in the dispute between the bishops and the Presbyterians, had so violently enraged the latter, that after his death, they took the ad∣vantage of some arbitrary measures in the go∣vernment of his son and successor, Charles I. to excite the whole nation to open revolt. The
<PB N="210" REF="045437_0208_101FFCA60FE13F20"/>
intent of the Presbyterians was, to annihilate E∣piscopacy, and to lessen the royal prerogative: but the Independents, a new sect which had sprung up from the former, aimed at the total abolition of royalty, and the establishment of a common∣wealth in its stead. Cromwell, who had made both parties equally subservient to his ambitious views, declared, at last, in favour of the indepen∣dents. After having filled the parliament and the army with persons devoted to his fortune, or the dupes of his hypocrisy, he procured a formal sentence of death to be passed against his sove∣reign. The Presbyterians, though they saw themselves plainly outwitted by his cunning, did not dare to rise up against the power which he had usurped. Those of Scotland had more courage; they called over the eldest son of Charles I. from France, whither he had fled for re∣fuge, and they received him as their king, though under the most severe restrictions. Cromwell, however, soon marched into Scotland, and de∣fea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed them in the famous battle of Dunbar, September 3, 1650.</P>
<P>Hostilities, which were suspended during the winter, began afresh the year following. Charles II. whom the Scots had proclaimed king, was, notwithstanding, so disgusted at the state of subjection and restraint to which they would have reduced him, that he took the resolution of quitting Scotland, whither Cromwell was come to pursue him, and of entering England with an army of fourteen thousand men, in hopes of seeing it augmented by the English Presbyterians, and the secret friends of the royal
<PB N="211" REF="045437_0209_101FFCA8997BC5F0"/>
cause. But Cromwell did not give him time to receive these additions of strength: he followed him by forced marches, overtook him with a superior army, and entirely routed the Scottish troops. After having fought bravely to the very last, Charles, with difficulty, escaped off the field of battle, accompanied by fifty men. The distresses to which he was reduced after his de∣feat, obliged him to conceal himself under the meanest disguises, in order to escape from the soldiers, whom Cromwell had sent out, every where, in search of him; the instances of fidelity that he received from the Earl of Derby, the companion of his flight, from Colonel Wynd∣ham<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the Drama he is called Lord Wyndham.</NOTE> and his servants, who kept him concealed, notwithstanding the severe penalties denounced by the parliament; the fanaticism of the parties which then distracted England, and the deplora∣ble state of the nation in general; during this sea∣son of tumult, present a multitude of interesting situations, and instructive scenes, to which the author has endeavoured to give connexion in the following drama, at the same time, that he has studied to preserve historical truth in the leading actions of the piece.</P>

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="scene">
<HEAD>SCENE I. A Forest, before Day-light.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Charles dressed as a peasant, is hid among the boughs of an oak. Lord Derby, disguised in the same manner, comes out from the middle of a thicket, and advances toward the king.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Derby.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is too soon to quit your re∣treat, as yet. The parliament soldiers continue to scour all quarters of the forest. We are lia∣ble, at every step, to fall into their hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Derby, I find myself endowed with sufficient courage to struggle with the chagrin that preys upon my mind, but my body is total∣ly broken down with pain and fatigue. I have already passed twenty hours in this deplorable situation. I cannot possibly support it any long∣er.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Derby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sire, I conjure you, put up with these inconveniences, which cannot be of long durati∣on, rather than fall into the hands of your ene∣mies. They would be implacable. Our mis∣fortune, by intoxicating them with success, has only whetted their barbarity. The weight of it would fall on you. But I hope we shall soon find a retreat more commodious, and less dan∣gerous than this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>It cannot be long before the sun will appear. If you thought darkness so little
<PB N="213" REF="045437_0211_101FFCAD94981458"/>
favourable to our safety, surely the light of the day will be much more against us. How shall I be able to hold out till night, in my present situ∣ation? The mind arms herself in vain, with all her force, if the body has lost what should sustain her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Derby.</SPEAKER>
<P>I feel, with double weight, the pains that you suffer, and would lay down my life to exempt you from them; but fate controuls our wishes. Its laws are immutable, and true cou∣rage is, to obey them. I would sacrifice myself for your preservation: nevertheless, shall I con∣fess to your majesty? It would give me less re∣gret to lose you here before my eyes, than to see you fall into the hands of rebels, and adorn their insolent triumph. I hear soldiers coming. Hide yourself from their sight. When they are past, I will return and keep you company again. <STAGE>(He goes into the thicket.</STAGE></P>

<P>From the top of this tree you may see the day ready to break between yon hills. Do not you hear the cocks crow, to summon the husbandman to his early toil? We shall find all the houses just opening. Come, rife; let us go.</P>

<P>What I have once resolved, I am sure to perform.</P>

<P>I might say as much, and then we must separate. I change my resolves no more than you: my beard shews it. Until Charles Stuart shall fall into my hands, I have sworn that the razor shall never touch it. You see how long it is grown already.</P>

<P>It is easier to bear the inconvenience of a beard, than of weariness and fatigue.</P>

<P>Are you not ashamed to be weary in a pursuit that may make your fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Talgol.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would not desire a fortune at this price.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pembel.</SPEAKER>
<P>The thing is, thou art not suffici∣ently enlightened. But I can prove to thee, that it were impious for saints to faint in the execu∣tion of heaven's commands, for the sake of a little weariness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Talgol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heaven has not commanded me. I have not sworn by my beard to take Charles Stuart. And if I may ask, what right have you over him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="215" REF="045437_0213_101FFCB2FB45C078"/>
<SPEAKER>Pembel.</SPEAKER>
<P>A right, founded on the good old cause: Shall the ungodly have dominion over saints? We were strayed from the paths of righteousness, and heaven, in its wrath, sent us a tyrant, armed with a rod of iron. Now that we are sanctified, power is given us to break the rod with which we have been so long chastised.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Talgol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Still I say; it is wicked to reject the kings, who were allotted to us from above.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pembel.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Lord will have no king, but himself, to govern his people. No sight is more pleasing to him, than that of the army at prayers. That is what has carried the good old cause so far.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Talgol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Much too far. Had we stopped at the abolishing of popery and episcopacy, it had been well. I took up arms myself to attain these ends; and with this view also we called you to our assistance; but you have managed so as to get the power all into your own hands, and now you exercise it according to your errors. You have put your king to death. That will cost you dear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pembel.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you were only to hear Cromwell, he would teach you what to think on the sub∣ject. These are his words: "When I would have spoken for the re-establishment of the king, I felt my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth. A plain indication that heaven had hardened his heart, and rejected him." But answer me your∣self; Was this king worthy to govern us? Did he not attack us first?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="216" REF="045437_0214_101FFCB66BE9F568"/>
<SPEAKER>Talgol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, certainly, he would have en∣thralled our consciences to his own imaginati∣ons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pembel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who was the first that rose up to oppose his designs? Was it not you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Talgol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our arms were not aimed at him, but at his wicked counsellors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pembel.</SPEAKER>
<P>They were the same as himself, and he as they. To let them do the evil, was it not the same if he did it himself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Talgol.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, he was blameable for it.</P>

<P>Did he grant it to you?</P>

<P>No.</P>

<P>Would you ever have obtained it, if the parliament had not supported you?</P>

<P>Never, I allow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pembel.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is not the parliament the voice of the nation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Talgol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, inasmuch as it represents the nation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pembel.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is the parliament, therefore, that is the nation, that we must obey, especially when we are so well paid for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Talgol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your arguments begin to appear something weightier than before.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pembel.</SPEAKER>
<P>See how thou wert blinded. The Lord was desirous to punish a tyrant, and chose you first to begin his vengeance. Other instru∣ments were wanting for the consummation there∣of, and we came to put the last hand to this great work. Do we not act then in concert with you? and is not the good old cause our's as well
<PB N="217" REF="045437_0215_101FFCB7F26B8438"/>
as your's? Ought we then to bear with one of the ungodly, that would have bruised us to pieces; us who are the children of the Lord?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Talgol.</SPEAKER>
<P>I begin to see clearly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pembel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have patience, the light will come down upon thee still more. When delivered from our first tyrant, why did we go, with swords in our hands, to Worcester? Was it not to hin∣der his son from overturning the foundation that we had laid for the security of our consci∣ences and our liberties? Has not heaven appro∣ved our actions, by the glorious victory that we have gained? Stuart came against us with a nu∣merous army. Did we not make him flee, like the chaff before the wind? When the Lord speaks, are we to resist his voice?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Talgol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thou art right. He hath clearly manifested his will.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pembel.</SPEAKER>
<P>He requires that our consciences be pure: Stuart would defile them with his errors; and shall we cease to pursue him with vengeance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Talgol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heaven forbid. The son is not yet sufficiently washed from the impieties of his fa∣ther, to rule over us, the elect. We should seize him where-ever we can find him, lest, otherwise, we ourselves disobey the Lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pembel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps we should have had, before this time, the good fortune to take him, if your heart, by its doubts and waverings, had not offended heaven. Others, less scrupulous, may have seized this happiness before us. Yes, we shall certainly find Stuart in the custody of Cromwell.</P>

<P>Perfidious Cromwell, this is your manner of acting!

<P>In the first place, who are you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am one who escaped after the bat∣tle of Worcester. I have passed the night on this tree, to escape from the parliament soldiers, because I am of the opposite party. I perceive, by your fervent prayer just now, that you are of the same party, and therefore it is that I have ta∣ken the liberty to address you.</P>

<P>I have heard people speak of him.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pope.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I hope. It is true, what I call <HI>well,</HI> would make him criminal in the eyes of many. But still I must do him justice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I recollect, this nobleman lived re∣tired from all party.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pope.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, but do you know for what rea∣son? He served, with his family, in the army of the deceased king. At the battle of Naseby, he lost his eldest son, the hopes of his family. Af∣ter the overthrow of the royal army, and the taking of the king, he came down here to the country, to mourn in silence, for the cruel fate of his master. He swore never to return to Lon∣don, before the people should submit to the son of their lawful sovereign. And he adheres strict∣ly to his word; since that unfortunate battle, he has never quitted his house.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pope.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am going thither immediately. I have walked all night with dispatches from him, on business of importance. I would chearfully take you with me, if I were sure that you were of the right side; for, otherwise, it would be of no use for you to appear before him. You are astonished, perhaps, that I dare speak my mind to you with so much freedom; but, in spite of all the tyranny of the parliament, we are not afraid to give our thoughts vent. It is true, we are too weak to stem the torrent of rebellion. Pow∣er may oblige us to be quiet, but not to betray, or even to disguise our sentiments.</P>

<P>I am delighted to see you in this way of thinking. For these four and twenty hours past, I have concealed myself in this tree, in order to escape the pursuit of Cromwell's sol∣diers.

<SPEAKER>Wyndham.</SPEAKER>
<P>Death would, perhaps, be the most desirable thing for us all. You see what is our situation. All the valuable remains that time had spared, of an ancient nobility, have perished under tortures, or languish in proscrip∣tion and exile. Adventurers, more despicable for their vices than their obscurity, occupy the seats of our peers in parliament. Instead of our
<PB N="228" REF="045437_0226_101FFCD57A7272B8"/>
brave generals, we see ignorant tradesmen fill the first posts of the army. Fanaticism, of the most abominable nature, reigns in the place of religi∣on. Frantic preachers, of a thousand sects, drown the voice of the regular ministers of the gospel. Hypocrisy, under the appearance of pi∣ety, gives a loose to the most scandalous exces∣ses; she justifies her crimes by the most atroci∣ous blasphemies, which she ascribes to the Su∣preme Being. The true friends of this country are persecuted; and infamy is seated on the throne of justice. Can life be of any value, while it is confined to view such horrid sights as these?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Henry.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, father, it would be intolerable, were these evils to continue for ever. But why should we suffer our courage to be cast down? Who knows?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Windham.</SPEAKER>
<P>On what foundation can we build a hope? The royal army is dispersed. If the prince were even living, where would he find forces to retrieve his fortune? His friends, dis∣heartened by a long series of overthrows, far from daring to resist the torrent of rebellion, are, perhaps, destined, by their ruin, to augment the general devastation. Our last resource is only the swelling of this tyranny to its height. That period approaches; and the people of this na∣tion, finding themselves oppressed by a heavier yoke than they ever yet experienced, will arm themselves with all their native resolution, to shake it off. But how many troubles and disor∣ders will bring about that happy revolution! I shall not live long enough to be a witness to it:
<PB N="229" REF="045437_0227_101FFCD7053F5688"/>
but, my son, if thou shalt survive me, remain for ever steady in the principles which I have taught thee. Never espouse the cause of a des∣potic parliament: it will become the most dread∣ful scourge that ever oppressed this nation. Re∣main rather inactive (it will be the most prudent conduct) until the people, recovered from their fatal errors, be constrained to wish for the go∣vernment, which they have just now abolished.</P>

We all burn with zealous emulation to serve you. Your misfortunes, and those of your father, embitter∣ed my old age.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wyndham.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sire, we inherit these principles from our ancestors. A few days before his death, my father sent for me, and in a voice, which, even from its weakness, was heard the more attentively, he spoke to us thus: "My children, England has seen, during the last three reigns, a succession of peaceful and happy years; but I see now rising, on every side, clouds that forebode the most violent storms. Prepare to encounter them. They will shake the whole realm to its centre. But stand ye firm, in the midst of the tempest. Continue to love your country; be faithful to your sovereign, and ne∣ver forsake the crown, though you see it hang on a bush." These words made so powerful an impression upon our minds, that all the tumul∣tuous revolutions, which have since taken place in the commonwealth, have not been able to ef∣face them.</P>

<P>At present, my friends, it is time to consult the security of the king. Prudence for∣bids us to prolong our stay here. The whole country is full of parliament soldiers. I know not whether there be so much as a single corner in the three kingdoms, that can afford us a se∣cure retreat, in the present general ferment of people's minds. The business is, therefore, to consult means for quitting England, by the least dangerous way.</P>
</SP>

<P>My design is to embark for France, in the first vessel that I can find. Lord Wynd∣ham, you know the country, and can easily fa∣vour this design.</P>

<P>Chance seems to have disposed every thing for its succeeding.

<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I resign myself to your zeal; but I shudder to think of the insults and persecutions that you will, perhaps, be obliged to undergo. When I landed, last year, in Scotland, the first object that struck my view, was the bleeding head of gallant Montrose, whose only crime was, his inviolable fidelity. This appalling sight, pursues me even in my dreams: it afflicts me more than my own dangers. How much pre∣cious blood may the re-establishment of my for∣tune still cost me! Even yourselves, whose loy∣alty I can never sufficiently reward, who knows whether even you may not fall melancholy vic∣tims to the undertaking? There wanted but this cutting thought, to make my calamities com∣plete.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Derby.</SPEAKER>
<P>Such sentiments as these, on your majesty's part, would be sufficient to repay us for the sacrifice of our lives. The duty of the nobility, is, to support the rights of your crown, and their chiefest honour, to defy all the dangers to which this great undertaking may expose them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="243" REF="045437_0241_101FFCFB52008158"/>
<SPEAKER>Wyndham.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sire, there is nothing but I dare expect from our endeavours, if your for∣titude only seconds them. The present violent crisis of affairs cannot last long. The soundest part of the nation sigh for that tranquility which they enjoyed under your father and grandfather. The people, loaded with taxes, imposed on them for the maintenance of a murderous soldiery, will soon rise against exactions that become every day more tyrannical. Discord is ready to break out between the parliament and the army. Cromwell, who underhand foments it, will, some time or other, throw off the mask all at once, and by discovering his ambitious schemes, will exasperate even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is own party. Become the object of general execration, he will endeavour to suppress it, by violence and terror; but a people still shaken from the impulse of a long and vehement concussion, do not submit in silence to the yoke. The tyrant's life will be passed in continual alarms. Impaired by the excesses of his youth, tormented by his crimes, and har∣rassed by remorse, he will soon finish his days, without establishing his usurped power; and for the completion of his views, will leave none be∣hind him, but two sons, who must soon bend under the weight of their adventitious fortune, because not endowed with their father's daring genius. Then it will be that the nobility, free at length to exert their voice, and to support it with their arms, will make the nation acknow∣ledge you as their sovereign, a sovereign worthy of ruling them, after having matured his virtues in the school of adversity.</P>

<P>Sage Wyndham, I accept your pro∣phecy with joy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wyndham.</SPEAKER>
<P>As a faithful subject to your ma∣jesty, I thought it my duty to lay before you the prospect of these hopes, in order both to testify our zeal, and to support your courage. But I should, also, on the other hand, think myself a betrayer of the constitution, if I did not lay be∣fore your majesty, what the people have a right to expect from you. While I detest the attroci∣ous crime committed on the person of your fa∣ther, I must presume, with the laudable freedom of an Englishman, to say, that he frequently vi∣olated our privileges, in order to give the greater stretch to his prerogative, and that a prince ought to be the first to respect the laws of his country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>The misfortunes, and the faults of his reign, will afford me a striking lesson all my life time. But, Wyndham, you know whether they should be attributed to him: his temper breathed indulgence and humanity: his last sen∣timents testify his courage and greatness of soul. Heaven grant that I may resemble him in these virtues. I know no reproach with which his memory can be lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ded, save that of having pla∣ced his confidence in persons unworthy of it, and who abused it, both to his people's prejudice, and his own. The choice of true friends is difficult, even in private life. Is it easier for a prince to distinguish wise ministers, in the midst of so many courtiers, who are interested to impose on him by assumed good qualities? The more he loves his people, the less can he suspect those who are round him, of being strangers to the same senti∣ments.
<PB N="245" REF="045437_0243_101FFD005B9439F8"/>
The misfortune of my father, and which many kings have suffered in common with him, was, to have lived long in prosperity. I shall have the advantage of him, in the salutary experience of misfortune. Perhaps, at no other price, will heaven give me the instruction that can enable me to govern wisely. I shall not think that I have paid for it too dear, if I can render it conducive to the happiness of the nati∣on; and if I can make England forget, under a reign of justice and of peace, the troubles which have so long distracted her. I will take, for my pattern, that Henry, whose name will be for ever dear to the French, and whom we ourselves are forced to revere. I go into his country, to col∣lect the remembrance of all his virtues. Firm, like him, in adversity, I will imitate his clemen∣cy, when I mount the throne. These are my engagements with my people; and do you, whom I look upon, at this moment, as representing my people, receive the oath, which I make to respect and defend its rights, until my dying day.</P>

<P>I think heaven must declare on our side. We merely with right to take place, and religion to be maintained; whereas these new sects outrage the Almighty, by their pride.

Were not their ministers heard saying aloud, to the Supreme Being, that if he did not save them from their enemies, they would no longer own him for their Lord? Infatuated men! as if it had been in their power to make to themselves another!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pope.</SPEAKER>
<P>By that pride they were undone. I am not sorry for it. They did not serve the prince's cause sincerely: He had thrown him∣self into their arms, and they treated him as a prisoner. They removed him from the army, because they saw that he gained the affections of the soldiery, by his valour. They also sent home five thousand brave fellows, whom they thought too strongly attached to his interest. They wished to have the glory of subduing Cromwell, all to themselves. They had reduced him to extremity. It was all over with him, if they had continued upon the heights, as their general would have had them: but their head-strong ministers said, that they had wrestled with the Lord, in their prayers, that they had forced him

<SPEAKER>Wyndham.</SPEAKER>
<P>This wish, worthy of the great∣ness of your soul, is beyond our feeble power. It is sufficient for us, if we can send Charles over in safety to France, until the rage of a frantic people be appeased. This people must first feel the oppressive yoke that they have imposed upon themselves. The performance of no steady purpose can be expected from their principles, until they have undergone this proof.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lady Wyndham.</SPEAKER>
<P>If it be so, our hopes are very far removed. In the present universal anarchy, pride makes the evils of it to be sup∣ported, because every one hopes to partake in the government.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wyndham.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; but we soon see pride basely yield to interest. The English complain∣ed under their last king, of the oppression of ship-money and the star-chamber. Taxes are in∣finitely heavier at present, under the arbitrary administration of parliament: immense sums have been consumed for the levy of troops whose pay is extravagant. It will be necessary to keep these armies up for a long time, in order to be∣come formidable to honest citizens, as well as to foreign enemies. It is the nation that sup∣ports these additional expenses, at the same time that its manufactures languish, and its commerce is interrupted. Discontents will break out every where, at once. Those whom fortune has left in their original obscurity, inflamed with envy, on seeing people of their own class raised above them, will rather wish the sovereign power re∣placed in the hands of those whose rank and birth more naturally qualify them for it. We
<PB N="255" REF="045437_0253_101FFF9F9F89AF48"/>
shall soon see that Cromwell and the parliament have overturned royal authority, in order first to divide it between them, and afterwards to quarrel for it. Open violence and secret perse∣cution will be exerted to repress the murmurs of discontent: then the people at large will be sensible that tyranny never rose to more shock∣ing excesses of oppression and audacity, than when they were amused with the vain hope of liberty.</P>

<P>I am charmed with Henry's be∣haviour to the king. His respect is fervent, without having any thing of servility. His words are tempered with affection, deference, and ge∣nerosity.

<P>No, Madam, be under no uneasiness, you will not see me blush: this is not the first time that Chance has con∣demned me to strange metamorphoses. Forced as I was a few days ago to ply the axe as a wood∣cutter in the forest, why should I be astonished at this new disguise? It is but another instance of the inconstancy of Fortune. The more she loads me with insults, the more pride I take in despising them. I wish even to rise above her, above myself, from the low estate to which she reduces me. A king, in this dress, receives an important lesson from Providence to transmit to other sovereigns.</P>

<P>Lord Derby, in these garments you see nothing but what is abject; I can look upon it as the apparel of triumph. The diadem upon my forehead could not, perhaps, impress my enemies with respect, whereas, in the livery of
<PB N="271" REF="045437_0269_102000846F414A40"/>

<P>This is homage that raises me far higher than the thrones of the earth: but rise, my friends; your place is not at my feet, but by my side. My lord, I have seen virtues in your house which do not always accompany a crown, and which eclipse its splen∣dor. If my love for my people and the laws of honour did not make it my duty to support my crown, this peaceful retreat, and the enjoyment of your friendship, would be the utmost bound of my ambition.</P>
</SP>

<P>For pity's sake, Sire, do not express such sentiments; they will make our sorrows too bitter.</P>

<P>Alas! such is our situation: though the sight of your majesty fills me with the live∣liest joy, yet I am reduced to the necessity of wishing you soon to be at a distance from my view.</P>
</SP>

<P>My presence, my lord, has occasion∣ed disorder and confusion in your house; but I swear that I will never forget the danger to which I expose you nor the generous firmness with which you brave it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wyndham.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Sir! animated as we are with a deep concern for the interests of our country, whatever personally regards us alone is but a very feeble consideration. It is neither my own safety

nor that of my family that disturbs me; yours occupies my whole thoughts. Fortune has put it out of our power to be useful to our country: but your majesty may still make her happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>While I labour to obtain that great object, I shall ever recollect that you have fur∣nished me with the means. If I arrive at the accomplishment of it, you shall not ask the com∣monwealth for your reward; I will charge my∣self with acquitting the national gratitude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wyndham.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me see my country happy, and I shall be sufficiently rewarded: but, alas! my strength, exhausted by long services, hardly al∣lows me that hope: I leave it, however, as a be∣quest to my son, together with the inheritance of my principles. Permit me, Sire, to recommend this my only remaining son, to your notice. I ask nothing for him, but that your majesty would employ him usefully in the service of his coun∣try. I dare answer for him, that he will neither disgrace your choice, nor impair the honour of his ancestors.</P>

If my death can save to her the blood of one more valuable, I devote myself, without reluctance, nay, with joy: mean time, let me pay to your lordship, as well as to this lady, the tribute of my gratitude, for your sentiments in my behalf, and particularly for the high opi∣nion that you have expressed for my courage. <STAGE>(Wyndham and Lady Mary endeavour to stifle their grief. Henry looks round for his mother, and sees her in a swoon. He takes her hand, and kisses it.)</STAGE> To what a situation does the excessive tenderness of her feelings reduce her!

<P>He was mine also. Escaped alone from the ruins of a numerous family, I flattered myself that he would raise it to its former lustre. Indeed, from his earliest youth, he afforded the
<PB N="284" REF="045437_0282_102000A52DED2FD8"/>
most auspicious hopes; and, in one moment, he has now gone far beyond them. With so many claims to my affection, can you think that he is indifferent to me, or that his loss would create in me less poignant grief than in you? Pity my sor∣rows, therefore, in your turn. You think me insensible, because I would comfort you. Ah! why cannot I lay bare my heart before you? You would see it harrowed up with tortures in∣expressible. What shall I say to you? Such a soul as your's is not to be deluded by unreal con∣solations; but some sources of comfort are yet open. See your son, already full of virtues, ac∣quire immortal glory in the flower of his age, by saving his prince and his country. Let your affection dwell a moment upon these noble thoughts. If we are to lose our son, there is this well-founded hope left, which Cromwell's fero∣cious cruelty will not render vain, that we shall all be included in the same proscription with him.</P>

<P>Lord Wyndham, what has been the matter? I hear tumultuous voices repeat on eve∣ry side, with reiterated clamour, "The king is taken." The soldiers are dragging off two men.

<P>And you believe that I will suffer him to die, in my stead? No, no; I should think myself unworthy of so noble fidelity, were I to permit this sacrifice. Dry up your tears, ma∣dam, I will soon restore to you a son so worthy of your sorrows.</P>

<SPEAKER>Wyndham.</SPEAKER>
<P>The attempt would be vain. Will blood-thirsty Cromwell be terrified at the num∣ber of his victims? It is past with my son, and you would perish, without saving him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then, at least, I will die with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wyndham.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sire; you shall not die. Your life is no longer at your own disposal; it be∣longs to me, who have purchased it at the price of my blood. I presume to assert my claims upon it, conjointly with those of the nation.</P>

<P>The accomplishment of our great design. Its execution is now become favourable. The false report, which has already filled the vil∣lage, and will soon be spread through the whole country, ensures you a free retreat. Make haste to depart. The delay of an instant may be fatal to you. The Tyger, disappointed in his first grey, will come hither, by the traces of my

<P>No, I do not accept this sanguinary offering. What a lot pursues me! Heaven gives kings, to make nations happy, whereas I am sent to bring destruction on my people. My life is a ground of discord to my subjects. I see some prostitute their conscience and their honour to the purpose of procuring my death, others, in my defence, sacrifice their too generous blood.

<SPEAKER>Wyndham.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is your happiness or mine? it is the happiness of a whole people, that should occupy your thoughts. Led astray by the vio∣lence of their passions, but ever ready, from an innate love of rectitude, to return to the ways of justice and honour, they must be indebted to you alone for such a reformation: they will soon come and supplicate your return. Whenever that happens, grant their desire; return, not as a conqueror, but as a father: my blood, then, will not cry out to you for vengeance, but for mercy, liberty, and love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>This ungrateful people, who pro∣scribe me! are they all worth, in my estimation, a single citizen like you? Under a doubtful hope of returning, should I suffer such noble victims to perish? No, Wyndham, I have said it; I will not accept an offering of devoted blood, while I can ransom it with my own. By what right would you force me to receive it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wyndham.</SPEAKER>
<P>By what right, Sire? You make me forget the duty of a subject, and assume the authority over you which my age gives me, and if I must add, my services. When I gave you
<PB N="289" REF="045437_0287_102000B3DB884378"/>
an asylum here, at the risk of my fortune and life, the honour of saving you was a sufficient recompense; but when I sacrifice my son for your preservation, with what price can you re∣pay me? And would you snatch from me even the fruits of this sacrifice, and oblige me to grieve that I ever consented to it? No, Sire, you are a king; I was a father. For your sake, I am no longer one: restore to me, therefore, in your per∣son, the son whom I had brought up to fulfil the hopes of his country. You ask me, by what right? You have given me a right, which I will exact in all its rigour. Depart.</P>

Now clasping me in your arms, now pushing me from you, with horror, spent with weeping, convulsed with sobs, passing by turns, from the frenzy of grief, to a calm still more dreadful, and from a mournful silence, to shrieks of anguish, how often, in this long night, has my heart been torn with the sight of your sufferings! Sleep, at length, steals upon her eye∣lids, and gives me a moment of freedom to in∣dulge my griefs alone.

<SPEAKER>Wyndham.</SPEAKER>
<P>To describe the horror with which that tyranny inspires me, it is sufficient that I cannot express how much I abhor you. Yes, monster, do you think that I have not marked your ambition, stealing, with perfidious silence, to a throne? I am not the slave of kings: I ever detested their attempts upon our liberty. What curses then do I not owe your parliament and you, the two most cruel oppressors of the people? Under what sceptred tyrant have they shed more tears or more blood? Ferocious man∣ners, frantic errors, vindictive proscriptions, licentiousness, massacres and depredations, these blessings your republican knaves have given to an infatuated populace, by way of liberty, while they crush them under a load of taxes, and punish their least murmur as rebellion. This monstrous chaos is the work of your gloomy policy: I have seen you lurk among the independents; unable to lead the sect by the force of your eloquence, you have agitated them by the ravings of a distempered imagination: you wrapped yourself in the veil of religion, to amuse the ambition of your rivals: you urged on all parties to the usur∣pation of arbitrary power, that you might reach it, by treading in their steps, and then dispossess
<PB N="298" REF="045437_0296_102000CAB0208A98"/>
them of it, with the audacious violence natural to your disposition. Left supreme, and without a rival, confounding beneath your feet both arms and laws, you now plague the nation with storms of anarchy, that it may fall exhausted before your despotic power. Now tell me of greatness and liberty.</P>

<P>We are all impatient to meet it and to defy your vengeance. I have satisfied mine upon you, by forcing you to esteem me as much as I despise you. See, Cromwell, the difference between guilt and honour. By dint of violence and intrigues, you may find a par∣liament base enough to bestow the sovereignty on you: but, cloathed with a power to which nothing invites you, except the charms of the guilt that it must cost you, it will soon become burthensome, when you find no new crimes to commit. There will remain to you but the terrors of a conscience alarmed by premature old age. Your children will curse you, and the guilty throne which you leave them to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; whereas I shall die blest by my family which I sacrifice to the cause of virtue.</P>

while they descend together to the remotest posterity. Nay, I expect from my death a still more glorious effect. Numerous alliances unite me to the first peers of this realm. They will not look on unconcerned, while the same blood which fills their veins, is shed under the axe of the executioner. There never can arise, in the three kingdoms, a monster equal to thee; but I honour my country too much, to suppose that it has not citizens left, who surpass me in virtue. When they see a whole family perish with heroism, in performance of their duty, a gene∣rous emulation will seize their noble souls. The striking off of my head will be a signal to them to rally, from all quarters. I already see them rushing on you: haste then to complete a mur∣der which may deliver me from the sight of your crimes, and will arm so many avengers of them. Come yourself and prepare my scaffold.

<HEAD>ADVENTURES OF CHARLES II. IN HIS FLIGHT.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER the battle of Worcester, the king left the field, accompanied by fifty horse∣men. He kept his escort together, during a flight of twenty-six miles, in order to pro∣tect himself, either from the insults of the coun∣try people, or against the detachments that Crom∣well had sent out in pursuit of him. He then thought proper to separate from them, and only retained about his person, the Earl of Derby, and Lord Wilmot, with whom he arrived at the old monastery of Witlade, the occupier of the lands on which the monastery stood, having for∣merly given an asylum to the earl, after the de∣feat of his little army. This farmer, whose name deserves to be handed down to posterity, was called Penderel: he had four brothers, men of loyalty, like himself, who had another small farm at Boscobel, in the neighbourhood. He sent for them, and into their hands, the king re∣signed his destiny. They cut off his hair, black∣ened
<PB N="309" REF="045437_0307_102000D3BA9BFB88"/>
his face, and conducted him, in an old tat∣tered disguise, to cut wood in the forest. They made him lie in a little chapel, upon a straw bed, with a wretched bolster. A woman, whom they were obliged to admit into the secret, brought him milk, butter and eggs. The king was sur∣prized at seeing her, and not knowing whether the Penderels had trusted her without reserve, he asked her, in order to assure himself, how she could think of being faithful to one of the king's party. The woman answered, without explain∣ing herself further, that she would be faithful to the king as long as she lived. She uttered these words with such an appearance of feeling, that Charles' apprehensions were perfectly quieted, and he made a very hearty meal of the victuals which she had brought him, necessity rendering it, perhaps, the most delicious that ever he made in his life. Charles had scarcely left Witlade, before some of Cromwell's soldiers alighted at the monastery, and searched it all through. Luck∣ily a very abundant shower of rain hindered them from leaving it, to scour the neighbourhood; and nothing disturbed the little repose, which ex∣cessive weariness, and violent anxiety, suffered the king to enjoy in his dismal lodging.</P>
<P>Informed of this alarm, the next morning, as soon as he awoke, he resolved immediately to go into Wales. He promised himself more security there, until he should be able to make for Lon∣don, whither he had sent Lord Wilmot, to wait his coming. He sat out, therefore, at night, with one of the Penderels for his guide. As they passed near a mill, the miller hearing them
<PB N="310" REF="045437_0308_102000D7293F72C0"/>
open a gate at the end of the bridge that crossed his mill-race, sallied out hastily from his mill, and demanded, with a threatening tone, where they were going, at such an unseasonable hour. They continued endeavouring to open the gate, without answering him. The miller ran to∣wards them, crying out to them to stop, at which summons Penderel abandoned the bridge, and rushed into the stream: the king followed him, without hesitation, the noise that he made in the water directing his steps, as the darkness prevented him from seeing his guide. Luckily the same darkness, together with the miller's cor∣pulence, hindered him from overtaking them.</P>
<P>They arrived, quite wet, at the house of a country-man, named Wolf, an acquaintance of Penderels. Wolf, after having concealed the king as well as he could, went himself to the edge of the river, to prepare a passage for him; but he found the whole bank so covered with sol∣diers, that he thought it his duty to dissuade his guest from so dangerous an enterprize. Charles was obliged to return to Boscobel, and from thence to the chapel, where he kept himself con∣cealed, while the Penderels examined the coun∣try, to discover whether there were any of the parliament's troops in the neighbourhood. One of them, as he went his rounds, met a person, at the sight of whom the king was agreeably sur∣prized. His name was Careless, one of those brave warriors, who, in order to let the king gain a larger distance from Worcester, had stemmed every effort of the enemy for a considerable time, at the city gates. Careless was a native of this
<PB N="311" REF="045437_0309_102000D8B7729480"/>
part of the country, and knew the Penderels, who brought him home to their house. The king having hurt his foot, came hither at night to have it dressed. Careless knew him, and would not quit him afterwards. He re-conduct∣ed him to the forest before break of day, and made him climb into a large tree, where they both remained concealed among the thick bran∣ches, for near four and twenty hours. They saw several soldiers walk by at the foot of the tree, many of whom expressed the most ardent desire of seizing the king. This tree received the name of the royal oak, and has ever since been honoured with the highest veneration by the people of the country.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, a secret report had been spread, that Charles was somewhere thereabout. One of the Penderels going into a neighbouring vil∣lage, found there a number of soldiers very busi∣ly engaged in collecting every account possible concerning the king. The officer, who com∣manded them, put many questions to Penderel himself, and promised him a great reward if he would give information where Charles lay con∣cealed. Penderel did not swerve from his loyal∣ty; but his account of this circumstance, indu∣ced the king to take the resolution of seeking a∣nother retreat.</P>
<P>The guide, whom he had sent with Lord Wilmot, to conduct him to London, returning, informed the king, that his lordship, despairing to reach town, through the crouds of soldiers, who filled all the roads, had stopped short at the house of a gentleman of the royal party, named
<PB N="312" REF="045437_0310_102000DB357787D0"/>
Witgrave, where he was in safety. Charles con∣ceived the design of going to him, and had the good fortune to succeed, in spite of every dan∣ger that he was to encounter.</P>
<P>Charles, while he indulged the satisfaction that he felt on seeing Lord Wilmot, had not time to deliberate with him on the course or measures which would be most proper for them to take, when a party of soldiers appeared before Mr. Witgrave's house, with an intention of search∣ing it. Resistance would have been unseasona∣ble. Witgrave concealed his guests, and, at the same time, opened his door with so much alacri∣ty and unconcern, that his visitors were induced to make but a very slight search. It was soon af∣terwards understood, that a fresh inspection had been made of Witlade monastery; and that the officer of the party by whom it was searched, had several times held his pistol to Farmer Pen∣derel's breast, to oblige him to confess where the king was concealed.</P>
<P>The danger increasing every day, Charles dropped all thoughts of staying any longer in England, and resolved to get as near the sea as he could, in order to embark, with more speed and convenience, the first opportunity. Colonel Lane, a zealous loyalist, who lived at Bentley, a place but a few miles distant, promised to co∣operate in effecting this purpose. The king had made his feet so sore by walking in heavy boots, or great shoes, which had not been made for him, that he was obliged to ride. He reached Bently, in company with Lord Wilmot, and the four Penderels, who had always been so faithful
<PB N="313" REF="045437_0311_102000DEA2A90818"/>
to him. Colonel Lane proposed to convey the king to Bristol, where they might hope to find some vessel that would take him on board. This officer had a relation, called Mrs. Norton, who lived about three miles from Bristol, and was then very far advanced in her pregnancy. He obtained a passport (without which, it was im∣possible to travel in those troublesome times) for his sister and a servant, under pretence of visiting his relation in the neighbourhood of Bristol. The king, therefore, sat off on horseback, and rode behind Miss Lane's chaise, passing for her servant. Lord Wilmot leading a brace of spa∣niels, coupled together, and carrying a hawk upon his wrist, passed for a sporting country gen∣tleman of their acquaintance, who had met them on the road.</P>
<P>During this journey, which lasted but three days, the king met with several adventures, most of them sufficient to inspire him with well-grounded terrors. He had only travelled six miles, when his horse having dropped a shoe, he went himself to the nearest blacksmith, to have him shod, as he chose to go through with the character that he had assumed. While he stood by at the operation, the smith asked him what news were going, and if the king was ta∣ken. Charles answered, without changing countenance, that he had not heard any thing of it, and that, in all likelihood, his majesty was gone back to Scotland. I do not think so, re∣plied the smith; I should rather suppose him to be concealed in England. Wherever he is, I should wish to know his place of concealment.
<PB N="314" REF="045437_0312_102000E02BEFB228"/>
The parliament has published a proclamation, offering a reward of 1000<HI>l.</HI> sterling, to whoever will discover him.</P>
<P>This disagreeable conversation being over, the party sat forward again, and continued their route to near Evesham, where, as they were about to pass a ford, they perceived, all at once, a number of horses standing, saddled, at the other side of it. Charles was for going right on, but his compa∣ny, less resolute, prevailed upon him, at length, to turn off▪ They found themselves still in the view of the soldiers, whom they had thought to avoid: but the prince shewed so good a counte∣nance, and the whole cavalcade appeared so much in nature, as a country family paying a visit in the neighbourhood, that the soldiers, who were, at that moment, busied in seeking him, and him only, conceived not the smallest suspicion of him.</P>
<P>When they came to Mrs. Norton's, Miss Lane told her, that she had brought with her a young man, whom she wished her to take into her service. He was the son, she said, of a poor countryman, in her neighbourhood, and had caught an ague on▪ the road, for which reason, she requested that he might have a room to him∣self. Charles retired to it, and did not stir out; but a servant of the house, whose name was Pope, knew him, and, throwing himself at his feet, Is it you, Sire? said he; I have seen your majesty when very young, and therefore was not long recollecting you: if I can serve your ma∣jesty, put my zeal to the test, and depend upon my fidelity. Charles was surprized and embar∣rassed
<PB N="315" REF="045437_0313_102000E2A6ECFB28"/>
at this new adventure. He saw an equal risk in discovering himself to a stranger, and in shewing that he distrusted a man, who had it in his power to verify his suspicions. In this di∣lemma, the apparent sincerity of the man, de∣termined the king to conceal nothing. The e∣vent proved that he was right. Pope rendered the king great services, and contributed not a lit∣tle to his safety, by pointing out to him, as a safe retreat, the house of Colonel Wyndham, where, in effect, he spent nineteen days, waiting until his friends should find an opportunity for him to embark on board some ship.</P>
<P>This was not an easy matter, on account of the precautions taken against receiving strangers. It was even dangerous to propose it, the captains of ships suspecting every body, whom they did not know, to be the king, and dreading the pe∣nalties denounced against such as should refuse to discover him. A report of his death had prevailed some time, and would have contributed to render his life serene, had it lasted longer. He learned this, from the ringing of bells, and the public rejoicings that were made, on account of it, in the neighbourhood; but the report fell to the ground too soon, and did not, in the least, diminish the difficulties which opposed his em∣barking, notwithstanding all the pains that Co∣lonel Wyndham took, in order to forward this object.</P>
<P>A merchant, of the name of Esden, had just conveyed Lord Barclay over sea, whither he sled from the persecution of the parliament. Colo∣nel Wyndham, who knew this merchant, went
<PB N="316" REF="045437_0314_102000E66B29FCE0"/>
directly to Lyme, where he lived; and entreated him to perform the same kindness for a gentle∣man, a friend of his, who would desire to take no more than one servant with him in the whole. Mr. Esden went with him to the village of Car∣mouth, where he directed him to a master of a ship, with whom he might make his agreement. It was fixed, that the captain should come the next day but one, and receive his passengers a∣board, at a solitary part of the coast. The king was exact to the hour of his appointment, but no ship appeared. They learned, afterwards, that the preceding day, there had been a fair in Lyme, at which the parliament's proclamation, against such as should harbour or conceal the king, was read. The captain's wife being in∣formed, by her husband, that he was going to convey to France, certain persons, whom he did not name to her, opposed his design very strong∣ly; and, in order to hinder him completely from effecting it, she locked him up in his room, while he was busy getting ready some things ne∣cessary for the voyage.</P>
<P>Dreading, lest this incident should become public, Charles was obliged to quit Colonel Wyndham's house, without well knowing where to face. He proceeded, however, towards Dor∣chester, accompanied still by Wilmot, Colonel Wyndham, with one of his servants, being their guides. Wilmot's horse losing a shoe, the cir∣cumstance was very near occasioning the king's discovery. They had sent the horse to be shod in a village where they had stopped, as night came on. The blacksmith asked the hostler
<PB N="317" REF="045437_0315_102000E8E71274E8"/>
where his guests came from, who answering, that, by their own account, they came from Exeter: they impose upon you, replied the smith, with a countenance full of the important discovery, these shoes were made down in the north. The hostler, from this observation, recollecting that the four horsemen had ordered their horses to remain saddled, and had not bespoke beds for themselves, he concluded, at first, that they were certainly people of quality belonging to the king's army, which had been defeated near Worcester; and afterwards, that it might, very possibly, be the king himself. Upon the strength of this conjecture, he went to the minister of the parish, a violent parliamentarian, and communi∣cated his suspicions to him. The minister was, at that moment, engaged in prayer, and would not be interrupted. But the noise of this ad∣venture gaining ground, as the blacksmith, on his side, had not failed to circulate it, the mini∣ster took fire, and went to a justice of the peace. Immediately the whole town is up in arms, searching for the strangers, and a party is sent off after them, by the read which they were seen to take. The king could not possibly have es∣caped them, if, instead of keeping the main road, he had not turned short, and made the best of his way, by cross roads, to Salisbury.</P>
<P>We cannot sufficiently admire his continuing undiscovered during the remainder of his wan∣derings. The whole country was full of troops, marching in every direction; at every step he was surrounded by them. He no sooner stopped at an inn, but the soldiers, officers, whole com∣panies
<PB N="318" REF="045437_0316_102000EA6F8F1450"/>
enter the place. Just as he was going to step into a ship, which had been prepared for him at Southampton, there came up a battalion of soldiers, ordered for Jersey, and took possession of it before his face: at length, a friend contri∣ved to procure him a small bark at Shoreham, in Sussex, upon the application of a Mr. Mansell, a rich merchant of that quarter. They met at night, in a house not far from the harbour, and Charles waited on Sir John Wilmot at table, who had kept Mr. Mansell to supper, and the captain of the bark, whose name was Tatter∣shall. Supper being over, they were preparing to go aboard; and the king expected now to have no further risks to run, except those of the voyage, when the captain, taking the opportu∣nity of his being alone with Mr. Mansell, ad∣dressed him thus: You have deceived me, said he, and your enterprizing spirit, might have cost me my life. Mr. Mansell, who appeared igno∣rant of the matter himself, used every effort to persuade him, that the idea was without founda∣tion; and at length, Sir John Wilmot, over∣hearing them, came in, and plied him so strongly with money and promises, that he overcame his resistance. Captain Tattershall ran home im∣mediately; and asked his wife for linen and pro∣visions. You are in a great hurry, said she, why not wait till to-morrow; and as he continued pressing her to make haste; Well, said she, I see it is for the king. God give you success, and him too. The attempt is hazardous; but pro∣vided you save him, I am satisfied to beg my
<PB N="319" REF="045437_0317_102000EC3AA1DF58"/>
own and my children's bread, all my life. Ani∣mated by these words, Tattershall went to give the necessary orders, that his bark should be in readiness to sail the next morning at five o'clock. It took up the king at the appointed place; and his taking leave of his faithful friends, was a very tender scene. Mr. Mansell, approaching him the last, took him by the hand, and kissing it with fervor, I was willing, said he, to have been deceived by your majesty: I pray God, that you may arrive in safety, at your port, and return, very soon, in peace, to these your realms. Charles answered him, smiling, that he would then remember a service which was done him with so good a grace. The bark soon lost sight of the shore, and had so favourable a course the whole day, that they anchored, the same night, at Fescamp, from whence the king sat out for Paris, and arrived there October 30, 1651.</P>

<HEAD>THE HAT.</HEAD>
<P>A COUNTRYMAN came, one day, into a shop, in the city, and laying his hat on the counter, begged the master of the shop, to lend him half a guinea upon it, as a pledge. Do you take me for a madman, said the master of
<PB N="320" REF="045437_0318_102000EFA8A048A8"/>
the shop? it is against the law, and if it were not, that shabby hat is not worth two-pence. Such as it is, replied the countryman, I would not give it for five guineas, and yet I have very urgent oc∣casion for the sum that I ask. I sold my corn at the market, a week ago, to a mealman, who was to pay me to-day; and I depended upon having it to make up my rent, which has been so long due, that if it is not paid to-morrow, as I promised it should, I expect to be distrained for it. But the poor meal-man is almost broke, he has lately buried his only son, a grown-up youth, and now, this last week, his wife died of grief, so that I cannot be paid until next market-day. As I often come into your shop, to buy things, and you know me to be an honest man, I thought you would not make much difficulty a∣bout lending me half a guinea: it is nothing in your pocket, but is a great matter to me: at all hazards, there is my hat, to answer for the mo∣ney, and a better security than you think. The tradesman answered him only with a sneer, and, turning upon his heel, attended to other persons who were in the shop.</P>
<P>Sir George Liberal happened to be one of them: he had listened, with attention, to the countryman's discourse, and was struck with the air of honesty, that was apparent in his counte∣nance. He approached him gently, and putting half a guinea into his hand, Here is the money that you want, said he, since you find people so loth to oblige you, I will be your friend, without a pledge. With these words, he went out of the shop, eying the master of it with much con∣tempt;
<PB N="321" REF="045437_0319_102000F310D8AAF8"/>
and his carriage was gone a good dis∣tance off, before the countryman had recovered from the emotions of his joy and amazement.</P>
<P>About a month after, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir George Liberal was going in his chariot, up the Hay-market, he heard somebody call out, several times, to his coachman, to stop, but to no purpose, for the coachman drove briskly on, without paying any regard to him: at the same time, Sir George looking out, saw a man upon the footway, run∣ning, with all speed, to overtake the carriage; he, therefore, drew the string, to make the coach∣man stop. Immediately, the man springs to the coach-door, crying, I beg your pardon, Sir—I have run myself out of breath, to overtake you; Did not you, Sir, about a month ago, put half a guinea into my hand, in a shop in the city?—Why, yes, I remember something of it—Well, Sir, here is the money, which I return you, with many thanks. You did not give me time to thank you then, much less to ask your name and address; and the man of the shop did not know you. I came to town, every week, with my own hay and corn, in hopes that I might, some time or other, have the good fortune to meet with you: luckily, I saw you as you passed up the street. I should never have been happy, if I had not had the opportunity of paying my ac∣knowledgments to you; and may Heaven be∣stow upon you the recompense which your ge∣nerosity deserves. I am happy, said Sir George, in having obliged so honest a man as you seem to be; but I confess to you, I did not expect to see the money returned me. I intended it as a
<PB N="322" REF="045437_0320_102000F49A13B478"/>
small present to you.—That is more than I knew, Sir; and besides, I make a conscience of not receiving money that I do not earn. I had done nothing for you, and you had served me sufficiently, by lending me the sum in question. Let me beg you, therefore, to receive it again. No, my good friend, it belongs neither to you nor me, now: Do me the pleasure to buy some∣thing with it for your children, and give it to them as a present from me. Sir, your proceed∣ing is very genteel, and it would be uncivil in me to refuse your offer. Well, then, say no more, the matter is finished. But pray explain one particular to me, which has not ceased to engage my curiosity, ever since I saw you: How could you have the conscience to ask half a gui∣nea on your hat, which was scarcely worth a groat? Ah! Sir, it is worth every thing to me. How so, pray? I will give you the history of it.</P>
<P>Some years since, my landlord's son, sliding on a pool in his father's grounds, fell through the ice. I happened to be at work near the place, and hearing some people cry out, who saw the child sink; I ran to the spot, and throwing my∣self into the water with my clothes on, just as I was, I had the good fortune to save the child, and to restore him alive to his father: my land∣lord did not forget this service; he gave me a sung farm, in addition to what little land I held under him before, which was not much more than a cabbage-garden, supplied me with stock and utensils of husbandry, and in short set me up completely in my small farm. But this was not
<PB N="323" REF="045437_0321_102000F737B984A8"/>
all. As I had lost my hat in the water, be placed his own upon my head, saying at the same time, that he could have wished to place a crown upon it. You see, Sir, if I have not reason to be fond of this hat. I never wear it in the country: every thing there reminds me of my benefactor, though he has been dead some time. My children, my wife, my cottage, my land, all seem to speak, as it were, continually of him to my remembrance, But whenever I come to town▪ I always put on this hat, that I may have something about me to put me in mind of him. I am only sorry that it begins to grow old. You see, Sir, it is going; but as long as a bit of it remains together, it shall be inestimable in my eyes.</P>
<P>Sir George felt great pleasure from this recital of the countryman, and taking out his card, here, said he, farmer, take this, it contains my address, I am obliged to quit you now, but shall be glad to see you at my house next Sunday morning.</P>
<P>The countryman did not fail to come, at the time appointed: as soon as the servant carried in his name, Sir George himself came out to receive him, and, taking him by the hand, he said, my worthy friend, you have not, it is true, saved me an only son, but you have, nevertheless, performed me a very considerable service; you have taught me to love mankind better than I did before, by proving to me, that there are still hearts replete with honesty and gratitude. Since hats figure to such advantage on your head, here
<PB N="324" REF="045437_0322_102000F9B14C8F48"/>
is one that I wish you to accept as a present: I do not desire, however, that you should leave off that of your benefactor; only when it is in∣capable of being worn longer, I beg the reversion of your head for this; and every year, on this same day, you will find a new one here to re∣place it.</P>
<P>This was no more than a genteel pretext, which Sir George's delicacy suggested to him, in order to avoid hurting the countryman's pride: he knew, very well, that we should endeavour not to humble those whom we oblige, but to raise them in their own opinion. After having gained his heart by this first tie of friendship, he acquired sufficient ascendancy over him, to assume the right of conferring the most essential benefits on him and his family, and of repairing the losses which they had sustained by unavoidable strokes of fortune. He had finally the satis∣faction of seeing them nearly as happy in their gratitude, as he himself was in his generosity.</P>

<HEAD>LITTLE GRANDISON. A Letter from WILLIAM D—to his MO∣THER.</HEAD>
<P>O Dear mama! every body here is in the greatest consternation. Charles went out early this morning, on horseback, attended by a servant, in order to pay a visit to a friend five or six miles off and only think, he is not returned yet. His father had desired him to be home be∣fore five o'clock, and it is now past nine. Never before, did he disobey the commands of his pa∣rents. Something must have happened to him. It is a very dark night, and a dreadful thick fog. Mr. Grandison has just sent off a servant, to make enquiry about his son. How impatiently do I expect his return!</P>
<P>Eleven o'clock.</P>
<P>What distress! The servant is returned from the house where Charles went to spend the day. Charles had left it with his servant, before four o'clock. What can have become of him? Can he have gone astray in the forest, or fallen from his horse? Who can tell? Or have some vil∣lains
<PB N="326" REF="045437_0324_102000FFE42C4100"/>
robbed and murdered him? Good heaven! Mrs. Grandison will die, with apprehension. E∣mily does nothing but weep. Edward is like one distracted; he runs every moment up stairs, and into the yard. Mr. Grandison endeavours to comfort his wife; but it is easy to see that himself is in the deepest affliction. He has just sent out men on horseback, different ways, to en∣deavour to find poor Charles. If it were not for leaving his wife in her present distress; he would, before this time, have hurried out in search of his son. Oh! that I had gone with my friend! I should, at least, have shared all his dangers; but Mrs. Grandison insisted that I should stay at home, on account of a slight cold. Perhaps, if I had entreated her pressingly, she would have suffered me to go with him. I am quite unhap∣py. I know not how I support my affliction. I can no longer hold the pen. I do not see what I write.</P>
<P>One o'clock in the morning.</P>
<P>No Charles yet. Not a soul has gone to bed. Indeed, who could rest? The servants wring their hands: Edward and Emily cry incessantly, O, brother! brother! and this increases my un∣happiness. I wish it were morning.</P>
<P>Half after six in the morning.</P>
<P>God be praised, mama, we have news of Charles. The servant, who was with him, is just returned. No accident has happened to my friend. It is not his fault that he caused us so much uneasiness: he staid out neither through carelessness nor for pleasure. Far from deserv∣ing
<PB N="327" REF="045437_0325_1020010295FD4D90"/>
to be blamed, he is worthy of the highest praise. Oh! when you shall hear his adven∣ture! But Mr. Grandison absolutely insists, that we all go and lie down for a few hours, to reco∣ver ourselves, after the fatigues and anxiety of the night; and we must obey Farewell, ma∣ma, until I awake. My first care shall be to write to you. I will rise two hours the sooner, on purpose.</P>
<P>Nine o'clock.</P>
<P>I will now tell you the whole story, mama, from the account given us by the servant. His young master and himself, had set out before four o'clock, as I mentioned, in order to be at home by the time that Mr. Grandison had fixed for their return. They had scarcely come the fourth part of the way, when it began, all at once, to grow dark. There came on so thick a fog, that one could not distinguish an object at the distance of two yards. Charles, who is naturally cou∣rageous, did not make himself the least uneasy. They held on their way, at a full trot, when suddenly they perceived, straight before them, a man, stretched at his full length, on the road. What is here? cried Charles, stopping his horse. I suppose, replied the servant, somebody that has taken a glass too much. Let us go on, master.</P>
<P>No, said Charles, if it be a man in liquor, we must remove him, at least out of the coach way, for fear that some carriage, passing by, should go over him, in the dark. He had not said these words, before he was on the ground: but what was his surprize, when approaching the unfortu∣nate
<PB N="328" REF="045437_0326_10200104276914B0"/>
stranger, he perceived him to be an old offi∣cer, in regimentals. He had a large wound in his head, from which the blood flowed in abun∣dance. Charles spoke to him, but he returned no answer.</P>
<P>It is a dead man, cried the servant, who had also alighted.</P>
<P>No, no; he is still alive, said Charles. He is only in a swoon. Heavens! what shall we do?</P>
<P>What can we do? replied the servant; we must go on; then we can call at the first village, and send somebody to his assistance.</P>
<P>How unfeeling you are, John, cried Charles, with vivacity; before the persons that we might be able to send, should arrive here, this poor gen∣tleman would be dead. See what a quantity of blood he has lost. Fasten our horses to these trees. We must ourselves give him whatever assistance we can.</P>
<P>How, Sir? said John; sure you are not seri∣ous. It will be dark night presently; and we shall never be able to find our way home, in this fog.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, then, we will stay here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what will master and mistress say? You may guess how uneasy they will be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! that is very true. I never thought of that.</P>
<P>Charles was going to mount his horse again, but turning his eyes, which were filled with tears, toward the officer, he felt himself held to the spot by a secret power. No, unfortunate soldi∣er, cried he, I will not leave you in this deplora∣ble
<PB N="329" REF="045437_0327_10200106AAC96650"/>
situation. My parents cannot be angry with me for it. I will not suffer a fellow creature to perish, without doing every thing in my power to relieve him.</P>
<P>As he said these words, he took off his clothes in haste, and tore his waistcoat in two pieces.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are you doing there, master?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must bind up his forehead, to stop the wounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, Sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not say a word more, but come and assist me.</P>
<P>He then doubled his handkerchief in four folds, and bound the gentleman's head with it, which was still bleeding plentifully, and taking one side of his waistcoat, folded in length, he applied it to keep the bandage on fast, with pins. Afterwards, assisted by John, he lifted the unfortunate strang∣er out of the high road, and carried him on the grass.</P>
<P>What shall we do now, Sir? said John.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must gallop to the first village, and bring some people to convey this poor gen∣tleman to a farm house. I will pay them for their trouble, and, in the mean time, I shall wait here for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heaven forbid that I should do as you say. No, Master Charles, I will do no such thing. What, leave you all alone in this solita∣ry place? Your father would never forgive me for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I take the whole upon myself, and I insist that you obey me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="330" REF="045437_0328_1020010922DC4160"/>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, since you order me so posi∣tively, I have nothing more to say. But remem∣ber at least—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will remember every thing.</P>
<P>John sat off, therefore, as fast as his horse could gallop. A little farther on the road, he found a cottage, in which were two men at work, making wicker baskets, with several women and children. He opened the door, and, addressing himself to the head of the family, he requested him to come, with his eldest son, to the assistance of an old offi∣cer, who had fallen on the road, and was welter∣ing in his blood. They shewed, at first, some unwillingness to go out, on such a dark night, at the desire of a perfect stranger. But, at length, persuaded by the entreaties of John, and by the sincerity that appeared in his protestations, they went to fetch a sort of bier, and then accompa∣nied him.</P>
<P>During all this time, Charles had not quitted the old gentleman's side, a moment, and, by dint of care, had brought him to his senses again.</P>
<P>Shall I take the liberty, Sir, to ask your name, said he, as soon as he saw him open his eyes, and by what accident you came to be in this condi∣tion?</P>
<P>My name is Arthur, replied the old man, in a weak, tremulous voice. I am major in the—regiment. I had come from my own house, intending to take a ride. My horse stum∣bled on the road, hereabouts, and, in his fall, threw me over his neck. My head struck against a stone. I endeavoured to get up, but what with pain, loss of blood, and the weakness of old age, I
<PB N="331" REF="045437_0329_1020010BF0980870"/>
fainted away, and cannot tell what happened to me from that moment. But you, amiable child, who so feelingly compassionate my misfortune, is it you, that have dressed my wound, and saved my life?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sir, and I am happy to have had; it in my power to serve you. I had a ser∣vant with me: him I have sent to the next vil∣lage, to procure you lodging, and assistance more effectual than mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The major.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, have you had the courage to stay by my side, in this lonely place, notwith∣standing the darkness of the night! Young as you are, you have paid the most humane atten∣tion to me. What thanks do I owe you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>None, Sir. I have but done my du∣ty, and shall count myself happy, if I can be still farther useful to you.</P>
<P>This discourse was interrupted by the arrival of John, with the two men. They placed the major on the bier, on which they had, previously, laid a good mattrass: but, in spite of the pains that they took to convey him gently, the shaking of the bier, as they walked along, revived the pain of his wound, so that he fell again into a fainting fit.</P>
<P>Charles having given his horse to John to lead, walked in silence by the side of the bier, and shewed every sort of attention possible, to the wounded person, in order to make him recover his spirits. When they came to the door of the cottage, he made one of the countrymen mount his horse, and dispatched him, with all speed, for a surgeon.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="045437_0330_1020010E81B919E0"/>
Nevertheless, John used the most earnest per∣suasions to induce his young master to return home, and represented to him the terrors which his parents must feel, on account of his stay.</P>
<P>What, said Charles, should I leave this old man to die in the hands of strangers! You see, he is still insensible. I should have done nothing for him, were I to leave him now. No, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, I will spend the night by his side.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, Master Charles! You do not say so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>My resolution is fixed. Do you hasten home to my father and mother; tell them every thing that has happened, that they may not be uneasy on my account. Tell them that I will wait their orders, here, to-morrow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really, Sir, it is what I cannot think of doing. My master would receive me finely, if I were to return without you.</P>
<P>It must be so, for all that, replied Charles, in a firm tone of voice. Do not lose time. It is night already.</P>
<P>It was in vain that John protested against what he called the imprudence of his young master: he was obliged to go.</P>
<P>Charles was easier then, supposing that his parents would soon hear of him: but there was another unlucky accident still destined to befall them; the fog grew thicker and thicker, the night grew darker, and John, losing his way in a wood through which he was to pass, and not knowing by what course he was to get out of it, was obliged, after many ineffectual scampers, to seat himself at the foot of a tree, and there
<PB N="333" REF="045437_0331_10200110FA5F9E68"/>
to wait for daylight, leaving us, all the while, in the most terrible alarm. The poor man was quite exhausted with cold and weariness, when he came home this morning. Notwithstanding his hurry to come, he was afraid to shew himself, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he should be turned away. I cannot describe to you his surprize, when, after finishing his sto∣ry, he heard Mr. Grandison cry out, How much ought I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o bless heaven for having given me such a son! And you, John, have done very well, to obey his orders in every respect. Here are two guineas, to make you amends for your bad night. Go, refresh yourself, and take a little sleep, that you may be able to go back to my son. I am not the least angry with him for all the uneasiness that he has caused us. He did every thing in his power to relieve us from it.</P>
<P>But how will my friend be grieved, when he learns from John what we ourselves have suffer∣ed! John is set off already. I saw Mr. Gran∣dison give him a purse of money for his son, that he may have wherewithal to provide every thing necessary. I am impatient now to know whe∣ther the poor major be alive or dead. I hope soon to be able to give you some account of him. Farewell, dear mama, continue to love me, and love also my friend Charles, for his courage, presence of mind, and humanity.</P>
<P>Eleven o'clock.</P>
<P>At last, mama, Charles is returned. With what transport did I embrace him! He appear∣ed an angel in my eyes. Thanks to his care, the major is much better. His hurt will soon be cured.</P>

Charles arrived much sooner than we expect∣ed. Emily was the first who saw him! She screamed out with joy and surprize, Charles! Charles! and ran precipitately to meet him: they came in, kissing each other. Charles quit∣ted her at the door, to fly to his father. He threw himself at his feet, and did not rise from thence, till he perceived his mother hold out her arms to embrace him. I will relate to you, word for word, the discourse that passed between them. I shall never forget it as long as I live.</P>

<HEAD>NARRATIVE OF A SHIPWRECK.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 17th of November, 1780, I em∣barked on board the St. Lawrence brigan∣tine, then lying in the bason of Quebec, and bound to New-York, being charged with dis∣patches from General Haldimand, commander in chief in that province, to Sir Henry Clinton. The same day, on receiving our sailing orders, we weighed anchor, and dropped down to the harbour called Patrick's Hole, in the island of Orleans, in company with a schooner bound to the same port, on board of which was an Ensign,
<PB N="6" REF="045437_0338_102001248C6B13C0"/>
Drummond, of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>44<SUP>th</SUP> regiment, with dupli∣cates of General Haldimand's dispatches. In this place, we were detained six days by a contrary wind: at the expiration of which time, the frost had sat in with prodigious severity; and the ice was forming fast in all parts of the river. Had the wind continued unfair for a few days longer, we should have been entirely blocked up by it, and had happily escaped the calamities which afterward befel us.</P>
<P>On the 24th, the wind being fair, we got under way, and proceeded down the river St. Lawrence, as far as the Brandy-Pots; islands so called, about forty leagues from Quebec. At this place; the wind veered about to the north∣east, which obliged us again to anchor. The weather continued intensely cold; and the vessel being leaky, made so much water, as to render it necessary to keep one pump continually going. A change of wind soon after enabled us to proceed on our voyage, and to make the island of Anti∣coste, which is at the mouth of the river St. Law∣rence; when the wind coming round again to the eastward, we were obliged to beat off and on, between this island and Cape Roziere for four days; our vessel at the same time increasing her leaks to such a degree, that we were under the necessity of rigging the other pump, and of keeping them both constantly at work. Being now in a higher latitude, the severity of the cold had increased in proportion, and the ice began to form so fast about the ship, as to alarm us ex∣ceedingly, lest we should be entirely surrounded
<PB N="7" REF="045437_0339_1020012710075138"/>
by it; which we only prevented, by cutting and breaking vast quantities of the ice from her sides. To this task, with that of keeping the pumps at work, the crew, together with the passengers, were scarcely equal; only nineteen persons being on board, of whom six were passengers, and the remainder very indifferent seamen. As for the master, from whom, in the present emergency we might have expected some degree of exertion, instead of attending to his duty, and the preser∣vation of his ship, he remained continually in a state of intoxication in his cabin.</P>
<P>On the 29<SUP>th</SUP> the wind came round to the north-west, and we proceeded down the gulf of St. Lawrence, with two feet water in the ship's hold. The wind kept gradually increasing till the 1<SUP>st</SUP> of December, when it blew a perfect gale from the north-west quarter; and the ship's crew being now almost overcome with cold and fatigue, seeing no prospect of gaining upon the leak, the water having already in∣creased to four feet in the hold, nor a possibility of making any port, they came to the resolution of working no longer at the pumps; which was unanimously agreed to, by all the foremast-men. They accordingly left off working, and declared themselves quite indifferent about their fate; preferring the alternative, of going to the bottom together with the vessel, to that of suffering such severe and incessant labour in so desperate a situation. Their fatigues, it must be confessed, from the 17<SUP>th</SUP> of November had been excessive: and though hope might still remain, yet our
<PB N="8" REF="045437_0340_102001289A385B48"/>
present circumstances were such, as to exclude at least all probability of saving the vessel. How∣ever, by the force of persuasion and promises, together with the timely distribution of a pint of wine per man, which I had fortunately brought on board, they were diverted from this desperate resolution; but with great reluctance, saying, with some truth, as we afterwards experienced, and with more than they themselves were aware of, that whether the vessel filled or not, was a matter of no consequence. This delay, though not exceeding a quarter of an hour, had increased the depth of water another foot; but the men added to their exertions, being encouraged by the wine, which was issued to them every half-hour, succeeded so far, as to reduce the water in the space of two hours, to less than three feet. The▪ captain still remained in his cabin.</P>
<P>During the 2d and 3d of December, the gale seemed to increase rather than diminish. The ice formed so thick on the ship's sides, as to im∣pede her way very much through the water; which furnished us with a new labour, that of cutting it off, as fast as it formed, with saws and axes. The leak continued to gain ground. The schooner that was in company, far from being able to afford us any assistance, was in as leaky a condition as our own vessel, having struck upon some rocks at the island of Coudres, through the ignorance or neglect of her pilot. A heavy snow beginning to fall, it was with the utmost difficulty we could get sight of each other, though at no great distance, and,
<PB N="9" REF="045437_0341_1020012A26CD9BE8"/>
in order not to part company, fired every half-hour. The schooner, at length, made no answer to our guns; whence, we concluded, she had foundered; nor were we wrong in our suppo∣sition. There were sixteen persons on board, every one of whom perished.</P>
<P>On the following day the gale increased pro∣digiously, and the sea began to run high, with a heavy fall of snow, so as to prevent our seeing twenty yards a-head of the vessel. The men being excessively fatigued, the water had risen to its usual quantity, of between four and five feet. The mate, whom I have not yet taken notice of, an intelligent young man, and well acquainted with his profession, judged, from the distance we had run, that we could not now be far from the Magdalen Islands, which lie about mid-way in the gulf of St. Lawrence. These islands are nothing more than a cluster of rocks, some ap∣pearing above, and others hidden under the water, and have been fatal to many vessels. Seamen wish often to make them in fine weather, as they serve to take a new departure from; but in foggy or blowing weather they, as studiously avoid them. The mate's conjecture was but too well founded; for in less than two hours, we heard the sea breaking upon the rocks; and soon after discovered the principal island, called the Deadman, close under our lee; the point of which, it was with the greatest difficulty that we weathered. Having happily cleared the main island, we were still far from thinking ourselves secure; for being unable, on account of the
<PB N="10" REF="045437_0342_1020012EB2815A10"/>
heavy fall of snow, to see many yards a-head of the vessel, and, being in the midst of the small islands, there appeared very little probability that we should pass clear of them all in the same man∣ner. Not being able to distinguish any one, in time to avoid it, we were obliged to leave the vessel to the direction of Providence, and fortunately, I might say almost miraculously, ran through them all, without damage. The anxiety and per∣turbation of mind that the crew and passengers were in, while in the midst of these rocks, may be easily conceived: and now, that the danger was over, it turned out to be a fortunate occur∣rence for us; for, by this time, the sailors being ready to sink under the accumulated distresses of cold and fatigue, and depressed by the little hopes they had of saving the vessel, had nearly deter∣mined, a second time, to quit the pumps; and leave the vessel to her fate: when acquiring fresh spirits from the danger we had escaped, and, as the vulgar are generally inclined to superstition, attributing what was perhaps accident alone, to the immediate interposition of Providence, they agreed to continue their efforts a little longer; towards which, they were likewise not a little encouraged, by the wine which I distributed to them occasionally.</P>
<P>During the night, the gale continuing, and the sea running very high, we were apprehensive of being what seamen call pooped, or having the stern or poop of the vessel beaten in by the waves; which happened in fact as we appre∣hended: for about five in the morning of the
<PB N="11" REF="045437_0343_10200130408D6738"/>
5<SUP>th</SUP>, a large wave broke on the ship's quarter, which stove in our dead-lights, filled the cabin, and washed the master out of his bed, where he had remained ever since the commencement of the gale. This accident, was attended with worse consequences than we at first imagined; for we soon discovered, from the increase of the leaks, that the stern-post had been started by the impulse of the sea. Having nothing in the after-hold, no other resource was left but that of at∣tempting to stop the leaks with beef, which we cut into small pieces for that purpose: but this expedient we soon found ineffectual, and the water continued to gain on us faster than ever. The sailors finding all their labours fruitless, and the leak, which was constantly increasing be∣fore, now rendered by our late misfortune en∣tirely irreparable, abandoned themselves totally to despair; and again refused to work at the pumps any longer. They had not however long remained inactive, before we contrived once more to persuade them, to make another effort to clear the vessel; when, to our great surprise and consternation, we found the pumps so hard frozen, that it was impossible to move them.</P>
<P>All endeavours now to keep the ship clear were ineffectual, so that in a very short time she filled to the water's edge. Having no longer, as we imagined, the smallest foundation for hope, we resigned ourselves, with as much fortitude as possible, to our fate, which we expected every moment, to be that of going to the bottom. Notwithstanding, when the vessel was quite full,
<PB N="12" REF="045437_0344_10200132B60B3480"/>
we observed she was very little deeper in the wa∣ter than before; and, then recollecting a circum∣stance, which the trouble and confusion we had been in had almost obliterated, namely, that we had a quantity of lumber on board, imme∣diately accounted for the phenomenon of her not sinking beyond a certain depth in the water; and began to recall hopes of saving our lives, at least, if we could but prevent her from overset∣ting, till we could make the island of St. Johns, or some other islands in the gulph. Having no guns on deck, (and not much lumber) to render the ship top-heavy, we contrived to prevent her from oversetting, by steering directly before the wind; though not without some difficulty, as, from the little way she made through the water, the waves frequently washed clear over the decks. Besides taking care to keep the vessel steady, we used every precaution, to secure our boat from being washed overboard, the loss of which would, in our present circumstances, be a dreadful mis∣fortune. The cabin, being raised above the level of the main deck, was tolerably clear of water, and afforded us some little shelter from the severity of the weather. Thither we re∣tired, leaving only one man upon deck to govern the helm, who was fastened by a rope, to pre∣vent his being carried away by the waves, which, at times made a free passage over us.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="045437_0345_10200134455AD598"/>
The gale still continued, without remission, the snow falling so thick, at the same time, as to prevent our seeing to the mast-head. We knew, from the distance we had run, that we could not be far from land. The captain imagined, from our course, during the night, and since the ship filled in the morning, that we must be near the island of St. John's, which lies between the Mag∣dalen islands, and the Gut of Canso. This gave us hopes of saving our lives, in case we could run ashore on some sandy part of it, till they were dashed, by the further information we had from he captain, that the north-east side of the island, was nothing but a continued reef of rocks, from one end to the other, and that there was but one harbour where ships could put in, which he recollected, was on the opposite side of the island. In a few hours after, we observed the waves grew shorter and break higher, which is always found to be the case on approaching the shore; and likewise, a number of gulls and ducks flying about, a further sign we could not be far distant from it.</P>
<P>We now concluded that we were about to run upon the rocks, which, the captain informed us, skirted the north-east side of the island, and on approaching the land, laboured under greater dread and apprehension, than amidst all the dan∣gers we had before experienced, the idea of be∣ing cast upon those tremendous rocks, being more terrifying than that of being buried, as our companions were, in the bosom of the ocean. The ship had still made considerable way through the water, though full, and with no other sail
<PB N="14" REF="045437_0346_10200137DAB96E40"/>
set, but a close-reefed fore-top-sail, which was the only one we could display; and the canvass being new, it had hitherto stood the gale. The captain proposed bringing the ship too, to keep her off the land; which I opposed, as well as the mate, urging the probability that, we should overset her in the attempt; and that moreover, should we be able to effect it, she must, after all, drive ashore, as in her present state, it was im∣possible to make any way to windward. Our opinion, however, was rejected, and an attempt was made to brace about the fore-yard; but it was found impracticable, the ropes and blocks being covered with ice. We were, therefore, obliged to let it remain as before; and the wa∣ter having suddenly changed its colour, we ex∣pected the ship to strike every instant. Small as our expectations were of saving our lives, I thought it incumbent on me, to take every pre∣caution to save the dispatches I was charged with, and therefore ordered my servant to open my trunks, and collect all the letters they contained, which I put into a handkerchief, and fastened a∣bout my waist. He, at the same time, offered me the money he found in them, to the amount of one hundred and eighty guineas, which I de∣sired him to dispose of as he thought proper, thinking it, in the present emergency, rather an incumbrance, than a matter worthy of preserva∣tion. My servant, however, thought otherwise, and took care to secure the cash, which was, af∣terwards, of more service to us, than at that time I could possibly have imagined.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="045437_0347_1020013B5EEE80B8"/>
The weather continued thick, as usual, till a∣bout one o'clock, when suddenly clearing up, we discovered the land, at about three leagues dis∣tance. This sight gave us no small satisfaction, taking it, at first, to be the island of St. John's, which, being inhabited by several French and English families, we might have expected some assistance from them; but, on a nearer view, found, from the plans we had on board, that it had not the least appearance of that island, there being no such mountains and precipices laid down, as we discovered. On drawing nigher, we observed the sea break high, and have a very dismal appearance, about three miles from the land. As it was necessary for us to pass through those breakers, ere we could gain the shore, we expected that our fate would be determined there; but, contrary to our expectations, there was a considerable depth of water, so that we went over the reef without touching, though not without shipping many heavy seas, which, had not the vessel's timbers been strong, and her loading light, must infallibly have dashed her to pieces. The land now began to have a dread∣ful appearance, seeming, at the distance we were off, to be high and rocky; but, on approaching within a mile of it, we had the pleasure of de∣scrying a fine sandy beach, and a bold shore. The sea ran high, but not to such a degree as on the reef we had already passed. As we advan∣ced, the water continued to have a depth beyond our most sanguine wishes, so as to allow us to come within fifty or sixty yards of the beach be∣fore we struck. Now was the time for every
<PB N="16" REF="045437_0348_1020013CE84FA038"/>
man's apprehensions to be on the rack, as we might expect, on touching the shore, that the ship would go to pieces. At length she ground∣ed, with a violent concussion. On the first stroke the main-mast went out of the step, and on the second, the fore-mast; but neither of them fell over the side, the deal boards in the hold being stowed so close together that the masts had no room to play below; at the same time the rud∣der was unshipped, with such violence, as to be near killing one of the sailors. As soon as the ship had grounded, the sea began to beat over her in every part, each wave lifting her four or five feet nearer the shore. In a short space of time the stern was beat in by the sea; and then, having no shelter in the cabin, we were obliged to go upon deck, and hang by the shrouds, lest we should be washed overboard. In this un∣comfortable situation we remained, till the vessel was beat so high by the waves, that we could venture to walk upon deck. We now perceived that the ship's keel was broken, which we ima∣gined would occasion her to go to pieces: this, however, did not happen for the present; which I can only attribute to the boards in the hold being so interwoven with each other, and frozen together by the ice, as to give a degree of soli∣dity to the vessel.</P>
<P>Our first care now was to get out the boat; which was not be accomplished, without difficul∣ty, on account of the quantity of ice that was in and about it, and our reduction in number of effective hands by the intoxication of several of the crew, who had thought that the most effec∣tual
<PB N="17" REF="045437_0349_1020013F62F2BB48"/>
method of getting rid of the apprehensions they laboured under. Our vessel had, from the violence of the waves dashing against her, broach∣ed too, with her broadside to the wind, so that afforded some shelter for the boat to the leeward. Having, with much labour, cleared the boat of ice, and prepared her for launching, I ordered some liquor to be distributed to those who were yet sober, and then asked, if any were willing to embark with me in the boat, and make the at∣tempt to gain the shore. The sea running so high, that it appeared scarcely possible for the boat to live in it for a minute, very few were willing to make an experiment so full of risk; so that all who offered themselves, were, the mate and two sailors, together with my servant, and a boy, who was a passenger on board. What gave us the greatest embarrassment in this under∣taking, was, the surf which broke over us every moment, and the intenseness of the cold, which froze every drop of water immediately, so as to cover our clothes with a sheet of ice. At length we got the boat into the water, and having thrown into it an axe and a saw, I leaped in, followed by my servant and the mate. The boy followed us, but not springing far enough, fell into the water: he did not, however, sink im∣mediately; and we contrived to drag him into the boat, but not without difficulty; our fingers being so benumbed with the cold, that we had scarcely the power of using them: and this ac∣cident was, in the issue, by the chill it gave him. of fatal consequence to the unfortunate youth. The two sailors, who had agreed to go with us,
<PB N="18" REF="045437_0350_1020014324D31FC0"/>
next leaped into the boat; and all the rest seem∣ed ready, notwithstanding their former hesitation, to follow the example, when I found it necessary to shove her off from the ship's side; for, being very small, she certainly would have sunk, had so many persons crowded in together. The ship was lying about forty yards from the shore; but, before we got half-way to it, we were over∣taken by a wave that almost filled the boat, and the next drove us on the dry sand.</P>
<P>To find ourselves once more safe upon the land, gave us no small satisfaction, though in so destitute a state: the joy at having escaped those dangers, which so long had been the chief objects of our dread, made us, for a few moments, for∣get that we were snatched from them, merely to be exposed to others more inevitable; that we had escaped one species of death, probably to undergo another, more lingering and painful. What most affected us, was, the distress of our companions, whom we had left on board, whose lamentations, and cries for help, we could hear very distinctly. But it was impossible for us, however anxious, to afford them any assistance. Our boat being beat high upon the sand, could now be of no use, either to us or to them, while the sea was running to such a degree, that it was not in the power of a human being to relieve them.</P>
<P>The night was now approaching, and we had not long remained in this situation, ere we found ourselves getting stiff with cold; and the gale continuing as severe as ever, we were obliged to made, with extreme difficulty, up to our waists
<PB N="19" REF="045437_0351_10200144AEE02AF8"/>
in snow, to the shelter of a thick wood, about two hundred and fifty yards from the beach. This afforded some relief from the piercing north-west wind; yet a fire was still wanting, to warm our frozen limbs, and we had not where∣withal to kindle one. We had, indeed, taken the precaution to put a tinder-box in the boat, but the water had rendered it totally useless. Freezing, as we stood, there was nothing to be done, but to keep the blood in motion by exer∣cise: I, therefore, recommended it to the men, to move about, being better acquainted with the nature of cold climates, and that of frost, than any of my companions. My advice was strict∣ly adhered to, for about half an hour, when the young passenger, whom I have already mention∣ed, being overcome with the severity of the wea∣ther, threw himself down, in order to sleep; for extreme cold always occasions a sleepy sensation, that is not easily to be resisted. I used my ut∣most endeavours, both by persuasion and force, to rouse him, and make him stand on his legs, but all to no purpose; so I was obliged to let him pursue his inclination. After walking about for half an hour longer, during which time, I felt such a strong desire to sleep, that I should have lain down myself, had I not been aware of the fatal consequences attending it, I went to the place where the boy lay, and, putting my hand on his face, and finding it quite cold, I observed to the mate, who was close by, that I believed he was dead. To which the youth answered, im∣mediately, that he was not yet dead, but would be so very shortly; and requested I would write,
<PB N="20" REF="045437_0352_10200147306C7FE8"/>
if I survived, to his father, at New-York, and inform him of the circumstances of his son's misfortune. In about ten minutes, we found that he had expired, and, as I imagined, without any pain whatever, at least without any acute sensation of it. These trivial matters would be unworthy of notice, but as they serve to shew the effect of intense cold on the human body, and to prove, that freezing to death, is not al∣ways attended with so much pain as is common∣ly supposed.</P>
<P>The death of the boy could not deter the rest of my fellow-sufferers from giving way to this drowsy sensation; and three of them lay down, in spite of my repeated exhortations to the contrary. Finding it impossible to keep them on their legs, I broke a branch, and, desiring the mate to do the same, our employment, during the remainder of the night, was to prevent them from sleeping, by beating them continually with the branches. This was an exercise useful to ourselves, at the same time that it preserved the lives of our companions. The day-light, which we looked for with such anxious expectation, at length appeared, when I desired the men to pull down their stockings, and let me examine their legs, as they observed they had no feeling in them. As soon as I cast my eyes on them, I perceived, very clearly, that they were frozen, at least, half way up; and desired they would im∣mediately rub them with snow, which they did for a considerable time, but to little purpose; for it was impossible to restore them to their feel∣ing.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="045437_0353_10200148DFD202E8"/>
I then went with the mate, down to the beach, to see if we could discover any traces of the ship, and our companions, whom we had left on board, and, to our great surprise and satisfaction, found she had not yet gone to pieces, though the wind continued with unabated severity. My first study, now, was, how to get them ashore, our own safety, as well as their's, depending on it. I was almost stiff with cold, but found feel∣ing in every part, and was therefore certain I could not be frozen. What seemed greatly to facilitate the undertaking, was, that the vessel had, by this time, beat much nigher the shore, so that the distance was but very small at low water. It was high flood, when we arrived on the beach; we were therefore obliged to wait till the tide was out, when we advised the people on board, to fasten a rope to the jib-boom, by which they might swing themselves, one by one, toward the shore. They accordingly adopted this expedi∣ent, and, by watching the motion of the sea, and seizing the opportunity of swinging themselves, as the waves retired, they all got safe on the land, except a carpenter, who was a passenger in the vessel. He did not think proper to venture, in this manner, or was unable, having, the night before, made rather too free with the bottle. We were happy, however, to get so many of them on shore, every one of whom, a few hours be∣fore, we concluded must have perished.</P>
<P>The captain had, fortunately, before he left the ship, put some materials for striking a light, in his pocket. We therefore went to work in
<PB N="22" REF="045437_0354_1020014C65363EC0"/>
cutting wood, and gathering the branches that lay scattered upon the ground, of which we made a fire, with all possible expedition, and were hap∣py, for some time, in hovering about it, and warming our benumbed limbs. Considering the extreme cold we had endured for such a length of time, no luxury could be equal to that of the fire; but this gratification was, like many others, to several of my companions, followed by the most excruciating pain, as soon as their frozen parts began to thaw. Several of those who had remained all night in the vessel, as well as those who came ashore with me in the boat, had been frozen in different parts of their mem∣bers. The distress that was now painted in the faces of these unfortunate men, from the tor∣tures they underwent, was beyond expression: this I knew would be the case, before I heard them complain; but, as there was no remedy, did not think it necessary to give them any inti∣mation of it.</P>
<P>When we came to examine into our numbers, I observed that a Captain Green, a passenger, was missing; and was informed, that he had fallen asleep on board the vessel, and had been frozen to death. We were rather uneasy about the man who still remained on board, yet had some hopes of saving his life, in case the ship did not go to pieces, at the return of low water: but it being too difficult to undertake in the night, we were under the necessity of waiting till the following day. This night we passed a little better than the last; yet, notwithstanding we had a good fire, we found extreme inconve∣niency
<PB N="23" REF="045437_0355_1020015012373158"/>
from the total want of covering, as well as from hunger, a new misery, that we had hi∣therto been unacquainted with. Besides which, the greatest part of our number were in the most wretched state imaginable, from the sores occasi∣oned by the frost.</P>
<P>The next morning, as many of us as were able, went to the beach, to contrive some means to extricate the carpenter, whose voice we heard on board the vessel. The sea still running with the same violence as before, we could not put out the boat to his assistance, and were, therefore, obliged to wait the return of low water, when we persuaded him to come on shore in the same manner as the others had done; but this he ac∣complished with much difficulty, being very weak, and frozen in different parts of his limbs. We still remained without any kind of provisi∣ons, and began to be reduced in strength, for want of nourishment.</P>
<P>The 7th and 8th, the gale continued as bois∣terous as ever; and, in the night, between the 8th and 9th of December, the ship went to pieces, from the stern to the main-mast, from the extreme violence with which the sea broke against her. By this part of her going to pieces, we ob∣tained some provisions, which washed on shore, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> some pieces of salt beef, likewise some fresh meat, that hung over the stern, and a quantity of onions, that the captain had on board for sale. This relief was very seasonable, it being now the fourth day since we had eaten any kind of pro∣vision whatever. Having no utensils, we dressed our meat in the best manner we could, and made
<PB N="24" REF="045437_0356_102001519BF902C0"/>
what we thought a most delicious repast. The sense of hunger being assuaged, we set to work in collecting all the provisions we could find scat∣tered upon the beach, being apprehensive that we should not soon get a supply from any other quarter. This done, our next care was to get ourselves under cover, and form some kind of shelter from the pier∣cing blast. This task was not an easy one, so many of our company being unable to move, and of the remainder, none but the mate and myself capable of any active exertion, being all more or less bitten by the frost; and our number reduced to seventeen, by the loss of two persons, as al∣ready mentioned. A quantity of deals had float∣ed on shore from the wreck: of these we carried about two hundred and fifty into the wood, and by ten at night completed a kind of house, about twenty feet long and ten wide; which was con∣structed in the following manner. We cut two poles of the abovementioned length, and, having no nails, tied them at a proper height on the outside of two trees, at the distance of twenty feet from each other: the interval between the poles, which was equal to the breadth of the trees, served for the smoke of our fire to go through; the fire itself being laid in an oblong position, extending itself nearly the whole length of the house. Against these cross poles we placed boards with a slope of about sixty degrees to∣wards the ground, which constituted the two principal sides. The two other sides were com∣posed of boards placed perpendicular, the trunks of the trees being taken in, and forming part of each side, on one of these sides, that looked to∣ward
<PB N="25" REF="045437_0357_102001548223E9A0"/>
the south-east, we left a vacancy for the entrance.</P>
<P>This business being over, we examined the quantity of provisions we had collected, and had the satisfaction to find that we had in store, be∣tween two and three hundred pounds of salt beef, and a considerable stock of onions. As to bread, we had none; for, when the vessel went to pieces, the casks were stove, and the bread lost. Economy and good management, were now highly necessary, to make our little stock last as long as possible, it being quite uncertain when we could get any relief; and, in consequence, it was determined, that each man, whether sick or well, should be confined to a quarter of a pound of beef, and four onions per day, as long as the latter should last. This wretched allowance, but just enough to keep a man from starving, was the utmost we thought it prudent to afford ourselves, lest we should be in an uninhabited country; for as yet, we were rather uncertain on what coast we were cast away; though afterwards, on com∣paring circumstances, we concluded it must be on the island of Cape Breton.</P>
<P>On the 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/><SUP>th</SUP> of December, being the sixth day after we landed, the gale abated, and gave us an opportunity to launch our boat, and get on board what remained of the vessel. Three of us accordingly embarked, having, with much la∣bour, launched the boat, and cleared her of the sand and ice. As soon as we got on board the wreck, we went to work at opening the hatches, and having but one axe, and the cables being fro∣zen over them in a solid lump of ice, it took the
<PB N="26" REF="045437_0358_1020015701D29D20"/>
whole day to accomplish it. The next day, the weather being still moderate, we went again on board, and having cleared away the remainder of the cable, we cut up part of the deck, in order to make room to get out two casks of onions, with a small barrel of beef, containing about one hundred and twenty pounds, and three barrels of apples, shipped by a Jewish merchant, of Que∣bec. We like wise found a quarter cask of po∣tatoes, a bottle of oil, which proved very service∣able to the men's sores, another axe, a large iron pot, two camp-kettles, and about twelve pounds of tallow candles. With much difficulty we got this great supply on shore. On the 13th, we made it our business to get our provisions stowed away in a corner of the hut, when, on opening the apple-casks, we found their contents, to our great surprise, converted into bottles of Canadi∣an balsam, a more valuable commodity, to be sure, than apples, but what we could gladly have exchanged, in our present situation, for something more friendly to the stomach than to the consti∣tution. This disappointment, as may be sup∣posed, extorted a few hearty good wishes to∣wards the Jew; yet we found, afterwards, some use for his Canadian balsam, though somewhat different from what he intended it should be ap∣plied to.</P>
<P>The considerable supply we got from on board the wreck, enabled us the next day to add four onions to our daily allowance. We went on board once more on the 14th, and cut as much of the sails as possible from the bowsprit, with part of which we covered our hut, and made it
<PB N="27" REF="045437_0359_1020015ACF2D3930"/>
tolerably warm and comfortable, notwithstand∣ing the severity of the weather. By this time the sores of the men, who had been frost-bitten, began to mortify, and caused their toes, fingers, and other parts of the limbs affected, to rot off, their anguish being at the same time almost into∣lerable. The carpenter, who came on shore after the others, had lost the greatest part of his feet, and on the 14th, at night, became delirious, in which unhappy state he continued, till death released him the following day from his miserable existence. We covered him with snow and branches of trees, having neither spade nor pick∣axe to dig a grave for him; nor would it have been possible, if we had been provided with them, the ground being in this climate so hard frozen during the winter, as to be almost impenetrable. Three days after, our second mate died in the same manner, having been delirious some hours before he expired. We felt but very little con∣cern at the death of our companions, either on their account or our own: for, in the first place, we considered it rather a happiness than a mis∣fortune, to be deprived of life, in our present wretched situation, and, in the second, because there became the fewer mouths to consume our little stock of provisions: indeed, had not some paid the debt of nature, we should in the end have been reduced to the shocking necessity of killing and devouring one another. Though not yet reduced to this necessity, our condition was so miserable, that it seemed scarcely possible for any new distress to make a sensible addition to it. Besides the prospect of perishing, through
<PB N="28" REF="045437_0360_1020015C58369FA8"/>
want, in that desolate place, and the pain arising from a perpetual sense of hunger and cold, the agony that the greatest part were in, from the sores occasioned by the frost, was beyond ex∣pression, while their groans were almost equally distressing to the remainder—but what affected me more than all our other miseries, was, the quantity of vermin, proceeding from the men's sores, and continually increasing, which infested us in every part, and rendered us disgusting even to ourselves. Several, however, who had been but slightly frozen, recovered in a short time, with the loss of a few toes and fingers; no one having entirely escaped the frost, but myself. On the 20th another sailor died, after having been, like the others, some time in a delirium, and was buried, or rather covered, in the same man∣ner. Our number was now reduced to fourteen persons; yet we did not think it prudent to in∣crease the allowance of provisions, but still kept it at the rate originally fixed on, of a quarter of a pound of beef <HI>per diem.</HI></P>
<P>The mate and I had frequently gone out to∣gether, since we were shipwrecked, to try if we could discover any traces of inhabitants, but, hi∣therto, without success. About a fortnight after we had fixed ourselves in the hut, we took the opportunity of a fine day to walk ten or twelve miles up a river, upon the ice, where we ob∣served many tracks of moose-deer and other animals, some of which we might have killed, had we been provided with arms and ammuni∣tion. In our progress up the river we discover∣ed
<PB N="29" REF="045437_0361_1020015F1FA4BD10"/>
several trees cut on one side, as we imagined, by an axe, which gave us reason to think there might he Indians near at hand. On going up to the place, we could plainly perceive, that there had been some there lately, by their wigwam, which still remained with some fresh bark about it. We likewise found the skin of a moose-deer hanging across a pole. We travelled a good way further, in hopes of making some more dis∣coveries of this nature, but to no purpose. It gave us, nevertheless, some satisfaction to find, that we were in a place where inhabitants had been lately, as it was probable they might again return there. In case this should happen, I cut a long pole, and stuck it in the ice, upon the river; then with my knife, which I always took care to preserve, as it was the only one among us, cut a piece of bark from a birch tree, and forming it into the shape of a hand, with the fore-finger extended, and pointing toward our hut, fixed it on the top of the pole, and took away the moose-skin, in order that they might perceive that some persons had been on the spot since they left it, and the route they had taken on their return. We then pursued the way to our habitation, and communicated this agreeable information to our companions, who were not yet able to move about: trifling as the hopes were, which we could in reason derive from this discovery, yet it gave them considerable satis∣faction. Twenty days being elapsed since our shipwreck, and our provisions being very much reduced, I began to entertain a suspicion, that there was some foul play during my absence at
<PB N="30" REF="045437_0362_10200160B0CF4128"/>
different times from the hut, in search of inha∣bitants. I was therefore determined to find out the truth, if possible, by keeping a constant watch at night; by which means I at length discover∣ed, that the depredators were no other than the captain and two sailors, who had consumed no less than seventy pounds, besides a quantity of onions, in so short a space of time. To prevent such unfair practices for the future, the mate and I never went out together, one of us constantly remaining in the hut.</P>
<P>We continued in a state of suspense, from our last discovery, for some days, when giving up, at length, all hopes of seeing any Indians or inhabi∣tants in this place, having provisions only for six weeks longer, and a few of our men, together with the captain, being recovered, I proposed leaving our habitation, with as many as could work in the boat, in search of inhabitants. This proposal was unanimously assented to; but when we came to think how it was to be put in execution, a new difficulty started itself, namely, that of repairing the boat, which had been beat in such a manner by the sea upon the beach, that every seam was open. We first attempted to stop them with dry oakum, but soon found that it would not answer the intended purpose, and having saved no pitch from on board the wreck, we began to despair of the possibility of repairing them. I, at length, thought of making a kind of succedaneum for pitch, of the Canadian balsam, which, as I before mentioned, had been shipped f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r apples, and had been by us brought on shore under that deception. We accordingly went to
<PB N="31" REF="045437_0363_1020016516D39120"/>
work in making the experiment, and boiled a quantity of the balsam in the iron kettle we had saved, and frequently taking it off the fire to cool, we soon brought it to a proper consistence. A sufficient quantity of it being prepared, we turned up the boat, and having cleaned her bot∣tom, gave her a coat of the balsam, which effec∣tually stopped up all crevices for the present. This done, we got a small sail rigged to a mast, which shipped and unshipped occasionally; and then pitched upon the persons who were to go with me in the boat.</P>
<P>By the 1st of January, with much difficulty and fatigue, we got our boat in tolerable condi∣tion, so that she could swim, without making much water; likewise our mast and sail rigged, in case we should happen to get a fair wind, which we could not often expect on this coast, at the present season of the year; for, during the winter months, it blows almost constantly from west to north-west, which is immediately on the land. We could not expect, therefore, to have much occasion for our sail; nevertheless, it might sometimes be serviceable, and afford some relief to the rowers. We had agreed to take six in the boat, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the captain and mate, two sailors, myself and servant: of the others, none were so far recovered as to be judged equal to the fatigues we might expect in this expedition. Our shoes being all nearly worn out, my em∣ployment, during the whole of the next day, was, to make a kind of mowkisins, or Indian shoes, of canvass. My needle was nothing more than the handle of a pewter spoon, which I had
<PB N="32" REF="045437_0364_1020016793673578"/>
fashioned, as well as I could, for the purpose, and the same canvass supplied me with thread. As soon as I had made twelve pair, which was two for each man in our party, we divided the pro∣visions that remained, into fourteen equal parts, which amounted only to a quarter of a pound of beef <HI>per</HI> day, for six weeks; those who were to stay behind, sharing as much as we who were to go in the boat, notwithstanding the great fa∣tigue which we had every reason to expect. Eve∣ry necessary preliminary being adjusted, we pro∣posed setting off the next day; but the wind blowing fresh at north-west, were obliged to re∣main where we were, till the fourth. By this time, the ice, floating in prodigious quantities on the coast, and in some places collecting, and blocking up the bays, rendered our undertaking extremely hazardous; yet we thought it more adviseable, to face any danger, and to encounter any hardship, than to remain in our present situ∣ation, with a certainty of starving.</P>
<P>In the afternoon of the 4th, the wind moder∣ating, we got our provisions, and whatever little matters might be of service to us, into the boat; and, having taken leave of our companions, sat off on our expedition. Having got about eight miles from the place of our shipwreck, the wind began to increase, and blow very hard at south∣east, which was immediately off the shore. The boat, as well as the oars, being none of the best, we were on the point of being blown out to sea, but by dint of rowing, made shift to get in∣to a deep bay, about a mile a-head, where we
<PB N="33" REF="045437_0365_102001691C7F5960"/>
thought we might pass the night with safety. Having got every thing on shore, we hauled our boat up as high as our strength would permit, so as to prevent the sea from doing her any more damage. This done, we set to work in lighting our fire, and cutting our wood for the night: we likewise cut some pine-branches, the smaller of which served us to lie on, and the larger, in the form of a wigwam, to shelter us from the inclemency of the weather.</P>
<P>The place we had landed on, was a fine sandy beach, with little or no snow on it. Having ob∣served some small pieces of wood cast on shore by the tide, that had formerly been cut with an axe, and a number of long poles scattered along the edge of the bank, which had likewise been cut in the same manner, I thought it likely there might be some inhabitants near at hand; and proposed, as soon as we had taken a little re∣freshment, to go along the beach to a high point of land, at about two miles distance, which was clear of wood, and appeared to be cultivated; thinking from thence we might make some use∣ful discoveries. I accordingly sat out, soon after, with two of the men; and, before we had pro∣ceeded a mile, saw the remains of a shallop, or Newfoundland fishing-boat, almost covered with sand, which seemed to have been set on fire. This gave us hopes of discovering something else to our satisfaction, and we proceeded, as fast as we could, to the point of land. Having gain∣ed the top of it, we descried, to our inexpressible joy, a few houses, about half a mile distant, to∣ward which we directed our course, having no
<PB N="34" REF="045437_0366_1020016CC0633288"/>
doubt but that we should now meet with some relief; but, on coming up to them, found they were only the remains of some old store-houses, which had been built there for the curing of cod-fish; and, to all appearance, had been aban∣doned some years before.</P>
<P>This was a mortifying disappointment to us. We determined, however, to make the most of our discovery; and, observing a number of old casks lying about, in different parts, we searched them, as well as the houses, very minutely, in hopes of finding some provisions; but to no purpose. As we walked along the point, we ga∣thered about a quart of cranberries, some of which we are, preserving the remainder for our companions. Having reconnoitred every part of this point, without any further success, we return∣ed to our boat, and communicating the discove∣ries we made to our companions, gave them their share of the berries we had gathered. Even these discoveries gave us much satisfaction, as they tended to confirm our hopes of finding some inhabitants in the course of our voyage along the coast.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the wind came round to the north-west, and blew with such violence, as to prevent us from proceeding on our voyage. It continued so for two days, when, happening to get up in the middle of the night, I was asto∣nished on observing, while the wind continued blowing as hard as ever, that the sea was entire∣ly without agitation. I immediately awoke the mate, to inform him of this extraordinary phoe∣nomenon: and going down to the beach to∣gether
<PB N="35" REF="045437_0367_10202955205534D8"/>
to know the cause, we found the sea all covered with ice, nothing but a large sheet of it being to be seen for leagues around. This was an alarming circumstance, as it seemed to pre∣clude all possibility of proceeding any farther, and might give us cause even to regret having left our habitations; for, though we were so near, it was impossible to return by land, besides other impediments, on account of the depth of snow, which was impassable, unless with snow-shoes.</P>
<P>The wind continued to blow from the same quarter for two days longer; and at length, on the 9th, it became perfectly calm. Next morn∣ing the wind came round to the south-east, which was directly off the land, and in a short time blew extremely hard, so that by four o'clock in the afternoon, there was not a piece of ice to be seen along the coast, the whole of it being blown out to sea. This was a very pleasing sight to us, as it gave us a prospect of being extricated from our present dreary situation. However, the violence of the wind prevented us from mov∣ing till the 11th of January, when the weather being moderate, and a fine light breeze blowing along the coast, we launched our boat with much difficulty, being greatly reduced in strength, for want of a due degree of nourishment. Hav∣ing got round the clear point of the land, we hoisted our sail and put before the wind.</P>
<P>The weather being very moderate, and little or no sea running, we made tolerable way, and had not proceeded far, before we descried an ex∣tremely high point, about seven leagues a-head,
<PB N="36" REF="045437_0368_10202956A9235F40"/>
with a continued precipice along the coast, so that it was impossible for us to land on any part of it, before we came to that headland. This made it very dangerous to attempt the passage; for if the wind should happen to come round to the north∣west, we must infallibly have perished among the rocks. But danger was no longer an object to be considered by us; so we got out two oars, not being able to use any more, as the boat had been so much damaged, that two men were constantly employed in keeping her clear of water, and, with the assistance of a fair wind, made the point about eleven o'clock at night; but finding no place that we could possibly land on, we were obliged to keep along the coast till two in the morning, when the wind increasing, and a stony beach appearing, on which we should not have thought it expedient to land, had the wind been moderate, we were obliged to put ashore, and immediately got our provisions out of the boat. The beach was of some height from the surface of the water, the sea having beat the gravel up into a kind of bank; which rendered it impossible for us to haul our boat up. We were therefore obliged to leave her to the mercy of the sea.</P>
<P>The place where we landed, was a beach of about four hundred yards in length, bounded at the distance of about fifty yards from the water's edge, by a precipice of at least one hundred feet in height, which inclosed it on all sides. If the wind should come round to the north-west, we knew that we should be entirely deprived of shel∣ter, yet, as it blew too fresh for us to attempt
<PB N="37" REF="045437_0369_102029599D045070"/>
putting to sea again, we were obliged to remain there, notwithstanding these inconveniences.</P>
<P>On the 13th the wind came round to the north-west, and blowing very hard, the sea beat with such violence against the shore, as to drive our boat twenty yards higher than she was, and to beat several holes in her bottom. Now was the time for us to feel all the miseries of our present situation; fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, being surrounded by pre∣cipices, which prevented us from sheltering our∣selves in the woods, and having so little covering, and no firing, but what we collected from some pieces of timber, which floated accidentally upon the shore, we could but just keep ourselves from absolute freezing. The same weather continued for eight days, with a prodigious fall of snow, a circumstance that added to our other incon∣veniences. At length, on the 21st, the weather became more moderate, and the snow ceased, having in the course of this last week, fallen to the depth of three feet, perpendicular. This gave us an opportunity of cooking our provisions, which we had done but once, since our landing. Even this was a great loss to us, as the water that the meat was boiled in, afforded us almost as much nourishment, as the meat itself.</P>
<P>Next day we contrived, with much labour, to turn our boat half way over, in order to examine the damage she had received, which we found considerable; the coat of balsam being entirely rubbed off, and several holes made in her bot∣tom. We expected the ice would go to sea, as it had done once before, whenever the wind should come round to the southward; and
<PB N="38" REF="045437_0370_1020295C8B7CA898"/>
therefore thought, if we could but get our boat repaired, that we might still have some chance of meeting with inhabitants. But the great difficulty was, how to repair it; for we had no pitch or balsam left, and but little dry oakum, which was of no service to us, without the form∣er. After trying various methods, we at last gave it up as a thing entirely impracticable, and began to turn our thoughts toward some other means, of getting out of this bleak and barren place, to search for relief, in an uninhabited country.</P>
<P>Though it was impossible for us, to climb the precipice, by which we were encompassed, yet, if we were determined to abandon our boat, we imagined, that we might easily get into the woods, by walking along shore upon the ice, which still covered the sea, and had strength sufficient to bear any weight. In fact, the mate and I, proposed walking a few miles on it, in order to make the experiment. We accordingly sat out, and had not proceeded far, before we came to the entrance of a river, and a fine sandy beach, where, had our good fortune directed us to land, we might have lived more comfortably, and have preserved our boat. But what was to be done now, that we could get into the woods? We could not think of walking across them, in search of a cultivated country: besides, that we should be entirely ignorant, how to direct our course; the depth of snow, which had, by this time, increased to six feet, in the wood, rendered it impossible for us to travel, without snow-shoes. After consulting together, we at last
<PB N="39" REF="045437_0371_10202961296ED790"/>
came to a resolution, of taking, the next day, what provisions we had, upon our backs, and coasting along the ice, till we could discover some inhabitants; expecting, from its present ap∣pearance of strength, that it would remain for some time longer: and the wind having drifted the greatest part of the snow off it, we compu∣ted that we should be able to walk about ten miles a day, even in our present weak and re∣duced condition.</P>
<P>This being fully resolved, we were to set out the morning of the 24th; but on the night preceding it, the wind came round to the south∣east, and blew hard, attended with snow and rain; so that in the morning, as I already ap∣prehended would be the case, that whole sheet of ice, which the night before looked so firm, was demolished, or driven out to sea. Thus were all our schemes frustrated—neither ice to walk on, nor boat to carry us through the water; not even a possibility of moving from this place, where we were embayed, and sur∣rounded by insurmountable precipices. Thus circumstanced, we were again obliged to turn our thoughts toward some scheme for repairing our boat: upon that our only hope depended. We had plenty of oakum to stop up the holes and seams, but nothing to substitute in the room of pitch, to prevent the water from penetrating. I at length thought of a plan, which I imagined might have the wished-for effect, namely, that of throwing water over the oakum, and letting it freeze into a cake of ice. As soon as day ap∣peared, I resolved to put this scheme to the test,
<PB N="40" REF="045437_0372_101FFC7D312E7FF8"/>
and having cleared the boat of snow and gravel, immediately went to work. The men in gene∣ral made light of my undertaking, and assisted, with much reluctance, thinking that they were throwing away their labour. However, I soon convinced them to the contrary▪ for, by four o'clock in the afternoon, by continually throw∣ing water over the oakum, we froze up every seam and hole, in such a manner, that not a drop of water could enter, as long as the weather con∣tinued freezing, as at present.</P>
<P>On the 27th of January, the weather being moderate, and a light breeze directly off the shore, we got our boat very carefully launched, and sat off early in the morning from this ill-omened bay. We had the pleasure to observe that the boat made little or no water, so that we were enabled to keep our four oars continually at work. As we advanced along the coast, we found it still bordered by nothing but barren pre∣cipices, with every four or five miles perhaps a small sandy beach.</P>
<P>The weather continued very moderate all the day of the 27th, so that, by six o'clock in the e∣vening, we computed that we had rowed about twelve miles from where we departed in the morning. This indeed would be but an indif∣ferent day's work for people in health and vi∣gour, but a great deal for those in our circum∣stances; not only being extremely weakened and reduced, but the boat itself being very heavy and unwieldy, from the quantity of ice in it. We put ashore about six o'clock, upon a small sandy beach, and, by placing oars under our boat,
<PB N="41" REF="045437_0373_1020296418ABB450"/>
dragged her carefully some yards from the water, so that she lay very safe, while the wind continu∣ed as it then was. We next cut some branches, and having made a fire, sheltered ourselves, as well as possible, in the wood. Our tinder being nearly consumed, I was obliged to furnish a fresh supply, by cutting away the back part of my shirt, which I had worn ever since we left the ship.</P>
<P>A shower of rain, the next day, unfortunate∣ly melted all the ice off our boat: we were, therefore, prevented from going any farther, till a return of the frost, and had the mortification to lose the benefit of a fine day, in the course of which, we might have proceeded, with a good boat, several leagues more on our journey. What made the matter worse, was, that our provisions were now reduced to two pounds and a half of beef for each man. On the morning of the 29th, the mate having wandered a little distance from our fire, returned in haste to inform me, that he had discovered a partridge perched on the bough of a tree, which he thought I might possi∣bly devise some method of catching. I imme∣diately went to the place where he had seen it, and found it in the same situation as before. Ob∣serving that the bird was very tame, and not a∣bove fourteen feet from the ground, I cut down a long pole, and taking part of the rope-yarn that fastened my canvass shoes, made a running loop of it, and fixed it to the end of the pole; then walking softly under the tree, and lifting the pole gently up, I fixed the loop about the partridge's neck, and giving it a sudden jerk, closed the loop,
<PB N="42" REF="045437_0374_10202965A3DCF820"/>
and secured the bird. The mate, as well as my∣self, as soon as I had caught it, laughed very heartily, for the first time that either of us had any inclination to smile since our shipwreck. We then went toward the fire with our prize, and boiled it in some melted snow, together with a little salt water, to give the broth a relish: hav∣ing divided it, when dressed, into six equal parts, and cast lots for the choice of each, we sat down to what we found a delicious meal; the only one, excepting the quart of cranberries, for which we were indebted to chance, or providence, since we had been cast upon the island.</P>
<P>On the afternoon of the 29th, it began to freeze hard, when we took the advantage of the frost, to stop the boat's leaks, as before; and the wind still continuing moderate, we launched her, as soon as that business was completed, and put to sea. The day being almost spent, before we sat off, we could not make above seven miles, to a sandy beach and thick wood, which seemed to afford a tolerable shelter. In this place we passed the night; and the next day, the weather being still favorable, we launched our boat betimes in the morning, in order to get, before night, as far as possible on our journey; but we had not pro∣ceeded above six miles, before the wind freshen∣ing up from the south-east, obliged us to put a∣shore, and haul up our boat.</P>
<P>A heavy fall of rain, which continued the whole day, rendered our situation extremely un∣comfortable, and melted again the icy caulking of the boat. We were therefore to console our∣selves, as well as we could, in the certainty of re∣maining
<PB N="43" REF="045437_0375_10202968F0C59498"/>
here till the return of the frost, and mean while, proposed to reconnoitre, as far as our reduced state would allow us, into the coun∣try. In this, however, we were prevented by the quantity of snow which still lay on the ground, and was not yet sufficiently frozen, to bear our weight, without rackets, or snow-shoes. Toward the spring of the year, in these cold climates, they may, for the most part, be dispensed with, when the snow has become more condensed by its own weight, the influence of the sun, and the rains, which began to fall at this season. The frost then returning, after the thaw, forms a kind of incrustation on the surface, that will bear a man's weight, without sinking. Had this season been arrived, we should have abandoned our cra∣zy boat, and, taking the little provision we still possessed, have made an attempt to discover in∣habitants, by a march into the heart of the country; perhaps it was fortunate we could not attempt it, as in all probability, we should have perished in the woods.</P>
<P>Not having it in our power to wander toward any other part, we walked along the shore as far as we were able, and saw nothing that could at∣tract our notice, but some stumps of trees, from which the trunks might have been cut some years before: from this circumstance, we could collect no very sanguine hope of being near an inhabi∣ted country. Soon after, the wind coming round to the north-west, and bringing the frost along with it, we were once more enabled to repair our boat, and to prepare for launching it, as soon as the wind should abate its violence. This hap∣pening,
<PB N="44" REF="045437_0376_1020296D5293D818"/>
in some degree, on the 1st of February, we immediately embarked, and pursued our coasting voyage; but the severity of the cold having formed a quantity of ice, it was with ex∣treme labour that we contrived to get five miles before night, one of our party being employed in breaking the ice with a pole, and clearing it from the bows of the boat.</P>
<P>The following day, the wind blowing fresh from the north-west quarter, prevented us again from proceeding any farther, till the 3d, when, coming round to the west, which is directly along the shore, and the most favourable that could blow for us, we were enabled to embark, and pursue our voyage. Our boat, notwithstanding all our diligence in caulking, made now so much water, that we were obliged to keep one man constantly at work in baling it out with a camp-kettle. The wind, however, was as fair as we could wish, and being neither too slack nor too violent, we, for some time, went at the rate of four miles an hour, with the assistance of our oars; but soon after, the wind increasing, we laid in our oars, and ran under our sail alone, at the rate of about five miles an hour.</P>
<P>After having run above sixteen miles, we dis∣covered an exceeding high land, about six leagues distant, with several other mountains and large bays between us; and, it being yet early in the day, a fine wind, and no great sea, we were in hopes, if the wind should not increase too much, that we should be able to reach it before night. As we proceeded along the coast, we found it in every part high and rocky; which made us very
<PB N="45" REF="045437_0377_1020297048220800"/>
uneasy, lest the wind should rise, before we could make the head-land. About two o'clock in the afternoon, when we supposed we were within three leagues of it, we discovered an island about twenty miles from the main; and, on compar∣ing circumstances, we concluded that the island must be that of St. Paul, and the high land, the north point of Cape Breton. The prodigious height of the land, led us into an erroneous com∣putation of its distance; for, notwithstanding we had supposed that we were within three leagues of it, when we first discovered the island of St. Paul, we found, before we reached it, that we had run near five leagues.</P>
<P>It was almost dark by the time we reached the North Cape; where, finding no place to land, we were obliged to double the Cape, and conti∣nue our journey. The wind now began to freshen, and we had a heavy sea from the north∣east to encounter, as soon as we came opposite to the Cape. After having doubled it, our course lay in a very different direction from what it had been in the morning; so that we were obliged to strike our sail, and take to the oars. The wind, at the same time, blew so hard off the high lands, that it was with the utmost difficulty we could keep along the coast: had we not been as∣sisted by a heavy swell, that came from the north∣east, we must certainly have been blown out to sea.</P>
<P>Finding no place to land during the night, we continued rowing as close as we could to the rocks, till about five in the morning; when, hearing the sea run on the shore very long and
<PB N="46" REF="045437_0378_10202971D2BA20E0"/>
heavy, we imagined that we must be off a sandy beach. We accordingly rowed toward the land, and, at the distance of fifty yards, for it was yet dark, were able to discern a beach at least four miles in length. It was not, however, a conve∣nient place for us to put in, on account of the surf, and a long and heavy sea that rolled on it; yet being so much fatigued with rowing, that we were incapable of proceeding any farther, we were obliged to attempt a landing. This we ef∣fected with more ease than we looked for, and suffered no other inconvenience, but that of hav∣ing our boat nearly filled with water on the beach. Having landed, our first care was to haul up the boat, that she might meet with no further da∣mage from the sea. We then got into the woods, which lay close to the shore; and, as I had taken the precaution to put our tinder-box in my bo∣som, before we landed, to preserve it from the water, we contrived to kindle a fire; a refresh∣ment we had much occasion for, having got wet in landing, and being in so weak and reduced a condition, that it was with the greatest difficulty we could keep ourselves awake for a few minutes, when before the fire; so that we were under the necessity of watching in turn, lest, all being asleep together, the fire should go out, and we should be frozen to death. Having now time to consi∣der every circumstance, and finding, as soon as day-light appeared, that the land still continued to have an opposite bearing to that on the other side of the point, we had no doubt remaining, but that we were upon the north cape of the island of Breton, which, together with Cape
<PB N="47" REF="045437_0379_10202974B9AB0020"/>
Roy, on the island of Newfoundland, marks the entrance of the gulph of St. Lawrence.</P>
<P>Our provisions were now entirely consumed, and having not the most distant prospect of get∣ting any more, we were ready to abandon our∣selves to despair. As we were certain of being on an inhabited island, we might have flattered ourselves with the hopes of getting relief, by persevering in our dilatory progress, had we wherewithal to provide for our immediate sub∣sistence. Having weighed the necessity of the case, and the misery of perishing by hunger, I was of opinion, as well as the mate, that it would be most adviseable to sacrifice one, for the preservation of the rest; and that the most pro∣per method would be, by casting lots, which should be the unfortunate victim. But this shocking, though prudent, resolution, we agreed to put off to the last extremity.</P>
<P>We had not been able to secure our boat so effectually, but that the sea had beat her higher up on the beach, and filled her with sand. We were obliged, therefore, to set two of the men to work in clearing her, and afterwards in stopping the leaks, as already described; while the re∣mainder of our party was detached by different routes along the shore, to see if they could find any kind of provision. The mate and myself travelled along the sandy beach, till we were pre∣vented from going any farther, by an inlet of wa∣ter, when we were a good deal surprised, to ob∣serve the tide ebb and flow every ten minutes. We were not, however, at present, in a disposi∣tion to pay much regard to this or any other ex∣traordinary
<PB N="48" REF="045437_0380_102029791D0A5F38"/>
appearance of nature; and seeing a great quantity of oyster-shells lying upon the shore, we searched them diligently, in hopes of finding some that were full; but without suc∣cess. This again made us curse our destiny, that we should have been cast away on so barren and miserable a country, and in such an unluc∣ky time of the year, when we were not only de∣prived of the relief we might have got, at any other season, from the natural productions of the earth, but when even the animals, inhabitants of both elements, had retired to their holes and hi∣ding places, to shield themselves from the intense cold which prevails during the winter, in this in∣hospitable climate.</P>
<P>We still continued our search, notwithstand∣ing the ill success we had hitherto experienced, and contrived, at length, to gather about two quarts of hips, or wild rose-buds, by throwing up the snow, and searching in different parts of the bank. Having, with this sorry food, allayed, in some degree, the keen sense of hunger, and the wind having become somewhat more moder∣ate, we got into our boat, and pushed off, the day being already drawing toward a conclusion. Our progress was, however, soon impeded by the quantity of ice that floated upon the water; which obliged us to put ashore on another part of the same beach. In landing, I had the mis∣fortune to let the tinder-box fall from my bosom into the water, by which means we were unable to kindle a fire; and being exceedingly wet, as was generally the case, when we landed, we were, in this place, in a most uncomfortable situ∣ation,
<PB N="49" REF="045437_0381_1020297C4E8C03A8"/>
and suffered much from the cold. We therefore, thought it best to get into our boat a∣gain as fast as possible, and return to the spot from whence we came, in hopes of finding some fire still remaining.</P>
<P>It was with the greatest difficulty we got back, being the whole way under the necessity of breaking through the ice, which had, by this time, formed almost into a solid sheet. We were very anxious, lest our fire should mean∣while, have gone out, and thought it a lucky circumstance, we had not been able to go any farther from it. On our arrival at the place, we had the satisfaction to find, it was not totally extinguished: had this been the case, we must have perished in the course of the night. The fire being repaired, I cut up the remainder of my shirt to make some more tinder; and, as the damage it got had nearly proved fatal to us, was resolved to be more particular in my care of it for the future.</P>
<P>On the 8th of February, the wind came round to the south-west, which cleared off the ice, and enabled us to leave this place by ten o'clock in the morning. As we proceeded a∣long the shore, we found it was not quite so rocky as it had been on the other side of the north cape. We were therefore able to land this night, without difficulty, within a large rock, by which we were sheltered from the wind and sea. We were here very comfortably situ∣ated, in every respect, except our want of provi∣sions. The next day, the weather continuing moderate, we had again proceeded about eight
<PB N="50" REF="045437_0382_1020297DD786E360"/>
miles on our journey, when the wind beginning to blow so hard as to raise a considerable swell, we were obliged to steer to the snore; and in landing, had the misfortune to lose two of our oars, which were washed overboard by the surf.</P>
<P>On the following day, the wind lulled; and we immediately took the advantage of it, to put to sea. We had now but two oars remaining; which being double-manned, we contrived to get about six miles before night. This was a very hard day's work, considering our present weak condition; for, having been a length of time without tasting any kind of nourishment, we were so much reduced in strength, that when we got on shore, we could scarcely walk for fifty yards together.</P>
<P>The weather being unfavourable on the 11th, we were under the necessity of remaining the whole day in the same resting-place; and, hav∣ing leisure to search about the shore, we were fortunate enough to find a few rose-buds, which we esteemed at present a great delicacy. Had we not met with this supply, it would have been absolutely requisite to put our beforementioned scheme into execution. We thought ourselves extremely unlucky, in not having found, in the course of our wanderings, so much as the body of any dead animal: nor, except the partridge, did we see any live one, that we had the smallest chance of capturing. At different times, we had hopes of catching some of the others that we frequently saw on the ice, particularly on the small rivers and inlets: but we never found them at any distance from the holes, which they
<PB N="51" REF="045437_0383_102029810079A888"/>
continually kept open, to give themselves a free passage in and out of the water. We likewise discovered, at different times, some beaver's houses; but could not insnare any of the ani∣mals.</P>
<P>On the 12th, the wind became moderate, and we proceeded, once more, on our journey. The coast seemed to diminish in height as we passed along it, which made us hope we were now ap∣proaching the cultivated part of the island. Next day the weather got milder, with a fall of rain: so that it was with difficulty we could get our boat to swim, the ice thawing gradually off the bottom. This obliged us to put ashore long be∣fore night; and when we had landed, and made a fire, we found no other immediate want but that of provisions, having consumed all the hips or rose-buds that we had gathered at our last landing-place.</P>
<P>Having reconnoitred, very carefully, all around, and searched in every part under the snow, we were not able to procure ourselves even that mi∣serable sustenance. Being now driven to the last extremity, we were obliged to sacrifice our pro∣spect of travelling any farther, to the immediate preservation of our lives. About a dozen tal∣low candles remained, which we had hitherto employed in stopping the leaks of our boat, as fast as she sprung one in any particular place. Of these we divided a small part among us; which gave us some relief for the present. The two following days we coasted for a few miles, search∣ing for a place where we could meet with some hips; but our search proved ineffectual. This
<PB N="52" REF="045437_0384_1020298550C7F5A0"/>
was the only kind of food we could now expect; and had we discovered any place that abounded with them, it was our intention to draw up the boat there, and remain till they were consum∣ed.</P>
<P>We began now to be fully sensible of our des∣perate situation, and to expect that our fate would be that of perishing with hunger. Notwith∣standing that idea was horrid enough, yet, what gave me the most uneasiness, was, that my friends would probably forever remain uninformed of our wretched catastrophe. It may appear to those, who have not been in similar circum∣stances, that this would take up but a small part of one's reflection, in comparison with the dread of such a death; yet, however it might have been with the rest of my companions, it was that idea that chiefly preyed upon my spirits. In or∣der to prevent it, as far as possible, I took every occasion of cutting out my name on the bark of the largest trees. The fatigue of cutting it, as well as the preservation of my knife, which I observed before, was the only one among us, would not allow me to be more particular. But on the walls of the store-houses, which we had discovered in the beginning of our progress, I wrote a short account of our disasters in English and French, and requested, if any person should fall in with it, that they would transmit it to my father at Quebec.</P>
<P>On the 17th, we made another division of a part of the tallow candles that yet remained; and on the following day, the wind being fa∣vourable, we proceeded about five miles: where,
<PB N="53" REF="045437_0385_1020298847E30330"/>
finding a flat country, and a sandy beach, that extended for a considerable way, and being so much debilitated, that we knew it would be im∣possible for us to go much farther, we put on shore, with a determined resolution to perish on this place, unless some unforeseen accident should bring us relief. To attempt drawing up our boat, would, in our present weak condition, be a vain undertaking, so we were obliged to leave her, exposed to the mercy of the sea. All that we could preserve was our axe, a saw, and the sail of the boat, which we generally made use of as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>covering.</P>
<P>As soon as we landed, we made it our busi∣ness to clear away the snow from a particular spot in the entrance of the wood, where we in∣tended to remain; and having cut some small branches of pine to lie upon, together with some larger to serve for a shelter, which we stuck into the bank of snow that surrounded us, we made our fire. This done, we all went in search of hips, and had the good fortune to find about a pint of them, which, boiled up with a couple of tallow candles, afforded us a tolerable meal.</P>
<P>The next day we passed without any kind of provisions, and being apprehensive that our little remaining strength would soon desert us, we em∣ployed ourselves in cutting and piling as much wood as we were able, to supply the fire. Mean while, the waves had beat our boat so high upon the beach, as to be quite dry as soon as the wind subsided, and to deprive us of the power of put∣ting to sea again: had we been disposed to do it:
<PB N="54" REF="045437_0386_101FFC7A52A354F0"/>
for our strength was by no means equal to the task of moving her a single foot.</P>
<P>We again employed the whole day of the 19th in search of hips; but it was not attended with any success. Our tallow candles were, there∣fore, the only resource we had left, and by this time they became reduced to two. We found ourselves so much weakened the following day, that we could make no further use of our axe, and were under the necessity of creeping about in our turns, to gather for our fire the rotten branches of trees, that lay scattered upon the ground. As we had not a proper quantity of fuel, the fire that we kept up was but just suffi∣cient to preserve us from freezing: for, though the season was so far advanced toward the spring, yet, excepting some particular days, the weather was as cold as in the month of December.</P>
<P>Having now no more than two tallow candles remaining, and finding no longer a possibility of gathering any hips, being too weak even to search for them, we thought it likely that we might de∣rive some degree of nourishment from the kelp-weed, of which there was a quantity lying upon the shore. We accordingly collected a little of it, and with melted snow boiled it for a few hours in a kettle; but, at the conclusion, found it very little tenderer than at first. We then melted one of our tallow candles in the liquor, and having supped it up, and eat a quantity of the weed, our appetite became somewhat satia∣ted: but in about two hours time, we were all affected with a very uneasy sensation, and were soon after seized with a fit of vomiting, without
<PB N="55" REF="045437_0387_1020298CC346D248"/>
being able to bring the offending matter entirely off the stomach. This fit of vomiting having continued for about four hours, we found our∣selves tolerably easy, but, at the same time, ex∣ceedingly exhausted.</P>
<P>On the 22d we made use of some more kelp-weed and our last tallow candle. It still opera∣ted in the same manner, but not to so violent a degree as it had done before. The next day the wind blew very moderate from the north-west, and brought a severe frost along with it. We had now an opportunity to repair our boat; and, if our strength had been sufficient to launch into the water, we should have changed our resolu∣tion, and have quitted the place. We made, in∣deed, a faint attempt to launch the boat; but, on finding that we could not move her an inch from where she lay upon the shore, we were o∣bliged to give over the design. Our candles be∣ing all consumed, we were under the necessity of boiling the kelp-weed, without the mixture of tallow, which, however nauseous at any other time, afforded us, then, not only some kind of nourishment, but even an exquisite relish.</P>
<P>Having, for three days, tasted no other food but the kelp-weed, we began to swell to an alarming degree. This we were at a loss whe∣ther to attribute to the kelp-weed, or to the cold (for we were not able to keep a sufficient fire): however, I thought then, and do still believe, that it proceeded from the former; for, notwith∣standing we had often before been exposed to the utmost severity of the frost, and sometimes with∣out any shelter whatever, yet we had never found
<PB N="56" REF="045437_0388_102029911FDF0308"/>
ourselves affected with this extraordinary symp∣tom; but, on the contrary, were as much redu∣ced in bulk as we were in strength: whereas in a few days, the swelling had increased to such a degree all over our bodies, that, notwithstanding the little flesh we had upon our bones, we could sink our fingers two inches deep on the skin; the impression of which remained visible for a∣bove an hour after. Hunger, nevertheless, still obliged us to make use of the kelp-weed. I have never since consulted with any naturalist or phy∣sician about the extraordinary effects of this weed; yet doubt not but they may be accounted for from natural causes.</P>
<P>We passed a few days more in the same man∣ner; at the expiration of which, we were so much swollen, as to be almost deprived of our sight, and so reduced in strength, that it was with the utmost difficulty we could keep our fire in by crawling about in turn, and breaking the rotten branches that lay scattered upon the snow. The time was now arrived, when I thought it highly expedient to put the plan beforemention∣ed into execution; but, on feeling the pulse of my companions, found, that some of them were rather averse to the proposal; the desire of life still prevailing above every other sentiment, not∣withstanding the wretched condition they were in, and the impossibility even of preserving it by any other method.</P>
<P>I thought it an extraordinary instance of in∣fatuation, that men should prefer the certainty of a lingering and miserable death, to the distant chance of one more immediate and less painful.
<PB N="57" REF="045437_0389_102029941B552588"/>
However, on consulting with the mate, what was to be done, I found, that, though they objected to the proposal of casting lots which should be the victim, yet, all concurred, in the necessity of some one being sacrificed for the preservation of the rest. The only question was, how it should be determined; when, by a kind of reasoning more agreeable to the dictates of self-love than of justice, it was agreed on, that, as the captain was now so exceedingly reduced, as to be evidently the first who would sink under our present com∣plicated misery; as he had been the person to whom we considered ourselves, in some mea∣sure, indebted for all our misfortunes; and fur∣ther, as he had, ever since our shipwreck, been the most remiss in his exertions towards the ge∣neral good, he was, undoubtedly, the person who should be the first sacrificed.</P>
<P>I must confess, that I thought, at that time, there was some colour of truth in this conclusi∣on: yet, I was not a little shocked at the cap∣tain's intended fate, although I had more reason than any one else to be incensed against him, not only on account of his neglect of duty, and his mal-practices at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut in purloining our provi∣sions, but for another reason likewise. After our shipwreck, I had discovered, by some papers, which had been washed on shore, that, though the captain's pretended destination was to New-York, yet his real one was to the West-Indies, if he could possibly effect it Thus would he have baffled General Haldimand's intentions, in sending me with dispatches, that might be of the
<PB N="58" REF="045437_0390_10202995A7017558"/>
first consequence to this country; and not only have disappointed, but also have defrauded me of the money which I paid him for my passage.</P>
<P>The determination now made, was kept secret from the captain; and it would have been im∣possible for us to live many days longer, without putting it into execution, had we not happily met with relief from a quarter whence we little expected it. On the 28th of February, as we were all lying about our fire, we thought that we heard the sound of human voices in the woods; and soon after discovered two Indians, with guns in their hands, who did not seem yet to have perceived us. This sight gave us fresh strength and spirits: so, getting up, we advanced towards them with the greatest eagerness imagi∣nable.</P>
<P>As soon as we were perceived by the Indians, they started back, and seemed fixed for a few moments to the ground with surprise and horror. This, indeed, is not to be wondered at, when it is considered, that, besides the amazement they must naturally have felt, on suddenly meeting with white men in this uninhabited part of the island, our appearance itself, was enough to alarm the most intrepid: our cloaths being almost en∣tirely burnt off, so that we were bare in several parts of our bodies, our limbs swollen to a pro∣digious bulk, our eyes, from the same cause, al∣most invisible, and our hair in a confused and dishevelled state about our heads and shoulders, particularly of those who wore it long; for we had not been able to comb it since our shipwreck. As we advanced toward the Indians, some of us

wept, while others laughed through joy. Being a little recovered from their surprise, they did not shew much inclination to accost us, till I got up to one of them, and took him by the hand; when he shook it for some time very heartily; the usual mode of salutation among the Indi∣ans.</P>
<P>They began, at length, to shew marks of com∣passion at our distressed appearance; and I ima∣gine, their shyness at first proceeded from the re∣pugnance which it naturally inspired: for, these Indians being converted to Christianity, I will not attribute it to a motive so contrary to that doctrine, as the idea of the trouble they might expect, without any compensation, in relieving us. They then walked with us to our fire, and, sitting down by it together, one of them, who could speak a little broken French, desired we would inform him whence we came, and the particulars of the accident that brought us there. I accordingly gave him as concise an account as possible, of the disasters and fatigues we had un∣dergone: during the relation, he seemed to be very much affected at our sufferings.</P>
<P>Having finished my narration, I asked the In∣dian, if he could furnish us with any kind of provisions: to which he answered in the affir∣mative. Observing that we had very little fire, he suddenly started up, and took our axe in his hand; when, looking at it, and laughing hearti∣ly, I suppose at the badness of it, he threw it down again, and taking his tomahawk from his side, which is a small hatchet that the Indians al∣ways carry about them, he went, and, in a short
<PB N="60" REF="045437_0392_10202AA2CB0D9AE8"/>
time, cut a quantity of wood, which he brought, and threw upon our fire. This done, he took up his gun, and, without saying a word, went off with his companion.</P>
<P>This would have been a very alarming cir∣cumstance to persons ignorant of the Indian manners; but I was so well acquainted with the humour of these people, who seldom speak when there is not an absolute occasion for it, that I doubted not, but they were gone for some provi∣sions, and that we should see them again very shortly. Notwithstanding the length of time we had been without nourishment, I must con∣fess, that I felt but little inclination to eat: the fire which the Indian had made, was the great∣est refreshment to us, as we had been many days without a good one.</P>
<P>After about three days had elapsed, during which interval, some of our party were not without anxiety, lest the Indians should never return, we perceived them coming round a point, at a small distance, in a bark canoe. Being ar∣rived, and landed upon the beach, they took out of their canoe some smoked venison, and a blad∣der of seal oil; which they brought up to our fire-place: having put some of the meat into our kettle, they boiled it in melted snow; and then gave each of us a very small quantity of it, together with some oil. I knew very well their reason for being so sparing of their meat; for, eating a quantity of gross food in our present state, might be attended with the most fatal con∣sequences. It gave me no small pleasure to find that the Indians were so careful of us.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="045437_0393_101FFC8F0F40F7E0"/>
This light repast being ended, the Indians de∣sired three of us to embark in their canoe, that being all she could carry at a time, and proceed from this place to their hut, which lay five miles farther by water, and about a mile from the shore, in the middle of the woods. We were received at the sea side by three other Indians, and about twelve or fourteen women and chil∣dren, who had been there waiting our arrival. Having landed from the canoe, we were conduc∣ted by these last to their habitation in the wood, which consisted of three huts or wigwams, there being that number of families among them: meanwhile, the same two Indians who had brought us, went back in their canoe for the three re∣maining men of our party. On arriving at the but, we were treated, with the greatest humanity by these people; they gave us some broth to sup, but would not suffer us to eat meat, or any kind of substantial food whatever.</P>
<P>The two Indians being come back with our companions, and having all received a tolerable refreshment I was desired, at the request of a very old woman, who appeared to be mistress or mother of the families present, to give them an account of our transactions since the day of our shipwreck. I accordingly gave a more particular account, than I had done before in French to the Indian, whom I have already mentioned; and he explained it in his own language to the other Indians. In the course of my relation, I could perceive that the old woman was exceedingly affected, at certain parts of it; which gave me much satisfaction, as I thence derived hopes,
<PB N="62" REF="045437_0394_101FFC90AD1C7258"/>
that they would continue, to treat us with the same humanity. As soon as I had done speaking. the old woman rose up, and after supplying us with some more broth, desired the interpreter to explain to us, the shipwreck of the famous French partisan St. Luc Lacorne, on his passage from Canada to France.</P>
<P>He informed me, that this gentleman, of whose shipwreck I had already heard something, was cast away directly upon the North-Cape; that a great number of persons, perished on the occasion, amongst whom, were two of Mr. St. Luc's children, who were drowned in his arms, as he was attempting to carry them on shore. He likewise informed me, that after his having remained five days there, and suffered much from cold and hunger, he himself had relieved him, and conducted him to Louisbourg; for which service, he said, Mr. St. Luc was indebted to him thirty pounds, which he promised to remit from Halifax, but had never performed it. Whether this part of the Indian's story be true or not, it is impossible for me to determine: the gentleman himself, is best acquainted with it. But this I am certain of, that the poor Indians must have earned the money very dearly, in con∣ducting him so far, at the season of the year in which the journey was performed.</P>
<P>These people did every thing in their power, to reduce the swelling from our limbs; which they at length accomplished, after much diffi∣culty. Having provided for our own immediate wants, our thoughts recurred to those unfortu∣nate men, whom we had left by the wreck. We
<PB N="63" REF="045437_0395_101FFC942C7D86C0"/>
were under much anxiety for them, lest by this time they might have perished with hunger. However, in case they should be still alive, I was determined, no means should be omitted for their preservation; and, having described to the Indi∣ans the part of the island we were cast away upon, asked them, if it was possible to go to their relief?</P>
<P>From the description I gave the Indians of the situation of the river, and of a small island that lay nearly opposite, they said, that they knew the place perfectly well; that it was above one hundred miles distant, through very difficult paths, over rivers and mountains; and that, if they undertook the journey, they must expect some compensation for their trouble. This in∣deed was but reasonable: for it could not be ex∣pected, that the Indians should leave their hunt∣ing, by which alone they subsisted their wives and families, to undergo a fatigue of that kind through pure benevolence: and as to their ac∣count of the distance, I could easily give credit to it, as I knew we had come above one hun∣dred and fifty miles by water. I then informed them, for the first time, for in fact it did not oc∣cur to me before, that I had some money, and that, if it would be any object to them, I would pay them for their trouble. They seemed much pleased when I told them that I had money, and desired me to let them look at it. Then taking the purse from my servant, I shewed them the hundred and eighty guineas that it contained; and observing an eagerness in their countenances at the sight of the coin, which I had little ex∣pected
<PB N="64" REF="045437_0396_101FFC97984DA630"/>
among Indians, and that the women, in particular, seemed to have taken a strong fancy to it, I presented them with a guinea each; for which they expressed their satisfaction, by laugh∣ing, the only method among the savages of dis∣playing every sentiment of that nature.</P>
<P>However, I was determined, at all events, to save the people, if any of them remained alive, though the Indians should be ever so exorbitant in their demands; and made an agreement with them, at last, that they should set off the next day, which was the second of March, and that they should receive twenty-five guineas at their departure, and the same sum on their return. This being adjusted, they immediately went to work in making a proper number of mawkisins and snow-shoes, for themselves and for the men; and three of them went off the next morning, having received the sum of money agreed for.</P>
<P>After these people knew that I had money, my situation among them was not near so comfort∣able as before; for they became as mercenary as they had hitherto been charitable, and exacted above ten times the value, for every little neces∣sary they furnished for myself and the rest of my companions. Besides which, I was under con∣stant apprehension, lest they should be incited, by this extraordinary passion for money, to plunder us, and leave us in the same destitute condition in which they found us. The only circum∣stance, on which I founded my hope of better treatment from them, was their religion: for, as I mentioned before, they were Christians, and rigid Catholics, having been converted by the
<PB N="65" REF="045437_0397_101FFC9920431FF0"/>
French, before we got possession of the island. But, perhaps, it was this very circumstance of their communication with Christians, that had inspired them with that vehement love of money. They shewed, indeed, every mark of attachment to their faith, being very assiduous at their devo∣tions both night and morning; and frequently gave us cause to wish they had not been quite so devout, by disturbing us with their psalm-singing the whole night. I was very much afraid, at times, if they had learnt that tenet of their sect, of keeping no faith with heretics, that their profession of Christianity would be of little service to us. My servant, being an Irish Ca∣tholic, they were exceedingly fond of him, and heaped their favours upon him very profusely. He joined them, for the most part, in their roar∣ing, for I cannot, with propriety, call it singing, and in their prayers; though he did not under∣stand a word of either. Indeed, I question much whether they themselves understood them, for they were the most confused jargon I ever heard, compounded of their own and the French lan∣guage, with the mixture of a few broken Latin phrases, which they had picked up from their converters, the Jesuits.</P>
<P>These insular savages bore, in general, an ex∣act resemblance, in their persons and manners, to those on the continent of America. The principal points in which they differed were, in having their hair long, which is peculiar to the women alone among the continental Indians, and in wearing caps and breeches. Their lan∣guage was very different from that of those na∣tions,
<PB N="66" REF="045437_0398_1020299CE47CC260"/>
or tribes, which I was acquainted with; though I doubt not but it might have a resem∣blance to some other upon the continent. I found afterwards, when we got into a part of the island where it was to be had, that they had the same strong propensity to spirituous liquor, so universal among the Indians.</P>
<P>It was some time before we had recovered any degree of strength, or could digest any substantial food: The only kind we could get from the Indians, was the flesh of moose-deer, and seal oil; on which they subsist entirely, during the time of hunting. Notwithstanding that we found ourselves, after our late miseries, pretty comfortably situated among those savages, yet I was anxious to get away, on account of the dis∣patches I was charged with, which I thought might be of the utmost consequence to his ma∣jesty's service; particularly, as I knew that the duplicates were lost. I continued, however, in so weak a condition, that it was impossible for me to move for some time; and found, as well as my fellow sufferers, that such a shock to the constitution, was not easily to be repaired.</P>
<P>After being absent near a fortnight, the Indi∣ans arrived with three men, who were the only survivors of the eight, who had been left behind at the hut. They were in a very reduced and miserable condition, and informed me, on en∣quiring the particulars of their transactions from the time we left them, that, after having con∣sumed all the beef, they lived, for some days, on the skin of the moose-deer, which we had left entire, not thinking it worth while to make a
<PB N="67" REF="045437_0399_1020299FDD364D50"/>
partition of it. This being consumed, three of them died, in a few days, of hunger, and the o∣thers, were under the necessity of subsisting on the flesh of the dead men, till they were relieved by the Indians. One of the remaining five was so imprudently ravenous, when the Indians came to their assistance, as to eat such a quantity of meat, that he expired in a few hours, in the greatest agonies imaginable; and another, soon after, shot himself, accidentally, with one of the Indian's guns. Thus was our number, which originally consisted of nineteen persons, reduced to nine; and I rather wonder, how so many persons could, for the space of three months, go through such complicated distresses, from exces∣sive cold, fatigue, and hunger.</P>
<P>We all remained another fortnight among the Indians, during which, I was obliged to pay, as before, a most exorbitant price for our diet, and for every necessary that we were provided with. By this time, my health being somewhat re-established, and my money, at the same time, very much reduced, I was resolved to postpone my own convenience, to the good of the service, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o proceed, as fast as possible, with General Haldimand's dispatches, though it was now the most unfavourable season of the year for travel∣ling. I therefore made an agreement with the In∣dians, to conduct me to Halifax; for which I was to pay them forty-five pounds, and to fur∣nish them with provisions, and all necessaries, at every inhabited place, on our way.</P>
<P>It was settled, that I should depart on the 2d of April, with two Indians, for Halifax, accom∣panied
<PB N="68" REF="045437_0400_102029A167F15F50"/>
by Mr. Winslow, a young gentleman who had been a passenger on board the vessel, and was one of the three survivors at the hut, together with my own servant. The Indians were to conduct the remainder of our party, to a set∣tlement on Spanish river, about fifty miles dis∣tant, where they were to remain till the spring, when an opportunity might offer for them to get by sea to Halifax. Previously to parting, I gave the captain cash for a bill on his owner at New-York, to provide for the immediate subsistence of himself and the sailors; which bill was af∣terwards protested by the owner, on the pretence, that the ship being lost, neither master nor crew were entitled to any wages.</P>
<P>We accordingly sat off on the day appointed, each carrying four pair of Indian shoes, or maw∣kisins, a pair of snow-shoes, and provisions for fifteen days. The same day, we got to a place called, by the English, Broad-Oar, where we were detained, the following day, by a snow∣storm. On the 4th, we again proceeded through the woods about five leagues; and, on the 5th, arrived at a place named Broad-Deck, which lies at the entrance of a very fine salt water lake, called Lake St. Peter. This lake communicates, by a narrow inlet, with the sea, from which it is distant about sixteen leagues. At this place, we met with two families of Indians, who were hunting there, and purchased of them a bark-canoe, for five pounds; the Indians having in∣formed me, that some parts of this great lake are never frozen, and that it was requisite to have a canoe to pass over those places; and as
<PB N="69" REF="045437_0401_102029A45659D510"/>
we were to travel over the ice in other parts of it, I was obliged to purchase two Indian sleighs, in which we were to place the canoe, and drag it after us.</P>
<P>Having remained two days in this place, and provided ourselves with a few other necessary ar∣ticles, we proceeded on the 7th, for a few miles along the lake; but the ice being bad, we were soon obliged to take to the wood. A thaw com∣ing on soon after, with rain, made the snow, which lay to the depth of six feet in the woods, so soft and heavy, that we could travel no long∣er on our snow-shoes, the snow sticking to them in large quantities. We were therefore obliged to make a fire, and remain here; and the thaw continuing for the space of four days, made us very apprehensive lest the ice should give way al∣together: for the spring was now too far advan∣ced, to travel any longer upon the snow, unless during a frost. We should then have been un∣der the necessity of waiting till the ice was en∣tirely cleared off the lake; which would have taken at least a fortnight or three weeks from the time of its breaking up; in which case, we might have been reduced to a condition, equally distressed, with that we had been in after our shipwreck, except that we were provided with arms and ammunition.</P>
<P>However, the frost returned on the 12th, and the next day we sat off, and travelled about six leagues; sometimes on floating pieces of ice, and at others, in our canoe, where the lake was open. On the 14th, our provisions being nearly ex∣hausted, I proposed going in search of some
<PB N="70" REF="045437_0402_102029A8A4EF0848"/>
game, as the country abounded with deer: for the Indians, in general, never think of provid∣ing for the next day's wants, but eat on, without reflection, whilst they have a morsel of food re∣maining. I accordingly went with one of the Indians into the woods. We had not been three hours on the hunt, before we discovered a very fine moose-deer; and the Indian shot him in a∣bout an hour after. We skinned this animal, which weighed about six hundred pounds, load∣ed ourselves with some of the best parts of its flesh, as well as the blood, which the Indian took care to collect, putting it in the bladder of the beast: and returned to our canoe. We then sent the other Indian, Mr. Winslow, and my servant, for some more of the meat, of which they brought about an hundred pounds.</P>
<P>Being now well stocked with provisions, we had no reason to apprehend that we should want, in case a return of mild weather should render it impossible for us to travel either upon the lake or in the woods. On the 15th, we sat out ve∣ry early in the morning, and pursued our jour∣ney about six leagues, in the same manner as be∣fore. The greatest inconvenience that we felt, was the want of bread, which the Indians of this country never make use of whilst they are hunt∣ing; and being now much wearied with travel∣ling, our strength having been greatly exhausted by our past fatigues, we agreed to make a halt for a day or two, in the woods. What renders the travelling through the woods, in these cold climates, more tolerable than might be supposed during the winter season, is the number of pine-trees,
<PB N="71" REF="045437_0403_102029AA304160D8"/>
and other ever-greens, which are intersper∣sed in different parts; the branches of which serve, not only to lie upon, but also as a shelter from the severity of the weather. We chose a spot abounding with these trees; and it is almost inconceivable, in how short a time the Indians made us a comfortable habitation of the boughs, called in their language, a <HI>wigwam.</HI> Their method of constructing them is as follows; having chosen the spot for their fire, they first clear off the snow, throwing it up into a bank in a circular form, leaving a vacant space, or pas∣sage, to leeward: and it is to be observed, that the more snow there is on the ground the bet∣ter, as it makes the best part of the shelter. They then cut branches of pines, of a proper length, and placing the thicker ends of them in the bank of snow, bend and interweave them to∣ward the top. These branches are crossed by others, and interwoven with smaller ones, in such a manner, as to afford a sufficient shelter from the wind, and from the fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing snow. The fire is made in the middle of the wigwam, and the smoke of it goes out by the passage to lee∣ward. The wigwams thus made, are very comfortable, even in the coldest weather, and are proof against any thing but a heavy rain; beside which, a change of wind is the only in∣convenience they are liable to.</P>
<P>We proceeded again on our journey, on the 18th, and, during that and the following day, travelled several miles, without meeting with any thing remarkable. I had now leisure to observe the beauties of this lake, which was one of the
<PB N="72" REF="045437_0404_102029AD78328D08"/>
finest I ever saw in America; though at this sea∣son of the year, it could not appear to the best advantage. As far as I could judge, it is about twenty leagues in length from north to south, and eight wide from east to west. A number of small islands are scattered about in different parts of it, and give it somewhat the appearance of the lake of Killarny, and other fresh-water lakes in Ireland. These islands have never been settled on: yet appear to be very fruitful, and must be a most delightful residence in sum∣mer, except for the want of fresh water; which, perhaps, may be the reason they have never been inhabited. Had the lake been properly frozen, we might have saved ourselves the trouble of travelling several leagues, by crossing over from point to point, and from one island to another: but, this not being the case, we were obliged to travel round the greatest part of the bays on one side of it.</P>
<P>On the 20th, we arrived at a place called St. Peter's, where there are four or five French and English families settled. I was here received very politely, and entertained at the house of a Mr. Cavanaugh, a merchant, who was so good as to take my draught for two hundred pounds upon my father, though I was a perfect stranger to him. To this harbour vessels of the greatest burthen can come with safety, and a considera∣ble fishery was formerly carried on here, till, on the breaking out of the present war, the Ame∣rican privateers put a stop to it. The force of these privateers, even taken collectively, is but trifling; and it is much to be regretted, that go∣vernment
<PB N="73" REF="045437_0405_102029B1ED0AB360"/>
cannot spare a vessel or two of force, to cruize about here, and protect the fisheries; which, together with some other branches of trade, might be carried on with as much vigour, and much more benefit, than before the war. This Mr. Cavanaugh, but a short time before I arrived, was plundered, to the amount of three thousand pounds, by two privateers from Boston; who came in at their leisure, and took what they wanted out of his stores. These American pri∣vateers have likewise driven all the settlers away from Louisburg, who had also subsisted by the fishery; and it is somewhat remarkable, that this place, which was, during the two last wars, such a bone of contention between us and the French, has not, at the present moment, so much as a single inhabitant.</P>
<P>I should have taken a shallop or fishing-boat from this place, and gone to Halifax by sea, but that there was almost a certainty of being taken by some privateer along the coast. This lake, St. Peter, is but half a mile from the ocean; to which, we were to carry our canoe through the woods, and to proceed, by water, to the gut of Canceau. While the French were in possession of the island, they had formed a design of cutting through this narrow neck of land, and opening a communication on that side, between the ocean and the lake, in order to bring in their large ships of war, to lie during the winter, in the lake of St. Peter; for there is a sufficient depth of water in the harbour of St. Peter, for the largest ships of the line to ride in, though there is not water enough in the inlet, by which the
<PB N="74" REF="045437_0406_102029B37B510730"/>
lake communicates with the ocean, to enable them to pass up to the harbour.</P>
<P>After stocking ourselves, therefore, with as much provisions, and other necessaries, as we had occasion for, we sat off, on the 22d, in our bark canoe, and arrived the same day at a place called by the French, Grand Grave; where there is a family or two of that nation. The wind blow∣ing hard, we were obliged to remain here all night; and, on the 23d, proceeded along the coast to a settlement called Discousse, where we were detained another day, by some floating ice.</P>
<P>On the 25th, we got to a place called Nar∣rashoc; where we were as hospitably entertai∣ned as we had been at St. Peter's. I here ex∣changed the remains of my regimental coat, for a brown suit of clothes, intending to pass for the master of the ship, in case I should happen to be taken by any of the American privateers at Canceau; and as the inhabitants of this place gave me to understand, that the people of Can∣ceau were very much disaffected to government, I took every precaution to disguise the appear∣ance of an officer.</P>
<P>We proceeded in our canoe, on the 26th, to the point of Isle-Madame; intending to cross the great passage of Canceau. This passage is called the Gut of Canceau, from an Acadian settlement of that name on the continent; and separates the Island of Cape-Breton from Aca∣dia, or, as it is now called by the English, No∣va-Scotia. The island of Madame lies in the middle of the Gut, but rather nearer to Cape-Breton
<PB N="75" REF="045437_0407_102029B673405C80"/>
than to the main; and the passage to this island is called the Small, that from the Island to Canceau, the Great Passage. On mak∣ing the point of Isle-Madame, we found that there was still a great quantity of floating ice in the Great Passage, and, not thinking it prudent to venture in our frail vessel among it, we re∣turned to Narrashoc, in order to procure a small sloop or vessel that could resist the ice.</P>
<P>Having accordingly provided one, we embar∣ked our little canoe in it, and, on the 27th, the wind being as favourable as we could wish, got across the passage, which is eight leagues, in three hours. The men, who navigated the ves∣sel to the other side, were very apprehensive of some American privateers lying in the harbour of Canceau, having seen several is the bay two days before. Upon this intelligence, I gave my dispatches and papers to one of the Indians, knowing well, that they never attempt to search or plunder any of these people. We were, how∣ever, so fortunate, as to see no privateers on en∣tering the harbour.</P>
<P>On landing at Canceau, I went to the house of a Mr. Rust, who is the principal man at this place, and acts as a justice of the peace under go∣vernment for which he receives about 100<HI>l. per annum.</HI> The inhabitants on the other side, as well as the people who brought us over, having informed me, that this gentleman always supplied the New-England-cruizers with every necessary that his stores could afford; I was determined, to be very cautious in every thing I said, in his pre∣sence. Having paid the person who brought us
<PB N="76" REF="045437_0408_102029BAC64D8A68"/>
over the gut, and thanked him for his private intelligence, I was conducted to the house of this Mr. Rust, to whom I passed myself for the captain of the ship. He asked me a number of questions, the tendency of which I could easily perceive; and therefore, gave him as evasive an∣swers as possible. I found that he had a brother-in-law, who was a first-lieutenant on board a sixteen-gun-brig, belonging to Boston, which had gone out of the harbour of Canceau the day before.</P>
<P>We remained in this place till three o'clock the next morning, when, being apprehensive of treachery, on the part of our pretended friends; we sat off, without any intimation of it to Mr. Rust. Prom this gentleman I had purchased a piece of sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> pork, and about eight pounds of biscuit, which he said was as much as he could spare, and for which, I was obliged to pay him at least thrice its value. We were now to proceed in our canoe, along the coast to Halifax, and had reason to fear that we should be again distressed for provisions. However, we were so lucky as to find, as we coasted along, plenty of lobsters and other fish, which the Indians caught with prodigious dexterity, killing the flat fish with a pointed pole, and the lobsters with a cloven one. We were ten days going from Canceau to Hali∣fax: during which interval, we did not meet with any settlement, and saw nothing worth mention∣ing, except a number of picaroons on various parts of the coast.</P>
<P>The Indians remained, for a few days, at Ha∣lifax; when, having received the balance due to
<PB N="77" REF="045437_0409_102029BC50ABCE98"/>
them, they took their departure for the island. I was obliged to continue here for two months longer, till an opportunity served for a passage in the Royal-Oak, to New-York; where I deliver∣ed my dispatches (in a very ragged condition) to Sir Henry Clinton.</P>
<P>The rest of my fellow-sufferers in the ship∣wreck, soon after arrived at Halifax, in a shallop from Spanish-River. The captain, conscious of the reception he would meet with, did not think proper to go to his owner at New-York, to give an account of the loss of his vessel; but took his passage in a ship from Halifax to London, and now serves as a pilot on the Thames. The mate was, on account of his good conduct du∣ring the whole of our transactions, appointed, by a gentleman in Halifax, to the command of a ship bound to the West-Indies.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR EMILY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVE you then forgotten your promise to come down to the country, and spend a few days with me in the beginning of spring? Perhaps the fine folks in town, do not suppose that the spring is come yet. I can account for their mistake. Nothing but the sun can con∣vince them of its approach; and they keep themselves so mewed up in their apartments, that they think very little of consulting him. As for us, we enjoy his kindly beams already. The country, which was so dull for some months, has reassumed all its charms. The trees, have shaken off winter's squalid dress; to put on, once more, the livery of the spring. The birds, returning in crowds, form the most agreeable concerts; while they hide their nests under the thick foli∣age of the groves. What can you be doing in town? Were you to pass the whole day at your window, breathing the fresh air, would you sup∣pose that you enjoyed the spring? Cast your eyes round you, what do you see? A sky clouded with smoke, dirty streets; in short, the same ob∣jects that you have seen all the winter. The

house-tops, it is true, are no longer covered with snow and icicles, but your dun tiles, even with this advantage, afford no very brilliant prospect. Do you see, as I do, the sun's rising beams deck the fresh leaf with purple and gold; do you see the dew-drops shine like pearls, before his warmth dries them up; do you see him, when he emerges from behind the hill, inundate the vast horizon with a torrent of light? I suppose your town idlers, who have stuck so long to their fire-sides, begin to trust themselves, at length, to the park, though they still shudder with the cold that they have felt; but look at them attentive∣ly, you will find that one winter has made them old. Here, on the contrary, every thing seems to have grown young again. The brooks have purged their muddy waters; the meadows are enamelled with new flowers; the pale primrose adorns every bank; and even the prickly haw∣thorn, prepares to dress itself in the blossoms of May, in order to soften its rugged aspect. How pleasing, after the dull silence that reigned through all nature, to hear the bleating of the flocks, that are seen climbing up the green slopes; and the clamorous joy of the children and youth, who come out to enjoy their accustomed sports in the fields. Our house is built upon an emi∣nence, exposed to the earliest beams of the sun. I might, if I chose, receive his morning visits in my chamber; but I like better to rise with the dawn, and pay him my respects in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon the top of the hill; and thither I repair in the evening also, to take my leave of him.</P>

These, my dear Emily, are some of the plea∣sures that the country affords; but, I feel the want of a friend to enjoy them with me. Make haste, therefore, and come down. Do not sup∣pose, that whatever time you spend here, will be lost to your improvement: I learn here a thou∣sand things, of which I am ashamed that I have hitherto been ignorant. Our little accomplish∣ments too, I am very sure, will not contract rust in this air. The sweet songs of the nightingale will remind us of cultivating our voices more attentively. The little lambs, that bound and frisk round their mothers, will give us an exam∣ple of ease, grace, and agility; while the land∣scape, varying before us at every step, will in∣vite us, to exercise our pencils, and vie with the colouring of nature: such rivals as these, may, perhaps, humble our vanity, but they take no pride to themselves, from our inferiority; and therefore, we can forgive their excelling us. Try to prevail upon your mama to come down along with you: we expect you both, with the most earnest impatience. Adieu, my dear Emily. The moment, that I can suppose my letter to have reached you, I will go and post myself at the end of our avenue, to wait your coming. You will do wrong, to let me moan there long, like the turtle for its absent mate. Once more, adieu. Believe me unalterable in the friendship which I have vowed to maintain for you, while I re∣main.</P>

<HEAD>EMILY BEAUMONT TO JULIA MONTAGUE.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE not forgotten the promise that you mention, my dear Julia, and if I have not per∣formed it, I am pretty sure, when you hear the reason, you will not think me deserving of your reproaches. I chose rather to appear deserving of them, than to wound your tender breast with my sorrows. These I can now impart to you, as they are at present totally dissipated. You know how tenderly I love my worthy mother. Well, my dear friend, I have been upon the point of losing her for ever; and shudder still at the thoughts of my danger. Since the death of my papa, her health had been constantly on the decline; but I flattered myself, that the amuse∣ments of the country, your mama's agreeable company, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the pleasure of seeing me happy in your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> might in some measure divert her grief, and contribute to the recovery of her health. It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this hope, that made me talk last winter, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ch high spirits, of the pleasures that we were to enjoy in the spring. The first approaches of this charming season revived in my mind the most delicious ideas. I was busy, the other day, preparing for our jaunt; and mama,
<PB N="82" REF="045437_0414_102029CDDA131450"/>
with her usual good nature, seeing my impati∣ence, was as earnest on her part, where, as she was packing up her things, a bundle of letters of my father's, which she has always preserved, fell into her hands. It was late in the evening; she therefore sent me to bed, that she might peruse them more at her ease. I have since learned that she was reading them the whole night. They must have agitated her spirits most powerfully; for, in the morning, a fever ap∣peared on her in all its violence, and reduced her in two days to the last extremity. Judge what I must have suffered in seeing her delirious the whole time, and hearing her pronounce my papa's dear name with a voice scarcely audible. I trembled, every moment, lest I should lose her as well as him. What would have become of me, deprived of that dear mother, who seems to care for life on no other account than that of her affection for me? I had ever been sensible of her fondness, but at that moment how much did I feel my love and gratitude increase! Al∣though her situation rendered her unconscious of my care and tenderness, yet, I exerted myself in the melancholy office, as much, as if she had re∣paid me by her fondest caresses. My father, whose image was so strongly painted in my re∣membrance, seemed to thank me for her. I never left her bed-side a single moment, and I have now the pleasure to see her recover per∣ceptibly. I cannot express to you, what new sentiments this revolution in my mother's health has given birth to, in my breast. The names of mother and daughter, sound in my ears with a
<PB N="83" REF="045437_0415_102029CF6245ED00"/>
sweetness, that I never found in them before. Whatever reminds me of the tender ties of na∣ture, excites in my soul more melting emotions than I have ever hitherto experienced. Of this I had a proof yesterday, which I shall long re∣member.</P>
<P>Mama took me, to spend a day out of town, at Lady D—'s, who had testified the strongest concern for her, during her illness. I had al∣ways heard this lady mentioned, with ex∣pressions of respect and affection, but my age's levity had hindered me, from making remarks upon her character with any attention. I now resolved, however, to study it observantly. We found her at our arrival, in a company of near twenty visitors; some of whom, were united to her, by the ties of friendship, others, common acquaintances, who had occasionally, matters of business to transact with her husband. Her countenance, which was constantly brightened with a smile of candor and good nature, en∣couraged even strangers to be at their ease, in her company. I admired, with what ease she could address all by turns, in the very style which their several circumstances made the properest, forgetting no person in so numerous a company, and yet, in the midst of all these various atten∣tions, overlooking her young family with the care of a mother, though she did not appear in the least engaged with them. In the evening, when the company was retired, mama yielded to the request of her friend, who pressingly entreat∣ed her, to prolong the pleasure that she enjoyed, in being once more in her society. Lady D—
<PB N="84" REF="045437_0416_102029D14E9B8468"/>
had just received agreeable news, from two of her sons, who were on their travels. Her husband was returned the same day, from a short journey into the country. These two circumstances, threw her into a most delicious frame of mind; and her happiness, was equally painted in the smile that hung upon her lips, and in the sweet drops that bedewed her eyes. It seemed, as if her soul, replete with love, feared to contract her joy within herself, and would therefore dif∣fuse it upon all around, to make them partners in her happiness. The impression was so pleas∣ing, that you could not avoid cherishing it, as your own proper sensation. Her feelings had the same effect, as a fine evening, in which, nature, takes pleasure to breathe into every bosom, the sweets that she dispenses. A light and lively chearfulness, quickly succeeded to this tender mood, and from that air of nobleness, that character of dignity and good sense, which was to her so natural, and which she had supported, to so much advantage, in the general conver∣sation of the afternoon, I saw her with the same grace, descend to the most playful good humour, and the most intimate familiarity. Mama was touched with the affectionate part, that she took concerning the happy return of her health; I confess, I myself was touched with the flattering instances of friendship, that I received from her lips; but I know not how, she found the secret of making her own pleasure, become still more sensibly interesting to us. Sometimes, by caresses, she would encourage her daughter, to display before her father, the accomplishments, which
<PB N="85" REF="045437_0417_102029D442105DB8"/>
she had acquired in his absence: sometimes by ingeniously irritating her, as it were, she would elicit from her daughter's vivacity a thousand strokes of native wit and delicacy. Amiable artifice of maternal tenderness, that endeavourest to adorn children, in all their graces, before the eyes of a delighted father, in order to render him, in his turn, more dear to his children, by the increase of his affection! How well didst thou become that pure, ingenuous soul, which was so much a stranger to artifice of every other kind!</P>
<P>The rest of the evening, was spent in a varie∣ty of little amusements, and I entered into the spirit of them more, I think, than I should have done, in any other house, because they generally appear, to be no other than expedients, to be∣guile the wearisome time away, whereas the chearfulness, spirit and cordiality, with which they are seasoned by Lady D—, renders them real and genuine pleasures. At length, however, the moment of our departure arrived, and I con∣fess to you, not without costing me a very lively regret. We had hardly been seated in the car∣riage, when, dearest mama, cried <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, throwing my arms round her neck, how much do I thank you, for having made me a witness, to the hap∣piness of that respectable family! I know, I shall love you still more for it, than ever I have. You see, my Emily, answered she, pressing me tender∣ly to her bosom, how much the sweets of nature and of friendship, excel all other pleasures. My heart felt the same impression, and ever does, when I am in the company of my worthy friend.
<PB N="86" REF="045437_0418_102029D89D693878"/>
I never leave her, but I find myself more inclined to practise my duty, and better instructed by her example, in the means of succeeding. Ah, mama, how delightful are those duties, and how easy do they appear, from the manner in which Lady D—performs them. I think, to be in her company one single day, would be a sufficient inducement to any woman upon earth, to seek the same happiness. You are right, my dear, such is the charm of true virtue, that at sight of her, all ingenuous souls feel the most willing in∣clination, to follow her example. But many are soon disheartened by some difficulties, which wear a formidable aspect, and this merely for want of a sufficient steadiness of principle. Lady D—, had the courage, to form her principles in her earliest youth, and never to swerve from them, during the rest of her life. With all the pleasing qualities and accomplishments, that were capable of making her shine in the world; a fortune, sufficient to supply even thoughtless dissipation; and, in spite of the examples which she might have pleaded in her excuse, she was early sensible that her own esteem, that of her husband, her family, and her friends, were of more solid value to such a mind as her's. All her thoughts, all her actions, have been directed by this virtuous determination. Her efforts be∣came every day easier to her, and the success of them was the beginning of her reward. The more she has tasted the happiness of this reward, the more lively dread she has felt of losing it, were she to deviate a single moment from her plan of rectitude. Hence her courage has never
<PB N="87" REF="045437_0419_102029DB90AAD498"/>
been daunted at any difficulty. All her children have been brought up at her own breast. They have never been sick, but her embrace consoled them. She formed their earliest ideas, their ear∣liest sentiments; she has incessantly watched over the minutest particulars of their education; and even at this day, their happiness is her only soli∣citude: to that, her generous affection would sa∣crifice the dearest considerations of her own hap∣piness; and, from the calm, in which so many subjects of inward satisfaction sustain her mind, in the midst of all its activity, proceeds that air of serenity and chearfulness, that candid ingenu∣ous manner, which gains your esteem at the first look. Being, therefore, always certain of meet∣ing with good will and respect from others, as she finds nothing in herself unworthy of these sentiments, she needs only to pursue the natural bent of her disposition, in order to be sure of pleasing: and to these means of pleasing, with which nature has endowed her, she has united all those that are in the gift of reason, cultivated by reflection, reading and experience. It seems, as if nothing were beyond the reach of her fa∣culties, in the same manner as there is nothing which her feelings do not interest. Her conver∣sation is as touching as instructive. One would say, that all her ideas pass by her heart, and there clothe themselves in the expression of the most noble and delicate sentiment. An unalter∣able equality of temper, an amiableness ever new, bind her husband's affections to her in the sweetest captivity, nor ever allow him to wish for other relaxation from his cares, than he finds in
<PB N="88" REF="045437_0420_102029DD1AA0F888"/>
her company. In effect, what sight can he find, when from home, capable of engaging him so much as his own house; when he sees his friends, fatigued amid the bustling scenes of the world, come to this asylum of peace and honour, to seek the pleasure which those scenes could not afford them? The air of frankness and becom∣ing liberty that you find in this house, disposes all hearts to become susceptible of generous sen∣timents, and still farther to open themselves with the most unreserved confidence. You are there safe both against others and yourself, as in a tem∣ple, where every thing inspires the respect and love of a beneficent Deity, whom we should dread to offend even in our most secret thoughts. Instead of the jealousies and claims of precedence which raise discord among other women, those whom she has chosen for her acquaintance, only feel, in her presence, the desire of meriting her esteem daily more and more; and this, being equally the business of all, attaches them to each other by new ties, and leads them to offer her their united tribute of gratitude and friendship: thus every thing conspires, to afford her the su∣blimest happiness that a soul, endowed with sen∣sibility, can taste. Happy as a wife, happy as a mother, happy as a friend, all around her forms an empire, as it were, the subjects of which re∣sign their hearts to her governance, that she may fill them with virtuous sentiment and emulation of her noble qualities.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the vivacity with which my mother delivered me this portrait of Lady D—, it made so powerful an impression on me, that I
<PB N="89" REF="045437_0421_102029E1A2CFAEA0"/>
have found it again this morning, quite fresh in my memory. I hasten to send it to you, re∣questing you, at the same time, to shew it to your mother. I confess to you, I should be happy to see it in the hands of all honest peo∣ple. Nay, I think, we owe this public homage to virtue, that we should paint the pleasures which it bestows, both in order to encourage those who practise it, and to invite others to do so by the hopes of the same happiness. The only person from whom I should wish to conceal it, is, my Lady D—herself, and that for fear of offending her modesty; if, after all, this very quality would permit her to discover her own resemblance in the picture. Her friends alone would be struck with the likeness, and would thank me for having <HI>given</HI> them <HI>back the image</HI> of those sentiments which they all entertain of her in their hearts. Honest people, in general, would applaud me for having shewed by a liv∣ing pattern, that virtue is not a stranger upon earth: that it may be allied to the most amiable character, and enjoy the purest bliss that the con∣dition of humanity is capable of tasting.</P>
<P>Let us, my dear friend, who have the happi∣ness to find the same principles in our parents, profit by this new example, and be still further animated to tread in their steps. We are in that happy age of life, when our instructions and occupations are so many amusements; when our first duty, is, to follow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> he pleasing bent of gratitude and tender affection to those who gave us birth; and whose only ambition is to adorn us by virtues and accomplishments. To these sen∣timents
<PB N="90" REF="045437_0422_102029E32F2E6E20"/>
let us join those of the friendship which unites us: it began in our infancy; we shall shortly renew it in the country, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the most smiling season of the year. All these circum∣stances should add a force and a delicacy to it, which may extend both its duration and its hap∣piness to our whole lives. It hath taught you to share the pain that I have felt, from our separa∣tion; let it also teach you to partake of the joy which my heart alone would not be sufficient to contain, that of going next week to receive your embrace.</P>

<P>AFTER having laboured so hard during the best part of our lives, thus at last to fall into poverty! To what purpose is it, that we have

never ceased our cares and pains for a single mo∣ment, in order to breed up our children with credit? If they were but of an age to earn their own bread, it would be something! My dear children, it is not for myself, it is for you that I shed tears; in losing our cattle we have lost our all. What remains, is far from being sufficient to pay our landlord. What is to become of us? if my good husband did not support my sinking courage, I should die with grief. But how wor∣thy a character he is! What a man! How tran∣quil, in the midst of our misfortunes! Were I not sure, that affection makes him conceal the greatest part of his troubles, from the fear of af∣flicting me, I should believe he were insensible to them. "Why dost thou weep, Martha, he often says, when I can no longer restrain my tears? We have had a loss, it is true; but who knows what Providence has in store for us! I, for my part, make that my dependence." Alas, though never rich himself, he was always a friend to the unfortunate. How many families in this village has he saved from misery, by his advice and assistance! There is not a better man on earth; and I still possess what many women want in the midst of riches, a worthy husband, and children, whose good dispositions fill our hearts with joy. Whilst I think on these bles∣sings, I feel that Providence watches over us, and my griefs become lighter. Take courage then, Martha, enough is left to console thee in thy affliction. <STAGE>(She advances to the door, and calls)</STAGE> Jenny, Jenny.</P>

<P>Give it to me, mother, that I may kiss it. My little friend, when you are as able as I am, you shall work for your father and mo∣ther too. Oh, you shall see what care I will take of this little baby, that it may become strong and robust. But stay, we are busy at present; you must go sleep a little. <STAGE>(She puts it back into the cradle, whilst the mother looks affectionately at them both.)</STAGE> Mother, I have just brought the beer; will you lend me the key of the cupboard, that I may fetch some clean linen, and a waistcoat, for

my father: I know he will return overcome with heat and fatigue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Martha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, and if he has any good news, he will not care how much he fatigues himself, in order to hasten to us with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(shutting the cupboard, and laying the linen on a chair.)</STAGE>
<P>I know it; and then he would, without resting, go to the field: he never loses a moment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Martha.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a good lesson for us; you, for example, would do well to hasten your break∣fast, and go to school; as soon as you have asked your father's blessing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>To school! Oh, no, I shall not go there now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Martha.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you say, Jenny? do you not mean to learn to read and write? No, no, my child, I hope, however we may be reduced, to be always able to afford you this instruction, though I should be forced to stint myself in com∣mon necessaries for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>But there will be no occasion for any more expense on that account. Does not my brother Valentine read as fluently as our school∣master at his desk? and he will be master to Lu∣cy and me: he told me so this morning. Sis∣ter, said he, you know that I am allowed half an hour's rest after dinner, before I return to work; well then, if you will, during that time, begin a lesson with me, I will finish it when I come home in the evening. You have nothing to do but to apply diligently, and I'll answer for it, you will soon be the best scholar in the village. Let us begin to-day, and you shall see.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenny.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, his own indeed, mother; it would never have come in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> my head. It is I, said he, who have cost my parents the most, be∣ing the eldest; had they spent less on me, they would have had the money <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or you, my sisters: I ought therefore to give you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the instruction that I have received, now that our father cannot afford it you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Martha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas, could we have known, at the time that we were providing masters for him, that he would one day have wanted necessaries! He has cost us something, it is true, in his edu∣cation, but I do not regret it. The money has been well laid out. Valentine is grateful, and does his best to give us proofs of it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Martha.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, but do not be uneasy at that, for they were tears of pleasure, at having such dutiful children. If you did but know, how much satisfaction they have given me this morn∣ing, on your account!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are sweet words to me: there is not a greater happiness, when we do our own duty, than to see it done by those who be∣long to us.

<P>Into his best parlour!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Jenny: he was drinking coffee with his lady, and they ordered a ham on the same table for me; and madam was so good as to cut me a slice.</P>

<SPEAKER>Martha.</SPEAKER>
<P>How charming is this! and then—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, my good Thorow∣good, said Mr. Parks, what news? Very bad, answered I: I have lost all my cattle, in the space of eight days; by a disease, brought on by the drought of the season. I am ruined, and I am come to inform you of it, that you may be at liberty to let your farm to another tenant. I come also to offer you all that I have left in the world: it is a great trouble to me, that I have not sufficient to satisfy you; but I promise, on the word of an honest man, to labour night and day, till I can do so. I shall eat of the bread of bitterness till I have paid my debt, to the utmost farthing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Martha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, certainly, we will do it readi∣ly. What did Mr. Parks say to this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="102" REF="045437_0434_10202A0870B76B98"/>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was already acquainted with your losses, honest Thorowgood, said he, and am heartily sorry for them. I pity you also, said madam, with her sweet voice: I pity you with all my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Martha.</SPEAKER>
<P>The worthy couple! how good they are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not come here, said I, to excite compassion, I have no occasion for it, as I am able to work. My great concern is, that I cannot acquit myself of my debts to you: I own, I feel for my wife and my young family: I, who would have shed my blood to preserve them from want! You who are rich, and without children, know not what it is to see those suffer to whom we have given life. Ah, if you had such children as I have; if you loved them with all your soul, and were beloved by them as I am! In saying this, grief made me hide my face; and when I lifted up my eyes again, I saw Mr. Parks was no longer looking at me: he had turned toward his wife; their eyes were filled with tears, and fixed on each other. Pity was not the only sentiment which then affected them; I plainly saw, that something, which more nearly concerned themselves, occupied their minds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Martha.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did you not ask them what it was?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>I had not the courage; but as I continued to talk of my children, Mr. Parks strove to change the discourse. I perceived clearly that some private affliction was the cause of this; and therefore, hastened to quit the sub∣ject.
<PB N="103" REF="045437_0435_10202A09FAC3DA90"/>
and began talking about my corn, and reckoning, how much it would yield toward pay∣ing my rent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Martha.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray was not Mr. Parks very angry, when he found it fall so short of that sum?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>Quite the contrary; he bid me not despair. Go home to your wife, said the good gentleman, I will order my horse, and be with you presently, when we will settle every thing. I have always looked upon you as an honest man, therefore I will do nothing in this business, without your concurrence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Martha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is this possible? How much do we owe him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>Four hundred and fifty pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Martha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas, alas, how shall we be ever able to pay this money?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true; and yet had we saved our cattle, and our crops had answered this year, we should have had enough and something over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Martha.</SPEAKER>
<P>But as it is, what will become of us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why all that we can do now, is to collect together our houshold-goods and farm∣ing-utensils, and sell them, to pay our landlord: we will keep nothing but what is on our backs: we can then shew ourselves before him with a clear conscience. This is the only course that we can take to avoid misery. <STAGE>(Somebody knocks softly at the door.)</STAGE></P>

<P>No, not yet:</P>

<P>So much the better. I am come to offer my services, and to put you in a method to defend yourself against him.</P>

<P>Against him! Pray was it not Mr. Parks who gave you the place that you hold? Do not you serve him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Steward.</SPEAKER>
<P>I allow it; therefore I should not chuse to be seen openly in this business; my de∣sign is to support you secretly. I can recom∣mend to you a lawyer of this town, by whose means you shall be the gainer, where you expect to lose: you understand me? He is one of those we call a shrewd knavish fellow: trust to him, he'll settle the business for you: he is my friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>A knavish fellow, and your friend: I should have guessed so. Only see the force of sympathy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Steward.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must not take things so literal∣ly; I mean that he is a man capable of bring∣ing you safe out of your embarrassments, and the present juncture is very favourable to you; this year having proved ruinous to the farmers in many places, will easily account for your be∣coming bankrupt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall have nothing to do with your plan, Sir, but shall pay my landlord my full debt, whenever fortune enables me.</P>
</SP>

<P>You despise the law, then, though it offers you its assistance.</P>

<PB N="106" REF="045437_0438_10202A1486E79BD0"/>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I do not despise it, but I think a man's conscience should be his just law; and if I make a bargain, which is not contrary to that, I think honour obliges me to stand to it; even though the law might discharge me from it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Steward.</SPEAKER>
<P>Take my word for it, neither your honour or conscience will suffer in this business: it is not your fault that you have had those los∣ses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you know that? per∣haps I was to blame, to purchase so many cattle at once; had I bought but half, my loss would not have been so great, and I should have had money enough left to pay my rent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Steward.</SPEAKER>
<P>And be it your fault, or not, the the thing is done now. And are you aware of what you expose yourself to, when you leave all to the discretion of Mr. Parks? Why he has it in his power to throw you into prison.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>And if he has that power, why should I seek to take it from him? and if he means to treat me with humanity, why rob him of that pleasure?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Steward.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, suppose he should not prove rigorous; he is a mortal, you know; and his heirs may not be so tractable; whereas, if you follow my advice, you may secure yourself from accidents, and procure a final acquittance of the debt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! can your lawyer make my landlord believe that he is paid, before he has received his just due?</P>

<PB N="107" REF="045437_0439_10202A160EFA2EC8"/>
<SPEAKER>Steward.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, but after having made himself acquainted with your affairs, he can settle them much to your advantage, and put some money in your pocket, besides; you understand me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not want his assistance for this; I can make the matter as clear to my landlord, myself; he knows, very well, the mis∣fortunes which have reduced me. I cannot now pass for a man of property.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Steward.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true, but one ought always to do things by rule. Now, this lawyer, whom I recommend, is one of the best in the country in managing a business of this sort: besides, I mean, myself to lend you every assistance in my power.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot imagine what may be your motive for acting in this manner, so much against the Squire's interest; unless it is, because, he appears willing to settle my affairs, without consulting you, and so deprive you of the per∣quisites of your office.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Steward.</SPEAKER>
<P>What perquisites?</P>
</SP>

<P>I do not doubt it. And so, Mr. Pinch, you think I will let you, to whom I owe nothing, have the fingering of my money, in order to defraud my landlord, to whom I owe so

much; besides the many obligations that I have to him, for his constant goodness to me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Steward.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you will not be the less his debtor for this; all your effects are not sufficient to clear your account with him. Now, if you take my advice, you may preserve a part, and all that you earn hereafter, will be your own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot see the thing in this light: I am determined to give up all that I have to my landlord; and whatever I can save here∣after, I will lay by, to pay the remainder of my debt to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Steward.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it your design then, to exhaust your strength by labour, without reaping the pro∣fit? Do you mean to pass your whole life in working for others?</P>

<P>You do not know the pleasure which a man has, in being sa∣tisfied with himself. With what tears of joy shall I, from time to time, carry to Mr. Parks the fruits of my industry! What happiness shall I experience, in having it in my power to prove my gratitude, and to convince him that he was not deceived when he took me for an honest man; and that, when I lost my little fortune, I did not lose my probity also!</P>

<P>Ah, Thorowgood, Thorowgood, I see, you do not know your own interest.</P>

<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mean that I do not pro∣mote your's. Do you think that I am to be made thus the dupe to your avarice? You want to draw me into a knavish act, in order to reap the profit of it yourself. Why do you not go to my landlord, and offer him your services a∣gainst

me! It is because you know he has too much goodness, to seek my ruin; and yet you thought that I might be ungrateful enough to deprive him of his just due. No, Mr. Pinch, you may, if you please, forget your obligations to him; for my part, I shall remember mine as long as I live. I have had no occasion for you hitherto, and I think I shall be able to do with∣out you, in future. Go then, and seek clients elsewhere, for your roguish friends.</P>

<P>Be satisfied then; I have some good news for you. I thought that Humphries had lost all his cattle, as well as I; but upon cast∣ing my eye over our garden, I saw on the other side of the hedge, four fine cows grazing in the meadow below.</P>

<PB N="111" REF="045437_0443_10202A223A92EB38"/>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must know there is a bargain between us, which gives me a right to two of those beasts.</P>

<SPEAKER>Martha.</SPEAKER>
<P>How is that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will tell you: when the dis∣ease first broke out among our cattle, I saw Humphries was quite cast down by it; as I had always hitherto been more fortunate than he, I offered to do all in my power to serve him. He thanked me in so affecting a manner, that I wished to give him some proof of my good will, upon the spot. You must know, just before the disorder appeared, we had made a joint purchase of twelve cows at a neighbouring fair. It is true, I advanced two-thirds of the money; but upon his consenting to graze them, for a certain time on his farm, (which was an excellent bargain for him, in point of money, as we settled it) I told him that, whatever of the herd should escape the mortality, we would divide equally between us. At that time I had no reason to think, that this arrangement would turn out in my favour; and now, though it has, I should be far from taking advantage of it, if it regarded myself alone; but I am no longer master of my own. I am o∣bliged to give up all my remaining property to my landlord. I should therefore think myself guilty of a theft, if I did not, on this account, lay claim to every thing due to me.</P>

to have so fine a herd of cattle as I had, and to save but four out of them!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am much more to be pitied, for being under the necessity of asking them of you. When we made the bargain, which of us was most likely to be the gainer by it? had not I the greatest number of cows? did not I agree to it, out of kindness to you? and did not you yourself look upon it in that light?</P>

<P>To be sure, neighbour; but after so great a loss—</P>
</SP>

<P>I see then the extent of your in∣tegrity. You are one of those honest men, who can walk uprightly, as long as prosperity holds, but stumble at the first step, if fortune change ever so little. I find, my wife knew you better than I did; and I plainly see that we must not depend too much on the rectitude of others.</P>

<P>I have nothing farther to say to you, if you consult the chicane of the law, before your conscience. I was once your friend, and that restrains me from publicly exposing your dishonesty.

<P>How! have you sold it to him, then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, but since my losses, being no longer in a condition to pay, I have given him up, all that I possess.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Meadows.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you mad, Thorowgood? why you have the law on your side: till your grain is made over to your landlord by some security, it belongs to you, and you may do what you please with it. Come, come, you have lost too much already: ask Martha what she thinks of the matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Martha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I think that we ought, in the first place, to pay our debts, at any rate: if we have lost our cattle, our landlord has not gained by it; the loss, therefore, is our affair, not his.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Meadows.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you must not carry this so far as to deprive yourself of bread. You ought to keep something in reserve, to be above want.</P>

<P>Come, come, do not be so stiff; take my advice: it depends all on the manner in which we see things. There is no doubt but your landlord would do you a kindness: but to make that matter sure, do one to yourself. Do you want to be one among the number of poor, that he relieves?</P>

<P>He will not have that pleasure long, if all his tenants take your advice.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Thorowgood, </SPEAKER>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Meadows.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, but the gallows!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, that alone restrains you: but if I were to judge you, Meadows, I would let you see, that you do not deserve it the less for what you have just now proposed to me. I see no difference, for my part, between robbing a man of his money, or robbing him of the fruits of his land.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Meadows.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, there is a great difference in the two cases.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>There may be so; but if you will reflect a little, I am of opinion, you will think as I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Meadows.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not desire it, indeed: there is little to be got by this way of reasoning. Come, come, Thorowgood, consider your own interest a little better: Your landlord will have great obligations to you, to be sure, when you have reduced yourself to want, on his account. He will only despise you, and treat you the worse for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>If his heart were like your's, I should have reason to fear this.</P>
</SP>

preserve your family from want; it is you that are the hard-hearted man, and will be guilty of all their sufferings, and perhaps their death. I only desire to give you your own price for your wheat; that is, if you are reasonable; and here is the money.</P>

<P>Why, Martha, what still cast down? Shall our children be more courageous than we! We possess all their love; but do not let us lessen it, by giving them cause to esteem us less. They know that it is not our bad con∣duct which has brought these misfortunes upon us; but if we suffer ourselves to be overcome by a weak despair, we shall appear faulty to them.

<P>And I, Martha, am as ready as you to declare this. Yes, Valentine, you have done for us a hundred times more than we had a right to expect. I love you with all the ten∣derness of a real father; but, nevertheless, you know that I am not yours. Had we continued
<PB N="132" REF="045437_0464_10202A610D9B5A48"/>
in prosperity, you should have always been our son, our dear son; all my other children believe you to be their brother. I meant, after my death, that you should have shared with them the little substance which you have daily helped me to in∣crease. This hope was a comfort to my heart, but it is destroyed: nothing now is left us, not even the distant prospect of re-establishment.</P>

<P>And is this the moment which you have chosen to cast me from among the number of your children?</P>

<P>Yes, I ought to do so: the ties of blood bind them to our lot, whatever it be: if we suffer, they ought to suffer with us; but you, what right have I to involve you in my dis∣tress? No, Valentine, I advise you as a friend; and if it must be, I command you, as a father, to quit an unfortunate family. It is time that you should do something for yourself; since it is no longer in my power to give you a fortune, I re∣joice that I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ad you so well instructed as to enable you to gain one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Valentine.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must not remind me of these obligations, if you wish to have me abandon you; I must first forget them myself: you saved my life in my infancy: you have bread me up, and educated me, without expecting any recom∣pense; and you command me to be ungrateful for all these benefits.</P>

O my father, re∣call to your remembrance the first days of my infancy, when I was as a stranger in your fami∣ly. How many times have you pressed me in your arms at your return from hard-labour, which you had prolonged in order to support me. And you, my dear mother, can you forget the many tender caresses that you have lavished on me, at the very time when I was eating the bread of your children? You alone received me, when abandoned by all the world; and shall I now a∣bandon you? I was your son to inherit your fortune, and shall I not be so to share your po∣verty?

<P>They look finely: there is to the value of a hundred pounds if there be a shilling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, so much the better. <STAGE>(He looks round the room.)</STAGE> But what does all this mean? one would imagine that you were going to have an auction here. Why all this linen and furniture piled up in this manner?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is because we expected your coming, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>I told you this morning that we should not be able to pay our rent; it is there∣fore our duty to give you up what we have, and you see it collected here. With the sale of our furniture, clothes, and corn, we mean to pay you as far as we can. Whatever may be defi∣cient, we will endeavour to earn by our labour, till we have paid to a farthing. I hope, Sir, you will at present be satisfied with this on account, and have a little patience for the rest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Martha.</SPEAKER>
<P>As you have been always so indul∣gent to us—and, indeed, it is not by any fault of ours that we are in this distress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know, as well as myself, Sir, that I had drained the marshes in order to make them fit for pasture, and they were in a thriving way. All the money that we had re∣maining last year, we laid out in cattle, in order to fatten them for sale. Twenty head of good cattle was a little fortune which promised fair to pay our rent, by sending a few of them off to
<PB N="143" REF="045437_0475_10202A838EE27490"/>
market. A drought came on; there was scarce∣ly a blade of grass in my fields. I fed my cat∣tle with the straw of my bed, the thatch of my barn, and sometimes with the vegetables that were for my family's use. When I wanted to get rid of them, I could find no purchaser, owing to the scarcity of fodder. A murrain got among them, and I lost them all; I owe nothing, how∣ever, to any body but to you, Sir. Come and look at your grounds; you will see whether I have neglected to cultivate them; you will see if my own labour, with that of my wife and chil∣dren, may not enable me one day to pay all my debts; I can, however, give you no other secu∣rity than my own word: but as I have always been punctual, till now, in my engagements with you, I should hope that you would have some re∣liance on my promise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my friends, I do know you. Why should I not be content with the promise of such honest worthy people as you are?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>I give you thanks, Sir; your kind words are still more pleasing than your good∣ness itself. How seldom will a creditor give the character of an honest man to the debtor by whom he has lost!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>How seldom also does it happen, my friend Thorowgood, that a creditor, can with truth say, that the debtor, by whom he has suf∣fered, is worthy of that appellation!</P>

<SP>

<P>How, Sir, there is nothing more natural and pleasing than to receive assist∣ance from our children. Were I as rich as a king all my possessions should be theirs; when I have nothing, whatever they possess, is mine. <STAGE>(To his children.)</STAGE> Won't you be always glad to pay for us?</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my friend, you are surpri∣sed, yet it is too true. When by folly and ex∣travagance, ambitious and destructive schemes, people have put it out of their power to pay their debts, they transfer to their children the property which they may have obtained from the credulity and confidence of their creditors, and when the latter, apply for payment, the pa∣rents possess nothing, and all that they seemed to have, is found in the hands of their children, who will not part with it.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your laws are as corrupt as those who stifle their voice, if they will not speak out on such occasions. Hear me, Sir; I am entirely ignorant of law proceedings; but I would not hesitate, to say openly to that justice, who would submit to such restriction—Thou hast no further business upon earth; be gone, then, to hell, where the wicked shall at last meet with due punishment. Were I the dupe of the father, I would go to the children, and ask them, by what right, they retained the property, which ought to be restored to me. If they should tell me, that they received it from their parents, my answer would be, your parents could not bestow it on you; it belongs to me. I would compel
<PB N="148" REF="045437_0480_10202A8FD2594400"/>
them, without mercy, to fell the bed from under them, in order to satisfy me.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>Matters are not carried on in that manner with us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would have them carried on in my way: such fathers, and such children, are no better than a knot of thieves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>The fathers are the most crimi∣nal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, begging your pardon; the latter are still more so; the former are knaves, but the others are monsters. When a stranger hath relieved us in our distress, are we not in du∣ty bound, whilst we have a drop of generous blood in our veins, to relieve him in turn, if he should want our assistance! and children, who owe every thing to their parents, have cost them so much anxiety, care and toil, shall they not act in the same manner? I shudder at the bare thought of such a thing: were I to see my fa∣ther incapable of paying what he owed, though he had not left me a penny, I should still think myself bound to fulfil all his engagements. I should consider it, as a duty of inheritance, in me, to acquit his memory, and preserve the integrity of his name. Though I were to live upon bread alone, to the last hour of my life, and be obliged to work the flesh from my bones, I would endeavour to pay all his debts; and when I had done so, I would go to his grave, and ad∣dress him thus: Father, now rest in peace, thou owest nothing.</P>

<P>Your husband really astonishes me, Martha. I was very sensible, indeed, that he was full of honour and probity; but to find him possess such elevated sentiments in the very depth of distress, is what I must own I did not expect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Martha.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have always seen him behave in the same manner, Sir, as you do now: in all transactions, his first object is, to find out the side of justice; and when he has found it, he adheres to it, and will support it with all, and against all, beginning with himself. However, he is no more than what he ought to be.</P>

<P>True, but then in the situation to which he is reduced, not to hesitate a mo∣ment!</P>

<P>Oh, Sir, you know but little of him; he would see us all without a morsel of bread, rather than have the least cause of re∣proach to himself; and that without appearing any way disturbed. He is never cast down; he is less the sport of fortune, than his fortune is of him.</P>

<P>Ah, Sir, you have seduced me into this, but why should I complain?

<P>No, my dear children, the ala∣crity which you have shewn in assisting your pa∣rents, has taught me, how worthy you all are to be relieved, in your afflictions: take back, then, all that you have given for them, but, make that use of it, to which your tenderness first prompted you.

Do you remember, Martha, how happy the good old man used to be? My children, he would say, this wine strengthens and chears me; but your affection, which makes you deny yourselves comforts for my sake, strengthens and rejoices my heart still more.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(taking Mr. Parks by the hand, and leading him to the window.)</STAGE>
<P>Come, Sir, and I will tell you the reason: do you see, near yonder hedge, an old apple-tree that has scarcely any leaves on it? My mother was saying, this spring, that she was very sorry that the frost had injured it so much, for she had never eat so good apples as it bore, in her life, and that the tree was likely to die; the next morning, before she was up, my brother and I went to pick out the most flourishing buds we could see, in order to en∣graft them on other trees in the orchard, that in
<PB N="171" REF="045437_0503_101FFDB6A677CF10"/>
case the old tree should perish, my mother might still have some good apples: had we left the farm, it would have been a sad thing; some∣body else would have come into it, and in time, have eaten of the fruit, which we had engrafted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing could be easier, than for you to have taken them with you, and then no∣body would have been benefited by your labour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why should I do so? that would have been no advantage; and though it were, I know very well, that we ought not to seek an advantage to ourselves, that would be a prejudice to our fellow creatures: on the contrary, I should have wished them, to gather good fruit from our trees.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>But did you not just now say, that it would be a sad thing, if others, should eat the fruit which you had engrafted?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>Undoubtedly it would be a sad thing to me, that my mother should be deprived of it; for though I wish good apples to others, I had much rather my mother should have them.</P>

<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is nothing like love and harmony in families. When my father and mother were living, all my study, night and day, was, how I should please them best. I would have carried them on my shoulders in their old age. I am amply rewarded: I see by experience,

<P>He has taken it into his head to finish his weeding, before night: I pressed him to come home with me, promising to assist him as much as I could in the afternoon, but he would not listen to me. I have bread enough left, he said, shewing me the half of his breakfast; I shall dine upon this.</P>

<P>Excellent lad! because I have not been in the fields to∣day, he wants to do my work.

<STAGE>Mr. Parks, Thorowgood, Martha.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thorowgood, you have no idea of the emotion that I feel this day, I see plainly; that children are the choicest blessings of heaven.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, when they are like ours; then indeed they are real blessings; and parents enjoy in them, a treasure inestimable. Oh, Sir, you cannot imagine how much the calamities of life are lessened, when our children assist us in supporting them, <STAGE>(clapping Mr. Parks on the shoulder.)</STAGE> Only cheer up your heart, Sir: in whatever part of the world your son may be, I firmly believe, that he will make your latter-days the happiest of your life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, were he but still alive, and of the happy disposition of your children! But why should I flatter myself with any such vain hopes? No, I have no longer any son to comfort me, in the decline of life. Happy Thorowgood, you may grow old; you will enjoy the delight, of seeing yourself revive in the five children, to whom you have given birth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>Five children did you say, Sir? No; pardon me, only four. <STAGE>(He reckons them on his fingers.)</STAGE> The little one that is asleep be∣hind the curtain, Lucy, George, and Jenny; these are all I have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the boy, who is in the fields.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is not my son, though I love him as much, as if he were so, and I have done
<PB N="174" REF="045437_0506_101FFDBC7308ED18"/>
for him, all that I could have done for a child of my own; and the worthy lad is deserving of all my tenderness: he loves us as much as if we had given him birth, and he works for our sup∣port, as if he were the eldest of my little family.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>And where is his family?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>That, we are as much strangers to, as you are; we saved his life when he was an infant, in the cradle: my wife suckled him, and he has always lived with us. He must not have been of common origin: he had round his neck, a coral, adorned with gold and jewels; and the linen he had on, was of the finest kind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>You preserved his life, you are ignorant of his family, and he is not of vulgar race! Ah, my dear Thorowgood, quickly tell me, how he fell into your hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a melancholy story: we then lived in the north of England; I rented a little farm there, on the banks of a river; it was an excellent situation, and the land yielded abun∣dantly; no thanks to the care of the former ten∣ant, though—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pass over these circumstances, pray, and only tell me all that relates to Valen∣tine; that alone, inflames my curiosity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, to come to the point at once: you must know, that one night we were roused from our sleep, by the water's rushing in∣to our house on all sides; we had hardly time to get upon the roof, to wait for relief there; in the morning, a boat came to our assistance: the whole country was under water; the river was covered with the ruins of houses and furniture,
<PB N="175" REF="045437_0507_101FFDBFB24B2710"/>
carried away by the force of the current. I was endeavouring to comfort my wife, who lament∣ed the loss of our cottage, but still more that of her son, who was stifled in the water before we awoke; in the mean time, I suddenly perceived a cradle, tossed about in the flood, which was running rapidly, and threatening every moment to swallow it up. I could not bear the fight: I threw off my clothes, and, regardless of danger, I plunged into the river, swimming with all my might towards the cradle. I was driven back se∣veral times, and almost exhausted with fatigue; but the cries of the child, which I heard as I ap∣proached, inspired me with fresh spirits and vi∣gour: in short, after much difficulty and dan∣ger, I got up to it, and brought it to the bank, a good way lower down. My wife followed me, creeping, more dead than alive, along the side of the river. I presented the infant to her, which continued crying, until she gave it the breast. Poor Martha fancied that she had recovered her lost child. We then made all possible enquiries to see if we could discover the parents, but we never could get any information: our affliction at length ceased; we continued to look upon him as our own son. I have related the whole story to the boy himself, a hundred time: I con∣cealed it, indeed, from my own children, to let them enjoy the pleasure of thinking him their brother, and to avoid all occasion of jealousy. I have had him instructed like the rest. He does his work, as well, as I can myself. He talks as if he were reading out of a book; and he can read and write as well as our school-master.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how long, pray, may it be since this happened?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>About fifteen years and a few months, as well as I can remember. But hold, I can tell you to a minute, for I had a memorial drawn up by the magistrate of the place, signed by the rector, and attested by the people, who were witnesses of the event. When I quitted the country, I took care to carry it with me. Go fetch it, Martha.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Martha.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is here in this little box, with the clothes and coral, which Valentine then had: we have kept them carefully, and put them by, this morning; because, if you, Sir, had sold our effects, it would not have been just, that what belonged to the boy, should have gone with them.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir, no, with your leave. Joy and surprise would kill my poor Valentine. He will be here presently. Step into this room until I have prepared him; he will be the better able to meet you, and you will be more compo∣sed.</P>

<P>Well, shall we have an end of this? the one is as great a fool as the other. Come, Martha, to divert you a little, seat the children, and bring us some glasses. <HI>Whilst Martha is engaged, he returns to Mr. Parks.)</HI> I told you, Sir, just now, that virtue never failed of a reward; here you see a proof of it. You had scarcely performed a good action, before you were instantly recompensed for it.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most willingly, my friend, as the recital can no longer distress me: I had been married a year, when a war broke out, and I received orders to proceed with my regiment to the West-Indies: my wife, notwithstanding all entreaties, would accompany me in that long and dangerous voyage, after giving birth to this dear boy, the only one that we have left. I had an uncle, a dignitary of the church, who lived near Durham; the infant was consigned to a nurse in his neighbourhood, that he might have an eye to him, and give us information about him. I received no account the three first years of my absence. Uneasy at so long a silence. I wrote to some friends in London: the most zealous of them visited the place, whence he acquainted me, that soon after my departure, a sudden inundation had ravaged the country, that my uncle, had fallen a victim to his intrepid exertions, on that calamitous occasion: that the house of the nurse, had been swept away by the flood, and that my son perished with her; this dreadful news oppressed me with sorrow, and
<PB N="185" REF="045437_0517_101FFDD8E9DCFAE0"/>
almost broke my wife's heart. At my return to England, I was restrained from making any researches, which appeared useless, lest my ill success should revive those bitter sorrows which time had somewhat alleviated.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, for six years that I have been your tenant, and might have put an end to your grief! I shall never forgive myself for hav∣ing suffered you to pine so long. I often told you of my happiness, why did you never mention your sorrows to me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>Could I have thought, that you alone were capable of terminating them! And besides, I must confess, that I endeavoured all in my power to banish these sad reflections from my mind. I was particularly fearful of reviving them in the company of my wife. This very morning, when you wanted to talk about your children, don't you recollect how cautiously I endeavoured to turn the conversation to other subjects?</P>

<P>Do not flatter yourself with that expectation, Sir; he will make you shed tears as long as you live, but they will be tears of joy only. You are far from knowing him yet suffi∣ciently.

<P>No, father, it is but right to tell you of what they perhaps would conceal; left they might again interest your generosity of heart; all my efforts were due to them, for their care and tenderness to me, in my infant years, and I had no merit in working for them; but as industrious as they are, my hands were necessa∣ry to them: if they lose my assistance, it is my duty to make them a compensation; there is but one method: luckily, it depends on the first fa∣vour I have to solicit at your hands, and you will not surely refuse me, in this joyful and happy moment; will you, father?</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not then begin to be so, by robbing me of the joy, with which I receive the present which you have made me. Is not a son a thousand times more valuable than the lands that I leave you? Speak; answer me. Would you give your own for any such consideration?</P>

<P>You have always the art to con∣found and silence me, therefore I will leave you to act as you please: it would be criminal in us to combat your kindness. <STAGE>(He turns to Martha.)</STAGE> This morning we were unable, my dear, to pay half our debts, and now we overflow with riches.

<P>Come, Thorowgood, drink a glass of wine, to settle them.</P>
</SP>

<P>An excellent motion, and I will second it. <STAGE>(After filling the glass round, he gets up, takes off his hat, and twirls it round his head,)</STAGE> Come, wife, come children. <STAGE>(Seeing George, Lucy and Jenny afraid to take their glasses.)</STAGE> Come, I say, this is a glass of gratitude; you must all drink it up. Yes, Martha, notwithstanding all your nods and winks, they must do it.</P>

<P>So much the better, my dear; I wish them to feel it in their heads, that they may always remember this great day. Let them drink deeply to the health of our benefactor. When they shall hereafter re∣flect on all that he has done for them, they will give him back, for every drop of wine, a thou∣sand tears of gratitude and tenderness. Excuse them, good Sir, they are not yet of an age to comprehend the boundless extent of your fa∣vours; but let them grow up: as long as they live, you shall be blessed by them and their chil∣dren.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>How could I deny you what seems to give you so much pleasure? yes, I a∣gree to it, for you, as much as for myself. I sti∣pulate, however, one condition, which I shall propose to Mr. Parks.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us hear what it is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have often told me that you and my lady wished for a little retreat in these parts, to pass the summer in. The neigh∣bouring land is to be sold: you may buy it, and build a lodge in your own mind; by these means, we shall have you near us for half the year. I would lay my life, that Valentine would grow melancholy, if he were to be always coop∣ed up in the city.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>What say you to this, my son?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Valentine.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should be heartily glad of it, I must own; I like dearly the air of the country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(with a smile.)</STAGE>
<P>Be it so then. You see, Thorowgood, I am more ready to comply with your desire than you were with mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because there is some differ∣ence; but I have not done: the ground is ex∣tensive enough to allow good gardens. Look
<PB N="190" REF="045437_0522_101FFE4CDD1D0C78"/>
at me, Sir. You do not yet know all that I am capable of doing: I was formerly a gardener, and have not yet forgotten my old trade. I take upon myself, to lay out the garden in such a manner, that people shall come far and near to view it as a curiosity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>George.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will undertake to dig the canals and trenches, to make the terrace, and plant the trees of your walk.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Martha.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I and my girls will make the borders, and plant them with flowers.</P>

<P>Oh, when shall we go to work?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Parks.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean, my friends? I must then till your grounds, whilst you are at work in my garden.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>I guessed that you would still be so unkind as to oppose me. Hear me, Sir; we shall be more expeditious in our work; and be∣sides, the best time for working in your garden, is precisely the season when there is scarcely any thing to be done in the fields. Though Valen∣tine be now a person of consequence, still, I hope that he will not refuse his assistance: his hands are used to the management of the spade; and to work for you, will be the greatest pleasure to him. Only let us have our own way: every one will work cheerfully, and the whole will be finished, before you have time to think about it. But here comes the worthy Humphries. What does he want? <STAGE>(He gets up, runs and takes him by the hand.)</STAGE></P>

<SPEAKER>Thorowgood.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, my friend, how happy am I, that I now have it in my power, to acknow∣ledge your honesty to me this morning! Consi∣der what you would have gained, by follow∣ing the advice of a bad man; for two paltry cows, which you might have retained, you would have lost a valuable friend: my little fortune would have made you mad, with envy and rage. On seeing me the owner of your tenement, you would have been in continual dread of being turned out by me, through revenge. That idea would have imbittered your life; in∣stead of that, you have now, in me, a friend that will stand by you on all occasions. It will give me the greatest pleasure to serve you. I can be∣gin this moment. I return you the two cows you sent me, and I hold you exempt from pay∣ing any rent for two years. <HI>Humphries, struck with astonishment, cannot utter a word, and stares at him open-mouthed.</HI></P>

<P>Heaven will bless you in your wife, your children, and all your undertakings; and for my part, I shall never think of you but with eyes overflowing with the tenderest tears. I already wish you happier than myself. I am only jealous of one thing; it is of the honour that Mr. Parks has done you, in dining with you. Hear me; I have a fat lamb that I was going to sell; it shall now serve to renew our friendship. Mr. Parks, you Martha, and your children, must all come and eat part of it to-morrow.</P>

<HEAD>ANTHONY AND HIS DOG.</HEAD>
<P>ANTHONY was the son of a poor labour∣er, a very honest man, but so extremely poor, that he scarcely possessed any thing in the world besides the few tools of husbandry, with which he earned a miserable subsistence. His wife was lately dead, after a lingering illness, which had been the ruin of his affairs. The grief that he felt on this occasion, would have broken his heart, had he not possessed the con∣solation of having still an only son, whom he lo∣ved exceedingly, as the child was gentle and sin∣cere, and in every respect endowed with the most amiable and happy disposition.</P>
<P>Young Anthony was passing one day before the door of a gentleman's house, when a servant perceiving him, called him into the court-yard, and asked him, if he was disposed to earn six∣pence. Yes, with all my heart, answered the poor child: What must I do for that?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Servant.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must take one of our dogs, put a stone round his neck, and throw him into the river.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Anthony.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poor thing! why do you want to kill him? Has he bit any body?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="195" REF="045437_0527_101FFF6C4F4076F8"/>
<SPEAKER>Servant.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, that is not the case: you shall see the reason presently.</P>
<P>So saying, he conducted Anthony into the sta∣ble, and shewed him in a corner, lying upon a wisp of straw a little dog that seemed just expir∣ing: his hair was all fallen off, and his whole body seemed to be covered with a horrible mange.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Anthony.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, the poor creature! He is in a very bad way indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Servant.</SPEAKER>
<P>And for that reason, my Lady wishes to be rid of him: there are other dogs in the house, and she is afraid that they may catch his disorder. If you have a mind to earn your six-pence, you have only to take him and drown him. I would not touch him myself for five pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Anthony.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why throw him into the river? Perhaps he may be cured.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Servant.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no likelihood that he will ever recover it. My lady's doctor has given him over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Anthony.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, no matter, still one may try.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Servant.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart: Do what you will with him, provided you rid us of him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Anthony.</SPEAKER>
<P>But shall I have the six-pence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Servant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! you mind the main chance, I see.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Anthony.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not ask it for myself, but for the poor dog. If I was rich, I could do with∣out it, but I am far from it: I have not always bread enough for myself, and he should not want while he is so ill.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="196" REF="045437_0528_101FFF6E0A1FACC0"/>
<SPEAKER>Servant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, it is a bargain: here is your six-pence.</P>
</SP>
<P>Anthony saw an old basket, that seemed to be thrown carelessly about the stable, and asked the servant to let him have it: he laid the dog in it, upon a wisp of straw, and hastened to his father, who was at work in a field at some distance.</P>
<P>As he went, he turned his eyes now and then on the basket. The disgusting appearance of his patient almost made him sick, but at the same time it excited his pity. Poor little creature, said he, you must be in great pain. Ah! I wish I may be so lucky, as to make you well: how∣ever, take my word for it, whether you live or die, I shall never throw you into the river.</P>
<P>His first care was to buy a small hot roll, of which he moistened the soft part, to make it the nicer; but all that the poor dog could do, was to lick it with the tip of his tongue: however, this refreshment, small as it was, served to keep up the strength of the sick animal, and the hopes of his little doctor.</P>
<P>Anthony's father was going to scold him, for not having come out sooner: but, when he learnt what it was that had detained him, in∣stead of being angry with his son, he was de∣lighted to see, that he had so compassionate a heart, and he kissed him for his good-nature.</P>
<P>Near the field, where he was at work, there was a pleasant meadow; thither, Anthony carried the little dog, shuddering with sickness, and laid him at the foot of a tree, to bask in the sun. His disorder proceeded only from a superabundance of humours, occasioned by the great quantity
<PB N="197" REF="045437_0529_101FFF72A46D5140"/>
of food, with which he had been usually stuffed. As soon as the sun had revived him a little, he crawled about the meadow, searching by his smell, for those herbs, which instinct pointed out to him, as proper for his cure: he had scarcely eaten them, before they relieved him considerably. Anthony quitted his work for a moment, to see how his dog went on: he was surprized, not to find him in the place where he had sat him, and still more rejoiced, to see him upon his legs: he took care to carry him to the same meadow, for eight or ten days successively, at the end of which, the poor animal was completely recover∣ed. He had never had so good an appetite in his life, as then. Anthony's six-pence was long since spent, in feeding him while sick, but now that he saw him re-established in perfect health, he did not grudge to share his own bit of bread with him. He had given him the name of <HI>Bonny,</HI> and perceived with satisfaction, that <HI>Bonny</HI> grew handsomer every day. His eyes, before so dull and languid, now sparkled with new life: his limbs recovered their usual nimbleness, and very soon his coat became as sleek, and as soft as velvet, and withal as white as the snow, when its virgin hue is heightened, by the dazzling beams of the sun.</P>
<P>The lady, to whom he had originally belonged, did not fail to hear very soon of his recovery and restored beauty: she sent her footman to offer Anthony two guineas, if he would let her have him again. Oh! no, replied Anthony, to the messenger; my lady would sentence him, to be thrown into the river again, if he should
<PB N="198" REF="045437_0530_101FFF75275E04A8"/>
happen to fall sick, but I will never forsake him. What are your two guineas, in comparison to the pleasure that I have, in seeing him faithful and affectionate to me? We are too fond of each other ever to part. Anthony was in the right. He would not have given his dog for an empire, but in return, his dog would not have quitted him, for the greatest monarch upon earth. He constantly followed his master, or else frisked before him, performing a thousand little gambols to amuse him. Whenever An∣thony after helping his father to dig, quitted his spade for a moment, and sat down under the hedge to take a slight repast, he had only to make a signal, <HI>Bonny</HI> forgot all his own pleasures, and ran to him full-speed: there standing upon his hinder legs, and wagging his tail to express his joy, he took from Anthony's own lips, the half of each bit of bread that he put into his mouth. Anthony, was often obliged to put up with a thousand wants, but he was never a whit the sadder on that account; his little fou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣footed-friend continued to give him new amuse∣ment every day, and kept him always in spirits.</P>
<P>Alas! he was soon to experience a great af∣fliction. At the end of autumn, the little boy sell dangerously ill: his father, laid out what money he had saved from his earnings, in pro∣curing his son the medicines, that were indispen∣sably necessary for his disorder. This sorrow∣ful pittance was soon exhausted; he then re∣collected the considerable sum which had been offered Anthony, by the lady, for his dog: two guineas would be to him a treasure, in his present
<PB N="199" REF="045437_0531_101FFF76B0F86080"/>
circumstances. He resolved, therefore, to men∣tion this proposal again to his son, but scarcely had he heard it, before he cried out, never, never; and his fever, redoubled the agitation, which so painful an idea excited in his mind.</P>
<P>In the mean time, his disorder grew worse, every day; violent fits of the cholic came on in addition to his fever, and increased his pains considerably. The anguish that he suffered, ex∣torted the most piercing cries from him, and oc∣casioned him to twist his body, and roll himself upon his wretched mat, for hours successively. On these occasions, his little dog would come, and crouch close by him, and fix his eyes on him, with the most significant air of compassion, as if he would have said, Ah! my dear master, I pity thee! Anthony, on the other hand, would look at him with reciprocal tenderness; and when his pains allowed him to speak, My dear <HI>Bonny,</HI> he would say, I must soon leave you: Alas! I saved your life, and you, poor creature, can give me no relief. Saying these words, he would shed a flood of tears, which <HI>Bonny</HI> would come and lick off from his burning cheeks.</P>
<P>There lived a gentleman in the neighbour∣hood, of the name of Dennison, who was both very rich and very humane. This gentleman, hearing of the boy's sickness, and the father's extreme poverty, came himself to visit them, in order, to assure himself, of the truth of the ac∣counts that he had heard concerning them, and at the same time, to relieve their distress.</P>
<P>When this excellent gentleman came to the the labourer's cottage, little Anthony was in a
<PB N="200" REF="045437_0532_101FFF78402B78E8"/>
most violent fit of his disorder; his father sat close by him, overwhelmed with grief. Hunger gave him no concern, though he had for several days before, lived upon very slight nourishment, barely sufficient to keep him alive. The sight of his son's sufferings, hindered him from at∣tending to his own. He endeavoured to comfort him, by kind and soothing words, and with his arm supported the child's drooping head, while the little dog standing over him, moaned pite∣ously, and strove by a thousand fond tricks, to catch a look from his master.</P>
<P>Mr. Dennison stood some time at the cottage-door, contemplating this sad picture. At length he advanced toward them, and was already at the foot of the bed, before they perceived him, or even, before the dog turned to bark at his ap∣proach; and when Anthony and his father, lifted up their astonished eyes, they saw his swim∣ming in tears.</P>
<P>My good friends, said Mr. Dennison, I am sorry to see you in this melancholy situation: I am told, Anthony, that you are not able to furnish the expence of supporting your son, as he should be, in his illness. That is only within these two days, answered the father: till then, I have been able to give my child bread, but now there is nothing left in this poor cabin, that I can part with for his support, unless, I sell the wretched mattress, that he lies on.</P>
<P>At these words, little Anthony stretched out his trembling hand upon his dog, and sighed heavily.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="045437_0533_101FFF7AC78504B0"/>
Poor child, said Mr. Dennison, do not be un∣easy; I will take care of you. Anthony, conti∣nued he, addressing himself to the father, your cabin is damp, and it will do your son no good to remain here while he is ill. Will you trust him with me? I will take him home with me, and have him cured. Trust him with you, Sir? Yes, that I will, and thank you for your gene∣rosity. It restores both of us to life again.</P>
<P>Mr. Dennison repeated his promise, and squeezing the little boy's hand affectionately, he took his leave, and went home to give orders for Anthony's reception. In half an hour after, came a stout footman, who, wrapping up little Anthony in a good warm coverlet, carried him in his arms to Mr. Dennison's house: his father followed him, with a countenance, in which, hope and joy seemed faintly endeavouring to disperse the long settled traces of his melancholy. As to the faithful <HI>Bonny,</HI> his countenance was fully expressive of the most unequivocal satisfaction: he jumped along, with his head held up, and his eyes constantly fixed on his young master, who, from time to time, opened his covering a little, to have a look at him.</P>
<P>Thanks to the generosity of Mr. Dennison, and the care of an able physician, little Antho∣ny's illness was soon cured. During the whole time that he was confined to his bed, his faithful <HI>Bonny</HI> kept him company: it was in vain that they would invite him to take a turn in the fields, if it were only for the sake of the air; he would not quit his master's chamber. All the ceremony that he would vouchsafe even to An∣thony's
<PB N="202" REF="045437_0534_101FFF7F3567E000"/>
father, was, to attend him when he was going away, as far as the first step of the stairs; then, all at once, he wheeled about, and came scampering into the room, and making a thou∣sand capers round the boy's bed.</P>
<P>At the end of a fortnight, little Anthony was able to set out for his father's. Mr. Dennison had given him new clothes from head to foot. Any one else would have found it difficult to know him in his new finery, but the eyes of <HI>Bonny</HI> were not to be deceived, and it may easily be supposed how great was his joy, when he saw his master walk out to the fields, and could frisk and gambol about him at his ease, once more.</P>
<P>The first word that old Anthony spoke, when his son came home, was the name of Mr. Den∣nison. Oh! my dear child, said he, had it not been for that worthy man, I should have lost you for ever: you see how happy he has made us: What shall we do to prove our gratitude to him?</P>
<P>Oh! father, I have already thought of that, but I can talk no more upon the subject at pre∣sent; and, so saying, he turned away his face, to hide the tears that gushed from his eyes.</P>
<P>He went to bed very early, yet sleep was a stranger to his eye-lids; he did nothing but toss about in his bed, and sigh heavily the whole night.</P>
<P>Next morning his father asked him what way he proposed to acquit his obligation to Mr. Den∣nison: the poor boy had not power to answer him, but pointed with his fingers to <HI>Bonny.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="045437_0535_101FFF81B4E561C0"/>
He immediately put his new clothes on, and went out, but it was visible, from the inward struggles which this effort of resolution cost him, that his whole stock of courage was exerted to put it in practice.<HI>Bonny</HI> accompanied him; he had never been so playful as that day: he frisked a∣bout with such sportive agility as to attract the looks of every passenger. Many envied little Anthony the happiness of possessing so handsome a dog; but the more joy and vivacity he shew∣ed, the more was Anthony dejected and melan∣choly. Ah! said he, you would not be so full of spirits, if you knew that we were going to part for ever: I chose rather to bear my illness, than sell you to procure myself medicines; I would sooner have died: but now, I must give you up to another, unless I chuse to shew myself ungrateful. Ah! my poor <HI>Bonny,</HI> my poor <HI>Bon∣ny!</HI></P>
<P>In the midst of these melancholy reflections, he found himself before Mr. Dennison's house; he crossed the court-yard, and entering, requested admission to that gentleman, who happened to be in the parlour. While he stood in the hall, his heart throbbed so violently, that he was in∣debted to the accidental delay of a few moments (owing to Mr. Dennison's being otherwise en∣gaged) for the recovery of his spirits. At length being called for, he took <HI>Bonny</HI> up in his arms, and entered the parlour. Worthy Sir, cried he, at the same time sobbing violently, I owe you my life: I have nothing that I can offer you in return but my poor dog: here I have brought him, Sir: it is not without regret that I give him

to you; but you would make me still more un∣happy by refusing to accept him.</P>
<P>Mr. Dennison, had a heart such as all men should have, who wish their own happiness, or that of their neighbours. The ingenuous dis∣course of the little boy made him smile; but he was not the less struck with the greatness of the sacrifice that he saw him prepared to make to his gratitude. He took him therefore by the hand, and said, No, my dear Anthony, I will not re∣fuse you; I accept your present with all my heart, and esteem myself fully repaid for every thing that I have done to serve you: but now that we are both quit, I make you a present of <HI>Bonny;</HI> he is your's, in return for the satisfaction that your gratitude affords me.</P>
<P>How, Sir—cried the boy, who was unable to proceed.</P>
<P>Yes, my little friend, replied Mr. Dennison: but one thing I request of you, and that is, not to insist any more in opposition to my desire: assure yourself, I am better satisfied than you can possibly be, at having it in my power to make you happy once more.</P>
<P>Anthony, who the minute before had been ready to swoon away through the violence of his grief, was now, on the contrary, almost over∣powered by his excess of joy: he viewed his be∣nefactor with an air of astonishment; he pressed by turns, his dear <HI>Bonny</HI> and Mr. Dennison's hand, which was still in contact with his. He wept, but his tears were those of joy and tender∣ness.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="045437_0537_101FFF8627A0CE50"/>
Mr. Dennison did not bound his kindness here. A place became vacant among his do∣mestics; he bestowed it upon old Anthony: as to his son, he had him carefully educated, and gave him a good trade. <HI>Bonny</HI> lived happily in the family. Ah! said Anthony to him, some∣times, when he fondled him, perhaps I owe all my happiness to thee. He loved him continu∣ally more and more, and, when the inhabitants of the village where he lived would speak, to this day, of two good friends, the names of Antho∣ny and his dog <HI>Bonny,</HI> are sure to be the first that occur on the subject.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Domville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my dear. He is a very skilful man. I have begged him to come here this morning to examine your teeth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gustavus.</SPEAKER>
<P>My sister's, I suppose; for I hope he will not think of drawing any teeth from me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Felicia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor from me neither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Domville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet I am strongly of opini∣on, my little friends, that he will be obliged to take one from each of you. You have a tooth, Felicia, that is quite loose; and I have observed two of your's, Gustavus, jammed so close, that one of them, the most forward of the two, must be drawn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gustavus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! pray mama do not say so. I have not too many, I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Domville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Enamel must decide that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Felicia.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it will hurt me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Domville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, my dear, I am afraid it will: but you must not be frightened; the operation is soon over: and even if it were pain∣ful, there is an absolute necessity for performing it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Felicia.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not see any necessity, mama, for hurting me. I do not like that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Domville.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe you, nobody likes it; but when we may gain a very great advan∣tage by suffering a slight pain that will soon be over, we should act ridiculously not to submit to it, without hesitation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gustavus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! for my part, I shall keep my mouth shut so close, that Mr. Enamel will be pretty cunning, if he looks into it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="207" REF="045437_0539_101FFF8C1361F9A0"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Domville.</SPEAKER>
<P>I advise you, master, not to speak quite so confidently. You will shut your mouth! a very sensible speech truly. Do you wish that I should look upon you as a coward that cannot bear the slightest pain? I should be ashamed, were I in your place, that a stranger should entertain such an opinion of me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gustavus.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I should, mama, but—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Domville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hear me one word. Do you think, my dear, that it does not hurt me to see you in pain! when you were so sick, do not you remember that I lost all desire of sleep or food, and that I was more unhappy even than your∣self? you may suppose then, when you see me determined on making you submit to a painful operation, that I have a very forcible reason for it. This is my reason. I should be sorry, while my children were young, that their teeth should grow irregularly, and so be obliged to be drawn at a time when they would never have any others, to succeed them. This is a matter of some concern to a mother who loves you, but I think it should be still more so to you, since it touches you more nearly. The matter is no less than, whether you are to have, all your life, a straggling and irregular set of teeth, or neat and well ordered. Felicia, do you understand what I have been saying to your brother?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Felicia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, mama; but will it hurt me much?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Domville.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot tell you exactly how much it will hurt you: this I know, that it is in your own power to make it much more supportable. Shall I tell you how?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="208" REF="045437_0540_101FFF8D9DD94028"/>
<SPEAKER>Felicia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! yes, mama, pray do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Domville.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is, by not making an inef∣fectual resistance, but submitting to the operation with a good grace: your brother talked of keep∣ing his mouth shut, if you should take it into your head to shut your's also, do you think that Mr. Enamel would not find a way to open it? You may assure yourself before-hand, that the more you would struggle, the more he would be obliged to hurt you. If tears and complaints could lessen one's pain, though they are marks of weakness, yet they would be excuseable; but when they are of no use in the world, and may even contribute to make the pain worse, I think it is a great disgrace, and the extreme of folly, to yield to such weaknesses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gustavus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, mama, how shall we ma∣nage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Domville.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is nothing more easy: I only ask you to sit quiet for a minute, and the whole business will be over: you were by, the other day when your father had a tooth drawn, did you hear him cry out?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Felicia.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is because my papa is twenty times stronger than we are.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Domville.</SPEAKER>
<P>True; but on the other hand, his tooth held twenty times faster to his jaw than your's do. A large full-grown oak is much more difficult to root up than a young oak-plant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gustavus.</SPEAKER>
<P>What pleasure <HI>can</HI> this Mr. Ena∣mel take in dismantling people's jaws?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Domville.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is not a pleasure to him, it is his profession, and a very useful profession too,
<PB N="209" REF="045437_0541_101FFF8F6659B7F0"/>
since the intent of it is, to relieve us from very acute pains.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gustavus.</SPEAKER>
<P>But since he is paid for drawing people's teeth, the more he draws, the more mo∣ney he gains: what if he were to pluck all mine out one after another?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Domville.</SPEAKER>
<P>He would gain more by leav∣ing you even those that are decayed; for then you would be obliged to have frequent recourse to him, either to clean them, or to keep them in order: whereas, with a little attention to them every day, you will perhaps never have occasion that he should touch them again. Look at mine, see if I have not contrived to preserve them with∣out the help of a dentist.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Felicia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had you ever any drawn, when you were as little as I?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Domville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly. I had a mother who watched tenderly over every thing that con∣cerned me. She spoke to me as I speak to you now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Felicia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you remember it: did you cry much?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Domville.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my dear, I can do myself the justice to say, that I did not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Felicia.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how did you do to keep from crying?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Domville.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was sensible that my crying would only serve to give my mother uneasiness, to make me appear to the dentist a very coward∣ly little girl, and to render me contemptible to myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gustavus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, mama, I hope I shall not cry.</P>

<SPEAKER>Felicia.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I, that am only to be a wo∣man?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Domville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Women have no less occasion for courage in supporting pain: nay, perhaps, the weakness of their frame requires to be strengthened with a greater degree of patience and fortitude. In order to be sure of finding this fortitude, when the greater evils of life oc∣cur, it is necessary to have it put to the trial on occasions of smaller consequence. I have taken early care to fortify you against the common ac∣cidents of life, such as bruises, or falls, or strains. It is time to fortify yourself against more acute pains. After all, I do not think, that on the present occasion you will suffer very much: your teeth are not firmly enough rooted to require a very violent effort to dislodge them. They are like a slender stalk of grass, that holds to the earth by very slight roots, and can easily be drawn up without damaging them. I thought it best to speak to you, without reserve, of the pain, whatever it may be, that will attend the operation; that if you find it more severe than you expected, you may have no right to accuse me of endeavouring to deceive you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Felicia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, mama, you know I always take your word.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Domville.</SPEAKER>
<P>It gives me the highest plea∣sure, that I have inspired you with confidence, and find you so tractable; for that reason I will not treat you like those silly children, who are promised cakes or play-things for letting them∣selves be eased of an useless tooth: I reserve for you a reward more worthy of you and me.

<P>Here am I, in London, and in perfect health; nevertheless, I am sad, very sad, I assure you. You will, perhaps, call me a silly child, when I tell you that I wept during our whole journey, whilst I thought on the last kiss that you gave me when we parted. But come, I will no longer trouble you with these complaints. I know how much you love me, why therefore should I afflict you?</P>

You might well boast of your friend Mrs. Grandison. She is so good and so gentle, that one must love her as soon as one sees her. She held forth her arms to receive me at my arrival, just in the same manner as you do when you are pleased with me; and then Mr. Grandison! I cannot express to you how amiable he is. He shall be my model; and then I am sure, when I grow up, I shall be esteemed by every one. My papa was, doubtless, such another; for you have often told me how worthy a man he was. Ah, would I possessed such a parent now! how hap∣py I should be! I would then, like young Gran∣dison, obey him in every thing: my whole heart should be filled with love for him, though I would not love you the less. But heaven has not permitted this. However it has left me a mother, and so good a mother!—Come then, I am not so much to be pitied; there are few children so happy. Every day do I thank God for this blessing, and implore him to preserve you to me: but, adieu, my dear mama; adieu, my little sister. I enclose for you, in this letter, a thousand kisses, and as many affectionate remem∣brances. Think of me sometimes. You are ever in my thoughts. Oh, when shall I see you again!

<P>YOUR letter, my dear son, has given me the most lively pleasure. The affliction which you manifest at our separation, proves to me that you have a heart of sensibility. The child who can bear an absence from his mother without concern, cannot love her: we must, neverthe∣less, listen to reason. We cannot always live together; and to abandon ourselves without re∣sistance to a fruitless grief, is a weakness, at which we ought to blush; learn therefore betimes to arm yourself with courage against the various events of life. The most happy lot is chequered with innumerable troubles, which we must ac∣custom ourselves to bear from our earliest youth. Whenever you feel your spirits dejected, because I am not with you, you have only to think of the pleasure that we shall both have when we meet at the end of the year, and this thought will afford you consolation: in the mean while we will write to each other as often as possible. To write, is almost to speak. You see by this, the benefit of those improvements, which your diligence has acquired. What would have be∣come of you now, had you neglected your stu∣dies! we should have been separated, without be∣ing able to converse with each other.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="045437_0547_10202AC2022B30E8"/>
You perceive Mr. Grandison is an estimable man, and wish to make him your model! You delight me, my dear child. Such a choice is the beginning of virtue. Yes, your father was such another man; and I am well assured that you know how to render yourself worthy the name of his son; and this is the sweetest consolation I have in my affliction for his loss.</P>
<P>Adieu, my dear William; embrace Mrs. Grandison for me. Give me a faithful account of all your occupations, and all your pleasures; but always write to me as if you were speaking: a letter ought to be natural, simple, and unstudi∣ed. Your little sister regrets your absence: she enquires after you a hundred times in the day; and complains that I am not so good a play-fel∣low to her as you were.</P>

My dear little boy, added she, since your mother has per∣mitted you to write to her, and enjoins you to give her an account of every particular which concerns you, you ought to omit nothing. Tell her of your studies, and of your amusements; and recount to her your conversations with my sons and my daughter: this will soften the pain of your absence. But, madam, said I, mama has always strictly forbidden me to speak of what passes in the family of another; she therefore only meant that I should speak of myself. Well, well, answered she, I permit you to tell her eve∣ry thing that passes in our house. I have not a dearer friend in the world than your mama. I should myself confide all my secrets with her; and I charge you to do it for me. Oh, mama, how much pleasure does this permission give me! How many things shall I have to tell you of my friend Charles! Yes, it is of him that I wish most to speak. You know how he abounds in understanding, in wit, in sentiment, in goodness: we are always together. I love him each day more than the preceding. His brother Edward, who is older by two years, is by no means so a∣miable; but the little Emily, their sister, Oh what a charming young lady!</P>
<P>Mrs. Grandison is just going to write to you, mama: she has asked for my letter to enclose in her's. I am sorry that I cannot chat longer with you: methinks I should never be tired of
<PB N="217" REF="045437_0549_10202AC805B0D538"/>

Nothing would be wanting to complete my felicity, if you were but here, mam∣ma, to see how happy I am. All our studies are but so many different pleasures. We learn drawing, dancing, and music; and we walk eve∣ry day into the country, to acquire the know∣ledge of plants. Mr. Bartlet, who is a very learned man, comes to see us two or three times a-week; and we learn a great deal from his con∣versation. I am every day more sensible what a sad thing it is to be ignorant: there is so great an advantage in cultivating the mind! and we have only to make our studies an amusement to us. Never fear; I shall not lose my time in this house: I have too good an example in my friend Charles. An emulation reigns between us, which does not lessen our friendship; but, on the contrary, we love each other the better for it. But I must leave off writing, for I am called to breakfast. Depart, then, my letter, and tell my dear mamma that I love her with all my heart. Say that I embrace her a thousand and a thou∣sand times.

<P>WHAT obligations do I owe you, ma∣dam, for having sent us your son! You have given me, by so doing, a friend for life. If you did but know how much he delights in talk∣ing of you, and with what tenderness of affecti∣on he speaks! He talks to me often also of his father. When he described his death to me, we wept together: how happy, said he to me yes∣terday, are you, to have still a father. How much is a poor child to be pitied, who is depri∣ved of his! Alas, it is to lose his dearest pro∣tection and best friend. How does it ever hap∣pen, that there should be children in the world who disobey their parents, and give them afflic∣tion by their vices! For my part, had I ever gi∣ven my father the least subject of complaint, I should never more have known a day of happi∣ness. But you have yet a mother, answered I. Yes, he replied, I have one who cherishes me as tenderly as I love her. She has redoubled her cares for me since the death of my father; can I therefore fail to feel for her a double portion of
<PB N="221" REF="045437_0553_10202AD25B82A5F8"/>
respect and love? Why, am not I already grown up? I would partake with her of her labours; I would assist her to support her griefs. So long as I live, will I convince her, by my tenderness, that I am not unworthy of her's. I was too much moved, to be able to make any answer: I could only embrace my friend. Ah, madam, he who honours his parents so truly, must needs be a faithful friend.</P>
<P>I cannot describe to you how diligent he is in all his studies. Mr. Bartlet is astonished at the progress that he makes: you must not, how∣ever, suppose that we are always serious. I as∣sure you, we know very well how to amuse our∣selves; and pleasure never appears so agreeable to us, as after business. We run about in the country, we play at cricket, and at all kinds of games which require activity and address. Our lessons, our exercises, and our pleasures, have all their stated hours; and I can assure you, they are well filled up.</P>
<P>I know not what you will think, madam, of the liberty that I have taken in writing you so long a letter; but I flatter myself you will par∣don it, since the subject of it is so dear to you: I will not, however, encroach too far on your complaisance. Vouchsafe, I entreat you, to ex∣cuse my prattle, in consideration of my friend∣ship for your son, as well as of the profound re∣spect with which I have the honour to be, madam,</P>

<P>ENCLOSED in this, I send an answer to the pretty letter which I have received from your friend Charles. I am delighted with what he has related to me of your sentiments toward me. Preserve them to me always, my son, and your mother will be ever happy.</P>
<P>I have some melancholy news to tell you: you know young Vanberg; he is just thrown into prison. A passion for play has been his destruc∣tion. He has almost brought his parents to ru∣in. It is not long, since they paid a considerable sum for him, on his promise that he would play no more: but he returned to it again, and his losses are enormous. There is no way left for his parents to extricate him out of his difficul∣ties, but by depriving themselves of bread. How unfortunate is this young man! You know how amiable he was, but for this terrible passion to which he has given himself up. Every one pitied him at first; but now he is despised by all. Oh, my son, place this example before your
<PB N="223" REF="045437_0555_10202AD9A01E59E0"/>
eyes, as a preservative against so shocking an evil. Mrs. Grandison has just written to me, and tells me, that you partake with her children, of those studies which they are engaged in. With what bounty, has heaven supplied to you the loss which you might have sustained, by your mo∣ther's want of means to give you those acquire∣ments suited to your birth. Be grateful to your benefactors, and ever bear in mind the duty that you owe them of profiting by their bounty which you can fulfil only by your application; lose not therefore one moment: the past hour will never return to us. What pleasure shall I feel, when I perceive the mind of my son adorn∣ed with useful knowledge! What charms shall I then find in his conversation! This hope sof∣tens the bitterness of our separation; let it serve also to support your resolution under it. Yes, my son, I have already told you that heaven has not destined us to live always together; but no∣thing will prevent us from loving each other, even should we be separated by a still greater dis∣tance. Adieu, my child; fulfil your duties; but without neglecting your amusements. It is your happiness only which can make mine.</P>

<P>WE are going into the country to-morrow, mamma. How I shall divert myself there Charles has just been packing up a num∣ber of books to carry with us. Our crayons are not forgotten. The whole country, as I am told, is one beautiful landscape: we shall exert ourselves to delineate it on paper. Little Emily carries her tambour with her, and intends to imitate with her needle, all the prettiest flowers of the fields. Though she is not yet twelve years old, she is ingenious to a wonder.</P>
<P>We are all three very glad to go into the country. Edward is the only one who dislikes it. I pity him. I think it a bad sign, not to love the air of the fields. I will send you word for word, a conversation which he had just now with his brother and sister, at which I was pre∣sent.</P>

<P>Well, but then his reproofs will serve to amend you. For my part, I think those who have the goodness to tell us of our faults, are our best friends: I esteem them much above those persons who flatter us.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was in hopes, at least, that we should be for a while released from this cursed Latin, but I find it is no such thing; and that we are to go on every day with our exercises, just the same as in town.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IX. WILLIAM DANVERS TO HIS MOTHER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>JUNE 15.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HERE we are, my dear mamma. What a pretty country-house! charming walks all around us. The park is very extensive; and from my windows I see a landscape, the extre∣mities of which, are too distant for the eye to take in distinctly. The gardens are laid out with a neatness which charms you at first sight. Charles has one to himself, in which he is at li∣berty to sow and plant whatever he pleases. He ran to it as soon as we arrived. And do you know what he has done, mamma? It is impossible for any one to be more noble or generous. He has given half a guinea to the gardener who took care of his garden during his absence. It was not necessary, to be sure, for him to make this present, as his father pays him handsomely: but the man has six small children. He is poor, and Charles is beneficent; I think therefore he did right: but Edward, it seems, thinks other∣wise. I must relate to you their discourse on
<PB N="228" REF="045437_0560_10202AE84B61D950"/>
the subject. Edward was by me: he saw the half-guinea in the gardener's hand. He ran up to his brother.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you mad, Charles, to give so much money to this man? Does not my father pay him for his labour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, brother; but see what care he has taken with my garden. He deserves a little recompence: besides, the man is not rich, and he has a large family. We surely ought to take pity on the distressed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true; but there is at least no occasion to give him more than his due.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, brother, if our papa were to give us no more than our due, that would be but a very little.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>And will you venture to tell him what you have done?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without doubt: I hope never to do any thing which I shall be afraid to tell him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will have a good chiding, I promise you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I promise you, he will not chide me at all. I have often seen him give money to the same gardener, when he has been pleased with his work.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>My papa gives his own money, but what you give, does not belong to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me, brother; it was the fruits of my oeconomy which I was permitted to dispose of as I pleased; and I am sure I could not make a better use of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>As if it would not be better to have purchased some squibs and crackers and have
<PB N="229" REF="045437_0561_10202AEB3A77E540"/>
made a little fire-work to entertain mamma on our arrival.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>The fire-works would have lasted but a moment; and after all, what are they? a sound, and a blaze: besides, they often cause ac∣cidents. No, no, my money will be laid out more usefully. The gardener will buy his chil∣dren some shoes with it; and the poor little ones will not be forced to run barefooted among the stones and briars.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(with a sneer.)</STAGE>
<P>And what is it to us whether these children have shoes or not? I do not see that it concerns us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>But it concerns them, brother, and that is sufficient. Heaven forbid that we should only think of our own wants, and take no care about those of others. Ah, dear brother, let us always pity the poor. They are our fellow-creatures.</P>
<P>Edward could not say a word in answer to this; but quitting us abruptly, began tormenting a cat that he saw asleep on the grass, a little way from us.</P>
<P>What do you say to all this, mamma? I am ashamed for Edward, and I love Charles more than ever. Mrs. Grandison, I am sure, will re∣ceive more pleasure from the generosity of her son, than she could have had from all the fire∣works in the world. Oh, if ever I should be rich, I will take care not to shut up my purse from the poor. It must be so great a pleasure to assist a man when he wants it. Adieu, my dear

<HEAD>LETTER X. MRS. DANVERS TO HER SON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, <DATE>JUNE 20.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I AM charmed with your last letter, my dear son. You have good reason indeed to prefer Charles' way of thinking to that of Edward. What pleasure must his good heart have felt in the joy of the honest gardener! a pleasure which will be renewed as often as he sees the shoes on the feet of the poor children. The best way to merit riches is, to employ them for the happiness of others. Mrs. Grandison has just sent me one of your drawings. I am charmed to see you so much improved by the instructions that you have had. If fortune should prove unfa∣vourable to you, painting is an honourable pro∣fession, not beneath the son of a colonel. It will, at least, be an amusing occupation, which, by pre∣serving you from idleness, will, at the same time,
<PB N="231" REF="045437_0563_10202AEE519FA090"/>
preserve you from those vices that idleness leads to. A love for the fine arts is the best guard in youth against the passions. The wish which you have so often expressed to receive some let∣ters from your sister, has put her upon many re∣flections. O mamma, said she to me last night, what a pretty thing it is to know how to write! When you read my brother's letters to me, it is just as if he were with us, as if he were talking to us. Pray, dear mamma, let me soon have a writing-master, that I may write to my brother; then it will be as if I were with him, as if I talk∣ed to him. She pressed me so much, that I pro∣mised her a master next month. She threw her arms round my neck; Ah, mamma, how learn∣ed I shall be! Yes, I will deserve this favour. But what shall I do in return for it? Learn well, my child, said I. But, mamma, to learn well is not for your benefit, but for mine. Then it is for mine also, answered I; is not the happiness of my children the same as my own? Ah, mam∣ma, replied she, but when shall I do something which shall be for you alone? Is not this pretty from a child of six years old? I took her in my arms, and pressed her to my heart. I embrace you, my son, with the same tenderness.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XI. WILLIAM DANVERS TO HIS MOTHER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>JUNE 25.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>AH! mamma, a great misfortune has hap∣pened to us. Edward has had the mis∣fortune to fall into the water. He is very ill, and so is Mrs. Grandison also. We are all full of grief; but you will see that Edward suffers from his own fault: he is very happy in having esca∣ped. Had it not been for timely help, he must certainly have been drowned. Yesterday, after dinner, not having finished his morning task, Mr. Grandison ordered him to stay in his cham∣ber to finish it: but behold his disobedience! he came down, notwithstanding these orders, and came after us: but I will relate the affair exactly to you as it happened.</P>
<P>We had been gone out about a quarter of an hour, intending to regale ourselves with some warm milk at a little farm-house not far off. We soon heard Edward, who ran after us, out of breath; we stopped to wait for him, concluding that he had obtained permission to be of our par∣ty: he joined us; and after having walked a
<PB N="233" REF="045437_0565_10202AF7047098C0"/>
few paces together, we met a little boy wheeling a barrow, in which there was a cask of vinegar. He was civilly turning out of our way, but by so doing, he overturned the wheelbarrow, and the cask of vinegar fell to the ground. The poor child was in sad perplexity, because he was not strong enough to put it back into the barrow, and he saw no grown person at hand to assist him. Charles, the good Charles, immediately ran up to him: Come William, come Edward, cried he, we must help this good little boy; we may surely find strength between us four to re∣place his cask. Oh yes, truly, said Edward, it would become us mightily to employ ourselves in such an office. And why not? said Charles: methinks it is never unbecoming to do a good action: but, however, you may stand by if you please; you shall see that we three will do it. We immediately went to work, and in an in∣stant the barrow was set upright, and the cask placed upon it, though Edward did nothing all the while, but sing, and laugh at us. The little boy was overjoyed, and after thanking us, went his way. Why Charles, said Edward, this is wonderful; it gives me pleasure to see that you would make an excellent vinegar-merchant. Well brother, said Charles, if I should be one, and should ever have the misfortune to let fall my cask, I shall be very glad to find any one good-natured enough to assist me. Well, you may laugh, said Edward, but what do you think papa would say, if he knew what you had done? He would love his son the better for it, said Emi∣ly. Papa is good-natured, and had he been in
<PB N="234" REF="045437_0566_10202AF88DC55460"/>
Charles' place, he would have done the same. Fie, said Edward, I blush for you both; it is ve∣ry pretty indeed for persons of our condition to meddle with the affairs of common people! Oh, said Charles, if they want us sometimes, we have much more occasion for them. We have assist∣ed this little boy, but who knows but his assist∣ance may be one day necessary to us?</P>
<P>You will see presently, mamma, that Charles was in the right.</P>
<P>We were scarcely got to the farm-house, when Edward proposed to us to go into a little boat, which was there floating in a small pond. Emi∣ly and Charles refused, saying, that their papa has expressly forbidden them. Pshaw, he'll know nothing of it, said Edward. But brother, answered Charles, we ought never to do any thing which our papa should not know. Very well, said Edward, then I will go and take a run in the meadow, for it is no diversion to me to be here. We thought that this was his design: but would you believe it, mamma, instead of go∣ing, as he had said, into the meadow, he made a turn round the house, and then went into the boat: about half an hour after this, we heard one cry out for help: we ran along with the far∣mer and his son; but what was our consterna∣tion, when we saw the boat overturned, and the unfortunate Edward hidden under the water. A little boy was dragging him by the skirt of his coat, but had not strength to get him out of the water: it was he who cried for help. The far∣mer immediately plunged into the water, and got them both out; but Edward was without sense
<PB N="235" REF="045437_0567_101FFD12C0D2B568"/>
or motion. Emily cried most pitifully. As for my part, I was so struck, that I could not speak. Charles was the only one who preserved presence of mind: he immediately gave orders to have his brother carried into the farmer's house, in order to recover him from his swoon. He then begged his sister to compose herself. I will go back to my papa, in order to prevent his being told abruptly of this unhappy accident. In the mean while take care of my brother.</P>
<P>Do not you admire these wise and tender pre∣cautions, mamma?</P>
<P>But what were the agitations of his parents when they heard his recital! Mrs. Grandison fainted: Mr. Grandison, after having given her the necessary assistance, ran to his son. They had just carried him into the house: every one thought him dead. In spite of all his firmness, Mr. Grandison could not forbear shedding tears. Oh! how well does a good father love his chil∣dren? he forgets all their faults, when he sees them in danger. After much pains, Edward was at length brought to himself: but he is still in bed in a high fever. Thus has he been punished for his disobedience; he has been at the point of losing his own life, and of being the death of his parents. This will serve as a lesson to me, to be always docile and submissive. Adieu, my dear mamma, you shall soon hear from me again. How many things have I to say to my little sist∣er, on the affecting scene she had with you, but I will reserve them for our correspondence.</P>

<P>MRS. Grandison is much better: Edward is nearly recovered, and I hope that this adventure will render him more wise in future. I told you in my last letter, of a little boy who saved Edward, by holding the skirt of his coat, but I forgot to tell you, that it was the little vi∣negar-carrier, whom we had just assisted in re∣placing his cask on the barrow. Charles said ve∣ry right, when he observed, that we know not what occasion we may have for the assistance of others. It must have been all over with Edward, if we had not chanced to assist this little boy; for had we left him in the road with his wheel∣barrow overturned, he would not have been in the way to have seen the accident which hap∣pened afterwards to Edward, nor to have thrown himself into the water to support him, whilst he called out for assistance. But I must relate to you a conversation which we had on the subject, yesterday, after dinner, whilst we were with Mr. Grandison in the sick-chamber of Edward.</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="045437_0569_10202B002C847048"/>

<P>No, I assure you, Edward. It is pleasure enough for me to see that you get bet∣ter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Especially when we think how near we were to lose you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is very true, had it not been for that brave little boy, it would have been all over with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Grandison.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very glad to hear you make this reflection, my dear: you now see, as Charles observed to you, that we cannot foresee how soon we may have occasion for the very per∣son who seems to stand most in need of us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are right, papa, and I feel much regret in not having assisted this little boy, who was afterwards to do me so great a piece of service.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Grandison.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am well satisfied, my child, that you are convinced you were wrong: you have only now to bear in mind your deliverer, and it may one day be your turn to render him a benefit. Till that time arrives, you may in some sort acquit yourself towards him, by assist∣ing all those whom you see in distress. You may also draw this very useful lesson from your misfortune, never to despise those who are be∣neath us in rank. What would a young gen∣tleman have done for you, had he been in the
<PB N="238" REF="045437_0570_10202B031D0C7278"/>
place of our little vinegar-carrier? He would, no doubt, have contented himself with calling out for help, without giving you any himself; and for fear of wetting his foot in the pond, he would have suffered you to perish before his eyes. Our little boy, on the contrary, more courageous and more compassionate, boldly threw himself into the water after you, at the hazard of his own life. You had a few mo∣ments before, refused him a little service, which would have cost you but a slight effort; and notwithstanding your unkindness to him, he was not afraid to risk his own life to save your's. You have never yet, and perhaps never may know another action which equals this. Ten∣der parents, a brother, a sister, a friend, all owe to this poor boy a beloved object which they were on the point of losing: society owes to him one of its children, who may one day be of use to it. Let us take care then not to despise our fellow creatures, in whatever rank fortune may have placed them, since little people may sometimes be of greater use to us than great ones.</P>
<P>My eyes were filled with tears, my dear mam∣ma, during this discourse of Mr. Grandison: I felt all he said, at the bottom of my heart. Oh! yes, I have often had occasion to observe, that the lower class of people are by much the most helpful when any accident makes their assistance needful: and those cannot be bad, who are thus disposed to succour their brethren.</P>
<P>Adieu, my dear mamma, we are to dine to∣morrow with Mr. Grandison's sister: it is seve∣ral
<PB N="239" REF="045437_0571_10202B04A708BCA0"/>
miles from hence. I am obliged to leave off. We must go to bed early to-night, in order to be up betimes in the morning. Edward cannot go with us, for which he is so sorry, that I really pi∣ty him: here again is another punishment for his fault. I will give you an account of our vi∣sit. Write to me, pray, my dear mamma; at least till my little sister is able to be your secre∣tary.</P>

<P>WE have had a great deal of pleasure, my dear mamma, at lord and lady Cam∣pley's. I wish you could have seen how well my friend Charles behaved in the midst of a nu∣merous company. Another young boy, about his age, was there also: what a difference be∣tween Charles and him! the latter stiff and af∣fected, perpetually bowing and admiring his clothes, at the same time so aukwardly bashful, that he could not look any one in the face. Charles, on the contrary, has a noble and mo∣dest
<PB N="240" REF="045437_0572_10202B079C04ED88"/>
assurance, together with the greatest ease and civility. He listens to others with attenti∣on, and speaks but little; but what he says is full of grace and justness, and every one hears him with pleasure. He distinguishes, to a nicety, what is due to every one in company. Respect∣ful towards his superiors either in rank or age, polite to his equals, and affable to his inferiors. He pays the most delicate attention to all, with∣out appearing ceremonious. I will give you an instance of this. We went to take a walk in the garden, a young lady of the company had for∣gotten her hat; she soon found the sun very troublesome. Charles quickly observed this, and before she could return back to the house for her hat, she perceived Charles bringing it to her: he asked her leave to put it on her head himself, which he did with all imaginable politeness: yes, I assure you, he is like a grown man, in compa∣ny. After dinner he played a very difficult piece on the harpsichord, and received the applauses of all. Oh! if I were but as amiable as he is, how happy should I be! were it only that I should give you more pleasure, mamma. The two daughters of lady Campley are very well brought up. The eldest, whose name is Charlotte, sings admirably: Emily loves her tenderly; they have engaged to write to each other.</P>
<P>But I must not forget to tell you of what hap∣pened to us on our return. Mr. and Mrs. Grandison, with Emily and a lady who accom∣panied them, went in the first carriage: Mr. Bartlet, Charles, and I, in the second: we had scarcely gone two miles, before we saw a poor old
<PB N="241" REF="045437_0573_10202B0BEE948B98"/>
man at the foot of a tree. Charles made the coachman stop, and turning to Mr. Bartlet, said, look, I pray you, Sir, at this old man: he ap∣pears to be blind, and there is no one near him: What will become of the poor wretch? Will you permit me to go and ask him a few questi∣ons? With all my heart, my dear, answered the worthy Mr. Bartlet. Charles immediately a∣lighted from the carriage, and ran to the poor man. Who are you, friend, said he; and how came you to be alone in this solitary place?—Alas! answered the blind man, I live above two miles from hence: I went out this morning to ask charity in a village somewhere hereabouts, I don't know on which side: and my guide, a ve∣ry naughty boy, refused to lead me home again, because I had not gathered money enough in the day to pay him as I used. I have no other hope but in Heaven, who perhaps, will send some one to my relief. But, said Charles, it is just sun∣set, and it will soon be night, and what will be∣come of you here? I must perish then in mise∣ry, answered the blind man: No, replied Charles, I will be that person whom heaven has sent to your relief. Oh! Mr. Bartlet, said he, coming back to us, do not deny me the delight of saving a miserable poor old blind man, who is on the point of perishing if we do not take pity on him. Night approaches; What will become of this poor creature if nobody assists him? He lives but two miles off, what hinders our taking him in our carriage? Yes, Charles, said Mr. Bartlet, follow the dictates of your ge∣nerous
<PB N="242" REF="045437_0574_10202B0D79915DA0"/>
heart. Charles had no sooner received this answer, than he took the old man by the hand, and put him into the coach. Any other besides my friend might perhaps have felt some false shame in riding by the side of a poor man in tattered clothes, but he, on the contrary, seem∣ed to think himself honoured by it. We had no occasion to go far out of our road to put this poor man into his cottage. I saw Charles slip some money into his hand as he went out of the car∣riage, and we parted after receiving from him a thousand blessings. On our return home, every body bestowed praises on this act of humanity. But, said Emily, this man, with his long beard and his rags, must have an odd figure in a cha∣riot. Ah! sister, said Charles, I had so much pleasure in giving relief to a distressed creature, that I did not think about his accoutrement. Mr. Grandison could not refrain his tears: he held out his arms to his son, who threw himself into them; whilst he tenderly pressed him to his heart. Oh! mamma, my eyes were filled dur∣ing this affecting scene. This chariot, will ever appear to me like a triumphal car to my friend.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIV. WILLIAM DANVERS TO HIS MOTHER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>JULY 12.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I THANK you, my dear mamma, for your kind letter: it is a long time since you have written to me; I feared that you were displeased with me. Do you know what I do? I always carry the last letter that I receive from you in my bosom, that I may have it at hand to read over again the good lessons which you always give me, and I seem to myself the better every time I read it.</P>
<P>Yesterday was Mrs. Grandison's birth-day; Charles rose very early; he was much longer at his devotions that day than usual; he was pray∣ing, no doubt, for his dear mamma, as I do for you on your birth-day. He appeared to us dressed in a new suit; you would have been charmed with his fine air: but before I pro∣ceed, I must go back a little in my narrative.</P>
<P>It is near a month since Edward and Charles had each of them a new summer-suit, which they had chosen themselves. Edward put on his the first day, but Charles continued to wear
<PB N="244" REF="045437_0576_10202B14E2DD8D68"/>
his old one, which was still however very neat. His father asked him the reason of this; he an∣swered, that he reserved his best dress for a visit of ceremony. Do not you perceive, mamma, that this visit of ceremony is that which he is to pay his mother this morning. How amiable is Charles! and what a fine turn of thought there is in every thing he does. Emily had already knocked at our door, and was waiting for us impatiently. We went down together, and found Mr. and Mrs. Grandison at breakfast in the saloon. Charles was the first who congratu∣lated his mother on her birth-day: he knelt be∣fore her, and respectfully kissed her hand. Oh! if I could but recollect all that he said! but I was too much moved to remember the words. Emily followed, and wished her mother joy in the most pleasing and graceful terms. Mrs. Grandison pressed her two children to her bo∣som, kissing them with tenderness. Their father then embraced them, whilst I made my compli∣ments in the best manner I could: they were at least sincere, for I truly love my worthy benefac∣tors. Edward came in just after: I know he loves his mamma: Who, indeed, does not love her? but yet his manners do not please me like those of Charles. The one does every thing in a more agreeable way than the other. Mrs. Grandison made every one of us a present. Emi∣ly received a pretty pair of bracelets, Charles and Edward had each a watch. Would you be∣lieve it, since yesterday only, Edward's is already out of order! as for me, my dear mamma, I have a fine microscope: this is of more value to
<PB N="245" REF="045437_0577_10202B17D1972898"/>
me than all the toys in the world. Oh! the good Mr. Grandison! how have I merited this gift?</P>
<P>In the evening we had a large company from all the neighbouring houses: Charles did the honours of the table like a grown man. He carved the meat, he filled the glasses, he served the ladies; in a word, he acquitted himself of this employment to admiration. Here is a very long letter, mamma, but I am talking of my friend, and to you: no wonder then, that I know not when to conclude; and I cannot do it now, without sending a tender embrace to my sister, which she shall give back to you.</P>

<P>EVERY day here brings new pleasures with it, my dear mamma. Your son is now become a gardener. Will you lend me your as∣sistance, said my friend to me the other day? I want to turn up afresh the ground in my garden: the flower-season is passed, and I have a mind to
<PB N="246" REF="045437_0578_10202B1AC506DD80"/>
sow some sallad to regale my mamma during the remainder of the summer. Will I? said I, yes, certainly; you always oblige me when you give me an opportunity of doing any thing for you. We dressed ourselves in light waistcoats, and each being equipped with a spade, we cleared the garden that very evening. We gathered up with care all the roots, in order to put them un∣der ground before we went away. Yesterday we rose at five in the morning: we do not al∣low ourselves to sleep late, because we cannot transplant any thing during the heat of the day. This morning we returned early to our work, and had the pleasure to finish it before breakfast. We only wait now to see our roots and our seeds spring up, and we shall employ this inter∣val in extirpating the weeds. What pleasure we shall have in seeing our plants grow up! Hi∣therto I have, like other children, seen the pro∣ductions of nature without paying any attention to them: But Charles has taught me to make re∣flections on all that I see. I will give you an example of this, in a conversation which we held yesterday. I do not know whether I ever told you that Charles had a pretty aviary filled with all sorts of birds, which he takes care of him∣self. We had just finished our gardening, and were taking a walk with Emily; stop a mo∣ment, said Charles, I must leave you, I have not yet looked after my birds to-day.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are in the right; we ought cer∣tainly to think of these poor little animals, since they are taken out of that state in which they might provide for their own wants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>But would it not be better to let them fly away than to keep them prisoners here? We only confine those who have done wrong to o∣thers, and surely, these little birds have hurt no one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, they have not; but they are not unhappy in their cages. Had they indeed ever enjoyed their liberty, I should have taken care not to deprive them of it: but they were born in their prison; and I would lay a wager, if we were to open it, they would be afraid to fly out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="248" REF="045437_0580_10202B1F40C0F670"/>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nevertheless, they see other birds fly about at liberty in the air. What should we think if we were shut up thus?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, we should think that it is ve∣ry agreeable to be at liberty, and a very sad thing to be a prisoner. But these birds have no idea of this difference; provided you give them sufficient to eat and drink they are content. They enjoy what they have, without thinking of what they have not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very glad to be made easy on this head. My aunt Campley has promised me a Canary-bird, and I intended, as soon as I re∣ceived it, to let it fly away; but you may come now, my pretty bird; I will take good care of you; you shall have plenty of seeds in your cage, in spite of the winter, when other birds can scarcely find any under the snow.</P>

<P>CHARLES, Edward and I, dined yesterday at Mr. Friendly's. He has a son about our age, with whom we were very happy. You shall partake, my dear mamma, of a conversa∣tion which we had on this subject at our return. Emily came to meet us, and asked, with a pleasant air, if we had spent our day agreeably.</P>
<P>Yes, my dear sister, answered Charles, but it would have been more so, had you been of our party.</P>

<P>You are very good, brother; but, Edward, you don't seem very well pleased with your visit.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>What business had he, to make a parade to us of his knowledge in natural philo∣sophy) What would you say, if I were to talk to a young lady about the beauties of the Latin tongue? would it not be very unpolite on my part?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Doubtless, because you know, she is not brought up to understand that language. But young Friendly could not but suppose that we were as well instructed as himself, for I be∣lieve him too modest to wish to humble us; and he only meant to entertain us for a moment with his electrical experiments. I own they gave me the more pleasure, because it appeared to me, that this kind of knowledge was not above the reach of our capacity; and it has inspired me with fresh ardour, to make myself acquainted with all those sciences which have the study of nature for their object.</P>

<P>This is no joke, brother; there have been people much above us in condition, who have fallen into poverty. Though, I hope never to have occasion, for the art of turning to gain a livelihood, it is, nevertheless, an amusing occupation, and gives handiness and ingenuity. I shall take it up sometimes by way of relaxa∣tion, when I am tired with study.</P>

<P>Oh, my dear mamma, if you were but rich enough to give me a turning lathe: but do not let this disturb you; I shall have the use of my friend Charles'. Young Friendly turned before us an ivory box, which he gave to me. I send it to my little sister till I can make her one my∣self.</P>

<P>MR. and Mrs. Grandison are gone to spend a few days at a friend's house; and Mr. Bartlet is just set off for London: we remain, therefore, my dear mamma, by ourselves, with only an old waiting woman, and a small number
<PB N="252" REF="045437_0584_10202B2B57ACF960"/>
of the domestics. Emily manages every thing in the absence of her mother: yes, indeed, she gives orders to all, and with as much discretion as if she were twenty years of age. Is not this very pretty in so young a lady? She is not yet twelve years old, and the servants respect her al∣ready as if she were their mistress. Do you know why? it is, because she always treats them with kindness, without descending to familiarity. She follows in this the example of her brother Charles. You cannot imagine how much he is beloved and honoured by all the people in the house. Edward, on the contrary, is always at play with them, and yet they cannot bear him. It is true, he is continually playing them malici∣ous tricks, and frequently treats them with in∣supportable haughtiness. Oh, that he had but gone with his papa and mamma: now that they are no longer at hand to check him, there is no keeping him in order. Charles, Emily, and I, follow our agreeable studies in the same man∣ner as if Mr. and Mrs. Grandison were here: but Edward takes advantage of their absence to spend the day in trifling, and running about the fields. Nay, he even tries to divert us from our studies, as if he thought our application a re∣proach to idleness. We were all yesterday morn∣ing in one corner of the room busy at our draw∣ing. Edward amused himself with a fly at the end of a thread; and under pretence of follow∣ing it, came up to us, and jogged our chairs, in order to hinder our business. Emily, carried away by her vivacity, was going to rebuke him smartly, but Charles prevented her; and address∣ing
<PB N="253" REF="045437_0585_10202B2FA912DCB0"/>

<P>This is always the way: you ne∣ver like to do what I desire you.</P>

<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, brother, we are not; and though Emily is very right in what she says, yet, to shew you that I do not always refuse you, here I am ready to follow you. I will finish my drawing another time. Let us go into the gar∣den. It is always a pleasure to me to oblige you.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="045437_0586_10202B3134A2D698"/>
They were hardly got to the end of one of the walks, before a heavy shower fell, which o∣bliged them to come in again, to the great regret of Edward. Charles, in order to console him, proposed that we should amuse ourselves in read∣ing a little ancient history. I want none of your books, replied Edward, surlily: I am to be an officer: I have no occasion to be a learned man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and do you think that the knowledge of history will be useless to you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>A pretty officer, indeed, who can talk of nothing but bombs and cannons!</P>
</SP>
<P>Edward made a face at his sister, and wanted to oblige us to play at puss-in-the-corner, and to take John to make a fifth. But Charles, who, with all his sweetness of disposition, is capable of the greatest firmness, answered him, No, bro∣ther, it was not my fault just now, that I did not gratify your humour, but the rain prevented it. I then proposed to you another amusement, which you might have been satisfied with, but you did not approve it, though my sister and my friend are very well pleased; I think, therefore, I may give way to a reasonable taste rather than to your caprices.</P>
<P>Edward, who knows very well that his bro∣ther is not easily turned from his resolution, left the room grumbling; and, in spite of the rain, ran into the court to play with a great mastiff, whom he is grown very fond of, for the sake of teazing him. He did not return in less than an hour, almost wet to the skin, and covered from head to foot with dirt. As for our part, during
<PB N="255" REF="045437_0587_101FFD112EF149C8"/>
this interval, after having read the life of Epa∣minondas, which had given us infinite pleasure, we had time also to take up our drawings and finish them. An opportunity happened after dinner, to send them to Mr. Grandison, and this morning we have had the pleasure of hearing that he was very well pleased. But what must he think of Edward, who has sent him nothing? I am quite afflicted at this. I would give any thing in the world that he were as good, as amiable, as diligent as his brother; then nothing would be wanting to complete the happiness of his parents. I see with regret how much pain he causes them. Oh, my dear mamma, may I never see the day in which I shall give you pain! No, no, be as∣sured I never can, whilst I think of your tender∣ness to me. I am too sensible of what I ought to be, to render myself worthy of it. I dare even promise that I will never give you cause for any thing but satisfaction: I expect that my little sister will give you the same assurance, and I embrace her tenderly for this good resolution. Adieu, my dear mamma.</P>

<P>ONE of the servants of the house is ill. You will see whether it be possible to have a more feeling and compassionate heart than the good Emily. She arose this morning by break of day, in order to give a medicine herself to the poor sick maid. She could not rest till she had seen her take it entirely, because it was strictly ordered by the physician. One would think to see her, that it was a beloved sister whom she at∣tended. How amiable it is in a young lady, to have so much humanity! Edward, as usual, had some fault to find. It becomes you much, said he, to wait upon your own servant. And why not, brother, answered Emily? do not you play at nine-pins with them? If it be their duty to serve us whilst they are in health, it is equally our's, to take care of them in sickness: besides, poor Peggy has frequently watched over me du∣ring the ailments of my infancy. What I now do for her is at least no more than she has done for me: and I think of the pleasure that I
<PB N="257" REF="045437_0589_10202B3A18533FC8"/>
should feel, were I in her place, in every mark of attachment shewn me. Edward felt himself ashamed, and left the room hastily. Ah! said I to myself, Emily does not know what I have seen my dear mamma do. When our poor Nanny had a fever, it was mamma that took the whole care of her: but this recollection brought a sorrowful thought with it. There is such a number of servants in this house! and you, my dear mamma, have but one to do every thing for you. How unfortunate is this! You must needs be forced to do a number of things very ill-suited to the widow of a colonel. And then, if my sister were but big enough to assist you! But no, she only encreases your trouble: and I, what do I do here; instead of being with you to comfort and support you with all my power? This reflection cuts me to the heart. There is only one thing which softens it; it is the hope, that by attending to my education, I may, one day, be in a situation to put an end to your troubles. What new courage does this sweet hope give me! Adieu, my dear mamma. I embrace you with tears of joy and sorrow.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, <DATE>AUGUST 6.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>HOW I love your young Emily! Yes, my dear son, there is no virtue more amiable than humanity. It were much to be wished, that every young lady would follow this fine ex∣ample; and instead of tormenting the servants, would learn to treat them with goodness. How is it possible to be insensible to the pleasure of being beloved by those who surround us?</P>
<P>But why are you afflicted, my dear son, at my having but one servant? it is no happiness to have a multitude of domestics; there is more of shew than real use in it. Every servant in a house announces some additional want in the master or mistress of it, and subjects them to ad∣ditional cares. Had I the means, I should, no doubt, have about me those attendants which my situation in life would require. I should look upon this as a duty, as it would be the means of giving support to many poor people, who might otherwise want employment. But since Heaven has not thought fit to afford me riches, I do not think that I am to be pitied for having
<PB N="259" REF="045437_0591_10202B416D953468"/>
only a single domestic: it is as much as is neces∣sary. I have no occasion for more attendance than her's.</P>
<P>And now, my dear child, tell me what are those occupations which you say do not become the widow of a colonel! You certainly did not reflect on what you were saying. There is no disgrace in serving ourselves, when we are not in a condition to pay for the services of others. Will it not be better, after my death, that you should have it to say; my mother herself prepar∣ed our simple repasts; our clothes were the work of her hands; scarcely could she procure for us what was necessary, but nevertheless, she owed no one any thing; than to have this reproach thrown on you; your parents, it is true, lived according to their rank and birth; they had a superb house, magnificent furniture, a train of domestics, but all this is left unpaid for. What, in such circumstances, would be the son of a co∣lonel? a despised young man, who notwithstand∣ing his own innocence, would be stigmatized for the faults of his parents, whilst a man of honour, of the most common birth, would scarce ac∣knowledge him as his equal. What I have now said to you, will, I hope, put an end to your concern on my account, because it will shew you that I am perfectly satisfied with my destiny.</P>
<P>As for the rest of your letter, my dear son, the sensibility of your heart, and those affecting marks of tenderness with which it is filled, made me shed tears of joy. Were I still poorer than I am, I should think myself rich in the possession
<PB N="260" REF="045437_0592_10202B666CB3CD48"/>
of so virtuous a son. Adieu, my dear child; continue to follow the dictates of your happy disposition, and you will ever be the consolation of the most tender of mothers.</P>
<P>Your little sister was touched in the most live∣ly manner by your letter; and I have remarked, that she has ever since redoubled her application and docility. Oh! my children, may you always thus encourage each other in the practice of your duties!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXI. EMILY GRANDISON TO HER MOTHER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>AUGUST 7.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WE have been in the greatest consternation this night, my dear mamma. The house of our neighbour, Mr. Falston, is entirely burnt down. What dreadful flames! The sky was as red as blood. My heart beat: I wept. It is such a melancholy thing for the father of a family, to lose all his substance! What strict precautions ought we to take against fire, since one moment may produce so terrible a mis∣fortune! It was the Miss Falstons who were the cause of this. Yesterday evening, unknown to any one, they got some lighted coals out of the kitchen, and carried them up into a little spare-room, in order to toast a crumpet, which they had procured in secret. A little while after, they heard their papa call them: hastily eating up their half toasted-crumpet, they ran down to him. Their bed hour soon came, and they went up into their apartment, without thinking any more of the lighted coals, which they had left in the little room. The fire, doubtless, first
<PB N="262" REF="045437_0594_10202B6DB0EB25C8"/>
took hold of the wainscot, and from thence the floor and the furniture. In short, about two o'clock in the morning, whilst all the family were asleep, the whole house was in flames. See, mam∣ma, how heaven has punished them! For the sake of eating a paltry crumpet, they have reduced their father's house to cinders! Now they lament; they ask pardon: they are almost dead with grief: but does all this avail? The fire has con∣sumed their whole property: they could neither save furniture, papers, or money. Scarcely could the young ladies escape with only a slight cover∣ing over them: and Mr. Falston himself, was near losing his life. He is terribly burnt in many parts of his body; and must have perish∣ed in the midst of the flames, had it not been for the courage of one of his servants. What will now become of the pride of these young ladies? Yesterday so rich, to-day so poor! They treated the peasants with contempt, because they had not fine houses. To-day they feel it as a favour, that these very peasants will, out of pity, receive them into their cottages. In how short a time may pride be humbled!

<P>This letter is already so long, that I fear to be troublesome to you, my dear mamma: never∣theless, though I hardly dare tell you what I have done, I have yet something to say to you. Will you pardon your Emily? Oh, yes, you are so good and so compassionate! The poor Miss Falstons have lost all their clothes in the

fire. Not one thing saved. I have sent the youngest, who is about my size, one of my gowns and some linen. I could wish to have sent her more; but all that I possess belongs to you; I therefore cannot dispose of it, without your consent. I must entreat you to approve of the liberty that I have taken; and I promise in future to be the better oeconomist for it. You have no occasion to replace what I have given. Thanks to your goodness, I have enough left. Adieu, my dear mamma. Embrace my papa for me: and both of you be assured of my re∣spect and tenderness.</P>

<P>I Take the liberty, my dear papa, to make an humble petition to you, in behalf of an un∣fortunate family. Can this emotion of my heart displease you? No, I do not fear it: your own is too full of goodness and compassion!</P>
<P>You have been informed, by Emily's letter to mamma, of the cruel misfortune which has be∣fallen Mr. Falston; but not the whole of it.
<PB N="264" REF="045437_0596_10202B7229D22188"/>
Emily could only tell you of the house and effects; but he is also on the point of losing his last shilling. He has creditors, who forbore to press him, whilst he was rich; but now that his security seems doubtful, they insist upon pay∣ment, without delay, and have already threatened him with a seizure of, all his property. On a visit, which I paid him, I heard him say to Nel∣son the attorney, that all his debts did not amount to more than two hundred pounds. This is but a small sum. Must he, for want of this, after having suffered so terrible a mis∣fortune, be deprived of the only means left him of breeding up his family, and be himself a prey to want, in his old age? Heaven forbid that we should suffer it! Now, papa, I'll tell you what I have thought: the legacy which my uncle left me, is, you know, five thousand pounds. I think this a great sum. It is in your hands, and you may dispose of it. I surely may give up two hundred pounds to extricate an honest man from such an embarrassment. I shall be rich enough after, as you have the goodness to add, every year, the interest to the principal of this legacy. I entreat, papa, that you will not re∣fuse my request. It gives me a thousand times more pleasure than the two hundred pounds ever can. Oh! if I should but preserve from in∣digence an unhappy man, and his two children, what a happiness this will be for me! Permit me to resemble you on this occasion, you who are so beneficent. Do not you instruct me to be so? If you were here, I would throw myself at your feet: I would ardently supplicate—
<PB N="265" REF="045437_0597_10202B76837CCE98"/>
But there is no occasion; your wisdom must de∣cide on my request. My duty is a blind sub∣mission to your will; a profound respect for your virtues, and the most tender love for your person.</P>
<P>Vouchsafe, I beseech you, to present to my mamma my most lively sentiments of respect and tenderness.</P>

<P>YOU say, my dear son, that you have learn∣ed of me to be beneficent. I have, with∣out doubt, always laboured to render your heart sensible of the misfortunes of your fellow-crea∣tures. The love of our brethren, besides the hap∣piness which it yields us, is, of all things, what renders us most acceptable to the supreme Being. The petition that you make me is a proof of the generosity of your heart; and so laudable a re∣quest deserves its recompense. The sentiments by which I see you actuated, are to me far more valuable than two hundred pounds. You will

find enclosed, a Bank-bill of that sum. Fly then, and soften the distress of the unhappy Fal∣ston; and, at the same time, enjoy the noblest delight of a great soul. But as for your uncle's legacy, that, neither you or I can touch, before you are of age. I hold it as your guardian, not as your father.

You will find, in my wardrobe, a piece of stuff, which I meant for a gown for myself: it will be enough for both the young ladies; and, if I judge right of the heart of my Emily, she will have more pleasure in this destination of it, than had I made it in her favour. Adieu, my dear child; never forget the lesson which you

<P>I Hasten, my dear father, to answer the kind letter that you have honoured me with. You would have wept with tenderness, as I did, could you have been witness to the testimonies of gratitude which Mr. Falston has lavished up∣on me. Whilst he embraced me, I saw the big tears fall down his cheeks. How sweet must these tears have been to him, since I found my own so delightful: but I ought to give you an account of all that I have done; here it is: you know Mr. Falston has naturally some pride; it
<PB N="268" REF="045437_0600_10202B7F599BFFF0"/>
would have been too humiliating in his circum∣stances, to receive an assistance which might have had the air of a charity. I presented him therefore with the Bank-bill, not as a present, but as lent to him, and which he might pay a∣gain at his own convenience. He would give me an acknowledgment, which I received, but im∣mediately tore it before him, telling him, that his word was enough, to let him see that he would not be liable to any further trouble on this sub∣ject. I should have liked it better, could I have slipt the note into his snuff-box, that he might never have known from whence it came; but I could find no opportunity.</P>
<P>Oh! my dear papa, what a delightful enjoyment have you given me! and how do I long to throw myself at your feet, to thank you as I ought!</P>
<P>Pray tell mamma that Emily has fulfilled her orders. She has deprived herself of two hour's amusement to put her own hand to the work: and now, thanks to her activity, the work women have finished the two gowns in a day; and Emi∣ly is just going to send them. With what im∣patience do we expect the moment, which will bring back to us, parents, so worthy of our duty and affection.</P>

<P>OH! my dear mamma, poor Charles has met with a sad accident! his leg is scalded so badly, that he is not able to walk: it is all owing to Edward's aukwardness; he threw a tea-kettle of boiling water over him. Never, no never, was seen such patience and goodness as my friend displayed on this occasion. Any one else would have been in a passion with his brother, and have loaded him with reproaches; but Charles, on the contrary, only sought to conceal the pain which he felt. Do not afflict yourself, Edward, I be∣seech you, said he, it is not very bad: but we soon perceived that he suffered more than he was willing to confess, for his leg became so much swelled, that we were obliged to cut off his stocking with a pair of scissars. Emily burst into tears:
<PB N="270" REF="045437_0602_10202B83D55D5470"/>
see, said she, to Edward, what you have done by your heedlessness; you have, perhaps, lamed your brother for the rest of his life. I wish this misfortune had befallen you, instead of him. It had better have happened to no one, said Charles, interrupting his sister. But come, my dear Emi∣ly, this is not worth so much concern. I shall soon be cured: Edward did not do it by design; it is a misfortune; but had it been still greater, we must have consoled ourselves. No, replied Emily, I cannot forgive his want of care: look at him too; he stands there like a post, instead of flying to send for a surgeon. There is no occasion for one, said Charles; give me only a cloth and some cold water to bathe my leg, and in a few days it will be well. But, said he, addressing himself to Emily and me, Mr. Bartlet will soon be here; I beg you will not tell him that Edward had any hand in this accident; and you, my dear brother, give me your hand; your affliction is more painful to me than this little burn, of which I now scarcely feel the smart.</P>
<P>What a happiness it is to be thus master of one's self! We may well admire Charles, when he can behave in this manner: at the same time, I feel, how useless it is to fret and be impatient, and that being transported with anger will not remove the evil.</P>
<P>But the pleasure which I have in writing to you, makes me forget that Charles has intreated me to keep him company. Adieu, my dear mam∣ma; permit me to leave you to return to my friend. I salute my little sister, and conjure her
<PB N="271" REF="045437_0603_10202B86D1019B70"/>
by our friendship, to take care not to burn or scald herself: she will find her advantage in this proof of love which I require of her.</P>

<P>ALAS, poor Charles! It is now two days since his leg has been extended on a cushi∣on: I believe he suffers much, but he persists in keeping it to himself.</P>
<P>Emily asked him yesterday, if he did not find himself very sad, under his confinement. Why should I make myself so, answered he, it would only aggravate the pain that I suffer; I had much rather amuse myself with the hopes of being soon cured: besides, would it not be a shame if I could not comfort myself under so small a mis∣fortune as this? I have reason to expect many greater in the course of my life, and these slight accidents will teach me, in time, to exercise my courage and resolution against the approach of greater. But it is very hard though, said Emily,
<PB N="272" REF="045437_0604_10202B8B25D14640"/>
to be forced to suffer so much for the fault of another. It is true, answered Charles, I had ra∣ther it had been by my own, for then my brother would not have had so much uneasiness about it.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>But are you not weary of staying so long in your chamber, without daring to move?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can I be wearied, when I have the happiness of receiving so many affecting proofs of your kindness to me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is your goodness, my dear brother, which makes you pay attention to them: but you have narrowly escaped losing your leg by this accident.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>This ought to console me under it. I have much reason to complain, indeed, when I see so many people condemned to walk on crutch∣es their whole lives!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>I really believe brother, you would have found out the secret of comforting yourself, even if it had been necessary to cut your leg off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is needless to say that I should have been much afflicted at such a misfortune, but as it could not have happened to me unless by the will of heaven, I should have endeavoured to submit my own to that, in order to have ob∣tained strength, to support me under the affliction.</P>
<P>What do you say, mamma? to think like Charles, is not this the only way to combat mis∣fortune? I yet remember the fatal day on which I lost my father. You wept; I was inconsolable; but our tears and lamentations could not bring him back to life. You took me by the hand, and said, Come, my son, let us pray to the Al∣mighty, and he will comfort us; I soon saw that
<PB N="273" REF="045437_0605_10202B8CB9335B38"/>
you became more tranquil; and I found also my own heart relieved by prayer. I found this a sure means of alleviating distress; I will submit therefore to the decrees of Providence, whatever evils may befal me; and hope that I shall bear them with constancy, when I reflect that it is the will of God which inflicts them; of that God to whom I say daily, "<HI>thy will be done.</HI>"</P>
<P>But why do I remind you of these sad events, my dear mamma; you, in whom I would wish to excite no sentiments, but those of joy?—If I have afflicted you, I know but of one remedy; it is to take my little sister in your arms, to ca∣ress her, and tell her of your tenderness and of mine for her; I am sure that her sweet smiles will give you back to peace and happiness.</P>

<P>MR. and Mrs. Grandison are just arrived, my dear mamma: we are all overjoyed; even the very servants are transported with plea∣sure. Is not this a good sign, when domestics
<PB N="274" REF="045437_0606_10202B92751E30B8"/>
rejoice at the return of their masters? When I grow up, I am determined, I will be as humane as Mr. Grandison, since there is so much plea∣sure in making one<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s self beloved. But I must return to my friend Charles. Mr. Bartlet asked us this morning after breakfast if we would take a turn in the park; tho' Charles finds himself much recovered at present, he begged to be excused being of the party. My burn is not entirely cured, said he; and I wish that my papa and mamma, at their return, should not perceive that any thing ails me. If I should walk now, perhaps my leg may suffer from the fatigue, and my parents will not fail to observe it. This will afflict them, and I would rather deprive myself of the pleasure of a walk than cause them the least uneasiness. You are in the right, said Mr. Bartlet, and I ap∣prove this foresight; it does honour to your heart. Charles remained in his chamber, and Edward, Emily and I walked till noon.</P>
<P>At our return we found Charles waiting for us in the parlour below: we were a little surpri∣zed at this, as he had told us that he did not in∣tend quitting his chamber. He had suffered some pain by coming down stairs, but the plea∣sure of meeting his papa and mamma something the sooner by it, was, said he, well worth that. He had ordered the dinner earlier, that we might be more at liberty to receive them. With what alacrity did he fly down the steps, when he heard their carriage enter the court-yard! With what joy did he throw himself into the arms of his father and mother! Scarcely could he force him∣self
<PB N="275" REF="045437_0607_10202B9402E02908"/>
from them, to give place to us. You would have been astonished, had you seen with what grace he gave his hand to his mother, to conduct her into the parlour: it put me in mind, my dear mother, of the joy that I shall feel when I return to you: it will be as lively as that of my friend Charles, I promise you. But I must recount to you a conversation which has just passed between him and his brother: you will judge whether it be to his honour, or not, without my anticipating.</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. Grandison were retired to their apartments to put off their riding-dresses, whilst Edward, Charles, and Emily, and I, remained in the parlour. Charles had desired his sister to play us a piece on her harpsicord, Emily had readily complied, but scarcely had she began when we were interrupted, by the fall of a piece of china, which was broken into a thousand pieces.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, there is a piece of china broken, I hear; What clumsy blockheads those servants are!</P>

<P>Do not accuse them so hastily, bro∣ther; we do not know yet whether the accident has happened through their fault.</P>

<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will see presently: Charles will uphold him, as if nothing had happened.</P>

<P>This is wondrous good, no doubt; and a negligent servant will never do wrong in your house.</P>

<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is true; but what then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>The servant went for this bench without a light, and in taking it up, he threw down the plate which was on it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, is that my fault? What bu∣siness had he to go rummaging in the dark?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is no more than he does every day. Come, brother, own that you are the cause of all the mischief. The plate was not in its right place: and how was the servant to guess that it was on the bench?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are always talking, Miss, when it does not concern you. But harkye, Charles, papa and mamma know nothing of all this, and they will not think of enquiring after this china plate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, Edward! just now you were quite eager to inform our parents of this acci∣dent, and now you wish to conceal it from them, only because you were the occasion of it yourself. Is this just? You will easily obtain your pardon; the case is a very excuseable one. But let it teach you not to be so severe on a ser∣vant for an inadvertency, when we are so often liable to the same ourselves.</P>
<P>Charles had scarcely said this, when Mr. and Mrs. Grandison came down. He related the adventure of the china-plate with so much wit and address, and gave such a turn to the whole affair, that they found more to laugh at than to
<PB N="279" REF="045437_0611_10202BA0324483D8"/>
be displeased with; and as for Edward, he was delighted to be so well rid of the business. Oh! mamma, what a happiness it is to have a brother like my friend! I hope I shall also have as good an advocate in my little sister, if ever I should need her eloquence on a like occasion.</P>

<P>I HAVE nothing new to tell you of to-day, my dear mamma, but I expect, that to-mor∣row will afford many interesting things to enter∣tain you with: it is the birth-day of Charles. Edward tells me, that we are to be entertained like kings, because it is his brother's custom to give a treat to all the young people of the neigh∣bourhood on that day. Emily, on the contra∣ry, says, that he will invite no one this year; and that he has already formed the resolution of em∣ploying the money which his father will give him, in buying books of instruction and enter∣tainment. I, for my part, wish he may do this last: for the company will leave us when the

day concludes, but the books will always remain with us.</P>
<P>I think I do not betray his confidence, when I tell you that he has privately trained up a pret∣ty starling, which he intends as a present to his sister, until she receives one which her aunt is to send her. He has accustomed it already to eat out of his hand, and to fly out of its cage. Emi∣ly does not expect this present, and she will be surprized when she receives it. The bird be∣gins already to repeat her name very prettily. I will also train up one which shall continually repeat to me your's and my sister's: not that I have occasion for this to make me think of you, for happy as I am here, this is the chief pleasure that I enjoy whilst so far removed from those whom I love the best in the world.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER V. WILLIAM DANVERS TO HIS MOTHER.</HEAD>
<P>OH! my dear mamma, how delighted you will be with my friend! He has not gi∣ven an entertainment to his young neighbours with the money which he received from his fa∣ther; neither has he employed it in buying
<PB N="281" REF="045437_0613_10202BA4AE07D040"/>
books: he has made a very different use of it. But in the first place, I must relate to you a con∣versation which he had with his father.</P>
<P>We rose this morning very early: our custom is, to read every day one or two chapters from the Old Testament, before we come down to breakfast. Mr. Grandison came into the room in the midst of our lecture: Charles immedi∣ately rose to salute his father.</P>
<SP>

<P>Good-morning to you, my dear pa∣pa; I hope you have rested well last night.</P>

<P>After placing an armed chair for his father, he resumed his book, and read with a distinct voice. When he had done, Mr. Grandison ex∣pressed much satisfaction in his manner of read∣ing: it is a talent, added he, much more diffi∣cult to acquire than is commonly imagined. The generality of readers pronounce their words either with a snuffle or a whine, without attend∣ing to the sense of what they read, which is ex∣tremely tiresome to their hearers.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank you, papa, permit me to em∣brace you, and to express my gratitude to you: this day recalls to my remembrance all that I owe to your tender cares, and to those of my dear mamma.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Grandison.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are already recompen∣sed by your good behaviour. Continue, my dear son, to fulfil all your duties, and may hea∣ven complete those blessings already vouchsafed to us, by permitting us to be witnesses of thy felicity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will labour with redoubled ardour to render myself worthy of this wish. Vouch∣safe to honour me with your wise precepts, and I will, on my part, endeavour to profit by them. But father, before I enter on a new year of my life, I ought to ask your pardon for all the faults which I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> committed in those preceding it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Grandison.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not recollect that you have ever given me any cause of complaint; and I give you this testimony of my approbation, not to make you proud, but to encourage you in do∣ing well. But come, this is a day of happiness, and it shall be spent joyfully. I give you what you will find in this paper to make use of, if you chuse, in entertaining your young friends. It is already near nine o'clock; finish dressing, and come down with William: your mother waits for us. Farewel: I will go forward, and tell her that you are coming.</P>
<P>Oh! mamma, what a heartfelt satisfaction there is in thus rendering one's self worthy the affec∣tion
<PB N="283" REF="045437_0615_10202BAC55428910"/>
of a good father. How delighted did Mr. Grandison appear to be with his son, whilst tears of joy and tenderness filled his eyes! On the other hand, how much must good parents suffer whose children are unworthy of this love! Oh! I will always follow the example of my friend, whom God himself must love. How many things have I to say to you, if my letter were not already too long; but you shall lose nothing by it: I will keep them all for another, which I will begin to-morrow morning, as soon as I rise. How much do I wish to be with you, to express my duty and affection to you as I ought. My letters, I always fear, are insufficient for that purpose. Oh! if my little sister could but say this for me, she who has the happiness to em∣brace you! My dearest mamma, think that I am caressing you whenever she is. We will have but one heart between us, which shall be filled with love for you.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VI. WILLIAM DANVERS TO HIS MOTHER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>AUGUST 25.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I BEGIN this letter, my dear mamma, where I left off yesterday.</P>
<P>Before we went down to breakfast, Charles opened the paper which his father had given him. He found four guineas in it: he had ne∣ver before seen so much money at once. After considering over it a little, he turned to me: William, said he, I should like to know your opinion: there are few young people in our neighbourhood, whose society will give us much pleasure; they are for the most part so fond of noise and racket, that their company is insupport∣able. Young Friendly, is the only one whose character is at all suited to mine; and he has been gone these three days to London with his mo∣ther. What do you advise me to do with this money? Were I in your place, said I, I would keep it, in order to purchase something useful: three or four hours of playing and dancing will soon pass away, but some books or prints will be a daily amusement to us. But will not you
<PB N="285" REF="045437_0617_10202BB230596548"/>
be disappointed, said he, if we spend this even∣ing in our ordinary way without company? No, surely, answered I, I am happy enough in your society. If that be the case, said he, taking me by the hand, I may follow my first idea. By this time we were at the entrance of the par∣lour. Mrs. Grandison embraced her son with tenderness, and gave him her blessing. After breakfast we remained alone with Mr. Grandi∣son. Charles took his father by the hand, and said to him, may I ask you one question, papa?</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Grandison.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is it, my dear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you judge it absolutely necessary that I should give an entertainment to my young neighbours to-day?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Grandison.</SPEAKER>
<P>This does not depend on me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I may do what I please with the money which you had the goodness to give me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Grandison.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, my child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I know how I will celebrate my birth-day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Grandison.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you let me into the se∣cret?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish for nothing more, papa; ne∣vertheless, I am a little afraid that you will not approve of my project.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Grandison.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not, my dear? you may safely speak. I never yet knew you make an ill use of your money. You are at liberty to dispose of it now as you like best: I approve be∣forehand of whatever you may do. Let us see what you wish to buy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="286" REF="045437_0618_10202BB3C08D4FC8"/>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me, papa; I want nothing: thanks to your goodness, I have all things in abundance; I only wish that others may rejoice on my birth-day. But do you know whom I have chosen to celebrate it? they are the poor of our neighbourhood. I have procured a list of all the honest and necessitous families around us. How much will these poor people be rejoiced at the little feast which I shall prepare for them! The sons of our rich neighbours whom I might have invited, enjoy superfluities every day as I do; but those, whom I mean to regale to-day, often want a morsel of bread. How joyful they will be over the feast which I shall give them! and I shall have more pleasure in their enjoy∣ment, than I should have had in all the diversi∣ons that I might have taken with my compani∣ons. But this is only on condition that you are not displeased with it, papa.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Grandison.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did you think, my dear son, that I could be displeased at this. No, no, I approve entirely this generous design. Your fourteenth year so well begun, cannot fail to bring with it days of happiness. The good∣ness of your heart will have its recompense.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear papa, I only do my duty. How many favours have I received from heaven during the course of the preceding year! Ought I not to render some of them back to my fel∣low-creatures?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Grandison.</SPEAKER>
<P>Embrace me, my child, and hasten to accomplish your laudable design. You may give your orders to the servants, and I will take care that they shall be obeyed.</P>

What do you say to all this, my dear mam∣ma? Oh! if I were but as rich as Mr. Grandi∣son, I would give you all, mamma, you and my little sister. Might I, in that case, ask you for a small part to enable me to be as beneficent as my friend Charles?</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VII. WILLIAM DANVERS TO HIS MOTHER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>AUGUST 27.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YESTERDAY, my dear mamma, Charles gave his entertainment to the poor people of the parish. They were feasted with plenty of roast beef, plumb-pudding, and the vegetables of the season. I never had more pleasure than in seeing these good people regale themselves. Joy and gratitude were painted on their coun∣tenances. They drank our healths in some ex∣cellent beer, repeating at every draught, Long life and happiness to Charles Grandison! The eyes of Charles were frequently filled with tears. During dinner-time, he took notice of a poor man, almost blind with age, who, he fancied, was not sufficiently attended to by the rest: he called
<PB N="288" REF="045437_0620_10202BB83B4C8AC0"/>
to a young one, who sat next him, saying, take care of that good man; he is one of my princi∣pal guests; I want to see him eat with a good appetite. Father, said he, you deserve the first place in my festival. The young ones ought to honour your old age, that they themselves may be honoured in their turn, when they be∣come old.</P>
<P>When the repast was ended, Charles divided the remainder of his money among his guests. Yes, mamma, he gave them all that he had re∣ceived from his father. You will readily ima∣gine what blessings they bestowed upon him. He was so moved with tenderness, that he could not contain himself. He took me by the hand, and we went off together, without being able ei∣ther of us to speak a word. It was not till we had entered the house, that he said to me, Well, my dear friend, can there be a greater pleasure than in comforting the unfortunate? Oh, no, answered I, throwing my arms round his neck, you could not have given me a more delightful entertainment. I felt myself as much affected as my friend. Alas! thought I, how much are the poor to be pitied! They often want the first necessaries of life, whilst we are seated every day at tables, covered with delicacies, where our only trouble is how to chuse the most delicious. I shall, from this day, be the more grateful to Hea∣ven, from whom we receive these favours, as well as more compassionate to those who suffer for the want of them. Yes, my greatest plea∣sure shall be, to give them comfort, by following the example of my friend Charles.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="045437_0621_10202BBCA0EA1DF0"/>
After dinner, we went to take a walk. We expected to pass the evening among ourselves, in our ordinary amusements; but what was our surprize, when, on returning to the house, we found there a large company! Mr. Grandison had invited all the gentlemen of the neighbour∣hood, with their children, to celebrate the birth∣day of his son. We had a pretty concert; and after it, a ball. Charles and his sister did won∣ders. How much I wished that I could sing and play as they did; but you know, mamma, it is not my fault that I cannot. You were not able to give me the advantage of masters. At present, I partake of that benefit, with my friends, and I hope to profit so much by it, as to be able one day to equal them.</P>
<P>I am obliged to break off here, my dear mam∣ma, being just called upon to partake of a little tour into the country. I expect a great deal of pleasure from this tour, which I will not fail to give you an account of in my next: but I forgot to tell you, that Charles made his present yesterday to his sister, of the little starling, in return for a pocket-book which she had presented him with. Emily is already quite fond of her bird. I ne∣ver saw so diverting an animal. I wish my sis∣ter could see all the care that Emily takes of it; but I wish, yet more, to be with her, for then I should also be with you, my dear mamma.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>AUGUST 27.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WE had not so much pleasure yesterday as we expected, my dear mamma. The weather was very fine at our setting out; but a violent shower of rain coming on, obliged us to take shelter, in a very indifferent little inn, whilst the storm lasted. Edward grumbled, and put himself out of humour. Emily was vexed: and, as for me, I must confess to you, I was not very well pleased. Charles, who is always mas∣ter of himself, was the only one of us, whom this little accident did not disconcert, as you will perceive by the following dialogue.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>How unlucky it is, that this rain is come; all our pleasure is at an end now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps not: we will have our tea here, and by that time the rain may cease. If it should not, we can easily send for the coach, that my sister may not be obliged to walk through the wet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you, brother, but I would much rather it were dry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not doubt it; a walk would have been more agreeable to you. But our gar∣dener
<PB N="291" REF="045437_0623_10202BC27B415B78"/>
was wishing for rain this morning, because the plants and trees have need of it. Now, whose wishes do you think ought to prevail, his or your's?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(with a contemptuous smile.)</STAGE>
<P>Oh, those of the gardener, no doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, truly, I think so too; for without rain, the trees must suffer much from the drought; and would you not be very sorry if we should have no fruit? And what will be∣come of the poor, should the heat destroy the corn, and if a bad harvest should raise the price of bread?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! they will be sadly to be pitied.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us rejoice then at the rain, which may prevent these evils. Besides, if it deprives us of the pleasures of our walk, it will afford us others in return: we shall behold the verdure more fresh and brilliant, and the flowers in our parterre will bloom with redoubled lustre.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Enough, brother; you have convin∣ced me. I am no longer angry at the rain. Let it fall if it will, I shall find no fault.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>One day longer would have made no great difference: it would have been better for us, if it had not fallen before to-night, or to∣morrow, and then we might have had our walk to-day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>But those who happen to be obliged to travel either to-night or to-morrow, had ra∣ther it should fall now. Would you have the weather governed according to your fancy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="292" REF="045437_0624_10202BC6D1A53640"/>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Charles is in the right; the desires of different people are so contradictory to each other, that it is impossible all the world should be pleased.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Believe me, we should be very un∣happy if all our prayers were granted us: but to return to the weather. What a small matter it is, that we should be deprived of our pleasures for one day, in comparison to the good which this rain will produce to others, as well as to ourselves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>But look at the poor birds; I cannot help pitying them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>They know where to seek shelter when the rain incommodes them: besides, as my papa says, there is a kind of oil in their fea∣thers which repels the wet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad of that: it seems to me, that every thing around us is very wisely order∣ed.</P>
<P>The rain now became more violent; how∣ever, Mrs. Grandison did not forget us; the carriage was sent, and we were soon conducted back to the house. Emily amused herself with her starling. Charles and I made a party at shuttle-cock, to supply the exercise of a walk. As for Edward, he remained in the dumps, and could find out no way of consoling himself, but by teazing his dog. I have learned a good les∣son from him to-day, for I see, when we suffer our humours to get the better of us, on every lit∣tle disappointment, we are sure to be very often unhappy. Well then, I will do my best, to ac∣commodate myself to every mischance, that may
<PB N="293" REF="045437_0625_10202BC9C4329D90"/>
befal me. There is one, however, to which I cannot be insensible; it is that of being separa∣ted from you and my little sister. I stretch forth my arms, to embrace you; without the power of doing it. A thousand times in the day, I fancy that you are doing the same by me; but, alas! we can only draw near to each other by our sen∣timents. But what then, are not <HI>they</HI> sufficient∣ly lively and tender to re-unite us?</P>

<P>I MUST relate to you, my dear mamma, a droll adventure that befel us last night.</P>
<P>We had scarcely been half an hour in bed, when we heard a great noise. What is it, said I, to my friend? I know not, answered he. Per∣haps, said I, some thieves may have broken into the house. At this instant, we heard Edward cry out violently. Charles immediately leaped out of bed, hastily threw something over him, and seizing his sword, Follow me, William, said he, it is in Edward's chamber. I lighted a candle
<PB N="294" REF="045437_0626_10202BCB4F26DC48"/>
at our lamp, and we went up into his brother's room, to see what was the matter. Charles did not discover the least sign of fear; but to con∣fess the truth to you, I trembled all over. On entering the room, we saw Edward lying on the ground under a table, which had fallen on him, with all his books and papers. After having as∣sisted in raising him up, Charles said, What is the matter, brother? what has happened to you?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was the ghost, I tell you.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell us then all about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was thus: you know, I do not like to sleep with a light in my chamber; I had just put out my candle, and got into bed, when I heard something tread softly on the floor; I rose up on my seat, and drawing aside the cur∣tain, saw clearly in the corner of the room, two lights, which appeared sometimes great, some∣times small, and which moved about.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was the dazzling of your eyes, no doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>The dazzling of my eyes, indeed! I tell you it was a real object; I saw it as plain as I see you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and what followed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>I remained perfectly still, hardly daring to breathe; at length the lights were ex∣tinguished, and I heard something trot about the chamber, and then throw itself violently against the door.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>William.</SPEAKER>
<P>The mere recital chills me with fear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all Charles' steadiness, he would have been as much frightened as I was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why did not you call out for a light?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>How could I? terror had stopped my mouth. For a moment all was still: then
<PB N="297" REF="045437_0629_10202BD426470E98"/>
I heard something glide against the wall; and by the pale light of the moon, I saw a great phan∣tom, all in white, standing against the window-curtain. It seemed every moment to become taller and larger. I put my hand before my eyes, left I should see something still more dread∣ful. I crept softly out of bed, in order to escape out of the chamber; but the phantom, as it ap∣peared to me, began to leap about, and then came up close to me: in my fright, I fell against the table, which I overturned upon me, utter∣ing, at the same time, a loud cry, which was what you heard. But hush, I think I hear it again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>William.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think so too; I heard something move by that bureau.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> lay a wager it is a rat hid under it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>But a rat is not white; besides, what I saw was at least as big as our great dog in the court-yard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have nothing to do but to search: if it be here, we shall see it.</P>
</SP>
<P>Charles immediately began searching into eve∣ry corner; under the bed, the bureau, and the drawers; at length he cried out, Here is the ghost; I have found him. And what at last was this ghost? you will never guess, my dear mamma: it was no other than a great white cat, belonging to the tenant, which had stolen into the house, and ran into Edward's chamber. At the sight of it, we all three burst into laugh∣ter. Charles rallied his brother on his creduli∣ty, and the cat made her escape as soon as she saw the door open: Edward appeared, however,
<PB N="298" REF="045437_0630_10202BD713EB22E8"/>
a little confused at this adventure. I cannot comprehend, said he, how this cat could appear to me of such a formidable size. It is the pro∣perty of <HI>fear,</HI> answered Charles, to represent things falsely, and to magnify them to our ima∣gination. But the two flambeaus which I saw? They were the eyes of the cat, which appeared, either large or small, as she opened or shut her eye-lids. Believe me, all the stories that we hear of apparitions are like this of our cat. Could we trace them to their source, we should find their causes quite natural.</P>
<P>After this conversation, we returned to our beds, and slept very well the remainder of the night. This morning at breakfast, we diverted Mr. and Mrs. Grandison with our night-alarm: they bestowed great praises on the coolness and resolution of Charles. I must confess, I never saw his presence of mind fail him on any occa∣sion. As to Edward, and me, we were not the last to laugh at our own weakness: indeed, I am ashamed not to have shewn more courage. I hope, that this little history will serve to amuse my sister, and to inspire her with more boldness on a like occasion, than has been shewn by her brother.</P>
<P>Adieu, my dear mamma; you do not write to me so often as I desire, or as I have occasion for. Emily talks to me frequently of my sister: she wants to know, if you are as well satisfied with her as ever. Write particularly about her, I beseech you, both to gratify my own affection, as well as the enquiries of my young friend, who
<PB N="299" REF="045437_0631_10202BDB642CE128"/>
vouchsafes, to interest herself for a little girl whom I love so much. Embrace her for me, and convince her how tender the regard is, that I bear her.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER X. MRS. DANVERS TO HER SON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>SEPTEMBER 6.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I SENSIBLY feel your tender reproach, my dear son, that I do not write to you often enough: were I at liberty to give myself up to it, no occupation would be more pleasing to me; but you may easily conceive how much my time is engaged by the affairs of my family, and the attention that I think it necessary to pay to your little sister: I am obliged, you know, to instruct her myself, not having a fortune sufficient to procure her the instruction of different masters. But my cares are well repaid by her happy dis∣position: she learns every thing with the great∣est facility; her industry is not to be repulsed by any difficulty; and I am every day astonished, at the rapid progress of her understanding; nor, do
<PB N="300" REF="045437_0632_10202BDE546AE208"/>
her sentiments afford me less cause of satisfac∣tion. It would be difficult to conceive, a heart, of more rectitude and sensibility. All that you have written, to me, from time to time about E∣mily, pleases her infinitely. The pretty letter which this young lady wrote to her mamma, on the subject of the poor people who suffered by a fire, and of which you sent me a copy, has made a lively impression on her. She finds something to say about it every day. Oh! my dear mamma, said she to me yesterday, had I been rich, I would have done like Emily; how much pleasure must she have had in relieving those poor Miss Fal∣stons! Yes, my child, said I, she has reason to be happy, and I am so also, in seeing you capa∣ble of taking part in the troubles of other peo∣ple; it is a proof of a good heart: and this dis∣position gives you a right to expect the same sympathy, in others toward you. These affec∣tionate sentiments, are necessary among mankind, for the mutual consolation of their troubles. This is very true, mamma, said she, for when I suffer any uneasiness, if my little friends appear afflicted for me, it lessens the evil by one half, at least; besides, I am sure to love them the better for it, and that is always a pleasure. Is not this a very delicate sentiment, my dear son, and alto∣gether charming for its simplicity? I hear such, continually, from her, which excites in me the tenderest emotions; nor am I less affected, by those which you display in your letters: I feel that they come from the bottom of your heart; and it is with joy that I receive them back into mine. They soften my afflictions, and prove to
<PB N="301" REF="045437_0633_10202BDFF8FFE758"/>
me that I have not lost all that I possessed on earth, when I lost my husband, since my children remain to cherish me with as much tenderness as I have love for them. Yes, it is to you and your sister that I commit the care of my happi∣ness. It will not be a painful one to you; for to see you made happy by your virtues, will not fail to render me so.</P>
<P>All Mrs. Grandison's letters to me are filled with the most flattering accounts of you. The friendship which has long united us, has, no doubt, its share in these encomiums: neverthe∣less, I am willing to believe that you have so lively a sense of her goodness, as to guard you from doing any thing which may justly incur her reprehension; it would indeed be shameful in you to deserve it, having before you so perfect a model as Charles. We never love those long whom we cannot esteem: continue then to fol∣low the good example of your friend. A young man endowed with such noble qualities, ought to inspire you with a laudable emulation; and there is no way, by which you can repay his ten∣derness, but by endeavouring to make yourself worthy of it.</P>
<P>I see how much you suffer in not being able to imitate his beneficence. What pleasure should I feel, could I put it in your power to exercise this attractive virtue! cultivate it, nevertheless, in your breast, against the moment that fortune may enable you to follow these generous emo∣tions; in the mean time, my dear, receive the trifle that I send you: I wish it were more, but
<PB N="302" REF="045437_0634_10202BE450A43160"/>
it is all that the present state of my affairs will permit. I have transmitted to Mr. Grandison whatever is wanting for your necessaries: what I send you, is destined for your pleasures: and these, I know, consist in such things as are most worthy of a sensible and generous heart. Fare∣well my son. I embrace you with all the tran∣sports of a mother, whose felicity depends on the tenderness and virtues of her children.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XI. WILLIAM DANVERS TO HIS MOTHER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>SEPTEMBER 12.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>A THOUSAND thanks to you, my dear mamma, for the present which you have sent me. A trifle do you call it! permit me to contradict you, in this; I, for my part, think it a great sum. You are not rich, and yet you make me a present of two guineas for my pleasure: ten times as much, were you possessed of a large fortune, would be less to me. But alas! I fear that you may have put yourself to some incon∣venience, in order to enrich me; and this thought interrupts the joy that I feel in receiving these
<PB N="303" REF="045437_0635_10202BE5D8DF1C78"/>
marks of your bounty. Be at least persuaded, that I am sensible of all the value of this gift, and that I know how to employ it, in a manner with which you will be satisfied.</P>
<P>I must own to you, that I felt a little proud when I related to Emily what you wrote to me of my sister. I seemed, as if I valued myself more on her perfections, than on those which I might acquire myself. Emily appeared flattered that her conduct had merited your approbation. She becomes every day more sensible and more amiable. Since my little sister knows so well how to profit by what I write to you concerning my friend, I will relate to you another adventure which has lately happened to her. I must con∣fess freely, that she was a little in fault at the be∣ginning, but the conclusion does her so much honour, that I cannot forbear relating the whole to you as it happened. The poor child was yesterday in the parlour with Edward; they amused themselves by turns, in playing little tunes on the harpsichord. You know, there is in this parlour, a japan cabinet, filled with very valuable china. Emily had the curiosity to open it, to look at some Chinese figures which Mrs. Grandison had lately presented to her. She took one in her hand in order to examine it nearer. Edward, who is ever at some unlucky trick, cried out, suddenly, mamma is coming. Emily, fearing to be caught in the fact, hastily put back the china into the cabinet; but in her fear and precipitation, threw down a cup, which broke into a thousand pieces. She was seized with consternation. It was a cup of great value,
<PB N="304" REF="045437_0636_10202BEA95F3FAD8"/>
which she knew her mamma preserved with the utmost care, as it made part of a set, which was only used on particular occasions. Edward quitted the harpsichord, on hearing Emily cry; and this is the conversation which passed be∣tween them.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have done a pretty piece of work there, truly. I would not be in your place for a good deal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>O brother, how can you teaze me so, when you see how I am distressed already? you should rather give me your advice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>What advice can I give you? if you were to go to all the shops in London, you would not find such another cup as that. You have nothing to do that I know of, but to set off for China, in order to match it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>What pleasure can you take in tor∣menting me thus?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>What had you to do rummaging in that cabinet?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>If it had not been for you, this would not have happened.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, it was you that did it; you had no business to touch the china.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, I did wrong; however, if you had not put me in a fright, I should not have broken any thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>This set of china that mamma was so fond of, see, it is now incomplete; there might as well be not a piece of it left.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would give all that I am worth in the world that this had not happened.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="305" REF="045437_0637_10202BEC1ED11190"/>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes, you may lament now; that will do much good.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>O brother, how can you be so cruel? Charles would not torment me thus.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, don't cry any more, and I will tell you what you had best do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me hear, dear Edward?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nobody knows any thing of what has passed: we have nothing to do but to gather up the broken bits, and place them by each other in the cabinet. Mamma will not look in it this morning. During dinner, you may say that you heard some china fall in the cabinet; I will be ready to support the fact: Mamma will of course go and look, and, without doubt, will conclude that it fell of itself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>No indeed, brother, I will not do this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why not? you accuse no one by it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>No matter, it is a bad expedient; to tell an untruth is worse than breaking the chi∣na.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well; I have shewn you a way to get out of the scrape, which you might take advantage of; but it is your concern, not mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! what shall I do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am really frightened for you; but I am very good thus to trouble myself about you, when you desire to be punished.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I had rather be punished than deceive mamma; I will go to her, confess the
<PB N="306" REF="045437_0638_10202BF0798FD700"/>
fault, and ask her pardon, promising, at the same time, never to touch the key of her cabinet as long as I live.</P>
<P>Emily was just going out, when she saw her mamma enter the room: she trembled, and changed colour; and before she was able to speak, burst into a torrent of tears. She expect∣ed a sharp reproach: what then was her surprize, when Mrs. Grandison, who had overheard all that had passed, took her tenderly in her arms, and caressing her, said, you are a good girl, my dear Emily, I do not know what it is that you have broken, but if it be the most valuable piece of china in my cabinet, I forgive you, in consi∣deration of your courage and frankness. As for you, Sir, continued she, addressing herself to Edward, go up into your chamber, and medi∣tate on the lesson that your young sister has gi∣ven you. It is well for you that your father knows nothing of all this, or he would be more severe than I am. Go and blush for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he falshood that you meditated: I see, henceforward I must not depend on your word, but may rest in con∣fidence on that of your sister.</P>
<P>You perceive, mamma, how well Emily was rewarded for not following the bad counsels of Edward; for she would have paid dear for his falshood, as Mrs. Grandison had overheard all. The relation of this adventure will not, I think, be useless to my sister; not that I suspect her of ever being capable of deceiving you. Heaven forbid I ever should! but it will be a fresh en∣couragement to her to persevere in the good prin∣ciples that she has received from you. Ah!
<PB N="307" REF="045437_0639_10202BF36AEEC4B8"/>
what good fortune is hers, to receive them from your own lips! It is a long time, alas! since I have enjoyed that happiness: raging seas divide me from those whom I love best in the world. Oh! when shall I embrace you! When will you see us both, my little sister and me, at your knees, vying with each other in giving you proofs of our affection!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XII. WILLIAM DANVERS TO HIS MOTHER.</HEAD>
<P>I CONGRATULATE myself, my dear mamma, on having it in my power, to make you acquainted with a new instance of the moderation and generosity of my friend. No, I cannot often enough repeat it. There is not, I believe, in the whole universe, a young man of so noble a character.</P>
<P>The earl of—made him a present, a few days ago, of a fine dog, of a very rare and uncommon kind. Young Falkland, one of our neighbours, had before this, asked the earl seve∣ral times to give it to him, but he could not ob∣tain it of him, because this young man is re∣markable for his ill-treatment of his dogs. He
<PB N="308" REF="045437_0640_10202BF4F3D98770"/>
has no other pleasure than in tormenting them; either by the most cruel discipline, or by encou∣raging them to fight till they tear each other to pieces. He has already above a dozen in his house: you will think, perhaps, that this was sufficient; but no such thing: he has besides a collection of all sorts of animals, particularly cats, monkies, and parrots; and with these crea∣tures he passes one half of the day. He must have, methinks, a most contracted mind, thus to lavish his time in such a miserable occupation, instead of devoting it to the study of the arts and sciences. Notwithstanding the multitude he has of these beasts about him, he was quite en∣raged when he found the earl had given his dog to another, after refusing it to him. What was the consequence of this? Charles had scarcely been five days in possession of it, when the poor creature was found dead in a corner of the house. It was not till yesterday that we discovered, by means of one of Falkland's servants, that he had contrived to get him poisoned, out of spite and jealousy. What monsters are there among mankind! I say monsters; the term is not too strong. Yes, my dear mamma, I call him a monster, who can deprive another of what he cannot possess himself, with no other view than to give him pain. But the following conversa∣tion, which passed between Edward, Charles and me, as we were walking in the garden yesterday, will shew you how my friend revenged this piece of knavery.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="045437_0641_10202BF7E0D21980"/>
I was lamenting the death of the poor crea∣ture. I am very much afflicted, said he, also: I could hardly have believed that the loss of a dog would have given me so much trouble: but this was an animal of such singular beauty, and he was already become quite attached to me.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was a shocking action on the part of Falkland, to poison him: I would never forgive him as long as I lived, were I in your place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must forgive him, however, unless I resolve to be as wicked as he is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are too good, brother; for my part, I shall hate him as long as I live.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not hate him, but I despise his character; and I pity him yet more for being the slave of such violent and detestable passions; to destroy an innocent animal with no other view, than to deprive another of it. He who can be guilty of such cruelty in cold blood, would stop at no excess.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the traitor dared to call him∣self your friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not now to learn that we must not give credit to mere words, and that we must know people well before we reckon upon their friendship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't you intend to break entirely with such a dirty fellow as he is?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not mean to insult him public∣ly, I shall content myself only with holding as little intercourse with him as possible. The so∣ciety of a young man of his base way of think∣ing, by no means suits me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="310" REF="045437_0642_10202BFC4C283E60"/>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw; this is not enough. Shall I cut off his ears, Charles? you have only to say the word.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll take care then how I say that word: his ears will not bring me back my dog.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, I have another scheme. Falkland has a dozen spaniels and greyhounds; we have nothing to do but to poison them in our turn; he deserves this revenge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>But have the poor beasts deserved it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then, do you mean to let him escape unpunished?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is not my affair, I shall not take his punishment upon me; it is enough for me to leave him to his conscience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall be curious to know what my papa will think of this adventure. I do not wonder now at his always being so careful to keep us from too strict an intimacy with this young profligate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is a proof to me, that my father understands the heart; and I learn from it, that we ought to consult our parents in the choice of our friends: as they have more experience than we have, they know better how to distinguish characters: by their wife advice, I hope to pre∣serve myself from dangerous connexions, by which I might be corrupted. But, Edward, I think, we ought not to acquaint my father with this base action of Falkland's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>How then will you manage it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="311" REF="045437_0643_10202BFF42330CA0"/>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Methinks, we shall mortify him more, by a cold contempt than by our com∣plaints.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>William.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a noble way of thinking.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>It will be best, believe me. But let us talk of something more agreeable. Come, shall we take a walk in the fields this fine even∣ing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stop a moment; look yonder, don't you see something up in that tree?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>William.</SPEAKER>
<P>Methinks I see a bird in it with very extraordinary feathers, and he flutters as if he were in distress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very true; he is caught by his wings in the tree.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>How lucky this is: it is Falkland's parrot that has escaped out of his cage; I know him very well. Now we have him in our pow∣er, he shall pay for the dog. His master would not take ten guineas for him: he shall be well punished now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>O my dear Edward, the poor crea∣ture suffers sadly: be so kind, William, as to get me a ladder, I will get up into the tree and dis∣entangle the poor bird.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>To give it to Falkland, I suppose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure: Is it not his?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>He killed your dog, and you mean to save his parrot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why not? It would make me happy, if I could from this time forth, do him any good in return for the injury that he has done me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="312" REF="045437_0644_10202C00CBCFF4D0"/>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>You had better be advised; you will never again have so good an opportunity of being revenged.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I look upon it as such: it is suffici∣ent revenge to me, to shew him that my heart is better than his.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Edward.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh yes, he is very capable of feel∣ing this to be sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, I shall have the satis∣faction of feeling it.</P>
<P>Just then the gardener brought us a ladder. Charles climbed into the tree himself, and found the parrot entangled with his wings between two branches, and held fast: he soon disengaged him, and immediately charged one of the servants to carry him to young Falkland.</P>
<P>What do you think of my brother, said Ed∣ward to me, as Charles left us?</P>
<P>Can you blame him, answered I, for being so generous?</P>
<P>No, certainly; but I do not feel myself perfect enough to imitate him.</P>
<P>—It is our part to become so, from so good an example.</P>
<P>Charles now came up to us; his face was animated with the most sweet expressions of sa∣tisfaction: I never before was so sensible of the pleasure which arises from doing good. O my dear mamma, preserve, I pray you, all my let∣ters, that I may read them over again when I return home. I should be very unworthy of such a friend, if the lessons that I daily receive from his conduct, did not inspire me both with inclination and power to profit by them. I wish
<PB N="313" REF="045437_0645_10202C03CB5882B0"/>
he were known to all the young people of our age. If we feel so much pleasure in reading of the good actions of others, what do we not en∣joy in doing them ourselves! Oh! my dear mam∣ma, I will ever cultivate this sentiment, that I may become the more worthy of your tender∣ness. I salute my little sister across the great space which divides us, once for myself, and once for Emily.</P>

<P>WE assisted yesterday, my dear mamma, in gathering in the fruits of autumn. The air was mild, and the sky serene: nothing was heard on all sides but sprightly songs, accom∣panied by the fife and violin. It was a charm∣ing sight, to behold between the trees young boys climbing to the highest branches to gather the fruit, whilst the women and girls received them below in their aprons, in order to fill their baskets. We too were employed, in stripping
<PB N="314" REF="045437_0646_10202C08239738A8"/>
those branches which hung within our reach. All these labours carry with them an air of festi∣vity, which fills the heart with pleasure.</P>
<P>We observed some little country girls, meanly dressed, earnestly look at us over the hedge. When we had finished our business, one of them beckoned to the gardener, and we could perceive her talking to him in a supplicating manner, at the same time, casting frequent looks at my friend. Charles perceived it, and when she had done speaking, called the gardener to him. I will give you their conversation, which will be the best way of relating the thing.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>What was that little girl asking so earnestly?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gardener.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will tell you, Sir. Every body here knows the goodness of your heart. She has been asking me to beg some fruit of you, for her mother, who is sick at home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does she ask it for her mother? She is a good girl for that. Go and give her as ma∣ny apples as she can carry. It will be a pleasure to me, to reward her for loving those to whom she owes her life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gardener.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will go then and give her some of the wind-falls, they will do well enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, friend! What would you pick out the worst that we have for a poor sick woman! No, no, I insist on your giving her some of the choicest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gardener.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fear, that will lessen our store.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did not you tell me that we had an extraordinary plenty of fruit this year?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="315" REF="045437_0647_10202C09ABAE4BF8"/>
<SPEAKER>Gardener.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, Sir, we have hardly room to hold all our hoards.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, out of the abundance which heaven bestows upon us, let us at least give some to those who have nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gardener.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, my dear young master, it is not without reason that you are so beloved and honoured. You are a blessing sent to us by heaven. I will punctually obey you, for I know full-well, whatever you do will be approved by your parents.</P>
<P>Upon this, the gardener went to execute Charles' orders. Edward, having heard what had passed, came up to his brother, and said; I don't disapprove of your good-nature, but I can∣not bear to see the common people always com∣ing with some petition to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, my dear brother, if they did not ask of us what they want, should we be otherwise so attentive to their wants? We ask our parents every day for a thousand super∣fluous things; suffer then the poor, at least, to lay before us their urgent necessities.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emily.</SPEAKER>
<P>Charles is very right. Would it not be a sad thing, that we should have so much more than we want even for our pleasures, and that the poor should be without even the com∣mon necessaries of life? I will tell mamma this evening of the situation of this little girl's mo∣ther, and I am sure she will send her some assist∣ance. Mr. Bartlet, who was just then coming up to us, overheard what Emily had said, and praised her for her humanity. Charles asked him, if apples were good for a sick person: Undoubt∣edly
<PB N="316" REF="045437_0648_10202C0C9F3E8CE8"/>
said he, if they be ripe. This fruit, said he, which is produced in almost all climates, is by so much the more valuable, as it will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he best part of the year. How great is the wisdom and goodness of our Creator, who thus provides for us during winter, when the ex∣hausted earth is no longer in a state to produce these delicious fruits, by which we have been nourished and regaled in the summer season.</P>
<P>Oh! my dear mamma, I shall always be full of gratitude to the Creator of the earth, who thus provides for the wants of his children with the tenderness of a parent. Alas! mamma, how many ungrateful children are there who devour the provisions of winter, without once thinking of the beneficent hand which provides them I Heaven preserve me from ever being one of this number: we, in particular, who owe so much to it, for being permitted to share its bounties with so good a mother! Yes, mamma, I should be thankful to Providence if I possessed nothing on earth but you. Vouchsafe to receive from me the homage of these sentiments, and conti∣nue to me those by which you have always ho∣noured me. I ask this both for myself and my little sister, and as a pledge of your granting it, I accept the first kiss which you will give her, since I cannot have the happiness to partake of it with her.</P>

<P>P. S. Mr. Grandison has this moment re∣ceived a letter from the earl of ***, the first lord of the bed-chamber, to require the attendance of his son Charles at court. They are ignorant

of the reason of this. My friend sets off to∣morrow with Mr. Bartlet. How much shall I regret his absence! I, who have lately lived in the pleasing habit of seeing him every instant, must now pass whole days without his society! Neither do we know how long he may be ab∣sent. Mr. Grandison is not at all uneasy at this message; the earl's letter is too gracious to be the prelude to any thing undesirable. But in the mean-while, I lose my friend. Nothing but the hopes of something good to him could con∣sole me for this separation. He has promised to write to me. Oh! my dear mamma, with how much joy shall I send you the copy of his let∣ters!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XV. CHARLES GRANDISON TO HIS FRIEND WILLIAM DANVERS.</HEAD>
<P>I DO not yet know, my dear friend, what our journey to London will produce; the be∣ginning of our expedition has not been the most happy. A superstitious mind might look upon this as a bad presage; but you and I, my dear William, thanks to the good-sense of our pa∣rents, are in no danger of being disturbed by vain prognostics. We had scarcely gone a few miles, before one of our horses stopped short, and would not advance a step farther. The postilli∣on, thought to get on by exercising his whip, which I could not see without pain; I cannot bear that so gentle and useful an animal should be treated hardly. However, we soon perceived
<PB N="319" REF="045437_0651_10202C1708377078"/>
that the poor creature had met with a hurt in his foot, and that it was not his fault. We were therefore obliged to go gently on to the nearest inn, where we provided ourselves with horses, and pursued our rout with renewed expedition, till an unlucky accident stopped us. In a rug∣ged part of the road, the axletree of our chaise suddenly broke: happily we were none of us hurt; but we were obliged to get out of the car∣riage, and there being no house within a good distance, we had no other course left us, but to walk on foot. I should have made myself very easy under this accident, had it not been for my concern on account of our worthy friend Mr. Bartlet: I feared much le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t his health might suf∣fer from the cold and dampness of the air, and the fatigue of the walk. The sun was already set, and we proc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eded slowly, followed by our servant Henry. A violent rain came on. At length, after a half-hour's walk, we perceived to the right, a small house at a little distance from the road. We were let in by an honest labour∣er, bowed down by the weight of years and hard work, and his wife, who appeared to be as old. We were hospitably received by this worthy old couple and their children. The eldest son ran to fetch a wheelwright in the neighbourhood, and then went with him to assist the postillion in mending the chaise as well as they could; which they could not complete till the evening was far advanced. As it was then too late to pursue our journey, we resolved to pass the night in this lit∣tle hut, which, under these circumstances, I found as comfortable as the most superb palace. Whilst
<PB N="320" REF="045437_0652_10202C1891029D40"/>
one of the daughters was preparing for us a simple repast, gentlemen, said the old man, do not be uneasy, we will give you up our bed, in which you may refresh yourselves after your fatigue. It was with difficulty that Mr. Bartlet was persuad∣ed to agree to this proposal, but at last, the pressing entreaties of our host and his wife pre∣vailed. They had placed but two covers on the table. Mr. Bartlet perceiving it, said, Have you already supped, my good friends?</P>
<P>No, Sir,</P>
<P>Well then, we must eat together; our meal will be the heartier for it.</P>
<P>We should not have thought of taking that liberty, Sir, replied the old man, but, since you order it, you shall be obeyed▪</P>
<P>The rustic meal was soon put on the table; it consisted of a piece of cold meat, with vegeta∣bles, cheese and butter, and some good apples. Plain as this repast was, I never made a better supper in my life, and slept so soundly after it, that Mr. Bartlet had some difficulty in waking me the next morning. I have just now ate an excellent breakfast, and take the opportunity, while Mr. Bartlet is thanking our hosts for their hospitality, to write you this. I am now oblig∣ed to break off, but as soon as we have paid our first visit to Lord—you shall hear again from me. Present my duty to my papa and mamma, and remember me affectionately to my brother and sister.</P>

<P>I SAID right, my dear mamma, when I told you that I should have good news to send you of my friend Charles. I enclose you a co∣py of a letter that he has written to me, and one from Mr. Bartlet to Mr. Grandison. I have scarce time to transcribe them before the post goes out.

<P>COULD you ever have guessed, my dear friend, what could be the object of my journey to this city? Without doubt no, since I myself hardly dare now to believe it. Well then, it is by order of the king, who has just be∣stowed on me the post of page of honour, and invested me with a place about his children. I know not to whom I am indebted for these fa∣vours; but they try to persuade me that I owe them to my own conduct. But it seems to me that I have only fulfilled my duty, and that alone deserves no recompense: I regard therefore what has befallen me, as the pure bounty of heaven; which thus rewards the virtue of my worthy parents. I rejoice more on their account than my own. Mr. Bartlet has written to my papa; you will doubtless see his letter. I have scarce time to assure you that I am ever your faithful and affectionate friend,</P>

<P>WHAT happy news have I to send you▪ and how much will the heart of Mrs. Grandison be filled with joy! Your amiable son—but you well merit those favours with which heaven has vouchsafed to recompense his good∣ness. I always told you that he was destined to be the happiness of your future life. And so young to be thus distinguished by his sovereign's favours, whilst all good men applaud the act! Yes, my dear Sir, there is no one here, but who, after having seen your son, pronounces him worthy of his promising destiny. But I will no longer keep you in suspence. Know then, that the king has conferred on him the post of page of honour, and given him a place about the roy∣al children, as a fit object for their emulation. The earl of—, whose wife is sister to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See letter from William Danvers, Vol. I. p. 325, which letter it was thought unnecessary to repeat among these.</NOTE>

Major Arthur, whose life was saved by Charles, had represented your son to his majesty in so ad∣vantageous a manner, had spoken so highly of his good sense, his acquirements and goodness of heart, as to inspire the king with the desire of seeing him; and it was after his first interview with him that he conferred on him these fa∣vours.</P>
<P>The earl, who introduced Charles to his ma∣jesty, and was present at the audience, declared that he never saw any one received so graciously. The king himself, after ordering his children into his presence, vouchsafed to present them to him. Your amiable son answered all questions put to him with a respectful freedom, and a no∣bleness of expression quite astonishing for his age. The young princes were desirous that he should from that moment remain about them. But he represented to them the occasion there was for his remaining yet some time in his fa∣ther's house, in order to profit by his instructi∣ons, and to render himself more worthy of the high office allotted him.</P>
<P>He owned to me afterwards, that he had ano∣ther reason for asking this delay: it was, that his friend William having only three months more to spend in England, he much wished to pass the remainder of that time with him. Thus you see, his presence of mind never for∣sakes him; nor can the seductions of fortune make him forget the duties of friendship.</P>

The earl gave yesterday a grand entertain∣ment in honour of your son. Charles received the compliments of all the company with as much grace as dignity. The many praises bestowed on him, excited not in him the least emotions of pride; and he left the company all captivated by his amiable qualities. Do not think, my dear friend, that the enthusiasm with which I speak of your son, is the effect of that partiality which I feel for your family: you will find the same testimonies in his favour in the letter which Lord—has written you.</P>
<P>We shall be detained about six days longer here, and then I hope to bring back to your arms the worthy object of your tenderness.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>SEPTEMBER 26.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I WAS so impatient, my dear mamma, to send you my friend Charles' letter, and that of Mr. Bartlet, that I had not time to give you those reflections which the good fortune of my friend have given birth to in my mind. Indeed, were I to attempt to say all that I think on this subject, my letter would not be finished to-day. I will therefore confine myself to the more easy and delightful task, of attempting to describe to you, how sensible I am of his faithful remem∣brance of our friendship. What then! Could he, for the sake of my society, during the re∣mainder of my stay here, resist the desires of the young princes, and sacrifice all the pleasures of a court! Ah! he has not made this sacrifice to an ungrateful friend. You will witness for me, mamma, how much I ever loved him, that all my letters were filled with expressions of my tenderness for him. Well then, he is now be∣come a thousand times more dear to me. Du∣ring

his absence, I have been made too sensible how necessary he is to my happiness. Notwith∣standing all the caresses of Mr. and Mrs. Gran∣dison, notwithstanding the friendship of Edward and Emily, I find that I miss him every hour in the day. I seem, as if I were but half myself, without him. I have no other resource, but to employ myself continually in doing something for him. Yes, mamma, all the business that we did when we were together, I now do alone, in order to render his absence less tedious to me. I have cultivated his garden, and ornamented it with the flowers of the season, that he may see, at his return, what care I have taken, of all that he is interested in. I have continued to copy a set of designs in architecture which he had be∣gun: they are not, it is true, so well drawn as he would have done them, but they are better than if I had done them for myself. I am sure that his friendship will excuse the weakness of my pencil, and that he will see them in his col∣lection with pleasure. I have also transcribed in∣to his music-books, all the new airs which we have had since his departure. I have arranged the books in his library; I have fed his birds; I have given something to his poor people: in short, I have attempted to do all that he would have done himself. It is at these times, that I have more than ever felt the force of that maxim, which you have so often repeated to me, that application to business is the best means of com∣posing the mind under grief or uneasiness. Ah! had I been condemned to idleness during this in∣terval of my friend's absence, how should I have
<PB N="323" REF="045437_0660_10202C3078057228"/>
been to be pitied! I have laboured not to leave a moment in the day vacant, lest I should fill it with my sadness. As a proof of this, I send you a little piece which I have just translated, on the advantages of industry.</P>
<P>Adieu, my dear mamma; now that my friend is so far from me, I doubly feel the pain of be∣ing so from you. I have no consolation but in knowing that you love me, and in feeling how much I love you.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="essay">
<HEAD>THE ADVANTAGES OF INDUSTRY.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Dorville, a rich manufacturer, was the most inveterate enemy to idleness. He not only dedicated the whole day to labour himself, but took care also, to have every person of his family employed in the same manner. Liberal to all whom age or infirmity had ren∣dered incapable of work, but implacable toward those idle vagabonds, who, with the advantages of health and strength, c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me to beg at his door. He would ask them why they did not work; and if they excused themselves, by saying that they could get no employment, he would offer it to them in his manufactory; but after once re∣fusing
<PB N="329" REF="045437_0661_10202C3367911EB0"/>
it, they dared never more approach his presence.</P>
<P>He never suffered a bale of goods either to be packed up or opened, without obliging his two sons Francis and Robert, to put their hands to it. He had a large garden behind his house, in which he made them both work, under the direction of his gardener: and during winter, he would employ them in turning, and other works of ingenuity. His three daughters, also, had not more time allowed them for idleness. They had the charge of the domestic oeconomy; with every other occupation suitable to their sex.</P>
<P>The better to excite their industry, Mr. Dor∣ville paid each for his work; and those among them, who had distinguished themselves by their activity, had an extraordinary reward. These little perquisites, they had the liberty of laying out in their own pleasures and amusements.</P>
<P>No quarrels or ill humour were ever heard in this family. They enjoyed perfect health, and each day brought with it new pleasures, by making them taste the sweets of their own labours.</P>
<P>If the boys presented to their sisters a nosegay of carnations or hyacinths, they received from them in return either embroidered ruffles, purses, or strings for their canes or watches, all, the work of their industrious hands. If their desserts were furnished by the fruit of their young trees, which they had planted and grafted themselves, they had the satisfaction to hear their parents
<PB N="330" REF="045437_0662_10202C37CA5700D0"/>
praise them, by acquainting their guests, to whom they owed their regale; at which, each would take his glass, and the company in chorus, drank to the health of the little gardener.</P>
<P>Seven days in the year, were celebrated as festivals in the family; these were the birth-days of each of the children, and those of their father and mother. Pleasure and mutual tenderness reigned on those occasions: particularly on the birth-days of their parents, when they generally gave an entertainment to the children, to which they invited their young acquaintance. The feast always ended in a ball, at which youthful vivacity, heightened by music, animated every look and motion, whilst their fond parents be∣held, with transports of joy, their playful gaiety and natural graces.</P>
<P>Who would believe, that these children should ever grow weary of a way of life so full of pleasure? This was, however, the case. Francis one day went to pay a visit to his young cousins: he returned home with a sorrowful contenance. His father, from some indirect words which he let fall, comprehended at once the cause of his chagrin: he, however, did not appear as if he observed it: In the mean while, as Francis wore the same face of sadness the next day, Mr. Dorville having engaged him to take a walk with him after dinner, over his plantations, they had together the following conversation.</P>

<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, papa, since you will have it, I must tell you: you keep us like so many slaves to our work from morning to night; there are my cousins, you see how their papa lets them spend their time; shall not we have as much fortune as they will?</P>

<P>What, my dear child, is this all that afflicts you? nothing can be easier, than to satisfy you in this business. God forbid, that I should make you work against your in∣clination; you are at full liberty to take your rest, and not to return to your work again, till you yourself desire it.</P>
</SP>
<P>Francis, happy to enjoy his liberty with the consent of his father, spent the rest of the day, in loitering about here and there, sometimes in the house, sometimes the garden.</P>
<P>Mr. Dorville always rose early; and when the weather was fine, generally amused himself with a walk into the country, and took with him those of his children, who the day before had been most diligent and attentive to their work. The next morning after this discourse, the early dawn promised a most beautiful day; Mr. Dorville was preparing to go out; Francis heard him; and though he was very sensible that he had not deserved the indulgence, he nevertheless hastened up, and asked his father's permission, to accompany him. Mr. Dorville willingly consented. They went together, and seated themselves at the top of a hill, from whence they had a view of the surrounding country. It was in the early part of the spring. The meadows, which but a month before were buried in snow, now displayed the most lively verdure. The woods were covered with tender foliage, and the fruit-trees adorned with the gayest blossoms. The harsh whistling of the north-wind, no more grated on the ear;
<PB N="333" REF="045437_0665_10202C3F31712290"/>
nothing was heard around, but the sweet warb∣ling of birds, Young lambs, and playful colts were seen sporting in the rich pasture-grounds. Echo resounded with the cheerful song of the labourer, as he trod the furrowed land The roads were filled with troops of country-people; some conducting their waggons loaded with corn, wine, and other merchandize; others carrying on their shoulders baskets filled with herbs and flowers. The young milk maids seemed to walk in cadence: all bent their steps toward the city, the gates of which were just opened to receive them. Francis, affected by this scene, felt his heart so elated with cheerful∣ness, that throwing himself into the arms of his father, he exclaimed. Oh! papa, I have you to thank for the pleasure which this moment affords me!</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>If all our friends were but here to enjoy it with us! I am sorry we did not call on your cousins, as we passed by their door.</P>

<P>Is it possible? Why then they spend one half of the day in sleep!</P>

<P>It is very well, my dear, but we have three hundred and sixty-five days in the year; if we take from these all the cold and wet mornings, there will scarcely remain sixty-five such as this of to-day.

<P>Why, papa, so long as I see my cup∣board furnished with the fruits of my labours, whilst I gather nosegays for my sisters, or fine fruits, and good vegetables to present to my mo∣ther, I find myself so happy, that I no longer think of the trouble that these things cost me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tell me: all the time which you have spent in cultivating your garden, or in turning; do you wish now that you had passed it in play?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, certainly, for then I should have had nothing to shew for it to-day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="337" REF="045437_0669_10202C4AF9CB8840"/>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would have had the re∣membrance of it at least. Do you reckon that nothing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is but a very little thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think, it appears from your own account, that play only amuses the present moment, and that it does not even always do that in proportion to our expectations; and that work, on the contrary, after having agreeably occupied us, leaves behind it some useful enjoy∣ment. After twenty years are past, you will have a renewed pleasure in gathering fruits from the trees which your hands have planted, though you will, by that time, forget all your fri∣volous pastimes. Decide therefore, yourself, which affords the most solid pleasure, useful labour, or vain amusement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! papa, according to the light in which you have set the thing, there is no room to balance. Labour, without dispute, renders us most happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>You see then, it was not with∣out reason that I have urged you to follow it. Were I to say to you, come, Francis, work no more; I will have you spend your whole time at play. Would it not be making you miserable for the rest of your life?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! yes, I can feel this now: every different play would soon become tedious and insupportable to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do they not, on the con∣trary, appear more sweet to you after labour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, papa, I confess, they do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="338" REF="045437_0670_10202C4F5692DEA0"/>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>At those times, I myself urge you to enjoy your pleasures. You know how often I have invited your cousins and your other companions to come and share in your amuse∣ments. Have you forgotten how you have wrestled together, and run races, and thrown the bar?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, papa, I remember it very well; you have yourself been so good as to assist almost always at our sports; and I have often seen you smile, when I have happened to have the advan∣tage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>And this was pretty often the case.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because I am stronger than any of my companions, especially my poor cousins; I never feared to engage with both of them at once.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps they are not so old as you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, you know very well that I am not so old as the youngest by a full year.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are better fed then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg your pardon; they live better every day of their lives than we do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not see then how you came by all this strength, unless it be the effect of labour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Excuse me, papa; I do not know how that can be; because I am so much weak∣ened sometimes by hard work that I can hardly stir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, my dear, who are those that run best?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="339" REF="045437_0671_10202C50DF6D5578"/>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Those who frequently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> races.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is the reason of this, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because they are used to run.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nevertheless, running weakens them, sometimes, as labour does you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, the next day are they less alert, or you less brisk?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>One word more. Have you never observed that some people have their limbs much more strong and nervous than others?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes, our blacksmith for instance: you have only to look at his arms; every muscle is expressive of vigour!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how, do you think, has he acquired this vigour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>How should I know? this man is the whole day with his body bent over his an∣vil; and he has been accustomed from his ear∣liest youth, to wield a hammer, which I can scarcely lift with both hands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, do you think he is stronger than I am?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! papa, I should be very sorry to see him lay hold of you, even if I were by to assist you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a farther proof, then, that labour strengthens the body. Here is a blacksmith who uses more violent exercise than I do, and yet he is more robust. You use more violent exercise than your cousins, and you are
<PB N="340" REF="045437_0672_10202C53D1C41C68"/>
more robust than they are: labour must certain∣ly have something to do in this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>I own I begin to think it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>You told me, just now, that your cousins eat very delicately.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think, however, they have frequent disorders in the stomach.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, almost always.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are you ever troubled with those complaints?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never, papa; you know very well that my appetite never fails me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, but on some days I ob∣serve, that you eat with more pleasure than ordi∣nary: especially after you have been digging in your garden.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, truly, I make a brisk attack upon your provisions after I have been hard at work.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how is this; work strengthens your arms and your stomach; it whets your appetite; and shall I prohibit it? No, certainly; I wish to see my son do honour to my table, without fearing indigestion, like his cousins: and I should be very sorry to see his companions outdo him in wrestling, or running races.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, papa, I have been told by ma∣ny people, that being so rich as you are, you ought not to make us work.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>These people talk like block∣heads, and you will be a still greater blockhead if you believe them. If you remain every day
<PB N="341" REF="045437_0673_101FFD1938A57ED0"/>
in bed till nine o'clock, can I, with all my money, make you enjoy such a fine morning as this!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, certainly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>For these many years to come, you will have to gather of the fruit of those trees which you have planted. You may also, from time to time, make presents to your sisters and friends of the pretty pieces of workmanship which you have made. This is the fruit of your industry, and a source of enjoyments which are for ever renewing. But with all my money, can I make the consequences of your amusements, when once they are past, equally sweet?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! no, papa.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>In short, can I, with all my riches, make your limbs robust, or preserve your stomach from indigestion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor this either.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Behold then what advantages you owe to labour! advantages so precious, that not all the gold in the world can procure them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot deny it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why is it that I get mo∣ney? Is it that my children may be happy or unhappy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>That they may be happy, without doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>And which of the two is most happy, he who slumbers away the best part of the morning in bed, or he, who by rising with the dawn, may, when the weather is fine, walk in the country, and contemplate the ravish∣ing beauties of nature?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>The latter, undoubtedly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="342" REF="045437_0674_10202C5C890904D0"/>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Again; which is the happiest, he who wastes his life in pursuit of vain plea∣sures, which by habit will become insipid, and which, when past, leave no trace behind them; or he, who employs his time in useful and plea∣sant labours, by which, he secures a thousand sweet enjoyments for the time to come?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! the latter, certainly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not ask you, whether it be best to have the limbs strong and robust, or ener∣vated; a fresh and lively complexion, or sickly paleness; vigorous health, or continual weak∣ness; and a good appetite, rather than perpetual indigestion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! it will not admit of a question.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have just allowed, that la∣bour gives us all these advantages.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Should I not then be highly blameable, if, in compliance to the opinions of certain silly people, I were to neglect to cultivate a love for work among my children, under the vain pretence that I am rich? when, with all my riches, I should but make them the more unhap∣py!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, I see it plainly, now; what a blockhead I was, when I grew tired of my work. Come, papa, the day is advanced: I am impatient to return to my usual occupations. I hope to have a pretty bouquet to give to my sisters, and some excellent strawberries for your dessert.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="343" REF="045437_0675_10202C5E10CDF4C8"/>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, my dear, I am charm∣ed to see you so reasonable: this encourages me to consult you on an affair of importance which I have in my mind. We will talk about it to∣morrow.</P>
</SP>
<P>On the morrow, Francis, a little proud, but still more curious to be of this consultation with his father, hastened the next day to attend him, with some degree of importance in his air.</P>
<P>It is a long time, son, said Mr. Dorville, since I have been thinking how to place a certain sum of money most advantageously for my children.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very good, papa.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am therefore very glad to consult you on this business.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Me, papa; O nothing can be more simple; you have only to throw it into trade.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is in that already, my dear; but on the contrary, I think of withdrawing it from trade, in order to make it more secure to you: in our way of business, we are exposed to many losses; I experience this every day; and in case some great stroke should befal us, I should wish to place a certain part of my fortune so se∣curely, as to ensure a comfortable subsistence to my children for the rest of their lives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should think, you might purchase houses?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, but then there is the hazard of their being burnt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>In that case buy land, that cannot be burnt at least.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="344" REF="045437_0676_10202C5FF5D43660"/>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true; but then if we do not ourselves attend to the cultivation of it, it will soon become barren and sink in value, after we have been at much expense on it; so that in the end, we shall find ourselves poor in the midst of large possessions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not know then, papa, what ad∣vice to give you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly, child, I see no way of absolutely securing this sum, but by spending it in such a manner that we never can lose the interest of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, papa, spend a sum of money for fear you should lose it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Even so; for instance: if I should lay it out in giving you useful acquire∣ments, which would make you independent of all reverses of fortune; you then would be, in whatever situation chance might throw you, able to procure the necessaries of life. You un∣derstand accounts and book-keeping; you know every thing belonging to the cultivation of trees; you are a tolerable turner; your brother and sisters have also their particular talents: it has cost me a great deal of money to have you in∣structed in these things. I will sacrifice yet more, to make you complete; and then, I shall look upon you as possessing more riches, than those who have a great inheritance; for we may lose our fortune, but useful knowledge remains with us for ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, papa, you are in very easy cir∣cumstances; you are master of a good manu∣facture;
<PB N="345" REF="045437_0677_10202C6454248650"/>
and I think with that we never can want.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>Much richer people than we are, have experienced reverses of fortune, and it is good to be prepared against all possible events. I recollect a story which will illustrate this obser∣vation: I will relate it to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Francis.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray do, papa; I shall be glad to hear it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Dorville.</SPEAKER>
<P>A young gentleman in Ger∣many paid his addresses to a very amiable lady, and asked her in marriage of her father. The father said to him, I will give you my daughter very willingly, but have you a good trade to maintain her and her children? A trade, Sir, answered the young gentleman? are you igno∣rant that I possess a large country-seat in your neighbourhood, with a considerable estate be∣sides? All this is nothing, replied the father of the lady; your house may be burnt, your land may suffer devastation; besides this, many other ruinous accidents may happen to you, which I cannot foresee. In a word, if you wish to ob∣tain my daughter, you must learn some trade, or I shall not be satisfied. It is the absolute con∣dition of our alliance. It was in vain that the young gentleman remonstrated: the father would not recede. What was to be done? he loved the lady too passionately to give her up. He put himself apprentice therefore to a basket-maker, the easiest business he could think of; and it was not till after he had made a very neat basket, and some other pieces of workmanship, before the
<PB N="346" REF="045437_0678_10202C556064D4D8"/>
eyes of her father, that he could obtain the la∣dy.</P>
</SP>
<P>During the first years of his marriage, he laughed inwardly at the foresight of his father-in-law, and the whimsical condition which he had imposed upon him; but he had soon occa∣sion to see the matter in a much more serious light.</P>
<P>War was declared: the enemy entered his province. They ravaged his lands; cut down his forests; demolished his castle; pillaged his ef∣fects; and obliged him and his family to take flight: our rich gentleman found himself all at once reduced to indigence. At first he did no∣thing but deplore his ill-fortune, living with dif∣ficulty on the little money that he had saved: but this resource soon failed him. He then be∣thought himself of the trade which he had learn∣ed. His spirits began to recover, and he gave himself up to work with the more ardour, as he had taken refuge in a city where his name and rank were unknown. His wife, between the intervals of her domestic occupations, comforted him under his labours. The children were em∣ployed to sell the baskets which he made. In this manner, he provided decently for the support of himself and family, until the happy moment arrived, which by the return of peace, restored him again to the possessions of his fortune.</P>
<P>This story made a lively impression on Fran∣cis. He related it himself to his brother and sisters, who were also as much taken with it. It put them upon making a number of reflections on the wisdom of providing resources against the
<PB N="347" REF="045437_0679_101FFD1ADE65A590"/>
unexpected turns of fortune. Alas! they did not then foresee that they soon would have occa∣sion to apply this to themselves. A little time after, a fire broke out in the night in one of Mr. Dorville's magazines; and all the buildings be∣longing to his manufactory were consumed be∣fore any assistance could be got to stop the flames. Another man might have been cast down by this disaster; but, on the contrary, it served only to fortify his resolution, and redouble his activity. All his friends were eager to support him. His industry made the best use of these advantages, by labouring to repair his losses. Nor did this reverse of fortune prevent his daughters from being sought in marriage by the richest and most sensible men; because they knew, that, in them they should find women capable of conducting the affairs of their house, with oeconomy and prudence. As for his two sons, they applied themselves with such indefatigable ardour to bu∣siness, that, in a few years their affairs were not only re-established, but carried to a degree of prosperity, which they had never known before that misfortune which seemed to have over∣thrown them for ever.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XX. WILLIAM DANVERS TO HIS MOTHER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>SEPTEMBER 27.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>O MY dear mamma, what danger my friend Charles has been in! Alas! I have been within a little of losing him! I tremble yet whilst I think of it. What would have become of me if he had been as brutal as his adversary; if he had either lost his life, or taken away that of his antagonist, and been obliged to fly his country? Happily all has terminated to his ho∣nour; whilst he is preserved to his family, and to his friend, he has given us fresh reason to love and esteem him. But I am too long without sa∣tisfying your curiosity: read, pray read the let∣ter which Mr. Grandison has just received from Mr. Bartlet. I have spent the whole evening in transcribing it in order to send it to you. Oh! my dear mamma, how many times has my heart beat whilst I was taking this copy! But it is not of me that it speaks; forget me, I pray you, for a few moments, that you may be the more at li∣berty to attend to my friend.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXI. MR. BARTLET TO MR. GRANDISON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>SEPTEMBER 26.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I CAN never sufficiently congratulate you on the happiness of possessing such a son as your's. I was witness yesterday, without his knowing it, to an adventure which does him in∣finite honour. But why should I be astonished at his conduct, when I only see, in it, the effect of the good example and wise lessons which he has received from you! We fell in company yesterday with a Mr. Stukely, son to Lord G—, a young man of a most violent and brutal cha∣racter: though he is but eighteen years of age, he is devoured by ambition and envy. I had already observed, that he was jealous of the post which your son had obtained. He threw out many spiteful sarcasms, which Charles, with ad∣mirable self-command, passed over in silence. They engaged in a game of piquet together. Stukely, like a bully, took advantage of your son's moderation, pluming himself on a false cou∣rage
<PB N="350" REF="045437_0682_10202B4BD1A2E098"/>
He took occasion to quarrel with him at play, in so pointed a manner, that Charles could not refrain from shewing his indignation, by his looks. I will give you their conversation, word for word.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Methinks, Sir, you do not seem to take much pleasure in this game, had not we better leave off?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stukely, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(throwing the cards on the table.)</STAGE>
<P>Very true. There is very little pleasure in playing with people who understand nothing of the game.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very possible, I do not under∣stand it so well as you, by a great deal: I do not play so much.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stukely.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you are not better informed in other things, I fear you will find it somewhat difficult to support the honour that you so lately obtained.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not look upon the science of gaming to be absolutely necessary, to this pur∣pose. But let us talk of something else, if you please. You have a very pretty snuff-box.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stukely.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would like such an one perhaps, with your new dignity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would be quite useless to me; I do not take snuff. I think it better not to ac∣custom myself to it, at my age.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stukely.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you mean by that, that I am wrong in taking it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means. I have nothing to say against what you or your parents think pro∣per.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="351" REF="045437_0683_10202B4D5B26B6D0"/>
<SPEAKER>Stukely.</SPEAKER>
<P>My parents have nothing to do in this business; it is sufficient that I like it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well. Each according to his own way of thinking.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stukely.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a dutiful little boy! He won't take a pinch of snuff, without asking leave of his papa and mamma.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is very true, I do nothing with∣out consulting them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stukely.</SPEAKER>
<P>I ought not to be surprized at this: you are not so old as I am yet, therefore, are not fit to think and act for yourself. You want time for improvement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope indeed to be better informed, when I come to your age.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stukely.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you mean to insult me, Sir? by telling me that you are better informed than I am!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Better than you, Sir! I am inca∣pable of so gross a rudeness. You must certainly comprehend what I said, that at your age, I hoped to be better informed than I am now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stukely.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have the art of evading your own words.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir. I think, before I speak: my words, therefore, need no evasion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stukely.</SPEAKER>
<P>Enough. Shall we go into the gar∣den together?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart, Sir. I have no objection.</P>
</SP>
<P>Stukely rose up hastily, putting his hand to his sword: Charles calmly laid his in an armed chair, and followed Stukely with a firm air. I waited till they were out of the room, intending
<PB N="352" REF="045437_0684_10202B4EE6F25A28"/>
to follow them, as I perceived, plainly, that Stuke∣ly meant to pick a quarrel. They walked at some distance from each other, toward a little grove at the farther end of the garden. I went a shorter way to the same place, and hid myself behind a clump of trees, where I could conveni∣ently listen to their conversation, which was as follows.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stukely.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where is your sword? You had it on just now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Sir: but I left it in the house▪</P>

<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, pray? I do not want my sword, to walk in the garden.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stukely.</SPEAKER>
<P>No: but you want it, to repair the offence that you have given me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>The offence! It is somewhat strange, that I should have offended you, without know∣ing it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stukely.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have offended me, however, and I only waited, till we were alone, to take notice of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>You might as well then have done that before. I should not have been afraid of wit∣nesses to what had passed between us, as I am con∣scious, that it is against my principles to offend any one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stukely.</SPEAKER>
<P>To what end are all these words; fetch your sword. I will either have satisfaction, or you must ask my pardon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ask your pardon, Sir! Had I offend∣ed you, I should not wait till you required it: but as the matter stands, it is perfectly use less.</P>

<SPEAKER>Stukely.</SPEAKER>
<P>But why did you leave your sword, when you saw that I wore mine?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>What was that to me, Sir? I see no reason why I must regulate my actions b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stukely.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was, however, to say the least, a great imprudence on your part.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>As how, pray? Had I taken you for an assassin, I should doubtless have kept my sword. Then indeed you would have had cause to take offence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stukely.</SPEAKER>
<P>You put me out of patience; my sword is now in the scabbard, but take notice, I advise you to beware.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very easy, Sir, having nothing to fear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stukely.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing to fear! Do you expect, that I can bear, without resentment, that a per∣son of inferior birth to myself, and my junior, by four years, should arrive at a preferment which I think I have a better right to?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have been a long while in co∣ming to the point. I guessed that this was at the bottom of your displeasure. You are very good to give yourself the trouble to envy me for it, when I do not envy you the advantage of your high birth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stukely.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, do you despise this advantage then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly not, but, I should be very foolish to be jealous of it, or to dispute it with you sword in hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stukely.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because, my sword can no more take your birth, from you, than your's can the post,
<PB N="354" REF="045437_0686_10202B562C7B19A8"/>
which the king has been pleased to confer on me. Reflect upon this; and then, tell me, whether there is any occasion for us to cut each other's throats.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stukely.</SPEAKER>
<P>But people fight often to prove their skill in the sword.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>We may as well do this with our foils; and I will, if you please, meet you at the fencing-school, where we may try our skill to the utmost, and settle this grand quarrel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stukely.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do-you laugh at me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>God forbid: but I must confess, I fear, our duel will be laughed at, and that the world will say, here are two young cowards, who have agreed together to give each other a scratch, to make parade of their courage. Will you lis∣ten to me, and accept of a satisfaction which will suit us both much better?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stukely.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is this: that in all things in which you are really my superior, I shall never blush to acknowledge you as such; and that I believe you will have the same sentiments with regard to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stukely, </SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(putting up his sword.)</STAGE>
<P>Well then, it is I, that ought first to render you the homage so justly your due. Yes, amiable Grandison, you have conquered; and I yield to you. You have made me but too sensible of the unworthi∣ness of my behaviour. Would you could but pardon me as sincerely, as I reproach myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Enough, Sir; I have no longer any resentment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stukely.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let this scene, I conjure you, remain for ever a profound secret. It is enough, for me,
<PB N="355" REF="045437_0687_10202B57B574C0E0"/>
to carry about with me the remembrance of it, without meeting the reproaches of others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be easy, Stukely: I give you my hand, as a pledge of my secrecy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Stukely.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I receive it, with confidence: I do not dare to ask your friendship; but let me live in the hope of obtaining it, by assisting to make me more worthy.</P>
</SP>
<P>After having embraced, the two young men returned back together into the house. Nobody knew any thing of this adventure. It redounds as much to the honour of your son, as to the disgrace of his adversary; had he not in some sort repaired it, by the last part of his behaviour. Throughout the whole of this delicate circum∣stance, Charles manifested a courage, without rashness, and moderation, without weakness. Though young and unarmed, he knew how to bring his adversary to terms, by the force of his reasons. In a word, I know not which the most to admire in him, his prudence, or his in∣trepidity.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXII. WILLIAM DANVERS TO HIS MOTHER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE>OCTOBER 2.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MY friend Charles is at length returned, my dear mamma. What was our joy at seeing him again. The moment of his return served as a signal for a feast. Without saying any thing to Mr. Grandison, the young boys of the village had erected, with the boughs of trees, a triumphal arch at the entrance of the avenue. The young girls, in their best attire, waited with baskets of flowers, which they strewed before him. It was by a cry of, Long live Charles Grandison, that his approach was first announced to us. We immediately ran to meet him, Mrs. Grandison leading the way. He threw himself out of the carriage into the arms of his parents. Mrs. Grandison pressed him to her heart, bath∣ing him with her tears; and Mr. Grandison, as he embraced him, strove in vain to conceal his. As for Emily, her arms seemed fastened round his neck; and Edward, also, was much rejoiced: though the eldest, he seemed to look up to his brother with a kind of respect. But, mamma, I
<PB N="357" REF="045437_0689_10202B5EF88D6EA8"/>
cannot describe to you what I felt. I wept, I sighed, as if I had been in trouble; whilst my heart was filled with the most lively joy. Ah! when it came to my turn to embrace him, how closely did I hold him in my arms! I thought of you at the same time. Ah! said I to myself, if I could but this moment carry my friend into the presence of my mamma! The servants ran backward and forward, crying out with joy. They would have given the world to have em∣braced and kissed him as we did. No one was ever beloved like him; nor was any one ever so worthy of it. All the country-people came yes∣terday evening, and danced under our windows; and to-night, there was a general illumination throughout the village.</P>
<P>Charles has received this morning the compli∣ments of all the neighbouring nobility. What an honour at his age! But he is not rendered proud by it: on the contrary, he is more modest than before. Is not this the best proof in the world that he is worthy of his dignity?</P>
<P>Just as we were sitting down to table, the old gardener (Matthews) came in: he is the husband of Mrs. Grandison's nurse. He lives about three miles off, on a pension allowed him by Mr. Grandison, upon which he passes a happy old age. He advanced slowly on his crutches to pay his compliments. Charles saw him at the end of the avenue, and ran to meet him. He took him by the hand, and brought him to his mo∣ther. He made him sit down to table next to himself. You see, mamma, that honours have not changed the nature of my friend. A young
<PB N="358" REF="045437_0690_10202B61EF1DF360"/>
of honour makes an old gardener sit by his side, and serves him all dinner-time! Not that I saw any thing so extraordinary in this, but I could perceive, that Edward was inwardly asto∣nished at it. I do not know how it is, said he to his brother after dinner, but this visit of Mat∣thews seemed to give you more pleasure than all the rest. It is true, answered Charles: the words of this honest man are not made up of vain compliments; they come from the heart. He would not, at his age, have walked three miles on his crutches to congratulate me, if he had not been sincerely rejoiced at my good for∣tune; and besides, ought I not to love him who had the care of dear mamma's infancy? I am sure, he loves her as if she was his own daugh∣ter. Charles was in the right; for during the whole meal, I had my eyes fixed upon this good old man; and though he was in the gayest spi∣rits, I could frequently observe his eyes filled with tears, when he turned them toward Mrs. Grandison. The worthy Matthews wished to return home early, because of the length of the walk; but in order to enjoy his company long∣er, Charles easily prevailed on his father to send him back in his carriage.</P>
<P>You may well imagine, my dear mamma, that I could not be witness to all these scenes, without figuring to myself the happy day on which I shall return to you. Alas! I shall have no place or dignities to bring back to you, but I shall at least have done all in my power to bring you back a heart less unworthy of your affection. No illuminations will celebrate my return; but
<PB N="359" REF="045437_0691_10202B6377C32D50"/>
I shall see your eyes, and those of my sister, shine through their tears with all the brightness of joy. I shall receive no flattering compliments on the advancement of my fortune, but I shall receive from your mouth the words of love; I shall receive your kisses and caresses. I do not envy my friend the favours bestowed on him by the bounty of heaven: I feel, that be deserves them better, than I. But when I see him in the arms of his mother, I ask why am not I in those of my dear mamma. I have nothing but you to love on earth, and I am far from you. You are all my riches, and I possess you not. Oh! mamma, my dear mamma? I must break off: I must not give myself up to these cruel reflections! I should have strength enough, perhaps, to sup∣port them for myself alone, but not for you. It is not my own grief which I fear, it is your's. I should not dread afflictions, were it not for the fear of afflicting you.</P>
