<P>KNOW YE NOT THAT THERE IS A PRINCE, AND A GREAT MAN, FAL∣LEN THIS DAY IN ISRAEL?</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THAT elevation and depression of the hu∣man character, so observable, forms one of those striking contrasts in which nature seems to delight in all her works. While, by a happy disposition of circumstances, the few fortunate travellers ascend the lofty summit of human ho∣nour and glory, the multitude, far below, move down the vale of obscurity, unnoticed, into soon-forgotten graves. Man, having opportunities and calls for constant exertion, finds his capa∣cities unfolding, his mind growing to his situa∣tion,
<PB N="6" REF="037944_0005_100F6C541F8C7E08"/>
till in the end he becomes as much greater than others, as his circle was larger. He may, by being placed in advantageous circumstances in society, be instrumental of almost infinite good to millions; and generations yet unborn, as they rise, shall call him blessed.</P>
<P>BUT few situations will admit extensive useful∣ness. The circle in which the greater part move is very confined; consequently their usefulness and fame are very limited. Happy for the world when the few elevated seats in a nation are filled with truly great men, who delight in diffusing liberty, peace and happiness through their exten∣sive circle of influence.</P>
<P>OUR text is the remark of David to his subjects, on the death of Abner, a distinguished General over the armies of Israel. Above deception and revenge himself, he did not suspect them in one that called himself his friend. He fell a sacrifice to the ambition and revenge of a rival, who was jealous of his deserving and possessing the pub∣lic confidence and esteem above himself. Da∣vid, sensible of his worth as a man, of his pru∣dence,
<PB N="7" REF="037944_0006_100F6C5845DA2F28"/>
bravery and success as an officer, most tenderly laments his premature fall; and by example teaches us the propriety of lamenting public characters, who have rendered essential services to their country and the world.</P>
<P>THERE is then a sense, in which man may, in the language of inspiration, be called great. We <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>all,</P>
<P N="1">I. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>NQUIRE what constitutes a man great in the sense of our text.</P>
<P N="2">II. SHOW the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>opriety of publicly lamenting such men.</P>
<P N="1">I. We are to inquire what constitutes man great. To give him this character in the judg∣ment of the world, three things are principally im∣portant.</P>
<P N="1">1. A MIND which can embrace large and exten∣sive views of human things. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> reason and intelligence a man possesses, the higher he rises in the scale of existence. Men differ as much in their intellectual powers, as in the constitution of their bodies. Some come into life with feeble
<PB N="8" REF="037944_0007_100F6C59C831DEB0"/>
constitutions—always incapable of those bodily labours and exertions, which others can support. So some have less intelligence—are incapable of such large, comprehensive views of things—and therefore incapacitated for acting upon a broad, extensive plan. The more extensive views a man has, the deeper he penetrates into men and things, the more noble creature he is. Hence the infi∣nite intelligence of GOD—his cap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f com∣prehending perfectly all things in the universe— confer inconceivable dignity on the Divine Mind. Could we suppose the Divine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d to possess less intelligence—were his views diminished—had he a less perfect acquaintance with all things—he would not be so great as he now is. Extensive views of things—capacities equal to great occa∣sions—form the great man.</P>
<P N="2">2. SUCH a mind, to appear great, must be placed in such ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/>ances as admit of expressing in <HI>action</HI> these enlightened conceptions. This is necessary to give such a mind is due expansion, and call forth all its energies. Man is, in a great degree, the creature of circumstances and occa∣sions.
<PB N="9" REF="037944_0008_100F6C5C34E5D308"/>
The mind enlarges by exercise, and, like the body, owes its growth and strength to its own operation. Let a man possess the most extensive views of things—great degrees of prudence, for∣titude, and bravery—yet, if he is never called to act in a situation which demands these energies of mind, he cannot appear to possess them. There is fire in the flint; but, unless it is smitten, it will not shine. Hence great occasions always produce great men—display their greatness to the world▪ Seasons of public and national danger have called forth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> men, who were able to take hold of these great events, and direct them with fortitude and prudence. These great events, and national concerns, are as familiar to such a mind, and conducted with as much ease and or∣der, as others guide their little domestic affairs. There is real greatness and dignity in a mind equal to great events—which can direct them with a steady hand. When we cast our eyes up∣on the heavens, and observe their order, their motions, and revolutions, how great does that All-presiding Mind appear, which can direct all
<PB N="10" REF="037944_0009_100F6C5F8C8A8688"/>
their movements! In this way the powers of the Divine Mind are exhibited, and GOD appears great. It is in <HI>action</HI> that a being appears great. When we see a man forming great designs, and with facility carrying them into effect, he appears great. Actions, in which great wisdom, pru∣dence, courage and fortitude are displayed, indi∣cate a great mind.</P>
<P N="3">3. TRUE greatness consists in directing these extensive views, and great actions, to the good of mankind. To be great as agents of destruction— in diffusing misery—is the greatness of devils. This has been the greatness of many men, in all ages of the world. Many, before and since the Macedonian and the Swede, have performed ac∣tions which have astonished the world, with de∣sign only to shackle and exterminate the human race. Such men abundantly merit the eternal execrations of GOD and man. Could we suppose that Deity created the world, and peopled it with rational creatures, with intention of making them all miserable; such a design, and such an ope∣ration, could not be called great, but infinitely
<PB N="11" REF="037944_0010_100F6C61898312E8"/>
dreadful. In what an amiable point of light do the designs and actions of Jesus Christ appear, a∣bove those, for instance, of Alexander! Both possessed extensive designs, and performed great actions: but look at their objects: one went forth to conquer and destroy the world; and, when he had done it, wept that there was not another world to encrimson with its blood. The oth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> cam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>not to destroy men's lives, but to save them.</HI> A m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n who can step forward, and direct th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffairs of a nation—from confusion bring forth order—cause li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> to spring from darkness—and by his exertions give liberty and good govern∣ment to unborn generations; he is great—he is godlike. Such men in scripture are called Gods. But, alas! they must die like men. This leads to show,</P>
<P N="2">II. THE propriety of lamenting such characters, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> they fall. <HI>Know ye not that there is a great man fallen this day in Israel▪</HI> This language could be adopted in no age, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no nation, with more propriety than by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he people of America this day. The beauty, excellence and glory of
<PB N="12" REF="037944_0011_100F6C64CB6CB690"/>
America is fallen upon one of her high places. In him, how much worth has left our land and world! From Mount Vernon, the great, the excellent WASHINGTON, like Moses from Pisgah, has taken his flight to heaven, and, like him, left a nation in tears. He has left us, and left us without the consolation which Moses gave his people—<HI>that</HI> GOD <HI>would raise them up another like unto him.</HI> This hope we can hardly indulge. Our pillar seems removed from us; <HI>and the crown is fallen from our head.</HI> National sorrow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no more than justice to his char<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ter and national services. When a man of such distinguished worth; who hath rendered such eminent services to his country; when he falls a victim to death, we may say—<HI>A great man indeed hath fallen in our Israel.</HI> Not to notice his death, would indicate forgetfulness of his services, and ingratitude <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> GOD, who raised him up as our National Saviour.</P>
<P>MEN, who have benefited the world by their example and active services, are public blessings to the human race. It is a distinguished favour to a people to have a truly great man in some
<PB N="13" REF="037944_0012_100F6C664E8FF378"/>
important post in society. His example is most salutary on the public mind. To see a man con∣stantly acting from noble, disinterested views— sacrificing private considerations for the public good—employing his enlightened mind in form∣ing just and noble plans for national prosperity and happiness—to see him directing the com∣plicated concerns of a nation with success—tends to elevate the mind, and expose that low selfish∣ness, which cannot sacrifice a little private good for public happiness.</P>
<P>THE example of Jesus Christ is frequently proposed, in scripture, for the imitation and im∣provement of christians. So the example of a great man, in social, civil and military life, may conduce to the improvement of mankind in all these characters. No man hath more adorned the character of the private citizen, softened and hum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed that of the soldier, and dignified that of the statesman, than GEORGE WASHING∣TON. We have seen him great in counsel and in arms—crowned with success and glory, both in the cabinet and field; yet modest—not eleva∣ted
<PB N="14" REF="037944_0013_100F6C67D15EB760"/>
with his own greatness, not dazzled with the splendor of his own great actions, nor intoxicated with the praises of millions—indeed of the world. We have seen him modestly declining the ap∣plauses of those whom he had so eminently bene∣fited by his labours and toils. Possessing that fine sensibility of soul which ever accompanies true greatness, he blushed at his own deserved ho∣nours: and we have seen his manly countenance, which was never discomposed by fear, softened in∣to a profusion of tears, at the respect of a grateful people. A little mind, on such occasions, would be lifted into a god; and never would be satisfied, unless his humble worshippers had bowed the knee, and in the language of eastern idolaters said, <HI>O king, live forever.</HI> But a great mind is satisfied with the consciousness of having benefited man∣kind. This is more acceptable and pleasing to it, than all their applauses. The death of such a man should be lamented for the loss of his ex¦ample.</P>
<P>DEATH hath also closed the scene of his public and important services for his country. When
<PB N="15" REF="037944_0014_100F6C6A3A931E00"/>
the head of a rising family, who guides his affairs with prudence, is taken away, the loss to them is great. He can no more return to his house. They can no more be benefited by his counsels and labours. A nation may be as greatly benefit∣ed by some great public character, as a family is by its prudent, industrious head. A single man may, under GOD, really deserve the character of the <HI>deliverer and saviour</HI> of his country; and may, by his counsels and dangers, transmit from one generation to another the invaluable blessings of liberty and good government to millions, when he is no more. A nation may, after being essentially benefited by the extensive views, and active la∣bours, of some great character, still need his as∣sistance in seasons of national danger and distress. The reputation and influence of a man who is great in counsel and arms, and who hath pros∣pered in whatever he hath put his hand to, tend greatly to dismay the enemies, and animate the friends, of his country. In this view the death of WASHINGTON is a public loss, and greatly to be lamented in the present crisis.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="037944_0015_100F6C6E6DCD3070"/>WE are justified in scripture in lamenting this great man; and we feel it no profanation of this day, to bring into view our national obligations to that great, that excellent man, who is no more. Death hath shown us he was but man: and in lamenting him we are countenanced by abundant scriptural examples. When we read the biogra∣phical memoirs of distinguished men, who have essentially benefited their generation and posteri∣ty, and follow them to the closing hour of life, we find a general sorrow to prevail. It seems a com∣mon sentiment of human nature, that such men should not descend into the grave without general testimonials of public respect. Mankind have, in all ages and countries, generally united in bedew∣ing the grave of a benefactor with their tears. Such sentiments and conduct are certainly ratio∣nal; and the public expression of them is due to distinguished merit, and eminent public services. Let the hearse of the insignificant and worthless-great be followed by a procession of mercenary mourners, who seek to hide the tears they do not shed—let them purchase the sorrow which their
<PB N="17" REF="037944_0016_100F2E184FD154E8"/>
merit cannot excite—let them rear their proud monuments, and flattery lavish her inscriptions, to perpetuate and emblazon a worthless name;— WASHINGTON has a living monument—a monument in every heart, deeply inscribed with his actions and virtues—a monument, which will be rebuilt in every future generation, and will crumble only with the skies. America mourns— her tears will fall, as liberal and pure as the drops of heaven. He was her father; and her sons will remember that the soil which they reap, and the ocean which laves their shores, were secured by his toils. And her fair daughters will recollect that WASHINGTON made them mothers—not of a degraded race of slaves, but of a free, indepen∣dent nation.</P>
<P>EVERY man is bound to commit the remains of a father to the grave with decency and respect. So a nation may be under obligations to commit the sacred ashes of a public benefactor to the grave with respect and tears: and should they withhold them, the stones might reprove their insensibility.</P>
<P>MOSES, in every view, was a great man. He
<PB N="18" REF="037944_0017_100F6C74246598B0"/>
was raised up to break Egyptian chains, and libe∣rate a great nation. He put himself at their head, fought their battles, shared their toils, gave them a system of civil government, and through a long life administered it with undeviating integrity; rais∣ed them to great national respectability, and put their dread on surrounding nations. After a long life thus spent, he suddenly, like our American Moses, drops mortality, and dwells with his GOD. Though individuals, envying his honour, had faulted his administration, and excited insurrec∣tion, still he was venerated in life, and greatly la∣mented in death. We are informed that <HI>the chil∣dren of Israel wept for Moses, in the plains of Moab, thirty days.</HI></P>
<P>IN being just to acknowledge all our national de∣liverances, and public mercies, as the gifts of GOD, we should not overlook those distinguished instru∣ments by which they have been conveyed. We may rob man, as well as GOD, in withholding from him his deserved share of love and respect.</P>
<P>THE MAN, so justly deserving the love and re∣spect of AMERICA, is now no more. By his pru∣dence, fortitude and success, he hath received the
<PB N="19" REF="037944_0018_100F6C75F4CA5BC8"/>
applauses of the world. Raised up, like Moses, to redeem a people from foreign domination, with a like modesty he accepted from Congress, in 1775, the command of the American forces. Contend∣ing with veteran troops, and generals who had figured on the European stage of war, he was found their superior in the day of battle. Early did he step forth in the expiring cause of liberty. Possessed of superior fortitude to support evils, and bravery to front dangers, he nobly triumphed in the field; generously refusing any compensation for all his toils, but that divine one, of having ren∣dered the most important services to his country. Through a long, arduous revolution, he finally led us to victory, independence and glory. He then returned to his peaceful home, with the blessings of his country.</P>
<P>AT a period perhaps equally difficult, he was called by the voice of his grateful sons, to save them—not from the ravages of a foreign enemy, but one still worse—domestic discord and insur∣rection. Raised to the Presidential chair, his plas∣tic hand soon healed our civil wounds, and restor∣ed us to a state of political vigour and happiness.
<PB N="20" REF="037944_0019_100F6C77958012F8"/>
Having filled the chair, for eight years, with ex∣tensive usefulness, dignity and glory, he declined the future suffrages of his country. He claimed an exemption from the oppressive cares of public <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>—a retirement so pleasing to increasing years, and a mind worn in the public good. To Mount Vernon we saw him retire, to seek repose in the tranqui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> scenes of private life. There our thoughts attended him; and our prayers ascended, that he might enjoy every social and religious pleasure, protracted to a good old age, and then be gently laid to rest in the lap of our common mother.</P>
<P>BY the threats and lawless depredations of a na∣tion of robbers and atheists, the constituted au∣thority of our country invited him to the first military command in the nation. And, to the joy of America, he accepted the appointment. In this high command Death found him labouring for the good of his country.</P>
<P>SINCE Moses, no people have owed more to any one man, than America does to that beloved name, GEORGE WASHINGTON. Like Moses, he had some enemies—sufficient to prove his worth. This is a tribute which great worth
<PB N="21" REF="037944_0020_100F6C79F9669868"/>
must pay. These men have proved themselves the enemies of all civil and religious order and happiness. While in office, they have been con∣tinually pining away with unsatisfied desires to see him blunder in his political race, and plunge from his eminent station of usefulness and glory into obscurity and contempt. As the sore, wounded eye is pained by the cheering rays of the sun, so envy is tortured at such a constellation of virtues as distinguished the illustrious WASHINGTON. While his few enemies have impatiently beheld his wisdom and inflexible integrity, we have en∣joyed every blessing which the nature of his ap∣pointment would admit. About the term of six∣teen years hath this great man conducted our arms and councils; at the head of which, he hath appeared the brave, the fortunate, the hu∣mane General, and the wise, the prudent, the accomplished Statesman. In these wide, extensive fields has he gathered laurels which will never fade while liberty and good policy are known in the world. The circumstances of his life have been remarkable. He has always been the honour and glory of his offices. Instead of wearing them out,
<PB N="22" REF="037944_0021_100F6C7C5B2DCF38"/>
he hath clothed them with increasing usefulness and glory. No man ever possessed a reputation for prudence and integrity more unspotted, and a character which the world has more generally ad∣mired. His humanity, his public spirit, with his many other virtues, will be applauded by pos∣terity.</P>
<P>AS to his religion, let charity follow him into the noise and confusion of the camp—into the perplexing cares of government—and observe his constant devotional retirement, which he was known to practise; let her see him in his house, bowing before the SUPREME MAJESTY with the lowest of his fellow creatures; let her see his de∣votions in the church; let her connect his reve∣rence of GOD with his love of man, and would she not say, <HI>Truly, this is a righteous man?</HI></P>
<P>THIS great man has now bid a final adieu to his family, to his country, and the world. The mournful tidings are now circulating our country, and will soon reach the distant corners of the globe. It will long be remembered, that GEORGE WASHINGTON, after a life of ex∣tensive usefulness, and unspotted honour and glo∣ry,
<PB N="23" REF="037944_0022_100F6C7EE2462F68"/>
terminated his mortal existence on the four∣teenth of December, 1799, in the sixty-eighth year of his age; ripe in days and virtue.</P>
<P>WE have dwelt with mournful pleasure on his memory; but we must bid him adieu—a long adieu! Farewell, happy shade! We will recount thy virtues and patriotic labours for the improve∣ment and admiration of our rising offspring: ear∣ly shall they learn to li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> thy name, and hail thee as the benefactor and saviour of their country.</P>
<P>MEN, BRETHREN AND FATHERS,</P>
<P>WE now see what man is—what the great man is. Such men rise, like the sun, to gladden and bless the world; like him they run their course with extensive usefulness and glory, and then go down and leave the world in night. Moses and Joshua, David and Solomon, with all the other deliverers and benefactors of mankind, after hav∣ing served their generation and the world in the most acceptable manner, must fall asleep. They must leave the throne, the council and the field, and retire where "kings and slaves have equal thrones." When the mighty fall, and the high∣est
<PB N="24" REF="037944_0023_100F6C8254E1A460"/>
seats of honour are robbed of their amiable possessors, how plainly do we see the vanity of man at his best estate! When we see the great s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ipping from their elevated seats, and making their abode in the dust, we see how short the dis∣tinction is between the great and the small in this world. Let all remember, that soon they will appear in that world, in which no distinction will remain, but that eternal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, between the good and bad. Let us occupy our talents well, whe∣ther one, two, or five: so shall our Lord and Master say—<HI>Well done, good and faithful servants! enter <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the joys of yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Lord.</HI></P>
