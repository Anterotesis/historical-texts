<HEAD>The INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>AS the Universal Good of Mankind is, or, at least, ought to be, as well the particular End of every private Member of that large Community, as the more general Aim and Ambition of all publick Societies; it con∣sequently follows. That all Actions, De∣signs, and Inventions, tending mediately, or immediately to the promoting that great and glorious Design, must, in themselves, be essentially good, and therefore Praise∣worthy; and to be encourag'd and supported by all those who, partaking of that Nature, are in a Capacity to re∣ceive the Benefit and Advantage of such Undertakings: And if so, as there is no Blessing in the Treasure of Provi∣dence of so true and inestimable a Value as HEALTH, which (as a good Ground in a Consort of Musick, mo∣dulates and forms the Variety of Sounds, into a most agre∣able and delightful Harmony) is the very Basis and Foundation of all other subordinate Pleasures, Delights and Satisfactions, so, on Course, the promoting, preser∣ving, or, if lost, restoring so precious a Jewel, must neces∣sarily be one of the principal and most acceptable Designs in the Latitude of humane Application; and, as such, worthy the Encouragement and Approbation of every one, who is desirous of advancing the Good of his Coun∣try, without this Consideration, (which, nevertheless, may be an accidental, additional Motive) That himself may, at one time or other probably stand in need of so great and useful a Benefit.</P>
<P>Now of all the numerous Train of Diseases, of all the vast Variety of Distempers, which at any Time affect the human System, there are none more to be dreaded, none <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rder to be by Art remov'd, and, what is worst of all, none more Epidemical, than the Gout, the Rheumatism,

the Stone, the Jaundice, and Asthma's; not to mention the more accidental, tho' frequently fatal Attacts, which Colds, Surfeits, Agues, Fevers, Colics, Pleurisies, Me∣lancholy, Rickets, and a Thousand other Distempers, arising from Crudities, Flatuities, and a Thousand other different Causes, make upon our Constitutions; each of which, if not timely and strongly repell'd, is sufficient to subvert, and at length wholly destroy the Order and Method of the Animal Oeconomy; and thereby procure our certain, hasty, and, probably, unprovided Dissoluti∣on from the Life, which it is our great and main Care and Study to preserve and prolong: which Repulse can no how better, nor more effectually be made, than by the speedy Application of such Remedies as are best cal∣culated to refill, break, absorb, and expel the noxious Particles of the morbific Matter, whose Mixture with the Particles of the Blood, and violent Attraction of one another, causing irregular Circulation, unequal and la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id Motion viscid Grumes, unnatural Rarefactions, rapid Col∣lisions, or violent Impetus therein, or other how altering the Quality, disturbing the free Circulation, or disor∣dering the natural Texture and Moment of that Fluid, necessary for the Support and Preservation of Health and Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e; do by the Means give Birth to the most fatal and accute Destempers, and dispersing themselves and their dire Effects thro' all the Vessels and Channels of the Body, do in Time, if not speedily and vigorously repell'd, impair corrupt, and destroy the Solids also, and lay the Foundation of all those grievous and almost incurable C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nic Diseases, whereof some wretched Part, or other of Man-kind is daily and hourly complaining; among whom not a few prolong their Misery or hasten their End, by a tedious, unprofitable Course of Metho∣dical Experiments, whereby they rather pall and weaken.

<P>Among which Productions, for the Good of Mandkind, and cheap and easy attaining, restoring, and preserving of Helth, there never yet has been any Thing made known to the World of that prodigious and almost incredible Virtue and Efficacy, as Dr. <HI>BATEMAN</HI>'s Pectoral Drops, which are justly to be preferr'd to, and distinguish'd from all others, for thir wonderful, and almost infallable Effects, not only in Colds, Agues, Fevers, Colics, Melancholy, and Rickets; but also in curing those great and impacable Enemies of our Health and Ease, the Gout, Rheumatism, Jaundice, Stone, Gravel, and Asthma's. But before I can enter upon an Expla∣nation of their Use and Manner of operating in all these several Cases, I will previous thereto, lay before you in short, the Nature, Case, Rise, and Progress of those Distempers; whereby you shall yourselves be able to judge of the Efficacy of these DROPS in relieving them: In doing whereof, I shall not abuse your Patience, as is too commonly done, with them probable Conjectuers, incohe∣rent Notions, unnatural Opinions, and fantastical Inventions of the ignorant and unlearned Pretenders to Physick; but I shall deliver you the stanch and undoubted Judgments, Decisions and Opinions of the best and most approv'd Physicians and Philosophers, both ancient and modern, such as Hippocrates, Serapion, Averrois, Galen, Sydenham, Radcliffe, Keil, Quincey, and others of indisputed Au∣thority and Reputation in the Arcana of Nature.

<HEAD>CHAP. I Of the GOUT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS is a Distemper of that inveterate and malignant Nature, as to be a continual Foil and Reproach to the best Physicians of all Ages: No Method of Physic, Diet or Habit, however regular, reasonable and orderly; no Prescriptions, tho' bearing the specious and plausible Sanction of Academic, Graduate, and Collegate Learning, being able to give a Turn to this Distemper, or reach its secret Recesses; for retiring into the Extremit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of the fine Capillary Vessels, where by reason of the unequal Celerity and languid Motion of the Blood in those Parts, it's venemous Particles are suffer'd to attract one another with great Violence. It bids Defiance to all their Art, and will oftner yield to one lucky Nostrum, than all the repeated Assaults of what they call Regular Practise, which is never more ineffectual and at a Loss, than in this Case; and more especially, if that Nostrum be prepared as these DROPS are, for such a Species of Simples as are capable of be∣ing render'd, by such Preparation, fit to pierce the very inmost nervous Cells, increase the Impetus of the Vital and Animal Fluids, and follow the Particles of the morbific Matter thro' all the fine Meanders of the Blood till having disturb'd their Attraction, and broke them by repeated Collisions, one against on other, into the minutest Parts, it forces most of them thro' the Pores of the Body by Perspiration, obtunding, absorbing, and and carrying the rest away with it in its Course, til ar∣riving at the Kidneys, they are secreted there from the Blood, and pass away by Urine. All which Operations These DROPS to a Miracle perform, by Virtue of their Diaphoretic, Absorbent, and Detergent Qualities; ope∣ning at once all the Emunctories of the Body, and forc∣ing off, through them, they very Root an Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s of the Distemper they are to cure; and that this is the only
<PB N="6" REF="039981_0007_1015CA3463991920"/>
effectual, rational Method of treating this obstinate Di∣stemper the Gout, I appeal to that great Searcher of Nature, Dr. Sydenham, who says, Whatsoever is assi∣stant in discharging the foul, vicious Humours, out of the Body, can never fail of answering the Intention of Cure for which it is design'd, whethe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the Gout, Rheumatism, or any other Cronick Distemper. And his Authority, I should think, ought not reasonably to be disputed in the Cure of this Distemper, whom not only a vast Stock of acquir'd Learning, together with a pro∣digious natural Capacity, improv'd by long and great Practice, and Experience upon Others; but also a con∣tinued and unconquerable Gouty Habit in his own Body, confirm'd in this Opinion, That there was no other Method of treating this terrible Distemper; which is also confirm'd by what those two admiral Physicians, Dr. Keile, and Dr. Quincey, have told us concerning the Cause of it; which, say they, is created by the muci∣laginous Glands in the Joints becoming gritty and stiff, by Means of a sharp acid Humour flowing thereon, which coagulating the oily Liquor secreted by them for lubricating the Ends of the Bones at their several Arti∣culations, to render them apt and ready for Motion, makes it, instead of promoting and assisting that Motion, impeed and prevent it, by clogging the Interstices, so that they cannot move at all, at least, not without very great Pain, hard'ning, by Degrees, into white, chalky, gritty Stones, which are forced to be cut, or otherwise taken out by Art, from the Joints of the Hands and Feet of the miserable Patient, as daily Experience ma∣nifests.</P>
<P>Now you are to observe, That the Particles which compose this sharp acid Humour, are surrounded with little pointed Needles, which wound and irritate the Vessels thro' which they move, and the very Globules of the Blood it self, beating and coagulating thereby any Fluid with which they mix; but these being either obtunded and blunted, and the points of them, as it were, sheath'd and wrap'd up in some of the Particles of this Medicene, or else drove violently against one another
<PB N="7" REF="039981_0008_1015CA625B94DA20"/>
with a Force sufficiently to break off those little pointed Spears, and render them capable of flying off by Perspira∣tion by others; or else so disturb'd and separated by this new Auxiliary Force, that they cannot attract one an∣other, but unwillingly disperse themselves in the Blood, and are many of them secreted and carried off by Urine; This I say, must necessarily answer the Intention of Cure; for by this Means they are rendr'd incapable of irritating, loading, or coagulating any of the Fluids; and then, on Course, the Distemper before caus'd by them, must by Degrees abate, and at length absolutely cease. To which Ends and Purposes. These DROPS are so excellently a∣dapted and prepar'd, and are in their Nature so very Ab∣sorbent, Detergent and Diaphoretic, that it is morally impossible they should fail of working a Cure, which can only be perform'd by the joint Operation of those three Qualities, which are scarce to be met with, in any considerable Degree, in any one Medicine in the World, but THIS alone.</P>
<P>But perhaps, some who understand no nore of this Dis∣temper than the Pain and Torture it gives them, will say, That probably in the former Stage of this Distemper, these Drops may be effectual; but, say they, mine is in∣my Stomach, Bowels, &amp;c. and they will not be able to reach it there. But how weak and trivial an Objection this is, will appear from a Reflection upon this Phase of the Gout, which is only caus'd by a Weakness and debili∣ty of Nature, thro' frequent Debauches, hard Drinking, long Courses of useless Physic, &amp;c. whereby the Impetus of the Blood becomes so weak and languid, and its Motion so slow and irregular, as to permit the morbific Particles to attract one another in the Blood Vessels of those Parts, which can only be remedied by such Things as warm and increase the Blood's intestine Motion, so breaking and dis∣turbing the Attraction of the venemous Particles, and sending them back again to the extream Parts, where they are to be treated as before: For which Purpose, nothing in Nature can be better fitted than these Drops, which have such a fine invigorating, Alexiterial Property in them
<PB N="8" REF="039981_0009_1015CA37AFDB9A28"/>
as to render them one of the best Cardiacs in the whole Materia Medica.</P>
<P>THE Dose in the former Phase of the Destemper, is a large Spoonful, in any warm Vehicle, as Moun∣tain Wine, strong Ale: &amp;c. made as hot as you can drink it, repeated three Nights suc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssively, going to Bed, and, by the Blssing of GOD, you need not fear Ease.</P>
<P>But in the latter Phase, where the morbific Matter is not only to be repelled, but the faint and languid State of Nature enliven'd and invigorated, it is necessary that you increace your Dose as the Cause may require, in any warm Vehicle, as before; composing your self after it, and encouraging Sweat by all proper Methods.</P>
<P>After this in order effectually to rout this most terible Enemy it is necessary you continiue to take a small Dose of about 100, or 150 Drops, every Three Nights alter∣nately; taking three Nights, and missing three Nights; till such time as you find the Strength of the Distemper to abate, which it will sensibly do in a small time, and at length quite go off.</P>
<P>Instances of the Cure of this Distemper, by These DROPS, might be given in great Numbers, from Persons of undoubted Credit, and Reputation, on enquiry, would satisfy the Curious of their wonderful Effect in that Intention: but not bring willing to tire the Reader; and these Drops, by their continual Success, so strongly recomending themselves? I shall out of a very great multitude only trouble you with a few, as you will find at the end of this Treatise.</P>

<P>H<HI>Aving in the foregoing Chapter, been so very particular in describing the Origin, Nature, Rise Progress and Cure of the Gout; there will be the less need of enlarg∣ing in this upon a Distemper so near a kin to it as the Rheuma∣tism; even so near, as, in many Constitutions, to be owing to the same Cause, with this only Difference in the Effect, that as the</HI>

<P><HI>This is only to be remedied by Deluents and Evacuating Me∣dicines, as in the Gout; but not by any common Evacuators; many or most of which weaken Nature too much in their Opera∣tions, and being us'd without proper Deluents will evap'rate all the real natural Serum, and leave nothing but a sort of Se∣rous Jelly in the Blood; which thereupon will either immedi∣ately Stagnate, or Effervesce in such Manner, as to cause a violent putrid Fever, and, without almost a Miracle, the cer∣tain Death of the Patient: It is true, they may ease the violent Pains of this Distemper, but if at the same Time they increase</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="039981_0011_1015CA3C7A5DF888"/>
<HI>the Inflamation, and Effervescence of the Blood, the Fever proportionably increases, and the poor deluded Patient dies; as too many do by common Practice: Whereas these DROPS delute and expel what is redundant; whereby the Blood is re∣stored to its natural Crasis, its due Velocity, and Impetus re∣covered, the Pains cease, the Fever abates, perfect Health ensues. Besides which by their Alexiterial, Cardiac Qualities, at the same Time that they thus increase the Impetus and Mo∣ment of the Fluids, to the Discharge of the Morbific Matter in Perspiration; they also warm and comfort the whole nervous System, assist mightily in repairing the Wast of the Animal Spirits, occasioned thereby; which is evident in what has been already said of them concerning the Gout in the Stomach and Bowels, proceeding from a real Weakness and decay of Nature.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In short, no preparation was ever yet sound out so suitable to the very Nature of this Distemper as these DROPS; which will plainly appear from the vast number of Certificates of Cures wrought by them every Week, out of which I have thought fit to trouble you with but few.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Dose and manner of ordering your self, is the same as before directed in the Gout; to be varied according to the Distemper, and strength of the Patients Constitution, from</HI> 80, <HI>to</HI> 150 <HI>or</HI> 200 <HI>Drops, in any convenient Vehecle; which need not be so strong and spirituous as in that Destemper; but must be dra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k as warm as possible going to Bed, and cover∣ing your self up warm, as before.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of The JAUNDICE.</HEAD>
<P>TO give you an exact Theory of this Distemper, would take up more room than this short Treatise will admit of: I shall therefore, as I have done by the other Distempers, in the foregoing Chapters, open it so far to you, as to convince you, that these DROPS are the best Specifick (if I may be indulg'd that Term) in the whole Materia Medica, to break thro' it's Schirrous Obstructions, and finally eradicate it and all its dreadful Symptoms out of the humane Body.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="039981_0012_1015CA68221B9910"/>
This Distemper arises from obstructions in the Glands of the Liver, thereby preventing a due Secretion of the Gall from the Blood, by them in that Viscus, which Bilious Particles circulating therewith, gives a Yellow Tincture to the Mucus or Curpus Reticulare spred un∣der the Cuticula, which from thence appears of that Co∣lour: This is the first and common Phase of this Di∣stemper; but it will sometimes, and more especially in hard Drinkers, arrive to that height, as to Cause a fre∣quent Spitting and Vomiting of Blood, which is general∣ly reckon'd a Mortal Symptom; for it is caused by the Obstructions in the Hepatic Glands becomming schirrous; and so indurated, as with great Difficulty (if at all) to be opened again; which straitens the Motion of the Blood through that Viscus so much, as to cause it to revulse with a great Motion into the Gastrick Arteries, which go off from the Hepatic, insomuch, that breaking through them, it drains into the Stomach, and by that means the Course of that fluid is alter'd the Secretion of the Bile at an End, and the whole System destroy'd: So that this latter Stage of the Distemper is seldom or never to be cured; but may easily be prevented by taking the former Phase in time; powerfully deterging those tartarous abdura∣ting Particles out of the Blood; which can only be by strong Detergents and Diaphoreticks, (which I have al∣ready prov'd to you these DROPS are; and therefore cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail of Curing, if taken in time, and followed up, till by a Continuation they become perfect Altera∣tives:) And if any thing will cure the latter Phase of this Distemper, these DROPS will, having done Won∣ders in it, even when the Patients have been given over by their Physicians, and the Distemper baffled their utmost Skill.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the Stone and Gravel.</HEAD>
<P>THESE are one and the same Distemper, in two several Degrees; the Stone being only concerted Gravel, and the Gravel the Matter whereof the Stone is form'd and in some what is wash'd off it by po∣werful Nepritic and Lytholutics; both of them being in their Degree an aggregate of the tartarous Particles of the Urine, pent up by the Straitness of the Urinary Ducts; which is only to be cur'd by dissolving the Stone, widening and deterging the Passages; and ridding the Blood of those tartarous Particles by Diaphoretics, before the Secretion of Urine is perform'd: All which several Operations these DROPS perform to a Wonder, and have, by their Detergent Diuretick Quality, brought away, from several Persons, STONES of the Size of a small Nut Kernel, when every other Remedy has fail'd to give them Ease; and, by being continued afterwards, cleans'd the Blood of it's tartarous Particles, so as to prevent another Fit for many years.</P>
<P>THE Dose is as in the Gout, in a Cup of White-wine Posset Drink, Old Hock Green Tea, or any other potent Diuretic; made very warm, and sweetned with an Ounce of Syrup of Mash-Mallows, going to Bed immediately on taking them, and they give Ease instant∣ly.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V Of ASTHMAS,</HEAD>
<P>THHE prodigious Variety of Causes from whence this Distemper proceeds, in different Constituti∣ons, gives it so many various Species and Degrees, as to render it one of the most difficult Disorders to be skilfully manag'd of any affecting the human System. But the chief sorts are, the Humid, the Dry, and the Nervous Asthma; of each of which I will separately give a few
<PB N="13" REF="039981_0014_1015CA6B23E0BCF8"/>
Hints concerning their Cause and Systems, and then pro∣ceeding to the Discription of the Eeffects of these Drops in all those Intentions.</P>
<P>But first, it is necessary to premise what an Asthma is in general: That it is a frequent, difficult, and short Respira∣tion, or Breathing, join'd with a hissing Sound, and a Cough; especially in the Night, in cold Weather, and in a prone Posture, or lying down: The former because the Pressure of the Atmosphere is greater in the Night then in the Day, when the Noxious Vapours exhal'd and dispel'd by the Force of the Sun Beams. In the Night, by reason of the Pores of the Body being contracted by the circum∣ambient Cold, our Tpanspiration is lessen'd, and conse∣quently a Gravedo or Weight of perspirable Matter ensues; which being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lung upon the lungs, clogs them, and renders them less apt to perform their Office; and in the last Case, from the Pressure which the contents of the Abdomen, when the Body is in that Posture, make upon the Diaphragm, thereby lessening the Capacity of the Thorax or Breast, so that the Lungs are too much confin'd, and cannot dilate themselves sufficient to receive a due Quantity of Air.</P>
<P>This being premis'd, it will be easily understood, how these several Kinds of Asthmas are produced: The first or Humid, call'd also the Peluretic Asthma, arises from the Redundance of Rheumatic Serum, and viscous Humours in the Blood, which being too thick to pass through the small Fibres of the Lungs stick close to the Sides of those Vessels, and obstruct the Blood in its Circulation; the Parts swell and often ulcerate, with great Pain, feverish Habbits, and Difficulty of breathing: Or else the pitui∣tous Particles are spewed out into the Bronchiae, especially if not impregnated with a due Proportion of Salts, causing a continual irritating Cough: In both which Cases all inciding Pectorals are good, all Diaphoretits, and what∣ever attenuates and lessens the Quantity of Serum; by that means depleting the extended Vessels, and Working a Revulsion of the stagnating Humours: Which nothing can better effect then these DROPS, which evacuate both by Perspiration and Urine, and are certainly, at the
<PB N="14" REF="039981_0015_1015CA412BE4A220"/>
same time, one of the very best Cardiacs in the whole World.</P>
<P>The next Species of this Distemper, is the dry or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣thoric Asthma, caus'd either by too great a Repletion of a cachochymious Blood call'd a Plethora, or else by too great a Rarefaction of that Fluid in it's Vessels; so that the fine Canalls of the Lungs are too far distended; and consequently there is not room enough for the Air to inflate the Vessels, which produces an Inability of Re∣spiration, for want of a due Degree of Expansion in that Viscus: Such Persons are generally crying out for Air; they always seem as if girted hard upon their Chest, and are almost become Victims to a long Scorbutick Ca∣chetic Habit; of which this is the last, and oftentimes, for want of proper Remedies apply'd in time, fatal Symptoms; or in this Case there is no time to use Al∣teratives, which work but slowly in the Mass of Blood; whereas here we want an immediate Assistance; which can only be obtain'd by a Conjunction of Cardiacs and Diaphoretics, both which Qualities are eminently distin∣guishable in these DROPS; Which can therefore never fail the Intention of Cure in this Distemper,</P>
<P>The Third and last Sort of Asthma I mention'd, was the Nervous; which is occasion'd by a Dificiency of the Pec∣torl Muscles, for want of a sufficient Quantity of Spirits to nourish and contract them; and is the dir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Effect of a ner∣vous Atrophy; and to be r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d by high, and vigorous Cardiacs; to rouse and invigorate daca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing Nature, and as it were, re-enkindle the almost extinguish'd Lamp of Life; which nothing can perform more effectually than these DROPS, which have a prodigous Influence in reviving the drooping Spirits, warming and comforting the Nerves, encreasing the Moment of the Blood, and doing every other O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>quisite to call back the almost sleeting Life, by their admirable Cardiac Quality; inso∣much that many have been restor'd to a Miracle, from even Death's Door by them alone, both in this and other Cases.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI Of Colds, Agues, Fevers, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>I Put these Distempers all in one Class because they have a mutual Relation the one to the other, as the Cause has to the Effect, &amp; e contra, and as different Effects produced from the same Cause have to another; for it may generally be allow'd that what we call Colds are the Basis, or Ground work of most of those Epedemic Fevers, which so commonly rage in this Kingdom: For perspiration being diminish'd thro' a Contraction of the pores, caus'd by the perception of external Cold, the Perspirable Matter flies of in a less Quantity than when the Pores are more relax'd; and that part thereof which cannot get out, returns back into the Blood, which it heats and irritates more or less according to the Quan∣tity of Matter retain'd, forcing it to distend it's Vessels, and producing thence frequently a Solutio continui, whence follows the Idea or pain in that part, with a Gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>do or Heaviness of the whole Frame, but especially of the diseas'd part; or else, a Coryza or Defluxion of serous, sharp Humours from the Glands of the Head, thro' the Eyes, Nose, Mouth, &amp;c. From whence, if speedy C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re is not taken, are engender'd Asthma's, Con∣sumptions, Fevers, &amp;c. And a whole Train of Evils which may be easily and certainly prevented, by a timely Use of some proper Evacuator, which shall by it's Diaphoretic Quality, discharge the Blood of it's Load of foreign deleterious Matter; and force off the offending Particles thro' the Pores; which we call Sweating: To which Purpose, there is no one Thing in Nature more effectual than these Drops, which are most power∣ful Diaphoretic, and never fail of Success in the most stubborn Cold whatever. It is an old and indeed most excellent Maxim,
<Q><PB N="16" REF="039981_0017_1015CA445148BA78"/>
<L><HI>"veni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nti occurrite morbo.</HI></L></Q>
Prevent a threatning Disease, for as the English Pro∣verb has it,
<Q><L><HI>A Stitch in Time saves nine.</HI></L></Q>
And so 'tis here, a single Dose seldom or never sails cur∣ing a Cold, whereas if you let that Cold grow into a Fe∣ver, it may be the Work of several to compleat the Cure; and glad you may be to come off so; for nothing corrupts the Blood more than a Cold, by irritating, and inflaming it to the highest Degree; whence proceed Putrifactions, which if not evacuated by proper Remedies, increase the Fervour, and often generate acute, putrid, and malig∣nant Fevers, whose dire Effects daily Examples suffici∣ently demonstrate to every ones Experience. These dele∣terious and malignant Particles are therefore to be evacu∣ated both by augmenting the before diminish'd Perspi∣ration, and the urinary Secretion; for by that Means, a great Quantity of them pass off with the discharg'd Se∣rum, and on Course lessen the Fermentation in the Blood: But unless at the same Time, you use proper Cardiacs to refresh Nature, she will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nk under this vast Burthen, for, the Hurry and Heat the Blood is in, necessarily con∣sumes a vast Quantity of the animal Spirits, which de∣caying faster than Nature can possibly return them, she must certainly fall beneath the prodigious Wast, unless reliev'd by some auxiliary Force. Now, as I have of∣ten mentioned before, these Drops are both Diaphoretic, Diuretic, and Cardiac; containing in themselves all those three great Qalities, absolutely necessary in a com∣pleat Febrifuge, and themselves by the Blessing of God effect a perfect Cure with out the Help of any other Medi∣cine.</P>
<P><HI>As for Agues, they are only the Intermissions of Fevers, the cold Fit being only an accidental, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d not an essential Property thereunto; so that as they are properly a Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>s, of a Fever, they are to be treated after the same Manner, and the Method and Intention of Cure, is the very same; and if so, then consequent∣ly the same Remedy that prevails against one, cannot fail in the other.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="039981_0018_1015CA6F613217B8"/>
<HI>And here, I cannot omit mentioning one peculiar Property in these Drops, sufficient of it self to recommend them effectu∣ally to all the reasonable part of Mankind, who are not wedded to methodical Error; and that is, their powerful Energy in clearing the Blood from the Dregs of that fashionable (but in many Cases pernicious) Drug,</HI> the Bark of Peru, <HI>commonly called,</HI> The Jesuites Bark. <HI>This is the Publik Asylum of Mankind, the Panacea of the World, the sovereign and uni∣versal Orvietem against all the Diseases of Pandora's Box, and what not, in the Opinion of those valetudenarian Wretches, who dare not eat a Meals Meat, open a Chamber Window, or so much as go to Stool, without the Leave of their Physician; whose constant Prescription is still the Bark, in some Form or other: If Madam has got a fit of the Vapours, the Bark will chear her Spirits: If she has taken too plentiful a Dose of Ratifea, the Bark will make her as sober as a Nun: If she is Lovesick, the Bark is to moderate her Desires: And if she is in the raging Fever of Jealousy, the Bark is to make her believe that her Husban<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is as Constant as a Turtle: In short, whenever the Privy-Counceller of Health is at a Loss what to do for his Guinea, he perswades his Patient she has an inter∣mitting Fever, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Bark is the Word to save the Expence of further thinking. Now by this you may Judge, whether this gigantik Drug, which is whimsically apply'd to so many chim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣rical Evils, is of any valuable Use, any substantial Benefit to Mankind in real Disorders, and Maladies, arising from a viti∣ated State of the Fluids. We seldom play with serious Matters, nor make Childen Ratles of Diamonds. One learned Practi∣tioner says, the Bark is a violent Stiptic, and Astringent; ano∣ther, it is solutive, and will of it self, without proper Altera∣tives, pass immediately downwards. One says it consists of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ixt Salt, another of a voaltile, and a third that it is a Compo∣site of both. One that it gives the Spur to the intestine Motion of the Blood; another that is locks up every Thing in the Blood. Some, and those of Note too, assert, that if given in large Quan∣tities, it will by its attenuating Property create an Anasarca, or Dropsy; others that it is it self sufficient to cure the Dropsy. One forbids the Use of it in Rheumatic Fevers, for fear its at∣tenuating Virtue rarefy the Mass of Blood, and thereby enlarge the Dimensions of its Vessels, so far, as to occasion an Anurisma
<PB N="18" REF="039981_0019_1015CA494FD1F510"/>
or Rupture, or at least greatly increase the Idea of P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in, of which Opinion are no less Men than the famous Morton and Sy∣denham; whereas another late Practitioner, no Ways i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>feriour to either, by all means indciates the Bark in this Case, grounding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s Notion upon Reason, and to use his own Words, contemning and changing the common and trite but deceitful Method of Prac∣tice by Observation.</HI></P>
<P>Now if this be the Case, that these great and learned Men cannot agree among themselves, neither as to the Nature, nor Effect of this magical Drug; is it not great∣ly to be fear'd, and that with very good Reason, that if one is mistaken, they may all of them be so; the Conse∣quence whereof will be, that this famous Panacea, like the Jay in the Fable, stript of all its borrow'd Pomp, will appear of no other Use, but to fill up the Variety of Nature's Works, receiving a Value only from Opinion, grounded on the Weakness of the one Part of the World, and the Wileyness of the other.</P>
<P>But if there be any Virtue in the Drug, the Tast it self seems to point it out to be Stiptic, and Astringent, which is also generally allow'd by all who have any Skill in it; while for Fashion sake they admit of other Qua∣lities, as if it were by prescriptive Right; and for In∣terest invent new ones to Authorize its Administration in some Present Necessity: Now, if once it is allow'd, the Bark is Styptic and Astringent, it points out directly to the Manner of its Operation and Effect; in seemingly giving a turn to some certain periodical Exacerbations; for which it is more generally administred, as intermit∣ting Fevers, Hemicraneas, Haemoptoes, Epilipsi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and Hysterics; which, says a great and learned Author, are to be reliev'd the Cortex only; but what Way is this Relief to be had? why, says the same Author, the Cor∣tex lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ks up the febrile Ferment in the Blood; and, says he, in another Place, if Cathartics be given soon after it, they make the Type of the Fever return in its old Shape, for when the Bark is carried off, what looks up the Distemper? From whence I conclude, that this mighty Medicine, like a cunning Mountebank, deludes us with plausible Appearances, and instead of really
<PB N="19" REF="039981_0020_1015CA7501090B90"/>
working a Cure, only postpones the Exacerbation, it may be for a Week or a Fortnight, by locking the Cause up in the Veins, which upon any accidental Cold, little Irregu∣larity, or Imprudent Management, breaks out again with double Violence; the Consequence whereof is not seldom attended with the Death of the Patient; as common Ex∣perience daily confirms; unless, with Morton, you con∣tinue dosing your Patient with it every ten Days, till the next S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>z<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gy; or else, with another great Physician, give him as much after the Distemper is taken off as was sufficient to take it off in order to prevent a Return sup∣posing that,
<Q><L><HI>'qui facta liberant, si ante fiant, prohibent.</HI></L></Q>
And pray what must the Consequence of this be? why the Mass of Blood is impregnated with so prodigious a Quan∣tity of Styptic Particles, that the Price you pay for your imaginary Cure is a valetudenary State as long as you live; becoming entail'd upon your Physician, as much as his Patrimony, since few that have been weak enough to be perswaded into this Habit, have the Reso∣lution to get rid of the Poyson afterwards, unless by the same Hand that gave it them: Whereas would they be wise at last, and get rid of their troublesome, dangerous Inmate as soon as they can, by deterging and cleansing their Blood, they might in Time, by the Blessing of Pro∣vidence restore that Fluid to its natural Crasis and by Degrees overcome the malevolent Effects of their fashion∣able Physic; for which Purpose, as well as the other In∣tentions in this Treatise, these DROPS have been greatly commended by several who have happily experienced their Effects; and those among the learned World, of both our Universities, and by them recommended in this very Intention to the World, for the general good of Mankind.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Of the other VIRTUES of these DROPS.</HEAD>
<P>HItherto I have laid before you the particular Effects of these DROPS, in particular Cases; and that not by a dogmatical Assertion of their Virtues, or any canting Declaration of their specific Influence, and occult Qualities, Terms only serving to cover Ignorance and Imposition: But I carry'd you thro' all the Mean∣ders of Nature, in her several Turns and Winding, in her several various Phases, and Symptomical Apperan∣ces upon every Case affecting the humane System; which this noble and efficacious Medicine is capable of search∣ing: And from thence drawn such easy and rational Conclusions upon their Operations, as to make it visible to every Capacity that has but the least Notion of the Connexion between Causes and their Effects, &amp;c. that they cannot fail in the several Intentions wherein they are advis'd; a Task which not any Self-Interest, nor any sinister View of serving my own Turn, has in the least induc'd me to; but purely the universal Good of Mankind, and Charity to my Fellow Creatures; as is plainly evident from the establish'd Reputation these Drops have already gain'd in the World, the surprizing Cures they have wrought, and the vast Quantities of them sold throughout the whole Kingdom: So that, there was no Occasion upon any of these Accounts to have been either at the Trouble or Charge of this Treatise, but purely to convince Gainsayer of their admirable Nature and Efficacy in the Intentions aforemention'd to inform the ignorant of the Nature of their several Cases, and where they may meet with a speedy, certain, and safe Cure for their respective Maladies. And lastly, to assure the whole World that these Drops are no Quack Prepa∣ration or Drugs injudicicously mixt and jumbled toge∣ther, without either Art or Design, but such as are grounded on both, and carefully suited to answer the
<PB N="21" REF="039981_0022_1015CA76B7DE3F00"/>
several Intentions to which they are design'd, which any one capable of forming a right Judgment of Things, may on the reading this Treatise, be sufficiently convin∣c'd of: Wherefore I shall enlarge no further on this Subject, only to assure you, that besides the several foregoing Intentions, these Drops are also wonderful in their stopping Diarrhea's and Fluxes of all Kinds Vomitings, Hamoptos, and other dangerous unnatural Discharges which weaken and destroy the entire human System; They give immediate Ease in Colics of what Kind soever, whether Stone, Wind, Bilious or Hysteric; raise the languishing Frame of Nature in Consumptions and Marasmi; if taken before the Lungs are entirely corrupted, raise and chear the Spirits in melancholly Despondency, Hypocondriac and Hysteric Vapours; give a new life to all Paralytic Evils; restoring Sense and Motion to the almost perish'd Limbs; They bring out the Small Pox, Measles and Rashes, to a Wonder; cure the Rickets in Children, ease After-Pains, prevent Mis∣carriages to a Miracle, and in short the greatest Restorer and Strengthner of Nature in the whole World.</P>
