<HEAD>SERMON.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>I SAMUEL, XXV.I.</BIBL>
<P>And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah.—</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WE have here but a short account of <HI>Samuel</HI>'s death and burial. Though he was a great man, and one that was admirably well qualified for public service, yet he spent the latter end of his days in retirement and obscu∣rity: not because he was superannuated, for he knew how to preside in a college of the pro∣phets; but because Israel had rejected him, for which God chastised them, and because his desire was to be quiet, and to enjoy himself and his God in acts of devotion in his advanced years.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> All Israel lamented him: and they had reason; for they all found their loss in losing him. His personal merit commanded this honour to be done unto him at his death —his former services to the public, while he
<PB N="4" REF="038551_0004_101257F0C8BB1798"/>
presided over Israel, made a respect to his name and memory a just debt: it had been very ungrateful to have withheld it. <HI>Samuel</HI> was a constant intercessor for Israel, he prayed daily for them: if he is gone they have lost the best friend they have. The loss is the more grievous, at this juncture, because Saul was so outrageous: never was Samuel more wanted than now; yet now he is removed. We will hope the Israelites lamented Samuel's death the more bitterly, because they remembered against themselves their own sin and folly in rejecting him. Those have hard hearts, who can bury their own ministers, and GOD's faith∣ful servants, with dry eyes; that are not sensible of the loss of those who, under GOD, have been their deliverers.</P>
<P>They buried him:—not in the school of the prophets; but in his own house, perhaps in his garden pertaining to it at Ramah, where he was born. Thus ended the life of that great man; but his GOD would not left his servant's name he buried with his mortal part: as saith the Psalmist—
<Q><L>The sweet remembrance of the just,</L>
<L>Shall flourish when he sleeps in dust.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="038551_0005_101257F38F8311C0"/>Brethren, I have chosen the words of our Text, on the present mournful occasion, because there is such a similarity between the beloved <HI>Samuel,</HI> and the beloved <HI>Washington;</HI> both the servants of God—both the gifts of God to his beloved, though sinful, people—both, under God, the saviours of their country—both the envy of kings, and scourge of tyrants—both beloved of the people in general in their lives, and both universally lamented in their deaths. And O! with what propriety did Israel la∣ment the death of their beloved <HI>Samuel:</HI> he was the father of their Country, their friend, and the kind gift of their covenant God. And how much reason have the people of America to lament the death of their beloved <HI>Washington,</HI> who was equally the gift of God to them, as <HI>Samuel</HI> to the Israelites. But as I have said there was a similarity, between these two great characters, it shall be my business, on this mournful occasion, to set forth that similarity.</P>
<P>And <HI>First, Samuel,</HI> in his early age, was found active in the cause of God, which no doubt, was the salvation of Israel. In like manner, General <HI>Washington,</HI> early in life, in the western
<PB N="6" REF="038551_0006_101257F6083FE870"/>
country, applied himself to the military pro∣fession in the defence of his country, which no doubt was the cause of GOD, and terminated in the salvation of GOD's American Israel.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> It is remarkable that we have no more of <HI>Samuel</HI> from the time the Lord called him, while he dwelt in the house of Eli, until his country was besieged by the Philistines, which was a space of 20 years—then, in the time of danger, this great man steps forth, and gathered together all Israel to Mizpeh: there he prayed for them, and with them—there he counselled and advised them, and by his prudent advise, the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the enemy, and smote them, (saith the text) until they came unto Bethcar, 1 Sam. vii.11. So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the coasts of Israel; and the hand of the LORD, was against the Philistines all the days of <HI>Samuel,</HI> verse 13.</P>
<P><HI>Simile.</HI> In like manner, nothing material was heard of the great and good <HI>Washington</HI> after the Western Expedition, until his American Israel was in the utmost danger of being deprived of their precious Liberty. Then our illustrious Hero steps forth, in the day
<PB N="7" REF="038551_0007_101257F7A0F48DD0"/>
of danger, in defence of our liberties and our lives, of our wives and of our children, and all that was dear to us. And after the example of his adorable Lord and master, the LORD JESUS CHRIST, he counted not his life dear unto himself; but ventured both life and fortune for the sake of his country. It was not filthy lucre that moved the great, the memo∣rable <HI>Washington;</HI> for he received no pay. No, sirs, it was <HI>Dei Gratia,</HI> or the grace of GOD, in his noble heart, that moved him in all his heroic actions; and the power of Almighty GOD, that gave his servant <HI>Washing∣ton</HI> success against the most powerful and well disciplined army upon earth.</P>
<P>How blind must that man be, that sees not the hand of Almighty GOD with the Sword of <HI>Washington.</HI> It might be said with propriety, as of old it was of Gideon, "The sword of the Lord and of Gideon;" so we may say, The sword of the Lord and of <HI>Washington,</HI> has made us the most free and happy people on earth: and though we lament this day the death of our dear <HI>Washington;</HI> yet we have reason, great reason, to rejoice, that the GOD of General <HI>Washington</HI> lives—ever lives, and is our GOD
<PB N="8" REF="038551_0008_101257FA1967A598"/>
—and who, I trust, will protect us and bless us forever. Let us not, therefore, my brother officers and fellow citizens, "sorrow as men without hope" for them that sleep in him. For them that sleep in CHRIST will GOD bring with him. It is right our beloved <HI>Washington</HI> should "rest from his labors, and his works follow him." Our eternal Father has called home the Father of our country —not to rest at Mount <HI>Vernon,</HI> where his rest has been frequently interrupted by the enemies of his beloved country; but far above the everlasting hills—even, we trust and believe, to the eternal heavens, where JESUS, the Almighty JESUS, smiles upon his servant <HI>Washington,</HI> and fully rewards him for his faithful services while an inhabitant of this lower world. But to return:</P>
<P><HI>Samuel</HI> like, he had the happiness to see the American Israel, masters of the field—under his auspices, a happy and honorable peace—and our Independence acknowledged by his Bri∣tannic majesty. And, as in the administration of <HI>Samuel,</HI> to wit, through his whole life, the Philistines no more troubled Israel; so, in like manner, through the whole administration of
<PB N="9" REF="038551_0009_101257FDB26108A0"/>
the illustrious <HI>Washington,</HI> no enemy in an hostile manner, durst invade our borders.</P>
<P>After the whole work was finished, our dear General retired to his seat at <HI>Mount-Vernon,</HI> to enjoy the pleasures of domestic life: but this rest was short. Behold the great <HI>Washington</HI> was born for nobler ends—to rule GOD's American Israel: and as <HI>Samuel</HI> became the chief magistrate in all Israel, so our beloved <HI>Washington,</HI> by the appointment of Heaven, and the voice of all the People, became the chief magistrate, or governor, of the United States▪ he was twice unanimously chosen to be the chief magistrate of a free people. In this high office, his conduct and prudence was such as commanded the respect of all the people, from the highest to the lowest. Even all the powers of Europe admired and revered our amiable Leader. Yet, nevertheless, though his charac∣ter was so spotless, in every point of view, as a Man—as a Christian—as a Statesman—as a brave Soldier—as a wise and valiant General —as a tender Parent to his people, and a faith∣ful and disinterested friend to his country; yet, as it was with the infatuated Israelites, in rejecting and finding fault with the administra∣tion
<PB N="10" REF="038551_0010_10125800263BC7E0"/>
of <HI>Samuel;</HI> so some of the people in the United States found fault with our deceased General, and with our happy federal and most glorious constitution, in the framing of which the deceased was a principal agent, and of which I may say, it is the most free and happy constitution in the world; for which we ought ever to adore the disposer of all events. But, brethren, let us reflect, that when we sin against our rulers, we sin against God himself. See <HI>Samuel</HI> viii.7. thus saith the Lord to <HI>Samuel,</HI>
<Q>They have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.</Q>
But why brethren, should we wonder, that there are men found among us that slight General <HI>Washington,</HI> when it is too great a truth, that there are many among us who slight and treat with the greatest disrespect the adorable and ever blessed JESUS, and the mild government of our gracious and sin-par∣doning GOD. O! foolish people and unwise, thus to treat the Lord of glory. Foolish indeed must that mortal be, who dare attempt to rush upon the fierce bosses of GOD Almighty's buckler. Can any of us bear everlasting burnings, or dwell with devouring fire? Oh!
<PB N="11" REF="038551_0011_10125801C4504750"/>
no! no! Then, for your soul's sake lay down the arms of your rebellion, while there is yet a possibility of obtaining mercy.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly, Samuel</HI> died, and all Israel lamen∣ted him; and they buried him on his own place —and says the <HI>True American,</HI> "O painful reflexion! on Saturday, the 14 Instant <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">December 1799.</NOTE>, died suddenly, at his seat in Virginia, General GEORGE WASHINGTON, Commander in Chief of the Armies of the United States of America—mature in years—covered with glory, and rich in the affections of the American people. But our loss, we have no doubt, is our illustrious Leader's gain:—and while we, with <HI>Elisha,</HI> lament and cry, 'my Father, my Father, the chariots of Israel and the horse∣men thereof,' our dear <HI>Washington</HI> has dismissed his fiery chariot, being safely arrived far above the everlasting hills—where sin and sorrow never come."</P>
<P>Indeed, my brethren, the exit of this great man, the wonder of the age, may truly be said to be a fiery trial, as his quivering lips pro∣nounced in his last agonies. As his respiration became difficult, he said calmly, "I die hard
<PB N="12" REF="038551_0012_1012580438778160"/>
Doctor"—but notwithstanding the excruciating agonies of his violent disease, he tranquilly asked several questions during the evening. About 15 minutes before he died, he said, "Doctor what is the Clock? How long am I to continue in this situation?" The Doctor an∣swered, "Not long sir"—he rejoined, with the firmest countenance imaginable, "I have no fear, Doctor, to die." O! happy <HI>Washing∣ton!</HI> O! man greatly beloved—Israel's King has well described thy case, Psalm xxxvii.37. "Mark the perfect man, and behold the up∣right: for the end of that man is peace."</P>
<P>Such was the peaceful departure of the great and good <HI>Washington.</HI> As he lived, so he died: tranquil in the field of battle; and beyond all human conception tranquil on a dying bed: we may truly say the end of such a man was peace, as Mr. Harvey has beautifully described. "The sufferer, all patient and adoring, submits to the divine will; and, by submission, becomes superior to his afflictions. He is sensibly touched with the disconsolate state of his attendants; and pierced with an anxious concern for his wife, the dear partner of his bosom, who will soon become a discon∣solate widow. Yet, though cast down, not in
<PB N="13" REF="038551_0013_10125807D678AB98"/>
despair. He is greatly refreshed by his trust in the everlasting Covenant, and his hope of approaching glory. Religion gives a dignity to distress.—The soul just going to abandon the tottering clay, collects all her force, and exerts her last efforts." The good, the great <HI>Washington</HI> raises his dying hand—closes his own eyes and mouth—and, with the greatest composure, resigns his departing spirit into the hands of its divine Former, the ever adorable IMMANUEL, who is GOD over all, and blessed forever, Amen.</P>
<P>Thus died the memorable <HI>Washington,</HI> in a very particular crisis. As it was with <HI>Samuel,</HI> as we said before, at a time when Saul was so outrageous; so it was a peculiar time of danger to the United States, when our General died: a time, when some of the European powers threatened us with war and devastation. Never was there a time, when General <HI>Washington</HI> was more wanted than now—yet now he is removed—even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.</P>
<P>My brethren, when men of common charac∣ter are swept from the theatre of life, they die without the tribute of public notice, as they
<PB N="14" REF="038551_0014_1012580A4FB047F8"/>
had lived without a claim to public esteem. But when, in compliance with Heaven's high mandate, the Hero of the age lies numbered with the dead—when the reverend sage—the august statesman—the father of his country has resigned his breath: when the beloved of an empire—the envy and admiration of distant nations, and the brightest ornament of human nature, in this late age of the world— when <HI>Washington,</HI> the servant of divine IM∣MANUEL, is no more—let a sense of the general loss be testified, by the badges of a general mourning;
<Q><L>For as the stars that guild the vault of night,</L>
<L>Unnumber'd, pour effulgence on the sight;</L>
<L>So Chiefs, and Senators in crouds abound:</L>
<L>But rare as comets <HI>Washingtons</HI> are found.</L></Q></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> they buried <HI>Samuel</HI> in his own house. So the mortal part of this great man was buried on his own place at Mount-Vernon, his once beloved retreat; where now remains the dear body of our beloved Chief, waiting till the last trump shall sound to the general judg∣ment, when the ever adorable and ineffable Redeemer shall come to be glorified in his
<PB N="15" REF="038551_0015_1012580BE93B05F0"/>
saints, and admired by all that believe. Tis then we may expect to see the now emaciated body of the dear deceased reunited to its sister spirit, his noble and redeemed soul; and both soul and body fitted, by the Creator of all worlds, for the full enjoyment of Israel's God, forever and ever. Until that happy day, let us take comfort in contemplating the happy flight of our General's immortal part through the etherial blue to realms of bliss: as saith the poet—
<Q><L>"From Vernon's Mount behold the Hero rise!</L>
<L>Resplendent forms attend him through the skies;</L>
<L>The shades of war worn veteran's round him throng,</L>
<L>And lead enwrapt their honour'd Chief along.</L>
<L>A laurel wreath th' immortal <HI>Warren</HI> bears—</L>
<L>An arch triumphant <HI>Mercer's</HI> hand prepares—</L>
<L>Montgomery's god-like form directs the way,</L>
<L>And <HI>Green</HI> unfolds the gates of endless day.</L>
<L>While angels, trumpet tongued, proclaim thro' air,</L>
<L>Due honours for the first of men prepare."</L></Q></P>
<P>Thus ended the life of this great man: and as it is recorded of <HI>Samuel,</HI> that all the Israelites lamented him—so let it be recorded of General <HI>Washington,</HI> that every true American—that every son of Liberty—that every friend to the
<PB N="16" REF="038551_0016_1012580E605079E8"/>
best and mildest government in the world la∣mented him. And how similar is the lamentation for the great <HI>Washington</HI> to the lamentation made for the great <HI>Samuel.</HI> "And all the Israelites gathered together, and lamented him." And is it not so through the United States for the dear deceased? Do not the rulers and people every where gather together to make lamentation, and show due honours to the deceased parent of their country? See the illustrious and excellent <HI>Adams,</HI> with the honourable Congress of the United States, deeply mourning and lamenting America's faithful friend, and showing every mark of respect and pure affection to his memory. Take a view of his excellency <HI>Richard Howell,</HI> our worthy Governor and Commander in Chief of the Armies of New-Jersey, with his aids, with mournful steps following the funeral process in Philadelphia. See the patriots in every department, wearing the badge of mourning; showing by this outward sign, the inward and sincere sorrow of their souls, for so great a loss as they feel in being deprived of their Commander in Chief. Take a view of the ministers of JESUS CHRIST, of all
<PB N="17" REF="038551_0017_101258120C76DB60"/>
denominations, paying due respect to the memory of their patron, the excellent <HI>Washing∣ton,</HI> the gift of their covenant GOD, who was as a nursing father to the church of IMMANUEL while he continued among them. See the churches dedicated to the sacred worship of Jehovah, all hung in deep mourning, all bespeaking unfeigned sorrow for the much loved <HI>Washington,</HI> the servant of the living GOD, of his church, and of his people.</P>
<P>Such honour has our heavenly Father confer∣red upon his faithful servant's last remains: for surely, brethren, it is the searcher of hearts alone, that is able to melt the hearts of an whole empire. O! Blessed GOD! thou art divinely good, beyond all we poor mortals can conceive of thee, to them that serve thee in this lower world. Did any of the sons of men ever serve our God, and did not in this present world receive ten thousand fold, and in the world to come, life everlasting? As saith the poet:
<Q><LG>
<L>"Far from these narrow scenes of night,</L>
<L>Unbounded glories rise,</L>
<L>And realms of infinite delight,</L>
<L>Unknown to mortal eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="18" REF="038551_0018_101229E6C2E24FD0"/>
<L>There death nor sickness never come,</L>
<L>And grief no more complains:</L>
<L>Health triumphs in immortal bloom,</L>
<L>And endless pleasure reigns.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No cloud these blissful regions know,</L>
<L>For-ever bright and fair;</L>
<L>For sin, the source of mortal woe,</L>
<L>Can never enter there.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There no alternate night is known,</L>
<L>Nor sun's faint sickly ray;</L>
<L>But glory, from the sacred throne,</L>
<L>Spreads everlasting day.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O! may the heavenly prospect fire</L>
<L>Our hearts with ardent love;</L>
<L>Till wings of faith and strong desire</L>
<L>Bear every thought above.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Prepare us, Lord, by grace divine,</L>
<L>For thy bright courts on high;</L>
<L>Then bid our spirits rise and join</L>
<L>Our General in the sky."</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>Those happy mansions, my brethren, we believe, are the happy residence of our dear departed Chief; whose liberated spirit, we trust, at this moment, enjoys all that blessedness that comes to man through the merits of a Saviour's invaluable blood.</P>

<HEAD>ADDRESS TO THE OFFICERS.</HEAD>
<P>AND now my brother officers, and fellow soldiers, an Address to you must close the mournful scene.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> I lament with you the loss, the great loss of the virtuous <HI>Washington,</HI> our beloved General: but, brethren, the Lord has done it. Let us not murmur at the awful stroke; but rather let the removal of our beloved and affectionate Parent, our valiant and illustrious Leader, stimulate us to seek the favour and friendship of our eternal Father, who is ALONE able to save our country—our persons—our wives—our children, and our immortal souls with an everlasting salvation; and to place us where, we trust, our dear General lives, in immortal glory. Let us strive to imitate the example of that great man, and follow him as he followed CHRIST. Let us use all our power to promote the interest of our present most excellent government. Let us be found
<PB N="21" REF="038551_0021_1012581BFAB436A8"/>
in due subordination to our superior officers, as the ministers of GOD, and let us always remember that awful sentence, "He that resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of GOD." But the rather, brethren, let us give diligence to be found obedient to those whom GOD Almighty hath placed in authority over us. And, above all, my brethren, let us use fervent prayer, through the merits of divine Emanuel, for the revival of decayed religion among us—that our land may prosper, and our Independence maintain under the auspices of the King eternal, immortal, and only wise GOD, JESUS CHRIST; to whom be glory, honour and power, forever and ever, Amen.</P>
