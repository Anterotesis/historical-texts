<HEAD>AN ORATION.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY COUNTRYMEN AND FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SOLEMN! awfully solemn is the occasion, which this day assembles us. We come not as heretofore, to com∣memorate the birth of a nation, or to celebrate the victories of our country:—we come not to proclaim the virtuous deeds of the living patriot, or the warlike achievements of the existing hero: we come not to rejoice; we come to mourn! to mourn departed worth, and to pay a tribute of gratitude to unparalleled merit; merit, once on earth, but now removed.</P>
<P>How gladly, my countrymen, would I resign the task assigned me, into abler hands; but who is equal to such a task! who can justly recount the praises of the
<PB N="4" REF="037466_0003_100D2F5AAB8F94B0"/>
hero, the statesman, and the Christian, whose loss we lament▪—The faithful page of history will make the attempt, and it will fail. The orator and the poet will unite their efforts, and they will im∣mortalize not half his worth. In the hearts, in the grateful hearts of his be∣loved countrymen, it is alone truly re∣corded; and who can express the feel∣ings of those hearts, when the sad tid∣ings are announced that, WASHING∣TON IS NO MORE!</P>
<P>IT has been the custom of most nations to celebrate the actions, and to resound the praises of their renowned heroes and statesmen. They began it, impelled by affection and sorrow; and they continu∣ed it from motives of duty and interest. But never, in any country, did all these so evidently unite, to call upon a people to deplore the loss, and to proclaim the virtues of an illustrious character, as on this mournful occasion. If ever affec∣tion and sorrow were sincere, such Ame∣ricans, must be your affection and your sorrow for the departed FATHER of your country. If ever duty prompted to a grateful remembrance of past and signal
<PB N="5" REF="037466_0004_100D2F7F5197D478"/>
services, or interest recommended for the example of survivors to perpetuate the memory of great and virtuous actions, this sorrowful moment affords the most striking instance.</P>
<P>I WILL not, my countrymen, attempt a formal eulogy on this great and good man, beloved by his own country, and admired by all. For besides, that his cha∣racter is above all praise, should I at∣tempt it, the abilities of my head (as a writer expresses it) would too little con∣spire with the feelings of my heart. It will be sufficient for our present purpose, in order to shew the greatness of our loss, to take a short and summary view of our hero's life, so nobly, so patriot∣ically spent for the public good.</P>
<P>AT a period, which others devote to mirth and dissipation, in his very youth, he was called by his native colony to perilous and interesting services: and such were the early talents and heroism which he displayed, that all men foretold his future greatness if his life was pro∣longed; and such were the extraordinary interpositions of Divine Providence in
<PB N="6" REF="037466_0005_100D2F81622560F8"/>
his favor on several occasions, that de∣vout men were inspired to predict, that he was preserved for the future glory and defence of his country. He contin∣ued to be honored by Virginia with im∣portant appointments, civil and military. He continued to do much good; in war a hero, in peace a statesman and a far∣mer. A statesman, studying the good of his country, and with his brother pat∣riots, adopting measures to promote it. A farmer, cultivating his lands, culti∣vating his mind, and cultivating every social and domestic virtue. Heaven was preparing him for more important scenes—and thy blood stained soil, O Lexing∣ton! opened the glorious drama. The contest between the colonies of A∣merica and their mother country had now drawn to a crisis; and the hostile fleets, and hostile armies of ill-advised Britain, had compelled the former to as∣sert their rights, and to repel force by force. But who shall lead the troops of freedom! By impulse more than human, the American people cast their eyes up∣on the Cincinnatus of Mount-Vernon, and he is elected the commander in chief of their armies.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="037466_0006_100D2F8426424BD8"/>
His country calls. He hesitates not to resign the sweet delights of domestic life, but with a modest diffidence in his talents, and an humble, but firm reliance on the GOD of armies, he at once obeys her call. To detail the various events of the bloody conflict, all of which, whe∣ther prosperous or adverse, evinced the greatness of his soul and the wramth of his patriotism, cannot now be expected; the historian will record them, and the present and future ages will read and wonder. With an undisciplined army, almost without arms or ammunition; his country without military resources; a∣gainst an enemy, brave, determined, and enured to war; and against a nation in the zenith of her power, he nobly took the field. Under his auspices, order sprang out of disorder; detachments of strangers were formed into a band of brothers, and the sons of freedom spread their embattled ranks around him, as the rock of our strength, and under God, our sure defence.</P>
<P>DURING the eventful contest, his pat∣riotic care extended to every part of the Union. Did danger assail the north, there
<PB N="8" REF="037466_0007_100D2F86111C0140"/>
was his Gates, and there his gallant Lin∣coln; did hostile bands invade the south, there was his faithful Greene; and near their Chieftain's camp, there was the sword of the LORD, and of WASHINGTON. There he protected us by day, and watched over us by night; there he cheerfully offered his precious life to the fate of war—and there he caused the enemies of our freedom to feel
<Q><L>"The keen rough searchings of a patriot's steel."</L></Q></P>
<P>Throughout the bloody conflict, his coun∣try's good was the pole-star of all his conduct. The voice of praise could not betray him into rashness, nor could the malignant tongue of slander warp him from his duty. With the same stea∣dy mind he advanced; with the same steady mind he retired;—with the same firm soul he fought the foe; with the same firm soul he declined the combat. When victory held out to him her bleed∣ing hand, he clasped it with serenity, thanking his God. With calm composure he bore every adversity, resigned to the will of Heaven. Possessing the full confidence of his country, the idol of his army, and of all the militia, he was ne∣ver
<PB N="9" REF="037466_0008_100D456677013128"/>
elated. The admiration of the age for military skill and heroic atchieve∣ments, he never boasted. Though by his arduous struggle in the cause of free∣dom, he had stamped an inestimable va∣lue upon a soldier's name, the name of patriot was his great delight.</P>
<P>VARIOUS were the events of the im∣portant conflict; but Heaven at length crowned his military labors with success. With all the joy which patriotism could inspire, he saw the independence of his country established, and her peace re∣stored. The joy of ambition never en∣tered his soul. Having received from the United States in Congress assembled, the most pathetic acknowledgments for his long and faithful services; having paid due honors to his comrades in war, and leaving his country a legacy too val∣uable to be forgotten, he nobly retired. The hero of America became the FAR∣MER of Mount-Vernon. Methinks I see the venerable patriot on his way; every where met, every where followed, every where accompanied and surrounded by the affectionate wishes of a grateful peo∣ple.
<PB N="10" REF="037466_0009_100D4568095CBA80"/>
Happy man! glorious retinue! Haughty despots, attend! bow before him, and learn how little you are. Ambition! for a moment stop thy pursuits, and if thou canst, learn what GREATNESS is.</P>
<P>BUT the important work which he had begun, the political happiness of his country, was not yet completed. The con∣federation of the States, formed amidst the noise of war and the din of arms, proved unequal to the purposes for which it was designed. The band of union was incomplete, and the strength of the nation could not be called into exertion. Rebellion began to rear its head. Private and public credit were nearly destroyed; and America, though strong in men and full of resources, presented to the world the picture of a feeble and bankrupt peo∣ple. His country called again; he again obeyed, and joined a band of worthies in forming a constitution for these Uni∣ted States, founded on the purest princi∣ples of political freedom, and calculated to make his country great and happy.</P>
<P>To carry into effect this constitution, then became the all important work, on
<PB N="11" REF="037466_0010_100D456AA599F230"/>
which depended the happiness or misery of our country. Difficulties arising from various causes, presented themselves to view. Discordant sentiments, ambitious designs, and the intrigues of the enemies of our independence, were all to be en∣countered. WASHINGTON lives! WASH∣INGTON lives! is again resounded from north to south, from east to west and by the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> voice of his grateful country, he is elected chief magistrate of this rising empire.</P>
<P>LOADED with honors, and on the pin∣nacle of human glory; surrounded with friends, and in full possession of all the blessings which affluence can bestow, and of every social and domestic enjoyment, he again resolves to engage in the toils, the dangers, and the anxieties of public life. Here let the historian pause, and search for language to bestow due praise. It is the brightest plume in all his reputation. There was no still voice to whisper in his ear, HERO, THOU HAST ENOUGH. There was no voice which dared to utter, HERO, THE RISK IS TOO GREAT! The illustri∣ous patriot could hear but one voice, the sacred voice of his beloved country; to
<PB N="12" REF="037466_0011_100D456D3011A230"/>
obey which, had been the delight of his youth, and the sublime pleasure of his life.</P>
<P>BEHOLD him advancing to the ardu∣ous task, and recollect the feelings which then agitated every American breast. Did not every bosom glow with gratitude, and every heart expand with joy and confidence. See him engaged in the so∣lemnities of taking upon himself the im∣portant office. The hero of America was not there; the patriot, and the Chris∣tian alone appeared. The persevering patriot, again willing to devote his life, his fortune and his reputation to the wel∣fare of his country. The humble Chris∣tian looking up for aid to that Almighty Being, under the shadow of whose good∣ness he had walked in safety, and by the strength of whose arm, he had achiev∣ed happiness for his country, and for himself immortal fame.</P>
<P>FOR eight long years, all of them anx∣ious, and some of them extremely por∣tentous of evil, he presided over the im∣portant concerns of the union. With un∣remitting care and attention; with unex∣ampled
<PB N="13" REF="037466_0012_100D456F39F904C8"/>
wisdom and firmness, he discharg∣ed the arduous trust. His country's good was again his only guide, and its dura∣ble happiness his only wish. Superior to flattery, and unawed by calumny, he pur∣sued his course of well doing.</P>
<P>IT is impossible on this occasion, to detail the various measures which he pursued during this interesting period—let us select a few.</P>
<P>WHEN a daring rebellion against the laws, evidently instigated and designed to prostrate our government, broke out in a neighbouring State; with all the ten∣derness and affection of a father, he en∣deavoured to reclaim the disobedient. His character now shone forth with more than usual splendor. Whatever a sound head, or a benevolent heart could dictate to prevent the effusion of human blood, was attempted; and as length, when all his kind and paternal admonitions proved abortive, he in mercy, sent a force which forbade resistance, and without the loss of a single life, order, and obedience to the laws were happily restored: great
<PB N="14" REF="037466_0013_100D4571AF2F25B8"/>
was the disappointment of our enemies—glorious the result to us.</P>
<P>DURING his administration, a still more serious danger was to be encountered; a danger which threatened our peace, and the ruin of our commerce. It was a time to try his soul, and his soul was tried. The American people having their passions heated by the conduct of Great Britain, respecting the treaty of peace; their former animosities not yet subsided, and their minds enraged by the cruel and unjust depredations on their com∣merce, were ripe for a rupture; and but for their WASHINGTON, would have rush∣ed into the horrors of another bloody contest with the English nation. He knew their feelings, and how little many of them wished for peace and reconcilia∣tion. The incomparable patriot saw their danger, and happy for America, he knew his duty. He stepped in between the people and the precipice to which they had arrived, and by the wisdom, mode∣ration, and firmness of his conduct, he, without the desolations of war, procured for his country, what the loss of thou∣sands of lives, and millions of treasure
<PB N="15" REF="037466_0014_100D45747A1E8E28"/>
could but have effected—honorable peace, future safety, and complete justice.</P>
<P>BUT time will not permit me further to particularize his great and good actions. It must again be left to the faithful his∣torian, to record the various efforts of his genius to promote our peace, our honor, and our safety. Let it suffice at present to observe, that all the measures which he adopted or recommended, ei∣ther as to our internal or external rela∣tions, proved him the friend and the fa∣ther of his people; and that under his administration, these United States rose to a height of prosperity, unequalled in the annals of history; happy and free at home, honored and respected abroad. His country thus flourishing under its excellent constitution, and under just and equal laws; encreasing in wealth and population beyond its most sanguine hopes; peace in all our borders, and the cup of blessings overflowing in our hab∣itations. The illustrious patriot having a∣gain given us the most paternal advice for our future conduct, and expressed the most affectionate wishes for our fu∣ture happiness, again retires, and is a∣gain
<PB N="16" REF="037466_0015_100D457609DB7000"/>
followed by the blessings of a grate∣ful people, and the plaudits of an ad∣miring world.</P>
<P>WITNESS for me, my countrymen; did not every American heart then bespeak for him a rest from his public toils? did not every patriot pray, that to the length of many years, might be added his so long wished for repose from public cares?</P>
<P>BUT behold! new dangers arise, and his country calls again. Haughty, impe∣rious France, threatens our happy union with fatal divisions, and our government with destruction. The despoiler of nations denounces our independence, and mena∣ces us with ruin. Like Holland shall ye be plundered! like Switzerland shall ye be subdued! and like Venice will we bring you into market! was their lan∣guage to the American people.</P>
<P>As if the measure of his goodness could not be filled, the aged FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY is roused by the indignity offered to his children. The ardor of the soldier is not yet damped; the patri∣ot's
<PB N="17" REF="037466_0016_100D4577938DA550"/>
pulse still beats in unison with the feelings of his insulted country. He a∣gain obeys her call, and is appointed commander in chief of her armies. He again resolves to risque his life, and his exalted reputation in the doubtful fields of war. Glorious man! who can do jus∣tice to thy merit? who can find thy e∣qual? Death! thou hast made a blow which thou canst not repeat.</P>
<P>THIS, my countrymen, is a short, and as you all full well know, a very imper∣fect picture of a life spent for your good, and always devoted to your interest. But he is no more! Your illustrious gen∣eral, your wise and patriotic president, your constant and immoveable friend, is gone to that bourne from which there is no return. And this his natal day, here∣tofore a day of joy and festivity, is chang∣ed into a day of mourning and bitter grief. Let us not, my countrymen, on this afflictive occasion impiously say, that our God has forsaken us at this eventful and perilous period; let us rather inter∣mingle our sorrows with the consolotary re∣flections,
<PB N="18" REF="037466_0017_100D457A30CF7008"/>
that his co-patriot Adams lives; that he lives, and now presides with a mind capacious, and a heart sincere to serve his country; that many worthies—statesmen—sages—soldiers, still remain; a list too long for this day's numbering. Their past exploits are known, and their future conduct, under God, will promote our welfare.</P>
<P>BUT still we must recur to the melan∣choly truth, that <HI>WASHINGTON is no more.</HI> In him all hearts were united, and in the day of danger he was himself a HOST. He was the choicest gift that Heaven could have bestowed, and his loss is the most grievous dispensation.</P>
<P>THEREFORE let all the people mourn! And thou dear partner of his life, his cares, and his toils, let our tears assuage thy sorrows.</P>
<P>LET the friends of science, mourn! He was the patron of learning, and in public and private life, endeavoured to
<PB N="19" REF="037466_0018_100D457C9664F4B8"/>
promote the encrease of knowledge in his country.</P>
<P>YE American farmers, mourn! The farmer of Mount-Vernon was your friend; to promote the interests of agriculture, was an object of his peculiar attention.</P>
<P>YE merchants of America, mourn! To extend, promote, and protect your com∣merce, employed his assiduous care.</P>
<P>YE ministers of the holy gospel, and all ye friends of religion, mourn! He was your patron and your friend. Let infidels hear it and repent. The great, the good, the illustrious WASHINGTON acknowledg∣ed his God in all his ways. The <HI>political savior of his country,</HI> loved, worshipped and adored, the SAVIOR OF THE WORLD.</P>
<P>YE venerable matrons, and ye grey haired fathers, mourn! When your sons shall hereafter be called to risque their lives in their country's cause, you will no longer exultingly say, WASHINGTON leads.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="037466_0019_100D457E2120C238"/>
ALL ye sons and ye daughters of Co∣lumbia, mourn! when dangers from with∣out, or dangers from within shall here∣after assail us, we can no longer exult∣ingly exclaim, WASHINGTON lives.</P>
<P>YE soldiers of America, mourn! The soldier's pride, the soldier's boast, the soldier's friend is gone.</P>
<P>YE veteran soldiers of America; ye who have fought under his banners, and conquered by his side, I know not in what language to address you. Shall I call to your remembrance the days when with all his country in his heart, he led you forth into the crimson field of war? Recollect the persevering patriotism with which he endured the toils, the hard∣ships, and the dangers of the bloody con∣flict; recollect the unceasing attention which he always paid to your interest, and the unbounded affection with which he always honored you. He called not on you to fight, to make an addition to the sable list of tyrants; he called not on you to bleed, to encrease the number of slaves. Under his guidance you have reared a fabric of freedom, the most glo∣rious
<PB N="21" REF="037466_0020_100D2F5892485FC8"/>
the world hath ever beheld. Your amiable general; your beloved WASH∣INGTON is no more. My honored friends my heart bloods for you; I will not tell <HI>you</HI> to mourn.</P>
<P>YE departed ghosts of heroes, who have nobly fallen in this your country's cause; we envy you not this great addi∣tion to your happiness; receive your il∣lustrious leader; it is enough for you; but if ye can, give us the consolation of a moment's grief for us.</P>
<P>YE angelic hosts—but ye cannot weep. O! then pity a weeping nation.</P>
<P>BUT I forbear—words are not neces∣sary to excite our sorrow. Does not ev∣ery eye bespeak its grief, and every heart with rending anguish bemoan our loss. Let us rather look around for some ray of comfort; and is there any comfort? Yes my countrymen, there is: to live, to die, is the lot of human nature. "An angel's arm could not have snatched him from the grave;" but O sweet consola∣tion, ten thousand angels can't confine him there. Already his immortal spirit
<PB N="22" REF="037466_0021_100D4581351FBF28"/>
has been conducted to the regions of joy, and at the sound of the arch-angel's so∣lemn trump, he will rise, cheerfully rise, to receive an ample reward for all his virtuous deeds, in those realms of bliss, where rivers of delight incessantly flow, and where there are pleasures for ever∣more.</P>
<P>AND here my countrymen, let us make a solemn pause.—It has pleased the Almighty Ruler of the universe, who doth his will and pleasure in the armies of heaven, and among the inhabitants of this earth, to bereave us of our dearest friend; <HI>"the first in peace, the first in war, and the first in all our hearts."</HI> Let us im∣prove this painful calamity in such a man∣ner, as to evince the sincerity of our grief, and the reality of our sorrow. Let us emulate his many virtues, and constantly set before us his bright example. We cannot all be WASHINGTONS; he was the peculiar favorite of heaven; but we can all be <HI>patriots,</HI> and all be Christians. Like him, let us love our country, and in our different stations, exert ourselves to pro∣mote its welfare▪ While we lament a WASHINGTON, dead; let us honor and
<PB N="23" REF="037466_0022_100D45840D377410"/>
support an ADAMS, living. Like him let us love our God, and revere his holy law; by so doing, we shall truly honor his memory, and prove to the world that our beloved WASHINGTON still lives; that he lives in our hearts. Yes honored shade! thy name is there engraven, and while gratitude remains on earth it shall live. We will tell our children, and they shall tell their children, of all the good thou hast done for us, for them, and for the world. The aged parent shall re∣count thy heroic actions, and the lisping babe shall repeat them. From generation to generation, every father shall teach his son to venerate thy WORTH, and to honor thy TOMB.</P>
