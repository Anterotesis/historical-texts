<HEAD>DISCOURSE I.</HEAD>
<P>THE Providence of God this day to be improved is solemn and v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry affecting. It is no other than the death of the illustrious GEORGE WASHING∣TON, who departed this life on the 14th day of the month last past.</P>
<P>Frequently we have convened on mournful occasions; but never have we experienced a period of such general lamentation as the present. Our eyes have seen the bursting tear. Our ears have heard the painful shriek of the disconsolate. We have beheld husbands taking the last full gaze of their dearest companions; parents weeping for their children and refusing to be comfort∣ed, because they were not; and feeble, helpless or∣phans bereft of their only guides. But this day's ser∣vices, these badges of mourning indicate the keenest sensations, at the loss of a man, great beyond an equal, the father of his country, and the friend of the human race.</P>
<P>Propriety and the intent of this discourse, suggest it as suitable, that we feel no less solemn, than though the remains of this wonderful personage were now be∣fore us, to be entombed in our full view, and by our own hands.</P>
<P>You will therefore let me have your serious and re∣ligious attention, while I attempt to state something from God's word suited to the very important and mournful occasion.</P>
<P>The words to be the theme of the discourse, you will find written in the 2d Book of Samuel, the 1st Chapter, and the 27th verse:
<Q>"How are the mighty fallen!"</Q></P>
<P>The text is part of the Eulogium spoken by king
<PB N="4" REF="038304_0004_10119D2A8B307C98"/>
David on the death of Saul and Jonathan. Being in∣spired, his example sanctions the propriety of taking special notice of the death of those who have been illus∣trious in their lives. David was a feeling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ and taught of God, he touched the subject with the sublim∣est strokes of delicacy and sensibility.</P>
<P>He begins; "<HI>The beauty of Israel is stain upon the high places; how are the mighty fallen!</HI>" He goes on; "<HI>tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Askelon. Ye <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Gilbon let there be no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI>" In the cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of his lamentation, he repeats the text no less than three times; "<HI>How are the mighty fallen!"</HI></P>
<P>The words pertinently apply to the character of General Washington; he was "<HI>mighty.</HI>" They are applicable to his end; he has "<HI>fallen</HI>" a prey to death the king of terrors.</P>
<P>The words <HI>mighty</HI> and <HI>great</HI> have nearly the same import, I shall, therefore, use them promiscuously in the ensuing discourse, as shall be most convenient.</P>
<P>In the first place, I shall observe some traits in the char∣acter of General Washington in which his greatness was very apparent. Secondly, I shall notice the good∣ness of God in raising up such a character, and con∣tinuing his active services for so great a length of time. Thirdly, I shall consider the important instruction to be derived to the people of this country from his character, and the improvement, if wise, they will make of the Providence of God in taking him out of the world.</P>
<P>In illustrating the character, the following may serve as a summary. The greatness of General Wash∣ington appeared from his singular diffidence in accepting the first honors conferred on him; from his refusing pecuniary compensation for his many services both in the field and cabinet; from his familiar condescension to inferiors; from his remarkable intrepidity and knowl∣edge in warlike enterprizes; from his profound skill in in perceiving the result of present measures, thro' a complication of the most difficult and perplexing cir∣cumstances;
<PB N="5" REF="038304_0005_10119D2D17520C08"/>
from his unequaled patience and compo∣sare of mind on the most trying occasions; from his never having been elated by those many and distinguish∣ed honors conferred on him; from his retiring from the first o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ce in the nation to the place of a common citizen; and from universal consent.</P>
<P>This summary, I shall endeavor to unfold, with as much brevity and clearness, as I am capable.</P>
<P>The greatness of General Washington appeared from his singular diffidence in accepting the first honors con∣ferred on him. The greatness of this man was per∣ceived in the early part of his life. In Braddock's de∣feat he signalized himself so as not to be forgotten, tho at this time he was no more than about nineteen years of age. On the commencement of hostillities between the United States and Great-Britain, the continental Congress were unanimous in appointing him to the command of the army. The manner of his accepting the appointment, was a strong proof of his greatness. Not made vain, nor at all moved by the honor confer∣red on him, his mind was occupied with the arduous∣ness of the undertaking, and the importance and preca∣riousness of the result. He expressed his own insufficien∣cy, and dependence on the Disposer of events. Con∣scious there was a higher power who over-ruled, he did not depend on an arm of flesh; but with every mark of modesty and diffidence he accepted his appointment, from a sense of duty and not from motives of self-exalt∣ation. Almost any other man would have betrayed, either directly or indirectly, undue gratification at be∣ing raised at once to the highest post of trust and honor in the nation. But General Washington, with cheerful reluctance, bids farewel to Vernon's beauteous height, with a diffidence unequaled; and yet with such intre∣pidity and valour as could not fail rousing the timid, and inspiring every bosom with fresh resolution. Steady and unmoved, like a mighty rock, a crown of laurels at the conclusion of an eight years victorious war, al∣tered
<PB N="6" REF="038304_0006_10119D2EC5371158"/>
not the man. With the same steady smile, he leaves the field and retires to the sweets of private life. Called again, by the free and unanimous suffrages of the people, to the Presidency of the United States; he expressed his reluctance. With modesty he viewed himself unequal to the betrustment. But swayed by the voice of his country, he comes diffidently to the sa∣cred book and is qualified to office. Through the an∣nals of time, the modesty and diffidence of Washing∣ton on these occasions will set him up as one of the greatest of the human race.</P>
<P>His greatness appeared from his refusing pecuniary compensation for his many services both in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and cabinet. Without any regard to present possessions, whether they be great or small, there is a native thirst in the mind to amass more. This is a maxim which meets universal credence and is corroborated by fact. But in this respect General Washington must be view∣ed as singular and almost entirely alone. His mind was so elevated and his passion for wealth so subordinate, that the annual compensation of eight thousand pounds weighed not a feather in his consideration. In this feeling of mind, he was steady and persevering. He was great in wealth; but it was not his idol. This part of his conduct is at least an indication of his great∣ness.</P>
<P>The greatness of General Washington appeared from his generous condescension to his inferiors. His sta∣tion was the first. He was honored more than any other man in the world; but all this did not make him proud and haughty. He did not view it beneath him to mingle in social intercourse with the lowest peasant. Look to the despots of the eastern continent. At what cringing distance do they hold their subjects. If they speak, they die. With Washington how differ∣ent! Tho elevated to the highest pinnacle of honor, he did not forget that he was a man, and that others were so too. He wanted not flattery nor the parade of
<PB N="7" REF="038304_0007_10119D33EA360BA8"/>
adulation. He was never more in his element, than in friendly intercourse with those of ordinary station. This his greatness will never be forgotten.</P>
<P>The greatness of Washington appeared from his re∣markable intrepidity and knowledge in warlike enter∣prizes. All the talents of generalship united in him. His integrity was so far past suspicion, that the nation could repose entire confidence in him, without the least imaginary hazzard of fallacy. Beside, he held the esteem and affections of those under his command to a man. His counsels were cool and deliberate; and yet seasonable and adequate. The lives of those under him, he view∣ed precious, and he would not expose them contrary to the soundest policy, and the dictates of the purest reason. If he retreated from his enemy, after re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ec∣tion would sanction the measure. If he entered the combat, his valour and intrepidity were exceeded by none. Never was a man farther from cruelty. Prison∣ers of war felt safe at his disposal Compared with him, Alexander and the Caesars loose all their glory, as the stars their light by the rising sun. In short, language can hardly express his talents. He was uniform, and yet amazingly various. When we look on other gen∣erals we find one to excel in this thing and another in that. But Washington excelled in all. He was great in planning; and yet he was no better in plan∣ning than carrying into execution. But that in which he seemed as it were to rise above himself, was this, same did not reach him. He stood aloof from the eclat of an admiring world, like a statue unmoved. In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine, as a warrior and general in the field, antient history produces no rival. All that envy and malice could ever do to lessen him, could only set him the high∣er and sound the farther the glory of his athcievements.</P>
<P>The greatness of this man appeared from his pro∣found skill in the systems of national policy After this great man retired from the field, the public opin∣ion of him was in part as it is of other men. His mili∣tary
<PB N="8" REF="038304_0008_10119D3574941928"/>
glory resounded to the remotest clime. But it was conceived this was his greatest excellency, and that in the cabinet it woul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be impossible he should ar∣rive to equal greatness and fame. No sooner was he promoted to the Presidency, than the public mind was turned upon him, and prepared, at least, to discover some weakness, some deficiency common to great char∣acters. This idea which occupied the mind was the fruit of observation and analogical reasoning. That tal∣ents so numerous, so various and so extraordinary should meet in one man was past credibility. Without proof equal to vision it could not be admitted. This was the prepossession of the public mind. But so soon as General Washington had opportunity to display his political wisdom, he rose as a statesman to as elevated a pinnacle, as by his military exploits. The truth was, his mind was great and his conceptions adequate to eve∣ry undertaking. He was a lover of mankind, and therefore he could not be a tyrant; and for the same reason, he could not settle into the opposite extreme. To exalt human felicity was his object, and he had genius to discern the measures and principles which would accomplish the end. The best constitution of civil government seemed to be the natural growth of his mind, and to administer to the greatest advantage, was none beyond his abilities. When he took the Presi∣dency, he discovered the difficulties. The jarring and clashing interest and passions of the various states of the confederacy, would have been an infurmountable embarrassment to any other mind. But in the first outset, each state of the union felt his impartiality, and was linked by his skill, and make willing to re∣nounce party considerations, and to look to Washing∣ton as the patron and friend of the whole. When he came to the chair of state, it was a season of peculiar difficulty. Far were we from organization. Our fi∣nances were miserable, and our national credit beneath mediocrity. Foreign kingdoms looked to see us crum∣ble;
<PB N="9" REF="038304_0009_10119D398CB1E890"/>
but they were disappointed in the result. This great chieftain and sage of the nation, drew order from confusion, and soon made America an asylum for the oppressed, and the pride and astonishment of the whole world. As a statesman, his character stands alone. The kings and politicians of ancient and modern Europe, are sullied by Washington, as the moon by the usher∣ing in of the brightness of the morning. This his greatness will live to the latest ages.</P>
<P>The greatness of General Washington appeared from his wonderful foresight in perceiving the result of pres∣ent measures, through a complication of the most diffi∣cult and perplexing circumstances. Not to diminish from the wisdom of others, nor to detract honor from any man, Washington, in this respect, was without a parallel. And herein his greatness will ever stand ac∣knowledged. His acquaintance with men and things was amazing. He knew their passions: he was appriz∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of their views and objects. He let all circumstances have their just weight and no more. And hence little changes did not affect him. He could see through a mist of darkness which would wholly eclipse the sight of others. His mind was original, exact and clear in its conceptions. He was not hasty in accomplishing his designs; and yet he was familiar with the result thro' a complication of the most intricate circumstances. Closely did he cleave to the maxim of the wise man, that "<HI>in the multitude of counsellors there is safety;</HI>" yet his mind was independent and his actions without the least tincture of party consideration. This trait in General Washington's character can have no just de∣scription, because so rare. It is too delicate and ele∣vated to be touched with the pen. We may glance at it and wonder and that is about all we can do. A bet∣ter definition cannot be given of it than to say, it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> itself.</P>
<P>The greatness of General Washington appeared from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> patience and composure of mind on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. He was bred in affluence, and,
<PB N="10" REF="038304_0010_10119D3C2FB0F430"/>
in his private capacity, knew no other than the most easy fortune; and hence we might suppose him less likely to submit with resigned feelings to trying scenes. But, tho exalted by fortune, he was not voluptuous and effeminate. He had the hardihood of antiquity con∣nected with the best modern improvement. To meet extreme difficulties his patience and composure of mind were the most extraordinary. This example he exhibited both in the field and in the chair of state. Without permanent resources; with a small di∣minishing body of troops, and the country very much disheartened, he endured a whole year's embarrassment in Jersey and Pennsylvania. He could not fight for want of men. All he could do was to worry the ene∣my in the chase of him; except by mere generalship, which instances were not a few. But, with almost eve∣ry thing to discourage and backen, he discovered not a symptom of impatience. Restless discontent was un∣known to him. If ever a person could be justified for want of composure, Washington would, un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oudtedly, be the man; and yet he was at the farthest distance from any thing of the kind. This part of his charac∣ter did not appear to be a studied business; it was a na∣tive feature in it. His patience was not apathy and in∣sensibility, for no man had more tender and sublime sentiments than he. In his Presidency many things occurred which would have discomposed him, had he not been like a strong fortress, perfectly above the reach of receiving the least impression in this part of his char∣acter. As a vast rock in the midst of the sea, against which the beating billows roll without effect, stood the mighty Washington. He could bear insults without complaining. He could receive the vilest aspersions for the best deeds, and be as composed and patient as if nothing had been done.</P>
<P>The greatness of General Washington appeared from his never having been elated by those many and distin∣guished honors conferred on him. This feature in the character before us has been partly anticipated, and yet
<PB N="11" REF="038304_0011_10119D3F357FA9D8"/>
something more, I conceive, may be pertinently con∣sidered. In the esteem of the people at large through∣out the United States, this patriot stood vastly higher than any other man. He had his enemies, but even they were under the necessity of respecting him. The praises of Washington were resounded from one end of the Union to the other. People differently educated, of opposite views and principles, varied not any in setting him up as the greatest General and Statesman in the world. This was not only done by the people at large; the great and the learned considered it as indubitable. It was not a mere silent opinion; but it was a matter expressed in the strongest terms, and by actions of the most unequivocal import. General Washington was per∣fectly apprized of the light in which he was holden. It was none of it concealed from him. Let it be consider∣ed that these honors were heaped upon him, at a period of life in which they would be very likely to flatter and elate. But his mind was so steady, so weighty and ex∣alted in its apprehensions, that all these were without the least apparent effect in giving him a more exalted opinion of himself. We know that to feel lifted up at same, is incident to human nature. Few have wisdom and great∣ness sufficient wholely to conceal i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, even tho the de∣gree of honor conferred be very moderate. Washington was an exception of ever discovering a symptom. Some∣times he even wept at the amazing parade in crowning him with laurels; and when he could decently, he with∣drew from the reach of those who were prepared to ex∣press their sentiments of respect in forms the most honora∣ry. Than this nothing could be a more striking mark of General Washington's greatness.</P>
<P>His greatness was farther manifest in his voluntarily retiring from the first office in the nation to the place of a common citizen. When he drew near the close of the time, for which he had been elected to the Presidency, he could not but have known, beyond hesitancy, that the people, with unanimous suffrages, were ready to raise him again to the same dignified station. But this
<PB N="12" REF="038304_0012_10119D41EA0825A8"/>
great man had a preference for the peaceful retreats of private life. In the bosom of man there is a thirst for hon∣or; but Washington had gained the mastery over this pas∣sion. And what seemed greatly to corroborate it, was his accepting the appointment of Lieutenant General, an in∣ferior office to that he had before bolden. If we trace antient and modern history, where shall we find a parallel instance. Cincinnatus may be mentioned; but this in every respect does not equal it. Do we find the kings of Europe, Asia and Africa pulling off their crowns, and giving them to others, and humbling themselves to the condition of common subjects? Not an instance of this kind can be produced. They hold power as long as they can, and this without consulting the choice of those over whom they reign. How different was Washington! He was willing to take the lowest seat, and this was exaltation and greatness of the purest kind.</P>
<P>Finally, the greatness of this man appeared from uni∣versal consent. It is almost universally the case, that characters which rise the highest, do something toward the conclusion, to fully their glory; but this great General and Patriot did nothing. His character was a finished one. The last part was equal to the first. It grew brighter and brighter till the sun went down. It was all greatness. And thus it was considered, not only by Americans; but by all the nations of the world. They gathered the sen∣timent in part from his writings, in part from his military achievements, and in part from his political knowledge and wisdom displayed in the first office of the government. Attention to all these sources entitled him to an acknowl∣edged superiority to any other man upon the globe. His legacy, how replete with wisdom and depth of conception! His deeds, how unexceptionable, and fraught with every thing that was noble and conducting to national felicity and glory! So much in one man could not be hidden. It was beholden by an astonished world, and Washington stands acknowledged the first, the greatest of the human race. Thus I have observed some traits in General Wash∣ington's character, in which his greatness was very apparent.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="038304_0013_10119D44A0EE38B8"/>
I proceed in the second place to notice the goodness of God, in raising up such a character and continuing his ac∣tive services, for so great length of time.</P>
<P>We shall greatly fail in this part of the subject, if we omit considering, and letting it sink into our minds, that the Lord God was the great potter and former of the character we have been unsolding. The greatness of it, in every respect, in all the instances in which we have view∣ed it, was an effect of Almighty efficiency. It was the will of God to have such a character, a vessel of such vast dimensions; and, therefore, he said, let it be, and Wash∣ington was raised up. God's ultimate end in thus doing, as in every thing, was to display himself. And his good∣ness herein is very visible to all of spiritual discernment.</P>
<P>Let us then search into the goodness of God in the mat∣ter above specified; and to help our memories and guide our judgments, let us take the following out-lines as a summary. The goodness of God in raising up General Washington and continuing his active services for so great length of time, is strikingly apparent, from the blessings conferred on the people of this country through his instru∣mentality; from his example to future generations; from the influence his conduct may probably have with those, who hereafter shall be raised to the same elevated stations; from the very weighty instruction and reproof herein giv∣en to all tyrants and despots; and that God has hereby established, by a visible and acknowledged providence, one of the most essential points in the system of revealed re∣ligion, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> his absolute sovereignty.</P>
<P>The goodness of God in raising up General Washing∣ton, and continuing his active services for so great length of time, is strikingly apparent, from the blessings confer∣red on the people of this country through his instrument∣ality. In establishing our national independence, Gene∣ral Washington was an instrument greater than any other. By this no one will imagine there is the least design to detract from other characters and fully their same. We have had many heroes and great statesmen whose names will never be forgotten by a grateful people, and through whom God's
<PB N="14" REF="038304_0014_10119D4649FD3C58"/>
goodness has been strikingly exhibited. It is pleaded, however, that General Washington was undoubtedly the first and greatest. To sever this country from foreign do∣minion, was the will of heaven, and it was the decree, to do it by instruments and not by miracle. The man whose less we now mourn, was the principal instrument, and how great the goodness of God in raising him up! This may be set in the most obvious point of view, by consid∣ering our national and individual blessings. As a nation, we are the proprietors of a free and happy country. We have not to cross the wide Atlantic to consult the pleasure of our sovereign. Our property is our own by indefeasi∣ble tenure. We are built on the broad base of freedom, and our national government is in every view such as good citizens will prize as one of the greatest of temporal bless∣ings. Nothing is wanting but good and pious hearts to make us the happiest people on the globe Taking into view our civil privileges, the goodness of God is most visi∣ble in raising up the instruments by which they are secu∣red to us. Among these, Washington was the principal. He, under God, has guided us through indeseribable haz∣ards to independence and national felicity. God was the efficient cause of the whole; and yet he gave existence to the talents of this great man, and used them to accomplish his benevolent design. And how good is the Lord, that he should endow one in this country, with such unequaled portions of integrity, wisdom and fortitude, as to take us by the hand and lead us safely to a field of such invalu∣able privileges as those we possess? We can never adore this goodness enough. And what heightens the good∣ness of God, in raising up this great and distinguished character, is, that we were favored with his active services for so great length of time. We had the use of his abilities in situations the most hazardous for twenty-five years in succession. When a nation begins to exist, then is most wanted the wisdom of the wise. God saw our necessities, and did not withhold the bounty of his goodness. He gave us Washington to go before us, and to be with us, and to nourish us up to our present state of national im∣portance.
<PB N="15" REF="038304_0015_10119D48E8C40130"/>
It would be infidelity itself not to notice the goodness of God in this matter. The eminent usefulness of this great man we do not deny; that his being and tal∣ents were from God is beyond hesitancy; and that the whole was the fruit of unmerited goodness, will be felt by all, but the vile and abominable.</P>
<P>Our privileges in small societies and individual capacity are handed to us by God through the same channel of conveyance. The least observation must lead us to no∣tice it If foreign power could tax away our property at option and demand our young men to sight their bloody battles, could any of us do otherwise than go mourning, and acknowledge ourselves to be slaves and pensioners? But blessed be God it is not so with us; and why is it the reverse? The Lord has wrought through the instru∣mentality of him, whose wisdom and prowess have given us freedom and independence and secured to us our property beyond the fear of having it divided without our consent.</P>
<P>The goodness of God is manifest in his raising up Gen∣eral Washington and promoting him to the high offices he sustained, from the consideration, that his example still exists and will never be obliterated from the memory of man. The force of example, experience teaches, is ve∣ry great. Nothing can have a more baneful effect on a community than bad example, especially in those of eleva∣ted stations. Virtuous example has the contrary tenden∣cy. The reign of David over Israel was very unexcep∣tionable, and the happy influence of his example descend∣ed to future generations. We have the character of Gen∣eral Washington portrayed before our eyes, and our chil∣dren's children will be the objects of its influence. And what special lesson doth it enforce? To answer in a word, it bears testimony against immoral practices of every de∣scription, and paints virtue in charms which cannot easily be resisted. Washington is no more; but his example is a living monitor. This is a sharper reproof to vice, than the threats of majesty, or the terrors of the halter or the gibbet. The value of the example is greatly heightened, from the consideration that it is well-known to all classes
<PB N="16" REF="038304_0016_10119D4D64D70BA8"/>
of citizens from the highest to the lowest. The good∣ness of God is very visible in this particular.</P>
<P>From the influence his conduct may probably have with those, who hereafter shall be raised to the same important stations, we may also see the goodness of God. If Gen∣erals in the field and Presidents of Congress, should be at a loss how to steer amidst perplexities which sometimes oc∣cur, they have a character before them from which wis∣dom flows as a stream from its fountain. Having caught the mantle of this great statesman, those who fill the high∣est seats in the government, it is sanguinely hoped, will transfuse its blessing to ages yet unborn. Washington, standing at the head of the series, will give complexion and features to what shall follow in the administration of this great and flourishing empire. At least the sentiment is not chimerical nor wholely improbable. This is a fruit of divine goodness.</P>
<P>The goodness of God is manifest in raising up and con∣tinuing this great man at the helm of the nation so long, from the very weighty instruction and reproof hereby giv∣en to all tyrants and despots.</P>
<P>The greater part of the eastern continent is subjected to despotism. The life and property of the subject are at the sole pleasure of the prince. Thirst for power and ag∣grandizement is the governing passion. The obedience they receive is of the slavish kind; it proceeds not from love, but from fear of their vengeance. Well might they look to Washington and be instructed, that the highest excel∣lency of a ruler, is to be just and benevolent, and that to have obedient and faithful subjects, is to prove himself their patron and friend. How reproved must stand those des∣pots and hard hearted tyrants who have embrued their hands in innocent blood, by the bright example of this mighty hero and statesman? Through the goodness of God, we have reason to conclude, they have felt the re∣proof, at least in some small degree. The high estima∣tion in which General Washington has been holden by all the kings and princes on the globe seems to imply it. If so, the condition of millions in servitude is hopefully me∣liorated
<PB N="17" REF="038304_0017_10119D50434F0FA8"/>
and rendered more tolerable in consequence of the existence of such a character. If in this way th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Gov∣ernor of all events, be softening the rigor of despotism, then his great goodness in raising up and continuing Gen∣eral Washington in the important stations he held so long, cannot but be clearly seen.</P>
<P>The goodness of God is very srikingly exhibited in raising up the character we have been contemplating, since, through this providence, he has established one of the most essential points in the system of revealed religion, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> his absolute sovereignty. By the sovereignty of God is meant nothing which clashes with infinite goodness. It is not an arbitrary procedure contrary to the reason and fitness of things. It is his creating and governing the world and all beings according to his own righteous pleasure. The point is established by natural religion. It is confirmed with additional clearness in the two testaments. Such passages as these evidence it to demonstration. "<HI>He work∣eth all things after the counsel of his own will.</HI>" "<HI>All things were made by him and for him.</HI>" "<HI>He hath mercy on whom he will have mercy and compassion on whom be will have compassion.</HI>" "<HI>We are the clay and thou our potter.</HI>" The self same sentiment is forced upon the mind, by the char∣acter we have been considering. The fact is this; God Almighty formed Washington a greater vessel than almost any other, and in this way has proved his sovereign right to make men to differ. In making some great and others small he is justifiable, because the clay is his. Complain∣ingly to object, why hast thou made me thus? is contend∣ing with a most material point in the system of revealed religion, corroborated by the goodness of God, in the acknowledged fact under consideration. Let us then not dispute the absolute sovereignty of God, till we sacrifice our judgments on the altar of obstinacy, and put out our eyes for fear of the light.</P>
<P>Having noted instances of the goodness of God in form∣ing and continuing this illustrious character for so great length of time; I shall thirdly, consider the important instruction to be derived to the people of this country from
<PB N="18" REF="038304_0018_10119D55172C01C0"/>
his character, and the improvement, if wise, they will make of the providence of God in taking him out of the world.</P>
<P>From the character of General Washington, the inhab∣itants of this country may derive many very special lessons of instruction. With the help of this character they can have no hesitancy on whom to turn their thoughts to fill the most important offices in the government. It may be admitted as a ruling maxim, that those who possess the nearest likeness to this great warrior and statesman, will have the first claim on our suffrages and influence. Washington possessed all the virtues and abilities requisite to fit him to preside over a nation, and, of course, those who approach the nearest to him in these respects will in future adminis∣ter best; till the blessed period shall arrive, when the Prince of Peace shall solve all nations into a happy kingdom and rule by his heavenly sceptre.</P>
<P>The people in this country may be farther instructed by this character, that vice and immorality utterly disqualify a man for an important, public station. The confidence of a people is not attainable by base characters. A man of disorderly life will always be suspected of a radical de∣fect. Those who fill the first offices should be men in whom entire confidence may be reposed without suspicion. Washington was such a man. And how happy and ex∣alted have we been under his administration! And hence the people in this country, if suitably impressed, will cau∣tiously avoid all characters of the opposite complexion in filling the chair of state. "<HI>When the wicked rule, the peo∣ple mourn.</HI>"</P>
<P>But it is time to descend to the last clause of that part of the subject under consideration, and to search after the improvement those who are wise will make of the provi∣dence of God in removing General Washington by death. He who hath loved us, fought for us and worn out his life in the services of his country, is now entombed in the silent grave. Never will he be seen more by mortal eye. Never will another speech fall from his lips. He is gone where all must go, and this has been ordered by the wise
<PB N="19" REF="038304_0019_10119D56ACD7D008"/>
disposal of God. And what improvement shall we make of this affecting providence? Perhaps we may be almost ready to say, wherefore is it thus! Why should the exe∣cutioner be suffered so speedily to do his work! Could not his hasty steps have been a little retarded! Such thoughts must not be indulged. God's "<HI>thoughts are not as our thoughts, nor his ways as our ways. Though clouds and darkness are round about him; yet justice and judgment are the habitation of his throne.</HI>" It becomes us to submit and kiss the rod which is laid so heavily on us, and open our mouths in the language of inspiration, "<HI>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, and blessed be the name of the Lord.</HI>"</P>
<P>In improving this death, we of this nation cannot but behold a thick and dismal cloud suspended over us. Our head, our greatest counsellor, the man the most beloved and trusted to, is taken away. We have, therefore just occasion for mourning. Our loss is greater, than we yet imagine. It may well be sensibly felt, by every state in the Union, by every smaller community, and by every in∣dividual. O Washington, thou are gone, but we will not forget thee! Thy great deeds, thy glorious achiev∣ments shall be engraven in letters of gold. When we look on our dear-bought freedom we will think of thee. When we count our treasures, when we see our children growing up in a garden of delights, distant from the thun∣der of despotism, we will teach them to lisp thy name. We do weep for thee, and in broken accents, bid thee a long, last farewel.</P>
<P>In improving this death, it becomes all the inhabitants of united America to lift up their servent prayer to God through his son, that the wisdom and virtues of this great man descend and rest on those who hold the first offices in the nation. Ye civil fathers, we cannot but mingle the tears of condolence with you. You are deprived of a brother and a father. In perplexing situations, you looked to him for wisdom and counsel; but he is taken from your head, our prayer is, that you, with submissive hearts, catch hismantle, and stay yourselves on the Lord.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="038304_0020_10119D5B3A7DC910"/>
We are taught by this solemn and affecting provi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nce "<HI>To put not our trust in princes nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help. His breath goeth forth, he return∣eth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.</HI>" No endowments of wisdom and greatness can secure from the bold demands of death. The great and the mighty fall, and we must have our turn. These limbs, these bodies must soon mingle with their kindred dust. This being inevitable, how vastly important, that we do the work God has given us to do, before the night cometh wherein no man can work. We must all stand before the tri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nal of Christ to be judged according to our deeds. Let then the death of this great and wonderful personage serve to bring our dissolution fresh to mind. Let us con∣verse with death and eternity, and be seriously inquisitive, whether we are prepared for our final exit out of time. To leap down the awful precipice with fear and trembling, who can endure the thought! Short of the sanctifying in∣fluence of the Holy Spirit, through the blood of Christ, death will convey us to endless despair. Look, there∣fore to the Lord Jesus by faith, receive his gospel in the power and spirit of it, and be charmed with his glorious character. Be assured there is enough in the divine Sa∣viour to crown you with infinite delight. How truly great, how illustrious the character we have been unfold∣ing, how signalized, how finished and admirable! But this, with all its excellency, proceeded from the forming hand of Christ. He is the "<HI>wonderful Counsellor, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, and the Prince of Peace.</HI>" He invites you to come to him, to be heirs with him, and set with him forever in heavenly places. He will crown all his sons and daughters with delights which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have en∣tered into the heart of man to conceive. Let our souls awake in pious praise and magnify the Lord most high.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>REVELATIONS xi, 17,</BIBL>
<Q>"<HI>We give thee thanks, O Lord God almighty, which art and wast, and art to come, because thou hast taken to thee thy great power and hast reigned.</HI>"</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE words are an inference drawn by the twen∣ty-four elders from something which preceded. They sat before God on their seats and were furnished with the text I have read to you by the seventh angel. The declaration of the angel, or rather the found which proceeded from him, was followed with great voices in heaven, saying, "<HI>The kingdoms of the world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ, and he shall reign forever and ever.</HI>" On the hearing of this, the twenty-four elders, who sat before God, fell upon their faces and worshipped God, saying, "<HI>We give thee thanks, O Lord God almighty, which art and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power and hast reigned.</HI>" What particularly dilated their hearts with praise and thanksgiving to God, was the wonderful effect produced by his almighty efficiency in causing the kingdoms of this world to become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ. The twenty-four elders traced the effect to its true source and origin, and ascribed it to the governing power of almighty God; "<HI>because thou hast taken to thee thy great power and hast reigned.</HI>"</P>
<P>When they saw Christ's kingdom rising out of the ruins of the apostacy, and the wicked nations of this world sub∣mitting to his divine and heavenly sceptre, they could ac∣count for it on no other principle, than that God had the control of the dispositions of men, to turn them according to his sovereign pleasure. In view of this, they prostra∣ted themselves before him with the profoundest reverence, and shouted his praise in grateful thanksgiving.</P>
<P>It would be an undue construing of the text to suppose its ultimate reference to any other period, than to Christ's
<PB N="22" REF="038304_0022_10119D601C46B948"/>
spiritual reign in the seventh millinary; and yet it has a pertinent application to other times, and may be contem∣plated to very great advantage in the age in which we live. If all the blessings to be experienced, when all shall know the Lord, shall owe their origin to God, and derive their existence from the consideration, that God hath taken to himself his great power and hath reigned; then it will fol∣low, as a necessary consequence, that all other blessings of whatever kind and whenever received, are of the same heavenly extract. This reasoning, I conceive, will not be viewed by any, sophistical and inconclusive. If not, it is hoped the minds of the auditory are prepared with all readiness to embrace the sentiment, that all the blessings they receive, whether private, social, national, or spiritu∣al, spring directly from this source, that God almighty hath taken to himself his great power and hath reigned. You will, therefore, let your minds go along with me in the discussion of the subject, with hearts uplifted to God, and not the less that this thanksgiving was not by public, but private notification.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is a usual custom in the place in which this dis∣course was delivered, to have an annual thanksgiving lec∣ture, tho no proclamation be issued from authority.</NOTE></P>
<P>In prosecuting the subject, I shall, in the first place, take into consideration some of the peculiar blessings and benefits we enjoy. Secondly, Shall shew that these bene∣fits and blessings are to be accounted for solely from this plain truth stated in the text, that the Lord God doth take to himself his great power and doth reign. Thirdly, I shall point out the obligations under which we are to give thanks to God, that we, and all creatures and things, are under his administration and absolute control.</P>
<P>Firstly, We are to consider some of the peculiar bless∣ings and benefits we enjoy. It is a great blessing to have such an existence as that of man.</P>
<P>This will appear from a variety of considerations, some of which I shall enumerate. When we compare ourselves with the various species of creatures that fall under our
<PB N="23" REF="038304_0023_10119D63020D5C30"/>
observation, how decided is our preference to be men, rath∣er than animals of any other order. All creatures upon earth, except man, move by instinct and blind passion. They are capable of no improvement in subjects of a moral nature, and to discover the least degree of difference be∣tween virtue and vice, they have no ability. But man is endowed with noble faculties and is a capable subject of rising higher and higher in knowledge and virtue to all eternity. A foundation being laid in us for such vast im∣provement, must endear existence to every one, who con∣templates the matter in a just light: To say the least, to have such an existence, is a great benefit and blessing. But when we take into consideration the amazing value conferred on our existence by the Christian religion. the favor is augmented beyond conception. The existence of any creature is ever to be estimated according to the felicity it is capable of receiving. Man is to exist forever, and, if a Christian, as he may be, if he will give Christ his heart, nothing short of happiness "<HI>which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,</HI>" will be his certain and unfailing por∣tion. Thus contemplating the matter, we cannot but see the immense value of our existence, and that to be endowed with such improving faculties is a blessing of indescribable importance.</P>
<P>It is a great blessing to have bodies so curious and won∣derfully made. The very shape and motion of man excite awe and reverence in the inferior orders of creatures and challenge superiority. Our bodies are organized to be a suitable repository for a rational spirit. They are so skill∣fully contrived as not to shackle the soul and prevent its moral and intellectual improvements. Well said the Psalm∣ist; "<HI>I will praise thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made, and in thy book all my members were written. How precious are thy thoughts unto me, O God!</HI>"</P>
<P>Health is a peculiar benefit and blessing. The body, tho curiously organized, is yet delicate and exposed to al∣most innumerable disadjustments. If any of the parts loose their proper tone, the effect is sensibly felt through the whole. If one member suffer, all the members suffer with
<PB N="24" REF="038304_0024_10119D66E09ABDA0"/>
it. Great exactness must be maintained in the human frame, or health will be impaired. Visit hospitals and rooms of the sick, and hear the groans of those who are racked with pain, and deny, if possible, that health is a peculiar blessing.</P>
<P>To have and enjoy a competency of the good things of this life, is a benefit which it would be ungrateful to over∣look. Laid in the balance with religion, these things are lighter than vanity; and yet, during our abode upon earth, they are indispensible. God does not support man by mi∣racle, nor warm and clothe him otherwise than by means. In the cold of winter, without clothing, food and fuel, man would be immediately wretched. The piercing frost would benumb his limbs, and gnawing hunger make him a prey to death. Looking, therefore, upon the inevita∣ble consequences of being deprived of every worldly good thing, the benefit of the means of bodily support cannot but be seen in its proper light.</P>
<P>The benefits and advantages resulting from social inter∣course in society may well hold a high place in our esti∣mation. Man is formed for society, and this is a great source of his happiness. Exclude him from holding con∣nection with any of his species, and he is wretched. All his trials and difficulties must remain locked up in his own bosom. The organs of speech and hearing would be use∣less to him. Here he must spin out his life without one kind look from any creature, or the hearing of one articu∣late note. To roam in solitude, how tedious, days and nights! but, on the other hand, open to man all the ad∣vantages of society, the family circle and every thing be∣yond, of friendly intercourse, and what a large field of plea∣sures and advantages disclose to view. Is he under a cloud of adversity, his friends stand ready to sympathize. Has he pleasures, they are doubled by imparting. It is to so∣ciety our moral and intellectual faculties are indebted for a great share of their improvement, and, by often speak∣ing one to another, Christians are excited to a more vigor∣ous animation in the duties they owe to God and men. Thus society is a peculiar blessing and benefit.</P>
<P>Civil government is another distinguished privilege and
<PB N="25" REF="038304_0025_10119D69DE040948"/>
blessing. Such are our passions, and such the connection between men, that civil institutions are absolutely requi∣site. God has over-ruled in this matter, that men might be secured in their rights, and that the lawless and diso∣bedient may be checked in their abominations. There∣fore it is written; "<HI>Whosoever resisteth the power, resist∣eth the ordinance of God; and they who resist shall receive to themselves damnation. For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good and thou shal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have praise of the same. For he is a minister of God to thee for good; but if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain, for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.</HI>" Thus we see the design of civil government. Its end is noble and a privilege granted to man of no inferior importance. That we might realize its utility, let us contemplate society independen of it. Let us view the wicked and lawless without rest<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, at liberty to invade life and property at option. Were mat∣ters thus circumstanced, who would be safe and not be continually exposed to the most base aggressions? All must be convinced, that wretchedness would be the unavoidable result. Neighbour would rob neighbour, and our streets would be drenched in blood. Civil government is that, which, under God, secures life and property and stamps them with value. It is, therefore, an evident blessing, a benefit unspeakably rich.</P>
<P>Having pursued the subject thus far, blessings of another kind offer themselves to our consideration. By these are meant spiritual blessings in Christ. The gospel, which brings life and immortality to light, is a treasure so great, that every other dwindles to nothing holden in competi∣tion with it. The ultimate design of it, is not to teach men the arts and oeconomy of this world. It discloses glad tidings of great joy, states the grounds of admission to the favor of God, and what we must do to be saved. The gospel, therefore, is a blessing by itself and without a parallel.</P>
<P>The philosophers of antiquity had their conjectures re∣specting a future state, but they were the idle chimeras of
<PB N="26" REF="038304_0026_10119D6BB733AEF0"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> darkness. Aristotle, Socrates and Plato made attempts to reclaim men from the arms of vice; but their attempts were fruitless. If they prescribed formularies, they had no authority to enforce them, and to shew of∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nding man how he might be pardoned for crimes already c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmitted, they were as incapable as their most ignorant pupils. But the Son of Righteousness has chased away every cloud of heathenish ignorance and superstition, and explained, to the lowest capacity, the way of life. The gospel asserts the doctrine of the atonement, and yet it has other concomitant blessings. The atonement and salva∣tion are two things. In perfect justice, God might have made apropitiation for sin, without saving the sinner; and yet he grants eternal life to whomsoever he pleases. Sal∣vation supposes an exemption from the penalty of God's righteous law, and admission into his heavenly kingdom. In this is comprised conviction of sin, regeneration, sanc∣tification, and a crown of righteousness which fadeth not away. Thus I have noticed some peculiar blessings and benefits conferred upon man.</P>
<P>Secondly, I shall show that these benefits and blessings are to be accounted for solely from this plain truth stated in the text, that the Lord God doth take to himself his great power and doth reign. The reasoning by which it may be made to appear that God governs, is easy, it is not far fetched. It is a necessary consequence resulting from the perfections of his nature. If God be the author of all things he must govern them. His government must be as extensive as his works. Our ideas of God's government are too limited, if we suppose only some great things under his control, and others more minute, left out of his plan. The falling of a sparrow to the ground and the numbering of the very hairs of our head, are matters of which he has the particular disposal. And hence all the blessings we have enumerated are the immediate fruit of his almighty, governing efficiency. God governs in the matter of our existence. For preservation we are ab∣solutely dependent. In him we live, move and have our being. The favor of having a rational existence above
<PB N="27" REF="038304_0027_10119D705317C970"/>
other creatures, is because God is at the head of the uni∣verse and has so ordered. When we contemplate our bod∣ies so curiously formed, our improving faculties, the means of improvement, our health and strength, our food and raiment, and con over the whole sum of blessings generally called common, we can trace their origin no farther than to the reigning power of God. Men speak of these things as matters of mere chance, and often praise their own wis∣dom for having planned affairs so luckily. They arrogate to themselves all the glory, and conduct as if there were no God. Nevertheless, by arguments, a priori, the being of a God is found to be necessary, and by fair deductions <HI>a posteriori</HI> his attributes and universal government are con∣clusively maintained. And hence, it is no infringement on the best <HI>logic</HI> to speak as in the following sentences. He maketh rich and he maketh poor, he exalteth and he ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣seth. Every spire of grass, every blade of wheat, every degree of growth in an animal, is an effect of his mighty agency. He gives strength to beasts, and causes them to exercise it for man, as strictly as he gave birth to creation, and governs in little things as especially as in great. It is just so in respect to civil government. It is the Lord's. He holds the heart and volitions of every ruler from the high∣est to the lowest. By him kings reign, and princes de∣cree justice. If men mean evil, God means it for good. If they despise and refuse to retain him in their knowledge, he will, nevertheless, be exalted, and from that very mat∣ter get to himself a great name.</P>
<P>Christianity, with all its blessed effects, is known and enjoyed, because God hath taken to himself his great pow∣er and hath reigned. The covenant of redemption ratifi∣ed between the Father and the Son, before the world began, was of the Lord. The coming, life, death, resurrection and ascension of Christ, were un∣der his superintendence. He reigns in the work of con∣viction. "<HI>Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; whereby the people fall under thee.</HI>" Aside from this, men will never know themselves. They will glide a∣long in the broad road to ruin and perceive it not. Finite
<PB N="28" REF="038304_0028_10119D749BDDAAC0"/>
art is inadequate to discover to them their hazardous situa∣tion. But when display of God's power is made, they will be pricked to the heart, and see themselves to be poor, and wretched, and miserable, and blind, and naked. Man is naturally disinclined to see the light. His eyes are fast shut against it. And to keep him blind, satan is always busy. But the power of God supercedes every obstruction, and produces the wonderful effect of convincing him of his real condition.</P>
<P>The renovation of the heart, is because God reigns and has the dispositions of men at his command. The wonder∣ful effect in the millennium, in causing the kingdoms of this world to become the kingdoms of Christ, is traced to this source. And there is no other way of accounting for the regeneration of any sinner. "<HI>The new birth is not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man; but of God.</HI>" Men are not converted as a reward for any thing previously done by them to purchase the change. They do not put themselves into a salvable state, by sinning less, and so invite God to renew them. He is found of them, who sought him not. He conquers the stubborn heart in the full strength of its opposition, and, by his invisible draw∣ings, captivates the soul to the obedience of faith.</P>
<P>Christians are kept from final apostacy by the same power by which they are regenerated. Christ takes care of his flock. He is the great ruling shepherd, and, therefore, none are lost from his sold. They are kept by the power of God, through faith, unto salvation. Thus the matter of saving sinners, from beginning to end, is through the infinite reigning power of God. This has always been the case and will be till time shall be no more.</P>
<P>Thirdly, I shall point out the obligations under which we are to give thanks to God, that we, and all creatures and things, are under his administration and absolute con∣trol. Men, in general, will grant they are under obliga∣tions of gratitude to God; but what this gratitude ought ultimately to respect is not so commonly perceived and ac∣knowledged. God is good to us, and therefore that we ought to make grateful returns to him, will not be contested.
<PB N="29" REF="038304_0029_10119D7780E75E78"/>
But if we love God on no higher principle, than that we ourselves are made gainers by his goodness, our love is of a selfish kind, and our gratitude the fruit of a sinful heart. "<HI>If ye love them that love you, what thank have ye:</HI>" For sinners give to sinners, in hopes to receive as much again. There is no love acceptable with God, short of that which esteems and adores him for what he is in himself; nor any gratitude fit to be so denominated, except thanksgiving which is put into exercise by the consideration, that he takes to himself his great power and doth reign. Our obliga∣tions to gratitude remain to be unfolded. One obligation to give thanks to God for his universal reign, may be gath∣ered from analogy. Reasoning from analogy reflects great light on many subjects in divinity. The point before us is not an exception. Holy beings are excited to devout thanksgiving, in view of the pleasing truth, that all crea∣tures and things are under the absolute control of the Al∣mighty. We may be assured this was the case in regard to the twenty-four elders. "<HI>We give thee thanks, O Lord God almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; be∣cause thou hast taken to thee thy great power and hast reigned.</HI>" The saints in light and all the holy angels, are continually shouting, "<HI>Amen: blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honor, and power, and might, be unto our God forever and ever.</HI>" The spring of the whole is, that God's reign extends to all events and circumstances, and secures a final result in every view most eligible. Do then the inhabitants of the glorious world feel themselves obligated to render thanks to God, because he hath taken to himself his great power and doth reign? Is this the business of all pure and holy beings? If so, all men, yea, every rational creature in the universe is obligated imme∣diately to exercise a similar disposition toward God, and from the same consideration. Because, what is suitable for one order of rational beings, is so for another, since there is but one law and one lawgiver. Hence the argu∣ment from analogy is conclusive, in establishing our indis∣pensible obligation to give thanks to God; because he hath taken to himself his great power and doth reign,
<PB N="30" REF="038304_0030_10119D794CABD1F8"/>
and that we, and all creatures and things, are under his administration and absolute control.</P>
<P>Another obligation of gratitude arises from the infinite wisdom and goodness of the divine government. God be∣ing infinitely powerful, wise and good, the plan of admin∣istration which he hath adopted must be the best. To de∣ny this, would be to deny the perfections of God Perfec∣tion will act like itself, and hence, any other government than that which embraces the highest possible good, all things considered, is unworthy of Jehovah. Here then is an ob∣ject sufficiently excellent to awaken every soul to the live∣liest thanksgiving. It is the best possible system of govern∣ing and disposing of all beings and worlds. As our obliga∣tion to love God results from the moral excellency of his character, so one of the principal springs of gratitude origin∣ates from the consideration that he takes to himself his great power and reigns in infinite wisdom and goodness. In the view of this particular, it will be obligatory for ever on all finite beings to exercise the highest strains of thanksgiving, and this aside from every thing sinister. To do it, will be the glory and felicity of the spotless hosts of heaven, and to refuse it, will be the misery and torment of the wicked in hell. A farther consideration, which lays us under in∣creasing obligation to give thanks to God that we, and all creatures and things, are under his administration and ab∣solute control, is, that this is the source whence all true happiness springs. Separate from a full persuasion and be∣lief that God reigns, the glorified spirits above and all Chris∣tians would sink into a state of wretchedness. If it be given up that God reigns, then it must be granted, either that some other being reigns, or that events are at the disposal of blind chance. On either of these hypotheses, what have the friends of God to rejoice their hearts, what have they to expect? If fatan governs, nothing but the fruits of ma∣levolence can be in prospect. And if the affairs of the universe are left to the guidance of chance, our very exist∣ence is casualty, and every expectation of good to come is vain and groundless. But, blessed be God, the affairs of the universe are not so circumstanced. All government

is his. He hath taken to himself his great power and doth reign. Here is happiness, here is comfort for the friends of Zion. "<HI>The Lord reigns, let the earth rejoice, let the multitudes of the isles be glad.</HI>" In this belief there is no room for despondency. In the darkest hour, under the greatest pressure of affliction, there is joy for the upright in heart. "<HI>Altho the fig-tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vine, the labor of the olive shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail; and the fields shall yield no meat, the flock shall be cut from the fold, and their shall be no herd in the shall; Yet I will re∣joice in the Lord, and joy in the God of my salvation.</HI>" The divine government, therefore, being the principal source, whence all holy intelligences do and will forever derive their felicity, it is suitable the grateful incense of our hearts should ascend to God, that we, and all creatures and things, are under his administration and absolute control.</P>

<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>In conformity to the preceding discourse, I shall suggest some considerations, which, by God's blessing, may serve to awaken your gratitude a fresh. Every favor you enjoy whether private, social, national or spiritual, is the fruit of the reigning agency of the Almighty. Your daily supplies are his free donation. Is your cup full? the Lord hath fill∣ed it. Have you good measure, pressed down and running over? you have received it from your divine benefactor. This has been a year of fat things. Your houses and gra∣naries will bear me out in the assertion. No blighted har∣vest, no destructive hurricane, no deluging flood, no de∣devouring insects, hath God sent this year, to cut you short of a plentiful supply for yourselves, your children and your cattle. He has not suffered the destroying an∣gel to come nigh your dwellings. You have heard of the raging pestilence in some of our capital cities; but you are alive this day with your little ones. You set under your own vines and fig-trees and have none to molest you or make you afraid. As citizens you enjoy a government founded on benevolent principles and happy in its admin∣istration. Not another nation on the globe can compare with us in freedom and felicity. We have been envied
<PB N="32" REF="038304_0032_10119D7F43A08338"/>
our privileges, and numerous attempts have been made to deprive us of them. Times not a few, thick darkness has hovered over our heads, and we have been threaten∣ed with devastation and death. Our profoundest politi∣cians have been often perplexed and could see no light. But the shades of night are dissipated, and prospects the most pleasing open before us. All these favors and bless∣ing result from the governing agency of the Almighty. This being true, will any be backward to come into the sentiments and feelings of the twenty-four elders and say, "<HI>We give thee thanks, O Lord God almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power and hast reigned?</HI>" God has a just right to the grateful emotions of your hearts. And do you enter his gates, this day, with thanksgiving and his courts with praise? Do your hearts burn within you in view of God's universal reign? Are your souls in haste to break forth in these holy sentiments? Thou art our God, and we will praise thee; thou art our God, and we will exalt thee. In return for thy blessings, we have no equiv∣alent to repay thee; but we will not cease to adore thy government. Thou shalt have our humble thanksgiving. It is thy claim, and our reasonable service.</P>
<P>Before I close the subject, I cannot omit bringing up to your recollection the marvellous work of God in the conversion of sinners within the compass of the present year. Converts have been multiplied in places in every direction. Ministers and missionaries have been wonder∣fully blessed. Saints have shouted for joy, and Christ has been glorified. But, not to burthen your memories and swell the discourse to an undue length, the display of God's sovereign grace in this town, to which you have been eye witnesses, calls for the grateful emotions of your souls, and all that is within you. When we contemplate the ori∣gin of this refreshing from the presence of the Lord, the dismal night of stupidity and darkness which preceded it, and the insufficiency of means and instruments to effect any thing of the kind, we are necessitated to ascribe the whole to the reigning power of almighty God. The

Lord hath wrought wonderfully, because "<HI>he hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and compassion on whom he will have compassion.</HI> Not to acknowledge his sovereign∣ty in this matter, implies a heart of unbelief in departing from the living God. You will not hesitate to say: "<HI>It is the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes.</HI>" How precious the blood of Christ, and how infinite his grace to pave the way for such a work! The salvation of one sinner in point of importance, is as far beyond every thing temporal, as the heavens are high above the earth. And have you come prepared to give God the glory which is due to his name? In looking and pondering on the matter, let us never forget, that this work hath been wrought because, he hath taken to himself his great power and hath reigned. This being true, there is every encour∣agement for prayer. All hearts are in his hand and he can turn them whithersoever he will. Does God thus reign, and are the fruits of his government such? We ought to be humble in the dust, that we have not seen more of it, been more delighted with it, and praised him in higher notes of thanksgiving. Is the Lord such a God? resolve this day to be entirely his.</P>
