<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>2 SAMUEL, iii. 38.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is a prince, and a great man, fallen this day in Israel?</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE man, the great man, to whom the king of Judah refers in this passage, was Gene∣ral Abner, commander in chief of the armies, <HI>the thousands of Israel.</HI> He was possessed of great po∣litical and military abilities. These he displayed in the cabinet, and in the course of that bloody war which continued long <HI>between the house of Saul and the house of David.</HI></P>
<P>Attached to his country by warm affection, he voluntarily stept forth in the defence of its rights, its liberties, civil and religious; and fought the battles of the Lord of Hosts▪</P>
<P>He was highly esteemed by his countrymen. His name gave pleasure to all ranks, and to all
<PB N="6" REF="037646_0004_100F2C6EE7D9C840"/>
ages, of citizens; and in Abner, the great Abner, they placed the most unreserved confidence.</P>
<P>He was now grown old in the service of his country; and the time of his departure drew near. Like all other great men, the general must die! His exit was attended with circumstances peculiarly affecting. This solemn event took place when his friends were promising themselves great advantages from his wisdom, patriotism, fidelity, and perseverance. They were then hop∣ing for the renewal of a union between them and a nation with whom they were now at war. Yea, a treaty was, at that very time, actually on foot for the desirable purpose.</P>
<P>This great man was interred with peculiar marks of respect. We are informed, in the sacred page, that <HI>king David himself followed the bier.</HI> His memory was embalmed with military honours. The scene drew tears from the vast multitude that attended upon the affecting occasion; who com∣posed the funeral procession. <HI>And they buried Abner in Hebron; and the king lift up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="037646_0005_100F2C711E0A3750"/>The text then may be considered as an eulogy delivered at the tomb of this great man. It contains the effusions of a heart deeply affected with the subject, and appears to be spoken with all the energy of oriental eloquence. The orator was the sweet Psalmist of Israel. <HI>And the king la∣mented over Abner; and all the people wept again over him.</HI></P>
<P>And to impress the minds of the risen, and especially the rising generation, with a sense of the obligations they were under to this great man, orders were issued by authority, that proper badges of mourning should be worn by the citizens in honour to the renowned and illustrious general. <HI>And David said to Joab, and to all the people, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner.</HI></P>
<P>The people, no doubt, were the more deeply affected by this event, the fall of this pillar of the state, as the times were <HI>troublous.</HI> There was not that harmony in sentiment, with respect to the public measures, which every friend to society most devoutly wished; and war, though at a dis∣tance, raged with relentless fury.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="037646_0006_100F2C7354683E40"/>What tidings were these to the great national council! to the army! to the citizens! and to every benevolent friend of mankind! <HI>Abner is fallen!</HI> fallen from his sphere of honour, dignity, and usefulness! fallen by the all-conquering arm of the great destroyer of man! How much wis∣dom, what military glory, are consigned to the narrow limits of his venerable tomb! This brave man is fallen into the silent grave! <HI>There, princes, counsellors, and the prisoners, rest together. The small and the great are there, and the servant is free from his master. They lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.</HI></P>
<P>What a gloom was now spread over the mourn∣ing nation! Yea, a neighbouring prince, contem∣plating the irreparable loss society sustained in the death of this great man, observes, <HI>I am this day weak, though anointed king.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, in the course of Divine Providence, a pros∣perous and flourishing family, an agreeable circle of acquaintance, an opulent and increasing town, a whole nation, by the death of an important in∣dividual, may indulge a momentary despondency, and say, <HI>Clouds and darkness are round about him.
<PB N="9" REF="037646_0007_100F2C75711F4970"/>
Thy judgments are a great deep. Thy way is in the sea, thy paths in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.</HI> But to the pious, who ever trust in God, light, like the morning sun, arises from the consoling consideration, that <HI>righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne.</HI> These, when darkness spreads over the political horizon; when those great and good men, who by their wis∣dom and influence <HI>seemed to be pillars</HI> in church and state, are removed by death; yea, these, with unshaken confidence in Jehovah, <HI>are glad, and re∣joice, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth.</HI></P>
<P>This passage, my brethren, contains sentiments which harmonize with the present feelings of the United States, with a variation, the propriety of which all must acknowledge to be just: Know ye not, my friends, that General WASHING∣TON, one of the greatest and best of men, is fal∣len in America!</P>
<P>Who can refrain, upon this mournful and so∣lemn occasion, from exclaiming, O Death! what a victim dost thou now embrace in thy cold arms! Thou art indeed the king of terrors.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="10" REF="037646_0008_100F2C782D81F6A0"/>I. WASHINGTON was great.</P>
<P>His Maker endowed him with distinguished mental faculties, and formed him for great and no∣ble actions. His mind was solid, contemplative, sedate, vigorous, tenacious, and determined. His acquirements were such as rendered him agreeable, instructive, and eminently useful, to his connex∣ions and to mankind. His genius was prolific: its productions were such as displayed depth of thought, soundness of judgment, peculiar penetration, and unconquerable energy. But what gave a lustre to his great abilities, his assemblage of virtues, and to all his heroic achievements, was, the uprightness, the benevolence, of his heart. What a disinterested regard for the welfare of his country animated him, in his various exertions, while he was engaged in the most hazardous enterprises!</P>
<P>He had an uncommon knowledge of men, of nations, and of the art of war. Of this no one can doubt, who will read the history of the Ame∣rican war. Through our long contest with Britain, this Great Man, in the most trying cir∣cumstances, displayed the wisdom, the courage, the united qualifications, which rendered him emi∣nent
<PB N="11" REF="037646_0009_100F2C7B189716F8"/>
in his important station, prepared him to con∣tend victoriously with the most renowned European generals, and, under the protection and influ∣ence of the Lord of Hosts, and God of Armies, to become the saviour of his country.</P>
<P>Thus when fleets and armies arrived upon our coast, and had taken possession of the town of Bos∣ton, with a view of depriving us of those privileges which our venerable predecessors so highly valued; when we found ourselves under the disagreeable necessity to have recourse to the sword; to raise an army of American youth to defend the liberties, and to secure the civil and religious rights, of their native land; at this period of memorable impor∣tance, the Great and Benevolent Governor of the Universe had, in his wise and merciful providence, provided a WASHINGTON to take the com∣mand of our newly-raised army.</P>
<P>Before this Great Man whole armies fell, laid down their arms, and owned him Conqueror. Proud Britain was defeated in her cruel attempt to subdue the Americans; and, "after expending nearly one hundred millions of money, and losing an hundred thousand lives, was reduced to the hu∣miliating
<PB N="12" REF="037646_0010_100F2C7D557D7ED0"/>
necessity of acknowledging the indepen∣dence of the United States."</P>
<P>In this Great Man were united patience, pru∣dence, probity, sincerity, veracity, firmness, calm∣ness, and unconquerable perseverance.</P>
<P>Actuated by that benevolence which influenced him to serve his country almost eight years as Ge∣neral of the American Army, he refused every pe∣cuniary compensation for his inestimable services.</P>
<P>But the greatness of this excellent man was not only exhibited in his military character; his Poli∣tical Abilities shone with unsullied lustre. He was great in the cabinet. Even Congress itself, that venerable and highly-esteemed body of wise states∣men, were indebted to WASHINGTON for that information which originated those resolves, the wisdom of which has astonished the world.</P>
<P>We, my brethren, feel, to this day, the happy effects of his influence in that National Conven∣tion, by whom the plan of our Federal Govern∣ment was formed, in which WASHINGTON, with his usual dignity, presided.</P>
<P>Called by the unanimous voice of the millions of America, he took the first seat in our new go∣vernment;
<PB N="13" REF="037646_0011_100F2C7FCDEF13E0"/>
and we, with gratitude to Heaven, beheld GEORGE WASHINGTON President of the United States.</P>
<P>Here a wide field was opened; here was scope for the display of the abilities of this great and il∣lustrious Patriot.</P>
<P>All were pleased; all rejoiced; for all approved of, and put confidence in, his wise and successful administration.</P>
<P>How safe felt all ranks and denominations of citi∣zens! and what prosperity was extended over our quiet country! The friends of mankind, upon both sides of the terraqueous globe, rejoiced that Ame∣rica was favoured with such a Great and Good Man; so eminently qualified, and so benevolently disposed, to guide their public affairs, and to give energy to their government. Yea, gentlemen of distinguished observation and philanthropy, who came from the Old to visit the New World, like Sheba's queen beholding <HI>Solomon in all his glory,</HI> have, with no less admiration, when acquainted with this Great Man, exclaimed, <HI>It was a true re∣port that we heard in our own land of thy acts, and of thy wisdom. Howbeit, we believed not the words until
<PB N="14" REF="037646_0012_100F2C82048FCD08"/>
we came, and our eyes had seen it. And, behold, the half was not told us. Thy wisdom and prosperity exceed the fame which we heard. Happy are thy men. Hap∣py are these thy servants, who stand continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom!</HI></P>
<P>As an evidence of the greatness of this Man, in the estimate of the most enlightened and judicious of mankind, the celebrated heroes, politicians, statesmen, and benevolent, of all nations, have considered it as their brightest ornament to be classed with General WASHINGTON.</P>
<P>The friends of religion, who interest themselves in the welfare of society, have not been the inattentive spectators of these momentous events, these amazing revolutions, which have been rolling on; and with which they have felt themselves, and the cause they are engaged in, most intimately connected. They have been concerned <HI>for the ark.</HI> Their closets can witness the sincerity and fervency of their prayers to their God for their dear country. When therefore they saw this Great Man placed at the head of our government, they con∣sidered it as an evidence that God had not forsaken this, though they were a very ungrateful and wick∣ed
<PB N="15" REF="037646_0013_100F2C843689AF68"/>
people; but that he had blessings in store for the present and future generations. They perso∣nally and unitedly rejoiced that God had raised up this Great Man to be an instrument of so much good to them and to their brethren.</P>
<P>It was in an eminent sense supporting to the humble followers of the Lamb of God, of which they had the most plenary evidence, that WASH∣INGTON was not seeking personal fame, worldly emolument, popular aggrandizement, and unlimit∣ed power; but through all his military exertions, and his political labours, he was aiming to promote the peace, happiness and best interest of his country. This assimilated him to the ancient Mordecai, who was <HI>accepted of the multitude of his brethren; seeking the wealth of his people, and speaking peace to all his seed.</HI></P>
<P>WASHINGTON discovered true greatness by his attention to, and uniform regard for, religion. He believed that there was a God who governed the universe; <HI>that he doth according to his will in the armies of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; that none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What dost thou? Therefore he praised, extolled
<PB N="16" REF="037646_0014_100F2C86648BB298"/>
and honoured the God of heaven; all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment; and those who walk in pride, he is able to abase. He knew that there is no king saved by the multitude of an host; a mighty man is not delivered by much strength.</HI></P>
<P>He saw the hand of God in those remarkable providences which took place under his inspection, and were the effects of his exertions; that con∣catenation of events, which preceded, opened the way to, and terminated it, the independence of America. In the hour of victory therefore, he called upon all the brigade of his army to give thanks to the Almighty for his merciful interposi∣tion in favour of his conquering troops.</P>
<P>Thus, at the surrender of lord Cornwallis, the Commander in Chief of the American army re∣commended to the officers and soldiers to attend upon divine service with a serious deportment, and with that sensibility of heart, which the recol∣lection of the surprising and particular interposi∣tion of Providence, in their favour, claimed."</P>
<P>Recollect, my brethren, his answers to the nu∣merous and flattering addresses of his fellow
<PB N="17" REF="037646_0015_100F2C888A1B95E0"/>
citizens; in which he kept his eye upon the government of Jehovah; took nothing to himself, but gave all the glory to God.</P>
<P>Washington professed a veneration for the GREAT REDEEMER; was one of his visible followers; united himself to his disciples; sat at his table; and commemorated that solemn, that most interesting event, which opened the way for the salvation of sinners.</P>
<P>It was one of the maxims of this Great Man, that religion is the only durable foundation of republican governments. If a people are prosper∣ous and happy, they must acknowledge God in all their ways, observe his precepts, and obey his commandments.</P>
<P>He knew that they, and they only, are truly great, who consult, and exert themselves to pro∣mote, the best good, the real happiness, of man∣kind.</P>
<P>His conduct upon the stage of public life was a striking declaration, that vice is no part of, but is incompatible with, real greatness; that a man may sustain the highest offices, move in the most conspicuous sphere, be surrounded with the most
<PB N="18" REF="037646_0016_100F2C8B713C1870"/>
flattering temptations, and yet not deviate from, nor violate, the laws of his God.</P>
<P>In the history of this Great Man we behold the most immaculate character that was ever drawn by the pen of an uninspired historian.</P>
<P>Here, my brethren, is an example replete with wisdom and virtue, worth the attention and imi∣tation of politicians, magistrates, citizens, and persons of all ranks and ages; an example which not only excites the admiration of the present age, but will gain the veneration and applause of future generations.</P>
<P>The greatness of WASHINGTON was not eclipsed by his retirement from public life. The very idea of his being alive, an inhabitant of MOUNT VERNON, had a greater tendency to pre∣serve the union of the States, and to repel foreign invasion, than an army of twenty thousand men.</P>
<P>And when our national affairs wore an alarm∣ing aspect, we see him, at the call of his country, "cheerfully relinquish the sweets of retirement, and once more take the command of the armies of the United States."</P>
<P>But, while moving in this sphere of nation∣al importance; forming the necessary arrange∣ments—death
<PB N="19" REF="037646_0017_100F2C8E32188620"/>
put an end to all his plans; dashed the high-raised expectations of Americans, and filled the world with mourners.</P>
<P N="2">II. WASHINGTON is fallen.</P>
<P>This Great Man was mortal. It is the decree, the irreversible decree, of Jehovah, that man must die. <HI>I said, Ye are gods, but ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.</HI> With propriety may we adopt the affecting lamentation of David over his beloved Jonathan, who fell upon mount Gilboa; <HI>How is the mighty fallen!</HI></P>
<P>By the decrease of this great man, this benefactor, this highly-esteemed, heroic general, this patrio∣tic statesman, the United States sustain a loss, an irreparable loss. His sudden, unexpected exit has deprived his AMIABLE CONSORT, his dear con∣nexions, his weeping friends, of this ornament to his country, this justly-admired, virtuous, great, and most amiable man.</P>
<P>The departure of such a man, in the present situation of our public affairs, must be considered as no common calamity to our nation, and even to the world.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="037646_0018_100F2C8FC304B868"/>But the scene is closed! We must see his face no more! His voice, which charmed thousands, is succeeded by a solemn, awful silence. His pen, that taught lessons most important to society, has dropped from that hand, which, guided by an enlightened mind, a virtuous heart, has charmed the world by its productions.</P>
<P>The Wise and Holy Governor of the Universe hath in the course of his providence, which is ever just and righteous, removed from this re∣gion of calamity the Father of his Country. Yes, there lies WASHINGTON, upon a level now with a continental soldier! Both sleep quietly together, in the same grave; the house appointed for all the living.</P>
<P>It is true, so long as the human mind is possessed of the power of recollection, the character, the example, of this great man must be immortal.</P>
<P N="3">III. It is reasonable that we should take pub∣lic notice of this alarming event.</P>
<P>When Abner died, the king, the court, the army, the citizens, assembled; and, as a testimo∣nial of their respect, dropt a tear over the fallen general.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="037646_0019_100F2C9152409798"/>Much honour most certainly is due to the memory of those great men who have rendered essential service to their country.</P>
<P>How immense is our debt of gratitude to God, who raised up this Great Man, and qualified him for his distinguished station!</P>
<P>Upon this occasion sorrow hath filled our hearts. Americans put on sackcloth; they wear badges expressive of the general lamentation. We are all mourners this day.</P>
<P>That venerable sage, the renowned ADAMS, President of the United States, must sensibly feel, and unite with Congress in deploring, the de∣parture of this Great Man.</P>
<P>The army contemplate the death of their Gene∣ral with the keenest sensibility; and express their undisguised grief in the animated style of an an∣cient military corps: WASHINGTON was <HI>worth ten thousand of us.</HI></P>
<P>The Children of God, the Disciples of Jesus, are the most sincere mourners in this day of darkness. They, it is true, are reconciled to all the divine administrations. But when men of distinguished worth, and of eminent usefulness, are suddenly re∣moved
<PB N="22" REF="037646_0020_100F2C94365ADF08"/>
by death, they consider it as a token of the displeasure of God; a judgment of Heaven upon an u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ateful, wicked people.</P>
<P>The face of every citizen, who is a friend to his country, gathers paleness, and neighbour addresses neighbour in the language of the text: Know ye not that WASHINGTON, that great and good man, is fallen in our Israel!</P>
<P>But why do events like these take place in the wise and perfect government of the the Most High God?</P>
<P N="1">1. This event is calculated to impress the mind of man with a sense of universal mortality.</P>
<P>Here we have the irresistible evidence, that the most distinguished abilities, conspicuous virtues, wealth, honour, popularity, extensive usefulness, all that the world esteem great and valuable, can∣not secure the possessor from sepulchral darkness, the gloomy mansion of the grave.</P>
<P><HI>As for man, his days are as grass; as the flower of the field so he flourisheth. The wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more▪ His days are determined; the number of his
<PB N="23" REF="037646_0021_100F239AD67CED70"/>
months are with thee; thou hast appointed his bounds, that he cannot pass. Man lieth down, and riseth not till the heavens be no more.</HI></P>
<P>How loud the present call! how alarming the admonition!</P>
<P>It is said of the king of Macedon, that he or∣dered his servant, though he might be surrounded by his nobles, his generals, all the pomp and pa∣geantry of his court, every morning to enter his apartment, and to whisper in his ear, PHILIP, THOU ART MORTAL.</P>
<P>May rulers and ruled hear the voice of God in this speaking providence: <HI>Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.</HI></P>
<P>And may we, my brethren, daily repeat the pe∣tition of ancient piety, <HI>Lord, make us to know our end, and the measure of our days, what it is, that we may know how frail we are.</HI> In the view of our approaching dissolution, may we realize the vast importance of <HI>repentance towards God, and of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ; that when he who is the believer's life shall appear, we may appear with him in glory. Therefore be ye also ready, for at such an hour as ye think not the Son of Man cometh.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="24" REF="037646_0022_100F2C98DCE5C420"/>2. By the death of General WASHINGTON we are taught not to put too much dependence upon any of our fellow creatures, however great and useful.</P>
<P>Is it not an evidence of the depravity of human nature, that rational beings forget that the <HI>wise man dieth?</HI> that the most important members in the community <HI>dwell in houses of clay, whose foun∣dation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?</HI></P>
<P>I recollect, in the course of the American revo∣lution, an observation of a young continental offi∣cer, who had, not many days before, left the camp. He was, with peculiar pleasure, dwelling upon the matchless qualities of his General. When it was suggested, that WASHINGTON was but a man, and that he might soon fall a prey to the great de∣stroyer; I know, replied the animated soldier, that it is possible; but it is highly improbable that a man of his worth; of his importance to America, and to the nations of the earth; a man, too, for whose life the prayers of ten thousand christians daily ascend to the throne of heaven; <HI>I repeat it,</HI> it is altogether improbable that WASHINGTON should die.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="037646_0023_100F2C9B03F99400"/>The inhabitants of the United States have, perhaps, put too much dependence upon this Great Man. In his death, therefore, God is teaching them, that <HI>it is better to trust in the Lord, than to put confidence in man; it is better to trust in the Lord, than to put confidence in princes.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The fall of WASHINGTON must be con∣sidered as a frown of God upon this people, to whom he was so very dear.</P>
<P>Never, in the view of some of our most en∣lightened citizens, never did the United States stand in greater need of his wisdom, influence, and exertions: so doubtful hang the political scales, both in Europe and America. The time, most certainly, is truly critical. The loss, therefore, of this Great Man, at such a momentous crisis, ought to be viewed as a judgment, sent by the Ruler of nations, upon the inhabitants of this guilty com∣munity. God is now correcting us; and, by this providence, he is calling upon us all, old and young, to repent, and turn to God <HI>from all our transgressions, that iniquity be not our ruin.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. This event affords matter of conviction, to every reflecting mind, that we are greatly indebted
<PB N="26" REF="037646_0024_100F2C9E1CB37150"/>
to God for preserving the life of this Great Man to so late a period.</P>
<P>We can recollect times when, if he had been removed, our loss would have been greater, and his benevolent wishes to his country incomplete. But he lived to see our enemies defeated, America independent, the Federal Government establish∣ed, commerce flourishing, agriculture progressing, the nation rising in respectability, the whole com∣munity enjoying the blessings of civil and religious liberty, his fellow citizens in the quiet and full pos∣session of the means of political and moral felicity.</P>
<P>Contemplating these desirable events, WASH∣INGTON drew his glittering sword. And when he saw them accomplished, he returned it into its scabbard, and retired from the theatre of public life, that he might enjoy the long-wished-for fruits of his persevering exertions, viz. his countrymen <HI>sit∣ing under their vine, and under their figtree, and no one to make them afraid.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore, while we deplore the death of this Great Man, let us with grateful hearts acknow∣ledge the goodness of God in continuing him so long a distinguished blessing to the United States.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="27" REF="037646_0025_100F2CA059C51F48"/>5. Such events, my brethren, taking place in the wise, benevolent and perfect government of God, may be overruled for the greater happiness of a people.</P>
<P>Soon after Abner's death peace was established between Israel and Judah. One of the wisest of men was placed at the head of the nation, the armies were disbanded, the sound of war was heard no more, and Ophir's gold enriched the public treasury. The temple of the Lord reared its sacred head; the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, present themselves before, and devoutly worship, the God of Abraham. Prayers and praises ascend to Jehovah. We are informed, that <HI>they went unto their tents joyful, and glad of heart, for all the good∣ness that the Lord had done for his people.</HI> Thus their mourning is turned into joy. The hand of the Lord is more visibly seen, both in the hour of adversity and prosperity, and to God they ascribe all the glory.</P>
<P>Although our beloved Friend has <HI>closed his eyes,</HI> and now sleeps the long sleep of death, <HI>the Lord liveth.</HI> He governs his great empire in the most desirable manner. The present very affecting pro∣vidence,
<PB N="28" REF="037646_0026_100F2CA1E7182208"/>
connected with, and being part of, his great plan, will be overruled for the display of his glory, and promote the best good of all those who are reconciled to the divine will; those <HI>who love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity.</HI></P>
<P>God can raise up men, and qualify them for the most important stations in society. He can pre∣pare the minds of this people to eye his correcting hand in the fall of this great man, General WASHINGTON; and bestow the richest of his blessings upon our dear country.</P>
<P>May we hear the voice of inspiration, which up∣on the present occasion is particularly pertinent: <HI>Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help. His breath goeth forth, he re∣turneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish. Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the Lord his God.</HI></P>
<P>May light arise in darkness upon the United States, and God be glorified in the salvation of our country.</P>
