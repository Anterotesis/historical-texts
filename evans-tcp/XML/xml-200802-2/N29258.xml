<OPENER><SALUTE>PATRIOTIC FRIENDS AND MOURNEIS!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AUSPICIOUS was the day, which an∣nounced to the world the <HI>birth</HI> of our illus∣trious and beloved WASHINGTON. Venera∣tion and esteem for his character, and gratitude for his public services, have enrolled it amongst the anniversaries of AMERICA. Oft, on its re∣turn, have her early patriots and heroes rallied round the <HI>standard</HI> of Liberty, with cheerful hearts and smiling countenances, to enjoy the grateful festivity. While they indulged to pleas∣ing reflections, extolling his virtues, expatiating on his indefatigable labours, and recounting to their sons the various occurrences of the late re∣volution, the hardships they endured, the dangers they escaped, and the precious blood and trea∣sure their liberties cost, <HI>the thought,</HI> that this GREAT FATHER of his country still lived, consummated their social enjoyment. This they celebrated as one of their happiest days.</P>
<P>THE revolving seasons have completed their circuits. The <HI>day</HI> has again dawned; and we are assembled. But the <HI>scene!</HI> Oh! how revers∣ed!
<PB N="4" REF="038972_0003_1012399E1396C928"/>
Instead of songs of joy, and festive enter∣tainments, our eyes behold the sabled desk, our ears are accosted with the woful knell and funeral dirges, and a whole nation is shrouded in mourn∣ing. WASHINGTON IS NO MORE. Not the <HI>dear partner</HI> of his life only, the faithful domes∣tics, his particular circle of friends, and those in public life; but COLUMBIA, humanity, virtue and the world feel the shock, and weep. Tears, on such a solemn occasion, are not weakness, but a virtue, a <HI>patriotic virtue:</HI> for it is thus a grateful nation embalms the memory of the MAN, whom all esteemed, and all delighted to honour.</P>
<P>COULD eminence of character, noble achieve∣ments, or the affections of his country, have pri∣vileged above mortality, this man had not died. In him united true magnanimity with more than princely, with <HI>republican virtues.</HI> He was an orna∣ment to human nature, an honour to this western world. What mere man ever proved a greater national blessing, or left behind a more excel∣lently finished character?</P>
<P>WHEN so much endeared worth draws off the stage, decency and our feelings sanction the cus∣tom, in ages past, of commemorating brilliant virtue, and transmitting heroic deeds to posterity. The death of great and good men has always been lamented, as a public calamity. Did not all Israel weep for Moses? and all Judah and Je∣rusalem
<PB N="5" REF="038972_0004_101239A0C6F7F750"/>
for king Hezekiah? UNITED AME∣RICA▪ all alive to affection and gratitude, through every state, with all her millions of hearts and tongues, pays her departed WASHINGTON, this day, her voluntary tribute of tender grief; eulogizing his sublime virtues, proclaiming the distinguished actions of his life, and holding up to view his amiable example.</P>
<P>WHILE, with the affectionate tear swelling in the eye, we unite to deplore the loss of this GREAT FRIEND and BENEFACTOR of his country, let us indulge the melancholy pleasure of contemplating some of the <HI>leading traits</HI> of a character, which the world, with one consent, admires, esteems and reveres; a <HI>pre-eminent cha∣racter,</HI> in which stand concentrated and displayed the virtues of the MILITARY HERO, of the PA∣TRIOTIC STATESMAN, and of the PRIVATE CITI∣ZEN.</P>
<P>SIMPLE narration here is the highest eulogy.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON THE GREAT descended from a virtuous and respectable family. The place famed for his nativity is the parish called Washington, in the county of Westmoreland, and state of Virginia. And the day, signalized in our calendar by that happy event, is February 22d, 1732.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="038972_0005_101239A3BA4772E8"/>DESIGNED by Heaven for a distinguished Actor on the great theatre of the world, the SUPREME PARENT of all was bountiful to him in the gifts of nature. His <HI>form</HI> was majestic and graceful. His <HI>countenance</HI> mingled gravity with mildness, and wore impressive tokens of penetration, pru∣dence and fortitude. His <HI>disposition</HI> was gentle, but firm; modest, but courageous; cheerful, yet reserved; active and persevering. True <HI>genius</HI> he possessed, accompanied with sound judg∣ment; and great <HI>energy of mind,</HI> tempered with cool deliberation. His <HI>education,</HI> though private, was upon a liberal and extensive plan, and pecu∣liarly favourable to virtuous morals. And his YOUTHFUL EXERCISES conspired to add firmness to his constitution, and vigour to his mental system.</P>
<P>FORMED to figure, no sooner did opportunity present, than he exhibited convincing specimens of superior abilities. Before his arrival at the age of twenty, he commenced a military life, in the respectable rank of Major. Being a <HI>confidential character,</HI> in 1753 he was charged with a special message of remonstrance to the French, upon their depredations on the western British fron∣tiers; and at the same time entrusted with full authority to treat with the savage natives. The important commission he fulfilled in such a mas∣terly manner, as at once evinced his great talents and virtues.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="038972_0006_101239A56563CED0"/>AT the age of about twenty-three, he was ad∣vanced to the office of Lieutenant Colonel; and soon after, to that of Colonel. In the war which ensued, he was an active and valiant offi∣cer. The policy of his measures, and his spirit∣ed exertions, never failed to do him honour. Redstone witnessed his prowess, and furnished trophies of victory. But his conduct, at the me∣morable time of Gen. Braddock's defeat, obtain∣ed the applause both of Great-Britain and the colonies. In that unhappy engagement he was a volunteer, and extra Aid-de-Camp. Acquainted with the Indian mode of fighting, and appre∣hensive of danger, he solicited leave to pre∣cede the regular troops, and scour the woods with a party. Had he been permitted, that slaughtered army had probably been saved. But the haughty General contemptuously denied his request. The consequence was, he was sur∣prised by an attack, principally of Indians in am∣buscade. A bloody scene ensued. Braddock fell; and all was confusion. But, amidst the general consternation, under the direction and influence of young WASHINGTON, the militia covered the retreat of the remains of the British army, and prevented their entire destruction. And we may add, through the whole of that last French war, so far as his health admitted, he was un∣wearied in contributing to the support of the common cause.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="038972_0007_101239A7F4A4E9D8"/>UPON the restoration of tranquillity to the middle frontiers, after resigning his commission in 1759, he sat down to cultivate the peaceful arts, as a farmer, at MOUNT VERNON. There he amused himself with agricultural employments, till the commencement of the American revolu∣tion. During that interval, he was a civil "Ma∣gistrate, a Judge of the Court, and constantly a Member of the Assembly."</P>
<P>AS time rolled on, great events unfolded. At length the meditated subjugation of the Ameri∣can colonies to the parent country excited a ge∣neral alarm, and enkindled the flames of liberty. This rising SON OF FAME immediately espoused the cause of his injured country, and took a de∣cided part in her favour.</P>
<P>ESTABLISHED in his reputation, and possessing the confidence of the people, he ranks amongst those famous sages and patriots who constituted the first Continental Congress, in 1774. There he breathed such pure patriotism; discovered such knowledge of human nature and govern∣ment, and of the state of his country, and the arts of defence; and the virtues of his heart beamed so conspicuously, that the delegates from every part of the Union were struck with his greatness, and charmed with his goodness. He was like∣wise elected a member of the second renowned Congress, the next year.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="038972_0008_101239AAF9643ED8"/>PUBLIC difficulties increased, and the times grew more distressing. On April 19th, 1775, the revolutionary war began. An army was soon raised to defend the rights and liberties of Ame∣rica; and on June 15th, following, GEORGE WASHINGTON was unanimously appointed COMMANDER IN CHIEF. Powerful and regularly trained to war was the enemy he had to encoun∣ter, and vast were the disadvantages under which his infant country laboured. What were un∣disciplined troops, without ammunition, pro∣vision, clothing or money, to face an army of veterans? But when, to be a freeman or a slave, was the only alternative, not the most difficult nor dangerous prospects could discourage a mind like his. Confiding in the righteousness of his cause, and the God of armies, he did not hesitate to risk his fortune, his character and life; and, with that self-dissidence, which is always an attendant on real worth, he accepted the im∣portant trust.</P>
<P>ALL eyes looked up to him; and never was the GENERAL played off to greater advantage. Should we follow him from the renowned heights encircling Boston, through all the perilous and trying scenes of the revolution, till he obtained the final decisive victory over Cornwallis, at Yorktown, we should find, under all the different aspects of public affairs, he uniformly acted the
<PB N="10" REF="038972_0009_101239AD5AB0E6A8"/>
same great part. What a mixture of painful and pleasing reflections springs up in our minds at the recollection of the various occurrences and events which took place at Long-Island and New-Jersey, at Trenton and Princeton, at Morristown, Brandywine, Germantown and Monmouth! We trembled, and rejoiced; but he preserved a stea∣dy firmness. Threats could not intimidate, filthy lucre could not bribe him. He was brave in danger, and compassionate to the sons of dis∣tress. Prosperity did not make him arrogant, nor did he sink under adversity. Even in the darkest hour, when a general despondency ho∣vered over the public mind, and thousands were ready to give up the cause as lost, self-collected and self-possessed, he remained unmoved. And when resources sailed, retiring within himself, his ingenuity seemed to supply all defects, and his presence inspired heroic ardour.</P>
<P>DEFENCE, and not conquest, was his object. To effect that, and not sacrifice life, was his am∣bition. For him it was therefore reserved to teach the world the defensive art of war, refined upon principles of humanity: the true art of maneuvring and reconnoitring so dexterously, though sometimes reduced to a little band, as to frustrate the enemy's subtlest schemes, without hazarding an engagement: the secret art of im∣proving the favourable moment, and captivating
<PB N="11" REF="038972_0010_101239AF030A5200"/>
whole armies, without deluging the land in blood. How many more have fallen in a single battle in Europe, than fell during the whole American contest!</P>
<P>NO General ever more entirely possessed the affections of his army. To this happy circum∣stance it is to be attributed, that at a very criti∣cal juncture, when their engagements were ex∣piring, and the enemy, flushed with high expec∣tations, were anticipating triumph, at his anima∣ted and pathetic <HI>request,</HI> they maintained their posts, though in a destitute situation, and sur∣rounded with extreme difficulties. The snow, crimsoned by their footsteps, witnessed their rea∣diness to attend him to victory, or to death.</P>
<P>THROUGH a severe struggle for liberty, this great DEFENDER of his country astonished his enemies by the regular discipline which he esta∣blished and maintained, by his judicious arrange∣ments, and by his consummate skill in evading, and vigorous exertions in the hour of battle. His heart, his tongue, his pen, his sword, were all employed. Convinced at length of the im∣practicability of subduing the free-born sons of America, the PARENT COUNTRY gave up the con∣test, and the glorious peace of 1783 succeeded. WASHINGTON conquered, and a nation was born. Blessed with peace and independence,
<PB N="12" REF="038972_0011_101239B19922E020"/>
from St. Croix to the remotest boundaries of Georgia, United America proclaimed his praise.</P>
<P>THE great end of the military establishment was no sooner obtained, than to <HI>disband the army</HI> became an important object. Having gloriously accomplished their arduous work, they expect∣ed compensation for their labours and sufferings. Gladly would CONGRESS have discharged all ar∣rears; but the state of the <HI>national finances</HI> render∣ed it impossible. Discontents arose, became alarming, and perhaps had embroiled the YOUNG REPUBLIC in <HI>civil war,</HI> had not their beloved GENERAL, by a spirited, <HI>patriotic Address,</HI> calmed their minds, and prevailed with them to return peaceably to their respective homes. But, VIR∣TUOUS PATRIOT! having at every stage of the war paid a sacred deference to the <HI>civil authority,</HI> he would not at its close have his arms disgraced by rising in opposition to it.</P>
<P>THE freedom and sovereignty of his country being established, the triumphant WASHING∣TON, December 23d, 1783, cheerfully resigned his <HI>conquering sword,</HI> and with it his <HI>high commission,</HI> to the NATIONAL COUNCIL. The same day he filled the first military station, and voluntarily took the rank of a common citizen. What <HI>sub∣lime patriotism!</HI> what <HI>august magnanimity!</HI> Then, amidst the congratulations and blessings of a renovated nation, he retired to his delightful
<PB N="13" REF="038972_0012_101239B3440E6420"/>
MOUNT VERNON, to participate the tranquillity and happiness of domestic life.</P>
<P>HERE he consummated one career of glory, quitted the field with unspotted fame, and im∣mortalized his character.</P>
<P>UNITED AMERICA felt her SOVEREIGNTY, and rose at once to high respectability on the list of nations. The sun of republican glory shone with full-orbed rays. Our political horizon was clear, and the prospect bright and promising. But, alas! soon the clouds began to gather, and a tempest to arise.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Confederation,</HI> that recommendatory form of government, which proved sufficient during the war, while the enthusiastic spirit of liberty prevailed, was found to want energy in a time of peace. Through the influence of designing men, in 1786, a <HI>rebellion</HI> was fomented in the western part of this State, which threatened to involve the Union in war. Alarmed at the situ∣ation of the country, a <HI>Convention</HI> was formed in 1787, for the general purpose of consulting the public good. Here the wisdom of a WASH∣INGTON was required. He was accordingly chosen one of the members, and accepted their invitation to preside. After four months' deli∣beration, our most excellent FEDERAL CONSTI∣TUTION
<PB N="14" REF="038972_0013_101239B6F9C22200"/>
was completed; and, being sanctioned by his approbation, it was ratified by the people</P>
<P>WHEN that new system came into operation, who so worthy to be the <HI>Supreme Executive Magis∣trate,</HI> as the MAN who had defended and saved his devoted country? WASHINGTON, with∣out a dissenting voice, was elected PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. To him the call of his country was the call of Heaven. Though independent in his circumstances, he relinquished the charms of rural retreat for the cares and burdens of high <HI>responsibility.</HI> April 30th, 1789, he was inaugurated at New York; and with a modest dignity peculiar to himself ascen∣ded the <HI>Chair of State.</HI></P>
<P>THE ensuing autumn he favoured these Eas∣tern States with a paternal, circular visit. What heart-felt satisfaction it afforded, their unfeigned testimonials evinced.</P>
<P>WITH him at the head of its <HI>Supreme Council,</HI> the nation was happy. Political dissensions sub∣sided, and general prosperity smiled. At the periodical election, the united suffrages of a free and enlightened people continued him in that ex∣alted station. Had it not been for the restless savages of the wilderness, and the intrigues of foreign emissaries, and internal foes, our national tranquillity had been uninterrupted: but from
<PB N="15" REF="038972_0014_101239B8A4A604E0"/>
these sources originated a complication of evils. To HIS vigilance, wise moderation, and pacific disposition, we are greatly obligated for averting the impending judgments. Uniting the arm of power with the voice of clemency, he concluded an <HI>honourable peace</HI> with the Indian tribes. When, at the instigation of the enemies of government, a <HI>formidable insurrection</HI> arose in the state of Penn∣sylvania, mingling mercy and energy, he taught succeeding ages how to quell a tumult. By an early declaration of <HI>neutrality,</HI> he happily pre∣vented America being involved in the wars of Europe. When the subtle, intriguing, systema∣tic Genet and his accomplices were unwearied in their endeavours to divide the people from their government, and precipitate hostilities with Great-Britain, his <HI>conciliatory measures</HI> frustrated their machiavelian policy. And when an attempt was made by the national LEGISLATIVE to en∣croach on the EXECUTIVE branch of government, he boldly interposed, and preserved the <HI>balance</HI> between the constitutional powers.</P>
<P>PATRIOTISM seemed the ruling passion of his soul. A single eye to America's true interest influenced all his foreign intercourse and negotia∣tions, and indeed the whole of his administration. No lucrative motives, no party spirit, no bigot∣ed zeal, perverted his judgment. The <HI>scales of justice</HI> he poised with even hand. And knowing
<PB N="16" REF="038972_0015_101239BB5B7E8360"/>
the importance of good morals and examples to the community, he paid attention to true dignity of character as a recommendatory qualification for promotion.</P>
<P>EIGHT years he shone in the first seat of government, the admiration of other nations, the glory of his own; till the political ferment was allayed, and by the smiles of Heaven he saw America the happiest of all countries, the land of rational liberty, the seat of science, and every order of citizens enjoying unprecedented pros∣perity. There no doubt he had continued to shine, had he not declined <HI>a re-election.</HI> But, advanced in years, and no pressing necessity de∣manding his public labours, he chose to retire again to the pleasing walks of private life, to share in common with his countrymen the advan∣tages of that government, which he had been so successful in establishing. Crowned with the double thanks and blessings of all ranks, his favourite rural seat welcomed his return. There he contemplated spending the evening of life in peace, without the most distant thought of ever being called to office again.</P>
<P>BUT this PATRIOTIC FATHER would not withdraw from public life, without bequeathing his country an invaluable legacy, in his VALE∣DICTORY ADDRESS. There stands recorded a system of principles and precepts, worthy to be inscribed on every American heart; a <HI>system,</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="038972_0016_101239BD16108388"/>
which, duly regarded, must terminate in the consummation of republican glory.</P>
<P>THUS he exemplified the ACCOMPLISHED STATESMAN, as illustriously as he had before the INVINCIBLE HERO.</P>
<P>AT the peaceful close of his wise administra∣tion, how natural to expect prosperous and <HI>happy days!</HI> But oh! the mutability and uncer∣tainty of all human affairs! No sooner had he begun to enjoy retirement, than the distracted state of European politics alarmed the world; and the hostile proceedings of the DIRECTORY of France endangered the peace and independence of America. To support her dignity, military preparations by land, as well as an armed neutrality at sea, became necessary. On the VENERABLE WASHINGTON all hearts were fixed, to take the charge of the army. One grade more of glory awaited him. He was accordingly the second time, with perfect unani∣mity, appointed to the chief military command in 1798. Patriotism glowed too fervently in his heart, to decline acceptance. To his honour be it recorded, his <HI>commission</HI> he received from his SUCCESSOR IN OFFICE. Though grown old in serving his country, this mighty Chieftain was ready to spend his last breath in her cause. A general joy announced his welcome to office, and
<PB N="18" REF="038972_0017_10123631E7000628"/>
martial fire began to kindle. With such a GENERAL, who but pronounced American arms invincible? Had necessity called him to the field, every patriotic heart and every resource had been at his command. While his name, more mighty than a host, had struck ter∣ror through the boldest enemy, how must it have inspired the brave sons of liberty with redoubled heroism!—But here, alas! here closes one of the most endeared and valuable of lives. Gods on earth die like men. WASHINGTON himself must die. And he died the same GREAT MAN he lived. This high office he honoured, when the SUPREME LORD OF LIFE issued his higher orders. Readily he obeyed; and, December the 14th, 1799, with∣out a groan, "<HI>closed his own eyes, and died.</HI>"</P>
<P>AND has his <HI>great mind</HI> fled? Does he rank no more on the list of frail mortals? Will he no longer guide our public councils, no more lead on our armies to victory? Heaven has so de∣creed. What mingled emotions struggle in our hearts! His mourning country thinks no tokens of honour too much to confer on his memory. The world resounds with his praises. Genera∣tions to come will rise up in succession, and call him blessed.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>greatly beloved</HI> of men was likewise an object of special divine guardianship. Numerous
<PB N="19" REF="038972_0018_101239C3E5159760"/>
were the imminent dangers he escaped, and sig∣nal the deliverances he experienced. His God not only nerved his arm, but covered his head in the day of battle. In devout acknowledgment for his providential preservation, it is worthy of remark, that in "June, 1776, a plot was medi∣tated, under the direction of Gov. Tryon," and "managed by the then Mayor" of New-York, to take away General WASHINGTON'S life, "either by poison or assassination; and Thomas Hickey, one of his life-guard, was engaged in it." But the conspiracy was seasonably discovered, and he "was tried by a court martial, found guilty, and executed." Heaven protects her favourites!</P>
<P>WASHINGTON is a name that will always bear superior rank in the temple of fame. Should we contrast his merits with the warriors, sages and politicians of former or present times, he would but gather brilliancy from their de∣fects. View him at the head of a small, unexpe∣rienced, fluctuating army, labouring under almost every embarrassment, and yet maintaining his cause against one of the most powerful nations of the earth; and how diminutively does Xerxes appear, though he commanded the greatest milita∣ry force that ever marched into the field! how des∣picable all the ancient conquerors of the world! Their victories only added to the miseries of
<PB N="20" REF="038972_0019_101239C59DF1DCF0"/>
mankind. And what are the modern leaders of armies in Europe? That once happy land, they have converted into a field of blood.—When opposed to the wise men of Greece and Rome, his lustre obscures their feeble rays.—And should we look into the moral and political systems of antiquity, how imperfect were all the productions of Hermes, Minos and Lycurgus, of Numa, So∣lon and Confucius, in compare with his morals and politics? And who in latter days will boast a competition with him? If ever he was equal∣led, it must be by <HI>Moses,</HI> the <HI>Jewish Lawgiver.</HI> He was confessedly under divine inspiration, and we would be spared an invidious comparison of merits: but all must acknowledge, that in many respects there is a striking resemblance between these two great national DELIVERERS and SA∣VIOURS.</P>
<P>ILLUSTRIOUS characters are too often shaded with some gross mistakes, or stained by flagrant vices: but WASHINGTON'S will ever stand on record, a brilliant exception. Through all the vicissitudes of war and peace, nothing occur∣red to eclipse his increasing glory, or fully his reputation. Every new sphere of action gained him a fresh wreath of laurels.—Not the most <HI>perfect virtue</HI> indeed is security against the enve∣nomed tongue of slander. There was a time
<PB N="21" REF="038972_0020_101239C753F16090"/>
when groundless jealousy, or party rage, wished to depose him, and the pen of infamy attacked his measures: but his uniform wisdom, virtue and fidelity confounded their madness and folly. Neither malice nor envy could support the sha∣dow of a charge against him. He had no ene∣mies but the enemies of his country and good government; and their defamation was public fame.</P>
<P>TO these general strokes we would add that <HI>disinterested benevolence,</HI> which graced his public character. Through the whole revolutionary scenes, both as GENERAL and PRESIDENT, his generous heart declined all personal compensa∣tion for services. His vast fortune superseded all necessity; and a consciousness of promoting the general welfare was itself ample satisfaction. Where in the annals of history shall we trace such <HI>exalted generosity,</HI> such <HI>patriotic philanthropy!— Love of fame,</HI> it is granted, has wrought wonders. But no man ever appeared to be less under the influence of this passion. Besides, had this been his motive, after finishing so glorious a military life, who at such a crisis would have hazarded the uncertain issue of another probation?</P>
<P>THE field he did not enter to conquer territo∣ry, to destroy his enemies, or to acquire renown; nor did he accept the reins of government to
<PB N="22" REF="038972_0021_101239C9C283A570"/>
gratify ambition, and soar in grandeur: but he united the PATRIOT and HERO, to oppose tyran∣ny, to guard COLUMBIA's birthright, and trans∣mit to posterity the liberties GOD and nature gave. Her cause he vindicated upon such gene∣ral principles, as involve the prerogatives of hu∣man nature. He is therefore justly entitled to the high appellation of the ASSERTOR of natural rights, the DEFENDER of liberty, the SUPPORTER of a free government, and the FRIEND of man.</P>
<P>WHILE we dwell on such <HI>lovely greatness,</HI> how does the afflicting thought return and melt our hearts—<HI>HE sleeps in dust!</HI> But though dead, he still <HI>lives.</HI> He lives in medals and statues, in monuments and portraits, in the song of poets, and page of history; but, to nobler purpose, in virtuous example and in the affections of grateful millions. Nor does he only live; HE speaks, and will bless mankind to the remotest ages, in his admirable "<HI>system of political morality,</HI>" equally celebrated for sublimity of sentiment, and ele∣gance of style.</P>
<P>THIS first of HEROES and PATRIOTS was ad∣vanced to the highest stations UNITED AMERICA afforded, and he dignified every office he sustain∣ed. But he did not figure only in the field and the cabinet; his <HI>personal virtues</HI> were as amia∣ble as his <HI>public</HI> were illustrious.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="038972_0022_101239CC1B00CBC8"/>FROM the noisy <HI>parade</HI> of war, and dazzling <HI>splendour</HI> of court equipage, let us retire to <HI>Mount Vernon,</HI> and contemplate WASHINGTON as a PRIVATE CITIZEN.</P>
<P>VIEWED in the <HI>occupation</HI> of a husbandman, all was neat, elegant, and on an extensive and useful plan. Probably not a man in the Union exceed∣ed him in a landed interest, or made more judi∣cious observations and arrangements. Agricul∣ture was his delightful business; and improve∣ment in this honourable branch of living, he con∣sidered as an important object. His attention of course was turned to the different qualities of soil, and the best manner and means of cultiva∣tion. The knowledge he obtained in this art, he readily communicated, and recommended fre∣quent and diversified experiments, as the only way to carry it to perfection. As a <HI>man,</HI> he was a pattern of meekness, temperance, sobriety and benevolence, invariably acting upon the genuine principles of truth, honour and righteousness. As the <HI>head of a family,</HI> he maintained regularity and due subordination, mingling economy with liberal hospitality. As a <HI>husband,</HI> he was kind, tender and affectionate. As a <HI>father,</HI> he had no children but the patrons of virtue and liberty, and these he defended and nurtured at the ha∣zard of his life and property. As a <HI>master,</HI> his humanity and reasonable commands engaged the
<PB N="24" REF="038972_0023_101239CE81F5B968"/>
love and obedience of his servants. As a <HI>neigh∣bour,</HI> he was peaceable, obliging, and abounded in acts and offices of kindness. As a <HI>friend,</HI> he was sincere, faithful and confidential. As a <HI>bene∣factor to the poor,</HI> he manifested a tender heart, and flowing generosity. As a <HI>member of society,</HI> he con∣sulted not his own separate interest, but the com∣mon good. As <HI>one of the community,</HI> he was an ex∣emplary subject, public spirited, and punctually conformed to the laws of the land. In a word, his <HI>heart</HI> appeared a seat of the virtues; and his <HI>manners</HI> displayed a noble simplicity, and graceful dignity, in the <HI>true republican taste.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the <HI>crown</HI> of all his glory was his PIETY. WASHINGTON was a CHRISTIAN—a profes∣sed friend to christianity. With all his great∣ness, he did not disdain to be accounted the hum∣ble disciple of a CRUCIFIED NAZARENE: and his life was a practical comment on the power of re∣ligion. A divine providence he acknowledged in all his successes, and gave the glory to GOD. Stated seasons of retirement for devotion he was known daily to observe. The christian sabbath he strictly regarded, and practised attendance on public worship. Divine institutions were sacred in his esteem, and he was a <HI>communicant</HI> at the LORD'S TABLE. Educated in the <HI>Episcopal Church,</HI> he retained that form of worship; but extended candour and liberality of sentiment to the virtu∣ous
<PB N="25" REF="038972_0024_101239D0D669CEE8"/>
and good of every nation and religion. Thus by his exemplary life he discountenanced athe∣ism, infidelity, and all immoralities; and recom∣mended the practice of virtue and piety to the world.</P>
<P>THIS is the man whose <HI>birth</HI> we this day commemorate, and whose <HI>death</HI> we mourn. He was <HI>great</HI> without ostentation, and <HI>good</HI> without superstition.—Should it be said, So <HI>exalted a character</HI> speaks something more than man, I would reply, It rather proclaims the <HI>true dignity of man,</HI> as it unites real goodness to true greatness, and proves that human virtue may be greatly sublimated and refined. What is not our nature capable of exemplifying? It may sink into the lowest depths of vice and wretchedness, or it may rise to eminent attainments in moral good∣ness. —To deny him the imperfections of hu∣manity, would create a just suspicion that all was but empty panegyric, and a piece of state policy. By universal consent, he is entitled to one of the greatest and best of human characters; but his <HI>modesty</HI> would blush, and his <HI>piety,</HI> even in heaven, be shocked, could he know he was styled on earth <HI>more</HI> than man.</P>
<P>WE would not detract from the honours due to a vigorous and persevering CONGRESS, and to a brave and determined ARMY; nor depreciate the abilities and merits of his CO-PATRIOTS and
<PB N="26" REF="038972_0025_101239D3382732C8"/>
HEROES. They did worthily; and procured to themselves immortal fame. The pen of histo∣ry will do justice to their memories. But it never wounded their most <HI>delicate sensibilities</HI> to yield up the palm to WASHINGTON.</P>
<P>WHILE we eulogize talents so great, virtues so resplendent, and deeds so noble, let it not be thought too foreign from the present solemnity, to moralize the instructive theme. FRIENDS OF RELIGION! Let not our grief prevent devout effusions of gratitude to Heaven, for raising up this great DELIVERER of the oppressed, and GUARDIAN OF LIBERTY. Surely it was because GOD had a favour for our land, that he capaci∣tated him for such a great part in life, and brought him upon the stage at the critical period of public exigency. <HI>Divine Providence</HI> stands con∣fessed in the union of all hearts in him, in the wisdom and valour which marked all his pro∣ceedings, and in the success attending them. He was a great instrument in the hand of God of our national independence and prosperity; and never perhaps was more glory due to one man. But it is no disparagement to his worth to look beyond all secondary causes, and ascribe supreme glory to the GREAT OVERRULING POWER.</P>
<P>RELIGION teaches us likewise to attend to the providence of GOD, in the time and manner of
<PB N="27" REF="038972_0026_101239D590D88FA0"/>
his departure. He was not cut down at an early age, nor in the midst of his days; but he filled up a long life of service and glory. And he di∣ed, not by treachery and artifice under cover of friendship, as Abner fell; not by an open enemy, as sons of valour often prematurely fall; nor by his own hand, in a paroxysm of despair, as blood-thirsty conquerors sometimes ignominiously die: but, as frail humanity is ordinarily doomed to close life, by <HI>natural disease.</HI> HE blessed his coun∣try, and died in peace, on <HI>a bed of virtue and ho∣nour,</HI> surrounded with his dearest connexions and friends—And where else would a <HI>good man</HI> wish to die?</P>
<P>THE disorder which <HI>Heaven</HI> commissioned over his life was an inflammation of the throat; in technical style, "<HI>Cynache Trachealis.</HI>" Sudden in∣deed and violent was the attack, as if the King of Terrors was conscious of some mighty task, jealous of his superior power or policy, and un∣willing his dear country should have opportunity to raise one petition for his life.—Was it then reserved for this <HI>grim Tyrant</HI> of our race to con∣quer so much greatness? No. Such honour was too great. It was not death, but WASHING∣TON, who conquered. His last and greatest victory was over the fear of death. His triumph he sung, when, with entire composure and resig∣nation, he proclaimed, in the audience of weep∣ing friends, "I HAVE NO FEAR TO DIE."</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="038972_0027_101239D8016CA790"/>HAVING lived his day, and faithfully perform∣ed the great work assigned him, acquiescing in the divine will, he consigned his weary limbs to the peaceful tomb, where his conquering LORD and Master lay; there to sleep, till he should come again, and clothe them with a glorious immortality. His GREAT SOUL we contemplate removed to higher spheres, and nobler scenes of action; not destined to join the Caligulas, the Neros, the Robespierres; but advanced to the highest rank of worthies in the pure realms of peace and glory. May a double portion of his excellent spirit ever rest on his successors in office!</P>
<P>HEIRS OF MORTALITY! With what pathetic energy does WASHINGTON's death preach to America and the world, a serious lecture on hu∣man frailty! "Dust to dust," is the common doom of our fallen nature. In every age, phi∣losophers, politicians and warriors have come upon the stage, acted their parts, and then retired. Distinctions of birth, of rank and fortune, per∣sonal accomplishments and mighty achievements, avail not here. The great, the good, and <HI>all,</HI> must die. Who can dwell on so much <HI>greatness laid in dust,</HI> and not self-appropriate the solemn scene? <HI>To be prepared,</HI> comprehends the whole duty of life. "Cease from man," and feel your dependence on God.</P>
<P>REPUBLICAN CITIZENS! Virtue is the stabi∣lity of our government, and good examples are
<PB N="29" REF="038972_0028_101239DA9337C8D8"/>
replete with moral instruction. Insensibly they charm the heart, and possess a constraining influ∣ence over the life. The <HI>Christian Exemplar</HI> alone is perfect, and worthy to be our <HI>supreme standard:</HI> but what we justly admire and esteem in others, deserves our imitation. And where shall we find a fairer, brighter, or more excellent human pattern, than the life of WASHINGTON? It comprises a rich assemblage of public and private virtues, accommodated to the highest and lowest walks of life. Formed upon the <HI>true sublime,</HI> it commands universal admiration. MAY WASH∣INGTON BE THE MODEL OF OUR NATIONAL CHARACTER!</P>
<P>AMERICAN YOUTH! To fire your ambition, and excite a virtuous emulation, we would hold him up to your view. Would you shun the vi∣ces and follies of your age? would you rise to eminence in your day, and prove blessings to your country and the world? would you rejoice the hearts of your friends? would you be wise and good, great and happy? would you live esteem∣ed, and die lamented? Follow his amiable and virtuous example. Remember his paternal ad∣vice. Imbibe his republican principles; and let his <HI>precious legacy</HI> be your <HI>political oracle.</HI> When to you it falls to guide the helm of state, make that your <HI>pole star</HI> and <HI>compass.</HI> He lived not for himself only, but for you and posterity after you, for America and the human race.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="038972_0029_101239DDC1B66290"/>SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF LIBERTY! Behold a revolutionizing world! Under the ostensible colour of freedom, fraternity and the rights of man, desolation and slaughter are displayed amongst the ancient nations of Europe, on such a sanguinary scale of terror, as makes all the fine feelings of humanity shudder, remonstrate and agonize. See there, attempts, at once to subvert all religion and government. View the human heart unprincipled, and mechanically petrified. Thanks to Heaven! you are blessed with a hap∣pier lot, than to inhabit climes unfriendly to vir∣tue. You are no degraded race of bondmen and vassals. United America is the land of peace and enjoyment. Here you realize the sweets of li∣berty, and refined society. No country ever presented prospects more favourable to posterity. But, reflect and consider how much you are in∣debted to WASHINGTON for your distinguish∣ed privileges; and, while all parties mingle tears at his departure, let his name serve as a talis∣man, and prove an indissoluble bond of union to all.</P>
<P>FRIENDS OF PEACE AND GOOD GOVERNMENT! Could this GREAT FATHER of liberty witness the solemnities of this day, and address us from the abodes of immortality, with AMERICA still engraven on his heart, would he not, with more than mortal eloquence, sanction his former coun∣sels, enjoining a charge, on all her citizens, con∣taining
<PB N="31" REF="038972_0030_101239DF648ABC80"/>
sentiments like these? Banish forever from your public counsels and your hearts, all party spirit, and all disorganizing and demoraliz∣ing principles. Watch with eagle-eye against encroachments on your rights and privileges, as men and christians; but never indulge unreason∣able jealousies of the rulers of your own choice. Keep your elections free and uncorrupted. Sup∣port public credit, and the dignity of your Fe∣deral and State Governments. Promote literary institutions, agriculture and manufactures. Pre∣serve national faith and justice. Encourage in∣dustry, frugality and improvements. Guard against foreign influence and intrigue, and all un∣due national attachments and antipathies. Ne∣ver be entangled in the politics of foreign pow∣ers. Cultivate harmony and commercial inter∣course with all the world, upon the great prin∣ciples of truth and righteousness. Study peace with all nations: but be, at all times, prepared for war. Let your union be perpetual. And remember, RELIGION and MORALITY are the foundation of national greatness, as well as of personal excellence. Practise therefore the mo∣ral and social virtues, and live up to the true spirit of christianity.—This is the best eulogy you can pronounce on my memory, the surest evi∣dence of gratitude and affection. Thus you will secure the blessing of Heaven, and always sustain the rank of a great and free, a respected and happy nation.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="038972_0031_101239E172591960"/>FELLOW CITIZENS! Affection delights to dwell on departed friends and benefactors. There is a consolation, a luxury, in tears. How then shall we close the affecting theme! Must CO∣LUMBIA be inconsolable? Shall the tide of grief forever flow! This would in effect impeach the ways of Providence. Surely what God does must be right; and resignation to his will is a duty. Though WASHINGTON is not, it is enough HIS GOD never dies. Thanks to his name! ADAMS and a large catalogue of worthies still live. Never yet has this highly-favoured land wanted for <HI>patriotic fathers</HI> and <HI>martial sons.</HI> With our plaintive strains let us mingle fervent supplications, that he would still remember in mercy his American Israel, and raise up a per∣petual succession of illustrious STATESMEN and HEROES. O THOU SUPREME DISPOSER of nations, states and kingdoms! ever keep UNITED AMERICA under thy special protection. Be "a wall of fire round about," and the "glory in the midst" of her. May her <HI>politics</HI> be always sound, her <HI>morals</HI> pure, her <HI>greatness</HI> increasing. And may she never want for WASHINGTONS to direct her councils and command her armies, "till sun and moon, and time and death, shall be no more."</P>
