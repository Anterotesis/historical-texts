<BIBL>II SAMUEL, i. 27.</BIBL>
<Q>HOW ARE THE MIGHTY FALLEN, AND THE WEAPONS OF WAR PERISHED!</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>FROM a very ancient date in the history of human affairs, mankind have been in the practice of celebrating by words or more substantial monuments, the virtues and heroic exploits of the dead. In republican governments especially, the funeral oration has been rarely omitted, in the case of the more conspicuous, deserving citizen. The Grecian states, early commenced the usage: Rome followed their example, not only through the period of her greater glory, but down nearly to that of her lowest decline;—the more recent revival of letters and social improvement, having by no means discon∣tinued the whole of the kind. Doing justice to the memory of departed worth, has much to be said in its favour. A rich source of pleasing emotion to the feeling grateful heart it cannot fail to operate powerfully upon sur∣vivers, to study the careful imitation of what they so much delight to extol.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="038576_0005_101296273515D030"/>
BUT with the public celebration of deceas∣ed merit, thus strongly recommended <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> dif∣ferent grounds; it admits and no doubt often experiences gross abuse. The high wrought encomium of our text and its im∣mediate connection, is perhaps not so perfectly deserved as could be wished. Saul and his son Jonathan were its subjects, scarcely any thing being to be said to the advantage of the form∣er, but that he was "the Lord's anointed" and the latter a mere youth, of whom, the most that we know is, that he was personally brave and the possessor of an unusually friend∣ly heart. Over these two persons it was, that David gave utterance to his grief, in that beau∣tiful lamentation, of which the Text is a part. It is a lamentation, which does honor, both to the talents and feelings of its author. It has deservedly immortalized <HI>him,</HI> as a man who knew how to forgive injuries, and whose at∣tachment to his friend, was without duplicity and persevering.</P>
<P>"And David lamented with this lamenta∣tion over Saul, and over Jonathan his son. The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places; how are the mighty fallen! Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Aske∣lon: left the daughters of the Philistines re∣joice, left the daughters of the uncircumcis∣ed
<PB N="7" REF="038576_0006_10129628CC4DA880"/>
triumph. Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil. From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jona∣than turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty. Saul and Jonathan, were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they they were not divided; they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions. Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel. How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places. I am distress∣ed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very plea∣sant hast thou been unto me; thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women—<HI>How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!"</HI></P>
<P>WITHOUT farther discussing the question, whether this <HI>high eulogy</HI> was a matter of strict desert, in view of those who were originally its subjects; of this I am confident, that it has been deserved in the case of others. It shall accordingly be the twofold object of the re∣maining part of the present discourse; to de∣lineate
<PB N="8" REF="038576_0007_1012962D04787C48"/>
the character, which abundantly au¦thorizes those strains of commendation which the text expresses, and afterwards improve what may be thus offered, in a few practical in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erences.</P>
<P>IN delineating the character worthy of high commendation, and of course to be universal∣ly and deeply lamented, at his death:—I shall begin with mentioning the one, who has de∣served well, in <HI>military</HI> office. It being the disastrous fate of the warrior, which dictated the passage we are now reviewing, naturally gives the lead to the present remark. In thus holding to view military skill and exertion as ranking among the virtues of life, far be it from me to stand forth an approver, of a very large proportion of those, who have shone and and acquired eminence of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame, in such a de∣partment. <HI>Ambitious murderers—expert assa∣ssins—unfeeling incendiaries</HI>—are rather op∣probrious names, which by no means do justice to their real guilt and infamy. A scourge to the world, humanity execrates and divine justic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> will assuredly punish them. It is not to me¦liorate the circumstances of life, but to punish and reclaim from sin, that God permits them upon earth.</P>
<P>BUT with the warrior thus an object o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> deserved execration;—he may be and fre¦quently
<PB N="9" REF="038576_0008_1012963106006080"/>
is, one of heavens richest blessings to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nkind. Hence the address of God, to Cyrus, a man deservedly celebrated, both in sacred and profane history. "Thus saith the Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings to open before him the two-leaved gates, and the gates shall not be shut. I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight; I will brake in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron. For Jacob my servants sake and Israel mine elect, I have even called thee by thy name: I have sirnamed thee, though thou hast not known me. I am the Lord, and there is none else, there is no God beside me; I girded thee, though thou hast not known me: That they may know from the rising of the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, and from the west, that there is none be∣side me, I am the Lord, and there is none else"—So long as that spirit of national injustice and aggression continues in the world, of which no past period has been wholly free, defen∣sive war will be necessary and altogether justifiable;—of course those skilful to wield the sword, are deservedly to be held in high esteem, by their brethren. Without them the inherent rights of human nature are in∣stantly prostrate, property devastated or whol∣ly
<PB N="10" REF="038576_0009_10129632982D3968"/>
taken away, the family sanctuary made a place of lawless intrusion, and even the sanc∣tuary of the great Jehovah, with all its religious institutions and solemnities, tram∣pled under foot; thus verifying, what David long since complained of;—and indeed, which various parts of our own country, not many years past, exemplified. "They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground. They said in their hearts, let us destroy them together. We see not our signs, there is no more any prophet, neither is there among us any that knoweth how long. O God, how long shall the adversary re∣proach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?" As must be a matter universally conced∣ed, the man of war, who under God, is made the instrument of alleviating and ultimately re∣dressing such a truly unwelcome state of things, deserves at his death undissembled and univer∣sal lamentation.</P>
<P>AGAIN, we are abundantly authorized to lament the man, who has shone as a disinter∣ested statesman.—To be great in war and to be great in peace, require very different attri∣butes of character, seldom united. Of the two▪ it is much less difficult to defend a country a∣gainst hostile attacks from abroad, than to re∣gulate
<PB N="11" REF="038576_0010_10129635640F75E8"/>
its internal civil concerns with propri∣ety, amid the jarring feelings and opposite in∣erests of millions. Of all departments of ad∣ministration, that of the republican chief ma∣gistrate, is far the most critical and arduous. To be the successful and approved helmsman of a nation, requires a vast combination of foresight, energy, and perseverance, rarely the lot of mortals. The fatigue and anxiety of such an office, must be incalculable.—To keep in order the complicated wheels of national government, is a laborious un∣dertaking; though a far greater one, to put them first in motion. It is beyond the reach of wealth, to compensate adequately such a task;—how truly noble then to do it with∣out the smallest pecuniary reward, as the re∣sult, of pure love of country. Certainly the able statesman, uncompensated unless by a consciousness of doing good, fully merits the rich tribute, of being held in the grateful re∣membrance, of his surviving cotemporaries and posterity.</P>
<P>How worthy also, to be lamented is the man who has unvaryingly displayed, unshaken at∣tachment to the constitution and laws of his country.—Convinced of the true construction to be put, upon the great <HI>palladium</HI> of nation∣al existence and liberty, in this or the other of its articles; nothing is able to make him depart from it, in the smallest degree. Amid
<PB N="12" REF="038576_0011_1012963830C8EFF8"/>
the risk of popularity, the collision of parties, the solicitations of the crafty, and the invectives of disapointed ambition; he remains immove∣able—tenaciously fixed on what he conceives to be right. Truly difficult as it many times is, for the supreme head of a nation, to avoid the imputation of obstinacy, while pursuing the-line of rational manly firmness; still it is a line, for which he will never fail, most industri∣ously to aim. Feeling the justice of the in∣spired remark "that in a multitude of coun∣sellors, there is safety" he listens to the whole which can be said; tho not without afterwads, both thinking and acting for himself. Far greater confidence may be safely reposed in such a man, than in one, who while he en∣deavours to please all, is very certain of hav∣ing his administration but too exactly answer to an apostles pointed description "for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, driven of the wind and tossed—for let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord."</P>
<P>FURTHER, how deserving of lamentation at his death is the one, who while engaged in public life, shewed himself superior to the van∣ity of adulation, and the seducements of am∣bition.—The conquest of self in such re∣spects, is far the greatest conquest, which hu∣man nature is able to achieve. To continue
<PB N="13" REF="038576_0012_10122AC69B58BF68"/>
the humble man amid the unqualified applauses of millions, and that not barely for a day but for years, shews self-command—displays greatness of soul, next to divine. Thus made conscious of acting a noble part and deserving well; the pleasure thence resulting, does not stand confined to the narrow limits of a selfish heart, but diffuses itself abroad—ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lts in the idea of national peace and improvement, aggrandizement and felicity.—The per∣son whose feelings and views are of the sup∣posed benevolent cast, with entire cheerfulness, quits the pinnacle of high elevation, the first moment circumstances will allow. It was not to be made great, but to do great good, that he consented to rise; of course it being the first object of his wishes, again to enjoy a peace∣ful and dignified retirement. How truly for∣tunate would it be for the world, did the in∣vestiture with extensive authority, in all instan∣ces, do so little to deprave the heart—that in the place of retaining power, for the purpose of enslaving and making miserable; it was relinquished with equal or greater satisfaction, than what it was originally received.</P>
<P>ONCE more, worthy indeed to be lament∣ed is the man, whose private life has been a continued series of beneficence, unstained by vice, and who witnessed a sacred regard to the truth and power of religion. How compara∣tively
<PB N="14" REF="038576_0013_1012963C39B168C0"/>
contemptible are the most brilliant per∣sonal qualities, with all the adventitious celebri∣ty which an elevated department for action, can give to them, unaccompanied by a moral con∣versation and the true fear of God. With vir∣tuous principles and practices, the essence of real dignity in the obscure citizen; they are inconceivably more commanding and useful, when the attribute of high life. The great man, who manifests reverence for religion and its institutions, demonstrates his full con∣viction of their reality and importance. He shews himself superior to the splendid tempta∣tions of a seducing world, and proclaims aloud to his fellow worms "that there is one thing needful; a good part which shall not be taken away."</P>
<P>I have now detailed, with designed brevity, a few leading features of character which more than authorize—which peremptorily enjoin, the most feeling lamentation. They are features of character, which authorize and enjoin lamen∣tation when found singly; how much more when combined, and forming one vast mass, of human excellence and worth.</P>
<P>As I am sure is needless to inform you, my Brethren, the past remarks are by no means those, of the mere <HI>speculatist.</HI>—They are not the produce of imagination, but have been penned from <HI>actual life.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="038576_0014_1012963DD0CA2820"/>
O WASHINGTON! thou great and good—thou friend of God and man, I can suppress thy beloved name, no longer. <HI>Rich</HI> in years—<HI>rich</HI> in desert—<HI>rich</HI> in every virtue—<HI>rich</HI> in the esteem of thy country and the world, thou art now shrouded in the tomb;—<HI>and thy place shall know thee no more."</HI></P>
<P>"How are the mighty fallen, and the wea∣pons of war perished."</P>
<P>A few inferences, may now close the pre∣sent attempt.</P>
<P>IN view of what has been offered, how clearly are we taught—how forceably have we urged upon us, the idea of a future immortal existence. It cannot be, that so much innate worth—such complicated desert of charac∣ter—and unfeigned fear of the great Jehovah, as marked the man we this day lament, should perish in the grave. No, my Brethren, the most glorious triumph of our departed Hero and Father, is yet to arrive. "So when this corruption shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory."</P>
<P>OUR subject also, impressively urges upon us, to cultivate a spirit of humble submission
<PB N="16" REF="038576_0015_10129640F18D0348"/>
to God's holy unerring providence. The cup of national judgement put into our hands to drink, is indeed very bitter; tho' let it not be forgotten, that it possesses an intermixture of sweetness. Our tears ought to a degree, to be those of gratitude—gratitude that kind heaven saw fit to raise up so great a Worthy, that he has been so eminently guided by di∣vine counsel, and allowed to live and be use∣ful, to a good old age.</P>
<P>THE reflections we have been indulging, like∣wise, strongly recommend attachment to the constitution and varied interests of our country. A deep blush ought to cover the face of those, who pretend to mourn for our departed Wash∣ington, and yet make it their daily effort to un∣der mine that noble edifice of liberty and go∣vernment, which has been the idol of his wishes, the work of his life, and no doubt the subject of his frequent and most servent prayers. The <HI>urn</HI> of so great and good a patriot, is too sacred to be wet with the tears, <HI>of foul hy∣pocrisy.</HI> It is impossible that real gratitude to the father of his country and the feelings of the parricide, should ever unite in the same heart.</P>
<P>THE address of the past discourse is also, most pointed and forcible, in favor of the vir∣tuous exemplary life.—If it is not to be ex∣pected or wished, that we should all be heroes
<PB N="17" REF="038576_0016_10129643C1BCCF18"/>
or statesmen; we ought universally to be sanc∣tified in heart and virtuous in conversation. The one talent claims the same improvement and ensures a proportionate reward, as the ten. The more humble virtues <HI>"of the greatest man who ever lived"</HI> formed out, by no means the least estimable part of his char∣acter.</P>
<P>To conclude, let the solemn providence which has been the burden of our remarks at this time, deeply impress every mind, in view of the inconceivably interesting article of death. Would the armed destroyer of our race, not pass by <HI>"heavens favorite son,"</HI> he certainly will not pass by us. Are there none sohigh, neither are there any so low, as to be remotely author∣ized in the calculation, that they shall never die." The small and great are there, and the servant is free from his master, "the object which ought to be that of chief solicitude with us all, being so to live the life of the righteous, "that our last end be like his."</P>
