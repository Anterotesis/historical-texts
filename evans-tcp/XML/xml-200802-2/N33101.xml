<P>In the purchase of a horse, examine fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> things, his teeth, his eyes, his legs and his wind.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>To know his age.</HEAD>
<P>Every treatise on farriery has instruct<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> us to know a horses age, by the mark <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his mouth; but not one in five hundred (a dealer excepted) can re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ain it in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mind. Let this then be sufficient; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> your finger and thumb raise his upper lip, and if his teeth shut close, you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> suppose him young; but if they point for∣ward
<PB N="5" REF="043428_0004_101CED106397BD78"/>
and the upper and under edges don't meet even, you may suspect he's old. And the longer his teeth are, (the gums being dry and shrunk from them, looking yellow and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>) the older he is</P>
<P>There are some exceptions to the above rule, but by a due attention you will seldom be deceived.</P>
<P>You may indeed examine his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sh, and if it be pointed and grooved that is, hol∣lowish on the inside, he cannot be judged to be above seven years old. Crafty jockeys will sometimes burn holes in the teeth, to make them appear young, which they call bishoping, but a discerning eye will soon discover the cheat.—Mares have no rushes, so that it is more difficult to know their age, but if the root of their mouth be fleshy, and almost as proud as the teeth, she's young.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Eyes.</HEAD>
<P>If a horses eyes are lively and clear, and you can see to the bottom, and the image of your face be reflected from thence, and not from the surface of the eye, they are good; but if muddy, cloudy, or coal-black, they are bad.</P>

<HEAD>Legs.</HEAD>
<P>If his knees are not broken, nor stand bending and trembling forward, (which is called knuckling) his legs may be good; but if he st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ps short and digs his to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in the ground, 'tis a sign he will knuckle. In short, if the hoof be pretty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lat and not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, you need not fear a founder.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Wind.</HEAD>
<P>If his flanks beat even and slow, his wind may be good, but if they heave double and irregular, or if (while he stands in the stable) he blows at the nostrils, as if he had just been galloping, they are signs of a broken wind. Deceitful dealers have a draught which they sometimes give▪ to make a horse breathe regularly in the stable; the surest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y therefore to judge of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, is, to give him a good brushing gal∣lop, and 'tis ten to one, if his wind be brok∣en or even touched, that he will cough and whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> very much▪ and no medicine can prevent his doing so.</P>

<HEAD>Cure for a broken wind.</HEAD>
<P>A broken wind may be cured, if the following be applied on the discovery of it.
<PB N="7" REF="043428_0006_101CED12A80DAD68"/>
A quarter of a pound of common tar, and the like quantity of honey; beat them well together, then dissolve them in a quart of new milk; let the horse fast two hours before you give this drench; walk him an hour after, and let him fast two hours; give this drench, every second day, with warm meat and drink.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>A saddle horse.</HEAD>
<P>A horse with thin shoulders, and a flat chest, whose fore<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>feet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd boldly forward and even, his neck rising semicircular from the points of those thin shoulders to his head may justly be said to have a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight forehand and be fitter for a saddle than a collar. As most horses in the hands of farmers are drawn while they are young, which notwithstanding their make occa∣sions them to move heavily, if you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esire a nimble-footed horse, choose one that has never drawn.</P>
<P>In buying a horse enquire into four
<PB N="8" REF="043428_0007_101CECC3AABE6200"/>

<P>A horse may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound▪ tho' guilty of all four, which a man can hardly discover by barely looking on him; so I refer you to his keeper.</P>
<P>When you are buying▪ i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is common for the owner, to say in praise of his horse, that he has neither sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nt, spavin nor windgall.</P>
<P>That you may not be imposed upon, those three are thus described.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Splint.</HEAD>
<P>The splint is a fixed callous excrescence or hard knob, growing upon the flat of the in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> outside (and sometimes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th) of the shank bone: a little under, and not far from the knee, and may be seen and felt.</P>
<P>To take it off shave the part, and beat it with a stick, prick it with a nail in a flat stick clap on a blistering plaister as strong us you can make it: let it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on three days <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hen take it off, and rub the place with half a dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of or∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y, and as much oil of vitriol mix'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> does not do, rub it a second

<P>Most young horses have splints more or less, and they will occasion lameness while they are coming upon the bone, but after they are grown to the firmness of bones, they do not lame a horse nor is such a horse worse for use, tho' he may not look so well to the eye.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Spavin.</HEAD>
<P>The spavin is of the same nature, and appears in like manner, on the instep bone behind, not for below the hough.</P>
<P>To take it off▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat the bone with a bleeding stick, and rub it; then anoint it with the oyl of origanum, ty<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a wet cloth▪ about it, and with a hot brick applied to it, soak in the oyl, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill it be dry.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Windgall.</HEAD>
<P>Windgalls are several little swellings just above the feetlo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k-joints of all the four legs; they seem, when felt, to be full of wind or jelly, but they never lame a horse;
<PB N="10" REF="043428_0009_101CECC57737C5D0"/>
the splint and spavin always do. They all three proceed from one and the same cause, which is hard riding, travelling too far in one day, or carrying too great a weight when young.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Setting out on a journey.</HEAD>
<P>Whenever you intend to travel, hunt, or only ride out for the air, let your horses feet be examined sometime<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> before, to see that his shoes are all fast and fit easy on his feet, for on that depends the pleasure and safety of your journey.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Directions for mounting.</HEAD>
<P>Before you mount, look round your horse, to see if his bridle, curb, saddle, and girts are all fitted in their proper place.—Always accustom your horse to stand firm and without a motion, till you are fixed in your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat, and your cloaths be adjusted.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Directions for going.</HEAD>
<P>When you would have him go, teach him to move, by pressing close your knees, or speaking to him, without using whip or spur; for a horse will learn any thing; and a good quality may as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be taught him as a bad one▪</P>

<HEAD>Correction ill timed. Correction well tim'd—An easy Rein.</HEAD>
<P>Most men whip and spur a horse, to make him go faster before they bid him; but it is cruel treatment, to beat a generous creature, before you have signified your mind to him, (by some token which he may be taught to understand) who would obey you if he knew your pleasure; 'tis time enough to correct him when he re∣fuses, or resists you. Don't haul his head about with too <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight a rein, it deaden his mouth; b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, he will carry you safer, and take better care of his steps with an easy h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd, than a heavy one; much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nds on the quietness of the bridle-hand. Keep your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> steady, and you cannot hurt his mouth. Again, nothing discovers a bad horse-man (even at a distance) so much as throwing his legs and arms a∣bout; for 'tis easiest to the horse and rider, and he can carry you further by ten miles a day, when you sit as steady upon him, as if you were a part of himself.</P>

<HEAD>A caution against boring and firing.</HEAD>
<P>Some farriers cut a hole through the skin in the middle of the shoulder, and (with the shank of a tobacco-pipe) blow it, as a butcher does a shoulder of veal; then they run a flat cold iron, like a horseman's sword-blade eight or ten inches up, between the shoulder blade and his ribs, (which they call boring) after that they burn him round his shoulder with a hot iron, and cross it like a glass window; next they lay a charge all over the shoulder (which is a composition of pitch, rosin and tar) then put a patten shoe upon the contrary foot, and in that condition turn him to grass.</P>
<P>I cannot say I ever knew a horse cured by this method, but I have known many a one lame ever after; for they never get clear of the stiffness which the boring and firing leave in the shoulder; a tender hearted man would be astonished at the cruelty of this invention; for all that can be obtained, is a free discharge of the humours (occasioned by the wrench) which may lodge between the shoulder blade and the ribs; for which you will find <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ling alone sufficient.</P>
