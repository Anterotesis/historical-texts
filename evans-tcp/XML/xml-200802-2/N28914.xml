<BIBL>YOUNG.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TIME, though a reality with which in our pre∣sent existence we are deeply conversant, is the most difficult to explain; and some have thought its nature so extremely intricate that it is incapable of admitting any clear and explicit definition. It
<PB N="2" REF="038552_0003_10122A85180A7AE0"/>
is, therefore, with diffidence we enter upon this sub∣ject, and offer our observations upon it, not as usurping over the reason or the religion of our readers, but with a devout wish for their instruc∣tion, by that Almighty Being who is the first cause, the great and last end of all things.</P>
<P>Time is the limited or given period for the pro∣duction and duration of things in natural life, ac∣cording to the wise counsel and sovereign pleasure of God. The diurnal and annual revolutions of the sun, as having been, from the beginning of na∣ture, constant, regular, and universally observable by mankind, and supposed equal to one another, have been, with reason, made use of for the mea∣sure of such natural and animal existence: con∣sequently, we find that time has been divided into centuries, years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds, &amp;c. and by these the larger and less intervals of time are estimated and measured. Whatever is without time has no succession; and whatever is in time, is subject to changes. Time, therefore, consists of three parts—the <HI>present,</HI> which enjoys existence; the <HI>past,</HI> which has lost it; the <HI>future,</HI> which is to obtain it. The light of nature, I presume, may teach us, that time is a <HI>creature;</HI> or, in other words, is given out and designed by the Supreme Majesty; because it is in a perpetual
<PB N="3" REF="038552_0004_10122A86A49E8AD0"/>
flux, produces the will of him who reigns above all, and is itself perishing in its own ruins, dragging with it the fate of kingdoms in spite of human op∣position. Some, therefore, have called time a drop taken out of the vast ocean of eternity, and which shall return into its own bosom; that it is an intermediate space, a prelude to an infinite expansion, boundless and never ending. Mr. Locke says, "the general idea we have of time, is by considering any part of infinite duration, as set out by periodical measures." The being or exist∣ence of time is obvious to all; and although a phi∣losophical search after its origin, nature, and pe∣riods, be commendable in the penetrating genius, yet its improvement for our moral happiness must certainly meet the highest commendation, and be more interesting to all; and, from this conviction, numberless volumes have been written upon the subject.</P>
<P>However uncertain the sentiments of philosophy upon the subject of time, let us now take up our BIBLE and see if we cannot tread upon more solid ground, and derive more pleasure in our in∣quiries.</P>
<P>I. This inestimable volume, the bible, directs our inquiries to Jehovah, as the ANCIENT OF DAYS, Daniel vii. that is, the author of <HI>time,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="038552_0005_1012582362797C38"/>
and the parent of <HI>eternity;</HI> who was before all things, by whom and for whom all things were made; and which, in the new testament, is applied to Jesus Christ in his divinity, who is God over all, blessed forever, the first and the last. Rev. i. 8.</P>
<P>Time, though now grown old, bears not its own date; neither informs us of its designed period; but the scriptures instruct us of the formation of the universe, when time, with human beings, com∣menced; the divisions of time by day and night, and what we call its weekly round; likewise of the period when the angel shall stand upon the earth and up∣on the sea, lift up his hand to heaven, and swear by him that liveth forever and ever, that there should be time no longer. Rev. x. 5, 6. There∣fore, in point of antiquity, the bible claims our devout esteem. This volume also gives us the completest history of the succession of time, as to the being and the vicissitudes of a vast number of the inhabitants of the earth, as formed into families, cities, and empires; the greater part of which were the subject of previous prophecy; and which, in their time, were fulfilled, not one failed; an in∣vestigation of which gives us a solid evidence of the authenticity of the scripture. Those who have been most conversant with the bible, have observed that the duration of time is marked with seven pe∣riods,
<PB N="5" REF="038552_0006_10125825DBA2B500"/>
or thousand years; two from the creation to the flood, two to the birth of Christ, two for the gospel aera, now in being, making six thousand years; to which is added, one thousand for the personal reign of Christ, called the Millennium: in the whole, seven thousand years; corresponding with the six first days of creation, and the sabbath, or seventh, the day of rest; for <HI>a thousand years are with the Lord as one day.</HI></P>
<P>II. Let us now contemplate time as the limited space of man's natural existence. To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose un∣der heaven; a time to be born, and a time to die. Eccl. iii. 1, 2. Man cometh not into being by ac∣cidental circumstances, or by what some call chance, but according to the fore-knowledge and infinite pleasure of God, who declareth the end from the beginning, and who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will. David, in lan∣guage most sublime, acknowledges God the au∣thor of his existence:—<HI>Thine eyes did see my sub∣stance, yet being unperfect: and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.</HI> Psm. cxxxix. 16. And in contemplation on the human structure, we may unite with Dr. Lowth—
<Q><PB N="6" REF="038552_0007_1012582856109AF8"/>
<L>With awful joy I view this frame of mine,</L>
<L>Stupendous monument of power divine!</L></Q></P>
<P>Our clime, parents, birth, parts, passions, time, place, and circumstances of our introduction to natural life, infancy, youth, manhood, old age, death, with all their variety of appendages and events, in their successive periods, are ordered by that God <HI>in whom we live, move, and have our being.</HI> Acts xvii. 28. Or, as Cowper admirably describes it—
<Q><L>—God gives to every man</L>
<L>The virtue, temper, understanding, taste,</L>
<L>That lifts him into life, and lets him fall</L>
<L>Just in the niche he was ordained to fill.</L></Q></P>
<P>We are not long introduced to life before we learn that time, like a vast confluence of waters, takes its rise from eternity; rapidly returns to the unbounded source from whence it came, bearing on its bosom the myriads of the human race. We learn too, that none can stem the current, nor for a moment divide its stream; it is, indeed, visible to all as we pass along, we date its rise with us, but <HI>none knoweth what a day may bring forth,</HI> nor ascertain when the solemn period of our time shall be turned by the hand of death. In youth we are prone to view our future time as a vast expanse;
<PB N="7" REF="038552_0008_10125829EE6D3548"/>
in manhood, by more confirmed worldly habits, we call our moments our own; though frequently they elude our touch, and either cut short the thread of life, or imperceptibly bring us to old age. May we not say with David, <HI>Lord remember how short my time is!</HI> Psm. lxxxix. 47. <HI>Our days on earth are as a shadow, and there is none abiding;</HI> 1 Chron. xxix. 15. a <HI>vapor,</HI> that in an instant is no more seen! James iv. 14. The longest life, in the review, is but as yesterday; and its various occurrences are as a tale that is told: Yet, every fleeting moment and revolving year are graduated by the hand of Almighty God, upon the scale of human being, and each shall answer his intended end.</P>
<P>III. The transactions of human beings survive the wreck of time, and pass into eternity; a thought, this, which should fall with solemn weight upon every breast. God's universal government, the un∣equal distribution of rewards and punishments in this life, the soul's consciousness of virtue and of vice, the egress of the mind towards a future state, man's departure out of time by death against his own will; these, with many other incontestable truths, form the foundation of our confidence, that the transactions of mankind, in time, are amenable to a future state of retribution; and, in which,
<PB N="8" REF="038552_0009_1012582C63F3CFC8"/>
the honours of God, in his law and justice, shall be revealed in presence of men and angels. On these most solemn and interesting subjects the scrip∣tures give us the highest instruction; they make a considerable part of their ample page. Verily there is a God that judgeth the earth. Psm. lviii. 11. We must all appear before the judgment s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad. 2 Cor. v. 10. The Lord look∣ed down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand and seek God. They are all gone aside, they are al∣together become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one. Psm. xiv. Every idle word that man shall speak, he shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. Matt. xxxvi. The dead, small and great, shall stand before God; the sea, death and hell, shall deliver up their dead to be judged, every man according to his works. Rev. xx This description of the state of man, and of future retribution, is consonant to sound reason; a con∣viction of which must exist in every conscious breast. How dreary then the prospect of human nature! On the rapid stream of time, esteeming the precious moments of existence as the most trifling commodity though more valuable than
<PB N="9" REF="038552_0010_1012582FB3F55C70"/>
choicest treasures,—employed in gratifying the car∣nal, earthly, and sensual appetites of the soul;—trampling upon the authority of God, trangressing his law, and bidding defiance to his almighty judg∣ment! Every moment brings the sinner nearer to his final end; the strong current of time hastening him to death, who shall whirl the soul down the awful precipice from whence he can only rise to stand before the judge of all, and receive his final doom. Lord what is man! passing on the im∣petuous torrent of time to a future state, from whence he shall not return!</P>

<P>IV. It is therefore with the highest pleasure we reflect on time as the space in which the purposes of God are unfolded in Jesus Christ, as willing and mighty to redeem lost sinners as they were low sunk in wretchedness and ruin. This most blessed Sa∣viour was promised immediately after the trans∣gression of our first parents in Paradise, and revealed as the seed of the woman who was to bruise the ser∣pent's head. Gen. iii. 15. He was afterwards recog∣nized by successive prophets, in successive ages; and
<PB N="10" REF="038552_0011_10125832298AD788"/>
Daniel ushered in the precise time in which the Messiah was to appear. Chap. ix. Paul, well con∣versant with the Hebrew prophecies, informs, that <HI>when the fulness of time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law; that we might receive the adoption of sons.</HI> Gal, iv. 4, 5. Jesus, Messiah, the Son of God, ap∣peared, spent thirty years in private life, according to the Hebrew law, and began his public ministry: this being accomplished, he goes up to Jerusalem voluntarily, to suffer and to die. In view of the cross he cries, "<HI>Father, the hour is come, glorify thy Son that thy Son may also glorify thee.</HI>" John xvii. 1. The memorable point of time is arrived, in which all the series of prophecy and sacrifice are accomplished. He finishes the transgression, makes an end of sins, makes reconciliation for iniquity, brings in everlasting righteousness, and seals up the vision and prophecy. Daniel ix. 24. The paschal Lamb is now slain; the law is magnified and made honourable both in precept and in penalty; the powers of darkness are overcome and bound in more than adamantine chains; death is disarmed of his dreadful sting, and the gates of immortal life wide unfolded to every pious mind! Then, my soul, admire this blessed gospel day—

<P>V. As there is a time for a man's natural birth, so there is also a period for his spiritual birth; <HI>ex∣cept a man be born again, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God;</HI> and by which, in <HI>time,</HI> the soul is habitually prepared for an eternal state. By their fruits ye shall know them. Man possessed of carnal appetites and desires, never can be happy in the enjoyment of spiritual, holy, and heavenly re∣alities; there is, therefore, a moral necessity for his being born again in time; and, by which, his soul is brought to taste, feel, and enjoy those sacred blessings unknown, if not despised by him before. <HI>Time,</HI> the precious gift of God, he views with new eyes; redeems what is lost, and improves the present to the noble purposes of glorifying God, and promoting the benefits of his fellow mortals.
<PB N="12" REF="038552_0013_1012583640E7E730"/>
<HI>What time he is afraid, he trusteth in the Lord.</HI> Psm. lvi. 3. <HI>In the time of trouble, God hideth him in his pavilion,</HI> covereth him in his secret ta∣bernacle, and setteth him upon a rock. Psm. xxvii. 5. His highest privilege is to walk in the light of God's countenance, and in his name to rejoice all the day. Psm. lxxxix. 15, &amp;c. One peculiarity is worthy our remark: every man, by natural birth, is born to die; but he that is born of the Spirit, and believeth in Christ, <HI>shall never die eternally;</HI> and with this most comfortable persuasion, <HI>he passes the time of his sojourning here,</HI> in prospect of an eternal state of blessedness with God beyond the vale of death. John xi. 25, 26.</P>

<HEAD>THE MISER.</HEAD>
<P>MR. OSTERVALD, a well known banker, died in France, 1790. This man, originally of Neuschatel, felt the violence of the disease of ava∣rice so strongly, that within a few days of his death, no importunities could induce him to buy a few pounds of meat for the purpose of making him a little soup. "'Tis true," said he, "I should not dislike the soup, but I have no appetite for the meat, what then is to become of that?" At the time he refused this nourishment, for fear of being obliged to give away two or three pounds of meat, there was tied round his neck a silken bag, which contained eight hundred affignats of one thousand livres each. At his outset in life, he drank a pint of beer, which served him for supper, at a house much frequented, from which he carried home all the bottle-corks he could come at. Of these, in the course of eight years, he had collect∣ed as many as sold for twelve louis-d'ors, a sum that laid the foundation of his future fortune, the superstructure of which was rapidly raised by his uncommon success of stock-jobbing. He died pos∣sessed of three millions of livres; that is, one hundred and twenty-five thousand pounds sterling!</P>
<P>How pernicious is avarice! while it denies a
<PB N="14" REF="038552_0015_1012583C2E74F1C0"/>
friendly hand to wipe away the tear of grief that falls from a fellow mortal's eye: it is as a vulture upon the miser's own breast; and however such may plead the christian <HI>name,</HI> he proves himself a stranger to its benevolent <HI>nature.</HI> A spirit of ava∣rice is so inhuman, so contrary to the well-being of society, and so despicable in itself, that no chris∣tian virtue can dwell in that breast in which it reigns. It expresses the highest ingratitude to God for the vouchsafement of his favours, and with∣draws from that love of our neighbour which should characterize our species; so that the miser may be said to disdain all obligation both to God and man; and I may add, he is unworthy of both. That benevolence yields its own most pleasurable reward, no man will dispute; that avarice, too, is frequently the miser's executioner, abundant testi∣monies occur; among which, I shall, for the fur∣ther entertainment of our readers, recite the follow∣ing authenticated narrative.</P>
<P>Monsieur Foscue, one of the farmers gene∣ral of the province of Languedoc, in France, who had amassed considerable wealth by grinding the faces of the poor within his province, and every other mean, however low, base, or cruel, by which he rendered himself universally hated, was one day ordered by the government to raise a
<PB N="15" REF="038552_0016_1012583DCB193790"/>
considerable sum, upon which, as an excuse for not complying with the demand, he pleaded ex∣treme poverty; but fearing least some of the inha∣bitants of Languedoc should give information to the contrary, and his house should be searched, he resolved on hiding his treasure in such a manner as to escape the most strict examination. He dug a cave in his wine-cellar, which he made so large and deep that he used to go down to it with a lad∣der: at the entrance was a door with a spring-lock upon it, which, on shutting, would fasten of itself. Very lately Monsieur Foscue was missing; dili∣gent search was made after him in every place; the ponds were drawn, and every method which hu∣man imagination could suggest, was taken for finding him, but in vain. In a short time after, his house was sold, and the purchaser beginning either to rebuild it or to make some alteration in it, the workmen discovered a door in the cellar, with a key in the lock, which being opened, and on going down, they found Monsieur Foscue lying dead upon the ground, with a candlestick near him, but no candle in it, which he had eaten; and on searching farther, they found the vast wealth which he had amassed. It it supposed that when Mon∣sieur Foscue went into his cave, the door by some accident shut after him; and being out of the call
<PB N="16" REF="038552_0017_1012584049C66D18"/>
of any person, he perished for want of food. He had gnawed the flesh of both his arms. Thus awfully did this miser die amidst his treasures, de∣nying his wealth for the benefit of society; he was constrained to make his last meal upon his own body!—Few misers but what, some how or other, <HI>trap</HI> themselves.</P>

THE DOG.</HEAD>
<P>THIS class of animals may be principally distin∣guished by their claws, which have no sheath, like those of the cat kind; by their having six cutting-teeth, and two canine in each jaw: also by their having five toes before, and four behind. But,
<PB N="17" REF="038552_0018_10125843E8D8C1B0"/>
though this is invariable in the wild species, such as the wolf, &amp;c. the common dogs have frequently five toes on each foot. The tail of those of the dog kind bends towards the left, a character com∣mon to the whole species, and first discovered by Linnaeus.</P>
<P>Of all animals the dog is the most susceptible of change in its form, its varieties being almost num∣berless: each will mix with the other, and produce varieties still more unlike the original stock. The climate, the food, and the education, make strong impressions upon this animal, and produce altera∣tions in its shape, colour, hair, and size; and in every thing but its nature. All dogs are evidently of one kind; but which of them is the original, from whence such a variety of descendants have sprung, is not easily to be determined. Mr. Buffon makes the chien de berger, the shepherd's dog, to be the original, it being naturally the most sensible; and becomes, without discipline, almost instantly the guardian of the flocks, and keeps them within bounds.</P>
<P>The dog is the most intelligent of all known quadrupeds, and the acknowledged friend of man∣kind. At night the guard of the house is commit∣ted to his care, and he seems proud of the charge; he continues a watchful centinel, goes his rounds,
<PB N="18" REF="038552_0019_101258465F36C0D0"/>
scents strangers at a distance, and warns them of his being upon duty. His voice is more readily obeyed by the flock and the herd, than even that of the shepherd or the husbandman. The dog is formed for the chase, and affords equal assistance to the sportsman: his scent is more exquisite than that of other animals in the pursuit of game, and can distinguish his master from among a thousand.</P>
<P>Some of the varieties of the dog, are, the shep∣herd's dog, the hound, the spaniel, the grey-hound, the mastiff, the bull-dog, the terrier, the blood-hound, the tumbler, the lap-dog, lion-dog, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>The heathen consecrated the dog to Mercury, as the most vigilant and crafty of the gods; because watchfulness and sagacity are the properties of that animal. The Japanese give the following names to the twelve signs of the Zodiac, and the twelve hours of the day. The first they call the rat, se∣cond the cow, third the tyger, fourth the hare, fifth the dragon, sixth the serpent, seventh the horse, eighth the sheep, ninth the ape, tenth the cock, eleventh the dog, and twelfth the boar. The em∣peror who was upon the throne when Kaempfer was in Japan, was born under the eleventh sign, or the <HI>dog;</HI> consequently he had a great fondness for that animal. According to an edict published by that prince, all the dogs that died within his do∣minions
<PB N="19" REF="038552_0020_10125847F85EC558"/>
were to be carried to the top of a moun∣tain, there to be buried with great pomp. A poor man, who was carrying his dog to the appointed spot, finding the dead carcase heavy, and the way long, began to murmur against the orders of his sovereign, upon which a neighbour, who accom∣panied him, observed with much propriety, that in∣stead of complaining, he ought, on the contrary, to thank the gods, who, in their wisdom, had de∣creed that the emperor should not be born under the sign of the <HI>horse;</HI> "for," said he, "a horse would have been a much more disagreeable burden than a <HI>dog.</HI>"</P>
<P>I will here take leave to introduce to our readers the practice of the Guebres of Persia, to those who are in the act of expiring in death; the attendants raise the poor man, and a near relation presents a dog to his mouth, on a supposition that the breath, or soul, will be communicated to that animal, and be happy. No less extraordinary is the practice of this people towards the body after death. This is laid decently upon the ground, under the walls of the intended sepulchre, while one of the rela∣tions goes round the village to try if he can allure a dog to follow him. He does all he can to bring the animal as near as possible to the corpse, for they imagine that the nearer the dog comes, the
<PB N="20" REF="038552_0021_1012584A77376428"/>
nearer the departed soul is to everlasting happiness. But if the dog cannot be tempted to approach it, then it is considered as a bad omen, and they al∣most despair of his felicity. When the dog has performed the task assigned him, two priests, stand∣ing about ten yards distant from the body, repeat a form of prayer half an hour in length. During the whole of this ceremony, the corpse has a piece of paper fixed to each ear, and hangs over the face about three inches below the chin. As soon as the prayers are over, the corpse is carried to the place allotted for its reception, and all the company fol∣low it, two and two, with their hands devoutly closed. They are enjoined not to speak a word, because they believe their sepulchre is a place of silence and repose.</P>
<P>While we lament the general ignorance of the Guebres, we perceive that they had a strong con∣viction that the soul survived the death of the body; and that, in its separate state, it was capable of happiness or misery. How inexcusable, therefore, are those of our clime who pretend to greater de∣grees of rationality and refinement, and yet pre∣sume, at least to profess, that the soul either sleeps with the body in the grave, or is entirely annihi∣lated? Thankful ought we to be for the volume of revelation which describes the nature, qualities, and
<PB N="21" REF="038552_0022_1012584E03E44EB0"/>
immortality of the soul, and opens to us, in the most rational, sublime, and God-honouring scenes, what awaits us beyond the vale of death; and points us, at the same time, to an all-sufficient Saviour, who is <HI>the way, the truth, and the life.</HI></P>
<P>The scripture, for the purpose of conveying in∣struction to our minds, and of designating some particular characters, has named the <HI>dog,</HI> the ani∣mal now under consideration.</P>
<P>A dog, a dead dog, a dog's head, were frequently named to express an insignificant and vile person. Elisha, the prophet, being inspired by God to foresee the future evil conduct of Hazael, thus ad∣dressed him—<HI>I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women with child.</HI> Hazael replied—<HI>What, is thy fervent a</HI> DOG, <HI>that he should do this great thing?</HI> 2 Kings viii. 12, 13. But however this wicked man professed an ab∣horrence to such atrocious actions, yet it is cer∣tain that the wretched <HI>dog did cut Israel short, and smote them in all their coast.</HI> x. 32.</P>
<P>As in the days of Isaiah, so in every age, there are false teachers, wicked persons, not called of God, that intrude themselves upon the people,
<PB N="22" REF="038552_0023_101258507B1AEF88"/>
who are justly said to be <HI>blind, ignorant, dumb dogs, that cannot bark;</HI> therefore, not fit to give an alarm in time of danger, nor give faithful instruc∣tion to others;—they are <HI>sleeping dogs, lying down, loving to slumber;</HI> and so quite unfit to watch the gates of Zion;—<HI>greedy dogs; that can never have enough,</HI> they love the fleece better than the flock, con∣stantly preying upon rich and poor without filling their own belly. Isa. lvi. 10, 11. Such persons, let them be found among whatever religious denominations they may, must prove a curse instead of a blessing.</P>
<P>Satan, the devil, is called a <HI>dog;</HI> a fierce blood-hound, seeking the destruction of the souls of men; and who combatted Christ in the wilderness, and upon the cross, but foiled and made prisoner in chains. Psm. xxii, 20. I may now call Satan the shepherd's dog: Christ, the chief shepherd of Israel, making use of him as a shepherd doth his dog, to keep his flock together, and making all his howl∣ings and barkings, his vile efforts, subservient to his pleasure, and the highest interest of his chosen flock.</P>
<P>To gratify our young readers, in particular, I shall close this piece of natural history, by reciting some well authenticated anecdotes of the sagacity and faithfulness of the dog.</P>
<P>Of the following incident Plutarch affirms that
<PB N="23" REF="038552_0024_1012585219061CD8"/>
he, himself, was an eye-witness. Being once on ship-board, he observed a jar which was about half filled with oil. A dog was very desirous of paying his addresses to the contents, but the oil was too low in the containing vessel for him to get at it. The seamen were all engaged different ways; and the dog, willing to make the most of the fa∣vourable opportunity, took up, successively, a num∣ber of stones which were stowed in that part of the ship, and dropping them, one by one, into the jar, the oil at last rose within his reach, and he lapped as much of it as he pleased. "<HI>I was astonished,</HI>" says Plutarch, "<HI>by what means the dog could sa∣gaciously know, that the immission of heavier substances would cause the lighter substance to ascend.</HI>"</P>
<P>A servant of Sir Henry Lee had formed a de∣sign of assassinating his master, and robbing the house. That very night, a mastiff dog, which had never been much noticed by Sir Henry, for the first time followed him up stairs, got under the bed, and could not be got from thence, by either master or man. In the dead of night the same servant entered the room to execute his horrid de∣sign, but was instantly seized by the dog; and be∣ing secured, confessed his intention. In memory of this preservation, Sir Henry Lee engaged John∣ston,
<PB N="24" REF="038552_0025_10125853F15ADF58"/>
the celebrated painter, who drew a portrait of Sir Henry, with the mastiff by his side; and in one corner of the picture, are ten laconic lines, concluding thus—
<Q><L>But in my dog, whereof I made no store,</L>
<L>I find more love than those I trusted more.</L></Q></P>
<P>The dead body of a Roman soldier, who had been killed in a domestic tumult, was carefully watched and guarded by his dog; who would not permit any person to touch the remains of his de∣parted master. PYRRHUS, the king, passing by that way, took notice of so striking a spectacle, and inquired into the circumstances of the case. On being informed that the man had been slain three days before, and that the dog, in all that time, had neither stirred from the body, nor taken any food, the king ordered the body to be buried, and the dog to be brought to him. The creature soon grew fond of Pyrrhus, who, shortly after, ordering his forces to muster, the soldiers passed be∣fore him in review. During this ceremony, the dog, for some time, lay quiet at his feet; till seeing those soldiers march by who had murdered his late mas∣ter, he sprung at them with such rage and fierce∣ness, and turned himself to Pyrrhus with such meaning in his looks and gestures, that the men were sent to prison, on suspicion of having com∣mitted
<PB N="25" REF="038552_0026_101258566BBA07E0"/>
the crime with which the dog seemed to charge them. Being strictly examined, they con∣fessed themselves guilty, and were accordingly ex∣ecuted.</P>

<HEAD>SNOW.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>He gives the winter's snow her airy birth,</L>
<L>And bids her virgin fleeces clothe the earth.</L>
<BIBL>SANDYS.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AMONG the phaenomena of winter, no one is more worthy of discussion than that of SNOW, which is confessedly one of the most curious pro∣ductions of nature; and, from the remotest ages of antiquity, has excited the admiration of philoso∣phers and poets. We shall, therefore, offer our readers a few philosophical remarks upon the sub∣ject, and then advert to the scriptures, which not only corroborate the dictate of sound philosophy, but, under the emblem of snow, afford us lessons of spiritual instruction.</P>
<P>Snow is formed by the freezing of the vapours in the atmosphere. It differs from hail and hoar∣frost in being, as it were, crystallized, which they are not. This appears, on examination of a flake of snow by a magnifying glass; when the whole of
<PB N="26" REF="038552_0027_1012585AA616CF08"/>
it will appear to be composed of fine shining spi∣cula, diverging like rays from a centre. As the flakes fall down through the atmosphere, they are continually joined by more of these radiated spicula, and thus increase in bulk, like the drops of rain or hail-stones. Dr. Grew observes, that many parts of snow are of a regular figure, for the most part so many little rowels, or stars of six points, and are as perfect and transparent ice as any we see on a pond. Upon each of these points are other colla∣teral points, set at the same angles as the main points themselves; among which there are divers other irregular, which are chiefly broken points, and fragments of the regular ones. Others also, by various winds, seem to have been thawed, and froze again into irregular clusters, so that it seems as if the whole body of snow were an infinite mass of icicles irregularly figured; that is, a cloud of vapours being gathered into drops, the said drops forthwith descend; upon which descent, meeting with a freezing air as they pass through a colder region, each drop is immediately frozen into an icicle, shooting itself forth into several points; but these still continuing their descent, and meeting with some intermitting gales of warmer air, or in their continual wastage to and fro touching upon each other; some of them are a little thawed, blunt∣ed,
<PB N="27" REF="038552_0028_1012585D1E258B68"/>
and again froze into clusters, or entangled so as to fall down in what we call flakes. The lightness of snow, although it is firm ice, is owing to the excess of its surface in comparison of the matter contained in it; as gold itself may be extended in surface till it will ride upon the least breath of air. From some late experiments on the quantity of wa∣ter yielded by snow, it appears that the latter gives only about one tenth of its bulk. The peculiar agency of snow as a fertilizer in preference to rain, may, without recurring to nitrous salts supposed to be contained in it, be rationally ascribed to its fur∣nishing a covering for the roots of vegetables, by which they are guarded from the influence of the atmospherical cold, and the internal heat of the earth is prevented from escaping. Whatever dif∣ference may arise upon this subject, every true phi∣losopher will pronounce the phaenomena of snow to be the production of the ALMIGHTY, under whose supreme controul every element is subservi∣ent to his infinite pleasure, and produces infinite benefits to mankind.</P>
<LG>
<L>He from aerial treasures downward pours</L>
<L>Sheets of unsully'd snow in lucid show'rs;</L>
<L>Flake after flake, thro' air, thick-wav'ring flies,</L>
<L>'Till one vast shining waste, all nature lies.</L>
<L><PB N="28" REF="038552_0029_101229FADE30E1C0"/>
Then the proud hills a virgin whiteness shed,</L>
<L>A dazzling brightness glitters from the mead;</L>
<L>The hoary trees reflect a silver show,</L>
<L>And groves beneath the lovely burden bow.</L>
</LG>
<BIBL>BROOME.</BIBL>
<P>This subject is charmingly illucidated in the scrip∣tures, and to which we will now repair. Con∣templating the works of God, the writer of the book of Job declares—<HI>God thundereth marvel∣ously with his voice: great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend: for he saith to the snow, be thou on the earth.</HI> Job xxxvii. 6. Je∣hovah, in his expostulation with Job, inquires, <HI>Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow; or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail?</HI> xxxviii. 22. <HI>He giveth,</HI> saith David, <HI>snow like wool: he scattereth the hoar-frost like ashes. He cast∣eth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand be∣fore his cold?</HI> Psm. cxlvii. 16, 17. "At his com∣mand, he maketh the snow to fall apace. As birds flying he scattereth the snow, and the falling down thereof is as the lighting of grass-hoppers. The eye marveleth at the beauty of the whiteness thereof, and the heart is astonished at the raining of it."</P>
<P>It is obvious that the productions of nature are employed by the Almighty, through the medium of the scripture, to instruct us in the unsearchable
<PB N="29" REF="038552_0030_1012585EB85F2ED0"/>
riches of Jesus Christ, which are for the benefit of the subjects of his grace; who, I may say, con∣stitute a spiritual world in animal life. It is wor∣thy of remark, that all natural productions named in the scriptures, are such with which men are ge∣nerally conversant, and of which the most feeble mind can form some agreeable ideas. The blessings of grace, however rich and abundant, are incom∣prehensible by the eye of depraved reason:—<HI>The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him; nei∣ther can he know them, because they are spiritual∣ly discerned.</HI> 1 Cor. ii. 14. Therefore, that mind which is illuminated by the rays of the SUN OF RIGHTEOUSNESS, not only sees God in every animal, vegetable, and fossile production of nature, but grasps the whole as wonderfully designed by a wise and condescending God, to instruct us in the more sublime, satiating riches of his grace. Here, then, we may find a solution of the query which Broom, in terms so delicate, has proposed—
<Q><L>Why hover snows and wanton in the air,</L>
<L>Fall by degrees, and clothe the hoary year?</L></Q>
To teach us the infinite understanding, and the immaculate holiness of Christ Jesus as the supreme judge, <HI>in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom
<PB N="30" REF="038552_0031_101258622F1D0900"/>
and knowledge.</HI> Col. ii. 3. How sublime the de∣scription of our Lord, and of the attending circum∣stances of final judgment, drawn by the spirit of inspiration, with the hand of the prophet Daniel, vii. 9, 10. <HI>I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the ancient of days did sit, whose gar∣ment was white as</HI> SNOW, <HI>and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. A fiery stream issued, and came forth before him: thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.</HI> The same grand images were continued and mul∣tiplied by St. John, who was honoured with a sight of the Son of God, <HI>whose head and hairs were white like wool, as white as</HI> SNOW, <HI>and whose eyes were as a flame of fire.</HI> Rev. i. While the splendid magnificence of this description fills our imagination with the highest transports, may our hearts be equally impressed with solemn awe; that we, that writer, and the reader, each in their own persons, shall stand before <HI>the judge of the whole earth,</HI> when time, with them, shall be no more! May the judge, therefore, become our friend! for, O! wonderful goodness and unparallel mercy!—the judge himself hath died for criminals, and suf∣fered
<PB N="31" REF="038552_0032_10125864AAF6DEF0"/>
upon the cross, the punishment of human crimes, to transmit them to a crown of bliss!</P>
<P>What production of nature is whiter than snow? And what a delightful idea do its phaenomena con∣vey of the efficacy of Christ's precious blood upon a sinner's heart! <HI>Come now, and let us reason to∣gether, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</HI> Isaiah i. 18. As the new fallen <HI>snow</HI> covereth a polluted carcase, or a filthy dunghill, so, infinitely more so, the blood of the Lamb covereth the foulest crimes, and cleanseth from fins of the deepest dye: so pure and perfect in the eye of discerning justice, that neither spot, blemish, wrinkle, nor any such thing shall be found upon them. Eph. v. 27. Da∣vid, the King of Israel, conscious that he was black with original corruption, and actual trans∣gression, like the <HI>leper</HI> and the <HI>unclean,</HI> under the Mosaic law, plead, with earnestness, the sprinkling of atoning blood: <HI>Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.</HI> Psm. li. 7. And what heart but needs the same cleansing? Yet, alas! how few esteem a Saviour's blood!</P>
<P>The fleecy snow descends to aid our reflections on God's beneficent address to the prophet Isaiah,
<PB N="32" REF="038552_0033_1012586649B4D530"/>
assuring him, under the beautiful emblem of <HI>snow;</HI> the salutary efficacy of <HI>the word of his grace</HI> up∣on the human soul. <HI>As the rain cometh down, and the</HI> SNOW <HI>from heaven, and returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater; so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth.</HI> Isa. lv. 10, 11. Does the snow fertilize the earth and promote the vegetation of plants? Infinitely more efficacious is the word of Christ upon the heart of man, which falls with gentle influence, producing the fruits of righteousness which are through Jesus Christ to the glory of God, and the infinite advantage of man∣kind.</P>
<P>We cannot close this paper without reminding the thoughtless sinner, that, as <HI>drought and heat consume the snow-waters, so doth the grave those which have sinned.</HI> Job xxiv. 19. While in the bloom of youth, the abundance of wealth, or in the career of honour, suddenly, as the heat dis∣solveth the snow, and its waters penetrate the earth without leaving a trace behind, so death removes the sinner to the grave; he mingles with the dust, and all his false hopes, riches, honours, name, are covered together from mortal sight, and await the judgment of the great God. Let us, therefore, be
<PB N="33" REF="038552_0034_10125867E3F77560"/>
wise, reflect on the baneful consequences of sin, consider our latter end, and seek salvation and im∣mortal glory in that most blessed Saviour, who shall preserve our souls when snow and hail shall cease to fall, and ruined nature sinks in years!</P>

<HEAD>A VERY SOLEMN OCCURRENCE!</HEAD>
<HEAD>Transcribed from The STAR, printed in London.</HEAD>
<P>THE Rev. Caleb Evans, D. D. president of the seminary at Bristol for the education of young ministers, was called to visit a family that belonged to his congregation, and saw a young lady setting in an easy chair, who came to the <HI>hot wells</HI> for the benefit of her health, and boarded with them. Ob∣serving her unusually pensive, the Doctor took the liberty to inquire the reason. She answered—"Sir, I will think no more of it, it is only a dream; and I will not be so childish as to be alarmed at a dream: but Sir," said she, "I will tell you my dream, and then I will think no more of it." She then repeated as follows:—</P>
<P>"Last night I dreamed I was at the ball where I intend to go to night: soon after I was in the room, I was taken very ill, and they gave me a smelling bottle; and then I was brought home into
<PB N="34" REF="038552_0035_1012586C63AF21C0"/>
this room, and I was put into <HI>that</HI> chair, (pointing to an elbow chair) fainted, and died. I then thought I was carried to a place where were angels and holy people singing hymns and praises to God; that I found myself very unhappy, and desired to go from them. My conductor said, if I did, I should <HI>never</HI> come there again: with that, he vio∣lently whirled me <HI>out,</HI> and I fell down! down! down! through darkness, and thunderings, and sul∣phur, into flames; and when the flames began to scorch me, I was alarmed with hideous cries, <HI>and awaked.</HI>"</P>
<P>Dr. Evans made some serious remarks on the dream, and desired the young lady not to go to the ball that night. She said she would, for she was more of a woman than to mind dreams. She went to the ball—was taken ill—a smelling-bottle was given her, according to her dream—she was brought home, put into the chair above-mention∣ed—fainted—died!</P>
<P>The well known respectability of Dr. Evans, and his disposition in not receiving the sallies of fancy for realities, much less giving credit to the many imaginary stories which float about the world under the denomination of religious: these were sufficient inducements to the EDITOR to give the above narrative a place in this publication as truly

authentic. He makes no comment; he leaves it with his readers, and adds his affectionate wish, that the perusal of it may be attended with solemn reflection by the young and the gay; by which they may learn, that a character formed in this life, virtuous or vicious, will not fail to terminate the career of mortals, and introduce them to plea∣sures or to pains.</P>

<HEAD>A TROPHY OF GRACE, OR THE THIEF SAVED UPON THE CROSS.</HEAD>
<P>IT is generally observed that the greatest useful∣ness of men is confined to the meridian of their life; but this will by no means apply to the Son of God while on our earth: for, although his whole life was spent in teaching the ignorant, and in per∣forming the most astonishing miracles for the bene∣fit of mankind, yet, his greatest acts of mercy, and his most valuable miracles, were reserved for the last. Among these is the conversion of the thief who was crucified with him upon Calvary. As this is the subject for our present reflections, we will ex∣amine the state of this poor man while in the pur∣suit of sin; the marks of Christ's interposing grace while the thief was upon the cross in the very ago∣nies

of death; then draw some useful lessons from the affecting scene.</P>
<P>I. Examine the case of this poor man. St. Mat∣thew and Mark inform us that he and his com∣panions were <HI>thieves;</HI> for which, they were con∣demned by the law of their country, to die upon the cross. What they had stolen, from whom, or how frequently they had transgressed, we are not informed; but of this we are certain, that they had not only injured their fellow creatures by de∣priving them of their property, exposing them∣selves to a shameful death, but that, by <HI>sin,</HI> they had robbed God of his honour and themselves of happiness, and exposed themselves to his displeasure. <HI>Ye are cursed with a curse, for ye have robbed me, saith the Lord.</HI> Mal. iii. 8, 9. The man who is the particular subject of our attention, could not be insensible of the horrid disgrace to which his crimes had exposed him; his soul must have been filled with horror, <HI>for a wicked man is loathsome and cometh to shame.</HI> Prov. xiii. 5. But, whatever may have been this man's consciousness at his trial, in the dungeon, or on his way to Calvary, we now behold him in the very grasp of death, with his unpardoned sins upon his head, and without the shadow of hope for reprieve.

<HEAD>OBITUARY.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 26th of September, 1795, died, in the 32d year of his age, of the malignant fever which then prevailed in New-York, the Rev. JACOB BRUSH, one of the Elders of the Methodist Epis∣copal Church. Mr. Brush attended Mr. Court∣ney, at whose house he boarded, and who died of the fever; and on the next Lord's-day he preached a sermon on the occasion, from Matt. xxv. 23. in the new church. Mr. Brush, immediately on his return home, was taken ill, languished five days and died, and on the Sabbath following the Rev. Mr. Kingston preached a sermon, from Rev. xiv. 13. in the same pulpit, on the death of Mr. Brush.
<PB N="47" REF="038552_0048_1012588CA451C290"/>
Shall not this event make a solemn impression upon surviving Ministers, that they may so faithfully dis∣charge their office as to be ready to go from the pulpit to the tribunal of Jehovah? What is yet remarkable, Mr. Brush, in a few days, was to have been married to Miss E. M.—How soon may our most pleasing prospects be over-cast, and we torn from the embraces of our friends, and lodged in the chambers of corruption!</P>
<P>Mr. Brush, at an early period of life, became seriously affected with divine things. After deep distress for sin, he obtained faith in Christ as his Saviour. He then thought it his duty to preach the Gospel of that Christ who had done so much for his soul, and in 1785 he was admitted as proba∣tioner into the Conferrence of Methodist Minis∣ters. In 1788 he was ordained a <HI>Deacon,</HI> and in 1790 he entered the <HI>Eldership.</HI> As a minister, he was zealous, wise, bold and successful; as a chris∣tian, devout and circumspect; and as a friend, sympathetic, kind and constant. In his last sick∣ness he appeared solemnly happy; and, a few hours before his death, he was asked "Whether he felt happy in God, and had an assurance of the divine favour?" To which (by signs) he answered in the affirmative. The last Lord's-day that he preached he appeared to be so resigned to the will
<PB N="48" REF="038552_0049_1012588E426C29B8"/>
of God, that some of the hearers observed, "they never heard him preach with so much power before, and that he seemed to preach as though it were his last."</P>
<P>Thus was cut off, in the prime of life, a pro∣mising and useful Minister of Christ, and as highly beloved among the people of his connection.</P>
<LG>
<L>In thee, my <HI>Brush,</HI> the Lord did sweetly join</L>
<L>The Friend, the Christian, and Divine;</L>
<L>Thy message was, "go preach the sacred word,"</L>
<L>Nor didst thou fear to draw the preacher's sword.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Supported thus thy race through life is run,</L>
<L>Thy battle fought, and crown of glory won:</L>
<L>Thy Master smiles and bids thee to retire,</L>
<L>With "Well done servant, now receive thy hire!"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Escap'd from earth, thou'st gain'd the happy plain,</L>
<L>Where tempting is no more, nor racking pain;</L>
<L>There Jesus views his flock with sweet delight;</L>
<L>He looks benign, and says they are his right.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My <HI>Brush,</HI> my <HI>friend,</HI> and <HI>brother,</HI> ever dear!</L>
<L>Thy memory from my eye extorts a tear,</L>
<L>Of friendship, while thy worth I view,</L>
<L>By few excell'd among the pious few.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O God of love! our hearts do thou inspire</L>
<L>To live, to preach, like <HI>Brush,</HI> and never tire;</L>
<L>So shall we meet in realms of bliss above,</L>

<HEAD>An ESSAY on the POWER of CHRIST.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By the Rev. GEORGE STREBECK.</BYLINE>
<P>WHO would conclude, that the babe of Beth∣lehem, the tender plant which shot forth from the stem of Jesse, should ever be the great and mighty Potentate of the universe! That HE, who suffered death on the cross, should ever travail in the great∣ness of his strength! Yet so it was. JESUS burst the bands of death, triumphed over the grave, and
<PB N="50" REF="038552_0052_1012589695D278B8"/>
declared that "<HI>all power in heaven and in earth was given unto him.</HI>"</P>
<P>I will not detain you to inquire in what respects his power is, that of <HI>authority</HI> or <HI>ability,</HI> but ra∣ther take notice of its <HI>extent,</HI> and inquire how it was a <HI>gift</HI> unto him.</P>
<P N="1">1. He exercises his power <HI>in heaven.</HI> O! how different the view of Jesus in the state of his humi∣liation, and that glorious state of exaltation which he enjoys at the right-hand of the Father! Those temples which once were crowned with thorns, wear now the crown of glory and majesty! Those hands which once were nailed to the cross, now hold the sceptre of his kingdom! It is a striking evidence of the power which Christ exercises in heaven, that angels, with the superior authorities of the celestial abode, are subject to his authority and control. It was said of Jacob, that like a prince he had power with GOD and prevailed; but in how much more conspicuous light does the power∣ful intercession of JESUS appear in heaven? His <HI>blood</HI> is a powerful advocate for penitent sinners before the throne above! It speaks better things than the blood of the most dear and costly sacri∣fices! 'Tis that which opens a new and living way to the throne and affections of our heavenly
<PB N="51" REF="038552_0053_101258982F4A3768"/>
Father, and procures that for us which the riches a <HI>Croesus</HI> could never obtain.</P>
<P>It is a further evidence of the power which Christ has given him in heaven, that <HI>heaven</HI> itself is at his disposal. This is currently acknowledged in the sacred pages. PAUL declares his expectation of receiving a crown of righteousness, as <HI>the gift</HI> of his righteous judge. And JESUS himself promises a crown of life, and a participation of his glory, to those who overcome, by his blood, and remain faithful unto death.</P>
<P N="2">2. On <HI>earth</HI> also Christ has all power given unto him. The natural and moral world are sub∣ject to him. At his command the wheels of na∣ture roll;—the sun goeth forth from his cham∣ber, and as a giant rejoiceth to run his race;—the silver queen gilds the night, and the twinkling flames shine in their several orbits. But let us more particularly contemplate the power which he exer∣cises with regard to the <HI>rational</HI> creation. He has power given him over the heart of man, to change and make it new; to enlighten the dark under∣standing; to incline the stubborn and refractory disposition of the will; to bestow repentance unto life; and to raise the sinner, who is dead in tres∣passes and sins, to a new life of righteousness! In the days of his humiliation, he possessed the power
<PB N="52" REF="038552_0054_1012589AB21A9578"/>
of forgiving sin. On the cross this power was evinced in the pardon of the penitent thief; and now he is exalted at the right-hand of the Majesty on high: the apostle instructs us, that through him is preached unto us the forgiveness of sins. His power on earth is further evidenced in the support and protection of his church. How oft would she have perished in the waters of affliction, or been consumed in the flames of persecution, had she not been protected by his powerful arm! Although she is represented as fleeing into the wilderness from the face of the dragon, we behold her coming up again leaning on her beloved. Most gladly, there∣fore, may she endure and rejoice in her various af∣flictions, that the power of Christ may rest upon her: and, although many of the human race ac∣knowledge not the authority of Christ, nor bow to the sceptre of his grace, yet these also are subject to his power. The power of Satan itself is limited by the power of Jesus: nor can any of the powers of this world, in all their combinations, elude the con∣trol of HIM who doth all his sovereign will among the kingdoms of men; who, sitting in the heavens, holds all their malicious machinations in derision, will break them as with a rod of iron, and dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.</P>
<P N="3">3. This power Christ himself declares to be
<PB N="53" REF="038552_0055_1012589C5F808788"/>
<HI>given</HI> to him. But let not the sons of infidelity be premature in their triumphs on that account. As GOD, it is <HI>not</HI> given to him. The <HI>fulness</HI> of the GODHEAD dwelt bodily in him. He consequently, as such, possessed every divine perfection in the amplest and most independent manner. But as <HI>Me∣diator</HI> between GOD and man, we can easily con∣ceive how Jesus possessed this power as the gift of the Father. In <HI>this</HI> character he very frequently acknowledges the superiority of the Father: "My Father is <HI>greater</HI> than I." In this character, he confesses the instructions and commandments which he had received from his father relative to his office, and in this character also he expressly asserts the power he possessed. To his disciples who had con∣tinued with him in his temptation, he declared thus: "I <HI>appoint</HI> unto you a kingdom, <HI>as</HI> my Father hath appointed unto me." This is an instance of the power which Christ exercises in heaven. Now, the Father appointed his reward unto him as <HI>Medi∣ator,</HI> by covenant agreement, consequently his ap∣pointing a kingdom to his followers, <HI>as</HI> the Father appointed unto him must signify, that he made that appointment in the exercise of his mediatorial office. Another example of his exercising his power on earth as Mediator is recorded in the <HI>second</HI> Psalm. Solemnly inaugurated and proclaimed king of Zion,
<PB N="54" REF="038552_0056_101258A08DF5F1B0"/>
his reward for the discharge of his office, for which he is authorized to ask, is the heathen for an in∣heritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for a possession. And, at the same time, is vested with power to destroy those who submit not to his au∣thority! v. 8. The power, therefore, which he exercises in heaven and earth was <HI>given</HI> him, not as he was GOD, but as he was Mediator between GOD and man.</P>
<P>And, 4. In that character it was given him as the <HI>reward</HI> of his obedience and sufferings. Thus we are clearly instructed in several passages of the holy scriptures. ISAIAH declares, chap. liii. that al∣though his soul should be made an offering for sin, his days should be prolonged, and that he should be satisfied in seeing the travail of his soul. And PAUL more expressly declares, that on account of his voluntary humiliation, GOD hath highly exalt∣ed him, and given him a name above every name that is named, at which every knee should bow, in token of submission to his mediatorial authority.</P>
<P N="5">5. A few <HI>reflections</HI> shall close this short essay. And how <HI>consolatory</HI> is the idea of the Mediator's power in heaven and earth to the believing mind? Hence they defy, and rest safe and secure in the presence of the sharpest spite and rage of Satan and all his legions. God is for, who, therefore, can
<PB N="55" REF="038552_0057_101258A2274F85B8"/>
be <HI>against</HI> them? The power of Christ is their defence from all danger; and will be their security and their safeguard amidst all the surrounding af∣flictions and storms of life. But how <HI>alarming</HI> is the power of Christ to the impenitent! To them he appears in all the strength of his majesty; not as the Lamb of God, but as the lion of the tribe of Judah. Let us therefore seek, by a timely recon∣ciliation with him, to elude the fearfulness of his powerful displeasure. Let us "kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and we perish from the day when his wrath is kindled but a little."</P>

<HEAD>ANECDOTE OF THE KING OF HUN∣GARY.</HEAD>
<P>THIS king was extremely distressed on account of the sinful state of his soul, and appeared before his brother exceedingly dejected. His brother, the duke, insisted on knowing the reason; to whom the king replied, "O brother, I have been a great sinner against God, and I know not how to ap∣pear before his judgment-seat." The duke, a man of brisk gallantry, not unlike our modern free∣thinkers, replied, "These are but melancholy thoughts," and made light of them.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="038552_0058_101258A4CC88C550"/>
The king answered nothing at that time; but the custom of that country was, (the king being absolute) if the executioner sounded his trumpet at a man's door, he must instantly prepare for exe∣cution. The king sent the executioner at mid∣night, and caused him to sound a trumpet before the duke's door; who, hearing and seeing the messenger of death, ran, trembling, and fell up∣on his knees before the king, beseeching him to declare wherein he had offended him? "O, bro∣ther," said the king, "you never offended me, but loved me; but is the sight of an earthly executioner so terrible to thee, and shall not I, who am so great a sinner, fear much more to be brought be∣fore the judgment-seat of an angry God?"</P>

<HEAD>A TROPHY OF GRACE, OR THE THIEF SAVED UPON THE CROSS.</HEAD>
<HEAD>[Continued from page 44, and concluded.]</HEAD>
<P>HAVING treated on the saved thief upon the cross, No. 1. vol. ii. p. 44, we now proceed to offer such instruction as may be deduced from the subject.</P>
<P>I. Mark, the Evangelist, by this very remarkable scene on Calvary, leads us to see the literal fulfil∣ment
<PB N="57" REF="038552_0059_101258A6688630F8"/>
of prophecy. Isaiah saith, in chap. liii. 12. <HI>He was numbered with the transgressors.</HI> Mark xv. 28. In this instance, how great was the con∣descension of Immanuel! and, how significant was it of his office as a sin-bearer, Isa. liii. placed on the cross, between two, who, for their crimes, were hanging between the heavens and the earth, as outcasts from both? A lively representation of all mankind, who, by their sins, had robbed God of his honour in his law, and their own souls of im∣mortal bliss, in themselves suspended, by the brittle thread of life, between heaven and hell! And if Jesus saves his people from their sins, he must be num∣bered with them, and bear the awful curse in their stead. He did so. <HI>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hang∣eth on a tree, that the blessing of Abraham might come upon the Gentiles through Jesus Christ.</HI> Gal. iii. 13, 14.</P>
<P>II. In the conversion of the crucified thief we have a noble instance of Christ's free grace and power to save the chief of sinners, in the greatest sorrows, and at the latest period of their lives.</P>
<P>No man can attentively review this scene, but must believe the sovereignty of Christ's grace, how∣ever prepossessed in favour of human merit. Here
<PB N="58" REF="038552_0060_101258AA9FABD190"/>
are two men, both thieves; both condemned; both revilers of Christ; both suffering death upon the cross; both deserving God's wrath, and hastening to receive the just rewards of their deeds in awful eternity; yet, the one is taken, the other left. One soul is plucked as a brand from the burning, the other left to consume! Rich the mercy that reached the one: just the judgment that left the other. Will a professed Christian call this conduct of Christ in question? Surely he took one soul as a proof, that he came to save some; he left the other as a testimony that he should not save all. Therefore, let sinners in their sins tremble; and let those who have hope in their Saviour be cloathed with humility. One man dies wretched in his sins, in the very sight of Christ's blood-shedding; the other dies in peace, by virtue of the same blood, and looks for an endless Paradise! From this, as well as many other instances recorded in the scripture, we must be convinced, that man's supposed merit weighs nothing in the scale of salvation, though proud, fallen nature, would lift her head, and de∣mand an everlasting crown as her own reward.</P>
<P>As a farther proof of the total depravity of hu∣man nature, and its disdain of a complete salvation, in a crucified Christ, as exemplified in the impeni∣tent thief, I shall add, that, if he had possessed the
<PB N="59" REF="038552_0061_101258AC39422C30"/>
least degree of natural or moral ability to have saved himself, there were circumstances every way calculated to have drawn them forth. His state was equal with his fellow sufferers; he was nailed to the cross at the same time; his condemnation, by the law, the same; he equally felt the powers of approaching death; he saw the Saviour in his suf∣ferings, and heard his addresses; he hung the same time as did the other, upon the cross; they both out∣lived Christ, and both witnessed his last words; both saw the supernatural eclipse, and both felt the earth quake and tremble. All these things, which may amount to what some name calls opportunities, incitements to repentance, &amp;c. &amp;c. made no sort of impression upon the heart of the hardened thief, and left him the very same man that they found him.</P>
<P>It is evident, that the pardoned thief possessed ex∣ternal advantages superior to the other man; he was pointedly reproved by his fellow; he saw and heard the amazing moral change in his companion; he heard his pathetic prayer to the Saviour, for a remembrance in his kingdom; and he heard the Sa∣viour's promise of acceptance for future bliss;—all these passed under his eye, and penetrated his ear; yet the poor man, with all these advantages, remained hardened in his crimes; he addressed not
<PB N="60" REF="038552_0062_101258AEC3F2A2A8"/>
the Redeemer unless to revile him; he wished not to be honoured with his remembrance; no, nor go into a Paradise, if he must be indebted to a cru∣cified Christ for the favour. He lived, he suffered, he died in his sins! Let us not boast of human ex∣cellence, but be cloathed with humility. May we learn lessons of the deceit, the power, the stupefac∣tion of sin, and look to Christ for a free salvation! In the poor, hardened, wretched thief, see human nature in the perfection of its depravity: in the other, behold the free triumphant grace of Christ in its meridian glory!</P>
<P>I think I may venture to say, that this scene of Christ's grace on Calvary has its frequent likeness among mankind, in every age, and in every place where the gospel is preached. How many thou∣sands are there, who, for many years, set under the sound of the history and the truth of the gospel, <HI>be∣fore whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, as crucified among them.</HI> Gal. iii. 1. Yet, like the impenitent thief, they disdain and pe∣rish in their sins; while others, equally guilty and de∣praved, who feel the virtues of the cross, are brought nigh to God, live an honour to his name, and die triumphant, with heaven beaming upon their souls. Thus, the ministry of the gospel is a favour of life to some, and of death to others. 2 Cor. ii. 15—17.
<PB N="61" REF="038552_0063_101258B05F52A570"/>
The difference of success is resolved into the grace of Christ whom we serve:—<HI>By the grace of God, I am what I am!</HI></P>
<P>III. Let me ask my READERS if they feel the importance of these reflections, and are convinced of their need of Christ to save them? Remember, you need the same grace, mercy, power, and love, to save <HI>you</HI> as did the thief upon the cross. Proud nature will not submit to this. To be saved, wholly by the blood, the unmerited grace of Jesus, which reached the vile malefactor's heart that died upon Calvary, is not what you will submit to, until you have a just sight and an humbling sense of your depravity and guilt before an holy God! Then will you bow before the cross, while, with a believing eye, you behold the fountain of blood flowing from the Saviour's heart, to cleanse from foulest stains; yes, with <HI>Cowper</HI> you will say—
<Q><L>"The dying thief rejoic'd to see</L>
<L>That fountain in his day;</L>
<L>O may I there, though vile as he,</L>
<L>Wash all my sins away!"</L></Q></P>
<P>IV. To review this scene upon Calvary, as constituting a part of the TRIUMPHS of CHRIST, shall conclude our reflections. Our Lord entered upon the field of time, met sin, death, and hell, as
<PB N="62" REF="038552_0064_101258B493D59F18"/>
the foes of men, and, in order to conquer, he must die the death of the cross; there on, <HI>blotting out the hand writing of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross: and having spoiled prin∣cipalities, and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.</HI> Col. ii. 14, 15. He ascended up on high, led captivity captive, sat down on the Father's right-hand, and gave gifts unto men, that the Lord God might dwell among them. While on the cross, though reeking in his gore, behold! he plucks the thief from the jaws of destruction, embraces him in his bosom, and bears him to Paradise, as a trophy of his grace, and to show all heaven the virtue of his blood! Safe be∣yond the vale of death, united with the saints in glory, we congratulate the saved thief; who, in incessant strains, unites with patriarchs, prophets, apostles, and the numberless redeemed—<HI>Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that setteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb, for ever and ever!</HI></P>

<HEAD>REPLY to Y. Z. in our last Number—"<HI>When will Faith and Hope cease?</HI>" 1 Cor. xiii. 13.</HEAD>
<P>PAUL concludes his beautiful description of Charity in these words, <HI>Now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three: but the greatest of these is charity.</HI> 1 Cor. xiii. 13. There is manifestly a preference given to charity above faith and hope, chiefly because faith and hope shall have an end, but charity abideth for ever. Charity, or love, is the essence of religion and moral virtue. This, in a very considerable degree, forms the happiness of the christian in this, and in a future state of ex∣istence. It, therefore, stands foremost in the list of christian virtues. Faith and hope, though essen∣tial to the christian character, must, I conceive, have an end: To illustrate this, let me take St. Paul's description of faith, in Heb. xi. 1. <HI>Now, faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evi∣dence of things not seen.</HI> When, therefore, those <HI>things not seen</HI> become visible, and those <HI>things hoped for</HI> arrive, there can then be no further room for <HI>faith</HI> to exercise itself; it must, therefore, cease. The happiness of heaven appears to me to be what the apostle alludes to as <HI>hoped for.</HI> By the eye of faith, the christian sees a glorious salva∣tion
<PB N="64" REF="038552_0066_101258B8F109D540"/>
wrought out, and secured for him in Christ Jesus;—he believes, that after he shall have done serving his master in this lower world, in which <HI>he sees through a glass darkly,</HI> and where <HI>he knows but in part,</HI> he shall be admitted to the bright regions above, where dwelleth <HI>that which is per∣fect,</HI> and <HI>that which is in part shall be done away; where he will see face to face, and know, even as also he is known.</HI> When this period arrives, <HI>faith,</HI> agreeably to the above definition, must cease.</P>
<P>Another definition of faith, differing in words, though amounting to the same thing, is a firm re∣liance on the atonement and righteousness of the Redeemer for salvation and eternal glory. Consi∣dering <HI>faith</HI> in this sense, when does it cease? In my opinion it is when the soul is put in the actual possession of that state of felicity beyond the grave. But when shall <HI>hope</HI> be done away? Certainly when those things arrive to our enjoyment for which we are induced to hope; <HI>for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for.</HI> Rom. viii. 8. My opinion, in brief, therefore is, that <HI>faith</HI> shall cease in <HI>vision;</HI> and <HI>hope,</HI> which is our expecta∣tion of things future, shall be swallowed up in <HI>fruition.</HI> In the heavenly world there can be no room for the exercise of faith and hope; but <HI>cha∣rity</HI> alone abideth for ever.</P>

<HEAD>ANSWER BY ANOTHER HAND.</HEAD>
<HEAD>When shall Faith and Hope cease?</HEAD>
<P>NOT on the immediate departure of the soul from the body, though transmitted to the bosom of the Lord. Many things will remain as the subject of faith and the object of hope. <HI>Faith</HI> shall yet exercise her powers in the highest degree of per∣fection, without the shadow of a doubt, upon the purposes and reign of Christ the King of Zion, who will spread his kingdom from pole to pole—gather his elect unto himself—reign before his an∣cients gloriously—burn the universe by the breath of his mouth—dissolve the heavens—sit in final judgment—and receive his people, amidst the uni∣versal blaze, to the mansions of his glory. The pure Spirit, resting in the enjoyment of Christ above, shall yet exercise <HI>hope</HI> of the general resurrection, await the joyful period, and exclaim with David▪ <HI>My flesh shall rest in hope!</HI> Then, when the body shall be raised, made like unto the glorious body of the Lord Jesus, and re-united to the soul, both, in eternal union, shall be received to incon∣ceivable glory. Now sublunary objects are buried in oblivion—the world has vanished as the smoke—
<PB N="66" REF="038552_0068_101258BED322DD60"/>
the kingdom of Messiah is complete—the purposes of Jehovah towards his Church are accomplished—the kingdom is delivered unto the Father, and God himself is all in all: therefore, the objects of faith, and the subjects of hope, now issue in per∣fect enjoyment, and the virtues themselves are no longer useful, and for ever cease. But charity! the love of God, and of his saints! this abideth, and shall for ever abide; form the felicitating, innate principle of the glorified soul, and expand its powers in eternal admiration, joy and praise!</P>

<HEAD>NATURAL HISTORY.
<FIGURE>
<FIGDESC>depiction of a horse</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE>
THE HORSE.</HEAD>
<P>THE horse is a genus of quadrupeds, belonging to the order of belluae, in the class mammalia. The genus comprehends the horse, the ass, and tho zebra; they have six erect and parallel fore-teeth in the upper jaw, and six, somewhat prominent ones, in the under jaw; the dog teeth are solitary, and at a considerable distance from the rest; and the feet consist of an undivided hoof. The horse has not only a grandeur in his general appearance, but there is the greatest symmetry and proportion in the different parts of his body. The regularity and
<PB N="68" REF="038552_0070_101258C2E7058850"/>
proportion of the different parts of the head, give him an air of lightness, which is well supported by the strength and beauty of his chest. He erects his head as if willing to exalt himself above the condition of other quadrupeds: his eyes are open and lively; his ears are handsome and of a proper height; his mane adorns his neck, and gives him the appearance of strength and boldness.</P>
<P>To view this majestic animal we must look for him as nature has formed him, and placed him as an inhabitant of the extensive deserts of Africa, in Arabia; and in those vast countries that separate Tartary from the more southern nations. Large assemblies of these animals are seen among the Tar∣tars. Arabia produces a breed of horses, the most beautiful, generous, swift, and persevering. Their colour is brown, their mane and tail very short, their hair black and tufted: their swiftness is incre∣dible. The method of taking them is by traps concealed in the sand, which entangling their feet, the hunter approaches them, and either kills or takes them alive.</P>
<P>The horse, with us, is a domestic animal, and is trained up for the purpose of husbandry, the pleasure of the chace, and the service of the war∣rior; and, in each department, he proves himself a useful and magnanimous creature: admitting, at the
<PB N="69" REF="038552_0071_101258C58ACDCEE0"/>
same time, such a variety of stages, qualities, and circumstances, that the lower, as well as the higher orders of mankind, may avail themselves of the be∣nefit and the pleasures he is calculated to afford. To these observations let me add, that the benefi∣cent Creator hath so ordered, that the animal now under reflection should not only be capable of rendering the highest services to man while living, but that, after death, he should contribute to our ad∣vantage. His skin is used for traces, collars, and other parts of harness. Thus, even after death, he preserves some analogy to his state of servitude when alive.</P>
<P>The eastern heathens, the Persians, who wor∣shipped the sun, imagine that he rode along the sky in a chariot drawn with fleet horses, to com∣municate his light and warmth to mankind; they consecrated to him the finest steeds, with which, in chariots, they rode to the eastern gates of their cities, as the sun rose, to pay their adoration, and to offer their sacrifices. Other heathens offered the horse to Mars, as the god of battles. Tacitus is said to have supported white horses in the sacred woods, at the public charge, from which they drew omens: no one was even permitted to touch them; the prince and priest alone fasten them to a conse∣crated chariot accompanied them, and observed their neighings and tremblings.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="038552_0072_101258C8DF7EFD00"/>
Leaving the superstitions and idolatry of the hea∣then, let us glance at the sublime description of this noble animal, contained in the sacred writings. God, to humble the haughtiness of Job, and to bring him to a more solemn consciousness of the di∣vine wisdom and power in creation, thus addresseth him: <HI>Hast thou given the horse strength? Hast thou cloathed his neck with thunder? Canst thou make him afraid as a grass-hopper? The glory of his nostrils is terrible. He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he go∣eth on to meet the armed men. He mocketh at fear, and is affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword. The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and the shield. He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage; neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet. He saith among the trumpets, ha, ha, and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shoutings.</HI> Job xxxix. 19—25.</P>
<P>The callous, impenitent heart of the Jews, re∣gardless of the evil and the consequences of sin, are said to be as <HI>the horse that rusheth into the battle.</HI> Jer. viii. 6. Equally as thoughtless are those who precipitately rush before God in prayer, without realizing the infinite majesty of Jehovah; feeling the wretchedness of their depraved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ture, and con∣fiding
<PB N="71" REF="038552_0073_101258CA77D1BBE0"/>
in a Mediator for acceptance. And, although the real christian may sentimentally accord in the justness of these observations, in too many in∣stances, as it relates to his walk with God, his se∣cular concerns in the world, and in his public pro∣fession of the gospel, he may too often find himself guilty, and lament his precipitance.</P>
<P>It is not improper, in this place, to introduce the translation of Elijah to heaven in a <HI>chariot of fire,</HI> and by <HI>horses of fire.</HI> 2 Kings ii. 11. This ce∣lestial vehicle might be a conflux of exhalations or clouds, formed in this likeness by a supernatural power; and, by the solar rays striking on them, might appear fiery and red; much in the same manner as our Lord himself was taken up in a cloud. Acts i. 9. This idea on the chariot and horses of fire is considerably supported by the lat∣ter clause of the verse: <HI>and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.</HI>—The mode of Elijah's conveyance to heaven has, however, been more generally considered to have been by the ministry of Angels, whom <HI>God maketh a flame of fire.</HI> Psm. civ. 4. <HI>The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of Angels.</HI> Psm. lxviii. 17. Mr. Henry's remarks upon the subject are so pleasing I cannot forbear transcribing them. "Elijah must remove to the world of Angels; and,
<PB N="72" REF="038552_0074_101258CD31607120"/>
therefore, to show how desirous they were of his company, they would come and fetch him. The chariot and horses appeared like fire, not for burn∣ing, but brightness; not to torture and consume, but to render his ascension conspicuous and illustrious in the eyes of those who stood afar off to view it. Elijah had burned with holy zeal for God and his honour; and now, with a heavenly fire, he was refined and translated."</P>
<P>The spouse, the church of Christ, are compared to a <HI>company of horses in Pharoah's chariot;</HI> Sol. Song i. 9. not as ranging in the woods, nor prancing in battle, but paired, harnassed, drawing with unifor∣mity, steadfastness and allegiance, displaying the wis∣dom and magnificence of their Lord. It is to be con∣fessed, that the credit and the comfort of religion de∣pend very much upon a steady profession; <HI>if ye love me, keep my commandments.</HI> The present age of christianity is attended with too great an indifference to the positive precepts of the gospel, and the ordi∣nance which Christ hath graciously appointed in his church; and I cannot but consider that, among the many baneful consequences of such unstead∣fastness, is the triumph of infidelity. Let us, there∣fore, hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; for God is faithful, who hath promised, and he will never leave nor forsake us.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="038552_0075_101258CECF7181A8"/>
We shall conclude our reflections on this part of natural history, by adverting to the book of Revelations, in which the HORSE is repeatedly men∣tioned. <HI>The white horse,</HI> says Dr. Gill, on which the crowned conqueror rode, expressed the pure and uncorrupted gospel, which, with speed, was to be carried unto all nations, for the important purposes of converting sinners, increasing the visible empire of Christ, and diffusing the most sublime happiness. <HI>The red horse</HI> denoted the persecutions, wars, and bloodshed, which the publication of the gospel of peace, which is contrary to the depraved appe∣tite of mortals, and to worldly empire, would un∣doubtedly procure against the saints and servants of the Lord. <HI>The black horse,</HI> the errors which should make rapid progress against the truth of Christ. <HI>The pale horse,</HI> on which sat Death, denoted the gradual destruction of sin, superstition, and every enemy that should war against the Lord and his church; especially describing the present sickly state of the Romish church, and its secular powers.</P>
<P>How blessed will that period be, when, accord∣ing to the prediction of Zachariah, HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD <HI>shall be written upon the bells of the horses.</HI> xiv. 20. The war-horse shall no more tread the field of blood to gratify the rider's lust for revenge or power. The animal created in

<P>THE habit of sleeping during the public worship of Almighty God, must be pronounced worthy of censure; and could sober reasoning operate on such a person, he would soon be reclaimed.

His <HI>manners!</HI> he ought certainly to re∣spect the company present: what an offensive rude∣ness, carelessly to sit down and sleep in their pre∣sence! His <HI>gratitude</HI> to the minister for his at∣tempts to instruct him in the things that make for

Above all, where is his <HI>piety to God!</HI> to sleep on the very spot appointed for so∣lemn worship, when all in the place, except him∣self, may be devoutly engaged in prayer and in praise?</P>
<P>Ministers have tried a number of methods to rid our churches of this odious practice. Some have reasoned—others have elevated their voice to the highest pitch: some I have known to call upon the children in the gallery to keep perfect silence lest they awake their sleeping parents below, while other preachers have threatened to name the sleeper, and has actually done so. Some have been so ex∣asperated at their sleeping hearers as to cry aloud, Fire! fire!—others have been so deeply affected as to close their lips, and sit down. Dr. Young, on beholding these sleepy disturbers of worship, sat down and wept! Bishop Abbot took out his Testament and read Greek. Each of these awak∣ed their audience for the time; but the destruction of the <HI>habit</HI> belongs to the sleeper himself; and, if neither reason nor religion can excite him, why, he must, I think, sleep on till death and judgment awake him!!</P>

<HEAD>Mr. ROMAINE'S Advice, how to become a better Scholar in the School of Christ.</HEAD>
<P>READ and pray for more <HI>self-knowledge.</HI> God's word and spirit will teach you nothing about yourself, but what will humble you to the dust, and keep you there. Read and pray for more know∣ledge of the person of Jesus, God-man; his sal∣vation work infinitely and everlastingly perfect; he is yours, now he is received, and all he has, and all he is, as Jesus, yours in title, and, so far as you believe, yours now in possession.</P>
<P>Read and pray for more <HI>faith,</HI> that what you have a title to you may take possession of, and so make constant use of it. Your estate is great, im∣mensely great. Use it and live up to it: as you do in temporals, so do in spirituals. Your money, your land, your air, your light, your meet and drink, and house and cloathing, these you use: but you have them not <HI>in</HI> you; only being yours, they are used <HI>by</HI> you. So do with Christ. When the spirit would glorify Jesus, he humbles you. When he would glorify his fulness, he makes you feel your emptiness. When he would bring you to rely on his strength, he convinces you of your weakness. When he would magnify the comforts
<PB N="77" REF="038552_0079_101258D9A91401A8"/>
of Jesus, he makes you sensible of your misery. When he would fix your heart on his heaven, he makes you feel your deserved hell. When he would exalt his righteousness, you find you are a poor miserable sinner.</P>
<P>Can you, my friend, practise this? Let nothing keep you from Jesus. Whatever you need, what∣ever you feel wrong, may it bring you to the Sa∣viour's fulness! O that all things may help for∣ward your acquaintance with him! I except no∣thing, neither sin nor sorrow: I would carry all to him, as one great lump of sin, and receive all good from him, as the only store-house of good for wretched sinners. In this communion I desire to grow; for this I desire to live. O that you and I may learn it more, and get every day nearer fel∣lowship with our sweet Jesus, growing up unto him in all things!</P>
<P>On our learning this lesson depends our com∣fortable walk heavenwards. Every moment we must live upon Christ's fulness, and be every mo∣ment receiving out of it grace for grace. A beg∣gar in myself, but rich with unsearchable, eternal riches in Jesus. Ignorant still in myself, but led and taught by his unerring wisdom. A sinner still, but believing in his blood and righteousness. Weak and helpless still, but kept by his Almighty love,

Nothing but sorrow in myself; nothing but joy in him. Oh! this is a blessed life. No tongue can tell what a heaven it is, thus to live by faith on the Son of God. Thanks be to him that I know a little of it, and I cannot but heartily pray that you may know more of it than ever you did. Bles∣sings forever on the Lamb!</P>

<HEAD>An original Letter addressed to the late Mr. JOHN YOUNG, while under Sentence of Death for the Murder of RICHARD BARWICK.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>UNDER your afflictive state, give me leave to address you a few lines: not to insult your misery, but to aid your necessary reflection. If reflection becomes a rational mind; if it be, indeed, necessary for any man, it must be so to you, in your near approach to dissolution. I said, I did not mean to insult your misery; no, I am conscious of the uni∣versal depravity of man: the seeds of iniquity lie deep in all, and, if any are preserved from open, gross offences, it is by superior aid than man's. With you, though you are now found a public sinner, I would drop a tear, and offer my warm
<PB N="79" REF="038552_0081_101258DEA173CFF0"/>
advice, to promote your deep reflection and repent∣ance.</P>
<P>Were I a DEIST, and with such believed, that "human crimes are only injurious to our species," from this I would attempt to excite your keen re∣flection. You have, in a sudden, violent and public manner, deprived a fellow mortal of his natural existence; whose life must have been to him as desirable, sweet, and important as your own; and life is indeed a blessing highly prized, and sacred to us all. By this unhappy deed you must have in∣jured your own peace, interest, reputation, and happiness. You have at once deprived a wife of an husband, and <HI>nine</HI> children of a father. With violent hands you have taken from the community a member, a citizen, and an officer in the very act of discharging his duty. And, I need not add, you have been found guilty of violating the most important, and the highest law of nature, and of the country, at the vast expence of your own life, in the most ignominious manner. And are not these human offences of the highest magnitude? Have not all civilized nations marked them with the highest degree of punishment? And do they not appear flagrant in your own eyes? Let others entertain what opinion they may of you, I am willing to hope, the wound given to another gapes
<PB N="80" REF="038552_0082_101229F802612568"/>
wide in your own breast. To be guilty of such crimes, and to be within sight of a shameful death, and not to feel conscious guilt, cannot be consider∣ed to act the <HI>part of man.</HI> Let me, therefore, in∣treat you to exercise rationality, and review the sable train of complicated evils which follow your offence. O that you may keenly feel the guilt that covers you, and repent in deepest sorrow! Remember your crimes are such as admit not the shadow of reparation; you cannot restore the <HI>life</HI> you have taken; you cannot place the <HI>husband</HI> in the <HI>widow'</HI>s arms; give to the numerous <HI>children</HI> their lost <HI>father,</HI> nor bring back the <HI>citizen</HI> to <HI>society.</HI> No; neither can you offer restitution to the law of nature, and the law of man, for un∣provoked murder, which peremptorily demands BLOOD FOR BLOOD!! How serious, how dis∣tressing is your case! Were there no God; were there no divine law to bind you to the authority of HIM who made you; were there no futurity, no punishment beyond the vale of death, your state demands serious reflection, and conscious grief.</P>
<P>But, my fellow mortal, ten thousand evidences pronounce the existence of an independent, holy, righteous BEING; the first cause, and the last end of all things; and to whom <HI>you</HI> and <HI>I</HI> are equally amenable. This throws a still more solemn shade
<PB N="81" REF="038552_0083_101258E56C5D6048"/>
upon you. The providence of this unerring God now surrounds you, as with a net of iron, and binds you over unto death. The hand of this God is upon you: O that you may feel it, producing conviction and repentance. Attempt not to stifle conviction of your accountability to God. Re∣member one conviction of conscience; the least struggle against the powers of death not only indi∣cates eternity to man, but pronounces, in loud ac∣cents, the certainty of a judgment to come, and to which you are now hastening. The sins you have committed are not against your own species <HI>only,</HI> but against the God who made you. Dare you say the man whom you murdered was not a creature of the Almighty, brought into existence, nourished, supported by HIM? If so, was it not an high offence against that God, intentionally and violently to deprive his creature of life; thereby defacing the divine workmanship, and attempting to overturn the government of your God? Was not this taking the right of government into your own hand, and as much as to say, the life of the man was at your disposal? That God against whom you have sinned, has declared, <HI>Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed; for in the image of God made he man.</HI> Gen. ix. 6. And, you know, Sir, this precept has
<PB N="82" REF="038552_0084_101258E7090A7FB8"/>
been solemnly obeyed by all civilized nations for some thousand years. You cannot be disposed to controvert another sentence selected from the same ancient records, <HI>That no murderer hath eter∣nal life abiding in him.</HI> 1 John iii. 15. For, had you possessed the fear of the Lord, you durst not have committed the foul offence. No, you follow∣ed the cultivated, wicked propensities of your own heart, and cherished the temptations of the devil, therefore you awfully fell. May God solemnize your breast, and make you feel and lament your case! Condemned by the laws of God and man, death with horror awaiting you; the doors of eternity unfolding to receive you; and the incon∣ceivable solemn tribunal of Jehovah prepared for your final appearance! The sentence, O how shall I transcribe it! <HI>Murderers shall have their part in the lake that burneth with fire and brim∣stone, which is the second death.</HI> Rev. xxi. 8.</P>
<P>My dear Sir, construe not this faithful estimate of your case as intended to insult your wretched∣ness. Far from it; I feel for you, and wish you to feel for yourself. Great sins need great convic∣tion, and great repentance. Think seriously of your state. The hardened, the abandoned alone would stifle reflection at such a time as yours. I have read of a felon who laughed at the fate of
<PB N="83" REF="038552_0085_101258E8A1A78E08"/>
the gallows; but, when the officer advanced to measure him for a <HI>coffin,</HI> he trembled, turned pale, and wept.</P>
<P>But shall I aid your reflection, to realize your guilt, and not tell you of a pardon? Shall I open the ghastly wound in your breast, and not point to you an adequate balm? True, the law of your country cannot save you; the law of nature con∣demns you; no mortal can pluck you from the jaws of destruction: yet, there is an hand able and mighty to save; there is a pardon adequate to your offence; there is a balm sufficient to heal—JESUS, the Son of God, died for men—for sinners—for his very <HI>murderers;</HI> and, as recorded in Acts ii. three thousand Jews, accessary to the death of Christ, were brought to conviction, repentance, and salvation, through the very blood which they had shed!

<HEAD>OBITUARY.</HEAD>
<P>ON Lord's-day evening, October 29, 1797, died the Rev. CHRISTOPHER GODFEY PETER, min∣ister of the Moravian Church, in New-York.</P>
<P>Mr. Peter was born <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Greslow, Lower Silisia, in the dominions of the king of Prussia. His fa∣ther was a physician; and Mr. Peter enjoyed the affectionate care of his parents until the seventh year of his age; at which time he lost his mother by death. His father's second marriage proved to Mr. Peter a source of disquietude, as his step-mo∣ther was to him so inattentive as to induce his fa∣ther to place him at a distant seminary, for his edu∣cation; where he abode with excellent moral repu∣tation till his sixteenth year, when he underwent the affliction of his father's death. Mr. Peter en∣tered the university of Konigsberg, where he pur∣sued his studies until his nineteenth year, and then was admitted a preacher in the Lutheran church. After preaching some time among this denomina∣tion, he, with several other young ministers, were brought under very severe exercises of mind, least they should professedly have preached to others; while their own souls were destitute of <HI>the one
<PB N="94" REF="038552_0096_10125900F07BB670"/>
thing needful.</HI> While in this state of painful sen∣sibility, they heard of the Rev. Augustus Gottlieb Spangenberg, a very aged, venerable minister of the United Brethren, or Moravian Church: to him they repaired, and from his lips they were inform∣ed, "that if ever their burthens were removed, and their souls made happy, it must be by a believing sight of a dear, crucified Redeemer, and who must be to them their <HI>all, and in all.</HI>" Relief was conveyed to their hearts: they found happiness by believing in Christ; and, through their connection with this venerable minister, they gave the princi∣ples of the Moravian Church an investigation, en∣tered as members, and, in due time, were appoint∣ed to the ministry.</P>
<P>In the year 1786 Mr. Peter received a call to England, and took up his residence at Fulneck, in Yorkshire, as a minister, and a teacher of lan∣guages. August 12, 1791, he entered into mar∣riage with Miss Sarah Bailey, his present mourning relict, by whom he had two children, now living. In the same year he came to America, and was or∣dained by the Rev. Andrew Huebner, Bishop of the Moravian Church, and then resided for some∣time at Hebron, exercising his ministerial office. October, 1793, he was stationed with the Moravian Church in this city; where, with the approbation
<PB N="95" REF="038552_0097_101259036C748228"/>
and joy of his church, he affectionately discharged the duties of his ministry, until the Lord removed him by death.</P>
<P>The manner, and the success attending the la∣bours of Mr. Peter, I leave to the more competent decision of the people of his charge. As my con∣nection with him, as a friend, commenced soon after his settlement in New-York, and, though of a different religious denomination to myself, having enjoyed in him, to the moment of his death, the sweets of friendship, this OBITUARY is composed by the EDITOR, as a small testimony of his esteem for Mr. Peter.</P>
<P>Never, perhaps, did a man sustain a literary, or ministerial character, with greater undissembl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d humanity. His bowels yearned over the miseries of the poor; and in one instance, known to myself, he could give himself no rest until he procured re∣lief for a necessitous family. Great was his desire for the spread of the gospel throughout the world, and often he would express his wish, if the Lord pleased, to preach to the unenlightened heathen. Every good man, of every religious denomination, found a place in his heart. This city is indebted to Mr. Peter, as a useful man. He was one of the first who meditated the plan, and was zealously engaged in establishing the present existing society,
<PB N="96" REF="038552_0098_10125905EEFAB3F0"/>
entitled, "The New-York Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge and Piety among the Poor, by the Gift of Bibles and other Religious Books."</P>
<P>But the most useful life must have an end. On the close of the last year, he seemed to have some forebodings, that he should soon drop his clay. Nature gradually appeared to break away; but, it was visible to those around him, that he was often indulged in sweet communion with his Lord. His pillow appearing wet, it was soon discovered to be with his own tears. On being asked the cause of his grief, he replied, "No∣thing grieved him; he was only enjoying nearness to his dear Saviour; that he could lay himself, his wife, his children, and the church upon his dear Redeemer's heart." At last, upon that heart he died, in serene submission, and expressive hope, that his soul should meet his Lord in realms of endless bliss!</P>
<P>Mr. Peter was cut down in the prime of his days, being only in the thirty-seventh year and fourth month of his age. Mrs. Peter, with her two infants, retired to Bethlehem, where the benevo∣lence of the United Brethren have provided a house and every agreeable accommodation, for the recep∣tion of their ministers' widows and children. An expression this of christian love, highly worthy the imitation of every religious denomination.</P>

<HEAD>An ESSAY ON THE LIGHT OF LIFE FROM CHRIST JESUS SHINING INTO THE DARK MIND OF MAN.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>Light of those whose dreary dwelling</L>
<L>Borders on the shades of death;</L>
<L>Come! and thy dear self revealing,</L>
<L>Dissipate the clouds beneath.</L>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SCRIPTURE, and the conduct of mankind, evince, that <HI>the way of the wicked is as dark∣ness: they know not at what they stumble.</HI> Prov.
<PB N="98" REF="038552_0100_1012590A0A107A20"/>
iv. 19. Ignorance and danger attend the evil path of man; nor is the boasted lamp of reason suffi∣cient to direct the soul to peace, and future bles∣sedness beyond the grave. <HI>There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof is death.</HI> Prov. xiv. 12. A new light—a light that shall overcome, and chase away, the gross dark∣ness from the mind, now becomes absolutely ne∣cessary; and such a light the gospel announces to proceed from Christ, the Son of God: <HI>In him was life, and the life was the light of men; the true light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</HI> John i. 4, 9. Jesus said, <HI>I am come a light unto the world, that whosoever be∣lieveth in me should not abide in darkness.</HI> John xii. 46.</P>
<P>While, in this essay, we attempt, in some hum∣ble manner, to explain the excellence of that light which flows from a life-giving Saviour, may its ce∣lestial rays shine upon the writer and upon the reader, to conduct their feet in paths of bliss!</P>
<P>I. It is pure, celestial light—a light from hea∣ven. Not a spark of our own creating, or that blazed forth from under the dust and ashes of fal∣len nature; but <HI>cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variableness, nei∣ther shadow of turning.</HI> James i. 17. <HI>That God
<PB N="99" REF="038552_0101_1012590BA5619480"/>
which caused the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jesus Christ.</HI> 2 Cor. iv. 6. Saul of Tarsus felt the force of this light upon his soul, on his journey to Damascus. <HI>I saw, in the way, a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me.</HI> Acts xxvi. 13. Many years had he philosophically contemplated the majesty and glory of the sun in the firmament, and its light shone upon his natural path: but here is a light falling round him of a different, more brilliant, penetrating nature—a supernatural, celestial light, unknown to him before—the rising of Jesus, <HI>the Sun of Righteousness, with healing in his beams,</HI> to create a new day of mercy upon his soul. This event, Paul informs us, took place <HI>at mid-day.</HI> How transcendently great must have been the ap∣pearance of Jesus, to cast the meridian sun into a shade! Little did Saul think, when, in the exces∣sive madness of his zeal, rising early with the sun, to go to Damascus, to persecute and to destroy the christian flock, that Jesus, the <HI>Chief Shepherd,</HI> would so miraculously meet him on the road, change the purposes of his heart, and give him a commission to feed the very souls he was pursuing unto blood! What a change is here! The light
<PB N="100" REF="038552_0102_1012590FE67D3DB0"/>
shining on the dark chaos of nature, to produce the beauties and riches of creation, but faintly re∣sembles the superior light of grace, falling upon the dark, depraved soul of Saul of Tarsus, to pro∣duce the beauties of virtue and true holiness! In this light he saw himself, his Saviour and his God; and, from this light upon his mind, he afterwards wrote and preached to others. Not Paul alone, but all who set in darkness, and in the shadow of death, need to receive this light, to guide them to everlasting peace. This heavenly light discovers to us the evil of our corrupt natures: we see the transgressions of our past lives in a new and con∣vincing manner: the law of God, in its spirituality, extent, demands, and inflexibility, appears in its august glory! and in this heavenly light we behold, through the written word, the torments of hell! Happy for the sinner, that this light never falls upon his heart, to show him his danger, and then to leave him to perish. No: it guides him into the way of salvation in Christ, as worthy of God, as it is suited to his own soul. <HI>I am the way, the truth and the life,</HI> saith the Lord: <HI>no man cometh to the Father but by me.</HI> John xiv. 6. The en∣lightened mind now perceives the difference be∣tween knowing Christ as <HI>a</HI> Saviour, and embrac∣ing him as <HI>his</HI> Saviour—<HI>professing</HI> the gospel, and
<PB N="101" REF="038552_0103_1012591183858510"/>
of <HI>possessing</HI> its celestial virtues! What delight to a believing soul, to call to remembrance the days of illumination—the happy resurrection morn to his soul, when Jesus, the Sun of Righteousness, arose and shone upon him! It was, indeed, <HI>as the light of the morning when the sun riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass, springing out of the earth by clear shining, after rain.</HI> 2 Sam. xxiii. 4. Glory be to GOD MOST HIGH, for sending forth this heavenly light to fall upon any sinner's heart! and glory be the riches of God's grace, if the writer and the reader can say, <HI>He hath delivered us from the power of darkness, into the kingdom of his dear Son!</HI> Col. i. 13.</P>
<P N="2">2. The light of Christ is attractive. <HI>I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</HI> John viii. 12. <HI>They looked unto him, and were lightened; and their faces were not asham∣ed.</HI> Psa. xxxiv. 5. <HI>In thy light shall we see light.</HI> Psa. xxxvi. 9. As the flowers of the garden, after being closed through the darkness and the tempest of the night, expand their leaves on the rising sun, follow his course by turning to his beams, and emit their fragrance—so the believing soul, through the darkness of affliction and the storm of tempta∣tion,
<PB N="102" REF="038552_0104_101259131D62EB30"/>
equally opens to receive the genial, animating rays of THE SUN OF RIGHTEOUSNESS, and most cheerfully follows him in all his holy ways. Nothing will spiritually engage the heart of man, but the shining of the light of Christ! Ministers, with their various gifts, may please, and engage the attention of the hearers; but, after all, they are but as the branches of a spreading tree, through which the light of life must shine, to quicken and attract the souls beneath. The poor cottager, though clothed in rags, yet enriched with grace, may receive the attraction of Christ's light, as the most distinguished monarch upon earth, with a star upon his breast. So free are the rays of Christ's love and grace to his people! Generally we find more sensibility and happiness, in Christ, beneath the poor man's tent, than in the rich man's palace.</P>
<P N="3">3. The light of life, in Christ, is real. It is ex∣pressly called <HI>the true light,</HI> John i. 9. in opposi∣tion to the false lights of depraved reason—the doctrines of carnal men—to the morality of hea∣then—and to vain superstition: especially as being the reverse to our native false light, by which we were guided into erroneous notions of God, Christ, sin, grace, heaven, and hell. It is no phantom or airy imagination—no heated enthusi∣asm—
<PB N="103" REF="038552_0105_101259168CC034B8"/>
but sincere, solid, heavenly, and divine; ne∣ver resting short of communion with God, as the centre of joy in the soul! Its truth is evident from its own purity; leading the subject of it from the practice of sin to the love of holiness. It never did, nor can, deceive the soul on which it shines. It as clearly discovers to a man's soul the nature and permanency of his interest in Christ—his right to the rich treasure of grace—and to a bliss∣ful immortality—as the light of the natural sun discovers the objects around us, of which we have no doubt nor hesitation. From this certain hea∣venly light shining upon the heart, Paul could only say, <HI>I know in whom I have believed.</HI> 2 Tim. i. 12. <HI>I am persuaded that neither death nor life</HI> (with all their attendant sufferings) <HI>shall never separate me from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus.</HI> Rom. viii. 38, 39. Since, therefore, this illumination is so great a privilege, and so rich a blessing, never let us rest until the <HI>Lord lift up upon us the light of his countenance, and be gracious unto us!</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. We may, therefore, add, in the language of the preacher, <HI>Truly light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun.</HI> Ecc. xi. 7. The young man born blind, cured by Christ, and poor Bartimeus, healed through the same means,
<PB N="104" REF="038552_0106_10125919EA9AF798"/>
could well attest the truth of this remark. To re∣ceive such a cure naturally is a great blessing; but to have the eyes of the soul opened is infinitely greater! No words can convey a satisfactory idea of light to a blind man: but when the eyes are opened, there needs no words to describe; it bears its own evidence. We may talk of the ex∣cellent properties of the light of Christ to carnal minds, but they cannot understand: <HI>they love dark∣ness rather than light, because their deeds are evil:</HI> but no sooner are the eyes of a sinner opened, than the light of Christ, bringing salvation to his heart, makes it both <HI>sweet and pleasant.</HI> To contem∣plate the person, office, and glory of Christ, in the light of life—to feel this heavenly light so beaming upon the heart as to draw forth heavenly desires, hopes and affections—what can make us so happy while on earth?</P>
<P>To conclude this essay, let us examine if this light has ever visited our hearts. Night and day are not greater opposites in the natural world, than a state of unregeneracy and grace are in the moral world. If ever you have been made <HI>light in the Lord,</HI> you must certainly remember, that <HI>you were some time darkness.</HI> Eph. v. 8. Should you be sensible of your blindness, and, like Bartimeus, set by the high-way side, begging—<HI>Lord that I may
<PB N="105" REF="038552_0107_1012591B884D7530"/>
receive my sight,</HI> you may take encouragement; for none that ever cried to Jesus were unanswered; none that ever came to him were cast out. Or, should the reader, after many years enjoyment of the light of Christ, have lost the comfort of it, and, like Job, <HI>go mourning without the sun,</HI> Job xxx. 28. remember that some intervening cloud, from the corruption of your heart or the errors of your life, has deprived you of your privilege. <HI>In God is no darkness at all.</HI> 1 John i. 5. It comes from yourself. Try to search your hearts, and mourn over the cause. Remember, <HI>Darkness may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morn∣ing.</HI> That grace which God hath planted in your heart will nor let you rest as you are, nor let go your hope in Christ as the light of your soul. With the amiable Mrs. Rowe, you can say,
<Q><L>He is my Sun, though he refuse to shine;</L>
<L>Though, for a moment, he depart,</L>
<L>I dwell for ever on his heart,</L>
<L>For ever he on mine!</L></Q>
<HI>Why then art thou cast down, O my soul, and why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God, for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance.</HI> Psa. xlii. 5.</P>
<P>If the light of life from Christ be so sweet to the
<PB N="106" REF="038552_0108_1012591E05CDAC08"/>
heart, and so pleasant to the eyes, in this earthly state, where we have so many intervening clouds, such dark and dreary days, and such storms and tempests to fill our skies;—what joy and blessedness may we not cheerfully hope to enjoy when trans∣mitted to immortality! where every tint of iniquity is done away; where no sorrow enters; and where GOD and the LAMB become the eternal LIGHT of the blessed! In anticipation of this state, let every believing heart and tongue cry, <HI>Come Lord Jesus, come quickly! Amen.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ANECDOTE.</HEAD>
<P>A MERCHANT of Antwerp, named JOHN DEANS, having lent some millions of money to the Emperor Charles the fifth, begged him to do him the honour of coming to dine with him. The Emperor, loth to refuse on account of the obliga∣tion under which he was, accepted the offer, and went to his house at the time appointed. The mer∣chant spared nothing to gratify his royal guest; and, animated with a generosity rarely to be met with, caused fire to be set to a pile of cinnamon; and, taking the bond which his majesty had given him as a security for his money, threw it into the flames, saying, SIRE, YOU ARE NOW OUT OF
<PB N="107" REF="038552_0109_1012592088F810F8"/>
MY DEBT. Could the Emperor ever have forgot∣ten such an unexpected, unprecedented act of friendship? Impossible!</P>
<P>Much less possible is it for that man who truly knows the LORD JESUS CHRIST, to forget his unparalleled kindness and unsearchable grace! Vast the debt we have contracted—infinite in number and malignity, by transgressing the good law of our ALMIGHTY CREATOR. Yet such was the condescension and astonishing love of JESUS, that he willingly offered his own body and soul, infi∣nitely more precious than all the spices of the east to the fire of Divine anger, to obliterate the bond of our obligation unto God! Or, as the apostle charmingly expresses this amazing transaction—<HI>Blotting out the hand-writing of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross; and having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.</HI> Col. ii. 14, 15.</P>
<P>With what astonishment must the Emperor have beheld the ashes of his consumed obligation! How free the royal breast from this vast debt! Who now, therefor, can make a second claim? Yet, still greater amazement, and more solid peace, may possess our souls, while beholding Jesus cancelling
<PB N="108" REF="038552_0110_10125923E4AFF3D8"/>
our obligatory bond to God, by his own bloody sacrifice! The debt paid—salvation complete—justice satisfied—heaven smiles! Only the <HI>ashes</HI>—the ashes of our corrupt, fallen, disabled nature, remains; and this purposely to remind us, in time, of what our Saviour hath done; so that, <HI>in those days, and in that time, saith the Lord, the ini∣quity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I reserve.</HI> Jer. 1. 20.</P>
<P>Let, therefore, the Emperor Charles forget the act of the merchant at Antwerp; and let his royal lips withhold the praises of his generous creditor; but let us incessantly publish the honour due to IMMANUEL, who not only hath paid our im∣mense debt in his own blood, but freely conferreth upon us those <HI>durable, unsearchable riches,</HI> which constitute our present and eternal felicity!</P>

<HEAD>Answer to the Query proposed in our last Number, page 84, by D. H. "Whether Adam, in his Primitive State, possessed the Grace of Faith." We offer the following Observations.</HEAD>
<P>IF by "the grace of faith," that <HI>faith</HI> be intend∣ed which the gospel defines—<HI>the fruit of the Spi∣rit,</HI>
<PB N="109" REF="038552_0111_1012592582F48FB0"/>
Gal. v. 22. <HI>which is obtained through the righteousness of God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ</HI>—2 Pet. i. 1. is connected with, and demon∣strative of, the <HI>salvation</HI> of the soul, as the free, unconditional, gracious gift of God—Eph. ii. 8. if this <HI>faith</HI> is intended, then we are of opinion that Adam, in his primitive state, had it not. Adam then was in a state of moral purity; he had not sinned; nor does it appear that he had the fore∣knowledge of his fall by transgression; conse∣quently, he stood in no need of that faith which embraces a saviour, nor the experience of gospel grace which is revealed to the sensibly guilty and condemned; however, it might have been in secret counsel with God, prepared for him.</P>
<P>If by the "grace of faith," is only meant Adam's confidence in God's promise for his pre∣servation and supply, we must accord generally with that opinion. Such sort of faith, or trust, we consider as a constituent part in the moral con∣stitution of our first parents; and by which they walked with God, and enjoyed the most delightful satisfaction in the productions of Eden. Without this faith, we cannot believe infinite wisdom would have pronounced his workmanship of humanity, <HI>very good.</HI></P>
<P>We cannot, however, but consider it injudicious
<PB N="110" REF="038552_0112_1012592835819DD8"/>
to call Adam's faith, the "grace of faith;" the term being unscriptural, and tending to confound the two great and glorious dispensations of nature and of grace. While Adam was in Paradise, he knew God only as God of universal nature, and enjoyed him in that relation. That which our correspondent D. H. denominates "the grace of faith," is certainly a blessing which flows from a new constitution of things, founded upon the cove∣nant of grace, and forms a material part of the <HI>new creature in Christ Jesus;</HI> by which the saved sinner enjoys God as his everlasting father in Christ, the fruit of adopting grace and love.</P>
<P>After Adam's recovery, we believe that he had pure gospel faith in Christ, the promised Messiah; the seed of the woman, who should bruise the ser∣pent's head. Gen. iii. And, that his subsequent walk with God, his worship by sacrifice, his general obedience, was as fully centered in Christ's future atonement and satisfaction, as did the faith of Paul, Peter, John, or any subject of converting grace, in any period of the gospel dispensation.</P>
<P>The difference, therefore, of these two sorts of faith, cannot be too accurately marked; the one of nature, the other of grace; one pertaining to a pure, sinless creature, the other to such as are re∣stored by regenerating, converting, persevering
<PB N="111" REF="038552_0113_10125929F56BF6E0"/>
grace. We hope, therefore, that these observa∣tions may be instructive to our readers, and to D. H. in particular.</P>

<FIGDESC>depiction of a stag</FIGDESC>
</FIGURE>
THE STAG,</HEAD>
<P>OR dear, <HI>Cervus,</HI> in tetrapodology, is the name of a genus of animals, the characters of which are like those of the goat kind; they chew the cud; but they differ in this, that they shed their horns, which are internally solid, every year. If we
<PB N="112" REF="038552_0114_1012592E2FB086D0"/>
consider their structure, and compare them with the goat or the ox, we shall find, what will at first appear strange, that they more resemble the latter than the former. The ox and the stag differ rather in their grossness and slenderness, than in any other anatomical distinction: the skeleton of either is nearly alike; the internal conformation is nearly the same; except that the deer kind want the gall-bladder; their kidneys are also formed dif∣ferently; and their spleen is proportionably larger. Such are the slight internal discriminations between two animals, one of which is among the swiftest, and the other among the heaviest of the brute cre∣ation. The stag is one of those innocent animals which nature has made to embellish the park, and animate the solitude of the grove. Its colour is, generally, of a reddish brown; but differs accord∣ing to the climate he inhabits. The stag has the most beautiful eye; and his senses of smelling and hearing, are in no less perfection. Should a per∣son, at some distance, whistle, or call aloud, the stag stops short immediately in his slow pace, and gazes on the intruder; and if he perceives neither dogs nor any instrument of destruction levelled at him, he then proceeds forward without any emo∣tion of fear. Man, indeed, is not the enemy he is most afraid of; on the contrary, the sound of the
<PB N="113" REF="038552_0115_1012592FCEB916B8"/>
shepherd's pipe seems to inspire him with delight; and the hunters sometimes make use of that instru∣ment to allure the poor animal to his destruction. This creature's voice is stronger, louder, and more tremulous, in proportion as he advances in age. At some particular seasons, the stag is extremely wild and furious. Some years ago, William duke of Cumberland caused a tyger and a stag to be en∣closed in the same <HI>area,</HI> and the stag made so bold a defence, that the tyger was compelled to submit. The stag seldom drinks in the winter, and still less in the spring, while the plants are tender and covered with dew. It is in the heat of summer that he is seen frequenting the sides of rivers and lakes to quench his thirst. He swims with great ease and strength, and best at those times when he is fattest, his fat keeping him buoyant, like oil upon the surface of the water. As the stag is about five years coming to perfection, he lives above forty years; and it is a general rule that every animal lives about seven or eight times he number of years which it continues to grow. The horns of the stag are greatly in use, and com∣monly known by the name of hartshorn. It is calcined for some uses, and made into a jelly for others. The marrow of the stag is preferred to
<PB N="114" REF="038552_0116_1012593297A00110"/>
that of any other animal to ease pain, and to supple callous parts.</P>
<P>It is well known that this animal is devoted to the chase in almost every country; and generally forms a considerable part of the sport and pastime of the noble and the great. The desertion of the chase has formed animated matter for the pens of the most celebrated poets; and Mr. Hervey, the author of Theron and Aspasio, has so pleasingly described the scene, that we are disposed to recite it particularly for the pleasure of our young readers:</P>
<P>"The stag, roused from his lare, shakes his dappled sides; tosses his beamy head; and, con∣scious of superior agility, seems to defy the gather∣ing storm. First he has recourse to stratagem and evasive shifts; he plunges into the copse; darts across the glade; and wheels about in doubling mazes, as though he would pursue even the foe he avoids. The full-mouthed hounds unravel all his windings, and drive him from his wily arts. Now he betakes himself to flight, and confides in his speed. He bursts through the woods; bounds over the lawns; and leaves the lagging beagles far be∣hind. The beagles slow, but sure, trace his steps through woods, through lawns, through half the extended forest. Unwearied, still unwearied, they
<PB N="115" REF="038552_0117_10125935167A5D30"/>
urge their ardent way, and gain upon the alarmed object of their pursuit. Again he flies; flies with redoubled swiftness; shoots down the steep; strains up the hill; and takes shelter in the inmost recess of some sequestered grove. The sagacious hounds hang with greedy nostrils on the scent: they re∣cover, by indefatigable assiduity, the ground they had lost. Up they come a third time; and, join∣ing in a general peal of vengeance, hurry the affrighted animal from his short concealment. Per∣plexed, and in the utmost distress, he seeks the numerous herd. He would lose himself, and elude his pursuers, amidst the multitude of his fellows. But they, unconcerned for a brother's woe, shun the miserable creature, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xpel him from the selfish circle. Abandoned by his associates, and haunted with apprehensions of approaching ruin, he trem∣bles at every leaf that shakes. He starts, he springs, and, wild and swift as the wind, flies he knows not where, yet pours out all his soul in flight. Vain, vain are his efforts! The horrid cry, lately lessened, thickens upon the gale, and thunders in his ear. Now the poor, breathless victim is full in view. His sprightliness forsakes him. His agility is spent. See! how he toils in yonder val∣ley, with faltering limbs and a hobbling gait. The sight of their game quickens the pace, and
<PB N="116" REF="038552_0118_101259386ED59FC0"/>
whets the ardour of the impetuous hounds. What can he do, surrounded as he is with insulting tongues and ravenous jaws? Despair is capable of inspiring even the timorous breast. Having nothing to hope, he forgets to fear. He faces about and makes a resolute stand. The trunk of a sturdy tree covers his rear, and his own branching horns defend him in front. He rushes upon his adversaries; goars some; lays others grovelling on the turf; and makes the whole coward pack give way. Encouraged by this unexpected success, his hopes revive. He rallies once again his drooping spirits; exerts the little remainder of his strength; and springs through the midst of the retiring route. It is his last, last chance. He stretches every nerve; once more loses sight of the rabble from the kennel; and, finding no security on the land, takes to the water. He throws his burning sides into the river; sails down the cooling stream; and slinks away to the verge of some little shelving island; there, finding a resting-place for his feet, he skulks close to the shady margin. All immersed in the waves, excepting only his nostrils, he baffles, for a while, the prying eye of man, and the keener smell of brute. Discovered at length, and forced to quit this unavailing refuge, he climbs the slippery bank. Unable to fly any longer, he stands at bay
<PB N="117" REF="038552_0119_10122A00F6342CC8"/>
against an aged willow. Stands, all faint with toil, and sobbing with anguish. The crowds that gather round him, with merciless and outrageous trans∣port, triumph in his misery. A multitude of blood∣thirsty throats, joined with the sonorous horn, ring his funeral knell. The tears, till this fatal instant unknown, gush from his languishing eyes, and roll down his reeking cheeks. He casts one more look on the woods, the lawns, the pleasing scenes of his former delights; and, determined to die, pre∣pares to sell his life as dear as possible. At this most critical juncture, the <HI>royal</HI> sportsman comes up. He sees the distressed creature, and, as soon as he sees, he pities. He issues his high command. The prohibitary signal is given. The pack, though raving for blood, are checked in a moment, and called off from the prey. Disappointed and growl∣ing, they retire, and leave the intended victim of their fury to enjoy his liberty, his safety, and his ease."</P>
<P>From this pleasing description of the stag-hunt, and the clemency of its period, Mr. Hervey shews the sensibility of a sinner pursued by the law of his creator, until he obtains mercy through Jesus the king of grace. Dialogues, vol. ii. dial. ix. which our readers may peruse at leisure. We close this piece with a few scripture remarks.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="038552_0120_1012593A0AF298D8"/>
This animal, as parting the hoof and chewing the cud, was denominated clean by the Mosaic law; and all might partake of it, with this prohi∣bition, not to eat its blood, but to pour it upon the ground like water. Exod. xiv. 5. xv. 22.</P>
<P>From the implacability of the deer to the serpent, the beauty of its form, the swiftness of its motion, as well as its quickness of sight, and warmth of affection, it is used as a scripture emblem of Christ the Lord Messiah. <HI>Turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe, or a young hart, upon the moun∣tains of Bether.</HI> Sol. Song ii. 17. He is, indeed, according to the Hebrew title of the 22d psalm, <HI>the hind of the morning,</HI> early appointed to visit the <HI>Bether</HI> mountains of <HI>division</HI> between God and man; to destroy the works of the old serpent, the devil; and, although like a stag upon the forest, he should be hunted by men as a pack of the most voracious hounds, (accurately described in this very 22d chapter) he should thereby be able to sustain the souls of his people with his crucified flesh! Nor improperly is he called <HI>the hind of the morn∣ing;</HI> looking lovely and beautiful as the morning; swift and cheerful as the hind when it rises from its rest and runs its course; speedily hastening, as the beloved of our souls, to relieve and to comfort us under the sorrows of our life. And on the resur∣rection
<PB N="119" REF="038552_0121_1012593CD22F9038"/>
morning he shall come, with inconceivable swiftness, to receive and to embrace the souls of his redeemed, transmitting them to yonder state of blessedness for ever!</P>
<P>To describe the benefits of Christ, and the virtue of his grace upon the soul of man, who, by nature, has neither will nor power to walk with God, and to discharge those duties which are connected with our peace, holiness, and happiness, God hath said, by the prophet Isaiah, that <HI>the lame man shall leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing.</HI> xxxv. 6. So great a change does this grace make in healing and animating the soul in all holy exer∣cises, that the man who feels it acknowledges, with Habakkuk, the favour to come alone from God. iii. 19. <HI>The Lord God is my strength, and he will make my feet like hind's feet, and he will make me to walk upon my high places.</HI> And how justly does this animal of the chase describe the intense exercises of the christian's heart and life? Like the over-driven hart, the believer finds himself pursued, and sometimes is surrounded with a pack of vile, enraged foes! Yet, God is his never failing refuge; he has waters to which he can re∣pair to animate his soul; and frequently he unites with persecuted David, <HI>as the hart panteth after the water-brooks, so panteth my soul after thee,
<PB N="120" REF="038552_0122_1012593F587B9018"/>
O God.</HI> Psm. xlii. I. And as the cooling stream of the brook refreshes the panting, hunted hart, to urge on his way in spite of every pursuer, so the love and favour of God replenish the parched soul of man until he shall cross the black sea of death, and gain the shore of infinite blessedness, where neither tears, sins, nor foes invade; but per∣fect, undisturbed repose for ever reigns.</P>

<HEAD>A VISIT TO THE HOUSE OF WOE: A DIALOGUE.</HEAD>
<P>TO me, no social duty appears more gratifying to the finer feelings of the soul, nor more strongly recommended in the scripture, than to visit the needy and the distressed. I therefore resolved to call upon a christian neighbour, whom I heard was immersed in affliction.</P>
<P>On entering his chamber, I found him reclined upon his bed, so full of grief and dejection as scarce able to direct his eyes to his visitor. I took a seat at his side, and addressed him with all that tender∣ness my heart could dictate. Silence sat upon his lips—he bowed—he mourned within his soul! Per∣ceiving his spirit full charged with sorrow, and that under his present oppression, conversation might be ineffectual, I proposed to address the MOST HIGH in prayer on his behalf. Acquiescing by an expressive change of countenance, I at∣tempted to pour out my heart in supplication. On rising, with an intention to depart, I presented him my hand: while embracing it, the melting tear fell from his eyes. Presuming his breast might now find a degree of vent, I resumed my chair, and thus addressed him:—</P>

<P>To lose a bosom friend, and to consign two lovely babes to the recess of soul corruption, is an affliction that awakens our most tender feelings, and leaves such deep impressions on the heart which nature cannot erase. The absence of your Savi∣our's

<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may not now feel that comfortable sup∣port you wish; but supported you undoubtedly are, and that by an unseen, gracious hand; else your frail nature would bow still lower, and your spirits drive much farther on the borders of deep despair. God can, even now, add to your afflic∣tion; give the roaring tempter a few more links of chain to harrass you with vile, accursed things; and, likewise, remove from you many creature comforts, which his goodness hath spared. Thus lower might he let you fall into the deep dungeon of affliction, and, after all, raise you up again to sing of his goodness and his power!</P>

<P>I already feel the tempter's darts;—from my present most wretched state of soul, and my distance from the Saviour's love, I am induced, notwithstanding my long profession of religion, to question, if ever I knew the Lord aright, or felt the power of changing grace?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is evident, that God doth not willingly af∣flict the children of men; and that <HI>the fruit of all is, to take away sin.</HI> Isa. xxvii. 9. Although I never heard you had offended in any public man∣ner, yet I would wish you to examine if the <HI>omis∣sion</HI> of some known duty, or the <HI>gratification</HI> of some <HI>known</HI> sin, may not have been the leading step to your present sufferings. I will fold down two or three passages on this subject, in the Bible I see here upon your table, and you can read and meditate upon them at your leisure. Jer. ii. 17. Hosea iv. 17. Hosea xiv. 1, 2, 8. As to ques∣tioning your former profession and experience, it is not uncommon in affliction, and when the heart goes astray from the Lord. This you will find in the 77th Psal. and in Isa. xlix. 13—16. My un∣believing heart has too often been guilty of this folly; but, under such God-dishonouring, soul-dis∣tressing frames, two duties appear very necessary. <HI>Call to remembrance the former days in which ye
<PB N="127" REF="038552_0129_10125950EA59FEC8"/>
were illuminated.</HI> Heb. x. 32. The first impres∣sions of your mind; your new-born hopes; the time, the place, when you commenced the christian course; this, probably, may produce some unex∣pected, deep conviction, you cannot deny, but that Jesus once obtained both your heart and hand!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, Sir;—it is a necessary duty;—I must confess I knew such days;—days, precious even in recollection! No, I will not,—I dare not deny; BLESSED SAVIOUR, thou wast then most sweet to me! <HI>O that it were with me as in months past!</HI> Pray, Sir, what other duty did you mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is this—Go to Christ as though you had never gone before;—begin again, as though you never had begun. For this you have many pro∣mises to encourage you: <HI>Him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.</HI> John vi. 37. Whether you had been before or not, let your temptations, burdens, and discouragements be what they may, Go to Jesus by faith and prayer, he will not cast you out!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>B.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you will bear with me, I will tell you one severe temptation that hovers upon my heart: it is, that my present sufferings are the effect of God's vindictive wrath, and are the marks of his ven∣geance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="128" REF="038552_0130_1012595491809F10"/>
<SPEAKER>A.</SPEAKER>
<P>This distressed apprehension may arise from your not duly considering the nature of those af∣flictions with which God visits his children: Not as actual punishments inflicted according to the de∣mands of <HI>law and justice,</HI> but as <HI>fatherly correc∣tions,</HI> loving the child, yet chastising him for follies or disobedience; and which fail not to produce the richest benefits. As Moses said unto the Israelites, so will I say to you—<HI>Thou shalt consider in thy heart, that as a man chasteneth his son, so the Lord thy God chasteneth thee.</HI> Deut. viii. 5. This is a subject duly and seriously to be weighed by all; and especially by those in affliction, that they might know the nature of the Divine conduct to them: that it is not in vindictive wrath an ab∣solute punishment for sin is evident; for, <HI>Christ hath once suffered for sin;</HI> and God cannot require double satisfaction. Besides, what we are capable of feeling in this life, is but a faint <HI>sense</HI> of sin; whereas the wicked in hell must have both <HI>sense and punishment.</HI> These chastisements, which fall upon a man of grace, are fruits of God's paternal love, and sooner or later will not fail to humble the heart, and return the prodigal to his father's arms. <HI>Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.</HI> Heb. xii.

6. Now, my friend, kiss the rod. It is in a fa∣ther's hand. It is intended for your good. Pray for faith to view yourself in his most gracious hand; and beg, rather that your soul may be sanc∣tified under your sorrows, than that you should be delivered out of them with hardness of heart. He that suffered on the cross for your sins, can sustain you under your burdens, and give you an happy issue.—I perceive company now to approach your gate; I must therefore take my leave of you, wish∣ing the God of all consolation may revive and re∣store both your body and soul.</P>

<HEAD>A SCRAP, Found in the Study of the late Rev. R. B.—.</HEAD>
<P>—LAST Sabbath, a young man, newly brought to enjoy a Saviour's love, called upon me. Such a serious cheerfulness and child-like simplicity appeared in him as won my heart, and made me recollect what I once felt, but feel not now. How soon we step out of petticoats into breeches, and outgrow the charming child-like simplicity of the
<PB N="132" REF="038552_0134_1012595E8EE09418"/>
new-birth! Either we become wise by knowledge, vain through our gifts, or important by our station. Self-sufficiency creepeth upon us insensibly, like the shades of the evening, till we are quite over∣whelmed by it; and the bloom of simplicity, like the bloom of a plumb when wiped off, is not to be recovered, at least in its primitive blush. Many years have I been praying for a child-like spirit; but did not know I was praying, or did not intend praying for a furnace of affliction to produce it! Well! I have been in the fire of tribulation six years, and have scarcely recovered a grain of christian simplicity yet;—some little bloom appears upon the plumb, at times, but seems more like the painter's stroke than the tint of nature. I preach against self-sufficiency, and renounce it stiffly in my creed, but treasure it up secretly in my bosom. What a cheat and a rogue is a man to himself! O for pet∣ticoats again, to look, and talk, and walk, like a child!</P>

<HEAD>DIFFERENT CLAIMS TO THE MES∣SIAH SHIP.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the sublimity of the character of the MESSIAH, and the innumerable benefits to be de∣rived from him by the world, as described by the
<PB N="133" REF="038552_0135_101259610C129B50"/>
ancient prophets, no wonder so many impostors should have arisen, and laid claim to the office. Of this Jesus Christ forewarned his disciples:—<HI>There shall arise false christs, and false pro∣phets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; in∣somuch that (if it were possible) they shall deceive the very elect. Behold, I have told you before.</HI> Mat. xxiv. 24, 25. The event has verified his pre∣diction; and, to gratify our readers, we shall, from the best authority, enumerate the chief of those im∣postors that have claimed the public attention!</P>
<P>SIMON, the sorcerer, set himself forth, in the apostlic age, and by multitude, both of small and great, was acknowledged <HI>the great power of God;</HI> yet he soon proved himself to be <HI>in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.</HI> Acts viii. In the following age, BARCHOCHEBAS, by his impostures, drew the most terrible persecutions imaginable on the Jews: his name denotes <HI>Son of the Star,</HI> applying to himself the prophecy of Ba∣laam. Numb. xxiv. 17. The number of Jews who perished on account of this impostor is incre∣dible!—In the fifth century, about the year 434, in the isle of Candy, or Crete, appeared a false Mes∣siah, called MOSES, pretending to be the ancient le∣gislator of the Jews, come down from heaven to procure them a passage through the sea to Judea.
<PB N="134" REF="038552_0136_10125962A41D25D0"/>
Great numbers jumped into the sea, expecting it would open and give them passage. In this attempt many were drowned; after which the impostor dis∣appeared. <HI>Socrat. Hist. Eccles.</HI>—In the following age, in the year 530, a false Messiah, called JULIAN, appeared in Palestine: under him the Jews took up arms, but the emperor Justinian sending some troops against them, Julian was taken and executed, and his party dispersed. In 714, a Jew, called Serenus, pretended to the Spanish Jews, that he would conduct them to Palestine; but they soon found him to be an impostor. <HI>Marca Hist. de Bearn.</HI>—The twelfth century was very fruitful in impostors of this kind, there appearing no less than seven or eight in France, Spain, Persia, &amp;c. The last century produced a very famous instance: about the year 1666, one ZABATI TZEVI, a na∣tive of Aleppo, or Smyrna, set up for a Messiah. He was summoned before the heads of the syna∣gogue at Smyrna, and being convicted, was con∣demned to death; but none could be found to exe∣cute the sentence; he was therefore banished; and, passing through Greece, came to Alexandria, from thence to Gaza, where he found a Jew, named Nathan Levi, whom he persuaded to act the part of the prophet Elias. Many of the Jews were de∣ceived. He afterwards came to Constantinople,
<PB N="135" REF="038552_0137_1012596520584DD0"/>
where he was apprehended, and ordered to be run through with a sword; to avoid which, he turned Mussulman. <HI>Basnage's Hist. de Juiss.</HI></P>
<P>Some of our readers, probably, expect, in this enumeration, we should have named Mahomet, the pretended prophet of Arabia, who made his appear∣ance in the year 622, but he lay no claim to the Messiahship, to the performance of miracles, nor to be a subject of the prophecies. He approved the prophetic character of JESUS CHRIST, as being extraordinary, and in his paradisaical vision is said to homage the SAVIOUR, though all other beings bowed to him. It is well known that Mahomet built his fabric upon the supposed nullity of the law of Moses, and the abuse of the christian religion by its professors; in consequence of which, he said, <Q>God had sent him into the world, and appointed him his prophet.</Q></P>
<P>May not believers on the Lord Christ, the Son of God, in every age exclaim, with the primitive disciples, <HI>We have found the Messiah, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.</HI> John i. 41. With the Bible in our hand, we may clearly perceive, that every feature predicted in the character of Mes∣siah—the fulness of time in which he should ap∣pear—the miracles by which he should attest his mission—his grand design in making an offering for
<PB N="136" REF="038552_0138_101259672CA0C248"/>
sin—his province to build the house of the Lord, and to bear its glory—his ability to secure, in his own person, a triumphant resurrection from the dead, with every blessing, spiritual and eternal, that can form the moral happiness of man. These great and glorious things are found in Jesus; none of which have been possessed by any before—none since his appearing. He is full of grace and truth, a suitable Saviour for lost man; the experience of whose blessing attunes the heart, and lays a solid basis for present peace and future glory!</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY On the LAW and the GOSPEL. By the Reverend SAMUEL JONES, D. D. Pennsylvania.</HEAD>
<P>BETWEEN the Law and the Gospel there is both a connection and a material difference. The blending of these together, or treating them in an indistinct manner, has ever been a source of error. It is, therefore, the more necessary to keep each of
<PB N="146" REF="038552_0148_10125981780C4058"/>
them in its proper place, especially as a legal spirit is so natural to man, and so difficult to be guarded against.</P>
<P>The difference between the Law and the Gospel is very obvious. The Law denounces wrath—the Gospel publishes peace. The Law convinces of guilt—the Gospel brings an acquittance. The Law pronounces sentence—the Gospel presents a pardon. The Law requires satisfaction to the last mite—the Gospel announces satisfaction made by Christ in full. The Law knows nothing of mercy—the Gospel knows nothing else. In the Law righteousness, justice, and truth, shine gloriously—in the Gospel, love, grace, mercy, condescension, and compassion, shine with much more resplendent glory! In the Gospel we find free grace, free mercy, free pardon, faith and repentance are freely given; and with them a new heart, a new nature, new life—all is new—all is free. The Gospel, as the word signifies, is <HI>good message, good news, glad tidings.</HI> The language of the Angels, at the birth of Christ, was, <HI>Behold! we bring you glad tidings of great joy.</HI> Luke ii. 10. The evangelic Prophet Isaiah, in that memorable passage, applied by our blessed Lord to himself and the gos∣pel day, Luke iv. 18, 19. breaks out in the fol∣lowing gospel strain: <HI>The spirit of the Lord
<PB N="147" REF="038552_0149_10125984D8EB70B8"/>
God is upon me, because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings to the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison doors to them that are bound; to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord; to comfort all that mourn; to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.</HI> Isaiah lxi. 1—6.</P>
<P>The Gospel is sometimes called <HI>the Gospel of the grace of God,</HI> Acts xx. 24. because it pub∣lishes the rich grace and mercy of God in Christ Jesus. It is also called <HI>the Gospel of salvation,</HI> Eph. i. 13. Acts xiii. 26. because it brings to light the way of life and salvation, provided of God for lost, perishing sinners. Likewise, <HI>the Gospel of peace,</HI> proclaiming peace, made by the peace-speak∣ing blood of Christ; diffusing peace and tranquilli∣ty into depressed minds; producing a peaceable dis∣position, conducting the feet in the paths of peace, and nurturing the soul for the realms of peace and blessedness in an eternal state!</P>
<P>The Gospel brings glad tidings of good things,—good things done for us; atonement being made for us, our debt of sin fully paid, a righteousness wrought out, pardon and acceptance procured;
<PB N="148" REF="038552_0150_10125987987CE008"/>
good things wrought in us, regeneration, faith, hope; love, obedience, every grace habitually to prepare us for heaven; all the good things of Providence and grace that are necessary for our present use, during our passage through life, and, in their final issue, the good things of heaven, the beatific state! The gospel, therefore, is a discovery of all good things for time, and for eternity; such infinite blessedness which is beyond what the tongues of angels and of men can express, or the powers of the human mind conceive!</P>
<P>We add, the Gospel is a matter of pure revela∣tion from God, entirely unknown and imperceiva∣ble by the light of nature. The revelation of this Gospel has been progressive in every age. The first dawning of the Gospel, consequently the first solid ground of hope, appeared to Adam, in the promise that was made of <HI>the seed of the woman who was to bruise the serpent's head.</HI> Gen. iii. 15. Here the eternal counsels of the grace of God began to unfold! In the promise made to Abraham, which was afterwards renewed to Isaac and to Jacob, the same gospel grace breaks forth with clearer light. What had before been spoken, in more general terms, of the seed of <HI>the woman,</HI> is now said, in a more particular manner, of <HI>the seed of Abraham.</HI> Gen. xxii. 18. To Jacob, the
<PB N="149" REF="038552_0151_10125989324ECCA8"/>
very time of accomplishing the promise was pointed out. Gen. xlix. 10. Moses renders the promise still more manifest, while he points out a charac∣ter and likeness. Deut. xvii. 15. In the prophets, who were much further advanced in the dispensa∣tion of the promises, approaching to the fulness of time, hastening to the coming of the Messiah, you have his virgin mother, Isaiah vii. 5. place of birth, Micah v. 2. and other circumstances pointed out. Thus we observe the order and progress of the di∣vine promises, gathering light and strength as they advance. When the first intimation of a Saviour was given, he was to be sought for among all the human race; afterwards we are directed to the particular seed of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; of Jacob's numerous sons the tribe of Judah is taken; of the tribe of Judah the family of Jesse; and of Jesse's sons the house of David: thus reducing, as it were, to a point, what had at first been delivered but in very general terms.</P>
<P>These are some of the leading and principal dis∣coveries that were made to the world of our blessed Saviour before his incarnation. Thus did the pro∣mises and the prophesies become brighter and brighter, until at last they shone more clear in their full accomplishments, when the sun of righteous∣ness rose, dispelling darkness, and spreading the light of gospel-day.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="038552_0152_1012598BAF540EF0"/>
The revelation of this Gospel has been made known to such nations, and the application of it made to such individuals of those nations, as it seemed good to the will and pleasure of God. <HI>It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.</HI> Rom. ix. 16.</P>
<P>The application of the gospel, under the influ∣ence of the SPIRIT OF GOD, in the work of con∣viction and conversion, is absolutely necessary, in order to our receiving <HI>sensible</HI> benefit from it. In this precious work of grace on the heart, the law, and the gospel, <HI>as means,</HI> go hand in hand, and are often mentioned in the same verse. By the one is the knowledge of sin, by the other the discovery of deliverance. The one worketh despair, the other faith and hope.</P>
<P>Thus, the glorious Gospel, in every point of view, is the work of the rich and sovereign grace and mercy of God, that the plan of redemption was concerted, published, and applied to the elect, with all its saving benefits. O the glorious and blessed Gospel! O the sovereign grace and mercy of God, in and through a precious Redeemer! to HIM be glory for ever and for ever—and let all the redeemed on earth and in heaven say, <HI>amen!</HI></P>

<HEAD>ANECDOTE OF PRESIDENT EDWARDS.</HEAD>
<P>PRESIDENT Edwards tells of himself the following anecdote.—I once told a boy of about thirteen years of age, that a piece of any matter of two inches square was eight times as big as a piece of one inch square. He seemed, at first, not to think me in earnest; but when I had taken pains to convince him that I knew what I said to be true, he appeared astonished I was so positive; and would argue, how is it possible for two in∣ches to be one inch. It seemed to him to be as evident a contradiction as that that which was twice so long, and twice so broad, and twice so thick, should be eight times as large, or that twice one should make eight, or any other absurdity whatever.</P>
<P>When I afterwards shewed him the truth of it, by cutting out two cubes, one an inch, the other two inches square, and then cut the two inch cube into eight equal parts, he counted them over and over, and seemed as astonished as though there had been some witchcraft in the case; he could hardly believe it, for he was a stranger to the reason.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="038552_0154_10125991A50F1750"/>
"I believe," adds that great man, "it was a much more difficult mystery to him than the Trinity ordinarily is to men, and seemed more palpably con∣tradictory, than any doctrine of our religion to the Socinian and Deist. And why should we not sup∣pose that there may be some things that are true that may be as much above our understanding, and as difficult to them, as the truth respecting the cubes was to this boy? Doubtless there is a far greater difference between our understanding and God's, than between this boy's and the greatest phi∣losopher's or mathematician's."</P>

<HEAD>SACRAMENTAL REFLECTIONS ON JOHN XX. 26.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><HI>—Then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THEN, after the sufferings, crucifixion, death and burial of the Lord Jesus; when his disciples were depressed by unbelief, and harrassed by their countrymen the Jews, being met together, the doors being shut, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and pronounced peace upon their waiting souls. May
<PB N="153" REF="038552_0155_1012599420194CE8"/>
the same adored Saviour meet with us, who now desire to meet with him at his own table! May he graciously pronounce peace to every heart, and bid us go from strength to strength, till we see his face in brightest vision in everlasting bliss!</P>
<P N="1">1. This was a supernatural, miraculous visit. <HI>Jesus came, the doors being shut;</HI> the account of which has given occasion to some to object to this part of scripture history; because it is a philosophical maxim, that one material body cannot penetrate another; consequently the material body of Jesus could not pass through the material door unopened, and so appear to his disciples. To this we reply, The body of Jesus, by death, was sown a natural body, but was raised a spiritual body; consequently materiality is absorbed in spirit. And, as a proof of his possessing this spirituality, he eluded the em∣brace of Mary, saying, <HI>Touch me not yet, for I am not yet ascended to my Father and your Father.</HI> Therefore we believe his spiritual body capable of such an extraordinary visit to his disciples.—The DIVINITY OF CHRIST gives us another ground to object to this deistical sentiment. <HI>Where two or three are met together in my name, there am I in the midst of them,</HI> said Jesus, as a proof of his omnipresence. This Saviour conversed with Abraham; with Moses in the burning bush; with
<PB N="154" REF="038552_0156_10125995B8D29D98"/>
the three worthies in the fiery furnace; and could as easily converse with his disciples, as met together in secret for fear of the Jews. The reality of this visit is firmly and solemnly believed by all whose heart, like <HI>Lydia'</HI>s, the Lord hath opened. Admit that one material body cannot penetrate another—we apply this to the human heart, that no man, minister or friend, can open the heart, and convey blessings to another; yet Christ can, and doth; for he that made us can alone save us, and turn our hearts unto himself. A proof of this I presume to believe is found in the breasts of many of my readers; carrying with it the clearest conviction of the eter∣nal power and Godhead of the Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P N="2">2. This visit of Christ to his disciples was highly seasonable. They were persecuted by their brethren the Jews, and therefore shut the doors, for fear, upon themselves: and at this time they were har∣rassed with doubts and fears, "if Jesus was indeed the Christ." Full of despondency, they met to∣gether, no doubt, to inquire into the reality of the resurrection of Jesus, and of his being the Messiah that should redeem Israel. Thomas, in an especial manner, disputed the case, and would receive no satisfaction. As it was with these primitive disci∣ples so it is frequently with the church and people of God in every age. Persecution, temptations,
<PB N="155" REF="038552_0157_1012599891A29A48"/>
doubts, fears, and a thousand other evils, compass them about; and, if I may so say, the door of hope appears to them shut and barred. At such a time as this, sudden and unexpected, for Jesus to mani∣fest himself to them, pronounce the charming words of peace, and make the place of his feet glorious: what an astonishing alteration does it make in the feelings, views, language, and pleasures of the happy company!</P>
<P N="3">3. This visit was particularly intended for con∣firmation. They had doubted—they had question∣ed—if the crucified Jesus was indeed the Saviour, long foretold, and necessary to be enjoyed. Thomas, one of the twelve, absent at a former meeting with the disciples when Jesus came, would not believe, and said, "<HI>Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of his nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.</HI>" The dear Saviour, knowing this despondent spirit to possess his disci∣ples, not waiting for the testimony or inquiries of Thomas, thus unexpectedly addressed him:—"<HI>Thomas, reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side, and be not faithless, but believ∣ing.</HI>" Indescribable must be the feelings of Thomas at this address! Self-abased, convinced, and be∣lieving,
<PB N="156" REF="038552_0158_1012599C2B73F660"/>
he now exclaims, "<HI>My Lord and my God!</HI>" Just so the Lord often speaks to us at his table, bids us be familiar with his wounds, his blood, and his heart; then, O then we are asham∣ed at our neglect and unbelief, prove his love and grace each day more healing, and ascribe salvation to his most blessed name!</P>
<P N="4">4. Although Thomas, by reason of his extreme doubts, was particularly addressed, yet, it is evi∣dent that the visit was general—to one—to all. Jesus said unto them, <HI>Peace be unto you.</HI> They all had this address before Thomas was selected and brought to acknowledgment; consequently, let their fears, hopes, duties, trials, distresses, temp∣tations, and unbelief, be what they may, all heard the Saviour's voice, all received the peaceful bles∣sing. In the same manner he meets his people now, and let their circumstances be what they may, his loving heart, his watchful eye, his gracious hand, are still the same, and upon all; rich and poor, young and old, lambs and sheep, all find a place beneath his sacred smiles!</P>
<P N="5">5. The visit was in a measure permanent; it was not a passing by, but a standing still. He <HI>stood</HI> in the midst, so every eye might see him, and all enjoy his gracious visit. And here, methinks, was no questioning one another, no calling Peter
<PB N="157" REF="038552_0159_1012599DC98C4A48"/>
to account for the denial of his Lord, no reproving John for his precipitance in calling down fire from heaven upon those who followed not Jesus, nor re∣proof to Thomas for his negligence and unbelief; but, every eye, every heart was engaged towards Christ, who was not only the centre of the com∣pany, but the centre of their joy! Just so it is where Christ makes his visits and commands his love: all animosities vanish; human frailties are forgotten; of one heart and of one soul, they all embrace the precious Christ, who is the fountain of their mutual joy! This never fails to be the case where a revival of religion is enjoyed.</P>
<P N="6">6. This visit was attended with benefits: Jesus pronounced peace unto them, and peace flowed into every heart! Peace is a term that comprehends every blessing we can enjoy, and is peculiarly wel∣come to us, who by nature are enemies to God, and need his pardon. Jesus obtained peace by the blood of his cross: having satisfied for sin, he now has a right to speak peace to the sinner's heart. O that each of us may hear and feel the blissful found!—There were no superfluous, unnecessary acts in the life of Christ; his feet went about doing good; his eyes were fixed with compassion upon the wretched, and his hands constantly administered relief: even when his blessed hands were nailed
<PB N="158" REF="038552_0160_101259A0426B04C0"/>
open to the cross, they were filled with his own blood, which conveys the greatest blessedness to guilty men.</P>
<P>The privilege of these disciples, in the enjoyment of such a visit from Christ, was certainly very great: they saw the Lord, and their hearts were filled with joy: but, says the same divine Lord,—<HI>because thou hast seen me thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.</HI> V. 29. <HI>And these things are written, that we might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing we might have life through his name.</HI> V. 31. Our privi∣leges are greater than those of the disciples: Jesus is now ascended, and set down at the Father's right hand, as a sure pledge of our glorification in hea∣ven.—Now the promised Spirit is to us sent down, and, under his influence, we know, love, and en∣joy the Lord! May we live in the experience of these inestimable blessings; and may the repeated visits of Christ to us in his church below, be the delightful prelude to an eternal communion with him in the church triumphant above!</P>

<HEAD><HI>Thoughts on</HI> 1 Cor. xv. 29. <HI>in answer to the Question proposed thereon in our last number, page</HI> 120. "<HI>Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? Why are they then baptized for the dead?"</HI></HEAD>
<P>OUR correspondent, perhaps, is aware of cer∣tain difficulties attending this remarkable passage. Some have taken the liberty of rendering the words, <HI>What shall they do who are baptized</HI> OVER <HI>the dead?</HI> "it being customary among the primitive christians, to baptize converts over the graves of believing dead; especially over the tombs of the martyrs." But the New Testament informs us of no such sort of baptisms. If any had existed, and intended for example, we should have been in∣formed of this singular rite being performed, by preference, over the tomb of Stephen, the first christian martyr. Instead of graves and tombs we find the river <HI>Jordan</HI> chosen, and the river <HI>AEnon, near Salim, because there was much water there.</HI> John iii. 23.—On this passage we shall offer a few plain thoughts; and should our correspondent, or any other of our readers, possess better, they are at liberty to maintain them.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="038552_0162_101259A5607F7158"/>
It is the obvious design of the Apostle, in the whole of this chapter, by many different arguments, to prove the nature and certainty of the resurrection of the dead. The argument in the text is drawn from the use and practice of the ordinance of bap∣tism: each one, observing that rite, is said to be <HI>bap∣tized for the dead.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The dead</HI> here intended, instead of being Ste∣phen, or any other believing, or martyred, buried saint, we believe, is none other than our LORD JESUS CHRIST himself, <HI>who was dead, and is alive for evermore.</HI> Rev. i. 18. By the example and authority of this Saviour, and into his name and death, the primitive saints were baptized—<HI>Know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ, were baptized into his death?</HI> Rom. vi. 3. Of his death and resurrection bap∣tism is a most striking emblem; and all who are believingly and truly baptized do thereby profess that their souls are washed from guilt in the Re∣deemer's bloody death; and, as sure as Jesus rose out of the waters of baptism in Jordan, and out of the grave on the third day, so, assuredly, shall the dead bodies of his saints arise in the solemn day of judgment unto everlasting life. Now (as if the Apostle had said) if Jesus be not risen—if there be no future resurrection of human bodies from the
<PB N="161" REF="038552_0163_101259A8BA28F638"/>
grave—then there is no meaning in baptism; a profession thereby is totally vain; and those who are baptized have most certainly deluded themselves The question the Apostle proposes upon such a supposition may therefore be readily answered—<HI>What shall they do which are baptized for the dead,</HI> if neither Jesus nor men arise again?—<HI>Ans.</HI> Let them renounce their baptism; let them protest against such delusions; let them cast contempt on the institutor; let them return again to their former state. For, as Paul saith, <HI>they are sound false witnesses against God.</HI> 1 Cor. xv. 15. The con∣clusion now is evident, and which the Apostle hath drawn with his own pen, verses 16, 17, 18, 19. <HI>If the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: for if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ, are perished.</HI> If in this <HI>life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.</HI> But, it is our happiness to declare that, we have not believed a cunningly devised fable. <HI>Christ is risen indeed.</HI> Abundant evidences prove the event; and the spiritual efficacy of Christ's resurrection is felt by every believer, raising his soul from a death of sin to newness of life. Eph. i. 19, 20. Therefore, this will we DO <HI>who are baptized for the dead;</HI> we will contend
<PB N="162" REF="038552_0164_101259AA58E90F58"/>
earnestly for the faith of the gospel; we will rest our souls, with all their guilt and cares, upon Jesus, <HI>who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.</HI> Rom. iv. 25. Firmly believing, that <HI>if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection;</HI> which was to ascend on high, and to be <HI>crowned with glory and honour.</HI></P>
<P>We shall only add, that from hence it appears that the due administration of baptism perpetuates the history of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ; and that every one so baptized has the ad∣ditional pleasure of handing down to posterity, by their example, this most interesting subject.</P>

<P N="1">1. IN the centre of our mundane system, and at a just distance from the circumvolving planets, is fixed that most magnificent and beneficial orb of fluid fire, the SUN; designed and formed, by gra∣cious and almighty Wisdom, to be the grand, un∣failing

dispenser of <HI>light</HI> and <HI>heat,</HI> to the animal, the mineral, and the vegetable worlds.</P>
<P>So essentially important are its communications to the earth and her sister planets, that the adorable SAVIOUR of sinners is, in scripture, figuratively <HI>shadowed</HI> forth to our conceptions, by an idea taken from this <HI>brightest</HI> of visible objects. <HI>The Lord God is a</HI> SUN <HI>and shield: He will give</HI> to his chosen people the light and warmth of <HI>grace,</HI> below, <HI>and</HI> crown that grace with perfection of <HI>glory</HI> in the heaven of heavens above (Psa. lxxxiv. 11.) And the Father's endearing promise, made and fulfilled to each spiritually awakened sinner, is, <HI>to you that fear my name shall the</HI> SUN <HI>of Righteousness arise with healing in his beams.</HI> Mal. iv. 2.</P>
<P N="2">2. How extremely <HI>small</HI> the material Sun ap∣pears in comparison to its real magnitude! Who that is guided merely by his naked eye would sup∣pose that luminary to be what in fact it is, not less than a million of times larger than our whole ex∣tensive globe of earth and seas! When purblind <HI>Reason</HI> takes upon her to sit in judgment on the mysterious nature, decrees, and dispensations of God, she resembles the short-sighted optics of an unlettered Indian, who, estimating the size of the Sun by his own inadequate perceptions, imagines
<PB N="164" REF="038552_0166_101259B068D78930"/>
it to be of much less circumference than the floor of his hut; and, was a philosopher to apprize him of his mistake; would ask, with an unbelieving stare, if not with a contemptuous smile, <HI>How can these things be?</HI> Between the Sun's real and ap∣parent dimensions, <HI>some,</HI> though exceeding little, proportion obtains. But when the second person in the Godhead deigned to clothe himself with mor∣tality, his appearance bore <HI>no</HI> proportion to his in∣finite and essential dignity. <HI>Is not this the car∣penter, the son of Mary?</HI> was the decision of unilluminated Reason. The eye of supernatural Faith alone was able to see through the human veil, discern the latent Deity, and <HI>behold his glory, as the glory of the Only Begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.</HI></P>

<Q>As stars from absent suns have leave to shine.</Q>
But no sooner is JESUS, by the internal agency of his SPIRIT, revealed in our hearts, and his com∣pletely finished OBEDIENCE discovered to the eye of Faith, than we cease <HI>going about to establish our own righteousness,</HI> and joyfully <HI>submit to the</HI> imputed <HI>righteousness of</HI> the incarnate <HI>God.</HI> Self-excellence and self-dependence vanish in that blessed moment; and the language of the soul is, <Q>Thy merits, O thou Redeemer of the lost! are <HI>all my salvation;</HI> and an interest in thee is <HI>all my desire.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="4">4. Though the Sun constantly occupies the same part of space, and is, in that respect, <HI>fixed</HI> and im∣moveable, it yet <HI>turns</HI> upon its own axis, and com∣pletes its central rotation in about 25 days and six hours. This regular and perpetual actuosity con∣tributes, probably, to that amazing force and swift∣ness with which its rays are thrown off towards the

distant worlds that revolve around.—Thus God is, necessarily and essentially, <HI>fixed</HI> and unchangeable in his Will. <HI>He is of one mind; who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doth.</HI> Job xxiii. 13. This divine <HI>immutability</HI> is, how∣ever, connected with incessant, omnipotent, and universal <HI>activity:</HI> governing all beings and events by his absolute providence; and diffusing sacred light and heat, through the entire world of his con∣verted people, by the energy of his grace. His own sovereign DECREE is the <HI>axis</HI> on which he moves; and the only rule by which he regulates the whole of his effective and permissive conduct.</P>
<P N="5">5. Modern astronomers have discovered what are commonly called <HI>maculae solares:</HI> i. e. certain <HI>spots</HI> which hover near the surface of the Sun. Some∣times a considerable number of these are visible at once; and, very often, none at all. Philosophers are greatly divided as to the nature and cause of these solar spots: though it is generally agreed that they are <HI>not adherent</HI> to the Sun's disk, but suspended at some distance from it; and there is reasonable ground to believe, that, after a temporary suspen∣sion, they fall into the body of that grand luminary, and are instantaneously transmuted into one splen∣did mass with itself.—Whether those reputed spots be really <HI>in</HI> the Sun or not, thus much is infallibly
<PB N="167" REF="038552_0169_101259B63766C8F8"/>
certain, that GOD <HI>is light, and in</HI> HIM <HI>is no darkness at all;</HI> no error, no impurity, no defect. The afflictive distributions of his providence, and the limited communications of his grace, may, to the benighted eye of unregenerated reason, appear like the transitory <HI>spots</HI> which sometimes seem to disfigure the beauty, and to impair the lustre, of the Sun. But, on the contrary, the faith of God's elect teaches its happy subjects to give their hea∣venly Father unlimited credit for being perfectly wise, and just, and good; and to <HI>wait</HI> the END of his dispensations, when every seeming spot shall vanish, and God will <HI>make his righteousness as evident as the light, and his just dealing as the noon-day.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. How astonishingly <HI>rapid</HI> is the transmission of <HI>light</HI> from the Sun to our planet! I cannot display this so well as in the words of the accom∣plished Mr. Derham.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Physico-Theology, B. i. ch. 4.</NOTE> "It is a very great act of the providence of God, that such a benefit as light is not long in its passage from place to place: for was its motion no swifter than the motion of the swiftest bodies upon earth (such as of a <HI>bullet</HI> out of a great gun, or even of <HI>sound,</HI> which, next to light, is the swiftest motion we have), in this case light
<PB N="168" REF="038552_0170_101259BA76896D00"/>
would take up, in its progress from the Sun to us, above thirty-two years at the rate of the <HI>first,</HI> and above seventeen years at the rate of the <HI>latter</HI> motion; the inconveniences of which would be, (1.) its energy and vigour would be greatly cooled and abated: (2.) its rays would be less penetrant: and (3.) darkness would with greater difficulty and tardiness be dissipated, especially by the fainter lights of our sublunary luminous bodies.</P>
<P>"But, passing with such prodigious velocity, with nearly the instantaneous swiftness of almost <HI>two hundred thousand</HI> miles in one <HI>second</HI> of time, or (which is the same thing) being but about <HI>seven</HI> or <HI>eight minutes</HI> of an hour in coming from the Sun to us; therefore it is, that, with all secu∣rity and speed, we receive the kindly effects and influences of that noble and useful creature of God. Now, forasmuch as the distance between the Sun and the Earth is 86051398 miles, there∣fore, at the rate of seven minutes and an half, or 450 seconds, in passing from the Sun, light will be found to fly above 191225 miles in one second of time."</P>
<P>Truly wonderful as these considerations are, they yet afford but a very inadequate illustration of the <HI>power</HI> and <HI>swiftness</HI> with which the convincing arrows of the HOLY GHOST are often found to
<PB N="169" REF="038552_0171_101259BCF2E8E9C8"/>
<HI>pierce</HI> and <HI>illuminate</HI> the soul of an elect sinner. How was the energy of his arm revealed! how mightily, and how rapidly did the meltings of his grace catch from heart to heart, when no sewer than three thousand rebels were savingly subdued, and born again, under a single sermon! Acts ii. 41. What instantaneous and irresistible lightning issued from the eye of JESUS when he looked his revolted apostle into repentance unto life! And, to enu∣merate no more instances, how great was <HI>the glory of</HI> THAT <HI>light,</HI> which (in a moment, or in less time, if less can be) struck the bloody pharisee of Tharsus to the ground; transformed the furious lion into a passive lamb, and compelled a blasphem∣ing persecutor to groan, from the inmost of his heart, <HI>Lord, what wouldst thou have me to do!</HI> Nor is less power, from on high, exerted in the soul of any man who is effectually turned to God. The same omnipotence which conquered <HI>Paul;</HI> yea, the same omnipotence which raised JESUS himself from the dead, has actually been put forth in <HI>thee,</HI> O reader, if thou hast experienced the re∣newing operation of the Holy Spirit. 1 Tim. i. 16. Eph. i. 19, 20.</P>
<P>Do we wonder at the account which philosophy gives concerning the speedy transmission of this lovely element, from its created fountain to the
<PB N="170" REF="038552_0172_101259BE8F78D890"/>
earth? Let us, rather, value and admire that in∣finitely transcendent and more important blessing, which the following golden passage so charmingly describes: <HI>God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath</HI> SHINED IN OUR HEARTS; <HI>to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the person of Jesus Christ.</HI> 2 Cor. vi. 6.</P>
<P>Once more. Light does not travel from the Sun, so swiftly as the quickened bodies of the saints shall rise into glory, honour, and immortality, when the SAVIOUR of men shall appear, and the Arch∣angel's trumpet sound. <HI>In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, the dead shall be raised in∣corruptible, and we shall be changed.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. The Sun may, in some sense, be justly stiled <HI>anima mundi,</HI> or the soul of our revolving world. So universally pervading is its influence, that <HI>no∣thing is</HI> totally <HI>hid from the heat thereof.</HI> Psa. xix. 6. In a greater or less degree it permeates the whole region of air, penetrates the inmost recesses of the earth, and distributes a competent portion of its beams through the vast expanse of waters. Hence, in and on our planet, there is no such thing as absolute darkness, truly and strictly so called. If our eyes were constructed in the same manner as those of subterraneous animals, we should, like them, be able to <HI>see</HI> without artificial help, at any
<PB N="171" REF="038552_0173_101259C1339BA798"/>
distance below the surface of the earth, and by night as well as day. Not less universal than the solar agency is the all-directing PROVIDENCE of God. Nothing is exempted from its notice: no∣thing is excepted from its controul. Chance, like absolute darkness, has no real existence. If some events <HI>seem</HI> fortuitous, it is because we have not a sufficiency of knowledge, by which to trace the chain of combinations that necessarily produced them: just as some places, and some seasons, <HI>seem</HI> totally dark to us; because our optic system is so framed and attempered, that, on various occasions, the human eye is unable to collect those scattered and proportionably expanded rays, from which no place whatever is entirely secluded.</P>
<P N="8">8. In common conversation we frequently speak of <HI>solar eclipses.</HI> But what is called an <HI>eclipse</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> is, in fact, an eclipse of the earth; oc∣casioned by the Moon's interference, or transit, between the Sun and us. This circumstance makes no alteration in the Sun itself, but only intercepts <HI>our view</HI> of it for a time.—From whence does darkness of soul, even darkness that may be felt, usually originate? Never from any changeableness in our covenant GOD, the glory of whose unvary∣ing faithfulness and love shines the same, and can suffer no eclipse. 'Tis when the world, with its
<PB N="172" REF="038552_0174_101259C40AF62318"/>
fascinating honours, or wealth, or pleasures, <HI>gets between</HI> our Lord and us, that the light of his countenance is obstructed, and our rejoicing in him suffers a temporary eclipse.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>Mists</HI> and <HI>vapours,</HI> rising from the earth, sometimes operate as a vail, and hide the Sun from our eyes; 'till the superior influence of its beams <HI>overpower</HI> the ascending nuisance, and <HI>dissipate</HI> the noxious steams.—Thus do the remaining corrup∣tions of a regenerate heart <HI>dim</HI> the prospect of sal∣vation, and <HI>damp</HI> the fervour of inherent grace. Nothing can again <HI>brighten</HI> the former, and <HI>warm</HI> the latter into lively exercise, but the splendour of God's repeated rising on the soul. Happy it is, for his benighted people, that, as mists and clouds may seem to <HI>obscure</HI> the Sun, but cannot <HI>extinguish</HI> him, nor even <HI>hinder</HI> the access of his rays beyond a certain time; so that faithful Jehovah, who knows what is in man, and who is still <HI>greater</HI> [in mercy and power] <HI>than our hearts</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 John iii. 20.</NOTE> can be in point of sinful depravation, will finally subdue our iniquities, shine away our fears, purify us from all our dross, and perfectly conform us to the image of his holi∣ness.</P>
<P N="10">10. How preferable is the original, durable and
<PB N="173" REF="038552_0175_101259C766D5BDF0"/>
vivifying light of the Sun, to the borrowed, evanid, unanimating lustre of the Moon! The former, while it <HI>illuminates</HI> the eye, and <HI>uncovers</HI> the ele∣gant scenes of creation, <HI>warms</HI> the earth, and makes it <HI>fruitful;</HI> diffuses <HI>cheerfulness,</HI> and im∣parts <HI>enrichment,</HI> to no fewer than <HI>six</HI> primary, and to <HI>ten</HI> secondary worlds.—As great is the dif∣ference between a cool, historical faith, that floats in a contemplative head, and the faith of God's elect, which warms, invigorates, and purifies the heart. The former is a mere <HI>moon-light</HI> faith, which, however <HI>clear,</HI> so far as it goes, yet leaves us as <HI>cold</HI> and as <HI>barren</HI> as it found us. The latter, like the <HI>solar</HI> communications, <HI>enlivens</HI> and <HI>fer∣tilizes</HI> the soul; filling it with joy and peace, through the power of the Holy Ghost, and adorn∣ing it with the <HI>gems,</HI> and <HI>flowers,</HI> and <HI>fruits,</HI> of grace.</P>

<HEAD>The Difference between the GATES of DEATH and the DOORS of the SHADOW of DEATH.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L><HI>Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?</HI></L>
<BIBL>Job xxxviii. 17.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN this double interrogation are described the two passages through which all mankind, the wicked and the righteous, pass from time to eternity;—passages these, infinitely more different in their nature and consequences, than the terrifying gates which conduct a prisoner to a tremendous dun∣geon, and the beautiful doors which admit us to a magnificent palace.</P>
<P>THE GATES OF DEATH is the passage of man from this to an unseen state, and, figuratively, de∣signs that truly affecting period when the powers of human nature break up;—the cutting of the cord of life;—the separation of the soul from the body. This dissolution, as a pair of massy gates, forms the division between time and eternity. As these gates unfold, <HI>Eternity</HI> appears, and its events rush, with solemn awe, upon the mind:—as they
<PB N="175" REF="038552_0177_101259CB79182278"/>
close with the present state, its unbounded enjoy∣ments vanish; and the creature, stripped of all, bids the world an everlasting farewell! These gates to some, through lingering disease, may long appear in view; while opening, they may grate upon the ear like harsh thunder; but, the passage through them is instantaneous, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye. At this prospect, our nature recoils. The expectation of our passage through these gates embitters the cup of life, and bows our spirits to the dust.</P>
<P>But whence this dreadful passage to futurity? Can that wise and holy BEING, who hath enriched us with such noble powers, strowed in our path such a variety of earthly pleasures, appoint us such an end? Is this worthy his attributes, or conso∣nant with his benevolence? Surely not. God cannot take pleasure in the destruction of the work of his own hand. Sin, sin procured mankind this terrifying exit from time to eternity. The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The wages of sin is death. By sin came death. Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return. How mortifying this to our carnal pride; and how alarming to our fears? It was our transgressions against the good law of our Creator that compelled the hand of his justice to raise those gates of death; the wretchedness of
<PB N="176" REF="038552_0178_101259CF2B3EFFC8"/>
man's death is but the fruit of his own disobedient life.</P>
<P>Let us ask, to whence these <HI>gates of death</HI> con∣duct mankind? To determine and explore a fu∣ture state, philosophers, in every age, have em∣ployed their greatest powers; and although Nature herself dictates the existence of such a state, it is Revelation alone that informs us what state it is. Here we learn, that <HI>as it is appointed to men once to die, so after this the judgment.</HI> Heb. ix. 27. That <HI>God hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness, by Jesus Christ, whom he hath ordained.</HI> Acts xvii. 31. Solemn period! big with pleasure or with pain! Jesus; surrounded with myriads of angels, shall rend the heavens, raise the dead, bring forth the imprisoned nations of the universe, and <HI>reward every man according to his works!</HI> Mat. xvi. 27. What reward can a guilty sinner expect from the hand of that God whose law he hath transgressed, whose unnumbered mercies he has abused, and whose con∣science condemns him of every evil that merits the severest frowns from incensed justice? What, in∣deed, can be expected but the severe penalty of DEATH annexed to that law which binds us to the authority of Jehovah! Men of cool reflection must acknowledge that nature, reason, conscience,
<PB N="177" REF="038552_0179_101259D0C97B71C8"/>
and revelation, harmonize in pointing to this so∣lemn period that shall terminate our state. It must be so. The thousands who laugh at the bugbear death, have their secret remorse and dread of a future state, though pride and boasting infidelity prevent confession. It is folly in the fool to say he hath not thought, nor shuddered at the opening gates of death which lead a fellow mortal to that judgment-feat from whence there is no appeal. Who then but must drop a tear over the miseries of human nature: so miserable a life; so wretched an end! Is there no balm to heal our woe? Can we discover no other passage from time to eternity, which, at least, may mitigate the pangs of dissolv∣ing nature, and give us some degree of hope? Yes, there is a way, worthy the God who hath appoint∣ed it, and, at once, delightful and secure for mor∣tals. There are—</P>
<P>THE DOORS OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH. These were erected by Jesus, the friend of sinners, the Son of the Most High God; whose eye beheld our wretched state, and whose heart engaged him to redeem from the jaws of death and hell. For this he assumed our nature, became incarnate, took our iniquities, with all their heinousness and guilt, upon himself, that by the merit of his life, and the virtue of his death, he might save us
<PB N="178" REF="038552_0180_101229FF6AE68F28"/>
with a complete and everlasting salvation. This is the sublime, the rapturous theme of the gospel! <HI>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us.</HI> He bore our sins in his own body on the accursed tree;—put an end of sin by the sacrifice of himself;—became obe∣dient unto the death of the cross;—and arose from the tomb in testimony of his conquest, and to de∣monstrate our justification in him. Thus Jesus entered the <HI>gates of death,</HI> and, in the dominions of the dead, disarmed the <HI>King of Terrors</HI> of his sting; bound him in chains; made himself master of <HI>the keys of death;</HI> tore down the awful gates, and, upon their ruins, erected the DOORS OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH, as the passage through which his redeemed people should walk, to inherit the mansions of glory. Here is our happy relief! <HI>Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ hath abo∣lished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel.</HI> Death and the grave are now at the command of Jesus: and in him we may triumphantly exclaim, "O Death! where is now thy sting? O Grave! where is now thy vic∣tory?"</P>
<P>These doors, erected by the Son of God, differ as much from the gates of death as the shadow from its substance. As a shadow is created by the
<PB N="179" REF="038552_0181_101259D4FB7709A8"/>
rays of light falling upon an opake body, so Jesus, the glorious Sun of Righteousness, who is the re∣surrection and life of his people, reflects his media∣torial light upon death as a conquered foe, and thus his mortal shadow is produced. As the sha∣dow of the greatest enemy can do no one an inju∣ry, so believers will pass the shadow of death in perfect safety. Behold! how different the pros∣pect! Not the terrible gates of an eternal dungeon, but the magnificent doors of a delightful city; or, as the consecrated doors of the temple of Solomon, which introduced the pardoned worshipper to au∣dience with JEHOVAH, in the Holy of Holies!</P>
<P>As the doors of the shadow of death differ from the gates of death, so does the avenue that conducts mankind to them. Jesus is the way, the truth and the life to the Father. <HI>If any man be in Christ Jesus, he is a new creature.</HI> By a spiritual, be∣lieving union with Christ, the soul experiences new light, life, hopes and pleasures: Truth, love, meekness, benevolence, patience, every virtue com∣manded by the law, or resplendent in the gospel, are more or less attendant on this christian's path, and renders him honourable to God, beneficial to society, and happy in himself. To him, to live is Christ, and, therefore, to die must be his gain. David was a man enriched with such grace, and
<PB N="180" REF="038552_0182_101259D85CD48610"/>
viewed his passage to eternity with the utmost com∣posure. <HI>Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.</HI> Psa. xxiii. This valley lies between God's two holy hills of the church militant and the church triumphant. It was but the shadow, the faint image, the sweet sleep of death, he was to pass. Every fear should vanish as the vapour, and the presence of his Lord and Shepherd should sustain him with the rod of his power, and comfort him with the sweets of his love.</P>
<P>This passage through the doors of the shadow of death, does not simply mitigate the pangs of dis∣solving nature, but it bears the soul triumphantly from time to eternity, in prospect of a final acquittal at the judgment-seat, and an introduction to the blissful presence of the Lord of glory. As the christian draws near the close of life, the doors of the shadow of death gradually unfold. It is pecu∣liar to this man's hope to know at which passage he is to make his exit. He knows Jesus has been his fore-runner, and has, in great grace, appointed him the <HI>delightful doors,</HI> and not the <HI>doleful gates.</HI> As these doors open, the everlasting hills appear in view; Angels surround the passage to welcome the dying christian to immortality; Jesus, his well-known,
<PB N="181" REF="038552_0183_101259DBBA521590"/>
tried friend, that sticketh closer than a brother, stands ready to own and support him in his last conflict, and introduce him to pleasures that never, never decline. Here, at last, we must stop. Were we to collect the greatest assemblage of earthly honours, riches, and delights, they would infinitely fail in assisting our ideas to estimate the bliss, the glory of heaven!</P>
<P>Let me now prevail upon the attentive reader to take a glance of these two passages to eternity. This becomes his duty, from a consciousness that through ONE of these he must shortly pass, to return no more. One is beyond degree terrible, leading the thoughtless, the prophane, the unbelieving, the self-deceived sinner to the judgment of the great day, and to miseries beyond description awful! the other to the mansions of undisturbed repose, and happiness coeval with eternity! The former is the necessary consequence of sin; the latter is the fruit of God's everlasting love, and the sove∣reign grace of the Lord Jesus. To which are we hastening? Let us, as sinners, fly to the Saviour's arms, to be pardoned in his blood, justified in his righteousness, and made holy by his grace; then we shall anticipate the doors of the shadow of death with cheerfulness, and know for ourselves,
<PB N="182" REF="038552_0184_101259DD56F3E678"/>
that "Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord; and precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints."</P>

<HEAD>OBITUARY.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Mr. JOHN COBBY.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE the heroes of the field, the votaries of dissipation, and the professors of art, each claim a place in the page of history, to perpetuate their names and their actions to posterity, it shall be our ambition to allot a few leaves, in this publication, to the memory of those whose better hearts and lives proclaim the richest grace of God. Thus, while <HI>the memory of the just is blessed,</HI> we set their example before our eyes, to stimulate us to walk in the paths of Jesus, and await, with com∣posure and joy, the period of our own departure to an eternal state.</P>
<P>The person to be recorded in this obituary is Deacon JOHN COBBY. He was a native of Great-Britain, born at Brighthelmstone. What∣ever
<PB N="183" REF="038552_0185_101259E008D283B0"/>
may have been the temper and conduct of his juvenile years, whether moral or vicious, we learn that God was pleased to call him, by grace, at an early period; and which stimulated his heart, through the successive stages of his life, to pray for, and ardently desire, the conversion of youth. In the first exercises of his mind he was remarka∣bly lively, and frequented public worship, among christians of different religious denominations.—When the blaze of his zeal began to fall, and the more solid influence of grace to operate upon his heart, he was convinced that the Lord who re∣deemed him was King in Zion, that he was called <HI>to have respect unto all his commandments,</HI> for public worship as well as for private life; and that it was his duty to gain more satisfaction on the will of the Saviour than hitherto he had at∣tained. He was constant in prayer, and diligent in searching the scripture, as the only rule for his faith and practice. At this period his judgment was greatly informed, by a discourse he heard from Numb. x. 29. <HI>We are journeying unto the place of which the Lord said, I will give it you: come thou with us, and we will do thee good: for the Lord hath spoken good concerning Israel.</HI> From clear conviction of duty, and with that so∣lemn reverence, the savor of which ever abode
<PB N="184" REF="038552_0186_101259E3644BEA78"/>
with him, he publicly owned his Redeemer in bap∣tism, by immersion, on confession of his faith; then was received into christian fellowship by the church at Woolwich, under the care of the Rev. Mr. M'Gregor, and walked with that people in honour for some years. For good and sufficient reasons, unnecessary to be mentioned here, he united with a new-gathered church in the same town, under the ministry of Mr. Adam Freeman.</P>
<P>Mr. Cobby, although he held a place in his Ma∣jesty's dock-yard at Woolwich, was, in political sentiment, a republican; which, united with a warm attachment to America, induced him, with his family, to quit his native shore, and form a settlement in New-York. Perfectly satisfied with this favoured land, Mr. Cobby obtained an ho∣nourable and affectionate dismission from the church at Woolwich, and united himself with the church in Fair-street, where, after due trial, he was ap∣pointed a deacon, which office he sustained until his death.</P>
<P>He was a person of very great diffidence of spi∣rit, possessing an abiding sense of the evils of his heart, and his utter unworthiness, both in the sight of God and man; frequently adoring the riches of God's abounding grace in the salvation of him as the chief of sinners, and the vilest of the vile. Al∣though
<PB N="185" REF="038552_0187_10125AC3981B3BF0"/>
Providence had denied Mr. Cobby the ad∣vantages of education—nor had he ever possessed a dictionary—yet he was enriched with a most agree∣able poetic talent, specimens of which have repeat∣edly been introduced into the <HI>Christian's Pocket Library.</HI> He published a poetic essay on the Per∣son and Glory of Christ, and of the Holy Spirit; which met with good reception from many intelli∣gent, pious readers. He has left behind him a considerable number of hymns, and other poetical pieces, which, was due encouragement given to his widow, their publication might be of real bene∣fit. His memory was remarkably strong and accu∣rate, particularly so in the knowledge of the sacred scripture, repeating texts verbatim, with solemn emphasis. It always gave him extreme pain to hear any one, especially a minister in the pulpit, torture a text by false reading, or repeating. And, I cannot but recommend an accurate reading of the sacred text to my young readers in particular; and, whatever passage they may commit to memory, that it be done perfectly. If it is of no other be∣nefit, it certainly discovers an attentive and an ho∣nest heart towards the will of God. But, what was still more commendable in Mr. Cobby, was his uniformity and steadfastness in sentiment, and profession of the gospel, in his family, and in the
<PB N="186" REF="038552_0188_10122A0FA0135D60"/>
house of God. Through the influence of God's blessed spirit upon his heart, <HI>he was planted in the house of the Lord, and flourished in the courts of our God. He still brought forth fruit,</HI> even <HI>to old age.</HI> Psa. xcii. 13, 14. So far from the pro∣hibition of Solomon refering to him—<HI>meddle not with them that are given to change,</HI> Prov. xxiv. 21. like ancient Judah, <HI>he ruled with God, and was faithful to the saints.</HI> Hosea xi. 12. None could attend to the voice of this good man's prayer, whether in his family or in the social circle of his friends, without a conviction that, in that solemn exercise, he really <HI>drew near to God.</HI> Although, in private conversation, and when in the discharge of his duty as a deacon, his words were few, and his lips <HI>slow of speech,</HI> yet in prayer they were abundant, copious, lively, and truly solemn; every by-stander feeling their weight upon the mind. Latterly, it was evident to myself and others, that his communion with God was so great, that he was ripening, as the standing corn, for the sickle of death, and for the heavenly garner.</P>
<P>When pestilence raged in our streets, and swept away thousands, young and old, Mr. Cobby was therewith arrested, and laid upon his dying pillow. The process of the dire disease, with him, was very short. He instantly felt the arrows of death,
<PB N="187" REF="038552_0189_10122A34E7145948"/>
and wished <HI>to depart, to be with Christ,</HI> whom, unseen, he ardently loved. The nature of the malady prevented him from saying much; but he evidently felt richly the presence of that Saviour whom he then commended to all around him as <HI>the Friend that sticketh closer than a brother.</HI> Prov. xviii. 24. He repeated frequently the nine∣tieth and the hundred and third Psalm (Dr. Watts') with infinite satisfaction. Perceiving his end to draw near, he called his family around him, and, in a faithful, affecting manner, addressed his wife and his children. A stranger, who came to attend him, was astonished at the scene; to whom Mr. Cobby said, "My friend, I do not know you, or whether you know the Lord, but I can now tell you, Christ is worth living for, and dying for; and he is now precious to my soul" He then sent his christian love to his minister, and to the members of his church, with others, mentioned by name. This done, he piously committed himself to God; then resigned himself to the last efforts of death. And, as though the pestilence was ordered by heaven to withhold its fury until the good man had performed his last work of faith and love be∣low, it now rushed upon him; poured in its sharp∣est arrows; distorted his body; silenced his speech; produced the most distressing groans; and, in one
<PB N="188" REF="038552_0190_101259E5E3D92790"/>
hour, closed his eyes in death! aged 55 years. A discourse was delivered on his death from these words: <HI>God took him.</HI> Gen. v. 24. Let us, therefore, fly for refuge to a Saviour's bleeding heart, and walk beneath his shadow; for <HI>precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints,</HI> whether it be in youth or in old age, at sea or on land, by slow disease, or by the nauseous pestilence!</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON THE FULNESS OF JESUS CHRIST.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>In HIM all the fulness of God</L>
<L>Forever transcendently shines;</L>
<L>Though once like a mortal he stood</L>
<L>To finish his gracious designs.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TO contemplate the fulness of Christ, must af∣ford the most sublime satisfaction to a believing soul; not only as it leads to a discovery of the glory of the Redeemer's person; but, as it is opposed to all the guilt, the wretchedness, and the ruin of man;
<PB N="194" REF="038552_0196_101259F535B82E98"/>
and is the only source from whence restoration, peace, holiness, happiness, and glory can possibly flow.—A fulness that, at once, supplies the moral wants of the sinner in this life, and constitutes his blessedness in the next! It is, nevertheless, confessed, that the subject is infinite; and its publication better suits a glorified spirit before the throne of heaven, than a frail creature here below. However, the blessed Jesus hath put his treasure into earthen ves∣sels, and hath commissioned men, under the in∣fluence of his presence, to teach and preach his gos∣pel. Our attempt, therefore, in this Essay, to ex∣plain the fulness of Jesus, we hope, will be at∣tended with a blessing, and make known a ray of the glory of Christ, who is our <HI>all and in all.</HI></P>
<P>FULNESS is a term used by the New Testament writers to express the glory of the GODHEAD, the purity of the MANHOOD; the MEDIATO∣RIAL SUFFICIENCY of the LORD MESSIAH, and the perfection of his BRIDE THE CHURCH.</P>
<P N="1">1. In Jesus Christ we see resplendent the fulness of all those attributes, honours and productions that ever were, or ever can be ascribed to the self-ex∣istent and eternal JEHOVAH. He is <HI>the first and the last, the beginning and the end—the Almighty.</HI> Isa. xli. 4. Rev. i. 11, 17. <HI>The God of the whole earth.</HI> Isa. liv. 5. <HI>God and none else.</HI> Isa. xlv.
<PB N="195" REF="038552_0197_101259F7B41FEAF8"/>
22. <HI>Over all, God blessed for ever.</HI> Rom. ix. 5. <HI>The mighty God.</HI> Isa. ix. 5. <HI>Our God.</HI> Isa. xl. 3. <HI>My Lord and my God!</HI> John xx. 28. Creation and Providence, which are the immediate and exclusive works of JEHOVAH, are ascribed to Jesus; for, <HI>he was before all things, and by him all things consist.</HI> Col. i. 17. The seas obeyed his voice; devils trembled at his presence; angels worship at his footstool; and those who were num∣bered among the polluted dead, arose at his com∣mand! <HI>The whole earth is full of his glory.</HI> Isa. vi. 3. <HI>Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints!</HI> These are scripture testimonies of MESSIAH; acknowledged, as such, by all chris∣tian writers; and are demonstrative of his eternal power and Godhead.</P>
<P N="2">2. The term <HI>fulness</HI> assists our contemplation on that HUMANITY which, in the highest possible degree of perfection, was possessed by Jesus of Na∣zareth. His body, passions, senses, emotions, life, all were the complete measure and scale of human beings. As such, <HI>he was made under the law,</HI> Gal. iv. 4. and possessed a moral capacity to obey all its spiritual precepts. Truth, love, benevolence, holiness, magnanimity, constituting the fulness of human excellence, in its highest lustre, so shone
<PB N="196" REF="038552_0198_101259FA338FEBB0"/>
through all his private and public character, as confounded his adversaries, and compelled Satan to retire, without a possibility of finding any evil in him; while it demonstrated the scripture testimony concerning him, that <HI>he was holy, harmless, un∣defiled, and separate from sinners.</HI> Heb. vii. 26. Without this human excellence, he, by no means, could have been competent to have answered for us, whether by precept or by penalty. But, as the <HI>just One,</HI> the Messiah, he was represented by all the perfect animals appointed for ancient sacri∣fice, and by the pure bodily qualifications neces∣sary to constitute the High Priest under the Mo∣saic law. Thus, according to the prediction of Isaiah, we see in Jesus, <HI>the man more precious than gold, even the golden wedge of Ophir.</HI> Isa. xiii. 12.</P>
<P N="3">3. But the particular intention of the inspired writers in the use of the term <HI>fulness,</HI> is to describe the completeness, ability, and richness of Jesus Christ, as the BRIDEGROOM, MEDIATOR, and REDEEMER of his Church. This arises from the union between the human and divine natures in one person; the recital of which forms a dis∣tinguishing feature both in the Old and New Tes∣taments. <HI>Great is the mystery of godliness, God manifest in the flesh!</HI> 1 Tim. iii. 16. <HI>Immanuel,
<PB N="197" REF="038552_0199_101259FBD1258E90"/>
God with us.</HI> Mat. i. 23. <HI>In him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.</HI> Col. ii. 9 This is the <HI>man,</HI> the <HI>shepherd,</HI> who bears the won∣derful appellation of Jehovah's <HI>fellow;</HI> Zech. xiii. 7.—who could confidently affirm, <HI>I and my Fa∣ther are one.</HI> John x. 30. <HI>All things that the Father hath, are mine.</HI> John xvi. 15. And this is he whom Paul celebrates as <HI>the brightness of his Father's glory, and the express image of his person.</HI> Heb. i. 3. In him we behold that dis∣tinguished personage, long predicted by Isaiah, THE MIGHTY GOD, in his divinity; THE CHILD BORN in his humanity; THE SON GIVEN in union of both natures, able and mighty to redeem. Isa. ix. 5. Stand, my soul, and, with solemn reverence, behold the glory of the Lord Christ! possessed of all the fulness of underived, self-existent Godhead, and all the fulness of immaculate manhood; each nature admirably distinct, with their attendant at∣tributes; yet so wonderfully united as neither of them are confounded; operating in the grand de∣signs of grace in the oneness of a glorious Saviour!</P>
<P>By this union, both natures were active to re∣deem; the natural body, and rational soul of Jesus, were constituted, or accounted GUILT, as the sub∣stance of the one offering for sin; while the INFI∣NITY of the GODHEAD, communicated to the
<PB N="198" REF="038552_0200_101259FD6B7B06F8"/>
acts of the humanity, rendered them meritorious to the important purposes of our justification, par∣don, sanctification, and eternal glory! To which we add, that the human nature of Christ, being <HI>flesh of our flesh, and bone of our bone,</HI> the Church, as his BRIDE, was found in him, as Eve in the person of Adam, which conjugal union gave him a regal right to take all her contractions, debts, evils, &amp;c. &amp;c. upon himself, become responsible, and to suffer and die in her stead.</P>
<P>The same humanity of Jesus, the Bridegroom, forms the all-sufficient glorious channel, through which very spiritual blessing or grace flows to the objects of his love. <HI>For both he that sanctifieth, and they who are sanctified, are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them bre∣thren.</HI> Heb. ii. 11. It hath pleased the Father, that in him all fulness should dwell; and out of his fulness have we all received grace for grace.</P>
<P N="4">4. We are, lastly, to consider the term <HI>fulness,</HI> as expressive of the perfection of the Church of Christ. Paul asserts this in his epistle to the Ephe∣sians i. 22, 23. <HI>The head over all things to his church, which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.</HI> The <HI>head</HI> forms no com∣plete <HI>body</HI>—the members must be united to it;—neither, if the members be incomplete, a hand, an
<PB N="199" REF="038552_0201_10125A01B9EF1DA0"/>
eye, or foot wanting, the body is not in fulness: Therefore, the church, every elect, spiritual mem∣ber, existing in every age and clime, united to Christ the life-giving head, by covenant, and by grace, makes the <HI>fulness</HI> of the Redeemer's body. The same charming truth is expressed from the nature of man, as created to enjoy conjugal rela∣tion:—<HI>neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man in the Lord. For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things are of God.</HI> 1 Cor. xi. 11, 12. Christ is the husband of his church; his character, as such, must fail, with∣out his bride; she is, therefore, his fulness. All his love, power, grace, every part of his mediato∣rial riches are given to her. The church, invisi∣ble or collective, or his spiritual members, indi∣vidually, are the fulness of Christ; their life, peace, comfort, happiness, they derive from him; they have nothing they can claim as their own but what is freely bestowed by marriage-contract. No in∣ward grace; no outward privilege, but bears the stamp of Jesus;—his ministers are given <HI>for the perfecting of the saints; for the edifying of the body of Christ, till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the sta∣ture
<PB N="200" REF="038552_0202_10125A035679E800"/>
of the fulness of Christ.</HI> Eph. iv. 11—13. And when the Bride, the Lamb's wife, shall have made herself ready, it shall be granted unto her, that she shall be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white; for the white linen is the righteousness of the saints. And blessed are they that shall be call∣ed to the marriage-supper of the Lamb. Rev. xix. 8, 9.</P>
<P>It is of infinite moment we learn, from the gos∣pel, that the manner in which the fulness of Jesus is communicated to his people is by the HOLY GHOST. <HI>He shall glorify me: for he shall re∣ceive of mine, and shall shew it unto you. All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.</HI> John xvi. 14, 15. This blessed Spi∣rit is the bond of the soul's union to Christ. He first regenerates and converts the soul; creates that faith which enables the heart to embrace Jesus in all the glory of his fulness, and then maintains the soul, day by day, in the reception of it, to answer all the purposes of obedience, sanctification, com∣fort, perseverance unto death. <HI>Thus, as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.</HI> And if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his. Rom. viii. 9, 14.</P>
<P>Accurately to estimate the value, variety, and
<PB N="201" REF="038552_0203_10125A05D68C3B68"/>
debt of the fulness of Jesus, is absolutely impos∣sible by men or angels. Exalted on his throne as King in Zion, he hath a fulness of light to illumi∣nate Jew and Gentile from pole to pole. In the af∣flictions of his church, he hath been her dwelling place in all generations; stored with unsearchable riches for her consolation. Not a <HI>promise</HI> in the Bible, not an <HI>office</HI> or <HI>relation</HI> which the Son of God sustains, nor an <HI>ordinance</HI> which he hath ap∣pointed, but proclaim the inconceivable excellence and glory of his fulness! Who knoweth the num∣ber of immortal souls which, in every age, of every tongue, and of every clime, for near six thousand years, have derived virtue from the Redeemer's fulness, and were made whole and happy? What blessedness is now enjoyed by the spirits of the just made perfect in Heaven? <HI>A number that no man can number.</HI> And, what glories shall the Bride re∣ceive, <HI>who is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all!</HI> Eph. i. 23. ZION, BEHOLD YOUR KING! this is he of whom the prophets wrote, and this is he on whom we believe, for present peace and everlasting life. While, there∣fore, we sojourn here below, in hope of endless bliss, let every tongue exclaim.—HALLELUJAH, FOR THE LORD GOD OMNIPOTENT REIGN∣ETH!</P>

<HEAD>An Attempt to estimate Human Guilt, and the Virtues of Redemption, by our Lord and Sa∣viour JESUS CHRIST.</HEAD>
<P>THE moral law of God, which is the standard of human purity and obedience, and which binds us to God's authoritative justice, cannot, in its own nature, make any allowance for human infirmity, or admit any abatement of the perfect conformity which it demands. <HI>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbour as thyself.</HI> Luke x. 27. <HI>Cursed is every one who continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the law to do them.</HI> Gal. iii. 10. <HI>The soul that sinneth, it shall die.</HI> Ezk. xviii. 4. In the eye of the law, and in the es∣timation of the Lawgiver, the risings of <HI>wrath</HI> are tantamount to <HI>murder;</HI> the calling any man a fool, exposes us to the penalty of <HI>hell-fire;</HI> and an <HI>im∣pure thought</HI> brings us under the condemnation of actual <HI>adultery.</HI> Mat. v. 22—28. What infer∣ence will a truly conscious, enlightened mind, draw from these alarming premises? That which the apostle terms an <HI>evident</HI> one, and evident in∣deed it is—that, <HI>no man is justified by the law, in the sight of God.</HI> Gal. iii. 11. For, a <HI>single</HI>
<PB N="203" REF="038552_0205_10125A0C11A307A8"/>
breach of the law renders us guilty of the <HI>whole.</HI> James ii. 10.</P>
<P>Supposing a person was to break the law <HI>once</HI> in twenty-four hours, to how many would his sins amount, in a life of ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, or eighty years?—At <HI>ten</HI> years of age, it would amount to 3,650—at <HI>twenty</HI> years end the catalogue would rise to 7,300—at <HI>thirty,</HI> to 10,950—at <HI>forty,</HI> to 14,600—at <HI>fifty,</HI> to 18,250—at <HI>sixty,</HI> to 21,900—at <HI>seventy,</HI> to 25,550—at <HI>eighty,</HI> to 29,200.</P>
<P>What, if a person's sins are supposed to bear a double proportion to the foregoing estimate; in that case his sins, at the age of <HI>ten</HI> years, will be multiplied to 7,300—at <HI>twenty,</HI> to 14,600—at <HI>thirty,</HI> to 21,900—at <HI>forty,</HI> to 29,200—at <HI>fifty,</HI> to 36,500—at <HI>sixty,</HI> to 43,800—at <HI>seventy,</HI> to 51,100—at <HI>eighty,</HI> to 58,400.</P>
<P>We must go farther still. What if a man's sins keep exact pace with every <HI>hour</HI> of his life? i. e. supposing him to sin <HI>twenty-four</HI> times a day, his sins will then amount, in a life of <HI>ten</HI> years, to 87,600—at <HI>twenty</HI> years of age, they will accu∣mulate to 175,200—at <HI>thirty,</HI> to 262,800—at <HI>forty,</HI> to 350,400—at <HI>fifty,</HI> to 438,000—at <HI>sixty,</HI> to 525,600—at <HI>seventy,</HI> to 613,200—at <HI>eighty,</HI> to 700,800.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="038552_0206_10125A0DAA490AF0"/>
Is there a single <HI>minute</HI> from the first of our exist∣ence to the very period of death, wherein we come up to the fulness of that inward and outward holi∣ness which God's all-perfect law requires? Cer∣tainly not. Of how many sins then is each of the human race guilty, reckoning only at the rate of <HI>one sin</HI> for <HI>every</HI> minute? At <HI>ten</HI> years old, we, according to that method of calculation, are guilty of no fewer than 5,256,000 sins—at <HI>thirty,</HI> of 15,568,000—at <HI>forty,</HI> of 21,024,000—at <HI>fifty,</HI> of 26,280,000—at <HI>sixty,</HI> of 31,536,000—at <HI>seventy,</HI> of 36,792,000—at <HI>eighty,</HI> of 42,048,000.</P>
<P>The awakened conscious breast, reviewing his past life, and estimating his transgressions, may ask, "When shall I pay off this immense debt?" Ne∣ver. Eternity itself, so far from <HI>clearing</HI> us from the dreadful arrears, would only <HI>add</HI> to the score, by plunging us deeper and deeper, even to infinity. Stop, thoughtless youth, no longer indulge thy fol∣lies, nor view them as obliterated by the stream of time! No, they still exist—how vast their num∣bers—how vile their nature—how awful their con∣sequences! Let manhood too, with old age, reflect with grief on the great, the astonishing number of their offences, nor suffer the busy scenes of life, and the power of an infernal tempter, to delude their souls! But, will not divine goodness <HI>com∣pound</HI>
<PB N="205" REF="038552_0207_10125A102563F1F8"/>
for the debt, by accepting <HI>loss</HI> than we owe? Impossible! Every attribute of the Most High God guards every precept of his holy law; not one of these can fail; <HI>Justice and judgment are the ha∣bitation of his throne.</HI> Psal. xcvii. 2. Are we not able to help ourselves, so as to elude the power of this sentence? We cannot. What human law exists that has made provision for the restoration of that man who is found a transgressor? There is none; but, immediately on conviction, pours down the penalty of judgment, nor once presumes to ac∣cept of compensation. How then can fallen man, indebted and undone, and naught to pay, offer restoration for his soul? <HI>Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and bow myself before the Most High God? Shall I come before him with burnt-offerings, with calves of a year old? Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my first-born for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?</HI> Micah vi. 6, 7. These cannot be accepted; the law demands <HI>per∣sonal, human,</HI> satisfaction; commensurate to its requirements and its penalties. How truly wretched is the state of guilty man lost in himself! No man can redeem his brother, or give to God a ransom
<PB N="206" REF="038552_0208_10125A11C1F51D28"/>
for him! An angel's arm cannot pluck him from the gulph of woe!</P>
<P>But, sing O heavens, and rejoice O earth! God's own arm brought salvation, and his righte∣ousness sustained him! <HI>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us.</HI> Gal. iii. 13. His merit, as GOD-MAN, constituted by his Father, the second Adam, head and bridegroom of the Church, answered every precept of the law by his life, and every penalty by his death, for, and in the stead of his people. This is the grand theme of the gospel; this it is that renders Christ worthy of all acceptation. In HIM, pardoned, justified, accepted; and to him that has thus redeemed us to God, by his blood, be all the glory!</P>
<P>Let now the true believer in Christ attempt, from the foregoing estimate of the number of hu∣man crimes, to view the vast guilt of his immortal soul; then, <HI>Behold the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world!</HI> John i. 29. What peace, gratitude, and joy must flow into such an heart!</P>
<LG>
<L>Who now shall urge a second claim?</L>
<L>The <HI>Law</HI> no longer can condemn;</L>
<L>FAITH, a release can show:</L>
<L>JUSTICE itself a Friend appears,</L>
<L><HI>Loose him, and let him go!</HI></L>

<P><PB N="207" REF="038552_0209_10125A1605C2EE08"/>
But Jesus suffered not for ONE soul only, but for a people whom no man can number. If, there∣fore, the sins of an individual amount to so vast a sum, who can calculate the number of the whole Church at large, whom Christ hath redeemed out of all nations, languages, kindred and tongues? O thou divine, incarnate, bleeding, atoning, rising, interceding Lord and Christ! Not all the <HI>seraphs</HI> thou hast created—not all the saints thy love hath ransomed—not all which thy mighty power hath glorified before thy brilliant throne, can compre∣hend the height, the length, the breadth, the depth, of gratitude and love, a believing soul owes to THEE!</P>

<P>TO contemplate the ascension of Jesus, while we are in certain prospect of death and the grave, must be deemed a necessary and an animating em∣ploy.

<P>To the thief upon the cross our Lord said, <HI>This day thou shalt be with me in Paradise</HI>—the heavenly state of bliss assigned for the reception of his departed soul. The body of Jesus died; was taken from the cross; was embalmed with spices; and then laid in Joseph's new tomb.</P>
<P>On the third day the soul of Jesus returned from the celestial paradise, claimed its entomed body, re∣animated it by union, burst the bars of death, and came forward, performing many of the functions
<PB N="209" REF="038552_0211_10125A1A1B2B8930"/>
of natural life, as it had done previous to its cru∣cifixion.</P>
<P>After converse with his disciples forty days, and appearing <HI>to five hundred brethren at once,</HI>—to convince them of the resurrection of the very same identical body, he went with many of his dis∣ciples as far as Bethamy, and there, in the very act of blessing them, was visibly parted from them, and a cloud received him out of their sight. Luke xxi. 50, 51. Escorted by myriads of angels, he was then <HI>set down at the right hand of the Majesty on High,</HI> as a proof of the glory of his person, the completeness of his works, and as having <HI>become the first fruit of them that slept.</HI> From thence, according to his own infallible prediction, he will come again to judge the world, and to receive his people unto himself, to be partakers of his eternal glory.</P>
<P>This twofold ascent of the human soul of Christ, first without the body, then with the body and soul united, is the same with the privilege of his re∣deemed people. Their bodies first return to the dust from whence they were taken; and, instantly, their souls, their immortal spirits, ascend to God who gave them. Eccl. xii. 7. <HI>Absent from the body, present with the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>But, on that glorious morning, when the <HI>trump of God shall sound,</HI> and the dead in Christ arise from their graves, whether in earth, or in the bo∣som
<PB N="210" REF="038552_0212_10125A1BD91D8CD8"/>
of the seas, then shall their souls also, as did the holy soul of their Lord and Head, each claim their own proper body, now, by the power of God, made like unto the glorious body of the Son of God. <HI>Every man</HI> shall be raised <HI>in his own order: Christ the first fruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.</HI> 1 Cor. xv. 23.</P>
<P>Blessed and holy are they that have part in this first resurrection: on such, the second death hath no power; but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years. Rev. xx. 6. Then, after Satan shall be losed for a little season, <HI>Gog and Magog,</HI> the combined armies of sin and Satan, filling up the measure of their iniquity, shall be prepared for the final judgment; the Redeemer shall welcome his saints to ultimate final glory! <HI>Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from before the foundation of the world.</HI></P>
<P>How delightful the prospect! How worthy the risen Head of the ransomed Church! How cheer∣ing to our hope, and how nourishing to our faith! Well may we say with Paul, <HI>I know whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able</HI> (by virtue of his divine power, and the merit of his resurrection) <HI>to keep that which I have committed unto him,</HI> body and soul, <HI>against that day.</HI> 2 Tim. i. 12.</P>

<HEAD>HOW TO LIVE AS A CHRISTIAN, AND TO GLORIFY GOD.</HEAD>
<HEAD>An original Letter from the late Rev. William Romaine.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WITH much pleasure I answer your inquiry: may God make it useful to you and to yours!—You wish to live as a christian, and to glorify God. A christian is one who lives in Christ, and lives upon Christ. He is quickened by the spirit of life, and made one with Christ; and he lives and performs all the acts of spiritual life by the same way that he was made alive. He who lives most in this manner is the best christian, and will bring most glory to God. This being laid down as your great principle and leading truth, it should be very well established that you are a believer.</P>
<P>HAVE I FAITH?—DO I LIVE BY IT?—AL∣WAYS?—AND FOR ALL THINGS?</P>
<P>Your whole life will be only the use and appli∣cation of these few questions; but be sure you get scripture evidence of the first, left, when you have need of <HI>the sword of the Spirit,</HI> you should ques∣tion, as many do, whether it is theirs or not.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="038552_0214_10125A2293BFDCC8"/>
As to the second, a main point is to know your∣self still a son of the first Adam, although a son of the second Adam, who is <HI>the Lord from hea∣ven.</HI> If you leave out this truth, you will be puzzled at every step; because you will always find something in you acting against faith. Re∣member, then, the animal man lives an animal life, the spiritual man lives a spiritual life; and you have both these in you. The spring of all the ani∣mal man's actions is <HI>sense,</HI> the spring of all the spiritual man's actions is <HI>faith.</HI> To this <HI>faith</HI> he was quickened when <HI>the spirit of life,</HI> which is in Christ Jesus, enabled him to believe the record of God concerning his Son.</P>
<P>In every real christian there are these two na∣tures. He lives <HI>in</HI> the flesh, although he lives <HI>by</HI> the Spirit. The old Adam is continually inclining him to live an animal life; and the new man is con∣tinually inclining him to live a spiritual life, and enabling him too, if he be then living by the faith of the Son of God. So it is written, "The flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh." Gal. v. 17. The great employment of every believer is to be found using the means of God's appointment to deaden the life of sense, or the lustings of the flesh, and to strengthen the life of faith by the aids of the Holy Spirit. Hence ap∣pears
<PB N="213" REF="038552_0215_10125A242CED01D0"/>
the necessity of the word of God, both to evidence what you are in Christ, and what you are to expect from Christ, in fighting the good fight of faith: for the promises in the word are to teach you what God has freely given to you, and has warranted you to come and to take out of the ful∣ness of his Son, and to use it for your own. His deed of gift is as good a title as you can possibly have to any thing in the world; for all the promises were made to Christ; all the promises have been made good to Christ; and Christ has all power, in heaven and earth, to make them good to you. It is his office and his glory to give you whatever God has promised, and you call upon him to be∣stow even all things that belong to life and godli∣ness. Your dependence on his faithfulness engages him to bestow every needful grace. This de∣pendence is the life and soul of the true christian, and runs through all his experience. Not only prayer and praise, reading, hearing, meditating on the word, but also the common things of this life, should be carried on in this dependence, both as to our union with Christ our head, and as to our com∣munion with him as his members.</P>
<P>Here, then, comes in our last inquiry—If you live by faith, <HI>is it always? is it for all things?</HI></P>
<P>The command is, <HI>Trust in him</HI> at all times.—
<PB N="214" REF="038552_0216_10125A26AD5AF640"/>
Trust him night and day—summer and winter. Trust him when things go wrong—in sickness and in adversity. That is the time to trust him for most grace, when you want most. Trust and you shall have it; for the word cannot be broken. <HI>According to your faith, so shall it be done unto you.</HI> Little matters call for his direction, and call for his assistance, as well as great; because, <HI>with∣out him you can do nothing.</HI> By leaving Christ out, believers oftener miscarry in little things than in great. He leaves them to themselves, and then they blunder, as it is fit they should, who neglect such a guide. He offers himself to you, to be your wisdom, and he would give you his counsel in all your matters. You cannot think till you try, and by constant trial improve it, what a happiness it is thus to live upon Christ as your teacher. He would keep you from ten thousand scrapes, guide you through difficulties, bless you under troubles; yea, he would give you a spiritual use of temporal things. Resolve upon something of this, and wait the event. In your family, in your field, in buy∣ing and selling, consult Christ about all. Improve this hint: eat and drink, and lie down and rise up; do all, eyeing him, and then all will prosper.</P>

<HEAD>Memoirs of the late Rev. OLIVER HART, M. A. of Hopewell, New Jersey.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>His walk so steady, and his hope so high,</L>
<L>He neither blush'd to live, nor fear'd to die.</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN preserving memoirs of those whom God hath distinguished by his goodness, whether in private or in public life, is one mean by which, <HI>in the ages to come, God sets forth the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindness towards us, by Christ Jesus;</HI> and never fails to stimulate the followers of the Lamb in faith and love, to pursue the path with greater ardour that leadeth to everlasting life. It is with these views we attempt to draw the outlines of the life and character of the truly venerable Mr. Hart.</P>
<P>For the encouragement of our young readers, it affords us pleasure that we have it in our power to say, Mr. Hart was enriched with the grace of Christ in his youth; and, from a sense of his Sa∣viour's love, devoted himself to God, by baptism, and was received a member of the church at South∣ampton, April 3, 1741, being seventeen years and nine months old. How unspeakably happy this youth! while many others of his age pursued the paths of corruption, that unavoidably prepare them
<PB N="216" REF="038552_0218_10125A2BE9565620"/>
for deepest sorrows in old age, Mr. Hart had a long and happy race before him, to promote the interest of his fellow mortals, enjoy the sweets of virtuous life, and honour his God and Saviour. Thus planted in the house of the Lord, and root∣ed in Christ Jesus, Mr. Hart flourished in gifts and grace so eminently, that the church beheld him as one evidently designed of the Lord to bear the mi∣nistry of the gospel. Accordingly, after due ex∣ercise, on Dec. 20, 1746, they sent him forth, with testimonial letters, accompanied with fervent prayers for his prosperity in the cause of Christ. Three years after he received ordination, and accepted a call from the church at Charleston, South-Caro∣lina; the pastoral care of which he honourably and successfully maintained for thirty years. On the approach of the British fleet and army, Febru∣ary 16, 1780, determining to preserve his political liberty, he retired to the northern states. The at∣tention of the church at Hopewell, New-Jersey, was soon directed to Mr. Hart, and on December 16, in the same year, he became their Pastor, serv∣ing them with fidelity and success, until his removal by death, December 31, 1795, aged 72 years, 5 months and 26 days.</P>
<P>As a testimony of respect to this good man, an excellent sermon was delivered in Charleston, South-Carolina,
<PB N="217" REF="038552_0219_10125A2E6A0AD528"/>
by the Rev. Richard Furman, M. A. February 7, 1796; and, on April 4, an animated discourse was delivered on the same occasion at Hopewell, New-Jersey, by the Rev. William Ro∣gers, D. D. From those valuable publications, and from some manuscript materials communicated by Mrs. Hart to the Editor of the Christian's Pocket Library, we will attempt to draw some general outlines of this pious man's private and public cha∣racter, not only as a memorial of the distinguishing grace of God upon him, but to stimulate our own souls to copy after the pattern of so excellent a life, that was crowned with so glorious an end.</P>
<P N="1">1. As a christian he was, indeed, one with Christ, "To him, to live was Christ." Phil. i. 21. The PERSON of Christ was the object of his affections; the BLOOD of Christ was the fountain of his pardon; the RIGHTEOUSNESS of Christ was the ground of his justification and communion with Jehovah; and the GLORY of Christ was the determinate end of all his actions. His whole dependence, living and dying, was upon Christ; for being near his end, a person sitting by, observ∣ing his great bodily distress, said, "how happy for Mr. Hart that he has but one work to do;" (dying was meant) to which Mr. Hart immediately replied, <HI>Christ is the end of the law for righteous∣ness
<PB N="218" REF="038552_0220_10125A31CC6B13C0"/>
to every one that believeth.</HI> The TRUTH, as it is in Christ, was deeply engraven upon the breast of Mr. Hart; so deeply, that it was, indeed, to him, inestimably precious; and the TEMPER of Jesus, in a most eminent degree, shone in all his con∣versation, by which he was universally respected and beloved. He was a man of prayer; great was his communion with God, and by this he was com∣forted and supported under all the ills of life. This is evinced by the following lines, which he com∣posed in a time of distress:
<Q><LG>
<L>Foreboding thoughts, and gloomy fears,</L>
<L>Crow'd thick into my breast;</L>
<L>Perplexing doubts, and anxious cares,</L>
<L>Forbid my eyes to rest.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Happy ye saints, above the skies,</L>
<L>Beyond the reach of woe;</L>
<L>Dear Lord, command my soul to rise—</L>
<L>With joyful haste I'll go.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The world, in sackcloth and distress,</L>
<L>I'd have beneath my feet,</L>
<L>And mounting, in an heavenly dress,</L>
<L>I would my Saviour meet.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then why, my soul, sunk down so low,</L>
<L>When Jesus doth depart?</L>
<L>He will return—and thou shalt know</L>
<L>The goodness of his heart.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="219" REF="038552_0221_10125A3493F04B38"/>
2. In domestic life, the husband, father, friend and master, in their sacred principles, and their most endearing ties, were highly eminent in Mr. Oliver Hart. He was not a <HI>saint</HI> abroad and a <HI>devil</HI> at home, but stedfast and invariable in pri∣vate and in public; never so happy as when tread∣ing in the steps of his Lord and Saviour, and ren∣dering every one happy that resided beneath his roof. Mr. Hart was twice married. His first wife was Miss Sarah Brees, by whom he had eight children, <HI>two</HI> only of whom are now living. His second wife, his present relict, was Mrs. Ann Grimball, by whom he had two sons: the first died young—the other is still living, passing through his studies, under the Rev. Mr. Stoughton; and, it is devoutly wished, that the youth may form the amiable character of his father, and be a solace to the declining days of his pious mother! Perhaps the domestic life of Mr. Hart cannot be more sweet∣ly pourtrayed than as drawn by the pen of his wi∣dow, in a letter to the editor of this publication.—"My loss is great, although my dear husband's gain. I mourn not as those who have no hope: no! yet I have cause to mourn. I miss him day by day. No more I hear his harmonious voice sounding from the sacred desk <HI>the everlasting gos∣pel.</HI> No more the morning and evening sacrifice
<PB N="220" REF="038552_0222_10125A370DBC1D00"/>
of praise. No more his presence gladdens my sight. My protector, guide, head, best earthly friend—gone! Yes—the pious father of my lit∣tle son—left without a guide, example, precept, in his giddy state. Circumstances aggravate my loss—yet I would not murmur, but be humble un∣der God's mighty hand! He hath cut off the <HI>stream</HI>—HIMSELF is yet the everlasting <HI>fountain,</HI> and can consolation send through redeeming grace and dying love!" It is often said, "He is a bad father that is not missed:" but what female eye can forbear the tear over a widow who laments the loss of so kind an husband! and what man's breast but must glow with ardour to leave so noble a tes∣timony behind him as husband, father, friend!</P>
<P N="3">3. Charmed with this good man's character at home and abroad, let us glance at him in his more public station, as a minister of the gospel of salva∣tion. He that first makes not good his claim to a <HI>christian,</HI> illy pretends the christian <HI>teacher!</HI> The waters of spiritual life, in copious streams, flowed sensibly through the soul of Mr. Hart, and from this source his mouth spake the glories of the Lamb—the completeness of salvation—the expe∣rience of the saints—the beauties of Zion—the vast, the inconceivable solemnities of the eternal world! The churches at Southampton, at Charleston, and
<PB N="221" REF="038552_0223_10125A38A644A568"/>
at Hopewell, have his praises in their gates; which, probably, can be exceeded only by those individuals, in the different parts of the continent, to whom God blessed his ministry for the conversion of their souls. With what sensibility would he visit the house of woe, and tenderly wipe away the tear of grief by gospel consolation!—The private and pub∣lic duties of the pastoral office he discharged with such fidelity, heavenly-mindedness, and amiable fortitude, that every description of characters, among the flocks of his care, loved and honoured him as <HI>a man of God.</HI> With admirable justness has Dr. Rogers asserted, in his sermon—"In our associa∣tion he has scarcely left his <HI>equal:</HI> in the United States, with diffidence be it spoken, viewing him in the whole of his character, he has not left his <HI>superior.</HI>" And, while we thus speak his praise, we disdain the flatterer's art. His life, his actions, were the fruit of grace, and stand on record, to inspire our souls to tread the paths of Zion, with equal honour and with equal success. Had COW∣PER heard him preach, and beheld him standing, with his wonted solemn air, between the living and the dead, his pen would not be charged with being dipt in soul flattery, while drawing his portrait:
<Q><L>There stands the messenger of truth. There stands</L>
<L>The legate of the skies. His theme divine,</L>
<L><PB N="222" REF="038552_0224_10125A3B2A273E98"/>
His office sacred, his credentials clear.</L>
<L>By him the violated law speaks out</L>
<L>Its thunders; and by him, in strains as sweet</L>
<L>As angels use, the gospel whispers peace.</L>
<L>He 'stablishes the strong, restores the weak,</L>
<L>Reclaims the wand'rer, binds the broken heart,</L>
<L>And, arm'd himself in panoply complete</L>
<L>Of heav'nly temper, furnishes with arms,</L>
<L>Bright as his own, and trains, by ev'ry rule</L>
<L>Of holy discipline, to glorious war,</L>
<L>The sacramental host of God's elect.</L>
<L>Are all such teachers? Would to heav'n all were!</L>
<BIBL>COWPER'S Task, b. 2.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P N="4">4. Although we have nearly extended the limits usually allotted to the several pieces introduced into this publication, yet we must add, that the literary character of Mr. Hart was worthy of esteem.—Notwithstanding he had not the advantages of a collegiate education, his own industry was so great, that he made very considerable advancement in clas∣sical learning. The college at Rhode-Island was not inattentive to his worth; for, in the year 1769, they conferred on him the degree of <HI>Master in the Arts.</HI> What is most worthy of our re∣mark is, that every acquisition in science he consi∣dered so far valuable as to promote his spirituality, and his greater usefulness as a minister of Jesus. Several of his valuable discourses, and other pieces, have been published, and universally received.
<PB N="223" REF="038552_0225_10125A3E8E11BEE0"/>
Other excellent manuscripts are in the hand of his widow, which, with extracts from his diary, would prove highly advantageous, was suitable encouragement offered for their publication.</P>
<P N="5">5. From these general traits, happily evident in the character of Mr. Hart, as a christian and as a minister, maintained with such uniformity and re∣gularity, with such solemnity and deep humility, for so many years, amidst so many changes and variety of duties, we are anxious to mark the last scenes of his life. In this we are charmed, and by this we have hope.</P>
<Q><L>He sat like the sun, nor cloud possess'd.</L></Q>
<P>The nearer he drew to the verge of eternity, the brighter was his faith, and the more ardently his love glowed to the Saviour of his soul! Great and severe were the conflicts of his dissolving body; and, although, by struggles, a vessel was broken, he neither murmured nor complained. From a sense of his emaciated animal nature, he would frequently lift up his hands, and exclaim, <HI>Poor mortal man!</HI> to which a friend once replied, <HI>This mortal shall put on immortality:</HI> he answered, <HI>Yes, yes!</HI> He would often say, <HI>I want, I want!</HI> Being asked what he wanted, he replied, <HI>I want the will of the Lord to be done.</HI> He called for
<PB N="224" REF="038552_0226_10125A410D46AA98"/>
all around him <HI>to help him praise God for what he had done for his soul!</HI> When he died, he gently laid his head back, closed his eyes, as if he were going to sleep, and expired!</P>

THE DOVE.</HEAD>
<P>DOVE is the English name of a bird of the pigeon kind, belonging to the order of Columbine. From the stock-dove, it is said, the tame-pigeon, with all its variety, derives its origin. The charac∣ters of the dove are, that the tongue is whole and
<PB N="225" REF="038552_0227_10125A42A54B7C40"/>
even, without any division: the beak is of an at∣tenuated and conic figure: the nostrils are oblong, skinny, and partly covered: it has no gall: its eggs are very clear and beautiful. Linnaeus enumerates forty species of the dove. Besides the variety of the pigeon kind, this bird is denominated the ring-dove and the turtle-dove.</P>
<P>The RING-DOVE is of a larger size, and makes its nest, of a few dry sticks, in the boughs of trees. The size of this bird is eighteen inches long, thirty in breadth, and weighs about twenty ounces. The head, back, and coverts of the wings, are of a bluish ash-colour. The lower part of the neck and breast is purple, inclining to red, and dashed with ash-colour. On the hind-part of the head is a semi-circular line of white; above and below which the feathers are glossy, and of changeable colours, as opposed to the light. The belly is of a yellowish white: the greater quill feathers are dusky, and the rest are ash-coloured.</P>
<P>The TURTLE-DOVE is much shyer than any of the other kind. It may readily be distin∣guished from the rest by the iris of the eye, which is of a fine yellow, and a beautiful crimson circle which encompasses the eye-lids. The forehead is whitish: the top of the head ash-coloured, bor∣dered with olive-brown, spotted with black; the
<PB N="226" REF="038552_0228_10125A45229B5060"/>
quill feathers are of a dusky brown; the breast of a light purplish red, the verge of each feather being yellow; the belly is white, and the sides and inner coverts of the wings bluish. The tail, which is three inches and an half long, has two feathers in the middle of a dusky brown, the others being black tipt with white. The head, and the exterior sides of the feathers, are entirely white. The fidelity of the turtle-dove is proverbial. A pair put into a cage, if one dies the other will not long survive its mate. The union between the male and female is preserved with the highest degree of chastity; and if any breach happen between them, they are soon reconciled, and embrace each other. Of this beautiful bird very frequent mention is made in the holy scripture.</P>
<P N="1">1. As an emblem of the Holy Ghost, who, in the form of a dove, descended upon Christ at the memorable period of his baptism, thereby shewing the distinct personality of the Spirit from the Father and the Son. And what bird more fit to describe the swiftness of the Spirit's descent upon the soul of man?—the loveliness, integrity, purity and spi∣rituality of his heavenly influences, which, like the dove, is indeed without the gall of bitterness. In the formation of the material world, <HI>the spirit of God moved</HI> (INCUBABAT) <HI>upon the face of the
<PB N="227" REF="038552_0229_10125A48D0109838"/>
waters,</HI> "to impregnate them (says Dr. Gill), as a dove upon her eggs to hatch them"—to separate the parts which were mixed together, and to give them a quickening virtue to produce living creatues in them. This sense is charmingly expressed by Mil∣ton—
<Q><L>—And, with mighty wings out-spread,</L>
<L>Dove-like, sat'st brooding on the vast abyss,</L>
<L>And mad'st it pregnant—</L>
<BIBL>PAR. LOST, b. I.</BIBL></Q>
The targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem call the Spirit who moved upon the waters "the Spirit of mercies—the Spirit of the Messiah." Of Messiah it was foretold, "<HI>The Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and under∣standing, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge, and of the fear of the Lord.</HI> Isa. xi. 2. And, at the baptism of Jesus, this pre∣diction was accomplished, and abundantly verified, in all the acts of his future life. Those blessed heavens, that were shut by man's transgressions, were mercifully opened when Jesus, the Saviour of man, <HI>fulfilled all righteousness;</HI> the Spirit, in the form of a dove, descending and resting upon him, to demonstrate his approbation, to qualify him for his prophetic office, in order to preach the ac∣ceptable year of the Lord; while the Father crowns
<PB N="228" REF="038552_0230_10125A4B4E101900"/>
the solemnity with an audible voice: <HI>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</HI> Matt. iii. 13, 17. Thus the whole Trinity was distinctly revealed on this memorable occasion, and demands our profoundest reverence. As the Spirit before named had his part in producing the material world, so also in the spiritual world of grace—first on Christ, then upon his members, who are compared to doves.</P>
<P N="2">2. The church, the beloved members of Christ's spiritual body, are addressed by him as doves. <HI>My dove, my undefiled, is but one.</HI> S. Song. vi. 9. <HI>One</HI> in his eye, his heart, his hand; and but <HI>one</HI> in the possession of the same grace, truth and love, by each individual member, in whatsoever nation, age, clime or denomination, they may be found on earth. These persons, in their native, corrupted state, by original and actual sin, are in abject slavery to the powers of death, and to the evil bias of their own natures; for a deliverance from which is the incessant cry of every one who feels the condition into which they are fallen: <HI>O deli∣ver not the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the mul∣titude of the wicked.</HI> Psa. lxxiv. 18. To which the blessed Saviour grants a most gracious reply, and promise of deliverance: <HI>Though thou hast lain among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings
<PB N="229" REF="038552_0231_10125A4CE6A1E098"/>
of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers of yellow gold.</HI> Psa. lxviii. 13. As if he had said, "Though now covered with dust and ashes, and reduced to a state of mental wretchedness, more servile and base than Egyptian slaves among the sooty pots and cauldrons of their masters; yet thou shalt arise, and, by the merit of my righteousness, and the renewals of my grace, enjoy the glorious liberty of the sons of God. The fruit of my spirit shall so richly adorn thy soul, and the light of my countenance shall so sensibly thine upon thee, that thou shalt appear glorious, as the beautiful plumage of an eastern dove, glistening interchangeably as with silver and gold, while sporting its wings be∣neath the beams of the sun!" <HI>O my dove! that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.</HI> S. Song ii. 14.</P>
<P>From the perusal of the scripture, and from the analogy of experience of christians, we may further perceive the justness of their comparison to doves. In their repentance <HI>they are like doves of the val∣leys, all of them mourning, every one for his ini∣quity.</HI> Ezek. vii. 16. In their conversion they ea∣gerly fly to Christ, and to his house, <HI>as doves to their window,</HI> for safety and for happiness. Isa.
<PB N="230" REF="038552_0232_10125A4F634D0490"/>
lx. 8. The knowledge of their God, and of his truth, is like <HI>the eyes of a dove,</HI> chaste and pure. S. Song i. 15. Often pursued and afflicted by ene∣mies, they cry, with David, <HI>O that I had wings like a dove: for then would I fly away, and be at rest.</HI> Psa. lv. 6. In the temper of their minds, like the innocent dove, they possess not the <HI>gall</HI> of malicious revenge, but follow the precept of their Lord, <HI>Be ye wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.</HI> Matt. x. 16. To which may be added, in their social union with the saints in the church, they are faithful and affectionate, and, like the dove, on the loss of its mate, is afflicted and mourns, <HI>though not without hope.</HI> 1 Thes. iv. 13. Their food, like the food of the dove, is clean and pure—the finest of the wheat, the truth of Christ and of his word, avoiding the carrion of error or vile sensu∣ality. Psa. cxix. 140. Of all the winged creation, what bird more amiably and excellently sets forth its Maker's praise than the dove? And, of the redeemed of the Lord it is said, <HI>this</HI> people have I formed for myself—they shall shew forth my praise! Isa. xliii. 21.</P>
<P>To make any remarks on the dove sent by Noah out of the ark, or on the dove appointed by the Jewish law for sacrifice, however fruitful of in∣struction, must now be omitted, as it would una∣voidably exceed the limits of this paper.</P>

<HEAD>GLEANINGS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. GOOD works, like the golden ear-rings of the Israelites, are valuable in themselves; but if once exalted into a golden calf, to be worshipped, they become offensive to God, and pernicious to the soul.</P>
<P N="2">2. Paulinus, when they told him that the Goths had sacked Nola, and plundered him of all he had, lifted up his eyes to Heaven, said, "<HI>Lord, thou knowest where I have laid up my treasure.</HI>"—Happy the suffering christian, who, under loss of worldly enjoyments, finds durable riches and sub∣stance in God!</P>
<P N="3">3. The truths of the Gospel are to be introduced in public discourses and in private conversation, with discretion and propriety. A person once ha∣rangued on the strength of Sampson: "I affirm," said he, "that this same Sampson was the strongest man that ever did or ever will live in this world." "I deny it," replied one of the company; "your∣self are stronger than he." "How do you make out that?" "Because you just now lugged him in by head and shoulders."</P>
<P N="4">4. Young christians are frequently great <HI>bigots.</HI> When we are first converted to God, our brotherly
<PB N="232" REF="038552_0234_10125A559F6717D0"/>
affection, candour, and religious opinion of others, too often resemble the narrowness of a river at its first rise; but as we grow in the knowledge of our∣selves, and advance sensibly nearer to God, the great ocean of all good, the channel widens, and our hearts expand, until death perfectly unites us to the source of uncreated love.</P>
<P N="5">5. If a person who has been long in possession of a large estate, comes, in process of time, to have his <HI>title</HI> disputed, he rummages every corner of his scrutore, and of his strong boxes, to find the ori∣ginal deeds; which, having found, he appeals to them with confidence, as authentic vouchers.—Thus, past experiences of the grace of God, though not our Saviour, may yet be recollected, and improved as the hand-writing of God, by which we know our interest in his love, and answer the cavils and law-suits of the devil.</P>

<P>THE study of human nature is pleasing and im∣portant. As there are comparatively few lessons on this subject to be derived from nature, the God
<PB N="242" REF="038552_0244_10125A6F14CA4BD0"/>
of Grace hath given us the revelation of truth by his dear Son; in which, by the aid of his Spirit, every thing may be known necessary to constitute our present and future happiness. Hence, nature and revelation are harmonious; though the latter not only supplies the deficiency of the former, but adds such discoveries as are suited to our fallen na∣ture, and directs us to such sources of peace and blessedness which otherwise never could have been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ained. In the volume of revelation we are taught the knowledge of ourselves, by the most familiar and expressive figures: that of a FLOWER shall now engage our meditations.</P>
<P>God's ancient servant, Job, contemplated his own life under this emblem. <HI>Man cometh forth as a flower, and is cut down.</HI> Job xii. 2. He was a wise and a good man. His knowledge of the sciences and of human nature was great. The brevity of man was justly to be compared to a flower; and of this he was the more convinced from his personal experience in life. As a flower he came forth, and stood an ornament of virtue, grace, and godliness, <HI>fearing God above many,</HI> while his family and his country enjoyed him with infinite pleasure. Health and strength, children and friends, house and lands, invaluable riches, were his portion. But, while in his fairest, fullest
<PB N="243" REF="038552_0245_10122A0BBAC9D9B8"/>
bloom, he was cut down by the hand of affliction, and his beauty and worth apparently lost: his health is decayed—his children are no more—his vast possessions are carried off by the Sabeans—his body is covered with biles, and his bed is a filthy dung∣hill of the earth; and that hand which was indus∣triously employed in communicating good to others, now grasps the potsherd to cleanse the sores of the body. Who but must drop a tear on reviewing the afflictive change of so excellent a man! Well might he indeed say, <HI>Man is of few days, and full of trouble.</HI> In the morning, as a flower full in its bloom; in the evening, cut down and wither∣ed! But this is not only true, as it relates to the afflictive dispensation of God to his people, but to the state of man, by life and by death. He cometh forth as a flower, and appears in all the stages of manhood, and is then cut down by death, and con∣signed to the dust. This is a truth that bears its own evidence, and should make solemn impression upon our hearts! We will attempt to enlarge our reflections upon man as a flower, in expecta∣tion of usefulness to the different classes of our readers.</P>
<P N="1">1. We may begin with its origin. Every flower dictates to us a seed or first principle, which owes its existence to the Creator of all things, who hath
<PB N="244" REF="038552_0246_10125A71E43F1D20"/>
<HI>given to every seed its own body.</HI> 1 Cor. xv.—38. God is the parent of man; <HI>we are his offspring;</HI> and it is <HI>in him that we live, move, and have our being.</HI> The formation of the first man, Adam, is recorded, for our instruction, in the two first chap∣ters of Genesis; the antiquity of which record should create a superlative esteem in our breasts for the bible, as the oldest and the best book in the world. Our parents—time, place, and manner of our birth, were appointed by infinite wisdom; and however we may esteem our parents as the natural cause of our animal production, we must direct our eyes to God as the FATHER of all; by whose will and power our bodies and souls are formed, and whose hand sows the seed that produces the flowers of human nature.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let us mark the variety of the flowery tribe, expressive of the different orders of mankind. In those parts of the world where the flowery tribes have been cultivated with every possible art and in∣dustry, the florist has acknowledged that he could no more estimate their variety than to number the sands on the sea shore. A Linnaeus, a Turnfoot, and a Miller, the most eminent in exploring the nature, virtue and beauty of this charming part of creation, have only been able to glance upon the subject, in comparison to its extent. This will
<PB N="245" REF="038552_0247_10125A74636FE258"/>
aid our reflections on the variety of proportions, symmetry and features of mankind. In the natural features of men, there may appear two, perhaps, from family connections, so much alike as though cast into one mould; but, on a minute examina∣tion, will be found to differ in a very astonishing degree. While this diversity of human features evinces the wisdom of God, it is evidently of the highest advantages to public society. The variety of man's natural and acquired abilities is equally astonishing! In the lower department of manu∣facture, husbandry, &amp;c. in which the honest la∣bourer obtains his bread at the sweat of his brow, the higher departments of language and of arts each bear some resemblance to the diversity of flowers. And, as from the variety of flowers many medicinal virtues may be derived for the be∣nefit of mankind, so, by the different abilities of men, in the cultivation of science, benefit is de∣rived by the whole. The tempers and passions of mankind are likewise expressed by the variety of flowers. I presume, though there may be some analogy in the general dispositions of men, yet as their features, so in their minds, there are not two alike, let their name or family be what they may. What an infinite variety is there in the colour, marks, size, and construction of flowers! Some
<PB N="246" REF="038552_0248_10125A7601924090"/>
appear magnificently grand, and fill us with ad∣miration; while others, less adorned, give us leave to pass without attention. Just so it is with men. Those whose temper and passions are eminent in goodness and grace, bearing the image of JESUS CHRIST, engage our attention; while others, of a different cast, make no pleasing impression upon us, and we pass by them with indifference. From these observations it must appear obvious to my young readers, that a general acquaintance with mankind is absolutely necessary to their improve∣ment and usefulness in the world. We meet with some persons exceedingly contracted in their gene∣ral sentiments, and who will scarce allow a man to be either honest or gracious, because such may differ from them: but it is obvious that these very persons have only viewed a few flowers in their own scanty gardens, and are perfect strangers to that rich variety which adorns the universe. Con∣fining themselves to a circle of their own taste, they can have little pleasure from the exercise of christian candour towards others.</P>
<P N="3">3. The properties of flowers attracting our <HI>senses</HI> is another observation worthy our attention. Some possess the most charming fragrance; others as truly offensive; while some may be denominated <HI>neutral,</HI> having little scent at all. It is so among mankind.
<PB N="247" REF="038552_0249_10125A78DBDDC230"/>
Those who are enriched with the grace of God, and, from love to Christ, bear the fruits of virtue and true holiness, laying out themselves for the be∣fit of others—these are <HI>the excellent of the earth,</HI> and yield more pleasure to a pious mind, than the most valuable collections of carnations can gratify the scent. The vicious, the vain, the wretched and profligate, fail not to render themselves noxious in our esteem. Others there are who are not vi∣cious enough to claim the denomination of <HI>wicked,</HI> nor have goodness enough to esteem them <HI>righte∣ous;</HI> therefore, as they are undetermined in their own characters, you find that they pass through life little thought of, and of as little use. These observations may apply in our general review of human nature, or in circumscribed bodies. King∣doms, cities, churches, families, are as so many beds of flowers, to be visited and enjoyed accord∣ing to their nature; while the exhibition of the whole will not fail to enlarge your own breast, and lead you to admire the goodness, power and glory of that ALMIGHTY BEING <HI>for whom all things were created.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The general division of flowers of the <HI>field,</HI> and flowers of the <HI>garden,</HI> deserves a few atten∣tive thoughts. No doubt, the whole of this flowery tribe was naturally wild; and the choice, culture,
<PB N="248" REF="038552_0250_10125A7C39CCB120"/>
and benefit of any, by which the difference is made, is attributed to the pleasure and the skill of the flo∣rist and the botanist. As the scripture must guide us in these contemplations, we observe the differ∣ence made in mankind by the grace and pleasure of God in Christ. By nature we are all wild in∣deed! <HI>By nature children of wrath.</HI> Eph. ii. 1. Christ, by his grace, regenerating a sinner's heart, digs him out from among the common field of the world, and transplants him into the garden of his church, where he is watered, dressed, trained, bud, blossom, bear fruit, even to old age. <HI>Bles∣sed is the man whom thou, O Lord, chooseth, and causeth to approach unto thee! He shall be as a plant, planted by the rivers of waters, whose leaf faileth not!</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. The shortness of our paper reminds us to make our last observation. This must be on the period of the flower. <HI>Job tells us, Man cometh up as a flower, and is cut down.</HI> Behold! he speaks of the appearance of the flower, and of its being cut down—not one word of its continuance. This is purposely to teach us the brevity of life, and that our age is, comparatively, as nothing—<HI>a vapour that vanisheth away!</HI> no sooner come up, than cut down! <HI>Lord, what is man!</HI> how few his days on earth! cut down by the scythe of
<PB N="249" REF="038552_0251_10125A7EB5945AB8"/>
death, at the command of that righteous Being who made us, and to whom we are accountable! At this spot our leaves must fall, our beauty fade! But is man cut down to be no more? Doth body and soul both lie down in the grave, and rot to∣gether? How important the question of Job:—<HI>Man giveth up the Ghost, and where is he?</HI> Job xiv. 10. May I be permitted, in reverence, to reply—Either in HEAVEN or HELL! Cut down as fuel for the fire—or to be transmitted to bloom in paradise with God! Let us, therefore, improve these reflections for our personal benefit; let us examine into the state of our souls, and fly to the arms of that most blessed Saviour, who, to teach his worth, and to yield his grace, is known as <HI>the Rose of Sharon, and the Lily of the Val∣lies.</HI> Interested in him, and fraught with his grace, you need not fear to die. Though cut down by the hand of death, you shall be delivered from this evil, tempestuous life, and be transmitted to bliss that <HI>fadeth not away!</HI></P>

and the weather is fine, but sinks when the air is heavy, and loaded with damps; so the christian's sen∣sible comforts rise when God shines upon his soul, but subsides when left to the workings of his own heart.</P>
<P N="2">2. Dr. Grovesnor being at the funeral of Dr. Watts, a gentleman present said to him, "Well, Dr. Grovesnor, you have seen the end of Dr. Watts, and you will soon follow: what think you of death?" "Think of it," replied the Doc∣tor, "when death comes I shall smile upon death, if Christ smiles upon me."</P>
<P N="3">3. When the rays of the sun fall on the surface of a material object, part of those rays are absorb∣ed, part of them are reflected back in straight lines, and part of them are refracted in various directions. Thus, when Christ, the SUN OF RIGHTEOUS∣NESS, shines upon a christian's heart, part of the grace he confers is <HI>absorbed</HI> for the consolation of the soul; part of it is <HI>reflected</HI> back to the Saviour, in acts of faith, love, joy, prayer and praise; and part of it is <HI>refracted</HI> every way, in acts of for∣bearance, gratitude, benevolence, and every social virtue, for the benefit of mankind.</P>
<P N="4">4. The mariner, when on a boisterous sea, finds his compass to direct itself to its own pole, and guide him in a certain tract, although his compass

box be tossed in every direction. That heart which hath received a touch from Christ, the heavenly magnet, will, in desires, affections, hopes, obedi∣ence, ever direct itself to Jesus, as his all in all, although the box of his mind be tossed every way, by Satan, unbelief, or affliction.</P>
<P>N. B. A sure and satisfactory evidence of our state.</P>
<P N="5">5. Louis XIV. of France, said one day to the famous father <HI>Masillon,</HI> "I have heard many great orators in my chapel, and I have always been well <HI>satisfied with them;</HI> but every time I hear you I am DISSATISFIED WITH MYSELF."—Those ministers of Jesus Christ who are most faithful, are, indeed, the most useful, though often the least popular. And those discourses which tend to open to us the true state of our souls, strip us of self-deception, and lead us, as the chief of sin∣ners, to the Almighty Saviour, should be esteemed by us the most valuable.</P>
<P N="6">6. "How does your ladyship (said the famous lord Bolingbroke to lady Huntingdon) reconcile prayer to God for particular blessings with absolute resignation to the divine will?" "Very easily (answered she); just as if I was to offer a petition to a monarch, of whose kindness and wisdom I have the highest opinion. In such a case my lan∣guage

<HEAD>DIALOGUE between a Collegian and the Presi∣dent of his College, on the Authenticity of Chris∣tianity.</HEAD>

<SPEAKER>COLLEGIAN.</SPEAKER>
<P>AS our class have completed their morning re∣citation, the indulgence I have hitherto received from you, Mr. President, induces me to request the favour of a few minutes private advice.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>PRESIDENT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly. What, Sir, is the sub∣ject of your inquiry?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COL.</SPEAKER>
<P>From my early youth I have been taught to imbibe prejudices against christianity. Those prejudices have been confirmed by the writings of Voltaire, which I was obliged to translate when learning the French language. I am persuaded that no man of sound learning and good sense would condemn any system unexplored; and al∣though I still possess very great doubts respecting
<PB N="253" REF="038552_0255_10125A88F7D0E8F0"/>
revelation, I wish to examine it more thoroughly before I finally reject it. I have never applied to a clergyman for assistance in my inquiries; for as I could not believe their doctrine, I by no means venerated their character. If the President would indulge me with his aid, though not a positive col∣legiate duty, you will lay me under, an additional obligation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PRE.</SPEAKER>
<P>The importance of the subject, and my good wishes for your happiness, dictate my com∣pliance, so far as my knowledge may extend. And in this I feel myself the more cheerful, from the re∣collection of many embarrassments of a similar na∣ture which I myself laboured under in the early part of my life. However, from the nature of your inquiry you must give me leave to require of you an answer to a previous necessary question.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COL.</SPEAKER>
<P>As you are so obliging, Sir, as to conde∣scend to enter upon the subject on my behalf, I promise, conscientiously, to answer any questions you may propose, although, perhaps, it may ex∣pose my own folly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PRE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you believe that there is a God? that <HI>good</HI> and <HI>evil</HI> are existing realities in our present state of humanity? that, by the just law of your Maker, you are amenable to his tribunal for all the acts of your heart and life? and that, after death, a period
<PB N="254" REF="038552_0256_10125A8A93862758"/>
of retribution will take place, to justify the moral government of God on the earth, which will issue in the happiness or misery of the individuals of mankind? These, generally, may be denominated the articles of the religion of nature, which are capable of being understood, although there were no bible in the world. Unless, therefore, you believe the religion of nature, you can have no pretension to inquire after the religion of revelation; neither will any of its external evidence which I might name fall with conviction upon your breast.</P>

<P>I have ever possessed an idea of a SU∣PREME BEING. On the other articles you nam∣ed, I have had repeated painful doubts, principally created in my mind by the reading of deistical vo∣lumes; but I can assure you, Sir, no doubt of their reality remains with me: if otherwise, I should have been content in my faith, and not waited on the President with my case.</P>

<P>I begin by expressing my suspicion of the characters of the writers of the testaments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PRE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your first blow is well directed; for if they can be impeached, the whole, of course, must fall. If men fabricated the scriptures, we may justly ask, What men were they? Either bad or good. The first could not have contrived it, and the latter never would have done it. The doc∣trines, the precepts, would be the reverse of their own nature. Would such men write a book to tell all the world that all such men as themselves would be punished in hell? Good men would never make a book out of their own heads, and then tell you that their lies were the counsels of God. If men did counterfeit God's hand, how has it happened that none has discovered the cheat? What! were they all deceivers? Tell me for why? What could be the motive that induced them to such an imposition, where they saw reproach, im∣prisonment, torture, and death, their own rewards? Would no one out of the many repent, and dis∣close the scheme, even when he found the world against him, and death before him? Could base lyars, wicked men, write a book so pure in its na∣ture, and holy in its design, and endure all manner of hardships in defence of it? Even the character and conduct of <HI>Judas Iscariot</HI> furnishes a strong
<PB N="256" REF="038552_0258_10125A90B01A06A0"/>
argument for the truth of the gospel. How came it to pass that he first betrayed his master, and was then so stung with remorse as to put an end to his own life? How came he thus to own himself guilty of the vilest sin, when, if Jesus had been an impostor, he knew that he had done an act of justice to the world in freeing them from him? Now, if there had been any base plot, any bad design in the case, Judas, who had so long lived with Christ and his disciples, with perfect intimacy, and who was intrusted with the bag, would cer∣tainly have exposed it. I wish to ask you if you have thoroughly examined the characters of the different writers of the Old and New Testaments? Perhaps not. You would have found that they feared God; they lived a life of prayer to God; they separated themselves from the practices of the wicked; they preached, they wrote, they wept, to reclaim their fellow mortals; and they cheerfully submitted to every loss of name, health, friends, and property, to accomplish such benevolent pur∣poses, all of which they unanimously aimed at the glory of God! Is there any thing here impeach∣able? Or ought we not to admire their character, and follow their steps? Are the social virtues of the opposers of christianity more useful and brilliant?
<PB N="257" REF="038552_0259_10125A924DD7FDB8"/>
—Come, I perceive you blush—let me hear ano∣ther objection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COL.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are many difficulties and contradic∣tions in the bible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PRE.</SPEAKER>
<P>That there are many <HI>difficulties</HI> in the scriptures I own, but that there are <HI>contradictions</HI> I deny. But to whom do such appear? Do we expect a child to read a newspaper that never learn∣ed his alphabet? Do we admit a youth to a col∣legiate education that never read a grammar? Mention a few philosophical experiments on air, or of the nature and effects of electricity, to a person who never read on these subjects, nor saw an experiment, nor, perhaps, ever beheld the appara∣tus; would you not smile while he expressed his opinion of the supposed difficulties, the contradic∣tions, and, perhaps, the fallacy of the whole? And would not this evidently arise from a gross igno∣rance in <HI>first principles?</HI> Let me, then, ask you, Sir, if it be good sense, or good manners, in a per∣son, to talk of <HI>difficulties</HI> and <HI>contradictions</HI> in religion, while he himself be irreligious? Take a seat on the lowest form in Christ's school, and then bring forward your difficulties: you will, then, soon find them to vanish.—I wish to inform you, my dear young friend, that the bible contains a RELIGION FOR SINNERS, pardon for the guilty,
<PB N="258" REF="038552_0260_10125A94CE6EABF0"/>
health for the sick, sight for the blind, comfort for the distressed; and, until you feel just as the gospel describes, you will never wish to enjoy the blessings which the gospel contains. I will just add, that the scriptures, however written by different men, of different languages, and distant periods, every part of them harmonize in pointing out the most august character of Jehovah, the miserable state of man by sin, the completeness of redemption by Jesus Christ, the power of the Spirit in applying the vir∣tues of salvation to the heart, the privileges of the godly in this life, and their glory in the next. Each of these are minutely expressed, are easily understood by an illuminated mind, and afford ground and reasons for moral and social actions, infinitely plainer and more certain than the variety of axioms in natural and experimental philosophy. I conclude my answer to your question nearly in the words of the celebrated <HI>Dryden:</HI> "Whence but from heaven could men who were generally unskilled in arts, who were born in different pe∣riods of time, and in different parts of the world, weave such agreeing truths? How is it possible, and what end could they have in view, that they should all conspire to cheat us with a lye, their pains unasked, their advice ungrateful, starving their gain, and martyrdom their reward?" Come,
<PB N="259" REF="038552_0261_10125A96C179B368"/>
Sir, be free—if you have any other objection let me hear it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>COL.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, good Sir, I feel already so guilty and ashamed, for disbelieving what I did not know, that I know not how to proceed: however, having your leave, I will trespass upon your patience once more. The impropriety of conduct, in some chris∣tians, has been an objection to my embracing the system.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>PRE.</SPEAKER>
<P>True: we have to lament that some pro∣fessors of christianity have and do act improperly; but should the whole be condemned for the sake of a few? or should this be laid as an evil to the charge of christianity? Certainly not. If there was no intrinsic value in christianity, there would be no counterfeit: if there were no real christians, there would be no hypocrites. All those torrents of blood, shed by what are called christian princes, were not the dictates, nor the fruit of christianity; but the lust of ambition, revenge, and love of con∣quest. Probably this objection may also arise from your personal observations on professors of the gospel. In this case I will say, I also have been deeply affected when witnessing improper con∣duct of such persons. But, on due reflection on the extreme depravity of the heart, and the many enticements to evil, I have been more astonished
<PB N="260" REF="038552_0262_10125A9B100355B0"/>
that <HI>any</HI> live an honour to God, useful to society, and happy in themselves, than that a greater num∣ber should not. It is not uncommon for those who are unfavourable to the gospel to use <HI>both</HI> eyes to mark the improprieties of its followers, and scarce ever glance upon their own conduct. Very different from this is the temper dictated by the bible: for, instead of being like the vulture, prey∣ing upon the carrion of others' conduct, they are clothed with humility, under a due sense of their own infirmities. I readily own to you, my young friend, if I have hitherto maintained a life in any measure consistent with the office I hold in col∣lege, or beneficial to society at large, I wholly at∣tribute it to the kind influence of my God and Sa∣viour upon my heart. Your proposed objection gives me an opportunity to name two other argu∣ments favourable to christianity, and, I think, must prove alleviating to you. The very bible has pre∣dicted those false professors of whom you com∣plain, and marked out both their conduct and their end. Read, as a proof, the parable of the ten virgins. Matt. xxv. 1—13. Another argument is, God has not hidden any of the evils and impro∣prieties of his most distinguished servants; but has lain the blackest mark upon them, and shown their just aggravations for their repentance; and they
<PB N="261" REF="038552_0263_10125A9D8AB0ADD8"/>
still exist on record, that <HI>he who thinketh he standeth may take heed lest he fall.</HI> 1 Cor. x. 12. Remember, christianity makes no man personally sinless, but corrects and subdues our evil nature. It must be confessed, that the opposers of christianity are not more brilliant in their moral virtues than others; neither, while they reflect upon our bible, do they possess wisdom and benevolence sufficient to give us a better rule of life, and a ground of hope. A celebrated deist once had candour enough to acknowledge to me, in Boston, "Sir, after all our disputes with you on the subject of christianity, I must own that you have <HI>two</HI> chances to our <HI>one.</HI> If we are right, and our standing safe on the ground of nature, you must be also. Should christianity be true, you are safe and we are lost." On this concession, how true is the sentiment of Moses: <HI>Their rock is not as our rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.</HI> Deut. xxxii. 31. [College bell rings.] The bell now rings for my attendance on the senior class; I shall only add, I wish you well: think coolly, read the bible for yourself, try to read your own heart also; above all, if hitherto you may have lived without prayer, go to God, and humble yourself before him for your sins and ignorance, beseeching him to shine upon you in mercy: and, on any proper occa∣sion,
<PB N="262" REF="038552_0264_10125A9F23B6B728"/>
I shall always be ready to give you my best advice. God bless you!</P>

<P>BY sin came death: God's <HI>sentence prevaileth forever against</HI> man, <HI>and he passeth away</HI>—from life to death, from time to eternity, from a state of action to a state of judgment! Yes, thou, Lord, changest his countenance, and sendest him away. How just the procedure; how sublime the senti∣ment! fruitful of instruction to every attentive mind. It has been strikingly verified in the per∣son of Jesus, and is daily so, in the departure both of the wicked and the righteous by death.</P>
<P N="1">1. In the person of Jesus, whose countenance was <HI>fairer than the children of men, grace</HI> with∣out measure <HI>was poured into his lips.</HI> Psa. xlv. 2. His countenance was the index, the mirror, through which all the variety of human passions and qualities were seen, that once rendered him familiar with
<PB N="263" REF="038552_0265_10125AA1C8429BD8"/>
mortals, and proved him to be, indeed, the SON OF GOD. But the FATHER had sent him into the world to be the Saviour of sinners, to atone for sin, and to ransom his people from the power of the grave. His countenance, therefore, must be changed, and exhibit to men, to angels and to devils, the torture which his soul should endure in accomplishing his design. As he advanced into natural, active life, he became <HI>a man of sorrow, and acquainted with griefs;</HI> and, during the last few weeks of his abode on earth, his countenance was changed in such a variety of ways as must fill the contemplative soul with solemn awe.</P>
<P>Preparatory to his future dreadful sufferings, and his consequent exaltation, Jesus was transfi∣gured upon Mount Tabor: in the very exercise of prayer <HI>his face did shine as the sun.</HI> Matt. xvii. 2. Immediately after, he met his disciples at the pass∣over, and instituted the memorials of his own fu∣ture death, while his countenance beamed friend∣ship and love to them all. From thence he repaired to Gathsemane, when a change took place in his countenance that spake the awful sorrow of his soul, and the bloody sweat of his body in prospect of that cup which his Father designed him to drink! At the bar of the high priest his counte∣nance was again changed, by the spitting and the
<PB N="264" REF="038552_0266_10125AA52C93A6D0"/>
smiting of the Jewish rabble; so that his <HI>face was marred more than any man's.</HI> Follow him to Cal∣vary; behold him crucified between two thieves, and stand astonished to see that countenance that never looked upon sinful man but with tenderness and compassion, now covered with tears and with blood! Removed from the cross, attend his corpse in Joseph's garden, prepared for its tomb; and behold his countenance now changed by death! Ah, my soul! canst thou behold these changes of thy Saviour's countenance without a tear? Shall not repentance flow from thy guilty breast, while Jesus weeps, and bleeds, and dies! Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world!</P>

<P>The countenance of Jesus changed, God <HI>sent him away</HI>—into the grave, to satisfy justice, to fulfil prophecy, to vanquish death in his own kingdom, to proclaim he was the Son of God, by rising from the tomb, as a proof of the com∣pleteness of his redemption, and a certain pledge of his people's resurrection to everlasting life,
<PB N="265" REF="038552_0267_10125AA6C958E608"/>
He was then <HI>sent away</HI> to abide with his disciples, and, by the light, the form and the love of his countenance, to convince them of the reality of his person and salvation—to remove their doubts and to comfort their hearts—and to give them his final orders concerning the kingdom of his grace. Then he was <HI>sent away</HI> from earth to heaven, accompa∣nied by multitudes of angels, and was set down at the right hand of the Majesty on high, as the re∣presentative of his people; to conquer, by his grace, the purchase of his blood, and to prepare mansions of glory for them, where they shall en∣joy the light of his countenance for ever! O! let it be my constant employ, most blessed and highly exalted LAMB OF GOD, to behold thy face amidst thy various changes! and let it be my daily mercy, while here on earth, to enjoy thy life-giving coun∣tenance, shining upon my heart, to comfort me under my sorrows, direct me in my duties, and to create in my breast a taste of that heaven of feli∣city I hope to enjoy with thee above for ever!</P>
<P N="2">2. How frequently are the words of Job verified in the truly unhappy death of many wicked and impenitent mortals; <HI>thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away!</HI> The opinion of David is seriously just—<HI>The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God
<PB N="266" REF="038552_0268_10125AA94BB22400"/>
is not in all his thoughts.</HI> Psa. x. 4. In youth the countenance indicates the mirth and the folly of the heart; in manhood, the intense desire of gain; in affluence, the gratification of appetite; in affliction, the insuperable burthen of life; in old age, the un∣satisfying enjoyments of all sublunary good, from the cradle to the grave. In each of these stages how often is it that God, instantaneously, or, at most, progressively, <HI>changeth their countenance, and sendeth them away?</HI> Like the king of anci∣ent Babylon, <HI>the form of the visage is changed,</HI> when the hand-writing of God is read in his law, and eternity unfolds its dreadful scenes!

<P N="3">3. Materially different is the case, yet equally just the sentiment of Job with respect to the righte∣ous, <HI>thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.</HI> Their countenance undergoes a most remarkable change, when, under a dejection of mind, and conviction of heart, God reveals the riches of his mercy in pardoning their sins, and granting them the joy of his salvation—<HI>God be∣comes the hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of their countenance, and their God.</HI> Psa. xlii. 11.

In death their <HI>countenance</HI> under∣goes a natural change in common with other men; but, while changing, it becomes a mirror, through which the nature, supports, comforts, and triumphs of grace appear in their brightest lustre, to the glory of the Saviour and the consolation of every beholder! Yes, of the death of a righteous man it may be said—
<Q><L>His mind was tranquil and serene,</L>
<L>No terrors in his looks were seen;</L>
<L>A Saviour's smile dispell'd the gloom,</L>

The ransomed of the Lord have hope in their

<HEAD>ADDRESS TO A FRIEND ON HIS BIRTH∣DAY.</HEAD>
<P>THE old custom of making particular compli∣ments on a birth-day, connected with my warmest wishes for your felicity, induce me to employ my
<PB N="269" REF="038552_0271_10125AB10922DE00"/>
pen to congratulate you on <HI>the day</HI>—a day which, if rightly improved, will inspire your gratitude to God, who hath thus far conducted you through life; and also establish your confidence for future supplies from the bounties of his hand.</P>
<P>When I myself review the path of life, serious∣ly contemplate God's conduct towards me, in the multiplied affections and mercies which, in close succession, have followed me, I am filled with humble praise. Under such serious impressions I have felt myself happy, have renewed my strength, and looked with pleasure on the remnant of my days. I have sometimes thought that David was as partial to the celebration of birth-days as myself, and on such an occasion breathed that pious as∣piration—<HI>So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.</HI> Psa. xc. 12. What a necessity is there for attaining the knowledge of this heavenly arithmetic, in order to ascertain the safety of our state, and the paths of future duty! He who despises or neglects this necessary art, is like the heedless mariner who never keeps a reckoning—makes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the night, and, for want of a well laid cable in order to drop his anchor, imperceptibly falls upon the rocks, and becomes a perfect wreck. To number our days of vanity, temptation, trials and prosperity,
<PB N="270" REF="038552_0272_10125AB3831542C8"/>
cannot fail to impress our minds with the high im∣portance of seeking the friendship of Jesus, as the one thing needful. From a conviction of our mis∣improvements, of which, alas! we have so many, we cannot but wish to learn wisdom. To fly from the appearance of evil, thirst after the invaluable blessings of a Saviour, and constantly to devote ourselves to the honour of his name, this, this alone is substantial wisdom!</P>
<P>Perhaps there are some particulars in every man's life, which, on such a day as this, would lead him more sensibly to admire the divine forbearance, mercy and goodness. Such, I presume, you have often recorded—Dangers on the seas and mercies on the land—yes, and with David you acknow∣ledge, <HI>My soul hath them still in remembrance.</HI> O that on this occasion, reviewing the protecting care of the Almighty, your soul may be clothed with humility and your lips be filled with his praise!</P>
<P>And now, dear Sir, look before you—short, at best, is the period of human life. <HI>Man cometh up like a flower, and is cut down.</HI> Every year leaves your number less. Birth-days should be to us, on the journey of life, as mile-stones on the road; each informs us how far we have advanced, and brings the period of our race to view. It seems, the nearer we advance to our end, the swifter our
<PB N="271" REF="038552_0273_10125AB603984DA8"/>
days and months pass away. But who, alas! knows his own distance? Carefully may a man preserve the number of years that pass, and tell another how old he is; but who is able to deter∣mine the number yet to come? This is wisely hid from mortal sight, that we may hold ourselves ready to stop in our career whenever God may call. Let us, my friend, on our birth days, set down as on the way-side, look at the number on the mile∣stone, ask—have we an heavenly home to go to? have we assurance of interest in our Father's love? are we ready, supposing the next mile-stone brings us to our end? If so, what serenity of mind and happiness of soul would attend our path! How successfully should we improve the ills and the com∣forts which surround us! We trust the faithful care of that God who hath crowned our lives with tender mercies, and look for every needful future supply. Perhaps such submission is better expres∣sed in the following lines: may they prove, this day, the true language of your heart!</P>
<LG>
<L>Great God! I would not ask to see</L>
<L>What in futurity shall be;</L>
<L>If light and bliss attend my days,</L>
<L>Then let my future hours be praise.</L>
<L>Is darkness and distress my share?</L>
<L>Then let me trust thy guardian care.</L>
<L><PB N="272" REF="038552_0274_10125AB88D87C690"/>
Enough for me, if love divine,</L>
<L>At length, through every cloud shall shine.</L>
<L>Yet this my soul desires to know;</L>
<L>Be this my only wish below,</L>
<L>That Christ is mine—this great request</L>
<L>Grant, bounteous God, and I am blest.</L>
</LG>
<P>May you, dear Sir, be crowned with the smiles of Immanuel, and your following days be accom∣panied with greater blessings than hitherto you have enjoyed. And, when you arrive to the last mile-stone, death, may you enter into the blissful presence of the Lord, and be absorbed in the brightness of his glory!</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Yours, &amp;c.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

MEMORIAL OF GENERAL WASHINGTON.</HEAD>
<P>IN righteous judgment heaven hath appointed unto sinful man <HI>once to die.</HI> The shafts of death fly thick around. The beggar and the lonely pea∣sant receive the summons, and are conveyed to the dust in silence, and without regret. The prince upon his throne, the noble and the great, receive an equal, deadly blow; and, with solemn pomp, are laid within the marble tomb. The mortal part of WASHINGTON is removed to the shades of death, and America drops the mourning tear; while her most patriotic sons advance, each as with a
<PB N="280" REF="038552_0282_10125ACDA6C83900"/>
laurel in his hand to decorate the great man's grave! His birth, his youth, his manhood; his qualities in private life, his valour in the field, and his wisdom in the senate; "first in war, first in peace, and first upon his country's heart!" these eminent traits have formed a subject for the orator and the pane∣gyrist so new and astonishing, as seldom occurs in the world of letters. While others joined the nu∣merous, mourning train, and the more eloquent lips publicly pourtrayed his political character, tes∣tifying the respect in which the people of America held their beloved chief, I will gratify myself (as more accordant to his last will and testament) by closing this volume of "The Christian's Pocket Library," in raising a plain, private MEMORIAL of WASHINGTON, as a distinguished SERVANT OF GOD, the MAN whom the Lord hath delighted to honour in establishing the <HI>only</HI> government, then existing upon earth, where the perfection of reli∣gious liberty is enjoyed by all, and the church of God stands upon its spiritual basis, unconnected with civil power.</P>
<P>We will attempt to raise this memorial upon the back ground of a review of the christian profession as engrafted in the stock of civil government. Our blessed Saviour declared, <HI>my kingdom is not of this world.</HI> John xviii. 36. Its nature, subjects, laws,
<PB N="281" REF="038552_0283_10125AD026A91070"/>
government, privileges, treasures, are wholly spiritual and divine; tending to prepare the souls of men for a future state of endless bliss. No sooner did the cause of Jesus begin to increase, than civil governments, of different descriptions and of dif∣ferent countries, planted a <HI>profession</HI> of christianity into the very heart of their political constitutions. Immediately the primitive simplicity and spirit of Christ's visible kingdom vanished; it became a tool of state, and a pretext for committing the most daring depredations amongst mankind; which political bodies were not ashamed to call them THE WARS OF THE LORD. No wonder that, from such an union of church and state, whether deno∣minated <HI>papal</HI> or <HI>protestant,</HI> the ordinances and laws of christianity should be grossly mutilated, in∣tentionally to render them subservient to political purposes, and that a variety of officers should be introduced whose names and functions are unknown in the New Testament, to carry on the wheels of state, and to produce the temporal good of the whole. Against such an heterogeneous mass, and under such features, no wonder the scattered <HI>He∣brew race</HI> should increase in prejudice against christianity, and that the <HI>heathen-world</HI> should abominate that system whose fruit was rapine, cruelty, and bloodshed! Under such mixed go∣vernments,
<PB N="282" REF="038552_0284_10125AD1C3599310"/>
all who presumed to attach themselves to the spiritual kingdom of Christ, disclaiming all civil authority in matters of conscience, faith, and religious practice, were held in contempt, excluded from the particular rights of citizens, and frequently <HI>accounted as sheep for the slaughter.</HI> Thus, a profession of the religion of Jesus, whose primitive nature is benevolence and love, was corrupted, and became the fountain of partiality, tyranny, bond∣age, hatred, and wrath, separating the very souls it was calculated to unite, and <HI>scattering arrows, fire-brands and death</HI> over the world, which it was intended to reclaim.</P>
<P>In what part of Christendom was it that this most wretched spirit did not prevail? In what country has <HI>the kingdom of Christ</HI> been univer∣sally professed, as entirely distinct from the civil powers? In none. Even AMERICA, though emerged from heathen darkness, and cultivated by European hands, sat amidst the same corrupted mass of civil and ecclesiastic powers. But God designated her for a better state. Increasing in her wealth, her years tender, she felt the galling fetters on her hand! At length she sighed—she groaned—she wept beneath her load. But ah! whose eye could pity? What arm sufficient to relieve a case like her's? That ALMIGHTY BEING who taught
<PB N="283" REF="038552_0285_10125AD35F4D84F0"/>
<HI>Columbus</HI> to explore her hidden shores, beheld her suffering state, and deigned to relieve! He who raised <HI>Moses</HI> to deliver the chosen race of Israel, and girded the arm of <HI>Cirus</HI> to unfold the massy gates of Babylon, will raise a deliverer to set Ame∣rica free. Behold a WASHINGTON arise! Hea∣ven inspires his soul with wisdom, fortitude, and love—<HI>teacheth his hands to war, and his fingers to fight.</HI> And, left he should boast, <HI>my own arm hath gotten me the victory,</HI> God committeth to his command an handful of raw, undisciplined men, destitute of almost every equipment for the field, but ardent thirst to set their country free. Through seven long years of horrid war, in hopes and fears, in sweat and blood, the GENERAL urged his way. At length heaven opens, and lets down upon his servant's head the VICTOR'S CROWN. Now the fabric of civil and ecclesiastic powers, long com∣bined, in one crash fall, like the walls of antient Jericho. Peace, with her thousand thousand sweets, extends through all the land, and every pious heart exclaims, <HI>Hallelujah! for the Lord God Omni∣potent reigneth.</HI> Now, <HI>the Lord judgeth among many people, and rebuketh strong nations afar off.</HI> The sons of America <HI>beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks. Every man sits under his vine and under his fig-tree,
<PB N="284" REF="038552_0286_10125AD6E89C7FE8"/>
and none maketh them afraid.</HI> Micah iv. 3. 4. <HI>O sing unto the Lord a new song, for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand and his holy arm hath gotten him the victory.</HI> Psa. xcviii. 1. And while such effusions of grati∣tude flow to the Almighty for our deliverance and independence, can we possibly forget the MAN whom the Lord hath delighted to honour, in mar∣tialling our armies, and obtaining our victory? Impossible! Though WASHINGTON be now numbered among the dead, his name shall live with millions yet unborn.</P>
<P>Thus far we speak but half his praise. The people saved were yet without sufficient <HI>law.</HI> The peace obtained must be secured. The MAN whom heaven blessed in the fields of war now takes the presidential chair, in full CONVENTION, with a circle of worthies, chosen by the free suffrage of the people, to frame a CONSTITUTION, by which the rights, the liberties, the wealth and happiness of all may be preserved. On this strong basis every STATE builds a superstructure of peace and commerce, while distant nations give a friend's em∣brace.</P>
<P>Civil rights and liberties are sweet; but sweeter still the sacred rights of conscience. This blessing, too, flows to us from God in copious streams,
<PB N="285" REF="038552_0287_10125ADA4F16BF48"/>
through the Constitution of the United States. No test-act here; no fines nor chains; no horrid in∣quisition nor flaming faggots prepared for those who differ in faith and practice from their fellow mortals for conscience sake. Here the standard of the CROSS appears, and the voice of Jesus sounds aloud—<HI>My kingdom is not of this world.</HI> Hail, thou first spot of earth, consecrated by IMMANUEL'S benediction, to show his arm in rescuing his church from the civil powers, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>and alone upon the pure unshaken basis of his truth and grace! First fruit of the Redeemer's national conquest! Go on, most blessed Lord, in the glory of thy might, over∣turning the powers of darkness, until thou shalt reign king of nations, as thou art king of grace, diffusing celestial knowledge both to Jew and Gen∣tile, and sacred liberty prevails from pole to pole. Thus, while every American's knee shall bow be∣fore the Lord, and their lips, in purest gratitude, praise his glorious name for his boundless mercies, let the memory of WASHINGTON, through whom these blessings came, be engraven upon every heart. Not one exempt! Those whose judgments may not accord in some recent traits of this great man's counsel, must unite with me in venerating his name as a distinguished servant of the Lord, in
<PB N="286" REF="038552_0288_10122A0E129E9618"/>
procuring those streams of civil and religious li∣berty, unknown in other lands.</P>
<P>What man, elevated to such an astonishing height of honour, and so signally favoured by the victorious arm of God, that ever wore the AR∣MOUR with such diffidence and profound humility? Which, among those numerous conquerors whose names adorn the page of ancient and modern history, have maintained such an assemblage of moral VIR∣TUES as shone through the diversified stages of WASHINGTON's public life? Alas! although the victor's crown was placed on their heads, what spots of vice were often seen upon their robes, that made their country blush! Here let America lift her head, nor dare disown her General's name, but hail him—A SERVANT WORTHY OF THE LORD!</P>
