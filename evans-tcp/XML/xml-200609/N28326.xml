<P>HOW plaguy cross my master is before breakfast! not a good word comes from his mouth till he has put a roll down his throat— <STAGE>(piles up rolls on a plate)</STAGE>—It is no lit∣tle matter that brings him into temper. He will make as much havoc among these rolls, as a stage coach would with six insides. Oh, here he comes—now I shall get my trimmings, because I asked for a bit of lace to my coat. "My master opens his eyes and his mouth at the same moment in a morning, and between hunger and ill temper, snaps at every thing he sees."</P>

<P>And so you must have lace to your coat! you impertinent puppy! to give me <HI>your</HI> opinions!</P>

<SPEAKER>Nic.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not mean any thing, Sir.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>V. Sn.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what do you speak for, if you don't mean any thing? hold your tongue at once—that's the shortest way of saying nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nic.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not look on it as how you would be angry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>V. Sn</SPEAKER>
<P>Who says I'm angry?—Rascal, if you did not know the sweetness of my temper, you would not dare to open your lips: always trying to vex me and spoil my temper! But I <HI>will</HI> be quite happy and easy, I'm deter∣mined,

in spite of you all. I'll be placid—I'll be serene, —I'll be meek—I'll be— <STAGE>(turns to the table and speaks in a passion)</STAGE>—plague on you—what do you bring me this heap of dry rolls for? Fetch a muffin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nic.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes sir

I wish he would begin to eat—no∣thing cures his ill humor like plenty of rolls and muffins.</P>

<P><STAGE>(<HI>pours out tea</HI>)</STAGE>
If a man can lay up an hundred thousand pounds, and not have a right to his own way of thinking at least, there's an end to every thing at once. If I had not the sweetest temper in the world
<STAGE>(Nicholas re∣turns with several muffins)</STAGE>—Where's the muffins—Pup∣py! you don't think my liveries handsome enough!— D'ye call these muffins? Butter a roll or two. Don't let me see you open your

Do you starve?</P>

<SPEAKER>Nic.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>observing that he had eat</HI>)</STAGE>
No, we know better how to follow our master's example. We be main well as to the inside lining. "But—lud! Sir—there's our neighbor's servants be as fine as so many puppets at the wax work.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Yes, and live on the same diet as puppets at the wax work. Go down into the kitchen, you rascal, and stop your mouth."</P>

<P>What answer be I to give the Polandish gentle∣man, that lodges up stairs?</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>V. Sn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I cannot hurry my breakfast for him— Zounds! you don't let me swallow my victuals. What is the use of money if one cannot be happy at one's meals?
<STAGE>(<HI>Nicolas going</HI>)</STAGE>
What are you
<STAGE>(<HI>peevishly</HI>)</STAGE>
going away for, before I have done speaking? Probably Mr. Adel∣bert wants to pay his rent—so, as soon as I've eat this roll tell him I'm at leisure. Go—and don't open your lips.—</P>

<P>Mr. Van Snarl, I come to wait on you—</P>

<SPEAKER>V. Sn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rent in hand—strict to your word, eh? I'm glad to see it. It's not always the case with gentlemen of small fortune.</P>

<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>With <HI>gentlemen</HI> of every fortune —They profess an obligation over which wealth has no influence.</P>
</SP>

<P>Aye! what's that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>V. Sn.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should not like my rent in that coin: Honour makes a good cabinet medal, but won't pass on 'Change.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>In my country, in Poland, it will—I have seen it too in England, at the call of friendship or humani∣ty, accepted and endorsed for a man's whole estate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>V. Sn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Psha! why d'ye plague me about England?— People love to praise every country but the country they live in.</P>

<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm afraid I disturb you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>V. Sn.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, sit down; a punctual tenant is never any disturbance. Only that rascal Nicolas has been trying to spoil the sweetness of my temper. Puppy! wants a live∣ry <HI>with a bit af lace</HI>
<STAGE>(<HI>imitates Nicolas</HI>)</STAGE>
as if he could eat lace!
<STAGE>(forced laugh)</STAGE>
ha—ha—as if he could eat lace, eh, Mr. Adelbert! Now you're a sensible man—you prefer the plain dress of your country—you're economical.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Necessity imposes that duty on me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>V. Sn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, aye, I know you're not so rich as I am. I have been laying up money these twenty years. You'd, hardly believe, Mr. Adelbert, how interest upon interest, once set a rolling, gathers like a snowball. And you see

there they are at it—there's my mill going, eh! look—there it goes.</P>

<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are a happy man, Mr. Von Snarl.</P>

<P>Happy! to be sure I am. Why should not we all be happy? Come, now to business.</P>

Well then, I owe, Sir, already a debt to you; I come to ask your permission to encrease it.</P>

What!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>If from riches you derive happiness, you have assuredly learnt their real value, that of imparting happi∣ness to others; and I am confident you will not turn your back on one, who entrusts you with his distress.</P>

<P>Well, I hope they'll arrive soon.</P>

<P>Shall I pour you out a dish of tea?</P>

<P>You have seen the papers I suppose—no news—</P>

<P><STAGE>(<HI>piqued</HI>)</STAGE>
Mr. Von Snarl, you are a rich man, and accustomed to speculations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>V. Sn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Speculations! well what of that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you ever speculate on the face of an honest man?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>V. Sn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did I ever see one?
<STAGE>(<HI>sarcastically.</HI>)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true I can give little security. This minia∣ture,
<STAGE>(drawing a miniature from his bosom)</STAGE>
is the only one I am able to offer. It is set with a few brilliants, of no great value, and I am sorry to part with it. But if you would accept it as a pledge—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>V. Sn.</SPEAKER>
<P>A pledge!—why the devil! d'ye take me for a pawnbroker?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg pardon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>V. Sn.</SPEAKER>
<P>What I give, I give without pledge, bond or note.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Even to a stranger?</P>

<P>D'ye observe?—when we can—but my purse won't bear a loan at present.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only twenty pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>V. Sn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Twenty pounds! twenty devils. I had yester∣day two bankruptcies in my books—one of my ships from Africa lost, with a cargo of 400 blacks on board—besides the parson's widow, Mrs. Rose and her daughter, whom I
<PB N="7" REF="037754_0007_100F450806356AA0"/>
maintain, as you know, in the house. I won't say what they cost me, because that's charity—but I know I have a tender heart and a sweet temper, that would be my ruin, if I did not watch my purse at both ends. But come—if I can't lend you my money, I'll give you my advice. Go to Levi, the great Jew, and he'll lend you, on the picture nearly its full value.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>To a Jew!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>V. Sn.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Jew! well, what of that? I would as soon do business with a Jew as a Christian. He'll deal with you as a man and a friend.</P>

<P>And not as <HI>you</HI> have done. I beg pardon for the trouble of this visit.

<P>Hark'ye, Mr. Adelbert,
<STAGE>(<HI>Adelbert returns</HI>)</STAGE>
I ex∣pect to see my son in law every hour, and I shall want a room for him. I don't mean to be uncivil to you, because you have not got twenty pounds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand you—I shall provide myself with another lodging.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>V. Sn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, as you like for that: I don't mean to turn you out of the house. You'll dine with me before you go away to-day?</P>

<P>Pretty talking! it would be a fine thing in∣deed, if one could blow good things on the table, forsooth, as they do in the Rambling Night's Entertainments.— That's all sinful witchcraft, and I am sure you cannot expect a clergyman,s widow, as I am, to meddle with any such devilish practices.</P>

<P>Why, then you'll have the comfort of marrying a blind man; for, to tell you plainly, the affair is conclu∣ded, and if you don't take him, and like him too when he is come, never expect to have a farthing of my money; and another time you may provide for yourself.

<P>Oh, Dear! that was not said in earnest.</P>

<P>Ah, Josephine! you are very happy;—for <HI>you have a father</HI>—</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Will you change fathers with me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loui.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—not for all the world. My father, to be sure, won't see me; and I always thought that very strange: But, in every thing else, he is so good to me, and so kind!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jos.</SPEAKER>
<P>But not very wise▪ I think. He refuses to see you, and does not know that he sees you every hour. Un∣der the name of Mrs. Rose's daughter you have won his affection, in spite of his prejudice and absurdities.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loui.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I was but sure of that, Josephine!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jos.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure of it—and, what is better, he loves you for your own sake: the parent's vanity has no hand in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loui.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why should he shun me so, Josephine? An't I his child? And, indeed, indeed, I never did any thing willingly to offend him. Why should he drive me from his sight, as soon as I was born? I grew up far away from him, and he forbids me now to come to him, that I may take his hand, and press it to my lips.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jos.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure it is droll enough. Father and daugh∣ter live in the same house, converse together, correspond together, and yet are strangers, except by letters, which are sometimes a week in travelling from one to the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loui.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yesterday he got my last letter. When I sat down to it, Josephine, my heart was quite full:—and I
<PB N="15" REF="037754_0015_100F451A397F3530"/>
beg'd so hard to see him; and the words were, all, so blotted, he must have seen that I cried all the while I was writing it. I fancied in the evening he looked more thoughtful than ever. Perhaps he may be brought to give his consent to see me at last. Don't you think he might, Josephine?</P>
</SP>

<P>If I were to tell you that I saw him wipe a tear away with his hand—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loui.</SPEAKER>

three hundred crowns! I wish they were three thousand, with all my heart.</P>

<P>Oh, you extravagant child! three hundred crowns! you won't surely give that sum away!</P>

<P>No—I'll lay it out at interest—I'll be an usurer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. R.</SPEAKER>
<P>An usurer, forsooth! Ah, child, child! you learn to cypher and cast accounts, to be sure; but how many pence there are in a dollar, you'll never learn to reckon as long as you live.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loui.</SPEAKER>
<P>That, now, may be very true: and, somehow or other, I always thought charity much easier than arithme∣tick. I know Mr. Van Snarl takes a deal of pleasure in counting up his dollars; but, for my part, I think there is more pleasure, by half, in giving money to the distress'd, and letting them count it for me.

<P>The free and liberal use we make of it. Wealth, brother, is like a sword, placed in various hands. Fools are laughed at for their ignorance in using it; knaves, who grasp it, hurt their neighbours with it; wise and be∣nevolent men, alone, know how to guard themselves with it, while they protect the weak, who want their assistance.</P>

<P>True, when one has met with hardships, one looks older than one really is. But, dear Mr. Totum, marriage is a serious step; when I lost poor dear Dr. O∣learius—Heaven grant him rest!—I made a vow never to marry again.</P>

<P><STAGE>(<HI>nettled</HI>)</STAGE>
If that is meant as a joke, Sir, it is, without under-rating it, a very clumsy one; but, if you are in earnest, I must inform you, that both my birth and character place me so far beyond this low suspicion, that I will sooner die than consent to give you the gross proof you require of your absurdity. I utterly despise the meanness of your conduct; and leave you, lest, by per∣sisting in it, you should rouse me to convert the contempt I feel for you, into chastisement.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leopold.</SPEAKER>
<P>NAY, nay—yet come in—this is a liberty I do not frequently take. I love the world too little to force myself upon it—but when a wrong is offered to an inno∣cent person, a very hermit may find cause to leave his cell.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I respect the justice of your sentiments, but I ought never to be seen again in this house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P>My brother has been in the wrong—the box is found—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Probably.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P>The lining of his pocket was unsewed—and the box slipped through it—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>And from such a trifle a man's honour is to be called in question!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P>My brother is ashamed of his behaviour—he will beg your pardon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>"Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not seek to witness the humiliation of another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>"Leop."</SPEAKER>
<P>He has been sharply reproved by all of us— particularly by Louisa— <STAGE>(observing Adelbert with at∣tention.)</STAGE></P>

By Louisa!— Let all be forgotten—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P>The commission of my visit is then at an end.— I could wish to prolong it on my own account. Your manner has interested me—will you answer me, as a man, what I shall ask you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>As a man!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, for I would make my enquiry as a man; who, though he shut himself from the bustle of the world,
<PB N="30" REF="037754_0030_100F453D075E46B8"/>
as I do, should never lock up the kind impulses of his heart towards a fellow creature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will answer you—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your resentment of my brother's proposition was natural: but before you avowed that resentment, I fancied that I remark'd a certain embarrassment in your manner, which appeared to proceed from some other cause than indignation. What was that cause?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>after a pause</HI>)</STAGE>
False shame.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P>In what could that consist?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am poor—very poor—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Poverty is no dishonor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly none to me. To Poland, to my struggling country, I sacrificed my wealth as I would have sacrificed my life, if it had required it—My country is no more, and we are wanderers on a burthen∣ed earth, finding no refuge but in the hearts of the hu∣mane and virtuous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you are young, and industry might—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>That has ever been my friend. The little ta∣lents with which the affluence of my parents crowned my education, have preserved me from the extremes of indigence. The spirit of Poland has supplied the rest.</P>
<STAGE>(<HI>With warmth.</HI>)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your gains then are probably small?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>When beneath the gilded roofs of the wealthy, the social banquet gladdens the heart, I take my solitary walk into the fields, and under heaven's canopy I make my poor repast. Such was my intention to-day, be∣fore your brother unexpectedly invited me to his table.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know what pass'd. Had I submitted to the search proposed, my scanty meal must have been dis∣covered.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>expressing great surprise and emotion</HI>)</STAGE>
Young man, we must be better acquainted. Yet that cannot be without more confidence on your part.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am a stranger—an unknown exile—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who yet chose rather to bear the harsh suspicion that wronged you, than submit to that pity, which; however painful to you, would have exulted in your relief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="31" REF="037754_0031_100F453E909BFBD0"/>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps I acted from prejudice—but let me con∣fess my pride. Had one contemptuous glance fallen on the humble pittance which I bore about me—had any one but smiled—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had any one dared to smile, I—I would have resented it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are warm, sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P>My heart is so. Young man, since your resi∣dence at my brother's I have marked you, and am per∣suaded of your worth—and if you will accept of a small loan from me—it will come from the hand of a friend— do not reject it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>When I shall be unable to earn even the morsel which I concealed to-day, I will come to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Give me your hand.
<STAGE>(<HI>they shake hands</HI>)</STAGE>
Another time we will— <STAGE>(looks round in great agitation)</STAGE>
Yonder comes Louisa—let me see you again. At another time if the recital be not painful to you, I will request your con∣fidence: and should it open afresh the wounds of your bosom, be persuaded that you will meet a friend, who will strive to heal them—one practised in sorrow—one, whose delight it would be to pour out the balm of comfort, and confer a happiness which he cannot hope himself to taste.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> LOUISA.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loui.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought Mr. Leopold had not been gone, and I—oh! dear me, you seem quite flurried—I hope nothing has happened—I hope you have not done any thing, sir, to offend my—to offend Mr. Leopold, sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Far from it, I hope—he came just now to con∣fer favors on me, which I must not accept.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loui.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do you mean to go, then—from—from this house, sir?— <STAGE>(looks down embarrassed)</STAGE>—Indeed, I am sorry—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you take an interest in my fate, Louisa?— Beware of that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loui.</SPEAKER>
<P>Beware!—and why so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because poverty, which in general silences the feelings, is not always master over the heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="32" REF="037754_0032_100F454060F685B8"/>
<SPEAKER>Loui.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the poor have hearts like other people—and when the heart is good, why should poverty silence it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>The rich only dare to speak its language—A man like Totum dares to offer you his hand, he dares to say— I love you—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lou.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what signifies his saying that? I'm sure I don't mind what he says.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>It signifies something, Louisa—for the rich man is at least received with politeness, the poor one, howe∣ver worthy in other respects, is rejected with scorn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lou.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then they who reject a worthy man, because he is poor, never deserve a rich one, I am certain.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> VAN SNARL.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>V. Sn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Adelbert. I—I am come to beg your par∣don—I have found—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg that not a word may be spoken on the subject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>V. Sn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why may'nt I say, I found myself in the wrong? Surely 'tis not for the pleasure of saying it—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Leopold has explained all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>V. Sn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, very well, and now I mean to make you amends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Amends!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>V. Sn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, it goes against a man's stomach, to be sure, —but I must make you an apology—Leopold says I must, —they all say I must—It's cursed disagreeable—but I must make you amends—so you see I do it with a good grace. I'm come to tell you, that I am just sending out a ship, and you shall go supercargo.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! My gratitude robs me of words to thank you.</P>

myself; you shall only have to purchase negroes— <STAGE>(Adel. shudders)</STAGE>
What is the matter with you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Humbled though I am, in poverty and in afflic∣tion; harrassed by daily cares, and wounded by hourly regrets—the bread I earn shall never force a tear from the helpless, nor bring remorse to my repast.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>V. Sn.</SPEAKER>
<P>So now I must not make him amends—I'm not to have my own way in any thing. What, then, you de∣spise my offer? Go on with your romantic notions:— Here's a pretty couple of you!—one does not choose a husband with eighty thousand marks, and the other won't go to sea to make his fortune for life. I wish you had nothing but sentiment and romance to eat for a fortnight, and by that time, you, Miss, would take Tilman Totum, with eighty thousand marks, and you, sir, without a pound in your pocket, would be glad to sail to the coast of Gui∣nea—Zounds! if I had not the sweetest temper in the world, I should be kept in a perpetual passion.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Exit Van Snarl.</STAGE>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel</SPEAKER>
<P>What agitates you, Louisa</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loui.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have a kind heart, Mr. Adelbert, for every one but yourself—You wo'nt go, then, to make your fortune? Oh, dear, if you had gone—Mr. Totum Would then have asked me again to marry him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>And would you have accepted him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loui.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, never—though he were ten times as rich as he is.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>(A pause for a few moments.)</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does my heart deceive me, or do I read yours aright, Louisa?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loui.</SPEAKER>
<P>What do you mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were you ever in love, Louisa?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loui.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord! that's a strange question—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I have perhaps no right to ask it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loui.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, though you have lived a whole year in this house, we know nothing of you, to be sure, but that you come from Poland, and <HI>that</HI> we should hardly know ei∣ther, but from your dress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would you listen with patience to my story, if I should disclose it to you, and you alone?</P>

<P>With patience! Ah! I wish you would try.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well,—during the last struggles of our expiring state, though private and important duties detained me at a distance, I embarked my whole fortune on the side of those, who, even against a victorious enemy, wished to defend their native country—you know the result—my situation here speaks it—except a trifling stipend that is still left to me, I have no remaining possession but health, no hope but industry—Alas! my poor country!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loui.</SPEAKER>
<P>And can you be happy no where but in Poland, Mr. Adelbert?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I might yet be happy—I might—I struggle in vain against myself—Reason forgets to speak, and my heart betrays me.
<STAGE>(<HI>he kneels to Louisa.</HI>)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loui.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, dear! you frighten me out of my wits—if any one should come—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hope only can raise me from the ground—
<STAGE>(Louisa hides her face with one hand, and holds out the other to Adelbert, who seizes it and presses it with rap∣ture to his lips)</STAGE>
Then I am happy—My banishment, my wrongs, my sufferings, all—all are now a dream. Will you indeed share my poverty? Oh! then we will make it a lot the richest ones shall envy. The dawn shall light me forth to industry, and the dews of evening shall warn me from my work. Love shall season our scanty meal, and the husband, returning from his toil, shall enjoy, in contentment and affection, a kindlier rest than lights upon the downy beds of palaces.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loui.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! but I am not so poor as you imagine— <STAGE>(<HI>Adel∣bert starts</HI>)</STAGE>
I am not the orphan of a clergyman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>No!</P>

<P>I have a father, and a rich one too.</P>

You are a good-natur'd soul, and you know what a plague it is to share a fortune with the person whom we love best, and so would save Louisa that trouble. Well, I grant you a twelvemonth for reflection; Louisa will then be nine∣teen, and you may by that time resolve to accept her with the incumbrance of her fortune.

<P>My—my name is Louisa Rose. I am a poor clergyman's orphan, who live in this house. Perhaps you have business with Mr. Van Snarl?</P>

<SPEAKER>Jos.</SPEAKER>
<P>With his daughter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>They say she has a great fortune; and, about six weeks ago, says my mother one evening, to me— "Dear Timothy, you are a poor fellow, and must make your fortune by marriage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jos.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very wisely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very motherly, you mean. There's Mr. Van Snarl, says she, your father's old school-fellow, has a most charming daughter—I dare say you must know her.</P>

<P>Oh, to be sure—I know Josephine as well as I know myself.</P>

<P>She is not handsomer than I am.</P>

<P>I like that—she has no need.—Has she good sense?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jos.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not enough to prevent her from talking.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I like that—Is she kind hearted, good to the poor?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Jos.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, lord! the poor get nothing in this house, if I do not give it them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't like that. Is she grave or lively?</P>
</SP>

<P>As wild as a young devil.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye! Then she'll just do for me.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot tell you at present.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>V. Sn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I cannot lend it you at present.—D'ye in∣tend to set all my doors wide open to-day?—First comes my daughter, "Pappa, lend me the master-key."—She is hardly gone, when you come, "Brother, lend me the master-key."—Every body wants me to lend them some∣thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surely thou don't distrust me?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>V. Sn.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't say that:—I know you won't rob me; but 'tis fair enough to refuse you for all that.</P>

<P>That's my fancy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>V. Sn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and it's my fancy not to lend you the master key. I have my particular reasons as well as you, only I'm not so unbrotherly minded; but that is no won∣der—you have not such a remarkable sweet temper as I have—There, there's the key, but take notice, if I miss a single bottle of wine, you shall be answerable for it.</P>

<SPEAKER>Loui.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am an orphan; and it signifies so little what a poor girl, like me, feels for the distress of other people, that I am afraid to tell you how many tears you have cost me.</P>

<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Tears for me!</P>

<P>indeed I wish to share them. Do let me speak to you. Death has robbed you of a wife, but you have still a daughter left: she would be almost wild with joy, if she could fill her mother's place in your affection— Why will you not call her to you?</P>

Eh! what is this! the very bill I sent by yesterday's post to my daughter! how can it have come into this man's box?—Could the servant I sent with the letter have opened it?—he is seemingly honest—nay I know him to be so—"Fie, fie, I'm ashamed of myself when I suspect an honest man."

A plague on him; I hear him at the foot of the staircase— there are only thirty-four steps, two landing places, and a turning, between me and a sword through my body. Oh, the devil! here he is on the stairs. Lets return the note — <STAGE>(sets the box down on the table, and tries to open it.)</STAGE>
Devil on devil! the box shuts with a spring-lock, and the lid is fast.
"O lud, if this piece of forgery is found up∣on me, I shall be brought in an accomplice, and then there'll be a halter for <HI>me.</HI>"
I have open'd a fine head of account here. Where shall I put the note? Here is a trunk as large as our ledger. I'll insert it here; he won't think of opening this.

</SP>
<SP>

<P>I left my door lock'd.</P>

<P>Closed; pardon me, it stood open, I swear; though there's no occasion to swear that, because it is true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>But we found it shut this moment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, yes; while I was just looking out at the window, a sudden <HI>draft</HI> came in per chimney, and closed the account—closed the door, I mean.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>And lock'd it too?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lock'd it! Oh, perhaps it shuts with a spring,

like some other cursed locks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>It does not turn without a key.</P>

<P>No? not turn!—then it must have been an Eddy wind,—a sort of <HI>tornado</HI>—we suffer much by them in our trade.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, Sir, what might occasion me the honour of this visit?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tot.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Lord, Sir, your chamber commands such a fine view of the forest! I was just taking a peep, look∣ing over your leaves—the leaves of your trees, I mean. Charming green fields, Sir! smooth as, the desks in our counting-house. What beautiful geese, Sir, on the com∣mon yonder! good quills, I warrant; eighteen stivers per dozen.

<P>As I was finishing my wine this afternoon at the Hotel, I engaged a party at Faro, which was at my side.

<P>Yes, debtor's side.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I knew no one: a man in the dress of an offi∣cer held the bank, so, without scruple, I punted high, and lost a good round sum. On this I wanted to force the game, and put an hundred ducats on one card.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, a hundred ducats; exactly that sum I shall send to agent at Leipsig to-morrow; three notes ready in iron chest, No. 21, three months date, No. 29—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, but, my friend yonder in his bed∣room, whose name I don't know, stood leaning on a chair, and observing the game.—You don't attend to me.

<P>Yes—I do—Sir; attention is the best point of business—I am attending, Sir—to— <STAGE>(<HI>aside</HI>)</STAGE>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is hard to believe, indeed; but all circum∣stances considered—This gentleman shall judge. When I went out this morning, I left nothing but a few trifles of apparel in my trunk, and at my return I find you locked in my room, and here a note of exchange. It is in vain to deny it; you must have put it into my trunk.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, sir—if I must confess, I did put it into the trunk, but—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Generous man! how have I mistaken you!— You saw me cast down by misfortune, and wished to lift me from the ground. But this, sir, cannot be accepted.</P>
</SP>

<P>Zounds! it is accepted already. You have only to offer it for payment, and then— <STAGE>(aside)</STAGE>

<P>Yes—but I swear I found it in your box.</P>

<P>No—but the generous Leopold—</P>

<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be who he may, has chosen a vile deputy. But let that pass—one thing is clear—from what I have now witness'd—you are possessed of every thing that a brave man should have, except money. My purse is at your command—you have open'd my heart already; and I should think myself a mean wretch indeed, if, when the strings of my heart are touch'd, those of my purse did not instantly follow.</P>
</SP>

<P>The debt that lies on your heart, pay in the heart's coin, when you please. At present I am in no want of money.</P>

<P>Unfortunately! for whom?</P>

<P>What have I said! pardon me, my friend. You have an honest open countenance, and it led me half way to a confession, which—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may very safely entrust to me—Go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>A confidence so rashly ventured—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is, I own, as rare as the generous action, by which you have made me your friend for life.</P>

<P>I cannot resist you—yes, I love Louisa—the a∣gitation in which you see me, will tell you how much I love her. While I believed her the orphan of a poor and humble clergyman, I flattered myself I might have ob∣tained her—but, alas!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! did not Von Snarl acknowledge her for his daughter?</P>
</SP>

<P>No: I came to marry Josephine, Von Snarl's daughter.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, the truth is, I am very properly served —I came into this house under a false name, and the girls have outwitted me—Josephine suspected my design, and pass'd herself on me for Louisa Rose. I'll be reveng'd; tho' egad, I like her better than ever.</P>

<P>Then you know nothing of Louisa?</P>

One word before I go, my dear new friend—You perceive I am likely to have some interest in this house, and if it can avail you with Louisa, you shall find that the mark a ras∣cal has left on your wrist, will be much sooner worn away than the impression you have made on an honest man's heart.

<P>Sir, my name is Louisa Rose—</P>

<P>Another Louisa Rose? and yet I heard a per∣son in this house, say just now, that there is but one Lou∣isa Rose in the world— <STAGE>(<HI>Josephine smiles, Louisa blush∣es</HI>)</STAGE>
Well, my dear Louisa Roses, inform me where I may find the real genuine Josephine?</P>

<P>What is your pleasure, sir, with her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Exactly this—if you are both Louisa Rose, I have no business with either of you—but if you are both Josephine, I'm resolved I'll marry you both.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loui.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is not this the gentleman you expected to-day?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jos.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, my lover, Hans William? Oh, no, he wears a full bottom'd wig, has a shrill voice, and is bandy-legg'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is very like me, for all that.</P>

<P>No. I have been expecting him this whole morn∣ing, and in the mean time comes this saucy—</P>

<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which do you wish?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jos.</SPEAKER>
<P>Neither—Can you speak the truth?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jos.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do it then this moment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am in love with you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jos.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who ask'd you that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you settled, what day will be convenient for our wedding?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jos.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, then, you are determined to marry me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Positively.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jos.</SPEAKER>
<P>And have you spoken to my father?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jos.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what said he?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. W.</SPEAKER>
<P>He requested me never to put my foot over his threshold again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jos.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed! and what induces you to refuse him such a trifling request?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not—I mean to take him at his word, only I design to take you with me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Are you quite sure of that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Quite—</P>

a man intends to rob an honest girl of her name, he should at least provide her with another.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I gave you your choice of two.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Jos.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, then, your name is not Trifle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>No more than yours is Louisa Rose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jos.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why did you wish to impose on me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll tell you. Your father and mine have treated our love a little too much in a mercantile manner.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Jos.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Our</HI> love!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not wish to contradict my father, and as my heart was free, I neither promised or refused, but I was determined first to take a look at you. If I had not liked you, I should have been off again in a moment: but—here I am still—and, to own the truth at once—I do like you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>That you'll find out after the wedding.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jos.</SPEAKER>
<P>A clear bargain, my father says, prevents quar∣rels—suppose we agree to tell our own faults to one another, and then try if we can be friends.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jos.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, do you begin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>First, I am hotheaded and passionate.</P>

<SP>

<P>That may be cured by good temper on my part.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm careless—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jos.</SPEAKER>
<P>That will be cured when you have a wife to look after.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am vain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jos.</SPEAKER>
<P>That you must only be of me.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall be vainer than ever, if I win you for my wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Well, that I'll forgive—proceed.</P>

<P>How do you pass the day when you are at home?</P>

<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have a foolish custom of my country—I like a pipe for an hour or two—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jos.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot endure it—you must give up the pipe,</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall find that difficult, perhaps.</P>

<P>You are true to your appointment, Louisa.</P>

<P>I have counted the minutes ever since I left you. What a dark and dismal room this is!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P>It wears the colour of mourning—In the first hours of grief, the eye feeds with pleasure on these congenial hues—but a real and lasting grief outlives the very sense of these vain distinctions—In my sight these walls are now a mere blank—So also to me is life— mournful and void.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loui.</SPEAKER>
<P>You said your life was not always so sad.</P>

<P>Does she <HI>love</HI> you!—Oh!—Since she has been old enough to learn what happiness means, the wish to be known to you, has been the dearest of her heart.

I—I hope I may believe you.</P>

<P>You have a right to doubt; but do not condemn me, girl, if I have appeared cold and unconcerned for one, whose welfare is so dear to me—such, as, for these few months past, <HI>you</HI> have seen me—such have I been for seventeen years; during that period, I have sometimes lived for men, but no one has lived for me. You, my good girl, are the first who have rekindled in my heart the desire to see my daughter.</P>

<P>Then blessed be the moment in which I entered this house!</P>

<P>I bless it.—Hear me, Louisa, censure me, but pity and excuse me. I was once rich, for I possessed in a virtuous wife, the only true riches in this world, Con∣tent and Cheerfulness. When the Creator finished his glorious work of nature, he added its last bright ornament, Woman! I loved one alone, among all beings:—I had chosen her from a world, and from a world I would still choose her. The years of our first love fell swiftly into that eternity where she now resides. The birth of a

<P>While yet Emilia's grave was fresh, I clasp'd her infant to my bosom, and flying from the world, re∣solved to live for my child alone—She was the only treasure left to me on earth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loui.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why did you forsake that child?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mark me—As I convey'd my little one to the fostering refuge I had provided for her, methought her mother's spirit beamed in her features—Oh! what did that look effect! The keen remembrance of my loss, pierced anew into my soul—I dreaded to turn again to∣wards my child—her existence had destroyed what was dearer to me than my own—I entrusted her with those, of whose kind hearts I was well assured—Business call∣ed me away—concerns of my wife's fortune— <STAGE>(after a pause, he shudders)</STAGE>
I have never returned to my child.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Had she deserved this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Day after day, year after year, have I ardently sighed to meet my child again. But she is well and hap∣py—and what could my presence bestow? The sight of my affliction—of my misery—I strove to rouse me from despair—I turned from the grave, which had devoured my hopes, and sought for consolation among men—I told them my sorrows, and met derision—until at last I shut my bosom against the world, and fled, where only I could escape torment—to solitude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loui.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! I'm afraid you found little comfort there.</P>

<P>Well, Nicolas—are the constables posted?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Nic.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are ready, down at the door—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Down at the door—right. Let no one take his head out of the house; if I call, be ready, at a moment's notice—away—no blunders—good Nicolas.</P>

<SPEAKER>V. Sn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fine doings, indeed! Did not I tell you never to come into my house again?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did not I tell you that I would come in∣to it again? This is the letter from my father—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>V. Sn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Psha! I suppose it's all about the red nose and the peaches.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Read it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>V. Sn.</SPEAKER>
<P>What should I read it for? I have told you al∣ready to get out of my house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll, go, as soon as you have read the letter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>V. Sn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, you shall not spoil the sweetness of my temper. I have read many useless letters in my life be∣fore this:
<STAGE>(<HI>opens the letter and reads</HI>)</STAGE>
"The bearer of this, my lawful son and heir, Hans William,
<STAGE>(<HI>surprised</HI>)</STAGE>
whom I send in good condition"—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I'm in pretty good case—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>V. Sn.</SPEAKER>
<P>"By this day's mail"—hem—"Vander Hou∣sen &amp; Co."—the devil! you have taken me in,
<STAGE>(forces a laugh)</STAGE>
ha—ha—I thought you had too honest a face for a cheat. Did not I tell you, Josephine, he was of prime quality—but <HI>Hans</HI> must not come near you— <STAGE>(<HI>to</HI> H. W.)</STAGE>
give me your hand—you are a rogue and a wit; but if you had not been a rich rogue, like myself—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jos.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>to</HI> H. WIL.)</STAGE>
You would be a rogue and a thief—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And must never more have put my foot over the threshold—</P>
</SP>

<PB N="63" REF="037754_0063_100F458AACD61A88"/>
<SPEAKER>V. Sn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, why d'ye put me in mind of that? If I had not the sweetest temper—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> LEOPOLD.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Brother, give me joy—Louisa Rose shall be married to-day, as you said.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>V. Sn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, she consents at last to take eighty thousand marks, does she?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P>She shall give her hand, as it should always be given, where the heart guides it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>V. Sn.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why did she plague me this morning with all that nonsense?—Only to put me in a passion!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> TOTUM <HI>and</HI> Mrs. ROSE.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tot.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, Sir, the constables are at the door—he can∣not have negociated the bill already—Oh, yonder he comes—now, Sir—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>(<HI>looks towards the side scene</HI>)</STAGE>
Adelbert! a bill! what is all this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>V. Sn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, what should it be? Totum has a charge against my lodger for a note, purporting to be drawn by you, for three hundred crowns.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Against my friend!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>V. Sn.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your friend! Do you know any thing more of him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>H. Wil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I know him for one who thinks every stranger entitled to his regard, and who will rather risk his life, than suffer an honest man to become the dupe of a knave. Perhaps I may find
<STAGE>(<HI>looks at</HI> TOTUM <HI>with scorn</HI>)</STAGE>
an opportunity of doing as much for him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here is the note, written by myself—you found it in the hands of a man of integrity, and, as a proof of my esteem for him, I mean to make him heir to my whole fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>V. Sn.</SPEAKER>
<P>You do!—and pray what becomes of your daughter?</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> ADELBERT <HI>and</HI> LOUISA.</STAGE>

<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Behold her.
<STAGE>(VON SNARL <HI>and</HI> TOTUM <HI>ex∣press surprise.</HI>)</STAGE>
In the fond and artless affections of her

mind, while I recognized the image of her whom I ado∣red, I read likewise, in forcible characters, my own duty —yes—this is my daughter, and, if I guess the heart a∣right—this is my son.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>An outcast!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have found an asylum here. Accept her, Adelbert: with my whole heart I give her to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. R.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, what a fine sermon my poor dear Dr. Olearius wou'd have made on this occasion!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>V. Sn.</SPEAKER>
<P>So! I shall give Louisa a wedding-dinner, as I said—I'm right this time, in spite of you all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tot.</SPEAKER>
<P>And if this be the case, I may as well make the constables void.—Hymen has protested my draught: and, for fear the Pole should make a scratch in my ledg∣er, I won't leave him a <HI>single side</HI> for a memorandum sheet.—Hang Hymen!—Plague light on the Pole!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Exit</HI> TOTUM.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leop.</SPEAKER>
<P>The indulgence of a gloomy temper has stolen from my life its sweetest hours, and drawn sighs from the bosom of innocence—my child, forgive me!—Amid tears of anguish and despair you were baptised.—Amid those of repentance and joy, receive a father's blessing!—"Con∣vinced of my error, I will now return with cheerfulness to the world, and bear, without repining, the lot which heaven has assigned me.—The present emotions of my heart instruct me, that there is no cordial for a parent's sorrows beyond the virtuous affection of A DAUGHTER."</P>
