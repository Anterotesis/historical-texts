<P>UGH, ugh, ugh,—what a sad rage for novelty there is in this foolish world! How eagerly all your inspectors in the Daily Advertiser, the New-York Packet, and all the long catalogue of advertisers and intelligencers, catch'd at the news of the day just now at the Coffee-House; though a wife man and a king has told them, there's nothing new under the sun.

<P>That's more than I can say, Thomas, for I'm sure 'tis strange to hear so many people praise this same new Consti∣tution, as it is call'd.—Has the New-York Journal been brought to day?</P>

<P>Why, you know, sir, there's never any thing in this paper but what's on your side of the question.</P>

<P>Nothing concerning this same Constitution there is so much talk about, friend Horace? A miserable Constitution, by the bye.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Loveyet, you run on in such a surprizing manner with your narrations, imprecations, admirations, and interrogations, that, upon my education, sir, I believe you are approaching to insanity, phrenzy, lunacy, madness, distraction,—a man of your age—</P>
</SP>

<P>Age. sir, age!—And what then, sir, egh!—what then? I'd have you to know, sir, that I shall not have lived forty years 'till next spring twelvemonth, old as I am; and if my countenance seems to belie me a little or so, why—trouble, concern for the good of my country, sir, and this tyrannical villainous Constitution have made me look so; but my health is sound, sir; my lungs are good, sir, <STAGE>raising his voice</STAGE>—ugh, ugh, ugh,—I am neither spindle-shank'd nor crook-back'd, and I can kiss a pretty girl with as good a relish as—ugh, ugh,—ha, ha, ha.

</SP>
<SP>

<P>Oh, monstrous! Entient! an entient woman by the side of an ancient husband! Most preposterous, unnatural, and altogether incongruous!</P>

<P>I'm not perfectly right;—I—I—I mean <HI>you</HI> are not perfectly right; and as for her age, why I should like her to be—let me see—about ten years younger than myself: a man shou'd be at least ten years older than his wife.</P>

<P>Ten years;—fifty three and ten are sixty three.—Then you mean your wife shall be fifty three years of age.</P>

<P>S'death, sir! I tell you I am but two and forty years old: She shan't be more than thirty odd, sir, and she shall be ten years younger than I am too.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. thirty odd years younger than <HI>you</HI> are; ha, ha. The exiguity of those legs is a most promising earnest of your future exploits, and demonstrate your agility, virility, salubrity, and amorosity; ha, ha, ha. I can't help laughing to think what a blessed union there will be between August and December; a jolly, buxom, wanton, wishful, plethoric female of thirty odd, to an infirm, decrepit, consumptive, gouty, rheumatic, asthmatic, phlegmatic mortal of near seventy; ha, ha. Exquisitely droll and humorous, upon my erudition. It puts me in mind of a hot bed in a hard winter, surrounded with ice, and made verdant and flourishing only by artificial means.</P>

<P>In compliance with the commands of a Father, here I am, once more in the place of my nativity. Duty to him, and curiosity to know, why he has enjoined my sudden departure so peremptorily, as well as a desire to see New-York (perhaps never to leave it more) have all conspir'd to bring me here sooner than I am expected,—let me see—yes, I must try to find out Frankton first. <STAGE>Humphry crosses the stage.</STAGE> Here, friend, honest man, prithee stop.</P>

<P>No, I don't know where any body lives in this big city, not I; for my part, I believe how they all lives in the street, there's such a monstrous sight of people a scrouging backards and forards, as the old saying is. If I was home now—</P>

<P>Oh, you may make free and welcome, for the more freer the more welcomer, as the old saying is; I never thinks myself too good to discourse my superiors: There's some of our townsfolks now, why some of um isn't so good as I, to be sure.—There's Tom Forge, the blacksmith, and little Daniel Snip, the taylor, and Roger Peg, the cobler, and Tim Frize, the barber, and Landlord Tipple, that keeps the ale∣house at the sign of the Turk's Head, and Jeremy Stave, the clark of the meeting-house, why, there an't one of 'um that's a single copper before a beggar, as the old saying is; but what o'that?

<P>As for your rewards, I'm above it, d'ye see: If I do it, I'll do it without fear or reward, as the saying is; but if you think fit, you may treat a body to the valuation of a mug or so. Don't you love ale? for they says how the Yorkers is cursed fellows for strong beer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a digression!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Humphry.</SPEAKER>
<P>I scorn your words—'tis no transgression at all to drink ale—Why Parson Thumpum himself drinks ale.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, will you carry the letter? You shall have as much strong beer when you come back as you can stagger under.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Humphry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, if I was for to have my beer a-board before I go, I shou'dn't get top-heavy, as the saying is; for I can carry as much weight in my head as e'er a he that wears a head, with∣out staggering.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frankton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I dare say you can; you have always plenty of that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Humphry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, you're right—I know what you mean; I've got it here a little, as old Mr. Scourage says. <STAGE>Exeunt Frankton and Loveyet.</STAGE> But as for what you said just now—no, no, Sir; I'll never foutre you, I warrant you—I always curses and swears in plain English, d'ye see—I—what's he gone? I hope he won't come back again for the sixth time; three times has he been in and out within the circumference of a minute. But I won't stay here no longer—I'll go and try if I can't find out where Doll lives, my old sweetheart; I an't so poor, but what I can buy her a ribbon or so; and, if all comes to all, I can get a new pair o'breeches too; for, to be sure, this one doesn't look quite so decent, and if that doesn't fetch her, the devil shall, as the old saying is. I'm cursedly afraid, I shan't be able to find out her quarters.</P>

<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> HARRIET, <HI>and</HI> MARIA.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, Maria, how were you entertained at the Assembly last night?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very indifferently, I assure you, my dear: You know, Harriet, I do most cordially hate dancing at any time; but what
<PB N="11" REF="021926_0011_0FB6144ED63B4CA8"/>
must one do with one's self these irksome, heavy, dreary Win∣ters? If it were not for cards, visits to and from, and—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Assemblies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, as my last resource, Assemblies, I should abso∣lutely be in a state of despair before Spring.—Then one may take an excursion on York or Long-Island—an agreeable sail on the East-river—a walk in the Broad-way, Pharisee like, to be seen of men, and—to see them—and then how refreshing to take a negligent stroll on the Battery, the Fort, the Mall, and from thence to Miss Such-a-one, then to Mrs. Such-a-one, then to Lady What's-her-name, and then home;—but now I am half of my time as motionless as Pitt's statue; as petrified and inani∣mate as an Egyptian mummy, or rather frozen snake, who crawls out of his hole now and then in this season to bask in the rays of the sun.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>And whenever the sun-shine of Mr. Frankton's eyes breaks upon you, you revive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Psha—I wish you had Mr. Frankton yourself, since you are so full of his sweet image.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'm sure you did not wish so last night: Your eyes seem'd to say,—I wish I could secure the good-for-nothing, agreeable rake.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, you <HI>heard</HI> my <HI>eyes</HI> say so, did you? I ask pardon of your penetration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>But do you really think the Winter is so destitute of comforts?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, comforts! by comforts I suppose you mean the sweets of domestic life—the large portion of comfort arising from a large winter fire, and the very pleasing tittle-tattle of an antiquated maiden aunt, or the equally pleasing (tho' less loqua∣cious) society of a husband, who, with a complaisance peculiar to husbands, responds—sometimes by a doubtful shrug, sometimes a stupid yawn, a lazy stretch, an unthinking stare, a clownish nod, a surly no, or interrogates you with a—humph? 'till bed time, when, heaven defend us! you are doom'd to be snor'd out of your wits 'till day-break, when—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold, Maria—what a catalogue of uncomfortable comforts have you ran over.—Pleasure and Comfort are words which imply the same thing with me; but in this enlighten'd age, when words are so curiously resin'd and desin'd, modern critics and fashionable word-mongers have, in the abundance of their wisdom, made a very nice distinction between them—for my part, I always endeavour to reconcile modish pleasure with real comfort, and custom with reason, as much as is any way
<PB N="12" REF="021926_0012_0FB614502FE3C400"/>
consistent with the obligation one is under to conform a little to the perverse notions of mankind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>There now!—You know I can't abide to hear you moralize—prithee, my dear Harriet, leave that to grey beards and long-ear'd caps—every thing is beautiful in its season, you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Common sense and propriety are ever in season, Maria, and I was going to mention a <HI>sentimental</HI> pleasure, a <HI>rational</HI> enjoyment, which is peculiar to the present <HI>season,</HI> tho' beautiful in every one, if you had not got frightened at the idea of being <HI>comforted.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my dear comfortable, rational, sentimental Harriet! Let me hear what this rational enjoyment of your's is?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hearing a good play, my dear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hearing a good play! why not seeing it, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because I believe plays are frequently seen, and not heard; at least, not as they ought to be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>I protest you are quite a critic, Harriet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you desire amusement, what so likely to beguile the heavy hours as Comedy? If your spirits are despress'd, what so replete with that which can revive them as the laughter-loving Thalia? If the foibles and vices of human nature ought to suffer correction, in what way can they be satiriz'd so happily and successfully as on the stage;—or if elegance of language, and refinement of sentiment—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Humph—there's sentiment again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet,</SPEAKER>
<P>You dislike every good thing I have mentioned this morning, Maria,—except one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's that, my dear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Frankton.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha. Why, to be sure, the good things of this life are not to be despis'd, and men are not the worst crea∣tures belonging to this life, nor Mr. Frankton the worst of men, but—apropos, about plays—did you observe how much I was affected the other night at the tragedy of Zara?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I really did not—I wish I had seen such a pleasing proof of your sensibility.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, you cruel creature!—wish to see your friend in tears?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis rather unusual to see a lady of your taste and spirit, either weep at a pathetic incident in tragedy, or laugh at a comic scene; and as for the gentlemen, your lads of spirit, such as are falsely called <HI>ladies' men,</HI> they are not so masculine as to understand, and therefore not so effeminate as to weep;
<PB N="13" REF="021926_0013_0FB61451B7D7F5A0"/>
tho' one would conclude, from their effeminacy in appearance and behaviour, that they would cry if you were to look at them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be sure, a little matter will draw tears from the feminine part of mankind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>For your part, you seem'd to be neither laughing nor crying, but rather displeas'd and uneasy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, you mistake the matter entirely, my dear; your skill in physiognomy is but indifferent, I find—why, after the tragedy was over, I laugh'd most inordinately for a considerable time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>On what account, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you must know, my dear, Mr. Frankton sat in the box opposite to the one I was in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I know your dear Mr. Frankton was in the opposite box.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Mr. Frankton! Did I say so? Why I could not say more of him, were he my husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you conform to custom, you would not say so much of a husband.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I did not say any such thing.—Says I, you must know, my dear Harriet,—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, there was no Harriet mentioned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I say there was—so, as I was going to tell you, you must know, my dear Harriet, that Mr. Frankton sat oppo∣site to me at the Theatre; and as he seem'd to be very much chagrin'd at the attention which was paid me by a couple of beaux, I took some pains to mortify him a little; for, tho' he strove to hide his uneasiness by chattering, and whispering, and tittering, and shewing his white teeth, his embarrassment was very visible under his affected unconcern.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>How exactly she has described her own situation and feelings! <STAGE>aside</STAGE>—I find that you acquire <HI>your skill in physiognomy</HI> from sympathy; or from making suitable comparisons, and drawing natural inferences from them; but now for the remainder of your pleasant anecdote, Maria.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, I was extremely civil to my two worshipping votaries, grinn'd when they did, and talk'd as much nonsense as either of them. During this scene of mock-gallantry, one of my love-sick swains elevated his eyes in a most languishing manner; and, clasping his sweet, unlucky hands together rather eagerly, my little dog <HI>Muff</HI> happen'd to be in the way, by which means my pet was squeez'd rather more than it lik'd, and my Adonis's finger bit by it so feelingly, that it would have
<PB N="14" REF="021926_0014_0FB61453441BC9D0"/>
delighted you to see how he twisted his soft features about, with the excruciating anguish. Ha, ha, ha.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha. Exceeding ludicrous indeed!—But pray, my dear careless, sprightly Maria, was you not a little nettled to see Mr. Frankton and his nymphs so great? And are you not deeply in love with each other, notwithstanding your coquetry at the Theatre, and his levity at the Assembly?—Yes, yes,—your aversion to the dancing last night was only pretence. I hope when your hearts are cemented by wedlock, you will both do better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>It will be well if I do no worse; but, to hear you talk, one would swear you were not in love yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Love is an amiable weakness, of which our sex are peculiarly susceptible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha; <HI>of which our sex are peculiarly susceptible</HI>—what an evasion!—and so my dear lovelorn, pensive, sentimen∣tal, romantic Harriet has never experienced that same <HI>amiable weakness</HI> which, it seems, the weaker sex is so susceptible of. But I won't teaze you about Mr. Loveyet any more; adieu.</P>
<STAGE>Going</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha; why in such sudden haste, my dear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have already made my visit longer than I intended, and I have plagu'd you enough now; adieu.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha, ha; that is laughable enough.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>LOVEYET.</SPEAKER>
<P>WHEN did you say you see her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frankton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Last night, in company with several other belles of no small note who did not look a tittle the handsomer for appearing at the same time with her, I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then she's as charming as ever.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frankton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Charming as ever! By all that's beautiful, a Sera∣phim is nothing to her! And as for Cherubims, when they compete with her.</P>
<L><HI>Conscious of her superior charms they stand,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And rival'd quite by such a beauteous piece</HI></L>
<L><HI>Of mortal composition; they, reluctant,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Hide their diminish'd heads.</HI></L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>You extol her in very rapturous strains, George—I hope you have not been smitten by her vast perfection, like the Cherubims.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frankton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am really enraptur'd with the bewitching little Goddess!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you positively think her so much superior to the generality of women?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frankton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most indubitably I do—don't you, pray?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought her handsome once—but—but—but you certainly are not in love with her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frankton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not I, faith. Ha, ha, ha. My enamorata and your's are two distinct persons, I assure you—and two such beau∣ties!—By all that's desirable, if there was only one more in the city who could vie with the lovely girls, and boast of the same elegantly proportioned forms; the same beauty, delicacy and symmetry of features; the same celestial complexion, in which the lily and carnation are equally excell'd; the same—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, monstrous! Why, they exceed all the God∣desses I ever heard of, by your account.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frankton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, if you had let me proceed, I should have told you that if one more like them could be found in town, they would make a more beautiful triple than the three renowned
<PB N="16" REF="021926_0016_0FB6145E79C8FFD0"/>
goddesses who were candidates for beauty and a golden apple long ago; but no matter now.—The account you have given of the lovely Harriet, has rekindled the flame she so early inspir'd me with, and I already feel myself all the lover; how then shall I feel, when I once more behold the dear maid, like the mother of mankind—"with grace in all her steps, heaven in her eye; in every gesture, dignity and love!"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frankton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay,—and what do you think of your father's sending for you to marry you to this same beautiful piece of mortality?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it possible! Then I am happy indeed! But this surpasses my most sanguine hopes!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frankton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you suppose he would object to the alliance then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not know,—my hope was only founded on the <HI>probability</HI> of his approving it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frankton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, I can now inform you that your hope has a better basis to rest on, and that there is as fair a prospect of its being shortly swallowed up in fruition as ever Cupid and Hymen presented to a happy mortal's view.—For your farther comfort, I have the pleasure to acquaint you, that Mr. Trueman is equally fond of the match.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Better and better—my dear George! You are the best of friends,—my happy genius! My very guardian angel!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frankton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well said, Heroics—come, spout away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I <HI>am</HI> happy, very happy, indeed: Moralists disparage this world too much,—there <HI>is</HI> such a thing as happi∣ness under the sun,—I <HI>feel</HI> it now most irrefragably,—<HI>here</HI> it vibrates in a most extatic manner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frankton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why you are positively the arrantest love-sick swain that ever had recourse to a philter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Profane heretic in love! Did not you extol the two Seraphims just now in the same generous language? But you have never experienced the blissful transition from doubt and solicitude to certainty and peace, as I do now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frankton.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you know that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I only conjecture so—Did you ever feel the same transports I do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frankton.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, in the name of sense, should I know how you feel?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Feel!—I feel that kind heaven, my friend, my father and my dearest girl, all conspire to bless me!</P>

<PB N="17" REF="021926_0017_0FB6145FF25E1E88"/>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, and a generous horse he is—he carries me very pleasantly, I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frankton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and, I dare say, could convey you more agree∣ably and speedily to <HI>Paradise</HI> than the Ass did Mahomet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha, ha. I think you have improved my idea.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frankton.</SPEAKER>
<P>To improve your reason, and check your strange delirium, I have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will talk more dispassionately;—but my heart <HI>will</HI> palpitate at the thought of meeting the lovely source of its joy, and the ultimatum of all its wishes!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frankton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose you know she lives with Mr. Friendly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>With Mr. Friendly!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frankton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, she is nearly related to his family, and as the stile in which they live, corresponds with her former prosperity better than the present ineligible situation of her father does, he has granted them her valuable company, after their repeated solicitations had prov'd the sincerity of their regard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how do you account for Mr. Trueman's po∣verty, since fortune has lately put it so much in Harriet's power to relieve him from it? I dare not think it arises from her want of filial regard; I do not know any thing so likely to abate the ardour of my attachment as a knowledge of that; but it is an ungenerous suggestion, unworthy the benignity and tenderness of the gentle Harriet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frankton.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is so.—Two things, on the part of the old gen∣tleman, are the cause: his pride will not suffer him to be the subject of a daughter's bounty; and his regard for that daugh∣ter's welfare, makes him fearful of being instrumental in im∣pairing her fortune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought the angelic girl could not be ungrateful to the parent of her being; but don't let us tarry—I am already on the wing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frankton.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are too sanguine; you must not expect to succeed without a little opposition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>How! what say you? pray be explicit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frankton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will remove your suspense.—There is a Mr. Worthnought, a thing by some people call'd a man, a beau, a fine gentleman, a smart fellow; and by others a coxcomb, a puppy, a baboon and an ass.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what of him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frankton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing; only he visits Miss Harriet frequently.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hah!—and does she countenance his addresses?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frankton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll explain.—He imagines she is fond of him, because she does not actually discard him; upon which presump∣tion
<PB N="18" REF="021926_0018_0FB61461B5856A80"/>
he titters, capers, vows, bows, talks scraps of French, and sings an amorous lay—with such an irresistably languishing air, that she cannot do less than compliment him—on the fineness of his voice, for instance; the smartness of his repartees, the bril∣liancy of his wit, the gaiety and vivacity of his temper, his genteel carriage, his handsome person, his winning address, his—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hah! you surely cannot be in earnest, Frankton.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frankton.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be serious then,—the sum total of the affair, I take to be this.—In order to kill a heavy hour, she sometimes suffers the fool to be in her company, because the extravagance of his behaviour, and the emptiness of his upper region furnish her with a good subject for ridicule; but <HI>your</HI> presence will soon make him dwindle into his primitive insignificance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>If your prediction proves false, Harriet will be false indeed;—but I must see her straitway.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frankton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think you go pretty well fraught with the fruits of our united deliberations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Deliberations!—away with the musty term—</P>
<L><HI>No caution need my willing foot-steps guide;—</HI></L>
<L><HI>When</HI> Love <HI>impels—what evil can betide?</HI></L>

<P>The old Constitution!—ha, ha, ha, ha. Super∣latively ludicrous and facetious, upon my erudition; and highly productive of risibility—ha, ha, ha. The old Constitution! A very shadow of a government—a perfect <HI>caput mortuum;</HI>—why, one of my school-boys would make a better; 'tis grown as superannuated, embecilitated, valetudinarianated, invalidated, enervated and dislocated as an old man of sixty odd.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>A consolidation and annihilation!—You certainly have bid defiance to the first rudiments of grammar, and sworn was against the whole body of Lexicographers. Mercy on me! If words are to be thus abus'd and perverted, there is an end of the four grand divisions of grammar at once: If consolidation and annihilation are to be us'd synonymously, there is a total annihilation of all the moods, tenses, genders, persons, nouns, pronouns, verbs, adverbs, substantives, conjunctions, interjections, prepositions, participles,— <STAGE>Coughs.</STAGE></P>

<P>Oh dear, oh dear,—what a wise man a School∣master is!</P>

<P>How can the States be consolidated and annihi∣lated too? If they are consolidated or compounded into one national mass, surely the individual States cannot be annihilated, for, if they were annihilated, where would be the States to compose a consolidation?—Did you ever study Logic, sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, but I've studied common sense tho', and that tells me I am right, and consequently you are wrong; there, that's as good logic as your's.</P>

<P>Harkee, Mr. Loveyet, I will propound a problem to you. We will suppose there are two parallel lines drawn on this floor, which notwithstanding they may be very contiguous

to each other, and advance <HI>ad infinitum,</HI> can never approximate so near as to effect a junction, in which fundamental axiom all mathematicians profess a perfect congruity and acquiescence:—now, to elucidate the hypothesis a little, we will suppose here is one line; and we will further suppose here is another line. <STAGE>draws his cane over Loveyet's feet, which makes him jumb.</STAGE> Now we will suppose that line is you, and this line is compos'd, form'd, constituted, made up of discernment, political knowledge, public spirit, and true republicanism,—but, as I predicated antecedently, <HI>that</HI> line is you— <STAGE>striking his cane on Loveyet's feet.</STAGE> you must not forget <HI>that.</HI></P>

<P>S'death, sir, do you mean to make a mathematical instrument of me, to try experiments with?</P>

There, sir—in this argument, you have a major, a minor and a conclusion, consonant to the received principles of logic.</P>

<P>My dear Harriet, I am rejoic'd to find you at home;—I this minute heard something, which I knew would make you happy; and that, I trust, is a good excuse for troubling you twice to day with my company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>You wrong my friendship, Maria, if you think you can oblige me too often with your desirable company; 'tis true I was wishing for a little cessation of that torrent of formal visitors which is pouring in from morning 'till night; but far be it from Harriet to reckon her Maria among that number.</P>

<P>You are very good, my dear; but you must give me leave to be an little jealous that I am not the only one who is favored with such a preference.</P>

<P>Your discernment must be very subtle, if you know all that is in my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>I only judge of your heart, by your tongue; and the abundance of the former is generally inferred from the speech of the latter.—Yes, yes—that constant, hypocritical heart of your's is now throbbing with love, hope, curiosity, and—a thousand speechless sensations, the improper subject of which, I do not hesitate to declare, is odious man; and that man, the accomplished Mr. Loveyet.</P>

<P>Well, well, it shall not be serv'd like Tantalus any more: <HI>he</HI> was doom'd to behold; and, beholding, to wish and languish for the tempting draught, in vain: but a better doom awaits the happy Harriet;—what <HI>she</HI> desires is not thus inter∣dicted, but will soon be obtain'd, and—</P>

<P>Ha, ha; you are a droll girl.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>But my time is precious; I am just going to the widow Affable's:—about twelve months ago she paid me a visit, when, agreeably to the form in such cases made and provided, she beg'd I would be more sociable, and she would take it so kindly of me:—accordingly I shall step in <HI>en passant,</HI> to shew her my sociability and kindness, which I shall, perhaps, repeat at the end of another year.</P>

<P>How can you be so cruel? The pleasure I experience in your society, makes me regret that any one should be deprived of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is very strange:—I should imagine, if you priz'd my company so much, you would wish me to withold it from others; because, the more I bless them with my presence, the less will come to your share, you know, my dear;—nor is it easy to conceive how you could be so found of my sweet person, without being jealous at the partiality of others;—but, after all, good people, they say, are scarce; and my humble admirers shall find the saying verified in me; because they are not fully sensible of my superior value; but, since your prove the contrary, by extolling my conversation and friendship so much, I likewise shall observe a contrary conduct, and indulge you with a <HI>tête à téte</HI> frequently, my dear.—But I have fifty places to call at

<P>Your unexpected appearance, and the unaccountable circumstance which attends it, have discomposed me in such a manner, that I cannot express, as I wish, how happy I am in your safe arrival.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthnought.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hah,—happy in his arrival! If so, she will not be very happy in his rival, I'm afraid.</P>

<P>I will explain the occasion of my charmer's fright immediately;—at present I can only tell you that your wou'd-be lover, here—</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>My lover!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>So he confidently call'd himself, and took such other insufferably vain and impudent freedoms with your name, that I attempted to give him a little wholesome admonition with this, if his effeminate cries had not brought my lovely Harriet in to prevent me; but the very attempt has proved him to be the basest of dastards. <STAGE>While he is saying this, Worthnought makes several attempts to interrupt him.</STAGE></P>

<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>To Worthnought.</STAGE> I am equally surpriz'd and incens'd, sir, that you would dare to take such freedoms with my name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be assured, Miss Harriet, if you condescend to grant your valuable company to such superficial gentry, they will ever prove themselves as unworthy of it as he has; but your goodness does not let you suspect the use which such characters
<PB N="36" REF="021926_0036_0FB614990350DC98"/>
make of the intimacy they are honor'd with, or you would spurn their unmeaning flattery, and ridiculous fopperies, with indig∣nation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I ever 'till now consider'd him as a respectful, well∣meaning person, as far as regarded myself; and as such, gave him a prudent share of my civilities; but I never thought either his intellects or his person sufficient to entitle him to a partial intimacy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthnought.</SPEAKER>
<P>You cannot deny, madam, that I have repea∣tedly experienced the most flattering proofs of your partiality, that a lady (who values her reputation) can ever bestow on her admirer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Contemptible thing! An admirer, forsooth! Of what?—Your ideas are too mean and frothy to let you admire any thing but my dress, or some other trifle as empty and su∣perficial as the trifler I am speaking to. My demeanour towards you was nothing but the effect of chearfulness and politeness; qualities which, I believe, are inherent in me, and of which, therefore, all with whom I am acquainted are the objects; but your present unmanly and insupportably impudent discourse, makes me despise myself almost as much as you, for allowing such a wretch even that small degree of attention which he so illy deserved.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthnought.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very insulting, madam, 'pan hanor.—</P>

<SPEAKER>Worthnought.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is only a trick to conceal your incon∣stancy during his absence; but it is the nature of the sex to deceive us.</P>

<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis the nature of a fool to say so; and if that fool does not instantly quit the subject and the house together, I must request the favour of Mr. Loveyet to make him.</P>

<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>"As matters are circumstanced, Mr. Worthnought, I think it is not worth your while to stay."</P>

<P>Her unparallel'd rudeness shall not compel me to leave the house, 'till I please.</P>

<P>"Oh, fie, sir,—you would not force a lady to give you her company against her inclination."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthnought.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very fond of echoing my words, it seems.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, when I can apply them to your disappointment and disgrace.—"I am monstrously chagrin'd, sir, 'foregad, that I have it not in my power to introduce you to the divine mistress of my heart." Ha, ha, ha.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthnought.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and she shall soon pay for her duplicity; tho' I would not have you think that her ill usage mortifies me in the least: I never was in love with her, nor did I ever intend marriage, which is more than <HI>she</HI> can say; and, I believe, it is fortunate for us both, that you arriv'd when you did, or some∣thing might have happened, which would have obliged me to marry her, merely to prevent her from being miserable.—Ha, ha, ha.

<P>By my body, here is rare work going on.— <STAGE>Aside.</STAGE>—well, madam, as the gentleman is your <HI>very particular friend;</HI> and as his <HI>love</HI>—friendship, I mean, is so great, that you dare to entrust all your secrets with him. I shall acquaint you, that, as you and my son have long entertained a partiality for each other, and being desirous to fulfil all my engagements, as well as to make him happy, I have wrote for him to come and conclude the marriage; but, for very good reasons, I have this day determined to forbid the bans; and Mr. Trueman says, he is very willing too.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is necessary you should be made acquainted with some of his oddities: his most striking peculiarity is a desire to be thought younger than he is; and, I dare say, some remark of my father, respecting his age, is the only cause of his present ill humor.</P>

—an event which we fondly expected would be attended with the most pleasing circumstances.</P>

<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Those fond expectations, my lovely partner in trou∣ble, shall soon be realized;—this is only the momentary caprice of old age.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must take care not to talk of <HI>age,</HI> before him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my fair monitor; I shall think of that: and now permit me, in my turn, to give you a little advice.—In the first place, I would have you go to your father—fall at his feet—clasp your fair hands, thus—beseeching him in such terms as that gentle heart is so well form'd to dictate, and persuading him with the all-prevailing music of that tuneful voice, to recall his rigorous intention, nor doom such angelic goodness and beauty to despair, by persisting to oppose an alliance which alone can make you blest; and without which, the most faithful of lovers will be rendered the most wretched one on earth. I shall take a similar method with my old gentleman, and I think I can insure myself success.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is all very fine; but—to have the voluntary consent of the parent one loves,—how infinitely more agreeable▪ I would not offend mine, for the world; and yet—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet you will be obliged to offend him, by having me, egh?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Psha;—how strangely you misconstrue my meaning: I was going to observe, that I expect his obstinacy and pride will prove invincible, in spite of all the rhetoric you are pleased to ascribe to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then we will employ a little rhetoric, against which another class of fathers are not quite so invincible.—Parsons are plenty, you know; and Gold and Silver are persuasive little words. <HI>Love</HI> inspires me with the spirit of prophecy, and tells me, I shall soon with propriety call the loveliest of her sex, mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very eloquent, Mr. Loveyet: I do not think the subject merits so many florid speeches.</P>

<P>A challenge! Surely the old blockhead would not make himself so ridiculous.</P>

<SPEAKER>Humphry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, it's for that;—I remember he said you call'd him a blockhead.</P>

<P>You may go and tell him I advise him to relinquish his knight-errand project, or I will expose his absurdity by taking the advantage which the law offers in such cases.</P>

<P>That is, you'll take the law of him, if he goes for to fight you.</P>

<P>Fight me!—Oh, grovelling idea! Wit-forsaken progeny of a more than soporific pericranium! Fight me!—Hear and be astonished, Oh Cicero, Demosthenes, Socrates, Plato, Seneca, Aristotle,—</P>

<P>Oh, for shame!—Do you read Haristotle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be it known to thee, thou monstrous mass of ignorance, if such an uninformed clod, dull and heavy as that element to which it must trace its origin, can comprehend these very obvious and palpable truths, expressed in the most plain, simple, easy, unscholastic diction.—I repeat again, that you may apprehend me with the greater perspicuity and facility,—be it known to thee, that those immaculate sages would have died rather than have used such an expression; by the dignity of my profession, they would:—'tis true that the ancients had such things as single combats among the Olympic games, and they were always performed by the populace; but such a fight, alias a tilt, a tournament, a wrestle, could not, according to the rule
<PB N="41" REF="021926_0041_0FB614A827039C20"/>
of right, and the eternal fitness and aptitude of things, be pro∣perly denominated a <HI>bona fide</HI> sight; for, as I before observed, it was <HI>ipso facto,</HI> a game, an Olympic game.—Olympic, from Olympus.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Humphry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray now, Mr. Schoolmaster, if a body mought be so bold, what do you think of the last war? Does your School∣mastership think how that was a fona bide fight?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are immensely illiterate; but I will reply to your interrogatory.—My opinion of the late war, is as follows, to wit.—<HI>Imprimis.</HI> The Americans were wise, brave and vir∣tuous to struggle for that liberty, independence and happiness, which the new government will now render secure.—<HI>Item.</HI> The Americans were prodigious fortunate to obtain the said liberty, independence and happiness. A war, encounter, combat, or, if you please, fight like this, is great and glorious; it will immortalize the name of the renowned WASHINGTON,—more than that of Cincinnatus, Achilles, Aeneas, Alexander the Great, Scipio, Gustavus Vassa, Mark Anthony, Kouli Khan, Caesar or Pompey.</P>

<P>He talks Greek like a Trojan.—Tempora mores;—I suppose how that's as much as to say, it was the temper of the Moors, that's the nigers, for to be call'd Caesar and Pompey.—I guess how he can give me the exclamation of that plaguy word.—Con—let me see <STAGE>Spells it in the manner he did before.</STAGE>—Please your worshipful reverence, Mr. Schoolmaster, what's Latin for Constitution?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>To tell you what is Latin for Constitution, will not make you a particle the wiser; I will therefore explain it in the vernacular tongue.—Constitution then, in its primary, abstract, and true signification, is a concatenation or coacerva∣tion of simple, distinct parts, of various qualities or properties, united, compounded, or constituted in such a manner, as to form or compose a system or body, when viewed in its aggregate or general nature. In its common, or generally received, ac∣ceptation, it implies two things.—First, the nature, habit, dis∣position, organization or construction of the natural, corporeal, or animal system.—Secondly, a political system, or plan of government. This last definition, I apprehend, explains the Constitution you mean.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Humphry.</SPEAKER>
<P>Like enough, but I don't understand a single word you've been a talking about.</P>

<P>My dear Mr. Loveyet, compose yourself a little;—for heaven's sake, sir, consider;—your animal Constitution is not able to withstand the formidable opposition of my political one;—the shock is too great;—let me persuade you, sir; and as soon as nine States accede to the adoption of the new Con∣stitution, we will investigate the merits of the old.

<P>By what a feeble tenure does poor woman hold her character and peace of mind!—It is true, sir, that a woman's <HI>reputation</HI> is too frequently, with ruffian cruelty, blasted in the bud, without a cause; and that so effectually, that it seldom or never flourishes again; but let me remind <HI>you,</HI> sir, in the words of the poet, that—</P>

counterpoised by that imaginary good; otherwise the titles of Honorable and Excellent would be always significant of his Honor's or his Excellency's intrinsic worth:—a thing "devoutly to be wish'd," but unfortunately too seldom exemplified; for, as the dramatic muse elegantly says of money,—"Who steals my purse, steals trash."</P>
</SP>

<P>I deny it;—the dramatic muse, as you call him, was a fool:—trash indeed! Ha, ha, ha. Money trash! Ready Rhino trash! Golden, glittering, gingling money!—I'm sure he cou'dn't mean the hard stuff.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am happy I can so soon relieve you from it, sir. Young Mr. Loveyet arrived this morning; but, it seems, the old gentleman has entirely forgot him, during his long absence; and when he heard his father's resolution, in consequence of the dis∣pute he had with you, he did not think proper to make himself known. It was this which made him think me so culpable, that you hear he talks of marrying him to my friend Maria.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see into the mistake; but the worst construction the affair will admit, does not justify his using you so indecently; and if it were not for the more powerful consideration of a daughter's happiness, I would make him repent it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have ever found my honored, my only parent, both wise in concerting plans for that daughter's happiness, and good in executing them to the utmost of his ability; and, I dare say, he does not think, her alliance with Mr. Loveyet's son, will prove unfavorable to her happiness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Far from it, my child:—Your unusual good sense makes a common-place lecture unnecessary, Harriet; but beware of flattery and dissimulation; for the manners of the present age are so dissolute, that the young fellows of these degenerate days, think they cannot be fine gentlemen without being rakes, and—in short, rascals; for they make a merit even of debauching innocence:—indeed, that is scarcely to be wondered at, when so many of those who are called ladies of taste and fashion,
<PB N="47" REF="021926_0047_0FB614C2676ABE78"/>

<P>No, you look more like a dancing-master, a fight∣ing-master, or a play-actor, or some such flashy folks; but looks is nothing, for every body dresses alike now a days; like master, like man, as the old saying is; ecod, you can't tell a Congress man from a marchant's 'prentice, every body dresses so fine.</P>

<P>Ha, ha, ha,—he is pasitively a very eccentric baby, and there is a small tincture of a barbarous sart wit in what he says; but it wants an immensity of correction, an infini∣tude of polishing; he is a mere son of nature, every thing he says, is express'd in such a Gathic, uncouth, Anti-Chesterfieldian stile; and as for his dress, it is pasitively most prepasterously clownish and original.</P>

<SPEAKER>Humphry.</SPEAKER>
<P>My proper sirname is Humphry Cubb; why our family is the most largest family within the circumroundibus of fifty miles, and the most grandest too, tho' I say it that shou'dn't say it; for my father's father's great-grand-father was a just-ass of the peace, when king George the third was a sucking baby, and therefore, as father says, a greater <HI>man</HI> then, than he was, ha, ha, ha. And his great aunt, by his mother's side, had the honor to be chief waiting woman to Mynheer Van Hard∣sprakencrampdejawmetlongname, the Dutch governor's public scratchetary; but I needn't go so far back neither, for I've got, at this present time, no less than two second cousins; one of 'em is soup-provider for the county, and t'other belongs to the liglislature, and both belonging to our family too;—both Cubbs.</P>

<P>Rise up my lad;—by my body, I am rejoic'd to see you;—you did take your father in a little, to be sure; but never mind it;—I'll take you in another way, perhaps.</P>

<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish you would take me in the matrimonial way, sir;—that would be a most agreeable take in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, we shall not disagree about that:—I am very happy this affair clears up Harriet's conduct so well; she is a fine girl, that's certain; and, if you love her as much as you formerly did, why—I don't know what I may not do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, sir, you make me unspeakably happy! If my Love is to be the condition of the welcome Bond, I do not care if it is executed to-morrow; for, were the penalty an age of love, I am sure I could pay it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>By my body, I'll have a wedding soon, and a merry one too:—I'll go and make it up with old Trueman;—but then he must not talk of the Constitution.—That's true, Charles, what government are you for, egh?—The old or the new?</P>

<P>Hah—the new Constitution!—A good-for-nothing, corrupted, aristocratic profligate!—But you shall not have her now; that is as fixed as fate.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, cruel event! How soon all my towering hopes fall prostrate in the dust!—Do, sir, try and think better of the matter;—I will promise to make myself think or do any thing you please, rather than have the double misfortune to offend my father, and lose my Harriet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Base foe to the liberties of his country!</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hah! do you dare?—Yes, he wants to provoke me still more;—to talk to me about my time of life! Why, I'm not old enough for your father, you great whelp you:—Ungracious young bastard,—to have the assurance to ridicule his father!—Out of my house, you 'scape-grace!</P>

<P>Unnatural usage for so trivial an offence!—But I obey you, sir: I'll remain no longer in the house of a father, who is so destitute of a father's feelings; and since I see you value my happiness so little, sir, I shall not think myself undu∣tiful, if I take some necessary steps to promote it myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Out of my house, I say!—Promote your own happiness, forsooth; did you ever know any one to be happy without money, you fool?—And what will you do, if I don't choose to give you any, egh?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>As well as I can:—I have a few of your unne∣cessary thousands in my hands, thank fortune;—I'll try if <HI>they</HI> will not befriend me, if their avaricious owner, and my unnatural parent will not.</P>
<STAGE>Aside, and exit.</STAGE>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>My time of life, indeed.—Provoking profligate!—I'll give Miss Airy all I'm worth, if she'll consent to have him;—the graceless fellow has us'd me so ill, that he shall be punish'd for it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>HARRIET, <HI>solus.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Notwithstanding the arrival of Charles, and the happy result of the interview with my father, my mind is not at ease;—these strange rumours must have some foundation;—one says he is married to Maria; another says, he is discovered to be illegiti∣mate; a third reports, he was found in company with a woman of ill same; and to conclude the catalogue of evil tidings, a fourth says, that old Mr. Loveyet is going to disinherit him, in consequence of his having made him a grandfather, since his arrival—But here he comes.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Young LOVEYET.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>She seems very thoughtful;—perhaps she too has been unfortunate in her suit to her father;—or, what is far worse, perhaps,—but I will not cherish such gloomy apprehensions.—Your servant, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Good day, Mr. Loveyet.—"Your servant, Madam!"—What a stoical salutation! I fear there is too much truth in what I have heard.</P>
<STAGE>Aside.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>You seem unusually serious, Miss Harriet: I hope Mr. Trueman has not proved relentless as you expected.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, sir; it gives me pleasure to acquaint you, my father was all kindness and forgiveness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish I could say so of mine;—he indeed was kind and forgiving too at first; but no sooner had I began to anti∣cipate approaching happiness, than one luckless circumstance deprived me of all that love and hope had inspired.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>An unlucky circumstance, indeed; but would the disappointment really be so great, if you were obliged to give up the thought of an alliance with me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, Miss Harriet! Give up the thought of having you!—BY heaven, it must be so!—Yes, the beau would never have presumed to say so much, if it were not so;—and Frankton's ambiguous account of them both, confirms the suspi∣cion;—and then the extravagant encomiums he bestowed on her yesterday.—Confusion! my fears were just, though he ridicul'd me for exposing them.—But she must not see my anxiety.</P>

<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>If my doubts are well founded, he must be an adept in the art of dissimulation. I will try him a little farther.— <STAGE>Aside.</STAGE>—What think you, Mr. Loveyet, of our New-York beauties? Have not the superior charms of so many fine women, been able to overcome such old-fashioned notions as constancy and priority of affection?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have beheld their beauty with equal pleasure and astonishment; and the understanding, the affability, and vivacity, by which strangers, with so much propriety, characterize my fair countrywomen, give them a pre-eminence over the ladies of most other countries, that is highly gratifying to a mind already so much attached to its native city, by the most endearing of all human ties;—they are all that the warmest, the most luxuriant fancy can wish; beautiful—almost beyond the possibility of an increase of charms; and—I had almost said, they furnish room for love and warm conceptions, "even to madness!"</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am in doubt no longer;—such passionate expres∣sions must have Love for their prompter.</P>
<STAGE>Aside.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>My friend Frankton extolled them highly; but his description derogates from their desort;—you too he praised;—I listened to him—with unspeakable delight, and believed him with all the ardor of faith and expectation; for I could readily believe that, which I had so often, so sweetly experienced;—but when you last blest my eyes with that enchanting form, how was the idea exceeded by the reality!—To do justice to <HI>such</HI> perfection, the praises I this minute bestowed on the ladies I have seen, would be spiritless and insufficient!—To charms like Miss Har∣riet's, what hermit could remain insensible!—<HI>I</HI> was not insensible;—the tender passion, I began so early to entertain; a passion, which length of absence and a succession of objects and events, had rendered too dormant, was then excited to sensations the most exquisitely sensible;—was then taught to glow with a flame, too fervent to be now suppressed!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were I but sure of his sincerity!</P>
<STAGE>Aside.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>With what indifference she hears me!—If she is so insensible to the genuine effusions of a heart like mine, I am lost indeed! But I will try a little deception to discover the truth. <STAGE>Aside.</STAGE>—What a lovely picture, Mr. Frankton drew of Miss Airy! But it was not too highly finished; for a thousand Loves and Graces have conspired, to make her the most accomplished of her sex.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>My pride shall not let him triumph over my cha∣grin. <STAGE>Aside.</STAGE>—I know Miss Airy to be as accomplished as you represent her, sir: and Mr. Frankton gave such a lovely
<PB N="58" REF="021926_0058_0FB614E36701BBA8"/>
description of her, you say;—I dare say he did;—oh,—yes—yes— <STAGE>Appears disconcerted, by striving to hide her concern.</STAGE>—he loves her to distraction;—Mr. Frankton has doubtless made a wise choice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>By all that's false, she is concerned at Frankton's having praised his mistress! She absolutely loves him!</P>
<STAGE>Aside.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you have seen the amiable Miss Airy, sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Forgive me, honor and veracity. <STAGE>Aside.</STAGE>—Yes, Miss Trueman; and not without a deep sense of her uncommon worth and beauty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I admire your discernment, sir;—Mr. Frankton too, is a very nice judge of female merit; and he cannot evince his judgment better, than by praising my friend Maria.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me, madam: with submission to your friend's merit, I think his panegyric would better apply to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>That compliment is too great, to be meant, I fancy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I rather think, you value the author of it so little, that you would as soon he should withold it, madam .</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, sir, when I have reason to think there is another who has a better right to it, and for whom it is secretly intended.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>You wrong me much, madam;—some tatling gossip or designing knave, has whispered some falsehood to my preju∣dice;—probably my <HI>rival,</HI>—Mr. Worthnought.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you have come here with a design to use me ill, sir, I beg you will tell me so, and then I shall act accordingly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your actions accord very illy with your <HI>professions,</HI> I think, madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Your</HI> duplicity, sir, both in word and action, justifies my retorting that ungenerous accusation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I entreat you to believe me, Miss Harriet, when I say, I am unconscious of having done any thing I ought to be ashamed of, since my arrival: I am so confident of this, that the circulation of a malicious rumor, however dishonorable to me, would give me little disquiet, did I not reflect, that it is the object of Harriet's credulity;—a reflection, that is the source of real unhappiness to me:—be kind then, Harriet, and tell me wherein I am guilty;—obscurity in a matter so interesting, gives more torture to the mind, than the most unwelcome truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>He must be sincere. <STAGE>Aside.</STAGE>—Your request shall be comply'd with, sir.—The principal offence you are charged with, is your having been smitten by the lady, on whom you have bestowed such liberal commendation;—be that as it may,
<PB N="59" REF="021926_0059_0FB614E4B3095690"/>
I heard Mr. Loveyet talk of such a match:—I believe it will require a more able advocate than yourself, to defend <HI>this</HI> cause.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Suppose I assure you, on the sacred honor of a gentleman, that what you have heard is false;—suppose I add the more important sanction of an oath, to seal the truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will save you that trouble:—you have an advocate <HI>here,</HI> which has already gained your cause.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Harriet, you are too good!—Conscious as I am of the rectitude of my conduct, as it respects my Harriet;—sure as I am of not deserving your displeasure, I still feel myself unworthy of such matchless goodness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>You say too much; and compel me to tell you that you merit my highest esteem.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Esteem! What a cold epithet!—And am not I entitled to something more than <HI>esteem?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Excuse the poverty of the expression; and be assured, my heart dictated a more exalted word;—let this confession atone for the fault.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet I would fain attract your esteem too; for, I have heard connoisseurs in the science of love say, it is possible to <HI>love</HI> an object, and that to distraction, without having a par∣ticle of <HI>esteem</HI> for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have assured you that <HI>my</HI> esteem is at least equalled by a more passionate affection:—but how strangely you talk!—First you acknowledge yourself unworthy of my favor;—then you are alarmed that I should only esteem you; and when I talk of a passion, superior to mere <HI>Platonic</HI> love, you are afraid, on the other hand, it is a blind, enthusiastic impulse, not founded on <HI>esteem.</HI>—How inconsistent are lovers!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your reasoning, like your person, surprizes, charms and subdues:—I will be more consistent;—but our contention is only for pre-eminence in love;—delightful emulation! Agree∣able inconsistency!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am now ashamed of my childish suspicions; but I should not have been so credulous, had it not been for an affec∣tion, which rendered my better judgment blind to the fallacy, and made me more apprehensive of your inconstancy, than satis∣fied of your innocence; and this disposed me to misinterpret every thing you said.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>And your apparent indifference, in consequence of that misinterpretation, excited similar suspicions in me; and thus, mutual distrust produced mutual misapprehension.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you have not told me the particulars of your interview with old Mr. Loveyet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="60" REF="021926_0060_0FB614E63A643248"/>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were you to hear those particulars, they would only afford you pain:—'tis sufficient for me to tell you he has turned me out of his house, only because I told him, I was a friend to the new Constitution, forsooth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is a strange character:—when I call'd on my father, I was alarmed to find them at high words;—and he abus'd <HI>me</HI> most unmercifully.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>He did? 'Tis well for him he has call'd himself my father;—but if my Harriet consents, I will immediately put myself in a situation that will justify my preventing his future ill usage:—Fortune has enable me to act independent either of his frown or his favor:—I have taken such measures, in conse∣quence of his base usage, as will guard us against the effects of the one, without obliging us to cringe for the other.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am happy to hear it; but affluence is not my object, nor poverty my dread; and I am happy I can convince you how little I desire an alliance for interest, by now tendering you the whole of my trifling fortune, in case your father should deprive you of yours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Charming Harriet! Miracle of disinterested love! Thus let me evince my gratitude.</P>
<STAGE>Kneels, and kisses her hand.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray do not worship me, Mr. Loveyet; I am less generous than you imagine;—self-love is at the bottom of this noble declaration; for if I did not suppose you capable of mak∣ing me happier than any other man, I would keep both my fortune and my person, to myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Better and better!—Your explanation gives me new reason to adore such uncommon worth, and makes me blest beyond measure! By heaven, New-York does not contain such a fortunate fellow!</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> FRANKTON.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>Seeing Frankton.</STAGE>—Ha, ha. You could not say more, if you were addressing my friend Maria.</P>

<P><HI>You</HI> talked enough of her perfections just now, for both of us.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frankton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope Miss Trueman will excuse my coming in so abruptly:—I have been looking for Mr. Loveyet, all over the city; at last I concluded, I might find him here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really, sir; and pray, what made you conclude so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="61" REF="021926_0061_0FB614EBBA7C4E28"/>
<SPEAKER>Frankton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought it was within the compass of probability, madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps it was the lady you wanted to see so much, Frankton;—that <HI>she</HI> might be here, was certainly within the compass of probability.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frankton.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had I then known what I have discovered since, I should have looked for you at some place not very distant from the lady, whose perfections you have been contemplating with so much admiration; for by Miss Harriet's account, you have seen her, perhaps more than once.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I saw her yesterday, and was charmed with her beauty.—Whenever I am betrayed into one falsehood, I am obliged to support it with twenty more.</P>

<P>It is really so, sir;—he was enraptured with her idea just now.—I fear your friend is your rival, sir.</P>

<P>And I fear my friend is my rival, madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Nay, what cause have you, for <HI>such</HI> a fear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>About as good as you have, my dear.—I am glad you came in when you did, Frankton; for you must know, we have had certain mutual doubts and jealousies; in consequence of which, a little ill-natured altercation, otherwise called love, ensued: a small foretaste of conjugal felicity; but the short-liv'd storm soon subsided, and a reconciliation made all calm again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frankton.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have something to say to you in private, Love∣yet. <STAGE>Aside to Loveyet.</STAGE>—I am sorry to deprive you of Mr. Loveyet's company, Madam; but I trust you will excuse me, when I tell you I have particular business with him</P>

<SPEAKER>Harriet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Farewel.—I wish he had look'd for you a little far∣ther, before he had taken you away.—There are so many capti∣vating objects in the city, (as he has already seen and declared) and dissipation abounds so much among us, that who knows, if he is now sincere, how long he will remain so;—and how long after marriage:—"Ah, there's the rub."—Well, matrimony will put his constancy to the test, that's one comfort;—it is a hazardous expedient, but it is a certain one.</P>

<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>By my body, I am as merry as a cricket;—an't you, Maria? For my part, I feel so well pleased, I could find in my heart to—to do as you have done; <STAGE>to Charles</STAGE>—cou'dn't you, my love?</P>
<STAGE>To Maria.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, sir,</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, you dear little rogue! With whom, egh, with whom?—Don't be bashful,—tell them.—I know she means me.</P>
<STAGE>Aside</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg to be excused from telling that, sir; but I will tell you who it is I would <HI>not</HI> have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, that's him.— <STAGE>Aside, looking at Frankton.</STAGE>—Well, who is it you won't have, Maria, who is it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>You, sir.</P>
<STAGE>Emphatically.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Me, egh?—me—me, Maria?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Preposterous infatuation!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>D—'d, wanton, treacherous jilt!</P>
<STAGE>Walks about discomposed.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have jilted yourself, sir;—nothing but excess of dotage and self-conceit could have let you impose on yourself in such a manner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frankton.</SPEAKER>
<P>And may I then hope—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Maria.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hope?—Oh, yes, sir;—you have my permission to <HI>hope</HI> for any thing you please.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you, madam, the disposition to gratify his hopes, I fancy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fancy you lie, sir; and you sha'n't have Harriet, for your impertinence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Excuse me father;—it is not in your power to prevent that;—the happy deed is already executed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Zounds! that's true!—and, what is still worse, the other deed is executed too.—Fire and fury▪ All is lost, for the sake of that inveigling, perfidious young Syren. Ugh, ugh, ugh.</P>

<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>Burlesquing what Loveyet has said in a former Scene.</STAGE>—"'Sdeath, sir! I tell you I am but two and forty years old: she sha'n't be more than thirty odd, sir; and she shall be ten

years younger than I am too.—A man of five and forty, old, forsooth!" Ha, ha, ha.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Loveyet.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perdition! Is this what I have come to at last?—Despis'd,—betray'd,—laugh'd at,—supplanted by a puppy,— <STAGE>Pointing to Frankton.</STAGE>—trick'd out of my money by a grace∣less, aristocratic son,—I—I'll—I'll go hang myself.</P>
<STAGE>Exit in a passion.</STAGE>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Humphry.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is, for all the world, like the show I see t'other night, at the Play-house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>His agitation of mind distresses me: my happiness is not complete, while it is enjoyed at the expence of a father's:—painful reflection!—We will go immediately, Harriet, and endeavour to pacify him.</P>
</SP>

<L><HI>His conduct shall instruct the hoary Sage,</HI></L>
<L><HI>That youth and beauty were not meant for age;</HI></L>
<L><HI>His rage, resentment, av'rice, dotage, pride,</HI></L>
<L><HI>(Sad view of human nature's frailest side!)</HI></L>
<L><HI>Shall mend us all;—but chiefly</HI> I <HI>shall prove,</HI></L>
<L><HI>That</HI> all his Politics, <HI>can never match my</HI> LOVE.</L>
