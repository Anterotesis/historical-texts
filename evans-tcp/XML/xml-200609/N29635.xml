<HEAD>May 28th. 1706. To my Worthy Friend, Mr. James Bayley, Living (if Living) in Roxbury, A POEM.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>MY Old Companion! and my Friend!</L>
<L>I cannot Come, and therefore send.</L>
<L>Some pity should be shown to One</L>
<L>That's heavy laden with the Stone;</L>
<L>That's wearied out with fits of pain</L>
<L>Returning like Clouds after Rain.</L>
<L>Alas! my Brother, what can I</L>
<L>Do for thee, more than Pray and Cry,</L>
<L>To Counsel, and to comfort try,</L>
<L>And bear a part by Sympathy?</L>
<L>Excuse me, though I Write in Verse,</L>
<L>It's usual on a Dead mans Hearse:</L>
<L>Thou many a Death hast under-gone,</L>
<L>And Elegies made of thine own.</L>
<L>Our Saviours Funeral Obsequies,</L>
<L>One Celebrates before His eyes;</L>
<L>And He the Oyntment kindly takes,</L>
<L>That for His Burial she makes.</L>
<L>Two Saints array'd in glorious dress,</L>
<L>Appear, and talk of His Decease;</L>
<L>Whose Death from thine did take the Sting,</L>
<L>And wholsome make that Poyson thing.</L>
<L>And I have seen thine hand, and Pen,</L>
<L>Play on that Cockatrices den</L>
<L>In measur'd Lines, as if inspir'd,</L>
<L>And <HI>Paroxisms</HI> had only fir'd</L>
<L>An holy Soul with flaming zeal,</L>
<L>That flesh-pains it could scarcely feel.</L>
<L>What, in one breath, both Live and Dye,</L>
<L>Groan, Laugh, Sigh, Smile, Cry, Versifie?</L>
<L>Is this the Stone? are these the pains</L>
<L>Of that Disease that plagues the Reins?</L>
<L>That slyly steals into the bladder?</L>
<L>Then bites, and stings like to the Adder.</L>
<L>Is this the Scourge of Studious men?</L>
<L>That leaves unwhipt scarce five of ten</L>
<L>And Whips them once, and over again.</L>
<L>In Christs School there's smart Discipline,</L>
<L>To make His Scholars more divine;</L>
<L>Blest they who do not take offence,</L>
<L>Whose joy lyes in the Future Tense;</L>
<L>Who when they are in most distress,</L>
<L>Love Christ the more, and not the less.</L>
<L>His Yoke is easy, burthen light,</L>
<L>To them that understand things right;</L>
<L>And none will afterward complain,</L>
<L>Who Hell escape, and Heaven obtain.</L>
<L>Well! if this Stone should do its worst,</L>
<L>It cannot make thee be accurst:</L>
<L>For if thou shouldst be Ston'd to Death,</L>
<L>And this way Pelted out of Breath,</L>
<L>Thou wilt like <HI>Stephen</HI> fall asleep,</L>
<L>And free from pain for ever keep.</L>
<L>Great Pains, with as great Patience, may</L>
<L>Fall little short of <HI>Martyrs</HI> Pay:</L>
<L>For Christs Rewards are all of Grace,</L>
<L>No Merit but His, in either case.</L>
<L>Our Lord thee good Example offer'd,</L>
<L>Who learn'd Obedience while He suffer'd,</L>
<L>Who for the joy was set before Him,</L>
<L>Endur'd the Cross He bore, and bore Him,</L>
<L>Who though He Pray'd it might be gone,</L>
<L>Yet also said, Thy will be done.</L>
<L>That Stone which builders did refuse,</L>
<L>For thy Foundation choose, and use.</L>
<L>Think also when thine Agonies</L>
<L>Are most intense, and force loud cryes;</L>
<L>They are not worthy to compare</L>
<L>With those that Christ for thee did bear:</L>
<L>Yea, think what Christ for thee hath done,</L>
<L>Who took an harder, heavyer Stone</L>
<L>Out of thine <HI>Heart;</HI> and it is gone.</L>
<L>Who did thy Wounded <HI>Spirit</HI> cure</L>
<L>Of Soul-pains, that none can endure,</L>
<L>And this is easyer to be borne,</L>
<L>For in the <HI>Flesh</HI> abides this thorne:</L>
<L>And if Christ do not it remove,</L>
<L>Sufficient is His Grace, and Love,</L>
<L>To give thee comfort, and Support,</L>
<L>Because this pain is light, and short;</L>
<L>And works for thee the Glory great,</L>
<L>That doth exceed in length, and weight.</L>
<L>Besides, these Torments cant compare,</L>
<L>With Torments that <HI>Eternal</HI> are:</L>
<L>For they are utterly undone,</L>
<L>That rowl the <HI>Sisypean</HI> Stone;</L>
<L>Not they whose pains are limited,</L>
<L>And are releas'd, as soon as dead.</L>
<L>Add one thought more; that this distress</L>
<L>Makes thee partake of <HI>Holiness:</HI></L>
<L>The more the flesh is hack'd, and hew'd,</L>
<L>The more Corruption is subdu'd.</L>
<L><HI>Life</HI> is to thee the less endear'd,</L>
<L>And <HI>Death</HI> by <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is the less fear'd:</L>
<L>For it's but once thou hast to dye,</L>
<L>And then Live to Eternity.</L>
<L>Thy weary Body shall have Rest,</L>
<L>Thy Soul from thence forth shall be blest;</L>
<L>Thy dust be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; for Christ shall find it,</L>
<L>And leave thi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cruel Stone behind it.</L>
<L>One Stone Gold's truth doth bring to light;</L>
<L>Another makes Iron sharp, and bright:</L>
<L>A third our grain doth Pulverize,</L>
<L>And Separate the chaff likewise.</L>
<L>Thine, all these profits bring to thee,</L>
<L>In nobler sense than th' other three.</L>
<L>Thine proves thy Grace to be Sincere;</L>
<L>Of rust, and dulness, doth thee clear.</L>
<L>And makes thee Watch, and Pray, and long</L>
<L>To change thy groans, for <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Song.</L>
<L>Though grinding pains thy nature bruise,</L>
<L>They fit thee for thy Masters use:</L>
<L>And when thy dust shall be resin'd;</L>
<L>Thou shalt be neither pain'd, nor pin'd;</L>
<L>Nor full of petrifying juice,</L>
<L>Hard Studies, Heats, and Colds produce.</L>
<L>Then shall hid Manna be thy fare,</L>
<L>In which no gritt, nor gravel are;</L>
<L>Yea, Christ will give thee a <HI>White Stone,</HI></L>
<L>With a <HI>New Name</HI> engrav'd thereon,</L>
<L>To the Enjoyer only Known.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lord, once thou saidst, Arise and Walk;</L>
<L>Thy Words Were Works; Mine are but Ta<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></L>
<L>Be pleas'd to bid thy son, Good chear!</L>
<L>And say, Thy Sins forgiven are!</L>
<L>Then, Sink, or Swim; or Live, or Die,</L>
<L>He will thee greatly Glorifie.</L>
<L>Say so to me too, so will I.</L>
<L>A Man of Sorrow once Thou wast,</L>
<L>And still a fellow-feeling hast,</L>
<L>So to Thy Pity, I commend</L>
<L>My self, and my afflicted Friend!</L>
