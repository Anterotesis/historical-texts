<P>Be not offended, my dear master, I am an old grey headed servant, who look'd anxiously on, when you were baptized—you grew up, but always lov'd to be a∣lone;—when the neighbous' children played, you some∣times, through good nature, mingled in their sports—but then you look'd just as you do now—though never austere—you understand me?</P>

<P>Ah! my dear master—the garden is my para∣dise—my father—God bless him—plann'd the garden—there was I born and bred—and a couple of years ex∣cepted—which, through love of the art, I pass'd in Holland—I have scarce moved a step from the gate—my hand prunes each fruit tree—and what my arms can now scarcely span—I remember a tender sapling—Be∣hind yon meadow is a grass plat—it is hardly noticed—by the garden wall stands a few birch trees—where in the evening I smoke my pipe.</P>

<HEAD>SCENE IX. MINNA and HUGEL.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minna.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, this is a challenge in due form.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hugel.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it appears.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="39" REF="037749_0037_100EFFA50830BDA0"/>
<SPEAKER>Minna.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you do not go?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hugel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because I already know thro' experience—that on foot there is no overtaking him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minna.</SPEAKER>
<P>It would be comical for you to fight about Abelard.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hugel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Men have often cut one another's throats, for objects equally insignificant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minna.</SPEAKER>
<P>And have been chronicled as martyrs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hugel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Presumption is also a passion—and our passi∣ons are frequently but a stimulus, to be roused by oppo∣sition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minna.</SPEAKER>
<P>This should not be acknowledged to us girls.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hugel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minna.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because it might make our sex mistrust the love of your's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hugel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did I then mention love?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minna.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is not love also a passion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hugel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not true love—which enables our existence, and becomes the innate impulse to all that is good and great.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minna.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt—whether this definition would suit the taste of my sex?—We are but too fond to excite passions—and to make philosophy ridiculous, reason, crown'd with fool's cap, kneeling at the feet of beauty—an engaging picture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hugel.</SPEAKER>
<P>But only in water colours—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minna.</SPEAKER>
<P>Girls are seldom judges.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hugel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor will they be judges—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minna.</SPEAKER>
<P>Detraction, my good Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hugel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish you were open to demonstration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minna.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have demonstration at heart, but men in our heads.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hugel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heart and head, should promote a friendly in∣tercourse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minna.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! Such an intercourse were too tedious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hugel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Or marry!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minna.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wedlock would be yet more tedious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hugel.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are not serious—but I am confident that at your golden wedding, you will defend holy matrimo∣ny, with all the animation of youth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="40" REF="037749_0038_100EFFA6EEF69540"/>
<SPEAKER>Minna.</SPEAKER>
<P>At my golden wedding! heaven forbid!—to survive that, I must at latest marry to-morrow.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hugel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which must wholly depend upon yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minna.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon me?—comical enough!—as if it de∣pended on one's self to resolve, to day I will give away my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hugel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not?—as easy as to declare, to-day my ear shall not be shut against the poor beggar—to-day, I will comfort the unfortunate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minna.</SPEAKER>
<P>My sagacious Sir—you over-rate the worth of a maiden's heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hugel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I only alluded to your own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minna.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which I conjecture—you cannot compre∣hend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hugel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I! not comprehend your heart?—then must the sweet remembrance of my childhood be obliterated!—whither are flown those happy times—when your fa∣ther resided on his estate—and lived in friendly inter∣course with mine—when each fine summer evening, as∣sembled us children in the village—you beckon'd me kindly from afar—and called me, thou, and Augustus!—when suddenly, the frolicksome Minna vanish'd from our sports—to share her penny with a beggar—or to as∣sist a fallen child—When she industriously gather'd the strawberries for her father—or selected flowers to cele∣brate her mother's birth-day.—O! Minna! Minna—I—not know your heart?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minna.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>(distrait)</HI> Those were happy hours!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hugel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Blest with innocence and peace of mind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minna.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing can be compar'd with the enchant∣ment of our early youth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hugel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Except it be the charm of first love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>The one as transitory as the other.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hugel.</SPEAKER>
<P>A random observation from the great world.—in cities every thing is painted—landscapes upon can∣vas—health upon the cheeks—and love upon the stage—in cities, words are appreciated by fashion—in the country, they flow from feeling—in cities they say, your obedient servant—in the country, good day:—the first is politeness—the second heartiness:—I love you, exclaims

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minna.</SPEAKER>
<P>I now hear for the first time, that you are also a poet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hugel.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>(drooping)</HI> O! my throbbing heart!—thy sensibility is misconstrued into fiction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minna.</SPEAKER>
<P>I begin to fear thee—romance is infectious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hugel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Romance—I have been but too much inur'd to hear the genuine taste for love and nature thus abus'd—I therefore rivetted my heart—and threw not the key into the ocean of the world—but treasur'd it, as unfold∣ing the ideas of my hopes and wishes—I wish'd to dis∣cover the female, to whom the unpresuming youth was more deserving than the pert coxcomb—who, at a gala ball—would not pass with a contemptuous leer, the rus∣tic noble—because unpractised in the dance—and who, at the sumptuous board, did not mistake silence for dull∣ness:—Ah! I thought to have found her—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minna.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>(in a soft hesitating tone)</HI> And were mis∣taken!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hugel.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>(with enthusiasm)</HI> No, no—I am not mista∣ken!—This tender inquietude manifests your beautiful soul—yes, I often rejoic'd to behold, amidst the bustle of the world, your lovely countenance, clouded with listlessness and <HI>ennui</HI>—that where your heart was not in∣terested, you could display your judgment.—O! fly these baneful circles, which oppose bulwarks against reason—card-houses against licentiousness—where those style themselves friends, who dissipate one another's time; where one is familiariz'd to love—by calculating that together the revenues suffice to fit up a house—where the possessor is reputed generous, if, on a Sunday afternoon, he distributes twelve-pence among a dozen
<PB N="42" REF="037749_0040_100EFFAAD19D4318"/>
poor—and he is esteemed pious, thro' forbearance to talk of his religion, from the fear of being bewildered and misled—where the honest fellow inwardly despises the powerful scoundrel, to whom he is compelled to pay obeisance—where we compassionate the distress'd whilst shuffling the cards—and by the third trick have utterly forgotten them:—in short, where egotism mingles with interest—fear produces meanness—and the habitude of vice masks its deformity. Fly from this pestiferous atmosphere to rural scenes, where every noble feeling is excited—there is the heart unfolded to the good and beautiful—there, love and friendship are not visitors, but residents—God is honor'd, when with wondering transport we view the starry heaven—We give to the poor to relieve their wants—vanity mingles not her ostentatious gifts, among the precious contributions of benevolence—there is mirth without cards, and con∣versation without detraction—one is not ashamed to esteem oppressed worth, and loudly to proclaim, a scroundrel—a scroundrel. O! I possess only a slender patrimony—but, if to all the blessings which industry, fortune, and my heart bestow upon me, Minna designs to contribute love—my little paradise will only want a ridge of lofty rocks, to make it impenetrable to envy.—You are silent.—The lively Minna casts down her eyes, and contemplates the flowers in her bosom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minna.</SPEAKER>
<P>Methinks Herr von Hugel, it is a proof of my esteem for you—that, at this instant, my levity for∣sakes me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hugel.</SPEAKER>
<P>your esteem is my pride, but only love gives bliss.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minna.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ere I answer you, confess to me sincerely.—what proportion does my figure hold in your love?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hugel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sincerely, my best Minna—I have never examin'd myself, as to that point.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minna.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then do it now—it materially interests me to know it:—Should I, think you, have engag'd your affections, had I been ugly and deform'd?—I appeal to your honor and honesty, for a faithful answer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hugel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, why should I disavow an impres∣sion, which youth and beauty produce in every well
<PB N="43" REF="037749_0041_100EFFACF9CE4F30"/>
organiz'd frame:—I shou'd love you, even were you plain—but whether I should have so clearly recogniz'd your soul, concealed in such unseemliness, I cannot venture to pronounce.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minna.</SPEAKER>
<P>And supposing the small-pox should suddenly disfigure me, or if I be not what I seem?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hugel.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a supposition?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minna.</SPEAKER>
<P>Girls are skilful in concealing their imper∣fections.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hugel.</SPEAKER>
<P>My life upon the venture.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minna.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall venture nothing—she, who will de∣ceive an honest man, cannot deserve his love—<HI>(she takes his hand)</HI> I—Herr von Hugel, highly esteem you—something more perhaps—but—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hugel.</SPEAKER>
<P>No but.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minna.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess to you—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hugel.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>(trembling)</HI> That your heart is engaged?</P>

<P>Yes, yes, I will answer you soon, though not now:—this waltz—it delights me—come, come along, and let us dance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hugel.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is out of my power at present to dance.</P>

<P>Indeed!—the music is so inviting—you will not then?—excuse me Herr von Hugel, I must look out for a partner.</P>

<P>ABUNDANCE of eating and drinking—a peal of laughter—but no pure enjoyment:—he who laughs with all his might, is not of course always happy—one laughs at his own wit, and if he be rich, or powerful, the circle is constrained to join in chorus—another laughs at a <HI>double entendre,</HI> of his own painful invention, and ogles the ladies around to enjoy their confusion—here titters a gosling, to disguise an auk ward timidity—and there leers an ape, because his neighbour's tail is a hair too long:—here is a good soul of a mother relating her offspring's display of genius, and compelling her yawning hearers to join in the admiration—yonder, is a sketch discussing, from the magazine of scandal, and a malignant smile blasts the opening bud—when they re∣turn home, says his Excellency to her Excellency, what a delicious party—how heartily we have laugh'd:—No; this is not after my way—the most rational among the groupe, seems to be the Counsellor's lady—a canary bird among bullfinches—warbling to them, till they imitate a tune or two—if sometimes her wild notes escape her, they are lovely melodious tones;—could she but know how her husband is chagrined—but patience—she shall learn it.

<P>You excite my curiosity more and more:—I be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eech you Captain, don't count me among the formal beings who screw up their mouths at a truism, because it is somewhat bitter;—our acquaintance is yet young—but were I slumbering on a bed of roses, and a stranger preserved me from a viper's sting, this stranger would become my friend.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Erlach.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you think thus—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Flax.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, I think thus:—to please my husband is my most earnest wish—to be sure the differ∣ence in our ages is considerable, and I did not fall into his arms thro' love, but was some how surpriz'd into them thro' esteem:—we have not acted a romance to∣gether—no light'ning has inflamed, but a chearing marriage sun has constantly animated us: be you then animated to speak confidently—but, notwithstanding
<PB N="47" REF="037749_0045_100EFFB62593B870"/>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Erlach.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bravo!—that is my way, those who think thus, I esteem highly—and to those I esteem highly, I speak the truth.</P>

<SPEAKER>Erlach.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can a woman with such an excellent head and heart, endure so many fools about her:</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Flax.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alas! dear Captain—should we banish fools—our circles would become very circumscrib'd.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Erlach.</SPEAKER>
<P>The smaller the better—sense and sociability are guests who disappear if they behold lights at every window.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Flax.</SPEAKER>
<P>But folly lends good sense a foil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>What?</P>

<P>Jealous!—you joke!</P>

<P>Should I for example assure you, that last night he never closed an eye—that his imagination kept him on the rack till morning—that he was oblig'd to force himself away, when he heard your carriage draw up.</P>

<P>I am all astonishment!</P>

<P>My God!—why did he not say so to me?</P>

<P>False shame—the demon of confidence.</P>

<P>Well, I have hitherto left our company to a chance medley—in future, he shall have the se∣lection—he shall be my constant companion—this very

<P>Not so:—there are here many worthy, sensible characters.</P>
</SP>

—it is no weakness—it is the soul's softness—and it chiefly depends upon you to mould it into goodness—but you conceive that female love ill accords with truth—you require health and soundness of soul, and yet poison it with flattery:—but I am complaining and arguing, where I should be acting—your hand, dear Captain, you shall witness and acknowledge that I merit your confi∣dence.</P>

<P>Humbled!—that is a hard expression.</P>

<P>The occasion was harder than the expression—she, who treats a serious proposal, as a jest—she, whose levity hurries a man with the tears of love in his eyes to a dance—let me say, does not that imply contempt?</P>

<P>Dear Herr von Hugel—beware of an intem∣perate judgment—you may repent at Minna's feet:—Do you make no allowance for a poor girl's embarrass∣ment?—I assure you, that most of the follies of which we are accused towards your sex—arise from embarass∣ment—how, if Minna was heartily well disposed to you?—but only shy of a certain confession, which she fear∣ed, might in the eyes of the lover, diminish the worth of the beloved.</P>

<P>Forgive me brother: forgive me, my good parents: often when I gathered resolution to surmount my shame, fate threw insurmountable difficulties in my way—I hastened with my husband from hence to his birth-place—Lyons—his parents were exasperated, they had other objects in view for him, and rejected us—
<PB N="58" REF="037749_0056_100EFFCD01D0C860"/>

<P>Ah, William, do not ask: it pleased heaven to punish me for the sorrow, I had occasioned my pa∣rents.—the war in which America contended for her independence, reduced us to poverty—we returned to Europe eight years since—we found only my husband's mother living—but she soon after died—we enjoyed a momentary repose till the terrible revolution destroyed our tranquility—my husband became a zealous patriot, and fell a sacrifice to avarice and anarchy—my son, mis∣guided young man, emigrated with some young dissi∣pated noblesse—Alas! they have but too well succeed∣ed, in having fashioned him into a vain self-conceited coxcomb, and eradicated every sense of nature and filial duty—I blush to own—he was the first who met me near the city gates.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flax.</SPEAKER>
<P>This city?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moreau.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, he is here—I recogniz'd him—not a glimmering of doubt remains to comfort me—with a groupe of riotous companions he rode past me:—my son! I exclaimed, and fell on my knees—he knew my voice—he threw a hasty look at me—I saw the blood rushing to his cheeks—the bridle trembled in his hand.—I heard one of the set enquire, who is that?—I stretch'd out my arms and sighed, I am his mother!—alas! he was ashamed of his kneeling parent.—The good woman, has lost her senses, said he, and gave his horse the spur.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emma.</SPEAKER>
<P>The lamented child, whom a gallant soldier rescued from the smoaking ruins, is named Amelia Mo∣reau—it is her who delighted in your martial apparel—and since she could think and feel, has adored her noble∣minded deliverer. The man who rais'd me from the ashes, acted bravely, but peradventure, many a one in the same predicament, would have saved the weeping child from death, and abandon'd it afterwards to its fate;—but the man, who during eight years, has shar'd with me his slender appointment—O! for him, thanks are a poor return.—Praise and fame may reward heroic deeds, but the noblest actions are not always the most brilliant—a great sacrifice is more easily accomplished in one hour, than a thousand small sweet courtesies, du∣ring the space of eight years.</P>

<P>No, you do not understand me!—If my af∣fections were entangled, I would sighing confess—generous man, pitty me, I cannot love you:—but thanks to God, my heart is unfettered—esteem and good will, friedship and gratitude—yes, these sensations are com∣bined into one, and that one is love.</P>

<SPEAKER>Erlach.</SPEAKER>
<P>My girl!—Is that thy earnest?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Emma.</SPEAKER>
<P>With an Erlach, no preciptancy need be fear'd, neither was your proposal utterly unexpected—the nipping coldness with which you left me, when I sought and found Herr von Hugel, intimated to me, what perhaps you scarcely yourself imagined;—my heart throbb'd high at the idea, to recompense my bene∣factor, and the life which he preserved, to devote to the happiness of his life;—these flattering ideas excited hopes, wishes—and now dear Captain—without affec∣tation—without false shame:—if a heart, full of inno∣cence—a grateful confidence—and the endeavour to de∣serve you, can suffice, I shall most willingly become your bride.</P>
</SP>

<P><HI>(Seizes overjoyed her hand)</HI> Girl! girl! what dost thou make of me? I could fall on my knees be∣fore thee, had I not so often fondled thee on my knee—here then stand I—would fain speak and cannot—and falter before a being, who, eight years ago, was no taller than this rose-bush;—but one word for all, thou art my wife, my dearest wife!—Why, let them laugh—ha, ha, ha! I too will laugh—see here, see here, and disguise your envy under feign'd smiles—go your way—she is mine!—Erlach returns to his country, and the alps shall reverberate his shouts—for never was his heart so full of ecstacy.—<HI>(Eagerly and playfully he takes her hand under his arm)</HI> Yes, my good girl, we will buy us a farm, an alpine cot, with the friendly sun-beams sporting on our soil, where aromatic roots exhale health, and the wild roses carelessly bloom like thy cheeks—
<PB N="68" REF="037749_0066_100EFFE2460D9F20"/>

<PB N="75" REF="037749_0073_100EFFF042A79890"/>
Whilst complying with thy desire abroad, evil dreams haunted thee at home—but thou wast ashamed of them, and that was false shame:—Man and wife should not even conceal their dreams from one another—a look would have been enough—I might perhaps have indulged a little laugh against thee—but should most cheerfully have offered a worthless sacrifice to thy peace of mind. Oh! how many a marriage union is destroyed, because the band of confidence was not tied heart to heart. How oft the torch of discord becomes unextinguishable, be∣cause husband or wife smothered the first spark.</P>

<P>I forgive thee, but upon one condition—that thou wilt be pleased, henceforward, not to move a step without me; when thou writest, I will set by thee with my work-bag—and when thou hast finished, we will continue together.</P>

<P>Instead of punishing, thou art rewarding me, my love.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Flax.</SPEAKER>
<P>O!—I have now thought of a punish∣ment:—thou preferrest the town, but I think the coun∣try most engaging—only once within three years, have we visited our farm—that is unnatural—and as a penance thou must linger there with me the whole summer.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Flax.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank God, for sending him to my salva∣tion—without him, I should have been hurried to perdi∣tion, and awoke too late!—Thou wicked man!—that again was thy fault, the want of confidence;—in thy opinion, women were incapable of estimating the value of a worthy man, unless his hands were ever loaded with presents, like the subjects of an Eastern Potentate. Learn to know us better—a wife is prouder in an esti∣mable husband, than in a pair of diamond ear-rings—and prefers going unnoticed on foot, possessing her hus∣band's affection, than without it, attracting the eyes of a gaoing croud, in a dazzling phaeton.</P>

Oh!—how many an establashment falls to ruin, because the husband is ashamed to disclose to his wife, the true state of his circumstances—my experience this day, has so innately convinced me of this melancholy truth, that were I now standing before a numerous assembly, I should extend my arms, and glowing with philanthro∣py, should address each father of family—Trust thy wife—thou totterest perchance on the brink of an abyss—confidence may save thee—banish false shame, this monster of vanity and arrogance!—trust thy wife, thy truest friend!—and thou wilt be rewarded with consola∣tion for the past, with advice and assistance for the future.</P>

<P>I ought to be ashamed, that a woman of five-and-twenty, should instruct a man of any mature years:—but this were again false shame▪ which shall be for ever banished from my bosom:—from this moment, thou like God, shall behold my heart's inmost thoughts—even

<P>Bury!—the enjoyment of nature and one's self, men call burying—well then, the nightingales shall chaunt our requiem.</P>

<P>My dear Caroline, thou art not familiariz'd with solitude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Flax.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thro' conjugal affection, the wife adopts another mode of life, with the same facility she changes a fashion:—I few years since, I fancied only a large <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at cou'd become me, and the hats were never large enough to my mind—I now think this fashion frightful, and am only pleased with myself in the smallest hat—Thus will it be in this case—four weeks in the country, and a city life will appear like a large hat—and I never shall be able to comprehend how I could endure myself in it.</P>
