<P>Unless I have my tea and toast as soon as I rise in the morning—I am ill for the day. I have been ac∣customed, these fifty years, to breakfast the moment I rise; and it does not look well, daughter, when an old blind woman is obliged to wait hours for a little hot water.</P>

<SPEAKER>Moth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well; it is prudently done! When I was married, my late husband and I were very poor, indeed; and when my Robert, your husband, was born I put myself to many, many, little inconveniencies, that my child might want nothing. Now, it is your turn to make these sacrifices. When children are small, the mother should forego many of her wishes, to provide for their wants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arab.</SPEAKER>
<P>We do, with the utmost pleasure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not take this amiss, daughter; but, I must say, that, for some time past, great disorder has prevailed in this house. Something or other is always wanting. I am blind; I cannot see—'tis true. Yet I can discern more than gives me pleasure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>My Robert, you know, has met with misfortunes in trade.</P>

<P>He has, child; but no merchant is always fortunate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P><STAGE>(<HI>Aside with a sigh</HI>)</STAGE>
Ah, that you had spoken the truth!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moth.</SPEAKER>
<P>His property was great: and though a part be lost, his mother's breakfast should not be wanting. I know my son: he will never forget, that, at the risk of my health <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> supplied him myself with his first food. I was then sickly; yet I had no wet nurse for him. And I am confident, he would rather deprive himself of some∣thing, than suffer his old blind mother to want.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arab.</SPEAKER>
<P>He does deny himself, to supply you, mother.</P>

<P>Yes, daughter, I should deserve censure myself, were I to be silent. I am old and blind: work I cannot▪ but I must speak my mind; do not take it amiss.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your parental admonitions shall be ever dear to me; even when they wound my heart.</P>

<P>You know, when my son married you, I did not greatly approve of your union.</P>

<P>I was poor.</P>

<P>Has, during eight years, a word dropped from my lips, like a reproach on that head?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arab.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, dear good mother, never!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, I had been better satisfied, had you possessed some fortune; but then I always said to myself, love goes a great way. My late husband, poor man, at first, had no property, nor had I; but we were very hap∣py. My son is a rich man, through our industry: for God's sake! let him chuse as his heart directs! if the young woman is poor, she will be grateful, and the more readily nurse me when I am old. I want but little; but that lit∣tle I ought not to be at the trouble of asking for. She will always have it ready, before I open my lips.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surely, it has always been my most earnest wish—</P>

<SPEAKER>Moth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, daughter, it has been—<HI>it has been</HI>—but it is no more. Every thing has of late taken a most singu∣lar turn, and grows worse daily. Old people are a little difficult, and are fond of order. What to young people seems the effect of caprice, often is indispensably neces∣sary to the old. The variety of youthful enjoyments is so great, that some may well be spared: but old age is confined to so few enjoyments, that it can ill afford to lose any. And yet, daughter,
<STAGE>(with a tone of increasing animation)</STAGE>
I will rather suffer want myself, than that my poor little grandson be neglected: this goes to my very soul! You are his mother: You may love him dearly, very dearly indeed! but I am his grandmother, and love him still more.

Will you forgive me, dear mother; I al∣ways made it my business, you know, to wash your cup myself: and I always did it, with the utmost care—but yesterday—somehow—I know not how—I broke your cup.</P>

<P>Broke it!—Well, well, daughter, my old heart will also break at last!—I say it, once more: things grow worse every day. The bible is gone; the child's play∣thing is carried off; and now my cup is broken!—Son, son, if thy poor father could know it—Remember his last words—"May my blessing be converted into a curse, should your mother ever complain of you!"—Now, I do not complain; I will not convert thy father's blessing in∣to a curse; I will suffer, and not complain! Come, Har∣ry, lead me into my room; ride about on thy hobby-horse, and be as noisy as thou wilt, that my heart, and the conscience of thy parents may be stunned to rest.

<P>I do not understand you, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Demp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why; we account to each other, with the strictest honour, for whatever we earn; one, for instance, plays at Brookes's—another at White's:—and they share the winnings equally between them, without the conceal∣ment of a single shilling.</P>

<P>Very well, Sir! But what is this to me?—</P>

<P><STAGE>(Smiling)</STAGE>
Do not dissemble,—Pray, don't:— I have long observed you.—There is, among us, a novice whom we dislike:—he who now holds the cards.—Your looks,—the air of bitter scorn, with which you more than once, viewed his blunders,—have convinced me, that I address myself to one who is master in our profes∣sion.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Max.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Demp.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do assure you, Sir, that you will find yourself in a company of honest good-humoured fellows; who look upon the whole world, as a large gambling house; in which every one banks his talents, and where no one loses but he who punts the cried-down coin of <HI>virtue.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Demp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sure, Sir, you jest?—You are, perhaps, al∣ready connected with a different company. If so, then
<STAGE>(<HI>Putting his fingers to his lips</HI>)</STAGE>
you can be silent! Brothers of a trade must not betray one another. But if you hesitate on another score; if you mistrust my character;—I would have you to know, Sir, that I am a man of known and undoubted honour. I am well received in all the first houses. My name is Baron Dempster. To-night I shall be at the Duchess's <HI>route</HI> in Pall-mall.

<P>True—I am myself a member of the Society—I have known the joy of restoring a husband to his wife, a son to his mother. I may say, in truth, that I was ever one of the most active members. My associates eagerly flew to attempt the recovery of my son. No means was left untried. For hours I hung over his breathless body, pressed his palid lips with mine, and employed every con∣ceivable art to rekindle the flame of life—in vain.—I kneeled till my knees were stiffened: till my voice was hoarse—I called on the God of mercy. God heard me not—No, he heard me not. I have lost my all. Nothing remains to me, but money, money, which I would give all away ten thousand times—to hear but once more the voice of my son, even as he called to me for the last time, "Father!"—from the stream—Go, sir, leave me, leave me alone! You have made me to open my lips to com∣plain!—And I had resolved not to complain!—You have brought, burning tears into my eyes!— and I had determined not to weep. No, my grief shall suffocate me in silence. And should you still talk of mis∣fortunes, after having thus seen the lacerated bleeding heart of a father, then, sir—then you are a common beg∣gar!

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Max.</SPEAKER>
<P>He wrongs me, cruelly wrongs me. But his heart is full. All his sensibilities are absorbed in the con∣templation of his own griefs. But, it is surely less miser∣able to see one's darling child lie dead before you—than to behold that child pine away by inches, and perish for hunger.—Time passes.—Once I could feel for the sufferings of others. The tale now whis∣tles by my ears, but cannot touch my writhing heart.</P>

Think over the matter by yourself. You are not the first man that has left a wife and a child. You will not be the last. Beware of losing an opportunity, such as may not, every day, recur to you. You will find me, every morning, at the Golden Anchor, near Grovenors-Square.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Max.</SPEAKER>
<P>O God! thou openest to me, a path of escape out of this maze of suffering—but, a path I cannot tread!—Leave Arabella!—Leave my mother, aged and blind!—No:—Never!
<STAGE>(<HI>He walks about wildly</HI>)</STAGE>
Are there no other means? Cannot I take a brush, and pre∣sent myself to clean people's shoes, as they pass? No honest shift that will supply bread to my family, can be disgraceful.
<STAGE>(Pauses)</STAGE>
Or, shall I follow the gambler, and make myself his accomplice in robbery? Would it be an unpardonable crime, to commit an act of rob∣bery—but <HI>for once</HI> in my life?—And this, to prevent all that is dear to me, from perishing for hunger?—No, Maxwell! think of the noble soul of thy wife! Do not wound her heart with worse than the pangs of death.
<STAGE>(<HI>Pauses again</HI>)</STAGE>
That gentleman was in the right: better, better far, to leave wife and child, than by my presence, to enhance their sufferings. Must <HI>they</HI> not live without <HI>me,</HI> because <HI>I</HI> cannot live without <HI>them?</HI> I will be gone: I will go to India. Fool! Will that give them bread? Oh! could I, but by any honest means, secure to them subsistence; I would set off for India, this moment. They might weep for my absence. But, if they had only bread to eat; what, though they should moisten it with their tears?
<STAGE>(<HI>Again a pause</HI>)</STAGE>
O God! thou who feedest the fowls of the air, who clothest the callow young in the nest!—pour but one ray of cheering light into my soul! Shew me only a protector for my wife!
<STAGE>(<HI>He gazes wildly around him</HI>)</STAGE>
Faces, every where,— human faces but, no men—no humanity!
<STAGE>(<HI>Shudders</HI>)</STAGE>
Ah! there! Walwyn comes.
<STAGE>(With a faint hollow voice)</STAGE>
Walwyn!
<STAGE>(<HI>Stops as if suddenly rooted to the ground, and pores with downcast eyes</HI>)</STAGE>
What was this? What darted through my brain? Oh—h—h! I shudder at the thought! Let me grasp thee, thou terrible stranger!— Thou wearest a hideous mask! Yet art, perhaps, destined
<PB N="32" REF="037759_0032_100F03BF9EF91F78"/>
the saviour of my wife. Stay! Let me accustom myself to thy view!
<STAGE>(pauses)</STAGE>
Well, and what matters it? Thou goest to India—art dead to Arabella—but, wilt live in her remembrance, while Harry lives—Thy blind and aged mother is provided for—Happy!
<STAGE>(<HI>deeply affected</HI>)</STAGE>
happy! Why not? Is she to be miserable, because I am so? Dost thou love her as dearly as she deserves?
<STAGE>(<HI>with mild dignity</HI>)</STAGE>
Well, then, true love is capable of sacrificing even itself.
<STAGE>(<HI>pauses</HI>)</STAGE>
No, it is not any malignant influence, imposing on my disordered fancy! This is the path which fate points out—the only one. No tenderness for my own feelings, shall draw me back.
<STAGE>(<HI>casts a look towards Walwyn</HI>)</STAGE>
Oh God! let me find him as I wish!—as I wish? No, as I am forced to wish!—</P>

<P>I do not. These lines

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Maxwell, since you know that I mean well, should you disdain my assistance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Max.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall not scruple to lay open my heart to you. It is not haughty disdain; it is self-torturing caprice— But my feelings are those of man; and I will not strive against them—Walwyn—of all human beings, you are the last, whose assistance I would accept.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Unreasonable caprice!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Max.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it caprice? can a man of such feelings name it so; when my whole heart revolts with horror, against the idea of assistance from you? My Arabella loved you— To assist us, would give you a degree of merit, in the eyes of my wife, which I could not patiently think of. Could I look upon her without shame and anguish, while her conscious looks might seem to tell me—that we were supported by the bounty of him, who was once, my rival in her love? Could I bear to reflect—could I suffer her to reflect, while I eat each meal—"This morsel we owe to Walwyn: but for his charity, we might starve?"—No, no, generous man, I should thank you, and—hate you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Maxwell, drive all such thoughts from your mind. Your misfortunes have disordered your imagination. What are a thousand pounds to me? Besides, it is but a loan. A man like you, must soon rise by industry and activity, above misfortune. You shall, at a future time, repay my money—with interest, if you will have it so.</P>

<P>And, to whose hand, should I then owe my resto∣ration from ruin?</P>

<P>Good God! Maxwell, what means this?—Your lips tremble—Your eyes roll—</P>

<P>You would force upon me a present of a thousand pounds—Will you not, in mercy, utter a few syllables to relieve my despair? Pity these agonies, this almost alien∣ation of mind, under which you behold me!—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Though I am at a loss to conceive, how my an∣swer can give you relief; yet your demand is so earnest and so singular, and my feelings are so pure and sanctified that I do not hesitate a moment to confess—I still love Arabella.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Max.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is your love but a pensive remembrance?—Or is it lively as the cherished dream of yesterday? have the colours of the picture faded?—or are they still bright and vivid?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wal.</SPEAKER>
<P>A man, who has for these eight years, studiously avoided all intercourse with you—a man who has relig∣iously respected the rights of the husband, and the virtue of the wife—may answer without hesitation;—I still love her, as on the first day I wished her mine! She was my all; she is so still; till death, she shall continue so!— I have now answered you, Maxwell. But, why would you urge the enquiry? Why strive to make old wounds bleed afresh, or inflict new ones?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Max.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have gained what I wished. The decisive mo∣ment is come.

<P>What is your meaning?</P>

<SP>

<P>Yes: these are the conditions. Give me, with the faith of a brother, your hand; and promise, that you will support my old blind mother, and will bear with the frailties of her humour; promise that you will form my

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Maxwell, whither does your imagination wan∣der?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Max.</SPEAKER>
<P>And lastly, you must pledge to me your solemn oath, that you will make Arabella happy! Vain fool! he has loved her these eight years, even while she was mine; as his own, he will adore her!—No, this oath is un∣necessary.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Recollect your bewildered senses,—Thou art beside thyself. Dost thou meditate suicide?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Max.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not; why should I anticipate the work of hunger or despair?—I am in my right senses, good Walwyn! I know what I am doing. For these three days I have in vain sought to find the means of earning subsistence for my family. I must either see them starve —or must beg or steal for them. At last, however, I have found a man who will supply sustenance to myself, if I chuse to go to India.</P>

<P>Dear Maxwell, your distresses have disor∣dered your mind. A mist swims before your fancy;— and through it, you see none but forms of horror. These are unreal visions. All will yet be cleared up. Confide in me. Call not that a favour, which I feel myself irre∣sistibly urged to give. If you are still obstinate in the re∣fusal of gratuitous assistance; let me call upon my friends; you shall not want for opportunities of earning bread for your family by your own exertion—the harder the exertion the better—if so, you will have it.</P>

Pardon, me for having hinted at what is no more to be mentioned.

<SPEAKER>Wal.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are imprinted on my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Walwyn, I said,—I love you. Fate unites me to another. Were you capable of asking me to tear this bond asunder;—did but one look of your's, invite me to it:—I should lose my last consolation—the con∣solation of loving and respecting you—On my hand you pronounced the vow of virtue.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which I have ever kept sacred.</P>

<SPEAKER>Arab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Holding your hand, I swore eternal fidelity to my husband. I, too, have kept my oath. I do not say I have found the task a hard one; No: I have found it easy; for, I possess a worthy man. For the first year, I might devote many a secret tear to the remembrance of the sweet dreams of younger years; yet these have been long assuaged by the new feelings of a mother's fondness.—Maxwell's wild fancy of this day, might perhaps have been to me less extravagant, <HI>before I was a mother.</HI> A childless pair might dare to part! But, now, Walwyn, now, no power on earth can break asun∣der the bonds of my duty,—No, not the power of love itself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not interrupted you: for, where I love, I delight to admire. The word escaped; but it came from the heart of a man who knows no wish of which
<PB N="51" REF="037759_0051_100F03E79E1D51F0"/>
he can need to be ashamed. Arabella misunderstood me. I listened to your husband, merely to gain time, to sooth the fever of his soul, to save him from the wild phrenzy of despair. His sufferings have awakened within him, powers hitherto unknown to himself, of which the new-born consciousness is pleasing. <HI>To sacrifice himself for his wife</HI>—is the splendid idea, on which he, at present, delights to gaze till his mind's eye becomes blind to every ray of other hope.—It is for this, that his pride devises so many refined pretensions for refusing the assitance of a friend. These would he scarce resign for the sake of the salvation of his family and himself; for resigning these,—he would lose the idol of his fancy, created by love, nutured by want and despair, raised by disordered nerves to be the tyrant of his soul.—He must be gently and softly led back from the precipice to which he is hurried. As to the night-walker,—we must not call him by his name, but, in silence stretch out our arms, that if he fall, he may sink on the bosom of a friend!</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pshaw, pshaw!—such things one don't like to be paid for. Besides, I can't say, after all, that it was I who saved him. For when I had laid him on the bank, he was as dead as a herring. But, there is a society in London, do you see, who will not let a brave fellow drown himself, without a struggle to save him. Some of them were quite at hand. Great gentlemen! God knows who! They instantly seized the body, and continued rub∣bing warming and blowing, till he opened his eyes.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Wal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whither did they carry him?</P>

<P>To the house of a rich wine-merchant, three doors from this.—He was the busiest of them all.—He belongs also to the society.

God's blessing on the worthy gentleman! When I perceived that life was again stirring in him, I had his house shewn me; for I am vastly fond of bringing good news.— That poor lady on the ground is his wife I dare say?</P>
