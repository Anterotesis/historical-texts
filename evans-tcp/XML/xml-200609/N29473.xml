<HEAD>TO FRIENDS, From a Yearly Meeting held at Philadelphia, the 4th of the 7th Moneth, 1689.</HEAD>
<P>BE<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the several Monethly &amp; Quarterly Meetings in <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West-Jarsey,</HI> and <HI>Pennsilvan<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, &amp;c.</HI> In the Gospel-fellowship and Unity of the Antient Truth, do we at this time salute you, and in much Love, Good will and God<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Care recommend unto you, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> before you the Consideration and due Regard of these <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, but wholsom Particulars:</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That in your respective Meetings, ye earnestly endeavour to continue and practise those useful Instructions and that good Order established among us in our Native Land, in reference to a Godly Life and an Honest Conver∣sation, that so (as far as in you lieth) the Holy Truth and Profession thereof may not suffer, or be evil spoken of, by the contrary Practises of any found among us; and that Misdemeanours and Miscarriages herein, may receive seasonable Admonitions, Reproof or Censure.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That Christian Watchfulness and Wisdom be used and e<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>cised in your Meetings towards all such who continue under a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> among you, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lk disorder∣ly, or are Unsavoury, and of a bad Report in their Callings, Stations or Neighbourhood; We request you, upon such, and the like Occasions, that when upon inquiry, or other∣wise, you hear or understand the same, ye do, with what convenient Expedition ye can, in tender Love, and in Brotherly and Sisterly Regard, acquaint them thereof, and by suitable Discourses and Proceedings, endeavour their Recovery, and that by such Means &amp; Instruments, which are most likely to be successful, and least to be objected against.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That in your next Meetings you do with since∣rity and diligence, take into your Fatherly and Motherly Consideration, the State and Condition of such who are scattered and gone astray from among you, and more espe∣cially of those who have not received the due Notice, and Gospel Order, which is to be expressed and given unto them. <HI>Dear Friends,</HI> Labour in the Spirit of Meekness, with the Bowels and Compassion of Truth, and in your measure, with the Wisdom which is from above, to possess them of the Danger and Insecurity of their State, and of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Uncertainly of the Ease and out-side Satisfaction which <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> seemingly attend, and flatter their Distance for <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> and that their continued Seperation from the Way <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>, in its Requirings, and from the Obedience of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> Cross of <HI>Christ Jesus,</HI> is like to end with great Re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> Tribulation and Anguish of Soul and Spirit. Be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> your selves, we earnestly entreat you, with a Godly Zeal and good Understanding therein, that the Witness of God may be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in them and your Proceedings may be well taken and spoken of. And tha<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> redeem any Re∣misness or Neglige<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> in Affairs of this Nature, in case any hath been, in your Meetings past, by your double Diligence for the future.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> That ye frequently and faithfully mind one another of the Virtuous and Christian Education of your Youth and Children, that they be bred up in Sobriety and in the for<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Sound Words, and sound Learning, according to the Holy Scriptures, and that they frequently read in the holy Scriptures, and abstain from reading or hearing read all unsound, unprofitable and hurtful Books, which are too common in the world; ye do hereby, besides the great Ad∣vantages received therewith by your Children, Transfer your Care, as Godly Parents, and as Exemplary Men and Women unto Posterity. And as both Worth, and a Blessing, frequently fall upon them who are brought up and trained in the Nurture and Way of Truth, so for your Love and Respect to the Requirings and Commandments of the Lord, and in teaching the same to your Children, you will receive the Reward of Peace, and the answer o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a good <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> in your having done your Duty in that respect here, and your Names will be continued in a worthy Remembrance hereafter.</P>
<P>So <HI>Dear Friends,</HI> These few Requisite Heads remaining weighty with us at present, We have thought good to send unto you, and to leave them with you to be made use of as ye shall see occasion and service, by the wisdom and direction of the good Spirit of Truth, well knowing (and we doubt not but the sence of the same is with you) That our holy Profession and Religious Assemblies greatly need to be strengthned, and accompanied with a Godly Life and Gospel Discipline, that so they may still continue both desirable to others, and savoury to such who are exer∣cised therein. And further, that the Way of the Lord ma∣nifested to us, for the Glory of his Name, and Salvation of our Souls, be with Godly Earnestness and Pious Endeavours made known and industriously recommended to our Chil∣dren, and they encouraged thereunto, and countenanced therein: so shall the Lord count us worthy of his heavenly Gifts, and faithful Dispensers of the same, Obedient also to the Righteous Requirings of God, and du<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y Respectful to the worthy and imitable Pattern of Godly Parents, and both just as well as dutiful to our Posterity.</P>
<P><HI>Having thus far cleared our Minds unto you, we bid you</HI> Farewell.</P>
<P>Its desired that this may be Read in all your Monethly and Quarterly Meetings.</P>
