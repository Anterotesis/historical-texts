<HEAD>NEW YEAR's VERSES Addressed to the Customers of The FREEMAN'S JOURNAL, By the Lad who carries it. JANUARY 8th, 1783.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>LET those who will, in hackney'd rhyme</L>
<L>And common cant, take up your time</L>
<L>And even the Muse's aid implore</L>
<L>To tell you what you knew before,</L>
<L>That days are <HI>short</HI> and nights are <HI>long,</HI></L>
<L>The weather <HI>cold</HI> and hunger <HI>strong.</HI></L>
<L>The markets <HI>high</HI>—and such like stuff—</L>
<L>I'm sure you know it well enough;—</L>
<L>Untaught by us, I dare to say</L>
<L>You hit, exactly, <HI>New Year's Day,</HI></L>
<L>And knew at least as well as we</L>
<L>The present year is eighty three;—</L>
<L>(Such simple things as these to tell</L>
<L>A mere drum head would do as well—)</L>
<L>All this I knew you knew before,</L>
<L>And therefore knock'd not at your door</L>
<L>Upon the individual day</L>
<L>When <HI>eighty three</HI> came into play,</L>
<L>With verses for the purpose plann'd</L>
<L>Bidding you gravely <HI>watch your sand,</HI></L>
<L>Since death is always near at hand;</L>
<L>All this I left to those whose trade is</L>
<L>To threaten beaus and frighten ladies,</L>
<L>And brought my papers, (swiftly speeding)</L>
<L>The <HI>Freeman's Journal,</HI> for your reading.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Unhappy <HI>Journal,</HI> doom'd by fate</L>
<L>To meet with unrelenting hate,</L>
<L>From those that can their venom spit</L>
<L>Yet condescend to steal your wit;</L>
<L>While <HI>Timon</HI> with malicious spirit</L>
<L>Allows you not a grain of merit,</L>
<L>While he an idle pomp assumes</L>
<L>Let him return his borrow'd plumes,</L>
<L>And you will find the insect creeping</L>
<L>With not a feather worth the keeping.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But this is neither here nor there,</L>
<L>May quarrels past dissolve in air;</L>
<L>In Stygian waves of sable hue</L>
<L>Be all absorb'd with EIGHTY TWO,</L>
<L>Or lost on Lethe's silent Shore</L>
<L>Disgrace our rising state no more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Another word I meant to say,</L>
<L>(Kind customers, have patience pray,</L>
<L>My subject is the New Year's day,)</L>
<L>How came it that mistaken man</L>
<L>Has thus inverted Nature's plan</L>
<L>And contradicted common reason</L>
<L>By making <HI>this</HI> the mirthful season,</L>
<L>When all is dreary dull and dead,</L>
<L>The sun to southern climates fled</L>
<L>To dart his fierce and downright beams</L>
<L>Intensely on Brazilian streams;</L>
<L>No daisies on the frozen plain,</L>
<L>No daffodils to please the swain,</L>
<L>The limpid wave compell'd to freeze</L>
<L>And not a leaf upon the trees!—</L>
<L>'Tis wrong—the very birds will say;</L>
<L>Their New Year is the bloom of May,</L>
<L>Then nature calls to soft delights,</L>
<L>And they obey as she invites.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And yet this <HI>happiness</HI> below,</L>
<L>Which all would gain but few know how,</L>
<L>Is not to <HI>time</HI> or place confin'd,</L>
<L>'Tis seated only in the mind;</L>
<L>Let Seasons vary as they will</L>
<L>Contentment leaves us happy still,</L>
<L>Makes life itself pass smooth away,</L>
<L><HI>Makes every hour a New Year's day.</HI></L>
