<HEAD>A POEM, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<L>ONCE more Bellona, forc'd upon the stage,</L>
<L>Inspires new fury, and awakes her rage,</L>
<L>From North to South her thun'dring trumpet spreads</L>
<L>Tumults, and war and death, and daring deeds,</L>
<L>What breast but kindles at the martial sound?</L>
<L>What heart but bleeds to feel it's country's wound?</L>
<L>For thee, blest freedom, to protect thy sway,</L>
<L>We rush undaunted to the bloody fray,</L>
<L>For thee, each province arms its vig'rous host,</L>
<L>Content to die, e'er freedom shall be lost.</L>
<L>Kind watchful power, on whose supreme command</L>
<L>The fate of monarchs, empires, worlds depend,</L>
<L>Grant, in a cause thy wisdom must approve,</L>
<L>Undaunted valour kindled from above,</L>
<L>Let not our souls descend to dastard fear,</L>
<L>Be valour, prudence both united here,</L>
<L>Now as of old thy mighty arm display,</L>
<L>Relieve the opprest, and saving power convey,</L>
<L>'Tis done, and see th'omnipotent befriends,</L>
<L>The sword of Gideon, and of God descends.</L>
<L>Ah, see with grief fair Massuchusetts plains,</L>
<L>The seat of war, and death's terrific scenes,</L>
<L>Where darling peace with smiling aspect stood,</L>
<L>Lo! the grim Soldier stalks in quest of blood:</L>
<L>What madness heaven, has made Britannia frown?</L>
<L>Who plans our schemes to pull Columbia <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot"><HI>Columbia, America sometimes so called, from Columbus the first discover.</HI></NOTE> down,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="014038_0004_0F92ABF622894F00"/>See Boston groan beneath the strong blockade,</L>
<L>Her freedom vanish'd, and destroy'd her trade,</L>
<L>Injur'd, opprest, no tyrant could exceed,</L>
<L>The cruel vengeance of so base a deed.</L>
<L>New Albion's sons <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><HI>New Albion, properly New England, but is often applied to all British America.</HI></NOTE> whom honest freedom moves</L>
<L>(My heart admires them, and my verse approves)</L>
<L>Tir'd of oppression in a Stuart's reign,</L>
<L>A Popish faction, ministerial train;</L>
<L>Bravely resolv'd to leave their native shore</L>
<L>And some new world they knew not where explore,</L>
<L>Far in the West, beyond where Poets said,</L>
<L>The Sun retir'd, and Cynthia went to bed,</L>
<L>Few then had seen the scarce discover'd Bourne,</L>
<L>From whence like death yet fewer did return:</L>
<L>Dire truths from thence the wand'ring sailor brought</L>
<L>Enlarg'd by terror, and the poer of thought,</L>
<L>With all the forms that pict'ring fancy gives,</L>
<L>With all the dread that in idea lives,</L>
<L>Fierce Cannibals that sought the blood of man,</L>
<L>Vast cruel tribes that through the desart ran,</L>
<L>Giants whose height transcends the tow'ring oak,</L>
<L>Brutes with whose screams the trembling forest shook</L>
<L>All these and more they held no cause of fear,</L>
<L>Since nought but slavery, dreadful could appear.</L>
<L>Ah see the day, distressful to the view,</L>
<L>Wives, husbands, fathers, bid a long adieu,</L>
<L>Dear native land, how heav'd the heavy sigh,</L>
<L>When thy last mountains vanish'd on the eye,</L>
<L>Then their frail barks, just enter'd on the sea,</L>
<L>Pursu'd the long uncomfortable way:</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="014038_0005_0F92ABF6F0A39578"/>But pitying heav'n the just design surveys,</L>
<L>Sends prosp'rous gales, and wafts them o'er the seas.</L>
<L>Behold the shore; no rising cities there,</L>
<L>To hail them welcome from the sea appear,</L>
<L>In the wild woods the exil'd host were spread,</L>
<L>The heavens their covering, and the earth their bed:</L>
<L>What expectations but a life of woe?</L>
<L>Unnumber'd Myriads of the savage foe,</L>
<L>Whose brutal fury rais'd, at once might sweep</L>
<L>The adventurers all to death's destructive sleep;</L>
<L>Yet 'midst this scene of horror and despair,</L>
<L>Stout industry began his office here,</L>
<L>Made forests bend beneath his sturdy stroke,</L>
<L>Made oxen groan beneath the sweaty yoke,</L>
<L>Till half the desart smil'd and look'd as gay</L>
<L>As northern gardens in the bloom of May.</L>
<L>But ah, review the sorrows interwove,</L>
<L>How the fierce native with the stranger strove;—</L>
<L>So heaven's bright lamp the all-reviving sun,</L>
<L>Just as his flaming journey is begun,</L>
<L>Mists, fogs and vapours, sprung from damps of night,</L>
<L>Mount up and strive to dim the approach of light;</L>
<L>But he in triumph darts his piercing ray,</L>
<L>Scatters their forces and pursues his way.</L>
<L>Oft when the husband did his labour leave</L>
<L>To meet his little family at eve,</L>
<L>Stretchd in their blood he saw each well known face,</L>
<L>His dear companion and his youthful race;</L>
<L>Perhaps the scalp with barbarous fury torn,</L>
<L>The visage mangled, and the babe unborn</L>
<L>Ripp'd from its dark abode, to view the sun,</L>
<L>Ere nature finish'd half she had begun.</L>
<L>And should we now when spread thro' ev'ry shore,</L>
<L>Submit to that our fathers shunn'd before?</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="014038_0006_0F92ABF798FC06D0"/>Should we, just heaven, our blood and labour spent,</L>
<L>Be slaves and minions to a parliament?</L>
<L>Perish the thought, nor may one wretch remain,</L>
<L>Who dares not fight and in our cause be slain;</L>
<L>The cause of freedom daunts the hireling foe,</L>
<L>And gives each Sampson's strength toward the blow,</L>
<L>And each, like him, whom fear nor force confines,</L>
<L>Destroys a thousand modern Philistines.</L>
<L>Who fights to take our liberty away,</L>
<L>Dead-hearted fights and falls an easy prey;</L>
<L>The cause, the cause, most cruel to enslave,</L>
<L>Disheartens thousands, and unmans the brave:</L>
<L>Who could have thought that Bri-ons bore a heart,</L>
<L>Or British troops to act so base a part?</L>
<L>Britons of old renown'd, can they descend,</L>
<L>T' enslave their brethren in a foreign land?</L>
<L>What oath, what oath, inform us if you can,</L>
<L>Binds them to act below the worth of man?</L>
<L>Can they whom half the world admires, can they</L>
<L>Be advocates for vile despotic sway?</L>
<L>Shall they to every shore and clime renown'd</L>
<L>Enforce those acts that tyranny did found?</L>
<L>'Yet sure if this be their resolv'd design,</L>
<L>'Conquer they shall where'er the sun doth shine▪</L>
<L>'No expedition prov'd unhappy yet,</L>
<L>'Can we Havanna's bloody siege forget,</L>
<L>'Where British cannon the strong fortress tore,</L>
<L>'And wing'd whole legions to its infernal shore</L>
<L>'Or does the voice of fame so soon forego</L>
<L>'Gibraltar's action, and the vanquish'd foe,</L>
<L>'Where art and nature both at once combin'd</L>
<L>'To baffle all our hardy troops design'd?—</L>
<L>'Yet there Britannia's arms successful sped,</L>
<L>'While haughty Spaniards trembled, felt and fled</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="014038_0007_0F92ABF86B5AADB8"/>So say the pension'd tools of slavery,</L>
<L>So say our traitors, but so say not I—</L>
<L>(Tories or traitors, call them which you choose,</L>
<L>Tories are rogues, and traitors imps broke lose)</L>
<L>But know ye few, the scandal of our land,</L>
<L>On whom returns the blood that we expend.</L>
<L>Those troops whose feats are told on every shore,</L>
<L>Here lose their spirit and are brave no more;</L>
<L>When armies fight to gain some cruel cause,</L>
<L>Establish tyrants or destructive laws.</L>
<L>True courage scorns to inspire the hateful crew,</L>
<L>Recall past fame, or spur them on to new;</L>
<L>Dark boding thoughts the heavy soul possess,</L>
<L>And ancient valour turns to cowardice.</L>
<L>Dark was the prospect, gloomy was the scene,</L>
<L>When traitors join'd to break our union chain:</L>
<L>But soon by heaven inspir'd arose the cry,</L>
<L>Freedom or death, unite, unite or die.</L>
<L>Now far and wide a manly spirit reigns,</L>
<L>From Canada to Georgia's sun burnt plains;</L>
<L>Few now insult with falshoods, shameless pen,</L>
<L>Monsters from Tophet driv'n in shapes of men:</L>
<L>Few pension'd scribblers left the daring head,</L>
<L>Some have turn'd lunatics and some have fled—</L>
<L>Some late converted, scarce their pensions hold,</L>
<L>And from mere force disdain the charms of gold.</L>
<L>What deep offence has fir'd a monarch's rage,</L>
<L>What moonstruck madness seiz'd the brain of Gage?</L>
<L>Laughs not the soul, when an imprison'd few,</L>
<L>Affect to pardon those they can't subdue?</L>
<L>Tho' twice repuls'd and hemm'd up to their stations,</L>
<L>Yet issue pardons, oaths and proclamations,</L>
<L>As if at sea some desperate madman crew</L>
<L>Should threat the tempest with what they could do,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="014038_0008_0F92ABF91E2623C0"/>And like proud Xerxes lash the angry waves,</L>
<L>At the same instant that they find their graves.</L>
<L>But not the pomps and favours of a crown,</L>
<L>A nations anger, or a statesman frown,</L>
<L>Could draw the virtuous man from virtue's way,</L>
<L>To chain by force what treach'ry can't betray,</L>
<L>Virtue disdains to own tyrannic laws,</L>
<L>Takes part with freedom, and assumes its cause,</L>
<L>No part had she, her fiercest forces own,</L>
<L>To bring so far this heavy vengeance on;</L>
<L>She stood with Romans while their hearts were true,</L>
<L>And so she shall, Americans with you.</L>
<L>Should heaven in wrath decree some nations fall,</L>
<L>Whose crimes from thence for sacred vengeance call,</L>
<L>A monarch first of vulgar soul should rise,</L>
<L>A sure fore-runner of its obsequies,</L>
<L>Whose heart should glow with not one gen'rous thought</L>
<L>Born to oppress, to propagate, and rot,</L>
<L>Whose lengthen'd reign no deed of worth should grace</L>
<L>None trusted but a servile pensioned race;</L>
<L>Too dull to know what saving course to take,</L>
<L>That heaven in time its purpose might forsake,</L>
<L>Too obstinately will'd to bow his ear</L>
<L>To groaning thousands or petitions hear,</L>
<L>Dare break all oaths that bind the just like fate,</L>
<L>Oaths, that th'Arch-Devil would blush to violate,</L>
<L>And foe to truth both oaths and honour sell,</L>
<L>To establish principles, the growth of hell,</L>
<L>Stile those who aim to be his truest friends,</L>
<L>Traitors, insidious rebels, madmen, fiends,</L>
<L>Hoodwink'd and blind, deceived by secret foes,</L>
<L>Whose fathers once with exil'd tyrants rose,</L>
<L>Bless'd with as little sense as God e'er gave,</L>
<L>Slave to wrong schemes, dupe to a noble knave.</L>
<L><PB N="9" REF="014038_0009_0F92ABFA058F66A0"/>So odd a monarch heaven in wrath would plan,</L>
<L>And such would be the fury of a man.</L>
<L>See far and wide o'er long Canadia's plains,</L>
<L>Old popish fraud and superstition reigns;</L>
<L>The scarlet whore long hath heaven withstood,</L>
<L>Who cries for murder and who thirsts for blood,</L>
<L>Establish'd there, marks down each destined name,</L>
<L>And plants the stake impatient for the flame,</L>
<L>With sanguinary soul her trade begins,</L>
<L>To doom her foes to hell or pardon sins;</L>
<L>Her crafty priests their impious rites maintain,</L>
<L>And crucify their Saviour once again;</L>
<L>Defend his rights, who scatt'ring lies abroad,</L>
<L>With shameless front usurps the seat of God:</L>
<L>Those are, we fear, who his vile cause assert,</L>
<L>But half reform'd and papists at the heart.</L>
<L>Bear me some power as far as winds can blow,</L>
<L>As ships can travel, or as waves can flow,</L>
<L>To some lone isle beyond the southern pole,</L>
<L>Or lands round which pacific waters roll,</L>
<L>There should oblivion stop the heaving sigh,</L>
<L>There should I live at least with liberty,</L>
<L>But honour checks my speed and bids me stay,</L>
<L>To try the fortune of the well fought day,</L>
<L>Resentment for my country's fate I bear,</L>
<L>And mix with thousands for the willing war;</L>
<L>See Washington New Albion's freedom owns,</L>
<L>And moves to war with half Virginia's sons,</L>
<L>Bold in the fight, whose actions might have aw'd,</L>
<L>A Roman Hero, or a Grecian God,</L>
<L>He, he, as first, his gallant troops shall lead</L>
<L>Undaunted man a second Diomede,</L>
<L>As when he fought at wild Ohio's flood,</L>
<L>When savage thousands issu'd from the wood▪</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="014038_0010_0F92ABFAD83FFE18"/>When Braddock's fall disgrac'd the mighty day,</L>

<L>Columbia, nor shall fame deny it owes</L>
<L>Past safety to the counsel you propose,</L>
<L>And if they do not keep Columbia free,</L>

<L>Great souls grow bolder in their country's cause,</L>

<L>O Congress fam'd, accept this humbly lay,</L>
<L>The little tribute that the muse can pay,</L>

<L>A free asylum or a wretched state,</L>

<L>Heard or not heard, and struggle to be free,</L>
<L>Born to contend, our lives we place at stake,</L>
<L>And grow immortal by the stand we make,</L>
<L>O you, who far from liberty detain'd,</L>
<L>Wear out existence in some slavish land,</L>
<L>Fly thence from tyrants, and their flatt'ring throng,</L>
<L>And bring the fiery freeborn soul along,</L>
<L>Neptune for you shall smooth the hoary deep,</L>

<L>And freedom, God-like freedom crowns the whole.</L>
<L>And you brave men who scorn the dread of death,</L>
<L>Resolv'd to conquer to the latest breath,</L>
<L>Soldiers in act, and heroes in renown</L>
<L>Warm in the cause of Boston's hapless town,</L>
<L>Still guard each pass, like ancient Romans, you</L>
<L>At once are soldiers, and are farmers too;</L>
<L>Still arm impatient for the vengeful blow,</L>

<L>As when of late midst clouds of fire and smoke,</L>

<L>Once more, and yet once more for freedom strive,</L>
<L>To be a slave what wretch would dare to live?</L>
<L>We too to the last drop our blood will drain,</L>
<L>And not till then shall hated slavery reign,</L>
<L>When every effort, every hope is o'er,</L>
<L>And lost Columbia swells our breasts no more▪</L>
<L>O if that day, which heaven avert must come,</L>

<L>One thund'ring raise the midnight cry,</L>
<L>And one last flame send Boston to the sky.</L>
<L>But cease, foreboding Muse, nor strive to see</L>
<L>Dark times deriv'd by fatal destiny;</L>
<L>If ever Heaven befriended the distrest,</L>

<L>Happy some land, which all for freedom gave,</L>
<L>Happier the men whom their own virtues save;</L>
<L>Thrice happy we who long attacks have stood,</L>
<L>And swam to Liberty thro' seas of blood;</L>
<L>The time shall come when strangers rule no more,</L>
