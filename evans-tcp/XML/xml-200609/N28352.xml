</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Young Lat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Excuse me, my Lord; whatever joy I might feel at my return to this much lov'd spot, is damp'd by the reflection of what may have been occasion'd by my own imprudence. I left a rever'd father, a belov'd sister, to fly from the torments of a hopeless passion! Should any misfortune have happened to either of them in my absence, I shall ever look on myself as the cause of it.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord Stan.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, why regard only the gloomy side of the picture? Figure to yourself, a father enjoying a down till of life, unclouded by sorrow; cheer'd by the attentions of a much lov'd virtuous daughter; and en∣liven'd by the hopes of once more clasping in his arms, a son ripen'd to manhood, humaniz'd by a knowledge of the world, and returning to be the prop and com∣fort of his last moments. And then—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Young Lat.</SPEAKER>
<P>And then, my Lord, to continue your Iandscape, let me behold all this sunshine prospect, ob∣scur'd at once by beholding my Valence (whom ab∣sence, so far from erasing has impress'd deeper in my heart) in the arms of another; all her vows of never∣ceasing love and truth broken; myself the jest of all my former comrades; <HI>and then</HI>—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Stan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Latouche; but that I have had une∣quivocal proofs of your fortitude, I should be almost tempted to doubt it. Is <HI>this</HI> the man, who so undaunt∣edly risk'd his life to defend mine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Young Lat.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord; there is a wide difference between risking one's life in the cause of humanity, and sitting down calmly, the sport of unmerited misfortune. Was it my fault, that I was born of parents inferior, in point of affluence, to my Valence's? Was it I who form'd her father's heart of so flinty materials that he would rather sacrifice his daughter to the embraces of a <HI>rich</HI> man she <HI>detested,</HI> than see her happy in the arms of a <HI>poor</HI> man she <HI>lov'd?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Stan.</SPEAKER>
<P>All granted; but you may still find your Valence constant; and if riches are the only ob∣stacle to your happiness; my possessions are far superi∣or to her father's; and those I need not tell you, you may command. Come! come! cheer un wandering during the whole night has depress'd your spirits you must—</P>

<P>Love and Duty now are at even and odd.

<SPEAKER>Lord Stan.</SPEAKER>
<P>No more of that!—had not Providence sent you to my rescue, that <HI>dross</HI> had been useless to me; can <HI>I</HI> do less than share it with <HI>him,</HI> who risk'd his ex∣istence for <HI>me.</HI> I don't think of repaying your services—Heaven alone can do that.—So go, see your mistress, and be bless'd.</P>

<P>Thank Heav'n! I'm one doubt lighter, I have still a father!—Well, my good Blanco, and his daughter—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Blan.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know nothing about <HI>her.</HI> The old man hasn't been our customer, as I said before, since old Josefo's death—I did hear he was melancholy about a 'scape grace son, that run away and turn'd soldier, and all for love of a woman.</P>

<P>I ll do't, your honor—you cou'dn't have found a fitter man in the whole village to send of an errand, only somehow or other, I am main apt to forget it before I'm got half way; but if your honor will put it down in black and white—</P>

Neither time, nor the dissipations of London have been able to drive her from my memory; and the inward monitor has, with never ceasing austerity, whisper'd me, that it was a villainous act, first to seduce and then abandon to the world's scorn, a beauteous girl, whose only fail∣ing was an unbounded confidence in my vows.

<P>The honor is on my side. The acquain∣tance of a brave, worthy man is a blessing seldom ob∣tain'd—never enough to be valued! Ours commenced by his risking his life in defence of mine, against a band of assassins who attack'd me in a gloomy forest which I pass'd in my journey; a servant, whom I hir'd in Paris, prov'd to be in league with them; and join'd them at the beginning of the attack. My efforts were exhausted, and I was nearly overpower'd by numbers, when your gallant son, returning to his native place, be∣held the unequal conflict, and flew to my aid; the vil∣lains were soon put to flight, therefore to him am I in∣debted for existence.</P>

'tis a hard task for a guilty mind to unburthen itself, but I will endeavour to comply with your request. My boy left me in the utmost despair, dreading the dangers which the phrenzy of hopeless love might drive him into. My remaining child sat with me, wept with me, reason'd with me, and lull'd me with hopes into a kind of placid stupor. Near two years elaps'd in this manner, when she became pensive—sigh'd—seem'd to wish to avoid even my company—and when her eyes met mine, I could observe them bedew'd with tears. Supposing grief for her brother's hopeless return to be the cause, I, in my turn; endeavoured to console her, but in vain! Despairing at length of being able to conceal it from me much longer, she related the dread∣ful story—<HI>she had been seduc'd, and abandon'd by a villain!</HI></P>

<P>An Englishman did she say?</P>

<P>She did. As an excuse for parting, he told my poor girl that his father was at the point of death, and had commanded his instant appearance at home; but that he would return as soon as his father's death or recovery would permit him, and marry her. And worse, ten thousand times worse than devil, I! to turn her out to the scorn of the world, to want and infamy!</P>

<P>About eight years since, my father sent me to make the grand tour of Europe. Having a taste for painting, I would not neglect to view the pic∣turesque mountains and vallies of Switzerland. I ar∣rived at this spot—going one fine morning to view the beauties of nature, heightened by the rising sun I met the lovely Julietta in search of some stray lambs—I ad∣mired and accosted her; her answers, full of sweetness and simplicity, enchanted my youthful mind, then of a romantic turn. At parting she told me, that she alone
<PB N="29" REF="037784_0029_100F4D41EF279438"/>
attended an aged parent, who impatiently expected her return. Her filial piety endeared her so much to me, that I could scarce check myself from offering to share that amiable task with her—with difficulty, I obtained her promise to see me again at the same spot. She kept her word—we grew interesting to each other—interview succeeded interview—till firmly persuaded of my truth and honour, she <HI>yielded!!</HI>—How could her unsuspect∣ing mind escape contagion! I pass'd the time as in a dream of happiness; till I was rous'd by the arrival of a courier from my father, with a letter announcing that his dangerous state of health threatened a speedy disso∣lution, and commanding me to lose no time in hasten∣ing home—I had scarce courage to tell the tidings to Julietta, who receiv'd them as I expected—<HI>in an agony of grief</HI>—I endeavour'd to soothe her by a promise of returning so soon as my father should recover, or I should have closed his eyes. Obliged to depart—I gave her that ring as a pledge of my <HI>honour!</HI>—On my arrival in England, I found my father on the recovery, he lingered out some years, while I, in vain, strove to deaden reflection by joining the vortex of fashionable dissipation. After his death, I became Lord Stanton; the settlement of his affairs required my longer stay; I finished with all speed—and sat out, hoping to find my Julietta still alive, and to make her lawful reparation for her injured fame—by <HI>marriage.</HI></P>

<P>No—when I heard the old man's mourn∣ful story, its resemblance to that of mine and Julietta's instantly struck me. I retired to reflect; and endeav∣oured to hope his sorrows were not caused by me—now that hope is banish'd. You have seal'd the fatal certainty.</P>

<P>I'm glad you did not tell them; as what is passed cannot be recalled, the discovery would now on∣ly serve to open the sear'd wound, and make it bleed afresh. For your offence to Julietta, penitence must make your peace with Heaven. <HI>She</HI> has already for∣given you!</P>

<P>Heavens! what can be the reason of my beat∣ing heart sounding these strong alarms? Why this un∣easiness! Who can this stranger be? What is he to me? Yet, why did the Rev. Pastor ask me for my <HI>ring?</HI> Sure, <HI>I</HI> must have been the subject of their conversa∣tion, or he never would have ask'd me for that sacred pledge—and with a look full of meaning?

<SPEAKER>PASTOR, (with complacent look)</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Julietta, how are your spirits? Do you feel more compos'd since our last conversation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not much, Sir, (<HI>aside</HI>) He never before ap∣proach'd me with a smile, nor would he now insult a broken heart with untim'd mirth; sure he must bring some comfort.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>(<HI>taking her hand</HI>) Julietta—do not be alarm∣ed; you must summon up your utmost fortitude; I've news to tell you which will require it, although it will prove a consolation.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure it cannot be for grief you thus bid me prepare, because your looks are pleasant. After so many trials, methinks, Sir, you need not doubt my for∣titude—I am ready.</P>

<P>Of your brother! he is arriv'd!</P>

<P>(<HI>withdrawing her hand, seemingly disappointed and chagrined</HI>) Was <HI>that</HI>—what he had to communicate to you?</P>
</SP>

<P>It was; I hasten'd to tell you, what I tho't joyful tidings; but they don't seem to give you much satisfaction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>(<HI>after a struggle, in which a sense of her own situ∣ation predominates over joy for her brother's safe return</HI>)—What is it to a wretch like me? wherefore should I joy to hear of a brother's arrival? will he fly to embrace <HI>me</HI> as a <HI>brother</HI> would a <HI>sister?</HI> No—he will shrink from my touch as from a pestilential vapour! on his first enquiry, his ears will be saluted with <HI>my</HI> ill fame; his poor, lost, degraded sister will rise from the grave to shame him, "with all her faults, by envy twice o'er∣told."—No—let me still be suppos'd dead.</P>

<P>He lov'd you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>He did, <HI>once</HI>—then I was pure and spotless. Should I now approach him?—oh! he would spurn me, dash me from him, trample me under his feet! whilst I, humbly suppliant, <HI>in vain</HI> implor'd forgiveness of my crime! No, I can never endure it. If I am sup∣pos'd dead, my, father and brother may pity—nay, perhaps, forgive, bless and pray for me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Past.</SPEAKER>
<P>It will, however, be some consolation to you to hear of your brother's success.—He has preserv'd the life of a man, whose gratitude is boundless as his wealth. Polaco's only objection will be easily remov'd, and your brother will very soon enjoy his belov'd Val∣ence and affluence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is, indeed, a consolation! happy brother! happy, happy Valence! you will soon receive the re∣ward of <HI>virtuous</HI> love!—While <HI>I</HI>—wretched, despis'd, abandon'd!—oh, horror! I cannot bear—my very soul shudders at the contrast!</P>

<P>Nay, pray be calm.</P>

<P>How would my soul spring out to meet a brother's embrace! but no—it cannot be—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Past.</SPEAKER>
<P>Consider, Julietta, your brother's absence made him long ago thought lost. Providence has pre∣served him! Doubt you he can also cause the author of your woes, struck by horrific conscience, to return and make <HI>you</HI> reparation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jul.</SPEAKER>
<P>(<HI>in an agony of despair</HI>) He never will return!—Men despise an easy conquest. Their appetites, pall'd by enjoyment, must be roused by variety! woe∣ful's the experience I have bought.—A simple Swiss rustic was not to be the wife of an English man of fash∣ion. No; he now flutters through the gay, thoughtless circles of high life, or, perhaps, has long since given to some <HI>rich lady</HI> that faithless hand which belong'd of right to <HI>poor Julietta!</HI>—Fool! artless fool, that I was! to stake my all—my reputation, against a man's prom∣ises!</P>

<P>The fineness of the evening, Sir, A garden is a charming place for meditation; and I was taking a walk to consider of what you were saying to me to-day.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, and what do you think of it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir, 'tis no very easy matter to deter∣mine; that I love Young Latouche, you know very well; and that I love you, Sir, you know also. You must make some allowance for the struggle between love and duty.</P>

<SPEAKER>Pol.</SPEAKER>

<SP>
<P>Eh! my young friend, I'm heartily glad to see you. I call'd at the Inn, but was inform'd you were gone out. Did you receive my message?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Young Lat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and a most fortunate one it was! This honest fellow who brought it, came just in time to rescue me from the swords of three assassins, who way∣laid me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Past.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fortunate indeed! Do you know who the vil∣lains are?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Young Lat.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and I shall pay their bill of ex∣change at first sight; but at present, I have more ma∣terial business. This Sir, is my intended wife; please Heaven and you to join us.</P>

<P>If you are at leisure, Sir, VALENCE and I would have no objection to the ceremony's being per∣form'd out of hand, eh! VALENCE? nay, never look down; as we are in for matrimony, we may as well put a good face on't.</P>

<P>I have but one objection to your haste, and that is—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>(Enter Servant, hastily.)</STAGE>
<SP>

</SP>
<STAGE>Enter POLACO and CHAPONE.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pol.</SPEAKER>
<P>So, here you are, Miss! this is your prudent determination, after your struggle between love and du∣ty, is it? but you see I am pretty close at your heels. (<HI>To Pastor</HI>) Sir, a man of your character and function will not, I suppose, encourage the disobedience of chil∣dren to their parents?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="42" REF="037784_0042_100F4D5E8FD4B048"/>
<SPEAKER>Past.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never, Sir. Your daughter came here a few minutes ago—but entirely unexpected by me. There she is at your disposal.</P>

<P>Then they are <HI>not</HI> married?</P>
</SP>

<P>No, nor ever will be by me, without the con∣sent of parents on both sides.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank heaven! Then, Mrs. <HI>Love and Duty!</HI> I shall make bold to exert that authority which I still have over you. You <HI>shall</HI> have a husband to night; but one of <HI>my</HI> choosing; and that will not be a soldier, I promise you—so come along, (<HI>pulling her from Young Latouche.</HI>)</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Past.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you any other objection to this young man (<HI>pointing to Young Latouche</HI>) for a son in law, be∣sides his want of fortune?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pol.</SPEAKER>
<P>None. What other objection need I have? Want of fortune is want of—dam'me, what is'n't it want of?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Past.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I understand you right, then—provided he can <HI>bid</HI> as fair for her, as any other person, you will consent he shall have her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Pol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, look'ye, Sir, as I believe my daughter loves him, and he loves my daughter, I'm not so un∣reasonable as to oppose <HI>their wishes,</HI> so their wishes do not oppose <HI>my interest.</HI> I like the young fellow very well—he's spirited! but that alone won't do for Pola∣co! How the devil should <HI>he</HI> bid for my daughter? I'm sure his father can't furnish the <HI>wherewithal?</HI></P>

<P>What signifies, so he has it? what portion do you require?</P>

<P>Before faces, your Highness, or behind backs, all's one to Polaco. I may do as I please with my own child, I suppose. Your <HI>mortgage</HI> may be <HI>very good</HI>—but the <HI>ready</HI> is a dev'lish deal <HI>better!</HI></P>
