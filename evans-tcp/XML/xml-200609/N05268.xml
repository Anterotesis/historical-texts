<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>INgratitude towards Men, after signal Favours received, is amongst all civilized People, looked upon with a just Detestation; insomuch, that the Moral <HI>Gentiles,</HI> in Ages post, thought they could give no worse a Character of a Person, than to call him <HI>Ungrateful:</HI> How much more then are <HI>Christians</HI> (especially in a Time of such Light, as now shineth) engaged, to shun this Sin of <HI>Ingratitude,</HI> towards their God, whom they sensibly know, to be <HI>The Fountain of all their Mercies?</HI> And surely, next to the infinite Mercy, shewed them for Christ's sake, in causing the <HI>Day spring from on high to visit their Souls,</HI> remarkable outward Deliverances, ought in a more than commonly remarkable Manner, to be the Objects of Gratitude to their great <HI>Deliverer.</HI> I must confess, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hanksgiving (which is what we poor Mortals can return, for the manifold Favours we daily receive from Him) hath its Rise in the Heart; and as <HI>out of the Abundance of the Heart, the Mouth speaketh;</HI> how can those who are truly thankful in Heart, but <HI>render the Calves of their Lips,</HI> in telling to their Friends and Acquaintance, <HI>How great Things God hath done for them?</HI> Nay, they are so affected with such eminent Appearances of the protecting Hand of Providence, for their Help, Preservation and Deliverance, that they are not willing to confine it to them only, but publish it to the World, that the Fame of their GOD may be spread from <HI>Sea to Sea,</HI> and from one End of the <HI>Earth to the other.</HI></P>
<P>The following Relation being large, I shall endeavour to be short; only, some of the Things which seem to me most remarkable, I would more particularly recommend to the Reader's Observation.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>1. The Hearts of all Men are in the Hands of God,</HI> he can turn them as he pleases. When these <HI>Men-Eaters</HI> Fury was at height, their Knives in one Hand, and the poor Shipwrack'd People's Heads in the other, their Knees upon the others Shoulders, and their Looks dismal; on a sudden, the <HI>Savages</HI> were struck dumb, and their Countenances changed, that they looked like another People; the <HI>Cassekey</HI> (or King) becoming as a Safeguard to the Distressed, from the Injuries of his own Men: Nay, such Confidence put he in
<PB REF="006658_0004_10297646B6791568"/>
them, that he would trust them to remove the Money he had taken from themselves, before he would trust his own People. When they were got from there, to another Place, where they expected more Safety, they found themselves disappointed, fresh Dangers presenting themselves, as dismally as before; yet God prevented any further Mischief, than the stripping them of those poor Rags the others had left them, and some other Abuses, which by that Time were grown familiar to them, and were looked upon, as <HI>light Afflictions</HI>: The <HI>Cassekey's</HI> Wife being made an Instrument for their Delivery, she, and some others, having something of Tenderness of Heart in them, tho' amongst such an <HI>inhuman Crew.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> Many were the particular Diliverances, upon occasion of Injuries offered: Once, an Arrow shot at them narrowly escaped them: Another Time, some going to shoot Arrows at them, certain of their own Company caught hold of their Bows and Arms; nay, though some of them shot, yet their Arrows mist. Not to mention the frequent Dangers they were in, upon every slight Suspicion of their being <HI>English,</HI> of which, more anon. And well might these poor Sufferers be in conti∣nual Fear of their Lives, since about a Twelve Month before, a Parcel of <HI>Dutch-Men,</HI> who had likewise suffered Shipwrack, had been killed and devoured; and moreover, of the many Vessels, supposed to be lost on that Coast, these are the first Company that are known to have escaped: Neither is it so wonderful that they are thus cruel to Strangers, since they are unnatural to their own aged People; they having no more Compassion on them, than to make them Slaves to the Youn∣ger. Yet are these <HI>Men-Eaters</HI> as cowardly as cruel; when the <HI>Spaniards</HI> came up, the Sight of a rusty Musket presented towards them, would make several of them fly.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3.</HI> The Dangers they were delivered from, arose not only from Men, but the <HI>Elements</HI> also, which God permitted to threaten and afflict them. One Time, rowing in their Boat, the Sea swelled, so that it was dangerous continuing there all Night, and as dangerous, to endeavour for the Shore; yet Providence failed them not, but conducted them safe thither, as though there had been a Lane made through the Breakers: Another Time, by Reason of a great Flood, they were forced to remove their Lodgings several Times, and for divers Days, were in a continual Apprehension of being drowned, at length were preserved upon an <HI>Oyster Hill</HI>: Not to mention the frequent Dangers they were in, by reason of the extream Cold, too tedious to touch at here; wherein this however is remarkable, that God can both administer Strength in the Midst of Weakness, and also take away Strength, and cause Weakness to seize, whenever he pleases: Here was an Old Man, a Woman with a Sucking Child, and another with Child, Persons seemingly very unlikely to encounter such Hardships, all escaped; and divers <HI>Negroes,</HI> used to more Hardiness, perished.</P>
<P N="4"><PB REF="006658_0005_102976483B18B920"/><HI>4.</HI> As to Lodging, I shall say little, any discreet Person may imagine, how hard it was to People, well brought up, to lie on a Floor, swarming with Abundance of many Sorts of creeping Things, occasioned by the throwing the Berry Stones on the Floor, and letting all the Nastiness they made, lie there, which bred these Vermin; and yet perhaps might be accounted good Lodging, in Comparison of the cold Ground, whereon they often lay afterwards unsheltered, exposed to the bleak Blasts of the rigid <HI>North-West-Wind.</HI></P>
<P N="5"><HI>5.</HI> Their Food most scanty, the best of it such, as (I am ready to think) the meanest <HI>Negro</HI> here, would not touch with his Lips: Sometimes the Gills and Guts of Fish, pick'd off a Dunghill; sometimes the Scraps the <HI>Indians</HI> f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ung away, and the Water they boiled their Fish in, though never so undecently handled. At first their Sorrows were so great, and their Alarms so many, they could not eat; afterwards their Dyet so uncouth, they could not away with it; until at length Hunger had so far prevailed over them, that they could eat with an Appetite, the <HI>Palmetto-Berries;</HI> the Taste whereof was once irksome, and ready to take away their Breath; nay, so fond were they of them, that the getting of about a Bushel accidentally, was looked on a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a great Prize.</P>
<P N="6"><HI>6.</HI> Their being forced to mask themselves, under the Name of <HI>Spaniards,</HI> though few of them could speak any <HI>Spanish,</HI> was another Hardship; mostly because the Natives often suspected them to be <HI>English,</HI> and thereby they were continually in Danger of their Lives: Whether their Cruelty against the <HI>English,</HI> proceeds from their being under no Apprehension of Danger from them, and so may think themselves lawless, in what they do against our Nation; or whether it proceeds from any particular Disgust offered them by some <HI>English,</HI> I shall not determine: However, it would do well, for those that are not under their Power to avoid giving them any just Cause of Offence, least their Neighbours suffer for their Faults: One of these <HI>Savages</HI> could complain, <HI>That, some Years past, he had been taken off by some of our</HI> English <HI>Sloops, from whom he escaped by Swimming,</HI> and was therewith disgusted, insomuch, that could he, by his sifting, have found out, that they were <HI>English,</HI> it might have proved of ill Consequence to them.</P>
<P N="7"><HI>7.</HI> The Courtesy of the Governor of <HI>Augustine,</HI> who clothed these naked People, fed their hungry Stomacks, and caused them to be conducted safely to <HI>Carolina,</HI> is not to be passed by, without due Notice; especially being a Man of another Nation, as well as of a different Religion; and what is more, of such an one, as doth not teach its <HI>Votaries</HI> so much Compassion, towards those they count <HI>Hereticks:</HI> Neither let me forget the Governor of <HI>Carolina,</HI> whose Generosity compleated, what the Governor of <HI>Augustine</HI> had begun, in assisting and cherishing these our afflicted Friends and Country Folks; with which, I shall conclude these <HI>Remarks,</HI> to trea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more particularly,
<PB REF="006658_0006_10293C6CAC5B1A40"/>
concerning that faithful Servant of the Lord, <HI>Robert Barrow,</HI> who was one of this Company.</P>
<P>This Man of God, whose Habitation was in one of the Northern Counties of <HI>England,</HI> was early convinced of the blessed Truth of God, professed by the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> and soon after had a <HI>Dispensation of the Gospel</HI> committed to him. He lived, in his native Country, in esteem amongst his Neighbours, for his Godly Conversation; and ho∣noured in the Church of God, as an Elder, who had abode faithful in his Testimony, both in Preaching the Gospel, Suffering for the same, and Behaving himself answerable thereunto. And in the Year <HI>1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>94.</HI> the Spirit of God (from whom he first had his Commission) requiring him to come over into these Parts, to Preach the Gospel here also; <HI>he was not disobient to the Heavenly Call,</HI> but gave up to do the Will of God, though in a Cross to his own, as appeared by an Expression of his, before he left <HI>England,;</HI> which was to this Effect: <HI>That he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>her immediately have laid down his natural Life there, if by so doing he could have kept his Peace with God, than to have crossed the Seas to</HI> America. Well, hither he came; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he had thoroughly visited these Parts, he took Ship for the <HI>West-India Islands</HI>▪ and at length was returning from <HI>Jamaica,</HI> to this Town of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> when these Calamities, mentioned in the ensuing <HI>Journal,</HI> befel him: How he behaved himself under them, with what Faith he overcome, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> worst of Men; so that it may be said, He was <HI>more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onqueror</HI> over those Blood-Thirsty <HI>Canibals;</HI> looking to Him <HI>who was Invisible,</HI> and by his Grace seeing beyond them and their Cruelty; by Prayer <HI>wrestling with God for a Blessing;</HI> even the Blessing of being delivered out of their barbarous Hands, and laying his Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ithful Friends; and so effectual were his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Prayers, that they <HI>prevailed with God</HI>; and so gracious was his God unto him, that he sealed an Assurance upon his Spirit, That his Prayers were heard, and should in due Time be answered, before he was yet off his Knees. And doubtless, he was made a Strength and a Comfort to his Companions in Affliction; whose Remembrance will not be easily blotted out of their Minds.</P>
<P>One remarkable Passage I cannot well omit, which demonstrates he had well learn'd of Him who is a <HI>God of Truth,</HI> to speak the Truth upon all Occasions, though with the Hazard of his Life. For, as the Reader may observe in the Series of this following Relation, these poor People, for the Safe-guard of their Lives, had assumed the Name of <HI>Spaniards</HI>; some on that Account, asserting what was wrong, others concealing the Truth; yet this Honest-hearted Man, being directly asked the Question, <HI>Nickalier, Nickalier?</HI> (their Word for <HI>English-Men</HI>) could do neither; but in Simplicity answered, <HI>Yes;</HI> being asked so concerning another, he again answered, <HI>Yes.</HI> Yet though for his Plain-dealing, he was stripp'd of his Clothes; which, till then, he
<PB REF="006658_0007_10297649C593DB40"/>
had saved, God suffered not these <HI>Savages</HI> to touch his Life, or the Lives of any of his Company.</P>
<P>Thus he passed through this afflicting Trial, and at length arrived at this Place, on the <HI>1</HI>st Day of the <HI>2</HI>d Month, <HI>1697.</HI> though in much Weakness; having been taken very ill of the Belly∣ach and Flux at <HI>Augustine</HI>; of which he never recovered, but still grew worse, to his dying Day. It was about the <HI>8</HI>th Hour in the Evening, when the <HI>Vessel,</HI> he was Passenger in, arrived at this Place. Divers Friends went on board, in order to get him a Shore, but he being in a very weak Condition, they could not remove him at that Time. He declared, <HI>His great Satisfaction, that the Lord had granted his Request, that he might lay down his Bones in this Place; that his Heart was strong, and he hoped he might first see</HI> Friends <HI>again at the Meeting. He made mention of the Goodness of God to him, and that his Presence had attended him in all his Exercises.</HI></P>
<P>The next Morning, being the <HI>2</HI>d of the <HI>2</HI>d Month, divers Friends went on board, to help the Vessel up to a Wharf, in order to get him on Shore; in which Time he spake as before related, <HI>God's Power attending him.</HI> About the <HI>7</HI>th Hour, divers Friends carried him in a <HI>Hammocker</HI> (being wrapp'd up in a Blanket, and Clothes to keep him warm) to the House of <HI>Samuel Carpenter,</HI> where he declared, <HI>The Goodness of God to him; and that his Heart was yet strong, and his Memory and Understanding good. After which he was shifted, and then slept a considerable Time.</HI></P>
<P>On the same Day, some Friends coming into the Room to visit him, at the Sight of them he seemed to rejoice; and, putting forth his Hand, was ready to embrace them in much Love, and in a very tender Frame of Spirit. The Friends expressed their Gladness to see him; but said, <HI>They were sorry to see him so very weak:</HI> To which he replied, <HI>Although my Body be weak, my Mind is sound, and Memory good.</HI> And further said, <HI>The Lord hath been very good to me, all along unto this very Day; and this Morning hath sweetly refreshed me.</HI> And further added, <HI>The Lord hath answered my Desire, for I desired Content, and that I might come to this Place, to lay my Bones amongst you.</HI> And afterwards said, <HI>It is a good Thing to have a Conscience void of Offence, both towards God, and towards Men.</HI></P>
<P>On the <HI>4</HI>th Day of the <HI>2</HI>d Month, being the <HI>1</HI>st Day of the Week, about the <HI>5</HI>th Hour in the Morning, he desired a Friend to write for him to his dear Wife, <HI>To remember his dear Love to her: and to let her know of his Travels, and being here; and that the Lord was with him; that his outward Affairs were settled; and That she had wherewithall to live on.</HI> He further said, divers Friends being present; <HI>That the Lord was with him, and all Things were well; and that he had nothing to do, but to die:</HI> And accordingly on this Day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e dep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rted; and on the <HI>3</HI>d Day following,
<PB REF="006658_0008_1029764B61A0D360"/>
being the <HI>6</HI>th Day of the <HI>2</HI>d Month, was buried in Friends Burying-ground, in this Town of <HI>Philadelphia.</HI></P>
<P>And now, having brought my Relation, concerning this good Man, to the last Period of his Life, I might very well have put a Period to my <HI>Preface:</HI> But that I foresee, Some Persons may be ready to say. <HI>Here is an Account of very strange Passages, but of what Credit is the Relator? May we depend upon his Authority, without Danger of being Imposed upon?</HI> To such I answer, He is a Man well known in this Town, of good Credit and Repute; on whose Fidelity and Veracity, those who have any Knowledge of him, will readily rely without suspecting Fallacy. But <HI>that in the Mouth of two or three Witnesses every Thing may be established,</HI> besides him and his Wife, a Person, whose Residence (when at home) is in this Town, viz. <HI>Joseph Kirle,</HI> the Master of the <HI>Barkentine,</HI> in which they suffered Shipwrack, a Man of an honest Character amongst his Neighbours, had the Perusal of it, before it went to the Press; and approved it. With which I shall conclude, wishing my <HI>Reader</HI> much Satisfaction in the Reading of it; but never the Unhappiness of Ex∣periencing, in proper Person, the Truth of it.</P>

<P>THE Twenty-third Day of the Sixth Month, called <HI>August</HI> 1696. Being in Company with Twelve or Thirteen Sail of Merchant-Men, under the Convoy of the <HI>Hampshire</HI> Frigat, Captain <HI>Fletcher</HI> Commander, sailed from <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> we being bound for <HI>Pennsylvania.</HI></P>
<P>The 24th Day about Noon came a Sloop from <HI>Port-Royal,</HI> overtook us oft <HI>Portland</HI>; gave an Account of the French-Fleet's being at <HI>Cape Antonio.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="006658_0010_10297650176574C8"/>This Evening we lay by off <HI>Black-Rivers</HI>-Mouth, in order to go the next Morning to <HI>Blewfilds</HI>; but it be∣ing calm for many Days following, the Current drove us to Westward of the Island.</P>
<P>The 31st Day, This Evening we lost sight of the <HI>Hamshire</HI>-Frigat, and then beat to Windward again.</P>
<P>The 1st Day the 7th Month, we Anchored to West∣ward of <HI>Savanna La Mar,</HI> and lost our Anchor.</P>
<P>The 2d Day, we got into <HI>Blewfields</HI> Road to Water.</P>
<P>The 4th Day, This Morning we sailed from <HI>Blew∣fields</HI> intending our Passage through the <HI>Gulph.</HI></P>
<P>The 14th Day, about Noon, were a Breast with <HI>Cape Antonia</HI>; and about a League to the Eastward off the <HI>Cape</HI> was a Fire with a great Smoak: At length People appeared on the <HI>Bay,</HI> making Signs for us to put on Shore; but having a fresh Gale, and not know∣ing who they were, our Master would not.</P>
<P>The 16th Day made the Table-land of the <HI>Havanna,</HI> and this Evening stood over for <HI>Cape Florida</HI>; but about Eight or Nine at Night we saw two Lights, being about a Mile from us; we fearing we were got amongst the French-Fleet, tacked, and stood for the <HI>Havanna.</HI></P>
<P>The 18th Day, This Morning no Sail appeared, and being most of the Day calm; we lay about Four Leagues off the <HI>Havanna</HI>; we had a fair Wind, and were designed for that Port, to enquire of the French-Fleet. This Afternoon came a Turnado from the Land, and our Master being on the Quarter-Deck, our Boom gibing knocked him down, and broke his Leg, which Accident was grievious to him and us; but having Things suitable, with a little Experience, set it. At this Time had I Four of my Family very sick; one whereof was an <HI>Indian Girl</HI> being just as I had bound up the the Master's Leg taken with Fitts, whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> continued some Hours, and then she died. This Evening we stood over for <HI>Cape Florida,</HI> having the Wind North Easterly.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="006658_0011_102976519BF5A760"/>The 19th Day, this Morning the Wind not being fair, we stood up for <HI>Cuba</HI>; and about Sun-rising we espyed the Sails that we saw before, they standing as we stood: Therefore we supposed them to be some of our Company; we wronged them in Sailing, and by Noon lost sight of them. About Four this After∣noon we espyed a Ship, to the Eastward of us (we being about Four Leagues off Shore, and about Fifteen Leagues to Eastward of the <HI>Havanna</HI>) supposing her to be a <HI>French-Man,</HI> therefore stood in for the Shore; but she gained on us: Then a Turnado sprang up, and a great Shower of Rain followed, which hid us. Hereupon we tacked, and stood over for <HI>Florida.</HI> Night came on, that we saw no more of that Sail, having the Wind fair.</P>
<P>The 20th Day. This Morning we were in the <HI>Gulph,</HI> having a fair Wind, and seeing the two Ships follow∣ing us, we believed them to be of our Company.</P>
<P>The 21st Day. This Morning the Wind at East, and shifting Northerly.</P>
<P>The 22d Day, This Day the Storm began at <HI>N. E.</HI></P>
<P>The 23d Day, About One a Clock in the Morning we felt our Vessel strike some few strokes, and then she Floated again, for five or six Minutes, before she ran fast a Ground, where she beat violently at first; the Wind was violent; and it was very dark, that our Marriners could see no Land: The Seas broke over us, that we were in a quarter of an Hour Floating in the Cabin: We endeavoured to get a Candle lighted, which in a little Time was accomplished. By this Time we felt the Vessel not to strike so often; but several of her Timbers were broken, and some Plank started; the Seas continued breaking over us, and no Land to be seen. We concluded to keep in the Vessel as long as she would hold together. About the Third Hour this Morning, we supposed we saw Land at some considerable Distance. And at this Time we found the Water began to run out of the Vessel; and at Day∣light
<PB N="4" REF="006658_0012_10297657F40A4BD0"/>
we perceived we were upon the Shore, on a B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ach lying on the Breach of the Sea; which, at Times, as the Surges of the Sea reversed, was dry. In taking a view of our Vessel, we found that the Violence of the Weather had forced many Sorts of the Sea-Birds on Board of our Vessel; some of which were, by Force of Wind, bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wn into and under our Hen-Coops, and ma∣ny remained alive. Our Hogs and Sheep were washed away, and swam on Shore, except one of the Hogs, which remained in the Vessel. We rejoiced at this our Preservation from the raging Seas; but at the same Instant feared the sad Consequences that follow∣ed; yet, having Hopes still, we got our Sick and Lame on Shore; also our Provisions, with Sparrs and Sails to make a Tent. I went, with one Negro, to view the Land, and seek the most convenient Place for that purpose. But the Wilderness Country looked very dis∣mal, having no Trees, but only Sand-Hills, cover∣ed with shrubby Palmetto, the stalks of which were prickly, that there was no walking amongst them: I espyed a Place almost a Furlong within that Beach, being a Bottom; to this Place I with my Negro soon cut a Passage; the Storm and Rain continuing· Thi∣ther I got my Wife and sick Chi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, being six Months and twelve Days old; also <HI>Robert Barrow,</HI> an aged Man, who had been sick about five or six Months; our Ma∣ster, who some Days past had broke his Leg; and my Kinsman <HI>Benjamin Allen,</HI> who had been very ill, with a violent Fever, most Part of the Voyage: These, with others, we got to the Place, under the shelter of some few Bushes, which broke off some of the Wind, but kept none of the Rain from them; I got a Fire made: The most of our People were getting Provisions a Shore; our Chests, Trunks, and the rest our Clothing, were all very wet and cold.</P>
<P>About the Eighth or Ninth Hour, came two <HI>Indian</HI>-Men (being naked, except a small piece of Pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted-Work, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> fastned

behind, like a Horse-Tail in Shape, made of a Sort of Silk-Grass) from the <HI>Southward,</HI> runing fiercely, and foaming at the Month, having no Weapons but their Knives, and forthwith, not making any step, violently seized the two first of our Men they met with, who were carrying Corn from the Vessel to the Top of the Bank, where I stood to receive it, and put it into a Cask; they used no Violence, for the Men resisted not; but taking them under the Arm, brought them towards me: Their Countenances were very Furious and Blo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dy: They had their Hair tyed in a Roll behind, in which stuck two Bones shaped, one like a broad Arrow, in the other a Spear Head; the rest of our Men followed from the Vessel, asking me what they should do, whether they should get their Guns to kill these two; but I perswaded them otherwise, desiring them to be quiet, (shewing their Inability to defend us from what would follow) and to put our Trust in the Lord, who was able to defend to the uttermost. I walk'd towards the Place where our Sick and Lame were, the two <HI>Indian</HI>-Men follow∣ing me, I told them the <HI>Indians</HI> were come and com∣ing upon us: And whilst these two (setting the Men loose) stood with a wild furious Countenance, looking upon us; I thought with my self to give them some Tobacco and Pipes, which they greedily snatch'd from me, and making a snussing Noise like a Wild-Beast, turned their Backs upon us, and run away.</P>
<P>We communed together, and considered our Con∣dition, being among a barbarous People, such as were generally accounted <HI>Men-Eaters,</HI> believing those two were gone to Alarm their People: We sat our selves down, expecting Cruelty and hard Death, except it should please the Almighty God to Work wonderfu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly for our Deliverance. In this deep Concernment some of us were not left without Hopes; blessed be the Name of the Lord, in whom we trusted;</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="006658_0014_10297661824CF188"/>As we were under a deep exercise and Concernment, a Notion arose from one of us, that if we should put our selves under the Denomination of <HI>Spaniards</HI> (it being known that Nation had some Influence on them) and one of us, named <HI>Solomon Cresson,</HI> speaking the <HI>Spanish</HI> Language well, it was hop'd this might be a Means for our Delivery; to which, the most of the Company assented.</P>
<P>Within two or three Hours after the Departure of the two <HI>Indians,</HI> some of our People being near the Beach or Stand, returned and said, the <HI>Indians</HI> were coming in a very great Number, all running and shouting: About this Time the Storm was much aba∣ted, the Rain ceased, and the Sun appeared, which had been hid from us several Days. The <HI>Indians</HI> went all to the Vessel, casting forth what ever they could lay hold on, except Rum, Sugar, Molasses, Beef and Pork.</P>
<P>But their <HI>Cassekey</HI> (for so they call their King) with about thirty more, came down to us in a furious man∣ner, having a dismal Aspect, and foaming at the Mouth; their Weapons were large <HI>Spanish</HI> Knives, except their <HI>Cassekey's,</HI> who had a Baggonet, that belonged to the Master of our Vessel: They rushed in upon us, and cried, <HI>Nickaleer, Nickaleer</HI>; we understood them not at first; they repeating it unto us often, at last they cryed <HI>Epania</HI> for <HI>Spaniards</HI>; by which we understood them, that at first they meant <HI>English,</HI> but they were answered to the latter in <HI>Spanish,</HI> yea; to which they replyed. No <HI>Epania,</HI> no; but all cryed, <HI>Nickaleer, Nickaleer:</HI> We sitting on our Chests, Boxes and Trunks, and some on the Ground, the <HI>Indians</HI> surrounded us; we stirred nor moved not, but sat all, or most of us, very calm and still, some of us in a good Frame of Spirit, being freely given up to the Will of God.</P>
<P>Whilst we were thus sitting, as a People almost un∣concerned, these bloody minded Creatures placed them∣selves each behind one, kicking and throwing away the
<PB N="7" REF="006658_0015_102976630EEE6728"/>
Bushes that were nigh, or under their Feet; the <HI>Cassekey</HI> had placed himself behind me, standing on the Chest which I sat upon; they all having their Arms extended, with their Knives in their Hands, ready to execute their bloody Design, some taking hold of some of us by the Heads, with their Knees set against our Shoulders: In this Posture they seem'd to wait for the <HI>Cassekey</HI> to begin: They were high in Words, which we understood not: But on a sudden, it pleased the Lord to work wonder∣fully for our Preservation, and instantly all these Savage-Men were struck Dumb, and like Men amazed the Space of a quarter of an Hour, in which Time their Coun∣tenances fell, and they looked like another People: They quitted their Places they had taken behind us, and came in amongst us, requiring to have all our Chests, Trunks and Boxes unlock'd, which being done, they divided all that was in them. Our Money the <HI>Cassekey</HI> took unto himself, privately hiding it in the Bushes: Then they went to pulling off our Clothes, leaving each of us on∣ly a pair of Breeches, or an old Coat, except my Wife and Child, <HI>Robert Barrow,</HI> and our Master, from whom they took but little this Day.</P>
<P>Having thus done, they asked us again. <HI>Nickaleer, Nickaleer?</HI> But we answered, by saying, <HI>Pennsylvania.</HI></P>
<P>We began to enquire after St. <HI>Augusteen,</HI> also would talk of <HI>Santa Lucea,</HI> which was the Town that lay about a Degree to the North-ward; but they cunningly would seem to perswade us, that they both lay to the Southward: We signified <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them, that they lay to the Northward; and we woul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k of the <HI>Havana</HI> that lay to the South∣ward. Thes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ces they had heard of, and knew which way they lay.</P>
<P>At length, the <HI>Cassekey</HI> told us, how long it was to <HI>Santa Lucea,</HI> by Days Travel; but cared not to hear us mention St. <HI>Augusteen.</HI> They would signifie by Signs, we should go to the Southward. We answered, That we must go to the Northward, for <HI>Augusteen.</HI> When <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> found they could not otherwise perswade us, they
<PB N="8" REF="006658_0016_10297664B8F511E8"/>
signified, that we should go to the Southward, for the <HI>Havana,</HI> and that it was but a little Way.</P>
<P>We gave them to understand, that we came that Way. and were for the Northward: All which took Place with them. We perceived, that the <HI>Cassekey's</HI> Heart was tender∣ed towards us; for he kept mostly with us, and would the remaining Part of this Day keep off the Petty-Robbers, which would have had our few Rags from us. Some Time before Night we had a Shower of Rain, where∣upon the <HI>Cassekey</HI> made Signs for us to build some Shelter; upon which we got our Tent up, and some Leaves to lye upon.</P>
<P>About this Time our Vessel lay dry on Shore, and the <HI>Indians</HI> gathered themselves together, Men and Woman, some Hundreds in Number. Having got all the Goods out of the Vessel, and covered the <HI>Bay</HI> for a large Distance, opened all the Stuffs and Linnen, and spread them to dry. They would touch no Sort of strong Drink, Sugar, nor Molasses, but left it in the Vessel. They shouted, and made a great Noises in the Time of Plunder. Night coming on, the <HI>Cassekey</HI> put those Chests and Trunks, which he had reserved for himself, into our Tent; which pleased us, and gave an Expectation of his Com∣pany; for he was now become a Defender of us from the Rage of others. The <HI>Cassekey</HI> went down to the Water-Side, amongst his People, and returned with three old Coats that were wet and torn; which he gave us; one whereof I had. We made a Fire at each End of our Tent, and laid our selves down, it being dark: But hear∣ing hideous Noises, and fearing that they were not satis∣fied, we expected them upon us. The chief <HI>Indian</HI> (or <HI>Cassekey</HI>) lay in the Tent upon his Chests. And about Mid-night, we heard a Company of <HI>Indians</HI> coming from the Vessel towards us, making terrible Shouts, and coming fiercely up to the Tent; the <HI>Cassekey</HI> called to them, which caused them to stand: It seemed they had killed a Hog, and brought him; so the <HI>Cassekey</HI> asked us, if we would eat the Hog? <HI>Solomon Cresson,</HI> by our desire
<PB N="9" REF="006658_0017_10297667CCD7BC28"/>
answered him, That we used not to eat at that Time of the Night: Whereupon they threw the Hog down before the Tent, and the <HI>Cassekey</HI> sent them away. They went shouting to the Sea-Shore, where there were some Hundreds of them, Revelling about our Wreck.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="day">
<HEAD>The <HI>25</HI>th of the Seventh Month; the <HI>6</HI>th Day of the Week.</HEAD>
<P>This Morning, having purposed to endeavour for Li∣berty to pass to the Northward, <HI>Solomon</HI> opened the Matter to the <HI>Cassekey</HI>; who answered, we must go to his Town to the South-ward.</P>
<P>This occasioned us to go for <HI>Santa Lucea</HI> (this Place hav∣ing a <HI>Spanish</HI> Name, supposed to have found it under the Go∣vernment of that <HI>Nation,</HI> whence we might expect Relief) But the <HI>Cassekey</HI> told us, That it was about two or three Days Joueney thither; and that, when we came there, we should have our Throats and Scalps cut; and be Shot, burn'd and Eaten. We thought that Information was but to divert us, so that we were more earnest to go; but he sternly denied us, saying, We must go to his Town.</P>
<P>About Eight a Clock this Morning, the <HI>Cassekey</HI> came into our Tent, and set himself amongst us, asking the old Question, <HI>Nickaleer, Nickaleer?</HI> Directing his Speech to one particular of us, who in Simplicity answered, <HI>Yes.</HI> Which caused the <HI>Cassekey</HI> to ask in the said Person, if another Person, which he pointed to was <HI>Nickaleer</HI>? He answered, <HI>Yes.</HI> Then he said, <HI>To<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>os</HI> (or all) <HI>Nickaleer</HI>; and went from among us: Returning in a short Time, with some of his Men with him, and a fresh they went greedily to strip my <HI>Wife</HI> and <HI>Child, Robert Barrow,</HI> and our <HI>Master,</HI> who had escaped till now. Thus were we left almost Naked, till the Feud was something abat∣ed; and then we got some-what from them, which dis∣pleased some of them. We then cut our Tents in Pieces, and got the most of our Clothing out of it; which the <HI>Indians</HI> perceiving, took the Remains from us. We Men had most of us Breeches, and Pieces of Canvas; and all the Company interceded for my Wife, so that all was
<PB N="10" REF="006658_0018_1029766DEAF96F30"/>
not taken from her. About Noon, the <HI>Indians</HI> having removed all their Plunder off the <HI>Bay,</HI> and many of them gone; a Guard was provided, arm'd with Bows and Arrows, with whom we were summoned to march; and a Burden provided for every one to carry, that was any ways able. Our Master, with his broken Leg, was help'd along by his Negro <HI>Ben.</HI> My Wife was forced to carry her Child, they not suffering any of us to relieve her. But if any of us offered to lay down our Burden, we were threatened to be shot. Thus were we forced along the <HI>Beach</HI> bare-footed.</P>
<P>We had saved one of the <HI>Master's Quadrants,</HI> and <HI>Sed∣mens Calender,</HI> with two other Books. As we walked along the <HI>Bay</HI> (the Time suiting) our Mate, <HI>Richard Limpeney,</HI> took an Observation, and we found our selves to be in the Latitude of twenty seven Degrees and eight Minutes: Some of the <HI>Indians</HI> were offended at it; when he held up his Quadrant to observe, one would draw an Arrow to shoot him; but it pleased God hitherto to prevent them from shedding any of our Blood.</P>
<P>One Passage I have omitted: Two of our <HI>Marriners,</HI> named <HI>Thomas Fowns</HI> and <HI>Richard Limpany,</HI> went forth this Morning, from our Tent, down to the <HI>Bay</HI> where the <HI>Indians</HI> were, and viewing of them at some Distance, an <HI>Indian-Man</HI> came runing upon them, with his Knife in his Hand took hold of <HI>Thomas Fowns</HI> to stab him; but the said <HI>Thomas</HI> fell on his Knees, using a <HI>Spanish</HI> Ceremony, and begged not to kill him, whereupon the <HI>Indian</HI> desisted, and bid him be gone to the Place from whence he came. The said <HI>Thomas</HI> at his Return, ac∣quainted us how narrowly he had escaped.</P>
<P>After we had travelled about five Miles along the deep Sand, the Sun being extream hot, we came to an Inlet: On the other side was the <HI>Indian-Town,</HI> being little <HI>Wigwams,</HI> made of small Poles stuck in the Ground, which they bended one to another, making an Arch, and covered them with Thatch of small <HI>Palmetto</HI> Leaves: Here we were commanded to sit down, and the <HI>Casse∣key</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="006658_0019_10297670EBF203E8"/>
came to us, who with his Hand, scratched a Hole in the Sand, about a Foot deep, and came to Water, which he made Signs for us to come and Drink, we being extream Thirsty, did, but the Water was almost Salt: Whilst we sat here, we saw great Fires making on the other Side of the Inlet, which some of us thought was preparing for us. After an Hours Time being spent here, at length came an <HI>Indian</HI> with a small <HI>Cannoo</HI> from the other Side, and I, with my Wife and Child, and <HI>Robert Barrow,</HI> were ordered to go in; the same <HI>Can∣noo</HI> was but just wide enough for us to sit down in; over we were carried, and being landed, the Man made Signs for us to walk to <HI>Wigwams,</HI> which we did; but the young <HI>Indians</HI> would seem to be frightned, and fly from us. We were directed to a <HI>Wigwam,</HI> which, af∣terwards we understood to be the <HI>Cassekey's</HI>: It was a∣bout a Man's height to the Top; herein was the <HI>Casse∣key's</HI> Wife, and some old Women, sitting on a Cabbin, made of Sticks, about a Foot high, covered with a Mat, they made Signs for us to sit down on the Ground, which we did: The <HI>Cassekey's</HI> Wife having a young Child sucking at her Breast, gave it to another Woman, and would have my Child, which my Wife was very loath to suffer; but she would not be denyed, took our Child and suckled it at her Breast, viewing and feeling it from Top to Toe, at length returned it to my Wife; and by this Time was another Parcel of our People come over; and sitting down by the <HI>Wigwam</HI> Side, our <HI>Indian</HI> brought a Fish boiled, on a <HI>Palmetto</HI> Leaf, and set it down amongst us, making Signs for us to Eat; but our Exercise was too great for us to have any Inclination to receive Food; at length our People were brought over, and afterwards came the <HI>Cassekey</HI>: As soon as he came to his <HI>Wigwam,</HI> he set himself to work, got some stakes, and stuck them in a row, joyning to his <HI>Wigwam,</HI> and tyed some Sticks, whereon were these small <HI>Palmettos,</HI> tyed and fastned them to the stakes, about three Foot high, and layed two or three Mats made of Reeds down by his Shelter; which,
<PB N="12" REF="006658_0020_10297672CCAE3B28"/>
it seems, he made for us, to break the Wind off us, and ordered us to lye down there, which we did, as many as the Mats would hold, the rest lay on the Ground by us; the <HI>Cassekey</HI> went into his <HI>Wigwam,</HI> and seated himself on his Cabin cross-legged; having a Basket of <HI>Palmetto Berries</HI> brought him, which he eat very greedily; after which, came some <HI>Indians</HI> unto him, and talk'd much; Night come on; the Moon being up, an <HI>Indian,</HI> who performeth their Ceremonies, stood out, looking full at the Moon, making a hideous Noise, and crying out, act∣ing like a Mad-man for the Space of half an Hour, all the <HI>Indians</HI> being silent till he had done; after which, they all made a fearful Noise, some like the Barking of a Dogg, or Wolf, and other strange Sounds: After this, one gets a Logg, and sets himself down, holding the stick of Logg upright on the Ground, and several others getting about him, made a hideous Noise, singing to our Amazement; at length their Women joyned Concort, making the Noise more terrible, this they continued till Midnight. Towards Morning was great Dews: Our Fire being expended, we were extream cold.</P>
<P>This Morning the <HI>Cassekey</HI> looking on us with a mild Aspect, sent his Son with a striking Staff to the Inlet, to strike Fish for us, which was performed with great Dexterity, for some of us walked down with him, and though we looked very earnestly when he threw <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Staff from him, could not see a Fish, at which Time he saw it, and brought it on Shore on the End of his Staff. Sometimes he would run swiftly pursuing a Fish, and seldom mist when he darted at him. In two Hours Time he got as many Fish as would serve twenty Men: There were others also Fishing at the same Time, so that Fish was plenty; but the sense of our Conditions, stayed our hungry Stomachs, for some amongst us thought they would feed us, to feed themselves.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cassekey</HI> went this Morning towards our Vessel in his absence the other <HI>Indians</HI> looked very untowardly upon us, which created a Jealousie of their Cruelty yet to come.
<PB N="13" REF="006658_0021_10293C6B21368C58"/>
This Afternoon we saw a great Fire nigh the Place of our Vessel; whereupon we concluded, that our Vessel and our Boat were Burn'd: Whereupon we were almost con∣firmed that they designed to destroy us. About Sun-setting the <HI>Cassekey</HI> came home; we spake to him, he answered us, and seemed very affable, which we liked well: Night drawing on, and the Wind shifting North∣ward, we removed our Shelter, and added the Mats to it to break the Wind off us, which blowed cold, and laid our selves on the Sand. About an Hour within Night came a parcel of <HI>Indians</HI> from the Southward, being all arm'd with <HI>Bow</HI> and <HI>Arrows,</HI> and coming near our Tent, some of us espyed them, whereupon they squatted down: This seemed a fresh Token of Danger, and we awaked those of us that where fallen a sleep, and bid them prepare, for things seemed dangerous, we supposing they were come to forward our Destructi∣on, or to carry us to the Southward; they sat thus a considerable Time; at length they distributed themselves to the <HI>Wigwam:</HI> Thus would Danger often appear un∣to us, and almost swallow us up; but at Times we should be set over it, having a secret Hope, that God would work our Deliverance, having preserved us in so many Perils.</P>
<P>Sometime before Night, <HI>Robert Barrow</HI> was exhorting us to be patient, and in a Godly Manner did he ex∣pound that Text of Scripture, <HI>Because <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> kept the Word of my Patience,</HI> Rev. 3.10 After <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ded with a most fervent Prayer, desiring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that whereas he had suffered us to be cast <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Bar∣barous and Heathenish People, if that it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> blessed Will, He would preserve and deliver us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> amongst them, that our Names might not be buried in Oblivion, and that he might lay his Body amongst Faithful Friends; And at the close of his Prayer, he seem'd to have an Assurance that his Petition would be granted; in all which, some of us were livingly refreshed and streng∣thened.</P>

<P>This Morning we again used our Endeavours with the <HI>Cassekey,</HI> that we might go to the Northward for <HI>Augusteen</HI>; his Answer was, We should be all kill'd, but at length we prevailed, and he said on the Morning we should go: Hereupon, he took three Negro-Men (one of <HI>Joseph Kirle's,</HI> and two of mine) and with a <HI>Cannoo</HI> went up the Sound</P>
<P>This Day the <HI>Indians</HI> were busie with what they had taken out of our Vessel, and would have imployed all of us to do, some one thing, some another, for them; but we not knowing the Consequence endeavoured to shun it, and would deny their demands. But some of our Men did answer their desires in making and sewing some Cloth together, stringing our Beds, mending of Locks, of the Chefts, &amp;c. What ever they thought was a-miss they would be putting upon us to mend, till we wholly refused; at which Time I heard a saving, that came from one of the Chief <HI>Indians,</HI> thus (<HI>English Son of a Bitch</HI>) which Word startted me; for I did believe they had had some of our Nation in their Possession, of whom they had heard such an Expression<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: I passed away from the <HI>Wig∣wam</HI> in much trouble.</P>
<P>This Day being the first of the Week, we having a large Bible, and a Book of <HI>Robert Barclay's,</HI> some one or other was often reading in them: But being most of us sat together, <HI>Robert Barrow</HI> desired our People to wai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>; in which Time <HI>Robert</HI> had a Word in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> us, and afterwards went to Prayer, all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Mocking, but not to our Disturbance: The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt stood very modestly the whole Time: After <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>yer ended, they all withdrew quietly: But some of the (especially the <HI>Cassekey's</HI> eldest Son) would take great delight in our Reading, and would take the Bible, or other Book, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd give to one or other to read; the Sound of which pleased them; for they would sit quietly, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ery attentively, to hear us.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="006658_0023_1029767EDF8F1DE8"/>The <HI>Cassekey</HI> having been gone the most Part of the Day, with three Negroes in our Boat coming over the Bar into the Inlet: We rejoiced to see Our Boat, for we thought she had been burn'd. Our Negroes told us, they went up the Sound with the <HI>Cassekey</HI> and landed near the Place where our Tent had been: The chief Business was, to remove the Money from one Place to another, and bury it. This old Man would trust our People, but not his own. After that was done, they went to the Place where our Vessel was burn'd: They lanched our Boat, in which the old <HI>Cassekey</HI> put his Chests, wherein was our Linnen, and other of our Things. Also they got a small Runlet, which they filled with Wine out of a Quarter-Cask that was left; and brought Sugar out of the Wreck, which was not consumed with the Fire. By this Time came the <HI>Cassekey,</HI> and other Negro, in the Cannoo. He told us, on the Morrow we should go with our Boat: This was chearful News unto us. All the Time some <HI>Indians</HI> had been out, and brought home some <HI>Oysters</HI>; and the <HI>Cassekey</HI> gave us some, bidding us, take what we had Mind to. A little before Night, the <HI>Cassekey</HI> opened his Chest and and Boxes: And his Wife came, and took what was in them from him. But he seem'd very generous to my Wife and Child, and gave her several Things which were useful to her and our Child.</P>

<P>The <HI>Cassekey,</HI> and some other <HI>Indians,</HI> went with our People towards our Wreck, we rowing along Shore, and our Boat very leaky, that one Person had employ enough to heave out the Water.</P>
<P>Just before we left the <HI>Indians-Town,</HI> several <HI>Indians</HI> were for taking the little Cloths and Rags we had got; but calling out to the <HI>Cassekey,</HI> he would cause them to let us alone.</P>
<P><HI>Solomon Cresson</HI> was mightly in one <HI>Indian's</HI> Favour, who would hardly stir from his <HI>Wigwam</HI> but <HI>Solomon</HI> must be with him, and go Arm in Arm; which <HI>Indian,</HI> amongst his Plunder, had a Morning-Gown, which he put on <HI>Solomon,</HI> and <HI>Solomon</HI> had worn it most of the Time we were there; but when the Time of our Depar∣ture came, an <HI>Indian</HI> unrob'd him, and left only a pair of Breeches and seem'd very angry.</P>
<P>It was high Noon when we left our Wreck (she be∣ing burn'd down to her Floor-Timbers which lay in the Sand) we setting forward, some in the Boat, the rest travelled along Shore; and a little before Sunsetting our People came up with Abundance of small Fish that had been forced on Shore, as we may suppose, by the Storm that drove us a Shore (they lying far from the Water and being much tainted) covered the Shore for nigh a Mile in length, of which our People gathered as many as they could carry: About Sunsetting we put on Shore to refresh our selves, and take a small Respite, also to take my Kinsman, <HI>Benjamin Allen,</HI> into our Boat; For this Afternoon, in his Travel, he was taken with a Fever
<PB N="17" REF="006658_0025_10297681F017DFD8"/>
and Ague, and we had much Trouble to get him along, he having been sick nigh unto Death (being first taken, the Day before we left <HI>Blewfield's</HI> Roads) until about a Week before we were cast away.</P>
<P>One of my <HI>Negroes</HI> had saved a Tinder-box and Flint, and we had reserved two Knives, by which means we got a Fire, though with much difficulty, for our Tinder was bad, and all the Wood Salt-Water-Soaken; which being ac∣complished, we broiled all our Fish, feeding heartily on some of them, and the rest we kept, not knowing when we should be thus furnished again; for which, some of us were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y thankful to the God of all our Mercies.</P>
<P>Having a large Fire, many of us got under the Lee of it; and others buried themselves in the Sand, in Hopes to get a little sleep, that we might be somewhat refreshed, and thereby be the better enabled, some to travel, and some to Row, the remaining part of the Night; but the Sand-Flies, and <HI>Musketoes,</HI> were so extream thick, it was impossible: The Moon Shining, we launced our Boat, I, and my Wife, and Child, the Master, <HI>Robert Barrow,</HI> my Kinsman <HI>Allen, Solomon Cresson, Joseph Buckley,</HI> and the Master's <HI>Negro,</HI> went in our Boat, the rest travelled along Shore: About mid∣night, or a little after, our People came by an <HI>Indian</HI>-Town; the <HI>Indians</HI> came out in a great Number, but offered no Violence, more than endeavouring to take from them what little they had; but making some small resistance, the <HI>Indians</HI> were put by their purpose: They were very desirous to have us come on shore, and would hale us, but our People would have us keep off: We were got among a parcel of Breakers, and so had much a do to get out to Sea</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>29</HI>th of the <HI>7</HI>th Month; the <HI>3</HI>d of the Week.</HEAD>
<P>This Morning about Sun-rising we stood in for the Land, and looked out for our People, but could not see them, there∣fore we lay by for the space of two Hours, and at length saw them coming along and a great many <HI>Indians</HI> with them. When they came a breast of us, the <HI>Indians</HI> wasted us a shore, but we refused, perceiving they were wickedly bent;
<PB N="18" REF="006658_0026_102976867931E438"/>
they would be ever and anon snatching one thing or other▪ at which time our People would point to us in the Boat; but perceiving they could not get us ashore, in some few Hours left them.</P>
<P>This Day at Noon, <HI>Joseph Kirle</HI> having his Quadrant and Calendar, took an Observation, being in the Latitude of 27 Deg. 45 Min. About one a Clock we saw two <HI>In∣dians,</HI> with Bows and Arrows, running to meet our People; who, when they saw them, at first they made a halt, and afterwards retreated, at which the <HI>Indians</HI> let fly an Arrow, which narrowly escaped one of them; whereupon they stop∣p'd, the <HI>Indians</HI> look'd strangely on them, but our People set forwards, and the <HI>Indians</HI> with them, until they came to the <HI>Indian-Town</HI>: We saw our People go into the <HI>Wigwams,</HI> but stayed a very short time, for the <HI>Indians</HI> were for taking those pieces of Canvas they had, from them. They got some Water and set forward again; the two <HI>In∣dians</HI> still followed them▪ About this Time we saw a Sail to the Eastward, and we supposing it at first to be a <HI>Brigantius,</HI> agreed to follow her; but in a small Time, we made it to be a Cannoo or Boat, with two Masts and Sail: She stood in for the Shore, but as soon as they espyed us, she bore away; and when she saw we made not after her, she stood ashore again for the <HI>Indian-Town</HI>; hereupon a Jealousie got amongst us, that she might go on Shore, and get strong with Men, and come after us, whereupon we rowed very hard, and kept an offing for some Hours; but finding they came not out, we stood towards the Shore again. This Day was extream hot, and we had no Water since we left the <HI>Indian-Town,</HI> to the Southward of our Wreck, called by the Name of <HI>Hoe-Bay,</HI> therefore we were desirous to get on Shore; but when we endeavoured it we could not, for the Seas swelled very much, and came rowling from the Eastward, so that the Seas run very hollow, and broke almost a Mile from the Shore; our Master said, <HI>It was impossible to get on shore alive</HI>: But I being under some Exercise, was desirous to be on Shore, and thereupon did express my self to the rest of our People, they started

the Danger, all which I was as sensible of as they; yet I could not rest, but insisted on going a shore: The Ma∣ster and Men said, <HI>We should not save our lives:</HI> But I gained so far, that they attempted, and were got with∣in half a Mile of a shore; but the Seas came on us so large and hollow, that one Sea had like to have overwhelmed us, we just got a Top of it, before it broke; there was then no perswading them to go further, but we stood off, and designed to keep off all Night, our People being very weary, and the Sun setting, we divided one half to get some Sleep, the other to watch, and keep the Boat's head to the Sea. The weather looked as though it would be bad, and the Sea increased, whereupon I began a-fresh to perswade them to go on shore; all were desirous, but thought it impossible; at length we resolved to venture, and so committing our selves to the Protection of the Almighty God, We stood in for the shore, and made Signs to our People that we designed it. And it pleased God to order it so, that we went on shore, as though there had been a Lane made through the Breakers, and were carried to the Top of the Bank, where we got aged <HI>Robert Bar∣row,</HI> my Wife and Child out of the Boat, before ever a Sea came to fill us; which it did, as soon as they were got out: But we got our Boat up from the wash of the Sea.</P>
<P>The two <HI>Indians</HI> were for taking off our Clothes, (which would not cover our Bodies) but we not being willing to yield, they would snatch a piece from one, and a bit from another, and run away with that, and than come again and do the like. These two <HI>Indians</HI> took away what was given to my Wife and Child, which we knew not how to help, but exercised Patience.</P>
<P>We enquired how far it was from <HI>St. Lucia</HI> (one of them speaking a little <HI>Spanish</HI>) and by Signs we under∣stood it was not far. They made Signs that when we came there, we should be put to most cruel Death, but we hoped otherwise.</P>
<P>At this Place, within the Land, and over the Sound,
<PB N="20" REF="006658_0028_10297689BB2C9AF8"/>
our People said, before it was dark, they saw two or three Houses which looked white, as tho' they were plaistered with Lime, which put us in hopes that there were <HI>Spaniards</HI> there; so we set forwards, as the <HI>Indians</HI> directed, for <HI>St. Lucia</HI>; they made Signs that we should come to an Inlet of the Sea, and on the other side was <HI>St. Lucia.</HI> We travelled about four Miles, and came to an Inlet, but saw no Settlement on the other side, so we concluded to lye there all night: We saw the tract of a large <HI>Bear,</HI> and other wild <HI>Beasts</HI> whereupon we set to work to get Wood, and then a Fire: Abundance of <HI>Muskit∣toes</HI> and <HI>Sand-flyes</HI> hindred our Rest; to Remedy which, we digged holes in the Sand, got some Grass, and laid it therein to lye upon, in order to cover ourselves from the Flyes, which most of us did; but it being extream Cold, and Firing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, we had little Comfort.</P>
<P>About Mid-night we sent our People to see if they could get off our Boat, and bring it into the <HI>Inlet</HI> that we might get over to the other side: They went and Launched her but the Sea was so rough, that there was no pos∣sibility of getting her off; for she was soon filled, and they put to swim; and they, Boat and all, were driven on Shore again.</P>
<P>Whilst our People were gone for the Boat, we espied some <HI>Indian</HI> in a Cannoo, with their Torch, a Fishing; we sent for <HI>Solomon,</HI> (who was gone to Launch the Boat) expecting they would come, seeing Fires, and we should not tell what to say to them; but they did not. Here we lay watching, for no rest could be taken.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>30</HI>th of the <HI>7</HI>th Month; the <HI>2</HI>d Day of the Week.</HEAD>
<P>This Morning, by break of Day, we saw a small <HI>Cannoo</HI> from the other side, put off Shore, with two <HI>Indians</HI> in her, going up the River (or Sound) a Fishing. We hailed them in <HI>Spanish,</HI> and as soon as they heard and saw us, they made to the Shore with all speed, and away to their
<PB N="21" REF="006658_0029_1029768E4042AE50"/>
Town they run. We, perceiving they were shy of us, be∣gan to doubt of their Amity, which we had so much de∣pended on; whereupon we counselled our People how to deport themselves, especially our <HI>Negroes.</HI> About Sun-rising we saw the <HI>Indians</HI> coming, running in a very great Number, with their <HI>Bows</HI> and <HI>Arrows,</HI> to the Inlet; where, having five or six <HI>Cannoos,</HI> they got into them, as many as those <HI>Cannoos</HI> could hold; others took the Water, and swam over unto us: They came in the greatest Rage that possibly a Barbarous People could. <HI>Solomon</HI> be∣gan to speak <HI>Spanish</HI> to them; but they answered not till they came a Shore, some distance from us; and then coming running upon us, they cryed out, <HI>Nickaleer, Nicka∣leer?</HI> We sat all still, expecting Death, and that in a most barbarous Manner They that did speak unto them could not be heard: But they rushed violently on us, rending and tearing those few Clothes we had; they that had Breeches had so many about them, that they hardly touched the Ground, till they were shaken out of them; they tore all from my Wife; and espying her Hair-Lace, some were going to cut the Hair, away to get it; but, like greedy Dogs, another snatched and tore it off. As for our poor young <HI>Child,</HI> they snatched from it what little it had, as though they would have shaken and torn it, Limb from Limb. After they had taken all from us but our Lives, they began to talk one to another, vehe∣mently Foaming at the Mouth, like wild <HI>Boars,</HI> and taking their <HI>Bows</HI> and <HI>Arrows,</HI> with other <HI>Weapons,</HI> cryed out, <HI>Nickaleer, Nickaleer, Solomon</HI> spake in <HI>Spanish</HI> to them, and said, We were <HI>Spaniards</HI>: But they would not hear him, and continued crying out <HI>Nickaleer, Nickaleer</HI>; withal drawing their <HI>Arrows</HI> to the Head. But suddenly we per∣ceived them to look about and listen, and then desisted to prosecute their bloody Design. One of them took a pair of Breeches, and gave it to my Wife. We brought our great Bible, and a large <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Robert Barclay's,</HI> to this Place. And being all stripped as Naked as we were
<PB N="22" REF="006658_0030_10297694489422F0"/>
born, and endeavouring to hide our Nakedness, these <HI>Canibals</HI> took the <HI>Books,</HI> and tearing out the Leaves, would give each of us a Leaf to cover us; which we took from them: At which Time they would deride and smite us, and instantly another of them would snatch a∣way what the other gave us, smiting and deriding us withal.</P>
<P><HI>Robert Barrow,</HI> with my self, Wife and Child, were ordered to go into a <HI>Cannoo,</HI> to be carried to the other Side of the <HI>Inlet,</HI> being a Furlong over; four <HI>Indians</HI> being in the <HI>Cannoo</HI> to paddle: When we came to the other Side, within a <HI>Cannoo's</HI> length of two of the Shore, a Number of <HI>Indians,</HI> with their <HI>Bows</HI> and <HI>Arrows,</HI> came running into the Water, some to their Knees, some deeper, having their <HI>Bows</HI> and <HI>Arrows</HI> drawn up, crying out, <HI>Nickaleer, Nickaleer</HI>; which they continued without ceasing. The <HI>Indians</HI> that brought us over leap'd out of the <HI>Can∣noo,</HI> and swam a Shore, fearing they should be shot. But in this Juncture it pleased God to tender the Hearts of some of them towards us, especially the <HI>Cassekey's</HI> Wife, and some of the chiefest amongst them, who were made In∣struments to intercede for us, and stop the Rage of the Multitude, who seem'd not to be satisfy'd without our Blood. The <HI>Casseekey</HI> ordered some to swim, and fetch the <HI>Cannoo</HI> a Shore; which being done, his Wife came in a Com∣passionate Manner and took my Wife out of the <HI>Can∣noo,</HI> ordering her to follow her, which we did some distance from the Inlet Side, and stood till all our People were brought over, which in a little Time was done. But the Rage of some was still great, thirsting to shed our Blood; and a mighty Strife there was amongst them; some would kill us, others would prevent it: And thus one <HI>In∣dian</HI> was striving with another. All being got over, were to walk along the Sea-Shore to their Town. In this Passage we, most of us, felt the Rage of some of them, either by striking or stoning; and divers <HI>Arrows</HI> were shot: But those that were for Preserving us, would watch those that were for destroying us: And when some of them
<PB N="23" REF="006658_0031_10297695CF58F098"/>
would go to shoot, others of them would catch hold of their Bows or Arms. It was so ordered, that not one of us was touched with their Arrows; several of us were knock'd down, and some tumbled into the Sea; we dared not help one another, but help we had by some of them, being made instrumental to help us. My Wife received several Blows; and an <HI>Indian</HI> came and took hold of her Hair, and was going either to cut her Throat, or some∣thing like it, having his Knife nigh her Throat; but I looked at him, making a sign that he should not; so he desisted. At which Time another <HI>Indian</HI> came, with a handful of Sea-Sand, and filled our poor Child's Mouth. By this Time the <HI>Cassekey's</HI> Wife, came to my Wife, seeing her op∣pressed, and they pulled the Sand out of our Child's Mouth, and kept by my Wife untill we got into the <HI>Cassakey's</HI> House, which was about Forty <HI>Foot</HI> long, and Twenty-five <HI>Foot</HI> wide, covered with <HI>Palmetto</HI> Leaves both Top and sides. There was a Range of Cabbins, or a <HI>Barbecue,</HI> on one side and two Ends: At the entering on one Side of the House, a Passage was made of Benches on each Side, lead∣ing to the Cabbins. On these Benches sat the chief <HI>In∣dians,</HI> and at the upper End of the Cabbin was the <HI>Cas∣sekey</HI> seated. A kind of Debate was held amongst them for an Hour's Time. After which <HI>Solomon,</HI> and some others were called to the <HI>Cassekey,</HI> and were seated on the Cab∣bin; where the <HI>Cassekey</HI> talked to <HI>Solomon</HI> in the <HI>Spanish</HI> Language, but could not hold a Discourse. In a little Time some raw <HI>Deer-Skins</HI> were brought in, and given to my Wife, and Negro-Women; and to us Men such as the <HI>Indians</HI> wear, being a Piece of Platt-work of a kind of Silk-Grass wrought of divers Colours, and of a trian∣gular Figure, with a Belt of four Fingers broad of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> same, wrought together, which goeth about the Waste▪ and the Angle of the other having a thing to it, com∣ing between the Legs; and Strings to the Ends of the Belt. All three meeting together, are fastned behind with a <HI>Horse-Tail,</HI> or a Bunch of <HI>Silk-Grass,</HI> exactly resembling it▪ of a Flaxen Colour. This being all the Apparel or
<PB N="24" REF="006658_0032_10297698DB3D7AF0"/>
Covering that the Men wear; and thus they Clothed us▪ A Place was appointed for us, Mats being laid on the Floor of the House, where we were ordered to lye down. But the Place was extreame nasty; for all the Stones of the Berries which they eat, and all the Nastness that's made amongst them, lay on their Floor, that the Place swarmed with abundance of many Sorts of creeping things; as, a large black hairy <HI>Spider,</HI> which hath two Claws like a Carb, <HI>Scorpions,</HI> and numberless Number of small <HI>Buggs.</HI> On these Mats we lay, these Vermin crawling over our naked Bodies. To brush them off, was like driving of <HI>Mus∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ittoes</HI> from one, where they are extreame thick. The <HI>Indians</HI> were seated, as aforesaid, the <HI>Cassekey</HI> at the up∣per End of them; and the Range of Cabbins was fill'd with Men, Women and Children, beholding us: At length we heard a Women or two cry, according to their Manner, and that very sorrowfully, one of which I took to be the <HI>Cassekey's</HI> Wife, which occasioned some of us to think, that something extraordinary was to be done to us. We heard a strange Sort of a Noise, which was not like the Noise made by a Man, but we could not understand what, nor where it was; for sometimes it sounded to be in one Part of the House, sometimes in another, to which we had an Ear: And indeed our Ears and Eyes could perceive or hear nothing, but what was Strange and Dismal, and Death seem'd to sorround us; but Time discovered this Noise unto us. The Occasion of it was thus: In one Part of this House where the Fire was kept, was an <HI>Indian</HI> Man, having a Pot on the Fire, wherein he was making a Drink, of the Leaves of a Shrub (which we understood afterwards by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> is called <HI>Casseena</HI>) boyling the said Leaves, after they had parched them in a Pot; then with a Gourd, having a long Neck, and at the Top of it a small Hole, which the Top of one's Fin∣ger could cover, and at the Side of it a round Hole of two Inches Diameter; they take the Liquor out of the Pot, and put it into a deep <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound Bowl, which being al∣most filled, containeth nigh three Gallons: With this Gourd
<PB N="25" REF="006658_0033_1029769BDE6718A8"/>
they brew the Liquor, and make it froth very much; it looketh of a deep brown Colour. In the Brewing of this Liquor was this Noise made, which we thought strange; for the pressing of this Gourd gently down into the Liquor, and the Air which is contained, being forced out of the little hole at Top, occasioned a Sound, which according to the Time and motion given, would be various. This Drink, when made, and cool to Sup, was in a Conck-Shell, first carried to the <HI>Cassekey,</HI> who threw Part of it on the Ground, and the rest he drank up, and then would make a loud H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m; and afterwards the Cup passed to the rest of the <HI>Cassekey's</HI> Associaties, as aforesaid; but no other Man, Woman nor Child, must touch or taste of this Sort of Drink; of which he sat Sipping, Chat∣tering and smoaking Tobacco, or some other Herb in∣stead thereof, for the most Part of the Day.</P>
<P>About Noon was some Fish brought us on small <HI>Pal∣metto</HI> Leaves, being boiled with Scales, Heads and Gills, and nothing taken from them but the Guts, but our Trou∣bles and Exercise were such, that we cared not for Food.</P>
<P>In the Evening, we being laid on the Place aforesaid, the <HI>Indians</HI> made a Drum of a Skin, covering therewith the deep Bowl, in which they brewed their Drink, beating thereon with a Stick, and having a couple of Rattles, made of small Gourds put on Sticks with small Stones in, shak∣ing them, they began to set up a most hideous howling, very irksome to us, and sometime after came some of their Young Women, some Singing, some Dancing. This was contined till Mid-night, after which they went to Sleep.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>1</HI>st of the <HI>8</HI>th Month; the <HI>5</HI>th of the Week.</HEAD>
<P>This Day the <HI>Cassekey</HI> looking on us pleasantly, made Presents to some of us, especially to my Wife; he gave her a Parcel of Shell-Fish, which are known by the Name of <HI>Clamms</HI>; one or two, he roasted and gave her, shewing that she must serve the rest so, and eat them. The <HI>Indian</HI> Women would take our Child and Suckle it, for its Mother's Milk was almost gone, that it could not get a Meal: And our Child, which had been at Death's
<PB N="26" REF="006658_0034_1029769EEB604750"/>
Door, from the Time of its Birth, until we were cast away, began now to be Cheerful, and have an Appetite to Food; it had no covering but a small Piece of raw Dear-Skin, not a Shred of Linen or Woolen to put on it.</P>
<P>About the tenth Hour, we observed the <HI>Indians</HI> to be on a sudden Motion; most of the Principal of them be∣took themselves to their Houses; the <HI>Cassekey</HI> went to Dres∣sing his Head, and Painting himself, and so did all the rest: When they had done, they came into the <HI>Cassekey's</HI> House, and seated themselves in Order: In a small Time after came an <HI>Indian</HI> with some Attendance into the House, making a Ceremonious Motion, and seated himself by the <HI>Cassekey,</HI> the Persons that came with him seated themselves amongst the others: After some small pause, the <HI>Cassekey</HI> began a Discourse, which held nigh an Hour; After which the Strange <HI>Indian</HI> and his Companions went forth to the Water-Side, unto their <HI>Cannoo,</HI> lying in the Sound, and returned presently with such Presents as they had brought, delivering them unto the <HI>Cassekey,</HI> and those sitting by giving an Applause. The Presents were some few Bunches of the Herb they make their Drink of, and another Herb which they use instead of <HI>Tobacco,</HI> and some platted Balls, stuffed with Moss, to lay their Heads on, instead of Pillows: The Ceremony being ended, they all seated themselves again, and went to Drinking <HI>Casseena,</HI> Smoaking and Talk∣ing, during the Strangers stay.</P>
<P>About Noon some Fish was brought us; Hunger was grown stronger upon us, and the Quaintity given was not much more than each a Mouthful, which we Eat; The <HI>Cassekey</HI> ordered the Master, <HI>Joseph Kirle, Solomon Cres∣son,</HI> my Wife and me, to sit upon their Cabin to eat our Fish; and they gave us some of their Berries to Eat: We tasted them▪ but not one amongst us could suffer them to stay in our Mouths, for we could compare the taste of them to nothing else, but rotten Cheese steep'd with <HI>Tobacco.</HI> Sometime after we had eaten, some of the <HI>Indian,</HI> asked us, If we were <HI>Spaniards? Solomon</HI> answered
<PB N="27" REF="006658_0035_102976A094166908"/>
them, <HI>Yes.</HI> Then some of the <HI>Indians</HI> would point to those whose Hair was Black, or of a deep Brown, and say such a one was a <HI>Spaniard</HI> of the <HI>Havana,</HI> and such of <HI>Augusteen</HI>; but those whose Hair was of a light Colour, they were doubtful of; some would say they were no <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>About the third Hour in the Afternoon, the Strangers went away, and some small Time after, they having satis∣fied themselves that most of us were <HI>Spaniards,</HI> told us that we should be sent for to the next Town; and they told us that there was a <HI>Nickaleer</HI> off, and we understood them [<HI>English Men of</HI> Bristol] also the Number of six Men and a Woman; and that they were to be put to Death before we should get thither. We were silent, altho' much concerned to hear that Report: They also told us, that a Messenger would come for us, to direct us to the next Town, thence to <HI>Augusteen.</HI> Night coming on, they be∣took themselves to their accustomed Singing and Dancing.</P>
<P>About the tenth or twelfth Hour in the Night, before the Singing and Dancing was ended, came in a Stranger armed with Bow and Arrows; the <HI>Cassekey</HI> and his Com∣panions entertained him with half an Hours Discourse, which ended, we were on a sudden ordered to get up, and hurried away with this Stranger, they not giving us Time to see if we were altogether, and a Troop of young <HI>Indian-Men</HI> and Boys followed us for about four Miles, all which way they pelted us with Stones: At length they all left us except two and our Guide; but we missed <HI>So∣lomon Cresson</HI> and <HI>Joseph Kirle's</HI> Boy, and Negro <HI>Ben,</HI> which was no small Trouble to us. We had not tra∣velled above five Miles, before our Guide caused us to stop, and at some small distance was an <HI>Indian-Town</HI>▪ which I suppose our Guide belonged to; for <HI>Indians</HI> cam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thence with Fire and Water for him, and with <HI>Palmett<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>▪ Leaves they made a blast of Fire; here we stayed nigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> two Hours: The Flies were very thick, and the Night very Cold, so that our naked Bodies were not able to endure it, but with Grief. At length we left the Place; the whole Night following we were troubled with these two young

<HI>Indians,</HI> who at Times would be abusing one or other of us, singling them out, and asking if they were not <HI>Nickaleer,</HI> or <HI>English</HI>? If they said, <HI>nay,</HI> then they would hit them a Blow or more with a Truncheon, which they had; and said, they were. We travelled all Night without stop∣ping, from the aforesaid Place.</P>

<P>After Sun-rising, we came up with the Wreck of the Vessel that we heard was cast away. She was Staved all to Piece; for her <HI>Keelson</HI> was driven a Shore. We saw <HI>Suger-Hogsheads, Ginger</HI> and <HI>Logwood,</HI> which gave us to suppose, that it was one of our Fleet; and we thought it to be either <HI>Borroughs</HI> or <HI>Smith,</HI> belonging to <HI>Bristol.</HI> A Mile or more from hence we came to an <HI>Inlet</HI>; our Guide told us, we must swim over, except my <HI>Wife</HI> and <HI>Robert Barrow</HI>; but we signified that we could not: He carried <HI>Robert Barrow, Joseph Kirle, Me,</HI> my <HI>Wife</HI> and Child, over first; and at length the whole Company: For it was a great way over. By that Time we were all over; the Day was hot, and my Wife quite tired and faint; as also <HI>Robert Barrow,</HI> and <HI>Joseph Kirle,</HI> whose Leg was grown so painful, that it overcame him. We got under a Grape-Bush for shelter from the Sun; I sent one of my <HI>Negroes</HI> to seek for Water for them, but there was none to be had; but he got some Seaside Grapes; which, with resting, refresh'd the Weak and Lame.</P>
<P>Our Guide was for forcing us forward; so we travel∣led about four or five Miles further, and met with the <HI>Cassekey</HI> of this Town, and <HI>Commander</HI> of the Northern Part of this Coast. He was an ancient Man, his Beard and Hair gray: He enquired for the Captain, so our People pointed to <HI>Joseph Kirle,</HI> whom he went to, and embraced him; then he asked for our <HI>Mate,</HI> or <HI>Pilot.</HI> This Man could speak <HI>Spanish</HI> better than any we had met with; but not so well as to Discourse, only to ask some Questions; and we had three or four amongst us could make a shift to answer him; for <HI>Solomon</HI> was kept behind. This old <HI>Cassekey</HI> seemed to have Compassion
<PB N="29" REF="006658_0037_102976A81AA28EC8"/>
on us, and said, That those People, who had served us thus, in stripping of us, were <HI>Rogoues</HI>: But we were his <HI>Comerades</HI> or <HI>Friends.</HI> Withal he said, in few Days he would carry us to <HI>Augusteen</HI>; and thereupon he told us of six <HI>English-Men,</HI> and one Woman, being at his Town. We enquired, if he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntended them for <HI>Augusteen</HI>? But he would shake his Head, and point to the Southward, saying, <HI>Nickaleer</HI> no <HI>Comerade (Englishmen</HI> were not his <HI>Friends</HI>) Which Words were unpleasant to us. This People kept us Company till we came within a Mile or two of their Town, and then they left us; they, going faster, got in before us. Their Town stood about half a Mile from the Sea-Shore, within the Land, on the Sound, being sur∣rounded with a <HI>Swamp,</HI> in which grew <HI>white Man∣grove-Trees,</HI> which hid the <HI>Town</HI> from the Sea. We were directed to the <HI>Cassekey's</HI> House, which was large, and filled with <HI>Indians</HI>; and then ordered to sit down. The old <HI>Cassekey</HI> fetched some Water, and washed <HI>Ro∣bert Barrow's</HI> Feet, and my <HI>Wife's</HI>: After which he got some <HI>Canvas</HI> and <HI>Crocus Ginger-Bags,</HI> which they had got out of the Vessel that was cast on Shore, which was distributed among us. <HI>Joseph Kirle</HI> had a Coat given him, which they had taken from the People of the other Vessel, but it was rent down the back. My Wife had two Pieces of <HI>Sail-Canvas</HI> given her. And I, with others, had a <HI>Crocus Ginger-Bag.</HI> They gave a Piece of an old Check Linen Shirt, the Big∣ness of a small Hankerchief, to cover our <HI>Child</HI>: This was all our Clothing. <HI>Robert Barrow</HI> and my Wife were quite spent with travelling barefooted on the hot Sand, having bruised their Feet; and with Stumps, Stones, and Prickles their Feet, especially <HI>Robert Bar∣row's,</HI> had holes in them, that one might have put the Top of one's Thumb in. We were directed to lye down on a Cabin. The other Vessel's Company were, one <HI>John Smith,</HI> Master of the <HI>Nan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>witch,</HI> a <HI>Barque</HI> belonging to <HI>Bristol,</HI> which came out of <HI>Jamaica</HI> with

us, with five Men, and one Woman, <HI>viz. Andrew Mur∣ray,</HI> Merchant, <HI>Andrew Barnes,</HI> Mate, <HI>Hugh Allen, John Osler, John Shears,</HI> and <HI>Cornelius Toker,</HI> Two Boys, and a Woman Passenger, named <HI>Penelope.</HI> We took an Opportunity to discourse them. They were cast away the same Night we were, and their Ves∣sel being forced by the Storm, (they not being able for two Days before to carry any Sail) on Shore; they got into their Boat, and so on Shore: And in a small Time was a great Part of their Wreck driven on Shore; amongst which was a Barrel or more of Water, some Barrels of Beef or Pork, with their Chests, and many other Things which they got. On the Morrow they designed to travel to the Northward: But <HI>Andrew Barnes,</HI> their Mate, having been along Time afflicted with a Flux, which had wasted his Body to Skin and Bone, so that he was not able to help himself, they left him, and travelled a Mile or more, and came to the Inlet, which they could not pass: Whereupon they returned back again, to take their Boat; but at their Return, before they could get away with their Boat, they espyed the <HI>Indians</HI> coming on them, who soon got to them; asked in <HI>Spanish,</HI> What Nation they were? If <HI>Spaniards, English</HI> or <HI>French</HI>? But the <HI>Indians</HI> made Signs to give them their Clothing, which they readily did. But still they enquired, Of what <HI>Nation</HI>? At first they answered <HI>Spaniards</HI>; but the Natives looked so furiously, that they soon answered them, <HI>English-Men.</HI> Thereupon every one had it, <HI>Nickaleer, Nickaleer.</HI> And then they very eagerly stripp'd them of all they had on: After which they drove them away to the Northward, unto their Town; but <HI>Andrew Barnes</HI> being not able to stand nor go, was left behind; after they had strip∣p'd him on the Land naked, when they were driven away. Before they got to the Town, the <HI>Indian Cas∣se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y</HI> gave them some Clothing, and no violence of∣fered to their Persons. They had plenty of Fish and

Berries to the Time of our coming? <HI>John Smith</HI> and <HI>Andrew Murray</HI> had their Being in the <HI>Cassekey's</HI> House, and the Woman, named <HI>Penelope</HI>: The rest of <HI>Smith</HI>'s People lodged in other <HI>Indian-Houses.</HI> But on our coming, the old <HI>Cassekey</HI> told them, They must turn out, and make Room for the <HI>Spaniards</HI>: But <HI>Smith</HI> and <HI>Murray</HI> would not go; and the <HI>Indian</HI> did not force them out. In some Time after we had been in the House, came in an <HI>Indian-Woman,</HI> loaden with Baskets of Berries, mostly of the <HI>Palm</HI>; some Sea-Side <HI>Coco-Plumbs,</HI> and Sea-Side Grapes. Of the two latter we could eat, but of the Palm Berries we could not bear the Taste in our Mouths. We laid our selves on the <HI>Cabin,</HI> on that Part which was appointed us; on the other Part, the young <HI>Cassekey</HI> or <HI>King,</HI> lay; being parted by a Chest that stood thereon. Before Night was a Parcel of large Fish, called Drumms, brought in; the old <HI>Cassekey</HI> told <HI>Joseph Kirle,</HI> That those were for the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and bid him let some-body dress them: He also ordered us a Pot. They were soon dress'd, and we eat them. Night being come, the old <HI>Cassekey</HI> enquired after our Losses; which we, as well as we could, gave him to understand, that in our Vessel was a great deal of Clothing and Money, which the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Hoebay</HI> had taken from us! He understood so much of the Matter, that he grew covet∣ous, and said, he would go and get some of it from them.</P>
<P>About Midnight came <HI>Solomon Cresson</HI> in a <HI>Cannoo,</HI> with two <HI>Indians:</HI> The old <HI>Cassekey</HI> began to examine him concerning our Vessel, Goods and Money, or Plate; of which <HI>Solomon</HI> render'd a further Account unto him, than we could: Which caused him to re∣solve, on the Morrow to provide Men and Boats, and to go down the Sound to <HI>Hoebay,</HI> to have Part from them. He would have had <HI>Solomon</HI> to have gone with him, but <HI>Solomon</HI> refused.</P>
<P>We enquired of <HI>Solomon</HI> concerning his stay, and of
<PB N="32" REF="006658_0040_102976AFDEBFD768"/>
the Negro <HI>Ben</HI> and <HI>Joseph Kirle</HI>'s Boy: He said, that he was stayed by force; but the <HI>Negro</HI> and the <HI>Boy</HI> were asleep in another House when we were driven away. They had a design, in staying of <HI>Solomon,</HI> which he could not rightly understand, but supposed, that they doubted that we were not all <HI>Spaniards</HI>; for the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>St. Lucia</HI> would say to <HI>Solomon,</HI> that he was a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and some others, but the most of us were not <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and that they had stolen <HI>Solomon</HI>: But <HI>Solomon</HI> denyed it.</P>

<P>This Morning the Wind was violent with Rain; the King's House was knee deep with Water, and like to continue rising; I removed with my Wife, Child, <HI>Robert Barrow</HI> and <HI>Benjamin Allen,</HI> to an <HI>In∣dian-Hause</HI> that stood on a Hill of Oyster-shells; in this House we remained this Day: The Wind con∣tinuing at <HI>North-East</HI> very violent, and by Reason of much Rain, the Water rising every Hour, the <HI>In∣dians</HI> began to put their dry Berries into their Cannoos, and to seek which way to secure them. Several <HI>Indians</HI> betook themselves to their Boats and carried what they had to some high Land at a considerable Distance, where a Place was made for their <HI>Cassekey</HI> or King; but before Day, the House we were in was a Float, and the <HI>In∣dians</HI> were for turning us out, bidding us take an old

Cannoo, that had a hole in the side of her, almost at the bottom, big enough for a Man to put his hand through, so that she was full of Water; in this Cannoo they would have had us shift for our selves, but we were not willing to go; the <HI>Indians</HI> made signs for us to be gone divers times: At length they grew Angry, and took my Kinsman <HI>Allen</HI> into the Cannoo, and carried him away; in a little time after returned with the Cannoo, and bid me and <HI>Robert Barrow</HI> be gone: By this time day ap∣peared, the Wind and Rain still violent; I then saw a House on another Oyster-Hill that the Water was not got over yet; to which I got, and asked by signs if I might be there? The <HI>Indians</HI> seemed willing; so thither I got my Wife, Child, and <HI>Robert Barrow,</HI> and remained there. All this day the Wind was violent, it rained, and the Flood continued: We imagined that the Sea was broke in upon the Land, and that we should be drowned. The House was almost blown to pieces, and the <HI>Indians</HI> often tying and mending it. The chief Man of this House caused his Wife to Suckle our Child, for it was almost famished, its Mother having no Milk in her Breasts for we had received no Sustenance since the Storm be∣gan: Fresh Water was not to be had, the Land being covered with the Sea. The <HI>Indians</HI> offered us some of their Berries, which we endeavoured to eat; but could not, the Taste was so irksome, and ready to take our Breath from us, when we tryed to eat them; but we expected that if the Flood continued long, we should not need for Water. Yet nevertheless, we enjoying Health and Strength, and Hunger growing violent, we would be tasting the Berries, though we could reap no satifaction.</P>

<P>The Morning early came a Messenger, giving an Ac∣count, that the Old <HI>Cassekey</HI> was within some few Leagues of the Town, and that we might expect him this Fore∣noon, within the Time he came in sight: We all drew down to the Water-side to receive him; we perceived he came in State, having his two Cannoos lash'd together, with Poles athwar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from the one to the other, making a Plat-Form which being covered with a Mat, on it stood a Chest, which was belonging to us, and my <HI>Negro-Boy Caesar,</HI> (which the <HI>Cassekey</HI> of <HI>Hoe-Bay</HI> took
<PB N="35" REF="006658_0043_102976BC5D24F000"/>
from me) whom he had got from the <HI>Indians</HI> at <HI>Hoe-Bay</HI>: Upon this Chest he sat cross-legged, being newly painted red, his Men with Poles setting the Cannoos along unto the Shore. Seeing us, he cryed [<HI>Whough</HI>] and look∣ed very sternly at us. He was received by his People with great Homage, holding out his Hands (as their Custom is) to be kissed, having his Chest carried before him unto his House, whither he went, the House being filled with <HI>Indians.</HI> The Old <HI>Cassekey</HI> began, and held a Discourse for some Hours, giving an Account, as we suppose, what he heard and saw; in which Discourse, he would often mention, <HI>Nickaleer</HI>; which caused us to fear, that all Things were not well: After he had told his Story, and some of the Elder <HI>Indians</HI> had exprest their Sentiments thereof, they Drank <HI>Casseena,</HI> and Smoaked un∣til Evening. The House being clear, the Old <HI>Cassekey</HI> looking very unplesantly, shewed unto us several Things which he had got; as, a Hatchet, a Knife, the Chest, and many other Things, asking us, if they were not ours? Which we owned; whereupon he would say, they were <HI>Nickaleer</HI> (or <HI>English</HI>:) We signified that we had them of the <HI>English,</HI> but our Money was <HI>Spanish.</HI> To∣wards the Evening, <HI>Joseph Kirle,</HI> my self and <HI>Solomon,</HI> got an Opportunity to Discourse him; we began to urge his Promise, of carrying us for <HI>Augusteen</HI>: At first he stated his Hardships and Labour to <HI>Hoe-Bay,</HI> and back, and that he must have Time to rest, before he could go out again: Then he told us, the Way was long, and would be tedious, and that at several Places we must draw the Cannoos over Land for a great distance; he also mention∣ed how many Towns there were between this, and <HI>Augu∣steen,</HI> in Number Ten; But nigh the Conclusion, be set∣ting an angry Countenance upon us, told us, that at <HI>Hoe-Bay</HI> he was informed, that we should say, <HI>We were all English men</HI>; after he said this, in an angry Manner, he turn'd from us, and went away.</P>
<P>This laid all our hopes in the Dust, and we soon per∣ceived the <HI>Indians</HI> grew jealous of us; for they would now
<PB N="36" REF="006658_0044_102976BDEE93E788"/>
be daily asking us, if we were not, <HI>Nickaleer</HI> or <HI>English</HI>? And would not seem satisfied with a denial. Many Days were spent, and the Time drew nigh, that we under∣stood the Old <HI>Cassekey</HI> was intended for <HI>Augusteen</HI>; here∣upon we apply'd our selves to him, requesting, that if all might not go, he would carry some of us; but he told us, he would carry but one. This put us on querying, which of us should be that One. The Generality was for Me; but I and <HI>Joseph Kirle</HI> were for <HI>Solomon</HI>; because he could speak the <HI>Spanish-Language</HI> well, and no other of us could: And should any other of us have gone, and come amongst those <HI>Indians</HI> to the Northward; who, we supposed, could speak the <HI>Spanish-Language</HI> well, we should be discovered to be what those People did supose we were; therefore it might overthrow all our <HI>Expectation</HI>; but <HI>Solomon</HI> might pass all those Ob∣jections. These Reasons did not satisfy our People, so that some of them grew Cholerick; of which the old <HI>Cassekey</HI> took notice, and told <HI>Solomon,</HI> that if they made such a Stirr, he would not carry one: If he did, it should be either <HI>Solomon, Joseph Kirle</HI> or <HI>Me.</HI> Whereupon we prevailed with him, that <HI>Solomon</HI> might go, and according∣ly made Preparations; the <HI>Cassekey</HI> appointed the Number of <HI>Indians</HI> to go with him; also a Cannoo was sent for; which, when it came, we found it to have belonged to the <HI>English,</HI> by the Make of her. This Cannoo had a great Hole in the Head, nigh the Bottom, with many great Rents and Holes in her: <HI>Joseph Kirle</HI> and <HI>I</HI> were required to mend her; which, with much a-do, was ac∣complished; the Cannoo being much decay'd, and rot∣ten where the Rents were</P>

<P>This Day-morning, the old <HI>Cassekey,</HI> with <HI>Solomon,</HI> and six <HI>Indians,</HI> in a Cannoo, set out for <HI>Augusteen.</HI> The <HI>Cassekey</HI> carried a small Chest, in which was nigh One Hundred <HI>Pieces of Eight,</HI> as some of our People did suppose, with some other Matters that were gotten from our Vessel. The Weather was likely for Rain, which
<PB N="37" REF="006658_0045_102976BF9488E988"/>
caused us to fear, should the Weather prove bad, that <HI>Solomon</HI> would hardly live to get to <HI>Augusteen</HI>; for he had nothing to cover him except a pair of <HI>Indian Breeches,</HI> and a small piece of Skin that covered his Breast.</P>
<P>We understood by the old <HI>Cassekey,</HI> that it would be a <HI>Month,</HI> or next <HI>New Moon,</HI> before we could expect their Return: All which Time we spent in much Trouble and Hardship. The Weather began to grow cold, and Provision very short; that is, <HI>Palm-Berries, Coker-Plumbs,</HI> and <HI>Sea-Grapes,</HI> (which are the three Sorts before ex∣pressed) the Time of these Fruits-bearing being over, they having no Sort of Fruit till next Spring.</P>
<P>These People neither Sow nor Plant any manner of Thing whatsoever, nor Care for any Thing, but what the Barren Sands Produce: Fish they have as plenty as they please, but sometimes they would make it scarce to us; so that a Meal in a Week was most commonly our portion, and three Meals a Rarity. After the old <HI>Cassekey's</HI> De∣parture, our Hardships increased, especially my Wife's and Child's for want of Food of any Sort; my Wife's Milk was gone, and our poor Child was in great want; the <HI>Indians</HI> now and then would give it suck, but rarely to satisfie it; for there was a Woman or two of their own which had young Children, and not able to suckle them. Our Extremity was such, that any manner of Thing would go down with us; the Gills and Guts of Fish, pick'd off a Dung-hill, was acceptable; the Scraps the <HI>Indians</HI> threw away, and the Water they boyled their Fish in, we were thankfull for, tho' never so undecently handled by them. And tho' my Wife had hardly any Milk for her Child, yet an <HI>Indian-Woman,</HI> who was lately deliver∣ed of a Child, and had no Milk in her Breast, would have had her to suckle her Child; which my Wife con∣sented unto. And this was a means of her and our Child's reaping a Benefit; for the <HI>Indians</HI> would give her Fish: Which helped to increase Milk fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> our Child. Many were our Exercises, both in Body and Mind amongst this People. Sometimes they would look upon us, as tho'
<PB N="38" REF="006658_0046_102976C2A29BECA0"/>
they had some ill Intent towards the whole of us; at other Times, they would tell us, (who were nominally <HI>Spaniards</HI>) How and in what Manner those of <HI>Smith's</HI> Company should be put to Death. And thus were we daily exercised in Sorrow and grievous Troubles. Some∣times doubt would arise amongst us, concerning what would be the End of us, and what manner of Deaths we should pass through: And whomsoever these Doubts did appear in, it would be hard for another to help with Counsel: But some there were, whose Hope never failed, they trusting in the Lord to work our Deliverance. One thing did seem more grievous to me and my Wife, than any other Thing, which was. That if it should so hap∣pen, that we should be put to Death, we feared that our Child would be kept Alive, and bred up as one of those People: When these Thoughts did arise, it wound∣ed us deep.</P>
<P>This Day, being the Time of the Moon's entering the First Quarter, the <HI>Indians</HI> have a Ceremonious Dance, which they begin about Eight a Clock in the Morning: In the first Place comes an old Man, and takes a Staff, about eight Foot long, having a broad <HI>Arrow</HI> on the head thereof, and thence half way painted Red and White, like unto a <HI>Barker's-Pole</HI>▪ in the middle of this Staff is fix'd a piece of Wood, shaped like unto a Thigh, Leg and Foot of a Man; and the lower Part thereof is painted Black; and this Staff being carried out of the <HI>Cassekey's</HI> House, is set fast in the Ground, standing up∣right; this done, he also brings out a Basket, containing Six Rattles, which are taken out of the Basket, and placed at the Foot of his Staff; then another old Man comes, and sets up a Howling, like unto a mighty Dog, but beyond him for length of Breath; withal making a <HI>Pro∣clamation:</HI> This being done, the most of them having painted themselves, some red, some Black, some with Black and red; with their Belly girt up as Tight as well they can Gird themselves with Ropes, having their Sheafs of <HI>Arrows</HI> at their Backs, and their <HI>Bows</HI> in their Hands;
<PB N="39" REF="006658_0047_102976C5EFF32580"/>
being gathered together about this Staff, six of the chiefest Men in Esteem amongst them, especially one who is their <HI>Doctor,</HI> and much esteemed, taking up the Rattles, begin a hideous Noise, standing round this Staff, shaking their Rattles, and bowing without ceasing unto the Staff for a∣bout half an Hour; whilst these six are thus imployed, all the rest are staring and scraching, pointing upwards and downwards, on this and the other Side, every way, look∣ing like Men frighted, or more like Furries; thus behav∣ing themselves until the six have done shaking their Rattles. Then they all begin a Dance, violently stamping on the Ground, for the Space of an Hour or more, without ceasing: In which Time they will sweat in a most ex∣cessive Manner, that by the Time the Dance is over, what by their Sweat, and the violent stamping of their Feet, the Ground is trodden into Furrows; and by the Morning, the Place where they danced was covered with <HI>Maggots</HI>: Thus, often repeating the Manner, they con∣tinue till about three or four a Clock in the Afternoon; by which Time many were sick and fainty. And then, being gathered into the <HI>Cassekey's</HI> House, they sit down, having some hot <HI>Casseena</HI> ready, which they drink plenti∣fully, and give greater quantities thereof to the Sick and Fainty, than to others: Then they eat Berries. On these Days they eat not any Food till Night.</P>
<P>The next Day, about the same Time, they begin their Dance, at the Day before. Also the third Day they be∣gin their Dance▪ at the usual Time: At which Time came many <HI>Indians</HI> from other Towns, and fell to Dancing, without taking any Notice one of the other.</P>
<P>This Day they were stricter than the other two Days, for no Woman must look upon them; but if any of their Women go out of their Houses, they go vailed with a Mat.</P>

to the King, or young <HI>Cassekey,</HI> which we supposed to be a Tribute to the King of this Town, who is Chief of all the Towns from <HI>Santa Lucia,</HI> to the Northward of this Town of <HI>Jece.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The <HI>27</HI>th of the <HI>8</HI>th Month; the <HI>3</HI>d of the Week.</HEAD>
<P>This Day was a Bag of Berries (the Bag made of Grass) given us, which we eat in two or three Days; and then we fasted as many Days, before the young <HI>Cassekey</HI> would give us more.</P>
<P>About this Time <HI>John Smith</HI> and <HI>Andrew Morray</HI> were sharply seized with a Fever and Ague: When the Fit of the Ague was on them, the <HI>Indians</HI> would mock and deride them: This we well observed, that these People had no Compassion on their own Aged declining People, when they were past their Labour, nor on others of their own, which lay in any declining Condition: For the Younger is served before the Elder, and the Elder People, both Men and Women, are Slaves to the Younger.</P>
<P>In this Place we saw many Tokens of some of our Nation's having fallen into the Hands of these People: As, two English Cannoos, one of Cedar, the other of <HI>Cotton-Tree,</HI> like those of <HI>Jamaica</HI>; several Blocks and Shelves of <HI>Lignum-Vitae</HI>; several Tools and Knives, and more particularly, a <HI>Razor,</HI> on the haft of which, was writ the Man's Name, thus, THOMAS FOSTER. Some of these Things looked as though they had been several Years amongst them, some but a few: But we never dared to enquire, for we thought they brought some Things in our view to try us.</P>
<P>Here was a Man in this Town, who, some Years past, had been taken off by some of our English Sloops for a Diver on the Wreck, to the Eastward of <HI>Cuba,</HI> where he was sometime: But the Vessel putting into <HI>Cuba,</HI> for Water, this <HI>Indian</HI> Swam on Shore, and got to the <HI>Havanna,</HI> thence to <HI>Augusteen,</HI> and so to his Native Town. The greatest Charge this Man had against the English, was, for taking him, and their People away; not but that he was well used amongst them: Tis <HI>Indian</HI> would
<PB N="41" REF="006658_0049_102976CD8CAD0A78"/>
often call <HI>Joseph Kirle, Solomon Cresson,</HI> and some of us into his House, seeming very chearful, asking, if they would eat, withal asking the names of the Berries, expecting we would call them after the English manner [<HI>Plumbs</HI>] but perceiving his drift, and having learned the Name of them, as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> calls them [<HI>Uvas</HI>; then he would tell us, that the English called them <HI>Plumbs:</HI>] Such Sort of Discourse we had at Times, for he would be striving to intrap us, <HI>viz. Joseph, Solomon</HI> and <HI>Me,</HI> in Words, but he never had an Advantage; for when <HI>Solomon</HI> was gone, we shun'd all his Invitations and Ar∣guments.</P>

<P>This Day came in a Cannoo laden with Fish, and it was free, for those that would, to take as much as they pleased. The <HI>Indians</HI> put us to go and take, for it was a kind of a Scramble, amongst us, and the young <HI>Indian-Men</HI> and Boys: All of us got Fish enough to serve us two or three Days.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>2</HI>d of the <HI>9</HI>th Month; the <HI>2</HI>d of the Week:</HEAD>
<P>This Morning, about Sun-rising, came two Strange <HI>Indians,</HI> who had run so hard, that they Sweated extream∣ly, of whom we understood, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were coming with their Old <HI>Cassekey</HI>: which News surprised us, doubting the Truth of it, for <HI>Solomon</HI> had been gone but sixteen Days, and we understood that they must have an extraordinary Passage to be here in a Month: We had not long to consider of the Matter, for in an Hour's Time we heard four Muskets discharged, and immediate∣ly we looked out, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in their <HI>Perriauger</HI> were in sight. The <HI>Indians</HI> were like a People amazed, and overcome with Fear: We perceived the Noise of a Gun was terrible unto them. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> Landed, being in number Twelve, one <HI>Sebastian Lopez</HI> Com∣manding Ten Soldiers, with one <HI>Indian</HI> an Interpeter. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> embraced us very chearfully, and expres∣sed their being glad to find us alive: But we were not able to Discourse each other, though we had so much
<PB N="42" REF="006658_0050_102976D091E2CBE0"/>
<HI>Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh</HI> as to ask Questions, and answer some Part of what the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> asked us. One of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> said, they could not speak <HI>English</HI> nor could we speak <HI>Spanish</HI> enough to un∣derstand each other sufficiently; this the <HI>Indians</HI> per∣ceived, and immediately cryed out, <HI>Nickaleer, Nickaleer,</HI> and looked enviously on us, so that, could they have had their wills, we believed they would not have suffered us to have lived many Hours; but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> awed them.</P>
<P>We received a Letter from <HI>Solomon,</HI> which he writ when he met with Capt. <HI>Sebastian Lopez,</HI> signifying the Governnment of <HI>Augusteen's</HI> great Care for our Pre∣servation, of what Nation soever we were: But how these Persons, or the Governor of <HI>Augusteen,</HI> had knowledge of us, we could not understand; for they had been fourteen Days from <HI>Augusteen,</HI> which was nigh the Time <HI>Solomon</HI> went hence; and they met <HI>Solomon</HI> about half way, and sent him for <HI>Augusteen</HI> with other Guides, bringing the Old <HI>Cassekey</HI> and his People with them: We ob∣served that the Old <HI>Cassekey</HI> seem'd much dejected. We supposed the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had taken from him the Mo∣ney, and what other Things he had carried with him; or that he was vexed he should be so deceived, in tak∣ing us for <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> were extraordinary kind unto us, so that we had Occasion to rejoice, and thank the Lord for this part of our Delivrance by their Means: They were also a Terror unto the <HI>Indians</HI>; for they searched their Houses, and took all from them that ever they could find, even to the Stump of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail; which aggravated them, and increased their dis-affection to us-ward, so that we dar'd not stir from a <HI>Spaniard.</HI> The <HI>Spanish</HI> Captain made inquiry where we were cast away, and what was saved that we had in our Vessel? We gave an Account, so well as we could, to make him understand us; which Account made him very desirous to go down thither; but looking over a Paper often, which we supposed, was the Governor's Order and Instructions to him; we understood they would
<PB N="43" REF="006658_0051_102976D2179E3038"/>
not permit him to prosecute his Designs; besides, we made him sensible of the Danger we should be in, if he and his Men should go and leave us amongst these People, who were bitterly incensed against us.</P>
<P>They inquired what became of the Boat that belong∣ed to Smith's Vessel and ours, we told them, that these <HI>Indians</HI> had taken Smith's Boat and sunk her somewhere in the Sound, but ours was at St. <HI>Lucia:</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI> made the <HI>Indians</HI> go and shew where they had sunk Smith's Boat, and help our People to get her up; which being done, she was brought to the Town: The <HI>Spaniards</HI> were mightily pleased with her, and proposed, that they in their Cannoo, and our People in that Boat, should go to <HI>Hoe-Bay,</HI> whereby they might get all from the <HI>Indians,</HI> which they had gotten from us, but we would not countenance the Matter: We were for us speedy de∣parting from amongst these People, as we could, since it pleased God to open a Way for our Deliverance.</P>
<P>This Morning the Spanish Captain made the <HI>Indians</HI> provide two Cannoos, which he caused to be lashed to∣gether, at some distance, with Sticks a cross, and mat∣ted on the Top; which being done, with four <HI>Indians, Joseph Kirle, John Smith, Robert Barrow, Andrew Mor∣ray, Benjamin Allen, Nathaniel Randall, John Shears, Cor∣nelius Toker, Joseph Kirle's Boy John Hilliar, four Negors, viz. Jack, Caesar, Sarah and Quenza,</HI> were sent away for <HI>Augusteen</HI>; but not one Morsel of Victuals, except a very few Berries, had they with them; and not one <HI>Spaniard</HI> to Guard them, but were put under the Government of those four <HI>Indians.</HI> About an Hour after <HI>Joseph Kirle</HI> was gone, the Spanish Captain ordered Smith's Boat to be get ready, with two <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and four of our Men, to row to the Place where the drift of Smith's Vessel was, to look for <HI>Log-wood</HI> or old Iron. When they re∣turned, there was not any Thing of Value: But our People said, that as they were searching about, they found the Bones of <HI>Andrew Barns</HI>; his Skull and Jaw-Bone were broken, which occasioned us suspect, that he was
<PB N="44" REF="006658_0052_102976D52F6C4240"/>
knocked on the Head by the <HI>Indians,</HI> after they had driven away <HI>Smith</HI> and his People.</P>
<P>We told the Spanish Captain, that <HI>Joseph Kirle's Negro,</HI> Ben, had been absent, ever since the Day after <HI>Solomon Cresson</HI> went hence, being gone with the Old <HI>Cassekey's</HI> Wife, but we knew not whither. The Captain made inquiry of the <HI>Indians</HI> whither he was gone; they said, for <HI>Hoe-Bay:</HI> Then be ordered them to send for him, for he would not leave him behind: The <HI>Indians</HI> said, he would be here within a Day or two.</P>
<P>The Spaniards were continually searching for what they could find, of such Things as the <HI>Indians</HI> had gotten from us or others: And when they could find no more, they would offer to buy with Tobacco what they could perswade the <HI>Indians</HI> to bring to Light A Leaf, or half a Leaf of Tobacco, would purchase a Yard of Linen or Woollen, or Silk, from the <HI>Indians</HI>; such Admirers of Tobacco are they, that they esteem it beyond any other Thing.</P>
<P>An <HI>Indian</HI> of the Town, sometime before the Spaniards came, having a considerable Quantity of <HI>Ambergreece</HI> boast∣ed, that when he went for <HI>Augusteen</HI> with that, he could purchase of the Spaniards, a <HI>Looking-Glass,</HI> an <HI>Ax,</HI> a <HI>Knife</HI> or two, and three or four <HI>Mannocoes,</HI> (which is about five or six Pounds) of Tobacco: The Quantity of <HI>Am∣ber-greece</HI> might be about five Pound weight.</P>

<P>This Day we made Oars for Smith's Boat, of Sticks, and the Cantle-pieces of Sugar-Hogsheads, which were gotten on the Beach, where the drift of Smith's Vessel came on Shore: And this Evening came the Old <HI>Cassekey's</HI> Wife, with <HI>Joseph Kirle's</HI> Negro <HI>Ben,</HI> and <HI>Joseph Kirle's</HI> Boat, which was of great advantage to help to carry us. We work'd all this Night to fit the Boat, and Oars unto her, being intented to go away, as soon as we could compleat that Jobb.</P>
<P>The Spaniards had brought little Provision with them, so that there was not much to spare for us, having not

above a Rove of Corn, and a little <HI>New-Spain</HI> Bread, which was so bad, that it was more Dust, and dead Wevels, than Bread; an handful of it was an acceptable Present to us. We would mix it with a little Water, making it into a Paste, which would eat pleasantly; but Hunger was no Stranger unto us, and we knew not that we should have any Victuals on our Journey; but our Deliverance seem'd to over-ballance all. The <HI>Indians</HI> would not give us any Berries; but our People watch'd an Opportunity, and took one of the <HI>Cassekey's</HI> Bags of Berries, which might contain about a Bushel, which was all that One and Thirty of us had to depend on.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>5</HI>th of the <HI>9</HI>th Month; the <HI>5</HI>th of the Week.</HEAD>
<P>This Morning, about three Hours before Day, we departed from this Town of <HI>Jece</HI>; the weather was grown Cold, we had nothing wherewith to cover our Bodies, besides what the <HI>Indians</HI> gave us at first, except my Wife, for whom the Spaniards got an old Jacket (which had been one of Smith's Men's) and gave her to wear; also a small piece of Cloth to cover our poor Child: But it pleased God to strengthen us, in this our Condition, so that we rowed all this Day without ceasing, untill three Hours after it was dark, by which Time we got to an <HI>Indian-Town:</HI> Here we met with <HI>Joseph Kirle, Robert Bar∣row</HI> and the others, who got thither not above an Hour or two bfore us. They had not received any Manner of Sustenance from the Time they left us, untill they got some Berries of us, having lain one Night of the two in a <HI>Swamp</HI>; but they were as cheerful as Men could be in this Straight.</P>
<P>Since they left us, amongst their other Hardships, <HI>Joseph Kirle</HI> had like to have lost his Life several Times: The first was thus, Whilst the two Cannoos were lashed to∣gether, having a few Berries, that were designed to have been shared amongst them, the Irish-Boy, <HI>Cornelius Toker,</HI> would ever and non be taking some of them; who, being often Reproved by <HI>Joseph Kirle</HI> and others, would not desist; whereupon <HI>Joseph Kirle,</HI> with the Paddle he paddled
<PB N="46" REF="006658_0054_102976DCC0FCAB98"/>
the Cannoo along with, struck him; thereupon an <HI>Indian</HI> took his <HI>Bow</HI> and <HI>Arrow,</HI> and was going to shoot <HI>Joseph</HI>; (who seemed little concerned, whether he lived or died) withal saying, The <HI>Spaniards</HI> would justifie him.</P>
<P>Another Time, when he was spent with paddling the Cannoo, and desired <HI>John Smith, Andrew Murray,</HI> and others of them, as well able as himself, to give him a Spell, which they refused; he being not able to paddle further, laid down his paddle; whereupon the <HI>Indians</HI> commanding him to paddle, he refused, say∣ing, they might kill him if they would; opening his Breast for them to execute their Wills: Which they seemed as though they would have done; but, after great threatning they desisted.</P>
<P>Another Time, The Wind being high, and the Seas rough, that they were forced to unlash their Cannoos, by <HI>Joseph Kirle's</HI> perswasion, and to go single; <HI>Joseph Kirle</HI> taking one Cannoo to his own Management, ha∣ving <HI>Robert Barrow,</HI> his Boy, my Kinsman, <HI>Nathaniel Randal,</HI> and the <HI>Negroes,</HI> in her; which, being thus single from the other Company, was more satisfactory to him than before, tho' none to help but <HI>Nathaniel Randal,</HI> My <HI>Negro-Woman,</HI> named <HI>Sarah,</HI> having beaten and abused a Girl, named <HI>Quenza</HI>; being reproved often by him and <HI>Robert Barrow,</HI> she therefore abused them in an extraordinary Manner; whereupon <HI>Joseph</HI> struck her with the Paddle; at which, one of the <HI>In∣dians,</HI> in the other Cannoo, took his striking Staff and darted at him, narrowly missing him.</P>
<P>This Morning, <HI>Joseph Kirle,</HI> with those that were with him, were, by the <HI>Spanish Captain,</HI> ordered away at Break of Day, he not taking any care to give them a little Sustenance; and about an Hour or two after we followed, rowing all this Day without ceasing, until an Hour or two in the Night: By which Time we got to an <HI>Indian-Town,</HI> where not any Thing was to be had but Water: About two Hours after us came <HI>Joseph

<HEAD>The <HI>7</HI>th of the <HI>9</HI>th Month; the <HI>7</HI>th of the Week.</HEAD>
<P>This Morning we set forward very early, and rowed hard: About Noon we got to a parcel of <HI>Marshy Islands,</HI> amongst which we were to go up Creeks: The Passage was very difficult to find. At length, when we were got nigh an <HI>Indian-Town,</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> hollowed, and an <HI>Indian</HI> came out into the Marsh, but was very loath to come near us; at length he came wading to us to be our Pilot: We set forward, and in an Hour's Time, or more, were got to the place where <HI>Joseph Kirle,</HI> and those with him, were; the <HI>Indians</HI> that were with <HI>Jo∣seph</HI> would not let them proceed further, until we came up with them. In half an Hour's Time we got to the Place where we were to hale our Boats over Land, be∣ing about a Quarter of a Mile from Sound to Sound: At this Place the Sea was half a Furlong from us. The <HI>Spanish Captain</HI> gave the <HI>Indian,</HI> we last took in, a piece of a Leaf of <HI>Tobacco,</HI> commanding him to go, with all speed, and bid his <HI>Cassekey,</HI> with all his able Men, come to help to hale our Boats over Land. But we set to work, and had them over by that Time the <HI>Indians</HI> came. The <HI>Spanish Captain</HI> gave the <HI>Cassekey</HI> a Leaf or two of <HI>Tobacco,</HI> and discharged them; only ordered the <HI>Cassekey</HI> to send some Men a Fishing for him; which they did, and before Night brought a stately Parcel of Fish; but none of our People had any Part of it, except my <HI>Wife</HI> and <HI>Penelope:</HI> What they did not eat, they kept to carry with them.</P>
<P>A little before Night, sprang up a Storm of Wind at North-East. It seemed likely to be a Dismal Night of Wind and Rain, and we were got to a Place where there was not a Tree, or Bush, or any Manner of Shel∣ter, and the Wind so very cold that we thought we should not live till the next Day. We had no Wood
<PB N="48" REF="006658_0056_102976E18BD63E30"/>
to make a Fire with, and what to do we could not tell; but we were resolved to try to get some, and in order thereto▪ some of the ablest of us went along the Bay, to search for Drift-Wood, and found a little but Rain came, with the Night, and no Shelter to be had, but our Boats; and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would not let us meddle with them, to turn them bottom upwards for Shelter, which seemed very hard; but they had made themselves some Shelter with Mats: We were forced to exercise Patience; and with what Salt-Water-Wood we had, made as good a Fire as we could, and laid our selves down on the Sand by it: And it pleased God we had a Comfortable Night, beyond our Expecta∣tion; only the Cold was very sharp.</P>

<P>This Morning we set forward, but the Water was so low, that we were forc'd to wade, and thrust the Boat along for some Miles: At length we got into a deep Channel, where was nothing to be seen but Marsh and Water, and no fast Land, nor Trees. About ten a Clock we heard three or four Muskets fired a little a-head of us, in the Channel we were in. Our <HI>Spani∣ards</HI> presently answered them with the like; and in a little Time we met. This was a <HI>Perriauger</HI> to joyn with that that came for us, having order to go to the place where we were <HI>Cast way,</HI> and to get what was to be had from the <HI>Indians</HI>: But this other Boat turned back, for there was no place to go on Shore. And in an Hour or two's Time we got into the other Sound, where the Land was not to be seen from side to side in some Places: The like was in the other we came through. About an Hour before Sun-set we got to an <HI>Indian Plantation</HI> (this was the first Place we saw any thing planted) being full of <HI>Pumpion-Vines,</HI> and some small <HI>Pumpions</HI> on them; but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were too quick for us, and got all before us. Some of us got a few as big as on's Fist. We had a Fire there, yet had not patience to dress them as they should be, but put
<PB N="49" REF="006658_0057_102976E329AB2510"/>
them into the Fire, roast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d them, and eat them. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> used a great deal of Cookery with their <HI>Pum∣pions.</HI> And the <HI>Perriauger,</HI> that came from <HI>Augusteen,</HI> had brought Bread, Corn, and strung Beef; but it was kept from us except a Piece of strung Beef, the <HI>Captain</HI> of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> gave my Wife, as big as a Stick of <HI>Sealing-Wax,</HI> which we treasured up, expecting it must be harder with us when we left this People. Here Captain <HI>Sebastian Lopez</HI> drew up a Writing, and would have had me and <HI>Joseph Kirle</HI> to Sign it, which we refused. For we per∣ceived he had a design, especially against me, to oblige me to give him some of my <HI>Negroes.</HI> We answered him short, that I reckoned my self and <HI>Negroes</HI> at the <HI>Governor</HI> of <HI>Augusteen's</HI> disposal, and we would Sign no Writing: We borrowed a Pot, and boiled <HI>Pumpion-Leaves,</HI> hav∣ing nothing to put to to them but Water, which was Satisfactory. But this Night was more terrible than the last, the Wind being at North-West; it did not blow hard, yet it was very cold, we lying in an open Field, without any Shelter: One Side of us would scorch, while the other was Freezing. Our Negro-Woman <HI>Hagar's</HI> little Boy, named <HI>Cajo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> was seized with <HI>Convulsion-Fits</HI> about two in the Morning, which was chiefly occasioned by the Cold and want of Food: But help there was not from us. The <HI>Spanish Captain</HI> came to see the Child, and supposing that it would die, asked if the Child was a Christian? He was answered, as good a one as he could make it. But he called for some Water, putting some of it on the Crown of the Child's Head, and Crossing it, called him <HI>Francisco.</HI> This Action pacified its Father and Mother.</P>

<P>This Morning we were to go forward, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were to return to the Place where we were cast away: But our two Boats could not carry us all, therefore we had the <HI>Spaniards</HI> great <HI>Perrianger</HI> to carry us one Day's Journey further, to an <HI>Indian-Town,</HI> and four <HI>Spaniards</HI> with us, three of which were to bring the <HI>Perriauger</HI> back, the other was to be our Guide for <HI>Augusteen.</HI> We depart∣ed,

and met with an intricate Passage; for sometimes we should be a Ground on Oyster-Banks, or Shoals, and al∣most out of sight of Land. About two or three in the Afternoon, we had no Water to go any further; the Wind being <HI>North-Westerly</HI> drove the Water out of the Sound; but being nigh the Shore, where had been an <HI>Indian-Town,</HI> we went on Shore, and found some ripe Berries on the <HI>Palm-Shrubs,</HI> which we were very earnest after, till such Time as a Storm of Wind, with Rain, began to come upon us, and Night nigh at hand; whereupon we all got to∣gether, considering what we should do, since there was no possibility of getting Shelter here. Our <HI>Indian</HI> Guide said, we might get to a Town about two Leagues off; which we were glad to hear, for it rained hard. So we, with our Guide, set forward, and walked over a Parcel of scraggy shrubby Hills, to the Sea-Shore; along which we travelled till we got to the <HI>Indian-Town,</HI> where we got plenty of Berries for our Supper. It rained much till towards Morning.</P>

<P>This Morning the <HI>Indians</HI> were not willing to stay any longer; and we were by our Guide required to de∣part, which we did, and a great many young <HI>Indian-Men</HI> followed us some Miles along the Bay, and offered vio∣lence to <HI>Robert Barrow,</HI> and several others; but were easily stop'd, by shewing them a rusty Musket, presented towards them, and so they left us. We had an untoward Passage from the Sea-Shore athwart the Land to the <HI>Indian-Town,</HI> the Ground being swampey, and scraggy Hills, which to our bare Feet, was very troublesome. This was a large Town, and there was another large Town, about a Mile distant in sight, thither part of our Com∣pany was sent to be quartered; at which Town, about a twelve Month since, a Parcel of <HI>Dutch-Men</HI> were killed; who having been Cast away on the <HI>Bahama</HI> Shoals, in a Flat which they built escaped hither, and were herd devoured by these <HI>Canibals,</HI> as we understood by the Spani∣ards: The Flat or Boat our People saw; but they seem'd

kind to them, giving them Fish and Berries to eat: We remained at these two Towns till next Morning. The <HI>Indians</HI> of the Town I was at, were not so kind, as those at the other Town had been: Some of our People were for selling their Rags to the <HI>Indians</HI> for Fish; but we thought it was necessary, of the two Extreams, to defend against the Cold, for every Day grew Colder than other; and we feared, that if, we were much longer exposed to it, we should not live it out.</P>

<P>This Morning, leaving this Town, we Embarqued in our two Boats, and those of our People that were at the other Town, were to have a large <HI>Cannoo</HI> to carry them thence, and were to meet us in the Sound: We rowed several Leagues, and did not meet them, it being then about ten a Clock; the <HI>Spaniard</HI> would go on Shore, and travel back by Land to see after them. We being by an Inlet of the Sea, which was a Mile over, the <HI>Spani∣ard</HI> ordered us to go on the other side, and there stay for him; which we did many Hours: At this Place we all went upon search, to see if any thing was to be had for the Belly, some on the Land, some in the Water: The Land yielded nothing, but in the Water we got a Sort of Shell-Fish, called <HI>Water-Soldiers,</HI> which we eat: At length the <HI>Cannoo</HI> with our People came, but our <HI>Spaniard</HI> was not come; but in about an half Hour's Time he came with a small <HI>Cannoo.</HI> This was the Place where <HI>Solomon</HI> met the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> The <HI>Cannoos</HI> had each two <HI>Indians</HI> to set them along; and we had one <HI>Indian</HI> for our Guide, named <HI>Juan Antonio</HI>▪ who the <HI>Spaniard</HI> said was a Christian, but an Inhabitant of that Town, where the <HI>Dutch-Men</HI> were killed. We set forward in our two Boats, and the two <HI>Cannoos,</HI> and rowed till Night, being nigh a Place of thicketty Wood, which we made choice of to lodge at for this Night: Here was Wood enough; we made large Fires, we were pleased with the Place, and lay down to rest. About Mid-night I had a great Loss, having a Quart of Berries whole, and as much

pounded to mix with Water, to feed our Child with; the Fire being disturbed, the Cloth which we had our Food in was burn'd; all was lost, and nothing to be had untill we could get to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> which was two Days March at least: About an Hour after this, the Wind rose at <HI>North-West,</HI> and it began to Rain; but having small <HI>Palmetto</HI> which grew nigh, <HI>Joseph Kirle</HI> and I set to Work, and made a Shelter, which would keep Ten or more of us from the Weather: We had no sooner compleated our Work, but it rained hard. In this Shower of Rain the Four <HI>Indians</HI> got from among us, took their <HI>Cannoos,</HI> and away they went back again: When Day appeared, we missed them, upon which we went to the Water-Side, where we found the two <HI>Cannoos</HI> gone; and now we were in a great strait; but the <HI>Spaniard</HI> said, those that could Travel best, must go by Land. The Persons pitch'd upon, were <HI>Richard Limpeney, Andrew Murray, Cornelius Tuker, Joseph Kirle's Boy John Hillard,</HI> and <HI>Penelope,</HI> with seven <HI>Negroes,</HI> named, <HI>Peter, Jack, Caesar, Sarah, Bella, Susanna</HI> and <HI>Quenza</HI>; the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and the <HI>Indian, Juan Antonio</HI> went with them, to direct them the Way, leading them over Land to the Sea Shore, and then directing to keep by the Sea-Shore along to the <HI>Northward.</HI></P>
<P>They returned to us, and we with our two Boats row∣ed all Day without ceasing, till Sun-setting; and when we put on Shore, the Place was an old <HI>Indian-Field,</HI> on a high bleak Hill, where had been a large <HI>Indian-House,</HI> but it was tumbled down: Of the Ruines of this House, we made a Shelter against the <HI>North-West</HI> Wind, which began to blow very bleak. The <HI>Spaniard</HI> went to the Sea, which was not two Miles off, to see if our People had passed, and at his Return he said, They were gone by: We asked if they could reach to any House, or <HI>Indian-Town</HI> for Shelter? For we supposed, should they be without Fire this Night, they could not live: He said, they must travel all Night▪ Night came on; we had Fire and Wood enough, and had gathered a great heap of Grass

to lie in, hoping to have got some rest; but the <HI>North-West-Wind</HI> increased, and the Cold was so violent, that we were in a lamentable Condition, not able to rest, for as we lay or stood so close to the Fire, that it would scorch us, that side from it was ready to Freeze: We had no other Way, but to stand and keep turning for the most Part of the Night; we all thought we never felt the like. The <HI>Spaniard</HI> that was clothed, was as bad to bear it, as we that were naked: At length Day appeared, and we must go.</P>

<P>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Morning we were loth to part with our Fires, but to stay here it could not be; so we went to our Boats, wading in the Water, till it was ready to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>num us: But we put forward, and rowing about 2 Leagues, came to an old House, where the <HI>Spaniard</HI> told us, we must leave the Boats, and Travel by Land; we had a Bog∣gy Marsh to wade through for a Mile, to get to the Sea-Shore, and had about five or six Leagues, along the Bay or Strand, to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Sentinal's House: The <HI>North-West-Wind</HI> was violent, and the Cold such, that the strongest of us thought we should not out-live that Day. Having got through the Boggy Marsh, and on the Sea-Shore, our People, Black and White, made all Speed, one not staying for another that could not Travel so fast: none but I, with my Wife and Child, <HI>Robert Barrow,</HI> my Kinsman <HI>Benjamin Allen,</HI> and my Negro <HI>London,</HI> whom I kept to help carry my Child, keeping together; the rest of our Company had left us, not expecting to see some of us again; especially <HI>Robert Barrow,</HI> my Wife and Child. We travelled after as well as we could, having gone about two Miles, the Cold so seized on my Kinsman, <HI>Benjamin Allen,</HI> that he began to be st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ff in his Limbs, and staggered and fell, grieviously complaining that the Cold would kill him: Our Negro having our young Child, I and my Wife took our Kinsman under each Arm, and helped him along; but at length his Limbs were quite stiff, his Speech almost gone, and he began to Foam at the Mouth: In

this strait we knew not what to do; to stay with him we must perish also, and we were willing to strive as long as we could. We carried our Kinsman, and laid him un∣der the Bank, not being Dead; I resolved to run after our People, some of them not being out of Sight; which I did, and left my Wife and Child, with the Negro, to follow as fast as they could. I run about two Miles, making signs to them, thinking if they should look behind them, and see me running, they would stop till I got up with them. I was in hopes, if I could have accomplished this my de∣sign, to have got help to have carried my Kinsman along; but they stopp'd not, and I ran until the Wind pierced me, so that my Limbs failed, and I fell; yet still I strove and getting up, walked backwards to meet my Wife; as I was going, I met with the <HI>Spaniard</HI> coming out of the Sand-Hills, and <HI>Joseph Kirle's Negro Ben.</HI> I made my Complaint to the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> but he not being able to understand me well, went forward. I then apply'd my self to the Negro, mak∣ing large Promises, if he would fetch my Kinsman; he of∣fered to go back, and used his endeavour, which he did. At length my <HI>Wife</HI> and <HI>Child</HI> came up with me, she was almost overcome with Grief, expressing in what Manner we were forced to part with our Kinsman; and expecting that she and the Child should go next.</P>
<P>Poor <HI>Robert Barrow</HI> was a great way behind us, I feared we should never see him again. I used my endeavour to comfort and cheer my Wife, intreating her not to let Grief overcome her: I had hopes that the Lord would help us in this straight, as he had done in many since we were in this Land: And if it pleased God that we should lay down our Lives in this Wilderness, that we might beseech him to enable us to do it willingly. Thus striving in a deep Exercise of Body and Mind, we travelled on, admiring God's Goodness in preserving us thus far through so many eminent Dangers; in the sense of which, a secret hope would arise, (tho' involved with human Doubts and Fears) That the Lord would yet preserve us. I took my Child from the Negro, and caried him. I had an <HI>Indian-Mat,</HI> with
<PB N="55" REF="006658_0063_102976F72E864358"/>
a split in it, through which I put my Head, hanging over my Breast unto my Waste; under this I carried my Child, which help'd to break the Wind off it; but the poor Babe was black with cold from Head to Foot, and its Flesh as cold as a Stone; yet it was not froward. Its Mother would take it now and then, and give it the Breast, but little could it get at it: Besides, we dared not stop in the least; for if we did, we should perceive our Limbs to fail. About two a Clock in the Afternoon, we came up with our Negro-Woman <HI>Hagar,</HI> with her Child at her Back, almost dead: And a little further we came up with our Negro-Girl <HI>Quen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a,</HI> being dead, as we thought; for she was as stiff as a dead, Body could be, and her Eyes set; but at length we per∣ceived her Breath; but she had no Sense nor Motion. We carried her from the Water-Side, under the Bank. This increased my Wife's Sorrow, and she began to doubt, she should not be able to travel much further; but I endeavor∣ed to encourage her, not to leave her striving, as long as any Ability was left. All our People were out of Sight except four, and those we had gained upon. I sent my Negro to overtake them, and to desire them to slacken their pace, till we got up with them; being in hopes, that gaining their Company, would cheer up my Wife; but they would not; so the Negro stopp'd for us. We had lost sight of <HI>Robert Barrow</HI> by this Time. Soon after we overtook <HI>John Smith,</HI> who was one of the four; he began to fail and his Companions left him; whereupon he made grievous Complaints, which I reproved him for, lest he should dis∣courage my Wife. The Sun was nigh setting▪ and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> began to look out for the Sentinal's Post, and my Ne∣gro at Times got upon several of the highest Sand-Hill to look out, but could not see any House, not the Smo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of a fire. This was terrible to us all; for the Day being so cold, the Night much more, and we not able to travel without rest; being a starved People, both within our Bodies and without; and if we ceased from travelling we should instantly be nummed and move no further. In the midst of these Reasonings and Doubtings, we were got into, I

espyed a Man, as I thought, standing on the Bank, but at great distance; I was afraid to speak, lest it should prove otherwise, but he was soon seen by the whole Company; and at length we espy'd him walking towards the Land, this confirmed us; and so we betook to the Hills again, to look out, yet could not see the House from thence; but on the next Hill we saw it: This was Joy unto us, though we began to have a Sense of our tiredness; for our Resolution abated, after we had got Sight of the House.</P>
<P>When we got to the House, we found four Sentinals, and the <HI>Spaniard</HI> our Guide, with three of our Men, viz. <HI>Joseph Buckley, Nathaniel Randal,</HI> and <HI>John Shires.</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI> bid us welcome, and made Room for us to sit down by the Fire. The chiefest Man of the Sentinals took a <HI>Kersey-Coat</HI> and gave my Wife to cover her, and gave each of us a piece of Bread, made of <HI>Indian-Corn,</HI> which was pleasant unto us; after it we had plenty of hot <HI>Cas∣seena-Drink.</HI> It was dark, and we endeavoured to prevail with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to go seek for <HI>Robert Barrow</HI> and my <HI>Kinsman,</HI> oftering them considerable; but they seemed not fully to understand me, yet I could make them sensible, that my <HI>Kinsman</HI> was almost dead, if not quite; and that the <HI>Old Man</HI> was in a bad Condition. They made me to understand, that the Weather was not fit to go out, but they would watch if <HI>Robert</HI> would pass by. About an Hour or two after, one of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> being walking out on the Bay, met with <HI>Robert,</HI> and brought him into the House: We rejoiced to see him, and enquired concerning our <HI>Kinsman</HI> and Negro <HI>Ben.</HI> He said, our <HI>Kinsman</HI> was striving to get up, and could not; he came to him, and spake unto him; he could not answer, but cry'd, and he could not help him. But coming along, at some considerable distance, met Negro <HI>Ben,</HI> who said he was going for <HI>Benjamin Allen,</HI> so he past him. And some Miles further, he saw Negro <HI>Jack,</HI> drawing himself down from the Bank, his Lower Parts being dead, and crying out for some Fire, that he might save his Life; but did not see the Ne∣gro

Girl, whom we halled out of the Way. We were under a great Concern for our Kinsman; the <HI>Spaniards</HI> we could not prevail upon to go and fetch him, or go and carry wherewith to make a Fire; which had they done, and found them living, it might have preserved them. But we hoped Negro <HI>Ben.</HI> would bring our Kinsman. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> would have had most of us to have gone to the next Sentinal's House, which was a League farther, but we all begged hard of them to let us lye in their House, in any Place, on the Ground; for we were not able to travel further: Besides, the cold would kill us; for we were in such a trembling shaking Condition, and so full of pain, from Head to Foot, that it's not to be expressed. At length the <HI>Spaniards</HI> consented, that <HI>Robert Barrow, I,</HI> my <HI>Wife</HI> and <HI>Child,</HI> and <HI>John Smith,</HI> should lye in the House; but to <HI>Joseph Buckley, Nathaniel Ran∣dal, John Sheirs,</HI> and my Negro <HI>London,</HI> they would not grant that Favour. So one of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> taking a Fire-brand, bid these four to go with him; he directed them to a small Thicket of Trees, and shewed them to gather Wood, and make large Fires, and sleep there. These poor Creatures lay out, and it proved a hard frosty Night. The <HI>Spaniard</HI> returned and said, they were got into a Wood, and had Fire enough. We were silent, but feared they would hardly live till Morning.</P>
<P>After they were gone, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> took a Pint of <HI>In∣dian-Corn,</HI> and parched it, and gave part to us, which we accepted cheerfully; also they gave us some <HI>Casseena-drink</HI>▪ We were in extraordinary Pain, so that we could not rest▪ and our Feet were extremely bruised, the Skin was of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and the Sand caked with the Blood, that we could hard∣ly set our Feet to the Ground, after we had been som<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Time in the House.

Frost on the Ground; so it was terrible to go out of Doors. Our People returned from the Wood, but complained heavily of their Hardship in the Night. They had not been an Hour in the House before the <HI>Spaniards</HI> gave us all a Charge to be gone to the next Sentinal's House. This was greivious to us all, but more especially to my Wife, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho could not raise herself when down: But go we must; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> though we entreated hard for my Wife and <HI>Robert Barrow,</HI> we could not prevail that they might stay till we could get a Cannoo. As we were all going, one <HI>Spaniard</HI> made sign for me and my Wife to stay, which we did, and it was to have a Handful of parch'd Corn. As soon as we had received it, they bid us to be gone to the next Sentinel's, where was Victuals enough for us. The Sun was a great height, but we could not feel any warmth it gave; the <HI>North-Wester</HI> beginning to blow as hard as it did the Day before. And having deep Sand to travel through, which made our Travelling this one League very hard, especially to my Wife and <HI>Robert.</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI> lent my Wife a Blanket to be left at the next Sentinal's House.</P>
<P>At length we came to an Inlet of the Sea; on the other Side was the Look-out and Sentinal's House: Here were all our People sitting, waiting to be carried over, and in a little Time came one of the Sentinals, with a Can∣noo, and carried us over.</P>
<P>This Sentinal would not suffer us to come into his House, but caused us to kindle a Fire under the Lee of his House, and there sit down: About half an Hour after he bid us be gone to the next Sentinal's, which was a League further, giving us a Cup of <HI>Casseena,</HI> and two Quarts of <HI>Indian-Corn</HI> for us all, bidding us go to our Company at the next House, and get our Corn dress<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d there.</P>

When the Cannoo came over for us, our Guide took the Blanket from my Wife; but the <HI>Negro,</HI> which brought over the Cannoo, lent my Wife one of his Coats, so we got over; but before we got to the House, we had a Shower of Hail. At this House we were kindly received, having such a Mess of Victuals, as we had not had in a long Time before, which was very pleasant to our Hunger starv'd Stomachs. Our People went hence this Morning for <HI>Augusteen,</HI> having a Guide with them; but <HI>John Hosler</HI> and <HI>Penelope</HI> were left here, not being able to travel. We remained here till the Morrow, but the Night was so extream Cold, that we could not rest.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>15</HI>th of the <HI>9</HI>th Month; the <HI>1</HI>st of the Week.</HEAD>
<P>This Morning the <HI>Spaniards</HI> bid us prepare to travel, for they were not able to maintain us. We understood that it was five or six Leagues to <HI>Augusteen,</HI> and we could not travel so far, being all of us lamed and stiff: We in∣treated them to let us go in a Cannoo, but they denyed us: We intreated for the two <HI>Woman</HI> and <HI>Robert Barrow</HI>; at length we prevailed, that they should go up in a Can∣noo, for the Cannoo was to go, whether we went or no.</P>
<P>While all this Discourse was, came in a couple of <HI>Spaniards,</HI> one being the Sentinal that went with our People the Day before, the other was a Person the Governor had sent, with a Cannoo and four <HI>Spaniards,</HI> to fetch us; This was chear∣ful News; for had we gone to have travelled without a Guide, we should have perished. The Man that came for us, brought two Blankets, one for my <HI>Wife,</HI> the other for <HI>Penelope</HI>; he desired us to be going. About a League di∣stance from the Place, he left the Cannoo, which we part∣ed with very unwillingly; for some of our People, had they had a Mile further to have gone, could not have gone it: The Wind still continued at <HI>North-West,</HI> and blowed very fiercely, and extream Cold it was: We had such a con∣tinual Shivering, and Pain in our Bones, that we were in violent Anguish.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="006658_0068_10297709E05A5558"/>Our poor Child was quiet, but so black with Cold, and shaking, that it was admirable how it lived. We got to <HI>Augusteen</HI> about two Hours before Night; being put on Shore, we were directed to the Governor's House: Being got thither, we were had up a pair of Stairs, at the head whereof, stood the Governor, who ordered my Wife to be conducted to his Wife's Appartment. <HI>I</HI> and <HI>John Smi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h</HI> went into a Room, where the Governor asked us a few Questions; but seeing how extream cold we were, he gave us a Cup of <HI>Spanish-Wine,</HI> and sent us into his Kitchen to warm our selves at the Fire. About half an Hour afterwards, the Governor sent for <HI>John Smith</HI> and <HI>Me,</HI> and gave us a Shirt and Sliders, a Hat, and a pair of Silk Stockings; telling us, he had no Woollen Clothes as yet, but Would have some made: We put on the linnen, and made all haste into the Kitchen to the Fire. <HI>Robert Barrow</HI> was quartered at another House: The Persons came to the Governor's House, and took such as they were minded to Quarter in their Houses; so that <HI>Joseph Kirle, John Smith,</HI> I, my Wife and Child, lodged at the Governor's House. All our People that came up with <HI>Joseph Kirle,</HI> came to see us. We perceived the People's great Kindness; for they were all well cloth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, from Head to Foot, with the best the People had. <HI>Joseph Kirle</HI> began to tell us of his travel after he left us on the Bay, and how that they all concluded, that they should never see my Wife and Child, and <HI>Robert Barrow</HI> any more, if they did my Kins∣man and me, <HI>Richard Limpeney,</HI> and those that went with him, had a hard travel, for Thirty six Hours without ceasing; in which Travel, three of our <HI>Negroes,</HI> that went with them, were lost (viz, <HI>Jack, Caesar</HI> and <HI>Quenza</HI>) by sitting down to rest themselves, they were in a little Time to nummed, that they could not go, and there perished; so that we lost five in that Day's Travel, and began to doubt that <HI>Negro</HI> Ben perished also. <HI>Joseph Kirle</HI> said, that he thought he should have lost some of our People, in their Travel from the last Sentinal's hither, for they were much tyred, and the Cold violent, and the latter Part of that

Day's Journey, they waded for many Miles through much Water, and deep Sand-hills, and when they came in sight of <HI>Augusteen,</HI> they stayed for Boats to fetch them, in which Time, some nummed with the Cold; <HI>Joseph Kirle</HI> apply∣ed himself to the Governor on our behalfs, to send us help, for he doubted whether we were all living; the Gover∣nor readily assented, and forthwith sent for a Person fit for his purpose, charging him to get a <HI>Perriauger</HI> and Men, and go forthwith and fetch us, but the Tide fell out so that he could not go till Mid-night. The Governor was so concerned, that he would not go to Bed till they were gone; when the Tide served, he went to the Water-side, and saw the Men put off, giving them a strict Charge.</P>
<P><HI>Solomon Cresson</HI> began to tell us of his Travels from <HI>Jece,</HI> having most Part of the Way much Rain: The <HI>Indians</HI> were very kind unto him, until they came to the <HI>Indian-Town,</HI> where the <HI>Dutch-Men</HI> were killed; at which Place, some of those <HI>Indians</HI> made a discovery of him to be no <HI>Spaniard</HI>: They said nothing to him thereof, but were very dogged to him, giving him no Food, and causing him to lie on the Ground, amongst Vermine. On the Morrow he was to go with his former Company, who were grown so extreamly bitter, and envious to him, that when they did but look upon him, they were ready to smite him; having gone until about mid-day, passing an Inlet, the Weather being extream bad, with Wind, Rain and much Cold, they put on Shoar (this was the place where we put on Shoar, and got <HI>Water-Soilders,</HI> and stayed for the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> when he went back to look for our People, that were to follow us in a <HI>Cannoo</HI>) but the Rage of these Bloody People was such, that he expect∣ed to Dye. being on Shoar they readily kindled a Fire, about which time he heard a noise of a Boat and Oars, and presently the Spanish <HI>Perreauger</HI> put on Shoar up∣on them: The <HI>Indians</HI> were extraordinarily surprized, and stood amazed, but <HI>Solomon</HI> was glad to see them, and they him: The <HI>Spaniards</HI> took the old <HI>Cassekey</HI>'s Chest, and whatever he had from him, commanding them
<PB N="62" REF="006658_0070_1029770E6FB7F140"/>
to return to the <HI>Indian</HI>-Towns from whence they came; staying a Night, the next Morning the <HI>Spaniards</HI> sent <HI>Solomon</HI> under the Conduct of two <HI>Indians,</HI> belonging to these Towns, who were commanded by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to carry <HI>Solomon</HI> unto the Sentinal's House, but these two <HI>Indians</HI> carried him a little beyond the Place where we put on Shoar to Travel, and they seem'd as though they had Mischief in their Hearts against him: He asked if they would go forward? But they looking untoward∣ly on him, answered him not: So he went himself, and was glad when he saw they did not follow him.</P>
<P>But we were desirous to know how the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had knowledge of us, which it seems was thus:</P>
<P>When we got to <HI>Jece,</HI> where <HI>Smith</HI> and his Com∣pany were, and we going under the Denomination of <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and the other <HI>English,</HI> the report of us run from <HI>Indian</HI>-Town to <HI>Indian</HI>-Town, to the <HI>Northward,</HI> unto the <HI>Northernmost</HI> Town, at which Town were two or more <HI>Indians</HI> that were converted to the <HI>Romish-Faith</HI>: These, or one of these, went to the next <HI>Spanish</HI> Senti∣nal's, and gave an Account that he heard, that there were two Vessels cast away to the <HI>Southward</HI> of <HI>Jece,</HI> one being a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> the other an <HI>English</HI> Vessel; the <HI>Spaniards</HI> having two Vessels gone for the <HI>Havana,</HI> to seek for supplies, feared it was those Vessels: And the same day as this News came to the Governour of <HI>Au∣gusteen,</HI> came also News of one of their Fryar's being murdered by some of the <HI>Cape Indians.</HI> After this man∣ner we understood it, <HI>viz.</HI> Three Fryars being under a Vow to go amongst the <HI>Indians</HI> on the <HI>Cape</HI> to Con∣vert them; they went to a certain Town to the <HI>North∣ward,</HI> off where we were cast away, but it lay within the Sound. The <HI>Cassekey</HI> of this Town they gained on, to embrace the <HI>Roman-Faith,</HI> but all his People were much incensed against the Fryars, and therefore would have their Cassekey renounce his Faith, and put the Fryars to Death; but he would Assent to neither; therefore they killed him and one Fryar, the other two escaped: Here∣upon

<P>This Morning we had Ice half an Inch thick, and it had been for some Mornings past, but as the Sun riseth it's gone.</P>
<P>The Governour came this Morning to our Apartment inquiring how we did: We having had Chocolate for Breakfast, he asked if we would have any thing else that his House could afford; If we would but ask, it should be brought us: But we modestly answered. That this was sufficient, although our Appetites were not to be satisfied. The Governour stated the Poverty of the Country unto us. The Place is a Garrison, maintain'd one half by the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> the other half by the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> The Male Inhabitants are all Sol∣diers, every one receiving Pay according to their Post. A Sentinal's Pay is 150 pieces of Eight a Year: And all their supply of Bread, Cloathing and Money, comes from the <HI>Havana</HI> and <HI>Porto-Bello</HI>: And it is going on of three Years, since they have had a Vessel from any place whatsoever, which makes their Wants very great; all things being expended, except Ammunition and Salt, of which they said they had enough. The Governour offered us the Freedom of what his House afforded, with∣al, gave us a Charge to be careful in going abroad, especially of some Persons that did not affect our Na∣tion: We promissed to be ruled, and submit to the Go∣vernour's Pleasure for our Liberty. Our People came in, and we told them the Caution; but they s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id, They had been all over the Town, and in many Houses, where
<PB N="64" REF="006658_0072_102977119DFBC800"/>
they were kindly received, and such as the People had, they would give them. They told us of some English that liv'd here, and they had been at their Houses: the chiefest in esteem, was one <HI>William Carr</HI> of the <HI>Isle</HI> of <HI>Man,</HI> who about thirty Years ago, was in a Vessel bound for <HI>South-Carolina,</HI> but missing their Port, were cast a∣way nigh this Port; many were drowned, but he, and some others, were brought hither by the <HI>Indians,</HI> some of them got away in <HI>Spanish</HI> Vessels, others dyed here: This Man turned <HI>Roman Catholick,</HI> and Married a <HI>Span∣ish</HI> Woman, of whom he had seven Children, and is an Officer in the Garrison; He was chief Interpreter.</P>
<P>This Day came <HI>Joseph Kirle</HI>'s Negro <HI>Ben,</HI> he gave us this Account, That after we had sent him back, he having looked, and not finding my Kinsman, went to seek for a place to shelter himself from the Cold, and some place he found to creep in, where he lay down, and continued there all Night, but by Morning, was so stiff with Cold that he could not use his Legs, but halled himself towards the Bay. The <HI>Spaniard,</HI> our Guide, from the first Sentry-house, the Morning after we went thence, returned along the Bay, to see if any of our People were living; but he found all dead, except Negro <HI>Ben.</HI> and he getting a Fire made, Negro <HI>Ben.</HI> was recovered, and got the use of his Limbs.</P>
<P><HI>William Carr,</HI> the interpreter, acquainted u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, That the <HI>Governour,</HI> and two Royal Officers, would examine us, concerning our being cast aw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, and what Goods and Moneys was lost in our Vessel, and concerning our Hard∣ships among the <HI>Florida-Indians,</HI> &amp;c. Which was done and every one did sign it. This took up two or three Days time to compleat it. After this was done the Go∣vernour told us, that he expected Captain <HI>Sebastian Lo∣pas</HI> in some few Days; and after his Arrival, he would provide for our going to <HI>Carolina,</HI> with <HI>Cannoos,</HI> and Men to guard us.</P>

<P>This Day the Governour sent for us, and told us, That he would give us credit for what we and the rest of the Company, would.

<P>About this time, <HI>Robert Barrow</HI> was taken with a grievous Belly-ach; after which he fell into a violent Flux.

We having the <HI>Cassekey</HI> of St. <HI>Juan</HI> with us, sent him away last Night, to see if he could meet any of the <HI>Yammawsee-Indians</HI> of <HI>Carolina,</HI> he being acquainted with and related to them; but this <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>o</HI> passed him: We set forward, and rowed all the day, till about an hour before Sun-set, and then we put on Shoar at an <HI>Indian-Field,</HI> which was overgrown with <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge,</HI> it be∣ing low wet Land: Here we made our accustomed Pro∣vision for Lodging, lying this N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght in a Wood, having dressed Victuals for this time, and to Morrow; and hav∣ing rested well this Night, about Day-break or sooner, we left th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s place.</P>

Not passing two hours, the <HI>Cassekey</HI> was sent before to make discovery, and we followed, rowing until an hour before Sun-set, by which time we got to the place, called St. <HI>Catalena,</HI> where hath been a great Settlement of <HI>Indians,</HI> for the Land hath been cleared for Planting, for some Miles distant: Here also we met the <HI>Cassekey</HI>; also a <HI>Canoo</HI> of <HI>Caro∣lina-Indians,</HI> being a Man, his Wife, and Children, having his Dogs, and other <HI>Hunting Implements,</HI> for to lye out this Winter Season. The <HI>Spanish</HI> Captain, by his Interpreter, dis∣coursed him about carrying our Letters, which he readily as∣sented unto; whereupon the <HI>Spanish</HI> Captain set himself to writ∣ing to the Governor of Carolina.</P>
<P>We had a large Field to lye in, and no manner of Shelter but what was a Mile distant or more; but we spared not pains, but some fell to cutting of Boughs and Brush, at that great distance, some to carrying it to the Place, some to get Fire-Wood, so that by Night we had a brave Shelter.</P>
<P>The Spanish Captain sent for me, to write to the Gover∣nor of Carolina; which I did: I wrote also to a Person of my acquaintance there. The Letters being finished, and Night coming on, I delivered my Letters to the Captain, and return∣ed to my Company. By this time they had compleated our Booth, which we thought was sufficient, if no Rain fell. We provided our Victuals for our Supper, and for the next Day's Travel; as also some dry Grass to lye on, in hopes of resting well this Night. About ten at Night the <HI>Carolina-Indians</HI> went with our Letters for <HI>Carolina.</HI></P>

<P>The Night was exteam Foggy, and so was this Morning; but we searched about and found our Passage, being a little Channel just broad enough for our Boats to pass, and a Mile in length. After we past this, we came into a great Sound, which went down into a large Inlet, that the <HI>Land</HI> could not be seen from the one side to the other. Into the Sound comes down a great River, called the <HI>Savanna-River</HI>; which, when we got into the Course of it, the Water was fresh, tho' in this great Sound; the <HI>Spaniards</HI> called it, the <HI>Cross-Bar,</HI> or <HI>St. a Cruce.</HI> About Noon we got over this Sound; and here we rowed out to Sea for two Leagues, to get into another Sound. And about three a Clock, the Wind began to blow at <HI>North-East,</HI> and it looked very black, so that we feared a Storm. We desired to get on Shoar, to provide against it; but the Captain said, about a few Leagues further we should get near <HI>Port-Royal</HI>: But in the interim, we saw a <HI>Cannoo</HI> on the Shoar; we made to her, and there we found some <HI>In∣dian Wigwams:</HI> Here we went on Shoar. This was a <HI>Cannoo,</HI> laden with Skins, that belonged to Merchants at <HI>Carolina,</HI> having four <HI>Indians</HI> belonging to her, but three of them run away fearing the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and one stay'd.
