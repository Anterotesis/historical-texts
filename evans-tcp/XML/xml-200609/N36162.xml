<P>PATRIOTS! By this short ensuing Scheme, you will perceive the subject of it, viz. a Plan calculated to thrive, without the assistance of the peculator's Bank, and the most effectual method of preserving the Common∣alty or middling sort of the People, and raising the Poor, which is congruous to the doctrine of Equality.</P>

<HEAD>To George Washington, AND TO ALL THE OTHER GENUINE AMERICAN PATRIOTS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Philadelphia,
<DATE>March 17, 1794.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE reason of my presuming to address you on the subject of the culture of Wool, is, because it is a matter on which the gradual abolition of our National Debt depend, i. e. upon industry and population of America, as the same is held forth in the following observations. That this is the real fact, I shall now undertake to prove: so always, and provided, That you will patronize the following scheme— What say you, Gentlemen, to this matter?—Now this great principle of patriotism, I prove thus:</P>
<P>Permit me, gentlemen, in passing, just to observe, that here, and no where else, lies all the <HI>life</HI> of our true policy —To cloath and feed ourselves, and our neighbouring na∣tions. I take this as a <HI>postulatum</HI> that will without difficulty be granted.</P>
<P>Therefore,</P>
<P>Secondly, I shall, gentlemen, open myself fully on that important subject; not for the sake of telling you a long sto∣ry (which I know the genuine patriots, are not particularly fond of) but for the sake of the weighty instruction that I flatter myself, will necessarily result from our Shepherd's scheme. It shall not be longer if I can help it, than so se∣rious a matter requires. The American Shepherd addresses us in this manner: He says, the reasons for my preferring this Shepherd's scheme, are: <HI>First,</HI> It is because I want to see a plan for improving the present condition of the poor white people. <HI>Next,</HI> It is because I wish to be beneficial to my country. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> It is because I wish to throw my mite into the best public treasury, and therein improve it.</P>
<P>Come—help me raise the ever memorable Shepherd's Hall, and the profit thereof will be commensurable to your
<PB N="5" REF="047213_0004_1022B82B4D742338"/>
public spirit: yes, and will be your exceeding great reward. I labour not for myself only, but for all them that patronize the said scheme.</P>
<P>He says, too, the position by me maintained is, that this scheme is more excellent, than the Yankie's Tontine bank; which is as follows:</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> It is a scheme to increase the declining number of sheep in America, and make wool our staple commodity.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The short of the matter is this: Let it be sup∣posed, that a number of well disposed persons appropriate a <HI>small sum</HI> of money each to the culture of wool.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Again, let it be supposed, that 6000 sheep may be pastured three miles round the Shepherd's Hall. Now here arises a necessary query to those well disposed persons, viz. What will three years produce of the said pasture be?</P>
<P>That the culture of wool will produce an incredible trea∣sury may be seen from the English manufactures. This scheme properly executed will make the American exports exceed her imports, which is the highest degree of our American patri∣otism. Q. E. D.</P>
<P>Again, let it be supposed, that government will be propi∣tious to the said Shepherd's company, and give them a tract of land, &amp;c. And that government will lend them a sum of money at 4 per cent. The reason whereof is, because the increase of the people will by industry reimburse the costs, and populate or furnish a barren part of our land with the best sort of people. Three things are here very remarkable: <HI>First,</HI> That the state will thereby obtain 4 per cent. <HI>Second∣ly,</HI> That government will thereby obtain a number of useful people. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> That government will thereby thus obtain the mechanic arts, and that this plan <HI>properly executed</HI> will employ a number of emigrants, viz. Shepherds, Ploughmen, and many other artificers, &amp;c. in all an industrious and inde∣pendent city.</P>
<P>To conclude: The jealous Britons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><LETTER>

<P><HI>NOTICE TO FARMERS.</HI>—HARRY D. GOUGH, has a num∣ber of fine Ram Lambs, of his broad-tailed Persian Breed. Those who wish to be supplied, must give information, in writing, before the 20th of April next, appointing some person, in Baltimore-Town, to recieve them, to whom they will be delivered about the 15th of September. The price, as heretofore, Twenty Dollars. Several gentlemen were disappointed last year, by not applying in time; for, after the 20th of April, no application can be attended to.</P>

<PB N="6" REF="047213_0005_1022B82CE791B708"/>
<HI>viz.</HI>—That no English <HI>ram</HI> should be conveigled to North America; a plain proof this, that we may make wool a sta∣ple commodity, and out-vie England: just in proportion to the differential quantity of the land in England, and the quantity of land in the United States of America. All that I would be understood to imply, is, that when the number of our sheep increase proportionable to the number of our acres of land; then we shall actually and <HI>de facto</HI> out-vie Eng∣land, and thereby make ourselves independent, or not de∣pend upon England, &amp;c. or not depend upon manufactories. It is plain, therefore, that our imports of woollen drapery will there by decrease, and our exportation of woollen drape∣ry will thereby increase.</P>
<P>What has been said, respective to the nature of the pre∣ceding scheme implies its importance. But the way to facili∣tate it will more fully appear in considering the formation of the articles of the company of the American Shepherds.</P>
<P>☞ N. B. Observe—that the subscription money <HI>is not</HI> to be paid until the said company shall be established with ar∣ticles, and a power sufficient to take this matter in hand. When once a company can be established, with a fund suffici∣ent to begin, there is no doubt but that it will have 6000 sheep in every county in each state: yes, 6000 sheep in every American township.</P>
<P>To constitute the capital of the said company, subscriptions for shares therein, at one Spanish dollar each, payable after the articles of the said company are made, and when a suf∣ficient number of persons have subscribed, they will have the right to form the articles of the constitution of their com∣pany of the American Shepherds.</P>
<P>Any person, partnership, society, church, or body politic, may subscribe for as many shares as he, she, or they may think proper.</P>
<P>Books, for the purpose of subscribers entering their names, &amp;c. will be handed about by divers well disposed persons.</P>

your well disposed, and most neglected servant, PASTOR AMERICANUS.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT;</HEAD>
<P>BEING a short caution and warning to the careless inha∣bitants of the United States of North-America, and miscel∣laneous notes on the folly, shame, and danger, of our be∣ing dependant on the <HI>British,</HI> and other foreign markets.</P>
<P>Note 1. Americans! This—all this—is pre-meditat∣ed against you, <HI>viz.</HI> War and ruin, by the perfidious court of London. It is plain, therefore, that we ought to prohibit her merchandize.</P>
<P>Note 2. Our present mercantile system is—that we de∣pend on the culture of European wool; if so, then we are <HI>not yet</HI> independent! Is this common sense? Is this a proof of our being independent? Is this the way to pay our Nati∣onal debt? Is this a prudent scheme? Whoever thinks so, must be little acquainted with independency, and domestic manufactures.</P>
<P>Let it be supposed, that the murrain among the European sheep, and the pestilence, or an epidemical fever among the European people occasion the culture and manufactures of European wool to fail; if so, then the indolent Americans shall look to the culture of American wool, and see that they are all naked, the rich and the poor, and are not ashamed.
<Q>This being <HI>sub judice</HI> it is only prophetic; and what is prophecy but a narrative preceding the fact.</Q></P>
<P>Note 3. Being an extract of a letter from Calcutta, dated the 10th of November 1791.—
<Q>We should think that no cotton can be carried home from Bombay this year, and even the year following. They have had about Surat and those places a most dreadful famine, which occasioned an unheard of mortality among the natives. When this ca∣lamity will end, is not known yet: and those of the inha∣bitants who serve it, will first think of cultivating rice be∣fore they meddle with cotten.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You cannot expect a single pound of cotten from this country; whatever quantity we have here, will all go to China.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Claypoole's Daily Advertiser, dated August 9, 1792.</NOTE>—I must add, that this extract is an apology for the preceding letter, and for the miscellaneous notes add∣ed to it.</P>
<P>Note 4. Argument 1. It is argued, That if our Ameri∣can hat-makers buy imported, foreign Wool, and that the
<PB N="8" REF="047213_0007_1022B83458B2AD78"/>
directors of our National Manufactory give a generous price for American Wool; then it is high time to make Wool our staple commodity:</P>
<P>But the <HI>first</HI> is true; therefore also the <HI>last.</HI></P>
<P>Note 5. Argument 2. If too great attention to com∣merce will soon introduce idleness and luxury; and though it may enrich a few particular persons, it will impoverish the country—then our government will one day be a mere bank∣rupt.</P>
<P>But the <HI>first</HI> is true—Ergo also the second will be true.</P>
<P>Note 6. Argument 3. By improving the productions of Nature, by manufactures, the national riches are aug∣mented, and it is by carrying these fruits of industry to other nations, that a solid commerce is established in a great empire. —The American merchant will make his own reflections.</P>
<P>Note 7. This—being the one only way to be independent of England, ought to determine your doubts on this head. Let this then, my countrymen, call forth your considera∣tion. The subject is public good, and certainly merits, by its importance, the attention of every person in woollen drapery.</P>
<P>Any person who may reject this scheme, is requested to produce a better.—That I do in <HI>Truth</HI>—what all pre∣tend, and most men believe they do; I love my country.— This disposition has moved me to do, what every man ought to do, to given attention to its interest, and to endeavour to promote its good.</P>
