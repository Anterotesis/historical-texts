</FIGURE> By His EXCELLENCY, Richard, Earl of Bellomont, Captain General and GOVERNOUR in Chief of the said Province, &amp;c. A Proclamation.</HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS I have Received credible Information That some evil-minded and wicked Emissaries, ma∣liciously designing and intending to disturb the peace and tranquility of His Majesties Good Subjects within His Majesties Provinces &amp; Colonies in America, have been imployed and industriously endeavoured falsely to suggest and in∣sinuate to the Indians of the several Plantations within the same, as if his Majesty had withdrawn his Protection from them; and designed to cut off and utterly extirpate them. By which lying Reports many of the said Indians have been abused and put in fear, and are said to have entred into a Combination and Confederacy, and to be drawn together in considerable Num∣bers, threatning a general Insurrection, and in a hostile manner to fall upon his Majesties Subjects the English.</P>
<P>I have therefore, upon a motion from the Assembly now Sitting, and by and with the Advice and Consent of His Majesties Council, thought fit to Emit and Publish this Proclamation; hereby Commanding and Requiring all His Majesties Lov∣ing Subjects within this His Majesties Province of the Massachusetts Bay, speedily to endeavour by all opportunities and possible ways and means that they can, to undeceive the said Indians, and to inform them of the utter Falsehood and Untruth of any such Report; and on the contrary to assure them, as I do hereby assure them of His Majesties good Inclinations and Favour, and continuing of them under His Protection, whilst they demean themselves peaceably, and remain in their Subjection &amp; Obedience unto His Majesty and His Government. Also Requiring all persons to avoid giving any just provocation unto any of the Indians, or begetting any quarrel with them: however in the mean time and during the threatned danger, to be very careful and vigilant in observing the behaviour and motions of the Indians, and for that purpose to keep out Scouts and Espials; and by all due ways and means to provide for their own safety and defence: And by force of Arms to Repel and Resist any hostile Attack or violence which the Indians shall attempt to offer or make upon them.</P>
<P>Given at the Council-Chamber in <HI>Boston</HI> the Fourteenth Day of <HI>March,</HI> 1699. And in the Twelfth Year of the Reign of our Sovereign Lord, <HI>WILLIAM</HI> the Third by the Grace of GOD, of <HI>England, Scotland, France</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> KING, <HI>Defender of the Faith,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
