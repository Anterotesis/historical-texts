<HEAD>THE PREFACE TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.</HEAD>
<P>B<HI>Eing lately informed, that the</HI> Quakers <HI>had left a Paper</HI> (with a Gentleman in these Islands) <HI>intimating a chalenge to the</HI> Mini∣sters <HI>here,</HI> <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Whether the Ministers God, or the Qua∣kers▪ God, were the true God; <HI>little notice was taken of this their</HI> Folly: <HI>in a short time afterwards, a</HI> Justice of the Peace <HI>acquainted me, that a</HI> Quaker <HI>brought him a Letter, and would have him deliver it unto me, but he refused to receive it from him: And some few dayes after this, an</HI> honest Neighbour <HI>told me, that the</HI> Quakers <HI>had reported up and down the Countrey, sc.</HI> That I would as soon take a Bear by the Tooth, as Dispute with them: <HI>and withal, that thereby the</HI> Leading Qua∣kers <HI>did confirm and increase their party: Hereupon I sent unto them</HI> (a Sy∣nagogue of Libertines) <HI>the Charge in the</HI> Title Page <HI>asserted,</HI> [Being Answers to three short Questions.] <HI>And in the Paper</HI> (which was sent the 15<HI>th.</HI> day of <HI>April</HI> 1678.) <HI>they were informed, that I would be ready to prove</HI> (from the Holy Scriptures) <HI>the charge against them: upon the mo∣dest motion of any one or more</HI> Quakers <HI>in these</HI> Islands, (<HI>on any</HI> Lecture-day <HI>in</HI> Devon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hier-Tribe Church) <HI>in order to a</HI> Regular <HI>and</HI> Peaceable <HI>Dis∣putation, for the investigation of the Truth of the true God; which</HI> Paper <HI>the</HI> Quakers <HI>received and accepted. And according to the general Directi∣ons therein given, they came</HI> (the first day of <HI>May</HI> following, <HI>to the place assigned,</HI> (but without giving me any special notice of it,) <HI>Then</HI> Francis Eastlack, <HI>a</HI> Teacher <HI>amongst them, moved for a performance of my promise, in reference to the Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge (which he called a</HI> Chalenge) <HI>under my hand a∣gainst them: I forthwith told him, that I was ready</HI> (by Christs help) <HI>to do it: howbeit, by the way (as I told them) I thought it fit to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ignifie unto them,</HI> sc. <HI>That as they had accepted the</HI> Paper <HI>which I had sent to them, so they had there∣by bound themselves to all the terms and conditions therein expressed: as</HI> Name∣ly. 1. <HI>That the Disputation is to be</HI> Regular; <HI>that is to say, I am (in the first place) to prove the whole</HI> Charge, <HI>without any interruption from any one of you; That then any one or more of you may (without interruptions from me) answer my Arguments, or give your Assent.</HI> 2. <HI>That the Disputation is to be</HI> peaceable; <HI>that is to say, one person only</HI> (at a time) <HI>is to Answer; That the Disputation may not end</HI> (as usually such kind of Disputes have done) <HI>in an unprofitable Confusion, but to the satisfaction of the numerous, and ju∣diciou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hearers: And that at the end of all,</HI> They <HI>may judge (according to

<HEAD>The First Part of the Charge; is
THat a Quakers pretended Saviour within him, is not the true Christ, but the false Christ, the Devil.</HEAD>
<P>Which was proved by four <HI>Apostolical Arguments.</HI></P>
<Q><P><HI>Arg.</HI> 1. Because, Jesus Christ of <HI>Nazareth</HI> a Man approved of God among the People, was and is the true Christ, and our only Saviour: which is frequently testified in the Acts of the <HI>Apostles:</HI> as in</P>
<P><HI>Act</HI> 2. <HI>v r.</HI> 22, 23 36. Ye Men of <HI>Israel,</HI> hear these words, Jesus of <HI>Nazareth</HI> a Man approved of God among you, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have Crucified and Slain: Let all the House of <HI>Israel</HI> know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have Crucified both Lord and Christ.</P>
<P><HI>Acts.</HI> 4. 10,11,12. Be it known unto you all, and unto all the people of <HI>Israel,</HI> that by the Name of Jesus Christ of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> whom ye Crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him, doth this Man stand here before you whole: this is the Stone, which was set at nought of your builders, which is become the head of the corner; neither is there Salvation in any other; for there is none other Name (<HI>sc.</HI> then the Name of Jesus Christ of <HI>Nazareth</HI>) under Heaven given among Men, whereby we must be saved.</P>
<P><HI>Acts</HI> 10 38,39,40 42,43. God anointed Jesus of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> with the Holy Ghost, and with power: Whom they (<HI>Jews</HI>) flew and hang∣ed on a Tree: Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him o∣penly: And he commanded us, to Preach unto the People, and to te∣stifie that it is he which was ordained of God, to be the judge of quick and dead: To him give all the Prophets witness, that through his Name whosoever believeth in him, shall receive remission of sins.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="2" REF="000313_0006_0FA4A9E10FE5CB30"/>
<HI>From these Texts of Scripture, the</HI> 1<HI>st.</HI> Argument <HI>did arise:</HI> To wit,</P>
<Q><P>If Jesus Christ of <HI>Nazareth</HI> a Man approved of God among the People of <HI>Israel,</HI> be the true Christ and only Saviour, then a <HI>Quakers</HI> pretended Saviour within him, is not the true Christ:</P>
<P>But Jesus Christ of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> a Man approved of God among the People, was and is the true Christ and our only Saviour; therefore, a <HI>Quakers</HI> pretended Saviour within him, is not the true, but false Christ.</P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> 2. Because the Saints of God (by the direction of his Spirit) have alwayes acknowledged the Man Jesus Christ, to be their true and only Saviour: as in</P>
<P><HI>Luk.</HI> 2. 25,26,27,28,29,30,31. And behold, there was a Man in <HI>Je∣rusalem,</HI> whose Name was <HI>Simeon,</HI> and it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lords Christ; and he came by Spirit into the Temple; and when the Parents brought in the Child Jesus; then he took him up in his Arms, and bles∣sed God, and said, Lord, now lettest thou thy Servant depart in peace, according to thy word; for mine eyes have seen thy Salvation, which thou hast prepared before the face of all people, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Joh.</HI> 20.27,28. Then said Jesus unto <HI>Thomas,</HI> reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side, and be not faithless, but believing: and <HI>Thomas</HI> answered and said unto him (by the spirit of Faith) my Lord and my God.</P>
<P><HI>Joh.</HI> 4 42. And said unto the Woman, now we believe, not because of thy saying, for we have heard him (the Man Christ, <HI>ver.</HI> 29.) our selves, and we know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the World.</P></Q>
<P><HI>From these Scriptures the Second</HI> Argument <HI>was Formed,</HI> sc.</P>
<Q><P>If the Saints of God have (by the Holy Spirits direction) alwayes acknowledged, the Man Jesus Christ, to be the true Christ, and only Sa∣viour: then a <HI>Quakers</HI> pretended Saviour within him, is not the true Christ.</P>
<P>But the Saints of God have (by the Spirits direction) alwayes ac∣knowled the Man Jesus Christ, for their true and only Saviour. There∣fore a <HI>Quakers</HI> pretended Saviour within him, is not the true but false Christ.</P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> 3. Because the true Christ and our only Saviour, did at once (without us) in and by his one crucified body on the Cross, finish and compleat the work and office of a Saviour: as in</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="000313_0007_0FA4A9E196A9F8B0"/>
<HI>Heb.</HI> 10. 12,14. By the which will we are Sanctified, (<HI>that is, Saved</HI>) through the Offering of the Body of Jesus Christ once for all: And this man alter he had offered one Sacrifice for sins, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or ever sate down on the right hand of God; for by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are Sanctified.</P>
<P><HI>Heb.</HI> 2. 14. Forasmuch then as the Children are partakers of flesh and blood, he (<HI>Jesus, ver.</HI> 9.) also himself likewise took part of the same, that through death, he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the Devil.</P>
<P N="1">1.<HI>Pet.</HI> 3. 24. Who his own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our sins, in his own body on the tree, <HI>and in</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.18. For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust (that he might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> us to God) being put to Death in the flesh, but quickened by the spirit.</P>
<P><HI>Eph.</HI> 2. 15. 16. Having abolished in his flesh the enmity,—having slain the enmity in himself on the Cross, so making peace: <HI>and in Chap.</HI> 5. 2. As Christ hath given himself for us, an offering, and a Sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling favour.</P>
<P><HI>Heb.</HI> 9.26. But now once in the end of the World, hath he appeared to put away sin, by the Sacrifice of himself: <HI>and in Col.</HI> 1. 22. In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy, and unblameable, and unreprovable<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n his sight.</P></Q>
<P><HI>From these Scriptures the third Argument resulted.</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<Q><P>If the true Christ, and our only Saviour, did at once (without us) in and by his one crucified body on the Cross, finish and perfect the work and office of a Saviour; then a <HI>Quakers</HI> pretended Saviour with∣in him, is not the true Christ.</P>
<P>But the true Christ, and one only Saviour, did at once (without us) in and by his one crucified Body on the Cross, finish and perfect the whole work and office of a Saviour: Therefore a <HI>Quakers</HI> pretended Saviour within him, is not the true, but the false Christ.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>th. Argument:</HI> Because, the true Christ, and our only Saviour is in Heaven above us: As in</P>
<P><HI>Luk.</HI> 24. 46,48,50,51. And Jesus said unto them (his Apostles) thus it was written, and thus it beh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day. And ye are witnesses of these things. And led them out as far as <HI>Bethany.</HI> And he lift up his hands and blessed them: And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them and carried up into Heaven.</P>
<P><HI>Mark</HI> 6. 19 So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e on the right hand of God.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="000313_0008_0FA4A9E476DB3298"/>
<HI>Act.</HI> 1. 11. 'Ye men of <HI>Galilee,</HI> why stand ye gazing into Heaven, this same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner, as ye have seen him go into heaven.</P>
<P><HI>Act.</HI> 3. 13,21. 'The God of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and of <HI>Isaac,</HI> and of <HI>Jacob,</HI> the God of our Fathers hath glorified his Son Jesus. Whom the hea∣vens must receive until the times of restitution of all things.</P>
<P><HI>Heb.</HI> 9.24. 'For Christ is not entred into the holy places made with hands,—but into heaven it self, now to appear in the presence of God for us.</P>
<P><HI>Act.</HI> 7 55 56. 'But he (<HI>Stephen</HI>) being full of the Holy Ghost, look∣ing up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the Glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God:—And said, Behold I see the hea∣vens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.</P></Q>
<P><HI>From these Scriptures the fourth Argument was formed:</HI> sc.</P>
<Q><P>If the true Christ, and our only Saviour be in Heaven above us, then a <HI>Quakers</HI> pretended Saviour within him, is not the true Christ.</P>
<P>But the true Christ, and our only Saviour is in Heaven above us. Therefore, a <HI>Quakers</HI> pretended Saviour within him, is not the true but the false Christ.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> That by the <HI>false Christ,</HI> we are to understand the <HI>Devil,</HI> is plainly proved, by comparing, <HI>Mat.</HI> 24. <HI>ver.</HI> 24. with <HI>Rev.</HI> 12,9. in the first Text, the <HI>true Christ</HI> calls the false Christ a <HI>Deceiver, if it were possi∣ble, shall deceive the very Elect;</HI> implying, that the false Christ is the great∣est <HI>Deceiver:</HI> And in the other Text, this great <HI>Deceiver, which deceive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the whole World, is called the old Serpent, the Devil, and Satan.</HI></P>
<P>Here hence this Argument arose, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e that is the great and principal <HI>Deceiver,</HI> is the Devil, (<HI>Rev▪</HI> 12. 9.) but the false Christ is this <HI>Deceiver</HI> (<HI>Mat.</HI> 24 24.) <HI>Ergo,</HI> the false Christ is the Devil: The Conclusion ought not to be denied; to deny it here, were to deny the <HI>Scriptures of God,</HI> from whence it is plainly <HI>collected</HI> as above.</P>
<P>Having thus proved the <HI>first Part,</HI> I proceeded to the <HI>second Part</HI> of the charge: <HI>To wit,</HI></P>
<Q><P><HI>That the main end of the Quakers Meetings in these Islands, is to make the Lords Christ, his holy Spirit, his Angels, and Apostles all, by art, and false Witnesses of God.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Being about to prove <HI>this,</HI> as I had done the <HI>former part</HI> of the charge: <HI>F. E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>stlack</HI> interrupted me, pretending to make some <HI>Answer</HI> to the <HI>foregoing Arguments:</HI> I told him, that by mutual consent (as in the <HI>Pre∣face</HI> is Declared) the whole charge against them, was first to be proved by me, before any <HI>Answer</HI> should be returned by him, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any other of his
<PB N="5" REF="000313_0009_0FA4A9E5255CDD78"/>
<HI>Friends;</HI> Therefore, I requested him, that as he had any regard either to <HI>Truth</HI> or <HI>Honesty,</HI> that he would forbear his interruptions; that I might proceed (according <HI>agreement</HI> as above) to prove the <HI>second part</HI> of the charge: but his <HI>Sepulchre</HI> being opened, he refused to shut it: whereupon I spake to the <HI>Assembly,</HI> saying, I must let him take his own way, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o prevent greater confusion: howbeit instead of Answering (<HI>as he pretended the above∣mentioned</HI>) <HI>Arguments,</HI> or any of them: He first impertinently runs out, in∣to a bare Repetition of, some words in the former part of the first Chapter of the <HI>Evangelist John,</HI> sc. from the 1<HI>st.</HI> verse to the end of the 12<HI>th.</HI> verse, which shall be mentioned and considered in their due places: let me note by the way, his after stragling inferences from those verses: To wit, <HI>That God the Word, took Flesh of the Virgin Mary, and in that Flesh suffered Death for all men,</HI> (which he put a special <HI>Remark upon,</HI> by repeating it twice) it was well observed, that he made no mention of <HI>Christs Resur∣rection,</HI> but further said, <HI>sc. The Word which is God, is Christ; the true Light, which was manifest in the flesh, and as in him, so in every man that comes into the World, as manifest in them, which</HI> quoth he) <HI>is witnessed by John▪</HI> and withal added, <HI>whosoever shall Preach any other Gospel is accursed;</HI> and after he had multiplied words to the same end and purpose alone as above; the ingenious <HI>Auditors</HI> began to mutter at his <HI>impertinences, and jumbled confusions:</HI> Thereupon I called to him, and said, <HI>Master I slay</HI> (so he is commonly called, as afore notch, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>I slay</HI>) either answer the Arguments which have proved the <HI>first part</HI> of the charge, (as you pre∣tended, to <HI>Mask</HI> your interrupting of me, or take some <HI>Answer</HI> to what you have said: His first Reply was, the Scripture <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith, <HI>Call no man Master,</HI> I told him the Scripture saith, <HI>sc. Mat.</HI> 23. 10 <HI>Neither be ye called Masters, for one is your Master even Christ;</HI> which is not to be un∣derstood in your <HI>unmannerly</HI> sense: likewise I told him that he had no cause to <HI>quarrel</HI> the word [<HI>Master</HI>] for <HI>you</HI> affirm the <HI>Master,</HI> (<HI>even Christ</HI>) is within you <HI>Quakers,</HI> making your selves the greatest <HI>Masters;</HI> so that <HI>herein</HI> are fulfilled among you, the word of our Lord concerning <HI>Decei∣vers,</HI> namely, <HI>that false Christs shall arise, and many shall say, I am Christ, and shall deceive many,</HI> Mat. 24.5. Further more I said unto him, <HI>sc. Thou art the Master of an Assembly,</HI> to wit <HI>of the Synagogue of Libertines:</HI> which opposed and persecuted the faith of <HI>Blessed Stephen, for believing in Jesus Christ of Nazareth, to be the true Christ and only Saviour,</HI> Act. 6. 8,9,14,59. At this he grew <HI>impatient,</HI> rebuking me, saying, Thou didst promise not to interrupt me; I replied, that I did not interrupt, but help him, <HI>sc.</HI> to remember that my promise was, not to interrupt him or any of his party, whilest he or any of them, were answering the Arguments urged by me, (as it may appear in the prefixed <HI>Preface:</HI> But he said, that
<PB N="6" REF="000313_0010_0FA4A9E755A83C38"/>
he did not value the <HI>Arguments,</HI> for they proved nothing, (thus, he that was a party, made himself the determin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting <HI>Judge,</HI>) and then with a throat stretched voice, returned to his former discourse, <HI>That the Word is Christ, the true Light in the Flesh, sent to save men from sin and death, whose death and sufferings with the effect thereof, we do own and witness, ac∣cording to the Scriptures, as inwardly received within us:</HI> yet speaking other whiles of the death, satisfaction and sufferings of Christ, the true Light, as done within us, for us: to which (said he) the Scripture testifies repeating these words, <HI>But the righteousness which is of Faith, speaketh on this wise, say not in thy heart, who shall ascend into Heaven; (that is to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Christ down from above) or who shall descend into the deep, (that is to bring up Christ again from the dead) But what saith it; the word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that is the word of faith which we Preach:</HI> After he had rehearsed these (or most of these) words, he forthwith inferrd, that the word of <HI>Faith,</HI> was <HI>Christ, the true light with∣in,</HI> and then confidently affirmed, <HI>that to preach any other Gospel,</HI> sc. (<HI>then Christ within to be the Saviour</HI>) <HI>is to be accursed;</HI> which invited him to reflect on me, declaring that I had not in any thing, which was by me said (meaning in the <HI>Arguments</HI> above) made any mention of Christ, as God, and with that saying he ended (<HI>as it's call'd,</HI> his present Dispute.</P>
<P>Forthwith I made some returnes, which I have now put into some bet∣ter <HI>method,</HI> which was then much hindred by their confused interruptions But before I lay down those more orderly returnes, let me request the <HI>Reader</HI> to understand, that I have filed off much of the <HI>Rust</HI> and <HI>Rugged∣ness</HI> of his expressions, which often wearied the Christian Hearers: For it was not only his, but also his <HI>Fellow▪ Disputants</HI> course all along, here and there to steal, and strangely to disorder, (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay to <HI>dismember</HI>) Scrip∣ture words, out of the <HI>Evangelists,</HI> and the <HI>Apostles,</HI> thereby endeavour∣ing to cover themselves from being discovered; not plninsy, nor honest∣ly mentioning either <HI>Chapters</HI> or <HI>Verses,</HI> (<HI>William Bullock</HI> once excepted) though often called upon, but all in vain: they would speak Scripture words (after their usual manner) darkly and confusedly, thereby the more easily to deceive those with whom the Scriptures have any credit; I shall (<HI>at present</HI>) decline any further observation of this their dangerous and designful practice; and proceed to the above signifi∣ed <HI>Method:</HI> And</P>
<P N="1">1. As touching the first Chapter of the <HI>Evangelist John</HI> (with which he began as above) It treats of the <HI>God▪head</HI> of the Son alone (the eter∣nal-Word) from the first verse to the end of the fifth verse: and then of the person of Christ (<HI>God-man</HI>) from thence to the end of the Chapter, some of these verses (for satisfaction sake) I shall touch a little in their order.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="000313_0011_0FA4A9E8B4C6E510"/>
First, Of the <HI>Eternal Word,</HI> the <HI>Godhead</HI> of the Son, (as in <HI>ver.</HI> 1,2,3) <HI>In the Beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God; the same was in the beginning with God; all things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.</HI> These verses denote to us, that its only the <HI>Godhead</HI> of▪ the Son, that did <HI>Create.</HI></P>
<P>ver. 14. <HI>The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us,</HI> i.e. <HI>whole Christ,</HI> God man in one person; as such, he created nothing, only as God, so he created all things.</P>
<P>As the <HI>Evangelist</HI> here, so doth <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Colossians</HI> (chap. 1. 16.) speak distinctly of the <HI>God-head</HI> of the Son alone, and also distinctly of him as <HI>personal Christ,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P><HI>By him were all things created, that are in Heaven, and that are in Earth, visible and invisible, whether they be Thrones or Dominions, or Principali∣lities or Powers; all things were created by him, and for him: and he is be∣fore all things, and by him all things consist,</HI> (ver. 17) So he is the <HI>Creator.</HI> Again, <HI>ver.</HI> 18, 19. <HI>Paul</HI> speaks distinctly also of Christ, as Christ: for so (as noted before) he is no <HI>Creator,</HI> because (so considered) he is in part a <HI>Creature:</HI> howbeit, as Christ he is the Head and Saviour, (<HI>Ephes.</HI> 5▪ 23.) of the Body, the Church:</P>
<P><HI>Who is the beginning, and first born from the dead, that in all things he</HI> (Christ God-man) <HI>might have preheminence: for it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell,</HI> (and ver. 20.) <HI>Having made peace through the blood of his cross: and in the body of his flesh through Death, to present you holy and unblameable, and unreprovable in his fight,</HI> (ver. 22.) <HI>If ye con∣tinue in the Faith</HI> (that is in the Faith of the peace made through the blood of his Cross, and body of his flesh through death) <HI>Grounded</HI> and <HI>Rooted,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>This Distribution (both by the <HI>Evangelist</HI> and <HI>Apostle</HI>) was not un∣derstood by this Disputant <HI>Eastlack:</HI> for in all his foregoing Discourse, his design was to make the Hearers believe, that the <HI>Eternal Word,</HI> the <HI>Godhead</HI> of the Son (as distinct from the <HI>Manhood</HI> of Christ) is the true Christ, and only Saviour; and consequently, <HI>a Quakers pretended Savi∣our within him is the true, not the false Christ:</HI> And hereunto agrees his words so frequently repeated by him, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>God was manifest in the flesh,</HI> (that is, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o their darkened understanding) i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all man kind of flesh; which gross <HI>Error</HI> shall be (in its proper place) considered: in the next place, this Disputants more lax and general expressions shall receive some <HI>Answers.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. I do acknowledge with him, that the [<HI>Word</HI>] took flesh of the <HI>Virgin,</HI> and that he suffered without the Gates o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> how∣beit, as it comes from a <HI>Teaching Quaker,</HI> it is undoubtedly no other, then
<PB N="8" REF="000313_0012_0FA4A9E8F7D6D490"/>
a deceitful shifting of the matter in question: yet I am ready to grant, that <HI>F. E.</HI> and his Partners may believe, that there was such a man, who (as Histories mention) took flesh, and was born of the <HI>Virgin Mary,</HI> and suffered death without the Gates of Jerusalem, about sixteen hundred years ago: Alas, how many <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Jews</HI> are there that know and believe all this; yet they do no more believe <HI>Jesus of Nazareth,</HI> to be the true Christ, and only Saviour, then a Teaching, Seducing <HI>Quaker</HI> doth: Nay, such a <HI>Quaker</HI> attributes no more soul saving <HI>Merit</HI> to the holy Bo∣dy of Jesus Christ, then to the body of a <HI>Turk</HI> or a <HI>Jew:</HI> Therefore its not safe to put any other construction upon his acknowledgement a∣bove, then a deceitful shifting the business in hand, that he might thereby the more easily hoodwink the Hearer; for his Discourse had no other tendency, then to make us believe, that the true Christ and Saviour was only in (not at all of) the body of Christs flesh.</P>
<P N="2">2. I do again acknowledge with him, <HI>sc.</HI> That the effects of Christs death and sufferings, are to be inwardly witnessed, as received within us: And if so, then there must be a cause of these effects inwardly received; as previous and anticedent to them, <HI>to wit,</HI> The death and sufferings of the one Man Jesus Christ (as in the third <HI>Argument</HI>) which is therefore necessarily finished, and perfected already by the one crucified body of Jesus of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> upon the Cross (without us) for us; which in right reason must needs be, before the effects thereof could be revealed in us, and so inwardly witnessed; though this were the thing I argued for, yet it was strongly opposed by them all, (as may afterwards appear) making those effects within them, the true Christ, and their only Saviour.</P>
<P>Now I proceed to the Texts of Scripture repeated by <HI>F.E.</HI> which shall be considered in order as he uttered them.</P>
<P>John 1. 9. <HI>That was the true Light, which lighteneth every man that com∣eth into the World:</HI> This Scripture he more especially insisted on, to prove Christ to be that true <HI>Light,</HI> and that <HI>Light</HI> to be the only <HI>Saviour,</HI> which (as he said) is in every man, that cometh into the world: whence he Argued, that a <HI>Quakers</HI> pretended Saviour within him, is the true, and not the false Christ.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Its true that by [<HI>Light</HI>] in that place of Scripture, the true Christ, and our only Saviour, is meant, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ohn</HI> 1. 29. and although i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> likewise true, (in a true sence) that every man that cometh into the world, is enlightened by Christ (<HI>i.e.</HI> with reason) the Son of God, as he is the <HI>Eternal Word</HI> that made the World: yet, the <HI>Evangelist</HI> hath not in that Text assorted, that there is a Light (or enlightening) in every Man, as he cometh into the World, which is the true Christ; and our only Saviour▪ so that, thou hast plainly and openly belied that holy Man <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ohn,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="000313_0013_0FA4A9E9A6FA8BD0"/>
in saying of him as above, <HI>that be so witnessed;</HI> Namely, that the Light, (or inlighting) in every Man, as he comes into the World▪ is the true Christ, and Mans only Saviour: for, this <HI>Evangelist</HI> witnesseth other∣wise, as (in ver. 30. 29.) he evidently affirms the Light (in <HI>ver.</HI>9.) to be the Man Jesus, and as such, he never was (nor can be) in any man▪ so witnesseth the <HI>Witness▪ bearer,</HI> whom we are to believe, before a <HI>Seducing Quaker.</HI></P>
<P N="2"> 2. Thou (<HI>F. E</HI>) didst in thy Discourse effectually affirm Christ to be the <HI>Light,</HI> and the <HI>Light</HI> in every Man to be the Christ, implying thereby, <HI>sc.</HI> what might be truly spoken of the one, might be also so spoken of the other: here hence then it must follow, that the <HI>Light</HI> within a <HI>Quaker,</HI> was born in <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> laid in a <HI>Manger,</HI> hanged upon a <HI>Tree,</HI> and gave up the <HI>Ghost;</HI> all these were truly and properly spoken of the true Christ (<HI>who is the Light of the World:</HI> Now, what can be more absurd and false, then to affirm these things of the <HI>Light,</HI> in every man that cometh into the World by natural Generation.</P>
<P N="3">3. It being an <HI>Enlightning</HI> which is communicated (as in <HI>ver:</HI> 9.) to every man that comes into the World (which comprehends both <HI>Elect,</HI> and <HI>Reprobate</HI>) But the true Christ is not in Reprobates (2 <HI>Cor,</HI> 13. 5.) Therefore the true Christ is not (as in your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ence) in every man that comes into the World, and consequently not in <HI>Teaching, Seducing Qua∣kers.</HI></P>
<P>Text 2<HI>d.</HI> 1 Tim. 3.16. <HI>Great i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the mystery of godliness, God was ma∣nifest in the flesh.</HI> Hence, he (<HI>F.E.</HI>) inferr'd that the <HI>Godhead</HI> only, as manifest in the flesh, is the true Christ and only Saviour; and withal he effectually said, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat the <HI>Light</HI> in every man that comes into the World, (as it is manifest in every man) in the same Christ (<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> the <HI>Godhead</HI>) and as in the body of Christs flesh, so in the body of every mans flesh (<HI>i.e. God manifest in the flesh,</HI> sc. flesh indefinitely) And so by a consequence of his own Blaspheming, <HI>a Quakers pretended Saviour within him, is the true, not the false Christ.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Nothing can be more evident, then that this Disputant would have had the <HI>Hearers</HI> to believe, that the <HI>Godhead</HI> (as distinct from Christs being a man) is the true Christ and only Saviour: Surely this is new Divinity; which is differing and quite another Gospel, then that of the Apostles as in (<HI>Mat.</HI> 16. 16.) Thou (not the <HI>Godhead</HI> alone in thee. But thou (the son of Man, <HI>ver.</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.) art the Son of the living God.</P>
<P>Again, after Christs Ascention and Glorification in Heaven above, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Apostles confess him, in these words, (<HI>Act</HI> 12. 36.) <HI>Let all the house of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> know assuredly, that God hath made that same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> (not the God-head only manifest in Jesus, but) <HI>that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sus, whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>

Lord and Christ:</HI> consider I pray, did the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ews</HI> ever cruci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e your feign∣ed <HI>Godhead-light</HI> within: I could heartily wish, that all ye would feeling∣ly lay to heart, what our blessed Lord saith in this case, (<HI>Luk.</HI> 12. 8,9.) <HI>Whosoever shall confess me</HI> (not the Godhead only in me, but me) <HI>before Men, him shall the Son of Man also confess before the Angels of God: But he that denieth me</HI> (the Son of Man) <HI>shall be denied before the Angels of God:</HI> Thus the Holy <HI>A</HI>postles confessed before men; the Son of man (<HI>Jesus of Nazareth</HI>) to be the true Christ, and their only Saviour, and in the Faith thereof, they both lived and died.</P>
<P><HI>F. E.</HI> Let me ask thee this question: <HI>sc.</HI> If the Godhead of the Son (considered as distinct from his being a Man) be the true Christ and Sa∣viour; how, or to whom was he manifested? its impossible to imagine, that the Godhead (which is invisible and incomprehensible) can be mani∣fested to the external senses of men; But the true Christ, and our only Saviour, was thus Manifested; as it is witnessed by Christs faithful <HI>A</HI>∣postles (<HI>sc.</HI> in 1 <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oh. chap.</HI> 1. <HI>ver.</HI> 1,2,3.) there, speaking of the Lord Je∣sus Christ, personally God man, they declare; <HI>That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled of the word of life.</HI></P>
<P>Note here, that the blessed <HI>A</HI>postles testifie, that they had heard and seen Jesus Christ (the true and only Saviour) looking upon him, and handled him, by being in his Company: But as for your Idol (<HI>light Christ</HI>) it was never visible, but ever invisible; for ye say, it is within only, so that (ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l it what ye will) you, nor any man else, can say what it is, except a <HI>Whimsey.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, let it be considered, how these words (<HI>God was manifested in the flesh</HI>) are explained by the Lord Christ himself, (<HI>Joh.</HI> 2. 11.) <HI>This beginning of Miracles did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory</HI> (that is, his Godhead to Faith) By this Miracle (of turning wa∣ter into wine) the glory of the Godhead was manifested in the body of his Flesh: that is to say, the Lord Christ did by that (and other <HI>Mira∣cles</HI> which he wrought in the sight of the Beholders) make it manifest, that he was true God, and true man in one person: (which is so great a Mystery, that neither Saints nor Angels are able to comprehend it) this is indeed the genuine sense of that Scripture, (sc. <HI>Great is the Mystery. God was manifest in the flesh</HI>] And to force it to speak otherwise, is a most wretched and sinful wresting of the Text; but the <HI>Disputant</HI> being as bold as blind, added as aforesaid; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>That to Preach any other Gospel, is to be accursed;</HI> meaning to preach otherwise, then that the Godhead only in the flesh, (all mankind flesh) to be the true Christ, and only Sa∣viour is to be accursed; these words were (being his third Text of

<HI>Scripture</HI>) repeated by him; shall now be considered, whether wrested or no.</P>
<P><HI>Text</HI> 3<HI>d. Gal.</HI> 1. 8,9. <HI>If any Man Preach any other Gospel unto you, then that which we have Preached unto you, and ye have received, let him be accursed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> I pray thee <HI>Frances,</HI> what was the Name of that Apostle, who preached the Godhead (as distinct from Christs Manhood) to be the true Christ, and only Saviour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, thou poor, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illy man, was there ever (or will there ever be) remission of sins Preached by the Spirit; but by and through the one Man Jesus Christ; the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> Heb. 10. 29. saith (in effect) to Preach otherwise, <HI>is to despite the Spirit of Grace,</HI> even the Doctrine of the Spirit, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5. 15. <HI>Much more the Grace of God, and the gift by Grace, which is by one Man Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto ma∣ny:</HI> I shall let this pass a little, and proceed to a consideration of the <HI>Text</HI> it self.</P>
<P>And for our so doing this <HI>Question</HI> doth necessarily ari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>:</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>What was the Gospel that Paul Preached?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> He Preached the <HI>Faith</HI> (<HI>i.e.</HI> the Gospel of Faith) <HI>which once he destroyed and persecuted,</HI> Gal. 1. 23. Now, the Faith which <HI>Paul</HI> once persecuted was, the Faith of believing in <HI>Jesus</HI> of <HI>Nazareth</HI> the man ap∣proved of God among the people, <HI>Act.</HI> 2. 22. to be the true Christ and our only Saviour; then by good consequence the Gospel which the Apo∣stle Preached, was to believe in the Name Jesus Christ of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> to be the true Christ, &amp; our only Saviour (and Justifier in the sight of God, without the works of Law in or by us.)</P>
<P>To clear this <HI>Answer</HI> yet a little further, let <HI>Pauls</HI> own Confession be observed, <HI>Act.</HI> 22. 4. <HI>And I Persecuted this way</HI> (namely, of believing in Jesus of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> to be the true Christ and only Saviour) <HI>unto the Death, binding annd delivering into the Prisons both Men and Women,</HI> ver. 7. <HI>And I heard a voice, saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</HI> <Q>ver. 8. And I answered, who art thou Lord? and he said unto me, I am Jesus of <HI>Nazareth</HI> (not the Godhead only in Jesus of <HI>Nazareth</HI>) <HI>whom then Persecutest:</HI> Furthermore, at <HI>ver.</HI> 14. And he (<HI>Ananias</HI>) said the God of our Fathers hath chosen thee (<HI>Paul</HI>) that thou should∣est know his will, and see that just one, and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth <HI>ver.</HI> 15. For thou shalt be a witness unto all men, of what thou hast seen and heard.</Q></P>
<P><HI>A</HI>nd accordingly the <HI>Apostle</HI> did bear open and abundant witness to that just one, (even <HI>Jesus of Nazareth</HI> to be the true Christ and our only Saviour) This great <HI>Truth</HI> is yet further evident, in the 13<HI>th. Chapter of the Acts, ver.</HI> 23. <Q>Of this Mans (<HI>Davids</HI>) Send, hath God accord∣ing
<PB N="12" REF="000313_0016_0FA4A9EC57FEAB70"/>
to his promise raised unto <HI>Israel,</HI> a Saviour Jesus; him (ver. 27. They (<HI>sc.</HI> The Rulers in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erusalem</HI>) condemned, <HI>ver.</HI> 28 and flew, and took him down from the tree, and <HI>ver.</HI> 29, laid him in a Sepulchre: But <HI>ver.</HI> 30.

<P>Against the blessed Doctrine of the Gospel, the unbelieving <HI>Jews</HI> were (as ye Teaching <HI>Quakers</HI> are) <HI>filled with envy, and spake against those things, which were spoken by</HI> Paul▪ <HI>contradicting and Blaspheming,</HI> ver. 45: hereupon, ver. 46. Paul <HI>and</HI> Barnabas <HI>waned hold,</HI> and said, <HI>Seeing ye put</HI> [<HI>It</HI>] (<HI>sc.</HI> Faith in the Man Jesus Christ of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> slain and raised from the dead) <HI>from you, and judge</HI> (O, Seducing <HI>Quakers</HI> read and tremble) <HI>your selves unworthy of everlasting life.</HI></P>
<P>Here hence, it is most plain, that the <HI>Apostles</HI> Preached Faith in Jesus of <HI>Nazareth</HI> a Man (not the <HI>Godhead</HI> only in the Man) approved of God among the People, to be the true Christ and our only Saviour; But never did they (not any of the Apostles of God) Preach Faith only in the Godhead (distinct from Christs Manhood) to be the true Christ, and only Saviour; against this <HI>New coi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea</HI> Doctrine, not only the <HI>Apostles,</HI> but the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> himself bears express witness, as in <HI>Act.</HI> 5. 30,31,32. <HI>The God of our Fathers raisea up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged upon a tree, him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance and forgiveness of Sine, and we</HI> (the Apostles) <HI>are his wit∣nesses of these things, and so is also the Holy Ghost.</HI></P>
<P>The whole is, If any Man Preach any other Gospel, then what the <HI>Apostle</HI> Preached, he is accursed; But ye (Teaching and Seducing <HI>Qua∣kers</HI>) do plainly Preach another Gospel; therefore ye that Preach it, and they that receive it, are accursed, by the Testimony of Gods own Spirit, <HI>Gal.</HI> 1. 8, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. And consequently thou <HI>F. E.</HI> hast wrested that (as other) Text of Scripture, which (without Repentance) will be to thy destruction, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3. 16.</P>

<P N="3">3. For the right understanding of the above repeated 6,7,8, <HI>verses</HI> we must (first of all) take in the 5<HI>th. verse,</HI> for <HI>Moses</HI> describeth the righte∣ousness which is of the Law, <HI>that the man that doth these things, shall live by them,</HI> Lev. 16. 5. so that, in these Verses, the <HI>Apostle Paul</HI> compare the righteousness of the Law and the righteousness of Faith together: and thereby shews that the righteousness of the Law is not only uncer∣tain, but also <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 3 impossible; but the righteousness of Faith, is both certain and possible: For 1.

<P><HI>A</HI>nd as the righteousness of Faith, is a remedy against Doubts of Sal∣vation: So, is it also against fears of Condemnation: For, if Christ have dyed, and be raised from [<HI>the deep</HI>] the Grave, then hath he thereby gotten the Victory over Sin, Death Hell, and Satan: therefore to fear condemnation, what is it else, but to deny Christ death, or descertion into the <HI>Deep;</HI> and so, to bring him back again to the <HI>Cross</HI> and <HI>Grave.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, the <HI>Apostle Paul</HI> in these verses gives us a plain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of what <HI>Moses</HI> had elegantly propounded by a figure, in <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut.</HI> 30. 11,12,13,14. from whence we are taught, that both <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> presupposed a two old pressure upon the Spirits of sinners, as 1. How they may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> into Heaven: And 2. How they may avoid Hell, these two <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of God) do stew, to be taken away by the righteousness of Faith; the find is removed, because we believe the <HI>Acce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion</HI> of Christ into Heaven or us: and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> also because we believe Christs <HI>Resurrection</HI> from the dead for us; whereby the Lord Christ
<PB N="14" REF="000313_0018_0FA4A9ED66CC2100"/>
demonstrated his victory over hell, death, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in our room and names. It may hence be safely argued, that both <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> do conclude, that if any man seeks justification by the righteousness of the Law, (as most <HI>Quakers</HI> do) he must needs be in continual fear of Hell, and despair of Heaven: But be that (through <HI>Free grace</HI>) believeth that the Lord Christ is risen from the dead, ascended up into heaven for him, in his place and stead, is freed from both.</P>
<P>The sum of all, is this: Namely, That Jesus Christ rose from the dead, for us, and ascended up into heaven for us: and before either. (which must be implied) lived and died for us: But, he that believes not the <HI>Descention,</HI> and the <HI>Ascention</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ for him, but seek∣eth <HI>Justification</HI> by the works of the Law; he doth (in effect) deny the <HI>Resurrection,</HI> and <HI>Ascention</HI> of Jesus Christ; which to do, were (as much as in him lies) to bring Christ down from above, and likewise to bring him up again from the deep.

<P>Qu. 1 <HI>What is means by Righteousness of Faith?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sol.</HI> 1. <HI>By Righteousness,</HI> is meant, that righteousness which obtains acceptance, justification and salvation with God, which is the righteous∣ness alone of the Lord Jesus of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> which he wrought out in his own personal Obedience and Sufferings (1600 years since) upon the Cross. 2. <HI>By the Righteousness of Faith,</HI> is meant a right believing in the alone righteousness of this Jesus of <HI>Nazareth</HI> for acceptance, justi∣fication, and salvation with God.</P>
<P>Qu. 2. What, <HI>by the word Faith?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sol.</HI> We are to understand, an Evangelical (not legal) word: for, it is a word of Faith, the same with the righteousness of Faith above defined,

and which agrees with the <HI>Apostles</HI> Explication, <HI>ver.</HI> 8. That is (saith he) the Word of Faith which we Preach; now the <HI>Apostles</HI> Preached no other word of Faith, then the righteousness of Faith afore expressed, (and confirmed by the four <HI>Arguments</HI>) besides, there are other Scrip∣tures of infallible truth, evidencing the same: as <HI>Rom.</HI> 1. <HI>ver.</HI> 1. <HI>Separate unto the Gospel of Christ,</HI> ver. 3. <HI>Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord,</HI> ver. 4. <HI>Declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:</HI> Likewise in Chap 4. 25. <HI>Who was delivered,</HI> (i.e. to death) <HI>for our offences, and was raised up again for our Justification:</HI> And in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15. 1. <HI>I declare unto you, the Gospel which I Preached unto you:</HI> What was that Gospel, the Apostle tells us? <HI>ver.</HI> 3. <HI>how that Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures.</HI> ver. 4. <HI>And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the Scri∣ptures,</HI> the last mentioned Scriptures do illustrate the righteousness o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Faith, and word of Faith preached (in the abovesaid verses 6. 8.) and therefore cannot possibly be understood for a <HI>Quakers</HI> pretended Saviour within him (as this <HI>Disputant F. E.</HI> would make us believe.)</P>
<P>Qu. 3. <HI>How is this Preached Word</HI> (or righteousness) <HI>of Faith, said to be nigh, even in the mouth, and in the heart.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sol.</HI> Its resolved by the <HI>Apostle</HI> in ver. 9,10. <HI>That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe is thine heart, that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.</HI> That is to say; the Word of Faith preached, is nigh in our mouths: when we confess before men, <HI>sc.</HI> That we believe that that righteousness, whereby we are accepted of God, justified and saved, is the only righteousness of Jesus Christ of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> which he wrought out in his personal Obedience, and suffer∣ings upon the Cross (without us) for us: And it is nigh in our hearts, when this confession proceeds from a right perswasion ingra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted an plant∣ed in our hearts by the spirit of Faith, as its testified by <HI>Paul,</HI> ver. 10. <HI>For</HI> (saith he) <HI>with the heart man believeth unto righteousness,</HI> (<HI>i.e.</HI> unto the righteousness of Faith in Jesus Christ of <HI>Nazareth</HI>) ver 6. <HI>And with the mouth Confession</HI> (<HI>sc.</HI> of the fame righteousness) <HI>is made unto Salva∣tion.</HI> Thus according to the command of Jesus Christ of <HI>Nazareth, John</HI> 5. 39.

<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1.

<P>But the light which is by natural Generation in Reprobates, is not the true Christ, as above, <HI>Ergo,</HI> the light that is in every man, which comes, into the world, (is not according to your selves) the true Christ.</P>
<P N="2">2. I Answered, That this Text of Scripture understand, not the person of Christ (as such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is the true Christ, and our only Saviour) but the work of the Spirit of Faith, whereof personal Christ is the Author: for here the Apostle frames an Argument, to prove the mighty work (or ef∣fect) of the Spirit in his <HI>Corinthians,</HI> as he had before affirmed to be in them, <HI>ver.</HI> 3. <HI>Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you∣ward <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not weak</HI> (i e. in operation) <HI>but is</HI> [Mighty] <HI>in you.</HI></P>
<P>Now, in what sense Christ was in <HI>Paul</HI> speaking, in that same sense was Christ in the <HI>Corinthians:</HI> But Christ spake in <HI>Paul</HI> only by the might (or power) of his Spirit, is mighty in you, <HI>sc.</HI> Christs speaking in <HI>Paul to the Corinthians,</HI> was [Mighty] (an effect of the Spirit) in them This mat∣ter may appear somewhat clearer, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we consider the same Apostle to the <HI>Galatians,</HI> Gal. 2.8. <HI>For he</HI> (the Holy Ghost) <HI>that wrought effectually

<P>Qu. <HI>How is that Jesus Christ in you?</HI></P>

<P>To explain these Words (Christ in you) a little more; we must take good notice, that there are three things expressed by the Name of Jesus Christ.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Christ personal:</HI> Col. 2. 8,9. <HI>Not after Christ, for in him dwel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily</HI> (or personally: 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2. 10. <HI>In the per∣son of Christ:</HI> and Mat. 27.24. <HI>I am innocent of the blood of this just Per∣son.</HI> so the Man Jesus Christ, who spake by the inspiration of God, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.16.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Christs, Mystical,</HI> 1 Cor. 12. 12. <HI>So also is Christ</HI> (<HI>i.e.</HI> the Church) <HI>ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'d the body of Christ</HI> ver. 27. which body of Christ, is the Church, <HI>Col.</HI> 1. 24. <HI>Which is Christ Mystical</HI> as above.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Christ Operation,</HI> Col. 2. 12 compared with <HI>Eph:</HI> 3. 17. <HI>Through the Faith of the operation of God: That</HI> Christ <HI>may dwell in your hearts by Faith:</HI> Forasmuch as Faith is the operation of God (in Christ) its therefore called Christ operative, in which sense only, Christ is said to be (in u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.) <HI>As</HI> the Sun is in the eye by its beams; so, Jesus Christ (as the author, or first efficient) is in us by the operated Graces of his Spirit; hence it necessarily follows, that Christ personal (the only Saviour) is

not in us; nor Christ mystical (the Church) is in us: this is so plain, that there is no need of evidence, for, as Christ personal is the <HI>Head sa∣ving,</HI> so Christ Mystical is the <HI>Body saved,</HI> Eph. 5. 23. therefore neither the one, nor the other can be said to be in us: Then,</P>

The <HI>Apostle</HI> doth not (in this place) say: They that crucifie the Son of God [In] themselves, but [To] themselves: that is to say, They who have been inlightned by the Holy Ghost, if such fall away, they crucifie the efficacy of his death to themselves: and in so do∣ing, it is impossible to renew them again to repentance, because re∣jecting the Son of God (<HI>Jesus of Nazareth</HI>) who is the only propitia∣tory Sacrifice for the remission of sins; there remaineth to them, <HI>no more Sacrifice for sin,</HI> and so no remission: now, (O ye <HI>Teaching Quakers</HI> especially) are not ye of that fort of notorious sinners, meant in that Text (<HI>Heb.</HI> 6.6,7. which is by you often used in defence of your cause: let me pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly a little with you, have not you heretofore made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me profession or Jesus Christ of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> to have been the true Christ, and your only Saviour? and are ye not now <HI>Apostatised,</HI> and fallen away from this your profession of Faith? if so, ye then are in the number of those sinners, that commit the great sin, called as above, <HI>a crucifying of the Son of God afresh, and a putting him to open shame:</HI> that is to say, ye (as much as in you li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th) do it now, that Christ the Son of God is in Heaven glorified, and were the Lord Jesus Christ of <HI>Nazareth</HI> here upon Earth again, ye most certain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y would do your utmost to <HI>Crucifie him again:</HI> for, that ma∣litious Spirit possesseth such wretched Sinners (as ye <HI>Quakers</HI> cannot truly deny your selves to be) which possessed those <HI>Jews</HI> who were the very <HI>Betrayers</HI> and <HI>Murtherers</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ: Oh, its most manifest, that ye are of that sort of sinners, who by their sinning are said, to have <HI>trodden under foot the Son of God, and have counted the blood of the Covenant, wherewith ye were sanctified</HI> (i.e. externally, or as to the opi∣nion once of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n) an <HI>unholy</HI> (common or vile) <HI>thing,</HI> Heb 10. 29.</P>
<P>That I may clear this great thing yet a little more: let me crave leave to ask (of you <HI>Quakers</HI>) one serious <HI>Question:</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> have not ye hereto∣fore professed (as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n <HI>Act.</HI> 20 21.) <HI>repentance towards God, and Faith to∣wards our Lord Jesus Christ:</HI> though this cannot be gainsaid with any truth: yet how apparent is it, that ye are wilfully gone back from this
<PB N="21" REF="000313_0025_0FA4A9F376651450"/>
<HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Repentance?</HI> Consider now I pray you, your declared <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Heb.</HI> 10. 26. <HI>For, if we sin wilfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sin:</HI> That is, for wilful sinners against received light of knowledge, casting off the Sacrifice of that one crucified Christ upon the Cross, with which they once seemed to close; God will never provide them another Sacrifice for sin; undoubtedly, ye are (at present of those <HI>Apostates,</HI> which do not only refuse to choose that Grace of the Gospel (which abounds to many by the one Man Jesus Christ <HI>Rom</HI> 5. 15, but ye refuse it after a seeming choice of it; and are therefore said (in the close of the 29<HI>th.</HI> verse, above) <HI>to have done de∣spight to the spirit of Grace:</HI> why, the same verse tells us, because <HI>the Son of God is trodden under foot,</HI> the same <HI>Apostle</HI> further tells us, why, <HI>Heb.</HI> 6. <HI>ver.</HI> 6. as aforesaid, <HI>they crucified to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame,</HI> i.e. by being ashamed of the true Christ, and turning away from him, (as ye are and do) This, Oh this, is to put the blessed Son of God to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> open shame: and even this is <HI>to do despig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to the spirit of Grace:</HI> and shall they who despite the spirit of Grace, ever find the benefit of Gospel Grace?</P>
<P>The sum of all is this, That the Scriptures of Truth, do plainly charge the generality of <HI>Quakers,</HI> with the guilt of the sin against the holy Ghost: because they have sinned wilfully after a profession openly made of Faith in the Lord Christ (born of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> in the City of <HI>Da∣v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> Luk 2. 11. to be the true Christ, and their only Saviour: and there∣fore as <HI>Apostates of old,</HI> so do ye now crucifie (not in, but) to your selves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame: Oh, that the Lord (I do heartily wish it) would bring these repeated plain deal∣ings effectually home to your hearts; <HI>remembring from whence ye are fallen, and repent, and do the first works,</HI> Rev 25. 9.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> As it is above noted: In what sense this <HI>Disputant</HI> F. E. inten∣ded the fore-asserted Notions (<HI>sc.</HI> that the Word took flesh, and in that flesh dyed for all men) I could not certainly determine, nor could (as I am perswaded) he himself: as it may appear, by the <HI>Answer</HI> he then made to a <HI>Question,</HI> which I put unto him: To wit,</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> Whether he (<HI>F. E.</HI>) did believe, that Jesus Christ of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> the Man approved of God among the People: and whom the <HI>Jews,</HI> flew, and God raised from the dead, and also received up into Heaven, were the true Christ, and his only Saviour?</P>
<P>He forthwith <HI>Answered; That he did believe it:</HI> Capt. <HI>Bascomb</HI> then called to him saying <HI>Thou wilt deny it again tomorrow:</HI> and withal I like∣wise told him, that by this his open confession of the true Faith, he had openly declared himself to be a <HI>Christian,</HI> and no <HI>Quaker:</HI> and I further∣more
<PB N="22" REF="000313_0026_0FA4A9F423621718"/>
said to him, that he had (by that Gospel confession of Faith) ma∣nifestly contradicted what he had contended for in his present Discourse (called Disputation) and that he had also thereby confirmed the first part of the charge against them, namely, That <HI>a Quakers pretended Sa∣viour within him, was not the true Christ, but the false Christ.</HI></P>
<P>And at the same time <HI>Nathaniel Bethel</HI> spake to him; saying, <HI>Francis,</HI> you were (not long since) of another Faith, or of another Opinion; for you told my Wife, <HI>That if she did believe in any other Christ, then in that Christ which was within her, she would be damned;</HI> But <HI>Francis</HI> (Jesuite▪ like) openly denied, that he had spoken any such Words to his Wife; thereupon <HI>Nathaniel Bethel</HI> replied to him (in the face of the Congrega∣tion) <HI>that he would depose, what he had declared to be a truth.</HI></P>
<P>Since that time, I have been informed of the occasion, which invited these words from the <HI>sad Quaker:</HI> it was thus, discoursing of the old <HI>Brigham</HI> (a man of the <HI>fifth-Monarchy</HI> perswasion) who said, <HI>he hoped to live to see Jesus Christ on the Earth, and to shake <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> hand;</HI> th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n <HI>F.

Brigham</HI>) should be first sure that Jesus Christ had a hand: <HI>Bethels Wife</HI> then told him, that Christ had now a hand: for I do (said the) Believe that Christ hath now the same body in Heaven, which he had when he was upon the Earth: at this expression of her Faith, this <HI>frank Quaker</HI> was offended, and could not forbear, but in plain terms, old her, <HI>that she was a Blaspheme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> (or, <HI>had spoken Blasphemy</HI>) and withal he further said unto her as above, <HI>To wit, That if she believed in any other Christ, then in that Christ which was within her, she would be damned:</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Quakerisme,</HI> dig'd out of the <HI>bottomless Pit,</HI> from whence thou hast received thy <HI>Ordination</HI> to be a Teaching, Seducing, and Lying <HI>Quaker:</HI> For <HI>Francis,</HI> thou knowest both this Man and his Wife, to be persons of good Name, credit, and of honest reputation in this Country, and therefore worthy to be believed, before thy self: Oh that the Lord would give thee grace to repent of thy evident wickedness, and grievous God provoking Blasphemy, (proceeding from the <HI>false Christ</HI> within <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he:) which undoubtedly thou hast wretchedly aggravated, by making (as much as in thee lay) this faithful witness, an open lyar: and that (as most of the <HI>Christian Hearers</HI> judged) contrary to the Testimony of the tender part (thy <HI>Light Christ Conscience</HI>) within: Oh, that I could prevailingly advise thee, to think how deservedly the deadful words of the holy <HI>Apostle,</HI> Act. 13. 45, may be charged on thee, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>They</HI> (the <HI>Jews</HI>) <HI>were filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming:</HI> For,</P>

2. The matter of her words, was the same with the thing spoken by <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> not only in <HI>ver.</HI> 37, 38. but also in <HI>chap.</HI> 3. 13. 21. <HI>The God of our Fathers hath glorified his Son Jesus, whom the Heaven must receive, until the times of restitution of all things;</HI> so that thou wert not only filled with envy, but with blasphemous contradictions; now <HI>Francis,</HI> this being thy case truly stated, hast thou not indeed cause to repent over thy <HI>false-Christ</HI> that hath (as above) filled thy heart with envy, and thy tongue with Blasphemy, against the the truth of God believed and confessed by that good Woman above. By the way, I may not omit (Capt <HI>Bascombes</HI> motion made unto me (upon the confession of <HI>F. E.</HI> his Faith above <HI>&amp;c. That Jesus of Nazareth was received up into Heaven:</HI> to ask him <HI>where Heaven was;</HI> (it seems the Captain knew, that the <HI>Teaching Quakers</HI> had Jesuitical equivocations, and mental reserves) accordingly I asks him, <HI>where Heaven was;</HI> but he made me no Answer thereupon, his ten∣der headed▪ iniquity Brother, <HI>William Harriot</HI> said, Heaven was where it should be: I demanded of him where that was? he replied (like him∣self) Heaven was there where God would have it to be: by these imper∣tinent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illy shifts, the <HI>intelligent Hearers</HI> perceived, that they were basely afraid to stand to their <HI>Quakerisme Principles:</HI> its well known, that at other times they have confidently avouched (as their <HI>Scripture-wresting-Gui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> teach) that <HI>Heaven</HI> (as well as <HI>Hell</HI>) is within them; for which that <HI>Text</HI> especially is pretended, <HI>Luk.</HI> 17. 21. <HI>For behold the Kingdome of God is within you</HI> (<HI>sc.</HI> the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> ver. 20) whereas by Kingdome of God in that place, our Saviour understands the Gospel of God Preached as <HI>Mark</HI> 1. 14. <HI>Jesus came into Galilee▪ Preaching the Gospel of the King∣dome of God:</HI> and in Luk. 10. 11. <HI>Be ye sure of this, that the Kingdome of God is come nigh unto you:</HI> likewise Mat.21.43. <HI>Therefore said Jesus unto the Pharisees, the Kingdome of God shall be taken from you, and given to a Nation bringing for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th the fruits thereof:</HI> and ver. 45. <HI>When the chief Priests and Pharisees had heard his Parables▪ they perceived that he spake of them:</HI> These Scriptures do plainly shew, that by kingdome of God, in <HI>Luke</HI> 17. 21. Christ doth not mean, the Kingdome of glory in Heaven, but the Kingdome of the Gospel Preached by himself, and his <HI>Apostles</HI> on Earth; to which he answered nothing.</P>
<P>In the next place, <HI>F.

Witnesses, that proved all which was said by me in those four <HI>Argu∣ments;</HI> and that I might prevent (which I foresaw) such carpings, I barely repeated the <HI>Apostles</HI> express words, mentioning (in a manner) no more, then what is plainly asserted by them? what dost thou then, but (under colour of reflecting on me) reflect upon the holy <HI>Apostles</HI> them∣selves? Alas, <HI>poor Man!</HI> had it not been more honesty in thee, to have thus charged the <HI>Apostles,</HI> then me; who wrested not, but only repeated the <HI>Apostles</HI> words, for the confirmation of the alledged Arguments; thou shouldest have clamoured against the <HI>Apostles,</HI> thus, there is not a word by them mentioned of Christ, <HI>as God,</HI> to be the Saviour; and wouldest thou not (hadst thou thus done) have been as bold, as blind <HI>Bayard:</HI> Its most evident, that the <HI>Apostles</HI> preached Christ, <HI>as Man</HI> [Not but that he was and is also God] to be believed in for the remission of sins, both to the <HI>Jews,</HI> and to the <HI>Gentiles:</HI> so that, thy quarrelsome reflecti∣on on me, is (in effect) a manifest denying the Testimony of the <HI>Apo∣stles,</HI> joyntly testifying of the Man Jesus Christ of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> to be the only <HI>Lamb of God, that takes away the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the World,</HI> (reconciled-world, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 19.) for, there is no other Man, Name, or Thing ever in Scripture, called <HI>the Lamb of God,</HI> which takes away sin; but the one Man Jesus Christ, and so it is Recorded by Christs witness bearer, <HI>Joh.</HI> 1. 29, 30.</P>
<P>One would now think, that the very mentioning of these things, were enough to refute them, with whom the <HI>Scriptures</HI> of God, have any cre∣dit: But what shall I say unto thee <HI>Francis;</HI> I would (in true love only to thy distressed Soul) advise thee to search (as in <HI>John</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 39.) the Scriptures: for I find thee very ignorant of the truth, as testified in them; and hence asserting new notions, which thou hast received from other men, which tend to the darkening and denying of the unanimous Testi∣mony of all the holy Men of old, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the true Saviour Jesus of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> and to Salvation through Faith in him; and that thou mayest be deliver∣ed from the dangerous snare of the <HI>false Christ</HI> (the <HI>Idol-light<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> within</HI>) is the hearty desire of him, whom (for his Faith in, and to the truth) thou hast opposed.</P>
<P><HI>William Bullock</HI> was the next Disputant: to prove, <HI>That a Quakers pretended Saviour within him, is not the false but the true Christ.</HI></P>
<P>And thus he <HI>Argued:</HI> saying, That which may be known of God, is manifest in them, and then stopt: Therefore, I prayed him, to tell us, where those words repeated above were to be found? he readily told me, <HI>sc.</HI> in Rom. chap. 1. ver. 19. <HI>Because that which may be known of God, is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them:</HI> this was the only Proof named by them: I further demanded of him, what he inferred
<PB N="25" REF="000313_0029_0FA4A9F7E78779F0"/>
from this <HI>Text</HI> of Scripture? but because he lookt as if he understood not, what was meant by that demand: I requested him to frame some Argument from the Text alledged by him, to prove the matter in hand; but all in vain (<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> being as great a</HI> Monster to him, <HI>as</HI> Jesus Christ of <HI>Nazareth</HI>) Thereupon, I did declare, That the Apostle did not there understand the word [<HI>God</HI>] to signifie Christ, God Man: and as for the phrase [<HI>in them</HI>] it is interpreted [<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them</HI>] as in the very next words in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame verse, <HI>sc. For God hath shewed it to them:</HI> likewise <HI>Paul</HI> doth tell us, both how and where God shew'd them, this, as in <HI>ver.</HI> 20 <HI>For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world, are clear∣ly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and godhead:</HI> which Godhead alone, is not to be understood for God-man, <HI>Christ</HI> the only Saviour: in a word, The mind of the Spirit, in these two 19, 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. verses, <HI>sc.</HI> is no more but this: namely, that the eternal power and Godhead was manifested in (<HI>i.e.</HI> shewn to) the Gentiles (unconverted) by the things that are made (or created) from the cre∣ation of the World: this being the true state of the Text above, how they could prove the thing, <HI>to wit, That a Quakers pretended Saviour within him, is the true, not the false Christ</HI> for which they were brought: surely, none but young and old <HI>Bullocks</HI> (or such as are of that kind) can understand; I expected some reply from this Disputant to the sub∣stance above asserted; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of a reply, he urged another Proof (this was their manner even all along, that thereby they might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their weakness and insufficiencies for returns) saying, <HI>The flesh profi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth nothing, it is the Spirit that quickeneth.</HI></P>
<P>Upon his inversion of the order of the words; I desired him, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me the Chapter, and verse, where the words (as he had spoken them) might be found, but he did it not: I then named both, <ABBR><HI>viz</HI></ABBR> Joh. <HI>chap.</HI> 6. <HI>ver.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3. <HI>It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing.</HI> He again refu∣sing to frame an Argument: Therefore to the Text.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Answered</HI> 1. If these words were to be understood in this sence (<HI>sc.</HI>) That the Lord Christ (on the account of his body of flesh) profiteth no∣thing to Salvation, but its the quickning spirit within, that is the only Sa∣viour) Then, what interpretation wouldst thou put upon Christs words, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame Chapter, <HI>ver.</HI> 53. foregoing, <HI>Then Jesus said unto them, verily verily, I say unto you, except ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his blood, ye have no life</HI> (i.e. Spirit, <HI>ver.</HI> 63. <HI>ult.</HI>) <HI>in you;</HI> or wilt thou make Christ (who is the wisdome of God, 1 (<HI>Cor.</HI> 1. 30.) guilty of contradicti∣on, and so a Lyar, to which he replied nothing, <HI>save that he had spoken Scripture;</HI> which necessarily engaged me to reconcile those Scriptures to the understanding of the hearers; which, I endeavoured thus▪</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="000313_0030_0FA4A9F8AAF71D70"/>
Joh. 6. 63. <HI>It is the spirit that quickeneth</HI> (i.e. the soul of man, natural∣ly dead in sins, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2. 1, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.) the words exclude all endowments, qualifi∣cations, or excellencies in the natural man, from this soul quickening work; hereunto agrees the words of our Saviour, in the end of the 63<HI>d.</HI> verse above: <HI>The words that I spake <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto you, they are spirit, and they are life:</HI> that is to say, the spirit of faith, is the souls life, or special quicken∣ing: so that the latter part of the verse, is both a verification and expli∣cation of the former part (<HI>sc. It is the spirit that quickeneth</HI>) This is likewise confirmed by the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> Gal. 3. 11. and long before, by the Prophet <HI>Habakkuk,</HI> Chap. 2. 4. <HI>the just shall live by faith;</HI> Faith is the vital principal, and fountain of life in the Soul: it is the uniting grace, it knits us to personal Christ glorified in Heaven above, from whose fulness, <HI>Joh.</HI> 1. 16. <HI>we receive grace for grace</HI> (i.e. Grace for graces sake) And therefore his flesh profiteth right Believers; the whole (as to this parti∣cular) is, though the spirit be a dead-souls <HI>quickener,</HI> yet it is not the quickened souls <HI>Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>But this <HI>Disputant</HI> still avers, that the Scripture saith, <HI>Christs flesh pro∣fiteth nothing:</HI> Therefore for further satisfaction, touching these words; <HI>sc.</HI> Christs flesh profiteth nothing, let this Question be propounded:</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>In what sense may Christs flesh be said not to profit, or profiteth no∣thing?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sol.</HI> 1. Christs flesh profiteth an unbeliever nothing: as it is noted by our Saviour, in the very next verse, <HI>ver.</HI> 64. <HI>But there are</HI> (saith he) <HI>some of you that believed not,</HI> intending such of them, as did not by Faith (the believing souls-mouth) <HI>eat his flesh, and drink his blood:</HI> which, in <HI>ver.</HI> 55. Christ saith, <HI>is me at indeed, and drink indeed:</HI> also in Heb. 4. 2. <HI>For unto us was the Gospel Preached, as well as unto the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, but the Word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with Faith, in them that heard it:</HI> what the Gospel preached was; hath been before frequently declared, more especially from <HI>Act.</HI> 5. 30, 31. <HI>That the same Jesus whom the Jews slew, and hanged on a Tree</HI> (this was the body of Christs flesh) <HI>God raised up from the dead, and exalted to be a Prince, and a Saviour, to give repentance, and remission of sins.</HI> This was the Gospel word, that was preached, which profited not either <HI>Jews</HI> or <HI>Gentiles,</HI> that did not by the mouth of Faith, eat the flesh▪ and drink the blood of Jesus Christ, the only Saviour: Hence, I did infer; That the <HI>Quakers</HI> being such non eating, non drink∣ing Unbelievers, Christs flesh profiteth them nothing (therefore fit to be insisted on by this <HI>Disputant.</HI>)</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Christs flesh profiteth nothing;</HI> If it be taken in that sense, in which the <HI>Jews</HI> apprehended the eating of it; and that was, with their natural mouths, as it appears from <HI>ver.</HI> 52. <HI>They</HI> (the Jews) <HI>strove amongst
<PB N="27" REF="000313_0031_0FA4A9FA0DC2DB90"/>
themselves,</HI> saying, <HI>how can this man give us his flesh to eat?</HI> (for they knew of no eating, but as they did eat their bodily food) yea, Christs Disci∣ples (such as for the present followed him) said, <HI>ver.</HI> 63. <HI>this is a hard saying, who can hear it:</HI> Hereupon Christ doth explain himself to them all, in these words [<HI>The flesh profiteth nothing,</HI> ver. 63. above] thereby gi∣ving them to understand, that he meant not of eating his flesh with their natural mouthes, as they did eat their daily bread, for (as if Christ had said) should ye so eat some of my natural flesh, or so drink some of my blood, <HI>it would profit you nothing:</HI> the reason of it, is assigned by the A∣postle <HI>Paul,</HI> because Christs flesh and blood, is <HI>New-Testament Blood,</HI> 1 Cor. 11. 25. in which all the promises of God are, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1. 20 here hence, it is safely inferr'd, That the true <HI>Object</HI> of Faith, is, the New-Te∣stament promises in Christ bodily; in which respect, Christs flesh is pro∣fitable to all right Believers on him, for their Justification, Resurrection, and Glorification, as in <HI>ver.</HI> 54, <HI>Whose eateth</HI> (with a Soul-believing Mouth) <HI>my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day:</HI> But if we separate the promises of God, from Christs flesh, or his flesh from the promises, then his flesh profiteth no more, then if it were eaten with a mans natural Mouth▪ which (accord∣ing to our blessed Saviour) <HI>profiteth nothing,</HI> or would not profit the Soul at all:</P>
<P>Upon the whole it was concluded, that <HI>W. Bullocks</HI> second (as his first) Scripture, fell short of the mark; that is of proving <HI>a Quakers pretended Saviour within him, to be the true, not the false Christ.</HI></P>
<P>The next Speaker was <HI>Patience Bullock:</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. She propounded a Question to me: <HI>Quest. Whether Christ could have saved us, without his being God?</HI></P>
<P><HI>I Answered,</HI> Though Christ could not save us, unless he were God, as well as Man: yet the Godhead of the Son (only as such) doth not save us from the curse of the Law, because the Godhead alone could not ful∣fill that righteousness (active and passive) which the Law required; 'tis true, we read of the righteousness of God. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5 21. yet, it is not to be understood for the essential righteousness of God, but for a righteous∣ness answerable unto the Law performed by the manhood of Christ, to which the Godhead gave both efficacy and excellency, <HI>Heb.</HI> 9. 14. and thereby the righteousness answerable to the holiness and justice of the Law, performed by the Man hood (soul and body) of Jesus Christ, was made Meritorious and Satisfactory for sin; as the Apostle signifies, <HI>Heb.</HI> 9. 14. <HI>How much more shall the blood</HI> (i.e. Sufferings <HI>of Christ, who</HI> (or which suffering Christ) <HI>through the eternal Spirit</HI> (i. e. Godhead of the Son) <HI>offered himself</HI> (<HI>sc.</HI> a Sacrifice) <HI>without spot to God</HI> (the Father)
<PB N="28" REF="000313_0032_0FA4A9FA377D5E38"/>
hence I did affirm, that Jesus Christ (as ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) is our only <HI>Material Savi∣our;</HI> and so good old <HI>Simion</HI> (if he may be believed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> assures us, from the direction of Gods Spirit, That the Man child the Lord Christ, then born of the <HI>Virgin Mary</HI> whom <HI>Simion</HI> took <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his arms, was the <HI>Salvation of God</HI> (<HI>i.e.</HI> whom God had exalted to be the only Saviour <HI>Act.</HI> 5. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.) and the holy Apostles preached (as afore note<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>) the Man Jesus Christ of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> to be believed in for the remission of sins: here∣withal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> named that Text <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Scripture, in the 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 5. 6 <HI>There is one Mediator between God and Man, the Man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.</HI> The Apostle doth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o: (as I said) here assert, the Man Jesus Christ, to exclude the God head, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> na∣ture, from him the Mediator, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ansom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r, but emphatically to demon∣strate that nature, in which he mediates, and gave himself a ransome; for though the ransome was paid by him who was and is God, or had a divine Nature: yet, it was paid in the Man hood, or humane nature only, that is to say, Christs humane Nature only was the matter of our ran∣som, although the divine Nature gave worth and value to it: whence I did infer (but with much reverence) that the Manhood of the Son of God, is the only material cause of our Salvation: and by necessary con∣sequence, the Man hood, or Humane Nature of Christ, was, and is, our only material Saviour; which I had no sooner said: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>F. E.</HI> called on the people to take notice, <HI>That I had declared the Man hood of Christ to be the only Saviour:</HI> to which, some of the Hearers forthwith replied, that I did say, <HI>to wit, that the Manhood of Christ is our only material Saviour:</HI> which (as I suppose) he understood not, and therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e said no more: howbeit, I expected some reply from Mrs. <HI>Patience Bullock</HI> (no small <HI>Pro∣phetess</HI> in their <HI>Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine Synagogue</HI>) but instead of a Reply, she puts forth another Question: <HI>sc.</HI></P>
<P>Quest. 2. <HI>Whether we could be saved by Christ, without the operation of the Spirit in us?</HI></P>
<P><HI>I Answered:</HI> Although it were granted▪ <HI>sc.</HI> That we could not be sa∣ved, without the operations of the Spirit in us: yet, this would be nothing to the business before us: that is, it doth not prove <HI>a Quakers-pretended Saviour within him, to be the true, not the false Christ:</HI> forasmuch as the operations of the Spirit in us, are not Christ, God-man, therefore not our Saviour: again, I told her, let it be granted, that we cannot be saved without the effects and operations of the spirit in us: yet here-hence it will not follow, that we are saved for, or by these effects and ope∣rations of the Spirit in us: so that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Questions</HI> were (by the judicious hearers) plainly discerned, to lay aside the ma∣terial Saviour; and to insinuate a Spirit, and its operations (still the <HI>Idol-light</HI>)
<PB N="29" REF="000313_0033_0FA4A9FAE96A7290"/>
within, to be the true Christ and only Saviour; thereupon, I denied the Spirits operations in us, to be the previous, procuring cause or ground of redemption, justification, and salvation with God; and that it is one thing to affirm that we cannot be saved without the efficacies of the spirit in us, as evidential, and another thing to be saved for, or by these operations in us, as causal; to which she made no return:</P>
<P>Let me here add, what her last Question hath since brought to my re∣membrance; namely, somewhat (touching this Question) the men of <HI>Rome,</HI> have commonly expressed: the Apostle (say they) excludes from justification, works which we our selves do meaning, <HI>Tit.</HI> 3. 5. <HI>Not by works of righteousness that we have done,</HI> &amp; Rom 11. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. <HI>If it be by works, then were grace no more grace,</HI>) that is (as they wrongly gloss) works done by our own strength, without the help of the Grace of God, not these works we do by the aid of the spirit within us, which is the same with that of the carnal Prophetess above, only it is expressed in plainer words, so that in truth, her Question is but a sly design, to renew again the old <HI>Papish</HI> trick, to elude the genuine force of such Texts, as above asserted: and in good earnest, a <HI>Quakers</HI> light within, is but the <HI>Pope</HI> without:</P>
<P>By the way, in reference to her last question, let two things be serious∣ly considered:</P>
<P N="1">1. That <HI>Carnal Gospellers</HI> do but deceive their own souls, by resting in a bare literal, or historical assent, that <HI>the Man Jesus Christ of Nazareth is the true Christ, and our only Saviour,</HI> while they are in no degree parta∣kers of the divine nature, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 4. i.e. of the effectual graces of Christs spirit, <HI>sc.</HI> a living <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aith, a lively hope love unfeigned, true repen∣tance, &amp;c. but are slighters, and professed rejectors of them.</P>
<P N="2">2. As <HI>Carnal Gospellers</HI> do thus deceive themselves; so do <HI>Anti Go∣spellars</HI> (as <HI>Quakers</HI>) no less (yea, much more) put a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heat upon their own Souls, by their idle pretences, <ABBR><HI>viz</HI></ABBR> that the Graces, effects and ope∣rations of the spirit within them, maketh the true Christ, and their only Saviour from sins: Alas, poor deluded ones, this is to testifie, that the effects of Christs death sufferings, redemption▪ and righteousness do constitute the true Christ, and Mans only Saviour: which effects and ope∣rations (say ye) being followed in all righteousness, will bring you to Salvation: now, what is all this? but in plain English, to be brought to salvation, by the obedience of works: Oh let every g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od Christian tremble to think of the dreadful consequence of this your God provo∣king Doctrine; for, it is a manifest renouncing of the righteousness and obedience of the Son of God▪ Jesus Christ of <HI>Nazareth</HI> whom God the Father hath exalted to be the only Saviour to give remission of sins and
<PB N="30" REF="000313_0034_0FA4A9FC0A861780"/>
salvation to all, that rightly believe on him, as is aboundantly fore∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>▪</P>
<P>Next to Mrs <HI>Bullock,</HI> the Champion <HI>Francis,</HI> starts up, who (who(<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of God had silenced is <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> labourer</HI> in the work of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Christ) repeats some words in the <HI>New-Testament; But ye are wash∣ed, him ye are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, but ye are justifies by the spirit of God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. I requested him to shew me where<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> might find those words; he replied, that the words which he had spoken were Scripture: But (I said) thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> that Scripture, as the Text it self made it to appear, which is in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Cor</HI> 6.11. <HI>And such were some of you, but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and by the spirit of our God.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Note here, that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> words which concern Justification [<HI>sc. In the Name of the Lord Jesus</HI>] were omitted the more craftily to abuse our judgements, that we might believe justification in the sight of God, is a work of the spirit in us, and consequently, <HI>that a Quakers pretended Saviour was within him.</HI></P>
<P>I pray thee <HI>Frances,</HI> how doth this accord with the confession of thy faith, contained in thy <HI>Answer</HI> to my <HI>Question</HI> above: surely Captain <HI>Bascomb</HI> might have told thee, that thou wouldest deny that thy confes∣sion of the Faith not only by, but before tomorrow, by this all men may see what a blind Guid he is: to be at once (almost on a breath) guilty of such gross contradiction, and yet insensible of it.</P>
<P N="3">3. My special <HI>Answer</HI> was, that [<HI>Spirit</HI>] in the last clause of that verse, is to be referred to sanctification, as it is in all other New Testament Scriptures, 2 <HI>Thess.</HI> 2. 13. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 2. &amp;c. and to be sanctified is mostly at∣tributed to the spirits efficiency; and as to the Text above, it is, as if the order of the words had been thus▪ But ye are sanctified by the spirit of our God, but ye are justified by the Name of the Lord Jesus: I know▪ that the <HI>Teaching, Seducing Quakers,</HI> do convert the transposition in the Text, into a confusion, by confounding justification and sanctification: whereas the transposition in that Text, doth no more confound justifica∣tion and sanctification, then the transposition in <HI>Mat.</HI> 7. 6. confounds Swine and Dogs: <HI>Give not</HI> (saith Christ) <HI>that which is holy to Dogs, nei∣ther cast your P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> before Swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rent you.</HI> Though <HI>turn again,</HI> and <HI>rent you,</HI> be in the last clause of the verse, yet it is to be referred to the <HI>Dogs,</HI> not to he <HI>Swine:</HI> for as <HI>Swine</HI> do trample under their fee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, so <HI>Dogs</HI> do fly upon a man, rent∣ing and tearing him down: This instance plainly shews that the transpo∣sition in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6. 11. above, doth not hinder the joyning of sanctification to the Spirit, nor justification to the Name of the Lord Jesus alone it

being according to the tenour of the whole <HI>New-Testament▪</HI></P>
<P>And instead of a <HI>Reply, Francis</HI> tells us of his experimental interest in that Text: saying, that he was washed and justified in himself from his sins; and at length he told us, how; <HI>to wit,</HI> in some measure: Here∣up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> demanded, what the sins in particular were, from which he was in himself washed and justified in some measure? whether it were from <HI>The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>▪</HI> or <HI>Drunkenness, Oathes,</HI> or <HI>Adultery?</HI> he replied, <HI>I am not to tell the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>:</HI> the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more seriously I requested the Assembly, to take notice of his want of knowledge in the Scriptures; inasmuch, as that he makes justifi∣cation from sin, not only a work within him, but to be daily wrought in himself by measure, or degrees, which assertion of his, is directly con∣trary to the mani<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Scriptures of truth which proved the third <HI>Argu∣ment,</HI> to wit, <HI>that our justification from sins, was at once finished and perfected</HI> (without us) <HI>on the Cross, by the offering of the one body of Jesus Christ once for all;</HI> and so already do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e by Jesus Christ, and in being, in him our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead: nevertheless i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was readily granted by me, <HI>sc.</HI> that all things re∣lating to our washing and justification from sins, by that one sacrifice of the body of Christ, as above; is to be believed in for the remission of sins, and for the making of that blessed work (so already finished) effectual in us it is to be received and wrought, not at once, but by degrees and in measure by the working and operation of the Spirit of God in us, until Mortality be swallowed up of life; hereunto agrees the words of the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> 1 Tim 2. 5, 6. <HI>The man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransome for all, to be testified in due time;</HI> [<HI>Gave</HI>] referring to the time past, the work of ransome being already done, and perfected. [<HI>To be testified</HI>] i.e. by the spirit of Faith (2 <HI>Cor</HI> 4. 13. and by its effects in the hearts of Believers, [<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ndue time</HI>] i.e. in Gods appointed time: so then when the spirit saith, as above <HI>sc.</HI> That the Man Jesus Christ gave himself a ransome [<HI>For all</HI>] i e. for all them, by whom the ransomer is believed on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and in whom the virtue and effects of the ransome are by the spirit influenced and wrought: these things are, according to the Scriptures, given by the inspiration of God, (2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. 16.) whereas this <HI>Doctor'</HI>s new Divinity (to wit, <HI>That he is in himself washed and justified from his sins, in some measure</HI>) It is most false and dangerous Do∣ctrine: for it doth clearly deny, that the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssias,</HI> Jesus Christ of <HI>Naza∣reth,</HI> hath at once by his own crucified body (without us) on the Crosse, finished Transgression, and made an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd of sin all which (and much more) is the joynt Testimony of the Prophets and Apostles concerning the Man Jesus Christ, and the work of ransome effected by him for sinners, while ungodly, unjust and enemies to God. <HI>Rom.</HI> 5. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>Note, that this truth, doth fully answer the <HI>Quakers</HI> cavil, about this
<PB N="32" REF="000313_0036_0FA4A9FD360763F0"/>
matter: <HI>how i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sin</HI> (say they) <HI>finished without a Man, while no good is wrought within him:</HI> and seeing (as they further say) <HI>Christ works all things in us by his Spirit, how then can all things be fin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shed by Christ without us, before any good is wrought by him in us?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> It is most necessarily presupposed, that all things were finished by the Man Jesus Christ (as above explained) for satisfaction to his Fa∣thers justice for sin, before we could receive that satisfaction by Faith, or its effects by the spirit within us: Now, its most certain, that before Faith (with its fruits and effects) was wrought in us by the spirit: we were unbelievers, ungodly, unjust, and <HI>enemies to God in our minds by wick∣ed works,</HI> Col. 1. 21. then according to right reason; if the one had not been first wrought by Jesus Christ without us, it had been altogether im∣possible for the other to have been wrought in us, or received by Faith, and so witnessed unto by us; consider once more, if the Man Jesus Christ had not first given himself a ransome for our sins, we could not have re∣ceived it by Faith, nor could it have been Testified or witnessed unto, by us: Moreover, let it be well observed, that all the righteousness of Sanctification that is in us from Christ, is but a fruit of that righteous∣ness of Justification, which Jesus Christ of <HI>Nazareth</HI> wrought out by his own personal obedience and sufferings upon the Crosses yea, all the gra∣ces and operations of the spirit wrought in us, were thereby merited and purchased for us.</P>
<P>Therefore <HI>Francis,</HI> your being in yourself washed and justified from your sins, in some measure; is, plainly to deny that one <HI>Propitiatory Sa∣crifice,</HI> of the one crucified body of the true Man Jesus Christ, which can be no other then a wretched design, to blot out of our hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the blessed Name and Remembrance of that one great propitiation once of∣fered for sins, together with the redemption, righteousness and reconcili∣ation to God, as already (in Christ our head and surety) purchased and perfected for us until, no other righteousness or redemption be known, but that of obedience to the Light (that <HI>unbloody</HI> Redeemer) which is (ye say) in every man that comes into the World: and thus, so much o∣bedience to the <HI>Idol-light</HI> within, so much redemption, washing justifying and no more. (Here hence <HI>Francis,</HI> comes (thus in some measure in thy self) this is the voice of your Law-working spirit within: teaching<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that <HI>he that doth these things shall live by them;</HI> The <HI>Pope</HI> without is become a <HI>Quakers</HI> Light within: I have now done with the enlargements upon his affirmation, <HI>to wit,</HI> That he was [<HI>In some measure</HI>] washed and justi∣fied in himself from his sins: The next Apparition is of</P>
<P><HI>William Bullock</HI> again: And he tells us, <HI>the Law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus, hath made us free from sin.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="000313_0037_0FA4A9FE1C389430"/>
<HI>Answ.</HI> 1. I prayed him to tell me, where I might find those words <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> by him; he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> taught his <HI>Answer,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>It is Scripture<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I told him, that he had (according to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Quakers</HI> practice) mangled and abu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d that holy Text of <HI>Scripture,</HI> intended by him; Namely,</P>
<P>Rom 8. 2. <HI>For the Law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus, hath made me free from the Law of sin and death;</HI></P>
<P>But he repeated [<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI>] or [<HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>] and free from sin: for, free from the law of sin and left out the word [<HI>Death.</HI>]</P>
<P N="2">2. I desired him, to frame his <HI>Argument,</HI> to prove the matter contro∣verted <HI>sc. That a Quakers pretended Saviour within him, is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, not the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alse Christ:</HI> But no Argument from the Text (nor any thing like it) was alledged by him, long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing perhaps, made him so empty.</P>
<P>Therefore 3. I said, That it is the Law of the Spirit of life (not in a <HI>Quaker</HI> but) in Christ Jesus and that there is not (nor ever was) any other Jesus Christ a Saviour from sin, but the Holy Child Jesus, born of <HI>Mary</HI> in <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> the City of <HI>David,</HI> Luk. 2. 4, 11. which Saviour i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not to be found in any <HI>Quaker;</HI> and therefore this place of Scripture pretended by thee, falls short of maintaining your cause, as it respects the first part of the charge: which did appear on a due examination of the Text it self, in this manner: <HI>to wit.</HI></P>
<P>Exam. <HI>By the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus,</HI> we are to understand, <HI>the Spirit which the Father gave him</HI> (as the Son of Man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/><HI>without measure,</HI> Joh. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 34. <HI>Joh.</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 6. Now, from this fulness of Spiritual Life in Christ, <HI>Paul</HI> received such a degree of it, as made him <HI>free from the Law</HI> (i.e. from the reign and dominion) of <HI>sin,</HI> and from <HI>Death, Rom.</HI> 6. 12. 14 (i.e. from the power of natural death) Note, that the <HI>Spirit</HI> in the Text above is set down two waves:</P>
<P N="1">1. By the Subject in whom it is; that is, in the Manhood of Christs Person, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></P>
<P N="2">2. By the Effect, it is a spirit of life; if this life be not (<HI>from Christs fulness</HI>) conveyed into us, we are but dead men, <HI>spiritually dead in sins, Eph</HI> 2. 1. But when the spirit of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> (from Christs unmeasurable fulness) is derived to us, then we feel its law (or power) weakening and abolish∣ing the Law (<HI>i.e.</HI>) the strength and Authority) of sin in as; and thereby sin hath now, no reigning, domineering power in or over us, nor can i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> condemn our persons: and thus, <HI>we are freed from the Law of sin &amp; death.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Note.</HI> Not so freed, as if we were simply delivered from both or either of these as that we cannot afterwards sin and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e: but the meaning is, sin cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, or exercise a command now ever us, nor can it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, nor can the natural <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th hurt us: now tell me <HI>William,</HI> whether <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be ought in this third Text of Scripture alledged by thee, that doth in
<PB N="34" REF="000313_0038_0FA4A9FEE252CDE0"/>
the least (though never so much strained) prove this first part of the charge against you, to be false; for the mind of the Apostle therein i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> plain and evident, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that the law of the Spirit of life inherent in us, hath only a virtue to eat down the Law (or commanding power) of pre∣sent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ins, and to destroy the power of our natural death: what (I pray thee) is in all this, to prove a <HI>Quakers pretended Saviour within him,</HI> &amp;c. surely <HI>William,</HI> either thou art very silly thy self, or thou didst think thy hearers to be so:</P>
<P>After him steps <HI>F. E.</HI> again, and said, the Scripture saith of Christ, <HI>I in thee, and thou in me:</HI> but he could not tell us, where to find the Scrip∣ture, that said those words of Christ.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> That I did not remember any such Scripture, for manner, and form; as spoken by him: <HI>to wit, I in the, and thou in me;</HI> but this <HI>Parret</HI> must prate as he hath been taught; howbeit, if it might be supposed (not granted) that Christ had said to any particular person, [<HI>I in thee, and thou in me:</HI>] It must needs follow, that the person of Christ was without (not within) him, to whom he then spake; and the person of Christ, being the Believers only Saviour: this allegation, could not concern the charge before us.</P>
<P>Tis true, we read in <HI>Joh</HI> 17 23: <HI>I in them, and thou in me, that they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e made perfect in me:</HI> i.e. in oneness of affection; for so it is interpreted, in the last clause of the same verse, <HI>sc. and hast loved them as thou hast lo∣ved me;</HI> also in <HI>Joh.</HI> 14. 20. <HI>and you in me, and I in you:</HI> these words do only signifie the reciprocal love, that shall be fully experienced between Christ and his members, at the glorious resurrection of the just, as it is implied in the former part of that verse: <HI>At that day</HI> (namely of Christs second comming in glory, <HI>ver.</HI> 18.) <HI>ye shall (sc.</HI> at that day) <HI>know that I am in my Father</HI> (<HI>i.e.</HI> in his love) <HI>and you in me</HI> (i.e. in my love) <HI>and I in you</HI> (i.e. in your love, <HI>ver.</HI> 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.) Now <HI>Francis</HI> if thou dost mean, either of these Scriptures, thou wilt be still at a loss; for it was the man Jesus Christ, which spake to his Disciples and it is very strange, that thou wilt produce a Christ for evidence, in whom you do not believe: its a sign, <HI>that thou art almost spent;</HI> I do not remember that he made any reply to ought said by me, as above: but as a mark for their nakedness he urged another Scripture (not naming where, as to the chapter or verse) <HI>to wit</HI> Christ saith of himself, <HI>I am Alpha and Omega:</HI></P>

<PB N="35" REF="000313_0039_0FA4A9FF74102BB8"/>
Argumentations, which defect, constrained me to insist upon the explica∣tion (herein more fully and distinctly enlarged) of those <HI>Texts</HI> of Scrip∣ture, which (for the most part) were only repeated by the <HI>titular Dispu∣tants,</HI> and that many times after their own most presumptuous mode and manner, adding or diminishing contrary to Gods command, <HI>Deut.</HI> 4. 2. But I proceed to the <HI>Text</HI> it self:</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> The place of Scripture above, <HI>sc. Rev.</HI> 1. 8. consists of three parts. <HI>First part, I am Alpha and Omega,</HI> in these words Christs crea∣ting power is Metaphorically expressed, being the first and last letters in the <HI>Greek Alphabet;</HI> which (by a figurative speech) are applied to any beginning and end; and are here interpreted, by the next words, name∣ly, the <HI>Beginning</HI> and the <HI>Ending:</HI> which Phrases, do signifie unto us Christs divine Nature, eternal Power, and Godhead, as in <HI>Joh.</HI> 1. ver. 1. <HI>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God,</HI> (sc. God the Son) and in <HI>Col.</HI> 1. 16. <HI>All things were created by him</HI> (his dear Son, <HI>ver.</HI> 13.) <HI>and for him</HI> (sc. for his glory, as the ultimate end, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. 36.) this therefore is the meaning of [<HI>I am Alpha and Omega</HI>] that is, Christ is the efficient cause of all things, and the end also, whither all things are referred: that he hath at first created all things, and that for his own glory alone.</P>
<P>Second part, <HI>Saith the Lord,</HI> which words, denote Christ the faithful promiser, <HI>for all the promises of God are in him,</HI> 2 Cor. 1. 20. in him, <HI>i.e.</HI> in the man hood of Christs person, <HI>Col.</HI> 2 9. hereunto agrees the title [<HI>Lord▪</HI>] which is mostly appropriated to Christs humane nature, as be∣fore his Birth, <HI>Luk.</HI> 1. 43. <HI>And whence is this to me, that the Mother of my Lord, should come to me;</HI> and on the day of his birth, <HI>Chap.</HI> 2. <HI>ver.</HI> 11. <HI>For to you is born this day, a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord: and afterwards,</HI> Joh. 13. ver. 13, 14. <HI>Ye call me Master, and Lord, for so I am: If I th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n your Lord and Master, have washed your feet:</HI> Also, after his resurrection, <HI>Luk.</HI> 24. 3 4. saying, <HI>The Lord hath risen indeed, and hath oppeared to Simon,</HI> ver 39. <HI>Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I my self,</HI> (meaning, your Lord and Master) and likewise after his ascention, <HI>Act.</HI> 22. 8. <HI>And I answered, who art thou Lord?</HI> and he said unto me, <HI>I am Jesus of Naza∣reth, whom thou persecutest:</HI> to these many more might be added, to evi∣dence that by [<HI>Lord</HI>] in the Text above, the man-hood of Christs per∣son is to be understood, at least not to be excluded: For in <HI>ver.</HI> 11. Christ saith, <HI>I am Alpha and Omega, the first, and the last,</HI> here <HI>Alpha</HI> and <HI>Omega,</HI> are explained by the terms [<HI>Of the first and the last</HI>] that is to say, the Lord Christ is the first, <HI>to wit</HI> subsisting in the beginning with God, and equal with the Father: and the last, having taken the form of a Servant, i.e. <HI>of the meanest man,</HI> and so last in reputation, <HI>Phil.</HI> 2. 6, 7.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="000313_0040_0FA4AA002DD2CA08"/>
Third part; <HI>Which is, and which was and which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to come, the Almigh∣ty:</HI> by the distribution of the threefold time, is meant (as <HI>Aretas,</HI> and <HI>Bright man</HI> on the 4<HI>th.</HI> verse) the trinity of person<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which is, or <HI>I am,</HI> (as in the first part) are here of the same import, and do refer to the Fat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 3 14. <HI>and which was,</HI> to the Son, <HI>Joh.</HI> 1. <HI>ver.</HI> 1. <HI>And which is come,</HI> to the Holy Ghost <HI>John.</HI> 108, 13.</P>
<P><HI>The Almighty;</HI> This last word of the verse, denotes the omnipotency, eternal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssence and Godhead of Christs person: the sum of both (<HI>sc.</HI> 1. 11.) verses above, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> reveal unto us only two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. The unto of the two Natures in the person of Christ; namely, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was and is true God, and true man in one person.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Trinity of persons, in the unity of Essence.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Francis,</HI> doest thou think, that either of these things (contain∣ing the true sense, of the <HI>Texts</HI> alledged by thee) will prove your cause, <HI>That a Quakers pretended Saviour within him, is the true Christ:</HI> surely, thou canst not be so bruitish as to think so, but rather the contrary, <HI>sc. That it is the false Christ the Devil:</HI> this <HI>Conclusion</HI> made <HI>Patience</HI> (an im∣patient) <HI>Bullock,</HI> she being unable to forbear any longer, calls to me, <HI>What</HI> (quoth she) <HI>dost thou make our Christ within us, to be the Devil?</HI></P>
<P>To her I made <HI>Answer:</HI> saying, that I did solemnly, and with much re∣verence (as in the presence of God, to whom I must shortly be account∣able for my words) declare, that I do most assuredly know, that a <HI>Qua∣kers</HI> pretended Christ within him, is the false Christ, the Devil, whom ye ignorantly believe in, and worship, and with whom ye will be damned in Hell, if ye repent not; to this most serious Declaration, she made no re∣ply at all:</P>
<P>But <HI>F. E.</HI> forthwith replied, saying, <HI>Thou hast no warrant from the Scripture, thus to speak:</HI> I told him, that I had sufficient warrant from the Scriptures, to make good what I had (in the fear of God) declared: and fort with I alledged the words of Jesus Christ of <HI>Nazareth</HI> himself, <HI>Joh.</HI> 8 24. <HI>I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins,</HI> this Scrip∣ture silenced him likewise, and thereupon I told hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that the true Christ had stopt his mouth.</P>
<P>Let me here add some other Scriptures, for some further warrant, as <HI>Joh.</HI> 3. 18 <HI>He that believeth not</HI> (sc. on the Son of God, sent into the World, <HI>ver.</HI> 17.) <HI>is condemned already,</HI> that is, he is as sure to be damned, as if he was actually in Hell: and in <HI>ver.</HI> 36. <HI>He that believeth not on the Son</HI> (<HI>sc.</HI> born of <HI>Mary,</HI> Luk. 1. 35) <HI>shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him:</HI> likewise in <HI>Luk.</HI> 19. 14. <HI>And his Citizens hated him,</HI> (<HI>sc,</HI> the Son of Man, the Saviour, <HI>ver.</HI> 10) <HI>and sent a message after him,</HI> saying, <HI>we will not have this Man to reign over us:</HI> let it be here well Noted, that
<PB N="37" REF="000313_0041_0FA4AA00EE8393D8"/>
the true Christ calls those Citizens his <HI>Enemies,</HI> and such Enemies as he would destroy, <HI>ver.</HI> 27. <HI>But those mine Enemies, which would not that I</HI> (the Son of Man, <HI>ver.</HI> 10. above) <HI>should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me:</HI> in <HI>Mark</HI> also, <HI>Chap.</HI> 16. <HI>ver.</HI> 16. <HI>He that believeth not</HI> (sc. on Jesus risen from the dead, <HI>ver.</HI> 9.) <HI>shall be damned.</HI></P>
<P>Now <HI>Frank,</HI> didst not thou speak under the <HI>Power of Satan,</HI> when thou didst so openly and confidently affirm, that I had no warrant to speak as I did, when I spake to thy fellow-Labourer in the work of the false Christ?</P>
<P>The next Bolt was shot by <HI>William Bullock,</HI> and he tells us, <HI>The Light makes manifest;</HI> lifting up his voice lowder and lowder, crying out, <HI>tell me, tell me, the true, and real meaning of those words; the Light makes mani∣fest:</HI> I surely thought, that his lewd <HI>Lowing,</HI> and <HI>Bellowing,</HI> was to pre∣vent my asking of him, where those words might be found in the Scrip∣tures; which I did forbear to ask, because I knew his Answer, (<HI>sc.</HI> tis <HI>Scripture.</HI>)</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. I told him, that he was at his old trade of mangling the Scriptures: and then shewed him wherein; namely, that it was not the Light madeth manifest; but whatsoever doth make manifest, is Light: which the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to appear, in <HI>Eph.</HI> 5. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3. <HI>But all things that are re∣proved, are made manifest by the Light:</HI> for, <HI>whatsoever doth make manifest is light.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. By <HI>Light,</HI> here; we are to understand, a <HI>Sin reproving-light:</HI> inas∣much as the latter part, doth interpret the former part of the verse, <HI>sc. But all things that are reproved, are made manifest by the Light,</HI> (<HI>i.e.</HI> by the Light of Scripture) whence <HI>Paul</HI> argues thus: for whatsoever doth make manifest (in a way of Reproof) is light (<HI>sc.</HI> Scriptural light as before) for▪ the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tten Scriptures are frequently described by <HI>Light,</HI> Psal. 119. 105. <HI>Thy Word is a Light unto my path,</HI> Isai 8. 20. <HI>To the Law, and to the Testimony, if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them:</HI> Here the written Word (such, was the Law and Testi∣mony) is the only manifesting, and so determining light, either for re∣prehension, or satisfaction (in cases of error and doubts) and the reason of it, is assigned by the Apostle, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. 16. <HI>All Scripture is given by in∣spiration of God, and is profitable for Reproof, for Instruction</HI> (or manifesta∣tion and hereunto agrees the words of our Lord and Saviour, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3. 26, 21. <HI>For every one that doth evil hateth the Light, neither cometh to the Light, lest his deeds should be [reproved:] But he that doeth truth, cometh to the Light, that his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeds ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be made manifest.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. B<HI>y Light</HI> (in these verses) Christ understands the <HI>Doctrinal light</HI> (contained in the written Scripture of the <HI>New-Testament</HI>) which was
<PB N="38" REF="000313_0042_0FA4AA01A9C13D50"/>
preached by him, and his Apostles: hence it is, that the Lord Christ, <HI>Joh.</HI> 8. 12. and his Apostles, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5. 14. are called the <HI>light of the World.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That this Light, doth <HI>reprove,</HI> ver. 20. <HI>and manifest,</HI> ver. 21. well then <HI>William,</HI> thy demand is granted thee; namely, that the true and real meaning of the Text (intended by thee) is this: <HI>to wit, That the light of Scripture, doth make reproved evils manifest,</HI> or <HI>evils manifest, which are to be reproved:</HI> this being the true and real meaning, how doth it prove the thing designed? <HI>sc. That the light within thee, is the true, not the false Christ:</HI> I hope, then art not such a <HI>Bullock,</HI> as to think i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the true Christ. Now forasmuch as that I have the advantage of more liberty (without interruption) to enlarge, I will shew thee (<HI>W. B.</HI>) two things (from the Light, in the Text recited by thee, as above.)</P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> That the Light o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Scripture, doth make some of a <HI>Quakers</HI> evils manifest.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That it doth reprove those their evils.</P>
<P>For he first, <HI>sc.</HI> That the Light of Scripture, doth manifest some of a <HI>Quakers</HI> evils. As 1. The evil of <HI>Antichristianisme,</HI> 2 Joh. ver. 7. <HI>For many Deceivers are entred into the World, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, this is a deceiver and an Antichrist.</HI></P>
<P>Observe by the way, when ever this <HI>Text</HI> of Scripture is mentioned against the <HI>Quakers;</HI> they presently frame a pretence, whereby they would seem to go off with some credit; telling us, that we make a man of straw, and then knock him down: for who is it (say they) of us, that doth deny Jesus Christ is come in the flesh; we do (say they) confess that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, that he suffered, and died in the flesh:</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> This is such a pitiful shift, nay, such a deceitful covering, that the weakest eye may look through it; they well kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w, how unable they are to deal with the Arguments, which are in the inspired Scriptures of God, against the feigned-light Christ within them, have therefore made the hole above, to creep out at: but this their juggle, is no other then what hath been already discovered: namely, That it was not the visible body of Christs flesh, which was or is Christ the Saviour, but the Christ in that appearing body of his flesh; and as the Christ was in this his flesh, so he is in every mans flesh, that comes into the World. And hence it is, that a Teaching <HI>Quaker,</HI> when he is pratling of the <HI>Idol-light</HI> within, he layes his hand upon his breast; saying Jesus Christ is manifest in this flesh: (meaning in his real flesh: but Christs flesh was only in shew and appear∣ance.) This their folly brings to mind, what Mr. <HI>Hamorth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> (a converted <HI>Quaker</HI>) doth asseat in his Epistle to <HI>John Crook,</HI> a <HI>Teaching Quaker,</HI> Being (<HI>saith he</HI>) lately in discourse with some <HI>Quakers,</HI> who held, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="39" REF="000313_0043_0FA4AA0296210A00"/>
<Q>it was the Light within, that was crucified without the Gates of <HI>Jerusa∣lem:</HI> And in the same Epistle, he further saith, I can never forget <HI>James Nayler,</HI> whom I saw suffer, and what was the fruit of that Spirit by which he was acted, was he not strangely lifted up in Pride, to make himself the <HI>Messiah,</HI> and take divine Worship to himself: For (saith he) <HI>John Bolton</HI> told me, that he stood by and saw three Women, one after another, fall down and worship him, and one of them in her bow∣ings, had these words: <HI>to wit,</HI> Thy Name is no more <HI>James,</HI> but <HI>I Am:</HI> And <HI>James Nayler</HI> told <HI>John Bolton,</HI> that if he worshipped his body, he should refuse it; but if that within him he would accept it:</Q> Hereunto agrees <HI>William Harriots</HI> Doctrine (at the time of the Disputation) <HI>we a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> (quoth he) <HI>deny the out side Christ, to be the true Christ and Saviour;</HI> so then, according to this <HI>Doctors</HI> Divinity: there is another Christ, name∣ly an <HI>inside Christ,</HI> which he doth worship and believe in, for his Salva∣tion from sin and wrath; But I shall tell him more of my mind, in its due place.</P>
<P>I now return to some further consideration, of what they have above affirmed; which is, that they do not deny (but confess) that Jesus Christ is considered as distinct from the <HI>flesh:</HI> and therefore (according to a <HI>Quaker▪</HI> Faith) the true Christ and Saviour is within the flesh: that is, (as to their sense) in the flesh, <HI>of every man that comes into the World,</HI> and therefore (as they say) they are neither <HI>Deceivers</HI> nor <HI>Antichrists:</HI> To clear this Smoaky co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t:</P>
<P><HI>I Answer,</HI> These words [<HI>In the flesh</HI>] though they are frequently inserted in the Scriptures of Truth, yet do never signifie a thing distinct from the flesh, but alwayes the flesh it self, as it may appear by manifold instance (referring to man kind <HI>flesh,</HI> consisting of Soul and Body, the true or whole man) <HI>Gen.</HI> 17. 24, 25. <HI>Abraham</HI> a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>shmael,</HI> circumcised in the <HI>flesh,</HI> i. e. the <HI>flesh</HI> it self was circumcised, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2. 28. outward in the <HI>flesh,</HI> i.e. the outside <HI>flesh,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7. 28. <HI>Such shall have trouble in the flesh,</HI> i.e. their bodies of <HI>flesh</HI> shall have trouble: furthermore, the Apostle puts this matter beyond all Dispute, <HI>Psal.</HI> 1. 22. <HI>But if I live in the flesh, i.e.</HI> to abide in the <HI>flesh,</HI> ver. 24. which he explains in <HI>ver.</HI> 25. <HI>I know, that I shall abide and continue with you all,</HI> i.e. I (<HI>Paul,</HI> true man, consisting of Soul and body) know that I shall abide with you; wherein it is most plain that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his <HI>Phrasiologie</HI> (in the <HI>flesh</HI>) doth not denote a thing distinct from the <HI>flesh,</HI> but the very mankind <HI>flesh</HI> it self. For here, by <HI>Paul'</HI>s being in the <HI>flesh,</HI> he understands his whole man: Howbeit, let me improve these last verses a little more, by propounding thence a Question.</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>What is it to confess that Paul is come in the flesh?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> It is to confess, that <HI>Paul</HI> is come true man, consisting of Soul

and body (as above, <HI>ver.</HI> 25.) And consequently, not to confess that <HI>Paul</HI> is come true man, is to deny him come in the flesh▪</P>
<P>But, to say that <HI>Paul</HI> is come in the <HI>flesh;</HI> doth signifie <HI>sc. Paul</HI> is to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e considered as distinct from his body of Flesh: And so to be in the <HI>flesh</HI> of every man that comes into the world, would be an interpretation, not on∣ly contrary to the Scripture, above, but so absurd and irrational, as be∣coming none but seduced, seducing <HI>Quakers:</HI> from whence I may safely infer. That whosoever doth not confess that Jesus Christ is come true man, consisting of Soul and Body, doth deny that Jesus Christ is come in the <HI>Flesh;</HI> But Teaching, Seducing <HI>Quakers,</HI> do not confess that Jesus Christ is come true man, consisting of Soul and Body: <HI>Ergo,</HI> they do deny that Jesus Christ is come in the Flesh: And by good con∣sequence from the whole they cannot deny (unless they will deny truth in God) themselves to be Deceivers and Antichrists Moreover the same Apostle <HI>John,</HI> puts a <HI>Question,</HI> 1 Joh 2. 22. <HI>Who is a lyar?</HI> and then <HI>Answers it: But he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ;</HI> and sor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h adds, <HI>he is Antichrist:</HI> w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll then, according to the Scripture of truth, <HI>he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ, is a lyar and an Antichrist:</HI> But a Tea∣ching <HI>Quaker</HI> doth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Jesus, to be the Christ: <HI>Ergo,</HI> a Teaching <HI>Qua∣ker</HI> is (by the spirits Testimony) a <HI>Lyar</HI> and an <HI>Antichrist:</HI> The <HI>Propo∣sition,</HI> being the words of that Scripture, <HI>ver.</HI> 22. may not be gain said: the <HI>Assumption</HI> I do prove t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us; <HI>The Jesus intended by the Apostle, is Jesus born of Mary▪</HI> (who is called Christ, <HI>Mat.</HI> 1. 16.) the <HI>Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God among the Jesus,</HI> Act. 2. 23. But a Teaching <HI>Qua∣ker</HI> doth deny Jesus of <HI>Nazareth</HI> (born of <HI>Mary</HI>) a man approved of God among the <HI>Jews,</HI> to be the Christ, and therefore the Conclusion is undeniable: <HI>sc.</HI> That a Teaching <HI>Quaker</HI> doth deny that Jesus is the Christ: And as this is undeniable, so is the other; namely That a Tea∣ching <HI>Quaker</HI> is a Lyar and an Antichrist: which is further evidenced, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 4. 3. <HI>And every Spirit that con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is not of God,</HI> and this is that spirit of Antichrist: (in the flesh, here is put for the flesh it self) as in Scriptures aforementioned: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow to deny Christs Manhood to be a Saviour, is to deny Jesus to be the Christ.</P>

Mankind flesh, or true and whole Man; for so the Phrase (in the Flesh) <HI>cannotates,</HI> as it hath been already cleared from the Scriptures of God: so that, [<HI>God was ma∣nifest in the flesh</HI>] doth not teach us, that God is to be considered as distinct from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he flesh; but that God was manifest flesh, real man-kind <HI>flesh,</HI> and thereby the Godhead and the Manhood were united in the one person of Christ, and made manifest to the Apostles bodily senses, of see∣ing, hearing, and feeling, 1 <HI>Joh,</HI> chap. 1. ver. 1, 2.</P>
<P>Likewise <HI>Paul, Act</HI> 63. 38. <HI>Through this Man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins:</HI> through (or by <HI>ver.</HI> 39.) This Man, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> The man Jesus of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> who by the wicked hands of the Jews, was slain, and hanged on a tree: and then, by God the Father raised from the dead the third day, and exalted to be a Saviour to give remission of sins, <HI>Act.</HI> 2. 22. Chap. 5. 29, 30. through [<HI>This Man</HI>] is preached the forgiveness of sins as above: <HI>For so hath the Lord commanded us,</HI> ver. 47. at which comman∣ded Preaching the wicked <HI>Jews</HI> were filled with envy, and spake (as Teaching <HI>Quakers</HI> do) against those things spoken by <HI>Paul</HI> (as above) contradicting and blaspheming <HI>ver.</HI> 45. So much for your first evil ma∣nifested and reproved by the Light of divine Scripture, though there are many professed evils among <HI>Quakers,</HI> which the Light of holy Scrip∣ture doth manifest and reprove: yet, I shall now make mention but of one more, because I would not be too voluminous:</P>
<P>The Second Evil: is, <HI>The professed perfection of a Quakers seeming Sanctity,</HI> consisting in [<HI>Thou and Thee</HI>] thereby denying all reverential respects to any sort of men, of what rank or quality soever.</P>
<P><HI>For method sake:</HI> we will in the first place, hear what they have to say for themselves, touching this matter.</P>
<P N="1">1. They are apt to say▪ (because they have often said it) that [<HI>Thou,</HI> and <HI>You</HI>] are of distinct significations in Scripture, and likewise [<HI>Thee</HI> and <HI>You</HI>] the one signifying a <HI>Singular,</HI> the other a <HI>Plural.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> These terms of (<HI>thou, thee</HI> and <HI>you</HI>) are not alwayes in Scrip∣ture of distinct significations: as it appears, <HI>Lev.</HI> 19. 12. <HI>Ye</HI> (or you) <HI>shall not Swear by my Name falsly, neither shalt thou prophane the Name of thy God:</HI> In this Scripture, <HI>Ye</HI> (or <HI>You</HI>) and <HI>Thou,</HI> are of the same signi∣fication:
<PB N="42" REF="000313_0046_0FA4AA08D8C5A4F0"/>
and in <HI>Jer.</HI> 3. 12. Return <HI>then,</HI> backsliding <HI>Israel,</HI> and I will not cause my anger to fall upon <HI>you:</HI> here likewise, <HI>thou</HI> and <HI>you,</HI> are of the same signification: again, in <HI>Luk.</HI> 17. 21. <HI>the Kingdome of God is within you; you,</HI> here doth (in your sense) signifie each particular <HI>Quaker.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Nor are these words (<HI>see thee</HI> and <HI>you</HI>) alwayes in Scripture of distinct significations, as in <HI>Deut.</HI> 28. 9. herein, <HI>thee,</HI> (a singular) and <HI>ho∣ly People</HI> (a plural) are of the same signification, so in <HI>Isai.</HI> 26. 20. here <HI>People</HI> and <HI>thou</HI> are of the same import: To these Scriptures (would it not render me tedious to the Reader) I might add many more, to gain∣say this their trifling Assertion: for <HI>you</HI> and <HI>thou</HI> are oft in Scripture and reason convertitable terms, for instance, <HI>thou</HI> in the Decalogue is indefi∣nitely understood.</P>
<P N="2">2. They are ready to affirm, <HI>sc.</HI> To salute a single person, under the notion [<HI>You</HI>] is both improper, and irrational, for it were to confound singular, and plural in point of right reason.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Its neither: for, its not improper nor irrational, to say to a single man, This Youth is <HI>your</HI> Son; for <HI>you</HI> are his Father, which to say, is as proper and rational, as to say, <HI>thou</HI> art his Father, and the reason is, be∣cause (<HI>you</HI> and <HI>your</HI>) are of the same nature: inasmuch as the one is de∣rived from the other: Now as [<HI>Your</HI>] is applicable to one as to many, so is (<HI>You</HI>) likewise. Again it is both proper and rational to tell a single person, This house is your house, for you have a good Title to it; which is as proper and rational, as to say, <HI>thou</HI> hast a good Title to the house; and consequently it is not only irrational to affirm, that this doth alwayes confound the terms of (<HI>thou</HI> and <HI>you.</HI>) Its Diabolical to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> (a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Quakers</HI> do) [<HI>thou</HI> and <HI>thee</HI>] making it the daily fuel, for your levilling inflamed-pride.</P>
<P N="3">3. They say for themselves; That holy men (in the Scriptures) did use the words (<HI>thou</HI> and <HI>thee</HI>) not only one to another, but to God him∣self:</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> This is granted; howbeit I pray, can any of you <HI>Quakers</HI> produce me one holy Man (in Scripture expressed) which used these words (<HI>thou</HI> and <HI>thee</HI>) that he might thereby take occasion to deny (as ye wickedly do) all reverential respects to any sort of men of what rank or quality soever: sure I am, ye cannot produce me one such man▪ for this bruitish kind of practice, is contrary to the manifold <HI>Precepts</HI> and <HI>Presidents</HI> also, in the Scriptures of truth, as afterwards shall plainly ap∣pear. Indeed, we Christians do acknowledge, that holy men (in Scrip∣ture) did use the words (<HI>thou</HI> and <HI>thee</HI>) not only one to another, but to God himself, for two eminent Reasons:</P>
<P N="1">1. That they might thereby be kept to the unity of the Godhead; for
<PB N="43" REF="000313_0047_0FA4AA0B5843D290"/>
although Jehovah is Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, yet he is not three Gods, but one, therefore holy men holding their minds to the unity of the essence; <HI>Thou</HI> and <HI>Thee,</HI> were (and are) most proper and necessary to preserve their minds from a plurality of Gods: But this ground can∣not be pleaded by a <HI>Quaker,</HI> who denieth a Trinity in Unity, and so, he denies the only true God.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Reas.</HI> Holy men used these words (<HI>thou</HI> and <HI>thee</HI>) to God, and one to another, as occasionally they were by <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> drawn out to either of these words (<HI>sc. thou</HI> or <HI>thee</HI>) for <HI>all Scripture is given by inspiration of God,</HI> 2 Tim. 3. 16. and in 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 21. <HI>Holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost;</HI> so then, its plain that Holy men (in Scripture) spake these words (<HI>thou</HI> and <HI>thee</HI>)to God, and one to another; but it was then, when they were moved thereunto by the Holy Ghost: but I pray, do ye <HI>Quakers</HI> never use those words (<HI>thou</HI> and <HI>thee</HI>) but then when ye are occasionally drawn out, or moved by the Holy Ghost to ei∣ther: if any of you, should be so notoriously vile, as to father the use of those words (<HI>thou</HI> and <HI>thee</HI>) upon the Spirit, would not the Holy Ghost tell thee, that thou art of thy Father <HI>the Devil, who is a lyar from the be∣ginning.</HI></P>
<P>Again, Although holy men frequently used those words, as above; yet they never thereby took occasion to deny, but ever used reverential re∣spects to all sorts of persons, according to their rank and quality: as for instance, <HI>Abraham,</HI> Gen. 18. 1, 2, 3. <HI>as he sat in the Tent-door, he lift up his eyes and looked, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o, three men</HI> (Angels unawares) <HI>stood by him, and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the Tent door, and bowed himself to the ground, and said my Lord:</HI> And David, 1 <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m.</HI> 20. 41. <HI>rose out of his place, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times to Jona∣than:</HI> Again, in the 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 25. 23, 25. <HI>Abigail saw David, and fell be∣fore him, on her face, and bowed her self to the ground, and called him Lord,</HI> Likewise Ruth, Chap. 2. 10. <HI>She fell on her face, and bowed her self to the ground to Boaz:</HI> And in ver 4. <HI>Boaz courteously said to the Reapers, the Lord be with you; and they</HI> (in reverential respects) <HI>to him.</HI> Answered, <HI>the Lord bless thee.</HI> Furthermore, we read of reverential respects, between <HI>Abraham,</HI> and his Idolatrous Neighbours, <HI>Gen.</HI> 23. 7. <HI>Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the People of the Land, even to the children of H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th,</HI> and ver. 8. <HI>he communed with them saying, if it be your mind:</HI> And ver. 5. <HI>the children of Heth answered Abraham,</HI> saying, <HI>hear us my Lord: thou art a Prince of God amongst us.</HI> And <HI>Solomon</HI> also. 1 King. 2. 19. arose from his Throne, and bowed himself to his Mother; and <HI>Joseph,</HI> Gen. 28. 12. bowed himself to his Father <HI>Jacob,</HI> with his face towards the ground▪ And in the 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3. 6. <HI>Sarah</HI> obeyed <HI>Abraham,</HI> and called him Lord:
<PB N="44" REF="000313_0048_0FA4AA0B67B67548"/>
unto these <HI>Presidents,</HI> many more might be alledged. Thus we see, though these holy persons often used (<HI>thou</HI> and <HI>thee</HI>) yet they ever used reverential respects to all sorts of men, and that according to Gods ex∣press command, as <HI>Lev</HI> 9. 32. <HI>Thou shalt rise up before the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> head, and honour the face of the old man and fear thy God, I am the Lord.</HI> Thus <HI>Mo∣ses</HI> by Gods own inspiration: but his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Quakers</HI> do not: therefore he Light of this Scripture reproves you, as no Fearers of God: And <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> 20. 12. <HI>Honour thy Father and thy Mother,</HI> which is also recited by the Apostle, <HI>Eph.</HI> 6 2. <HI>Honour thy Father and thy Mother, which is the first Commandment with promise;</HI> Note this Commandment comprehends not only Natural Parents. <HI>Heb</HI> 12. 9 the Fathers or our flesh, but the Fa∣thers of our Country as civil Magistrates and Rulers, <HI>Isai,</HI> 49. 23. yea, likewise Spiritual Fathers, as Gospel Ministers are phrased by <HI>Paul,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4. 15. we read, that in our Saviours time, there were some proud Professors, who inclined much towards this Principle and practice of a <HI>Quaker,</HI> (but not in so bad a sense) <HI>Mark</HI> 7. 10 ye (saith Christ) suf∣fer him no more to do ought for his Father and Mother, making the Word of God (the commandment above) of none effect; and indeed as much more do the <HI>Quakers</HI>) <HI>Paul</HI> also, by the same inspiration of God, <HI>Rom.</HI> 13. 7. <HI>Render therefore to all</HI> (meaning higher Powers and Ru∣lers, <HI>ver.</HI> 1, 2.) <HI>their dues, honour to whom honour:</HI> and the Apostle, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 17. <HI>Honour all men,</HI> especially in places of honour) <HI>fear God, honour the King, as Supream and Governour, sent by him.</HI> Moreover, I <HI>Tim.</HI> 5. 3. <HI>Honour Widows, that are Widows indeed;</HI> and in ver. 17. <HI>Let the Elders that Rule well, be counted worthy of denble honour, especially they that labour in the Word and Doctrine.</HI> These Precepts are given by the inspiration of God, and consequently are obligatory on Conscience, to be performed in that useful, commendable, and necessary duty of reverential respects a∣fore declared: and which hath been (in conscience of Gods strict, and indispensible command (obeyed by the holy <HI>Presidents</HI> above.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> As the light of Scripture hath manifested this your second evil also; even so likewise the Light of Scripture doth reprove it.</P>
<P N="1">1. It reproves you, a, such who want the fear of God, as above, <HI>Lev.</HI> 19. 32. and as such, who harden their hearts against, not only the many <HI>Precepts</HI> above, to bind the Conscience, but the many <HI>Presidents</HI> to evi∣dence the practice; Now, as both are manifest, reprovers of you, so I wish they might make you not only ashamed of your sneaking surley, dumb, and scurvy carriage towards Christians: but also convince you, that this kind of Behaviour, is not in the written Scripture without, but from the pretended unwritten Scripture (that <HI>Idol-light</HI>) within: proudly contemning the sacred Oracles of God, above asserted. And
<PB N="45" REF="000313_0049_0FA4AA0C69022F28"/>
which is thus further argued: what can the Saints (in all places and Countries) be more sensible of, then that the generality of <HI>Quakers,</HI> do purposely use those words (<HI>thou</HI> and <HI>thee</HI>) to deny all reverential re∣spects to any sort of men, of what rank and quality soever: that by that means, they may intrude themselves to be equal with any of what rank or sort soever: nay, thereby to advance themselves, above all men, under the notion of a seeming perfection, which is a manifest product of their (God and Man) provoking pride: according to that of the Psal∣mist, <HI>Psal.</HI> 123. 4. <HI>Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning, and con∣tempt of the proud:</HI> and how is the Prophesie fulfilled in you, <HI>Isai.</HI> 3. 5. <HI>The child shall behave himself proudly against the antient, and the base against the Honourable:</HI> and observe ye well the words of the Lord Christ, <HI>Mark</HI> 7. 23. <HI>Deceit, Blasphemy, Pride, Foolishness:</HI> of these four links, hath Sa∣tan made your Chain of darkness; which is most evident, from a due consideration of the foregoing truths: Oh, how suitable is the Prophets Vision to a <HI>Quakers</HI> condition, <HI>Obad.</HI> 1. <HI>ver.</HI> 1, 2. <HI>Behold, I have made thee small, then art greatly despised, the pride of thy heart hath deceived thee,</HI> &amp;c. From the whole be ye advised.</P>
<P N="1">1. To cease from making your Idolized <HI>Thou</HI> and <HI>Thee,</HI> (the spring of your seurvy and surly deportment) with their mask, <HI>to wit,</HI> that holy men (in Scripture recorded) did oft use (<HI>thou</HI> and <HI>thee</HI>) one to another, and to God himself: Now, what is your design herein? can it be ought else, then to put a cheat on the judgements of some ignorant creatures: as thus, Oh surely (say they) the <HI>Quakers</HI> do make Conscience of the Scripture for their warrant and authority; thus poor ignorant ones are deluded by your equivocations: though its most certain, that the Scrip∣ture no there commands a <HI>Quaker</HI> to (<HI>thou</HI> or <HI>thee</HI>) any man, much less Christian Rulers, Governours and Magistrates, (yet these things the un∣mannerly <HI>Quakers</HI> will do) But the Scripture doth command all men to pray for Rulers, Governours and Magistrates, to submit unto them, and to give the honour which is due to them, as Fathers of the Country, (1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2. 1, 2. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 23. <HI>Isai.</HI> 49. 23) (yet these things they will not do) so that in a word of truth, the professed perfection of a seemingly sanctified <HI>Quaker,</HI> is a conscience of obeying his proud lusts, and disobey∣ing Gods inspired Laws.</P>
<P N="2">2. Cease from calling the reverential Presid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s above, the corruptions that are in the World through Lust: for this is to make the fore expres∣sed <HI>precepts</HI> of God, and the <HI>Practises</HI> of his eminent Saints, guilty of these corruptions: but its no new thing, for a <HI>Quaker</HI> boldly to B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as∣pheme.</P>

himself, <HI>John</HI> 5. 44. <HI>How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another.</HI> The other part of the verse (giving light to these words) is usually o∣mitted by them, <HI>sc.</HI> and <HI>seek not the honour that cometh from God only.</HI></P>
<P>Quest. <HI>What is that Honour which cometh from God only?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> The 23<HI>d.</HI> verse tells us. <HI>All men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father; he that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Fa∣ther which hath sent him,</HI> (meaning, to fulfill all righteousness <HI>Mat.</HI> 3. 15.) Its then clear, that the Son of God, is the honour intended above; if any ask, who is this Son of God? the good Angel tells us, <HI>Luk.</HI> 1. 3 5. <HI>That holy thing, which shall be born of thee.</HI> (Mary ver 34.) <HI>shall be called the Son of God:</HI> so then the Man Jesus Christ, is the honour that cometh from God only; which honour the <HI>Jews</HI> (like the <HI>Quakers</HI>) received not, as this Son of God told them <HI>ver.</HI> 43. <HI>I am come in my Fathers Name, and ye receive me not</HI> (sc. by Faith,) hence Christ infers, <HI>ver.</HI> 44. above, <HI>How can ye believe, which receive Honour one of another, and seek not the Ho∣nour which cometh from God only.</HI></P>
<P>Now the Honour which the <HI>Pharisees</HI> received one of another was the Doctrine of Justification, and Eternal Life, by the works and righteous∣ness of the Law, fulfilled in and by the Son of God alone: which righ∣teousness of the Son, is the justifying and saving honour that cometh from God only, to right Believers: will it hence follow, because the proud <HI>Pharisees</HI> took divine honour to themselves, and ther by received honour one of another; therefore civil honour ought not to be given one to another: let me tell you, ye <HI>Quakers</HI> could not have brought a Scrip∣ture more full against your selves: for, under Heaven, there are not a People to be found, that receive more honour one of another, then the men of your <HI>Sect</HI> do: For y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> affirm, and boldly teach, That he who made Heaven and Eearth, Angels, Principalities and Powers, that hath a Name above every Name that is named: King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, the Prince and only Saviour, that gives repentance, and remission of sins, is in each of your vile bodies. Its not to be wondred at, that ye are so possessed with the infernal Spirit of superlative pride against Jesus of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> the man approved of God, and all true Believers on, and lovers of him. So much for some further satisfaction to <HI>William Bul∣lock,</HI> and his <HI>Light making manifest:</HI> The next to him was.</P>
<P><HI>F. E.</HI> He makes another motion, on the behalf of his Cliant (the false Christ, and pretended Saviour within him) <HI>to wit, The blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth us from all sin.</HI> The Text intended by him, is in the 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 1. 7. <HI>And the Blood of Jesus Christ his Son</HI> [His son he left out] <HI>cleanseth us from all sin</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Nor, doth this Text of Scripture, prove the thing for which it
<PB N="47" REF="000313_0051_0FA4AA0DACAB6108"/>
is brought: For, 1. Jesus Christ the Son of God, in this 7<HI>th.</HI> verse▪ is that Word of Life which the Apostles <HI>ver.</HI> 1, 2 had heard and seen with their eyes, and looked upon, and with their hands had handled; who could be no other than the Man <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> which to prove, they bring in the operations of three of their five senses: Now, this Man Jesus Christ the Son of God, as such, he cannot be in a <HI>Quaker.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. By the Blood of this Son of God, is meant the grievous sufferings, pains, and tortures, which he endured on the Cross to the death; and therefore called the <HI>blood of the Cross,</HI> Col. 1. 20. as the Man Jesus Christ, cannot be in a <HI>Quaker,</HI> so consequently, his bloody sufferings cannot be in a <HI>Quaker.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. I at this blood of Christ cleanseth (meaning all right Believers on it) from all sin, <HI>i.e.</HI> from all the pains, and eternal sufferings due to the nature of sin: for (cleansing) here, is the same with washing, in <HI>Rom.</HI> 1. 5 <HI>And from Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness,</HI> that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood, <HI>i. e.</HI> in the sufferings of the Man∣hood of his person: for the former part of the verse, concerns Christs Propetical Office: and the latter part, his Priestly Office, which referred to Christs humane Nature: and for that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea on, the clean∣sing, or washing cannot be within, but without us, <HI>sc.</HI> in Heaven, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10. 19. <HI>Having therefore</HI> Brethren <HI>boldness to enter into the Holiest, by the blood of Jesus:</HI> So then, to be cleansed from all sin by Christs blood, is to be ac∣quitted and justified in the sight of God, from all the deserved miseries of sin, as <HI>Rom.</HI> 5. 8. 9. <HI>But God commendeth his love towards us; in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us: much more then being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath, through him:</HI> And the same Apostle tells us, <HI>Col.</HI> 1 21, 22. <HI>Yet now hath he reconciled; in the body of his flesh through death,</HI> (or through the death of his body of flesh, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10 20.) <HI>To present you holy, and unblamable, and unreprovable in his sight,</HI> (not in our selves) for, <HI>Rom.</HI>4. 5. <HI>He justifieth the ungodly; Abraham</HI> was justi∣fied in the righteousness of Christs person when he had some ungodliness in his own person: a Believer is compleat in Christ bodily, <HI>Col</HI> 2 8, 9, 10. when he hath some incompleatness in his own body. In a word, these things do clear this Truth, Namely, <HI>To be cleansed from all sin by the blood of Jesus Christ,</HI> is to be understood, for a cleansing from all the guilt, and passive fruits and effects of sin: but not for a cleansing (as in your self) from all the movings, and actings of sin in or by us while in this World which the following verses make most plain: for even they which are by the blood of Jesus Christ, cleansed from all sin <HI>ver.</HI> 7. 8. <HI>They have sin,</HI> and in ver 9 <HI>ought to confess their sin:</HI> Now <HI>Francis,</HI> upon the whole it doth appear, that the Patterns cut out by thee, do still come short of

<P>Quest, <HI>Whether the Saints was cleansed from all sin by the water of rege∣neration, or by the blood of justification▪</HI></P>
<P>Thy <HI>Answer</HI> was, <HI>by the Water;</HI> which gave occasion to sundry persons to laugh at him: But he endeavoured to compose them; saying, <HI>it is no laughing matter,</HI> but indeed matter of melting pity, that thy seduced Syna∣gogue of <HI>Libertines,</HI> should be led by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o blind a Seducer.

<P>Hence, (as I suppose) it is, that <HI>George Fox</HI> (in his Folio Book, intitu∣led the <HI>Great Mystery,</HI> page 71.) asserts; <HI>That Christs Nature is not humane, which</HI> (saith he) <HI>is earthly, the nature of the first</HI> Adam.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> I would gladly know of this <HI>Fox,</HI> whether [Humane] doth not rather signifie, a <HI>Man kind nature,</HI> consisting of Soul and Body: Its true we read (1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15. 47. compare <HI>Gen.</HI> 2. 7.) <HI>the first Adam was of the earth earthly,</HI> in regard of his body (not his soul) which God form∣ed out of the Earth. But the word <HI>humane,</HI> comprehends both Soul and Body, which is much more then Earthly, or Earth, Simply, litteral-material Earth.</P>
<P>Again, whereas he adds, <HI>the second man is from Heaven;</HI> To which I Answer:</P>
<P>The second <HI>Adam</HI> (or Man) is the Lord from heaven as above.</P>
<P N="1">1. Because Christs Man kind nature was conceived in <HI>Mary,</HI> by the power of the Highest overshadowing her. <HI>Luk.</HI> 1. 35.</P>
<P N="2">2. The true Christ is stiled the <HI>Second Man,</HI> because the <HI>first Man,</HI> was his figure, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5. 14 likewise in the Geneologie, <HI>Mat.</HI> 1. Christ is said also, to be partaker of the same flesh &amp; blood, that the children were partakers of <HI>Heb.</HI> 2. 14; but the flesh and blood, which the Children were partakers of, were real, visible, humane (or man-kind) flesh and blood (not Mystical, I visible flesh and blood.)</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="000313_0054_0FA4AA0FF9B35108"/>
Besides, this Title, (<HI>sc. The Son of Man</HI>) is frequently attributed to Je∣sus Christ, in the <HI>New-Testament,</HI> as in Mat. 8. 20. <HI>The Foxes have holes, but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head:</HI> also in Mat. 10. 23. &amp; 11. 19. &amp; 12. 8 &amp;c. The Lords Christ is called the Son of Man, which is to shew the truth of his humane-mankind Nature, it being lineally descended from <HI>David,</HI> according to the flesh, and therefore Christ is stiled the Son of <HI>David▪</HI> (<HI>Luk.</HI> 20. 41) Moreover, he hath appella∣tion (of the Son of Man) in reference to his participation with our hu∣mane Nature, in all things which concern created nature, as its stated by the Apostle, in <HI>Heb.</HI> 2. 17. and in Chap. 4 15) <HI>In all things it behoved him</HI> (Christ) <HI>to be made like unto his Brethren:</HI> and he was tempted in all points like as we are, yet without sin: surely he that is in all things like man, except sin, is rightly called the Son of Man: for, sin is not at all the Form, but all the Deformity of Man: The issue is, that the <HI>Fox</HI> hath con∣cealed his craft, putting no difference between the terms. <HI>sc.

<P>Once more; Christ the <HI>Second Man,</HI> is said to be Lord from Heaven, because, he is to restore the heavenly life, which was lost by the first man <HI>Adam:</HI> who was also said to be Earthly, by reason of Transgression; and Christ is also said to be from Heaven, by reason of Restoration. By the first mans fall, all mankind were deprived of all heavenly and spiritual graces: By the second Man from Heaven, the Elect of God have those Graces (in some measure) restored: As <HI>Calvin</HI> in his Exposition, on the (47th. <HI>ver. above</HI>) <Q><HI>Paul</HI> doth not (saith he) speak of the substance of the second Mans body, but of the habit of Graces, and heavenly gifts of the Spirit of Christ: And on the same verse, he affirms, that the <HI>Manichies</HI> were the first knaves, which invented that Heresie, Name∣ly That Christ brought from Heaven an invisible body of flesh and blood into the Womb of the Virgin.</Q> And undoubtedly the <HI>Quakers</HI> have drunk this poison originally from them, by whom the Devil (according to <HI>Calvin</HI>) first set it abroach; which as it was, so still it is, a design from Hell to beget not only a denial, but an utter blotting out of the ve∣ry Name and remembrance (as before) of the true Jesus Christ, and to set up a Spiritual Christ, a Mystical, Invisible, Heavenly King Jesus: and all this only to advance the <HI>Idol-light</HI> within, and the more easily to de∣ceive

<P><HI>Ans.</HI> In the three sold <HI>Querie</HI> above: two things are asserted, (nei∣ther of them, are mentioned in the Scripture of truth.)</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Lord Christ had a two sold Body of flesh and blood: the one internal and invisible, the other, external and visible: and thence con∣cludes, that it is not the external, visible, earthly body, but the internal, invisible, heavenly body, which cleanseth Souls (which he names heaven∣ly things.)</P>
<P N="2">2. That there is an inward spiritual nature (<HI>still the Idol-light within</HI>) which hath mystical flesh and blood, besides the outward earthy nature: the one he calls the flesh and blood of the <HI>vail;</HI> the other, the flesh and blood within the <HI>vail:</HI> All which, he seems to ground upon the Apostles words, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10. 19, 20. <HI>Having therefore Brethrin boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus; by a new and living way, which he hath cones∣crated for us through the vail, that is to say, his flesh.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="000313_0057_0FA4AA13AFC28C18"/>
Note here; The Apostle doth not make any mention of two distinct natures: not of two sorts of flesh and blood, (<HI>sc.</HI> visible and invisible) nor in the least, of two distinct <HI>vails:</HI> Now, that his <HI>jugling cheat</HI> may be discovered, let the Apostles mind be duely considered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whose meaning is, <HI>to wit,</HI> That Believers may draw near to God, through the <HI>vail</HI> of Christs personal flesh and blood: for, we Christians believe (according to the Scriptures of God) that as the <HI>High Priest</HI> entred into the holy place with the blood of the Sacrifice, so the true Christ, <HI>by his own blood entred in once, into the holy place, into heaven it self, now to appear in the presence of God for us.</HI> Heb. 9. 12. 24. the whole is, That the body of Christs flesh and blood, entring into Heaven (the holiest) is that new and living way consecrated for right Believers to draw near to God, for justification through Faith in the one only <HI>vail</HI> of Christs flesh glorified in Heaven above: which precious Truths, are worth nothing, in the account of a <HI>Quaker.</HI></P>

1. That this their Teaching, doth (as much as in them lies) make the Lords Christ a lyar: for we read <HI>Joh.</HI> 9. 35, 36, 37. <HI>Dost thou</HI> (saith Christ to the Man that was born blind) <HI>Believe on the Son of God; he answered and said, who is the Lord, that I might believe on him?

<P><HI>Note,</HI> If our Lord spoke truth here; then he, whom this man both saw and talked with (with his bodily eyes and tongue) was the <HI>Messias,</HI> the <HI>Christ</HI> and <HI>Saviour,</HI> the <HI>Son of God:</HI> and in <HI>Joh.</HI> 4. 25, 26. <HI>The Wo∣man said unto him, I knew that Messias</HI> (our Saviour) <HI>cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things: Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.</HI></P>
<P>Here observe, the Lord Jesus Christ, as of purpose to rebuke this lying Spirit (of a <HI>Qaukers</HI> Mystical' Invisible Flesh and Blood, their Internal saving Christ) doth testifie of himself, that he, who was both seen and heard, by the bodily eyes and ears of the Woman, with whom he con∣versed, was the <HI>Messias,</HI> the true Christ, and Teacher of all things: And in <HI>Mark</HI> 14. 61, 62. <HI>Again the High Priest asked him, and said unto him, art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed? and Jesus said, I am:</HI> here like∣wise the Lord Jesus testified of himself, that he on whom the High-Priest looked, and to whom he spake) was the Christ, the Son of the blessed.</P>
<P>Moreover, <HI>Mat.</HI> 16. 13 <HI>to</HI> 18. the Lord Jesus proposeth two questions to his <HI>Disciples.

<HI>William Harriot,</HI> was (as to the second part of the Charge) the first <HI>Champion</HI> that stood up in defence of their meetings above; saying, <HI>That Paul travelled in birth, till Christ was formed in the Gallatians.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1.

add a little more to the alledged Text above, <HI>Gal.</HI> 4.19. herein <HI>Paul</HI> doth reprove the false Apostles, who had abolished the professed form of Christ in the <HI>Galatians,</HI> and withal devised another form, <HI>Gal.</HI> 6.13. <HI>But they desire to have Circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh:</HI> thus the Se∣ducing Teaching <HI>Quakers,</HI> have learnt their ignorant Disciples, to glory in their own flesh; whereas the blessed Apostle, like a true Gospel Fa∣ther, travelled in birth (<HI>i.e.</HI> spiritually pained and troubled) till Christ was formed, namely, by a through work of Faith in their hearts; that they might truly believe in the righteousness of the Law fulfilled by Jesus Christ of <HI>Nazareth</HI> alone; without Circumcision, or any other work of the Law wrought, is or by themselves, as causal of justification in the sight of God; this being the true mind of the holy Spirit: it can∣not therefore be any advantage to their cause; nor doth it in the least justifie the bold and open wickedness of thee (<HI>O William Harriot</HI>) who didst reflect.

<P><HI>W. Harriot,</HI> I will ask one Question of thee, which if thou canst so∣berly <HI>Answer,</HI> I do assure thee, it shall be seriously considered: the <HI>Que∣ston is this; to wit,</HI></P>
<P>Why shouldest thou not be whipt by the <HI>Christian Magistrate,</HI> for this thy notorious and open Blasphemy? [<ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> For <HI>Nick-naming</HI> the Lords Christ, and our only Saviour, an out side Christ, (an unscriptural phrase) and no Saviour.] the reason of this <HI>Question</HI> is, Because, we read that our blessed Lord Jesus Christ <HI>whipt</HI> sundry persons (honester then thy self, and for a lesser offence) as in <HI>Joh.</HI> 2.13, <HI>to</HI> 17. <HI>And Jesus went up to Jerusalem, and found in the Temple those that sold Oxen and Sheep, and Doves, and the Changers of Money sitting: And when they had made a scourge of small Cords, he drove them all out of the Temple, and said unto them, make not my Fathers house a house of Merchandize.</HI></P>
<P>Do thou now consider, if our Lord Jesus Christ made (at <HI>Jerusalem</HI>) a whip of small Cords, and with it did whip the people, for abusing the Temple, which was but a Type or Figure of the humane or mankind na∣ture of Jesus Christ; which is testified in <HI>ver.</HI> 19, 21. <HI>Destroy this Tem∣ple, and in three Dayes I will raise it up:</HI> But he spake of the Temple of his Body; in which all his Fathers true Worship was to terminate, as it appeareth (by comparing some Scriptures,) the 1 <HI>Kings</HI> 8. 30, 44, 48. <HI>And hearken thou to the supplication of thy Servant, and of thy People Israel

when they shall pray towards this Temple,</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> towards the Temple in <HI>Je∣rusalem;</HI> for the words were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>cred by <HI>Solomon</HI> at the Dedication of the Temple: and in the faith hereof. <HI>Daniel</HI> prayed, <HI>Chap</HI> 6.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0. <HI>His</HI> Win∣dows <HI>being open in his Chamber towards Jerusalem:</HI> and this it was (in those dayes) with every true Believer, in all forreign parts of the word, they did worship the Father (in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Son) with their faces towards the Temple in <HI>Jerusalem:</HI> yea, <HI>Jonah</HI> in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lly of the Fish, <HI>Chap.</HI> 2.4. <HI>Yet I will look again towards thy holy Temple.</HI></P>
<P>Now, if in the judgement of Jesus Christ, the people deserved to be Whipt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or abusing but the shadow of Christs Man-hood, how much more dost thou (<HI>O Will.

<P>The next Prater was, <HI>William Wilkinson:</HI> he repeats some of the Apostles words, <HI>Col.</HI> 1. 27. <HI>Christ in you, the hope of Glory:</HI> which Text they wrest, by forcing this sense upon it, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That Christ in us, is our present glory, and glorious Saviour: I Answered,</P>
<P N="1">1.

<P N="2">2.

of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> as well as of the people <HI>Israel,</HI> Luk. 2. 32. again, the Lords Christ, is called <HI>the Riches of glory, and the unsearchable Riches a∣mong the Gentiles;</HI> who is, said, <HI>ver.</HI> 17. <HI>to dwell in the heart by Faith:</HI> so that the mind of <HI>Paul,</HI> in <HI>Col.</HI> 1. 27. is explained in <HI>Eph.</HI>3. 17. that is to say, Christ in you (by Faith) is the hope of Glory to be revealed, 1 <HI>Pet:</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 1. though it be Christ in you, the <HI>Hope,</HI> yet not the <HI>Merit</HI> of Glory; And therefore <HI>by Christ in you the hope of glory,</HI> we are not to understand either present Glory, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r our glorious Saviour to be in us: Hereupon <HI>F. Eastlack,</HI> shoots this bolt: <HI>to wit,</HI> that the <HI>Deity</HI> was within him, (meaning. that the <HI>Deity</HI> only, was the true Christ and his Saviour;) to which I <HI>Replied,</HI> that the essential general presence of the <HI>Deity,</HI> was in <HI>Cats</HI> and <HI>Dogs,</HI> as well as in him; and therefore if the presence of the Deity only, were the Saviour, it might be so in these, as well as in him: forthwith, he cryed out, saying, <HI>Thou hast spoken Blasphemy:</HI> I told him, that I had not spoken Blasphemy, but good Divinity; and then proved it to be so, by the Testimony of the holy Apostle, <HI>Act.</HI> 17. 24. <HI>God that made the world, and all things; herein, he giveth</HI> ver. 15. <HI>to all, life, and breath, and all things:</HI> here hence I inferr'd, That as the <HI>Deity</HI> was not included in anything, or creature; so nor was it excluded: To which <HI>F.

<P>But for as much as some of the <HI>Quakers</HI> have (as I am informed) since affirmed, <HI>sc.</HI> that <HI>F.

<P>All these <HI>Questions,</HI> are resolved into this one <HI>Position;</HI> namely, that the <HI>Deity</HI> is omnipresent, in all things every where. The <HI>Divine Being</HI> filleth all things and places: for, though he be not circumscribed by any thing that is made, nor limited to any place; yet it is not excluded from any place, creature or thing. <Q>This (saith Mr. <HI>Carils</HI> on <HI>ler.</HI> 23. <HI>above</HI>) is a Mystery which indeed we are not able to comprehend by reason, but we must take it down by Faith, which gives credit to the Word of God, and perswades the heart, that the report therein made is a Truth.</Q> But if any ask, <HI>how the Deity may be said to be every where, and in every thing, and creature that is made?</HI></P>
<P>I Answer, This Mysterious and astonishing Question, with <HI>Augustine, (Epist.</HI> 55. <HI>ad Dard▪</HI>) who affirms. <Q>That the Deity is wholly every where, and in every thing; for the Godhead cannot be divided or parted:
<PB N="63" REF="000313_0067_0FA4AA1F2E2239F8"/>
That it is whole within all things, and whole without all things, no where included no where excluded, containing all things, contained of no∣thing yet not at all mingled with the nature of these things, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> defiled with their pollutions.</Q></P>
<P>There is a Truth in all these Assertions, for the <HI>Deity</HI> is infinite and in∣divisible, and therefore wheresoever the <HI>Deity</HI> is, he is all and altogether, filling all places, creatures and thing in heaven, hell, sea, and earth; as <HI>Psal.</HI> 139 7,8 <HI>Job.</HI> 11 8,9. <HI>Isai.</HI> 43.2.

Hence, 2. <HI>Paul</HI> infers; yea, <HI>Though we have known Christ after the flesh,</HI> i. e. after worldly greatness and honour, creature Pomp and Digni∣ty: in which sense [<HI>Flesh</HI>] is understood in ( 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>6.) <HI>Not many wise men after the flesh, not many Noble, not many Mighty (sc.</HI> after the flesh) <HI>are called:</HI> in this sense, is [<HI>Flesh</HI>] in the alledged Text above, to be understood; as if the Apostle had said, while we were unbelieving Pharises, we expected the <HI>Mesias</HI> to come in external state, earthly Glo∣ry and Majesty: but being now converted to the Faith of Christ, we have laid aside those fleshly thoughts, and apprehensions of Christ, after which, <HI>we know him no more:</HI> this is (as I said) the mind of <HI>Paul,</HI> in re∣ference to Christ after the Flesh (in the Text of Scripture above) it doth not therefore advantage their cause, of an Idol light within, their pre∣tended Christ and only Saviour: I did expect some return from <HI>W.

<P>Then <HI>F.

Here the Apostle reports to us, a great Example of unholy scorn; <HI>sc Ishmael</HI> persecuting <HI>Isaac; Moses</HI> tells us the manner how, and the wea∣pon where with, <HI>Ishmael</HI> did not li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t up his hand against <HI>Isaac</HI> (as <HI>Cain</HI> did against <HI>Abel</HI>) but his tongue: he mocked him, <HI>Gen.</HI> 21.9. reproachful mocking, is one of Satans choice Engines to wound the blessed Gospel at the very heart: even so it is now (saith <HI>Paul</HI> there) and we may now say, even so it is now; that is, they that are born after the Fesh, do per∣secute them that are born after the Spirit (or of God, <HI>Joh.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 13.) who are Believers in the Name of Jesus of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> (ver. 12 <HI>comp.</HI> 45.)

<P><HI>Answ.</HI> I told him, 1. That he had prophanely dismembred that Sa∣cred <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>x</HI> of Scripture, as his Brother <HI>F. E.</HI> had done before him, leav∣ing ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Name of the Lord Jesus, (a Name too hard for them to bear.)</P>
<P N="2">2. That I had already shewed the mind of the Apostle, touching those words: and that it would be a disingenious act, to weary the judicious Hearers with needless repetitions: but he continued clamouro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, query∣ing; <HI>Why they might not be washed, and justified by the Spirit now, as well as others heretofore?</HI></P>
<P><HI>I replied,</HI> That the Spirit as such, never justified any Saint from sin in the sight of God: much less such a one as he was, who never had the Spirit of God in him; he forth with required me to prove that; <HI>to wit,</HI> That he has not the Spirit of God in him which I proved by 3 Arguments.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g.</HI> Was taken from 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.8. <HI>Where are three that bear witness in Earth, the Spirit, and the Water, and the Blood, and these three agree in me:</HI></P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="000313_0070_0FA4AA223A512B30"/>
<HI>But the Spirit that is in thee, doth not agree with the water of Baptism<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, nor blood of the Supper:</HI> (for thou hast renounced both the Sacraments) <HI>therefore the Spirit of God is not in thee.</HI></P>
<P>[Note: though I thus Argued; yet it was not to exclude other im∣plicated respects in this Text of Scripture.]</P>
<P>To which he Replied, saying, <HI>That he had both Baptisme, and the Lords Supper within him:</HI> But I proved the contrary, thus; <HI>Baptisme and the Lords Supper are visible signes, of the invisible efficacy of Christs one Cru∣cified Body; but the visible signes▪</HI> (namely <HI>washing with water in</HI> (or un∣to) <HI>the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, and the Bread and Wine, broken, and given, and poured forth) are not within thee; therefore the Sa∣craments of Baptisme, and the Supper of the Lord are not within thee:</HI> To this he made no Reply.</P>
<P>By the way, let the <HI>Reader</HI> observe, <HI>to wit,</HI> That the Teaching, Sedu∣cing <HI>Quakers</HI> do usually affirm, the true Church Officers, and Ordinan∣ces of Worship, are in God; and that the <HI>Deity</HI> is in them: therefore all these are invisibly in them: being (as they prate) immediately made by the Spirit (<HI>still the Idol-light within</HI>) whence they conclude that Bap∣tisme and the Lords Supper are within them: though their assertions herein, be frequently and most plainly contradicted by themselves: For they maintain and keep up visible Meetings, Officers, Light worship, and Worshippers: and thus by their constant, visible practice they clearly confute themselves, living in contradiction to their own fanciful Principles and being self confuted, they are self-condemned: <HI>How great is this darkness.</HI></P>
<P>Again, here hence it is, That they acknowledge no other Baptisme, then of the Holy Ghost, and of Fire (which makes many of them (as its supposed) so hot, two <HI>Wives</HI>) calling it their internal warmth, and spiritual refreshment: nor no other Lords Supper, than their daily Feasts of fat things, which (as they dare say) feed them with heavenly joyes, glories, and unspeakable delights: often attended with a dissembled kind of <HI>canting-hummings</HI> within: a new kind of charm to seduce the itching ear, and soft head, with unscriptural novelties: so much for their inter∣nal and invisible Sacraments. I pass to the second <HI>Argument.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Arg.</HI> Was taken from <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.16. <HI>The Spirit it self beareth witness with our Spirit, that we are the Children of God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But this holy Spirit doth not bear witness with thy Spirit, that thou art a Child of God:</HI> Therefore, the Spirit of God is not in thee.</P>
<P>He denied the Assumption; which I proved, <HI>The Holy Spirit Witnes∣seth them only to be Gods Children,</HI> which do believe <HI>Jesus Christ of Naza∣reth</HI> to be the true Christ, and their only Saviour, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.26.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="000313_0071_0FA4AA22A46EA518"/>
<HI>But thou dost not believe on Jesus of Nazareth to be the true Christ, and thy only Saviour;</HI> Therefore, <HI>the Holy Spirit doth not bear witness with thy Spirit, that thou art a child of God, and consequently thou hast not the Spirit of God within thee:</HI> To which he made me no Return at all; so that his <HI>staring silence,</HI> gave open consent to the concluded Truth above.</P>
<P>The 3<HI>d. Argument</HI> was thus formed: sc. <HI>He that maketh God the Fa∣ther a Lyar, hath not the Spirit of God in him: but thou makest God the Fa∣ther a Lyar:</HI> This Minor he confidently denied, but I proved it, thus:</P>
<P><HI>He that believeth not the Record, which God gives of his Son, makes him a Lyar,</HI> 1 Joh 5. 10. <HI>But thou believest not the Record, that God gave of his Son.</HI> Therefore, <HI>thou makest God the Father a Lyar:</HI></P>
<P>He denied the Minor Proposition; For (as he said) he believed the Record that God gave of his Son: But I proved the contrary, thus,</P>
<P><HI>The Record that God gives of his Son,</HI> is this, <HI>sc. That Jesus Christ</HI> (as Man) <HI>is the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the World,</HI> Joh. 1. 29,30. with 34 <HI>verse.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But thou dost not believe the Record,</HI> Namely, <HI>That Jesus Christ</HI> (as Man) <HI>is the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the World;</HI> Therefore thou didst not believe the Record, that God gave of his Son: consequently, thou makest God a Lyar, and such Blasphemers have not the Spirit of God in them: here again the Lord stopt his Mouth, that he had not a word to say for himself.</P>
<P>As I was thus Arguing this Truth, (<HI>sc.</HI> That the Spirit of God, was not in this Disputant <HI>W. Wilkinson</HI>) I observed (and O let it never be forgotten) a very old <HI>Quaker</HI> (M. <HI>Henry Smith</HI>) standing upon a Form (o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> some such thing) and looked earnestly and sadly upon me, my very heart being moved towards this poor Seduced Old Man: I forthwith called to him: saying my Soul is grieved for thee, Oh do but consider, what will shortly become of thy unbelieving Soul, which hath professedly forsaken the true Christ and only Saviour from sin and the wrath to come, <HI>Act.</HI> 2. 22 <HI>chap.</HI> 5.31 1 <HI>Thess.</HI> 1.10. <HI>Even Jesus of Nazareth a Man ap∣proved of God among the People, and by him exalted to be a Prince and Savi∣our, to give Repentance and remission of sins.</HI> O with what horror and a∣stonishment, wilt thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> long look the Lamb of God in the face, when he shall charge thee with a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> open denying, yea with renouncing of him before man, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with (perhaps) a causing many others likewise to do the same, its high time for to bet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ink thy self, what Answer thou wilt give to the Lord Christ for this thy dreadful and accursed Apost<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sie, when God shall take away thy Soul: Oh, that thou wouldest seriously think on bles∣sed <HI>Stephen,</HI> (a Man full of the Holy Ghost) when he saw the heavens a∣bove opened, and Jesus the Son of M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n standing there, he called on him,
<PB N="68" REF="000313_0072_0FA4AA238D015498"/>
and said, <HI>Lord Jesus receive my Spirit,</HI> Act. 7. 55,56,59. But alas <HI>poor Old Man!</HI> on whom wilt thou call, to receive thy almost despairing Spi∣rit? thou art not of blessed <HI>Stephens</HI> Faith, who lived, and died in the Faith of Jesus of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> the true Christ, and his only Saviour: O thou poor sinner, that art deluded into another Faith, how d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st thou think to escape the damnation of hell?</P>
<P>As I were thus speaking to him, the Lord undoubtedly took hold on his heart; for though he were a Man of parts, yet he made no reply of any∣thing, which (in real tenderness to his Soul) I had spoken above: but immediately he st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pt down, in a trembling posture, with tears in his eyes, went out of the Church: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> next morning he came to my house, (pre∣tending a troubled Spirit) and after some conference with him, he went civily, away, and (as I hoped) somewhat satisfied: But this visible and invisible hand shaking of God, was soon after forgot by him: and he (according to the divine method of just and secret Judgements) more settled in his long <HI>Runs of whoring from God;</HI> which hath caused me to send a few lines more after <HI>Quakers.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. That ye would be perswaded, wisely to consider that Text of Scrip∣ture, in <HI>Rev.</HI> 6. 15, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which concerns all sorts of Unbelievers, <HI>ver.</HI> 16,17. <HI>Calling to the Mountains and Rocks, fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itteth on the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb: for the great day of his wrath is come, and who shall be able to stand?</HI></P>
<P>O thou deluded one! will it not amaze thee? when thou shalt look up and see, and say; Lo, yonder is Jesus of <HI>Nazareth</HI> the Man approved of God, that I would not have to rule over me, yonder he is indeed: Oh, yonder he comes, he comes! Alas, alas! what shall I do, that am in my sins of impenitency and unbelief, and have no share in him? Look, Oh look, what a glorious train doth attend him: wo is me, Oh wo is me! this Lamb of God (whom poor deluded I, called an out side Christ, no Sa∣viour) Behold he comes lika a <HI>Lion,</HI> tearing in pieces, and none to de∣liver: will not this be a dreadful, most dreadful day to thee indeed, dy∣ing in thy Aposta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ie: I do therefore intreat you, to ponder seriously on this weighty matter, concerning Jesus Christ of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> the Son of <HI>Mary;</HI> that he is now in a present glorified and bodily existence in the third Heaven above, and that he now hath (though denied by <HI>Socinians</HI> and <HI>Quakers</HI>) in the Heavens above, true flesh and blood, the nature and properties of a true mankind body; which Mr. <HI>Doolittle</HI> plainly proves, by propounding (in the <HI>Young-man's Instructor</HI>) four Questions.</P>
<Q><P N="1">1. <HI>Quest.</HI> Had not Christ a real humane, mankind body, when he a∣rose out of the Grave; forasmuch as he shewed the prints of the nailes in his hands and feet to <HI>Thomas,</HI> Joh.20.27, surely, this cannot be denied with any colour of reason.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="69" REF="000313_0073_0FA4AA242A9DE1B0"/>
2. <HI>Quest.</HI> Did he not ascend with the same body, or had he not the same body when he was parted from his Disciples; forasmuch as they saw the same body, go up, that talked with them, <HI>Act.</HI> 1.9,10,11. No man can deny this, with whom the Scriptures of truth, have either Au∣thority or Credit.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Quest.</HI> Can you say, that Christ put off his body, after he was ta∣ken out of sight before he came into heaven; or if you should say it, doth any Scripture favour you herein? neither <HI>Socinian, Quaker,</HI> or any other to this day, ever produced (nor can) any such Scripture: For <HI>Stephen</HI> saw Christs humane body since in Heaven above. <HI>Act.</HI> 7.55,56.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Quest.</HI> Or can you tell, that Christ put off his body, since he came to Heaven, and <HI>Stephen saw him there:</HI> I am (said he) most sure, that you can tell no such thing; for the testimony of the holy Angels is a∣gainst it, for they did assure the Disciples, that the same Jesus that they saw ascend, should be so seen to come again, <HI>Act.</HI>1.9,10,11.</P></Q>
<P>And will not these four things, put you out of doubt, <HI>sc.</HI> that Christ hath the same body now, that he had upon the earth: Oh, how great is the ground of a true Christians comfort, that the same person that died for us, is thus sate down at the right hand of God: aad that there we have the same Jesus interc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eding for us in heaven: on the other side is it not matter of dread and terror to the wicked (both in practice and judg∣ment) that still continue to oppose an exal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed Christ, and prefer their base Lusts and Errors before this glorious Lord Jesus.</P>
<P>The second part of the charge being fully ended, <HI>W. Wilkinson</HI> called on me, to make Good the third part of the Charge. <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P><HI>That the Prime Pinciples of a Quaker, are the same which were held and professed by the Beasts, that</HI> Paul <HI>fought with at</HI> Ephesus.</P>
<P>Which I thus Argued:</P>
<P>It appears by the manifold Arguments, which the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> used towards the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> 1 Cor Chap. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>5▪ to prove the Resurrection of Christs body from the dead, and the bodies of the Saints by him: now their <HI>Principles</HI> were these <HI>to wit,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. That the body of Christ was not raised from the dead (and conse∣quently he is not Jesus, a Saviour)</P>
<P N="2">2. That no Mans body shall be raised from the dead, (and consequent∣ly, Christ shall not be the riser of the dead.)</P>
<P>The first of these the Apostle confutes, <HI>in Chap. above, ver.</HI> 3,4. <HI>For I declared unto you first of all, that which I received: how that Christ died for our sins, according to the</HI> Scriptures: <HI>And that he was buried, and that he rose again</HI> the third day, <HI>according to the</HI> Scriptures.</P>
<P>And the second likewise, in <HI>ver.</HI> 13,14,15. <HI>&amp;c. But if there be no Resur∣rection
<PB N="70" REF="000313_0074_0FA4AA259A24BBD8"/>
of the dead, then is Christ not risen; And if Christ be not risen, we are found false witnesses of God, because we have testified of God, that he raised up Christ, whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.</HI></P>
<P>Here hence <HI>Paul</HI> infers, <HI>ver.</HI> 32. <HI>If after the manner of men, I have fought with Beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not; let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.</HI></P>
<P>As if the Apostle he I said, fit must be with our Bodies, as with Beasts after <HI>Death,</HI> then it would be best for us to <HI>Live</HI> as Beasts in our Time of Life; intimating that there resolves and desires is to live in Brutish lust &amp; pleasures, these are the most predominate motives that perswaded them to deny and oppose the Resurrection of the dead; which opposition I charged upon the <HI>Quakers</HI> then present: To which,</P>
<P><HI>William Wilkinson</HI> replyed, saying <HI>Shew us an express Scripture which saith, That the Beasts which</HI> Paul <HI>fought with at</HI> Ephesus, <HI>denyed the Resur∣rection of the Dead.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I answered,</HI> 1. It was plainly implyed in that <HI>Text</HI> of Scripture: and it doth evidently concenter therein: Besides, in reason, there is nothing that could be the ground or occasion of this Fight (or violent contention) between <HI>Paul</HI> and these <HI>Brutish</HI> disputants, but the Doctrine of the Re∣surrection.</P>
<P N="2">2. I gave him the liberty to put his own interpretation upon the words (in <HI>vers.</HI> 32. above) To which he made no reply at all. Let me here add, It is more then probable, that the Beasts <HI>Paul</HI> fought with at <HI>Ephe∣sus,</HI> were the same <HI>persons</HI> (or of the same <HI>beastly</HI> perswasion) which, in other places opposed <HI>Paul'</HI>s Doctrines, of Faith in Jesus, and the Resur∣rection of the Dead. As in <HI>Athens,</HI> Act. 17. 18. <HI>Then certain Philoso∣phers of the</HI> Epicurians (whom <HI>Calvin</HI> on the <HI>Text</HI> calls <HI>Beasts) encounte∣red him; and some said, What will this babler say; othersome, He seemeth to be setter forth of strange gods, because he preacheth unto them Jesus and the Resurrection; at which some mocked, vers.</HI> 23.</P>
<P>And in the beginning of this 19. <HI>Chap. (vers.</HI> 1,2,3.) We read, that <HI>Paul</HI> went into the Synagogue of the <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Thessalonia,</HI> and three Sab∣bath dayes reasoned with the <HI>Jews</HI> out of the Scripture, <HI>Opening and alledg∣ing, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead: And that this Jesus whom I preach unto you is Christ</HI></P>
<P>But what was the issue; the 4. <HI>vers</HI> tells us, sc: <HI>Some of the Jews be∣lieved of the devout Greek, a great multitude and of the chief Women, not a few:</HI> but the (5. vers) inform<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, <HI>That othersome of the hearers believed not; moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a Company, and set all the City on an uproar</HI> (against <HI>Paul,</HI> be∣cause he preached Jesus and the Resurrection) Therefore (10.) <HI>The
<PB N="71" REF="000313_0075_0FA4AA25AA441D38"/>

<P>But when the <HI>Jews (vers.</HI> 13.) of <HI>Thessalonia (i.e.</HI> the lewd followers of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> baser sort of the <HI>Jews. vers.</HI> 5▪) <HI>had knowledge that the Word of God was preached of Paul at</HI> Berea, <HI>they came thither also, and stirred up the People, then immediatly the Brethren sent</HI> Paul <HI>away</HI> (vers. 14.) <HI>and they that conducted him, brought him to</HI> Athens (vers. 15.) In the next Chap∣ter <HI>(<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h.</HI> 18 1.) we read, <HI>That</HI> Paul <HI>departed from</HI> Athens, <HI>and come to</HI> Corinth: <HI>And he</HI> (vers. 4.) <HI>reasoned in the synagogue very Sabbath. and perswa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d the Jews and Greeks</HI> (namely to believe in Jesus and the Resur∣rection, as in all places afore expressed) but when he was hero also op∣posed (<HI>vers.</HI> 6.) <HI>He departed thence, and sail<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d into</HI> Syria (vers. 18.) <HI>and became to</HI> Ephesus (vers. 19) <HI>and entered into the synagogue, and rea∣soned with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Though some perhaps might believe his Doctrines, because it is said (<HI>ver.</HI> 20) <HI>He was desired to tarry a longer time with them:</HI> Yet it is very probable that he was there opposed by some others, (as at <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> above) either at this, or some other time: And according to his <HI>first Epistle</HI> to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> giveth them an account of it (ch.15. 32.) Now, if the Beasts therein mentioned, were not the same individu∣al person, yet they were specifically the same (<HI>i.e.</HI> of the same Malig∣nant quality and rotten judgement) with those lewd fellows of the baser (or more bruitish) sort; which in Act. 17.5, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> above so strongly deni∣ed and opposed, Jesus of <HI>Nazareth</HI> to be the true Christ and only Saviour with the Resurrection of the dead, upon the whole: ye Teaching, Sedu∣cing <HI>Quakers</HI> may run and read in the Scriptures of God, what lewd and base fellows have been (according to the testimony of the holy Spirit of truth) your Predecessors, and of your bruitish Principles: <HI>sc.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Denying Jesus Christ of <HI>Nazareth</HI> to be the true Christ, and our only Saviour.</P>
<P N="2">2. Denying the Resurrection of the dead. As to the last of these, <HI>F. Eastlack</HI> said. We do not deny the Resurrection of the dead I demand∣ed of him, whether they did believe, that the same body that dies shall rise a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. He readily Replied, saying, <HI>We do not beli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve the resurrection of the same body that dies:</HI> how then (said I) do you grant the resurre∣ction of the dead? if the same body that died shall not rise again: Is not this, plainly to deny, what ye grant: for, if it be another body that is raised from the dead, then its not the same body that died: nay, it must be a raising of a body from the dead, that never died: these absurdities must unavoidably follow: Nay furthermore, if it be not the resurrection of the same body that died.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="000313_0076_0FA4AA2697C41F28"/>
It cannot be called a Resurrection, but a new Creation, which is altoge∣ther (in effect) to deny the resurrection of the dead; and so a plain self contradiction.</P>
<P>Next <HI> W. Bullock</HI> appeared telling us, that the same body which dies, shall not rise again, alle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ging these words: <HI>It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.</HI></P>
<P>I Replied, 1. That the Words repeated by him, were in, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15. 44. and withal, the Apostle saith not, that the body shall be raised a Spirit, but Spiritual; as Christs body of flesh and bones, after the Resurrection, was Spiritual, but not a Spirit: for Christ assured his Disciples, that his body was not changed into a Spirit; <HI>Behold and see, for a Spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have,</HI> Luk. 24. 39. <HI>It is the same true and real body which is presented to you,</HI> saying, <HI>It is I my self.</HI> Now, as it was with Christs bo∣dy raised from the dead, so it shall be with our body (as to the substantial sameness) after the Resurrection, inasmuch as the Resurrection of Christs body is made a pledge of our Resurrection, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 14. <HI>And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.</HI> Again, <HI>But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that slept,</HI> 1 Cor. 15. 20.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is raised a Spiritual Body, because then the body shall have no need of natural helps, of which a natural body stands in need of, as sleep, meat, rayment, but a spiritual body needs them not, this is the judge∣ment of all orthodox Authors: Christ told the <HI>Sadduces</HI> (who said <HI>there is not Resurrection</HI>) That after the Resurrection, <HI>Mat.</HI> 22.39. <HI>They neither Marry nor are given in Marriage, but are as the Angels in Heaven▪</HI> Christ doth not say, that they shall be Angels, or that their bodies shall be chan∣ged into the nature of Angels: but as Angels (or Angelical) in respect of qualifications; in like manner the body shall be raised spiritual, but not a Spirit.</P>
<P><HI>Francis Eastlack</HI> stood up again, and boldly said, That the Scripture saith, it shall not be the same body at the Resurrection; and forthwith called to me for the Bible which was in my hand, he turned to the 1. <HI>Cor. Chap.</HI> 5. and read the 36,37,38. <HI>verses.</HI></P>
<P><Q>Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened except it dye▪ and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be but bare grain; but God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.</Q></P>
<P>I Answered, That the last words [<HI>sc. To every seed his own body</HI>] do shew, that it is the same body for substance, which was sowen; but not for qualities:</P>
<P><HI>F. Eastlack</HI> Replied, saying, The Scripture saith, it is not the same
<PB N="73" REF="000313_0077_0FA4AA274D713D08"/>
body, but thou sayeft it is the same body; I told him, what I had said, the same Texts of Scripture do (in effect (say, <HI>sc.</HI> Though it be not same body for Qualities, yet it is the same body for Substance: as a piece of Plate of the old fashion, being call into a mould of the newest fashion, is the same for substance, but not for qualities: Wool died in a Scarlet co∣lour, is the same wool for substance as it was before, but not for qualities: and withal I told him, if he would not admit of a distinction, how then could he reconcile these Scriptures to his understanding <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>God repents and he repents not: God tempts no man, yet God tempted Abraham: Reprove a Fool in his folly, and reprove not a fool in his folly: I and my Father are one, and the Father is greater then I,</HI> to which he made no Answer, nor quarell'd Distinctions any more.</P>
<P>As for the similitude of <HI>Corn</HI> and <HI>Grain,</HI> mentioned in the verses above, I shall answer with Reverend Mr. <HI>Caril:</HI> <Q>It is (saith he) very true, that the Corn or Grain which is sowed, doth not arise again in that man∣ner, or after that quality or likeness in which it was cast into the ground: we sow bare Seed, but when it comes up again it comes with a stalk, and an ear, and shoots up in much greeness and beauty: there is a great difference between a grain of wheat in the bushel, and a flourishing stem, or ear of Corn in the field: God gives it another body in the growing up, but yet it is still a body, and there is the same nature in it still, and the same substance of the grain remains still; only there is an addition of beauty and greenness when it is risen and grown up: so the Body that is cast into the Ground, is like a [<HI>bare</HI>] grain: it is cast in a bare (or naked) body, but when it shall be raised again, the body shall have many beautiful and glorious additions: so that in the Resurrection there will be an adding of somewhat to that which was before; the Corn grows up, with somewhat that it bad not, but it doth not lose any thing that it had: tis still a garin of wheat and be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter, so the body laid down in the Grave, is raised, not the same in all things, but better in many things added: Now the excellent endowments and qualifications added to the body, cannot work a loss or an annihilation of the frame or dispo∣sition of corporial parts and members,</Q> so much for Mr. <HI>Caril,</HI> upon the 1 Cor. 15. 36,37,38 <HI>verses.</HI></P>
<P>I shall now consider the last Text of Scripture, which was by <HI>F. E.</HI> re∣peated, <HI>to wit:</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Cor. 15. 30. <HI>That flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdome of God;</HI> Therefore, the same body that dies shall not rise again.</P>
<P><HI>I Answered</HI> 1. That the <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cintans</HI> (your Brethren and fellow Adversa∣ries of the truth) do urge this Text of Scripture, to confirm their asser∣tions against Christ and the Resurrection of the same body; <HI>to wit.</HI> that
<PB N="74" REF="000313_0078_0FA4AA27EE3BAD98"/>
Christ hath not now flesh and blood, nor the nature and properties of a true Mankind body; this hath been afore propounded and confuted: a∣gain (they say, as ye do) <HI>How can the body arise of flesh, when the Apostle saith, Flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God; if no flesh shall inherit the Kingdom of God, how can it be affirmed that the same true flesh shall be raised to enter upon that inheritance</HI> (perhaps this improvement he had forgot.</P>

<P N="3">3. That by <HI>Flesh</HI> and <HI>Blood</HI> (in that place of Scripture above) is not meant the substance of <HI>Flesh</HI> and <HI>Blood;</HI> the parts of a Man's body (as now it is) But it is to be understood of the sinfull qualities of Man's Na∣ture (that are to be done away) as in other places, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7. 18,24.

<P>I Have been earnestly Requested by some of the Lords People in these <HI>Islands,</HI> to make some Replies to three or four <HI>Erroneous Principles</HI> (not Discussed in the <HI>Disputation</HI>) Held and Professed by most <HI>Quakers: To wit,</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>That there is a state of perfect freedome from sin in this Life.</HI></ITEM>

<ITEM>4. <HI>The denying of the Trinity:</HI> sc. <HI>three persons in one Deity.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>These corrupt <HI>Principles</HI> maintained by most Teaching <HI>Quakers,</HI> I have (on Request as above) considered, and made some <HI>Replies</HI> to each parti∣cular distinctly, as in their order afore expressed.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="principle">
<P N="1">1. Principle. <HI>That there is a state of perfect freedome from sin, in this Life; Alledging that the Scriptures do testifie the same:</HI> as Job 1. ver. 1,8,22. Psal. 37, ver. 37. <HI>&amp;</HI> 39. 1. <HI>&amp;</HI> 119. 5. Mat. 5. 48. Rom. 6. 18. <HI>&amp;</HI> 8. 4. <HI>&amp;</HI> 2. 15. Phil. 3. 15. Eph. 3. 19. Luk. 1. 6.</P>
<P>That I might herein give some satisfaction, I have considered the above∣mentioned Scriptures, one after another in their asserted Order.</P>
<P>The first Scripture, <HI>Job</HI> 1. <HI>ver.</HI> 1,8,22. <HI>There was a Man whose Name was Job, and that man was perfect.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply</HI> to the 1 <HI>st. verse.</HI> By <HI>Perfect</HI> here, we are not to understand a <HI>Legal</HI> perfection, such as <HI>Adams</HI> before the Fall; though it be contended for by the Teaching <HI>Quakers,</HI> and affirmed by them, as possibly attainable, yea, actually attained by many of their <HI>Friends</HI> in this Life: but the <HI>Spi∣rit</HI> doth not in any one of these verses, express (no, nor intend) <HI>Job<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> perfection from all sin in this life: nor did <HI>Job</HI> so understand it, witness his own confessions, <HI>Chap.</HI> 9. 20. <HI>If I justifie my self, my own mouth shall condemn me: if I say.

sin:</HI> likewise in <HI>Chap.</HI> 42. 6. <HI>Wherefore I abhor my self, and repent in dust and ashes:</HI> but to put the word <HI>Perfect,</HI> in <HI>ver.</HI> 1. out of all doubt, it is explained in the 8<HI>th. vese</HI> above, <HI>There was none like him in the Earth, a perfect and an upright man:</HI> which referred to that Generation in which <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> lived.

<P>And as for the 22<HI>d. verse. In all this Job sinned not.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> These words are not to be taken in a <HI>Quakers</HI> sense (as if <HI>Job</HI> had been at any time without sin in this world) for, in the 11<HI>th verse.</HI> he (<HI>Job will curse thee to thy face:</HI> Satan was confident that <HI>Job</HI> would Blas∣pheme, by cursing God to his face: this Satan did promise to himself, and did undertake with God; which plainly interprets the words, <HI>sc.

<P><HI>Obj.</HI> If any of you say, as some Teaching <HI>Quakers</HI> have said: <HI>sc. That it was in the time of Jobs affliction,</HI> when he said; <HI>If I say that I am perfect, it will prove me perverse;</HI> but after his deliverance he was perfect without sin?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> This is wholly false: for the character given of <HI>Job, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> a per∣fect man,</HI> was before his affliction; for Gods commending of him (as perfect and upright) was the occasion of the Devils desiring leave of God to afflict him, and of Gods grant, <HI>ver.</HI> 12. that his Word might be found true: upon the whole, observe in <HI>Job,</HI> Chap. 25. <HI>ver.</HI> 4. <HI>How then can Man be justified with God, or can he be clean, that is born of a Woman.</HI> This <HI>Question,</HI> carrieth a strong denial, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> it cannot possibly be, or it is impossible to be: as if <HI>Job</HI> had said, do but acknowledge that any one is born ordinarily of a Woman, and we may conclude him to be sinful and unclean, with (or in the sight of) God.</P>
<P>Second Scripture, <HI>Psal.</HI> 37. <HI>ver.</HI>37. <HI>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rep. Upright,</HI> in the latter clause, doth interpret, perfect, in the for∣mer, so then the perfect man, is the upright or sincere hearted man; we read in <HI>Jacobs</HI> character, <HI>Gen.</HI> 25. 27. and <HI>Jacob</HI> was a plain man; this
<PB N="79" REF="000313_0082_0FA4AA2BA403B230"/>
phrase <HI>plain man</HI> here, is the same wite <HI>perfect man</HI> in the Text above: a <HI>plain man</HI> and a <HI>perfect man</HI> (in a Scriptural account) are convertible terms, 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 29.9, 27. and do signifie, a man that hath not a heart and a heart, or a double minded man, <HI>Jam.</HI> 1. 8. not a compound man, speak∣ing one thing and meaning another: It is also the same word, that is gi∣ven to <HI>Noah,</HI> Gen. 6. 9. <HI>He was perfect in his Generation,</HI> or he was found, upright, plain hearted with God: And it is that God spake to <HI>Abraham, Gen.</HI> 17. 1. <HI>Walk before me and be thou perfect;</HI> or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound, upright, plain, in thy walking before me: now, though <HI>Job, Noah, Jacob, Abraham,</HI> are said to be <HI>perfect;</HI> yet it is not to be found in the Scriptures, that God ever said of all, or any one of them (or of any other meer Saint) they were <HI>perfect</HI> without sin in this world: but the contrary is (as may after∣wares appear) often found in Holy Writ: forasmuch as it is sincerity (or the Law written in the heart, <HI>Psal.</HI> 40. 8.) which is the only Gospel Perfection.</P>
<P>Third Scripture, <HI>Psal.</HI> 39. 1. <HI>I said, I will take heed to my wayes, that I sin not with my tongue:</HI> compare with Jam. 3. 2. <HI>If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply,</HI> Though <HI>David</HI> heedfully endeavoured circumspection; not to offend with his tongue, yet he sinned with it, Psal. 116. 11. <HI>I said in my haste all men are Lyars:</HI> yea frequently did he offend with his tongue, in and about the matter of <HI>Uriah</HI> the <HI>Hittite.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Might it be supposed, that <HI>David</HI> sinned not with his tongue, yet he might sin in thought; although, it be most true, which the Apostle <HI>James</HI> speaks above, <HI>sc. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply,</HI> 1.

<P>And thus <HI>Moses</HI> (by way of supposition) said unto the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> Lev. 18. 5. <HI>which [If] a man do, he shall live in them:</HI> here <HI>Moses</HI> proposeth an unlikely, yea, an impossible practice, under the word [<HI>If</HI>] <HI>which if a man do</HI> (But where is the Man, that can do the law of God, as ex∣actly as he commands it to be done) implying, there's not such a man to be

<P><HI>Reply,</HI> 1. The 10<HI>th verse</HI> above, <HI>sc.

<P N="2">2. As to the words alledged out of the 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3. 9. <HI>Whosoever is born of God, doth not commit sin:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> 1. If the words should be understood in the <HI>Quakers</HI> sense a∣bove asserted: then the new birth would exclude the being of sin, in all the born of God: for the new birth agrees to them all, to one as well as to another; as the reason given in the same verse doth testifie: <HI>Because his seed remaineth in him, and he cannot sin, because he is born of God:</HI> now the seed remains in all the born of God, as well as in any: well then, it must be meant of all Saints, or none: Now, if the Teaching <HI>Quakers</HI> should be so stark mad, as to affirm all Saints to be free from sin, the Scripture a∣bove, 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 1. 8. will reprove their madness: for, <HI>if we</HI> (who are the re∣al Saints, and born of God) <HI>say, that we have no sin, we deceive our selves, and the truth is not in us:</HI> all men may see, that these words were spoken of and by such Saints, as had, <HI>ver.</HI> 3. fellowship with the Father, and his Son Jesus Christ: and yet they have certified, <HI>sc. if that we say, that we have no sin, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> That the words in 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3. 9. cannot be meant of freedome from the nature and being of sin, in the born of God, but only of the Trade and Custome of sinning which is explained in the foregoing 8<HI>th verse For the Devil sinneth from the beginning, i. e.</HI> he hath never ceased to sin since he began, it hath ever been his trade or customary way; thus to sin, the born of God cannot, for the course and custome of sin being bro∣ken, there's not now such a free correspondency between the Soul and Sin, as before Regeneration: this is the Character of the unregene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate, <HI>They cannot cease to sin,</HI> 2 Pet. 2. 14. But so the born of God sinneth not, (<HI>i. e.</HI> without cessation,) inasmuch as he is daily pleading (in his prayers) against sin, desiring strength, not only against, but victory over it: thus it was with <HI>Paul,</HI> Rom, 7. 24. <HI>O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from this body of death,</HI> sc. from this burden and bondage of inherent sin∣ful corruption; yea, all this, after he was most truly the born of God: It is therefore a manifest wresting of the above mentioned Texts, (sc. 1 John 1. 10. in forcing them to say, <HI>that the born of God sinned, before they were in the new birth, but not after it.</HI></P>
<P>The tenth Scripture, <HI>Eph.</HI> 3. 19. <HI>That ye might be filled with all the ful∣ness of God:</HI> which (some say) excludes the being of sin in Saints.</P>
<P><HI>Reply,</HI> 1. The phrase [<HI>Fulness</HI>] is to be expounded by a distinction, there being a double fulness; namely, of <HI>Parts</HI> and <HI>Degrees:</HI> for the first of these, we read, <HI>Act.</HI> 7. 55. <HI>But he</HI> (Stephen) <HI>being full of the Holy Ghost;</HI> this Respects the fulness of parts only, that is, he had some∣thing

thing of every Grace, though not a perfection of any Grace; An Infant may be said to be a perfect man, as it hath a perfection or fulness of parts, but not of growth and degrees.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The fulness of God,</HI> in respect of <HI>Degrees,</HI> is to be had only in Hea∣ven above; And even there, the <HI>Apostle</HI> intends not equality (but quali∣ty) of fulness: that is, a divine and glorious fulness of or from God: so then the fulness of God above expressed, is to be understood of a ful∣ness (not on Earth, but) in Heaven, which is the proper import of that place of Scripture: for, the Apostle prayes, that they [<HI>Might</HI>] be fil∣led, &amp;c. And so they should be in Heaven, but he asserts not, that either they were, or should be so filled in this life: the person is, because here, we know but in part, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13. 9, 22. <HI>For now we see through a Glasse darkly, but then face to face, now, I know in part, but then I shall know, even as I am known:</HI> Therefore, <HI>the fulness of God</HI> above, doth not exclude the being of sin in this life.</P>

<P><HI>Reply,</HI> The word [<HI>Blameless</HI>] doth not (as the <HI>Quakers</HI> would have it) signifie [<HI>Sinless</HI>] before the Lord, but <HI>Rebukeless</HI> before men, in this World, no man can be so <HI>blameless,</HI> as to be <HI>sinless</HI> in the sight of God; 'tis true, we read, <HI>Numb.</HI> 23.21.<HI>He hath not seen iniquity in Jacob,</HI> that is, not with an eye of revenge, but pity: God saw iniquity in <HI>Jacob</HI> his people, but not so as to destroy them, which was the unwearied design &amp; desire of <HI>Balack</HI> the Princes of <HI>Moab,</HI> ver. 17. in which sense, the not seeing of iniquity in <HI>Jacob,</HI> is only meant.</P>

<P><HI>Obj.</HI> Here the <HI>Quaker</HI> will be apt to say, <HI>But there is no sin charged upon</HI> Elizabeth; <HI>so that she might be perfect without sin?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> 1. The phrase [<HI>Blameless</HI>] (on which the <HI>Quaker</HI> puts his whole stress) may refer to an Unbeliever, yea, to a perfect for of Jesus Christ of <HI>Nazareth, Phil.</HI> 3.6. <HI>Touching the righteousness which is in the Law, Blameless;</HI> even then, when <HI>Paul</HI> was <HI>graceless,</HI> he was <HI>blameless:</HI> this I have only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oted by way, that <HI>Teaching Quakers</HI> may plainly see, that the word [<HI>Blameless</HI>] simply in its own nature, will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> far from proving <HI>perfection</HI> of Grace that it will not prove any truth of Grace.</P>
<P N="2">2. It will not therefore follow that <HI>Elizabeth</HI> was perfect without sin, because there is no mention made of her sin; let it be will observed, that in the 6<HI>th verse</HI> above, <HI>They are both said to be righteous and blameless,</HI> even then when the best or them both, was guilty of actual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: now, if the expressions of <HI>Righteous</HI> and <HI>Blameless,</HI> were applicable to <HI>Zecharias,</HI> when he was under sin; then the same expressions (<HI>sc.</HI> of <HI>Righteous</HI> and <HI>Blameless</HI>) will not argue her to be more free from sin then her Husband, there being the same reason for the one, as for the other: to deny this, were to destroy the rules of right reasoning; besides, death took hold of her, as well as of him, <HI>which is the wages of sin,</HI> Rom. 6. 23.</P>
<P N="3">3. If the Term <HI>Blameless,</HI> should prove <HI>Zecharias</HI> and <HI>Elizabeth</HI> (in their life time) <HI>sinless,</HI> or perfect without sin, it would prove the Scrip∣tures of God <HI>sinful,</HI> (which to assert were Blasphemy,) for the Holy Scriptures do utterly deny such a <HI>blamelesness,</HI> or freedome from sin in Mortals; As in <HI>Eccless,</HI> 7. 20. <HI>For there is not a just man upon the Earth, that doth good and sinneth not:</HI> that is, that sinneth not in doing good; the Spirit doth say simply, that there is not a just man, that sinneth not, but a just man that doth good, and sinneth not: intimating, that in our most religious Actions, there is some mixture of sin; hence the Prophet, <HI>Isai.</HI> 64 6. <HI>That all our Righteousness is as filthy rags;</HI> Noting to us, that no righteous work of ours is so pure but there is some taint, and filth of sin cleaving to it, which without a Mediator (in the rigor of the Law) would be damnable: so then, though the action (as to the matter) be not sinful yet there is some sin in the Action: this difference is exprest, <HI>Exod.</HI> 28 38 where the <HI>High Priest,</HI> is said, <HI>to hear the iniquity of the holy things;</HI> holy things in the matter of them, yet iniquity in the manner of performing them, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7. 18. <HI>How to perform that which is good I find not:</HI> here hence it is, that we read, 1 <HI>King.</HI> 8.46. <HI>If they sin against thee, for there is no man that sinneth not:</HI> and again, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI>6.36. <HI>For there is no man that sinneth not:</HI> whence the <HI>Apostle James,</HI> Chap. 3. 2. <HI>For in many things me offend all:</HI> he saith, We, including himself, though an eminent Saint, and an

Whereas they say, <HI>The written Scriptures are not the Word of God:</HI> if thereby they mean the Scriptures, as expressed by humane tongues, or as written, or printed with ink and paper by the art of the Writer, or Printer; if so considered, we do not affirm the Scriptures to be the Word of God: But as the <HI>Written Scriptures</HI> do declare the mind of God to us, so the matter therein contained, is the declarative Word of <HI>G</HI>od: as in <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b.</HI> 1,2. <HI>God who at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unary times, and in divers manners, spake in times past unto the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in these last dayes spoken to us by his Son.</HI></P>
<P>Qu. <HI>What hath the Son of God spoken, touching the</HI> Scriptures?</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> He tells us, that the Scripture is the Word of <HI>G</HI>od, <HI>Mark</HI> 7. 13. <HI>Making the Word of God of none effect.</HI> Here the Son of <HI>G</HI>od, calls the fifth Commandment (in the written Scriptures) the Word of <HI>G</HI>od, and in <HI>John</HI> 2.22. <HI>They believed the Scripture, the word which Jesus had said.</HI> Also <HI>Joh.</HI> 10. 34,35. <HI>And Jesus answered them, It is written in your Law, I said, ye are Gods: if he called them Gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the Scripture cannot be broken.</HI> Note, in these Texts, our Lord and only Saviour Jesus Christ the Son of <HI>G</HI>od affirms that the Word of <HI>G</HI>od, is the Scripture, and that the Scripture is the Word of <HI>G</HI>od, as being convertible terms; that is, what is truely and properly spoken of the one▪ is also spoken of the other▪ for so it is with all propositions con∣vertible.</P>
<P>Moreover▪ 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. 16. <HI>All Scripture is given by Inspiration of God, and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Instruction in Righteousness:</HI> that is, in the Righteousness both of Faith, and Life: And therefore as the Scripture is the Word of <HI>G</HI>od, so likewise it is the infallible standing Rule of Faith and Life.

it being evidently so: I need not stay, to shew you the excellency of any part of the Scripture, having pointed you at such an original of the whole, which adviseth you seriously to consider, what the Lord speaks to all such as they are: we read, <HI>Numb.</HI> 15. 30 <HI>The Soul that doth ought presumptu∣ously</HI> (whether he be born in the Land, or a stranger) <HI>the same reproach∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th the Lord:</HI> O how highly do you Teaching <HI>Quakers</HI> reproach the Lord, when you deny the Scriptures to be the Word of God) <HI>that Soul shall be cut off from the people</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, but mark the ground and reason of it: <HI>Because he hath despised the Word of God,</HI> ver. 3 1. <HI>and hath broken his com∣mandments:</HI> Note here, that the Lord concludes his word, and written Commandments to be one and the same thing, and thereupon the Lord passeth this heavy Sentence; <HI>That Soul shall be utterly cut off, his iniquity shall be upon him:</HI> i. e. It shall never be forgiven him, (except God in mer∣cy grant repentance for and from these dead works,) O ye <HI>Quakers,</HI> are you not herein, worse then the <HI>Egyptian-Heathens:</HI> for they believed the Word spoken to them by <HI>Moses,</HI> to be the Word of God, <HI>Exod.</HI> 9. 20. <HI>He that feared the Word of the Lord amongst the Servants of pharaoh, made his Servants and his Cattle to flie into the Houses:</HI> howbeit, they will think themselves either wronged or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eared, if their Arguments be not con∣sidered.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Argument,</HI> That which is the Word of God, dwells within, <HI>Cel.</HI> 3. 16. <HI>Let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdome:</HI> whereas that which you (meaning Christians) call the word, is the Scripture without.</P>
<P><HI>Reply,</HI> 1. Is there any word asserted to be the word of Christ, but the written word of Truth, whereof Christ is both the Author and Subject, if there be, when it shall be shewen, it will be considered.</P>
<P N="2">2 The very phrase [<HI>Let</HI>] <HI>the Word of Christ dwell in you,</HI> denotes, that the Apostles words, are an Exhortation to get the Matter contained in the very Letter of the word of Christ: that it might dwell richly in them getting be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> acquaintance with the matter contained in the letter of the word of Christ, and that richly, <HI>sc.</HI> still increasing therein, that they might thereby be the better enabled, in the use of the duties of Tea∣ching, Admonishing, and Singing of Psalms, in heart and voice, as its expressed and implied in the same 16<HI>th verse.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Those duties and services, of Teaching, Admonishing, and Sing∣ing of Psalms which are <HI>Spiritual Hymns</HI> or <HI>Songs,</HI> were to be done to the Lord, (as in the same 16<HI>th verse,</HI>) that is, to the glory of the Lord: Now there are no Duties and holy Services done thus to the Lord, which are not done in obedience to his Will: but the Lord hath no other will (as a Rule of obedience) then his Will revealed in the written Scrip∣tures:
<PB N="89" REF="000313_0092_0FA4AA35E0109E40"/>
There is nothing that doth please God in any act of Worship, unless he sees himself obeyed: hence, I may safely infer, that the <HI>Qua∣kers Worship</HI> cannot be accepted of God, because it is not only without, but against the revealed Will and Rule of Obedience, This cannot with any Truth be gainsayed or denied.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Arg.</HI> The Written Scripture cannot be the Word of God, be∣cause it consists of Words.</P>
<P><HI>Reply,</HI> 1. This <HI>Argument</HI> proves fully, that the <HI>Quakers</HI> are <HI>under the power of Satan,</HI> Act. 26. 11. grosly blind in, and ignorant of the inspired word of Christ: for in Scripture Language, Word and Words, are of the same signification: as for instance, <HI>Jer.</HI> 15. 16. thy Words were found, and thy Word was unto me: <HI>Jer.</HI> 36. 1, 2. This Word came: write the Words: <HI>Amos</HI> 8. 11, 12. hearing the Words: seek the Word: <HI>Numb.</HI> 15. 30. the Spirit calls the Commandments of God, consisting of many Words, the Word of God: and the many Words, which God Commanded <HI>Moses</HI> to speak to the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> Exod. 9. 20. is there cal∣led the <HI>Word of the Lord:</HI> Likewise our Saviour, <HI>Joh.</HI> 2 22. calls the Scripture, containing many <HI>Words:</HI> and so also in, <HI>Joh.</HI> 10. 35. to these places of Scripture, many more might (were there any need) be added, shewing that <HI>Word</HI> in the singular, and <HI>Words</HI> in the plural, are synoni∣mous and of the same import in the Holy Scriptures, and therefore the cavil is idle and vain: I pass to the second part of this <HI>Principle,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>That the written Scriptures are not the infallible standing Rule of Faith and Life.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Reply,</HI> This plainly argues an <HI>Evil and Unbelieving heart,</HI> in the revealed Truths of God: and distructive (as much as in them lies) to the great end of <HI>Divine Inspirations:</HI> For God purposely inspired holy men, not so much for their own sakes, as for this end; that what they writ and spake from Gods inspiration in the Scripture, might be the stand∣ing and infallible Rule for Faith and holiness of Life, in all succeeding Ages and Generations; and for this cause hath <HI>Paul</HI> recorded, <HI>Rom.</HI> 15. 4. <HI>For whatsoever things were written aforetime, were written for our Learning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> hope:</HI> Note, <HI>That we,</HI> the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> includes himself for one, that did learn of the Scriptures written afore time, as the only infallible Rule.</P>
<P>And thus was it also taken by our Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>Luk.</HI> 16. 29, 31. <HI>Chap.</HI> 24. 44. <HI>to</HI> 47. more especially in the hour of his Temptations, he kept his mind close to the written Word of God; the Scriptures penned by <HI>Moses,</HI> Dan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t. 16. to repel the Devil; saying, <HI>It is written, Mat</HI> 4. <HI>ver.</HI> 4. <HI>ver.</HI> 7 <HI>ver.</HI>10. <HI>with this sword of the Spirit,</HI> three times (as you see)

the Lord Jesus Christ wounds the Devil; now doth the Lords Christ thus honour the written Scriptures: who are ye then, that dishonour the same: Notwithstanding, we will hear what they have (by way of <HI>Ar∣gument</HI>) to say for themselves, concerning this matter. Their</P>

<P><HI>Reply,</HI> The Apostle in this Text exhorts the <HI>Galatians</HI> to walk in the Spirit, (<HI>sc.</HI> of Faith) I have not (as if <HI>Paul</HI> should have said,) forget my former discourse concerning Faith, <HI>ver.</HI> 5. nor do I declare it, in per∣swading <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou to mutual love, <HI>ver.</HI> 14. and that he might be understood a∣right, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he adds. <HI>Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lusts of the flesh:</HI> for the spirit of Faith, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 13.

<P><HI>Reply,</HI> We know that Seducing <HI>Quakers</HI> teach because the Spirit is anticedent to the Scriptures, therefore none can walk in the Scriptures, till they walk in the Spirit: the Consequence is as same, as a Teaching <HI>Quaker</HI> is blind: however, it is granted, that the Spirit is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the Scripture, in respect of time, or as to the revelation of the Scripture, howbeit, the Scriptures are before the Spirit, in respect of aid &amp; assistance, thus the Apostle, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 12. <HI>But unto us they did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them, that have preached the Gospel unto you, with the Holy Ghost sent down from Heaven:</HI> which Text of Scripture clearly shews, that the Holy Spirit (in respect of special help and assi∣stance) is subsequent, to the Scriptural Gospel Preached: this receives further confirmation from the Prophet, <HI>Isai.</HI> 8. 20.

penned by <HI>Moses:</HI> well then, though the Rule they had before, was not an institution written, yet it was an institution sent forth, &amp; given by God himself, which Rule of Faith and Life then given, was (I say again as to the matter therein contained) the same with the instituted Rule written; now then, all that ye Teaching <HI>Quakers</HI> have said, is no more but this, <HI>sc.</HI> That you deny this way of written Scripture, to have alwayes been the only way of Gospel-conveyance; and from thence, ye pretend to ad∣vance and extoll your unwritten Scripture, (that Idol-light within) that thereby ye may the more craftily throw down the Scriptures inspired of God: surely▪ this Plot cannot be from the spirit of the true Christ▪ but from your own (as the Lord knows) blind, rotten and wicked spirit, which tells you, that you are no fur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her bound to obey the written Scrip∣tures, then your Light (that false Christ) within, shall make you wil∣ling to obey.</P>
<P>Arg. 4. <HI>That the Spirit is not to be tried by the Scriptures, but the Scri∣ptures are to be tried by the spirit, therefore the spirit</HI> (not the Scriptures) <HI>is our standing Rule for Faith and Life.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> The Father of lies, cannot make a greater lie, then that which is contained in this <HI>Argument:</HI> for it plainly makes the inspiring Spirit, and the inspired Scripture to be of different natures; which is contrary to the many Scriptures of truth afore asserted: there's not any <HI>Quaker,</HI> that hath to this day produced one Text of Scripture to make good this <HI>Argument:</HI> where is that place of Scripture to be found, which saith, <HI>the Scriptures are to be tried by the spirit?</HI> doth not the spirit it self require us 1 <HI>John</HI> 4. 1. <HI>not to believe every spirit, but to try</HI> (not the Scriptures, but) <HI>the spirits,</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> spiritual gifts) <HI>whether they are of God:</HI> And how did the noble Elders at <HI>Berea,</HI> try the Spirit by which <HI>Paul</HI> Preached. The 11<HI>th.</HI> verse tells us, <HI>It was by their searching of the Scriptures daily, whether these things were so;</HI> it being an Article of Faith with them, that the writ∣ten Scriptures were the Churches standing Rule for Faith and Life: and therefore, <HI>ver.</HI> 12. <HI>Many of them believed,</HI> sc. That Jesus of <HI>Nazareth</HI> was the true Christ and their only Saviour: surely, the Elders above, try∣ing the spirit by the search of the Scriptures doth sufficiently prove, that the spirits are to be tried by the Scripture, and not the Scripture by the spirit: the end of Gods inspiring the Scripture was that it might thereby be enabled to try the spirit; the spirit is so far from questioning or try∣ing the Scripture▪ that it ever witnesseth for or against, as the Scripture witnesseth being indited by the Holy <HI>G</HI>host, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 21. for that end, should the spirit of truth, witness otherwise then according to the inspi∣red Scripture: (that is to say, if the spirit should witness one thing to be a truth in the Scripture, and another thing contrary to it in a mans Con∣science)
<PB N="93" REF="000313_0096_0FA4AA3E0E65EDA8"/>
the spirit should be divided against it self, it should be spirit of contradiction: for instance; the spirit witnesseth in the Scripture, <HI>That the true Christ and our only Saviour was and is Jesus Christ of Nazareth, a man approved of God; who was taken by the Jews, slain and hanged upon a Tree, whom God raised from the dead the third day, and exalted to be a Prince and Saviour:</HI> Thus the spirit witnesseth in the Scriptures, <HI>Act.</HI> 2. 22,23. <HI>Chap.</HI> 5. 30,31,34.</P>
<P>But a <HI>Quaker</HI> pretends, that the spirit witnesseth in his Conscience, that there is a light within him, which is the true Christ and only Saviour; which is not the Man Jesus of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> which the <HI>Jew:</HI> never slew, nor hanged upon a tree, nor was ever raised by <HI>G</HI>od from a bodily death.</P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> The spirit witnesseth in the Scripture: <HI>That he is a Righteous man, who walketh in all the Commandments and Ordinances of the Lord,</HI> Luk. 1. 16.</P>
<P>But a <HI>Quaker</HI> pretends that the spirit witnesseth in his Conscience, that he is a righteous man, who for sakes all the commanded Ordinances of the Lord.</P>
<P>Now should we <HI>Christians</HI> be so weak and wicked, as to believe a <HI>Qua∣kers</HI> pretended spirit in him, to be the spirit of <HI>G</HI>od (and not of the Devil) should we not then be guilty of this dreadful Blasphemy: <HI>namely,</HI> of making the spirit of <HI>G</HI>od, a spirit divided against it self, a spirit of contradiction (teaching lies in the Scripture) by witnessing therein the things above, (touching Jesus Christ, and his Ordinances) to be the truths; and other things contrary to them, for truths in a <HI>Quakers</HI> Con∣science, or (as he calls it) in his tender part, this were to take strong &amp; damnable delusions, for sacred and scriptural inspirations: that inspira∣tion, which is either without the written word, or against it, is an hellish imposture: indeed, its no marvel, that the Teaching <HI>Quakers</HI> would have their spirit within, that Idolized light) to try the <HI>s</HI>criptures (not to be tried by them) for if they might herein prevail, (and withal get into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le) they would undoubtedly soon Arraign, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry, and Condemn the inspired Bible of <HI>G</HI>od to Fire and Faggot: this conclusion may (with∣out breach of charity) be grounded upon the scurrilous pens of some seducing, Teaching <HI>Quakers.</HI> whom I might herein, (with their bold ex∣pressions) have declared (having them by me) but I feared the swelling of these confutations, and the discouragement that might thereby be gi∣ven to the Reader.</P>
<P>By the way, I say down this <HI>Caution:</HI> to wit, though the holy and bles∣sed spirit of <HI>G</HI>od, be above all tryal, yet there are spirits (even the spirits <HI>i. e.</HI> the spiritual gifts of all men) which must be submitted to tryal, whether they are of <HI>G</HI>od, <HI>i. e.</HI> of the <HI>Book of God,</HI> 2 Cor. 34. 14. wherein

<P>In the last place, perhaps some Teaching <HI>Quakers</HI> may say, sc. <HI>We own the written Scripture, as a witness bearer, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of that light which is in Man.</HI></P>

That the Light in Man was long before the written Scriptures:</HI> yet the written Scriptures do declare a truth to us more ancient then the oldest <HI>Quaker,</HI> or his Idol light within him: namely, what the <HI>El<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hims</HI> spake each to other, saying, <HI>Let us make Man
<PB N="95" REF="000313_0098_0FA4AA3F5FF67308"/>
in our own Image, Gen.</HI> 1. 26 And having made man; it tells us, what God said, <HI>sc. Be fruitful and multiply,</HI> ver. 28. <HI>And behold I have given you of every Tree bearing fruit,</HI> ver. 29. <HI>And God commanded the man,</HI> say∣ing, <HI>of every Tree of the Garden, &amp;c.</HI> Gen. 2. 16. Moreover the Scriptures tells us of divers things long before themselves were written: <HI>to wit,</HI> that (after the Fall) the Word of God was manifested to <HI>Adam</HI> and his wife, and likewise, that God manifested himself to <HI>Cain</HI> (by his word) three times, <HI>Gen:</HI> 3. 8 9. and afterward that the World of God came to <HI>Noah,</HI> and so to <HI>Abraham,</HI> and others.</P>
<P>Now (O ye <HI>Teaching, Seducing Quakers</HI>) I would ask you this Que∣stion: sc. <HI>Could your Light within tell you ought of all this, if the written Scriptures had not told it first?</HI></P>
<P>And yet, you would fain make us belive; that your Light within is the true Scripture, and Word of God even the everlasting Word: so that this most notorious lie, (the whimsie, called Light within) is the new devised ground of your Faith, and Religious Worship.</P>
<P>Oh, ye poor Soul deluded, and Soul deluding ones: know assuredly, that this Doctrine of your beloved <HI>Idol light</HI> in your own addle brains) is directly contrary to what the Lord Christ said to his Father, concern∣ing his, Apostles, <HI>Joh.</HI> 17. 8. <HI>I have given them thy words,</HI> (word ver. 14.) <HI>which thou gavest me, and they have received them, and have known surely, that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.</HI></P>
<P>Note here, that the words which the Father gave to Christ, and Christ to his Apostles, they believed; and (so believing) Preached them to the World: the Substance whereof is in their written <HI>G</HI>ospel, and Epistles: which is to true Christians, the Word of <HI>G</HI>od, and the ground of their Faith, but ye (Soul-deceivers) labour to dissolve this ground of our Christian Faith, because ye would lay a Foundation of your own humane Invention, <HI>sc.</HI> an un bloody Light within, which Idolized Light, hath no more real blood in it, then there is in the Transubstantiated Bread of your Popish Brethren; wherein both ye and they do exactly agree, in one feigned blood less Sacrifice for sin: which is evidently another <HI>Gospel,</HI> which stands under the doubted Curse of <HI>G</HI>od, <HI>Gal.</HI> 1. 8,9. which is further confirmed, <HI>Heb.</HI> 9. 22. <HI>Without shed∣ding of Blood is no remission.</HI>
<PB N="96" REF="000313_0099_0FA4AA3FF77D8160"/>
O read and tremble before the irraversible decree of wrath and venge∣ance go forth: for without shedding of blood (sc. <HI>true humane blood</HI>) there is no remission, as above, and consequently the unavoidable curse of hell and damnation, doth attend a non remission, which leads me to the <HI>Quakers</HI> third Principle.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="principle">
<P>The third Principle, <HI>That the Soul of Man is God in part, and therefore infallible.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply,</HI> This titular Principle, consists of two parts; which shall be dealt with distinctly.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That the Soul of Man is God in part:</HI> Thus <HI>James Nayler</HI> (in his Book, <HI>Love to the Lost,</HI> page 58.) teaching fulness of light (or soul) with∣in, in which fulness is (meaning the fulness of God in part) and <HI>John Tayne</HI> (in his Book of ten <HI>Epistles,</HI> page 71.) saith, <HI>the soul of man is God in part,</HI> who in <HI>page</HI> 3. renders this reason for it, because <HI>the Soul is no created sub∣stance:</HI> and <HI>John Lilborn</HI> (a late grand leading <HI>Quaker</HI>) in his Book of six particulars, <HI>page</HI> 16. he affirms, <HI>That the Light in man, was the Light in God himself,</HI> in whom is no darkness at all; referring to 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 6. 16. <HI>Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto, which no man hath seen or can see, to him be honour and power everlasting.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply,</HI> Although these words, do most plainly exclude any meer man from possessing God, in his essential nature: yet in <HI>page</HI> 15. he inferrs, <HI>That the Light which is the infinite essence of God, is the living</HI> (or quicken∣ing) <HI>holy, tender part of man, the everlasting Word of God, by whom all things were made:</HI> And in <HI>page</HI> 19. further saith▪ <HI>It is the very Principle of true Religion:</HI> consider now, if it be so then it must be such Principle to the Devils, and all damned creatures: for as creatures the everlasting word made them, and their Being, Life and Motion is in him; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> use he that is <HI>Being</HI> it self, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the bottom of the being of all created Natures, and consequently (according to <HI>John Lilbourn</HI>) the Light in man (which he calls the Everlasting Word) by whom all things are made must be the principle of true Religion in the Devils and damned (O hellish Divinity &amp; Doctrine) for even they (<HI>sc.</HI> the Devils &amp; damned) live and move, and have their dependance upon the divine nature, or infinite essence of the Godhead, otherwise they would all fall to nothing by an annihilation.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, this is in a special manner to be noted. <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> one thing that the infinite essence thus possesseth men, devils and all things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and another thing, for man (or any other creature) to possess the infinite Essence of God, to his happiness and blessedness: for, so man only pos∣sesseth God, according to his revealed will: but through the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt of a right understanding of this special difference above stated, it comes to pass, that this <HI>untoward Generation</HI> Dream, the Light within them, to be
<PB N="97" REF="000313_0100_0FA4AA40C7DAD570"/>
God in part, and hence inferr, that the Soul is God in part here, and full in God hereafter; for which they do pretend especially four Texts of Scripture, <HI>to wit,</HI> Gen 2.7. <HI>Eccles.</HI> 12. 7. <HI>Act.</HI> 17. 27. 28. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 4.</P>
<P><HI>Reply,</HI> To the first Scripture, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2. 7. <HI>And the Lord God formed Man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his Nosthrils the breath of life, and Man became a living Soul:</HI> hence they argue, that the Soul (in this life) is God in part.</P>
<P><HI>Reply,</HI> 1. It is to be noted; That in the former part of the verse, we have the Creation of <HI>Adams</HI> body: <HI>The Lord God formed Man,</HI> that is he fashioned the outward and inward part of <HI>Adam,</HI> straight and upright, with all his outward limbs and lineaments in their due places, without; an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Veins, Arteries, Vent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cles, and Bowels in their due places within.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Creation of Mans Soul is described, <HI>i.e.</HI> breathed into his nosthrils, (which <HI>Synecdochically</HI> denotes the whole Man) the breath of life: Gods order herein is very observable; <HI>sc.</HI> after the Lord had form∣ed his body, he gives in (not himself in, but) from himself the Soul: here's the nature of Gods act [<HI>Breathed</HI>] it is spoken after the manner of men for as God hath no hands to form so nor mouth to breathe: so that hereby must be mean▪ Gods powerful Creation of his Body, and infusion of his Soul: which God doth as easily, as man breathes: But to the matter in hand;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Divine Being is infinite and indivisible:</HI> therefore the Soul of man cannot be <HI>G</HI>od, either in whole or in part.</P>
<P N="2">2. The words being spoken after the manner of men: that is to say as the breath of Man, is not man in who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e or in part but only from him; so the Soul being breathed, is only from <HI>G</HI>od by infusion.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Soul of Man was made after <HI>G</HI>ods Image, <HI>Gen.</HI> 1. 26. <HI>And God said, let</HI> [Us] <HI>make man in our</HI> (<HI>sc.</HI> the Father, through the Son, by the Spirit) <HI>Image, after our likeness,</HI> i.e in our Image, most like to (not the same with) us. It is an <HI>Hebraisme,</HI> noting a superlative Image, most like the <HI>Trinity</HI> in <HI>Unity.</HI></P>
<P>This Image or likeness stands in representing <HI>G</HI>od three wayes.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is a made Image. 2. It is true Image. 3. It is very near and likely Image, which appears not only in the spiritual and immortal nature of it, but in rectitude of Mind, Will, Affections, Members, all pure and righteous, conformed to <HI>G</HI>ods will, <HI>Eph.</HI> 4. 24. which evidently proves, that the Soul cannot be <HI>G</HI>od the Creator, it being made as above, it must be a Creature, and consequently a created substance, and there∣fore not (after a <HI>Quakers</HI> gross and absurd manner of speaking) <HI>G</HI>od in whole, or in part.</P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> When <HI>G</HI>od breathed into <HI>Adams</HI> liveless body, he breathed not
<PB N="98" REF="000313_0101_0FA4AA41643E80E0"/>
himself, because he was there before for, God is in every thing excluded out of nothing, as before evidenced; whence, it undeniably follows, that into <HI>Adam</HI>'s liveless body, God breathed not himself, but mans reasonable Soul, which is mans proper form, and without it, Man is not a Man: So much for the first Scripture.</P>
<P>The second Scripture, <HI>Eccles.</HI> 12.7. <HI>Then shall the dust return to the Earth, as it was, and the Spirit shall return to God who gave it:</HI> Here∣hence, they argue, <HI>The Soul of Man is God in part, for God is a Spirit.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply,</HI> 1. Though God be a Spirit, yet every Spirit is not <HI>G</HI>od, An Angel is a Spirit, <HI>Heb.</HI> 2,<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4, but not God; so, though the Soul be a Spirit yet it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> made Spirit as afore observed; likewise hereunto agrees, <HI>Isai.</HI> 57.16. <HI>For the Spirit should fail before me, and the Souls which I have made:</HI> Souls are of Gods making, and therefore a created (not un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ated) sub∣stance, besides, to say, that God is a Spirit, and the Soul of Man is a Spi∣rit, therefore the Soul is part of Gods essence is not only false but a most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illy i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ference: for there is multiplicity of signification in words, and here lies the fallacy: <HI>Spirit,</HI> sometimes signifie God, <HI>Joh.</HI> 4.24 and some∣times the wind, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onah</HI> 3.8. Now, its no good inference thence, therefore God and the Wind are the same: howbeit, here is some of a <HI>Quakers Divinity.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The scope and import of the Text it self above, excludes this their Interpreta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion. <HI>For.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. When its said, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <HI>Spirit shall return,</HI> it notes, a passing from one place to another, which cannot be said of the <HI>Essence</HI> of God: for that being infinite, filleth all places at once.</P>
<P N="2">2. To <HI>G</HI>od that gave it: Now according to the Rules of right reason, the <HI>Giver</HI> and the <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fe</HI> are distinct.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>When the Dust</HI> (the body) <HI>return to the Earth, then the Spirit</HI> (the Soul) <HI>shall return to God:</HI> that is, to <HI>G</HI>ods only and alone supposing, either to Weal or to Woe, for Eternity, <HI>according to what it hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the body, whether it be good or evil,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5 10. in this sense it is that the Soul returns to <HI>G</HI>od; which Truth, the Scripture <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> us unto as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the finger▪ in the examples of <HI>Dives</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> (L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. and there∣fore to affirm, the Soul returns to <HI>God,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> part of <HI>G</HI>od, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and sinful with a witness: for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> God de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ective, all the soul returns,<HI>making him a finite, not an infinite God.</HI></P>
<P>The third Scripture, <HI>Act.</HI> 17. 27. 28. <HI>Though he be not far from every one of us for in him we live, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and have our being.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply,</HI> I have already and fully granted, that the <HI>Essential <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of God,</HI> is in Heaven and Earth, and all created natures: yet I do herewithal say, though all created Natures are in his, and his in theirs: but yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is
<PB N="95" REF="000313_0102_0FA4AA42F0640020"/>
uncreated nature, and their created natures are ever distinct and different; <HI>their<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> finite and bounded, <HI>his</HI> infinite and boundless, not included in, nor excluded out of any thing; for God is infinitely beyond their beings, lives and motions, where never any created nature was, nor ever shall be, otherwise he is not God infinite: furthermore the very Text of Scrip∣ture above alledged, confutes their inference, for it expresly saith, <HI>God is near to every one of us,</HI> and gives this Reason for it; because in him, we live, move, and have our being: so then this very expression, <HI>sc. That God is but near to us,</HI> plainly shews, that <HI>he</HI> is not <HI>us,</HI> nor <HI>we him.</HI></P>
<P>The fourth Scripture, 2 <HI>Pet</HI> 1.4. <HI>Whereby are given unto us, exceeding great and precious promises; that by these, you might be partakers of the di∣vine Nature:</HI> whence the Teaching <HI>Quaker</HI> doth conclude, <HI>that the infi∣nite and indivisible Godhead, is divided into parts:</HI> thus senseless are they of the grossest absurdities.</P>
<P><HI>Reply,</HI> 1. This place of Scripture, doth only signifie, that the partici∣pation of the divine Nature, is by a reception of the promised multipli∣cation of grace and peace, <HI>ver</HI> 2. so that the Text asserts no more but this; namely, that they partake of the divine Nature, who are partakers of the grace and peace promised: these being divine qualities, are of a divine Nature, called the <HI>Communion of the Holy Ghost,</HI> 2 Cor. 13. 14. If this be the genuine and proper sense of the Text; how far is it from pro∣ving the Soul of man to be part of God; To clear this matter yet a lit∣tle more, Consider,</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Divine Nature</HI> may be taken in a twofold sense; as</P>
<P N="1">1. For the essential nature of God, which is, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1. 20. <HI>his eternal po∣wer and God head:</HI> in this sense, the divine nature is infinite and indivisi∣ble; and as such, no man can partake of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Divine Nature, may be taken, for the gifts, graces, and com∣forts of spirit, flowing from Christ man (in whom they are without mea∣sure, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.34) being daily given from him to his Members: now, it is in this last sense, that the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> speaks of the Divine Nature a∣bove; and therefore not to be understood in a <HI>Quakers</HI> sense; for the Deity or Godhead, this two fold signification of the <HI>Divine Nature,</HI> be∣ing <HI>hid from the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st ones;</HI> causeth them to call the Soul (still the Idol∣light) the <HI>Deity in part, no created substance:</HI> not discerning the hideous Blasphemies which attends this their <HI>Principle;</HI> for if the Soul of man be God in part, then the essence of God would be subject to <HI>change</HI> and <HI>pas∣sion;</HI> yea, which is worse, <HI>to sin,</HI> (for so the Soul of man is in this life) these Blasphemies are the unavoidable consequences, of the Souls being God in part: I pass this, and proceed to the second part of the Principle, <HI>to wit, a Quakers infallibility.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="000313_0103_0FA4AA44AEF6D7A8"/>
<HI>Reply.</HI> To the second part: <HI>a Quakers infallible Spirit within <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>;</HI> their spirit of infallibility, or infallible spirit, is grounded upon the <HI>Souls being God in part;</HI> but this hath been proved to be erroneous and highly Blasphemous: the other is therefore of the same nature, (<HI>Chips of the some block</HI>) yea this their <HI>Principle</HI> of infallibility shews us, the rise and original of their Religion; I have long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hought their infallible light <HI>with∣in,</HI> to be no other then the <HI>Pope</HI> without: we may not think its for nought that there are so many exact resemblances between the Idol light, and the Idolatrous <HI>Pope:</HI> I shall give you some Instances,</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Pope</HI> takes upon him the power of Pardoning sin making him∣self God and Christ: which power of pardoning sin, the <HI>Quaker</HI> ascribes to his Light within <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lling it <HI>G</HI>od and Christ.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Pope</HI> affirms, that he Teachings and Rules of direction, be∣ing believed in, and walked up unto, will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> such Believers and Walk∣ers Perfect, and bring them to justification and salvation, all which the <HI>Quaker</HI> doth affirm of the Light within, it being believed in and o∣beyed.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Pope</HI> teacheth that his written Scriptures are so far to be obey∣ed, as they do agree with the infallible Spirit within him, just so, the <HI>Quakers teach,</HI> that they are no further bound to obey the Letter of the Scriptures, then the infallible, unerring light within, makes them willing to obey.</P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>Pope</HI> declares his <HI>Apocryphals</HI> to be not only of equal verity with, but to exceed the Scriptures: even so, a <HI>Quakers</HI> Light within, tea∣cheth him to prefer his <HI>Apocryphal Quakerisms,</HI> before the written Scrip∣tures.</P>
<P N="5">5. The <HI>Pope</HI> testifies there is a nigher Doctrine (than the Scripture hath) to feed the Saints and perfect ones (meaning, his Church enlight∣ning Traditions,) so saith the <HI>Quakers</HI> light within, that it hath a higher Doctrine, then the written Scripture hath any, to guid and feed the true Saints.</P>
<P N="6">6. The <HI>Pope</HI> robs Christ of all his Offices.</P>
<P N="1">1. Of his Kingly Office, in taking part of it to himself, by remitting sins, and making Laws to bind Conscience, both which a <HI>Quakers</HI> Light presumes to do, remitting sin, and binding Conscience by its laws.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Pope</HI> robs Christ of his <HI>Priestly Office,</HI> for he doth dispose of it, gi∣ving to a <HI>Masse Priest</HI> power to offer a daily propitiation Sacrifice: yea, that every <HI>Papist</HI> hath a piece of it within him, that thereby every one of them may satisfie the Justice of <HI>G</HI>od for his sins, even by his own Merits within him: and for Christs Mediatorship, as some of them do abolish it, so no <HI>Catholick</HI> desires the Man Jesus Christ to pray for Him, because
<PB N="97" REF="000313_0104_0FA4AA45271C7F38"/>
each one of them hath so much of the propitiatory Sacrifice dayly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them, as is <HI>meritorious</HI> to satisfie the justice of God for their sins.</P>
<P>Of which robbery (in reference to Christs <HI>Priestly Office</HI>) the <HI>Quakers</HI> are equally guilty: for, they give to their light (that <HI>Masse Priest</HI>) with in, a power to offer Sacrifice propitiatory dayly for sin; whereby they daily (in themselves) satisfie Gods justice for their sins, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by their own internal merits; and as for Christs <HI>Mediatorship,</HI> they have quite abolish∣ed it: For to <HI>Quaker</HI> desires the one <HI>Mediator,</HI> the Man Jesus Christ, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.5. to pray for him.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Pope</HI> robs Christ also of his <HI>Prophetical Office:</HI> for this office, he assumes to himself: who (without the Scriptures) determines infalli∣bly (by the pretened assistance of a Spirit of infallible light, lockt up in his own breast) all points of Faith and Life: which kind of Robbery (as to Crists <HI>Prophetical Office</HI>) the <HI>Quakers</HI> have likewise assumed, who by their Light within (without the Holy Scriptures, or laws of the King thence derived) pretend to an infallible determination of all points con∣cerning Faith and Life: here hence, we may safely infer, that a <HI>Quakers</HI> Light, and <HI>Romes Pope</HI> are co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>qual <HI>Antichrists.</HI></P>
<P>This may further appear; if the Terms and Title heretofore given to the <HI>Pope</HI> (as asserted by the R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>verend <HI>Brightman, Ren.</HI> 13. <HI>page</HI> 135,136) he compared with those now given to the Light within, by <HI>G. Fox</HI> in his Folio Book, <HI>The great Mystery &amp;c.</HI></P>

<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="principle">
<P>The fourth Principle, <HI>to wit, A Quakers denying of the Trinity, or three persons in one Deity.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply,</HI> It is by most judicious Christians acknowledged: <HI>sc.</HI> that three persons in one Deity, is so great a mystery, that it cannot be found out by natural reason, and no wonder for there are many things in nature yea, in man himself, <HI>Eccles.</HI> 11.5. <HI>Thou knowest not the way of the Spirit, nor how the bones do grow in the Womb of her that is with child,</HI> reason cannot reach the knowledge of this: Therefore (saith Mr. <HI>Cavil</HI>) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not to be "admired, if man be at a loss about the incomprehensible nature o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God: Howbeit, it may be to all rational Saints) sufficient to prove thre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> per∣sons in the Godhead, (though we cannot fully conceive how this should be:) For, 1. <HI>There is but one God,</HI> 1 Cor. 8.4,6. 2. In this one God, there are three [<HI>He's</HI>] that do <HI>Understand, will,</HI> and <HI>Act,</HI> and these three are so ddistinguished, <HI>that the one is not the other:</HI> An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>' is Dr. <HI>Gouges</HI> observation on <HI>Deut.</HI> 6.4. <HI>Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, is one Lord;</HI> the word [<HI>Lord</HI>] is twice in the Text, and (saith he) Printed in <HI>Capital Letters,</HI> purposely to notifie, that the word [<HI>Lord</HI>] in the ori∣ginal, is <HI>Jehovah,</HI> and so he reads it. <HI>Hear O Israel, Jehovah our Elohims, is one Jehovah:</HI> Here is <HI>Trinity in Unity.</HI></P>
<P>And we read that the <HI>Prophet,</HI> Isai 6.8. <HI>Heard the voice of the Lord,</HI> saying, <HI>who will go for</HI> [<HI>Us,</HI>] this [<HI>Us</HI>] denotes more persons, then one: likewise in <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.26. the <HI>Elohems</HI> spake each to other, and said, <HI>let</HI> (us) <HI>make Man:</HI> surely then, the Trinity cannot be as some dream, sc. <HI>distinctions and relations</HI> only: but reall existences in the essence of <HI>Jehovah:</HI> for distinctions and relations are such as cannot speak: but the <HI>Elohims</HI> spake each to other, as above noted.</P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> If it be said, the plural number [<HI>Us</HI>] takes in all, as well as the number three?</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="000313_0106_0FA4AA4A778FA9D0"/>
<HI>Answ.</HI> It doth so; but whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God hath determined plurality, to three, it is time then to settl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and to be certain, that there are no more, which is confirmed, <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9 <HI>Baptizing in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</HI> that is, to believe in, obey and worship the Father, in the Son, and the Holy Ghost: here you see, are three in the divin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Nature, that do live understand will and act; and here, its plainly revealed, that they are so distinct, that the one cannot be the other.</P>
<P>Indeed the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> (the <HI>Quakers Brethren</HI> in this thing) do deny the Holy Ghost to be a person; and say, <HI>It is the power, vertue, and efficacy of God the Father:</HI> If so then the Scripture ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve, <HI>Mat</HI> 28. 19. must be read thus, <HI>Baptizing them in</HI> (or unto) <HI>the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the virtue, power, and efficacy of the Father</HI> (to be believed in, o∣beyed and worshipped) which sounds absurdly, utterly disagreeable to reason: But above all, it is inconsistent with the Scriptures of truth, as in <HI>Joh</HI> 1. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4 <HI>And the Word was ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, as the glory of the only begotten of the Father:</HI> and in ver. 18. <HI>No man hath seen God at any time, but the only begotten Son, which is in the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>some of the Father, he hath a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>area him:</HI> and in <HI>John</HI> 14 26. <HI>But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my Name:</HI> These Texts of Holy Scripture do shew us, that the Father begets the Son the Son is begotten of the Father, and the Holy Ghost proceeds from both: Furthermore, when the Lord Christ was Baptized, <HI>Mat.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, 15,16,17. the Father was heard and not seen, the Holy Ghost (in the form of a Dove) seen and not heard: and Christ the Son both seen and heard: the Fa∣ther, saying of Christ this is my Son; and the Holy Ghost descending and lighting upon him, which is a most clear demonstration of their real and personal dictinction.</P>
<P>Again, in 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 5 7. <HI>For there are three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost, and these three are one:</HI> Now if they be three, then they must be (in some respect) more then one, and not the same; besides it argues weakness to quarrel the Phrase [<HI>Persons,</HI>] for as much as the [<HI>Person</HI>] doth <HI>Grammatically</HI> (<HI>tria necessaria sunt, ut aliquid persona dicatur</HI>) signifie, first, second and third, which makes three, this only by the bye, for illustration rather then evidence: though we do not find this Phrasiology in the Scriptures, <HI>sc.</HI> Trinity of Persons: yet this is not a sufficient ground to deny it; for though we have not the words yet having the things signified, in and by the words, it ought to satisfie a rational Saint: as for the things signified, the Texts above, are fair and plain affirming <HI>there are thr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e that bear Record</HI> (or witness) now to bear witness, is properly the office and act of a person, or persons.</P>
<P>Qu. <HI>Whether the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, are declared as three distinct witnesses?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="000313_0107_0FA4AA4C0FBA1F80"/>
<HI>Answ.</HI> Yes, that they are so may appear by the testimony of these Scrip∣tures, <HI>Joh.</HI> 8.18. <HI>I am one that bear witness of my self, and the Father sent me beareth witness of me,</HI> and Joh. 15.26. <HI>But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testifie of me:</HI> here, we have the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, witnessing; that is to say, the Comforter sent, the Son sending, and that from the Father, which proves them to be distinct witnesses, and by good consequence to be di∣stinct persons: herewithal, let it be well observed, <HI>sc.</HI> To deny (as Tea∣ching <HI>Quakers</HI> do) the Trinity of persons, in the unity of the Godhead; is, in down right terms, to deny that there is a God; for the Scripture inspired of God, saith, <HI>These three are one,</HI> Therefore to deny the Trinity, is to deny the Unity; which is <HI>Atheistical:</HI> so much in <HI>Answer</HI> to the re∣quests of some of the Lords people in <HI>Barmudas.</HI></P>
<P>With whom I shall now (in a few words) leave my hearty well-wish∣ing advice: beseeching them (and all the rest of the Lords People there) to be ever mindful of the Blessed Apostles resolution, <HI>Act.</HI> 21. 13. <HI>I am ready to die for the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ;</HI> a most gracious (as well as noble) resolution and fit for every good Christians imitation: which is indeed, no l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss then he standing against the <HI>Gates of Hell,</HI> by hearing witness to the holy Truth of God: O let us rather burn, then bow to that <HI>Idol light,</HI> which the <HI>Romish N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>buchaa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zzar</HI> hath set up in Teaching <HI>Quakers:</HI> Oh, let us rather die for the Name of Jesus Christ of <HI>Naza∣reth,</HI> then leave the <HI>Mark</HI> of the Beast, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iteer within or on us: rather let us lose our h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ads from our shoulders, then renounce that <HI>saving head,</HI> who is ascended up into the Heavens above: O let us rather effuse our dearest blood and die glorious Martyrs, then live <HI>Apostates</HI> from, and die <HI>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>secutors</HI> of Jesus of <HI>Nazareth:</HI> And for your constant incourage∣ment herein, let us heartily learn the <HI>Apostles</HI> inspired Lesson, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.37. <HI>In all these, we are more then Conquerors, through him that loved us.</HI></P>
