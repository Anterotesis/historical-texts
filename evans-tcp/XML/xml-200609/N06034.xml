<HEAD>A Narrative, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>WILLIAM FLEMING, (who was taken about the first of November last) after giving a small Account of the Escape of one BURNS, who was taken by the Indians, goes on:</HEAD>
<P>I Was in the Neighbourhood where<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Burns <HI>had been taken Prisoner by the</HI> Delaware <HI>Indians some Time before</HI> Fleming, <HI>and was carried to their Wigwams, but being one Day sent to a Spring for Water, with an Indian Guard, in returning, he stopped under Pretence of tying his Mockasheens which were loose. All the</HI> Indians <HI>who was his Guard, got out of Sight; when he im∣mediately mounted a horse nigh at Hand, and rode full Speed to the inhabited Parts of the</HI> Province.</NOTE> <HI>Burns</HI> gave the above Relation, 7 Miles from my own Home, and though many who heard him, treated it as only the groundless Surmises of the Timorous, having too favourable an Opinion of the friendly Attachment of these Indians to this Province; yet I was determined however not to be too Fool-hardy, but hasten home, and remove my Wife and Effects to a neighbouring Fort. But, alas! by the Time I had got within two Miles of my House, two <HI>Indians</HI> started from behind the Root of a Tree, close by the Way Side, and had hold of my Horse's Bridle by the Time I well saw them. They commanded me to alight, very complaisantly shook Hands, and told me (for they could speak good English) I must go with them: But oh! what Tongue can utter the Horror and Confusion which in an Instant overwhelmed me, on find∣ing myself in the very Hands of those I was flying to a∣void: I stood trembling and Speechless for some Time,
<PB N="4" REF="007662_0003_102DB9E66F6CC328"/>
which my Enemies, savage as they were, took Notice of, and endeavoured to encourage me, by clapping me seve∣ral Times on the Shoulder, and bidding me not be afraid, for as I looked young and lusty, they would not hurt me, provided I was willing to go with them, and promise to stand by them, in Case they should be attack'd by the <HI>English</HI> in our future Proceedings: One of them who was pretty well dressed, told me his Name was Captain JACOB, and that he was Captain over the <HI>Indians</HI> in that Expedition, being 50 in all: He said he knew I could be of Service in leading him to those Houses that were most defenceless; and added, that if I proved faithful, he would use me well, and said, that tho' he was Captain over the aforesaid <HI>Indians,</HI> yet he had only one with him, and they were afraid to venture on Houses that had many Inhabitants, and that he would spare my Life on Condi∣tion I would help.</P>
<P>Upon these fair Promises I began to recover my Sen∣ses, and finding I must either act the Part he had assign'd me, or submit to the most cruel Torture, I concluded it most expedient to do the Former, remembring the say∣ing in <HI>Job, All that a Man hath will he give for his Life:</HI> But when I reflected on the Part I had undertaken to act, when I considered the dreadful Consequences of my In∣formations, I was grieved beyond Measure, and led the Way more like a condemn'd Criminal to meet his Fate, than one that had a Promise of Life and Happiness: Besides the Thoughts of leaving my poor dear Wife for ever, without being able to inform her of my Fate, or her own Danger, almost distracted me. My Master per∣ceiving me dejected, and somewhat backward in my In∣telligence, concluded I should be more Trouble than Ad∣vantage to him, and began not only to alter his Conduct, but gave me to understand that I was no longer at my own Disposal: This obliged me, though with Reluctance, to confess, I had a Wife not many Miles off, and that all my Concern was for her; upon which he told me he was glad to hear that, for they wanted a Woman to make Bread for them, and therefore insisted on my leading them
<PB N="5" REF="007662_0004_102DB9E8088EC3F0"/>
to my House: Though indeed from some Part of their former Treatment, I had no Reason to expect any Argu∣ments to induce me to a Compliance, in whatever they thought proper to demand, yet whatever might be the real Motive, they used several on this Occasion; one of which was, that it would be better to have her along with myself, than suffer her to stay where she was, as there was great Danger of some other <HI>Indians</HI> coming that Way, which if they did, she need expect no Mercy at their Hands; for he, Captain <HI>Jacob,</HI> had ordered his <HI>Indians</HI> to spare none but young Men and young Women. This Information quite revived me, and I was even glad of the Privilege of leading them that Way: I knew we had to pass by one <HI>Hicks'</HI>s, who had a numerous Family of able young Men, and was in great Hopes of being rescued by them: But when we came within Sight of the House, they did not advance towards it as I expected, but passed by at a Distance, and then stopped to consider what was most proper to be done. Whilst we tarried here, it unfortu∣nately happened that two of <HI>Hicks'</HI>s Sons came out from Dinner, in order to work at an adjacent new Settlement: The <HI>Indians</HI> on seeing them ran behind Trees, and order∣ed me to do the same between them: I complied, but was in hopes these <HI>Two</HI> would be followed out by some more of the Family, which might afford me an Opportunity of Escape; but my Hopes were soon frustrated, for they having no Suspicion of Danger, advanced carelesly on till the foremost came opposite to the <HI>Indian</HI> that stood nearest to me, who immediately sprung out and seiz'd and pinion'd the unhappy Victim. He screamed in a most piteous Manner for Help, but alas! there was none to be found. His Brother fled back to the House with the utmost Pre∣cipitation, whence not one would venture out. For my Part I was not in a Condition to afford the least Relief, not being allowed to carry even a Stick about me. They then hurried us away towards my House with the utmost Speed, fearing their new Captive might be released by his Relations.</P>
<P>The unhappy Youth not being accustomed to such
<PB N="6" REF="007662_0005_102DB9E9B66E76A8"/>
Treatment as he now met with; and not being appriz∣ed of the bad Consequences that might attend the least Resistance, discovered great uneasiness, and could not be prevailed upon to keep silent: Had not the <HI>Indians</HI> been acquainted with the <HI>English</HI> Tongue, I should have thought it my Duty to admonish him to a Compliance with their capricious Humours, till Providence might favour us with an Opportunity of Escape: But as I could advance no∣thing to mitigate his Grief but what might tend to betray my Intentions, and convince my Enemies that I was not so taken with my present way of Life, nor so much at∣tached to their Interest as they imagined, I was obliged to be entirely silent, and leave him to their Management.</P>
<P>Though they spoke all their Secrets in their own Lan∣guage, I could plainly perceive Resentment kindle in their very Looks, which made me shudder and tremble for his Fate: But why do I say his, seeing my Life was as much at the Disposal of these merciless Wretches as his, and I had no Reason to expect but that when they began, we should equally fall a Sacrifice to their cruel Resentment: All the Advantages I had to boast of superior to him were, that I had been longer in their Service, and had the Policy to counterfeit a chearful Behaviour, whilst he continued obstinate to the last Degree; but whether they would condescend to take these Things into Con∣sideration, I was at a Loss to determine.</P>
<P>We had now got within a Mile of my House, when my poor Wife should have employed all my Thoughts, had they not been diverted by my own melancholy Situ∣ation: For being now in the midst of a considerable Thick∣et, our Masters came to another consultation concerning their future Proceedings. Which being done, one of them being placed near a Tree, ordered me to advance towards him, which I did, with my usual Submission, not in the least suspecting his Design: But if I had, the least seeming Reluctance might have proved my Ruin. He then placed himself on the opposite Side of the Tree, or∣dered me to sit down with my Back to the Tree, and after pulling my Arms backwards round it, tied them
<PB N="7" REF="007662_0006_102DB9ECC0F51248"/>
with a Deer's Sinew, then put on Leather Muffs on my Hands, to keep me from using my Fingers, and then tied them likewise together. I had the Mortification to find my Timerity only excited Ridicule and Laughter in my <HI>cruel Persecutors,</HI> who made Sport of my Miseries and mock'd at my Fears.</P>
<P>Being so intent upon my own Preservation, it may easily be imagined I could not be very attentive to the Fate of my unhappy Companion: I saw him however seized by the Indian who was with Capt. <HI>Jacob,</HI> whose Name was <HI>Jim,</HI> who with remorseless Cruelty gave him a Blow with the Back of his Tomahawk which stunn'd him; but before he fell, another was repeated in the same Manner, which brought him to the Ground, where he lay some Minutes motionless: The inhuman Wretch stood over him, in order to discover if any Signs of Life remain'd, and upon finding him stir, and put up his Hand to his Face to wipe off the Blood which quite blinded him, took up the same Tomahawk that had brought him thus near his End, and with one fatal Blow sunk it in his Skull. This tragical Scene renewed their Sport, they af∣fecting to imitate his expiring Agonies: There remained nothing now to compleat their inhuman Barbarity but to scalp him which was done almost in an Instant. It is im∣possible to describe my Horror on seeing this: Death at∣tended with its most frightful Terrors stared me in the Face, and I even wished I had been so happy as to have been first out of Pain, and not lived to see what I un∣doubtedly thought next Moment would be my own Fate thus barbarously acted in that of my Companion. The cruel Monsters all over besmared with his Blood advanced towards me, and told me with an Air of Insult, nothing out my good Behaviour for the future, should save me from the same Treatment; and so untied my Hands, which were so benum'd that I hardly ever expected to be able to use them.</P>
<P>We now advanced again towards my House, and in a little Time came within Sight of it! But alas! with what Regret did I introduce my Guests to my poor Wife:
<PB N="8" REF="007662_0007_102DB9EEEAC8CDF8"/>
She, poor Thing, upon seeing them, had like to have fallen into Fits. I gave her all the Consolation I was able, tho' Horror and Despair was visible in my very Looks: I told her, Cries and Tears would now avail nothing, and she could not better recommend herself to our Master's Favour, than by being chearful, and rea∣dy to obey. Whilst I was thus employed the <HI>Indians</HI> were busied in ransacking the House from Top to Bot∣tom, of every Thing they thought worth taking, and after they had made up a Sack of Meal for me, and a Bundle of Clothes for my Wife to carry, commanded us to depart. Here our Grief was again renewed on leaving our House, Stock, Grain, and in short our All, behind us, without being able to depute any one to take Care of them in our Absence, or the most distant Prospect of ever re∣turning to them. These Reflections however just, availed us Nothing, for before we left Sight of the House, the Captain ordered <HI>Jim,</HI> to return and set Fire to it, which he did so effectually, that in a few Minutes the whole was in a Blaze. As complaining of this Hardship to our cruel Persecutors would have no more effect than speaking to the Wind, we addressed ourselves to the ALMIGHTY for his Protection, with a becoming Refignation to whatever might be our Fate; when we set off from my House it was about 3 o'Clock in the Afternoon, we directed our Course right back in the Woods about Half a Mile, they bid us put down our Luggage, and the Captain ordered <HI>Jim</HI> and me to go and hunt Horses to carry my Wife and the Luggage, which we accordingly did, but not getting any, we went to the aforesaid <HI>Hicks</HI>s, and in go∣ing down the Lane towards the House <HI>Jim</HI> took hold of me by the Shoulder, and in approaching the House al∣ways kept me between him and it, thinking they would not shoot at me, and if they did, I should screne him from the Shot; when we came up to the Door of the House, which was open, he quitted me, and jump'd in∣to the House, with his Tomahawk in one Hand and Gun in the other, but found the People all gone, for on the Alarm aforesaid, the whole of the Family, seven in
<PB N="9" REF="007662_0008_102DB9F07258EA80"/>
Number, had deserted the House, and were making to∣wards a Fort, but, unhappily for them, fell in with another Party of said <HI>Indians,</HI> who murdered two of them, and took the rest Prisoners [as I afterwards was in∣formed by the Inhabitants of <HI>Conecochieg.</HI>] When he found that the House was deserted, he rumaged up such Things as pleased him best, and carried 'em to some Dis∣tance where he laid them down, then he set Fire to the House, and ordered me to gather up all things that were of Use to the Owners and put them therein, and at the same Time bid me set Fire to the Barn, in which was a large Quantity of Grain, and likewise to several Barracks of Grain and Fodder, that stood by it, which I seem'd heartily to comply with, but purposely avoided firing the Barn and Grain by employing myself in gathering up the first-mentioned, and burning them. When all Things were thrown in the Fire that was near the House, we went to make up our Bundles in order to make off, but <HI>Jim</HI> by looking about him, discovered that the Barn, &amp;c. were not fired according to his Orders; he ask'd me what was the Reason I had not done it? I excus'd myself by telling him I was fully employ'd in burning the other Things: he then hastily ran and took a Brand of Fire, and quickly set them all in Flames. We then made the best of our Way with the Plunder to the Place where we had left Capt. <HI>Jacob</HI> and my Wife, found their Bundles, but they gone; while I was conjecturing the Reason, <HI>Jim</HI> gave a Whistle, and the Capt. answer'd (who had mov'd himself to some Distance, for Security, lest I should by some Means or other kill <HI>Jim,</HI> and bring the white People upon him.) When we discovered where they were, we ran to him, and <HI>Jim</HI> related our Success, and told how well (as he said) I had behaved. Upon which the Capt. gave me his Hand, and said, <HI>Well done Brother, you shall go to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with us To-morrow.</HI></P>
<P>My Wife's Relation of what passed betwixt her and Capt. <HI>Jacob,</HI> after I and <HI>Jim</HI> went to catch Horses, is as follows: <HI>She was very uneasy to be left alone with Capt.</HI> Jacob, <HI>and wanted to go after us to help catch the Horses;
<PB N="10" REF="007662_0009_102DB9F31BC396F8"/>
but he would not suffer it, saying, She was not able, and she must stay with him till we returned, further adding, that she need not be afraid of him for he would not hurt her; he then threw a Shirt of mine to her, and an old Petticoat, ordered her to strip and put on the Shirt and Petticoat, which she complied with, and while she was do∣ing it, he turn'd his Back on her, and went to some distance with the other Indian's Bundle, and plunder'd it of such Things as he liked. When he return'd he took the Cloths she pull'd off and put them in his Bundle, and bid her not to tell</HI> Jim <HI>what he had done; then they mov'd off to some Distance, where we found them.</HI></P>
<P>About Sun-down we pitched on a Place for our Lodg∣ing, and our next Business was to get Wood and make a Fire, round which we sat without Distinction; which to Persons in our Circumstances, may be esteemed a Mark of no small Condescention.</P>
<P>My Wife being embold'ned by the Familiarity of our Masters ask'd them several Questions touching their Rea∣sons for using the <HI>English</HI> as they did, seeing they had always treated the <HI>Indians</HI> (particularly the <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Shawanese</HI>) with the greatest Friendship: To this they answered, <HI>That when a Number of</HI> Indians <HI>offered to join G—l</HI> B—k <HI>against the</HI> French, <HI>he did not use them well, and had threatned to destroy all the</HI> Indians <HI>on the Continent, after they had conquered the</HI> French, <HI>and they were informed by the</HI> French, <HI>the</HI> Pennsylvanians, Marylanders <HI>and</HI> Virginians <HI>had laid the same Plot.</HI> She then asked, what they intended to do with those they took Prisoners: To which the Captain answered, <HI>That they had been order'd by the</HI> French <HI>to bring them all to the</HI> Ohio, <HI>when you get there, you shall live well, and be given as Kindred to our Friends.</HI> (Which I did not be∣lieve, as they told my Wife one Story, and me another; but expected every Moment to be sacrisic'd by them; yet so far as I could learn, the <HI>French</HI> were to allow them a certain Sum per Scalp and for Prisoners, if they were young, and fit for Business; but the old People and Chil∣dren they kill'd and scalped, as well as such as were re∣fractory
<PB N="11" REF="007662_0010_102DB9F5475F5440"/>
and not willing to go with them.) She then asked them if they did not think it a Sin to shed so much innocent Blood? They answered, <HI>That the</HI> French <HI>were better off than the</HI> English, <HI>for they had a great many old Men among them that could forgive all their Sins, and these Men had often assured the</HI> Indians <HI>it was no Sin to destroy Hereticks, and all the</HI> English <HI>were such. They then told me not to be afraid that they should abuse my Wife, for they would not do it for Fear of affronting their God,</HI> (and pointed their Hands towards Heaven) <HI>for the Man that affronts his God, will surely be kill'd when he goes out to War; this,</HI> (continued they,) <HI>is what makes the</HI> English <HI>have such bad Luck.</HI></P>
<P>They sat up eating Bread and Cheese, and dry'd Peaches, and smoking Tobacco, (which they got at <HI>Hicks'</HI>s,) hav∣ing had no Tobacco, as they told us, for four or five Days, and were in great Want of it. While they were thus em∣ploy'd, I heard a Noise, which I could not tell the Reason of. The <HI>Indians</HI> observing my listening, said, <HI>It is no∣thing but the Spirit of that Son of a Whore whom we kill'd.</HI> My Wife then ask'd them if they were not afraid of his Spirit? They answered, <HI>No! for they were fre∣quently us'd to see them, not only of white People, but of the</HI> Indian <HI>Nations they were at War with; but that Spirits could not hurt them.</HI></P>
<P>About Two Hours before Day our Masters being tired with Acts of Cruelty, began to think of composing them∣selves to Rest. They first shewed us where and how to lie, then lay down themselves with their Guns under them, lest we might use them to their Prejudice: Being thus disposed, it was not long before they fell into a deep Sleep, which my Wife being watchful to observe, began to think on making use of the Opportunity put into our Hands of making an Escape: She communicated her Sentiments in Whispers to me, and it is reasonable to think, I should readily concur in whatever might have a Prospect of accomplishing what I so ardently desired: But as a Mis∣carriage in an Attempt of this Nature would infallibly have proved our Ruin, common Prudence required we
<PB N="12" REF="007662_0011_102DB9F77653DE10"/>
should act cautiously, and be sure they were in reality in as deep a Slumber as they pretended to be: To this end, we got up, and went to the Fire, under Pretence of mend∣ing it, and warming ourselves, (and indeed we stood in need of it having nothing to defend us from the Incle∣mency of the Weather, but a single Blanket.) In all which we made so much Bustle and Noise, as we judged might awake Persons in an ordinary Sleep: But finding they still snoared on, I took up a Tankard, and told my Wife I would go towards a Spring, at which I had been fre∣quently before, and if after I had got there they still slept on, desired she might follow: And added, that if they should awake e're we got off, our having the Tankard might convince them we really wanted to quench our Thirst.</P>
<P>When we took leave of our cold Lodging, we had no Intention of separating: For tho' we left the Fire at dif∣ferent Times we intended to meet at the Spring: But after I had got there, and waited some Time, I at last saw her a coming, I threw down my Tankard intending to hide myself on the other Side the Run in a Thicket, till she came up; but in my Hurry, I ran against a Sap∣pling which stunn'd me, and I lay in this Condition some Time (during which I suppose my Wife came to the Run and not finding me made the best of her Way off.) When I recovered, I went on in the best Manner I could till Day began to dawn, when I found myself within Sight of a House to my unspeakable Joy: When I ad∣vanced near it I knew the Place, which however was quite abandoned by the Dwellers.</P>
<P>Having now a tolerable good Knowledge of my Situa∣tion I made directly to the next inhabited Part of <HI>Coneco∣chieg,</HI> when I got there, I was informed that a Company of Three Hundred Men from Marsh-Creek were out in quest of the Enemy under Colonel <HI>Hamilton,</HI> I joined myself as soon as I could with these, intending to return with them and try to find out my Wife, with whose Con∣dition I was now more affected, being out of Danger my∣self.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="007662_0012_102DB9F99CDE1748"/>
We went on viewing the Devastation, till we came to <HI>Adam McConnel'</HI>s Plantation, where we met with a Party of Ten Men, who had separated from this Com∣pany some Time before: These brought in a Woman who they said was found by them at an Oven in great Distress; and whom, upon my nearer Approach, to my unspeakable Surprize and Joy, I found to be my Wife.</P>
<P>After greeting each other in the most affectionate Man∣ner, with Tears of Joy, we returned Thanks to that in∣dulgent Being who led us safe through the Wilderness, and preserved us from the Jaws of Death. When she recovered her Transports, we desired a Relation of her Adventures from the unhappy Moment she and I parted; which she gave in Substance as follows:</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>An ACCOUNT of the surprizing Deliverance of Elizabeth Fleming, (Wife of William Fleming,) who was taken Captive by Capt. Jacob.</HEAD>
<P>A Few Minutes after my Husband was gone from the Fire, finding the <HI>Indians</HI> took no Notice of it, I concluded they were still asleep, and ac∣cording to my Promise followed him, but not finding him at the Spring, knew not which Course to steer, which threw me into the utmost Confusion; yet I re∣solved to make my Escape, and endeavoured for that Purpose; but really I seem'd in as bad a Situation as ever. <Q>How dreadful was this Night to me, an un∣happy Wanderer! With what Floods of Tears did I pass the Time? No Friend to relieve me, no Habita∣tion in which to shelter myself from the Inclemency of the Weather: My Husband gone I knew not where, and myself a wretched forlorn Wanderer, in Danger every Moment of falling a Prey to savage Fury, or torn to Pieces by ravenous wild Beasts. I either heard, or my frighted Imagination suggested, the hideous Roaring of Wolves, Bears and Panthers, which terri∣fied
<PB N="14" REF="007662_0013_102DB9FB52B88E88"/>
me almost to Death: Yet I was not so lost and overwhelmed as to be incapable of Reflection; I re∣membred there was a just, a merciful and an Almighty Power, who saw my Miseries, and knew I had not brought it on myself by any Imprudence, unless en∣deavouring to save my Life by Flight might be term∣ed such.</Q></P>
<P>However after I had wandered some Time, I came to a little Hill, which when I had ascended, found myself still nearer my Enemies than I desired, for I could plain∣ly perceive the Fire blaze, by the Light of which I saw them lie in the same Posture I left them. I made off with as much Precipitation as I could, and continued wandering till Day, during which Time I fell over a dead Man, which I concluded to be <HI>Hicks,</HI> and therefore di∣rected my Course accordingly for our own Corn-field, near the Remains of our House. The Joy however I conceived at this was soon allayed by hearing two <HI>Indian</HI> Holo's, and the Report of five Guns. Fancying myself now in the Jaws of Death, I made directly to some Heaps of Fodder, and hid myself, and lay there some Time; when I left this I directed my Course along a Path nine Miles to a Fort, but found it deserted, and every Thing about it in the greatest Disorder; concluding there was little Shelter to be had here, I ascended a Hill hard by, from the Top of which I imagined I should be able to discover some Settlements, or at least some Road that might lead that Way; but when I began to look about, I saw so many Houses in a Blaze that I almost concluded the whole Province was in Flames. The Smoke flew so thick that it darkened the very Air about me to that Degree, as to prevent me from distinguishing any Thing at a Distance from the Fires. <Q>Let any one figure to themselves the Melancholly of my Condition; no Hus∣band to relieve me, or eleviate my Grief! Yet how light, how trifling was all I now endured, to those Hardships which soon after I was obliged to bear.</Q></P>
<P>I soon after left the Hill, and was going I knew not where, when I came up to a House almost consumed to
<PB N="15" REF="007662_0014_102DB9FD73167DC0"/>
Ashes, and saw near it several Cows newly killed, by which I concluded the Enemy could not be far off; I ran to look for some Place in which to secure myself from their Fury, but could find none: I perceived one of the Cows these inhuman Butchers had shot was not quite dead, and as she lay almost close to a Fence, strctched myself down behind her; but had not been long in that Posture before I heard two Guns go off, by which I ap∣prehended the Enemy were advancing towards me, and consequently the Place in which I had now taken Refuge, could not be very safe: So I crept to a Thicket, where I lay till Half an Hour past Sun-down, when hearing all quiet round me, removed to an Oven, belonging to <HI>Ro∣bert McConnel,</HI> and after some Difficulty got into it, and rested about an Hour; but being terrified with frightful Thoughts, and not being able to reconcile myself to it longer, left it, with an Intention to go to the Top of another Hill. Before I got quite up, I happened una∣wares almost on a Fire, by the Side of which lay two <HI>Indians,</HI> with white Match-coats: The Sight almost frighted me to Death, but I had no other Shift than to run behind a Tree, where I stood trembling for near Half an Hour. As I had no Notion of being so near Ruin, I advanced carelesly on, and made so much Noise among the Leaves and Shrubs as I then apprehended a∣waked these Blood-hounds, who immediately started up, took up their Guns, then listened: I now resigned my∣self to the Will of Providence, thinking my Miseries near at an End, but all on a sudden they returned to their Fire making a loud Laugh; by this I found my Glass was not yet run. This Conduct at first appeared truly surprizing, for though indeed I now stood behind a Tree, I was al∣most fure they had seen me. Whilst I was thus con∣jecturing the Reason of the miraculous Preservation, I heard two or three Hogs grunt and stir among the Leaves (which my Fright had not suffered me before to ob∣serve) between whom and the Enemy I was behind a Tree, I concluded that it had been the Noise made by them they had been awaked. <Q>How wonderful, how mysterious,

are the Ways of Heaven? By what unseen, unguessed at Means are frequently the greatest Deliverances bro't about.</Q></P>
<P>Being thus surprizingly saved, I tarried behind the Tree till I judged the Enemy had got to sleep, and then made the best of my Way, blessing God for his remark∣able Deliverance, and wandred through the Woods till Day-break.</P>
<P>When I got pretty clear, I perceived a large Moun∣tain which I conjectured to be that between the Great and Little-Cove, and by the Idea I then formed of the Country and my own Situation, imagined going over it would be the nighest Way to the inhabited Parts. As the Road was very bad, and the Mountain at a conside∣rable Distance, it cost me great Difficulty to reach it; and before I got to the Top, found myself so feeble, and my Spirits so much sunk, that I was unable to proceed any further: So I lay down, whilst a cold Sweat poured off me, and I suffered all the Agonies of Mind, a Person in my Condition (being with Child) could undergo. I continued thus for Half an Hour, when being a little re∣vived I reflected that I must either endeavour to move farther, or inevitably perish: I attempted again to climb up, but my feet being all in Blisters, and the Mountain so inaccessible, that before I had got a Musquet-shot up, found it necessary to rest again: And thus I continued resting and crawling for about three Hours, till at length I attained the Summit; when I found myself so much spent with Fatigue and want of Food, that I was obliged to throw myself flat on my Face, and in that Posture lay for near an Hour. When I raised myself up, I espied some Chestnut Husks, and was in hopes of finding amongst them some Chestnuts; but found that Squirrels or other Vermin had deprived me of that Satisfaction. I then look∣ed around me in order to discover some Place that was inhabited, but the Sky was so darkned with Smoak, that I could only distinguish two Houses in Flames. <Q>It is im∣possible to defcribe the Horror of my Condition in this Place, which was augmented by my not knowing (even
<PB N="17" REF="007662_0016_102DB9FFCB4DAD40"/>
if I was able) which Side to turn to: Every Place I could lay my Eyes on, seemed to be filled with Deso∣lation and Ruin. A Train of melanchollic Reflections rushed on my Mind: I was even weary of Life, and could have wished my Being at an End: Yea I had nigh loaded the Day of my Birth with as many Impre∣cations as <HI>Job:</HI> And asked, <HI>Why was I reserved for so much Misery?</HI> It would indeed, have been utterly impossible for me to have <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> survived, weakned as I was by hard Living, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Fatigue I under∣went, had not that Almighty <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, who when we think him farthest off, is often nearest to us with his Aid, snatched my almost sinking Soul from the Mi∣series in which I had long been plunged and graciously encouraged me to hope Deliverence in his own good Time.</Q></P>
<P>Having thus given Vent to my Grief, by Tears and Reflection, I thought on returning whence I came; which I did in the best Manner I could: But before I had got two Miles, was overtaken by a Horse, who came after me full Speed, with his Bridle Head and a Bell on, and seemed to be very much frighted: I used my best Endeavours to stop and catch him, for I thought if I could once get on Horse-back, I should be able to make much greater Speed in my future searches: But he soon made his Way from me, and as I was not in a Condition to follow him, was obliged to drop all Thoughts of that Nature. Whilst I was thus engaged, I was alarmed by an Indian Holo, by which I judged the Owner of the Horse had fell a Prey to these Blood-thirsty Wretches, and consequently they could not be far from me: I was now at my Wits-end to find a Place of Shelter, being afraid even to look about me, lest I might see them at my Back: I hasted on with my crawling Speed, till I came to a large Gum Tree, into which I crept, tho' with much Difficulty: It was well however I got in at any Rate, for I heard the Feet of two <HI>Indians,</HI> and saw them pass pretty near me; they were too intent in Pursuit of the Horse to look much about, which if they had, I should unavoidably have been disco∣vered;
<PB N="18" REF="007662_0017_102DBA02C92D1730"/>
but as Providence ordered it, I was safe, judged it best to lie here a considerable Time, that so the Enemy might get a good Way off. Whilst I lay here, I heard the Report of two Guns, which was accompanied with a terrible Shriek. <Q>Every Moment of my Time now seemed precious, and I thought so much of it as was spent in any one Place, save the mere Necessity of sav∣ing myself from Danger, lost;</Q> so I got myself out, and wandered better than a Mile through a great Thicket till I came to a small Path, which I gladly pursued, but unfortunately went the wrong Way in it, which I was not sensible of, till I had gone about a Mile and a Half, when I found the Path end in the Woods. Now again I was put to a Nonplus, and burst into Tears at my Disap∣pointment.</P>
<P><Q>To wander again in the Wilderness seemed certain Death, and to return the same long Way I came afforded a Prospect little better; yet maimed as I was, I think I could have chearfully gone many Miles, if I had done it on my Knees, to have met with my Husband, or any one in a Condition to relieve me: But I was now forlorn in the Wilderness, and had no other Com∣fort than to sit down on the cold Earth, indulge my usual melanchollic Reflections, and bathe my bleeding Feet with my Tears.</Q>—This being done, I tore off a few of the remaining Rags (for the Bushes had nigh de∣prived me of most of them) that my merciless Ravagers thought not worth taking from me, and with the Hem of my tottered Petticoat (for Gown I had none) tied them round my Feet, and returned the same Way, and con∣tinued my Course till I got to a Corn-field, where I found three Ears of Corn: I saw several Stacks of Fod∣der, but was afraid to take up my Lodging in them, lest when the Indians came that way they might set Fire to them; for they seem'd to make it a Rule from their first setting out to destroy every Thing of Value they met with: So I took two or three Arm-fulls, carried it to a good Distance, and laid it by a Fence, and so crept a∣mongst it, conjecturing they would not, if they saw it,
<PB N="19" REF="007662_0018_102DBA045A0E8840"/>
think it worth their while to set Fire to so small a Heap; and in this was my Lodging three Days and three Nights nor daring to stir much out all that Time, as I repeated∣ly heard the Report of Guns and Indian Holo's: But indeed, if I had not been prevented through Fear, I was now so spent and fatigued, that I found it absolutely necessary to cease rambling till I got recruited; though alas! I had but a poor Prospect of this, for I was almost famished to Death, having had nothing to live upon but the three Ears of Indian Corn aforesaid, and as I knew not when or where to get more, was obliged as it were to count the Grains I eat.</P>
<P>On the Third Night of my being in this lonely Lodg∣ing, I heard a Cock crow and a Dog bark, and next Morning made towards the Place I heard them at; but after I had got the Length of the Field, saw three Trees which appeared to be newly set on Fire: so I lay down about an Hour by the Fence, in which Time I heard 3 Guns go off about a Mile above me: However hearing no more Noise, I made towards a House, which apeared on my nearer approach, to be a Stable, all the Houses being burnt: This Place I found afterwards belonged to one Donaldson: I here found some Fowls, and attempted to catch one of them, but they were too nimble for me; then I went into the Garden, where I made a very plenti∣ful Meal of green Keal and Parsley: I then went to the Spring, and drank about three Pints of Water) not hav∣ing seen any for several Days before) I then crept into the Oven (which was left standing by the Savages) and slept pretty soundly till Midnight, at which Time I awoke and hearing Cock crow, made to the Stable, and caught one, and dressed it by some burning Logs of the Dwel∣ling house. But alas the very Smell of the Fowl so overcame me, that I was ready to faint several Times ere it was ready; so I put it whole into my Handker∣chief, and returned to the Oven, where I slept till Day when I got out and went again in Search of inhabited Houses. After I had got about Half a Mile, I heard a Man whistle, which at first I took to be a white Man's Whistle,
<PB N="20" REF="007662_0019_102DBA0698AFB3C0"/>
but upon listening more attentive, had Reason to believe it an Indian Decoy; so I hasted back to my Lodging, and had not been in it long before I heard the Noise of Horses, and the Voices of several white Men, which made me look out, and seeing one pass by at some Distance, I cried out to him for God's sake to pity my distressed Condi∣tion, and take me under his Protection: The good Man being startled at my sudden Appearance, and the strange Figure I cut (being entirely in Rags, and as black as any Chimney-sweep) presented his Gun, and if it had not miss'd Fire, he would certainly have deprived me of that wretched Life I had gone through so many Difficulties to preserve; another of the Company perceiving it, cryed out, <HI>Hold, hold, she is a white Woman by her Voice.</HI> Soon after they all came up to me, and I found them to be a Party of ten Men, separated from a Marsh Creek Great Company of three Hundred. One of them (Mr. <HI>Dickey,</HI>) was so kind as to take me up behind him on his Horse, and after tying me on with a Belt (for I was so weak as not to be able to sit) took me about three Miles to his House, where I got refreshed with warm Milk, and such Things as I was able to take, and this Morning was brought to this Place; but what is my Astonishment and Joy when here my Eyes are once more blessed with the Sight of my Husband! [<HI>Surely, they might well cry out with</HI> David, <HI>the devout Psalmist! I cried unto the LORD with my Voice, and he heard me out of his holy Hill.</HI>]</P>
