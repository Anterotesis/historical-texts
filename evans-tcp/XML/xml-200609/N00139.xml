<Q><HI>Nay, in all these Things we are more then Conquerors, through him that loved us.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN these Words we have the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI>s not <HI>Ovation, but Triumph,</HI> not <HI>Triumph</HI> only, but <HI>Something,</HI> (I know not how to word it) Exhibited in the Name and on the Behalf of Himself and all true Believers, Indigitating and Importing a more then ordinary Tryumph over all those Enemies that oppose themselves against the Progress and Advance of a Christian in his way to the Fruition of the sweet Fruits of the Everlasting Love of God in Jesus Christ. Having per∣spicuously, copiously, and demonstratively assorted and vindicated the illu∣strious Doctrine of Justification in a way of <HI>Free Grace</HI> by Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, in the beginning of this excellent Epistle, which is ingeni∣ously stiled by the great <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lancthon, the Confession of the Reformed Chur∣ches:</HI> he proceeds in the sixth Chapter to Discourse of the Fruits and Con∣sequents thereof▪ namely, <HI>Sanctification</HI> and <HI>Obedience;</HI> the Mortification of indwelling sin in Believers, and the renovation, or rather infusion of a new Principle of <HI>Spiritual Life</HI> and <HI>Holiness.</HI> Now because this work is but inchoate and imperfect, and in part only transacted in this World; and there are remainders of sin in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the best of Saints; and because <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Corruption</HI> are vigorous, active, operative Principles, dwelling so near together, under the same Roof, in the same Soul, yea in the very same Faculties: there must needs arise a sharp and severe War in the Soul be∣tween these two Neighbouring and Opposite Natures, the particular events and successes whereof are various and uncertain; but the Victory is infal∣libly determined in the issue on the side of <HI>Grace. Grace</HI> indeed is greatly beset, hardly bestead, much incumbred and almost overthrown at some sea∣sons: but it will certainly <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> wrestle and recover it self out of all the dangers that threaten it. Now there is a double War which is commenced and waged by Believers in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fe. A War <HI>with the evil of sin,</HI> and a War <HI>with the evil of suffrings</HI> or <HI>affections</HI> so far as they would impede or do op∣pose them in their Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch to Heaven. Of the War <HI>with sin, indwelling sin:</HI> (th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in-bred, home bred Enemy, that Mother of all the <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ominations</HI> that are brought forth in the lives of Men, that Adversary that is ever molesting the peace, disturbing the quset, and endangering the condition of the People of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/>
<PB N="2" REF="000195_0007_0FA316C7C590E958"/>
of this Epistle: where he finally adjudges the victory to <HI>Grace,</HI> in the last verse of that, and in the beginning of the eight Chapter also. <HI>Of the War with Affliction▪ or the evil of suffering: from Satan, or the World, from what hand, of what kind▪ and howsoever conditioned and circumstanced;</HI> he Discourseth Admirably, at the seventeenth verse of this Chapter and so forwards, and he comes in the procedure of his Discourse to give unquestionable Assurance to the good Souldiers of Jesus Christ, of the full and final decision of this grand Controversie, and the happy issuing of all these hazardous conflicts, whether with sin or sufferings, in a glorious and absolute victory: Insomuch as having made sure of God on the side of him∣self and Believers, he doth in his own and their Name make an open Chal∣lenge, and bid defiance to all opposite and adverse powers, <HI>ver.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. <HI>If God befor us who then can be against us?</HI> He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ids Sin, Satan, and an evil World do their worst against Believers that are thus entrenched in, and walled a∣bout with the Love of God; thus fortified and defended, aided and assisted by the Almighty one, the <HI>Lord of Hosts.</HI> And having laid his foundation in Gods Predestination, and Christs Mediation, he superstructs upon it, and plainly asserts the invincibleness of every sound Believer, notwithstanding the Relicks of sin that incumber him, the Temptations of Satan that molest him, and the afflictions and evils of the World that set themselves in Battel aray against Him. He represents to us the Christian as a person that may be opposed, combated and contended withal: but never routed, run down, totally defeated or overthrown in any Engagement. Now this invincible∣ness of the Christian Combatant, the Believing Champion (that in the Name of the Lord defies all the Hosts and Armies of Earth and Hell that come against him) notwithstanding the Remainders of sin, the greatness and unavoidableness of his Afflictions and Sufferings, is expressed,</P>
<P N="1">1. Negatively, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> 35. <HI>Who shall separate us from the Love of Christ?</HI> The Argument stands thus▪ if nothing can separate a Christian from the Love of God in Christ, then nothing can conquer him, but he is invincible. But nothing can make that woful destructive separation: which he proves by an enumeration or induction of particulars; <HI>shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution,</HI> &amp;c. therefore he is invincible. This negation is clearly im∣ported in the interrogation. For though it may be a <HI>stale,</HI> yet it is a <HI>true</HI> and <HI>useful</HI> observation, that interrogations affirmatively expres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in Scripture are wont to carry in them the force and signification of vehement negations. The meaning of the Apostle in plain terms is, that neither <HI>Tribulation,</HI> nor <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> nor <HI>Persecution,</HI> nor F<HI>amine,</HI> nor <HI>Nakedness,</HI> nor <HI>Peril,</HI> nor <HI>Sword,</HI> nor any thing else of an <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> nature</HI> can possibly separate a true Believer from the dear love of Jesus Christ.</P>
<P N="2">2. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, in the Words of the Text; <HI>Nay in all these things we
<PB N="3" REF="000195_0008_0FA316C88A7E3010"/>
are more then Conquerours through him that loved us.</HI> As if he should say: we are so farre from being worsted and prevailed over by the Enemies of our Salvation that warre against us, from succumbing under the Load they are laying upon us, and losing our Interest in the Fruits of the Everlasting Love of God in Christ, by Reason of the opposition that is made against us in our way, that we carry the Day, and are sure of a very glorious victory:</P>
<P>In this Verse we may remark these two things.</P>
<P N="1"> 1. <HI>A singular Priviledge:</HI> And that is <HI>Victory</HI> &amp; <HI>Conquest,</HI> which is illustrated &amp; amplified, (1.) <HI>From the Extent and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of it.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n all these things:</HI> such as he had mentioned before, or what else can be men∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ioned and imagined by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> (2.) <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the transcendent incomparable Excellen∣cy of it. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> we are more then Conquerours,</HI> or do more then over∣come. It is a <HI>Victory,</HI> with <HI>Surplusage</HI> and <HI>Advantage,</HI> a Victory, and some∣what more then a <HI>Victory: a Superlative and incomparable Conquest and Vi∣ctory that is obtained.</HI> (3.) <HI>From the Foundation of this glorious Victory,</HI> or the great and only means of acquiring and obtaining it. And that is, The Lord Jesus Christ. <HI>Through him that loved us,</HI> saith the Apostle: meaning <HI>Christ,</HI> or <HI>God in Christ Jesus.</HI> (4.) <HI>From the first, grand, impulsive cause of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it,</HI> the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Cause of this glorious Victory which is infallibly ob∣tained, and that is, the Love of God in Christ. The special love of God in his Son Jesus Christ is the first Cause of these victorious Atchievments. <HI>More then Conquerours through Him that loved us.</HI></P>

All that have believed through Grace, and are admitted into a state of Justi∣fication and Acceptation with the Lord <HI>are more then Conquerours,</HI> successful and victorious beyond Expression or Comparison, in their Combates and Conflicts with their Enemies (those adverse powers that warre against them) through Divine Love in Jesus Christ. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Proposition which we have laid down, as the Subject of our present Exercise, and which is evi∣dently founded and comprized in the words of the Text, hath a large Com∣pass and a very great Circum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erence, as you will readily apprehend. We are now entring into a very large Field, and might traverse a great deal of Ground, if Time and strength would allow us to pace it over. We have many Things before us to be discoursed for the due Explication and Confir∣mation of this observation. The way of quickest dispatch, and greatest Ex∣pedition, as well as Clearness, and Demonstration, will be to cast all we have to say to the Doctrinal part into Six or Seven grand Conclusions.</P>
<P>Concl. 1. <HI>Every true Believer is a Souldier, and engaged in a Warfare.</HI> I would it were reciprocally true, that every Souldier amongst us is a true Be∣liever. I am sure every Souldier ought to be a Believer: and of all men Mi∣litary men, when they are commanded out upon real Service, to look Death and Danger in the Face, and carry their Lives in their Hands, had need of Faith and Grace, and Interest in the Lord Jesus Christ, and thereby the Con∣dition of their Souls well secured for Eternity But it is Infallibly and Uni∣versally true, that every Believer is a Souldier in a spiritual Consideration. The whole Body of Christians that walk by Faith in this lower World, the place of Sin, and Sorrow, and Temptation, and Absence from the Lord, is apt∣ly and truly called the <HI>Church Militant</HI> in Contra-Distinction from that which is <HI>Triumphant</HI> in the highest Heavens. Those that are arrived at a state of Glory have fought their fight, and finished the Course of their War∣fare, and are <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> out of push of Pike or Gunshot, farre enough removed out of the Reach of their Adversaries. They are marched out of the Field, and discharged from any further Service, and enjoying their Reward. But the people of God in this world are in a warfaring state and Condition. The first moment that any man is effectually called and converted, and sa∣vingly wrought upon, He is engaged on Christs side against the world, the Flesh, and the Devil, taken into Christs pay, puts on his Armour, and is pre∣pared for the Battel. For the Graces of Gods Spirit, which are infused at a Christians Conversion, are a Believers spiritual Armour, <HI>Eph</HI> 6 13, 14, &amp;c. Every Christian when he is new Born is born a Souldier. It is said of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> the Philistine Champion, <HI>that he was a Man of warre from his youth,</HI> 1 Sam. 17 33. But it may be truly said of the Christian Champion, <HI>that He is a Man of warre from his Birth</HI> Neither is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aked Creature, as it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with the Children of the first <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: but He comes into the new world in his
<PB N="5" REF="000195_0010_0FA316CA05599548"/>
Suit of Armour, armed <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> with compleat Armour of Proof, being vested with the Graces of the Spirit of Christ. He hath his excellent and in∣vincible <HI>General,</HI> the Lord Jesus Christ; and hath taken his <HI>Sacrament<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ilitare,</HI> his Oath of Fidelity and Obedience to his great <HI>Lord General.</HI> He hath also (if there be opportunity, and he walk orderly) his <HI>Company</HI> that he is listed into, the <HI>Church,</HI> I mean, He walks in Fellowship with: or at least He is inrolled among the Members of the <HI>Church-Militant</HI> in gene∣ral. He hath his <HI>Banner</HI> to fight under: even the love of Christ displayed for a Defence to his Souldiers and Followers, and a Flag of Defiance to their Adversaries, <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 4. He hath his <HI>Arms</HI> and <HI>Weapons,</HI> offensive and de∣fensive to fight withal. He hath his <HI>Souldierly Qualifications,</HI> and milita∣ry Accomplishments; Courage, Skill, Patience, Hope of victory, Faithful∣ness to, and Confidence in his General, Orderliness, Disposition to endure Hardship, or whatever else may be mentioned. Every wicked man indeed is a Souldier, but he fights against God, strengthens himself, and stretches out his hand against the Almighty, <HI>and ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>neth on his Neck, and upon the thick bosses of his Bucklers,</HI> Job. 15 25, 26. He fights against himself and his own Soul, keeping those Lusts in pay that <HI>warre against the Soul,</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 11. He puts on the whole Armour of the Devil, that He may be able to stand against all the Shocks of Conscience, or encounters of the Word and Spi∣rit of God, and fight it out to the last with the Infinite Majesty, to the ever∣lasting Ruine of his Immortal Soul. But he is neither engaged in, nor pro∣vided and accomplished for the <HI>Holy Warre</HI> we are discoursing of. He that is not a Believer is a conquered, disarmed slave, that must drudge in the Service of the Enemies of his Soul, and is in no Condition of fighting with them. It He begin to bestir himself (through the Convictions, awaken∣ings and Alarms of Conscience) and to hold up his Hand, or make any Re∣sistance, He is knock'd down and overcome presently, and made more them a Captive (as the Believer is said to be <HI>more then a Conquerour</HI>) ten times more a Vassal and Drudge to his Lusts, and other Enemies then before. But a Believer is a man of Warre, a Souldier well appointed, in a good Ca∣pacity and Condition to dispute it our with any of his Adversaries.</P>
<P>Concl. 2. <HI>Every true Believer hath constant fighting work before him.</HI> There is no End of his warre in this world, nor any time wherein He may give over fighting.</P>

<P>It is not so with other Souldiers. <HI>There is a Time when Kings go forth to Battel,</HI> 2 Sam. 11. 1. And there is a Time when they disband their Armies, or draw them into their winter Quarters, or make a Cessation of all Acts of Hostility by Leag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es or Truces.

He cannot assure himself of any Respite or Intermission in the Course of his war∣fare. This may be convincingly made out in three or four Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Every Believer reacheth after, march<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h towards the perfect enjoyment of the blessed Fruits of the everlasting, Love of God.</HI> This is the prize He runs for, the Crown he fights for, <HI>the Recompeace of reward He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath respect</HI> unto, the End and Arm of his Race and wrestling. He is in his Journey or upon his March towards <HI>that City which hath Foundations (Heb.</HI> 11. 10.) that <HI>better Country,</HI> where He may enjoy the glorious Fruits of the peculiar <HI>L</HI> ove of God in perfection. Every Christian is in a way<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aring state, and declares plainly (by the course he shapes and steers) that he is a Stranger her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and <HI>seeking a Country, Heb.</HI> 11. 14, travelling towards the Heavenly <HI>Canaan,</HI> and the face of his soul is set towards that <HI>Jerusalem whichis above.</HI> He hath Grace and Glory in his Eye, and is engaged in a close and eager pursuit of Happiness. The end of his Faith and Holy Conversation is the Salvation of his Soul, and the perfect and perpetual Fruition of the Love of God in the brightest discoveries and richest effusions of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Every Believer meets with great opposition in his March and way to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od aforesaid from Enemies that make Head against Him, and do what they can to seperate Him from the Love of God in Christ Jesus.</HI> He meets with numerous Adversaries that design and drive at this to hinder Himself and the Rest of Gods people in their Travels to <HI>Canaan,</HI> to divert and turn them out of the Road of Holiness and Obedience, which leads to Happiness, to pluck them (if it were possible) out of Gods Hand, to tear them out of his loving Embraces, to cut them short of the blessed Fruition of the Love of God in Christ. God leads every Believer, as it were, through the <HI>Land of the Philistines</HI> where they must see Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re, and brings Him to the Heaven∣ly <HI>Canaan</HI> that way. And he meets with this Opposition▪</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>From Himself, and that sin that dwells in H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m.</HI> From his own Heart and Nature, as it is depraved and vitiated: from his natural corruption, or that sin that is inlaid and radicated in his Nature. This is the principal, the Capital, the Grand Enemy, that is bred in his Bowels, raising <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> civil Warrs, without which his forreign Enemies, the Rest of his Adversa∣ries could do Him no Hart, nor make any considerable Head against Him. It was the great Advantage of the <HI>Captain of our Salvation</HI> (as our Saviour is called, <HI>Heb.</HI> 2. 10.) in all his Engagements with Satan and his Instruments, <HI>that He was Holy, Harmless, undefiled, and separate from Sinners,</HI> Heb. 7. 26. <HI>that He know no sin,</HI> 2 Cor. 5 21. that He had no sin in Him. Hence it was that just before his last and greatest Encounter with Satan, He tells his Disciples, <HI>The Prince of this world cometh and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> nothing in me,</HI> Joh. 14▪ 30.
<PB N="7" REF="000195_0012_0FA316CB8727ECA8"/>
There was nothing in our Lord Jesus that complied with, or was suitable to the temptations of the God of this World: nothing to close with his sug∣gestions, or entertain his Terrours: the Enemy without had no correspon∣dents within him, Satan could not lay hands, or fas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en a Temptation upon him. Christ threw him off with ease in this respect. Hence he was tem∣pted indeed in all points, <HI>like as we are,</HI>) <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t without sin,</HI> Heb. 4. 15. Tempta∣tion to Christ was like throwing a But upon a Chrystal Glasse, which will not stick, but glides off. But alas <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the sin of our Natures is Satans strength and ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>antage. He finds enough in the best of Believers, that found nothing in our Saviour. Satans sparks easily enflame us, because he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inds so much Tinder in us. The Lusts within us are ready to take fire at every injection. There is a Traitour in our own Bowels that is ready to open our Ports, and let in the Adversary. Now of the War which a Christian wages with this home-bred, intestine Enemy, the seventh Chapter of this <HI>Epistle</HI> to the <HI>Romans</HI> gives <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s a clear account: where the Apostle <HI>raises an Out-cry,</HI> and makes <HI>Doleful Complaints of the remainders of sin, the Law in the Members, the body of Sin and Death,</HI> and Discourseth of the <HI>Nature, Power and Pre∣valency of in-dwelling sin, as to some engagements.</HI> The Apostle <HI>James</HI> speaks <HI>of the Lusts that War in our Members,</HI> Jam. 4. 1. And <HI>Peter of fleshly Lusts that war against the Soul,</HI> 1 Pet. 2. 11. these make up that opposite party within a Christian that would intercept and stop him in his way to Glory: a secret, subtle, treacherous, designing party that creates him a world of trouble and danger in his journey towards Heaven.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>From the World, which is another Enemy that would obviate and inter∣cept the People of God in their Travels.</HI> Hence the World was a part of Christ his glorious Conquest. <HI>Be of good chear, I have overcome the World,</HI> Joh. 16. 33. And the Believer that is born of God by Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ overcomes it too, 1 <HI>John</HI> 5. 4. which plainly implies <HI>that the World is an Enemy.</HI> Considerable are the Expressions of the Apostle to this pur∣pose, <HI>lam.</HI> 4. 4. <HI>know ye not that the friendship of the World is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a Friend of the World, is the Enemy of God.</HI> And doth it not follow hence, that he that is a Friend of God is an Enemy to the World, as it lies in opposition to God, and the World (in that respect) an Enemy to him? The World is one of the Associates of that false party within a Christian, and under the conduct of Satan militates against a <HI>Be∣liever.</HI> Particularly:</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Snares &amp; Allurements of the World which would toll away and se∣duce a Christian from following after God.</HI> These make war upon a Child of God, and are dangerous Enemies.

never doubt of Victory. Some Enemies have bought great Victories, which they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> never have won otherwise. All these things will I give thee, this profit, pleasure, Honour, (saith the flattering World to a Belie∣ver) if then walt fall down, or surrender to me. These ensnaring and allu∣ring Objects, which the world presents the Sons of Men with, have such a close and intimate correspondence with the Lusts in their Hearts, and what is carnal in them, that they fight against their Souls with great Advantage and Success. The Apostle having dehorted from the love of the World, and the things that are in the World, sums up all that is in the World in those three particulars, <HI>the lust of the Flesh, the lust of the Eyes, and the pride of Life.</HI> 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 2▪ 15, 16. The Apostle speaks as if there were nothing else in the world but <HI>Lusting:</HI> because there is such a curse come upon all Creature-enjoy∣ments with reference to man, that so farre as He is of the world, they are Objects of Lust to Him, exciting, drawing forth, invigorating and in pro∣ving that Lust and Corruption that is in him. By these Lusts the Apostle means the several respective Objects, and puts the Lust which is in us for the things themselves lusted after, <HI>Carnal pleasures, Profits</HI> and <HI>Preferments.</HI> He saith not sensual Pleasures, Riches, Honour (though he speaks of them) but the <HI>Lusts of the Flesh and Eye, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd pride of Life;</HI> because our Lusts ren∣der them evil to us (how lawful soever in themselves the Objects are) and make them Objects of Temptation and Seduction from the Lord, putting a painted Whorish Beauty and tempting Lustre upon them, varnishing them over and making false representations of them. Yea, <HI>it is evident</HI> (as the Judicious Dr. <HI>Owen</HI> observes Treatise of Temptat. <HI>pag.</HI> 68. <Q><HI>That all these things</HI> (the Lust of the Flesh, &amp;c.) <HI>are principally in the Subject, not in the Object; in the Heart not in the World: But they are said to be in the World, because the World gets into them, mixes it self with them, unites, in∣corporates. As Faith and the promises are said to be mixed,</HI> Heb. 4 2. <HI>So are Lust and Temptation</HI> (from worldly Objects) <HI>mixed; they twine together, receive mutual improvement one from another, grow each of them higher and higher by the mutual strength they administer to one another</HI></Q> from this mixture, Union, and Incorporation of the Objects in the World with the Lusts in the Hearts of Men, and the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> firm and close combination toge∣ther, it comes to pass that the enticing, tempting World is a very patent and prevailing Adversary to the Son's of Men▪ And that Believers themselves (in whom the Lusts mentioned are out in part mortified and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>) have hard work sometimes to stand their Ground against the snares and allurements and bewitching insinuations of and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> World.

The World hath Terrours to affright, as well as Allurements to entice Believers out of the way of Happiness. The men of the world are usually pricks in the eyes, and Thorns or Scourges in the sides of Believers. <HI>Briers</HI> and <HI>Thorns</HI> are <HI>with them</HI> in the world (as the Lord tells the Prophet, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 2. 6.) that will scratch the Face of their Reputation, wound them in their outward Concernments <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their Flesh: yea, they <HI>dwell among Scorpions,</HI> that will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to great torment, and sting them to Death. <HI>AElian</HI> reports concerning the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> do more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> that they were wont to sleep with their Boots on, lest the Scorpions, their Country was infested with, should sting them.

In both the respects mentioned the world is an Enemy, and makes Opposition to <HI>B</HI>elievers in their way to Glory. Furthermore a <HI>B</HI>eliever meets with Opposition,</P>

4. <HI>From Death it self, which is the last Enemy.</HI> 1 Cor. 15. 26. When all the rest are beaten out of the field, and a Christian is ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ching off and just ready to make his <HI>Triumphant Entrance</HI> into Heaven, <HI>Death</HI> encounters him. This comes in by the <HI>Curse:</HI> and the natural or direct tendency of it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o separate a Son of <HI>Adam</HI> from God for ever. It is the great and grim <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the vindictive justice of God. Here men enjoy some Fruits of (at least) the general and common goodness of God: but when Death comes, it pushes them away from God, makes an everlasting separation be∣tween them, and all the fruits of the goodness of God, turns them into Hell, where they must feed upon the bitter Fruit o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their own wayes for ever. When Death hath done its Execution upon the Condemned Sons and Daughters of <HI>Adam,</HI> God will then carry away all his goodness from them, and never afford them so much <HI>as one drop of Water to cool their Tongues to Eternity.</HI> That which makes Death <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o terrible is, that in the ordinary course of it, it makes a perfect and perpetual separation between the Sons and Daughters of men, and all the Fruits of the <HI>Love,</HI> and <HI>Goodness,</HI> and <HI>Patience</HI> of the blessed God. <HI>Death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned,</HI> Rom 5. 12. And where it Reigns and Triumphs, and is Victorious over any man, and fastens its <HI>Sting</HI> in him▪ (as I may allude to 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15 55.) it destroyes him utterly by putting him into a condition of everlasting sepa∣ration from God. Now this is the <HI>last Adversary</HI> that the Believing <HI>Chri∣stian Souldier</HI> contends withal; though upon more advantagious Terms then other men. Thus much for the second Particular under the second Conclu∣sion. <HI>Every Believer meets with great opposition in his way.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>A Believer cannot possibly make his way through all these Enemies, and bear down all this opposition without fighting.</HI> He skirmishes with these E∣nemies, yea, fights many a pitch'd Battel against them. <HI>He must put on the whole Armour of God,</HI> Eph 6. 11. and keep it on, and make use of the wea∣pons of his <HI>Christian Warfare,</HI> and his Faith and other Graces will be sound∣ly put to it. It costs him many a <HI>Bickering.</HI> He runs, and Wrestles, and labours, and strives, <HI>and fights the good fight of Faith:</HI> as we might demon∣strate by many Scripture Instances. By <HI>Fighting,</HI> I mean a vigorous con∣tending and conflicting with the Enemies of his Soul, which is exprest vari∣ously by the Holy Ghost in Scripture. He must strive hard that will <HI>enter in at the strait Gate,</HI> Luk. 13. 24. ordinary seeking will not do it.

But such is the case of a Christian, that he must not only work, with a Weapon in the other hand, but he must actually use his Weapon whilest he is working; fighting with one hand, and building or labouring with the other. If his Enemies conquer, they will be sure to prosecute their victory to the utmost, and lose no Advantage: if they be worsted and routed in any particular Engagement, they will not fail to rally their Forces, recruit and reinforce themselves presently and fall on again. So that a Chri∣stian had need eat and drink and sleep in his Arms.

Verily there is no discharge in this War∣fare on this side of the Grave. There is no bringing of these Enemies to a composition, no cessation to be made, no League or Truce to be admitted in this Warfare. A Christian must be constantly fighting and contending a∣gainst the Enemies of his peace and happiness. Thus much for the second Conclusion.</P>

38, 39. Importing thus much, that a Christian can never be totally conque∣red, notwithstanding all the opposition that is made against him. Let Ene∣mies do what they can against him, yet if he be not separated from the love of God, he is not absolutely Conquered, or defeated of his Happiness. <HI>I</HI>n this respect a Believer <HI>is never Conquered.</HI> For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Nothing befals him in his Warfare, notwithstanding what his Enemies attempt against him, that turns away the Heart of God utterly from him.</HI> Though Sin and Satan may prevail very far in some conflicts, yet never to such a degree as to provoke the Lord to reject him, and cast him out of his favour. God may be provoked by the compliances of a Believer at some turns with Sin and Satan and the World to take away the manifestations of his Love, to deny him some expressions of his Favour, <HI>to visit his transgressi∣ons with a Rod, and his iniquity with Stripes;</HI> but <HI>never to take his lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing∣kindness utterly from him,</HI> Psal. 8. 9. 30—33. A Believer may be so foiled and worsted by his Enemies, through the neglect of his watch, or otherwise, that God may be displeased with him; that there may be a discontinuance of the sensible expressions of the love of God to him, and an interruption of it as to manifestations: and yet there is no intercision of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>the love of God to him, as to the being of it. <HI>His love to him is unchangeable and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>verlasting.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Nothing fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s out in his progress or march that absolutely stops him in, or diverts him from his course of proceeding, or moving towards the enjoyment of the sweet fruits of Divine Love▪</HI> A Believer may be wounded, I amed, and retarded; but not totally checked in his way, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> aside from it.

Because he did not apply a timely Remedy unto them; they were not presently searched and looked after. He was knock'd down and lay in a swoon for a great while, that those about him might be ready to fear he would never come to himself again but he revived and recovered at last.

That general Bent &amp; Inclination of his heart towards God, <HI>as his lost end &amp; greatest good,</HI> &amp; towards his Command∣ments, as the only best Rules of living and walking, is ever preserved in the Believer by the mighty power of God (according to his Covenant-en∣gagement) even then when his Enemies have gotten him down and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid him at their Feet. So that if the Lord never take away his loving-kindness utterly from the Believer, nor the Believer totally lose his love to God: what follows? but that there can be no separation of a true Believer from the love of God in Christ Jesus, and by consequence that he cannot be ab∣solutely conquered <HI>in any,</HI> though he may be worsted in <HI>some</HI> Engagements.</P>
<P><HI>Conel.</HI> 4. <HI>Every true Believer manageth a successful War, and is sure of Conquest.</HI> My meaning is not that every Christian hath a certainty of per∣swasion that he shall prevail, or overcome; for many an one is ready to say sometimes <HI>that he shall one day fall by the ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of this or that Saul:</HI> but there is a certainty of the thing in it self. I speak of the certainty of the object, or the truth of this Proposition [Every Believer shall certainly conquer the Enemies of his Soul] not of the certainty of the Subject, the certioration of the Believer, or his perswasion and assurance that he shall be victorious at last. A Believer shall certainly win the day and conquer all Opposers, whatever his unbelieving heart may at any time suggest to the contrary. Hence <HI>Paul</HI> speaks of it as a thing done: <HI>we do more then overcome.</HI> This may be made out thus:</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>A Believer in this life gets many signal Victories.</HI> He is not able in∣deed utterly to drive out the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> they will abide in his Land (Heart, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me an) and be rebelling and vexing him frequently: but the Lord gives him many remarkable victories over them. There are some memorable dayes and happy times wherein the People of God come out of the Field victorious, and triumph over their spiritual Enemies. They <HI>set their feet in the neck of their Lusts, and lay their Corruptions bleeding at their feet,</HI> and do so resist▪ Satan as to <HI>rout him and put him to flight.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>If he be for a time overcome, yet he recovers himself at last and gets the Day.</HI> He may be overcome, <HI>and carried Captive</HI> (as the Apostle intimates Rom. 7. 23.) he may be remarkably worsted in some particular conflicts, and taken Prisoner: but he cannot be detained alwayes a Prisoner, all the power and policy of his Adversaries cannot hold him, he will make an escape from them sooner or later, and obtain rescue and deliverance. If he be foiled, and laid on his back for a time; yet it is not long before he reco∣vers himself, and gets up again by godly sorrow, Humiliation and Repen∣tance, and renews the Combat, and is too hard for his Enemies. If he be routed, he rallies again and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>

<P N="3">3. <HI>His Enemies lose Ground by all their partial Conquests of Him.</HI> A Child of God gets Good by his Foils and Falls, yea, gets Ground insensi∣bly of his Corruptions and other Enemies thereby. His Enemies by win∣ning the Day, lose it; and by Conquering, are conquered. Every victory that Sin and Satan obtain, makes a gracious Heart more humble, more sen∣sible of his own weakness, and absolute need of the strength of Christ, more watchful against Sin and Temptation, more Cautious for time to come of admitting Parlyes and Compliances with his Adversares, and so turns (through the <HI>over-ruling Hand of Grace</HI>) to the <HI>singular Advantage</HI> of a Christian in many respects. Lay these things together, and it will be mani∣fest that a Believer manages a very <HI>successful warre,</HI> and is sure at last of an <HI>absolute Conquest.</HI></P>

And there is the like Reason as to all the Enemies of a Christian. A Believer obtains this incomparable Victory and Glorious Conquest over all through Christ. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Lord Jesus Christ hath procured and purchased this Victory and Conquest for Believers.</HI> Therefore he hath <HI>Suffered</HI> and <HI>Dyed, Satisfied</HI> and <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ted,</HI> that his People might obtain a Glorious Victory over Sin, Satan, World, Death, and all their Enemies.

Sovereignty of Sin and Satan, and his Spiritual Enemies, even Death it self: and they put in their Claim to a <HI>Soveraignty,</HI> yea, and actually exercise a Dominion over Him; So that man in this Condition is a <HI>Captive, Prisoner, Slave,</HI> and cannot get his <HI>Liberty.</HI> If He struggle sometimes, and rise up to warre against them; All his Contendings are vain, He is overcome pre∣sently, and held in bondage. The Reason is, because his Enemies are (in a Sense) as strong as the Law and Justice of God. <HI>The strength of Sin</HI> (and by parity of Reason, of other Enemies) is the Law, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15. 56. that is, <HI>the Law broken, and the Justice of God offended.</HI> But the Lord Jesus having satisfied and merited, when there is an <HI>Application</HI> of that <HI>Redemption</HI> which is in Christ to any man; Now S<HI>in, Satan, World,</HI> have no <HI>Right</HI> to exercise this <HI>Dominion;</HI> they lose their Claim and Title to such <HI>Dominion,</HI> and this is the <HI>Foundation</HI> of any mans <HI>Conquest</HI> of them.

<P N="3">3. <HI>He puts them into a Conquering-capacity.</HI> He sends his Spirit to make the Application of his Redemption to all his Redeemed ones by working <HI>Faith in their Hearts,</HI> drawing them to himself, giving them an actual Inte∣rest in himself, and his Benefits, and putting them into a State of Justifica∣tion, which is a State of Victory and Triumph. A justified person is in a Conquering-capacity and condition. He is under Grace, and not under the Law, therefore <HI>neither Sin, nor any other Enemy shall have dominion over him,</HI> Rom 6. 14. Take an Elect person, that was given to Christ by the Father from Eternity, and Redeemed by Christ in the fulness of time, yet before his effectual vocation, he is under the feet of his Enemies, in no better condition to fight it out with them then other men; <HI>Sin,</HI> and <HI>Satan,</HI> and <HI>World</HI> are much too hard for him. But when once the Spirit of Christ hath wrought an effectual work of Grace in his Soul, &amp; by uniting him to the Lord Jesus hath brought him into a state of Justification: now he is in a condition to dispute it out to the last with all his Enemies, and to get the day also. A Justified person is invincible, be cannot be Conquered; and he is victorious, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one of his Enemies can stand before him. <HI>Victory</HI> &amp; <HI>Triumph</HI> are adjudged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y the Lord to a state of Justification, and are infallible consequents thereof.

<P>Concl. 7. <HI>The Love of God in Christ is the absolute first cause of these victorious proceedings, and this infallible conquest of Believers.</HI> For,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Everlasting love of God determines, that the Victory shall fall on the side of Believers.</HI> The will of God is that all Believers shall conquer.

Those that are appointed to obtain Salvation by Jesus Christ (as it may be concluded of all Believers; saving Faith being a special fruit of Election) may meet with many Ene∣mies in their way, but shall infallibly break through all opposition, &amp; get to Heaven at last.

<P N="2">2. <HI>The everlasting Love of God layes in suitable provision of means for an infallible conquest.</HI> Divine Love concluded upon the mission of Christ into the World, to purchase it for his People, and obtain the victory in his own person, <HI>as a common person</HI> representing all Believers.

Christ furnisheth the Christian Souldier compleatly every way with all that he needs in order to the Conquest of his Enemies; so that he is better provided for the Combate, and hath more Assistance in the Combate, and more assurance (consequently) of success, then any other Conquerours have.

<P N="3">3. <HI>The Everlasting Love of God adjudges them Triumph at last, and Crowns them with it.</HI> Divine Love sets the Glorious Crown upon the Head of the persevering, victorious, all-conquering Believer. There is a Glorious Day coming, wherein the Believer shall receive the reward of all his Labours and Travels and Combatings with <HI>the Flesh, the World, and the Devil:</HI> And this reward will be adjudged to <HI>him that overcometh,</HI> and actu∣ally conferred upon him by the Grace and Love of God in Jesus Christ. Not his Merit, but Gods Mercy and Love will then Crown him. His present sufferings in the time of his Warfare are not worthy to be compared with the <HI>Glory that shall be revealed in him,</HI> Rom. 8. 18. <HI>When Paul had fought his good fight, and finished the course of his warfare, he expected his Triumphal Crown from the Lord, the Righteous judge,</HI> 2 Tim. 4. 7, 8 A Crown of Mer∣cy and Grace it is, and also a Crown of Righteousness: there being a sweet concurrence of the <HI>Remunerative Justice of God</HI> with his <HI>Infinite Mer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, Grace,</HI> and <HI>Love</HI> in that Glorious work of <HI>Crowning a persevering Christian Souldier with everlasting Triumph and Glory.</HI> Divine Love adjudges and bestows upon Believers at last the Heavenly Prize they run for, and the in∣corruptible Crown they fight for in this World. That they Triumph Eter∣nally is from the Love of God in Christ. Thus much for the Doctrinal Part.</P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> 1. We might improve this Observation, <HI>To crush that Errone∣ous conceit of the Arminians, concerning the possibility of a Regenerate man's total and final Apostacy.</HI> For to assert this, is to say, that a Believer may be totally defeated and overcome, and Sin, Satan and World may prevaile over him to his utter <HI>Ruine.</HI> The Truth we have discoursed, is ready prest to <HI>militate</HI> against the men of that <HI>Heterodox pers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asion:</HI> and is alone (without the Levy of any other forces) of strength sufficient to <HI>fight that Enemy and beat him out of the field.</HI> This Text of the Apostle, and the Ob∣servation we have deduced from it, smites those Adversaries of the Doctrine of Perseverance under the <HI>fifth Rib,</HI> or rather <HI>stabs their fifth Article</HI> con∣cerning the <HI>Apostasy of Saints</HI> to the Heart. This one Weapon, if it be well managed and weilded will do real and through Execution. For if there may be a total &amp; final defection of Believers, or falling from Grace, &amp; out of the favour of God, then there is a possibility that a Believer may be totally &amp; fi∣nally separated from the love of God: &amp; so totally conquered; which is diame∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rally

True Faith, though it be but <HI>as a Grain of Mustard S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d,</HI> will overcome and bear down all that opposition the World can make against it. As to this Christian Warfare, Victory and Triumph, Believers of all sorts share in it: there is no difference in this matter, but <HI>Iew</HI> and <HI>Greek, Bond</HI> and <HI>Free, Male</HI> and <HI>Female</HI> are all one in this respect through Jesus Christ. The weakest Believer will be too hard for the strongest Adversary.

And his People (that are at present in a sad and sorrowful Condition in the <HI>Heat</HI> of the <HI>Engagement</HI>) shall laugh too, and <HI>Triumph</HI> over all. Excellent were the Expressions of that man of Faith, <HI>Martin Luther</HI> to this purpose. <Q>That the <HI>Kings and Princes &amp; People do sorage against the Lord and his Christ,</HI> I account (faith he) an <HI>Happy Omen,</HI> and much better then if they fawned and flattered: For it follows (in the second <HI>Psalm) He that fitteth in the Heavens shall laugh at them.</HI> Hoc autem principe nostro illos ridente, non video cur nobis flendum sit a facie illorum. <HI>As long as our King laughs at them, I see no Reason why we should cry for them.</HI> </Q>They that make Christ laugh by their ridiculous Opposition, should not make his People cry.

For indeed their <HI>wisest Contrivances</HI> are <HI>Foolishness,</HI> and their strongest Endeavours against the <HI>impregnable and invincible</HI> Interest of Christ and his Church, are <HI>weakness it self,</HI> and will appear so at last. And if Christ <HI>laughs at them,</HI> why should not his Friends and Followers also? <Q>For he laughs (as <HI>Luther</HI> goes on) <HI>not for his own, but for our sake, that we also through Faith may laugh at the vain Counsels of Men: So much need there it of Faith, that the Cause of Faith may not be managed without Faith,</HI> Ne Causa Fidei sit fine Fide.</Q> He that is sure of Victory may well laugh in the Face of his Enemies. Now though wicked men <HI>are plowing and making long Furrows on the Backs of the Righteous,</HI> yet the Lord will cer∣tainly cut their Traces.

successfull</HI> in all his Engagements. Here is encouragement enough, one would think, to make any <HI>Coward</HI> valiant in fight. Never despair nor give in then, <HI>but fight this good fight of Faith.</HI> Therefore for Direction;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Let all Believers know and consider well that they are Souldiers, and have fighting work before them.</HI> That they have many Foes to deal withal, and that they are in the Field deeply engaged in a sharp contest about <HI>the things of their Peace:</HI> And that there is no retreating, or drawing off, or looking back without shame and misery. That they are waging a War, that is of greatest importance, of everlasting Consequence, and of infinite concernment to them. Do not rest in slight Apprehensions, transient and overly Thoughts of your State and Condition in this respect; <HI>lest you fall into a Laish like frame,</HI> (Judg. 18. 27.) and dwell secu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ely and carelesly in the World, and expose your selves to the inrodes and incursions of your E∣nemies. Know that you do not dwell far from evil Neighbours: you have Mortal Enemies bordering upon you, that will make all Advantage of your Security. You have a Troublesome, Quarrelsome In-mate, one that was bred and born with you, and hath grown up with you, and is a constant Lodger in your House, and Companion at home and abroad. Indwelling sin (I mean) with its Confederates, that hold exact intelligence one with another, and watch all Advantages against you.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Labour to get accurate Intelligence of the Policies and Designs of your Adversaries.</HI> Acquaint your selves with the deceitfulness of sin, the Frauds and Impostures of the World, the Wiles, Methods, Depths and Advanta∣ges of the Devil, the desperate wickedness of the Heart, and the <HI>deep wa∣ters</HI> of evil Counsel there. Finde out the <HI>Cabinet Counsels</HI> and <HI>Politick de∣sign of your Enemies against you:</HI> what they design, what <HI>Stratagems</HI> they use, what advantagious seasons they chuse to fight you in, what fals<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Co∣lours they put out, that they may surprize you in the Disguise of Friends, what politick Retreats they make, what Ambushments they lay, what Re∣serves of fresh Forces they have in readiness, what gradual and secret Ap∣proaches they make, where they plant their <HI>Artillery,</HI> and are designing to make a Breach in your <HI>Graces</HI> or <HI>Comforts,</HI> that they may Storm your Souls, and make themselves Masters of all. Do what you can to inform your selves what it is they drive at, how and where, and which way they are like to Assault you. In waging of War there is (as One speaks) the greatest improvement of <HI>Humane Wisdome</HI> and <HI>Inaustry.</HI> Discover as much as may be the Subtleties and Policies, and Forces and Advantages of your Enemies, that you may be provided to obviate them.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Get Skill and Dexterity in using the Arms and Weapons of your Spiri∣tual Warfare.</HI> How to put on the <HI>Girdle of Truth,</HI> and <HI>Brest-plate of Righ∣teousness:</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="000195_0031_0FA316D9C7F7B7F8"/>
how to use <HI>the Shield of Faith, and Helmet of Hope,</HI> and to wield <HI>the Sword of the Spirit,</HI> (the Word of God) and to improve all the pieces of your Spiritual <HI>Armour,</HI> and all the <HI>Weapons</HI> that your <HI>General</HI> puts into your <HI>Hands.</HI> A Christian is compleatly armed and appointed, but many times knows not how to use his Weapons. Have your <HI>Arms</HI> in rea∣diness, and learn to make a ready and dexterous use of them. That you should not only have <HI>Grace,</HI> but be well Skilled in the vigorous, lively, sea∣sonable Acting and Exercising of all the <HI>Grace</HI> you have, is the meaning of this Direction.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>List your selves into some particular Company that is engaged in the same Warfare.</HI> It is a great Disadvantage to a Christian to stand and fight <HI>alone,</HI> and not to have a particular and peculiar <HI>Interest</HI> in the Help of other Christians: which is the Case of those that live out of <HI>Church-Fellow∣ship,</HI> and do not put themselves under the <HI>Watch</HI> and <HI>Discipline,</HI> and <HI>Conduct</HI> of <HI>particular Churches. Wo</HI> (saith <HI>Solomon,</HI> declaring the Inconveniency of Solitariness) to Him that is Alone, <HI>when he falleth, for he hath not another to help Him up:</HI> And if one prevail against him (that hath a Companion and Helper) two shall withstand him, <HI>Eccles.</HI> 4. 10, 12. It is as true in <HI>Spiritual</HI> as in <HI>Civil</HI> and <HI>Common Cases.</HI> It is a great Advantage in our Spiritual <HI>Conflicts</HI> to have <HI>good Company,</HI> whose Help and Assistance it engaged to us. It is the <HI>Lords Appointment</HI> that <HI>Mankind</HI> should live together in Societies, as in <HI>Families, Common-wealths, Churches,</HI> in order to <HI>common Help-fulness.</HI> It is the singular priviledge of <HI>Church members</HI> to have a peculiar engaged in∣terest in the Prayers, &amp; Counsels, &amp; Help of their <HI>Fellow-Brethren,</HI> which is a very desireable Thing, and a considerable <HI>Advantage,</HI> 1 Cor. 12. 25, 26. Do not therefore <HI>Combate</HI> alone, but get into some particular <HI>Body of Saints Militant.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Keep Order. Fight every one in your own places where you are set. Be sure you keep Rank and File.</HI> Order is the Beauty of the World, and of an <HI>Army</HI> in Special (In Allusion whereunto the Stars are frequently called <HI>the Host of Heaven,</HI> because of the exactness of their <HI>Order &amp; Regularness</HI> of their <HI>Motion</HI>) and of the <HI>Christian Army</HI> (the Church of Christ in its <HI>Mil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Condition</HI>) most of all.

This of Order is one respect wherein Churches are well compared to <HI>Armies</HI> that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> ordered and disciplined. This is the Glory and strength of such
<PB N="27" REF="000195_0032_0FA316DA883B77B8"/>
Christian Societies, and no small Advantage to every Christian. Those are the best Souldiers that are best exercised to keep their own Place and Order. So <HI>Material</HI> a Thing it is, that it is the <HI>Character</HI> and <HI>Description</HI> of good Souldiers, that they were such as could keep Rank, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Chron.</HI> 12. 33, 36, 38. The private Souldier must not straggle, or leave his place, or thrust Himself into the place and Command of the Officer, but every one keep the place assigned Him. A Souldier that is commanded to stand such a Ground, must not stir from it, though He is sure to dye upon the place: If He leave it, he dies for it by <HI>Marital Law.</HI> No personal danger will excuse him for such breach of order. There is no dispensing with it. A Christian Souldier must not be <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, One that keeps not his place if I may so render it. Nor <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> One that breaks orders, and behaves himself disorderly. Rules of Order must be carefully attended. Many of you see the Beauty, and ac∣knowledge the benefit of Order in other Societies, and observe it with much exactness at your Trainings and Artillery Exercises, and must do so in real Engagements. And why should not Christians apprehend the like necessity of attending Order (<HI>Christs Order</HI> I mean) in every <HI>Christian Army,</HI> eve∣ry <HI>Ecclesiastical Society,</HI> and the like inconveniences of the contrary.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Maintain Peace and Union with your Fellow-Souldiers, or with those of the same Company, or Regiment, or Army, as much as in you lies:</HI> Com∣munion <HI>I mean with the Members of the Church wherein you stand, and with the rest of the Churches of Christ.</HI> There are some cases wherein peace with men cannot be kept; nay, wherein it is a duty to contend against them ear∣nestly <HI>for the Faith, for the Truth, for the Glory of God,</HI> and <HI>for the good of the Publick:</HI> But if it be possible, as much as lieth in you (as far as it is pos∣sible, lawful and expedient) <HI>live peaceably with all men,</HI> Rom. 12. 18. espe∣cially seek and follow peace with your Fellow Souldiers, your Brethren and Companions <HI>in Tribulation, and in the Kingdome and patience of Jesus Christ.</HI> Peace among, and mutual Communion of Churches and Church-members is as necessary a thing, as peace and union in an Army. I wish with all my Soul that this might be attended in this great Town of <HI>Boston.</HI> That these three Churches might be as a <HI>three<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old Cord,</HI> so twisted together, that they might not be easily broken. Mutinies in an Army between one Company, or Regiment, and another, are hazardous to the safety and good of the whole, and therefore severely punished. A wise General will take the <HI>least <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> of any Overture that way, because it is a thing of dangerous Consequence to the Army.

They are your Enemies, yea, common Enemies to the <HI>Interest</HI> of Christ, and his people that will go about to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oment</HI> these <HI>Divisions,</HI> or advise to the perpetuating of these Differences. If I were not well assured that Christs Name, and Interest, and your own Souls suffer unspeakably hereby, I should not have opened my Mouth in this manner. However I hope none here are so much in love with Contention as to be angry with Counsels of Peace. It is a matter of great Consequence. O let us not <HI>turn our Swords into one another<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Bowels,</HI> as the <HI>Midianites</HI> (Judg. 7. 22.) <HI>Philistines</HI> (1 Sam. 14 15, 20.) <HI>Moabites, Ammonites</HI> and the Inhabitants of <HI>Mount Seir</HI> (2 Chron. 20. 23.) as well as others, have done to their own Destruction. I believe really that it is with these Churches, or Companies of Christian Souldiers in this place, so far as there is any Contention among them, as it is with Soul∣diers now &amp; then in the Heat of Battel. Sometimes through mistake in the Hurry and Confusion of Battel, one <HI>Regiment</HI> or <HI>Company</HI> chargeth another of the same Army, slaughtering and destroying their own dear Friends, en∣gaged on the same side, and for the same cause, instead of their Enemies. This hath occasioned great Mischief. So through Darkness, Confusions, Mis-understandings, and Mis-representations of Persons and Actions in an <HI>Hour of Temptation,</HI> it comes to pass that Brethren contend and quarrel, and wound one another with the wound of <HI>an Enemy, and of a cruel One.</HI> Mistakes and Mis-apprehensions are the usual, sad occasions of great Divi∣sions.

<P N="7">7. <HI>Make it your chief care and business all the time of your Warfare to please your Great General the Lord of Hosts, the Lord Jesus Christ in all things.</HI> That is the property of a good Souldier, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2 4. He designs to please his Commander in chief, by a <HI>ready Obedience.</HI> This was the sin∣gular commendation of the <HI>Centurions Souldiers,</HI> Mat. 8. 9. Luk. 7. 8. No Men are under more absolute Command then Souldiers, that must not di∣spute, but obey the Orders of their General. In like manner do you ob∣serve all the Orders of the Lord Jesus, obey all his Words of Command, ad∣venture upon the hottest and hardest pieces of Service, when he requires it; hold no Intelligence, or Treacherous, close Correspondence with his Enemies; In every Motion or Action consider with your selves whether this or that course, and carriage and Posture will please Christ. And in particular please him by a ready and cheerful Obedience to Inferiour, Commissioned Officers for his sake. <HI>Obey them that have the Ruleover you</HI> is one great word of Com∣mand which our Lord &amp; Saviour gives, <HI>Heb.</HI> 13. 7, 17. Though I am as truly &amp; heartily opposite to the <HI>Presbyterian Perswasion</HI> (with due respect to the Piety and Learning, and Orthodoxy and Excellent Abilities and Accom∣plishments of those our Fellow-Brethren, and Souldiers that match on that side of the way, be it spoken) wherein it lies in direct Opposition to the Substantials of the <HI>Congregational-way,</HI> as any of you: and though I am remote enough from the intention of improving the Text but now menti∣oned, to the establishing of such an Absolute and Arbitrary Rule <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Presbytery, as is really inconsistent, and incomportable with the due pri∣viledge and liberty of the People: yet I am sure that all are not <HI>Guider, Ove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eers,</HI> and <HI>Rulers,</HI> but that there are <HI>Rulers</HI> and <HI>Ruled,</HI> the <HI>Governours</HI> and the <HI>Governed</HI> in all particular Churches according the Sovereign Institu∣tion of Jesus Christ; there are Officers and Private Souldiers according to the appointment of our Lord General: And I must say freely, that that way of Church-Government that allows not the Rule and Government truely and properly so called, to Church Officers, is not the way of Christs Institution. Obey therefore such as the Lord Jesus hath set over you in the Lord; if you mean to please him. Otherwise you may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> General will severely punish the undue contempt of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Christian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></P>

8. <HI>Be willing to endu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Hardship.</HI> This is another Qualification of a Souldier, 2 <HI>Tim,</HI> 2 3. Church-Officers are called to this in a special manner: but it is duty also of every Christian Soulders, that must expect to wrestle with many Difficulties. A man must never think to be a Souldier that is nice and delicate, and loves to favour himself and indulgeth to pleasure and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase. <HI>Ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is delicatus es Christians, qui volu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tatem hoc seculo concupiscis. Tertull.</HI> Every Souldier must resolve upon enduring Hunger, and Thirst, and Cold, and Wet, and Weariness, and lying upon the Ground, many Hard∣ships and Inconveniences in the course of his Military Imployment. As <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eas</HI> the <HI>Scythian</HI> said to <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Macedon: You Command Macedoni∣ans that can fight with men;</HI> But I Command <HI>Scythians that are able to fight with Hunger and Thirst.</HI> A Course of Warfare is usually a Course of Hardship, as well as Hazards. Christians must look for many hardships in their way, ill Usage, and course Entertainment, and sore Inconveniencies, and hard Duty in their <HI>Warfare.</HI> It is their great Wisdome and Duty to expect them, and learn to comport <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ght with them.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>Do not encumber your selves with other Occasions, or with anything that may take you off, or hinder you in your Warfare.</HI> No man <HI>that Warreth en∣tangleth himself with the Affairs of this life,</HI> 2 Tim. 2 4 Souldiers are great∣ly taken off from other employments; they cannot follow <HI>Merchandizing</HI> or <HI>Husbandry,</HI> or this or that <HI>Trade</HI> to any great purpose. They have enough to do to attend their <HI>Watchings</HI> and <HI>Wardings, Marchings</HI> and <HI>Motions,</HI> the Orders and Commands of their Leaders. True it is that a particular Calling is very well consistent with the General Calling of a Christian Souldier, and should be so attended and managed, that it may be a further∣ance and no hindrance thereunto. But may we not fear that there is a fault among Christian Souldiers in this respect? and that they are generally too much engaged in other matters, and entangled with the World and the Af∣fairs thereof, and thereby rendred less disposed to the service of Christ in their Christian Warfare? Certainly <HI>inordinate Affection to the thing of his World, and over eager pursuit of them</HI> doth in no wise become a good Soul∣dier of Christ.</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>Be content with your Wages.</HI> That is the good Quality of a Soul∣dier, as <HI>John the Baptist</HI> intimates, <HI>Luk.</HI> 3. 14. A Christian properly hath no wages, because all he enjoyes is of meer Grace and Courtesie. When he hath done all, He is an <HI>unprofitable Servant,</HI> Luk. 17. 10. But my meaning is, be contented with what the Lord Jesus Christ affords you at present for your sustentation and encouragement. Yea, though he keep you at short Allowance, as to comforts and spiritual suavities, and such a sufficiency of Grace to prevail, and conquer, and tread down all your Enemies, as you could desire; yet be quiet and contented with your present portion; do
<PB N="31" REF="000195_0036_0FA316DD856944E8"/>
not Mutiny or Murmure, but be Humbly Thankful for, and well sufficed with such things as you have, <HI>Heb.</HI> 13 5. And be assured that the Lord Jesus, though he owe you nothing, and keep you short at present, will pay you well atlast. The time is coming, when you shall be drawn out of the Field, and discharged from this Warfare, and then he will pay you all your <HI>Arrears,</HI> over and over, and gratifie you for all your Service (such is his Grace) with that which you may comfortably subsist on to Eternity.</P>
<P>This is the first Branch of the Exhortation. <HI>Let all true Believers be great∣ly encouraged to fight against their Spiritual Enemies; &amp; that both in their pri∣vate and publick Capacities.</HI> For every Believer must engage in a Warfare, not only <HI>General</HI> and Common to all Christians, but also proper and peculi∣ar to himself in his place and Condition. <NOTE PLACE="marg">This Sermon was Preached when the General Court was sitting, and in the Audience of the much Ho∣noured Members of it.</NOTE> Therefore I would crave leave to Address my self here with a word or two of Encouragement to our Pious, Faithful, Honourable Rulers in their <HI>Warfare,</HI> not as they are Christians only, but as they are Christian Magistrates also, and the <HI>Nursing Fathers</HI> of our <HI>Common-Wealth</HI> and <HI>Churches.</HI> It would indeed be a most importune and intollerable Thing, <HI>notorious Boldness</HI> and <HI>Rudeness</HI> in me this Day, and on such an Occasion, to stand here and dictate to our <HI>Ho∣nourable Patriots</HI> and <HI>Worthies,</HI> or to direct and advise them about the par∣ticular management of their Civil Affairs. As every man should be wise<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in his own Calling and Concerns: So it is the great Happiness of <HI>New-Eng∣land</HI> that we have Persons of <HI>great worth</HI> and <HI>Wisdom, Integrity</HI> and <HI>Experi∣ence, ruling over us,</HI> and guiding us by the <HI>Skilfulness</HI> of their <HI>Hands;</HI> and such as have no need of the <HI>Instructions</HI> of such a piece of weakness and un∣worthiness as stands before you. They know their own Business, and are <HI>taught of God</HI> to manage the great Affairs under their Hands. I remember well, that I am an <HI>unworthy Minister of the Gospel;</HI> not a <HI>Statesman,</HI> or <HI>projector.</HI> And therefore I am very farre from the Design of obtruding upon you (<HI>much Honoured</HI> my raw and indigested Apprehensions about the Condition of your Affairs, and what may seem Counsellable in that respect. But I would with <HI>all Humility, Respect</HI> and <HI>Affection,</HI> administer to you a word of Encouragement, in a particular Application of what hath been discoursed of the Christians <HI>Warfare</HI> in <HI>General</HI> to your <HI>Warfare</HI> in <HI>Special.</HI> You must Combate with <HI>Prophaneness,</HI> with <HI>turbulent Heresies,</HI> with <HI>Blasphemies,</HI> with <HI>Injustice,</HI> with <HI>Disorders</HI> of many Kinds: and in so doing will be exposed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <HI>hard-Speeches,</HI> yea, to many <HI>Difficulties</HI> and <HI>Discouragements.</HI> And if you should be ready sometimes to faint in this publick Engagement, and complain that you are not able to bear this heavy Burthen that is laid upon you: it would be no more then what we read of <HI>Moses, the meekest man,</HI> and one of the best <HI>accomplished Leaders</HI> and <HI>Gover∣nour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="aeld" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
