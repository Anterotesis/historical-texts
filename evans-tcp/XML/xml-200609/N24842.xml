<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>"PRAY what does the author mean?" is the first question most readers will ask, and the last they are able to answer. Therefore in a word I will explain the subject and de∣sign of the following poem.</P>
<P>The subject is the state of the times in re∣gard to literature and religion. The author was prompted to write by a hope that it might be of use to point out, in a clear, concise, and striking manner, those general errors, that hinder the advantages of education, and the growth of piety. The subject is inexhaustible; nor is my design yet completed. This first part describes the principal mistakes in one course of life, and exemplifies the following well known truth, That to the frequent scandal, as well of religion, as learning, a fellow without any share of genius, or application to study, may pass with credit through life, receive the honours of a liberal education, and be admit∣ted to the right hand of fellowship among mi∣nisters of the gospel. That, except in one neighbouring province, ignorance wanders unmolested at our colleges, examinations are dwindled to meer form and ceremony, and af∣ter four years dozing there, no one is ever re∣fused the honours, of a degree, on account of dulness and insufficiency. That the meer knowledge of ancient languages, of the abstru∣ser
<PB N="iv" REF="032943_0003_0FF5E8CB612E6E38"/>
parts of mathematics, and the dark re∣searches of metaphysics, is of little advantage in business or profession in life. That it would be more beneficial, in every place of public education, to take pains in teaching the ele∣ments of oratory, the grammar of the English tongue, and the elegancies of style, and com∣position. That in numberless instances thro'∣out these colonies, sufficient care hath not been taken to exclude the ignorant and irreligious, from the sacred desk. That this tenderness to the undeserving, tends to debase the dignity of the clergy, and to hinder many worthy men from undertaking the office of the ministry. And that the virulent controversies of the pre∣sent day concerning religious, or in many cases, merely speculative opinions, savouring so high∣ly of vanity and ostentation, and breathing a spirit so opposite to christian benevolence, have done more hurt to the cause of religion, than all the malice, the ridicule, and the folly of its enemies.</P>

<HEAD>THE PROGRESS OF DULNESS. PART FIRST.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>[What Tom's father and mother said of him; how he went to college, and what he learned there; how he took his degree, and went to keeping school; how afterwards he became a great man and wore a wig; and how any body else may do the same.]</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<LG>
<L>"OUR TOM has grown a sturdy boy;</L>
<L>His progress fills my heart with joy;</L>
<L>A steady soul that yields to rule,</L>
<L>And quite ingenious too, at school.</L>
<L>Our master says, I'm sure he's right,</L>
<L>There's not a lad in town so bright.</L>
<L>He'll cypher bravely, write and read,</L>
<L>And say his catechism and creed,</L>
<L>And scorns to hesitate or faulter</L>
<L>In primer, spelling book or psalter.</L>
<L>Hard work indeed, he does not love it;</L>
<L>His genius is too much above it.</L>
<L>Give him a good substantial teacher,</L>
<L>I'll lay he makes a special preacher.</L>
<L>I've lov'd good learning all my life;</L>
<L>We'll send the lad to college, wife,"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="032943_0005_0FF5E8CF9204B390"/>
<L>Thus sway'd by fond and sightless passion,</L>
<L>His parents hold a consultation;</L>
<L>If on their couch, or round their fire,</L>
<L>I need not tell, nor you enquire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The point's agreed; the boy well pleas'd,</L>
<L>From country cares and labour eas'd;</L>
<L>No more to rise by break of day</L>
<L>To drive home cows, or deal out hay;</L>
<L>To work no more in snow or hail,</L>
<L>And blow his fingers o'er the flail,</L>
<L>Or mid the toils of harvest sweat</L>
<L>Beneath the summer's sultry heat,</L>
<L>Serene, he bids the farm, good bye,</L>
<L>And quits the plow without a sigh.</L>
<L>Propitious to their constant friend,</L>
<L>The pow'rs of idleness attend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So to the priest in form he goes,</L>
<L>Prepar'd to study and to doze.</L>
<L>The parson in his youth before,</L>
<L>Had run the same dull progress o'er;</L>
<L>His sole concern to see with care</L>
<L>His church, and farm in good repair.</L>
<L>His skill in tongues, that once he knew,</L>
<L>Had bid him long, a last adieu;</L>
<L>Away his latin rules had fled,</L>
<L>And greek had vanish'd from his head.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then view our youth with grammar teazing,</L>
<L>Untaught in meaning, sense or reason;</L>
<L>Of knowledge e'er he gain his fill, he</L>
<L>Must diet long on husks of <HI>Lillie,</HI></L>
<L>Drudge on for weary months in vain,</L>
<L>By mem'ry's strength, and dint of brain;</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="032943_0006_0FF5E8D19978D408"/>From thence to murd'ring Virgil's verse,</L>
<L>And construing Tully into farce,</L>
<L>Or lab'ring with his grave preceptor,</L>
<L>In greek to blunder o'er a chapter.</L>
<L>The latin testament affords</L>
<L>The needed help of ready words;</L>
<L>At hand the dictionary laid,</L>
<L>Gives up it's page in frequent aid;</L>
<L>Hard by the lexicon and grammar.</L>
<L>Those helps of mem'ry when they stammer;</L>
<L>The lesson's short; the priest contended;</L>
<L>His task to hear is sooner ended.</L>
<L>He lets him mind his own concerns,</L>
<L>Then tells his parents how he learns.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A year thus spent in gathering knowledge▪</L>
<L>The lad sets forth t' unlade at college,</L>
<L>While down his sire and priest attend him,</L>
<L>To introduce and recommend him;</L>
<L>Or if detain'd a letter's sent</L>
<L>Of much apocryphal content,</L>
<L>To set him forth, how dull soever▪</L>
<L>As very learn'd and very clever;</L>
<L>A genius of the first emission,</L>
<L>With burning love for erudition;</L>
<L>So studious he'l outwatch the moon</L>
<L>And think the planets set too soon;</L>
<L>He had but little time to fit in;</L>
<L>Examination too must frighten:</L>
<L>Depend upon't he must do well,</L>
<L>He knows much more than he can tell;</L>
<L>Admit him, and in little space</L>
<L>He'll beat his rivals in the race;</L>
<L>His father's incomes are but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>all,</L>
<L>He comes now if he comes at all.</L>

<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="032943_0007_0FF5E8D49F570E58"/>
<L>So said, so done, at college now</L>
<L>He enters well, no matter how;</L>
<L>New scenes awhile his fancy please,</L>
<L>But all must yield to love of ease.</L>
<L>In the same round condemn'd each day,</L>
<L>To study, read, recite and pray;</L>
<L>To make his hours of business double—</L>
<L>He can't endure th'increasing trouble;</L>
<L>And f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nds at length, as times grow pressing,</L>
<L>All plagues are easier than his lesson.</L>

<L>Much absence, tardes and egresses,</L>
<L>The college evil on him seizes.</L>
<L>Then ev'ry book, which ought to please,</L>
<L>Stirs up the seeds of dire disease;</L>
<L>Greek spoils his eyes, the print's so fine,</L>
<L>Grown dim with study, and with wine;</L>
<L>Of Tully's latin much afraid,</L>
<L>Each page, he calls the doctor's aid;</L>
<L>While geometry, with lines so crooked,</L>
<L>Sprains all his wits to overlook it.</L>
<L>His sickness puts on every name,</L>
<L>It's cause and uses still the same;</L>
<L>'Tis tooth ach, cholick, gout or stone,</L>
<L>With phases various as the moon;</L>
<L>But tho' thro' all the body spread,</L>
<L>Still makes its cap'tal seat the head.</L>
<L>In all diseases, 'tis expected,</L>
<L>The weakest parts be most infected.</L>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Y design in this poem is to sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w, that all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we discover in the fair sex arise principally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the neglect of their education, and the mis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> notions they imbibe in their early youth. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> naturally introduced a description of these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which I have endeavoured to laugh at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> good humour, and to expose without male∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce. Had I only consulted my own taste, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have prefered sense and spirit with a style <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> elevated and poetical, to a perpetual drol∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and the affectation of wit; but I have found <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xperience in the second part of this work, that not so agreeable to the bulk of my readers. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> endeavoured to avoid unseasonable severity, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ope, in that point, I am pretty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ear of cen∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> especially as some of my good friends in these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have lately made a discovery, that severity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my talent, and there is nothing to be feared <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the strokes of my satire; a discovery that on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead hath given me no small consolation. In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>llowing poem, my design is so apparent, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not much afraid of general misrepresentation; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> hope there are no grave folks, who will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it trifling or unimportant. I expect how∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from the treatment I have already received <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd to the former parts of this work, as well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> later and more fugitive productions, that my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> will by many be ignorantly or wilfully mis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/>tood. I shall rest satisfied with the consci∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> that a desire to promote the interests of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g and morality was the principal motive,
<PB REF="032943_0040_0FF5E91876467C48"/>
that influenced me in these writings; judging <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I did, that unless I attempted something in this way, that might conduce to the service of mankind, I had spent much time in the studies of the Muses in vain.</P>
<P>Polite literature hath within a few years made very considerable advances in America. Mankind in general seem sensible of the importance and ad∣vantages of learning. Female education hath been most neglected; and I wish this small performance may have some tendency to encourage and promote it.</P>
<P>The sprightliness of female genius, and the ex∣cellence of that sex in their proper walks of science are by no means inferior to the accomplishments of men. And although the course of their education ought to be different, and writing is not so pecu∣liarly the business of the sex, yet I cannot but hope hereafter to see the accomplishment of my prediction in their favour.</P>
<L><PB REF="032943_0041_0FF5E91A0061FDF0"/>
Her daughters too this happy land shall grace</L>
<L>With powers of genius, as with charms of face;</L>
<L>Blest with the softness of the female mind,</L>
<L>With fancy blooming, and with taste refin'd,</L>
<L>Some Rowe shall rise and wrest with daring pen,</L>
<L>The pride of genius from assuming men;</L>
<L>While each bright line a polish'd beauty wears;</L>
<L>For every Muse and every Grace are theirs.</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>For lovers of all things that breathe</L>
<L>Are most expos'd to sudden death,</L>
<L>And many a swain much fam'd in rhymes</L>
<L>Hath died some hundred thousand times:</L>
<L>Yet tho' love oft their breath may stifle,</L>
<L>'Tis sung it hurts them but a trifle.</L>
<L>The swain revives by equal wonder,</L>
<L>As snakes will join when cut asunder,</L>
<L>And often murther'd still survives;</L>
<L>No cat hath half so many lives.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While round the fair, the coxcombs throng</L>
<L>With oaths, cards, billet-doux, and song,</L>
<L>She spread her charms and wish'd to gain</L>
<L>The heart of ev'ry simple swain;</L>
<L>To all with gay, alluring air,</L>
<L>She hid in smiles the fatal snare,</L>
<L>For sure that snare must fatal prove,</L>
<L>Where falshood wears the form of love;</L>
<L>Full oft with pleasing transport hung</L>
<L>On accents of each flattring tongue,</L>
<L><PB N="61" REF="032943_0056_0FF5E939492D5D80"/>And found a pleasure most sincere</L>
<L>From each erect, attentive ear;</L>
<L>For pride was hers, that oft with ease,</L>
<L>Despis'd the man she wish'd to please.</L>
<L>She lov'd the chace, but scorn'd the prey,</L>
<L>And fish'd for hearts to throw away;</L>
<L>Joy'd at the tale of piercing darts,</L>
<L>And tortring flames and pining hearts,</L>
<L>And pleas'd perus'd the billet-doux,</L>
<L>That said, "I die for love of you;"</L>
<L>Found conquest in each gallant's sighs</L>
<L>And blest the murders of her eyes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So Doctors live but by the dead,</L>
<L>And pray for plagues, as daily bread;</L>
<L>Thank providence for colds and fevers,</L>
<L>And hold consumptions special favours;</L>
<L>And think diseases kindly made,</L>
<L>As blest materials of their trade.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Twou'd weary all the pow'rs of verse</L>
<L>Their am'rous speeches to rehearse,</L>
<L>Their compliments, whose vain parade</L>
<L>Turns Venus to a kitchen-maid;</L>
<L>With high pretence of love and honor,</L>
<L>They vent their folly all upon her,</L>
<L>(Ev'n as the scripture-precept saith,</L>
<L>More shall be given to him that hath;)</L>
<L>Tell her how wondrous fair they deem her</L>
<L>How handsome all the world esteem her;</L>
<L>And while they flatter and adore,</L>
<L>She contradicts to call for more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"And did they say I was so handsome?</L>
<L>My looks—I'm sure no one can fancy 'em.</L>
<L><PB N="62" REF="032943_0057_0FF5E93ACEB30020"/>'Tis true we're all as we were fram'd,</L>
<L>And none have right to be asham'd;</L>
<L>But as for beauty—all can tell</L>
<L>I never fancied I look'd well;</L>
<L>I were a fright, had I a grain less,</L>
<L>You're only joking, Mr. Brainless."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet beauty still maintain'd her sway;</L>
<L>And bade the proudest hearts obey;</L>
<L>Ev'n sense her glances could beguile,</L>
<L>And vanquish'd wisdom with a smile,</L>
<L>While merit bow'd and found no arms,</L>
<L>To oppose the conquests of her charms,</L>
<L>Caught all those bashful fears, that place▪</L>
<L>The mask of folly on the face,</L>
<L>That awe, that robs our airs of ease,</L>
<L>And blunders when it hopes to please!</L>
<L>For men of sense will always prove</L>
<L>The most forlorn of fools in love.</L>
<L>The fair esteem'd, admir'd, 'tis true,</L>
<L>And prais'd—'tis all coquettes can do.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And when deserving lovers came,</L>
<L>Believ'd her smiles and own'd their flame▪</L>
<L>Her bosom thrill'd, with joy affected</L>
<L>To increase the list, she had rejected;</L>
<L>While pleas'd to see her arts prevail,</L>
<L>To each she told the self-same tale.</L>
<L>She wish'd in truth they ne'er had seen her,</L>
<L>And feign'd what grief it oft had given her,</L>
<L>And sad, of tender-hearted make,</L>
<L>Griev'd they were ruin'd for her sake.</L>
<L>'Twas true, she own'd on recollection,</L>
<L>She'd given them proofs of kind affection:</L>
<L><PB N="63" REF="032943_0058_0FF5E93CD29C1578"/>But they mistook her whole intent,</L>
<L>For friendship was the thing she meant.</L>
<L>She wonder'd how their hearts could move 'em</L>
<L>So strangely as to think she'd love 'em;</L>
<L>She thought her purity above</L>
<L>The low and sensual flames of love;</L>
<L>And yet they made such sad ado,</L>
<L>She wish'd she could have lov'd them too▪</L>
<L>She pitied them and as a friend</L>
<L>She priz'd them more than all mankind;</L>
<L>And begg'd them not their hearts to vex,</L>
<L>Or hang themselves, or break their necks;</L>
<L>Told them 'twould make her life uneasy,</L>
<L>If they should run forlorn, or crazy:</L>
<L>Objects of love she could not deem 'em;</L>
<L>But did most marv'lously esteem 'em.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For 'tis esteem, coquettes dispense</L>
<L>Tow'rd learning, genius, worth and sense,</L>
<L>Sincere affection, truth refin'd,</L>
<L>And all the merit of the mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But love's the passion they experience</L>
<L>For gold, and dress, and gay appearance.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For ah! what magic charms and graces</L>
<L>Are found in golden suits of laces!</L>
<L>What going forth of hearts and souls</L>
<L>Tow'rd glares of gilded button holes!</L>
<L>What lady's heart can stand its ground</L>
<L>'Gainst hats with giittering<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>edging bound?</L>
<L>While vests and shoes and hose conspire,</L>
<L>And gloves and ruffles fan the fire:</L>
<L>And broadcloaths, cut by tailor's arts,</L>
<L>Spread fatal nets for female hearts.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="64" REF="032943_0059_0FF5E9417128DE90"/>
<L>And oh, what charms more potent shine,</L>
<L>Drawn from the dark Peruvian mine!</L>
<L>What spells and talismans of Venus</L>
<L>Are found in dollars, crowns and guineas!</L>
<L>In purse of gold, a single stiver</L>
<L>Beats all the darts in Cupid's quiver.</L>
<L>What heart so constant, but must veer,</L>
<L>When drawn by thousand pounds a year!</L>
<L>How many fair ones ev'ry day</L>
<L>To houses fine have fall'n a prey,</L>

<L>Admit the rich to bliss and glory,</L>

<L>And now the time was come, our fair</L>
<L>Should all the plagues of passion share,</L>
<L>And after ev'ry heart she'd won,</L>
<L>By sad disaster lose her own.</L>

<L>In airs and dress so great his merit,</L>

<L>Poor Harriet saw; her heart was stouter;</L>
<L>She gather'd all her smiles about her;</L>
<L>Hop'd by her eyes to gain the laurels,</L>
<L>And charm him down, as snakes do squirrels;</L>
<L>So priz'd his love and wish'd to win it,</L>

<L>Her fate she ventur'd on his trial,</L>
<L>And lost her birthright of denial.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And here her brightest hopes miscarry;</L>
<L>For Dick was too gallant to marry:</L>
<L>He own'd she'd charms for those who need'em,</L>

<L>In love, a lady once given over,</L>

<L>And always am'rous, always changing,</L>

<L>As shadows vary o'er a glass,</L>
<L>Each holds in turn the vacant place;</L>
<L>She doats upon her earliest pain,</L>
<L>And following thousands, loves in vain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Poor Harriet now hath had her day;</L>
<L>No more the beaus confess her sway;</L>
<L>New beauties push her from the stage;</L>
<L>She trembles at th'approach of age,</L>
<L>And starts to view the alter'd face,</L>

<HEAD>A LETTER from CAMBRIDGE.</HEAD>
<L>THO' plagu'd with Algebraic lectures,</L>
<L>And astronomical conjectures;</L>
<L>Wean'd from the sweets of poetry,</L>
<L>To scraps of dry philosophy:</L>
<L>You see, dear Hal, I've found a time,</L>
<L>T' express my thoughts to you in rhyme;</L>
<L>For why, you'll say, should distant parts,</L>
<L>Or time disjoin, united hearts;</L>
<L>Since, tho,' by intervening space,</L>
<L>Depriv'd of speaking face▪ face,</L>
<L>By faithful emissary letter,</L>
<L>We may converse as well, or better:</L>

<L>How here I spent my time and money.</L>
<L>No more, majestic Virgil's heights,</L>
<L>Nor Milton's tow'ring lofty flights;</L>
<L>Nor courtly Horace's rebukes,</L>
<L>Who banters vice, with friendly jokes;</L>
<L>Nor Congreve's life, nor Cowley's fire;</L>

<L>Prior's inimitable lays,</L>

<L>How spring, in philosophick ground?</L>
<L>Homer, indeed, if I would shew it,</L>

<L>But tedious philosophick chapters,</L>
<L>Quite stifle my poetic raptures;</L>
<L>And I to Phebus bid adieu,</L>
