<HEAD>VERSES Occasioned by the EARTHQUAKES in the Month of November, 1755.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By <HI>Jeremiah Newland.</HI></BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>O God of Mercy thou art good,</L>
<L>Thou Care for us did take,</L>
<L>When by thy Hand thou did Command,</L>
<L>the Earth and Sea to shake.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What Heart so hard that can't be jarr'd,</L>
<L>when thou the Earth doth shake:</L>
<L>O Lord what Eye can then be dry,</L>
<L>in terrible EARTHQUAKE.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thy terrible Hand is on the Land,</L>
<L>by bloody War and Death;</L>
<L>It is because we broke thy Laws,</L>
<L>that thou didst shake the Earth.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Is ten good Men in each Town then?</L>
<L>because our Towns are spar'd!</L>
<L>Bless God that they have made a Way,</L>
<L>that God might us Regard.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>God looked strait in <HI>Sodom's</HI> Gate,</L>
<L>but ten good Men were not;</L>
<L>But yet we see he did agree,</L>
<L>with <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Lot.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>God would be just if he had thrust</L>
<L>us in the gaping Ground;</L>
<L>When we did shake by the Earthquake,</L>
<L>clean is his guiltless Throne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come to the Lord with one Accord,</L>
<L>and forth his Praises sound;</L>
<L>For seeing he so kind to thee,</L>
<L>and not to sink the Ground.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For by God's Hand, <HI>New-England</HI></L>
<L>was spared from much hurt;</L>
<L>Tho' some buildings he down did fling,</L>
<L>and lev'led with the durt.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We see O Lord, that thou hast jarr'd</L>
<L>most every Habitation;</L>
<L>By that we know, thou'rt strong enough</L>
<L>to sink the whole Creation.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let every Tongue, both Old and Young,</L>
<L>and every Nation praise</L>
<L>The God of Host and Holy Ghost, for Christ, his Saints will raise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>By rending Rocks and by Earth Shocks,</L>
<L>graves open by Direction;</L>
<L>The Saints arose and that to see</L>
<L>our Saviour's Crucifixion.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The old must dye, you can't deny,</L>
<L>the young he doth command;</L>
<L>The middle-age when death engage,</L>
<L>though strong, yet can't withstand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What Age or Sect will then neglect,</L>
<L>a Pardon for to seek;</L>
<L>When God hath told the Young and Old</L>
<L>as plain as Words can speak.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then do not say old People may</L>
<L>be e'er too old for Death;</L>
<L>For it is sent in a Moment,</L>
<L>'twill snatch away their Breath.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then O young Man, don't say you can</L>
<L>your self from Death deliver;</L>
<L>Your Fathers surely now are dead;</L>
<L>Can Prophets live for ever?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O how can we who sinners be</L>
<L>expect a dwelling here?</L>
<L>When God doth call, both great and small</L>
<L>to Judgment must appear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What shall I say, of Youth, I pray;</L>
<L>O! Can they Conquer Death?</L>
<L>For when it goes with deadly Blows,</L>
<L>'twill strike away their Breath.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There comes a Day, the Scriptures say,</L>
<L>when every Tribe must meet,</L>
<L>To see the Judge of Quick and Dead,</L>
<L>at his Tribunal Seat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O what a Day the Scriptures say,</L>
<L>the EARTHQUAKE doth foretell;</L>
<L>O turn to God, lest by his Rod,</L>
<L>he cast thee down to Hell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Mountains like Rams &amp; Hills like Lambs,</L>
<L>they Skipping till declin'd;</L>
<L>The Rocks then clifts so fast,</L>
<L>no Shelter could I find.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where shall I run for Shelter then,</L>
<L>but unto Christ my Rock,</L>
<L>And pray that he will Shelter me</L>
<L>amongst his chosen Flock.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That I might stand at Christ's right Hand</L>
<L>the Day of Great Assize;</L>
<L>And sing most sweet and fly to meet,</L>
<L>my Jesus in the Skies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O God of Grace shine on my Face,</L>
<L>The Beams of Glory shine;</L>
<L>That I might Sing to Christ my King,</L>
<L>when he says I am thine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then do attend, O Lord and send,</L>
<L>thy <HI>Jonah</HI> unto us;</L>
<L>That he may Preach and ever Teach,</L>
<L>and take away the Curse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then give us Space and give us Grace,</L>
<L>that we may give thee praise;</L>
<L>We know not but we shall be sunk</L>
<L>in less than forty Days.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Blessed be God that I have trod</L>
<L>the Earth that might have fell;</L>
<L>For it is he that maketh me,</L>
<L>in Safety for to dwell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lord guide our Way in every Day,</L>
<L>and give us Hearts of Prayer;</L>
<L>That so we may not go the Way</L>
<L>into the Devil's Snare.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Pardon the Sin we was born in,</L>
<L>that's the Original;</L>
<L>And keep us from the Way that goes</L>
<L>into the Gate of Hell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And let O Lord, thy Spirit guard,</L>
<L>our Bodies Day and Night;</L>
<L>Thou might most justly cut us off,</L>
<L>and cast us out of Sight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Lord hath told he can't behold,</L>
<L>the Face of a Deceiver;</L>
<L>But he delights and so invites</L>
<L>the penitent Believer.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If you deceive and can't believe,</L>
<L>you surely then shall feel,</L>
<L>The Weight of Wrath the Curse for Sloth,</L>
<L>that God will then reveal.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Believe I pray what God did say,</L>
<L>the Words are of his Mouth;</L>
<L>For what he said he'll make it good,</L>
<L>he sware it with an Oath.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Blest three in one, Father and Son,</L>
<L>the Holy Ghost, thy Spirit;</L>
<L>Because that he's the way to thee,</L>
<L>tho' he's not our Merit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And O therefore we must adore</L>
<L>our <HI>Jesus</HI> for his Merit;</L>
<L>For 'tis by the Eternal three,</L>
<L>the Father, Son and Spirit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And pray that he would take from thee</L>
<L>if it should be his Will;</L>
<L>That heavy Judgment which he sent,</L>
<L>and send us Mercies still.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let every knee, Lord bow to thee,</L>
<L>and every Tongue confess;</L>
<L>That thou art Lord, and by thy Word,</L>
<L>dost Judge in Righteousness.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Take away Sin that cursed thing,</L>
<L>in which we did delight:</L>
<L>Make us a People near to God,</L>
<L>and form our Spirits Right.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let us in Time, whilst we have Prime,</L>
<L>for to be getting Store:</L>
<L>Whilst in our Health, for to get Wealth</L>
<L>that last for ever more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Dont covet more, nor cheat the Poor,</L>
<L>dont scorn thy Enemies;</L>
<L>For what you get, by false deceit,</L>
<L>wisdom calls vanity.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If you be great in your Estate,</L>
<L>'twill lead you in a snare;</L>
<L>The little that the poor Man gets</L>
<L>is Blessed, tho' he's Poor.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Dont think that we more Righteous be,</L>
<L>because we did Escape:</L>
<L>Altho' some Towns were totter'd down,</L>
<L>when as the Earth did Shake.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let us not stand at Babels hand,</L>
<L>Let's not a Tower have;</L>
<L>Lest we come down unto the Ground,</L>
<L>and loose our Language then.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O <HI>Jesus!</HI> send Angels to tend</L>
<L>and fetch us home from far;</L>
<L>That we may run to that bright Sun</L>
<L>which is the Morning Star.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And so O Lord, send forth thy word,</L>
<L>into our inward Parts:</L>
<L>And write a Law of Gratitude,</L>
<L>and set it on our Hearts.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Don't when you look despise these Lines,</L>
<L>tho' you may the inditer,</L>
<L>Because my Tongue, is not like one</L>
<L>that is a ready Writer.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And do not look upon these Lines,</L>
<L>to make a merry Story;</L>
<L>But when you read do then proceed,</L>
<L>to give to God the Glory.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then let us join with one Design,</L>
<L>our thankful Voices raise;</L>
<L>And sing to him that dy'd for Sin,</L>
<L>who's worthy of our Praise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For in his Face shines Beams of Grace,</L>
<L>a Pardon hath in Store;</L>
<L>He dy'd for Sin and rose again,</L>
<L>who lives for Evermore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And don't I say forget that Day,</L>
<L>the Eighteenth of <HI>November;</HI></L>
<L>On Tuesday Morn the Lord did warn,</L>
<L>let us always remember.</L>
