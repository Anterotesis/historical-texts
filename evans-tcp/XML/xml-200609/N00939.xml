<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE late REDEMPTION of be∣tween Two and Three Hundred English-Prisoners, that were lan∣guishing in <HI>Barbary</HI> under the Bloody <HI>Tyran∣nies</HI> of the Emperour of <HI>Morocco,</HI> is a Thing that furnishes us with wonderful occasion to Celebrate the <HI>Goodness</HI> &amp; <HI>Glory</HI> of our Great LORD-REDEEMER. And none have herein had more plentiful Occasion, to <HI>Glorify</HI> the LORD, than that most con∣siderable proportion of the English Pri∣soners, which are now returned unto NEW-ENGLAND, the Countrey to which they belonged; and the People of God in this place, whose Prayers to God, for these their Brethren, were so fervent, so constant, so remarkably prosperous.</P>
<P>A Time for solemn <HI>Thanksgiving</HI> with &amp; for these our <HI>Brethren,</HI> was kept by a Num∣ber of <HI>Christians</HI> at <HI>Boston</HI>; on 15. <HI>d.</HI> 1. <HI>m.</HI> 1703▪</P>
<P>And it was that <HI>Thanksgiving,</HI> that produced the ensuing <HI>Meditations</HI>▪ (where∣of indeed a part was also delivered Three Days after, at the more Publick Lecture;) Now Published for a more lasting MONUMENT of Gratitude, for the <HI>Good∣ness of our Saviou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> 'Twas not fit that so Re∣markable a work of Heaven, should pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> without yielding some Revenues of <HI>Praise</HI> to the <HI>Name which is Exalted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> above al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Blessing and Praise</HI>!</P>

<P>WHat the <HI>Psalmist once</HI> made the Beginning of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Dis∣course, we are now to make the Beginning of <HI>Ours; Truly God is Good.</HI> All the Nati∣ons in the world, that acknowled<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> GOD And what <HI>Nations</HI> do <HI>not?</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> make as Universal an Acknowledgement of His <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.

<PB N="4" REF="001123_0004_0FB03EDA267A43F8"/>
never could be well disputed among them. The <HI>Greatness</HI> of God is no where discovered in Heaven or on Earth, but the Discoveries of His <HI>Goodness</HI> do ac∣company it. Yea, the <HI>Goodness</HI> of God, is in His Divine Oracles, called, His <HI>God-head</HI> it self. The Notion of <HI>Goodness</HI> is inse∣perable from the Notion of a GOD. We cannot have any Notion of a GOD, if we have a Notion of any thing <HI>Better</HI> than Him. The <HI>Expe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ience</HI> of all mankind, glo∣riously confirms this Notion of the <HI>Deity.</HI> There is no man, who cannot from his own <HI>Experience,</HI> bring in a Testimony to the <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></P>
<P>But it is an Enquiry of general Con∣cernment; <HI>What Improvement a man should make of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Experience?</HI> And that Enqui∣ry is answered in what is now before us.</P>
<P>The Apostle is fortifying the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> against that very Error, which the Apostate Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> is now fallen into; The Error of, <HI>Justification by our own Good works.</HI> That Error he Refutes, by Demonstrating, That <HI>We a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e all under Sin,</HI> and indeed have no Good works at all to boast of. One might now Cavi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; <HI>What? We have Law-givers, who Judge o∣thers for their Sin; certainly, you will except these at least, from the deep Charge of being

under Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> To this the Apostle replies; Tis <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rue, There were some who <HI>punished S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> in others, but they every one <HI>committed it</HI> themselves; &amp; these, if any in the world, might assure themselves, <HI>That the wrath of God would overtake them.</HI> Our Apostle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> addressing these persons, mentions one signal Exaggeration of all their wick∣edness; that is, The <HI>Experience</HI> which they had of the Divine <HI>Goodness</HI> unto them; very particularly in their Advancements, their Preferments, their easy Circumstan∣ces. They did not <HI>Know,</HI> or Think, the Obligations to <HI>Repentance,</HI> which the <HI>Good∣ness</HI> of God laid upon them.</P>
<P>We find our selves now <HI>Led</HI> unto this DOCTRINE.</P>
<Q>Men should be Led unto <HI>REPENTANCE</HI> of all Sin, by the wonderful <HI>GOODNESS</HI> of that <HI>GOD,</HI> who is affronted and offend∣ed by their Sin.</Q>
<P>Behold, the Truths to be now Assert∣ed:</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>The First PROPOSITION.</HEAD>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere is a REPENTANCE of <HI>all Sin,</HI> in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umbent on, required of, <HI>all that have sin∣ned.</HI> We are advised Act. 17.30. <HI>God commandeth all men every where to Repent.</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="001123_0006_0FB03EDB7438B6A0"/>
But as the <HI>Conscience</HI> of every man Preaches <HI>Repentance</HI> to him, It is now a great CASE of <HI>Conscience, What is Repentance?</HI> Let us bestow some clear Thoughts upon it.</P>
<P>REPENTANCE, largely taken, does intend and include, the whole <HI>Con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ersion</HI> of a sinner, from Sin to God in the Lord Jesus Christ, and the whole <HI>Experience</HI> &amp; <HI>Behaviour</HI> of a sinner under the Regenera∣ting Impressions of the Holy Spirit. But REPENTANCE taken strictly, is thus defined in the Word of God; 2 Cor. 7.10. <HI>A Godly sorrow, wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng a change of mind, not to be sorrowed fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> It is an <HI>A∣mendment</HI> of a sinners Heart &amp; Life, wrought with <HI>Godly sorrow for Sin</HI>; a <HI>Sorrow</HI> issuing in a Joyful Amendment. Or, It is a Grace▪ whereby a sinner affected with, and af∣flicted for, all Sin, Turns from it unto God with a <HI>Reformed</HI> Heart and Life.</P>
<P>We are to be <HI>Led, [Oh! Holy Spirit lead us!</HI>] first unto a <HI>Seeing</HI> of <HI>Sin.</HI> W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> must have a sight of it, that we are Charg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eable with the unparallel'd Sin of our <HI>Firs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Father,</HI> with the Big-bellied Sin of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Nature,</HI> and with <HI>Actual Sins</HI> Innume<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ble. And we must have a <HI>Sight</HI> of it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> every sin wherewith we are Chargeabl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is an Odious, a Dangerous, a Damnab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Evil; an <HI>Abominable Thing.</HI> Our sight a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="7" REF="001123_0007_0FB03EDC37D814E0"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ense must be that, 2 Sam. 24.10. <HI>I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inned, I have done very foolishly.</HI></P>
<P>We are to be <HI>Led</HI> herewithal unto a <HI>Mourning</HI> for <HI>Sin.</HI> Our Spirit must be a <HI>Contrite spirit</HI> because it has been a <HI>Faulty</HI> one. Our <HI>Hearts</HI> must be <HI>Pierc'd,</HI> &amp; <HI>Rent,</HI> &amp; <HI>Broke,</HI> and fill'd with Grief at the view of our <HI>Foolishness.</HI> With <HI>Self-loathing</HI> Souls, we must be able to say, as he, Psal. 38.17, 18. <HI>My sorrow is continually before me, I will be sorry for my sin.</HI></P>
<P>We are to be <HI>Led</HI> hereupon, unto an <HI>Owning</HI> of <HI>Sin.</HI> We must confess before God, that we have <HI>Done</HI> what He has <HI>For∣bidden,</HI> and <HI>left Ʋndone</HI> what He has <HI>Com∣manded</HI> in His <HI>Holy, &amp; Just, &amp; Good Laws</HI>; and confess, that He not only is <HI>Righte∣ous</HI> in all the Miseries that have come up∣on us, but would be so, if we should be made infinitely more miserable. And where <HI>Men</HI> have been Injured by, or Wit∣nesses of our <HI>Transgression, Men</HI> should al∣so Hear our <HI>Confession.</HI> We must be like him, whose Note was; <HI>Psal.</HI> 51.3. <HI>I ac∣knowledge my Transgression.</HI></P>
<P>Finally, We are to be <HI>Led</HI> from <HI>Sin</HI>; to be <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed</HI> into a Divorce, a Distance, an E∣verlasting Seperation from <HI>Sin</HI>▪ We must <HI>Forsake</HI> our Sin; <HI>Abhor</HI> every Sin of Infir∣mity▪ <HI>Allow</HI> no Sin of Presumption; Pur∣sue

the <HI>Death</HI> of Sin, and value it above our very <HI>Life</HI>; and Embrace <HI>God,</HI> &amp; <HI>Christ,</HI> and <HI>Holines<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> as much as we have done <HI>Sin</HI> heretofore; and Consent unto the <HI>Cove∣nant of Grace,</HI> wherein we engage to be forever <HI>for the Lord, and not for another.</HI> The perfection of <HI>Repentance,</HI> is that; Isa. 55 7. <HI>Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cked forsake his way, and the Ʋnrighteous man his thoughts, &amp; let him return unto the Lord.</HI></P>

<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>The Second PROPOSITION.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Wonderful,</HI> Wonderful is the GOOD∣NESS of that GOD, against whom the <HI>Evil</HI> of <HI>Sin</HI> is committed.. Indeed the <HI>Evil</HI> &amp; Venome of <HI>Sin</HI> lies, in its b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing against so <HI>Good</HI> a GOD. In the Titles of our God, <HI>Optimus</HI> appears as bright and soon unto us, as <HI>Maximus</HI>; He is <HI>Good</HI> as well as <HI>Great,</HI> and <HI>Great</HI> in being so very <HI>Good.</HI></P>
<P>But let us Enquire; First; <HI>What is the</HI> Goodness <HI>of God?</HI></P>
<P>I will answer; Tis GOD in Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Bounty</HI>; Or, His Inclination to deal <HI>Bountifully</HI> with His Creatures. It is intimated in that passage, Psal. 119.63. <HI>Thou art Good, and thou doest Good.</HI> He is <HI>Essentially Good</HI>; &amp; He is <HI>Relatively Good.</HI> God Wills, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there should be <HI>something Besides Himself</HI>; but that it should be <HI>All for Himsel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>▪ And then He Delights in these His <HI>Works</HI>; &amp; is <HI>Bountiful</HI> and <HI>Beneficial</HI> unto them. This
<PB N="9" REF="001123_0009_0FB03EE2B14626A8"/>
is the <HI>Goodness</HI> of God! Indeed, the <HI>Good∣ness</HI> of God, in some sort comprehends all His <HI>Attributes.</HI> It was said, Exod. 33.19. <HI>I w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll make all my Goodness pass before thee.</HI> What was this <HI>Goodness,</HI> but the whole Train of the lovely Perfections, and Ex∣cellencies in our God? When <HI>Goodness</HI> does <HI>Contrive</HI> our Happiness, then it is <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sdom</HI>; When <HI>Goodness</HI> does <HI>Effect</HI> our Happiness, then it is <HI>Power</HI>; When <HI>Good∣ness</HI> does <HI>Bestow</HI> our <HI>Happiness,</HI> without <HI>Merit,</HI> then it is <HI>Grace</HI>; When against <HI>Me∣rit,</HI> then it is <HI>Mercy</HI>; When according to <HI>Promise,</HI> then it is <HI>Truth</HI>; When with a Respect unto the <HI>Price</HI> paid for it, then it is <HI>Justice.</HI> Indeed, we are told by our <HI>Good Lord,</HI> Mar. 10.18. <HI>There is none Good but One, and that is God: Originally</HI> Good, <HI>Essentially</HI> Good, <HI>Infinitely</HI> Good: Oh, None so <HI>Good</HI> as He! <HI>Goodness</HI> is the very <HI>Essence</HI> of God. It was not amiss in the <HI>Plato∣nists,</HI> to call Him, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> The <HI>ve∣ry Good, that is Goodness it self, &amp; of it self.</HI></P>
<P>Let us Enquire, Secondly <HI>What are the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e special Displayes,</HI> that God hath given of His <HI>Goodness?</HI></P>
<P>I will Answer; They are <HI>Numberless.</HI> But more particularly, Let there be ful∣fill'd this Day among us, that word, Psal. 145.7, 9. Lord, <HI>They shall abundantly utter
<PB N="10" REF="001123_0010_0FB03EE3C0AC2650"/>
the the memory of thy great Goodness; The Lord is Good to all.</HI></P>
<P>First The works of <HI>Creation,</HI> proclaim the <HI>Goodness</HI> of the God, who has <HI>Created all things, and for whose pleasure they are &amp; were Created.</HI> In the close of the <HI>Creati∣on,</HI> we find, Gen. 1.31. <HI>God saw every thing that He had made, and behold it was very Good.</HI> It is most certain then, That He who made all must be <HI>very Good.</HI> Even an Hea∣then could say, <HI>When God first s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t upon the Creation of the world, He tranform'd Him∣self into Goodness.</HI> The whole <HI>World</HI> is a <HI>Map of Goodness.</HI> As 'tis said of God, <HI>He is Good to all</HI>; so it may be said, <HI>He is Good in all.</HI> Every Creature is an Herald o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Transcendent <HI>Goodness,</HI> that gave Be∣ing unto it. The <HI>Goodness</HI> of God, gave a Being to every Creature; and hath put every Creature into that Order &amp; Station, wherein it <HI>Best</HI> serves the <HI>Good End</HI> for which it was Created. By the <HI>Goodnes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> of God, everv Creature is well provided for, and furnished with all that <HI>Good,</HI> that may help it in the comfortable service of its Creator. But there is no Creature that hath more cause to Celebrate the <HI>Good∣ness</HI> of God, than <HI>Man; Man,</HI> that has Do∣minion over so many other Things; <HI>Man</HI> that is Beautified with such faculties and
<PB N="11" REF="001123_0011_0FB03EE9C8C8AC28"/>
Endowments; <HI>Man,</HI> that is made Lord of a World, wherein so many Servants attend him, surround him, &amp; befriend him▪ Oh! Let not <HI>Man</HI> forget the Praises of his Ma∣kers <HI>Goodness? Man!</HI> Unworthy the Name of a <HI>Man,</HI> if thou art silent, when the whole world about thee conspires to Praise that matchless <HI>Goodness.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. The works of <HI>Redemption,</HI> pro∣clame the <HI>Goodness</HI> of the God, of whom the <HI>Redeemed of the Lord</HI> must say, <HI>He is Good, and His Mercy endureth for ever.</HI> In the <HI>Redemption</HI> of the world, the Sum of the matter is that; Luk. 2.14. <HI>Good will to∣wards men.</HI> But what a <HI>Good God</HI> must He be, that has manifested this <HI>Good Will</HI>! We read of, <HI>The Gospel of the Blessed God.</HI> How should we Bless GOD, &amp; His <HI>Good∣ness,</HI> for the Good Things that are brought unto us in His <HI>Gospel</HI>? Oh! The peerless <HI>Goodness</HI> of God, in <HI>giving His only Bego<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ten Son, that whosoever believes on Him, sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uld not Perish, but have Everlasting Life</HI>! It is <HI>Goodness</HI> in God the <HI>Father,</HI> to choose us unto Everlasting Blessedness; It is <HI>Good∣ness</HI> in God the <HI>Son,</HI> to Buy us unto that Blessedness: It is <HI>Goodness</HI> in God the <HI>Spi∣rit,</HI> to bring us unto that Blessedness. Oh, Look upon the sinful, woful, horrible Con∣dition, whereinto we were plunged by our
<PB N="12" REF="001123_0012_0FB03EED1A5AF2C0"/>
Fall: and say, whether any thing but un∣parallellable <HI>Goodness</HI> could rescue us out of this Condition? Pass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on to contem∣plate the whole <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> intro∣duced by our Lord Jesus Christ; Con∣template the Things engaged in it; <HI>They are Grace, &amp; Glory, &amp; every good Thing</HI>: Contemplate the Terms on which they are engaged; <HI>They are Good Things wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch the Lord our God has required of us.</HI> He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is <HI>Goodness,</HI> Goodness enough sure, to to dazzle the Eyes of the Good <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gels</HI> themselves!</P>
<P>Thirdly. The works of <HI>Providence</HI> pro∣clame the <HI>Goodness</HI> of the God, the <HI>K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g∣dome</HI> of whose <HI>Providence ruleth</HI> over all.

We cannot apprehend God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto good purpose, but as He has Exhibited Him∣self, in our Lord JESUS CHRIST. Our Lord JESUS CHRIST, is, <HI>The Face of God</HI>: That is a Name often used for Him, in the Old Testament: Why? Because God is to be most of all <HI>seen in Him.</HI> We read, 2 Cor. 4.6. <HI>We have the light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God, in the Face of Jesus Christ.</HI> Would we see the <HI>Goodnes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> of God? Let us behold, the <HI>Good∣ness</HI> of our Lord JESUS CHRIST. The Name of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, is that, 1 Pet. 3.13. <HI>The Good One.</HI> And no doubt, our Lord JESUS CHRIST was meant, in many passages of the Old Testa∣ment, where we read about, <HI>The Good Thing,</HI> and, <HI>The Goodness of the Lord.</HI> Our Lord JESUS CHRIST was <HI>Full of all Goodness.</HI> He was not miscalled, when He was called▪ <HI>Good Master.</HI> All He said, was <HI>Good</HI>; All He did, was <HI>Good</HI>; His goodness communicated it self in Acts of Kindness to all that were about Him. It is Reported of Him, <HI>He went about doing of Good.</HI> And He has Charged every one Else, <HI>To Do Good,</HI> even unto the worst of men. He has Damned them for none of His <HI>Disciples,</HI> who do it not. This <HI>Good∣ness</HI> of our Lord JESUS CHRIST was a

<HI>Beaming</HI> forth of that <HI>Goodness</HI> which is in GOD Himself; Our Lord JESUS CHRIST, is, <HI>God manifest in Flesh</HI>: and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e goodness of that Lord, who was but a <HI>Mass of Incarnate Goodness,</HI> express'd unto us in lively Colours, the goodness of God.</P>

<HEAD>The Third PROPOSITION.</HEAD>
<P>The wonderful <HI>Goodness</HI> of God, should be a wonderful <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve</HI> unto us, to RE∣PENT of all our <HI>Sinning</HI> against Him. This is the <HI>Voice</HI> of all the Divine <HI>Good∣ness</HI> unto us; This is the <HI>Vse</HI> we should make of it: <HI>Oh! Repent of Sinning against so good a G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d!</HI></P>
<P>But let us hear this Language, a little more distinctly uttered.</P>
<P>First, The <HI>Goodness</HI> of God, <HI>Leads</HI> us to expect the <HI>Pardon</HI> of our sin, if we do <HI>Return</HI> to Him from all our sin. If a man have no Expectation or Encouragement for a <HI>Pardon,</HI> he will never come unto <HI>Repentance.</HI> That which Encourages a sinner, is, an Hope that God will <HI>Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>don</HI> him, if he do <HI>Repent. Impenitence</HI> will be the certain Consequence of <HI>Desperation.</HI> From his <HI>Despair,</HI> the <HI>Arabians</HI> call the <HI>Devil</HI> by the Name of <HI>Ibliso,</HI> or, <HI>The Des∣perate
<PB N="16" REF="001123_0016_0FB03EF375E38458"/>
One. Despair</HI> will turn a <HI>Sinner</HI> in∣to a <HI>Devil.</HI> Well, but This is one great Point, wherein the goodness of God showe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it self. Dissolve into Tears of <HI>Repentance▪ O Hearts of Stone,</HI> when you hear of this Marvellous <HI>Goodness</HI>! Exod. 34.6.7. <HI>The Lord God is merciful, and gracious, and a∣bundant in goodness, forgiving Iniquity, Transgression, &amp; Sin</HI>: And, Mic. 7.18. <HI>Who is a God like unto thee, that Pardoneth Iniquity, because He delights in Mercy</HI>! Tis true, From the meer <HI>Goodness</HI> of God one could not gather a <HI>Pardon</HI> for the <HI>Repent∣ing Sinner.</HI> For, the <HI>Justice</HI> of God re∣quires a <HI>Satisfaction</HI> for sin; and <HI>Repentance</HI> is no <HI>Satisfact<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on.</HI> But since we know, that through the Tender Mercy of our God, <HI>the Day-spring from on High has vi∣sited us,</HI> and that our Lord Jesus Christ has come to make <HI>Satisfactio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> and Expi∣ation for our sin, we may now conclude it; O ye <HI>Chief of Sinners,</HI> make that Joy∣ful Conclusion; <HI>Certainly, If I Return to so Good a God, after all the Evil that I have committed against Him, He will Pardon me, He will Accept me, He will Adopt me. Never shall I Repent of my Repentance: I that am the blackest Sinner in the world, shall by the goodness of God▪ be washed in the Bloud of His Dear Son, and He will make me one of
<PB N="17" REF="001123_0017_0FB03EF4237A65C0"/>
His Children, and I shall stand before Him, as if I had never Sinned against Him, upon my Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> unto Him. How, How can I go on in Sinning against such Ʋnmatcheable</HI> goodness! Truly, the Natural Inference to be drawn from this admirable <HI>Goodness</HI> of God, is That: Isa. 55.7. <HI>Let the wick∣ed Return unto the Lord, &amp; He will have Mercy on him, &amp; unto our God, for He will abundantly Pardon.</HI> One would think, This were enough to break the Heart of the most obdurate and obstinate Sinner in the World. What? After all thy hor∣rible <HI>Sinfulness,</HI> O man, will the <HI>Goodness</HI> of God, receive thy Returning Soul into its Embraces? And bestow Everlasting <HI>Righteousness</HI> and <HI>Blessedness</HI> upon thee? Surely, An Heart well-steeped in the Oyl of such goodness will be no longer able to Resist the Calls unto <HI>Repentance</HI>! When we are assured, Lam. 3.25. <HI>The Lord is good unto the Soul that seeks Him</HI>; it na∣turally <HI>Leads</HI> us to Resolve, <HI>O my God, I will seek thee, I will seek thee, &amp; no longer Sin against thee!</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, The <HI>Goodness</HI> of God <HI>Leads</HI> us to reckon <HI>Sin,</HI> the most unreasonable and abominable <HI>Evil.</HI> Since God is <HI>Good∣ness</HI> it self, what must that be, that is con∣trary
<PB N="18" REF="001123_0018_0FB03EF50BBC9F98"/>
to God? Certainly, <HI>Sin</HI> must be very <HI>Evil,</HI> because it is contrary to <HI>Good∣ness</HI> it self. Tis with good Reason, that <HI>Sin</HI> is called, Joh. 17 15. <HI>The Evil.</HI> But the <HI>Goodness</HI> of God then pronounces it an unreasonable Thing to Sin against God; and loudly calls upon us, <HI>To abhor that which is Evil</HI>: And such <HI>Abhor∣rence</HI> implyes <HI>Repenta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce.</HI> When we are Tempted unto any sin, how deaf are we to the most powerful Charms that ever were heard, if we do not now hear the Goodness of God thus Charming of us, <HI>Oh! Do not this abominable Thing, which is hateful to the Soul of God, &amp; of Goodness!</HI></P>
<P>It was of old said, <HI>Ye that Love the Lord, Hate Evil.</HI> Oh! Sin, Sin, what an <HI>Evil,</HI> and an <HI>Hateful</HI> Thing wilt thou appear unto us, when we have the <HI>Lovely Good∣ness</HI> of God before our Eyes! Yea, Inas∣much as God is good, we must believe, That His <HI>Commandment</HI> is always <HI>Holy &amp; Righteous, &amp; Good.</HI> If the <HI>Command∣ment</HI> be good, Say, O Reasonable Soul, whether it be not an <HI>Evil</HI> Thing to Transgress the <HI>Commandment?</HI> It is <HI>Re∣pentance</HI> to count it so. The more Good we see that GOD is, the more Vile we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hall see that SIN is. The goodness of
<PB N="19" REF="001123_0019_0FB03EF76F102C08"/>
God, <HI>Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds</HI> us to loath and leave such a loathsome Vileness; and to say with him, Gen. 39.9. <HI>Oh, How shall I do this Wicked∣ness, and Sin against God?</HI> Such, even such are the Resentments, wherewith Sin is to be considerd. <HI>The</HI> Good God <HI>is of purer Eyes than to behold Sin: with what Eyes then shall I behold Sin, which is a Contrad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct∣ion to the purity of God! Why should I by Sin, renounce my Dependance on God as my Creator and my Governer, &amp; a pitiful Worm, go to controul the Authority of the God, who has Millions of bright Angels to wait upon Him? Why should I by Sn, violate the Laws of the only Wise GOD, &amp; find fault with that Will of Heaven, which is nothing but a transcript of the most Exquisite Wisdom? Why should I flout Omniscience, &amp; slight Omnipo∣tence, &amp; by my bold Sin, dare Thund<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rbolts, &amp; send a Defiance to the Almighty?</HI> Sin, 'Tis a Monster, whose mouth is always full of the most nefandous <HI>Blasphemies.</HI> Oh! Why does not the Goodness of God, stop the mouth of the Monster, and im∣pose upon the Blasphemer an Eternal si∣lence!</P>
<P>Thirdly, The <HI>Goodness</HI> of God <HI>Leads</HI> us to Detest Sin, under the Character of the Highest <HI>Ingratitude</HI> unto the most High
<PB N="20" REF="001123_0020_0FB03EF7E34F4E80"/>
God. There is nothing more Detesta∣ble than <HI>Ingratitude</HI>: The Unthankful are the Evil; None so <HI>Evil</HI> as they! Now every sin, 'tis no less than a <HI>Denying</HI> of God, and a <HI>Defying</HI> of God, and a <HI>Re∣proaching</HI> of God. It is said of the Sin∣ner, Numb. 15.30. <HI>He Reproaches the Lord.</HI> All the wrong that can possibly be done to the Blessed God, SIN does it. It is not possible to offer any <HI>Contempt</HI> or <HI>Mischief</HI> unto the Almighty, but what is offered by Sin continually. Yea, <HI>Sin</HI> strikes at the very <HI>Life</HI> of God Himself: It fetches an impotent stroke at the very Heart of the Everliving God; The Aim of Sin is to <HI>Ʋngod the Great God!</HI> Horri∣ble to be spoken! And here lies the Ag∣gravation of the Baseness of Sin: Tis a∣gainst a GOD, of such marvellous <HI>Good∣ness.</HI> Here, here is the right strain of a Genuine, and Evangelical Repentance; <HI>O my God, I am Troubled, I am Troubled, that I have Sinned against a God of such in∣finite</HI> Goodness: <HI>And how can I find in my Heart any more to Sin against so</HI> Good <HI>a God</HI>! The Goodness of God, has made us partakers of many and mighty Fa∣vours. Very Good Things, and Great ones, have been done for us, by the go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d∣ness of God. If we go on in Sin, tis a
<PB N="21" REF="001123_0021_0FB03EF8CDF9E950"/>
base Requital of Goodness. The good∣ness of God▪ Expostulates with us, Deut. 32.6. <HI>Do ye thus requite the Lord, O fool∣ish People &amp; unwise?</HI> It made the Heart of <HI>Saul</HI> to relent, when he saw the Good∣ness of <HI>David,</HI> in sparing him; <HI>Then said</HI> Saul, <HI>I have Sinned, Return, for I will do thee no more Harm, because my Soul was precious in thine Eyes; behold, I have played the Fool, &amp; have Err'd exceeding∣ly!</HI> Every sin of ours endeavours an <HI>Harm</HI> to the Good God; Yea, but, Oh man, when thou seest the <HI>Goodness</HI> of God, sparing thee, saving thee, feed∣ing thee, and helping thee; methinks it should lead thee, with a Repenting Soul to say; <HI>Lord, I have Sinned; but I will Return unto thee; I will do no more Harm; the welfare of my Soul, &amp; all my other &amp; lesser Interests has been precious in thine Eyes; I have played the Fool, &amp; Erred ex∣ceedingly, in Sinning against thy</HI> Goodness; <HI>I have done iniquity, but, Oh, let me do so no more!</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, The <HI>Goodness</HI> of God, <HI>Leads</HI> us to study, how we may Thankfully <HI>Serve</HI> Him, and not Wickedly <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n</HI> against Him. The Benefits done for us, by the Goodness of God, our glorious <HI>Benefact∣or,</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="001123_0022_0FB03EFAFA0F0598"/>
put us upon Enquiring, like him, Psal. 116.12. <HI>What shall I render to the Lord, for all His Benefits?</HI> And now, what shall we Render, but our very <HI>Selves,</HI> and all that we <HI>are,</HI> and all that we <HI>have</HI>? To Render our selves unto the Lord, is to Repent of our sins against the Lord. Our <HI>Consecration</HI> of our selves unto God, is the <HI>Consummation of</HI> Repentance. The <HI>Goodness</HI> of God has produced us from <HI>Nothing</HI> into our present Existence; and has preserved us in this Existence, from thousands of mischiefs that would have assaulted us. It is the <HI>Goodness</HI> of God that supplies all our wants; Tis Gods <HI>Air</HI> we breathe, 'tis Gods <HI>Ground</HI> we tread, it is Gods <HI>Cloathes</HI> that cover us. It is the <HI>Goodness</HI> of God which defends us from a Million of <HI>Deaths,</HI> and affords multitudes of convenient Circumstances for our Inward and our Outward man. What is the Call of all this goodness? But, <HI>Oh! Live unto that</HI> good God, <HI>from whom, and on whom, it is, that thou lived at all.</HI> We are told, <HI>One would even dare to Dy for a</HI> good <HI>Man.</HI> And shall any One be loth to <HI>Live unto a Good God</HI>? Oh! Let there not be one such among <HI>You,</HI> my Hearers! After all the Goodness &amp; Mercy that has followed us all our days,
<PB N="23" REF="001123_0023_0FB03EFD60B3B828"/>
what is the Return that we are to make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto our good God? We are so directed; Deut. 10.12. <HI>And, now, what does the Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y God require of thee? But to fear the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord thy God, and to walk in His wayes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d to love Him, and to serve the Lord thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od, with all thy Heart and with all thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ul.</HI> Until we abandon our sins, we are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erpetually Fighting against God; Yea, most horrid! And with weapons of His own! As <HI>David</HI> said of <HI>Nabal, In vain have I kept, all that this Fellow has</HI>! Thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay the good God, say of the Sinner; <HI>All the Effects of my</HI> Goodness <HI>upon this wretch, are utterly thrown away; he makes me no suitable Return at all, for my Bene∣fits.</HI> No; The Goodness of God should <HI>Lead</HI> us to such Devotion, as that; Rom. 12.1. <HI>For the Mercies of GOD, present your Bodies a living Sacrifice, Holy, Accepta∣ble unto GOD, which is your Reasonable Ser∣vice.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly, and Finally, The <HI>Goodness</HI> of God <HI>Leads</HI> us to an <HI>Imitation</HI> of such goodness What is <HI>Repentance</HI>? Tis by the Prophet thus described, <HI>A ceasing to do</HI> Evil, <HI>and a learning to do</HI> Good. Well, when we see the Goodness of God, al∣wayes
<PB N="24" REF="001123_0024_0FB03EFDE1B2D4C0"/>
wayes do good, we have an Invitation to an Imitation of it. It is pressed▪ Mat. 5.45. <HI>Do Good to them that Hath you, that you may be the Children of your Father which is in Heaven,</HI> for He doth so. — And again, Luk. 6.35 <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Good, and you shall be the Children of the Highest</HI>; for He doth so. Sirs, when we see the adorable goodness of God, Oh why does it not inspire us with a Dis∣position, like what we see in our good Father? Why does it not mightily dis∣pose us, to do good unto all that are about us, to do all the good that eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we can? Yea, to overcome evil with good? A good Heart, and an Heart unspeakably set upon the doing of good, is a mighty symptom and effort of a most Real <HI>Repentance. Repentance</HI> will make a man, become a good man. O Man, If the goodness of God will not, what can <HI>Lead</HI> thee unto it?</P>

<P><PB N="25" REF="001123_0025_0FB040579FD0ED90"/><HI>O Man, Despisest thou the Riches of the Goodness of God,</HI> while thou art not by that <HI>Goodness,</HI> Effectually <HI>Led unto Repen∣tance?</HI> Yes, Thou verily dost so.

<P>To carry on this <HI>Expostulation,</HI> We will propose to Consideration.</P>
<P>First. That the <HI>Goodness</HI> of God hath plenteously and wondrously look'd upon you, O my Hearers, This is most un∣questionable. It was truly said, Psal 68.10. <HI>Thou, O God, hast prepared of thy good∣ness
<PB N="26" REF="001123_0026_0FB0405C0FFA3D90"/>
for the Poor.</HI> Oh, There are none of you so <HI>Poor,</HI> so Low, so Mean, but the <HI>Riches of the Goodness</HI> of the most <HI>High</HI> God has reached you. There is none of you all, though never so <HI>Small,</HI> but the <HI>Good∣ness</HI> of God has done Thousands of <HI>Great</HI> Thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for that person. There has not one day rolled over you, wherein the <HI>Goodness</HI> of God, hath not shone upon you with Rayes far more than those of the Sun in the Firmament. GOODNESS, GOODNESS, is written every where in Capitals round about us. <HI>There is no speech where its Voice is not heard</HI>; and yet, Oh! That the <HI>Voice</HI> were duly heard! In short, O man, Art thou not yet out of <HI>Hell</HI>? This, This is from the most undeserved <HI>Goodness</HI> of God!</P>
<P>Secondly; If now, after all this <HI>Good∣ness,</HI> your Sin be not <HI>Repented</HI> of, tis be∣yond Question, there is a monstrous <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s∣ingenuity,</HI> in your sinful <HI>Impenitency.</HI> Alas, what has been <HI>Your</HI> Carriage hitherto, but <HI>Theirs</HI>?

<PB N="27" REF="001123_0027_0FB0405F99641F40"/>
the <HI>Worse</HI> for that <HI>Goodness.</HI> As it was said of them; <HI>According to the goodness of their Land, they made goodly Images</HI>: Thus it may be said of you; <HI>According to the goodness of the Lord, you have been the more Assisted, and Improved, and Em∣boldened in your sinful Idolatries.</HI> Those daily Refreshments, with which the <HI>Good∣ness</HI> of God, Strengthens you to Honour Him, don't you Abuse them to bring but the more Dishonour to God, and so <HI>Turn H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Grace into Wantonness.</HI> That Abun∣dance of Enjoyments, with which the <HI>Goodness</HI> of God is Enriching of you, are you not the more Proud, and Vain, and Carnal, and Sensual, and Senseless for it? Man, If there be one spark of <HI>Reason</HI> left in thy Soul, now let it revive, and shine forth, and speak out, and say; <HI>Can any thing be so unreasonably Disingenuous?</HI></P>
<P>Lastly; Consider, In the Fear of God, Consider, What will be the <HI>End</HI> of This? <HI>Oh! That you were so wise as to Consider the Latter End!</HI> It is the <HI>Thunder,</HI> that fol∣lows upon the <HI>Lightning,</HI> which has all this while Entertained us; <HI>Not knowing that the Goodness of God leads thee to Repen∣tance</HI>; It follows; <HI>After thy Hardness &amp; Impenitent Heart, thou treasurest up unto thy self Wrath against the day of Wrath.</HI> It

But Oh! What Calamities, Oh! What Confusions, will ensue upon such
<PB N="29" REF="001123_0029_0FB040618114FA40"/>
a <HI>Confiscation?</HI> Yea, Instead of those things, which the <HI>Goodness</HI> of God has done for Ungodly men, the <HI>Vengeance</HI> of God has terrible things to do on them throughout Eternal Ages. The <HI>Impeni∣tent</HI> Sinner, under and against the <HI>Goodness</HI> of God, is that <HI>Ʋnprofitable</HI> Servant, of whom we find that Order given, Mat. 25 30. <HI>Cast the Ʋnprofitable Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vant into outer Darkness; there shall be Weeping and gnashing of Teeth.</HI> Unhappy man, If thou fall into that Condemnation, thy Fate will be that of the Rich man in the Parable, to whom in the place of Torment, it was said, <HI>Remember, that in thy Life-t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me thou didst Receive thy Good Things; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow thou art Tormented.</HI> One of the greatest men in the world, Profess'd, <HI>That he often thought on those words, but he always Trem∣bled as often as he thought on them.</HI></P>

our Friends, with whom we are now Uniting our THANKSGIVINGS unto our <HI>Lord-Redeemer.</HI></P>
<P>We have been so called upon, Psal. 107.1, 2. <HI>O give Thanks unto the Lord, for He is Good; for His Mercy endureth for ever. Let the Redeemed of the Lord say so, whom He hath Redeemed from the Hand of the Enemy.</HI> Behold, some that have been remarkably the <HI>Redeemed of the Lord,</HI> are at this Day to <HI>Say so</HI>; and we are in∣vited now to joyn with them when they <HI>Say so.</HI></P>
<P>These our Brethren, are delivered through the <HI>Goodness</HI> of God, from the most horrible <HI>Captivity</HI> in the world; and, we may observe several Remarkables in their Deliverance: 'Twill be an agree∣able and an acceptable Revenue of Glo∣ry unto our <HI>Lord-Redeemer,</HI> for us to ob∣serve such Remarkables.</P>
<P N="1">I. It is a Remarkable <HI>Goodness</HI> of God That the <HI>Lives</HI> of these our Friend, have b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en prolonged and preserved under a <HI>bit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Servituae,</HI> that was enough to have made them, even <HI>wea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aves.</HI></P>
<P>Their <HI>Way</HI> of <HI>Living,</HI> (or, shall I not rather say, their way of <HI>Dying</HI>) 'twas full of astoni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hing Hardships. Many, ma∣ny

<HI>Dyed</HI> under the Hardships: But these are this Day declaring, <HI>Having obtained Help from God, we continue to this Day.</HI></P>
<P>Their Condition cannot perhaps, be more livelily in a few words painted out, than in the words, of the Brief, which their late Majesties, K. WILLIAM and Q. MARY, granted on their behalf.</P>
<P><Q>A Great Number of Our Good Sub∣jects peaceably following their Employ∣ments at Sea, have been taken by the Turkish Pirates of <HI>Algiers, Salley, Bar∣bary,</HI> and other places on the Coast of <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rica,</HI> nnd now remain Slaves, in Cru∣el and Inhumane Bondage, without any <HI>Dayes of Rest,</HI> either on the <HI>Turkish Sab∣bath</HI> or Ours, except Four Dayes in a Year; being kept to Extream <HI>Labour</HI>; from which, some endeavouring a little Rest, several of them were barbarously Murdered. Neither is their <HI>Diet</HI> any more tolerable than their <HI>Lab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur</HI>; Great Numbers being allow'd no other Food, than decay'd <HI>Barley,</HI> which stinketh so, that the Beasts refuse to eat it. And often they are not permitted to go from their Labour, to fetch Water, which is their only Drink; and sometimes driven a∣bout by <HI>Black-a-moors,</HI> who are set over them as Task-masters; and some of
<PB N="33" REF="001123_0033_0FB04064A744EEC8"/>
them have been so severely Whipp'd, that they have dropp'd down Dead.</Q></P>
<P>One that was a Sufferer, has given us this further Account, of the <HI>Barbarian Cruelty</HI> undergone by his Fellow-sufferers.</P>
<P><Q>The poor Christian Captives, that are taken by any of those Hellish Py∣rates, belonging to the Emperour of <HI>Morocco,</HI> are brought up to <HI>Macqueness</HI>; being kept at Hard work, from Day-light in the Morning till Night: carry∣ing Earth on their Heads in great Bask∣ets, driven to and fro, with barbarous Negroes by the Emperours Order; and when they are drove home by the Ne∣groes at Night, to their Lodging, which is on the cold Ground, in a Vault or hollow place in the Earth, laid over with great Beams athwart, and Iron Bars o∣ver them; they are told in there, like Sheep, and out in the Morning; and if any be wanting, he quickly secures the Negroes, and sends out a parcel of his Guard, to look for them. Their Food is Bread, made of old rotten Barley; and their Drink, Water, when they can get it: Many times, when they are hur∣ried unto their work in a Morning, not knowing, whether they shall be able to
<PB N="34" REF="001123_0034_0FB040651FD7B3F0"/>
undergo their Afflictions till Night and when they are drove Home, expect∣ing Rest, the Tyrant sends some of his Negroes, to hurry them again to work, either to hale down Walls, cut Gates, or the like; keeping them both Day and Night, many times without either Bread or Water, which is all their Sust∣enance. When they have done That, the Negroes dare not drive them home, before he gives Order, lest they be kill'd for their so doing. When they have his Order, they drive them home, tell them over, and so lock them up until Day-light in the Morning. There are Three Hundred and Forty Englishmen (<HI>sayes he</HI>) in this sore Captivity.</Q></P>
<P>This is the Captivity, that has been <HI>Out-lived,</HI> and now <HI>Escap'd,</HI> by these our Brethren.</P>
<P>It is much, that their horrid <HI>Labour</HI> did not <HI>Kill</HI> them, in a Climate, so hot at some Times, and so wet at others. One would have said, <HI>Their Strength must have been the Strength of Stones, &amp; their Flesh of Brass.</HI> Or their Life could not have been pro∣longed under such prodigious Fatigues.</P>
<P>It is much, that their forlorn <HI>Diet</HI> should not rather <HI>Kill</HI> them, than <HI>Feed</HI> them. So small, and so vile their Al∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owance
<PB N="35" REF="001123_0035_0FB04069591F7CF0"/>
of <HI>Bread,</HI> that it is plain, <HI>They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ved not by Bread alone, but by the Word of God.</HI></P>
<P>It is much, that they have <HI>Out-lived</HI> the Sorrows, the <HI>Deadly Sorrows,</HI> that must sieze upon their Spirits, when the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ierce Robbers had siez'd upon them. By the <HI>Sorrows of their Hearts,</HI> why were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot their <HI>Spirits broken,</HI> and Killed, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey saw themselves dragg'd away from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll the Comforts of Life, and felt them∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elves fearfully <HI>broken in the place of Dra∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons,</HI> and were Hopeless of ever being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecovered out of their doleful Circum∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ances? Methinks, I see them <HI>Crying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom the Belly of Hell, Lord, The Waters <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ompass me about, even to the Soul, the Depth closes me round about; the Weeds are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rapt about my Head; the Earth, with her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ars, is about me forever.</HI> Oh!

Truly, <HI>The Lord</HI> has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t last <HI>Loosed the Prisoners</HI>: 'twas He, who <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aised up,</HI> those that were thus <HI>bowed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>wn</HI>: Some of them for a whole Pren∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ice-ship of Years, and One here even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Nineteen Years together. This pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ervation of our Friends, has been yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore signalized, where any of them, en∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eavoured a <HI>Flight</HI> out of the Hands of
<PB N="36" REF="001123_0036_0FB0406A7A5F1998"/>
their Enemies, but were unhappily Re∣taken by those bloody Hands. For it was the manner of the <HI>Tygre,</HI> whom they call the <HI>Emperour,</HI> when such Retake<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Prisoners were brought before him▪ im∣mediately to run a <HI>Lance</HI> through the Hearts of them. We have some with us at this Hour, who once expected the stroke of the <HI>Lance,</HI> and can ascribe it unto nothing, but this, <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at the Heart of the King was in the Hand of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Oh! <HI>That men would Praise the Lord, for His Goodness, and for these His won∣derful Works unto the Children of men.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. It is a Remarkable <HI>Goodness</HI> of God, That these our Friends enjoyed so many <HI>Supports,</HI> which Heaven and Earth afford∣ed unto them, under their Insupportable Calamities.</P>
<P>How, One would wonder <HI>How,</HI> were their minds kept from <HI>Fainting</HI> under the Grievous Things▪ that continually befel them, while, for many Years together, their <HI>Lives hung in doubt before them, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they were in fear day and night, and bad m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Assurance of their Life; In the Morning the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> said, Would God it were Evening, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Evening they said, Would God it were Morn∣ing</HI>! Doubtless, the Good Spirit of God
<PB N="37" REF="001123_0037_0FB0406BCBAA1580"/>
often i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> radiated their minds, with such Considerations, as were their Consolati∣ons.</P>
<P>Behold, A Support from the <HI>Goodness</HI> of God!</P>
<P>If they cannot say, <HI>The Barbarous people show'd us no little Kindness,</HI> yet some hap∣py Things fell out now &amp; then, to shelter them from some <HI>Ʋnkindnesses</HI> as would else have been offered.</P>
<P>Behold, A Support from the <HI>Goodness</HI> of God!</P>
<P>It was a mighty Relief unto them▪ that the English Captives there formed them∣selves into a SOCIETY, and in their <HI>Sla∣very</HI> enjoyed the <HI>Lib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y</HI> to meet on the Lords Day Evening, every Week &amp; annual∣ly chuse a <HI>Master</HI> and <HI>Assistents,</HI> and form a <HI>Body of Laws,</HI> to prevent and suppress <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sorders</HI> among themselves. The <HI>Good Orders</HI> of their Society, were a great <HI>Re∣putation,</HI> and <HI>Preservation</HI> unto them. And it afforded them no small <HI>Comforts to de∣light them, in the multitude of the Griefs up∣on them,</HI> that at their Meetings they still had one or other, who by his <HI>Prayers,</HI> and other Exercises of Religion among them, greatly Edified them.</P>
<P>Behold, A Support from the <HI>Goodness</HI> of God!</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="001123_0038_0FB0406CD0EEBB68"/>And God Supported them, with Rai∣sing up such as were concerned more ways than one, to supply them in their deplorable Necessities. There were some (as a <HI>Carver</HI>) among themselves, that were able to advise &amp; assist the rest, and others (as a <HI>Balam</HI>) at home, were full of Charitable endeavours to send them Comfortable Assistences. And, a, <HI>Past∣oral Letter</HI> or two, Published, and Scat∣tered among them, was blessed of God, for their unspeakable Advantage, and perhaps, had no little Influence, to pre∣pare them for the <HI>Salvations</HI> which they have now received.</P>
<P><HI>Oh, That men would Praise the Lord, for His Goodness, and for His wonderful Works unto the Children of men!</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. It is a Remarkable <HI>Goodness</HI> of God, That none of these our Friends proved <HI>Apostates,</HI> from our Holy Religion, when they were under so many <HI>Temptations</HI> to Apostasy.</P>
<P>There was now and then a wretched Christian, who Renounced <HI>Christianity</HI> &amp; Em<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raced <HI>Mahometism.</HI> If These our Friends had been left unto themselves, under their amazing Trials, <HI>They,</HI> They would have done so too! Sirs▪ I hope
<PB N="39" REF="001123_0039_0FB0406D6DD790B0"/>
you readily own, That you did not keep your selves from Falling! Wherefore unto Him that kept you from <HI>Falling, be Glory and Majesty, Dominion and Power, both now and forever.</HI> Oh: Let us admire Sovereign <HI>Grace,</HI> and shout, <HI>Grace! Grace!</HI> upon it, that though these our Friends, were <HI>covered with the shadow of Death,</HI> yet they did not <HI>Forget the Name of our God,</HI> into which they had been Baptised, nor <HI>deal falsely in their</HI> Baptismal <HI>Covenant</HI>; nor stretch out their Hands unto the Im∣postor <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and his accursed <HI>Alco∣ran</HI>!</P>
<P>Our Glorious Lord JESUS CHRIST has now and then had a <HI>Martyr,</HI> of late, in the <HI>Torrid zone</HI> of <HI>Africa.</HI></P>
<P>One Story (related by <HI>Brooks,</HI>) may not unprofitably be now repeated.</P>
<P><Q>An <HI>English-man</HI> and a <HI>French-man</HI> were taken, endeavouring an Escape▪ The next Day, the <HI>English-man</HI> and the <HI>French-man</HI> were carred up to <HI>Mac∣queness</HI> in Irons, before the Emperour, who by the Moors was informed, what was done. The Emperour, upon Ex∣amination, told them, if they did not immediately turn <HI>Moors,</HI> he would kill them. The <HI>French-man</HI> yielded; the Emperour then threatned the <HI>English-man,</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="001123_0040_0FB0406E38613270"/>
if he did not turn, he would quick∣ly kill him. He made Answer, Gods Power was greater than the Devils, &amp; let him do what he would, he should not make him turn <HI>Moor.</HI> The Em∣perour called for his Sword, and imme∣diately fell to cutting him, threatning him still, to turn▪ He said, <HI>He was brought up in the Faith of Jesus Christ, &amp; he would not forsake it.</HI> Then this inhu∣mane Wretch in great spleen, Cut him till he fell down, and hack'd &amp; hew'd him, as if had been butchering an Oxe, and caused the Negro-boyes to run his Body full of Holes, with Knives, till his Body was as full of Holes as possible it could be. When he had so done, <HI>Bring,</HI> said he in his own Language, <HI>Four Eng∣lish Dogs to fetch that Dog away.</HI> And as they carried his Body away, the Ne∣gro-boyes stoned them, saying, That should be the end of them, if they did not turn <HI>Moors</HI>: But they were glad to go quietly without answering again; if they had made any Reply, they had cer∣tainly been fallen upon by the <HI>Negro-boyes.</HI> So their greatest satisfaction was, his Dying in the Christian Faith, and his counting that more precious than his own Life, holding the same stedfast
<PB N="41" REF="001123_0041_0FB0406EF2B77988"/>
before that Cruel Tyrant, while he had Breath in his Body. Then they carried him to the place, where they lodged under ground; so took off his Irons, and kept there all Night; and the next Morning carried him where he was to be buried, the Negroes still stoning of them as they went along. As soon as they had laid his Body in the ground, they were hurried by the Ne∣groes to work again after their usual manner.</Q></P>
<P>These our Friends, have not thus <HI>Re∣sisted unto Blood.</HI> But yet they have not been without Bloody <HI>Temptations.</HI> And, O my Hearers, Will you not now Glori∣fy the <HI>Faithfulness</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ, who would not suffer these our Friends to be <HI>Tempted above what they were able,</HI> but made even their <HI>Temptations</HI> to be their <HI>Preservations</HI>! One would have thought, that if any thing should have made them turn <HI>Infidels,</HI> it would have been their <HI>Adversity,</HI> and the Hope of getting thereby some Relaxation of their <HI>Adversity.</HI> No; It was remark'd, That the <HI>Renegado's</HI> for the most part, were those who suffered the least share of <HI>Ad∣versity.</HI> The Fellows who enjoy'd more <HI>Prosperity</HI>▪ &amp; lived in Gentlemens Houses,
<PB N="42" REF="001123_0042_0FB0407038C75EB0"/>
with much of Idleness, and Luxury, and Liberty, THESE for the most part were they that fell into <HI>the Snare of the Wicked</HI>; when those who were toiling about <HI>Castles</HI> or <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rickil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> continued stedfast in the Faith of our Lord JESUS CHRIST. It was also a notable thing; That few did ever come to cast off the Faith of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, until they were first grown very Vicious in their Morals, and fallen into Vices and Scandals, which made 'em asham'd of appearing before their better disposed Countre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>-men; THEN 'twas that they grew desperate, and they departed from the Lord with such a total and final Backsliding, that the <HI>Soul of God had no pleasure in them.</HI> How Forlorn, how Undone, how Damned for both Worlds had you been, if you had been given over to become such vile <HI>De∣serters?</HI> You saw the strange Hand of God, upon <HI>Them:</HI> You saw them Hated, Loathed, Scorned, both by the <HI>Baptised</HI> and the <HI>Circumcised</HI>: You saw they got nothing, but were <HI>Temporally</HI> more abject than they were before, &amp; <HI>Eternally</HI> siezed by <HI>Chains of Darkness</HI> impossible ever to be taken off. You are Glad, that you have been saved from your <HI>Apostasy.</HI> Did you save your-selves? No; We hear
<PB N="43" REF="001123_0043_0FB0407199880E78"/>
you humbly saying this Day before the Lord and His People; <HI>Not unto us, Not unto us, O Lord, but unto thy Name give Glory!</HI> And, <HI>Lord, Thou art He who has delivered my Soul from Death, my Eyes from Tears, and my Feet from Falling.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore yet once again;</P>
<P><HI>Oh! That men would Praise the Lord for His Goodness, and for His wonderful Works to the Children of Men.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. It is a Remarkable <HI>Goodness</HI> of God, That now the Deliverance of these our Friends is accomplished, and in a signal <HI>Answer to Prayer</HI> accomplished, and this not without great Obstrctuions to the <HI>Accomplishment.</HI></P>
<P>Such was the known Treachery and Perfidy of the False Tyrant, who held these our Friends in Bondage, that every one despaired of their Deliverance.</P>
<P>For instance;</P>
<P>In the Year, 1680. the English Cap∣tives, which were under this fierce Ty∣rant, sent over a Petition to the King of <HI>England,</HI> that something might be done for them. An English Captain being sent over, came to an Agreement with him, for their Deliverance, and the Cap∣tives were actually put into his Hands.
<PB N="44" REF="001123_0044_0FB04071EA5616C8"/>
The <HI>Shack</HI> of the Jews, who had order to build a Town for this Faithless Mo∣narch, came to him, telling him that if he would let him have the <HI>Christians,</HI> to build the <HI>Jews-Town,</HI> he would give him as much Money as the English Captain had agreed with him for. The next Morning, this <HI>African Monster</HI> sent out his Negroes, to drive back the Christi∣ans, which were hurried again to their old Slavery, in the Cruellest manner ima∣ginable: And there was an end of the matter! Though the Vengeance of God quickly pursued that Jew, who not with∣out the Connivance of the Emperour, had his Brains horribly trod out, by one who purposely Rode over him.</P>
<P><HI>The Time, the sett Time for Favour,</HI> was not <HI>then</HI> come. <HI>Now</HI> 'tis; and this with a Touch from Heaven upon the Heart of a <HI>Devil Incarnate</HI> compelling him to deal more truly than he use to do.</P>
<P>The Difficulty of Gathering the <HI>Ran∣some</HI> was at last got over; every other Impediment was removed: And, <HI>who art thou, O Mountain, that shall sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in the way,</HI> when Gods Time is come? Who is the <HI>Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sherd of the Earth,</HI> that shall pro∣pose to <HI>Command the Lord concerning His Children</HI>?</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="001123_0045_0FB04072A68B10C0"/>To what a sweet <HI>Change</HI> of their Con∣dition, are these our <HI>Friends</HI> now arrived! Instead of Hellish <HI>Moors</HI> at their pleasure Kicking and Scourging and Plaguing of them, they are in the Arms of their most agreeable Relatives, and others whom they daily behold with mutual Delight. Instead of being driven to Servile, Tedi∣ous, Vexing <HI>Employments,</HI> they are now Employ'd Easily, and as they would be. Instead of the <HI>Sabbaths</HI> which they saw without any <HI>Rest</HI> in them, they have now as many Opportunities for the Ser∣vice of God and their Souls, as they wish for.</P>
<P>What has brought all this about? Oh! 'Tis PRAYER, 'Tis PRAYER, that has done it all. Give me leave to speak it with all due Humility; This Delive∣rance never began thoroughly to operate, until God began to awaken a <HI>Spirit of Prayer</HI> in the Churches of poor NEW-ENGLAND for it. When the Sons of <HI>New-England,</HI> and of some very Praying people here, fell into so dire a Capti∣vity, presently a Cry of PRAYER made a Noise that reach'd up to Heaven. We did not <HI>Sin by ceasing to Pray for them</HI>· Thus was the <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m of the Lord awakened</HI> for the Deliverance of these our Sons;

<P>We do in the first place, <HI>Pray</HI> to the God of all <HI>Grace,</HI> that you may have the <HI>Grace</HI> to be very sensible of the match∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess Favours that God hath bestowed up∣on you. Look, Oh! Look back, upon your doleful and woful Circumstances in the Hands of a Bitter and Hasty Nation.

But herewith∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l Remember, how much you would once have given, to be brought out of those miserable Confusions. And ac∣knowledge that you have Deserved all your Sufferings, from the Hands of a Righteous God, before whom you must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndeed say, <HI>Lord, Thou hast punished us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar less than our Iniquities have deserved.</HI>

It is a <HI>Surprizing</HI> Mercy of God, that has rescued you from the <HI>Horrible Pit,</HI> into which you were fallen; But that which makes it the more <HI>Surprizing,</HI> is, that it is a <HI>Singular</HI> Mercy. In former Years, the <HI>Lions Den,</HI> in that part of <HI>Barba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> where you have been cast, had this un∣happy Character upon it, <HI>Few or none Re∣turned.</HI> That we now see a Return of so many, who have been a <HI>Prey to those Ter∣rible one<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> truly, 'tis a New, a Strange, &amp; a Great Sight.
