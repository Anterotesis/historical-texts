<L>To conquest and slaughter let Europe aspire,</L>
<L>Whelm nations in blood and wrap cities in fire;</L>
<L>Thy heroes the rights of mankind shall defend,</L>
<L>And triumph pursue them, and glory attend.</L>
<L>A world is thy realm, for a world be thy laws</L>
<L>Enlarg'd as thy empire, and just as thy cause:</L>
<L>On Freedom's broad basis thy empire shall rise—</L>
<L>Extend with the main, and dissolve with the skies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fair Science her gates to thy sons shall unbar,</L>
<L>The east see thy morn hide the beams of her star;</L>
<L>New bards and new sages, unrivall'd, shall soar</L>
<L>To fame, unextinguish'd when time is no more.</L>
<L>To thee, the last refuge for virtue design'd,</L>
<L>Shall fly, from all nations, the best of mankind;</L>
<L>Here, grateful to Heav'n, with transport shall bring</L>
<L>Their incense, more fragrant than odours of spring.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor less shall thy FAIR ONES to glory ascend,</L>
<L>And genius and beauty in harmony blend;</L>
<L>The graces of form shall awake pure desire,</L>
<L>And the charms of the soul still enliven the fire:</L>
<L>Their sweetness unmingled, their manners refin'd,</L>
<L>And virtue's bright image imprest on their mind,</L>
<L>With peace and soft rapture shall teach life to glow,</L>
<L>And light up a smile in the aspect of woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thy fleets to all regions thy pow'r shall display—</L>
<L>The nations admire, and the ocean obey;</L>
<L>Each shore to thy glory its tribute unfold—</L>
<L>And the east and the south yield their spices and gold.</L>
<L>As the day-spring, unbounded, thy splendor shall <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ow,</L>
<L>And earth's mighty kingdoms before thee shall bow;</L>
<L>While the ensigns of union, in triumph unfurl'd,</L>
<L>Hush tumults of war, and give peace to the world.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus as down a lone valley, with cedars o'er-spread,</L>
<L>From war's dread confusion, I pensively stray'd,</L>
<L>The gloom from the face of fair heav'n retir'd;</L>
<L>The winds ceas'd to murmur, the thunders expir'd.</L>
<L>Perfumes, as of Eden, flow'd sweetly along,</L>
<L>And a voice, as of angels, enchantingly sung—</L>
<L>COLUMBIA! COLUMBIA! to glory arise,</L>
<L>The queen of the world, and the child of the skies.</L>
