<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>IN this fair land, where Love and Freedom reign,</L>
<L>Where smiling Plenty crowns each blooming plain,</L>
<L>The hallowed seat of sacred Liberty,</L>
<L>The natal spot, Great WASHINGTON, of thee—</L>
<L>Hail son of valour! in whose noble mind</L>
<L>Philanthropy, with courage is combin'd;</L>
<L>Oh! how intrepid in each glorious cause,</L>
<L>To guard his country from despotic laws,</L>
<L>He speaks the word, and ready to obey,</L>
<L>A thousand heroes throng bright Glory's way;</L>
<L>His presence bids tumultuous discord cease,</L>
<L>And lulls internal broils to infant Peace—</L>
<L>But, ah! how easy is it to controul</L>
<L>Where virtue reigns in every patriot soul;</L>
<L>Where courage and humanity's combin'd,</L>
<L>With energetic pow'r to sway the mind!</L>
<L>And, O America! these sons are thine,</L>
<L>These luminaries that will ever shine,</L>
<L>In many a future age and foreign clime,</L>
<L>Their names immortal thro' revolving time.</L>
<L>Ye kind supporters of the drooping muse,</L>
<L>Whose smiles to genius are nectareous dews,</L>
<L>Cheering each bud that else would fade and die,</L>
<L>From every clime to you she loves to fly;</L>
<L>You that can bid the tear of pity flow,</L>
<L>And raise the orphan drooping with her woe;</L>
<L>You that have caus'd the widow's plaints to cease,</L>
<L>And gave the soul of pain, the balm of peace;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="029022_0003_0FDE98460BA9FE10"/>
You that the shafts of war successful wield,</L>
<L>And gain immortal honours in the field—</L>
<L>To you the Auth'ress flies, and asks by me,</L>
<L>The beamy smiles of heavenly clemency.</L>
<L>And you, ye fair, whose ever radiant eyes,</L>
<L>The beam refulgent of bright Sol supplies,</L>
<L>When the kind hero from the field returns,</L>
<L>Whose breast with love, as well as valor burns,</L>
<L>How can your smiles his every care beguile,</L>
<L>Enchant his soul, and banish every toil!</L>
<L>Ah! would you now bestow the wish'd for meed;</L>
<L>Then her endeavour doubtless would succeed.</L>

<HEAD>SCENE I.—A Chamber in Sir Lambert's House</HEAD>
<STAGE>Enter Sir Lambert and Miss Martin.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SIR LAMBERT.</SPEAKER>
<P>O I'm ruined! I'm distracted! I shall break my heart! My poor, dear child has lost her senses. These foolish books, this poetry, this nonsense has turned her brain. What shall I do? Lord Aber∣ford will be here to-morrow; that noble Lord who intended to do my daughter such honour, who in∣tended to marry her: but it's all over now, for he never could bear the name of poetry and inspira∣tion, since one of these inspired poetasters ran away with his only daughter. What will he say when he hears the ravings of my child? Why, he'll be off the match, to be sure, and then what will she do? <HI>She</HI> must die an old maid, and <HI>I</HI> die of grief, I believe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, Sir Lambert, should you die for grief, if your daughter should resolve to follow
<PB N="6" REF="029022_0005_0FDE984E5A604DD8"/>
my glorious example, and forever remain in a state of dove-like purity?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dove-like purity! ha! ha! ha! Why you know you are mad to be married at this very moment. Did not I detect you writing a letter to your groom? Did not I prevent you from running away with your footman? And this is dove-like purity, is it! O give me patience, give me pa∣tience!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir! Sir! I'm not to be treated with this incivility—I, who am chaste as Vesta's self—What do I say! chaste as the virgins of Vesta, and am worthy of being admitted into her temple, to trim her holy lamps.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, is that ancient head of thine turned with romance too? Vesta and her virgins! O Rhadamanthus! I shall soon be as familiar with all the gods and goddesses, with their grand-sons, and their great-grand-sons, as I am with farmer Gilbert and our old parson.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter John.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, my Lord Aberford is just arrived.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Arrived! just arrived! What shall I do? I'm in a fine state to receive him! John in∣troduce him. <STAGE>Exit John.</STAGE> What shall I do! Shew him to this room, and tell my daughter to prepare to receive him!—What shall I do! what shall I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>O heavens! had I but known of his coming to-day! I'm not fit to be seen! O, this unbecoming dress! these intolerable ruffles! I shall faint to appear before him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you make as much noise as if it was to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he intended his visit.</P>

<P>And why not to me? Let me tell
<PB N="7" REF="029022_0006_0FDE9850EBD09550"/>
you, brother, the elegancies of my person are equal to those of your daughter, and will not be over∣look'd, I dare say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear sister, if you would pay more attention to the ornaments of your mind, and less to those of your person; if you would strive to adorn <HI>that</HI> with elegance, it would not be overlook'd I'm <HI>sure.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>John.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord Aberford.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter Lord Aberford.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, I'm sensible of the honour you confer upon me by this visit, and shall ever gratefully remember it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is an honour, I assure you, Sir Lam∣bert Martin, for I have not travelled ten miles be∣fore these ten years; since my daughter left me, there was a grief—O! had she married as I wish'd her, a man of your age, I might now have been happy; but, as I said before, since she left me I have led a retired life; but, thinking myself not old enough to relinquish all the joys of this world, I'm resolved to marry, and when possessed of your charming daughter, I shall be the happiest man, hey boy!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, my daughter is unworthy the honour of becoming your wife; she is perverse; may, I believe her head is turned; for, ever since I informed her that I was resolved you should be her husband, she has been seized with wild extravagant fits. <STAGE>Aside</STAGE> I must tell him, and then I fear he wont have her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fits! what sort of fits? O, 'tis her joy at the idea of becoming a lady! let me see her—I'll soon cure her of her fits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="029022_0007_0FDE985270F2EDF8"/>
<SPEAKER>Miss Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, my Lord, you shall not be de∣ceived; she's writing mad: if she was to see you, old and lame as you are, she would fancy you to be the beautiful Adonis—but here she comes, and—</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>Enter Matilda.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Niece, I'm amazed at your dressing yourself in that manner; those flowers are ridicu∣lous.</P>
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mat.</SPEAKER>
<P>These flowers are sacred, they grew on the borders of the river Permessus; Apollo and the muses sung whilst I gathered them: and O, the transports that I felt to drink the immortal waters! inspiration, joy thrill'd my bosom! I feel it now, and now, and there Apollo sings.</P>
<STAGE>Runs to Lord Aberford, who is frightened.</STAGE>
<LG>
<L><HI>There will I kneel! O blooming god of day—</HI></L>
<L><HI>To thee alone will I my homage pay;</HI></L>

<L><HI>Or thy poor suppliant this instant dies.</HI></L>

<STAGE>Starts up.</STAGE>
<P>Hark, what heavenly sounds! 'tis the harp of Zetus. Now Triton blows his silver sounding trumpet: and now it echoes o'er the foaming wave; and now, and now—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Aber.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lord have mercy on me! how she's frightened me! I shall be glad to get away—her looks are frantic—don't you think she should be con∣fined?</P>
<STAGE>To Sir Lambert.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is harmless, quite harmless—Now are all my hopes destroyed.</P>
<STAGE>Aside.</STAGE>

<P>If she is quite harmless, Sir Lambert, I might venture to take her; three thousand a year might perhaps bring her to her senses.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mat.</SPEAKER>
<P>O! I must do an act that will immortal∣ize my name! What shall it be? Ah? I have it—I'll fly to Sol, and — my knees implore, that he will let me guide <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> flaming charriot of the sun; and then! and then! Phaeton like, I'll set the world on fire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Aber.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, Sir Lambert, I dare not venture; she would set my house on fire, and burn all my family pictures. O, I dare not venture, I dare not venture! Lord, how she looks at me! don't let her hurt me—O! I'm terrified.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mat.</SPEAKER>
<P>I knew 'twas he—his azure flowing vest, his joy inspiring face, his flaming eye, 'tis Jupiter! O! how he smiles, and shining stars are round him! I will, I will embrace him, though I share the fate of hapless Semele. <STAGE>Runs to embrace him, he avoids her.</STAGE> Ah! he flies from me, and see he mounts in air! borne on yon silver floating cloud, he mounts, and leaves me here to sigh and mourn his absence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sorry for your misfortune, Sir Lambert; she is a fine girl, but she is incurable; she ought to be bled, and put in a cold bath, and kept on water gruel. I must be going, I dare not stop all night with you, for I'm afraid that she will do something to immortalize her name.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord, you must not go, the even∣ing is too far advanced; depend upon it, she will not hurt you—she is harmless as yourself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>O no, that she is not, that she is not! I expect her to fly at me again in a moment.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do go after her, Sir Lambert, and see that she is confined, and does no harm. I am happy to think my house is far enough from yours, or I should be in perpetual fear—I must not venture, I find I must not venture.</P>
<STAGE>Exit.</STAGE>

<P>By all that's unlucky, I'm the most unfortunate dog in Christendom! Here have I been wandering about for these two hours, and can nei∣ther see maid nor mistress. O Matilda! dear, cruel Matilda, where art thou? Perhaps entertaining thy old lover with thy wild chimeras, whilst thy youth∣ful adorer is venting his sighs to the moon.—I am all impatience to hear how her scheme of madness has succeeded—I hope she'll frighten the old Lord out of his matrimonial fit, and then she may be mine.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Miss Mart.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Sir! I am all confusion—I am covered with blushes to think what trouble I must have given you. O!

<STAGE>Enter Frolic.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Great guns and small arms! Here's a pretty time of night to be kicking my heels and rubbing my hands under the mournful shades of the weep∣ing willow. My master, Captain Rupert, thinks every body is as warm as himself; but faith he's mistaken. This love makes a person as hot in De∣cember as in the middle of the dog-days.—Here I left him about an hour ago, sighing and groaning for his Desdemona. Now, was I in his place, instead of reconnoitering the out works, I'd storm the castle, force the battlements, and carry off the prize triumphant—None of your whining lovers for me—I have been bred up to the wars; my country is my mistress; my heart, my honour, my life are her's; and like an ardent lover, I'd die to defend her—Hey! who comes here? Matilda's maid.</P>

<STAGE><HI>Enter Dolly.</HI> My charming, my delightful, enchanting Doll, give me a kiss. [<HI>Runs up to her, and kisses her.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dol.</SPEAKER>
<P>La! Mr. Frolic, you are very rude; I doesn't suffer such liberties to be taken with me, I assure you; I that am as great a wirgin as a westal, as Miss Martin says—Now, if ever you hopes to win my affection, you must imitate the heroine of some great romance, such as Don Quixote, for in∣stance—Why, I have heard how he conquer'd ar∣mies, subdued towns, and fought giants to gain HIS Doll—Cinca and I thinks, as I have often thought, as how I am worthy of being traduced into some helegant novel; am not I, my dear Frolic?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="14" REF="029022_0013_0FDE9863857406D0"/>
<SPEAKER>Frol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why yes, Mrs. Dolly, the novel would be very fine to be sure, were you the heroine; and to gain <HI>your</HI> heart, my charmer, I would do as much for you as Don Quixote ever did for his Dulcinea.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but that's impossible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frol.</SPEAKER>
<P>By my soul it's true, for I'd rout every flock of sheep in the adjoining common; and, with my sword drawn, I'd quarrel and fight with the first wind-mill that chanced to place itself in my way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sheep and wind-mills, Mr. Frolic! (<HI>passion</HI>) you mean this as an insult upon my judgment! I that have received daily lectures from the learned Miss Martin, who is the delight of Mal-pomene, Polly Hymnia, Call-ye-up, and the distressing muse of tragedy, Thalia!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, my dear, learned Dolly, let us re∣tire, or such a combination of hard words will so bewilder my ideas, that I shall forget to call my master up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Call your master up! Why, you illiteral man, you! I meant the muse Call-ye-up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Frol.</SPEAKER>
<P><STAGE>Pausing</STAGE> O! O! I suppose you mean Cal∣liope, the muse of eloquence; upon my soul I don't wonder at the brilliancy of your expressions, now I find you are under her influence; but I'm afraid, my dear Dolly, nature never formed you for a votary to the muses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nature never formed me! so you mean it as a disparagement to my person;—let me tell you, that I am the toast of the village; that John, our footman, is dying for me; and that Dick, the gar∣dener, compared my neck to the full blown sun∣flower, and my cheeks to the beautiful crimson of the opening poppy—Nature never formed me, in∣deed! Well then, one of the graces did; and
<PB N="15" REF="029022_0014_0FDE9867E0CE73E8"/>
though every one is in love with my wit, I've more sense than to run mad, as my Mistress Matilda has done: but, I supposes, it is because her father is going to force her to marry an helpless old Lord, when she might have your master, a smart young Captain; but he has no money, and so he dares not openly to discover his passion. Well, for my part, I likes a young man that hasn't a farthing, better than a rich old Lord with his weight in gold.</P>

<P>Tell you! Ah! I have no time to lose—I have but a moment to live—I, I have re∣ceived a mortal wound; the dagger has certainly pierced a vital part; and now I repent my ill usage to my nephew—if I could but see him before I die I should be happy.</P>

<P>I see you are not dead; but what's the matter friend? you seem very much alarmed.</P>

<P>Dear Sir, have you not heard I'm wounded, mortally wounded? I am, sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wounded! and in my house! who gave you the wound? and where did you receive it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Sir! your daughter gave it me—'tis in my back, and I shall shortly die.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Sir Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>My daughter! O heavens! let me look at the wound—'tis in your back you say. <STAGE>Pulling off his coat.</STAGE> Why, here is not one speck of blood to be seen; the waistcoat is quite entire: you must be wrong—I'm sure she could not hurt <HI>you.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Lord Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, if all this pain should be only the effects of fear! <STAGE>Aside</STAGE>—Dear Sir Lambert, look again; I think I am wounded, at least I hope I am wounded—O! I would give my head to be wound∣ed—If I am not wounded, how ridiculous I shall look.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Lord you may make yourself per∣fectly happy, for I can assure you that you are not wounded.</P>

I shall be laughed at! they'll put me in the news∣papers, and I shall be branded with the name of coward as long as I live. I had better have died with a wound than of grief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ha! ha! ha! I can't help laughing—ha! ha! ha! I beg your pardon, but I can't help it—And so you fancied yourself mortally wound∣ed!—ha! ha! ha!—What weapon did she make use of to terrify you so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, Lord, Sir, my fear would not let me look, but I believe it was a dagger or a carving-knife: and she uttered such dreadful words that fill'd my poor heart with horror; my fear was so great, that I supposed she had wounded me; but I think she has not, I think she has not—if I once get away from this house I shall be happy. Have you seen my nephew, Sir Lambert?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; why, is your nephew here?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, he came in just time enough to save me, or I should have certainly died with fear, and I have rewarded him with two thousand pounds a year for his trouble.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall be happy in having the plea∣sure to know him: I hear he is a fine young man, and since <HI>you</HI> have rejected my daughter, I shall have no objection to bestow her on <HI>him.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>He</HI> marry your daughter! No, no Sir, he will not marry a mad woman. O, my poor back! it still aches with pain, as if there was a wound.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, my dear Lord Aberford, my daughter was lately a charming, sensible girl, and there is no doubt but she will speedily recover her senses, for I begin to suspect that you was the cause of her madness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>I the cause of her madness! How could I be the cause of her madness?—She's nearly been the cause of my death I know.</P>

<P>To bespeak your coffin! ha! ha! ha! well, I'll take care that you are not put into it, so don't frighten yourself.</P>

<P>I should not be so much frightened at that neither, Sir Lambert.</P>

<P>Sir Lambert, I know who he means. No, no, Captain Rupert has more discernment, more prudence, and more discretion than to make choice of one so much my inferior in every respect.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord Ab.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nephew, is she your choice? Ha! ha! ha! I can't help laughing in spite of my misfor∣tunes: well, you must confess that I have the better taste.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Lamb.</SPEAKER>
<P>Captain, I shall be obliged to you for an explanation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Capt. Rup.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me, Sir Lambert, for indulg∣ing your sister's weakness, for my intentions were laudable; I did it with a view to open her eyes, that she might see the impropriety of her conduct. I found her breathing soft sighs to the moon, and, in the language of romance, wishing for a youthful adorer. Chance threw me in her way. She be∣came enamoured with my person; but I believe had it been my footman he would have been equally fortunate. I bestowed encomiums on her, which might have flattered an angel; and she, supposing all a just tribute to her beauty, eagerly believed them to be true. Forgive me, Madam, for thus exposing your secrets; I hope it will warn you to be more prudent in future. Believe me, Madam, I have a respect, nay, veneration for you, because you are the aunt of my charming Matilda; but remember that your person has long since lost its attraction, and I would advise you to lay by those romantic notions, and become a useful member of society.</P>
